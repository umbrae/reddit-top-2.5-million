And upvotes for anyone that just whines and bitches. It is extremely annoying and we as a community should be better than this.

God save me from some aspects of the MMO community. You people are impossible. You have ruined a ton of AAA games in the last few years - you DEMAND treadmill gated endgame, beat it in a month, and then whine and abandon a game for not having enough content (you all know exactly the games I am talking about). Now a game has to literally FORCE you to stop doing the same mindless activity over and over and actually do different things to enjoy endgame, and you all bitch and whine because you can't **grind yourself to boredom** in a month like you have done with every other MMO.

You are destroying the viability of MMOs by being entitled impatient kids who can't make fun for yourself, you have to have a game hand it all to you on a silver platter and whine and bitch if you don't get it fast enough, or complain because you have to work hard to get something you want because they **won't let you run the easiest dungeon over and over or run the same dynamic event over and over**. Fuck everyone whining about this.

You all keep acting like this, you realize NO MMO WILL EVER SATISFY YOU. You will buy a new MMO, play it for a month - bitch and whine - and then abandon it and the company will lose money. What will happen in 5-10 years? Nobody will be making MMOs anymore, because they will simply not be profitable.

Maybe the problem isn't the MMO, maybe the problem is you. Maybe you need to examine the way you approach an MMO - many of you will spend hours playing a FPS with no progression because it is fun - and then you whine because spvp has no progression and say so ""what incentive do I have to do spvp if I don't get better gear?"" (Actual statement I have heard).

Many of you will spend hours exploring the world in Skryim, doing tons of side-quests, and yet whine and complain because all there is to do in GW2 is explore the world and run dungeons and do events. That is like **rushing to finish the storyline quests in Skyrim and then complaining that the game has almost no content.**

Why can't we as an MMO community take the attitude we bring to FPS games, RPG games, and apply it to an MMO? Too many damn players feel like the only thing that motivates them in an MMO is the ""carrot"" of gear always being held out in front of them (and don't know what to do with themselves without it) - and you are destroying the genre. You need to fix that shit before you destroy the genre that we love.

**We take the attitude of playing games for FUN in almost every other genre, so why can't we do it for MMOs too?**

I'd like to apologize for writing an earlier comment that cast doubt on his accomplishment. At the same time Surfeuze was racing to level 80, we were tracking and talking with other players who were racing toward 80 as well, using a technique that really shouldn't be that lucrative and that we're making changes to fix. We believed one of those players would be first to 80, and when Surfeuze posted of his accomplishment, I mistakenly thought he was a player who had used that technique.

In fact he wasn't. Surfeuze played normal PvE content to level 60, although obviously racing past everything he could, and then leveled from 60 to 80 through crafting. His secret weapon was his strong team supplying him with crafting materials. That allowed him to jump ahead of everyone else in those last 20 levels.

So congratulations to Surfeuze, legitimately the first player to reach level 80.

To keep Guild Wars 2 a pleasant place to be, we take action against racist names, hate speech, and other unacceptable behavior. We have suspended some accounts involved in the use of offensive character names or inappropriate chat. The number of account blocks is miniscule: less than  .001% of our total player base.


When an account is blocked for a chat offense, the account is given a three-day suspension. When an account is blocked for an offensive name, the player is required to rename the character name and, in most cases, the account is also given a three-day suspension.

We have reviewed all the name suspensions currently in place. Where we could give some leeway, we removed the account suspension, which will allow those players to rename the character and rejoin the game. However, for substantially offensive names, we will keep the full three-day suspensions in effect.

In a few posts on Reddit and on fan forums, players have claimed they were suspended for using a harmless-sounding character name, when in fact they were suspended for a different and truly offensive character name on their account. Others claimed that they were not told why they were suspended, but the game does give a message that states the reason for the suspension. In every case we have double-checked, the action taken on the account was appropriate.

However, we'd like to clear up any misconceptions. If you think you were unfairly suspended, or if you'd like to know the specific chat or character name that got you suspended, post your character name and we’ll reply in graphic detail with the reason for the block. Warning: NSFW ahead!

You can read our name policy [here](https://www.guildwars2.com/en/legal/guild-wars-2-naming-policy/). You can get a lot of good info about GW2 support policies in [this doc](https://www.guildwars2.com/en/legal/guild-wars-2-conduct-breaches-outcomes/).

1346283089.0,1585,self.Guildwars2,z1poz,"Guild Wars 2 status - Wednesday, August 29",2596,1011,979,http://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/z1poz/guild_wars_2_status_wednesday_august_29/,"This is the current status of the most important issues we're tracking with *Guild Wars 2* live service.

**Account security** - We're seeing an uptick in reports of account theft and attempted account theft. We believe hackers are using databases of email addresses and passwords stolen from other games and web sites, and pre-existing trojan horses, to search for matching *Guild Wars 2* accounts which they attempt to compromise. To prevent this, we have temporarily disabled the ""reset password"" feature, and we're working to bring email authentication online. To protect yourself, please ensure that you use a unique password for *Guild Wars 2* that you don't use for any other game, email account, forum or web account.

**Email authentication** - Email authentication is a feature that notifies you if someone tries to log into your account from a location you've never logged in from before. Thus, even if someone guesses your game password, he can't log in unless he also guesses your email account password. You can make email authentication even more secure by using an email provider that supports two-factor authentication, such as [Google](https://support.google.com/accounts/bin/answer.py?hl=en&amp;answer=185839&amp;topic=1056283&amp;ctx=topic) or [Yahoo](http://www.ymailblog.com/blog/2011/12/yahoo-introduces-stronger-user-authentication-%E2%80%93-second-sign-in-verification/), and taking advantage of that. We're currently preparing email authentication and intend to deploy it in a phased rollout, starting on Thursday, August 30.

**Parties, guilds, etc.** - Parties, guilds, and other social features are periodically failing. This causes issues such as party members not appearing on the map, and party members not staying in the same overflow servers as they travel between maps. This happens particularly during times of peak usage. We're working to fix related problems and mitigate this issue with each subsequent update.

**Worlds** - Many worlds are filling up. We're keeping the number of worlds constrained so that worlds stay well populated even after the initial surge of high concurrency. However, we will add worlds as necessary. As of Wednesday, August 30, all German language worlds are full and all French language worlds are at high usage, so we're adding two new German language worlds and one new French language world.

**Overflow worlds** - During this initial surge of high concurrency, and especially while many characters are low-level and thus playing in the same starting areas, it's common for players to be directed to overflow maps. If you want to play with a friend, but you’re not on the same overflow map, you can form a party together, then right-click on your friend's portrait in the party list and click ""join"". Note that this functionality is sometimes intermittently unavailable due to the ""parties, guilds, etc."" issues noted above.

**Trading Post** - We're working to bring the Trading Post back online. To help test, we've temporarily made it available to a random 15% of players, while we work to resolve remaining capacity constraints that will allow us to open it to everyone.

**Edit: We have completed our live testing of the Trading Post for today and the Trading Post is now in maintenance for all players. Thank you everyone that participated; this test has helped us tremendously.**

**In-game mail** - We detected a potential abuse of the in-game mail system and have temporarily disabled in-game mail to prevent any such abuse. We'll reenable it soon, hopefully in tonight's update.

**Edit: The fact that in-game mail is disabled means that it's currently impossible for account hackers to loot stolen accounts, so we're going to leave it disabled for just a little while longer, while we work to ramp up email authentication.**

**Botting** - We'll start substantial banning of bots on Wednesday, August 29. Since we're currently seeing widespread casual, unsophisticated botting, we will start with 72-hour bans for first offenses. In the coming days, as we address the casual botting problem, we plan to switch to our normal policy of permanently banning anyone who runs a bot.

**Forums** - Our most important priority at the moment is to ensure that the game runs stably and flawlessly. So as to not create additional demand on our infrastructure and on our programming team, we made the decision not to open the forums until the initial mass influx of players has calmed down a bit.

**Next software updates** - The next update of the game server and back-end server software will take place tonight at midnight Seattle time. The game may be unavailable for approximately 20-60 minutes while we perform the update. We expect this update to have fixes for email authentication and in-game mail. Our continued work on the Trading Post is not tied to game updates, so we will continue to test Trading Post updates throughout the day.

All I would really like is to be able to check on the map which asura gate goes where. I guess it could be done using a method other than the map, but I figure map is the easiest. Thoughts?

Edit: A lot of people have been mentioning the guards in Lion's Arch. Those do work, but they're a less than ideal solution, since it still requires a visual on the gates and the guards can be difficult to see if the area is crowded.

We also believe and respect that people make mistakes. This is in fact the first example of a widespread exploit in the game. With this in mind, we are offering the members of our community who exploited the game a second chance to repair the damage that has been done.

1346165913.0,1431,self.Guildwars2,yyp9y,Anti-Fun Issues Discovered During Head Start and Proposed Solutions,2070,639,650,http://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/yyp9y/antifun_issues_discovered_during_head_start_and/,"Some of these issues are already on the front page, but I wanted to include all of the interruptions in fun from my first few days of playing. They are in no particular order.

* **Problem #1:** Having the ""f"" key perform all actions creates a great deal of frustration when many different action types occupy the same space.

*Solution #1:* Split up actions in the keybinds. Allow users to assign the same key to all actions or different keys to each.

* **Problem #2:** Withdrawing items from the collection for crafting is tedious.

*Solution #2:* Allow crafting items to be used directly from the collection and bank. Alternatively, add options to withdraw all items of a specific discipline.

* **Problem #3:** Items in the collection cannot directly be added to mail. This adds an unnecessary step when trying to send materials to friends.

*Solution #3:* Add ""Send mail to..."" to the context menu of items in the collection, and also enable drag and drop functionality from the collection to the email pane.

* **Problem #4:** When attempting to send mail to a contact, the player must type that persons full name unless using the related ""Send mail"" function in the party UI.

*Solution #4:* Add auto-completion to the ""To:"" field that includes contacts, recent whisper recipients, and recent mail recipients.

* **Problem #5:** When a party member is logged out, right clicking their portrait no longer gives the option to send them mail.

*Solution #5:* Enable the ""Send mail to..."" option regardless of party members' online status.

* **Problem #6:** Quest related items that cannot be sold or salvaged appear too similar to some junk trophies.

*Solution #6:* Label these items, so I can easily identify them and destroy them after the related heart quest or dynamic event is over.

* **Problem #7:** Some pet abilities feel unresponsive and do not activate on the first attempt.

*Solution #7:* Give the player feedback when they attempt to activate an ability for their pet and that ability will never be executed. (ex. pet too far away from target)

* **Problem #8:** When a player first chooses which utility skills will fill their slots, their underwater utility skill choices remain blank. The player is not made aware of this until they attempt to use a utility skill underwater.

*Solution #8:* When a player first fills a utility slot and the opposite land/water slot is empty, fill the corresponding utility slot with the same skill as long as that skill can be used in that environment. Alternatively, educate the player through hints about underwater utility choices.

* **Problem #9:** Players are unable to edit their underwater utility skills unless they are underwater. This is a problem because underwater areas in Tyria are rarely ""safe"" and as a result are not conducive to considering and assigning skills.

*Solution #9:* Allow the player to edit underwater utility choice while on land.

* **Problem #10:** Unlike other weapon and utility skills, the player is unable to see skills for weapon kits or tool belt skills before equipping and using the skills.

*Solution #10* Flesh out the skill tool tips where necessary, so that skills can be weighed and compared without excessive swapping and testing.

* **Problem #11:** New players are unable to read and consider downed abilities prior to being downed. The frantic nature of the downed state does not usually allow enough time for careful reading of abilities. This problem also extends to other conditional skills such as necromancer wraith form.

*Solution #11:* Provide a method for new players to calmly read and consider their downed abilities and conditional class abilities outside of combat.

* **Problem #12:** After double clicking a salvage kit, using the scroll bar will remove the salvage cursor. This can be a minor inconvenience or a major problem in the case of low resolution systems where scrolling is all but necessary.

*Solution #12:* Do not remove the salvage cursor when using the inventory scroll bar.

* **Problem #13:** When hovering over and item in preparation for salvaging it, the player is not shown a comparison of the item with their current weapons and armor.

*Solution #13:* Add a comparison to current weapons and armor on hover when the salvaging cursor is active.

* **Problem #14:** The player must hover over each recently acquired item in their inventory when choosing what to salvage in order to see if the item is salvageable or not.

*Solution #14:* Upon double clicking the salvage kit, grey out all non salvageable items.

* **Problem #15:** If an engineer wishes to set an ability in their weapon kit to be an auto attack, then they must do so every time they equip the kit.

*Solution #15:* Remember auto-attack selection for weapon kits and other temporary weapons (such as the elementalist's lightning hammer)

* **Problem #16:** When salvaging a rare item, the salvage cursor is deactivated after the confirmation dialogue.

*Solution #16:* Keep the salvage cursor active after selecting your choice on the confirmation dialogue.

**TLDR; I got 99 problems, but A-Net ain't one.**

**Edit #1:** I'm going out for lunch. Please continue leaving comments and I will go through them when I return.

**Edit #2:** Back from lunch. 121 comments to sift through. Updates soon. As a reminder this post is for listing features that are working as intended, but that we wish to see changed. It is not for bugs.

**Edit #3:** There is officially no hope of getting through this growing list of comments. I feel I captured the few remaining issues that myself and others experienced. Thank you for your input and for putting this where A-Net may read it. Hopefully your help will make this game the most fun it can possibly be. Also, thank you A-Net for making the game that will consume my life for years to come.

**Edit #4:** I'm done adding issues to the list. I fixed formatting to make it easier on A-Net to read. *crosses fingers* 

**Edit #5:** I received quite a few comments in regard to the minor nature of these issues and how it is not worth it to discuss them. I am going to use one of my replies from below to address all of these individuals.

&gt; If you haven't figured out the connection between all of these ideas, it is that they are all things you need to do a lot. Many many times per play session.

&gt; A pebble in your shoe is a very small problem. If you walk 10 miles it is an annoyance. If you walk 100 miles it can be a huge issue. I'm just trying to help arena net take out the pebbles early on before anyone really notices.

**Edit #6:** Some commentors have taken issue with my use of the term ""anti-fun"". I define ""anti-fun issues"" as any issue that detracts from the fun of the game. I do not think these things make the game completely un-fun. They simply detract from fun things and make them slightly less fun.

**Edit #7:**

Now that I've accumulated all of the recipes, I've started to get irritated with how hard it is to find a specific food for a specific purpose. There are lots of lists of food, but if you want to make, say, condition damage food for a level 40 friend, none of them are helpful.

**[So I compiled a list.](http://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/User:Dacromir/Food)** Then I figured that after putting all that effort into the list, it would be a shame not to share it.

It's really cool to see the patterns in which foods give you what. I already knew that [cookies give you healing](http://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/User:Dacromir/Food#Healing) and that [pizza is basically steroids for condition builds](http://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/User:Dacromir/Food#Condition_Duration_2), but I don't think I'd realized that [sautees give you might on kill and critical damage](http://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/User:Dacromir/Food#Might_.2B_Critical_Damage). Fun stuff.

This shows every food on the wiki's [Chef page](http://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Chef), with a few deliberate exceptions. If anything isn't on the list, it's not on the Chef page. Drop me a message on my talk page, or on the wiki talk page. For bonus points, add it yourself. This is a wiki after all.

EDIT: For those who are commenting, no I do not plan on keeping this hidden away in my user page. I'm going to keep *this version* hidden away, because I don't want mine cluttered with stupid foods (+15% chill duration? 15 minutes of 20 power? Lame). However, I'm going to be making a copy of this page which will be cleaned up, completed, and made into a public wiki page.

We wanted to give you all an update on the Difficulty of BWE3, as it has been the topic of many conversations recently. 


First of all, it is important to understand that the game is still in Beta and that we continue to balance on a daily basis. This said, and as usual, your feedback has proven invaluable. Following the weekend we drilled into our Event metrics, and discovered that the difficulty had indeed changed between BWE3 vs. BWE2. We moved ahead with a check on our core systems to find out if any global change/bug had incurred a generic adjustment to the balance of the game. Quickly we found this to be the case, and the issue has now been corrected. 


We also wanted to take the time to mention, that we feel the overall pacing of the game is exactly where we want it. Specifically that we do not want the player to be in a constant state of overly challenging gameplay, and therefore the difficulty is now reflective of the balance found in BWE2, without a change in overall pacing. 


Finally, we continue to balance both our creatures and our professions. Your feedback, once again has proven invaluable to us, and we ask that you continue to let us know what you think about the game, and keep posting your suggestions as we get ever closer to the release of Guild Wars 2.


See you in Tyria!

He also loves WvW.

What he said was that the only thing he wishes they would add was a duel system: Two players able to fight 1vs1.

Do you think this is a feature that ArenaNet should consider in future updates? Why or why not?

EDIT: Front page news already? You guys are the best.

EDIT: I don't expect it to be a central point of the game, but really, it would be that for people who take it seriously.

EDIT: Looks like a lot of people here prefer it to be in a certain area, not all over the map. A popular choice is to have an arena somewhere in Lion's Arch, and allow others to bet on a match before it starts. ArenaNet, will you do it?

EDIT: I just noticed it's the top piece of news in the front page. I'm guessing this is an important topic for most of us.

EDIT: **tl;dr #1. Duels would be acceptable if they're in a specific area such as arenas in the major cities, nobody can spam you anywhere with duel requests while you're busy with something else and nobody can bet or win any rewards on it.

However, recently my wife has let my 5 year old son play it about 30 minutes a day, and after watching him, my wife told me that it was absolutely fascinating how he played and she (my wife :P) can't explain how he levels so quickly.  She (my wife :P) encouraged me to play together with him, since in a very short amount of play time he has reached level 12.  So last night I took my Necro over and we played together.  He was very excited to teach me his tips and tricks to success in GW2, so I thought I would share.

Here is what I learned.

1.  Apparently, you must wander in what ever direction kind of looks interesting to you.

  A.  If he sees another player, he may get very excited and run toward them to ""help them out"".

  B.  If he's surrounded by mobs, he will carefully look around and decide which mob he likes to kill exclaiming ""Ooo he's level 11! I'm just 10! He could kill me!""  
  C. A lot of his focus is going to ""win the diamonds"" (discovering the waypoints).

  D. If he sees a body of water, he might exclaim ""Let's go have a swim! Follow me, I'll show you how to swim!""

2. When downed, wait patiently even if no one is around, because someone will eventually come along and rez you.

  A.  We've explained to him he can come back at the waypoints, but he remarks ""I know! But watch! Someone will come save me! I promise!"" and then proceeds to look around and wait patiently for as long as it takes.  Luckily during our run, I was there and could ""get his back"".

  B.  When getting rezzed by two or more people, he gets so excited apparently that he leaves the game immediately to go throughout the house to tell everyone the exciting news.  Of course, I exclaimed ""Aren't you in a battle?! You just left them?!"" to which he responded ""Oh yeah!!!"" and ran back.

3.  He finds Youtube unnecessary when discovering challenging undiscovered vistas.  His preferred method of technique is simply to wait patiently for as long as it takes for someone else to come discover the vista.  He then watches them closely and follows them to discover the vista.

The most perplexing mystery of all, is the evening I spent with him playing, I didn't really feel like I was doing much of anything.  It was a strange sort of relaxed just look around and enjoy your surroundings sort of play.  However, he leveled up twice during our playing that evening.  TWICE, without any of my normal ""Ok what heart do I go to next? Any events in the area? How's my gear doing? Where should I put these points?"" type play.

Anyways, I thought it was interesting...

I have a physical disability called Arthrogryposis, which falls under the umbrella of Muscular Dystrophy. As such, I’ve spent a good portion of my life volunteering and fundraising for Muscular Dystrophy Canada, and now, I’m looking to fundraise while I enjoy playing GW2.


I’ll be doing Structured PvP (and maybe some WvW) for the next 12 hours to try and raise awareness and funds for Muscular Dystrophy.

**Disclaimers**

* I’m no pro gamer. I play to enjoy myself, but I do consider myself to be better than an average player.
* I will have to occasionally go afk when my care workers show up to help me. At most these breaks will last 15 minutes.
* My headset is quality is pretty bad. Unfortunately, I have trouble using headsets that cover both ears, so I'm stuck using a cheap one.

While playing WvWvW tonight against Yak's Bend and Northern Shiverpeaks, we were greatly upset to discover that someone had hacked their way into our Garrison on the Sanctum of Rall Borderlands and stole our orb. We then watched as the orb flew around the map before finally stopping in Yak's Bend's Ascension Bay to be placed upon their altar.

So far, this story is similar to a lot of the stories that have been popping up as of late, tales of hacking and cheating to get the advantage. This next part is where it gets really interesting though. We were nearly instantly contacted by the leader from FOO, one of the major guilds on Yak's Bend. Turns out that they were as bothered by the cheating as we were, and they wanted to make amends in the best way that they could.

Yak's Bend, under the leadership of FOO, collaborated with the leaders of EPIC from Sanctum of Rall in order to organize the trading of Ascension Bay. We were allowed to seize Ascension Bay entirely unopposed such that we may take back the orb that rightfully belonged to us. In exchange for this kindness, we in turn left Ascension Bay immediately after capturing the point so that the zerg from Yak's Bend could take the keep back. Aside from a few pugs, not a single attack took place from either server while this exchange took place. It was quite possibly one of the most impressive things I've seen since this game came out.

I would like to thank Yak's Bend for suggesting this exchange, and for ensuring that the deeds of the many overcame the negative actions of the few, and taking a risk in letting us seize a stronghold for the purpose of rectifying a mistake.

*I haven't really decided what to make this into yet. After 200+ hours ingame my head is chock full of tidbits that a lot of people don't seem to know. My goal is to educate and maybe bring light to certain confusing aspects of the game. If people like it I will make more parts. If people don't like it I'll probably still make more parts. Enjoy.*

**Basic knowledge:**

**1. Using Lion's Arch as a hub.**

 Lions arch is a town that is unique in the fact that it has portals (those purple swirly things on map) to each of the 5 races major cities. What makes this useful is that from anywhere in the world you can open up your Hero panel, click the pvp tab at the bottom on the left side, and click the button that says ""Enter the Mists"". You can then enter the portal from there and go into Lions Arch and from there go to any of the races starting cities. Everything I just said above is **FREE**.

**2. Crafting gives you experience based on a % of your current level.**

 Every crafting discipline will give you 10 level if you max it to 400 no matter when you start it. If you start it at level 1, it will get you to level 11. If you start it at level 51, it will get you to level 61. The experience you gain is a percentage whatever your current level is, no matter what that may be. 

From 1-100 crafting skill you gain 1% of a total level in xp (i.e. you will gain 1 level from this crafting)

From 101-200 crafting skill you gain 2% of a total level in xp (i.e. you will gain 2 levels from this crafting)

From 2001-300 crafting skill you gain 3% of a total level in xp (i.e. you will gain 3 levels from this crafting)

From 301-400 crafting skill you gain 4% of a total level in xp (i.e. you will gain 4 levels from this crafting)

*NOTE: Crafting is fun and certainly useful if you are solo. It is not a great way to make money. The odds of the average person recouping their investment is very low with the state of the economy the way it is. I will go more in depth on this later.*

**3. How to get gold.**

 I have made gold pretty much every way available and I keep coming back to the same method. Stack magic find and sell everything. Now the my advice varies based on level so let's look at the three categories of people.

 **Before level 70:** Prior to this level don't worry about magic find. Simply sell every single piece of gear you find at the vendor. Salvage (with BASIC kits) only those items that say they are specifically for salvage. As you will quickly learn, the great majority of items that you find will already be up on the TP for only a copper above what you would get selling to the vendor. These people don't understand that the TP is going to charge them a 15% fee for posting that item. This means they make less than you will by selling to vendor.

 **After level 70:** This is where it gets good. Continue to follow the strategy above, but start stacking Magic Find. Magic find doesn't increase the amount of loot you get, but it increases the quality. I have 156% MF on my warrior and when I do pretty much any dynamic event, I will get at least one Yellow (Rare) quality item. Why would you want these level 70+ yellows? Because when you use a MASTER or MYSTIC salvage kit on them, there is a very good chance you will get a Glob of Ectoplasm (about 18s item) from them along with whatever sigil or rune they have in them. ONLY level 70+ yellows give Globs of Ectoplasm. These Ectos are used to craft Orange (Exotic) gear at level 80 and you need about 35 to make a full set when you are 80. 

**Mystic Salvage Kit Recipe:** One each of yellow, green, and blue salvage kits + 3 mystic forge stones = 1x Mystic Salavge kit. 

This salvage kit has the same recovery rate as the Master but has 250 uses instead of 25. If you Salvage a lot of 70+ yellow it if far more cost effective to use these than to purchase Master Salvage kits. You can Acquire the forge stone from the Black Lion gem shop. I purchases 450 gems for 1g 18s in order to get a set of 10 stones. Then I made myself 3 of these kits. They are account bound and thus can be shared among all your alts.

**NOTE: There has been a shift in the market due to this post. It is now more profitable to only salvage 70+ yellows IF they are not part of the Traveler's MF set. Be sure to check the TP first for prices and if the yellow you have is going for more than 40 silver, then it is more profitable to sell on the TP and then buy the Ectos you need. This applies so long as Globs of Ecto stay around 20 silver a piece. But as we have seen, that can change.**
 
**4. How to get gear.**

 NEVER BUY. ALWAYS OFFER. Those words are true enough for me to consider them law. I have noticed people (read assholes) really taking advantage of new people. Let me describe what is happening. When I make a character and get him to say level 10, I want to get him a set of level 10 blues from the TP so I am really strong for my level. I go on the TP and set my limits as such.

Search item: Mighty (Because at low levels power rocks)

Level range: 10 to 10

Quality: Fine (Blue)

Category: Armor and then I do again for Weapons and Jewelry

 If you do this you will notice that level 10 Blue gear is going for anywhere from 2 silver to 5 silver a piece. These items are worth 17-24 COPPER. Anyone that sells the gear for an appropriate amount has their gear bought and relisted immediately at the much higher price. Now you can combat this very easily. 

 When you see an item you like (or more likely you want a set if you upgrade every 10 levels like I do), simply click the link that says ""place a custom offer"". The copper amount that pops up by default is the vendor price of that item you are looking at, THAT is your baseline. If there are offers to the right I will simply offer a copper more than them. The offer amounts are WAY lower than the direct buy prices. If there are no offers on an item then I simply bump that default vendor price up by 15 copper or so. 

 These offers I place always get filled within 10 minutes. There is no need to pay more than a few silver for a full set of lowbie Blue gear. Repeat this process every 5-10 levels and you will feel very overpowered for the level of content you are in. And since you are selling every piece of gear you find to vendor you will be able to EASILY fund this.

*There is a slight exception to this rule. At low levels you can salvage cloth and weapons into Jute scraps and Copper ore. These two materials go for a significant amount (around 20c each) on the TP. If you want to try your hand at selling on the TP to make a little extra coin you can try salvaging those items. Once you start getting iron and wool though I would go back to vendoring. Iron and wool go for about 6c each on the TP.*


**5. Selling on the Trading Post.**

 Selling stuff on the TP is not free. When you put something up for auction you incur an immediate 5% fee of whatever you set the selling price as. IF the item sells you will incur an additional 10% fee on the selling price as well. If you pull your item off the TP in order to relist it because someone maybe undercut you, you will incur ANOTHER 5% fee on the new selling price you have chosen.

 It is very easy for you to lose money if you are not mindful of these percentages. 


*Ok, that's a good start I think. In Part 2 I will talk about storage. There are a lot of ways for you to increase inventory space on the cheap and people do seem to struggle with this. Also if there is anything specifically you would like me to go over please let me know and I will add it to one of the posts I make.*

1346253745.0,1125,self.Guildwars2,z0uj6,PSA: It's Cheaper To Buy A New Game Copy Than 5 Character Slots And A Bank Slot (Or: Why Gem Pricing Is Messed Up),1750,625,760,http://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/z0uj6/psa_its_cheaper_to_buy_a_new_game_copy_than_5/,"**LOOK AT THE MATHS BEFORE YOU DOWNVOTE, JUST BECAUSE YOU DISLIKE AN ISSUE DOESN'T MEAN IT GOES AWAY.**

I'll be using GBP as the pricing for this, simply because I know exactly how much the game costs etc. It might be different from the US, but I doubt it's different in any statistical way.

**So, right.**
The game costs £49.99 directly from Arenanet. (The cheapest I've found is about £35~, which affects these figures significantly, but let's keep the pricing internal for now.)    
800 gems are £8.50.    
A bank slot is 600 gems.   
A character slot is 800 gems.    

**Therefore.**
5 character slots and a bank slot is 4600. That's £48.75. However, the minimum you can purchase gems in is 800 so it comes up to a total purchase of £51. The game itself is £49.99. That means it costs £1 to get the exact same cost as buying a new game directly from Arenanet.

5 character slots and a bank slot is £51.   
A full account is £49.99.   

**EVEN MORE SO, we've got it in terms of inventory space, which means it's cheaper to buy a character as a mule than to buy a bank slot. Even worse is the price of bag slots on characters.**

A bag slot is 400 gems and awards you 8-20 (I think?) inventory slots. A bank slot is 600 gems and awards you 30 inventory space.    
A character slot is 800 gems and awards you 20 inventory space with 4 free slots for bags (which can be filled with 8 slots very easily), earning you 32 slots. Therefore, giving you 52 total slots for 800 gems.

**SO, the cost per inventory space is:-**   
For a bag slot: 50 gems per inventory slot to start with, theoretical maximum of 20 gems per inventory slot.    
For a bank slot: 20 gems per inventory slot.     
For a character slot: 40 gems per inventory slot to start with, very quickly gets up to 15 gems per inventory slot. Then, eventually, to 8 gems per inventory slot.   

Obviously you also have the ability to play on that character, which makes a massive difference.

I'm sure everyone can see that there're major issues in the pricing. The gem shop items cost FAR too much for what they offer. It's better to buy a full copy of the game instead of purchasing more character slots and bank slots.",,False,self,t5_2r9po,1346255007.0,,CharrEn,True,t3_z0uj6,http://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/z0uj6/psa_its_cheaper_to_buy_a_new_game_copy_than_5/,

Just wanted to give a quick advice through personal experience.

So, I got an email from Anet that someone had tried to log onto my account from an location other than mine.

**That's tip one, keep the e-mail authentication on. Even if there's problems with it, it's better to be locked out by Anet coding errors rather than by the hand of a hacker**

That e-mail contained the ip of the person as well as the location. The first thing I did:

**Submit a ticket to Anet, and change password from a secure computer**

**EDIT: Also, do a full malware scan.**

All that you should know by now. Now, this is what I did afterwards.

After the normal procedures, I got to work trying to figure out who did this. The e-mail Anet sent me contained the IP and the location, and something felt weird. This IP is from San Francisco, not from China as you might expect. So what I did next was

**Trace the IP**

*If you don't know how to do this, it's very easy. Just google it and you'll be set in a matter of minutes. IPs aren't super-secret information only wizards can access.*

So, anyway, I also got the name of the service provider, which as it turns out, provides VPN service. One of their VPN servers is in, you guessed it, San Fransisco. I searched the hosts contact information and shot them an email.

**If you find out the hacker is using a VPN, search for the hosts website. They may have a specific e-mail to report abuse.**

This morning I got an email from the service provider that the account using the VPN to try to access my GW2 account has now been terminated.

This service cost the person actual money, I hope this will discourage them from ever trying to get to my stuff ever again, or it will cost them even more money. And if you do the same, maybe the discouragement will spread.

**Account security** - Hackers are systematically scanning email addresses and passwords harvested from other games, web sites, and trojans to see if they match *Guild Wars 2* accounts. We're taking a number of steps to protect our players from this, listed below, but we need your help too. To protect your account, make sure you use a strong, unique password for *Guild Wars 2* that you've never used anywhere else. If your password isn't strong and unique, change it right now. For the highest level of protection, also create a unique email address to use solely for *Guild Wars 2*.

Here are the things we're doing to protect your accounts.

* We have the ""password reset"" feature temporarily disabled. If you need to reset your password, contact our [customer support team](http://support.guildwars2.com/app/account/support).

* We now have email authentication turned on for all players with verified email addresses. With this feature, even if someone guesses your password, when he tries to login from a location that you've never logged in from before, you'll have an opportunity to approve or disapprove of the login through an email check.

* We've noticed that hackers who discover a working email address and password combination don't always immediately exploit the compromised account. We sent email to everyone whose account has been suspiciously logged into asking them to immediately change their email address and password.

* We will also be sending email to all customers whose accounts have been unsuccessfully tested by hackers. We strongly recommend that these customers create a new, unique email address for their account.

* We left in-game mail disabled for another half-day, because it's difficult for hackers to loot accounts when both in-game mail and the trading post are disabled. Keeping mail disabled this morning to prevent account looting gave us time to get email authentication turned on for all players, and gave players time to secure their accounts. But we will be turning in-game mail back on soon, so we ask everyone to quickly secure their accounts.

**Email authentication** - We started ramping up email authentication after last night's server update, and it's now enabled for 100% of players with verified email addresses. Email authentication provides a high level of security for everyone, and can provide an even higher level of security when combined with two-factor email authentication. Here's how you can set that up. Create a new unique Google or Yahoo email address solely for your *Guild Wars 2* account. Verify that email address with *Guild Wars 2* to turn on email authentication. Then follow the instructions at [Google](https://support.google.com/accounts/bin/answer.py?hl=en&amp;answer=185839&amp;topic=1056283&amp;ctx=topic) or [Yahoo](http://www.ymailblog.com/blog/2011/12/yahoo-introduces-stronger-user-authentication-%E2%80%93-second-sign-in-verification/) to enable two-factor authentication for all logins to your email address.

**Parties, guilds, etc.** - We're working to address problems with parties, guilds, and other social features, which cause symptoms such as party members not appearing on the map, party members not staying in the same overflow servers as they travel between maps, and guild invites and guild chat failing intermittently.

**Overflow servers** - During this initial surge of high concurrency, and especially while most characters are low-level and thus playing in the same starting areas, it's common for players to be directed to overflow servers. If you want to play with a friend, but you're not on the same overflow servers, you can form a party together, then right-click on your friend's portrait in the party list and click ""join"". Note that this functionality is sometimes intermittently unavailable due to the issues with parties and guilds noted above.

We expect the use of overflow servers to naturally subside as players spread out more through the world.

**Botting** - Yesterday we applied 72-hour account suspensions to 500 players who were running bots. We're continuing to detect and ban bots. Soon we will ramp up to our normal policy of applying permanent account bans to anyone who runs a bot.

**Exploits** - If you discover an exploit in the game, do not exploit it or publicize it, but instead notify us immediately at this new email address: exploits (at) arena (dot) net.

This morning there was a widely-publicized, newly-introduced exploit in which specific cultural weapons were selling for one-thousandth of their normal price. We fixed it with an emergency build this morning. We want to thank the vast majority of players who became aware of the issue, responsibly reported it, and did not exploit it. However, a smaller group of players did significantly exploit it, each purchasing hundreds or thousands of these weapons. We permanently banned 3,000 accounts of players who substantially exploited it, and applied 72-hours bans to another 1,000 accounts of players who mildly exploited it.

**In-game mail** - In last night's software update we fixed the potential abuse of the in-game mail system that we identified yesterday. We kept in-game mail turned off for another half-day while working to secure accounts against hackers, since in-game mail can be used to loot an account. And we kept in-game mail turned off while responding to this morning's exploit. We're now ready to re-enable it, and will do so this afternoon.

**Trading Post** - Yesterday we tested Trading Post with a random 15% of players. This test helped us gather valuable data to fix important bottlenecks. This afternoon we will test Trading Post with a random 25% of players, and then work to ramp up from there.

**Tournament Rewards** - We're working on fixing tournament chest rewards. Because this requires substantial testing, we do not have an estimated release timeframe to provide at this time.

**Forums** - Our most important priority at the moment is to ensure that the game runs stably and flawlessly. So as to not create additional demand on our infrastructure and on our programming team, we made the decision not to open the forums until the initial mass influx of players has calmed down a bit.

**Next software updates** - We're making non-disruptive changes throughout the day. We'll publish the next back-end server update tonight at midnight Seattle time. The game may be unavailable for approximately 20-60 minutes while we perform this update.

 So you've hit level 80 and have no idea what to do. Don't feel bad. When I finally got to Orr at 80 I was wearing level 60-70 greens and getting stomped repeatedly by every friggin Risen I met.

Here is my progression.

**1. Fresh level 80.**

 Go on the TP and purchase a full set of level 80 Yellow Travellers (magic find set) gear. Weapons also come in Travelers types. Due to the recent market shift, if you cannot afford Travellers just get yourself a set of yellows with nice stats so you can kill stuff efficiently. Now buy some runes for the armor and a sigil for your weapon(s).

5/6 Superior rune of the Pirate
1/6 Superior rune of the Traveler

Or vice versa works too. I just like the bonuses to Might since I'm a warrior.

Now buy a level 80 Sigil of Luck and add it to your weapon(s). 

*NOTE: If you dual wield, two Sigils of Luck WILL NOT STACK. What they will do is accrue the kill count twice as fast. So when you kill a mob you will get 2 points toward your cap of 25 instead of 1. A second MF Bonus icon does not display which makes me think you still only get 15% from two of these.*

 Too finish up, purchase 5 pieces of jewelry. I got my 5 pieces for about 12 Silver TOTAL. Just search in the Trinkets section of the TP for level 80 and the term OPAL MITHRIL. [Here is an example of one.](http://i.imgur.com/DmrJ9.jpg)

 All told you will spend around who the hell knows anymore gold which isn't too bad for that level especially if you have just been selling all your gear and not paying a bunch of money to learn crafting.

**2. Exotics.**

 Now you have a full yellow MF set which with food should give you about the same MF% as me. You have a couple options now. 

**A.** You can make an [Exotic MF set of glass cannon gear](http://i.imgur.com/cMxEE.jpg). (That's what I did but considering you have the yellow set for that, it isn't strictly necessary.) 

**B.** You can make your exotic dungeon/pve/pvp set of gear. (I'm working on this now.)

Here is the reason why I went with Option A first.

 I used my yellow mf set of gear to farm the events in Orr (I get about 1 yellow at least each event) and I also cleared every level 70+ zone in the game (there are only like 4). The completion rewards for the 70+ zones are level 70+ yellows and exotics. I didn't wear and of those of course, but I did salvage them into globs of ectoplasm using Master Salvage Kits (Mystic now though thanks to that helpful redditor who showed recipe). 

 Aside from that I made sure to MINE EVERY SINGLE ORICHALCUM ORE (and Orrian Sapling). They are very expensive and quite rare. Even if I had to go outta my way I was sure to snag all I could see. 

 When I had close to enough materials for the Exotic armor, I used my Master Salvage kits on my Yellow MF set. This returned to me 5 out of 6 of the runes and netted me about 5 more globs of ecto. All told I only had to purchase 6 Globs and some gossamer to finish up the materials. Basically the money I invested in my yellow MF set came back to me in mats and yet I still got the benefit of using the armor.

 Below is a list of materials needed for a full 6 piece set of HEAVY Exotic Armor. The data comes from GW2DB.com but is very difficult to tabulate with the way they have stuff laid out. 

**Draconic Set**

30x Globs of Ectoplasm

37x Bolts of Gossamer **OR** 74x Gossamer Scraps

120x Spools of Gossamer Thread (from Tailoring vendor)

16x Orichalcum Ingots **OR** 32x Orichalcum Ore

30x Vicious Claws

 The Vicious Claws can be replaced with any rare material of the same Tier. That rare material is what determines the stats that will appear on the final crafted gear. In the case of Vicious Claws it gives power/precision/mf.

 Weapons are pretty similar but there is too much variance in mats for me to list everything, but check out the recipe section on GW2DB.com and you can figure it out. 

 As far as jewelry...fuck Exotics. Seriously. You get 1% more MF and the material cost is through the roof. All told if you got all exotic jewelry you would net another 5% MF. I will be sticking with my greens.

**MF Numbers**

MF from Armor = 3x6 = 18% MF

MF from Runes = 10+50 = 60% MF

MF from Weapon = 3+15(from sigil) = 18% MF (I use a greatsword and don't know if two of these would stack)

MF Jewelry = 6x5 = 30% MF

OmNomBerry Food = 30% MF + 40% Increased gold rewards. (the raspberry bar one at 24% is good too)

That totals out to 156% MF. 

[Here](http://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/zsbvw/magic_find_and_you_a_brief_faq/) is a useful breakdown of what magic find can do for you. Credit to Nosalv

 Now there is one more Piece of gear I have left out. During your personal Storyline you will be given 2 Back slot pieces.

At level 33 you get your [first back slot item](http://i.imgur.com/faUls.jpg). This backslot can be socketed with very low level gems or a copper doubloon.

At level 80 you get your second back slot item (it is a level 80 item). This one can be socketed with anything. There is no other backslot given in between.

Now I have been told that IF your guild has purchased the Guild Armorer with influence, you can purchase more back slot items with different stats. For those of you in small guilds though you only get one chance to pick this item. So choose wisely. I went with the tanky one since my DPS/MF set is fine.

*I think Part 5 will be about the personal storyline and how quests interact with multiple people in the party. I can't guarantee that one will be completed by end of today though.*

**Why?** Two key reasons:-   
1. The main cities are meant to be the **central hubs of the game**. They are meant to allow players to travel swiftly to craft, meet up, do their personal storylines, whatever. To foster this sense of central hubbiness, **they shouldn't cost anything to teleport to**.   
2. **It is currently excessively easy (and free) to get to a main city anyway.** To save yourself about a silver (even at low levels), all you have to do is teleport to the sPvP area, take a gate to Lion's Arch, teleport to the waypoint within Lion's Arch that takes you to the gates and run through a gate to one of the main cities. **This takes under five minutes, but that's a stupidly wasted five minutes, as I'm sure anyone would agree.**

The waypoint cost of main cities is just silly, and I have no idea why it is currently in the game when we have asura gates to get around.

The event part really bothers me because in order to get anything done while leveling in a zone other than hearts, you have to follow botters and farmers around to the events, otherwise they will never be there for you to organicly trigger. Everyone complains, everyone reports, yet nothing is being done. And yes so what if arena net see that they are actually moving around and playing.. well that doesn't stop them from spamming the zone everytime a unique drops with ""You buy?"". Now in recent days this group is only making wvw queues longer by getting around 20 of them and just running dolyaks all day. They don't fight enemies, they don't fight people trying to stop them from escorting even. I hope everyone does their small part and reports these jerks for ruining a fresh game.

I bought this game on a whim, great reviews, seemed like a good time, found it on Amazon for 40 dollars(45 including shipping). Boot up the game, create an account. (Its secure, 24 character + gmail with its own 18 character password secure, both never used before)

Human Engineer, lets do this...log in, its raining, well thats cool. Go over here, this guy needs help, defend this place from centaur etc. Cool, go to otherside of fort, where 20+ centaur descend on our newbie parade. What is this, I am level 1, I should be killing bees or collecting apples....

Boss Centaur runs in, get him down to half health, knocks me down and takes off. Oh no, a repeat boss fight..wait..what....OH MY GOD WHAT IS HE DOING I AM LEVEL 1 AND IT LOOKS LIKE THINGS ARE GETTING TOO REAL FOR LEVEL 1 CHARACTER. ( I wont spoil it for anyone who hasnt started a human yet, its pretty crazy though).

I've had MMO-cynicism after wow died for me (Died for me when they announced Cata, look Taurens, people who have never considered anything other than the elements, nature, earth mother etc, now can become paladins? LORE DAMN IT)

My friends called me the Loremaster, (I even almost obtained the achievement) and I enjoy my stories. 

I am nearly level 18, and it is barely day 3 of my quest. Many Centaur have died by my hand and many more shall. I completely explored Divinity's Reach, and Queensdale, killed the Shadow Behemoth, even started a tradeskill.

Now here's where I get excited.

I need to level my trade skill, however I grow tired of the human zone, so I go to the Charr starter zone. Scaled level, I still am powerful but I will get experience as well, as well as collecting all copper ore Tyria can pump out. Naturally, I also want to explore all the locations in the Charr area too, so that's another item on my list.

Suddenly I am almost another level, without even realizing it.

2 days of game play
Not a single problem with the player-base
Zero lag
Have some Green items (took me awhile to understand Greens &gt; Blues)
THEY MADE SWIMMING FUN
THEY MADE JUMPING FUN
Lets pick up this stick, hmmm, press 1 on enemy, watch enemy get knocked back 2-3 yards away. DAT STICK

NO HAVING TO WATCH MY GUY SIT ON A BIRD AND FLY ACROSS A CONTINENT
Map UI, is amazing and pretty.
Personal Story =  Immersion

and much more you guys already know.

Havent tried PVP yet, looks great, however I am an awful keyboard turner so I'll wait a few before I bother :D.

Anyway, among all the complaints, I figure I post some happiness.

This could happen to you.

I spent $20.00 for 1600 gems in Guild Wars 2 Gem Store to buy one armor skin.


What happened was that I clicked to buy the item and I got absolutely no message and I still had 1600 gems. Nothing happened. I waited a little bit and nothing. This made me believe that the game did not process the transaction, so I tried again 2 more times. Still nothing. Realizing that the store was not functioning correctly, I went back to leveling when, after about 3 minutes, I saw 3 ingame mails with the same item. My gem balance went from 1600 gems to 100 gems.


Look, this is a real money issue with their system and I didn't panic because when problems like this happen, they usually fix the problem and refund you.


I opened a ticket to Arenanet Support team and waited for 5 days to get a response. To my surprise, this is the response I got:


&gt; Response Westley via Email 08/30/2012 05:27 AM
&gt; 
&gt; Hello,
&gt; 
&gt; Once gems are used, we are unable to reverse or alter any transactions that you make with them, including, but not limited to, trading gems for gold, ***buying unwanted items (including multiple purchases due to lag)***, or refunding partial amounts of gems from their full quantity, For more information regarding gems and gem purchases, please take a look at the Guild Wars 2 User Agreement, specifically section 4, sub-section d: http://us.ncsoft.com/en/legal/user-agreements/guild-wars-2-user-agreement.html

This is abusive. This means that when their servers are lagging, people might lose their money. They could even fake a lag on their side and still get your gems. They have a faulty system that does not give you any message confirming your purchase. Technical problems happens but NOT REFUNDING YOU is what shocked me.

The interesting part is that I have no right to complain about this. According to their user agreement, you agree that you can lose everything and you cannot complain whatsoever.

&gt; YOU ALSO ACKNOWLEDGE THAT NCSOFT HAS NO OBLIGATION TO REFUND ANY PAYMENTS, IN WHOLE OR IN PART, RELATED TO AN ACCOUNT WHETHER OR NOT SUCH PAYMENTS WERE MADE OR AUTHORIZED BY YOU, FOR ANY REASON WHATSOEVER, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO INTERRUPTION OR UNAVAILABILITY OF SERVICE (SEE ALSO SECTION 10). YOU ACKNOWLEDGE, AND FURTHER AGREE, THAT NCSOFT MAY, IN ITS SOLE AND ABSOLUTE DISCRETION, TERMINATE UNDER THE PROVISIONS OF SECTION 3(c) ANY ACCOUNT RELATED TO ANY ATTEMPT TO OBTAIN A REFUND OF ANY PAYMENTS, WHETHER SUCH ATTEMPTS ARE MADE BY CONTACTING AN ISSUER OF CREDIT CARDS OR OTHERWISE, AND THAT NCSOFT MAY TAKE ANY OTHER ACTION IT DEEMS APPROPRIATE UNDER THE CIRCUMSTANCES, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO RECOURSE BY WAY OF ANY COLLECTION AGENCY AND/OR CREDIT REPORTING AGENCY WHEN A REFUND HAS BEEN OBTAINED WITHOUT SIGNED WRITTEN CONSENT FROM A LEGALLY AUTHORIZED REPRESENTATIVE OF NCSOFT.


&gt; (vii) You acknowledge that Gems are digital material with no cash value, that no interest is paid or earned with respect to Gems, that Gems are not personal property, that the quantity of Gems in Your Account may be increased or decreased by NCsoft in its sole and absolute discretion for any reason or no reason whatsoever, that You have no right to a refund related to Gems, that there is no right to transfer or exchange Gems, and that NCsoft may limit Your license to use Gems with respect to any Item, service, Content or time period related thereto. You further acknowledge that additional restrictions related to Gems, as determined in the sole and absolute discretion of NCsoft, may be applicable if, and when, Gems are made available to You or thereafter. NCsoft may restrict the award or use of Gems based on Your country of residence or other factors.


&gt; 8. PROHIBITED AND IRREPARABLY HARMFUL ACTIVITIES CONCERNING NCSOFT

&gt; You acknowledge that You may not, without signed written consent from a legally authorized representative of NCsoft, do any of the following:

&gt; (l) Institute any arbitration or other proceeding against NCsoft except as permitted under this agreement, including any legal proceeding in court or before an administrative agency;

So you completely lose all consumer rights as soon as you agree with their user agreement.

Do you think this is correct? Again, this could happen to you and I really hope it never happens, really.

Needles to say, within a few moments a crowd formed and people were pushing eachother just to see what this big blue baddie was about. 

After epicly downing mr blue people starting asking me questions about the game, my gear and general stuff. After killing big blue I went ahead and did some WvW. And luck struck me again. We were in the middle of capping a keep with a few trebs up so people were amazed again at just how intense and huge these fights were. 

I sat there for just over an hour till I decided enough people were intrested and logged of so more people could enjoy the the game.

I was awarded with ... nothing. Save for the feeling that I gave something back to Areanet. 


**TLDR:** Played GuildWars 2 on a game convention and amazed people by letting the game do the talking.

After all the hard work and great rewards from each mission you finally kill Zhaitan and there is a huge celebration.

Great! The reward is some blueprints for WvWvW and 5 Exotic Loot Bags with a ""Random item"" inside. Cool! I was pumped for these loot bags as I figured I'd be rewarded for killing the ELDER FREAKING DRAGON. Nope. Inside my loot bags were 3 pieces of level 20-30 BLUES and 2 pieces of lv66 blue and green. 

Really?

I led an army to kill the Elder Dragon Zhaitan and I get lv20-30 gear? ArenaNet WTF? This better not be intentional because it is a pathetic and huge oversight to the reward.

UPVOTE this so hopefully ArenaNet can address this issue.

Funny enough, while sorting through all kinds of items, I found myself finding new tips and tricks to use in GW2 that I hadn't even known about.

I figured I'd compile a quick list of tips that have personally helped ME out (not to mention they were tips that I didn't even know...) Without further ado:

* To set a ping on the map, simply shift + left click on a location on your map/ minimap. 
*may be helpful while partying*

* Draw on the map is simple as well, simply shift + hold the left mouse button and drag it on the map/minimap.
*many people know this but I figured I'd throw it in for the uninformed*

* You can also put a personal marker on the map for your party members to see. To do this, simply use alt + left click. 
*very useful if I was the party lead and needed to gather everyone in a central place*

* If you get bored with clicking the same button to fire off a skill or spell, you will be happy to know that there is an autoattack option that you can utilize. Simply ctrl + right mouse click a skill and that skill will then become your autoattack letting you repeatedly use the skill without you having to press any buttons. 
*very helpful and something I didn't know about or somehow missed out on*

* To call a target, target something and then press Ctrl + T. This will give party members a message that will allow them to press T to target the same mob. 
*Very helpful for party leaders, don't know if many people utilize this*

* Shift + left clicking an item will link them in the chat. You can also shift + left click a waypoint or skill to link them in chat. 
*I've still seen in chat where people didn't know how to link, so I figured I'd throw this in as well*

* This one is definitely a timesaver for some of us: To take a quick screenshot WITHOUT the UI, simply use Shift + Printscreen. Saves the extra step of hitting Ctrl + Shift + H to disable the UI then hitting again to reenable the UI. 
*The most helpful of all tips, I'm now going to snap screenshots a lot more. Definitely helps speed things up*

* Alt + Left click on an item, skill etc to automatically put it in chat. Instead of shift clicking which just places it in the chat entry box. Alt + click puts it into the chat window without having to hit enter. - 
**Special thanks to aNERDon for pointing this time saver out**

* Holding down alt and/or control will display names of interactables on the screen. Useful for many heart quests! - 
**Special thanks to Sryzon &amp; many others for the tip**

* To split your stacked items and only select a few items from a stack just alt + left click and drag to an open slot in your bag. - 
**Special thanks to Garenzy for the tip**

* In the inventory screen if you click the cog wheel you can select deposit ALL collectibles. It's a huge time saver some people might have missed.

* When you are doing a heart quest or just farming mats from nodes, you don't have to stop auto running. If you hold alt down to see all the yellow names pop up (like iron ore) while your running by you can hit gather while still auto running. After you character is done at the node he will continue running the direction you are looking -
**Special thanks to Vonskrump for the awesome tips**

* Type /wiki &lt;search term&gt; in the chat and it will open your browser and redirect you to the official wiki article!
for example: /wiki Iron Ore /wiki Ascalon Catacombs - 
**Special thanks to Fzninuse for the tip**

* If you right click on a dye color in your panel, it adds that color to a favorites panel in the dye menu. -
**Special thanks to Jatzninc &amp; LaughingPlague for the tip**

* In chat, typing /death(s) - lists number of times you've died.
/age - total time you have played on your character and total time. Although I'm not sure why but there seems to be missing time between total character time and total play time.
/ dance * - sync your dancing with other people for awesome Synchronized dance parties. - 
**Special thanks to Jiped for the tip**

* You can set your status (in the Y menu) to LFG. Players in the same zone as you can then add LFG players by going to the Y menu then selecting the tab on the side. - 
**Special thanks to iRanga0 for the tip**

Hopefully one/some of these were a little help to you. If you know any tips or tricks that others may be unaware of, definitely post them here. I was surprised at just how many people didn't know about some of the above tips. (myself included on a few of them)

**EDIT: Wow, this has gotten a massive response from people and there are a TON of helpful tips. Since my workload has picked up I haven't been able to add more to my original post but I WILL be adding some of the tips from below here into my OP when I get home.

My girlfriend asked one of our friends who is working to become a concept artist to draw a piece of our characters running around Dredgehaunt Cliffs.

The other advantage of that is: that's how we'll attract more people to this subreddit! 20,000 is great, but let's not stop there. We can easily be the most popular MMO subreddit.

Let me open up with a quote from Jim Boer (Arenanet Employee) about this.

&gt;No matter how fantastic a game’s music is, when you hear the same music for the thousandth time, you start wanting to change things up a bit. Many players will simply turn the game music off and play their own collections. The problem is that an external music player has no context as to what’s going on in-game. Guild Wars 2 will offer a solution for this as well. We’re giving players the option of choosing external music playlists that the game’s audio engine will use as a replacement for the default in-game music. Players can choose different playlists for background ambience and battle music, for instance.  Additionally, when appropriate, such as during cinematics, the game can revert back to in-game music temporarily to give the best possible cinematic experience, then resume the custom playlist when it’s done.
Did you know you can replace the (awesome) music in the game and substitute it with your own? -Jim Boer

This a feature in the game that in my opinion does not recieve enough recognition.

Here's how you do it:

&gt; Go to you documents folder -&gt; Guild Wars 2 -&gt; Music.

&gt;Create a playlist using your favorite media player.

&gt;The music files have to be in a format that FMOD supports by default: .mp3, .ogg, .flac, .wav, .aiff, .mid, .it etc.

&gt; The playlist formats that are supported are: .wpl, .m3u, .pls, .asx, and .wax

&gt; To play your playlists you have to give it a specific name. The playlist names that are currently recognized by the game are:

&gt; * Ambient
&gt; * Battle
&gt; * Underwater
&gt; * City
&gt; * MainMenu
&gt; * NightTime
&gt; * Crafting
&gt; * BossBattle

&gt; So if you have a playlist in the Guild Wars 2 Music folder called 'City', this playlist will start to play when you are in Hoelsbrak! Awesome!

Hope this little guide helps you!

But did you know there's already a site for all of these and more - plus, it's integrated right into the game?",1164,274,175,http://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/10ztd8/lately_some_sites_which_specialize_in_various/,"I'm speaking, of course, about the **[Guild Wars 2 Official Wiki](http://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Main_Page/)**. We really don't need a separate website for vistas, another for dyes, yet another for armors and crafting, and so on and so forth - we already have this resource available to us. If you're unaware, with a wiki there's no need to wait for one person to update a specialized site, as wikis have the ability to be edited and improved by anyone at all! Yes, that includes *you*.

So here's how the integration works. Say you're in game and you want to find a shade of white for your armor. You could search the trading post and see white dye for sale, but you'd be unable to preview it before buying it. Or, you could open up chat and simply type **/wiki White Dye** and load up the wiki page for White Dye. Right [now that page in particular](http://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/White_Dye) is rather barren - but this is where we all can pitch in. Imagine if the dye pages had links to other dyes in that shade/material/set, pictures of the dye in use on all three armor types, and even an item-linking code so you could copy and paste it into chat and use the tooltip to preview it in-game on your own armor.

The same could also apply to armor pages - find some boots and want to see what the whole set looks like? /wiki it and bring up the page showing the armor's six variations (male/female, humanoid/charr/asura), where it may drop or be purchased from, what materials are required if it's a crafted item, and so forth.

Needless to say, this goes for all other aspects of the game. Named exotics and legendaries certainly deserve pages, and I'm sure there are people who'd like to see crafting recipe information, vistas, jumping puzzles (actually the jumping puzzle section is solid so far, but the ""solutions"" for some could use work), karma vendors, skill points, whatever. Hell, this community has ~78k subscribers, if even 5% of us added just one piece of information it could easily have it be the go-to source for information in no time at all.

And nothing against these people who've created their own sites for armors/dyes/weapons/etc, it's great that they put the work in to try to offer something to the community.

Execution doesn't make sense.",1194,315,521,http://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/10idoe/gw2_endgame_model_is_fine_execution_doesnt_make/,"I posted this on the official forums, but still, I think it's worth a shot posting here to gather some attention, seeing I think this is the main issue with GW2 right now.

As it follows:

&gt;   .

**1- About me**

First off, let me introduce myself, I’m on my late 20s, I have a full time (and more) job, I have a personal relationship and I don’t neglect sports or my family.

Why the hell am I saying this? 

Because it limits my playing time. A lot.

I know this because I was once single, didn’t do outside activities, was unemployed/student and didn’t care for family much. And that simply leaves a lot more time to gaming. (I miss that a bit sometimes :)


Which well, can change by a large margin your gaming experience. 

Less time = Can’t spend much time grinding or farming otherwise there’s no time for the “fun” stuff. You burn yourself out.

If the game requires grinding or farming, it becomes a dull choir to people with little time..
Yet, with all those “impairments” I dedicate a huge ammount of time to GW2, hours a day even. And I must say I quite love this game.

**2 – Endgame**

I’ve played WoW on my more-than-free-time life and I was never into Raiding, even having the time, I just find it boring. So I’m quite glad that this is not the endgame model of GW2.
I like the idea that the endgame of GW2 is just.. playing this beautiful world, doing events, dungeons, because, well, it’s all really fun.

But the execution is poor.

**2a) Making farming more difficult is not getting rid of it**

ArenaNet several times took action that clearly intended farming to make farming more difficult, this doesn’t solve the problem, it simply puts the bar higher. Meaning the collective inteligence of the community will not stop farming. It will simply make the threshold to keep economically relevant (because of the global TP) higher. People will spend X + Y time farming or getting arround farming impairments, instead of X. People who only have X -1 time to give to farming and/or playing will be sub-par and will be irrelevant economically having trouble to enjoy several parts of the game.

This logic can be applied to Dungeons Tokens, Rare Drops, Farm Diminishg Returns… anything.
It is a bit effective on stopping inflation because you ostricize a part of the playerbase from the economy. You deal with the sympthom not the disease.

**2b) The Downlevel System is not being well-used.**

You got people farming DE in Orr. Why? Because it is fast, it’s efficient.

And also, it’s quite dull after 20 minutes.

Orr is a tiny, tiny map, with only one flavour: Undeadness.

I can’t believe ArenaNet came to conclusion that the best game drops for 80s would be concentrated on such a little area while GW2 is a huge and beautiful world.

Day before yesterday: I got my level 80 and went to explore Metrica Province with my lowbie friends (I want 100% completition and I enjoy playing the game all over)
We played for about 4 hours together, it was a blast.

DEs, Hearts, Jumping Puzzle

We were on mumble, we had fun.

I netted: 10 silver.

Yesterday I played 40 minutes in Orr. Waypointed there, it costed me 3+s (well, 7s netted the night before if you think about this WP cost).

I did about 5 DE, gathered, killed mobs. In 40 minutes I was bored out of my mind and quit the game

I netted: 1,5g (thanks to a rare salvage that dropped 3 ectos, unusual, but still…)
I am not fully exotic yet and I wanna be, and the only way to do it efficiently would be farm in Orr for days/couple of weeks or in the rest of the world for months.

I have not the will in me to farm in Orr for more than 2 hours on 2 days, I’m sorry, it’s really, really dull. 

Yet, lingering my progress because I’m being “punished” by playing the other (much-more-fun) parts of the game makes me cringe.

**3 – Solutions?**

**3a) World drops normalized for 80s**

Why do I have to farm Orr if I want level 80 blue green and yellow drops? 

For a level 80 the Orr drop should be the whole world drop.

This would spread people arround, make the whole world relevant to everybody.

And I don’t mean “give a high chance to as-good-as-orr-drops in the world”. I mean the same, otherwise people will logically gather in Orr to maximize effectiviness still.

This would also spread the income to less farm-minded people, making the economy a bit more socialized.

Use your own beautiful world ArenaNet. Make us use it efficiently.

**3b) Cosmetic Threadmill**

GW2 HAS a gear threadmill, and it’s quite short. you take some time to go full exotic, (I’m not still, and not with the best exotics, still, quite power-relevant) and it’s quite nice, it’s not too long, yet not so irrelevant, you have to work for it. 

I have no problem how it is.

But the tokens grind, and karma and legendary is just outright insane. Either you can obtain cosmetic items easily or they are a inhuman task.

Making people ignore the cosmetic run of the game or simply go all-in.
The idea would be to make some Cosmetic Threadmill, 

How about something between Exotic and Legendary?

Hor about Legendary Tiers?

Make it all cosmetic and nobody will complain it makes the game unfair, it will only let some less time-privileged people join that aspect of the game. Making it more vivid.

Think about it, if the Tier 5 Legendary used a huge quantity of material also used for T1 
Legendary it could make some fun market dynamic wouldn’t it?

I think ANet is already with this mindset tho, making dungeon tokens a bit more accessible. So, that’s a good sign. Dungeons Sets are becoming a mid-tier cosmetic goal. Good.

**TL;DR**

World Drop needs to mach Orr efficiency

Cosmetic Items are either easy or irrelevant. Need more steps in that threadmill.

Well, that’s it, I hope I was concise enough to grab some attention.

And I’m sorry but english is not my first language, so… sorry about any miss steak.

Cheers.

The diving board one still works due to it not having a physical node to interact with. Maybe they're fixing them so they're account bound, maybe they're removing them. Either way, sorry to any newcomers, there's less bags in the world now! As for outside LA, I'll log in later and check and update this post accordingly!**


Big thanks to etayn for this map **she** (sorry!) created of ToT bag points and pumpkins in LA!

So, many of you will have finished Act I by now and will probably be waiting for the next one to use your Candy Corn Powered detector again. Well, did you know that it discovers other little hidden spots too? Take, for instance, the diving board in Lions Arch. If you walk onto it and use the Aqueous field scan (number 1) an interaction glimmer will appear off the edge. Interacting with this creates a tunnel of fire rings, which if jumped through rewards the jumper with 5 Personalized ToT bags. Has anyone discovered any other similar secrets?  
  
**Found and confirmed so far (I do not attest to being able to draw arrows, but image links are at the end of each tip!)**  
  
- Diving Board at LA, use Aqueous Field Scan (Number 1) and interact with shiny to create Fire Rings^TM . Jump through these quickly and earn 5 ToT bags. Repeatable every few hours. [link](http://i.imgur.com/PetCl.jpg)  
  
- Old LA, just east of the diving board are the lion statues underwater. Use Corporeal Field Scan (Number 4) and interact with left lions nose, then right lions nose 4 times for 4 bags. [link](http://i.imgur.com/72rmN.jpg)  
  
- Old LA, fountainy looking structure (like a big tube), just south of docks. Use Aqueous field Scan (Number 1) and interact with shinies on top of water jets. Avoid excited quaggan. Earns 4 ToT bags. [link](http://i.imgur.com/xULtE.jpg)  
  
- Sewers in LA, entrance is by the pool of water just south the Guild Bank symbol on the map. Run round the corner and stand at the T junction and use Gaseous Field Scan (Number 2). Interact with shiny that appears and a shade will run from right to left, dropping 3 shinies spaced out. Earns 1 bag per shiny. [link](http://i.imgur.com/2dQtj.jpg)  
  
- Queensdale Cemetery, east of word ""Shaemoor"" on the map. Two angels at entrance to graveyard, climb hedge and stand on left angel's hand. Use Etheric Field Scan (Number 3) and interact with left hand, then jump across to right angel and interact with shiny hand there to earn 4 ToT bags. [link](http://i.imgur.com/nqvwH.jpg)  
  
- Queensdale Cemetery again, by the angel with pot in her hand at the back right of the cemetery. Use Corporeal Field Scan (Number 4) to create a sparkly in the flowers. Interaction with this creates a group of 4 skeletons, some of which may have ToT bags. Thanks to wraid for the info and Tomehina of [STAG] for confirmation of this. [link](http://i.imgur.com/1GAPq.jpg)  
  
- Queensdale Cemetery again again, in front of the last row of tombs at the back of the cemetery, using Corporeal Field Scan (Number 4) creates a shiny which, upon interaction, spawns 4 more skeletons to fight, who may or may not have ToT bags on them. Credit goes to whyitisfunny for the tip and Tomehina of [STAG] for confirmation. [link](http://i.imgur.com/n7Ri9.jpg)  
  
- Queensdale Cemetery again again again, by the angel with the pot again. If you jump onto the fence behind the tombs on the right (careful, it's quite a drop!), then onto the bush and onto the tomb tops and saunter on over to the tomb with the flowers in front of it from the last tip and use Aqueous Field Scan (Number 1) a shiny will appear just off the front of the roof. Using this will cause the angel to shoot out water and a point to collect 4 more ToT bags. Congratulations, you just desecrated some tombs for candy! Many thanks to Sacred Scriptures of Sea of Sorrows for this tip. [link](http://i.imgur.com/mGWfK.jpg)  
  
- Kessex Hills Graveyard, Blackroot Cut. Jump onto the roof of the hut using the skulls on the spikes, and use Gaseous Field Scan (Number 2). A shiny will appear off the front of the hut, activating this will create a shiny on the cliff wall behind the hut. Jump to it and interact 4 times to receive 4 ToT bags. Thanks to Buinovsky for this one. [link](http://i.imgur.com/AbAcX.jpg)  
  
- Kessex Hills Graveyard, Blackroot Cut again. The crypt at the back, when Aqueous Field Scan (Number 1) is used, has a shiny on the back wall. Activation of this shiny causes candy golems to rush at you from the beach, be ready! Thanks to koorashi for this one! [link](http://i.imgur.com/0c4yL.jpg)  
  
- Gendarran Fields, Provernic Crypt. Just after the flame traps upon entry there's a row of coffins at the back. Each set of 4 has a spot near it, unveiled with Corporeal Field Scan (Number 4). The left hand set spawns 4 skeletons, and the right hand set rewards you with 4 points which give a ToT bag each! Thanks to koorashi and seriousscrub for this tip!  
  
Many Thanks to Dukko and Syrion_Wraith for their help so far, and everyone else who has suggested spots. I will be checking and confirming any others throughout the day and editing the list when confirmed! Thank you all :)

1348440491.0,872,self.Guildwars2,10d2fp,Crafting level 1-80 FULL GUIDE 30g Total Cost full mat list inside separated by craft.,1111,239,166,http://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/10d2fp/crafting_level_180_full_guide_30g_total_cost_full/,"So today I decided I was going to level a new char 1-80 through crafting.   I suggest crafting in Rata Sum as it's very central to the trade post.  The tabs are the order in which I did my crafting.  Not all crafts go to 400.  A couple stop at 350 and some at 375.  I only finish the 375-400 tier if it's cheap to do so.  I.e. the cost per craft is ~6-7s or less.  I.e. Jewelcrafting 375-400 IS NOT worth it at all.
This guide will tell you everything that you need to purchase from the trade broker in order to get to level 80.  Broken down per craft.  For every single craft I focused on upgrade components.  Sigils and Runes are the cheapest route for nearly all crafts.  Jewelcrafting obviously doesn't apply, and for Artificing potions are the cheapest route.  I will post links to those guides below as well.

http://www.gw2db.com to look up what mats for each upgrade component to make for each craft.  If I don't post a guide know that I use upgrade components other than for each tier.  Make sure you are either vendoring or selling items back on the TP when you are done.  You can recover up to 3g from some crafts.

Full time 1-80 is less than 8 hours.

[Here is the link to the Google Docs survey.](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/viewform?formkey=dGxsZ2VJeVZMNVNfeHJCa3d4ZzhiblE6MQ#gid=0)

I created a brief survey (only 2 questions required, with a total of 6 questions) asking about Race/Profession, activities, hours played, age range, and gender.

Your participation would be appreciated.

**EDIT:** **Great response so far! Thanks everyone! I want to wait to share results so that people who are at work/school, live in other parts of the world where they are sleeping, etc have a chance to respond.**


*I want to do another survey after the next BWE.* Suggestions for new and/or improved questions? So far I have:

* Spell theif correctly. ;)
* Correct the wording on the ""did the BWE change your mind"" question to make it a stronger item. Did your opinion change from first to second BWE? Were you undecided previously but now solidified in your choice? Were/are you on the fence or 'almost' changed your mind?
* Add a question about location (North America, Europe, Australia, etc.)
* Add more diverse ranges for hours played on the higher end.
* Assuming the game will have updates/fixes, questions on feelings regarding changes in mechanics, comparing first BWE to second.
* Make sure there are 'No Opinion' and/or 'N/A' responses for appropriate items.
* What did you play in the BWEs? Did you play your main profession or did you avoid it? SOme players voiced that they avoided their intended mains completely. 
* Consider making the professions question with check boxes or make separate questions for mains and alts.
* Allow 'Other' and/or 'Neither' options for gender expression.
* Do you intend to play at release?
*  ""Which profession did you intend to be your main before the BWE"" and then a ""Which profession do think it will be now?"" - KingHavana


Any other suggestions?


**EDIT 2 (4:26PM EDT):** 1000 responses collected and counting! [Here is a tease!](http://i.imgur.com/IsKTQ.png) I need to do some school work so I have to stop watching the form fill up. I'll be back in a couple of hours. Post suggestions for a more in depth poll for after the second BWE!

**EDIT 3 (7:34PM EDT):** 3657 responses, updated the suggestions based on your comments. Regarding only being able to choose one Profession/Race option it does read as ""main"" so I intended to see what everyone's first choice is. Going to fix those options for the next survey.

**EDIT 4 (12:40AM EDT, May 1st):** 5548 responses and growing. I'm going to sleep and will make an update tomorrow morning. Thanks for all of your input today! [MIDNIGHT TEASER!](http://i.imgur.com/wlONI.png)

The other two went sprinting off, so I followed one.

Now, in most games, the kids would probably have just faded out a few feet away, or the scene wouldn't have happened at all.

But in GW2... I followed the Charr cub off quite some distance away, and he hid behind a tree, complete with a hiding type animation (/scared, I think?)... and QUITE a while later the seeker came running around looking.

I didn't get past the first zone with any race - queensdale, metrica province, etc.

Anyway, I know the chances of arenanet reading this is slim, but, I'll put my plea out there:

Please, keep the game difficult.

I'm not sure what you changed between BWE2 and BWE3. A change to AI, behavior or just a flat out nerf, but... BWE3 just straight up felt *easier*. I didn't have to dodge as much, I wasn't taking as much damage, it just felt like the monsters were nerfed too much. My sentiments seemed to be echoed on the official forums too. People were making topics about the game being too easy.

I know arenanet said they want to ""ease"" people into the game, but, I think they went *too* far in the easy direction, personally. Even if its a level 4-5 monster, the game should be challenging. I'm not expecting nail-biting, dark souls-esque hard here, but hard enough that it forces you to pay attention to dodge. People won't learn if you make it easy. They'll expect the same ease and then when they get their faces stomped into the dirt? They won't learn. They'll just whine and post on the forums about how hard the game is.

Remember the official forums when BWE1/2 were going on? There were clamors of posts about how the game was too difficult. This was by people who hadn't spent more then a few hours with the game and thus, weren't that good and instead of learning, they wanted to content nerfed.

Did anyone else have this experience with BWE3? Did anyone who got past the initial starter areas feel like the content was nerfed?

I hope they look to the balance/scaling again and make the starting areas harder. I know arenanet wants to make the increase gradual, but, it doesn't need to be THAT easy.

EDIT: Well, I made this post, went to bed and didn't expect this much response. Huh. Anyway, I'll further clarify my point since people seem to misunderstand me as an ""elitist"".

What I want for the difficulty to be is a *gradual* curve. People have said the game feels easy from 1-20 and then ramps up suddenly. That's not good. That's bad for the new players ANet wants to attract and easy into the game. As I said before I added in this edit, the game shouldn't be nail-biting hard (even if I'd love that), but, it should still challenge you. What I'd like to see, personally, is this:

Level 2-3: Monsters are very basic. They attack you, etc. They don't do much more then you'd expect from AI.

Level 4-5: Monsters start using dodge often to force you to move. Ranged monsters should start to be introduced that force people to move and not simply sit there and hit buttons.

Level 6-7: Monsters should start hitting harder. They should start introducing boons/conditions, etc.

I want a curve like that. One that introduces new concepts and makes the player learn while they play, but nothing that'll make the game frustrating. By the teens, people should be expected to dodge or take an enormous hit. By the time the player exits the first starting area and goes into the level 20+ zones? They should know how to dodge, how to use their skills appropriately, etc. Leaving the first area easy is fine. I'm OK with that. Leaving it easy enough that it doesn't teach newer players anything about the mechanics of the game? I'm not.

I'm confident ANet can find a balance between challenging, but not *too* hard on new players.",,False,self,t5_2r9po,1343255588.0,,HumanE,True,t3_x4gja,http://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/x4gja/arenanet_please_keep_the_game_difficult/,

How do you HOLD ALL THE THINGS !!! Well read this.

**Storing stuff**

**1. Make Alts.**

 You have 5 character slots to begin with. Even if you have no intention of playing mroe than 1 or 2 characters (the hells wrong with you...), make a few more characters and get them through their tutorial mission. No take these character straight to their home town and park them by the Bank.

 You can now use them as mules. Have them take stuff from your shared account bank and store it in their bags. If you give all your alts cheap 8 slot bags you can easily double and triple you available inventory storage. I actually purchased 3 more character slots and this was one of my primary motivations. 

**2. Create a guild.**

 If you only play solo this probably isn't an option. BUT, if you have just one other person to do hearts and events with you will be able to earn influence fast enough to purchase a guild bank for yourself. If I remember it took about 2500 influence to get the first tier 50 slot guild bank. 

 You need another person or two helping because alone you only get like 10 influence for completeing an event. But if you are together with a guildmate you will earn closer to 100. It increases exponentially.

 It took me and a buddy a couple weeks to get our bank. And we didn't even play together very often.

*NOTE: Around level 60 you are given a Tome of Influence. This gives whatever guild you are currently representing 400 influence. Then again, at the final Personal Story Level 80 quest you are given another Tome of Influence that gives 1,000 influence.*

**3. Use the TP.**

 If you remember from Part 1, when you place an item on the TP it will incur a 5% fee based ont he selling price you choose. What most people don't realise is that you can place an item on the TP with one character, leave it up there for as long as you want (auction don't expire), and then pull that item off with ANY of your other characters. 

 The TP is basically a giant account wide shared bank....for a fee. 

 The most common response I get to this is ""but what if someone buys you item"". Don't put your items on the TP at a competitive price. List the items for a few copper/silver higher than the lowest selling price. IF by some fluke your item does get sold, at least it was for a nice profit. 

**4. Get bigger bags.**

 I still see people who have actually filled their bag slots with 4 slotters from the vendor. Don't be that guy. Check the trading post for cheap 8 slot leather bags or give someone the materials. When you get a bit more money you can purchase 15 slotters for a pretty reasonable 50 silver + leather. I would stick to leather bags as the other types of mats cost more.

Half the time I find it just quicker risking the chance of dying going to the end of a quest/POI/Waypoint than to actually fight the content itself. 

This tiresome spawn rate is more noticeable being 65+.

Me and a thief I run into pull the guards away from the veteran without aggroing him only for the guards to spawn IN THE MIDDLE of the fight with the veteran.

This post I will focus on PvE and Dungeon tips.

**1. Build types.**

 The most common build you see is the glass cannon. This applies to pretty much any class in the game. Most people like to start with Power at low levels, then move on to Power/Precision when the gear allows 2 stats, and finally move onto Power/Precision/Condition Damage when the gear allows 3 stats at higher levels. 

 This build is fine for fighting mobs out in the world and grinding hearts or dynamic events. It is even viable in most Story Mode dungeons (aside from maybe Ascalon Catacombs).

 The thing is, it just isn't necessary and is fairly limiting in what you can do. You just will not be able to handle Explorable Mode in dungeons reliably. Yet even without a single gear stat in damage or crit you will still do plenty of damage.

 If you want to try out Explorable Mode dungeons and get the rare gear skins form those, I would highly encourage you to try a different set of gear stats and trait builds. A good option would be to get all Power/vit gear if you are mid level. If you are 80 then try a set of Power/Toughness/Healing gear. Set your traits to something other than 30/30 Power/Precicion.

 I guarantee your dungeon and probably PvP experience will be better and you won't even notice a difference in PvE.

 As an experiment I started a Guardian alt. Gave him nothing but Vit/toughness gear and vit/toughness traitlines. He can still murder PvE content easily and can run dungeons like a boss. I was actually able to 3 man the first boss in Caducus Manor last night due to my characters insane health/toughness/regen. It allowed me to always stay up while my other two teammates died repeatedly. Fight did take like 10 minutes though but was still awesome. 

 My main Warr is using a full MF set but as soon as I have the mats I will be making a 4/6 set of Power/Vit/Tough and 2/6 set of Pow/Tough/Healing. My weapons will also have Pow/Tough/Healing. Warriors have a much higher hp/armor/toughness then guardians. And when speced properly can CC like a boss. I expect I will be stomping Explorable Mode dungeons on her soon.

*NOTE: The Pow/Vit/Tough gear can be acquired for karma from Melandrus Temple in Cursed shore. Also apparently from Vigil armor and WvW vendors. I had to go with 4/6 because, at least at Melandrus temple, The Boots and Helm did not have the Pow/Vit/Tough stat combo.*


**2. Dungeons.**

 The first dungeon in GW2 is Ascalon Catacombs and it is hard. Really hard. So hard that it may actually turn you off of dungeons in general. It sure did for me. After beating AC a few times and dying a lot more I decided dungeons just weren't for me and proceeded to level all the way to 80 without stepping foot in another one. 

 I was wrong though. Dungeons are awesome...after Ascalon. The later dungeons are far more manageable in Story Mode. Even glass cannons can do fine in them. Plus you get to see a part of the story that just doesn't come up in the Personal Storyline.

 Now what are some things you can do to not die in dungeons?

**A.** Have gear your level. Sound simple right, but so many people hit level 30 still wearing level 14-20 gear and think....hey let's go try the first dungeon......and they're dead. If you follow my TP tips you will be able to have a full set of level 30 gear and do fine. 

**B.** Have a ranged option. I don't care what class you are. The majority of fights just are not safe for melee unless you have some very stout stats and gear. Stay at range and kite ALL THE THINGS. This goes for trash mob pulls as well as bosses. 

**C.** REVIVE your downed party members. You can safely ignore anyone that is dead, but if you stay on top of the downed members they shouldn't die in the first place unless something really bad happens. Honestly I should have put this as the first rule of dungeon running, it's that important.

**D.** If you are DEAD (not downed) rez and run back. Don't expect people to revive you. It takes a loooong time to ressurect someone who has died.

*There is a lot more to say on this I am sure but that's a start. I think Part 4 will be on how to acquire your first few sets of level 80 gear to get started with Karma farming and dungeon running.*

I couldn't describe the joy I was feeling - after such a long time there was *finally* some hope on the horizon. 

I remember the time when you could first sign up for beta. People went crazy, over 1 million signups. That monday we could finally watch the first real ingame videos from the pressbeta. The moment pre-purchase started, the moment we finally got to play the game ourselves, and, above all, the day the release date was announced. 

Checking this subreddit almost every day really helped me stay on track. I would really like to thank this community for posting every possible information they could find, for insightful discussions and awesome comments. You guys have really made the wait enjoyable. And of course, a big thank you to ArenaNet for making such an awesome game.

I can barely believe how fast time went by and that we are *actually* only one day before headstart. It feels like the end of an era. It has really been a pleasant ride. I will surely be actively reading this subreddit post-launch but I somehow think it won't be the same as before. 

Anyway I hope someone actually gets to read this and maybe even feels the same. 
I know I suck at these kind of texts but this time I really wanted to get this out. Feels weird to me. But yeah, I guess all I'm trying to say is thank you all and have a happy launch day tomorrow.

To make things more challenging and fun, I've forbidden myself to look up anything in the wiki. I was having a blast, but I didn't realize how much cooking had consumed me. Until saturday night.

I was with some guildies in Vent, roaming around in [](#s ""Gendarran Fields"") when I found the vendor who sells celery. A conversation occurred that went something like this:

Me: ""OMG! *This* is the guy who sells celery! *Finally*!""

Me: ""What?""

Guild: ""It's... it's celery, but you're acting like you found an epic rare weapon or killed a dragon or something.""

Me: ""No, you don't understand. A lot of soups use vegetable stock or staple soup vegetables as base ingredients, and both of those things require celery.

Really. Every time I find a new ingredient, endorphins fire off like crazy.

Also, when you're choosing your reward at the end of a mission, remember that you can right click and preview to see each item.

In project management, there is no such thing as a ""Simple Fix""--any change, no matter how insignificant, has to go through a laborious series of meetings, requirement sessions, design sessions, build, unit tests, QA tests, UAT tests, and signoff sessions to hit Production. That doesn't even mention all the documentation, or the constraints, dependencies, and schedules that keep them from starting each phase!

This is just a fact of life in a large company; sure, when you're dealing with a small game with a single developer, he might be able to just flip a switch and post an update (Notch, for example, in the old Minecraft days). But when you have a massive game like GW2 and every feature and bit of code can have a cross impact on every other feature, it is a lot more complicated than some folks are allowing for. Even Mojang, which has a fairly small team developing Minecraft, puts out releases much more slowly than Notch did when he was working by himself--but the quality is way, way higher.

**In my experience, if your sentence begins with ""Why don't they just do X""; you're oversimplifying the problem.**

So props to ArenaNet for deploying the fixes, changes, and enhancements the community has clamored for, all while creating brand new content. You guys are doing an awesome job and deserve commendation!

1346451474.0,774,self.Guildwars2,z5pq4,"Guild Wars 2 status - Friday, August 31",1107,333,862,http://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/z5pq4/guild_wars_2_status_friday_august_31/,"This is the current status of the most important issues we're tracking with *Guild Wars 2* live service.

This status information is also available on the [*Guild Wars 2* wiki](http://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Game_status_updates). Check there for the most recent information.

**Account security** - Protect your account! We've seen hackers systematically scan email addresses and passwords harvested from other games, web sites, and trojans to see if they match *Guild Wars 2* accounts. We've taken steps to protect our players from this, but we need your help too. Make sure that you use a strong, unique password for *Guild Wars 2* that you've never used anywhere else. For best security, use a unique email address too, and see our [blog post](https://www.guildwars2.com/en/news/tips-for-keeping-your-guild-wars-2-account-secure/) for more tips.

**Email authentication** - We now have email authentication enabled for all players who have validated their email addresses. This feature sends an email whenever it detects a login attempt to your account from a location you haven't played from before, asking you to allow or deny the login.

We've learned of an incompatibility between email authentication and older versions of Internet Explorer. We're working on a fix, which we expect to deploy tomorrow.

If you're not receiving account verification emails or account authentication emails, please check your junk/spam folders, and add noreply@guildwars2.com to your safe senders list.

**Parties, guilds, etc.** - We've made significant fixes to parties and guilds. However, you may still see intermittent outages. These outages cause symptoms such as party members not appearing on the map, party members not staying in the same overflow servers as they travel between maps, and guild invites not working.

**Trading Post** - Yesterday we opened the Trading Post for a random, rotating 50% of users. After gathering data from yesterday's tests, we applied a number of fixes and performance improvements, and are preparing a larger-scale test today.

**Tournament Rewards** - We believe we've addressed the problem with tournament chests not appearing. Let us know if you still see any issues with this.

**World v. World** - We're aware the world v. world matches have not been resetting properly. We're preparing an update to fix this. Once the issue is fixed, we'll start running 24-hour matches to balance servers.

**Worlds** - We added three new worlds in Europe yesterday, three new worlds in America today, and increased the population limits on all worlds.

**Overflow** - During this initial surge of high concurrency, and especially while most characters are low-level and thus playing in the same starting areas, it's common for players to be directed to overflow servers. If you want to play with a friend, but you're not on the same overflow servers, you can form a party together, then right-click on your friend's portrait in the party list and click ""join"".

We expect the use of overflow servers to naturally subside as players spread out more through the world.

**Botting** - We suspended accounts of 750 players running bots. We're ramping up and will soon apply permanent bans for cases of substantial botting.

**Exploits** - If you discover an exploit in the game, do not exploit it or publicize it, but instead please notify us immediately at this new email address: exploits (at) arena (dot) net.

**Forums** - Our most important priority at the moment is to ensure that the game runs stably and flawlessly. So as to not create additional demand on our infrastructure and on our programming team, we made the decision not to open the forums until the initial mass influx of players has calmed down a bit.

**Wiki** - We increased wiki server capacity to address issues users are seeing. We plan to start posting these updates to the wiki, as long as the wiki can handle the traffic.

**Next software updates** - We're making non-disruptive changes throughout the day. We'll publish the next back-end server update tonight at midnight Seattle time. The game may be unavailable for approximately 20-60 minutes while we perform this update.

But these huge hubs go totally wasted and are deserted by the almost every player outside story quests. 
 So my question is why? 
Lions Arch has become the social hub of GW2 and this is fine, basically because of the free TP (via PVP portal). But why are the dev's happy to see all this work go totally ignored? 
 Surely there is something that could be done, to see this content used more often? 
 
 A few idea's to increase the usage of these cities? 
- Racial skill: Travel to your home city (30 min cool down) 
- Level 80 dynamic events: Invasions, Dragon attacks, rebellions etc 
- Minor boosts (+crafting, +exp gain, +health etc) Based on time spent in home city. 
- Mystic Forge's in each city.

 Does anyone have any ideas to help bring people back to these forgotten places? Or does nothing need changed?

1353331885.0,758,self.Guildwars2,13g6q2,Arenanet should pay attention to how Trion runs world events ,1060,302,310,http://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/13g6q2/arenanet_should_pay_attention_to_how_trion_runs/,"I was fortunate -- I only crashed out once, and somehow found a way to clear enough of my afternoon to see the event all the way through to the end chest. The rewards, ultimately, were worth it for me -- a 20 slot bag, an exotic trinket (and upgrade for me, but not for everyone), 2 exotics (lvl 78 luckily for me, worth $), and 2 yellows. 

However, I think there's TONS of opportunity for improvement. Ultimately Blizzard moved away from world events because they lacked the confidence they could do them properly, but Trion has been refining their model in Rift and I think they're the industry best at these sorts of things. Arenanet should emulate alot of what Trion has learned over the last 2 years.

Recommendations:

- Time limited events create a sense of urgency, but having a singular set time is cruel to players and ultimately makes it harder to balance the experience. Better to have a window (say, 2 days) of time, with repeating events every 3 or 6 hours... you distribute your audience, and respect their personal lives.

- The game needs a mechanic to claim rewards if you've disconnected, can't complete, or have a system crash. Make it threshold based, and maybe make it tied to only special events, but people who did 2 hours of contributions and never got their chests? That's just wrong.

- The quality of the event was poor IMHO. It was a giant zerg for 2+ hours, and got pretty boring. Take a look to how Trion runs major invasion events (particularly ember isle). Multiple areas of focus simultaneously (both defensive and offensive), and failure in one area doesn't mean you lose ... it just makes the other areas harder to succeed. Give players a chance to understand what's happening, and react and respond to threats at a strategic level.

- Expectation management. We need to know what's expected beforehand. For future events, people are not going to jump in early like this time...why bother doing the first hour (or two) of grinding, when all you need to do is show up for the last 20 mins to get your chest rewards? Tell us ""its a 2 hour commitment"" and players will be much more receptive. 

I have great confidence in Areanent, and beleive they can learn and tune these events better in the future. I think the Halloween event was a much better example of what they can do -- a pity the free trial weekend didn't hit during Halloween! But I think a large portion of their players will tune out of future events unless they improve future time-limited activities.


EDIT: Wow, this thread took off much more than I thought it would. I hope everyone appreciates the fact that my intent was to offer constructive criticism, as GW2 is early in its life and I think has great potential to get even better. I couldn't help but notice the similarities to Trion's Rift and its early months. As has been pointed out, Rift's River of Souls world event was a pretty big mess too... but they learned and each subsequent event has gotten better over time. I have faith the same will be the case with Arenanet.  PS -- WTB time creation device, I am spoiled with GW2 *and* Rift's Storm Legion expansion within 3 months of each other.

High level players have a massive incentive not to go back to low level areas because of the weakness in rewards compared to the costs in travel. This disproportionately hurts completionists and players who want to play low level content with low level friends. I would suggest changing the teleport cost function to include the destination's difficulty level and distance, rather than the player's level and distance.

Although this game is brilliant, amazing, awesome and just everything, there is one thing that any good game needs, and that is players. 


Now over the last few days, a select few people have been whining over small things like the down time the game had during the stress test or the fact their account got banned for no reason or whatever this is just a small small percentage of players and the majority of this community is amazing, really nice and helpful.


Now finally, to my point, I am a heavy trader, so when I heard the trading post was down, I was a little bit disheartened, but that didn't stop me. I just started doing small trades through mail. Nothing serious so that I didn't lose anything if the other player decided to scam. I started going bigger doing trades with around 40s and every time I sent first they delivered, and sometimes they managed to send to me straight away. I then started experimenting, I sent 30s to random people, messaged them that I accidentally sent it to them and If they could return it. Every single one did. I then sent it back to them telling them It was a test for and they passed so I decided to send them the silver to keep.


But down to statistics
I made 35 trades via the mail system.
Every single one of those trades went down well.
I gave 8 people 30s, and all those people gave the silver back.

This, to me, is absolutely amazing. You literally have people complaining about how they can't do a menial, brainless task over and over again without being penalized for it. They actually complain about the game trying to nudge them towards maybe, just maybe, doing something different or at least changing scenery.

**Update:  It seems like the recipes with scrolls are exotic weapons or armors.  This means you can get an exotic weapon for 50 skill points, mystic coins, and some mats.  We should figure out what exotic weapons each recipe gets so people can get the exotic they want.**

**Also, probably some of these recipes are for legendary weapons precursors, and we should find out which ones they are.**

**Update 2:  I think the higher the Mystic Coin number in the recipe, the harder the item is to get and the rarer it is.  So the legendary precursors might be one of the recipes with a scroll and a higher number of coins**

I'm pretty sure a lot of people have figured out Mystic Forge recipes, but are just hording the information to make profit, so I'm trying to share what I know and aggregate info from the community.

**Quick primer on the Mystic Forge**

The Mystic Forge does 2 things:

* Random items when you combine 4 random items
* Set recipes that give you the same thing each time.  A lot of these are level 80 exotics weapons/armor.  I'm pretty sure each recipe with a scroll gives an 80 exotic.  We just have to figure out which recipes give what.

So I bought a lot of singletons of crafting materials so I could see what recipes the Mystic Forge has.  Here's what I found.  Here's a list of shorthand I use (Miyani is the NPC next to the Mystic forge)

* Wine = Elonian Wine - 25.6 silver from Miyani.
* Scroll = Eldritch Scroll - 50 skill points from Miyani
* Crystal - 5 for 3 skill points from Miyani
* C. Dust - Crystalline Dust
* Ecto - Glob of Ectoplasm - get it from salvaging level 80 rares with a master salvage kit
* When I refer to fine crafting materials like bones, I mean the tier 6 version (e.g. Ancient Bones).  Anything lower won't work, but you can transmute lower tiers up using philosopher stones.

**Common and Fine Material Promotion**

Check the wiki http://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Mystic_Forge.  This will tell you how to turn copper or into iron ore and large bones into ancient bones, for example.

**Lodestone**:

2 Core + 1 Crystal + 1 Wine + 1 C.Dust = Lodestone

For example, if you use two Molten Cores you will get one Molten Lodestones.  This is useful because I'm pretty sure some of the Lodestones, like Crystal Lodestone, don't even drop from enemies since there are no high-level branded enemies

**Upgrading Siege Weapons**:

5 mithril ore + 5 elder wood log + 2 siege weapons + siege masters guide = stronger siege weapon

**Mystic Weapon** (level 80 exotics with particle effect):

**DON'T TRY TO CRAFT THE RIFLE, MACE, OR SHIELD, APPARENTLY THOSE 3 DON'T WORK**

1 scroll + 30 coins + 5 component A + 5 component B

For example, to make a sword you use 5 orichalcum hilts and 5 orichalcum blades.  It only accepts level 80 components (so orichalcum components)

Some people are having trouble, so here's a more thorough explanation.  Go to http://www.gw2db.com/ and then go to recipes for the craft that makes the weapon you want.  Then click on one of the pearl weapons of the type you want (the affix doesn't matter, so Berserker's or Carrion or any of those is fine).  Now look at the ingredients of that recipe.  One will be an inscription, and the other two will be the components you want.

For example if you want a greatsword, you would look at http://www.gw2db.com/recipes/8487-berserkers-pearl-broadsword and see the components are Orichalcum Greatsword Blade and Orichalcum Greatsword Hilt.  So then the recipe you would use is

1 scroll + 30 coins + 5 ori greatsword blade + 5 ori greatsword hilt

and you would get Mystic Claymore

There are also probably recipes using the other lodestones, but I ran out of money and couldn't buy them to find out.  Let's work together as a community and chart this unexplored territory!  I'm pretty sure some of these recipes at least give you the exotic components for legendaries.

If the reddit community can band together and chart new territory, then I think that would be awesome!  To the best of my knowledge the results of these recipes isn't available publicly anywhere.

1353499494.0,744,self.Guildwars2,13k9mb,Skin Wardrobe and why adding it should be a high-priority,938,194,197,http://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/13k9mb/skin_wardrobe_and_why_adding_it_should_be_a/,"This is not as simple as you think. Yes, primarily, a skin wardrobe is a quality of life thing. But it can influence PvE a great deal in a way, you might not realize.

The following is how I see it implemented (this is just my vision, which can obviously be improved by smarter people than me)
__________

*Why it's needed:* Keeping armor/weapon skins in the bank is messy and very inconvenient. It's also impossible, due to space limitations, and a high price of buying new tabs. That's why we don't see anybody collecting armor skins extensively. Also, GW2 has **an appearence-based progression**. As in skins. As in the end-game boils down to getting more skins. /nuff said
__________

*UI:* A new window, with 5 tabs: Light Armor, Medium Armor, Heavy Armor, Weapons and Costumes. In each tab should be a list of all of the available skins in game, corresponding to that tab. They should be organizable alphabetically by name, by type (chest, hands, axes, bows, etc.) and by set name (applicable only to armor and costumes tabs), and should be greyed out at first.

As a skin is added (unlocked) to your collection, it should be available to use by **any character on your account**. There should still be limitation on light classes not being able to wear heavy skins for example, but any class should be able to add any skin to their collection, so that their alt can use it.

The process of unlocking skins can be done in different ways. My proposition - use transmutation stones, as they are already in the game, and are currently not used at all. Make it cost a different amount of transmutation stones, depending on the rarity of the skin. And make the original item be destroyed as you add the skin, to prevent people buying items on TP to just get the skin and re-sell the item. Using the skin that you've already unlocked however should be **free and infinitely available for any character on your account**, as it's done with the HoM rewards. 
__________

*Good things this will do for A-NET bank account:* People will start buying transmutation stones, and using them up. Plus, all of the following directly profits Arena.
__________

*Good things this will do for players:* Provides **a new type of goal**, to collect all (or as many as possible) skins. You'll be amazed how many ppl are obsessive completionists, just eager for a new check-list to fill. It will also allow for people to change their appearance more easily and frequently, meaning a more visually pleasant and varied mass of players, instead of everybody wearing CoF armor.
__________

*Good things this will do for PvE:* Throw more people in **different** dungeons. Right now, everybody is running 1-2 most profitable/quick dungeons. This will urge people to collect tokens from different places, to get different and eventually all dungeon armor sets. This is especially important now, since with the introduction of Fractals, the normal dungeons are turning into ghost-towns (not that Ascalon). 

Also, it will create a new use for karma, as currently, people are just banking it in hopes to get legendary weapons one day. Now they can use it to buy skins for karma

You can even go a step further, and add **zone-specific skins** that can drop only from mobs in a certain zone (make it zone-specific instead of mob type-specific, so to prevent farming hot-spots). Those drops should be soulbound, so that people can't buy them on auction house, and should have a small (but not frustratingly so) drop rate. This will throw a huge wave of players to **all** of the zones of the game, if each of the zones has a unique-looking set that drops only in that zone. No more complains of the world being deserted.
__________

Show your support for this topic, so that we can get some attention to it from the devs. I honestly believe it can be a great benefit to the game.
[Official forum thread link](https://forum-en.guildwars2.com/forum/game/suggestions/Why-Skin-Wardrobe-should-be-a-high-priority/)
__________

**TL;DR**
Skin wardrobe is good. Convenient way of keeping and organizing unlocked skins. A new goal at endgame - collect all skins. More people will do unpopular dungeons, and other areas of the game, if they can unlock a new skin out of it. Unlocking the skin should destroy the item, but make the skin permanently available and free to any character on account.

__________
UPDATE 1: To many posts saying that this is a good idea, but should in no way be a priority, and to those down-voting because you rage that we're talking about Wardrobes, when your -insert class here- is completely broken in sPvP, or when you've just been PWN'D by an invisible mob in WWW - relax. It has been stated numerous times that ANet has different teams working on different parts of the game. Implementing this idea will not take away from them working on balance, bots, performance, etc.

UPDATE 2: Transmutation stones, and why I think you should use them once to unlock a skin for future infinite use, instead of per-use. This has very much to do with psychology. It doesn’t feel right paying for using something that you’ve worked for and got already. While paying to “unlock” something forever is usually perceived positively. If you're worried about ANet profits - just make it so the amount of transmutation stones it takes to save the skin depend on it’s rarity. From the top of my head - 100 transmutation stones for saving a Legendary skin.

UPDATE 3: Let me explain why I’m against character bound stuff. Just one reason – it restricts you from playing you alts. For example, if I ever get a legendary weapon on my main, I’d want to always run with it. Switching to my alt with a simple Berserker’s Greatsword of Awesomeness instead of Twilight would really suck. Instead of working towards getting the legendary on your alt, which you already got on the main, isn't it better (again, psychologically) to work towards getting a DIFFERENT legendary?",,False,self,t5_2r9po,1353519149.0,,Ranger,True,t3_13k9mb,http://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/13k9mb/skin_wardrobe_and_why_adding_it_should_be_a/,
1350020114.0,743,self.Guildwars2,11cqq0,Mystery of the Beautiful Pendant,899,156,281,http://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/11cqq0/mystery_of_the_beautiful_pendant/,"In Diessa Plateau, after a particular event, an NPC named Straya Doomslayer will offer an item named ""Beautiful Pendant"" at the price of twenty silver. The pendant has no attributes, save for an upgrade slot, and is of the ""rare"" item value despite being level twenty.
After poring through empty wiki pages and mildly relevant google entries, I discovered a quest from the original game, Guild Wars: Prophecies. That quest is titled ""A Gift for Althea.""


Long before the events of Guild Wars 2, Ascalon was ruled and inhabited largely by humans. Adelbern was king, and Rurik his son and prince. King Adelbern, however, was not king by birthright. He garnered public support for his claim through triumphs in the guild wars, and with that, ousted the rightful king, Duke Barradin. 


Many citizens of old Ascalon were distrustful of Barradin, doubting he would acquiesce his throne so easily. These matters came to a head when it was made known that Prince Rurik was betrothed to the daughter of Duke Barradin, Lady Althea. This engagement largely put the public suspicion of Barradin to rest, but not entirely. Rurik and Althea were to be wed soon, but as fate would have it, Ascalon saw the dawn of its final day. 


The Charr unleashed a powerful and ancient magic, a searing cauldron, destroying much of idyllic Ascalon, and acting a precursor to their invasion, and ultimately their (pyrrhic) victory over the humans. Two years after the searing, Lady Althea was captured by Charr raiders. After a desperate search attempt from her father, Duke Barradin, Lady Althea is found to be dead. Immolated as sacrifice by the Flame Legion shaman, the ruling caste of the Charr war machine. 


With the stage set, we arrive at the pendant. During the pre-searing days of old Ascalon, when grass grew and water hadn't yet been replaced by tar, the player is offered a quest to find materials suitable to create the perfect gift for the Prince's love, Lady Althea. You are tasked with finding three items: a beautiful pearl, a beautiful feather, and of course, a beautiful pendant. 

Could it be a mere coincidence that an item, found in Ascalon, very near to where Althea ultimately met her demise, with such a high cost, and such a strange lack of attributes exists? I should think not;
it must have a purpose. It is eligible to be placed in the mystic forge, yet to my knowledge there exist no ""beautiful feather"" or ""beautiful pearl."" The best clue I have found for the recipe is that the pendant is compatible with mystic forge stones. 


So I challenge you, fellow scholars, adventurers, and nefarious individuals: Join me in solving the mystery of the beautiful pendant. 

**Edit:** To those still interested, I've not given up the search, though I've been less vocal as I'm sure this thread will start fading shortly, and I've not found anything noteworthy yet. I'll update with any pertinent information I come across (if there is any). Continue your adventure, intrepid explorers!

**Edit Part Deux:** 
I've made a new and terrible discovery. In Diessa Plateau, near the heart quest NPC of Bloodcliff Quarry, there's an NPC named Lanar Steelbreaker. After completing an event at the quarry to drive Dredge away, Lanar offered to sell me items: 100 steel mining picks, at the price of twenty silver.

This leads me to believe that perhaps there's a problem with the pricing table in this area, and that the twenty silver price of the pendant is not related to anything in particular (though it always could be).

I shall carry on my quest, though. Namely that stuffed bear in the fields of ruin.

Also, for those who may be interested: In Diessa Plateau, at the Meatoberfest celebration heart vendor, you can buy a pimp chalice focus to wield in your off hand, complete with particle effect.

It is I, Trahearne, first born. By the pale tree, I never could have imagined the wondrous implications of such an overwhelming success in the battle against Zhaitan. Everywhere I go, I exist, and many have acknowledged this fact. Children utter my name in the streets, and mothers name these children after my legacy. I have yet to go a day without receiving fond word of my duties and triumphs as marshal. Of course, I did not achieve this alone, there were many who fought at my side courageously and loyally, and so it is this day which is hereby dedicated to them. The tale of my wyld hunt was full of excitement and intrigue, as many have mentioned in the previous months. Those of all creeds, backgrounds, and occupations, have gathered under a single banner, the banner that so strongly symbolizes all that is worth fighting for in the land of Tyria; The banner of Trahearne. For it was I who united  allies such as the vigil, fearless warriors of legendary prowess in battle. The shadowy group known only as the order of whispers, whom my dear friend Tyrone Cleftjaw once belonged. How he did enjoy indigenous fruits of various kinds.  In response to my achievements, and the consistent outpouring of support and praise I've received for my gripping narrative featured in the MMO of the year, Guild Wars 2, a new project has been set to commence immediately. You, Commander, will soon be able to unravel my tale like never before, both before and after my rise to fame and glory, with your help of course. (I'd much rather be home reading).

6/29/2013:  [Changes](http://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/1cjmri/new_player_guide_to_leveling_a_mesmer_the/caufbye)

## Intro

There are only two known ways in the universe to level a mesmer without wanting to hang yourself by your toenails by level 10.  

They're squishy at low levels moreso than most classes, don't kill as fast or feel as visceral (as, say, thieves or warriors) and hence harder to level, don't outgrow that till around 50-60, and don't actually get good till you're geared up in Exotics at 80.  

But at 80 they're truly magical, and one of the most fun and desired classes in the game (dungeons, FotM, sPvP, WvW), and well worth it if you can stick it out.  This is how to stick it out.

**First**, don't use a Level 80 build to level to 80.  That may work for some classes, but not for mesmers.  Many Mesmer level 80 builds (particularly Shatter builds) depend largely on Grandmaster traits you can't get till level 60 at the earliest, which defeats the point of a *leveling* build.  What you want is a leveling build that is effective with Adept and Master traits only.

**Second**, familiarize yourself with the class.  There is no better way to do this than watching Mr. Prometheus's Comprehensive Mesmer Guides [[1]](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7eZ0NNd7b60]), [[2]](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T-B3mkM7dqM), [[3]](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6s-m1Hs_M0), [[4]](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H70RjrLdeLs).  Also, familiarize yourself with [GW2's general combat mechanics](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B_zMPcT2jgc) if you're not already.

**Third**, there are two very effective Mesmer leveling builds that work brilliantly solo and well in small groups, that will let you do fun things like survive accidental overpulls and solo Veterans and even some Champions while leveling.  But they're not obvious or intuitive.  

The first, **Clone Cripple Bomb**, is based on applying AoE CC, conditions, and damage when clones are killed or overwritten and from Staff skills.  It is strong for solo'ing lots of trash mobs, handling accidental overpulls (especially useful in caves and enclosed areas with fast-spawning mobs and nowhere to run if you accidentally pull too many at once).  It is also very good at solo'ing Champion mobs (if you have the patience for epic 20-30m battles of attrition).

The second, **Illusion Army**, is based on buffing your illusions (particularly phantasms) health and damage and letting them fight for you.  It is strong in [WvW leveling](http://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/19575f/leveling_in_wvw/) or [Dynamic Event leveling](http://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/13vk5h/dynamic_event_chain_list/) where the zerg tends to kill faster than the Clone Bomb build can ramp up its damage.  It also has strong single-target direct damage so you don't have to worry about about the condition stack cap [[1]](http://www.guildwars2hub.com/features/editorials/guild-wars-2s-bleed-cap), [[2]](http://dulfy.net/2013/02/25/gw2-arenanet-looking-into-condition-caps/) on DE boss fights.

* 60:  Alternate:  [The Clone Spammer](https://forum-en.guildwars2.com/forum/professions/mesmer/condition-build-The-Clone-Spammer)

\* Forgot to include this in the build links, but use [Sigil of Bloodlust](http://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Sigil_of_bloodlust) in 2H weapons and Sigil of Bloodlust + [Sigil of Force](http://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Sigil_of_Force) in 1H weapons as you level. (Staff #1 does strong direct damage once you've built up Fury and a few stacks of Might).

**Playstyle**:  Keep as many clones up as possible, fill in the gaps with phantasms.  When clones are are killed by mobs or overwritten by other clones/phantasms, they explode and apply Cripple and another random condition to all nearby mobs.  Keep Cripple on the mobs as much as possible, and [kite them](http://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Aggro#Tanking) while Staff #1 autoattack + conditions kill them.

Stack conditions and boons with bouncing Staff #1 autoattack, #4 Chaos Armor, and #5 Chaos Storm.  Casting #2 Phase Retreat inside Chaos Storm is a [combo finisher](http://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Combo_finisher) that gives you a second Chaos Armor.

Don't Shatter - Shatter does *not* apply Cripple or the random condition.  Only shatter if you're about to die and need Distortion (F4) or Diversion (F3) to escape.

**Primary Weapon**:  Staff.  Most importantly, your Staff #1 autoattack will stack Fury and Might on you, and [Chaos Armor](http://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Chaos_Armor) and [Chaos Storm](http://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Chaos_Storm) will stack other random boons on you, increasing the damage of everything else you're doing.  Damage starts low, but ramps up quickly as boons stack on you (see that in action [at this point in Mr. Prometheus's guide video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T-B3mkM7dqM&amp;t=18m35s)).  

Counterintuitively, despite its 1200 range, Staff is a close-quarters weapon.  The closer you are to your target/s the faster the Staff #1 attack will bounce, so the faster the boons and conditions build on you and the target.  Between Staff #1, #4 Chaos Armor, and #5 Chaos Storm the range of defensive boons and conditions that go up make you nearly invincible - Aegis, Blind, Protection, Weakness, Regeneration, Confusion, Swiftness, Cripple, Poison, Chilled, Daze.

**Secondary Weapon**:  Secondary and any healing/utility/elite skills I didn't specify are up to you.  I usually went with Greatsword (GS) b/c its Phantasm does Cripple + more AoE damage, but Sword/Sword (lowest illusion cd of all options), Scepter (with its clone factory autoattack), Focus (runspeed), Pistol (strong ranged dps phantasm) are all interesting as well.  Torch gives you an instant stealth to get out of trouble, but its phantasm is the weakest of all phantasms mesmers have.

You can singlehandedly take out groups of mobs, handle accidental overpulls, and even solo non-ranged Champion mobs by Cripple-kiting them.

**Gear**:  Power or a mix of Power and Condition Damage.  Toughness for survival since mobs tend to do more direct damage than condition damage (ignores toughness).

**Weaknesses**:  The one thing this build is weak at, at any level, is in [zergs](http://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Zerg).  Like [big DE's](http://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Dynamic_event) or WvW zergs.  Things either die before you can ramp up your boons and damage, or the boss will quickly reach the  condition stack cap [[1]](http://www.guildwars2hub.com/features/editorials/guild-wars-2s-bleed-cap), [[2]](http://dulfy.net/2013/02/25/gw2-arenanet-looking-into-condition-caps/).

When someone applies a 26th stack of that condition, the oldest stack is removed to make way for the new one.  This happens so fast and frequently in a zerg that your conditions sometimes don't run their full duration before being replaced, hurting your dps.  

So just keep in mind if you want to [level via big DE's](http://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/13vk5h/dynamic_event_chain_list/) with zergs, and have a hard time tagging mobs and getting drops with this build, you may need a more direct-damage oriented build, similar to the next one below.  However, given that most players are now 80 and the lower pre-80 leveling zones are sparsely populated, a strong solo build is optimal. 

-----------

## **Illusion Army**

This leveling build is more direct-damage oriented and is based on taking all traits (and signet) that buff illusions' health and damage and letting them fight for you.

In a nutshell, select Adept and Master traits that either 1) reduce illusion spawn cooldown, 2) buff illusion survivability (health), or 3) buff illusion damage.  

Cooldown reduction and survivability traits take precedence over damage, b/c at lower levels your illusions tend to be squishy, and dead illusions do zero damage.  But otherwise feel free to play with the order of trait acquisition, this is just one suggestion:

\* At low levels it's generally better to focus on reducing illusion spawning cooldowns than increasing illusion damage, at least prior to getting Deceptive Evasion, but feel free to experiment with using Phantasmal Fury here instead of Blade Training.

** 3% more damage per illusion applies to both player damage and illusion damage.

*** Again, [Sigil of Bloodlust](http://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Sigil_of_bloodlust) in 2H weapons and Sigil of Bloodlust + [Sigil of Force](http://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Sigil_of_Force) in 1H weapons as you level.

**** If your illusions are dying faster than your weapon cooldowns can produce them, add one or both [Phantasm utility skills](http://gw2skills.net/editor/?fgAQNAscxEB1Tq5QTicqQ0hSB25dkUoapWJF82FC).  If not, feel free to use those two utility slots for something else you prefer, like [condition removal and teleport](http://gw2skills.net/editor/?fgAQNAscxEx0jq5QTicqQ0hSB25dkUoapWJF82FC).

**Playstyle**:  The name of the game is to reduce cd on Illusion spawning from Greatsword (GS) or Staff and Sword/Sword (S/S) weapon sets as much as possible, as well as getting Clone-on-Dodge, then buffing the health and damage of the Illusions, particuarly the Phantasms, as much as possible.  

**Weapons**:  Initiate fights at range with GS or Staff, try to keep multiple Phantasms up, let them fight the mob while you kite and dps it from range.  If it gets close, swap to S/S for melee range, burn it down with Blurred Frenzy (Sword #2), avoid damage with Illusionary Ripost (Sword #4).  

Keep as many phantasms and clones up as possible, let them do all the fighting for you, and don't [Shatter](http://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Shatter) them unless you're about to die and they're close enough to give you [Diversion](http://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Diversion) or [Distortion](http://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Distortion) and let you get away.

Alternately, use Sword/Focus.  A fun trick with S/F is to start casting Focus's Phantasmal Warden (#5), and while casting it, also cast Sword's Clone (#3), which cripples the target and holds it in place till iWarden finishes casting.  

Then use the #3 secondary cast to swap places with the clone and Blurred Frenzy while the Phantasmal Warden does Blurred Frenzy at the same time.  Can do a lot of damage to single or packs of mobs with that combo.

This build is more offensive, less defensive than the one above, and may not be able to solo Champions and tough Veterans as well as the condition build, but is better at Dynamic Event farming and dungeon leveling.  

**Gear**:  Again, focus on Power.  Same stats as above.

Now i know why again. Premade groups of 3-4 people are starting to kick random invites straight before the final boss kills, to prevent them to receive the token loot just for the fun of it or because they think that these people don't deserve these tokens. Wasting hours of hours and effort in dungeons to get kicked by dumbasses.

**Edit1:** To sum it up. This issue happend twice to me, but not with the same people. The first case was a kick while in video sequence and was just standing in front of the dungeon afterwards without rewards. The second dungeon group was for Twilight Arbor and after a discussion of guardian spells after the second boss, they waited till the last second of the last boss to kick me out without saying anything. The problem with this is, that you don't have the chance to review it afterwards because the chatlog gets deleted immediately after you left the group. So you can't screenshot it or can't check the names if you haven't whispered them before or wait until they come out of the dungeon.

1358713689.0,727,self.Guildwars2,16y26k,"So you finally hit 80? Before you post, read here!",899,172,169,http://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/16y26k/so_you_finally_hit_80_before_you_post_read_here/,"We see a lot of ""I hit 80.. Now what?"" posts. They're legitimate questions, but the frequent posters on this site sure do get sick of answering the same question over and over. 

So here is what you can do post 80:

* I think the most important one should be: Take your time, do not rush anything. (Thanks GotDamned!)

* Go get the rest of those pesky skill points and complete your skill tree. 

* If you haven't (and you should have, but you never know) Go get all the weapons your profession can use, and unlock all their abilities. Get a feel for each one and its playstyle. Decide on a combination you really enjoy. Don't spend the whole game as a ranger holding a longbow / sword. You're missing out on the awesomeness of all their other abilities!! (Just an example!)

* Build your character. What does this mean? Restat for your playstyle. Really discover how you play (See above), and what stats affect that, and put your points in there. Have 20-10-10-30-10 isn't helping you any. Jack-of-all-trades don't get far in fractals. You won't get anymore trait points, so restatting = final build (you can of course restat later). You want DPS? Go put all your points so your character does insane damage. Want to be tank / support? Healing / Health it is!! It's your choice, your character. Build him as such. (You'll want this to be useful in FotM and Dungeons!)

* Figured out your particular playstyle and how you want your build? Good. You'll probably change it later, but... Get some gear! Buy some rare gear and get rid of that mismatched hullabaloo you're currently wearing, now you no longer look like a blind hobo.

* Ok, TheLogicalErudite, I got some acceptable gear and my build is all set. But now what? Well, whatever you want, really. There are fractals of the mist which are 8 mini dungeons in which you and your party will go through 3 of them to gain loot!

* Dungeons! Most of the dungeons come between 75-80, and I know if you just hit 80 you don't have enough tokens for that super awesome looking gear you want from that one dungeon to make your character look completely badass. Go. Grind. Get it!! You no longer need experience, so everything you do should be with purpose. Either loot grinding, gold grinding, token grinding, etc. 

* Working on a legendary weapon is great fun, it sets you a goal and immense satisfaction when you finish it. But keep in mind, legendary weapons are meant for hardcore players, and they are not easy to obtain.  [Guide](http://www.guildwars2guru.com/topic/64363-legendary-weapons-guide/), [Videos](http://www.guildwars2guru.com/topic/64363-legendary-weapons-guide/)  (Thanks to Astema!)

* 100% map completion? I *know* you haven't done that yet. Get on it!!! 

* Crafting? That's that thing that I bought those harvesting things to harvest all these different things for are isn't it? YEP! You spent hours hours and more hours picking berries and cutting down trees and mining for dailys. Now put it to use!! Get all your crafts up. You can only have 2 at a time, but you can switch them out at will! No excuse! Get them all to 400. (If you don't know, and I didn't figure this out for a long time... In options in your inventory you can click ""deposit all collectibles"" and it sends it your bank collectibles depository! Keeps your inventory relatively cleaned out and all your crafting materials nicely sorted and organized)

* ... I hear rumors of some story for this game... Hmm. Just a rumor but there may be this little green marker that leads to a quest someplace in Tyria. Follow that until they go away. Pesky buggers. (The story is really well done!! If you haven't gotten far, do it! If you haven't finished, why not now?)

* Use your karma! But only use it [here](http://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Temple_armor) as they give you the best stuff. Actually? Who am I to tell you what to do? Buy whatever you want!! Just a suggestion though.

* PvP or WvW. They're a lot of fun and offer a lot past 80. It's basically a whole different world. (I don't have a lot of experience with these, so any input would appreciated!)

      * Here's some input about WvW.
There are a lot of things you can do! Yes, you can join a Zerg and run around and kill people, which is always fun.
You can help defend key points, attempt to flip camps yourself, get a group of people to do a ""fight club"" type of thing (yes, this happens and it's really cool that no one attacks each other if it's not their turn. These people are also super friendly!). There are 2 different maps (As all the BL are the same) so you can spend time manning different siege weapons and learning different strategies.
Off WvW, you can also pick up role playing if you wish.
But my most favorite thing that I don't think is emphasized enough: meet new people! This game is teeming with many great people, branch out! Have a conversation with some random person in LA, people are more interesting than you'd expect :) (Thanks to iMelon)

* There are Daily / Monthly / a ton of other achievements you can earn. I bet you don't have 1/4 of them yet. Why are you still reading this? GOGOGOGO

* Some of my favorite things to do: jumping puzzles and mini-dungeons. Some of can get pretty challenging too like the Flame Temple in Diessa Plateau. They're also great for a break from leveling. Another thing I would suggest is to just ask guildmates if they need any help, because sometimes the best reward is no reward at all. (Thanks to Thordsvin!)

* If you've done everything you enjoyed, stop playing. Take a break, wait for more content. There's nothing wrong with that. (Thanks to nTsplnk!)

* Do what you enjoy! It really all boils down to having fun. Want to gear out your character? Do it! Love the dungeons and FotM? Gather groups and do those. PvP more your thing? Gear up and get'em. WvW your style? That other realm isn't going to debunk itself from the castle. Get to stepping soldier!

* I would also recommend trying different professions: Elementalist, Warrior, Engineer ... whatever you like. Just to know how they work :) (Thanks to FurryNiples &amp; Tareos!)

* If you haven't found a guild yet, you probably should. You can find guilds that specialize in WvW or Dungeons or Map Clearing or a little of everything. Doing the things you like with others is what makes this game the most fun. (Thanks dmlqwe!)

* Roleplaying: Well, roleplaying in my opinion, could be described as a player who takes on the role of their character beyond the mechanics of the game. The player is to, in a sense, ""become the character"" they are playing and interacting with the fictitious world they reside in. Put simply, because I understand that this may sound strange to people who aren't into this sort of thing, the player eats, drinks, socializes, maybe gets a job (My Charr is a member of the Lionguard), goes to taverns, adventures, whatever. On the Tarnished Coast (US) and Piken Square (EU) servers, there is a self-established community already in place of people who are glad to spend their play-time socializing about their virtual adventures, pretending as if they actually happened.
There is so much to the aspect of roleplaying, and while to some it may look like a bunch of people standing in taverns pretending to drink fake booze, it is in essence a time to socialize with the community, all the while playing a bit of make-believe. Roleplaying content is so abundant due to the fact that it is player-driven and is always different and changing.
I hope this helps to at least give a minimal understanding of roleplaying.
(Thanks to Lykoaster!)

* Working on achievements for titles. Time consuming, but can be fun and challenging. Full list [here](http://www.reddit.com/https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=1&amp;cad=rja&amp;ved=0CDYQFjAA&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwiki.guildwars2.com%2Fwiki%2FTitle&amp;ei=wPn-UNvwIcLpqgGljYDAAg&amp;usg=AFQjCNFjnt70JwRBWcODoIUBGGEPcAn7Ng&amp;sig2=GDafZpbDCTbGKXNSStZuCw&amp;bvm=bv.41248874,d.aWM) .

This is a form of greifing, and ArenaNet is giving out 5 day bans for this practice.

A few things that you should do to protect yourself.

1. Hit PrintScreen before the run starts. This will give you a screen shot of the group with all of the names. **Make sure to enable ""Simple Party UI"" in the options so the names will show on the UI. (credit to NeckNeckNeck).**

2. Tell the group you took a screen shot to protect you from this practice. If they kick you, then you just saved yourself some time and pain. Or as others have pointed out, don't say anything. This is your choice.

3. If they do kick you before the final boss, then submit a support ticket to AN. The offenders are getting 5 day bans for this kind of conduct. It is a form of griefing. [Source](http://en.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/10r5jc/kicked_before_last_dungeon_boss_has_this_happened/c6fxvnm) Thanks EzJester

This should stop the practice, at least for you.
Spread the word. Lets try and keep this community honest. Weed out of the bad apples.

** Edit 1: To everyone saying that it is not very polite to announce that I am ready to report people before the run starts, all I would say before a run is ""Took a SS...lets run this!"" It gets the point across and is very casual. If they ask why I took a SS, then I would explain. If they don't ask, I wouldn't say anything else. **

Edit 2: For those players saying a SS is not needed for a ticket. You are correct. I say to take a SS with the player names because when you are removed from a group, the party chat is lost. I know I can't remember people's name after I am out of the group with them. This is a reminder tool so you can report the proper players for the offense.

Edit 3: For our more dense readers....THIS IS MEANT TO STOP THE GRIEFING OF PEOPLE IN DUNGEON RUNS. This is not meant for a way to get carried through a dungeon. This is not meant as a tool for a kid to hang over the group's head so they can't kick him because he sucks. Gezz.....

Thanks to all for up-voting this idea. At least now, maybe the griefers will think twice before kicking people, even if you don't announce the SS before hand. 
Thanks to all for the good discussion. I would love for AN to comment on this practice so we could get an official word on how they handle these situations internally.

So I made this table and decided I'd just do all the armor I could in the hope that it helps others.

Some general notes:

* Loot source is anything I found on the Trading Post, I'm not actually sure where it comes from just suspecting it is a random drop or from the Mystic Forge.
* Skins:
 * All the Karma armor has the same skin for the type, refer to [this page](http://dulfy.net/2012/09/08/gw2-templegod-karma-armor-sets/).
 * All the loot armor has the same skin for the type.
 * All the crafted armor has the same skin for the type.
* Karma stats are wonky, the stat with the highest value is in the primary stat column, other stats are in order of magnitude.
* All other armor the secondary stats are the same value.

At first I thought none of the things they collect are actually shiny at all and skritt are crazy, certainly they aren't gems or gold, but it wasn't until I did the skill challenge in the trashed windmill in Queensdale with the Skirtt King guy who wants to fight dragons (right next to Windlost Delves on the map) that I noticed him and the Skirtt on the floor below him are surrounded by piles of their shinies. Shinies, that glowed golden and sparkled. Shinies, that were useless crap like rocks and metal bars. Shinies, that were all items you could pick up and use in combat.

I am very much enjoying the toys that you sent us, especially the Oil Boots. Please don't send any more Oil Boots to the Charr engineers though, it gunks up their fur and we have to give them a bath and they don't like that.

Anyway, I'm writing this letter because we've noticed a few problems. First off, these kits are getting really bulky. They're also kind of ugly and some of the other engineers were complaining that they're having a hard time finding non-engineer girlfriends because of how bulky the backpacks were. Someone, I won't say who, said they might just try and be a Mesmer. I won't go in to details, but they same something about a ""Phantasm Gang-Bang"" or something similar. 

Our turrets are also being really buggy, can you get someone to come look at them? They're firing just at nothing. Especially the Flame Turret. It really likes firing at nothing. I think we might need to switch to a more durable model too, because they seem to break a whole lot and the damned things are so complicated it takes almost 40 seconds to get them back together.

When you send us the new turrets, could you also be sure to get better nozzles for the flamethrowers? Despite what you'd think, its actually very hard to hit something up close to you. Wider nozzles would be appreciated. 

Jeffery, you remember, the one with the funny eye, said he doesn't even know why he has sigils anymore because they don't work on his flamethrower or grenades. I told him that we'd need a sigil for each grenade and that'd be expensive, but then he said just put it on the backpack and you'll do fine. Maybe he has a special backpack, but mine doesn't work that way. I'll ask the others to see how that's going.

Oh, and Lewis has been saying the mortars need new barrels. They really don't go very far. I can throw a grenade MUCH farther. Actually, I can throw a grenade really far. Maybe some heavier grenades, or more accurate barrels for our guns?

Also, when you're designing the new kits, could you maybe get us new tool kits? People have been wondering why we can't hold a shield while we have our toolkits out. People have gotten used to fighting with shields, but the toolkits only have the one and its sort of heavy. Maybe let people use their own shields? I dunno, its just an idea. 

Oh, and for the love of god, stop sending that Elixir X crap. Half of the camp is a tornado, half is a juggernaut, everyone is sleeping with everyone else and nobody knows who is who. This shit has got to stop.

Please don't forget my go-cart parts that I ordered, I need it for research.

This is just a quick post to thank everyone who has contributed to this subreddit over the past 3 years, I think we're heading in a good direction and it's nice to see more people joining the conversation on a daily basis.

This subreddit was created on the 13th of October 2009, the initial subscribers would've had to wait 2 years, 10 months and 15 days for the game to be released, to put that in perspective if the subreddit was created today you all would have to wait until Friday the 28th of August, 2015.

However, running around the world I've noticed, and I'm sure many other have probably noticed, the world is GORGEOUS. It's honestly breathtaking pretty much no matter where you go. Sometimes I'd like to take a screenshot or record a clip and just zoom in to take everything in at once (it really gives a total immersion feeling for me) and that just isn't an option.

...For comparison, I backed myself up against a lamp post to get a first person screenshot by bugging the camera through my character, and then I took the same screenshot with the normal camera zoomed all the way in.

all frostgorge is is people running up and down the same ice path (and not the one with the champion or veteran) until jormag is up then it's droves of people.

the tarnished coast is virtually empty except for the crowded beach of afk players. the same thing in blazeridge, there's always at least 15 people, often more, just standing around waiting for the pre event to **finish**. not actually helping with the pre event at all god forbid they do anything else on the map. everyone knows the dragon is the most important thing, there's no dynamic group event chains or minidungeons or champions, just one thing that happens every 4 hours.

all the orr maps are a mess, you can't go anywhere because all the waypoints are eternally contested. you'll have a glimpse of someone running for ori every 10 minutes or so, but if you get anywhere in a group event chain and die, you have to run across half the map to get back and realize everyone else left or gave up.

there is zero activity in the map chat. i've been playing in 2 zones and **no one** has said anything or responded to my requests for help with group events or champs in **4.5 hours**. i saw people running around. occasionally i'll help them with an enemy and once they see that they don't have aggro anymore they run off to finish whatever they were doing. probably because who cares, you still get credit even if you only hit them once.

i love the game, i love running around and helping people and running events together and working together. but none of that is happening and it's preventing me from running solo. i can't do anything in the higher level zones because they're all group events that start over when you fail instead of going on a timer.

**edit**: i'd really love to know why you're downvoting. if you disagree say something, if you're the one camping dragons defend yourself. i am not the first person to bring this up but 50+% down votes? speak up.

**edit2**: thanks for all the feedback, i really like hearing from other people about this. firstly, i know it's an unwritten rule to not talk about downvotes, but for the first hour this post was neck-and-neck in votes. before the reddit auto voter could even kick it people were keeping this post as close to 0 as they could. so i'm really pleased to see it at 72% positive right now, makes me feel less alone.

There have been some ""I'm from WoW, why isn't this game like WoW?"" posts that I know some of us find annoying.  That doesn't really mean we should be downvoting them to hell and posting unhelpful comments.  Point them in the right direction and leave them be.

Another, more worrying trend has started happening though.  Newcomers with really quite specific questions have also been getting the mass downvoting treatment.  This is not right.  This does not help the game nor the subreddit.  Do we want to turn into r/GW2Guru? No.  Some of the questions I've seen posted require some pretty intensive searching and even then could only really be found if you have a good idea of where the answer was given / talked about.

If you don't know the answer, if you can't be bothered to answer, just don't.  Don't downvote the submission, don't leave a douchey comment, just ignore it.

If you do know the answer, help them out! Nicely.

EDIT: A lot of people seem to be missing out the **attitude** part of this post, which is the most important part.  Don't get sidetracked by the upvote / downvote argument.

Edit 2: Okay, looks like the first wave of videos and reviews is over. Waiting for the next one :D

Edit 3: **My fingers are bleeding. Going to take a rest a bit and see some videos by myself** :)

My suggestion would be to start a petition to grant WoodenPotatoes a similar honor, a [his work in the community is also highly remarkable](http://www.youtube.com/user/WoodenPotatoes/videos?view=1&amp;flow=grid).

Why? Because he enhances the enjoyment of the game for a lot of people and I believe he would enjoy a token like this.

You guys with me?

**EDIT: Cool seems like people think this is a good idea, so let's get it rolling. I feel like actually starting some sort of online petition would be a bit silly, since eventually the writers of Anet have to decide who they want to honor, I thought it would be best to just post a suggestion on the official forums.

Below is a pointed form version, if you perform a longer more wordy version you can read it here: http://dulfy.net/2013/07/08/gw2-bazaar-of-the-four-winds-patch-overview

Bazaar of the Four Winds is a MASSIVE patch. I don't know if this is the largest patch ever yet but it is just crammed with content and I think almost everyone will find something that they like. There is a brand new ZONE, new armor skins, new weapon skins, new backpiece skins, two new minigames, a new sPvP map, account achievement rewards, massive scavenger hunt (not for precursors), new crafting mat, new recipes, and a ton of new achievements to get.  

**1) Account achievement rewards**

* Every 500 achievement points, you hit an achievement milestone and get a chest with gold, laurels and account bonuses etc. (You do not spend any achievement points). 

* Milestones that end in three 0s will give you Zenith weapon skins and those Milestones in high tiers will give you 3 piece armor skins (helm, gloves, shoulders)

* For each milestone you chose which skin to unlock. Once unlocked, you can withdraw and use that skin infinite amount of times like HOM skins. 

* All of the armor/weapon skins are animated

* Here are some pictures if you can't view the links below: http://imgur.com/a/47xAD

* Radiant/Hellfire armor gallery (w/videos of animation): http://dulfy.net/2013/07/08/gw2-radiant-and-hellfire-armor-skin-gallery

* Zenith weapon gallery (w/videos of animation) http://dulfy.net/2013/07/08/gw2-zenith-weapon-gallery

**2) Bazaar of the Four Winds**

* New zone east of Mount of Maelstrom called Labyrinthine Cliffs. Only here for 4 weeks. Heavy Canthan/Oriental influence

* You get special movement abilities here that allow you to jump higher, run faster, and pull yourself to difficult places. Basically you are a Ninja. 

* Half of the zone is the Bazaar with various merchants. Other half is a massive airship called Zephyr Sanctum. 

* Massive scavenger hunt here to hunt down 40 sky crystals in hard to reach places with your special skills. Zone has alot of vertical layers so maps are useless and you either have to find them yourself or use a video guide. 

* New diving location high above the sky. Long drop, beautiful scenery. 

* Funny Quaggan has an hourly firework show where he makes alot of jokes. 

* Some pictures of the zone: http://imgur.com/a/iAcB5

* Scavenger hunt guide for use tomorrow: http://dulfy.net/2013/07/08/gw2-sky-crystals-lessons-from-the-sky-achievement-guide

**3) Sanctum Sprint**

* New racing minigame similar to GW1 Rollerbeetle Racing or Nintendo's Mario Cart. You run on a track with many obstacles that you must overcome and gain power-ups to slow down your opponents. 

* Earn achievements for placing on top and a title for placing first. 
* Video will demonstrate this better: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oj_pCrvPDh4
* Guide to Sanctum Sprint for use tomorrow: http://dulfy.net/2013/07/08/gw2-sanctum-sprint-activity-guide

**4) Belcher's Bluff**

* Drinking minigame modeled after one of Order of Whisper's missions. Each sip you take dmg your HP but you can bluff or belch your opponents

* Permanent addition to the game, played mostly vs other players but you can go around in each of the 5 racial cities to defeat Masters of Om and earn their special moves. 

* If you defeat all 5 masters, you can go up against the Grandmaster of Om Poyaqui and earn a limited time achievement. 

* Guide to Belcher's Bluff: http://dulfy.net/2013/07/08/gw2-belchers-bluff-activity-guide/

**5) Skyhammer PvP Map**

* 3-point capture map with a focus on verticality with some added twists

* Massive cannon that can be controlled by players. Has a powerful attack that does 10k+ damage plus, knockdown and only 6s recharge. 

* Has glass floors that shatter 2-3 seconds after coming into contact with a player. This allow you to create gaping holes in the ground to stuff your opponents in. 

* 2/3 of the objectives are near edge of the map with glass floors. Knockback become super useful here and if you play smart you can win against larger numbers 

* Video demo: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8fB3ZzqAODs

* Overview of Skyhammer map: http://dulfy.net/2013/07/08/gw2-skyhammer-pvp-map-preview

**6) New backpiece and helm skins**

* Limited time backpiece and helm skins purchased with Fortune Scraps. Fortune Scraps are earned from kite fortunes which are looted from kite baskets in the open world or from gemstore.

* Both backpiece and helm are animated and look really cool.

* Pictures: http://imgur.com/a/RgutX

* Guide to these fortune scraps &amp; skins (w/videos of animations): http://dulfy.net/2013/07/08/gw2-fortune-scraps-and-zephyrite-skins-guide

**7) Quartz and Celestial recipes**

* Quartz new resource that can be mined with any mining pick. Each node can be only mined once per account per day.
* Quartz also obtained from kite baskets in open world zones, sanctum sprint chests, etc so it is really easy to get
* To make Quartz do anything you need to turn it into a Charged Quartz. It takes 25 Quartz to do that and you need to do it at a place of power (i.e. skill point that allow you to commune with it). 
* You can only make 1 charged quartz crystal per day and they are account bound.
* New recipes require 5 Charged Quartz per exotic insignia/inscription so prepare to wait 5 days to craft one piece.
* New celestial recipes can be obtained from Zephyr Sanctum Supply Boxes. Each box has a 100% chance to give you a new recipe and give you some quartz as well. 

* Zephyr Sanctum boxes can be brought with various raw crafting mats or event items like Candy Corn from Halloween or Zhaitaffy from Dragon Bash

* Celestial recipe allow you to craft gear with bonus to all stats, a stat combo previously only found on ascended stuff 
* Detailed guide on Quartz/new recipes: http://dulfy.net/2013/07/08/gw2-quartz-crystals-and-celestial-recipes-guide/

**8) Achievement UI revamp &amp; new achievements**

* New UI interface for achievements, easier to use, more flashy

* Summary page where you can get your rewards, see which one you just completed, and see which achievements are near completion

* Watch List page where you can easily add/remove achievements for tracking

* Lots of new achievements with the Bazaar of the Four Winds event. Some are related to the scavenger hunt, diving, minigames mentioned before while others require you to find stolen kites in existing puzzles, dungeons, fractals not unlike the caches in Sky Pirates. 

* More detail writeup on achievement UI change (w/video): http://dulfy.net/2013/07/08/gw2-account-achievements-rewards-and-ui-revamp-overview

[Previous wallpapers.](http://imgur.com/a/XrnPe#0)

As always, I really enjoy painting and sharing here (along with additional reasons, which I'll elaborate on near the end). Everyone is really receptive and awesome about it each time. I don't want to spam, so I waited until I had what I thought was a cute idea before going ahead and painting it. 

I have the most fun painting cute things, and having painted many little golems, Charr, Sylvari, and Asura, I wanted to try something else. After seeing that baby Quaggan video, I decided I wanted to paint something using them. I worked on this on during my lunch yesterday and today, and spent some more time on it tonight. Probably 3-4 hours. 

One more thing, and related to my paintings:

---
So here's a really cool experience that I have been wanting to share, but didn't want to make a post purely for it (and life is busy sometimes). 

Just under a month ago. I was aware that my paintings have been around the Arenanet offices. E-mails, wallpapers. I thought that was awesome. I was also going to PAX, and the GW2 Launch party. I decided to print three shirts with the [red golem](http://i.imgur.com/1GIUx.jpg) painting. I had my two other friends wear it along with me to the launch party. I was hoping to see if any devs there would be like ""hey! I've seen that before!""

And that totally happened! We went around, saying hi to devs and getting them to sign our posters. Some would comment ""hey, nice shirt! Where'd you get that?"" and I would, smiles and all ""I painted it"". They were all really great, many high-fives were had. I managed to take two pictures; one with Chris (I think), who recognized the shirt right away since it was his wallpaper, and Evan, who I had seen before on an Arenanet tour video. I'm told the red golem + yellow balloon lives on a bulletin board where they post up all their employee birthdays, which is awesome. 

[Link to two pictures. Don't mind my face.](http://imgur.com/a/UanKj)

[Link to signatures I got that night, along with my newly adorned wall.](http://i.imgur.com/lHAe7.jpg)

I hope /r/Guildwars2 enjoys my wallpaper, and my little story. I'm really enjoying the game thus far (yes, I'm aware of the recent changelog :P) and look forward to painting more stuff for you all!

**edit**: to those who visited again, I did a little quick painting during lunch today. :) [Quaggan plays with dye!](http://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/105n5d/coooooo_quaggan_want_rare_dye/)

I think I speak for all of us that have played other MMOs in the past when I extend my sincerest thank you to ArenaNet for eliminating what I believe is the primary reason for douchebaggery in the open world: Gathering nodes can be harvested by anyone, it's not first come, first serve.

Most of us have probably encountered this scenario in the past: You come by a gathering node, but find yourself attacked by a monster while trying to gather. Out of sodding nowhere, a scumbag comes along and ninjas your node before taking off.
Hell, I'm willing to bet that most of us have probably **done** it at some point or another. I know I have. *""Everyone else does it!""* is not a valid excuse, but that's how I felt.


I'd like to tell you about what happened to me today while I was in Queensdale. While attempting to complete my Daily achievements, and generally having fun gathering nodes, I came upon the mountain separating The Heartwoods and Phinny Ridge. I believe that's the mountain range that usually has 4-6 Copper Veins, one of them Rich, but guarded by a pack of Ettins and a Veteran Ettin.

I was killing ettins to try to get at the Veteran mob, and a Guardian came up to me (I'm an Elementalist) while I was struggling with respawns and said ""Get behind me, I'm a tank!""
Already being attuned to Water, I started laying down my heals on him instead of myself as he pulled aggro off me like a champ, and together we killed the Veteran Ettin and FOUR normal ones at the same time. We took the nodes and went outside, where right at the end of the cave entrance valley the Champion Oakwood monster spawned.

We revived a poor Necro who got ambushed, I topped him up and I switched to DPS as we prepared to lay into the mobs... when I accidentally aggro'd 2 Veteran Oakwood monsters as well as the Champion.
The Guardian held aggro like a boss and I kept them both alive while occasionally switching out to do DPS.

Eventually, everything was dead before us. And it was *glorious*.


Needless to say, that was one of the most enjoyable experiences I have ever had in a MMO, and I am convinced that the gathering nodes being free-for-all is to thank for this. The Guardian player (I should have written down his name or something...) probably wouldn't have stolen the nodes if I had been fighting on top of them (I wasn't), but even if he would have I'm not sure if I could blame him.

In either case, sorry for the novel, but I felt that this tale needed to be told :)

Popular topics include: DR, endgame, WvW, legendaries, and you're wrong. It's fine to have a stance and an opinion, but that seems to take a back seat when you feel strongly enough to tell people to stop playing the game. Now that the honeymoon period is over and a lot of people are level 80, we have had time to reflect form opinions based on our experiences. A lot of people love the game as it is, some want things changed, and others disagree with GW2's design on a fundamental level. The community gets further divided, and thinly veiled 'get out' posts are becoming more common.

**?!?!?!?!**

Now there are a bunch of (highly upvoted) threads telling people they are:

1. Playing the game wrong

2. Playing the wrong game

3. Unable to enjoy the game

4. Missing something that is really obvious that lets everyone fall in love with everything about the game

5. Unable to enjoy games in general



So here goes:

If your post contains any of the items mentioned above, I have a rather bold suggestion: get out of this subreddit. You add nothing to the discussion when your posts are filled with self-righteous, blind praise for a game that, while fun, has flaws that are worth discussing without your condescending bullshit. If your love of GW2 causes you to belittle everyone who doesn't share your opinion, go away.
There is actual discussion that takes place here, and that's great. But starting a new topic to tell people they don't belong playing GW2 is toxic to the community and makes you look like a huge douche.

**tldr;** Discuss the game without further dividing the community with arrogant, condescending opinions. shame on the people who vote solely based on their opinion or to silence dissent.

*Edit 2: Thank you for the interesting and completely civil discussion! For those who point out the hypocrisy of this post, I am glad it is clear.

-------------------------------------------

GW2 is loads of fun and I enjoy playing it, but I just don't get sucked into it like I do in other RPGs and MMOs. I think I've narrowed it down to a couple of things, one of my main thoughts is that there's no real delivery of story. No questlines to get tangled up in, no epic journeys, etc. I mean there's a personal story, but it gets a bit bland after level 30 for me. Other than the personal story, the Hearts provide little to no lore or substance. I guess there's a bit of lore spread around the game, but it isn't as rich as lore in other games like Skyrim or even *that other game*.

I mean I'm to the point now where I don't even really feel like logging in sometimes, unless I want to PvP. Of course, my time is severely limited by my RL (only get a few hours a week), but I usually find myself spending that free time playing something else. Normally, I get wrapped up into RPGs and I don't want to put them down. But with GW2, it's just like there's nothing that really pulls me in when it comes to PvE.  I'm not saying that GW2 isn't fun, I just can't seem to get into that mode where it's like time is passing by quickly, you don't pay attention to your surroundings.. you just play and get lost in the game.

What do you guys think? Anyone else feel like something is missing from GW2 that is in most RPGs? I feel like I know what it is, but I just can't put my finger on it. Either way, the beauty of GW2 is that I can drop it and pick it back up whenever without having to worry about time/money commitments!",,False,self,t5_2r9po,1349022741.0,,,True,t3_10mz85,http://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/10mz85/i_enjoy_playing_gw2_but_i_dont_really_get_sucked/,

 Anything that inspires you to see the beauty through the 'meh' isn't something to be taken for granted. I personally think it speaks to the quality of the ArenaNet team that a game company (of all things!) has actually been a pretty big source of inspiration for me personally lately and I absolutely appreciate that.

As much as I'm looking forward to playing GW2, I'm equally interested in the 'behind the scenes' workings of game development, especially the work of their fantastic art department.

I was a bit bummed that there wasn't an area designated to fan art and creations as we've clearly got a lot of creative people around here (unless I totally missed it, which is possible) and I *love* seeing that stuff, so I'd invite anyone interested to post their stuff here for now (or do something computerish and make a proper place).

I've never really done 'Fan Art' specifically, but here are some of my recent paintings that show that's pretty much changed now:

The reference guide has been updated and now implements map zoom, camera zoom, better mouse turn and ground targeting speed, as well as target marking, calling, and deselecting. It also now has a 360 controller background for easier remapping in xpadder and there's a link for motioninjoy (with local mode) in the doc if you want to use a PS3 controller. Check out the update notes at the bottom of the guide for details. Latest version is always included in the doc linked below.  Also, @Surelog, glad you're enjoying it!**

All files needed for Xpadder setup and documentation for controls are included in the documentation. This is for the last free version of Xpadder, version 5.3. Updates have been made to include nearest target, camera zoom, and mouse turn speed (yes, to those who haven't tried the previous configuration, this uses analog mouse turning on the right stick). 

Also, there are separate configurations included for standard camera up and down look, and an inverted Y-axis one for those who prefer that.

The control scheme is also configured to the best of my ability to implement ground targeting for casters and engineers, though I must admit, it's a lot easier to use for melee characters. If you can think of an improvement for the ground targeting scheme, feel free to post here or PM me.

**[Xpadder configuration for Guild Wars 2](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1YROM5NF7bCbkbJTsEvZ2XRPHZSYdtctkPzj9yo0zleI/edit)**

Hope you enjoy it!

**Edit** - Feel free to download a copy of the reference in the format of your choosing via ""File"" and then ""download as."" Please be aware, however, that any later updates to profile file links won't be updated on your local copy if changes are made at a later date (since the profile needs to be reuploaded and the link changes if I make changes).

**Edit 2** - Everyone also be sure to check out [this script by JayceMC](http://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/zg29z/i_made_a_video_about_hotkeys_keybinds_and_moving/c64gw4w) using AutoHotKey. I haven't had the opportunity to test it myself, but it may help users who are having ground targeting issues (engineers primarily, with a side of Elementalist).

**Edit 3** - I received a PM asking how to change the mouse turning/emulation speed. I figured I'd post it here so everyone can tweak it to their liking if they want to.

In xpadder click the direction you want to change, then click the wrench, and there will be a mouse emulation speed slider.

I've included screenshots below. Be sure to back up the profile file in case anything gets messed up.

So basically, a guildmate bought every single Miniature Air Elemental, and is now going around lying to people saying they will be used as a 'secret ingredient' in the upcoming Wintersday Patch.

Please do not fall for this. He merely bought the entire supply of Mini Air Elem and is now going to resell them for 4g50s each (he bought them for 70s each).

You have been warned.

Please upvote so people don't fall for this stupid scam! Here is a link to GW2Spidy which will be updated shortly showing the enormous decline in supply:

*EDIT* **Hey guys, wow didn't expect this much attention! Just to clarify, I am not saying manipulating the market (i.e. buying all supply) is a bad thing to do, I'm saying the lying of 'special ingredients' is, while at the same time, causing false demand through these lies (although it doesn't seemed to have worked lol). I wasn't posting this to simply say that someone has bought all supply of an item, it was the accompanying lies that this person was spreading that was the issue.

There was not. He was killed off for the sake of drama and tbey did a shit job of it

Let me count the ways.

1. Traehearne

2. Go here. Now go back here. No wait, go back over there. Go back to this useless charr again. Go over here. Now go back to the useless charr again. 

3. No experience from actually doing any fighting

4. Part of the mission *requires doing tons of fighting*

5. Said part has no time limit or achievable goal in sight, you're just supposed to aimlessly fight until the game decides you've done enough.

6. Risen are the least interesting enemies in the game and their high HP makes them take an eternity to fight. Here's a mission *all about fighting them* with *no reward for doing so!*

7. That charr commander guy is a total moron.

8. Use these awkward trebuchet's to slow the pace of what it suspposed to be an intense sequence and struggle to hit a target you can barely see as it's just barely within the game's limited view distance! 

9. Go revive this lady! But don't be fooled by the crowd of enemies cutting you off from doing so, they respawn infinitely forever. If you engage them, you WILL take a hundred years to revive her in between being attacked and fending for your life, because you will NOT have a chance to revive her without being aggroed.

10. Tybalt dies.

11. I do not even begin to understand what Tybalt actually did. His death is absolutely meaningless to me. All he does is say he's going to help and do things right, and then he dies. I have no idea what he did, at all. He didn't protect us from Risen. He didn't hold anything back. He closed a door and trapped himself when he could've walked out with the rest of us, as we sure as hell did not fight the 10,000 Risen on the docks.

12. Kind of awkward for half of tybalt's background story to be introduced 5 seconds before he dies. He had an artificial hand? I thought it was a fancy glove. Way to fucking tell me shit, Tybalt.

This mission is clearly supposed to be a big dramatic deal, but it's rife with horrible pacing, acting, writing, goals, enemies, gameplay...the whole thing is atrociously bad. 

Very, very disappointing. It's astounding that a single mission can be *so bad* as to totally mar what was, up to that point, a pretty nice little storyline.

I really hope it gets better. From what I have heard, it absolutely does not.

Colin Johanson on Guild Wars 2 in the Months Ahead

Happy 2013 everyone! I wanted to take the time to provide insight on some of the exciting features, events, and stories we intend to bring to Guild Wars 2 in the first half of the New Year.

It’s been a fantastic ride so far – in the few months since Guild Wars 2 launched we’ve sold more than three million games and have become the most critically acclaimed MMO of 2012. We’ve introduced the new Fractals of the Mists dungeon experience, brand-new PvE and PvP maps, events of all sizes, our Lost Shores world event, and two massive holiday events.

And this is just the beginning. Our goals for the New Year are to build on the areas of the game that were successful in 2012, to learn and apply lessons from things that didn’t work as well, and to make sure that 2013 is a year none of us will ever forget.

So what does all of that mean? Let’s dive in:

 

**What Makes GW2 Unique and Successful?**

 

Community and player relationships are key components to what makes Guild Wars 2 tick, and will be a massive part of what the game as we evolve it further.

Allowing players to share experiences in an open world where other players are seen as helpful, rather than competition, is a huge component of what makes our game what it is. Open world online games are always strongest when players are encouraged and rewarded to interact as a community, to support other each other, and when the flow of the game ushers players to go places where they run into other players across all levels and have shared experiences. Our shared loot system, dynamic level adjustment system, shared resource nodes, multi-player skill combos, and the ability for every player to revive one another are all examples of key game features that help support this concept of a community-driven experience.

 

Guild Wars 2 is a game that’s about these shared experiences. Through the dynamic event system, every time you log in, you can experience and share something different in the world with other players. Maybe you’re in a map you’ve been to before and see an event for the first time, or you’re in the midst of an event and it dynamically scales with more players arriving becoming more epic, or you’re fighting for control of Stonemist Castle in WvW, where each fight can play out differently.

Since launch, we’ve shown our capacity to really build and expand on this system of dynamic events with more unique events that are a living story. These special events and living stories like Wintersday, Halloween, and the Lost Shores invasion are all examples of this style of event run since the launch of GW2.

These key pillars — a sense of community and a dynamic, living world full of different experiences every time you log in — are what makes Guild Wars 2 what it is. But what does that mean looking forward to 2013?

 

**GW2: The Living World Game**

In order to continue to build on the pillars of Guild Wars 2, our focus for the game needs to be on these concepts of building up community and events. We’ve shown some of the promise of a truly living world, but we still have so many ideas on how to take this to the next level. Put simply we’ve barely scratched the surface.

We will accomplish this is by building a world that has truly unique storylines and event experiences that play out over extended periods of time, that shape the future and world of Tyria, creating stories for everyone to tell about the game for years to come.

We attempted to do this with varying degrees of success with our Halloween, Lost Shores, and Wintersday events. Thanks to each of these events and your feedback, we’ve learned an incredible amount about how to ensure big events like this are successful moving forward.

Our Wintersday event was an example of applying a lot of the lessons learned from the earlier events to ensure we create content that is inclusive, community driven, and most importantly fun.  From Wintersday, we discovered still more areas we can improve for future world events to make them even more exciting.

To complement this concept of regular world events with strong stories and themes, we also need to build on and strengthen our existing open world and its persistent content. The more persistent events we can provide in a specific area, the less often each of the events in that area needs to occur, which in turn adds to the sense of an ever-evolving open world.

This means we need to give reasons for players at all levels to explore these areas, to reward them for their time, and to encourage them to play in locations where they will run into each other and experience the community-driven features that make Guild Wars 2 shine. Before we expand our world more, we need to make sure our existing world is as strong as possible, and gives reasons for people at all levels to go back and play and explore in the entire game we have built.

So how are we going to do that?

 

**Systems and Rewards Supporting the Living World**

To make playing in our open world worthwhile, we’ll make it rewarding enough for players to spend their time there across all levels. It’s extremely important that we stay true to our philosophy that you should be able to play Guild Wars 2 the way you want to play the game in order to reach the most powerful rewards.

One of our focuses is expanding and leveraging our achievement system. The concept behind this is to allow players to earn new rewards for achievements, as well as progressing down achievement paths that take advantage of the open world experience. We’ll add tokens for your achievement you can turn in to select from a list of rewards, including new reward types like ascended gear and infusions. We’ll add support so daily achievements will be different each day of the week, which will help drive players to different areas of the world and play together.  Later, we’ll also be adding a system that lets you complete a subgroup of achievements to fulfill your daily. For example, if there are 6 daily achievements available, you’ll only need to do 4 of the 6.  So you can choose the achievements that you’re most interested in.

We’ll continue to offer cosmetic rewards such as titles, medals (map complete), unique skins, etc.  which will remain prizes earned for completing specific parts of the game.  These will show off the prestige of your character, but will not make your character more powerful than other characters.

As we look at developing new types of rewards further into 2013, we want to develop systems that are uniquely Guild Wars 2. Our reward systems need to be exciting, and include things you want to earn over time, but we don’t want to force our players on endless gear treadmills for new tiers of gear we add every 6 months. You won’t see another tier between ascended and legendary in 2013 for example. Our goal will be to use our existing reward systems and build new ones that are fun and exciting that step away from the stale gear grind reward systems you see elsewhere. Later in 2013, we’ll begin to introduce more of these systems once we’ve finished rolling out the remaining ascended gear and infusions.

 

**What About Guilds? I Want To Do Things with My Friends.**

Guilds are an extremely important to the game.  We need to ensure there is a volume of content to foster this strong community/social bond. To that end, we’re working on adding new types of content to the game in early 2013 that will allow guilds to go on missions together. Some of these missions may be content designed specifically for the guild to accomplish within certain constraints or time requirements while others see the creation of new content by a guild/s everyone in the world can experience.  Over time we’ll continue to expand this system with new guild rewards, missions, and tools to allow guilds, of all sizes, to play a stronger part in solidifying the communities of the GW2 world.

 

**OK, What About WvW (Or WuvWuh)?**

Many of the features, expanded reward systems, and potentially even live event storylines described above will also play a part in World vs. World in 2013. We also have other specific features that we’re focusing on developing for our WvW community that we want to make sure you’re aware of.

Polishing the existing WvW experience to ensure it shines in every way possible is a major goal for us which requires addressing major areas we know need a lot of attention. We’ve been working on two of these projects for a while now, and both have proven far more complicated to solve than we’d hoped, but we’re getting really close and have made tremendous progress.

Firstly, we’ll be adding paid server transfers, with time limitations and WvW restrictions, and guestingability, which allows players to visit friends on other servers in every part of the game except for WvW. To encourage players to stick with a single server for WvW and fight for the pride of that server, server changes will incur a fee and have time limitations.  Second, we’ll make improvements to culling. We recently ran small tests on Live to help us move towards eliminating as much culling from WvW as possible. The results have been promising, and we have a number of additional culling features in development. If all goes well, our hope is 2013 is the year culling ceases to exist, or is as minimal as possible in the WvW experience.

We’re adding new features as well. We’ll introduce a system of prestige and advancement specifically designed for WvW. This will give players a progression path where they earn new WvW-only abilities and bonuses, and with them gain prestige and visible titles/recognition. Also, we’ll add a new motivation to the WvW domain that goes beyond the overall weekly score to give more short term reasons to be winning in WvW as well. We’ll discuss all these features in more detail as we get closer to release!

**Hey, What About the PvP!?**

Much like the other aspects of the game, our PvP part of the game also will be growing by leaps and bounds over the course of 2013.

For those more interested in progression in PvP, we’ll be evaluating our PvP reward systems and overhauling the way PvP operates to make it feel more rewarding and exciting and to give reasons to login and compete every day. We’ll be adding systems that make it easier for players who are less competitive to get matched only against people with similar skill sets, and stronger methods for players learning PvP to do so in a safe and fun environment with more information to help their skills grow.

For those more interested in competitive PvP, we’ll be adding the core features required to truly make Guild Wars 2 shine as a competitive game—things like being able to watch other competitors and see major ranked matches to learn how to play better, the ability to host your own custom arenas to setup your own rules and host your own team practices, and visible places for everyone to see rankings of the best teams/players in the world. We also want to make it easier to play games against good opponents, and give the ability to compete in games where ranking matters quickly and easily. Of course, this also means down the road we’ll have major tournaments, prizes, and more to help drive the growth of this competitive PvP community along-side our less hardcore PvP players.

 

**Holy Moly This Got Long – Anything Else?**

We’re also focusing on improving a number of other areas; far too many to cover in detail. Examples of some of the major areas we’re working on in the first half of 2013 include:

·         Leaderboards on our website where you can compare your abilities with other players to find out who is the best in the world.

·         Expanded and re-designed encounters for bosses in dungeons and the open world.

·         New types of achievements which tie into the new systems of achievement rewards.

·         Continuing to improve the security of the game fighting botters and hackers, as well as improving the games stability by addressing bugs as quickly as possible when they are reported.

·         Identifying existing parts of the game that can be improved and made more fun/exciting, and investing the time to ensure everything we’ve built really shines as we move forward.

·         Improving the new player experience, to make it easier for new players to learn how to play GW2, enter the game world, and more quickly learn the game without being overwhelmed.

·         Improving the “looking for group” tool to make it easier to find other players to play with in the game.

·         The improvements and fixes to the fractal dungeons, detailed in Isaiah Cartwright’s blog post here: https://www.guildwars2.com/en/news/fractals-of-the-mists-dungeon-improvements/

Just because it’s not listed here doesn’t mean it’s not being worked on, but hopefully this helps give some insight into where we’re headed in the first half of 2013.

 

**In Closing…**

2012 was an amazing year for Guild Wars 2, with the release of the game, the fantastic sales and login numbers we’ve seen on a daily basis, the fun we have had both playing with and listening to our community, and all the great awards the game has received over the last few months. But we know this game can be so much more than what we’ve shown so far. We feel like we’ve only begun to scratch the surface of where the world of Tyria can go and what you can expect from an MMORPG. 2013 will be the year we truly launch into that journey, and just as we tried to change the paradigm and expectations of an MMO when we released Guild Wars 2, we now want to raise the bar for what players expect from a live game as well.

As we push the boundaries and do new things with what an online game can be, we’ll likely hit some bumps along the road in the way. With your feedback and support, we’ll learn from those mistakes, grow from them, and be as transparent about them as possible. We’ll also have some amazing moments, and hopefully craft gaming memories you and we will never forget. And though you may not always know it, we’ll be right there in-game playing next to you as well.

**Part 2 is up already.**  This goes over the leveling build I used, and gives examples as to how to pull large groups of mobs.  I wanted to give everyone something to work with, so that's why I uploaded Part 2 first, which is a much shorter video:

Anyway, let me know what you guys think and if I should continue making these.  It's been quite a challenge but very enjoyable!

**EDIT**
For the leveling build featured in Part 2, the order you pick things should be as follows:

- 5 into Illusions to get Illusionist's Celerity

- 10 into Domination to get Crippling Dissipation

- Finish the Illusions tree to get Illusionary Elasticity (I'm not sure you can do this because of the limitations on picking traits based on level, so if you cant, reverse this and the next one)

- 10 into Chaos for Debilitating Dissipation

The order of the rest is up to you

Thanks :)

Was it just runaway hype-train?",970,350,562,http://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/zimy3/what_happened_to_the_whole_game_is_endgame_was_it/,"I'm loving GW2, and during betas was very excited for the downleveling system providing a challenge throughout the whole game, but now that I've seen it in action at 80, there are some pretty glaring holes in it being a way to make all content endgame.

Waypoint cost, for the love of god. It costs me 1s39c at 80 to teleport to a waypoint **I am standing on top of.** This makes travel prohibitive in most every zone except maybe mid 60s+ where you can expect to make that back up in 1 or 2 events. This doesnt downscale at all. Is it by design that as I gain levels I should be discouraged from using the travel system I had no trouble with in earlier levels?

Due to downleveling, it is still a real possibility that I will die, and due to level 80 gear, repairs will cost more silver on top of waypoint cost.
most low level events give small amounts of copper, making the cost of death somewhere around 6-8 events worth of money. Combat is a bit easier with 80 gear and traits, but veterans and champions are still serious business, as are people training mobs past you, since everything has very aggressive proximity agro.

Rewards dont scale, at all. Instead of the downleveling providing the ability to experience all content equally, it has instead provided a disincentive to go to any zone except the highest you can handle: why go back for less rewards, when the combat is nearly as challenging, and the penalties for mistakes so much greater?

I guess my point is did we all just drink the koolaid on how great a system downleveling is? It is certainly an elegant solution for solving 80s camping starting zones, but in terms of providing a compelling reward for experiencing all the content it seems lackluster, mostly due to the penalties imposed by other systems.

Edit: since this gained traction, Ill go back and refine my ramblings a bit:

Im not complaining about money sinks, or about the economic impact of them at all. A starting character pays something like 9c to waypoint, about a third of an event at that level. Why does that cost balloon to greater than 1 event at 80?

Im aware up to level 76 gear drops in low level zones. That system is cool until you reach level cap, then there seems to be no hope to get anything higher than level 76 gear unless you are killing mobs 76+. The exception being epic event loot chests.

My main point, and reason for the title, is I went into the game expecting that for my time in game I would be able to run around where ever I felt like going at the time, doing something, and being rewarded appropriately for my level. Not recieving 76+ gear from mobs lower level than that defeats that idea.

Many people have argued that you shouldnt be able to go back to lower level zones and get good gear, why not? Why shouldn't that be the case? Otherwise downleveling and scaling are just things that are somewhat nifty side effects while going for 100% map, then the rest of your time will be spent in cursed shore.

The longer version goes something like this: 

It's no secret that when it comes to armor, Charr get the shortest end of the stick. If you're human you're at the top, followed by the other three humanoid races, likely with Asura coming in last. Pulling in far behind them are Charr. As far as my knowledge goes, issues with the armor of other races exist, but are comparably few. With Charr armor, stretching, clipping, poor texturing, and a lack of consideration are not the exception; they're the rule. If you think tail clipping is the extent of the Charr's issues, you have no idea how deep the rabbit hole goes. It's been this way since launch and it's not looking to get any better. If anything, it's getting worse. It's become a running joke among the Charr community about what levels stretching and clipping will reach next, and if you aren't a Charr player yourself, here are the reasons why:

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

* **Anatomy and Culture:**

Reason number one is that Charr culture and anatomy sit in a context far removed from the other races. We are a race that stand hunched, with large necks and horns, big ears and obvious tails, plus all the other various beastly features such as a muzzle, claws, and the like. Additionally, the Charr are a culture much unlike the other races. The Charr revere technology, not magic, and anything that alludes to magic is almost considered insulting within Charr society. Soldiers are the norm; and if you're not a soldier you wear simple rags and outfits because you are of lesser use to the Legions. None of this, from anatomy to culture, is considered in Charr armor. The great irony, in fact, is that for a race so determined to be individualized from the other races, and for a race who are the direct antithesis to humans, the Charr receive nothing in the form of armor or town clothes except those which are first modeled for humans both in anatomy and context, and then grafted - stretched and mangled - to fit the Charr form. A simple scan through the gem shop confirms this. Sweaters, riding boots, vests and blossomed shirts, hoodies (for a race with horns). These are all human fashions, and while they don't perfectly translate to the other races, they translate even less to Charr, who systematically oppose human culture. Of course, it's not just town clothes. 

Almost every armor model in the game is designed with humans and humanoids in mind first. In fact, with the exception of the cultural armors, there are, I believe, two outfits designed with Charr in mind: Vigil, and the Cook's Outfit. If you're asking about Citadel of Flame, we'll get back to that. There's a reason why I pick these two as examples: they generally conform to Charr anatomy. The Cook's Outfit features a muzzle cage which shows that it was designed specifically with muzzles in mind. Similarly, Vigil armor features large turtlenecks and shoulderguards indicative of the Charr. Heavy Vigil also features what I presume to be a rear flap for the tail, one that was never actually modeled properly and left to clip (you can see it [here](http://i.imgur.com/fl0EXGx.jpg)).

The only other reason I presume Vigil was designed with Charr in mind is because the founder was a Charr, and it seems reasonable to assume that Anet designed heavy Charr Vigil armor with Almorra Soulkeeper's physique in mind. Even so, it still presents the typical stretching issues (and you can see it in the above image, particularly about the belt on the hip, and on the backs of the calves), and all three armor tiers have tail clipping. 

Back to the issue at hand; there's a concept illustration I like to use that shows how Charr armor *should* look. You can find that [here](http://i.imgur.com/1FvEUtn.jpg). Notice several things about how the armor *considers anatomy* in its design. Full face masks protect the entire head, including the muzzle (there are currently only three full face helms in game, and they're all cultural. We'll get back to that as well). Armor extends along the entire length of the neck, protecting it. Space for horns is considered. These are the kinds of things that are essential to good looking, believable armor that are lost when you take the armor of a humanoid race and stretch it to fit a beastly race. Other examples of good Charr armor in concept are abound. Here's a [small gallery](http://imgur.com/a/N4yEr) with a few more images as examples. Googling 'Charr Concept Art' will yield you even more results. All are prime examples on conforming to anatomy and culture, and considers a race where even magical spellcasters wear minimalist robes or light plate armor instead of cloth gowns, and where soldiers take consideration of their form in crafting armor. What hurts me most is to know that Anet is certainly not unaware of these things. [Their artists certainly are](http://i.imgur.com/vzmGF30.jpg), yet maybe bits and pieces of two or three of those designs at most made it into the game. 

Now, here's the thing. As much as I would *love* to see anatomy and culture considered in the production of Charr armor, I understand that Anet is building a game for five races, and that Charr do not exist in a vacuum. Does this necessarily excuse creating all armor for humans first and them exporting it to other races? No, but it's at least more understandable. It would take a lot of resources to design armor which would only fit the anatomy and culture of one race specifically, and thus Anet chooses to take the path that will appeal to the greatest number of people. That's good. However, here's the thing. The issues don't stop there. What's been argued above is not something that can be easily fixed, at least not without relocating a lot of time and resources. The second issue, however, brings to light just how little Anet cares even without consideration for the above.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

* **Undue lack of care and general apathy or indifference:**

I'm going to go out on a limb and say that, as a Charr player, I feel like Anet simply does not care about me or my race. Is there any truth to this? Only what truth I feel there is to it, but with perhaps a few more examples you'll begin to see why. The fact of the matter is, even foregoing the above, Anet still puts in a shameful amount of effort when it comes to dealing with what armor they *do* give the Charr.  

Have you ever noticed how many Charr Warrior and Guardians wear full tier 3 cultural, or some armor with a combination of tier 3 pieces? There's a reason for that. It looks good. It looks *really* good. It exemplifies everything I said above about conforming to Charr anatomy and culture. The unfortunate truth, however, is that not only does it look really *good*, everything else looks really *bad*. There's a reason why. Rytlock wears tier 3. Almost everything positive you can say about tier 3 heavy cultural can be chalked up to the fact that Rytlock had to have something to wear, and needed to look good doing it. The other Charr cultural armors? Some present tail clipping, and other issues that could have easily been avoided. In fact, it seems the only time Anet specifically cares about making sure Charr armor has a high level of quality to it is when it's being crafted for an important figure. Why do you think I mentioned Almorra Soulkeeper and Vigil armor? 

If the armors are not being purposed for a significant character, they will almost invariably be modeled for humans, exported to Charr, and come with all the features thereof. Stretching. Clipping. Removal of horns. It's almost impossible to find any armor or any combination of Charr armors without these things. And that's where the laziness comes in. Anet has shown no signs of improving these things, and continues to release stretched models, clipping, and other designs that clearly show undue lack of care for the Charr. Remember how I excluded Citadel of Flame armor from the list of armors designed for Charr? That's because it wasn't. Ironically, it's one the Charr's worst armor sets. Consider the first argument, and you realize that no Charr would ever be caught dead wearing anything relating them to the Flame Legion. Consider the second, and you realize just how foolish and lazy the design is. This is a set of armor designed by a Legion of Charr, *for* a Legion of Charr, and yet it comes with some of the most obvious stretching and clipping issues in the game. The outfits don't even have slots for a tail, and they were designed for Charr. It's indicative of how little Anet cares to treat the Charr and their armor with due consideration, and another example of how the designs and implementation of our armor falls dead last on their list of priorities.

So, where does the Radiant Helm fit into all of this?

[Here's what my Charr looks like without the helmet on.](http://i.imgur.com/BYyey7N.jpg)

[And here's what he looks like with it on.](http://i.imgur.com/grFY2N5.jpg)

Absent: Horns, ears, mane, dignity.

On a general level, I wasn't going to get the Radiant Helm anyway. Sans that fact I'm short a few achievement points, it's too bright for my tastes. Of course, this isn't about that. This is such an extreme level of laziness and lack of care that I can't even be mad, I'm simply *impressed*. This is a helmet that I'm guessing a very small proportion of the population has even dedicated enough time into the game to receive yet. It's supposed to be prestigious. On Charr, it's anything but. I have absolutely no doubt that whoever was tasked with modelling this helm simply took the helm for the humans, and placed it right on the Charr's head without even a thought that, culture and anatomy argument aside, it might be both ugly and uncaring to not even make an attempt to preserve the ears and horns of the character. Of course, I don't blame the modeler - this has been the precedent since the beginning. And that's what this is about.

So the helm looks awful, just don't wear it, right? Of course, and that's the plan. But here's the problem: this sets a whole new precedent for laziness when it comes to modelling armor and putting even a trace amount of care into crafting a quality product. That's what this is all about. As I said, it's no secret that Charr get the short end of the armor stick, but this takes it to such a high degree that I can't help but worry for the future of Charr armor. This isn't an isolated incident being extrapolated by a slippery slope argument - it's a continuing decline in quality that is the basis for why I and many other Charr players feel that Anet simply *does not care*. 

And that's why I made this post. I have my completed Armor set for my guardian, and have had it for months without incentive or good reason to change. Many other Charr players probably care less than me about how their armor looks, and I wish I could have that level of indifference. I'm making this post because I think the Radiant Helm represents an unacceptable decline in quality that crosses a line Anet should have stayed well above, and someone had to say something. In the grand scheme of things, is it a big deal? Not really. There's a whole game with lots of other issues to worry about. However, this is an issue that's very close to a race and a community that I very much enjoy, and to see things like this completely frustrates me. It's my hope that there's at least one person at Anet who it frustrates as well, who might be able to have a say. Not for the helmet, but for the future of Charr armor, the quality of the armor of other races, and the quality of armor for races to come. The Charr community already has no hope for good looking armor unless we get new cultural sets, and I can't imagine the same is untrue for any potential future races if they happen - Tengu, Quaggan, Skritt, what have you. For their benefit as well, someone needs to start caring.

The problem is players are constantly annoyed by them while they are watched over.

However, this wouldn't ruin the game if ArenaNet took preventive actions. When? When a player gets reported over X times by a number of different players (with some checks on guild membership, friendship and whispers of the reporters so trolling the system is hard) How? With the BUNNY PUNISHMENT.

So, we have this player. He gets reported a lot, for botting, gold selling or whatever.

Bunny punishment comes into scene.

* A bunny appears in the player's hands, changing the skill bar and slowing his speed.
* It blocks him from sending in-game mail, using the trade post, chatting and using waypoints, too.
* To drop the bunny, the player needs to press a specific combination of keys, using the abilities.
* The combination will be displayed over the abilities, so humans can remove it fast in case there's a mistake. For example, press the abilities 26396445.
* I'm pretty sure a bot wouldn't be able to drop the bunny, if the combination changes every time.
* Result: Bots become slow dumbasses carrying bunnies around, and we all have a good laugh at them.
* If after a while (30min?) he's still carrying the bunny, he gets kicked.
(another option is sending him to a new zone, the Bunny Hell, where they're ""imprisoned"" until they show they're human).
* This way, they don't waste space, forcing people to stay at the overflow, and they don't plague WvW.

PS: The bunny should have red eyes and white fur.

Edit: I would like to highlight this reply:

&gt;The point is to annoy people behind the bots, not to stop them. If you want to stop them, then you ban them, but ArenaNet needs to gather information first.

&gt;This would stop, to begin with, people that bot when they aren't at home. Those who watch over them would see this ""Make a combo with your new useless bunny abilities"" pop constantly, and each time they solve it, if they are reported again, it would take less time to make the bunny reappear, to the point it should be annoying as hell after, let's say, 4 times of being bunny'ed, like appearing each time you get a single report, and stacking.

Also, making players feel they can ""bring bots to justice"" is pretty positive, too.

1351184094.0,602,self.Guildwars2,122nin,Suggestion: How to Improve the Game for People Who Like Collecting Things (Like Skins),744,142,119,http://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/122nin/suggestion_how_to_improve_the_game_for_people_who/,"**The Problem:** 
I am the type of player who really enjoys collecting things in games, especially MMOs. After taking a look at the PvP Lockers I was excited at how easy it was to collect and organize all of your skins. Unfortunately, there is no equivalent for PvE so collecting skins is much more difficult. There is no good way to organize your skin collection, it eats up a TON of bank space, and you lose a skin every single time you transmute an item. Simply adding new PvE collection tabs for the various weapons/armor like in PvP could work, but I have a better idea.

**The Solution:**
Skin Extractor Kits and a Skin Vendor. 
The Skin Extractor Kits would be purchased with gems, obtained from Black Lion Chests, or earned from daily/monthly achievements much in the same way as other items such as the Black Lion Salvage Kits. This special extractor kit would let you save the skin from an item for your character. So what happens when you save a skin? That's what the Skin Vendor is for.
EDIT: Alternately, as stated below, the ""Skin Extractor"" could be a ""Skin Salvage Kit"" that destroys the item in the process so you can't simply use an extractor then sell/salvage the armor or something to earn money off it after taking the skin.

The Skin Vendor (who could be located in your home instance, since we need more reasons to visit these) would simply give you free items with the skins that you have unlocked (similar to the Hall of Monuments vendor). These items would have no stats, just a generic item for the skin only. You could get any number of these (which would be soulbound, have no value, and be unable to be forged) and use a transmutation stone to apply the skin to any item you wanted.

**Why This Works:**
Collectors are able to then have a good way to collect skins without too much hassle. They are automatically stored once extracted so no need to fill up the entire bank. You don't lose a skin every time you want to use another one, so you can swap skins without worrying about losing one you like.

This also increases the amount of money to ArenaNet in two ways as well. People will be more likely to use transmutation stones (which are still required for the items from the Skin Vendor) to change their appearance knowing they are not losing any skins. In addition the collectors who want this convenience will pay for the Extractor Kits as well.

**Example:**
I purchase the full Citadel of Flame armor set. I purchase a Skin Extractor from the Gem Store. I use the Skin Extractor on each piece of the Citadel of Flame armor set. I then purchase the full Arah armor set and use a Skin Extractor on each piece. 

Now I go to my home instance and find the Skin Vendor. He now has a full set of Citadel of Flame and a full set of Arah items with no stats. I can ""purchase"" (for free) these items. I buy the Arah head piece. I then use a transmutation stone to transmute the skin from the no-stats skin item onto my current exotic head piece. Later on I decide I want to change my looks so I go back to this vendor and ""purchase"" the Citadel of Flame head piece. I then use a transmutation stone to transmute that onto the same headpiece as before, replacing my Arah appearance with the Citadel of Flame appearance. Since the Arah headpiece skin is still saved I don't have to worry that transmuting over it will replace it (which would force me to go run Arah for enough tokens to buy it all over again), I can just go back to the skin vendor and get another copy and then use another transmutation stone (again, more money for ANet here, more convenience for me).

What do you guys think?

EDIT: If you like this idea then please post on the official forums suggestion thread I made so we can hopefully get some attention from ArenaNet:

EDIT2: Since it is a concern of some people that gear/money is not removed from the system this way the ""Skin Extractor"" could instead be a ""Skin Salvage Kit"" that destroys the item to permanently save the skin for you instead.",,False,self,t5_2r9po,1351193225.0,,SylvariE,True,t3_122nin,http://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/122nin/suggestion_how_to_improve_the_game_for_people_who/,

For example, completing a high level dynamic event will net you around 3-4 silver. Travelling between two waypoints will cost you anywhere between 1 and 5 silver. Travelling via waypoints alone is bankrupting us. And this is without factoring in repair costs of doing instances, vendor costs for crafting and of other items and any number of other monetary costs of playing the game. It has got to the point now that we're reluctant to travel anywhere to do anything, even refusing to help out lower level friends because it's too expensive to travel. Some of us are literally broke and simply can't afford it.

Once the trading post is working, the relative wealth difference between lower and higher level characters may go some distance to alleviate this, but the simple fact remains, if people are poor they won't buy the items people are selling, so no wealth will be generated, and the game will remain in a permanent recession.

As it currently stands, high level characters are financially crippled, and will stay that way unless the costs of things, or the rewards, are severely altered. ",,False,self,t5_2r9po,False,,,True,t3_z2jaj,http://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/z2jaj/lack_of_gold_is_a_serious_problem_at_80/,

Left Click auto attacks, Right Click dodges &amp; Mouse Scroll can be assigned to whatever you want. (all can be changed)
Your movement and targeting will be as intuitive, fluid and accurate as an FPS
Bringing up panels such as Inventory, Map, Hero, etc will toggle you out of combat mode and give you your cursor back.

3rd party programs ARE ALLOWED. If they don't automate, bot, alter game files, give an advantage or effect other peoples game.


Combat Mode is still in development. 1.1 will have almost identical features, but with a few extra things to made the mod easier to use. Including, 60+ crosshairs, User interface to adjust crosshair and keybinds, and bug fixes.

That should tell you all you need to know about how bad of an issue this is. I really really hope you see this and I really hope you take this feedback seriously and start working to fix this problem. Guilds have fallen apart because of these horrible Guild management ""features"", examples of such are listed in this very thread. Please, for the love of Grenth, fix this.

----

For small or medium guilds, the lack of proper Guild Management is crippling. I have always supported Arenanet and overall, I think the decisions they make and the things they do regarding their game are good. This is one area, though, that I feel *needs* to be addressed right now. From what I understand, guild management is a low priority for them right now and that needs to change immediately. The mediocre at best guild management was tolerable at launch, it was a new game and I understood that I wasn't going to get much in the way of management features. I was ok with that. The game is now almost a year old and this is still a low priority to them and that's unacceptable.

----

The guild management features are bad enough for large guilds of people that are ok with using third party site, but for small - medium sized guilds (like mine) it's damn near crippling. Getting people to use a third party site just to check for basic things like announcements or event postings is not an easy thing to do, and players should not be required to do it anyway. These things **need** to be fixed right away.

* **Guild information**

There is no reason not to include a ""Guild Information"" tab. I should not have to take up the amount of space needed to include the guild's Teamspeak server IP, password, website address, and reddit address. There should be a tab where I can enter in all of that info, as well as the guild rules and possibly a bit of background on the guild. I should also be able to insert links here, to say reddit or the guild website. If /wiki can open a browser window, why can't I add a URL to do the same?

* **MOTD**

The character limit on this is a joke. Couple that with the fact that I need the above information to be included in every single MOTD, and it's even worse. I also should not have to lose all of the current MOTD when I click ""edit"". That makes the edit button more of a ""clear"" button, really. Also, what's the purpose of a MOTD if it doesn't ping when players log in. I have little to no motivation to update it knowing that people may or may not see what I put there. It should ping when you login as well as when it's changed. That's pretty basic, imo.

* **Last Online**

Self explanatory. My guild has very lax rules (we have people that have been inactive since 3 weeks after launch and I still refuse to boot them), but I still would like to see how active my members are. This is one of the most astonishingly basic features that's missing in GW2. I suppose you could put last represented, too, but since I don't require rep I really don't mind not having that.

* **Login Notification** (thanks u/downfalleclipse)

Even if it's just an option you can toggle on or off, you should have the option to show in chat when guild members login. I'm sick of opening my guild panel periodically just to see if people have logged in.

* **Message suppression**

If I'm trying to send personal messages to my guildies congratulating them on a promotion, or giving them information about something, or sending them bags or materials, I should not be suppressed after 2 god damn messages. I understand the need for suppression, but it seriously needs to either go away or be **severely** relaxed when messaging people in the same guild.

* **Communication**

Communication is everything in a guild. I should be able to send a mass mail message to all my guildies if I need to so that I don't have to wait for them to all log in and keep track of who I sent mail to already. Put limits on it if you have to, to avoid spamming. Make it cost influence, or merits, or gold, just give us an option. Also, as a guild leader who doesn't require rep, please allow us to see guild chat no matter if we're representing or not. Or at least give us an option to do so. This would solve so many damn problems it's ridiculous.

* **Calendar**

FFS, this *needs* to be added. I shouldn't have to use Google calender to track my guilds events. This isn't a new concept. The game needs a calendar where I can create an event and send out an alert about the event or an invite to it to all of my members. They should then be able to confirm that they can or cannot attend and it should be marked on the calender as a reminder. It's 2013, why does this not exist in this game?

----

These are just some of the most basic things that are desperately needed for guild management. There are others that would be nice as well, but these are the basics that need to be added before they cripple guilds to the point of total destruction. Some other things that would be nice would include:

* **Player notes**

The ability to add RL names, availability, or other notes about guild members would be very useful

* **Officer chat**

An officer channel would be nice to have.

* **Better rank permissions**

Why Admin lower ranks includes ""promote"" and ""kick"" in one option still baffles me. What if I want an officer rank that can recruit new members and promote lower ranked members, but not get pissy and kick people he disagrees with or something? I trust all of my officers (wouldn't have made them officers if I didn't) but this would be a nice peace of mind fix for many guild leaders.

* **Crafting requests**

I think it'd be pretty cool, since I can see everyone's crafting level, if i could right click a 400 cook's name and click ""request omnom bars"" or something, which would allow me to send that player the mats (or gold if I didn't have the mats) needed for the exact amount of bars I needed so that that member could make them for me.

---

We need to keep bringing this up so Arenanet knows how important this is. I would have posted this on the official forums but due to a combination of their turbo strict rules and my naturally, shall we say abrasive, nature I was banned from them a long time ago. But this is a major and crippling problem for some guilds, and it needs to be addressed asap. Just look at my d### [subreddit](http://www.reddit.com/r/ecto), for chrit's sake! I have to make ""Event"" posts and ""Announcement""posts, and link to a google calender, and list the rules in the sidebar, and the ranks and what they mean, etc. All of this should easily be able to be entered into the Guild panel in game, and not be required to be added to a third party website.

Skills didn't feel as original as first, events all started to sound and feel the same. Hell: everything blurred into one big chaotic clusterfuck of particle effects and people zerging everything.

This weekend I managed to get to level 31, and I can tell you: things start to get *seriously* better after level 20.

**First and foremost**: opponents get stronger. Veterans are so much more common. Champions are a regular deal here. You *need* to use crowd control on them, or you *will* die. Sure: you can still solo them, but it will require more timing and hand-eye coordination than anything I've ever played before (except for shooters, but that's different).
Dodging is now a requirement. Not dodging final blows will usually get you down, and if you manage to survive it, the condition it applied is going to get you down anyway. To me, it felt like level 1 - 20 were a tutorial (even though the motto is: the endgame is everywhere). 


**Secondly**: traits start to kick in, combo fields get important. This was a huge deal for me, as I noticed how to properly use my combo fields. It hadn't occurred to me that, as an Elementalist with staff, I could make a *huge* impact on what kind of buffs people received. For example: just putting an electrical field in front of the boss would easily get him around ten stacks of vulnerability (especially when you are with a large amount of people). Add a firewall to that (giving burning to projectiles and might to other finishers), and the outgoing damage of your group increases severely.

On top of this come traits. The points alone make a huge difference in the way your character plays. I played with power and precision (as many have, I'm sure) and the effects on your power and critical chance are awesome! It really gave me that ""glass cannon"" feel, and because I didn't have any points in a defensive stat, it made movement and dodging a lot more important.


**Third:** hearts get *less* important, dynamic events get *more* important. Seeing the many comments in-game about how people did all the hearts and still were under-leveled for the next zone made me realize how many people are still stuck in the ""old thinking"". They try to find the thing that is most common to what they're used to and stick to that. The hearts in the starter zones are so much focused on (by scouts and such). This has tricked people into thinking they are the ""main"" part of the questing system, *they are not*. 

Luckily, in the zones that have level ranges above 20, things start to look better. My best example is the Brisbane Wildlands, where I spent infinitely more time doing the events and exploring than I spent completing hearts. More than often the dynamic events helped hearts in some way, causing me to completing them without even realizing.

Edit: Another great example here has been pointed out by **[Apetn](http://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/x0gaz/to_anyone_who_was_bored_after_15_19_levels/c5i6ir0)** and says:

*In one of their interviews, the developers mentioned that the level 80 zone will be almost entirely dynamic events, with the overall story being a sort of Normandy Beach situation with several angles of approach and targets as the free people of Tyria claim a beach-head and push towards the BBEG's lair. You reclaim the shrines of the human Gods, and clear a path towards some kind of dungeon on the far end of the zone.*

For example better tips or a tutorial on dynamic events and event chains,  i.e. **explain what's happening**.   Perhaps this could be spelled out in the very first zones with some very obvious tip windows as part of the starting instances.   I know when I went through it wasn't very obvious what was happening, especially if you came in while it was in progress.

If you can better explain dynamic events and event chaining in the beginning I think users will be better acclimated to GW2.   Lots of folks are going to be coming from a EQ/WoW type of play style and will need to adjust to not trying to rush through ""quest hubs"", but rather explore and watch things evolve.  Help educate users that the game is in the journey, not the rush to 80.

ArenaNet you've made a beautiful game that has so much immersion it's awesome.  **If you tweak the experience or tweak dynamic events too much you might lose that ""secret sauce"" that makes it just awesome right now.**

[Enigmius1's YouTube video](http://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/v4u9w/great_video_on_leveling_and_exp_in_gw2/) does a great job explaining all of this.

Curious what others think.   Change experience, or better educate players?

**EDIT 1:**  Just to clarify,  I think ArenaNet could do a better job informing players about the value of exploring and what dynamic events are and how they chain.  If this can be worked in ""in character"" it would be even better.  Ideally in the very early instanced area,  or *maybe* in the 1-10 area.   After that, training wheels should come off.  Do not want a themepark ride here.

Firstly, I needed to find a nice backdrop. There's no shortage of those in the game, but it's harder to find one that has a static light quality during both day and night. After finding the perfect place, the work began.

It requires the use of two accounts to get a static angle from which to screenshot all the characters. My lovely friend volunteered her services as photographer, and her asura is /sleeping just below frame. I would then log on to each character (who I'd walked to the shoot location) and do /emotes on my laptop, while taking screens on my high-end desktop.

Here's an album of all the shots that I cobbled together to get the finished product (it also has some information about the characters pictured): http://imgur.com/a/wJrzD

This game is so much fun to play I've only had to have 3 cups of coffee total, seriously gw2 is a better drug to keep me up than anything else.

* Harvest everything you see, you get 0.5% to 0.65% (for comparison a mob gives 0.125%) of the area level in xp when you do this (0.5% of your level in WvW), it's always worth it to go out of the way to get these.
* Try to not level crafting skills till you get to level 50+, the content becomes harder and there are less hearts to complete while crafting xp stays the same (its % level based).
* Do WvW but only to get full zone completion, I managed to clear full zones in under two hours for close to a full level at 80 (includes the awesome xp from gathering). Even without doing the zone completion WvW is amazing xp if you gather every harvest node you see.
* Cooking buffs are amazing, not only do they give you bonus xp but they give great stats/boosts. Itt's very easy to get your hands on food (a lot of vendors in lions arch have them), if you want super cheap xp boosts get a bag of rice balls from the cooking trainer (costs 25 karma) and give you 250 minutes worth of xp boost (be warned it deposits on depositing all).
* Try and level with friends or in a group/zerg as much as possible, not only does it make it so you can kill dynamic events (group ones) that you couldn't if you were solo but it helps speed up hearts as well.
* Try and do dungeons at the right level, the xp from clearing is based of the level of the dungeon so it doesn't scale but if you want to help a guildie or friend out I would go for it, its still decent xp and gear drops that is your level.
* Have one AoE weapon and one single target weapon, clearing 2-3 non-veteran mobs with aoe is very easy and swapping out to a single target weapon for bosses speeds things up a lot.
* Check karma vendors (hearts) for upgrades all the time, you should be able to buy one blue item every time you unlock a vendor with karma you get from normal dynamic events.
* If you don't mind missing out on some gear try waiting till level 70+ to do full map completions. The xp you get will always be 10% of your level so it's better to do it at higher levels when the content is harder.
* Explore a lot, the bonus xp you get from killing mobs that haven't been killed in a while is amazing (some mobs with the bonus gave me around 1.4k xp per kill at level 80), not to mention you find a lot of things to harvest while doing so.
* If you're solo don't try to do hearts/dynamic events that are 3+ levels higher than you are, try going to a different zone (even if the other zone is a few levels below you).
* Personal story is not that great for xp but its a lot of fun and worth doing, if you want to rush to 80 asap I would just wait till 80 to start working on it.
* Clear farms that are in zones your level (or even a few levels lower), for those of you who don't know about them each zone has a ""farm"" where there are 8-10 plant nodes to gather. This is awesome xp and rests every 24 hours so if you can't spend a lot of time on each day and still want levels I would check out the farms in each zone.
* Don't worry if you have to go back to other lower level zones to level, you might be a few levels under but the xp is still very good because you can clear stuff faster.
* Rez everyone (even ranger pets) the xp from reviving someone is great and you're helping some one out.
* If you have extra mats sitting in your collection but can't use them for your profession, spend a few silver to swap over to something else and use up all those mats for some quick xp.
* Weapon rune's that give +(3/5/7/) damage on kill and stack to 25 are amazing for making things go a lot faster.
* Skills that give you bonus move speed are amazing to help you get from place to place faster.

Hope this helps a few of you guys out, but remember that rushing to max level is not that great, take it easy and enjoy the game  these are just a few tips to speed things up a little. On another note (I have a feeling someone would ask this) I only used two xp boosters (had to burn out the last few levels to 80 before I passed out) that I bought with traded gold.

Let's forget about those for now, because when you look at it - a tiny cutscene, for their very first first-time event - it very much seems like the beginning of Act 3 was a stress test for the future.

And it mostly worked!  Buff up the servers some, fix whatever problem caused Thorn to be occasionally invisible, and you have working one-time cutscenes.  (Easier said than done as always, of course, but still something that *can* be fixed, no doubt.)

It makes me really excited to see that the world of Tyria is changing for *us* as well as for the lore.  Kind of like the War in Kryta (which again, was another big trial for ArenaNet to see if this kind of thing would work in GW2!), except without all the instancing.

I can't wait to take part in a week-long siege event to unlock a new expansion area, or find out that the Tooth of Jormag suddenly has 1billion HP that players have to destroy (to fulfill the legend, of course), or have the lands suddenly occupied by destroyers everywhere.

Maybe at some point, Orr will actually be purified - fewer undead, more life!  Risen might stop appearing in other places around the world, once their numbers get culled over the next few years.  Maybe the Brand will actually expand, and we'll have to fend off even more hordes of crystal beasts.  Or maybe the humans will finally defeat the centaurs in their old war.

The world looks to be heading in the direction where it's alive, and that makes me very happy, because Tyria in Guild Wars 1... really wasn't.",,False,self,t5_2r9po,False,,SylvariR,True,t3_129swl,http://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/129swl/im_very_happy_with_the_direction_arenanet_is/,

I thought I'd compile a list of known issues and changes coming in future patches, as well as other interesting posts by devs with no ETA. Note these are subject to change. 

**Edit://** I am no longer updating the GW2 Forum thread as editing the post is a little wonky.

**Edit://** I have added 3 more interesting tidbits from the Dev Tracker. I have bolded them for easy finding.

**Edit://** For those wondering why there isn't a patch right now as of 12:26 9/24 PST, ANet labels the date on the day they work on the patch for deployment so the 9/24 patch won't be released until 9/25 00:00 PST. I'm not sure why they label it like this, but I'm following their labeling for consistency. I have annotated the times for clarification.

1348967898.0,553,self.Guildwars2,10ox9u,Underwater Combat is not fun,907,354,395,http://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/10ox9u/underwater_combat_is_not_fun/,"Not sure that most people will agree with me on this one, but let me provide my reasons. Also understand that this is based purely on my gameplay on my necromancer, so it may be different for people playing other classes. I play a condition necro and thus am forced to use the trident because the spear has no consistent condition damage skills.

I've found that underwater combat is frustrating for a number of reasons.

1. Underwater skills' damage is insanely useless. The ""1"" skill for my trident deals about a third the up-front damage that my scepter deals, and the bleed damage is about 2 thirds what my scepter does (yes I have an 80 exotic scepter and trident).

2. Aggro - most of the underwater skills (at least for necro trident) are some form of aoe. Usually I would say ""hey great, more aoe!"" but underwater, you have to manage how many mobs you pull in a full 3D aggro range, and often, while pulling 1 enemy, I end up pulling a few more, leading to my death.

3. The underwater skills and movement just suck. I wish I could just have my land-based skills when underwater. They're much more useful and they do more damage. The underwater skills for necro are pretty useless considering that you can't really kite effectively underwater. Kiting underwater is near-impossible because there are enemies fucking EVERYWHERE in a full 3D radius, the underwater dodge is worthless, and you move like a snail while underwater.

In short, underwater combat sucks and needs a lot of work.

I hope nobody minds that I made a new thread not even a day later. Things have slowed down in my other thread and I doubt those would commented (and would probably appreciate) would visit again. If it's frowned upon by the mods I will take care to space out my posts next time. :)

Just a little painting I did during my lunch break at work. The idea came to mind and it felt too cute to not paint. Hope you all like it. :)

1332708927.0,542,self.Guildwars2,rd4zj,"I played 18 hours of World PvE in the beta. Here are my impressions (Long, Detailed).",694,152,221,http://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/rd4zj/i_played_18_hours_of_world_pve_in_the_beta_here/,"Edit: Going to delete the account now. I hope this post was informative. I did my best to give a balanced impression on the game and I want to say that everything in this post was my personal experience and is completely subjective. My opinions =/= everyone else's, the only way to judge a game is by playing it yourself. I can't wait until I can play this with all of you and I think it will be a great time.

**My Beta Experience:**
I got the chance to play the beta for approx 18 hours. I played a Human Warrior to around level 18 exclusively in World PvE. I did not play any PvP or WvW or personal storyline. I did not run any dungeons (I tried to, the one I tried wasn't available apparently). I tried to make this post as detailed as possible (this is a throwaway). The post is quite long so I'm going to break my impressions down by subject for ease of navigation. I also really don't care about grammar or spelling mistakes, I'm not in English class right now.

**My MMO Background:**

I was a hardcore PvE WoW player for about 5 years. I started at the beginning of Burning Crusade and quit just as the Firelands were released. I raided anywhere from 1 to 6 nights a week for at least 4 hours a night throughout my ""career"". I had 4 different level 85s (so I know what it is like to level in WoW) and had three high end raiding characters. I played a Shadow Priest for DPS, a Holy Paladin for healing and a Prot Warrior for Tanking. I was very much so a ""veteran"" raider.



**The Environment:**

The world has such an amazing feel. The environments are vast and beautiful. The entire world feels alive and it is extremely easy to become entirely immersed in the game. The game's sense of scale does not really carry in the videos you've all seen. It is a world that truly has to be played. I don't think I can state enough how pretty this game is. The NPCs and players blend seamlessly. If it weren't for the names above the players' heads, it would be almost impossible to tell. The cities are GIGANTIC. I spent about a half hour running around just the central area of Divinity's Reach. The cities feel lifelike and busy even though there was a low amount of players in them.

**Graphics and Performance:**

I played on two different machines. A high end gaming computer with a high end ATI graphics card, 12 gigs of ram and an i7. I also ran it on a decently specced laptop with an Nvidia card. The game has very high quality textures and lighting. It does not contain ""HDR"" lighting effects but it does have dynamic and moving shadows and the lighting was extremely nice for an MMO. I had framerate issues on the ATI card but they weren't as bad on the Nvidia card despite it being less powerful. Even with a framerate in the 20s the game felt very smooth. When there was a large encounter (such as the world boss I fought) the framerate dropped significantly. The particle effects are over the top but it only feels cluttered and chaotic when there are a lot of people casting at the same time. I had occasional hangs where the screen would freeze for a second or two then it would resume quickly. I believe that graphics optimization has not been done yet, so I would imagine that these issues will be reduced or eliminated by release.

**Combat:**

One of the largest criticisms I've seen on this subreddit is that the combat is boring and mind numbing. I would simply say in response, you are playing it wrong. This is not a game where you try and find an optimized dps rotation. It plays COMPLETELY differently from WoW. I played a Shadow Priest in high end raiding (which has a complex rotation) and I will say I enjoyed the 5 abilities I had on a warrior FAR more than I did the what felt like 50 on my Priest. I cannot speak about any other classes but I did play with every weapon on the warrior. ANet did a fantastic job making each set feel completely different. Each weapon has a totally different playstyle and it really lets you find something you enjoy. I primarily played with a Greatsword and a Rifle, but again I tried everything. In this game you do not use every ability constantly. You use the right ability at the right time. If there is one target, you don't use your AOE. If there are many, you don't use a single target attack. If they are close, you don't charge. If they are far, you don't swing. This game is all about timing, combos and situation usefulness. It has a much more action oriented feel to it. If you enjoy rushing around, lining up shots to hit multiple enemies, dodging, blocking and positioning this game will be a blast. I literally played with the same weapon set for 5 hours in a row and NEVER got sick of it. 

**Enemy AI:**

As I primarily played PvE, I had a lot of exposure to the mob AI. The enemies get harder as time goes on. The starter zone enemies tend to have 0 or 1 unique mechanics each. As time goes on you start seeing 2, 3 and 4. This was at level 18. The group AI is very impressive. The enemies stick together extremely well. Ranged enemies try to avoid you. Bandits literally try and get behind you and doge your attacks. Warriors charge you and block your attacks. Each mob plays differently. You never find yourself in an area where there is only one type of mob. There is always a mix. For example: In a bandit cave there might be a few thieves, a ranged enemy with a torch. An engineer with grenades and a boss enemy that immobilizes and stuns you. It was rare for me to fight 1v1. It felt like I was always fighting at least 2 or 3 enemies at a time. I think that the mob AI was significantly better than what I experienced in WoW.

**Dynamic Events and ""Heart"" Areas:**

Guild Wars 2 does not have a lot of structure. There are no quest chains. They do not tell you where to play at all. This can make you feel a little lost at first if you are used to playing other MMOs. I felt like I didn't know where to go a lot. After a few hours this feeling completely disappeared. I felt free to do whatever I thought felt fun. It was very fluid. I could say ""Oh I think I'll go explore over here"" and then I'd get sidetracked escorting a caravan of supplies. You simply play the game. It is an absolute blast. The way the PvE plays out is that you have ""heart"" areas that are persistent to you. These areas give you a few different objectives that you can do to help the area out. These range from killing things, to collecting items, to talking to people, to erasing graffiti off the side of buildings. Once you finish the area, it remains finished forever. There are ~15 to 20 of these areas per zone. It is a good way to tell when you've completed a zone. While you are doing these ""heart"" events, dynamic events pop up on your map. These are things like villages getting attacked or caravans that need escorting. Some are even giant world bosses coming into existence. People absolutely FLOCK to the events whenever they are going on. It was so much fun to be helping a little village out when a HUGE army of centaurs would rush in and tons of other players would rush over and help defend. The scaling was fantastic. I never felt like it was too easy to beat the events. One criticism is that the particle effects made it difficult to see what was going on when there were a large number of people around. I do hope ANet does something about this. The dynamic events are cyclical in nature, you can also fail them (which feels awful by the way). If you fail, there are consequences. Suppliers are unavailable, you may not be able to get your gear repaired, etc. It added to the feeling of impact on the world and it made it that much better when you succeeded. As far as difficulty of the PvE experience goes, the game is as hard as you want it to be. A level 16 vs 16 in a 1v1 fight is a little boring. To remedy this I played in areas that were at least 2 to 3 (sometimes more) levels higher than me and fought against more than one enemy at the same time. This provided a challenging and fun experience that was genuinely difficult. I died at least 10 times in my 18 hours of play and every single one was my fault. If you are skilled, you can fight monsters that are 3-5 levels above you. Any higher than that and your attacks start glancing and it takes forever to kill anything. Higher level creatures hit like a truck. It is not uncommon for half of your health to be taken in a single blow. You do not have to ever fight a creature higher than you if you don't want to. I simply chose to. Going back to lower level areas is still challenging. It scales you down to the appropriate level and you can still get your ass kicked. I forgot about the sidekicking the first time I went back to a lower area and promptly died. Before playing I was under the impression that you could also get sidekicked up. This was not the case, or at least it wasn't in the beta. This is probably a good design decision because it allowed me to make my experience more challenging by fighting monsters that were out of my level range. Just to add this in, Veteran and Champion monsters were a hell of a lot harder than regular mobs. They were genuinely challenging 1v1.

**Travel:**

The transportation system in this game is the best I've ever played. It is fast, easy, balanced and it really made the game a lot more fun. They still encouraged exploration and travel on foot by requiring you to go discover the waypoints before you could fast travel to them. I thought I would abuse the fast travel system quite a deal, but I only used it occasionally. You really can wander great distances without even realizing it.

On a whim, I decided to purchase Guild Wars 2 the day before release. Mind you, I never played Guild Wars (original), so I had no idea what to expect. I come from a long WoW love-hate background, and lately I've been playing MOBAs. I open up the game, take about an hour deciding on every little feature I want my Sylvari to have, and bam, start loving the game from the start. As a matter of fact, I enjoy the game so much (mind you, I'm only level 15), that I decide to tell anyone and everyone I know they should play it!

One of my friends, who is relatively new to MMORPGs, decides he wants me to make an Asura with him. After teaching him some basics, running through some story quests, and leveling up to about 7, he's having a blast. Granted, he hardly knows what the hell he's doing and just likes zooming around as lightning (he's playing Ele), he's enjoying himself and it's making for a good time (as opposed to him getting raged at in League of Legends, haha). 

So, here we are, just questing along, when I finish up a heart and some NPC dialogue goes on. I'm just standing around, watching him finish the heart. He's running to sweep up what (he thinks) will be his last puddle of ooze, when it starts moving. Over Skype, I hear ""Hey bro, I can't pick up this last puddle. I think it's glitched"". At this point, I'm thinking he is just being a noob and not clicking the right area. Wrong.

Out of nowhere, **a giant ooze monster pops up out of the floor.** I see it's frame, and know it's a boss - my friend doesn't know this though. Instead, he is still trying to pick up the ooze on the floor. After realizing there is, in fact, a giant monster next to him, he frantically panics and starts running while saying ""Ahhh oh my god there is a giant blob here"". Then, my poor friend thinks it will be as simple as killing any ordinary monster. He proceeds to get one shotted, over, and over, and over again. Meanwhile, myself and a couple of other players are trying to kill the monster, but no luck. We're getting owned, and end up asking for help from people in the map, when out of nowhere, about 15 people show up to help slay the giant ooze. After finally bringing him down, my friend replies with a simple, ""Wow"", and proceeds to tell me that it was one of the most awesome things he's ever done on a computer game.

I just wanted to share this story and say thank you, ANet. I haven't had this much fun doing ordinary quests in a long time (especially at level 7), and I can't wait to level up further and (hopefully) have more events like this happen.

**What are Jumping Puzzles?**

Think of them as elaborate hidden vistas - some of them are even part of certain vistas! You can find them in almost every leveling zone (there are some exceptions) and Lion's Arch. Certain zones like Caledon Forest, Diessa Plateau, Lion's Arch have more than one jumping puzzle. 

There are two types of jumping puzzles: Regular jumping puzzles that provides achievements and mini jumping puzzles that do not provide any achievements (only a couple of those exist). 

Completing each of those regular puzzles will reward you with an achievement, totaling 38 achievements over 37 puzzles (there is one puzzle with two achievements) under the Explorer section of your achievement menu. 

**Jumping puzzle difficulty**

Jumping puzzles vary in difficulty and length. Some are super simple and short while others are long and feature difficult jumps. If you are just starting with jumping puzzles, it is highly recommended that you start with the easier ones rather than banging your head on the more difficult ones right away! (Save those for later). As you do more jumping puzzles, you will get better and better. Soon enough, you will be able to gauge what distances your character can and cannot jump, how to make really long jumps, and improve your finger dexterity. 

If you are really bad at those jumping puzzles, don't worry! I was absolutely terrible with them myself in the beginning and would fail every other jump. With enough practice and time, I was able to complete all 37 puzzles! I have compiled a list of the jumping puzzles sorted by difficulty at the bottom of this post. Keep in mind that difficulty is arbitrary, some people will have some puzzles easier than others so your experience may not agree with my.

**Jumping Puzzle list &amp; guides**

All of the regular jumping puzzles are listed below. To not take the fun out of the discovering the puzzle by yourself, I included in the beginning of every guide a map location of the puzzle and a brief description of how to start the puzzle. This should be enough to get you started in most cases if you hate spoilers. 

If you like a more guided approach, all of them have videos and most of them (there are a few where I got lazy) have written walkthroughs along w/ pictures if you don't like watching videos. None of my videos have commentary or music as I personally found that a bit annoying. If you like videos w/ commentary, I have listed some below and feel free to include yours.

You only need to represent the guild while you are trying to find a group, them u can go back to your normal one!

By the way, this might take a while to get a good amount of people to make a LFG faster spread the word so this can be minimized!!!


Ask for invites mailing to ""Souto.2157"" in game or whisper [only when i’m online]

(Mail invites can take a while to be accepted, whisper is faster)


--------------------------


P.S: U can be on any server for this since u can join dungeon with persons of other servers!!

P.S²: You can be in more than one Guild, u just need to represent wile looking for group!

--------------------------

Update 30/09

I got a LOT of mails asking for invites.

After hitting the 300 members for some reason all invites sent got cleared before i apply for larger guild licence. Some people that didn't got invite need to re-send!

I notice one thing, people having network error to join guild, don`t know why! It occur to about 4 guys!

There is a limit of how many guilds u can be part of. The limit is FOUR guilds... This seems quite a low number IMO

Mail asking for invites means i had to type each name to invite this lead to a delay on invites!

All members can invite player to guild!

BTW right now there is  300 members.

I am upgrading the guild size as soon the game let me increase (I think the guild need to be very close to the limit to get the upgrade, i can't upgrade at maximum right now!)

Next and last upgrade to 500 members will be expensive LOL

---------------------------

Update 01/10

We are almost at the limit members in guild.
A lot of people that ask for invite didn't accepted yet, if we hit 500 before you accept u are out, until someone leave the guild!!

----------------------

Update 4/10

Guild Full

**I hope in the future A.Net will make a way to see the last date someone log in game to keep the guild clean!!!**

*This post will be split into two sections. The first will go over how to get the most bang for your buck when trying to see all of the storylines. The second will explain how to group with other players. I will also add some common issues with completing certain quests and zones at the end.*

**1. Characters,Races and Storylines.**

There are a bunch of minor storylines in the game. These are decided during your character creation. There are 3 per race and these minor storylines last up until level 30. The storys are unique even within the same race.

At level 30 (of the story not necessarily your character level) you are forced to choose between 1 of 3 Orders that are fighting against the elder dragons. Vigil, Prior, or Whisper. These 3 storylines are Unique to the order but not to the players no matter what race they are. A Charr Vigil will complete the exact same quests as an Asura Vigil.

If you want to experience the majority of the story from all side here is what you can do. 

Make 5 characters (1 from each race and profession doesn't matter).

Level these 5 all the way up to the level 30 personal quest to experience one of each races minor storylines. 

At that point you can pick your 3 favorite characters and then have them choose a different Order for each. 

Now you will have 3 characters and can explore the entire major storyline up to Zhaitan and see all the different perspectives. 

There are a few more choices along the way, but the above strategy will give you access to almost all characters and show you everything you could want to know about the story.

**2. Completing storyline with friends.**

Arenanet did a really good job with this. Not only can you join your friends in their storyline, but you can complete the storyline quests at the same time. If you and your friend(s) are at the same level of the storyline (even if it has a different name), you will be given an option to join them on their quest. This will change the name of your questline to theirs but even though it changes the quest is exactly the same anyway so it doesn't matter. 

I'll try to explain this better.

Say I am on my level 40 Vigil personal story quest and so is my buddy. My quest is called ""Happy Quest"" because I am Asura and his is called ""Sad Quest"" because he is a Human. These two quests are exactly the same despite the name because they are at the same level. 

Now if we were to join a party together and go to the same map the quest is on, he could start it and I would be given a prompt to join him in his personal quest. He would be the one to appear in all the cutscenes and then we would get to do the quest objective together. 

At the END of the quest. He would of course complete it and get his reward BUT I would be given a prompt with 2 choices. 

**Choice 1:** The game will ask me if I would like to continue on his ""Sad Quest"" story in which case I would also receive the quest reward and move on to the next level personal quest.

**Choice 2:** I can choose the option to stay on my level 40 ""Happy Quest"". I won't receive the end of quest reward but I will be able to complete the quest again either by myself or with him in the party. I would be the one to start the quest next time though.

My buddy and I would usually swap who started every other quest so we both got to see our characters in the cutscenes. 

Now I have not completed the very final storyline quest (won't say which). But I get the impression that all 3 Order storylines will converge and that final quest will be the same for everyone no matter what choices you made. Will have to wait and see when I can get a group for it. 

**Questing Tidbits**

Occasionally, you will encounter a bugged quest (NPC gets stuck and won't move to progress story). This happens more frequently at later level personal story quests. I only had it happen to me once and it delayed my progression for two days. No biggie. 

When this happens just try again the next day after server reset. Arenanet is catching these sort of bug very quickly and pushing out patches each night. 

The same thing applies to zone completion. Occasionally you will find a skill point NPC that just won't fight you no matter how many times you insult his mother. If you just wait till the next day it will usually be functional by then. 

There are also reports that a Guardian with a staff can use his ~~pull~~ number 5 skill on the NPC to unlock them. I haven't verified that myself but it seems to be common knowledge in Orr. I know for a fact it doesn't work every time for every stuck NPC though. 

**From Seras_V**

*I can confirm that the guardian's 5th staff skill (Line of Warding) can be used to fix at least one bugged skill point, since I have done it. I didn't even know about it until a couple players who were waiting at the skill point for a guardian told me to try it.
It doesn't always work though. It doesn't seem to affect most friendly NPCs I tried it on. For the friendly NPCs it does work on, it usually needs a special placement for any effect.
Also some events can be fixed with resurrection skills. There was an event where the NPCs needed to be protected, but one of them was ""dead"" but at the same time considered alive causing them to be stuck waiting for that NPC. You could not go up to the NPC to resurrect it, but a resurrection skill such as Signet of Mercy resurrected the NPC.*

That's about it for now. As always, let me know if you have any thoughts. I haven't figured out what Part 6 will be on yet. There were some great ideas in the comments on the other parts so I will probably just go with one of them. See yall in game.

This is just a quick post to update you on a new rule that we're going to be implementing, from today we're going to start removing suggestion posts, whilst suggestion posts can be a good thing we've been seeing a lot of posts recently which end at the title:

&gt; Dear ArenaNet, when will the Necromancer be buffed?

The above example doesn't promote discussion at all, it's there purely for the title and nothing else. We had a similar issue when we allowed direct image posts, people would look at the image, vote and move onto the next thing. 

One way to improve the quality of the subreddit is to improve the usage of titles, the above example could be changed to:

&gt; How could the Necromancer be changed to become viable?

Everyone knows that ArenaNet read and contribute to this subreddit but that doesn't mean that your suggestions will be seen, if you were to post your suggestions in the dedicated official forum you'll have a much greater chance of your suggestion being seen by a developer.

[**You can find the official suggestion forum here**](https://forum-en.guildwars2.com/forum/game/suggestions).

**Other news**

When the new reddit wiki system is implemented we'll be looking to move the Guild information and FAQ, this will allow us to list more reddit based guilds without cluttering the sidebar, the wiki will require certain criteria to be met but if you do meet the criteria you'll be free to create your own wiki pages within reason.

I compiled a gallery of all the greatsword skins I managed to find ingame (58 unique skins including legendaries) and tried to get as many high res ingame screenshots as possible (preview window simply doesn't do them justice). Some of the screenshots I took myself while for the more expensive weapons I did a bit of searching and pull them elsewhere from the internet

This, I hope, should help those of you looking for a cool greatsword skin! **I also updated the wiki page related to most of these weapons with the images if they were missing one**. The idea of the gallery is to scroll through all the weapon models. If you find one that you click, you can click on the show details button below to see how to acquire it, trading post prices, links to wiki page and gw2db/guildhead (gw2spidy and gw2db is having some issues where they are linking pages of unique exotic greatswords with names of generic exotic greatswords but the stats and prices are all correct)

Included also is a table with PvP Locker weapon name to PvE name conversion. I managed to nail all of them down save for the one of two with repeated names. 

I think I got all of the greatsword skins save for the super basic skin and Eternity (which is just Twilight at night and Sunrise at day). If there are any skins I left out please let me know!

I think I will be working on staff next since is something that my mesmer can use as well.

I actually made a few Tyria with Tots youtube videos to capture his hilarious reactions to playing the game.

Well today he was playing and he called me over as he usually does to help him clear out his inventory, which was full.  So I went over....sell junk....vendor...vendor...vendor....salvage...vendor...etc.  As I got to the end of his inventory, my eyes grew wide as saucers.  Sitting there was the Unbreakable Choir Bell.  I blinked in disbelief.  I knew he liked going after the Wintersday present boxes, but he couldn't have gotten more than a dozen or two presents in the time he had been playing.  

I couldn't believe his luck.  So I did what any respectable father would do:  I swallowed nervously as a bead of sweat rolled down my cheek and said, ""Son, can you let Daddy sit down for a second please?""  He complied.  ""See this bell you got?  It does the same thing as these other bells you have, but it never runs out.  Can Daddy trade you some mini pets and a gold piece for it?""

He said ""Sure!"" and I quickly transferred the bell over to one of my characters.  I completed the transaction by giving him a few mini pets and the gold I had promised.  But my son is sharp and noticed how enthusiastic I was.  And even though he is only 6 he said, ""Dad, can you at least tell me how much gold that bell is really worth?""

HA!  Needless to say, I had to promise to buy him more pets, weapons, armor, etc. whenever he asks for something.

Took me quite awhile, but it was very exciting when the pieces started to come together. I have the cipher written down on a notepad, but it's full of scribbles and crossed-out runes and terrible handwriting! I don't know if I have a scanner or not, but if I do, I'll try cleaning it up and uploading it for the future. Some notes:

* The asura letter 'C' is the same letter used for K and Q.
* The asura letter 'H' is the same letter used for 'X (Potentially not; small stylistic difference)
* I don't recall running into the letter J, but I'm looking for a high-quality image of the holographic jumbotron from one of the trailers to see if I've missed anything.
* The numerals are all New Krytan but because of the glow and general image quality, no guarantee that anything over 4 is accurate.
* The best part, by far, was coming across that Firefly reference. Classy as hell.

Also Droknars Forge has sunk. 

Update:

http://i.imgur.com/rv8dG.png

Seems that high level dungeons were being tested internally. 

More rumors (take in with grain of salt): 

The ""Mystic Forge"" (found inside Lion's Arch) is used to make some of the most rarest-high-level items. Many of it's recipes are a total mystery. 

The game is pretty close to finishing, just some high level zones needing work.

Asura zones/quests are coming along pretty fast. Sylvari zones lag you like a mother----- (framerate issues)

So a list of 'big stuff' needing some work to make it readyish for release:

- Sylvari zones optimization

- Structured PvP being finished (still in development)

- Content (lot of quest logs etc missing and tagged with weird numbering like QEB82E and high level zones seem to miss some hearts and such.)

There's only 4 structured PvP maps in atm, the two you guys are familiar with and two more. The other two are called ""Memories of the past"", which is basically a conquest map mixed with some oldskool GvG elements mixed into it like killing guildlord wins you the game and ""something something Capricorn"", which is a coastal map with a huge pirate ship, water and beaches. 

Obviously you can't just walk up to the guildlord and kill it easily. It takes time to get to him even, there's a castle gate and bodyguards and it's fairly close to the enemy teams spawn.

Pirate map

- narrow bayish coast with capture points on each side

- Pirate ship in the middle of the two capture points

- Capture point under the pirate ship, so in the water.

- Pirate ship has cannons.

- Caribbeanish setting.


Memories of the past

- 3 capture points, two near the spawn points and one in the middle.

- Each team has a fort, with a guild lord in it.

- Killing guild lord win you the game, but it´s not easy getting to him. He´s protected by fortification and bodyguards.

- Grassish setting.

I don't expect this post will be very popular, but I just want the issue to be brought to light.  Being a magic find leech means that I wear full magic find gear ( with pirate runes, opal jewelry, the works) in dungeons, specifically I run a lot of Fractals of the Mists, even at high fractal levels.  I'm a leech because I do significantly less damage when I run my magic find gear compared with my non-MF normal exotic gear, so I slow down the run for everyone else, meaning less money per hour for them, but more money per hour for me.  My MF gear isn't even all exotic (some of the pieces are even green, since they give the same amount of magic find).

I'm not the only one.  There are others like me, although you'd never know unless they're blatant enough to run Sigil of Luck.  I at least have the tact to run a different sigil, unless I see someone else running SoL, in which case I feel justified switching to my SoL weapon.  There are no damage or healing or tanking meters in this game, and there's no way to inspect, so with transmutating a magic find leech is identical to a respectable player.

Why do I leech?  Because even though I slow down the dungeon run by wearing MF gear, I get much better drops.  So let's say I get loot 15% slower, but the loot is 60% better, well overall that's a win for me, even if it's a loss for the rest of my party.

This is exactly the set-up of the prisoners dilemma.  I don't know what thought-process led the designers to create a game where leeching is the dominant strategy, but I imagine there wasn't much thinking involved at all when the designers created the loot system.

I think the system is stupid, but until it's fixed I will keep on leeching.  Why should I forgo better loot when there could be other people in the party who are leeching and I wouldn't even know?  It makes me a bad person, yes, and I'll probably get downvoted for speaking the truth, but why does the game even allow people to be leeches?  Much less ENCOURAGE them to leech?

Note:

This is as close as I could really get it. I used the line where the wall met the ground and the first set of brickwork up from the ground to scale the characters. It was difficult because the camera changed with the different races and I couldn't line up the same angle, from head-on to looking slightly downwards. I suspect the Norn and Charr are slightly taller than shown overall, but the Human/Sylvari and Asura are all very close in comparison to each other.

I've seen a lot of concerns raised here about how and where to prepurchase the Collector's Edition before it sells out, so I'd like to offer some clarifications.


**Retailers accepting reservations before April 10**

The street date of prepurchase keys is April 10. Any retailer who distributes them before then is breaking the street date and risks losing their allocation of keys. When we become aware of retailers not abiding by a street date, we contact them immediately and get the situation resolved.

However, we can't prevent retailers from taking reservations from customers expressing interest in unreleased products. They do that without any guidance or support from us. For example, here are some two-year-old images of retailers who created their own box art or release dates to encourage customers to place reservations for Guild Wars 2 at that time.
http://news.mmosite.com/content/2010-01-25/guild_wars_2_preorder_starts.shtml

A reservation is not the same as a prepurchase. If you previously placed a reservation, you should contact your retailer on April 10 and confirm that they will charge you the full purchase price on that date and send you a key that gives you access to beta events.

We appreciate the community's efforts to keep us informed about what's happening in their countries. Keep doing so and we'll do our best to resolve issues with retailers and distributors.


**Amazon.com**

I know many of you are disappointed that your local Amazon site isn't offering prepurchases of the Collector's Edition. In order to support prepurchase of Collector's Edition, a retailer needs to be able to provide a digital code at the time of purchase, and then also deliver a physical box when the game is released. We've worked with each local Amazon operation to enable this but at this time many have determined that their systems don't support it. Thus they won't be selling the Collector's Edition prepurchase, and we've reallocated their units to other retailers.

Since individual Amazon markets have different systems and policies, we are fortunate that Amazon France will be able to support the Collector's Edition prepurchase and will begin selling it on April 10.

If you're just looking to prepurchase the game from Amazon and don't need the Collector's Edition, you can still buy either of the digital editions through them. If you're looking to prepurchase the Collector's Edition online, try the alternatives listed here.

A Guide for Everything You Need to Survive Your First Day in Structured PvP

Updated 9/12: Added skill interruption findings (1c), Amended Custom Build info (1e), Amended Quickness info (3c), Fixed projectile strafing (1d), Fixed numerical errors (3c, 4d).

&gt; **Introduction:**

I won't lie: the first time you PvP it feels like a great big mess.  The upgrade to level 80 opens up a truckload of choices and the combat will drown you in particle effects.  You're going to feel confused, lost, and very often disoriented.  That's all perfectly normal.  It took everyone some time to get used to it.  And I promise: it does get a whole lot better.

This guide is to help you more quickly overcome the first-time confusion.  To help you reach the point where you can look at combat and say to yourself, “Yeah, that all makes sense.”  I won't tell you which weapons to use, what talents to choose, or the strategy to win games.  Instead, this guide explains the fundamentals.  Issues like: how animation-based combat functions, what to know about buffs and debuffs, and how the map mechanics work.  For those players who have already experienced a great deal of PvE content, some of this will sound very basic.  I apologize for that, but this guide is largely written for those players who have skipped the level grind to get into the PvP action right away.

This is a lengthy guide.  You may not want to read all of it at once, and I don't blame you.  I do encourage new players to read section 1, especially the part about Animation Based Combat, as that seems to cause the most confusion when players start.  After that, go by the index.  You can search for a section by its header (1-A, or 2-C, and so forth) to quickly pinpoint the topic location.  Find the topic you need help with and read on.

I wish you all the best of luck.

&gt; 0: **The Three Golden Rules of PvP:**

Rule #1:  **Keep your health in mind and take regular breaks away from the game.**  Go on a walk, eat some fruits or veggies, talk to a friend, check in on your kids/pets/significant other.  The game will be here when you get back.  Your body will thank you.

Rule #2:  **You will die, and you will lose matches.**  You will do a lot of both.  Don't stress out when it happens.  Our ultimate goal is to have fun, and we want you to have fun too.  If you aren't having fun, see rule #1.

Rule #3:  **Be nice to other players.**  It is our responsibility to build a community worth joining.  Insults and rage-tantrums bring it down for everyone.  If you cannot muster the energy to stay positive, see rule #1.

1347276932.0,516,self.Guildwars2,znctm,"Anet, I found the cause for that randomly loud NPC dialogue glitch (100% repeatable)",718,202,162,http://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/znctm/anet_i_found_the_cause_for_that_randomly_loud_npc/,"If you've played guild wars 2 for even more than an hour, you're most likely familiar with the annoying sound bug where random lines of dialogue and sound effects from NPCs and minions are played 10x louder than max volume every now and then.

I've recently (edit: POTENTIALLY) found what causes it and how to fix it. I wish I had a video to prove it better, but the group of NPCs that I was filming stopped talking before I could record all of it. Basically what was happening was I would walk far enough away for their models to clip (stop being rendered) due to line of sight. As soon as this happened, the GW2 engine didn't know where to 'place' their next line of dialoge (or sound effect), and so it defaulted to 0 meters away, inside my head.

I then walked close enough to peer over the ledge they were behind, their models were rendered in the game world once again, and their sounds were properly placed in the 3D world space. This is 100% repeatable.

Another theory I have (keep in mind these are all theories, I like to theorise but I'm probably completely wrong) is that they were experimenting with a line of sight 'sound dampening' audio effect to make sounds that come from behind a wall sound duller or softer, and since the code is incomplete, whenever an NPC is behind a hill of terrain or a wall or something, the code doesn't know what they wanted it to do and simply plays at range 0 meters, making it very loud.

You know how it's caused, you know how to fix it, let's see if we can't vanquish this annoying as hell bug once and for all.

TL;DR: the bug occurs (edit: this is one way to repeat the bug, but not the only cause) when NPCs that hadn't loaded their model (behind terrain) were in audible range of the player. I assume this is because the engine needs to play their sound file because you're within audible range, but doesn't know where to place the sound as there is no model to attach it to, so it defaults to inside your face.

It seems like everything I trip over is soulbound.  I don't mind things that are bind on equip like the masterwork items, but right now so many things are bind on pickup.

Why are harvesting tools soulbound? If my level 15 moves on to a new area and needs to get rid of her rough tools, why can’t I use them on my level 3 character?  How about tonics? I don’t want to be a skritt just this minute, I’ll tuck it in stash… oh whoops, I can only become a skritt on the character that got the tonic.  Not to mention, I can't even remember the character it's soulbound to because it doesn't say.

Soulbound mystic keys? Soulbound XP boosts? Soulbound transmutation stones? Soulbound town clothes? Are soulbound salvage kits really necessary? Soulbound items from the mystic forge... it’s all just absolutely absurd.  Account bound would be fine, but character??

I got a fantastic masterwork leather coat from the Mystic Forge… on my light armor wearing caster character. And it was soulbound to her. Sure, I could feed it right back into the forge but it was an upgrade for my poor thief who can’t use it because I happened to have used the forge on my caster.

I don't mind karma rewards like weapons and totems being soulbound, as it feels like a part of that character's story.  Karma is non-transferable so it makes sense.  However, a visual cue like purple text would help a *lot* to keep track of the items that couldn't be sent to others.

Orr is kind of really awesome now.,609,93,171,http://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/17m9jt/i_never_thought_id_say_this_but_orr_is_kind_of/,"I don't see too many people discussing this, but I find the Orr changes extremely well-done (for a small patch). The game feels much more polished because of it.

The thinned mobs is probably the biggest deal, where you no longer are pulled by putrifiers no matter where you go.

Additionally, many mobs have received model updates. The risen, in general, are much more pleasing to look at now! The increased loot from mobs is also awesome. Heavy Moldy Bags drop at an extremely nice rate now. Additionally, the Champion Abomination from the Plinx chain also got a model update (along with every other abomination). Not only is he amazingly huge now, but he also got a skill update where he does a charge and downs people if they get hit (very entertaining... reminds me of the Karka barrel roll on a smaller scale, and helped me get my daily healer!).

The updated Temple Bosses is also great. The Grenth fight feels much better (though can be frustratingly hard when Pugs seem to pull the Priest to Keeper), and people doing temples on a daily basis is also great (though we'll see how long this lasts). The Orrian Jewelry Boxes are a much long-awaited Karma sink and also provide an alternative way for people to convert Karma to gold, and also obtain Lodestones.

The temple icons throughout Orr truly showcase the unique mechanics the Orr maps have. It's really nice to have a visual on how taking down a temple boss can affect Orr. I never really realized how widespread each temple bosses' influence could be. Before, it was just annoying environmental effects that seemed random. The icons, for me, really bring out that unique flavor.

I can now see how Arenanet intended for Orr to really be that end-game guild get-together / push to Arah kind of ordeal. It still isn't there, but I can see what they were aiming for now. Of course, this Orr update also makes me realize what a shame how unpolished and buggy Orr was on release, but it also gives me hope that Arenanet can create zone maps with a unique feel. I feel the newly added temple icons really help. It's very DoA (Domain of Anguish)-ish with the regional effects.

What are your thoughts on the newly improved Orr?

**tl;dr**

1) Putrifiers no longer pull my ass every foot I move.

2) Updated models make Risen much more pleasing to look at. 

3) New boss mechanics are fun, though could still use improvement, but still a great change.

4) Improved loot and ease to run from event to event makes Orr feel much more rewarding. Also, long needed Karma sink is great.

5) Temple icons spread throughout map really adds flavor.

6) It's great to see regular people out in the open world again.

7) I no longer hate Risen as much as Teemo, but Karka are still a pain... good thing I never have to go there again *coughnomoreorinodecough*

Not to mention the other amazing features this patch added. Making fractals a better experience, shorter/long term rewards with laurels, and the removal of rez-rushing really make the game feel polished.

We've all seen it by now. The invisible army problem: try to do some activity with your band of guildies. Approach a supply camp with just a few defenders. As you down them, 80 of their closest friends miraculously load into view and proceed to floor your group.

Combined with invisibility and teleportation skills for some classes, large groups of players can move around the map, essentially unseen. Since the engine or the client/server doesn't seem prepared to pop large groups of players at once, skills like the portal are extremely powerful. Mesmers have gotten really good at coordinating this and created a de-facto way of defending or attacking.

Example: last night, about 30 of us took a supply camp. We set up siege for defense and secured the perimeter. 30 seconds later, we all died. Moments after, some 50-60 opposition appeared on the screen, directly on top of the camp. We were dumbfounded and extremely frustrated.

The phenomenon of player occlusion culling (if that is what's actually happening) or server/client lag on player loading to improve performance, needs fixing. Attack and defense is necessitating the exploit of this game mechanic, and that really hurts the overall experience.

CoF1 and ANet's actions have also led to the perception that the majority (if not all) other PvE content is relatively unprofitable, resulting in fewer people playing that content over time. 

Also everything I say is my opinion and speculation, and claims are more correlative than causative. I'm obviously not a dev so there's no way I would know what the actual effects are. I also do not run CoF1, but only care because of its greater influences, as I argue below. 

This is in my opinion one of the largest design flaws by ANet with respect to PvE. I've always thought this, but didn't feel the need to speak up until the latest ""balance"" patch, which has just confirmed my fears. In particular, CoF1 has spread many players' misconceptions of profession viability and value, and CoF1 has become the whore everyone does over and over because it's the cheapest and best -- and you can bet there are symptoms. Reasoning for both? See circle zerk.

There have been MANY patches since launch where ANet has attempted to limit and prevent players from farming. Each time a dynamic event chain/zone had its spawn numbers decreased, enemies had their loot rates dropped, or content was made more ""difficult"" by adding artificial time sinks and larger health bars, more people have been found themselves heading over to CoF.

ANet, realize that many players will INEVITABLY -- and as a bioinformatician who breathes probability and uncertainty, I do not use this word lightly -- take the path of least resistance to fulfill their goals. And surprise! Many (read: most) players care about and aim for cosmetic progression. I don't need to justify this. I will be the first to say that GW2 PvE is heavy on skill progression, but excluding WvW/PvP, there is definitely a cap on that. Once you've soloed GL and hit the kitten wall at FOTM 50 (WWWWWHHHHYYYYY???), there's not much else that non-WvW PvE offers for its hardcore crowd. 

So there will likely be a point where players decide to get nice-looking gear for their characters. There were originally many options for making money. Orr was crowded, and many people gathered around to complete dynamic events together. Between events, people would joke around, socialize, and the community would slowly get built together as events scaled horribly and provided fun challenges for the large zergs. Then came the balance patches -- I'll spare the nostalgia of the old Plinx and penitent/shelter days. Each time, there were fewer and fewer people in Orr, and more and more LFG posts for CoF.

Players adapted, and found the next-best spot. ANet quickly countered, and the cycle repeated. Soon, Orr was relatively dead, much like its original inhabitants. It's quite ironic. ANet tries to add incentives to get players back into the beautiful world they've designed, and at the same time uses negative reinforcement to keep them out of it. Again -- players will ALWAYS take the least path of resistance to fulfill their goals, and if you remove it, they will find another. It will not be as optimal, but players will do it. Yet CoF1 never devalues (asides from inflation). Hence, players will continue heading to CoF1, and fewer will actually play the other 99% of content.

Wonder why players are quitting the game under the perception that there's nothing to do at end-game? Here's the brutal truth -- this game's not as fun when you're the only one on the map. This game's not as fun when players start thinking this is all that people do. This game's not as fun when you ask if anyone in guild chat wants to run FOTM, and they reply, ""Na, it's not worth the hour+ for a 48 run."" CoF1 has created a ""standard"" for earnings simply because it is so far above everything else. As such, other activities lost value in the general public's eye, and fewer people opt to do them in lieu of opportunity cost. Yea, it's sad that people don't want to have clean fun in this game, but realistically that shouldn't be a surprise when there ARE nifty rewards that just cost a few hundred gold. And like skritt -- SHINY!

But of course, when one thinks of CoF1, one thinks of this: ""LF1M WAR - FULL ZERKER ARMOR AND TRINKETS - MULTIPLE SPEED RUNS - BE EXPERIENCED - POTS OBLITAGORY - PING YOUR GEAR !(1-5th)!!~ $$$$$$$$!~"" &lt;-- I actually pulled this off of gw2lfg RIGHT NOW. 

Originally, warriors and mesmers were the optimal combination for dungeon running, but as the circle zerk expanded, this translated into other classes being perceived by the majority of [ignorant] players as useless or wholly inefficient/incapable. This attitude has pervaded the entirety of PvE end-game. Some take it to further extremes than others -- kicking rangers/necros/engis -- but there are also those who convey prejudice by asking, ""If they have another alt."" Granted there are MANY profession-specific bugs, but overall this negative bias is not primarily due to a design flaw. It's due to people allowing the CoF mentality to prevent them from understanding how every profession CAN bring a lot to the table, and that skill is a better requisite than a gear check or choice of profession. This attitude will not change soon, as it has become deeply rooted and continues to perpetuate as the CoF1 circle zerk goes around for another loop. For those who want to speed run, there will always be an optimal composition, and it is unlikely to have a full balance across the board since every profession has different mechanics; there's no doubt about that considering that dungeons are more or less faceroll. But if you're not trying to speed clear, every class is viable.

--

Of course, there's a problem. Imagine what would happen if all of a sudden CoF1 was patched? Circle zerks don't like getting interrupted. Players will QQ and rage -- and I wouldn't blame them, because nothing else is perceived as profitable (or things that are keep getting nerfed to the ground), and hence in their minds, is considered a relative waste of time. People used to espouse the idea that ANet didn't want people to grind or farm. But that's kitten shit. Pull up gw2lfg and search for the word 'farm' and see how many of those correspond with CoF1.

CoF1 IS broken, and it's quickly breaking the rest of the game. Unfortunately, ANet has failed to address this for almost a year now, and has only taken action to make it more profitable. Hence, fixing it will result in SEVERE backlash from many in the community. I didn't even mention how CoF1 has affected the economy in the grand scheme, but there will certainly be a change -- whether in the perceived worth in the coin (inflation/deflation), the price of objects, or more likely -- the reallocation (read: concentration) of wealth into the hands of fewer and fewer. 

I'm the biggest GW2 fanboy and I love WvW (now that I've reached what I perceive as the PvE end-game skill cap). I have stopped caring about cosmetics or money. I have used the skins from my personal story line for almost 700 hours now, and with the funds I have from playing the game, I can support my WvW activities. And I really enjoy the game, I really do, and will likely continue to play for much longer. But I represent a very small minority of players who can content and enjoy themselves with that. 

CoF1 is broken, and will continue to devalue many things. COME AT ME CIRCLE ZERK.

Edit3: Loving the discussion! Some comments clearly didn't read through my tower of text though, and so to clarify, I don't care about farming and don't do it myself since I don't care about cosmetic progression. I have a few hundred G just from playing the game as I like and that's enough for my WvW play. I've run CoF1 in the past at most a hundred times, but stopped when I realized it was ruining my personal experience with the game. The reason why I care about CoF1 then is because it has consequences on the greater community! With how lucrative CoF1 is, and given ANet's constant nerfs in the explorable world, there are fewer and fewer people populating zones. That's one reason why I care. The second reason is that when I do go back to do dungeons, and this IS anecdotal, but it's becoming more rare to run with certain classes. When I host a party for a FOTM run, I'm either asked to switch onto my mesmer or guardian, and/or fewer engis/necros even try to join. It's often not a problem and I can convince them I don't run with scissors, but there are always those one or two who quit if they don't get war/mes/guard, as if it would be impossible any other way (and it's not like I post FOTM speed runs, or LFG that advertise that they're speed running). And again, even though I love the challenge of FOTM, there are fewer people LFG or hosting parties. People have found their dedicated groups, and/or fewer people are running it. I started late on fractals, and so I've always played catch up. No problems with pugs, asides from the fact that there are so few left who still do that content because of how unrewarding it is for them.",[Discussion],False,self,t5_2r9po,1370381051.0,dis,SylvariT,True,t3_1fmzw9,http://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/1fmzw9/i_hate_cof1_and_what_it_has_done_to_gw2/,

Earlier there were like 60 in supply and now the supply is like 4.  Unfortunately for the people that tried to corner the market,  this winters day event is going to be long, and with the prices of giant present bags dropping, the supply of the unbreakable bells will increase at a faster and faster rate.  Now as the price naturally decreases, the only choice the bell horders will have to make their maximum profits will be to sell the majority of their supplies as fast as they can, which will in return crash the market for these bells.  It will be like Halloween skins all over again, but much much worse, because at least those skins were consumable which kept the supply low.  Because the bells are not soul bound or anything, they will always be in circulation which means the high supply will decrease at a very slow rate. 

My point is, don't be disappointed if you buy one of these bells for the current tp price when these will be going for around let's say 3-10 gold each shortly after the event.

Clicking on each gives you a 4-viewpoint set, as well as all (or at least many) of the known variations of the individual pieces, their stats, where they originate (or TP if dropped), and even the copy codes to preview in game. A similar page exists for weapons.

The site is listed as a beta, but even so it's very high quality. Try not to crash the site :D

**Features**:

* Calculated the lowest initial gold price method of leveling a craft.  Considers buying or making any part of an item.

* Normal and Fast[1] guides for all 8 crafts.

* Icons for everything that needs to be purchased or used in a discovery to make them easier to find.

* 3 different styles of Cooking guides featuring no Renown Heart items/recipes, some or all.

* Guides automatically updated about every 2 hours based on current TP prices.

* Pop out buy lists for each tier on non-cooking guides.  Ie t1 = 0-75

* Minimalist web page design.

Since the wiki will be down for maintenance for the next hour, we're also providing the full text of today's status update here.


**Account Security**

Hackers have lists of email addresses and passwords stolen from other games and web sites, and collected through spyware, and are systematically testing *Guild Wars 2* looking for matching accounts. To protect yourself, **use a strong, unique password for *Guild Wars 2* that you've never used anywhere else!**

When accounts are hacked and then used for botting or spamming ads for gold sales, we ban the accounts until we can return them to their rightful owner. If you login and see the message, ""this account has been permanently banned for a violation of the User Agreement,"" and you're not a gold seller, it's likely that your account was hacked. Please contact customer support using the instructions below.

If you see email authentication messages in your inbox asking you to approve a login that you didn't initiate and from someplace you don't recognize, that's a sign that a hacker knows your account name and password, and is only being prevented by the email authentication feature from accessing your account. You should immediately change your password to a new, unique password that you've never used anywhere else.


**Customer Support**

Our customer support team is prioritizing hacked accounts and other blocking login issues over other types of support requests.

Hacked accounts - If you submit a support ticket for a hacked account, ensure it is properly prioritized by following [these instructions](http://en.support.guildwars2.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/9212). We're resolving prioritized hacked account tickets within 72 hours. If you have an older hacked account ticket that has not been resolved, it may not be properly prioritized, or the ticket may not contain enough information for us to address it quickly. Please [update your existing ticket](http://en.support.guildwars2.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/214/kw/ticket), clearly state that this is a hacked account ticket, and provide as much information as possible, including your account email address, your account display name or character names, and your 25-digit ''Guild Wars 2'' serial code.

Email authentication - Email authentication allows you to approve or deny each login attempt from a new location. With this feature, hackers can be prevented from logging into your account even if they guess your password. However, some customers are finding email authentication messages filtered by their email provider or are otherwise having difficulty receiving these messages. Tomorrow we will provide a secure method for customers who are having trouble with email authentication to disable it on their accounts. We ask that you use this new self-help system, and only submit a support ticket if that doesn't work for you.

Password resets - Tomorrow we will provide a secure method for customers who have lost their passwords or whose passwords aren't working to reset their passwords. We ask that you use this new self-help system, and only submit a support ticket if that doesn't work for you.

Support forums - The [official support forums](https://forum.guildwars2.com/) are now online, and we have a new forum for [players helping players](https://forum-en.guildwars2.com/forum/game/players players helping other players).


**Last Night's Update**

* We largely resolved the capacity constraints with parties and guild functionality, which were causing symptoms such as party members not appearing on the map, parties not staying together as they travelled between maps, and guild manipulation not working. Note that, while capacity constraints are now addressed, there are still some specific issues we're working on with parties and guilds. In particular, there's an issue with parties not staying together as they travel into dungeons, which we plan to address tonight.
* We fixed issues with the storyline steps ""Fury of the Dead,"" ""Grisly Shipment,"" and ""In The Ruins.""
* We changed the downed mode camera to maintain a more consistent distance taking race into account.


**Tonight's Update**

* We'll fix the issue with parties not staying together as they travel into dungeons.
* We'll fix issues with the storyline steps ""A Light in the Darkness,"" ""Estate of Decay,"" ""Explosive Intellect,"" ""Rumors of Trouble,"" ""The Lost Chieftain's Return,"" and ""Tribunes in Effigy.""
* We'll add an option to stop queueing for your home world, for players who want to remain on an overflow server indefinitely without being asked.
* We'll add an option to report an account for sending spam or otherwise inappropriate in-game mail. *Edit: This option will be added in tomorrow night's update, not tonight's update.*


**Coming Soon**

* Some players' monthly achievements didn't correctly reset on September 1 at 00:00 GMT. To allow those players to collect the next monthly reward, we will reset the monthly achievement of any player who is already at 100% for the month as of tomorrow night's update.
* We're working on a fix for PvP tournament rewards.


**Trading Post**

Trading Post item and gold delivery was slow for part of the day today due to a network connectivity issue between data centers. Delayed gold and items are being delivered; check your ""pick up"" tab.


**Gem Purchases**

We found some cases where players didn't receive items after purchasing them on the gem store. We have records of all occurrences and are in the process of refunding gems to all affected players. Note that refunded gems will simply be added to your account's gem balance.


**Reporting exploits**

If you discover an emergency game-breaking or economy-breaking bug, do not exploit it, but please notify us immediately at this email address: exploits (at) arena (dot) net. You may also use this email address to report suspected security vulnerabilities. Thank you to everyone who has sent reports. However, note that we cannot respond individually to emails to this address.


**Worlds &amp; Overflow**

We're increasing world capacity as necessary to handle all the new players coming into the game.

During this initial surge of high concurrency, and especially while most characters are low-level and thus playing in the same starting areas, it's common for players to be directed to overflow servers. To play with a friend on a different overflow server, form a party together, then right-click on the friend's portrait in the party list and click ""join"". We expect the use of overflow servers to naturally subside as players spread out more through the world.


**Next software updates**

The next software update will be tonight at midnight Seattle time. We don't expect significant downtime tonight, but the game may be unavailable for 20-60 minutes during a software update.

Here's what he had to say:



&gt;Hi Everyone,
&gt;All is fair in love and war – and as love, WvW is a battlefield.

&gt;Night capping is one of those valid tactics to score some points in a lasting battle – to get your world the upper hand, or cancel out daytime supremacy by another well coordinated opponent.

Then I jumped into a ravine and swam around in the ocean until I could make the final run to Cursed Shore. I feel stronger than when I left Divinity’s Reach. I even got something called a ‘skill point’ and got this pretty sweet banner than helps me run past zombies more easily.

Upon arriving in Cursed Shore, I noticed some high-levels were looking for help with something called a ‘Plinx Chain’ which I assume is some sort of mystical artifact. Curious, I joined a party and managed to assist in the killing of a Champion Abomination. I learned I could charge the abomination with my new ‘Banner’ to cripple it and provide speed boosts to my newfound allies to escape its clutches. I even dealt a couple damage to it with these unexploded bomb shells lying around everywhere. I got a couple of ‘Porous Bones’ from the body and promptly sold them to what I assume is a deformed child. What riches! I will be able to repair my armor with little economic difficulty this week.

It was then that my party realized I was level 6 and began to shout at me about why I was here. I tried to explain that I ran all the way to Cursed Shore to help the fight against Zhaitan but it was to no avail. They yelled and abandoned me, and I had to run all the way back to the safety of Caer Shadowfain by myself. No easy task to do alone, I assure you.

I remain resolute. The wargs and spiders could not stop me from doing what I can to help fight Zhaitan. I can outrun a centaur and I will not rest until my Dull Blade runs black in the blood of undead. No amount of angry allies will stop me from aggroing everything and triumphing in order to fulfill my duty as a warrior to protect Tyria.

You may run into me on the Maguuma Server hitting Zhaitan's minons for that extra 1 damage on a crit. Every point of damage matters in this fight.

The crafting system is also a lot of fun and I can't believe a developer managed to make cooking fun. 

I have had a few minor gripes with the game and I do feel it lacks some early tutorials. I found myself figuring out something far later than I probably should have. However, this is something that can be improved post release. I just hope it doesn't turn people off.

The big issue I have had is not having access to the trading post. I understand the developers want to make sure it's all in working order. However, it really feels quite a vital feature and I hope it's finished soon. 

Overall a fantastic game and I recommend that anyone still on the fence about it pick up a copy right away.

1. Don't salvage everything! Blue level 80s can vendor for almost a silver a piece and greens go for about double. Salvaging is useful for obtaining materials that can't be gathered (leather, cloth), but otherwise you'll probably be able to get plenty of crafting materials from nodes. This also has the double value of reducing the amount of salvage kits you're going to need to buy.

2. You can travel to Lions Arch for free from anywhere by entering the mists, and doing so will save you a lot of silver returning from the Orr areas.

3. Low level crafting materials you have left over from leveling can actually go for quite a lot on the trading post. Check the prices frequently.

4. Do World vs World. Contrary to what seems like common opinion, it is not a gold sink. It is incredibly profitable for both gold and karma. You don't even have to spend gold on siege weapons if you don't want to, since they're sold for Badges of Honor on the vendor's second tab. (You receive badges of honor for killing players in WvW and then looting the bag that appears under you).

5. Follow event chains. The longer you follow a chain, the more players tend to get caught up in the events, the more the events scale up, the more loot you get. Wait around after you finish an event in the later zones. With the exception of defending bases, almost every single event in Orr either has a follow up or is part of a larger chain.

6. Fast travel as little as possible within the zone itself. Even if you're standing next to the waypoint it'll still cost you around a silver and change.

7. When using the trading post, don't always just click the 'sell all' or 'buy immediately' buttons. It often pays to list the items for a more reasonable price than people are ordering, or to order for a cheaper price than the item is listed. It'll take longer to see the profits, but you can save a lot of silver.

8. Explorable dungeons are the opposite of WvW. They are huge moneysinks at the moment, especially with PuGs. If you're hurting for gold, you might want to hold off on them for a little while.

9. Crafted items are probably the most cost effective rare level 80 armor/weapons. The karma vendors charge a lot and the specific weapons/armor from each of the Orders (Whispers, Vigil, Priory) is quite expensive. Even if you don't have the crafting skill necessary to make the items yourself, you can generally get a good deal if you supply the crafter with the fine crafting components (blood, scales, etc)

10. Magic find food is cheap and will greatly increase your gold income once you start selling items instead of salvaging them.

11. If you craft, it pays to use masterwork salvage kits on level 80 rares and exotics you find in Orr. They have a chance at giving a Glob of Ectoplasm which you will use in crafting the highest tier armors/weapons.

12. The mystic forge is generally not very reliable for upgrades, at least not with random patterns. However, you can use it with dyes, crafting materials, and other such items for a chance at a higher (more expensive) tier.",,False,self,t5_2r9po,1347196768.0,,Thief,True,t3_zlmfj,http://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/zlmfj/tips_for_those_of_you_just_hitting_80/,

I was looking at everyone's opinions on the most recent changes to dungeon rewards and their relationship with DE reward reduction and item drop caps. While I was reading through the posts I noticed there was a great deal of misinformation floating around.

With this in mind, I would like to bring everyone up to speed, so that there is no confusion surrounding what we as a community know about these mechanics. DR = Diminishing Returns. DE = Dynamic Event.

~~~~~

**Diminishing Returns Information for Item Drops**

We don't have any facts reported by the Arenanet staff on this system, but what has been agreed upon is that after farming a single enemy type for about 20 - 30 minutes drops seem to dry up. It has also been speculated that using magic find gear will cause a player reach the cap faster. The cap is most likely dependent on the number and quality of drops received and as well as time. Also, drop DR may be affected by location, so if you keep moving to new areas while killing the same enemy type (im looking at you centaurs) you should also be unaffected.

**Diminishing Returns Information for Dynamic Event Rewards**

We don't have any facts reported by the Arenanet staff on this system. Reported findings point to a reduction in the reward for all events if too many events are completed in a certain time period. This time period and the number of events required to trigger the code are still unclear.

**Diminishing Returns Information for Dungeon Rewards**

Jon Peters

Let me clarify the change a bit since not everyone understands it.
If you run the exact same chain twice in a row you will have your rewards cut. This means you can bounce back and forth between 2 different chains, even in the same dungeon without ever hitting this change. This change is made to encourage people to try different chains.
If you speed clear dungeons at a rate of more than 2/ hour, and continue to do that for some time your rewards will slowly begin to degrade. It doesn’t kick in after running a single dungeon and it doesn’t immediately zero out rewards.
Finally we reduced the value of repeating the story mode, because they are built to be easier and we want to encourage those repeating dungeons to run explore mode.

[Link to Jon's post on Official Forums](https://forum-en.guildwars2.com/forum/game/dungeons/Dungeon-Updates/page/3#post154925)

~~~~~

Now that we have that out of the way lets talk about these mechanics.

**Item Drop DR**

Drop caps are carried over from Guild Wars 1. In Guild Wars 2 they operate in a similar manner, but seem to affect nearly all loot. In Guid Wars 1 where dyes, rare materials, etc were unaffected. Don't expect to see this changed or removed. This code worked wonders in Guild Wars 1 for reducing the attractiveness of botting and Arenanet has little incentive to remove something that has been so effective.

Many players complain that that this anti-botting code unjustly prevents them from doing whatever they like. Farming a single mob for hours and hours is not actually a problem for the economy, so why do they stop it? It is when this activity can easily be executed by a program that problems occur. The reason for the lack of information on how the anti-botting counter measures work is because if Arenanet clearly defines how the system works, then it becomes simple to write bots that avoid the code. It is difficult to write a bot that can move from area to area, use different skills and tactics, and can handle the many problems that can occur (being downed/dead/getting knocked off course). However these activities are easy for a human. All arenanet is forcing players to do is use their reasoning and skills to get around their code. Think of it as captcha, but implemented in an unobtrusive way that encourages variety.

**Dynamic Event Reward DR**

The purpose of this code is different from the drop DR. The drop DR is difficult to be affected by if you are not farming mats. Dynamic Event DR is in the game to prevent exploitation of DEs that are very close together on the map that happen to occur near the same time. The problem is there are some quest chains that happen in quick enough succession that this code can be triggered. This is obviously a stop gap measure while Arenanet fixes the game to prevent players from exploiting any Dynamic Events that they have yet to properly time out and balance. This code may stay in the game for the long run, but expect it to be tuned down as Arenanet gets closer to properly tuning all of Tyria's dynamic events.

**Dungeon Reward DR**

This new anti-farming counter measure is the catalyst for recent discussion of these mechanics and for my writing of this article. Lets look at player and developer motives to try to come to an understanding on this issue.

Arenanet wants you to play their content. They spent years creating it and it would be an absolute shame for 66% of their dungeon content to be completly ignored.

Players want dungeon armor. They want it as quickly as the game allows them to get it.

So here is the problem, how do you get players to experience your content if one explorable path is clearly more efficient than the others?

The answer is that you make each path equally appealing and efficient for the player. Then, it is only a matter of preference as to which path the players take. This is a no brainer, but to acutally reach this balance is a true challenge. So while Arenanet tries to solve the problem properly they have implemented some changes that will force variety until they can balance content. It is important that there is variety or else players who want to do inefficient paths with never find willing parties outside of friends and guildmates.

In summary, story mode was never meant to be a cash farm, players are being forced to play different explorable paths until Arenanet can properly tune them, and players who do figure our ways to do dungeons in under thirty minutes are being discouraged until Arenanet can find and fix the exploits that allow this to happen.

~~~~~

Players are never forced to be inactive by these mechanics. If you experience drop DR, then switch to a different enemy type that drops the same material. If you experience DE DR, then do anything in the game other than events for a few minutes. Take solace in the fact that Arenanet will eventually tune up events, so you can adventure as you please. And now it should be obvious to you how to completely avoid Dungeon DR. Alternate between two or more explorable paths and don't use exploits that trivialize the content.

It is important that these counter measures are put in place in the meantime to prevent inflation in the markets. If one small group of players finds a technique to become super rich, then the rest of the player base must use that techinque or be unable to afford anything on the market. That is bad.

I hope this article helps those who lacked understanding of these issues, and calms those of you who are afraid that Dungeon DR and DE DR are here to stay in their current form. Dungeons will be tuned. DEs will be tuned.

**TLDR; Many of the new mechanics meant to affect player behavior are stop gaps until better systems can be found. Please be patient while Arenanet solves these difficult issues.**

As a result of certain exploits which involved jumping, we have removed your ability to jump altogether.

**Events**
Fixed a bunch Orr events. For the 5th time. Maybe.

**The Ruined City of Arah**
*Seer Path: Fixed an exploit where rangers using longbows could trivialize a fight by attacking at max range, and the Melandru boss would not fight back. Players will now discover that it is trivial without the use of an actual ranger.

**Fractals of the Mists**
Cliffside: Fixed an issue where players could damage the final seal with their normal attacks. To punish you all, this fragment is no longer completable.

Cliffside: Fixed an issue where players were able to attack and kill the first boss before triggering the cinematic that you'd like to skip anyway.

**WvW**
Invisible &amp; invulnerable players can no longer contest capture points in WvW because invisible or invulnerable players aren't real. WvW capture points now follow the same rules as PvP capture points.

Obsidian Sanctum now 300% more frustrating.

**Heart of the Mists**
Battle of Kyhlo: The hit box on the trebuchets has been decreased so that they are less vulnerable to certain AoE skills and now truly untargetable by melee users.

Forest of Niflhel: (new string)

**Items**
Runes of Balthazar and Orrian now properly apply quickness when the player is struck and below 20% health. We're almost done testing runes, guys! Cheers!

**Commerce**
Fixed an issue with the Boxing Glove skills remaining when players swap to armor from town clothes, which dramatically increased the risk of purchase.

Total Makeover Kit and Self-Style Hair Kit added to the Black Lion Chest as rare rewards. Really rare rewards. Like, really really rare.

**Elementalist**
Updated elementalist conjured weapons to appropriately apply attributes to all players that pick them up. Sadly, we couldn't get around to actually making them worth picking up in the first place.

Evasive Arcana: This trait now has a blast finisher while attuned to earth. Now 25% as good as it used to be!

Elementalists will no longer get into a state where they aren’t attuned to any element. This commonly results in the player’s skillbar being empty. As opposed to granting you the ability to cast 4 skills at once, obviously.

**Guardian**
Ring of Warding: This skill will no longer affect non-attackable NPCs. This fix was soo much simpler than just having the NPC's walk back to their location, oh if only you guys knew!

**Mesmer**
Updated the description for Blurred Frenzy to indicate that it gives evasion through “Blur,” instead of “Distortion”. Renamed from ""Blurred Frenzy"" to ""Distorted Frenzy"".

Phantasms will now properly have all boons applied to them via player traits. Phantasms are people too.

**Ranger**

This is how infusion worked in GW1: 
[Infusion](http://guildwars.wikia.com/wiki/Infusion)

This is **all** we know about how Ascended armor and Infusion will work in GW2:
&gt; Speaking of rewards, the Fractals of the Mist Dungeon will introduce the new ‘Ascended' item type. This type is a bit more powerful than the Exotic quality items currently found in the game. There will only be a couple of Ascended quality items available initially, but some of the rarer Ascended items will also feature a new Infusion slot that **will make players even more powerful so that they can tackle new challenges that ArenaNet plans to throw at them as they continue to expand on the dungeon** over the coming months and years.


Doesn't that make it sound like Ascended armor/Infusion will work very similar to how it worked in GW1? To me it looks like we can expect this to only affect PvE, and only works to increase damage vs. certain mobs, or decrease damage taken from certain mobs. Either way, that is not a gear treadmill, and would make it completely optional. Until we have **facts** stop getting crazy, please. 

Also, think about how challenge missions worked in GW1. The longer you lasted in the mission, the higher your score. There was a ladder along with them that allowed you to see the players with the highest scores - I knew that these players had higher scores because they were better at the mission than me, and impressively so. The fact that they had a higher score had no effect on me whatsoever as a player, other than showing me that I could get better. I liked that. To me this armor simply sounds like a way to progress further into this new dungeon, and I'm fine with that.

""Hey you!"" 

Hello there and thank you for joining this discussion. Let me begin by saying that I'm really looking forward to playing Guild Wars 2. I enjoyed the BWE a lot.

The PVE was fresh and for the first time since, many many years I enjoyed questing with the Dynamic Events system. 

The World vs World system was a dream come true, the type of mass world pvp that has been promised in other games but never delivered. 

Surely both the PVE, PVP and WvW will get some polishing, but there is one part of the game that I'm really concerned about. The chat system. 

Q: *""Oh but surely nobody cares about chat, It's all about PVE, PVP isn't it? The chatsystem should be lowest on their priority list shouldn't it?""*

A: If this was a game like Gears of War 3, counterstrike or mario kart online, I would agree. But it isn't, it's an persistant world MMORPG. And in such a game the chatsystem is the tool by which we communicate, and communication is the lifeblood of the MMORPG. It is what sets it apart from the single player world. It is what creates the impression that you are part of a living breathing world with real people who inhabit it, instead of silent ghosts who just press buttons. It is what creates the community, and the sub communities which make these MMO's so wonderful and addicting. 

** The current chat system is an insult to this otherwise wonderful and spectacular game. ** 

Basically, the current chat system looks like someone ripped it out of some third rate homebrew mmo that was created in a third world country by a few people in someones basement.
 

**Some of the issues with it.** 

- Ugly. 

- Highly inflexible. No option to change colors, no preferences to tailor the chat to your own needs. No way to relocate the chat system or change the sizes or the fonts.    

- Bugged. Of course /team was bugged as reported and there where tons of bugs with whispers, guild chat and such. These have all been reported and acknowledged by Arenanet so I do expect these to be fixed. 

- /local is not local, its a zone wide chat. Really confusing because at times I saw people who where on the other side of the zone (and the zones are huge in case you didn't notice) having personal conversations that everyone in the zone could hear. 

- lack of a real /say and /yell chat. 

A short range chat is needed to communicate with people in your direct vicinity. Whether that is to talk to a group your just doing a quest with, or to communicate tactics to the few people around you during a small tower siege in WvW, or just because you want to roleplay in Divinities Reach, a short range chat is a necessity. 

It is even more of a necessity in this game because what GW2 does is it allows you to play alone while still playing in groups. In other words, you don't need to create or join a group to play together. A genius system, except that because you don't use /group chat, you now need a /say even more. You need a way to easily get the attention of some passerby, both in PVE with its dynamic quests and in WvW where sometimes a small team can make things happen. You need a ""hey you!"" in this game more then in other games. 


- chatbubbles
This really is the follow up to a /say chat. In order to easily pinpoint where text is coming from, we need chatbubbles (as a toggle option so people who don't like them can turn them off). Chatbubbles easily show you who is speaking and where the speaker is. It is a wonderful addition in PVE, PVP but also roleplay where it is seen by many as main important feature especially during big RP events. But its not just roleplayers that need them, its everyone that can find use for them. To speak to people around them, to ask for help (and get response too because people in the vicinity see who it is that is calling) and many other things. 

Arenanet has indicated that GW2 wouldn't be released until ""It's done"". In my opinion, and I understand not everyone might agree with me, it's not done until it has a fully functioning communication system that is worthy of the product. As a bare minimum, this next generation game should have a chat system at least as advanced as WoW (a 7 year old game with a chatsystem that makes GW2 current chatsystem look like it's from the stone age). But I'd be thrilled if they took the extra step to make it even better (but not counting on it). 

So let yourself be heard. Do you agree here, are there parts I'm missing or forgot? Other ideas for the chatsytem that Arenanet could perhaps implement?

I've also made a thread on their official forums about this, or at least about one part (the chatbubbles). Once the beta forums are up again feel free to support that at:

https://forum-en.guildwars2.com/forum/game/suggestions/Chatbubbles/page/1

Let's make ourselves heard now and make sure that this AAA quality game doesn't launch with a third rate chatsystem that acts as a barrier to your ability to communicate with people around you. Let's make sure that this game is launched with a chat system that at its bare minimum is comparable with the chat system of last generations AAA games. A game that makes communicating with the people around you a joy instead of a gamble.

###TESTED


**Does condition damage affect Mesmer illusions?**

&gt; Yes, I put illusion-inflicted bleeds on one training golem, and Sigil of Earth bleeds on another. When I refunded my traits to reduce condition damage, both damage ticks decreased accordingly. This also means stats are taken from the character at time of damage, not the time the bleed was applied.

**Does condition duration stack linearly? From only some sources or from all?**

&gt; Yes, it seems so. Using varying combinations of bleed- and condition-duration enhancing gear I concluded that they are additive. 15%+15% duration equals 30%. 

**Do fractional amounts of condition duration give any benefit for bleeds?**

&gt; It does not seem so. By that I mean, you will not notice a damage increase going from a 3.0 to a 3.4 second bleed.

**Who does the ""remove condition"" combo remove conditions from?**

&gt; ""Remove Condition"" is done by projectile finishers, and is removed from allies adjacent to the enemy.

**For raw damage, which is best, Power, Precision or Crit Damage**

&gt; For raw damage, power scales the absolute best, followed by precision and lastly crit damage. However, stat parameters ingame are limited in range and you will not be able to spec 100% power. A full set of Berserker gear has the highest DPS most of the time. At times, high condition damage sets can do more damage in specific builds that have little plain damage.

**How do sigils on two different one handed weapons work?**

&gt; Both work, but sigils have internal cooldowns that mess with each other. Bloodlust and similar sigils will not go above 25 stacks, and on-switch and on-crit sigils will not work  together due to shared cooldowns. Similarly, you can't use two of any on-crit sigils together. Bonuses apply to all skills on your character, not specific weapon skills.

**Whose condition damage value is used for guardian virtues**

&gt; Tested, the stats of the person receiving the buff.

**Whose condition damage value is used for combo field conditions?**

&gt; The stats of the person who used the finisher.

**How do stacked combo fields work?**

&gt; This seems to be a tricky one. Of course only one effect fires, but which? I've been able to verify that it doesn't seem to be determined by which one is on top, bottom or closest (for overlapping. projectile is first-field-hit) to you. This requires more research. Consult your Infinity Ball.

**When using spirits, do their effects scale off of my stats or my ally's stats?**

&gt; As the answers above: ally's stats.

**Is boon duration cumulative between players?**

&gt; It does not seem so, duration is determined by the player that applies it.

**Are diminishing returns gone?**

&gt; No. Certainly not on dungeons as can be easily verified.

**Optimal stacks of confuse to kill a heartseeker spamming thief?**

&gt; (WvW) At 1000 condition damage, you would inflict 280 damage per stack per attack. Assuming a thief can pull off 4 heartseekers in a row, with a health of 16k, you would need about  14-15 stacks to outright kill him. However, good luck applying anywhere over 10 stacks as you are being ganked.

**Will we ever see the results of this mythbusting effort?**

&gt; Up yours.




###PRESUMPTIONS / NOT TESTED


**To which ""family"" belong dungeons' monsters?**

&gt; ~~They belong to the corresponding sigil for that dungeon. e.g. all mobs in CoE count as Inquest.~~

**Does the Black Lion salvaging kit have a lower chance of giving Ectoplasm than a Master's kit?**

&gt; No reason or evidence to assume it is any lower. If anything, it seems to be higher.

**Does more than 100% magic find appear to work?**

&gt; There is no reason to assume magic find is capped at 100%. 

**Does equipping a precursor make the legendary soulbound when created?**

&gt; Probably not.

**Does precision affect the critical chance of healing?**

&gt; As far as I am aware, the concept of crits does not apply to healing.

That wraps up the first session. Special thanks to Kuper, the manly black Norn Necromancer, for testing out some of these.

1373056194.0,467,self.Guildwars2,1hplcj,The balance issues with GW2 are not on the player end,564,97,276,http://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/1hplcj/the_balance_issues_with_gw2_are_not_on_the_player/,"I made this comment [elsewhere](http://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/1hloge/warriors_you_cant_crit_world_bosses/cawbtzk?context=1), and for asked to make it a standalone post.  So here it is with some expanded ideas.

Right now, if you looked at CoF1, you would conclude that GW2 was horribly imbalanced.  Warriors everywhere, Rangers don't get invited to dungeons, and no one runs a healer build.  And you'd be right, to an extent.  GW2 PvE is imbalanced because of the kinds of monsters we fight.

I mostly play sPvP now, with some WvW on the side, and in sPvP, pretty much every class is viable.  Some are a little more ""required"" than others, but you would never send 5 of one class in and expect to dominate.  This is because the trinity in sPvP is extremely well implemented.

GW2 has a Trinity, just like they said.  Except instead of DPS, it's Damage (with a subset of DPS, Burst, Condi, and AoE), Control (With a subset of CC and debuffs), and Support (with subsets of healing, damage boosting, condition removal.)

These sets are finely balanced against one another.  Guardians, to use one example, form a triangle of burst, bunker, and pressure/DPS in a kind of rock/paper/scissors about who will beat whom.  There's no one true build, as it should be!

I run a low DPS guardian, and I can still contribute massively to fights because my CC knocks people off the all-important control points.  CC matters.  Knockback matters.  Lockdown matters.  No one on my team wants me to switch to DPS because CC is great.

The kinds of things we face in PvE though completely change the way we play.  Human players, at least the good ones, are canny and adaptable, they run away at low health if they can.  They swarm with greater numbers.  Sometimes they have to hold a chokepoint to let allies capture a point.

Monsters... aren't.

Let's look how the trinity fares when applied to the kinds of things you face in a typical dungeon run.  The dungeons I am MOST familiar with is CoF P1 and all the paths of CM.  Most of those are dominated by either big brutish bosses, or ""silvers"".  Also, I'll talk a bit about world bosses.

Now let's talk damage.  DPS matters, obviously.  Let's set that as a baseline.  AoE sometimes matters, but not against big bosses.  Ok, that's reasonable.  Burst damage ends up being completely useless against monsters where the HP pool is large.  Burst damage is amazing against monsters who can heal.  Take the Blue/Red Lord in the Foefire sPvP map.  He has a self-heal that, if you hit with enough burst damage, he cannot use.  But silvers and higher have so much HP that burst damage is pointless -- might as well have brought DPS.

As far as condition damage goes, that's kinda useful in a dungeon.  On a world boss, you can forget it.

So we've already got two or three playstyles severely limited.  On big bosses, AoE is useless without adds.  Burst damage, the cause of so much kittening in WvW, does nothing in a dungeon.  Condi damage is questionable at best.

DPS rules the day.

But there are still two other lets of the trinity.  What about support?

Support (at least offensive support) isn't totally unused. Those zerker warriors aren't just hitting, they're also buffing one another for fury.  This is not bad.  Defensive support, like a water staff elementalist, doesn't see much use though.  Why?  Probably because in an attempt to ensure you never need a healer, the game more or less ensures you never need defensive support.

Almost all attacks can be dodged.  Healing?  Well it's useful, but everyone brings enough self-healing that a water-staff ele (my one true love) might as well not even show up.  Condition removal?  Bosses don't apply enough conditions to matter.  Better to bring more damage, probably DPS.

And then we get to control. The way defiant works sucks. I understand why 80% of CC is intended to not land: because one boss versus five players means CC is five times as effective as a fair 5v5.  However what really happens is that players don't even bother.  Most big bosses can't be knocked back.  Most small monsters aren't worth CCing because there's nothing to CC them into.  CC tends to be a delaying tactic, which is fundamentally less effective than smacking a monster until he's dead.

Better to bring more damage, probably DPS.  See the pattern here?

Thing is, I'm fairly sure all of this could be fixed.  It would be fixed by making bosses bring a lot more bullshit, and I suspect it might make players unhappy, but here's the thought.

First of all, bosses need adds.  Adds make burst damage more useful.  Adds make AoE way more useful.  And second, give monsters a self-heal that actives (once) at the last sliver of health.  That would mean access to burst damage to prevent the self-heal ends the fight a little faster, with players hanging onto their best attacks until the very last moment.  Suddenly the thief tactic of HEARTSEEKER, HEARTSEEKER, HEARTSEEKER has some use inside the dungeon too.  Not for the whole fight, just when you see the self-heal about to proc.

This is stuff that will make the zerker warrios go ""that's bullshit!"" but I'm ok with that.

Bosses need to apply the occasional bits of damage or conditions which can't be stopped in a narrow radius around them.  Nothing which causes automatic death, mind you, just enough that your melee DPS needs to decide between standing next to the boss and taking the pain, OR withdrawing for a few seconds.  In this way, a healer increases effective DPS, but isn't strictly necessary.  Do you want 3 warriors wailing on the boss 70% of the time, or 2 warriors wailing on him 100% of the time?

Even better, applications of weakness in an unblockable field would make a condition removal class supremely useful.  Weakness reduces DPS but it doesn't kill.  Now a water ele can make his zerker warrior buddy more effective by canceling extra weakness pulses.

Then we get to CC.

As much as players hate the ""guard this NPC while he tries to do something"" missions, at least they make CC builds worth something from the knockback.  What would be even more fun would be ""own this circle"" type of jobs.  The kind of thing where killing the monsters is ONE way to do it, but pushing them out via CC is faster.  Now you have a tradeoff.  Do you want the CC build for that part?  Is it worth the DPS loss for later?

Finally, defiant needs an overhaul.  It should not require players to communicate via mic to plan 1-2-3-4 weak attacks, and now here's the one which matters.  Imagine if CC was turned into its own highly effective mini game. For example, bosses might have stability most of the time, but every now and then they fire off a highly powerful, difficult to dodge attack on the whole party. A second before they do it, they're in a ""windup"" phase where CC -- blindness, knockback, etc, totally wiffs the attack.  Now you have a hammer guardian sitting there on his 4 skill just waiting for that move to show up, so he can save the party instead of making them all withdrawn.

What if bosses dodged every now and then, instead of having a giant HP pool. Suddenly immobilize becomes super useful. Most importantly, you don't need multiple CC people to do this, just the one. CC doesn't stack in effectiveness.

I'm not saying we need and end to all DPS, but it would be nice if the party had a reason to bring burst damage, a reason to bring AoE, a reason to bring CC and support healing.  Ideally, five zerkers should be able to finish the dungeon.  Support should not be mandatory.  CC should not be mandatory.  But a good control build should make DPS players go ""oh sweet, you can hit him before he does his telegraphed dodge, that means more damage for us!""

Again, notice that all of these changes I'm proposing are changes on the boss end of things. None of it involves changing the way players work, because the way players work is great in sPvP.

**TL;DR** we have an abundance of one kind of enemy: a big dumb non-dodging non-healing single-target bag of hitpoints that ignores most CC and doesn't reliably apply conditions that players can't dodge.  If ANet would change the kinds of monsters that we face, and the kinds of player builds required will change with it.

**Edit:**  Everyone telling me that AR is an example of a dungeon which gets this more correct than before.  I'll give it a try with my sPvP team and see how that works out.

1376057570.0,469,self.Guildwars2,1k0y6p,"After the Queen's Gauntlet, is it finally time to remove Defiant from the game?",584,115,170,http://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/1k0y6p/after_the_queens_gauntlet_is_it_finally_time_to/,"Or at least change it to make it more interesting.

**What is Defiant?** Defiant is the mechanic where whenever a CC ability is used on a boss, they gain stacks of Defiant that make them immune to further CC. The stacks can only be removed by wasting CC moves on the boss. This is to prevent content from becoming trivialized by players chain-CCing bosses so they are unable to fight back.

**Why is it a problem?** There already is a way to trivialize content, and that is full glass cannon/berserker DPS killing end game bosses before they can really do anything. Meanwhile support and controlling builds just take a much longer time to clear most difficult fights, because a good chunk of their loadout is useless on the boss. For non-glass cannon parties, combat becomes reactive (dodge attacks, stay out of red rings) instead of active.

**Why remove it now?** The Queen's Gauntlet and the open world QJ Champions really made me wonder--is this mechanic really necessary? Those bosses are quite difficult and challenging but do not have the Defiant mechanic at all, which really increases the strategies you can use. Granted they are all typically fought by a single player, but the lack of Defiant makes them feel like 1v1 PvP fights, which is awesome.

**Reasons to remove Defiant**

* Defiant discourages skills that exclusively control enemies, even skills that might be useful on non-Champion/Legendary mobs. This reduces build variety.

* Defiant forces groups to focus on DPS and reactive play instead of active play.

* We already have large fights where parties &amp; zergs face off against other powerful enemies without Defiant--PvP &amp; WvW--and while chain stunning is a viable strategy it is in no way overpowered. We already know that this can work.

* The removal of Defiant can increase the complexity of Dungeon &amp; open world boss fights to require the use of CC and generally make them more fun, instead of DPS/Dodge races. Right now, almost no fights require CC because of how unreliable Defiant stacks are to control. There are several fights in the Queen's Gauntlet that benefit greatly from CC moves (pulls against Liadri, chain stunning the Windcaller to stop her from spawning so many whirlwinds, knocking back Chomper to keep him from getting to the meat for buffs). Every class has access to plenty of CC, many of them passive CC skills on their existing weapon loadouts they already use for DPS.

**Alternative to Removing Defiant**

* **Defiant doesn't appear until a certain number of CC moves are used on the same enemy within a certain window of time, and then it fades automatically after time passes.** Defiant is still a valuable mechanic in huge zerg PvE fights against against non-structural world bosses (Dredge Commissar, Ulgoth, etc)--with so many players it would be true that the the enemy would just be totally locked down without any active play from the players fighting it, they'd be using so many passive CC effects the boss would be totally disabled. Adding some kind of zerg check threshhold to trigger Defiant if too many CCs are used within say 3 seconds could continue to cover these bosses. The duration of Defiant could continue to increase as long as the same CCs/second continue to be used after the buff first appears, so this could add some strategy--go ahead and CC the boss, but if Defiant appears, stop CCing to let it wear off. 

The threshhold could be set low enough to keep the risk of triggering Defiant in smaller PvE fights like Dungeons; this would keep the active controlling play, but require controller classes to space out their CC moves instead or risk triggering Defiant. Structural world bosses (with the big red targets) are already immune to CC and I think that's fine.

* **Alter or Remove Defiant, but keep the resistance to Blind** Blind would still be overpowered in Dungeons (some classes can keep up Blind constantly) and so the Blind resistance should remain even if Defiant is removed or changed.

**tl;dr: Defiant is an outdated mechanic that reduces build variety, PvE fight complexity, and fun in general. As the PvE meta has developed, it's becoming clear it's not really needed to keep the game balanced. It should be removed entirely or changed so that it triggers only when too many CCs are used at the same time, and then it should fade after time passes.**

**EDIT: I've copied and pasted this to the Suggestions forum, but I really wanted to post this to gauge the reddit community's reaction and see if anyone has some alternative ideas or good reasons to keep Defiant around.

1349069565.0,472,self.Guildwars2,10qywq,"Abusing Consumables, a guide.",642,170,190,http://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/10qywq/abusing_consumables_a_guide/,"Many people underestimate or simply ignore the random and often seemingly useless consumables they find on the occasional PvE vendor.  While some are cosmetic or impractical, others can be game breaking if used properly.  

I'm quite bored with the game and will give you my list of consumables, where to find them, and how I recommend utilizing them.

[Ash Legion Spy Kit](http://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Ash_Legion_Spy_Kit): Purchased from Kyra Sharptracker in Plains of Ashford.  Let's start with the king of cheap consumables.  Pop this, and you instantly vanish for 10 seconds, provided you don't move.  However you Can use it while moving and you will still get a few seconds of invisibility.  NO cooldown (what?).  You can keep popping these to stay invisible as long as your supply lasts.  At a cost of 28 karma per pop, they are very affordable.  Reviving a fallen ally in a dungeon?  Pop one.  I use them if I get locked in a knockdown combo by the Husks in Twilight Arbor.  They are especially annoying for opponents in WvW.  You shouldn't go down in small skirmishes in WvW as long as you have these.  The applications of such easily spammable invisibility are many. This combos well with other consumables and I'll touch more on that later.  Edit:  Does not work in WvW :(

[Ogre Pet Whistle](http://www.gw2db.com/items/62330-ogre-pet-whistle):  Purchased near Gladefall Run in Iron Marches.  This is decent.  Gives you a random ranger pet for 5 minutes.  Only one at a time but as soon as one goes down you can use another.  Edit:  There are some reports that the whistle is now gone, sorry yall.

[Tier 5 Boon of Regeneration](http://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Boon_of_Regeneration):  Purchased near Breekeelee POI in Bloodtide Coast from Muirikroomk (underwater).  Gives you decent health regen and lasts quite a while, handy to have.  Edit:  I've been informed that this NPC's inventory has been disabled as of last week.

Experimental Teleportation Gun:  Purchased from an Asuran at the Valance Tutory WP, Timberline falls.  The portal aspect is nice, but what I really use it for is the rocket jump aspect of the gun.  Some classes have a similar ability already but this gives you a secondary way to cover a large gap and allows friends to travel through the portal if they are following you in a jumping puzzle.  As a Mesmer I use it when my blink is down to evade enemies.  You can use the Ash Legion Spy Kit immediately after you start your jump, to become invisible while you're in the air.

[Miner's Explosive Charge](http://www.gw2db.com/items/50027-miners-explosive-charge):  Purchased from Dianna in Kessex Hills.  These are lots of fun.  Set it, wait 10(feels more like 7) seconds and you get a nice AOE knockdown explosion.  You can set these and Remain completely invisible using the Spy Kit.  Sneak behind the zerg in WvW and wreak some havoc ;)

[Charr Mine](http://www.gw2db.com/items/49696-charr-mine):  Purchased near Raintimber Mill in Diessa Plateau.  Applies a nice burn to enemies that step on these.  Very nice in condition damage builds and they're very cheap.  Why not set one before a difficult pull in a dungeon? 

[Seed Turret](http://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Seed_Turret):Purchased near the Thorp Waypoint in Caledon Forest.  Another good one to drop in or before a difficult fight.  Gives you 3 different options of turret-one heals, one slows, and the other does damage.

[Dam Debris](http://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Dam_Debris):  Pick some up from Foreman Flannum in Queensdale.  Single target knockdown ability with no cooldown.  Enemies in Dungeons will become immune after the first knockdown.  Go piss off people in WvW with them.

Alright those are most of the consumables I use regularly.  There are a few others that I didn't mention but these I've found to be the most useful.  The process of quickly opening up your inventory and using these can be automated, but you may get banned for doing so.  I don't think you'll be particularly high on the ""to ban"" list, but you never know.  I recommend an easily accessible inventory keybind.  

Edit:  Wow thanks everyone, I've never had a post go past about 5 upvotes.

1346216779.0,466,self.Guildwars2,z07f4,A (former) hardcore WoW raider's perspective on GW2,664,198,405,http://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/z07f4/a_former_hardcore_wow_raiders_perspective_on_gw2/,"First off, my WoW career. I played the game from launch day until the week after my guild killed hard-mode Deathwing (February of this year), with a one year hiatus for a deployment to Iraq in 2005. I got into raiding near the end of Vanilla with a 20-man guild that ran ZG and AQ20 in preparation for TBC. By the end of TBC I was in a guild that consistently ranked top 100 in the world, top 50 in the US, and stayed with that guild until I quit the game. I am one of those players that believes TBC was the pinnacle of the game, and that it has consistently been dumbed down in the years since. With that said, this is what I think of Guild Wars 2 after having played since headstart began, with my level 38 Norn Warrior (yeah, yeah, generic I know, but I have always made the archetypal warrior class my first character in any RPG, eventually I will branch out and probably find something more enjoyable).

The game is, quite simply, absolutely amazing, nearly perfect in every regard. Launch issues aside (even still extremely minor, it is easily the second smoothest MMO launch I have been a part of next to Rift), I haven't had this much fun in an MMO since 2005. 

* Skills that change based on your equipped weapon. Holy shit! This was a phenomenal idea. I have to say at first I was a bit skeptical being limited to only 5 skills at any given time, and having the same 3 skills for 1hers, 2 for off-hands, and the same 5 for 2hers, but I absolutely love playing around with 1h/oh combinations to find the perfect set of skills for a particular fight, and hot-swapping weapons for situational use is just genius. I find myself constantly completing a fight and thinking, ""What weapon combinations could I have used to make that fight easier or less stressful?"" Where I once thought we were being restricted, I now realize that this system adds an extra level of depth to character development and even to matching my own play style (right now my favorite combo is 1h sword/oh shield, and 1h mace/oh warhorn). It is the same with slot skills. I constantly find myself messing with skill combinations to find what works best. Am I solo? Am I with other people? Do I need survival, or do I need DPS? There is no correct answer.

* The combat. At first it was a bit simplistic. I could sit there and just beat on a mob and eventually it would die before it killed me. As I am progressing more into the higher level areas I am finding that I am required to be more tactical in my thinking. My weapons choices matter. My performance in the fight matters. When I dodge and when I activate abilities matters. There are no rotations, there's no button mashing. It's pay attention and know your class or die.

* The environments. Just... wow. Everywhere I go I find something new and fun to explore. Where does this cave end? What's behind that mountain? What's on top of that mountain? I can't help myself but go look, I feel compelled to find out, because I know there's always a reward, even if it's just a chest with some crappy Fine item that I can't even use. The stellar graphics just make it that much better, I was a bit surprised to see that the game is DX9 considering it looks just as good as some of the DX11 games out there. Though, I wouldn't mind if ANet got to work on a DX11 client (wink wink, nudge nudge).

* The ""questing"" system and story. I may ruin the circlejerk here, but at times it really is merely, ""Go fetch 20 boar butts,"" just cleverly masked as not being fetching 20 boar butts. The point is, even if that is all the Renown Heart requires, the game gives you a multitude of other things to do while you are fetching those 20 boar butts. Boss events, invasion events, NPC dialog, and eventually those 4-5 event strings that all tie together in later zones. I love that there's no quests to be tracked, no real metrics by which to gauge progress, and that there are several different ways to complete an event. The bottom line is that by pushing exploration the vast majority of these events and Renown Hearts are things that I would have been doing anyway, and in that way the ""questing"" just becomes part of the experience, not a means to an end, and that is the true innovation of this system that sets it apart from MMOs like WoW, Rift, and SW:TOR. In regard to SW:TOR, the story mode is leagues ahead. Fully scripted dialog (as opposed to SW:TOR's repetition of a few tens of lines), interesting characters, highly developed lore. This is the first MMO since WoW that I have been interested in the backstory (and WoW was mostly because I came to it as a WarCraft 3 player). I actually care why the Dredge hate the Priory, and why the ghosts of Ascalon and the Flame Legion are giving the Charr shit. I like Eir Stegalkin, I care what she has to say. Crusader Thurkill is a total bro, I'd love to share a pint of mead with him once we've saved the Priory together.

* Lastly, the thing that I expected not to like, and was actually fairly outspoken against it during the beta weekends for various reasons (primarily because I like feeling overpowered as a high level in a lowbie zone), the down-leveling system. I take back every negative thing I said about it, it is a wholly welcome design change. Yesterday I found myself behind in my crafting, yet woefully short of Copper and Green Wood Logs. Well, the Trading Post is down, what am I to do? Hey, I hadn't ever checked out the Charr starting era, not even in beta, fuck it I'm going to go farm there. An hour later I found myself striving toward 100% map completion of the Plains of Ashford, farming my crafting materials, but at the same time still gaining experience, enough experience to actually gain a few levels in my mid-30s, while still having a bit of an advantage over the lowbies because of my Trait and Slot Skill point allocations. I was humbled by that experience and that is the point that I was convinced that ANet knows exactly what they are doing.

I am absolutely flabbergasted by the game. At every turn something else amazes me, and I am more and more convinced that this is the best $70 I have spent on a game in quite a while. I came into it expecting a more casual experience, and for all intents and purposes it is a casual experience, which is what I wanted considering I'm about to start a graduate program for a masters degree and won't have much time to devote to an MMO. But, there is a level of depth to it that is not immediately obvious, all wrapped up in an exquisitely presented package. If anyone reading this is a former WoW raider/player and is on the fence about the game, just get it. You won't be disappointed.

1358276937.0,459,self.Guildwars2,16msxo,"Portal's ""Still Alive"" - Guild Wars 2 Style",563,104,92,http://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/16msxo/portals_still_alive_guild_wars_2_style/,"Hi Again. You may remember me as the guy who did a cover of Billie Jean on the choir bells a while back. Well, I enjoyed myself so much making that, I couldn't stop myself doing another. This time, I got a bit more adventurous:

http://youtu.be/bd3wtXJmOhQ

This is a cover of ""Still Alive"" from portal, using only the instruments available in GW2 (Yes, the organ too!). However, this time I allowed myself a fully chromatic scale, which I made by editing the pitch of some of the available notes. This lets me play absolutely anything on the bells and organ, which is great.

For those interested, I got through somewhere around 40 bells in the creation of this video, mostly due to recording at tonnes of locations before picking the clips I liked best. Doing these is beginning to get expensive! Recording all the parts probably took about 3-4 hours in total, spread over a period of several days. Sound + Video editing to pull everything together took...a long time. A long, long time. Way longer than Billie Jean.

*Edit*: A few people have asked for a mp3 version of this, so I’ve uploaded it to soundcloud:

https://soundcloud.com/hecksa/still-alive-a-guild-wars-2

It should be downloadable from there, but not having used soundcloud before I can’t guarantee it. Hopefully it’s all ok. Sadly not having the video as a distraction does draw attention to the pops/crackles, but..eh…you asked for it.
Once again, thanks to Arenanet for making this possible, and also to Jonathan Coulton and Valve for creating Still Alive, a great song to work on.

*Edit 2*: Thankyou so much, everyone! So many generous people around - I woke up this morning to see two (yes, two) unbreakable bells in my inbox ingame. That's in addition to the hundreds of breakable ones I received from people yesterday...I've also had a kind offer of a free loan of an unbreakable as well. 

Anyway, since it feels just a bit greedy to keep two unbreakable bells on top of hundreds of breakables, I'd like to return all of that stuff (except for one unbreakable, obviously) to it's original owners. 

However, I have a mass of messages from people offering stuff, but don't have the full IGNs (only character names, which I can't reply to for some reason) of any of the people who actually sent things, as far as I know, so I'm unable to send stuff back. If anyone who sent stuff could send me another message ingame, including their full account name, that'd be awesome, so I could return some of the massive overkill of gifts I've received.

1347845429.0,459,self.Guildwars2,10009b,Bleeding and You: A Guide and a Warning,595,136,341,http://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/10009b/bleeding_and_you_a_guide_and_a_warning/,"As a level 80 Elementalist who is using a Bleeding-heavy Scepter/Dagger Earth build, I have become very familiar with how the Bleeding condition functions. I feel that many of the intricacies of Bleeding are not well documented, and those who do not use this particular condition don't really understand its power and limitations, so this post is intended to both educate about how Bleeding currently works, as well as to provide suggestions for how Bleeding can be made more viable as a primary damage source.

**Tl;dr**: Bleeding is very good when solo or with others who do not cause any Bleeding, but in groups with 2 or more Bleeding heavy builds, it is practically useless due to the 25-stack limit, especially in dungeons and group events. The larger the group, the more useless Bleeding becomes.

**What is a ""Bleeding"" and how much damage does it do?**

Unlike many other MMOs such as WoW, Guild Wars 2 only has a very small number of conditions (debuffs) which can be applied to a target. Each one is unique in purpose and mechanic, and so it makes abilities much easier to understand, especially when comparing cross-class. The condition this post is focused on is ""Bleeding.""

Bleeding can apply to any enemy, even if it clearly shouldn't be able to bleed, such as an Earth Elemental. One limitation to keep in mind, however, is that inanimate objects such as a supply cart or a turret cannot have any conditions, including the damage-oriented conditions such as Bleeding, Burning, and Poison.

According to the [Bleeding](http://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Bleeding) article on the GW2 wiki and verified by my own tests, Bleeding uses the following formula for damage each second:

    2.5 + (0.5 * Level) + (0.05 * Condition Damage)

For level 80s, this can be simplified to:

    42.5 + .05 * Condition Damage

This value will give you the damage per second of each Bleeding stack. A level 80 who is going for maximum Condition Damage can easily achieve a total of 1500 Condition Damage. This means each Bleeding stack is dealing 117.5 damage per second per stack of Bleeding they apply.

**Buffing Bleeding Damage**

The Might boon will provide a damage bonus to any existing Bleeding stacks on the target which were caused by the character gaining Might for the duration of the boon. The Vulnerability condition will cause the target to take additional damage from all Bleeding stacks on the target for the duration of the Vulnerability. These are worth mentioning, because in other RPG systems, often a DoT will store its own damage over its duration upon applying, and so you would want to using Might or apply Vulnerability before applying a long DoT. This is not as important in GW2, unless there are times where more DoTs are applied than others.

All of the generic bonus damage Traits which I have tested, including the Earth 25 point Trait [Enduring Damage](http://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Enduring_Damage_\(elementalist\)), will not affect Bleeding damage at all, according to my own testing. It's unclear whether this is a bug or a design decision. Given that the Grandmaster Earth Minor Trait does not boost the primary source of Earth damage, and other Boons/Conditions can do so on a per-person basis, it seems more like a bug than a specific design decision.

**Intensity Stacking**

Unlike Burning and Poison, which are the other pure damage conditions, Bleeding stacks in intensity, rather than duration. This means that if a 1 second Bleeding is applied at 50 dps, and a 10 second Bleeding is applied at 100 dps, then the target will take 150 dps of damage for the first second, and 100 dps of damage for the next 9 seconds. With my current Scepter/Dagger Earth Elementalist build, I can apply up to about 20 stacks of Bleeding on my own. I have seen Mesmer builds using duelists which can get 25 stacks simultaneously.

Stacking is where the true power of Bleeding builds shine through. With 20 stacks of bleed constantly on the target and 1500 condition damage, an Earth Elementalist can deal 2350 damage per second, not including any additional stacks of Might, Vulnerability, and direct damage applied.

**25 Stack Limitation**

An extremely important and quite possibly fatal piece of information, however, is that Bleeding can only stack up to 25 times on any individual target. This is not per-person, but per-target. According to my own experiences and tests, this limitation is imposed in the simplest manner possible: when trying to apply a new stack of Bleeding, if there are already 25 stacks of Bleeding applied, then the new stack is not applied.

The consequences of this simple algorithm are quite severe. Many people will apply Bleeding by happenstance, rather than by design of the build. A crit-heavy build uses [Sigil of Superior Earth](http://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Sigil_of_Superior_Earth) for more damage, an Elementalist is rotating through all of the off-hand Dagger AoEs, and decide they might as well use [Churning Earth](http://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Churning_Earth), or a Mesmer puts 15 points into Duelist and gains [Sharper Images](http://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Sharper_Images). They don't stack Condition Damage, and so their Bleeding, lasting anywhere from 5 seconds to 8 seconds, is applying less than half the dps of someone who is specialized into Bleeding.

This means that even just 2 people using a Bleeding heavy build will be harming each other's dps by working together. Compound this 25-50 times during a battle against Champions with large health pools, such as during Group Events or in Dungeons, and the Bleeding-heavy builds will be doing almost no damage compared to the direct-damage builds. This serves to encourage everyone to use Direct Damage during group play, rather than Condition Damage, or risk getting Bronze in an event, or wiping in your dungeon due to too low dps.

**Suggestions for Improvement**

*Improve the stack limitation value and behavior.*

1. Significantly expand or eliminate the stack limitation entirely for enemies with large health pools. This will allow Bleeding builds to be effective during those battles, and the large health pools are already designed to take significant damage from each participating member and to scale per member. This is especially important to do during Group Events and in Dungeons.

2. Change the algorithm for how the stack limit is enforced to be more optimal for DPS. I suggest the following:

    When another stack of Bleeding is applied to a target, check if the number of stacks is at the limit. If so, perform the following:

    A. Calculate the damage remaining on all existing stacks of Bleeding and store which one is lowest, not including any Boons or Conditions currently on the target which are improving that stack's damage.

    B. Calculate the total damage of the Bleeding to be applied, with the same limitation on currently existing Boons and Conditions.

    C. If the new applied Bleeding will do more total damage than the stored lowest value, replace that old Bleeding with the new one.

    This new algorithm will preserve the highest total damage by Bleeding done to a target given the limitation on how many stacks of Bleeding can exist on a target. This algorithm would at least lessen the cases where incidental Bleeding stacks are harming a Bleeding heavy build, but will not solve the issue of two Bleeding heavy builds working together.

*Make the damage conditions Bleeding, Burning, and Poison apply to inanimate objects.*

Very often, a Task or Event will require destroying inanimate objects, such as a supply cart or a turret. Condition heavy builds have a lot of trouble with these, as those targets do not gain any Conditions. If an Earth Elemental can be harmed by Bleeding, Burning, and Poison, I see no reason a supply cart or turret can't be.

*Make all generic damage boosting Traits affect Conditions applied.*

It is just strange that there are so many ways to gain extra damage through Traits, but none of them affect damage via Conditions. Why shouldn't Condition-heavy builds benefit from these Traits? It honestly feels more like a bug than a balance or design decision.

**Conclusion**

Building around the Condition Damage stat and the Bleeding Condition can be very fun and effective when solo. Additionally, many of the Traits for different classes and an entire Elementalist Element (Earth) are focused around making it viable. However, certain limitations make these builds feel ultimately inviable, to the point of trying it for a while, having fun in many situations, but ultimately switching away from it due to the seemingly arbitrary limitations imposed. Improving or removing these limitations will inspire more variety among builds, and more fun had all around.

I'm a player from Vizunah Square (FR server), and I'm a fan of the Cantha continent of GW1.
IRL, I score music for fun. I'm spending a lot of money on software for scoring music. (Virtual instruments etc.)  
  
  


Three days ago, I was pretty sad that Josh Foreman says that Cantha district on DR was removed due to cultural conflicts.

I mean, I'm waiting like a child for an expansion that will bring back Cantha, and all this eastern-mood.

&gt;I certainly encourage anyone to express your desire for a Cantha region in GW2 in a positive and friendly way. It could be years away, but it’s worth asking for.     
  
    
    





I really want Anet and NcSoft to hear the call. 
A lot of people want Cantha's return. 

So, I'm actually working on a ""fantrack"" (contraction of fanart and music track), you can hear my first hours of work results [here on youtube](http://youtu.be/gTSBZstMZss).

I'm searching support from everyone of the GW2 community : please, manifest your enthusiasm for Cantha.
By drawings, fanfics, comic-strips, podcast, music, machinimas, or simply a post on the official forum or here. 

I will update this post with all your participations.

My goal was twofold: To see how far along everyone was in the game after 1 weekend (the headstart) and to see if projections about race and profession were accurate based on previous polling. Here is the juicy stuff:

Data:

| Profession   | Count         |
|:-------------|------------:|
| Elementalist | 883        |
| Mesmer       | 489 |
| Ranger        | 717|     
| Guardian     | 770 |
| Warrior        | 896 |
| Necromancer | 519 |
| Thief            | 722 |
| Engineer      | 597 |


| Race   | Count         |
|:-------------|------------:|
| Human | 1835        |
| Charr      | 650 |
| Norn        | 850|     
| Sylvari     | 1105 |
| Asura        | 1153 |

1. [Average level](http://i.imgur.com/6QmvV.png)
2. [Level histogram](http://imgur.com/Nwtk5) (**NEW**)
2. [Breakdown of professions by race](http://i.imgur.com/HNWs4.png)
3. [Breakdown of races by profession](http://i.imgur.com/RCzt9.png)


* The average level of a headstart redditor was 23.52 (STD DEV 11.11)
* The most played race is human BY FAR
* The least played race is Charr
* The most played profession is Warrior
* The least played profession is Mesmer
* Warriors and Guardians were on average higher level
* Engineers were on average lowest level
* Humans were the highest level
* Charr were the lowest level (probably trying to escape the hometown, am I right?)

Now for the REALLY interesting stuff:

* Most humans are Elementalists
* Fully HALF of Norns polled are Guardians/Warriors
* 1/3 of Charr are Warriors, almost half of Charr are Warrior/Guardians
* 1/3 of all Rangers are Sylvari
* 1/3 of Engineers are Asura
* Charr and Norn are rarely casters. They are also rarely thieves (due to size, I'm guessing)

I find it absolutely fascinating that so many people associated certain races with certain professions. Norn and Charr are the de facto ""knight"" class (due to their size?), Sylvari are the de facto Ranger class (due to associating rangers with forests?), and Asura are the dominant engineers (due to intelligence?). It is difficult to draw conclusions from humans since there are just so many, but human seems to be the default class for non-warrior/guardians. 

Some other gems:

* Highest level player: A level 999999 human warrior. Smartass.
* Best response for level: ""19. gf actually mad and not letting me level more""

1347649047.0,460,self.Guildwars2,zw1lk,"WvWvW goes from daily to weekly resets tonight, here's a general overview WvW mechanics.",562,102,191,http://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/zw1lk/wvwvw_goes_from_daily_to_weekly_resets_tonight/,"With WvWvW changing from daily resets to week long matches, I thought I’d post a few basic concepts to help players who may be confused about the goals and mechanics of WvW. I don't profess myself to be a WvW master, but here's a run down of what I have learned.

Like most PvP scenarios in MMO games, there’s more going on than just finding noobs and slaying them. In WvW there are two ‘greater good’ assets that help your world in various manners; The Orb of Power (http://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Orb_of_Power) and Control Points (Keeps, Towers and Supply Depots). Controlling an Orb of Power offers a stacking 5% HP &amp; 50 to all stats bonus to all players in WvW, and overall Control Point ownership increases the points your world gain, which has a number of outside of WvW bonuses.

**The Maps**:
There are four WvW zones: Three Borderlands (http://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Borderlands), which all share the same map layout, and the Eternal Battlegrounds (http://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Eternal_Battleground). Each world  in your matchup has it’s own Borderlands, and each Borderland contains an Orb of Power. The basic goal for each Borderland is to control the Orb. 

**Controlling the Orbs**:
When the match resets, all worlds start with control of one Orb. It is located at the Cradle of Power, at the very north of your home world’s Borderland. There are a few fairly weak NPCs who will defend the Orb for you, but they are very easily overcome by even a small force. Once the Keeper of the Orb is defeated, the opposing worlds can take the Orb and attempt to move it to a Keep or Garrison under their control, transferring the Orb HP &amp; stat bonuses to their players. Orbs can only be stored in four locations: The initial Cradle of Power, the Home World’s Garrison and either of the Keeps on the east and west side of the map (Located as so: http://i.imgur.com/JkfYS.jpg). While the Orb is unseated, you should see the location of the Orb in real time, on both your minimap and the full screen world map. (This seems to be buggy and/or exploitable leading to the map not displaying it’s location, in these cases Team and Map chat should be used to communicate the Orb’s location to your team.) The Home world can not move the Orb at the start of the match, and the Orb can never be moved by the team that controls it. If you want to move the Orb, you must wait for an enemy team to take it and take it from them.

At the start of the game, each worlds goal should be to secure the Orb in whichever Borderland you’re playing in. If you’re in your Home World’s Borderland, you should expect that both of the opposing worlds will be moving to take the Keep on their side of the map before moving up and taking your Orb from you. If you’re in an enemy team’s Borderland, your goal should be to do the same, take a location that you can store the Orb and then obtain the Orb. With control over multiple Orbs, you offer your world the greatest bonus you can towards your world winning your match up.

**Eternal Battlegrounds**:
While the EB doesn’t offer anything that affects the overall WvW power of your realm, many players view EB as ‘the place to be’. Inside the EB each world has roughly one third of the zone that’s fairly simple to own, and the center of the map offers you find Stonemist Castle, which offers your realm a greater points bonus than a smaller Keep, or Tower, but controlling the Castle is easier said than done.

**Upgrades &amp; Siege Machinery**:
With the switch from 24 hour resets to week long match ups, be prepared for the ‘meta-game’ of WvW to alter. While under the 24h resets fostered a Zerg vs Zerg vs Zerg gameplay, you’ll likely find that people will become more willing to part with their cash to upgrade the Keeps and Towers they control, more willing to set down more defensive siege machines and, in general, play more defensively. At this point, ignoring defense can lead to your world unable to leave the spawn point, as your opposition chose to defend and upgrade while your world got left in the dust, unable to attack even the lowliest Supply Camp.

Each WvW zone has vendors who will sell you plans for a seige machine for silver, or in exchange for Badges of Honor (If you’re unsure of the use of each Siege Machine, you can find out what they’re good for here: http://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Siege_weapon). You can also obtain random plans from the Jumping Puzzles in each WvW zone.

**Communication and Awareness**:
From what I have seen, this along with ignorance to what’s going on lead to most people being confused about why their world is losing their WvW matchup. While the winning worlds often suffer from the same problems, they generally will have a guild, alliance, or a player willing to take the reins and do enough directing to get things done. Think about what’s important to your world, think about what you would do to take, or defend that objective and prepare to counter it. And double check if that Commander icon you’re following knows what they’re doing (I’ve seen a very, very low level Commander running around; don’t assume that they spent 100g on the book because they’re good and know what they’re doing).

I believe those to be the key points to WvW that aren’t obvious. I didn’t delve into much strategy, as that’s going to vary dramatically between worlds, and up to you and your comrades to put together.

The biggest growing pain we’re likely to see this week will be the slow realization that ZergvZergvZerg isn’t going to be the winning formula, and if success in WvW matters to you in the least, you’re going to need to start playing more tactically.

And, finally, if you see players flying around, or doing otherwise game breaking exploits, do your best to have fraps at the ready, or take screenshots of them doing it. Please email your information to exploits at arena dot net to help them identify and close the loopholes a small few players are taking advantage of.

Alas it is missing some vital components that most MMOs have that many players keep asking for and Anet has never answered.

If anyone has any contributions, please add them. It would be really nice to hear from Anet on this and get some closure on these items ;)

1. More emotes for role playing. There are many missing key elements missing for basic emotes / animations that we all would love to have.

2. More GUI toggle options. Having the ability to turn off hp bars / name text for all pets / minions. Having the ability to turn on/off player names and pets names for pvp/wvw mode only. Ability to view players armor / weapons (everyone being level 80 and all items yielding cosmetic differences at this point... it should not really matter should it?)

3. Small consumables bar, 5 slots. This could be toggled on and off just for simple consumables or minis. It is such a hassle to have to keep your inventory window open all the time for consumables. This bar will not count as a bag... it is just a shortcut bar for your hot items.

4. Black Lion Trading - Ability to sort by profession or ability to use item.

5. Internal Dragon Timer NPCs - It would be nice to have an NPC near the dragon spawn areas that can ""sense"" a dragon coming. They will be able to tell any player that asks, if a dragon is ""eminent"" under 30 minutes, ""soon"" 30-60 minutes, ""far off"" 60+ minutes.  This would help many players always asking about dragon time... and help everyone when a server or patch reset happens.  At this time there are external dragon timers and dragons are no real secret once you experience them once. Having the ability to do this in game would be simple to help players out because you know...many people love to continually dragon hunt.

6. Puzzling NPC - Personally, I run into players all the time that still do not know about ""jumping puzzles"" and are so thankful when you point this out to them.

One in each racial city that points to the closest / zones easiest Jumping Puzzle location (just a simple hint of what to look for, where, and a rumor) and  (One in LA that points to the eastern puzzle where you climb rocks upward)... 

The NPC would explain in a wild manner ""Hey, are you a member of the Tyrian Treasure Hunters Herold? Throughout the world are many puzzles and labyrinths full of lost lore, treasure and mysteries. In short we call them ""Jumping Puzzles"" due to the amount of toe slicing, ankle biting, and acrobatics that are required for most of them. Almost every area has a secret or two hidden away... Are you brave enough to seek them out?""   

This way new players will know about them earlier in game and also be inspired to be more adventurous and risk taking on their journey.

7. LFG Option - It easily could be done since in LA the LFG party grouping appears to already be server to server.  Let's just break out a special menu for this, have the LFG channel register to it and allow easier LFG grouping asap...  (Added from below ;) ) 

8. BLT Preview - Ability to preview items in the BLT (Added from below ;))

9. First Person View - Self Explanatory (Added from below ;))

10. Guild Features - Guild Halls and more guild features etc. (Added from below ;))

11. Change to all Dragons - Seeing as the 3 current dragons are pretty much fix scripted... Can there
ever be more depth added to them?  Would the engine allow for Shatter to land in different spots? Could
the dragons be given a 360 tail whip attack and also be unlocked to allow them full 360 attack radius? I realize the dynamics of the scripted events and precursor of the turrets, mortars etc... but imagine the challenge if
instead they were all spread out in a ring instead of a small square?   Imagine a rework to all 3 dragons
and if they could move and attack 360 degrees, be attacked from 360 degrees, had more radial attacks to prevent getting completely surrounded, and had the possibility to spawn in different locations across the map. Scripted events are nice but after so many times, predictability becomes boring (and no real challenge). The scripting engine is there... the possibilities are there...  Just think embellishing on this for the future and how
the game could drastically change in challenge. You could easily keep the same artwork, meshes, audio work but just redesign the areas completely based on this paragraph.  I personally want to see a dragon raze a village and kill all the npcs...  The Orr (shudder!) can do it all day long... Imagine a pesky dragon randomly perched on a village of its choice for the spawn window and causing havoc!  

12. More music ability - More musical instruments, removal of the grunting playing sound (on choir bell), a guaranteed way of getting instruments (yet may be very time consuming..only for the dedicated).

13. Champions Loot - Have them always drop loot or a chest. Too many champions drop nothing or white junk. Offer up the same blue loot bag that people get in dungeons... a small karma vial and a bag of coins....  or something... Just something worthy of spending up to 30 minutes killing a Champion. Killed over 100+ champions and received nothing at all....gives you the feeling of why even do it in the first place?

14. Hot swap ""Stances"" - A way you can have 2-3 set configurations of your skills, traits, possibly armor/weapons so you can swap to different play styles instead of having to visit a trainer each time and start over. {Rift had a very well designed system for a feature like this.}

Ok I am done, thanks for listening...maybe Anet will see this post, if not then keep trying I guess!

Long live Guildwars 2... Love it!

First off, thanks for your participation in the BWE2 survey event. This survey was largely put together by **JimmyBisMe** so kudos to him. As for the results, we had over **3,700** survey responses. That's a LOT of data. 


One of the problems we ran into is that with this much data, the Google docs platform was stretched to it's limit in terms of reporting, especially because we had so many big multiple selection questions. Next time, we want to use a more professional platform, which will help code and manage our data a bit better.


I've put together some high level results and charts that can be viewed in the gallery below. The title of the chart is at the top, and I've written some key finding highlights below each chart.


Here's some highlights!

* Vast majority of respondents are male (over 90%)
* The average age overall - 24 
* Average age among females - 27.5 
* Average age among males - 23.6
* Elementalist continues to be the most popular class in BWE2. About twice as many play Elementalist as played Engineer, Mesmer, or Necromancer.
* Females are significantly more likely to play Necromancer and Mesmer. Males more likely to play Warrior.
* For release, relatively fewer respondents plan to play Charr or Norn. We'll have to see if this changes if they ever let us test Asura and Sylvari
* Unsurprisingly, the likelihood to purchase gems increases with age. A fair number of people overall indicate they are very likely to purchase gems. 
* The Reddit community seems willing to wait for some more polish. One half indicate that the BWE2 candidate is somewhat viable for release. One quarter in total feel it's currently not viable, while two in ten feel it's very viable.
* ""Thief"" is spelled wrong in one chart. Those who remember the survey will know why.

I may spend some more time looking at the other questions, as there are a lot.  Unfortunately, with 3,800 records and some really big questions (i.e. which MMO's have you ever played) it would take days to clean up the data file. 


If you have any questions, or anything you would be particularly interested in looking at, let us know!

When reading it, I just felt sad for the player base. People are actually complaining that things like 'crafting 10 items' is too 'unfair' to do, the 'I Don't dodge with my class so this daily sux' really got me, they don't DODGE, a main part of the combat system? What do these players do just stand in the AOE and expect to live through it, or don't bother watching the attack animations to know when to avoid an attack?

Don't get me wrong Combo Killer was bugged agreed and getting a group of people together to actually try and pull off combo finishers successfully took coordination, even via voip it took my guilies a good hour to get everyone sorted with it, a few classes had a bigger issue with it then others. It got removed from the rotation so it's no big issue.

The core issue is here those 'vocal players' are complaining about basic features of the game, 'I don't craft' but it's OK to use it as a tool to power level, are they really expecting to buy a legendary directly from the Trading Post? It's a core feature of the game, I'd understand if the player was so used it in being a 'side feature' of other MMOs but GW2 slaps you in the face with it when it drops an item saying 'OI see this item craft with it!'..

Like I said before it's the basic stuff, that is really disheartening to see how much the playerbase apparently 'doesn't do', are most of them just skill 1 on autoattack or just using buffed up pets while they go AFK for a few hours?

As someone once said players complain even if they actually get what they want

I'd love more friends to explore the world with!  HeroOfOne.9574*

For the record, I've been playing MMOs for nearly 15 years, and I've only capped a character once.  I'm much more of an explore/create a lot of alts/social type MMO'er.  Guild Wars 2 hasn't been any different for me.  I have 5 characters, the highest is 52.

So I'm on a level 22 alt exploring Dissea Plateau.  I ""discover"" the fire temple, and hear about how you have to get in via fire legion  headquarters.  I put that out of my head, and continue exploring.  No less than 20 minutes later I stumble upon a quest that's going to attack the fire legion headquarters.  I'm doing it by myself and I'm a little under level for it, but I manage to capture it with 20 seconds left.  Then, BAM, a portal opens.  COOL!

I go to the portal, and sure enough it brings me to the fire temple.  I'm terrified because even though now I'm 23, the bad guys inside are 26-27.  Still, I manage to take a few out, do a puzzle to get some kind of sword, and then run around aimlessly.  A few minutes later, a level 80 character (who was put down to level 26) hops in, and I introduce myself as having no idea what I was doing, but that I had a sword!

She also had never been inside the fire temple.  I got excited.  Normally in MMOs, since I take so long to work my way up, I'm the one guy in the group that doesn't know the puzzles or the best strategies for dungeons/instances.  But in this case, it was two people trying to figure it out together.

Eventually, after a good hour and a half of too-close-for-comfort battles, excessive amounts of joy of figuring out the next part of the puzzle, and me finally figuring out what to do the sword, we got to what was presumably the end of the temple... where there was a Champion that the two of us just couldn't defeat.

While we left defeated unable to completely complete the temple, I left with an amazing memory of figuring out some wicked awesome puzzles put together by the team at ANet.

Now I'm sure everyone here has gone through this and think I'm lame for having so much fun with it... but it's so rare in MMOs where you're actually able to figure out something for yourself, that the fun was worth gushing about.

For the record, I hope to get a group together to go clear the temple and see what treasures lie within the champion's corpse.  :)  (I'm on Maguuma, if anyone wants to join me, heh!)

I decided to prepurchase this game for a couple reasons, the two biggest being no subscription and a world I was interested in playing in.

during my time in the beta, I noticed that a lot of the walls you find in MMOs are just not there.  

You don't have to ""go"" to the mailbox.

You don't have to ""go"" to the trading post, except to pick up an item. I was AMAZED that I could just sell anything from anywhere. Additionally, i like the ""buy"" order option.

You can dye armor anywhere you want, and you don't need to buy a bunch of dyes to do it.

Level scaling means everyone can have fun and be challenged by the content. No more ""run throughs"" of dungeons, and no walking into WvWvW as completely underpowered and useless provided you've unlocked a few skills.

All races can be all classes, and the game does not punish you with stats for making a charr necro, for example.

Classes are not forced to use a small variety of weapons. Seeing a ranger with a greatsword or an elementalist in melee with daggers made my night.  There are some limits, but there's a lot of options.

Weapon swapping more or less on the fly.

You can transmute armor so you can look the way you want.

Everyone can gather. And everyone can even gather from the same node!


If you drop a crafting skill, you retain your points in it. Additionally, cooking looks interesting. That is a skill I NEVER take.

You are not competing for mobs and xp. you still get the same amount of xp regardless if someone swoops in and starts wailing on ""your"" mob. Additionally, you will never lose control of your mob to someone else via damage counters. So if someone shows up, it's not a turf war for quest mobs.

Your bags are ""smart"" and they can sort things for you.

Account wide bank slots. No more mailing crap to alts!

Fast travel between wherever you are and a waypoint, not one waypoint to another waypoint reduces needless walking, and reduces the ""need"" or urge for mounts. I LOVE this.

skill points make me feel like I am exploring and I earned my skill point. I didn't level up and magically have a point to spend, and I didn't have to grind to it.

No quest log. I don't know about you guys, but sometimes I log into a game and see my quest log and I just get depressed. So much...to do. So many things I am not sure i even want to do!  At first, I felt like I'd been thrown into a lake not knowing how to swim. But how will I know where to go? Where did that quest go that was just on my screen?!  But after about 5 minutes, I got it and it was amazing.

Casting while moving adds fluidity, as does dodging.

There are no ridiculous looking mounts to grind for.

I don't have to grind for karma. I felt like I always had enough to get the items I wanted.

The attention to detail in the artwork is great.  There are so many little things to notice, from reflections, to textures, to small bits of movement, to lighting, to the epic scale of some locations.  It makes going places fun!

I think GW2 was the first time in an MMO I wasn't thinking ""now what am I supposed to do?"" and instead I was thinking ""now, what do I want to do?"" There are some limits, of course, but overall, I felt much more in control of my time than I am used to.

EDIT:  This topic really blew up :-).  To people considering the game, I encourage you to also look at other posts/footage/articles/interviews to help you decide. A few people have said they were buying the game based on this post, I HIGHLY ENCOURAGE YOU to do your own research!  This is just a list of the things I have found useful in my time in the BWE.

I suppose a little context would be helpful… but before I do that, I can't figure something out…	

I was trying to make this a self-post, as I heard that was the thing to do, but I have no idea what that entails… so hopefully this is right?

So back to the backstory...

My daughter asked me to get this game to play with her.  She's had it since it came out and none of her friends are into it, so I picked up a copy of the Mac beta and off I go.  I started with her about a month ago.  So flash forward a month.  My daughter plays once in a while, but I kept playing a bit every night and I have now progressed past her.  I'm looking forward to her having time to catch back up, but it puts me in an interesting position.  She doesn't know about the things I am now seeing, because she simply isn't there yet.

I'm running around to all the different areas; finding the little empty hearts, the little empty mountains, the little empty arrows and doing making sure they get filled up.  I figure at this rate I may get that neat little gold thing next to my name sometime before I die, but I'm not counting on it.  That seems to be one of the goals, so I'll keep trying.

So here are some issues that have come up on the way to going all over…

I keep seeing these little star things that say a guild officer has to do something magical to let me in.  So I figure I'll make a guild and then I can do those things.  So I make a guild, my daughter joins up, and … nothing.  I still can't open them up.  

So any help there would be great.

Then there are these dungeons I keep getting messages I can now go to.  But every time I make my way over to one, it says I need five people.  First time I figured, bah, nonsense, I'll just go take a peek.  That lasted all of thirty seconds before Satan, or something that looked like him and twenty of his friends did something where I couldn't walk or run and stood there helpless while they lit me on fire.  

So how do I do the dungeon thing?  At this point there are 4-6 I have never been in.

My first thought was, ""hey, surely I can't be the only guy who needs to go in here alone, so I'll just wait for some people to show up.""  And they did.  And they typed a bunch of stuff I didn't understand ""prty up, lomfn4"" or at least I think that's right, and then they just disappeared.  So that doesn't seem to work.  Not sure how to go in there and try one of them out?

Then people keep talking about jp?  I was in the service and we used a LOT of acronyms, but there is apparently a secret language of acronyms in this game, and darned if I know how to sort them out.  

Is there a list somewhere of acronyms used in this game?

Then I hit the b button on accident once and I found this menu to go to a world thing.  So I use that to get back to Lions Arch without spending money on the little teleports.  But I'm pretty sure there is a lot more I should be doing in there besides trying to save cash traveling.  

Any feedback on that whole part of the game would be great.

So, I couldn't stop myself seeing what was possible with the notes we were given for bell choir. Turns out, since we got a dorian scale, things are a bit more complicated than you'd expect. Billie Jean is about the only well known song around that is written in the dorian mode. So, I pulled out a piano arrangement, adapted it to fit for handbells, stripped out all the notes that the Bell Choir can't play, and then started work.

I know people were confused but I saw an awful lot of hate directed at the players trying to stay alive, when in reality it was THEIR objective to stay alive.

I also know that a few people were banned for using excessive language and threats to people who were hiding behind the legendary guards at the Black Citadel. If this happened without the bugged way-points, it would of only sped up the event since the branded would capture everything.

As many posts here on reddit and on the gw2 forums say, low level zones are actually dead and lvl 80 players has absolutely no reason to go there except if they're completing their exploration stuff. The way to improve the situation like it is now is to create some kind of daily quests/missions which would encourage players to do something else than farming fractals/orr events over and over again.

They should implement something equivalent to the Zaishen quests from GW1. For those who didnt play GW1, Zaishen quests are daily quests that will ask you to go do some stuff in X or Y zone, and those quests change every day. 

Imho, to implement it in GW2 and not totally copy/paste the feature from GW1, they could implement equivalent stuff in relationship with the Order you chose during your personal story. This would also make Tyrian Orders more ""active"" in the game, because at the moment, we just forget them once we go past our personal storyline. ( ""Hi, I am a Warmaster of the Vigil. Wait, can you tell me what the Vigil is, again?"" ).

As an example:

Every day you can get a mission/quest from your order, which would not be the same for each order, that to not to make only 1 zone overcrowded daily, and leave the rest of the world in its ""dead state"".
For instance:

Order of Whispers will ask you to go and infiltrate some Fire Legion camp and get a certain amount of documents by talking to some Flame Legion charr or by killing them in X zone, and after you get enough documents you will be asked to go and deal with some veterans or a boss in Y zone, or stuff like that.

The Vigil will ask you to do a bunch of completely other stuff and in other zones than the Order of Whispers.

Same thing for the Priory.

It would basicly be a kind of daily ""heart"" quests, which requires a little bit more time and effort than the regular ""hearts"" which take like 5 minutes to accomplish, while those Order ""hearts"" will require the player to spend something around 1 hour of playing every day and award you with some rewards like loot chests or tokens which you can spend to buy some cool stuff (like Zaishen keys from GW1 which would give you rare/exotic armor/weapons or cores/lodestones upon opening a zaishen chest ). This would also increase the amount of rares/exotics to gamble with for ectos or Mystic Forge and the amount of precursors players get and therefore decrease their insane prices on the Trading post.

This would get at least 2 problems solved ( more or less ):
 - Players will have an incentive to return to low level zones in order to do these daily quests ( and since I posted there would be at least 2 different zones for each order to visit ( or why not more ) it would make at least 6 different zones to be crowded daily which would make it more fun both for new players and veterans who are all tired of doing Fractals or stick to Orr events over and over again.

 -As I said, there will be a new way to get rare/exotic items, cores/lodestones and t6 fine craft materials which would be way more fun than grinding same stuff whole the time. Now for those chests I spoke about, don't get me wrong, I don't want them to drop exotics every time you open one, but will still have a rather good chance to drop them. Cuz honestly, prices for exotics and especially precursors are just insane at the moment. Dusk at around 450 gp, count also the lodestones who are at around 2 gp each. So, without counting the prices for globs of ectoplasm + the 250 of each t6 mat, this is already around 650 gp for Twilight? Count around 150 gp more for making the clovers + 250 ectos + t6 mats, and thats around 800 gp for your legendary greatsword. Thats just insane. Most people want to be able to play the GAME to get their legendary, and not to play the TRADING POST.

So those are my thoughs that could ( in my opinion ) improve the game experience for all GW2 players and make the game a lot more fun.

Let's hear your thoughts about how to make GW2 a better game :-)

Cheers

**EDIT**: I'd like to clarify a few things. 1. I am not a ""fanboy,"" at least not in the negative connotation. I expect good products when I pay for them, but I am also realistic with my expectations. If, according to all these assertions that this ""launch"" (which, by the way, it is not launch) is a failure, then *every* highly anticipated MMO launch in the past has been a failure. The user experience does vary, and for me I've had a good time so far. Yes, I did experience very bad lag issues last night, with a few disconnects. This was *not* bad for me in comparison to other games I've played. 2. When I say ArenaNet has done a lot for this community, what I mean is that they've been exceptional with their responsiveness to issues, questions, etc. and have been quick to listen to feedback and constructive criticism. Shouldn't this be standard for any company wishing to sell a product? Yes. Unfortunately, at least with my experience, we have many companies in the past that have fallen far below this should-be-standard when it comes to products similar to this. Also, they've gone farther than needed to do little things (see: Sanctum of Rall and the story about the father having his daughter's name implemented into the game). Do these things impact all of us? No, but it sure is nice seeing a company reach out to their community for a change. I have indeed seen a lot of negativity and posts (not necessarily here in this subreddit) that are full of useless and mean things concerning some of the issues people have been experiencing. I'm not disregarding their concerns, but I think we can be more proactive and offer constructive feedback instead of demeaning and negative comments that don't help ArenaNet actually fix these issues.",,False,self,t5_2r9po,1345944192.0,,HumanW,True,t3_yt9lp,http://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/yt9lp/lets_not_be_that_community/,

It was a human thief with completely broken armour, and it looks like the bot was employing some sort of exploit as well, rapidly teleporting up to hundreds of metres between mobs to attack. After watching for a while, the patterns and exploits became obvious. The bot would spam heavy damage moves until initiative ran out, use heal at 50% health and would use ability 4 when downed even while under direct attack.

As soon as they were defeated they would instantly release to the waypoint they were hanging around and go at it again. I really hope they were farming for gold, because a couple of friends and I made them a net loss.

We kept pulling additional mobs and going invisible (with Thief sanctuary) and causing them to aggro on to the bot. Most of the time, we managed to kill the bot without the bot making a single kill.

Yeah, we also reported it. But hell, we had fun knowing we were also making their farming less effective.",,False,self,t5_2r9po,False,,SylvariE,True,t3_zqnf8,http://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/zqnf8/griefing_a_botter/,

This is done in a point format for ease of reading. I also wrote a wall of text if you like to read that instead: http://dulfy.net/2013/06/24/gw2-sky-pirates-of-tyria-patch-preview

**Achievements**

* Around 20 achievements, divided into 3 categories 1) Kill x aetherblade pirates in various regions of Tyria, 2) Achievements for getting aetherblade cache in 7 existing jumping puzzles/mini-dungeons 3) Achievements for the new dungeon - some are for completion, others are more skill based

* Kill based achievements require you to interact with the same hologram projectors you encountered in Dragon Bash. They now have a 50/50 chance to spawn Aetherblade pirates when you walk near them (some of them will still spawn holographic minions). You can also get these achievements by killing the pirates guarding the various caches if you don't feel like running around.

* Cache based achievements are basically a bunch of existing jumping puzzles/mini dungeons with a new cache (jumping puzzle chest) placed into them. They don't give any special loot but getting them give you an achievement. It is a way to recycle content basically. You will need to do Goemm's Lab, Obsidian Sanctum, Vexa's Lab, Fawcett's Bounty, Hidden Garden etc to name a few. Some caches are located near entrance but others are located at the very end. 

* Dungeon achievements - some are the standard killing bosses achievements while others are more skill based (i.e. avoid a boss mechanic or kill the boss within a time limit). 

* Completing 12 of the achievements will reward you with a mini pet modeled after a boss in the new dungeon: http://imgur.com/a/7yOu2

* You can find a more detailed guide on Sky Pirate achievements for use tomorrow here: http://dulfy.net/2013/06/23/gw2-sky-pirates-achievement-guide

**Dungeon - Aetherblade Retreat**

* Like molten facility, if not harder. Very interesting boss mechanics not unlike raid boss mechanics seen in other MMOs
* Temporary dungeon, only here for the duration of Sky Pirates but may appear in some form later on
* You get a guaranteed rare from the boss chest and 1 gold every time you complete it. The dungeon is hard enough that Arenanet feels it is justified to give 1 gold for every completed run. 
* 5 player dungeon, will upscale players to L80 but low level players may have a hard time. 
* Boss chest has a chance to give you an exotic, tradeable monocle headpiece with berserker stats: http://i.imgur.com/MmLXHPW.jpg
* You may also find the recipe for an infinite tonic that will transform you into one of the bosses - you can jump with it and the tonic is tradeable once crafted: http://i.imgur.com/rYDUxRd.jpg

* More detailed writeup on dungeon mechanics: http://dulfy.net/2013/06/23/gw2-aetherblade-retreat-dungeon-guide

**Aetherblade Armor (gemstore)**

* I think alot of you have already seen this from datamining. You get 3 sets, one set for each armor type (i.e. light, medium heavy). They are suppose to be purchased from the gemstore I was told. 

* Unfortunately both Charr and Asura uses the male model for both sexes. 

* A gallery of the gemstore armor with different dye/race combos: http://dulfy.net/2013/06/23/gw2-aetherblade-armor
* Here is a preview of some of the armors you can expect in case you can't access the link above: http://imgur.com/a/QKgRM

**Scavenger Hunt**

* Ingame scavenger hunt to promote the launch of Sea of Sorrows book, not really part of the Sky Pirates theme.

* Need to find 12 Marriner plaques. You can find all 12 of them using clues given inside the book (or just look for them blindly like I did) . You get an achievement and one time use consumable that give you 5 skill points. 

* If you are not a fan of doing scavenger hunts on your own, you can cheat a bit using this guide: http://dulfy.net/2013/06/23/gw2-history-buff-marriner-plaques-achievement-guide

**Jumping Puzzle**

* Not released until second week on July 2.

* Can't talk about it now but I will say I had a rough time doing it so it should be fun :D

I think that is it, let me know if you have any questions etc.

Tyria has far, far, far, far, far, far too much gold.  

Our story begins [a little over 250 years ago](http://wiki.guildwars.com/wiki/Guild_Wars).  Adventurers roam the land, killing monsters, and taking their treasure.  Any significant monster has dozens, if not hundreds of gold pieces.  Random people give hundreds of gold pieces for simple errands.  Secretive wizards conjure millions of gold pieces from thin air through short-lived accidents of physics.  

As inflation spirals out of control Grenth and Balthazar begin to dispense [Ectoplasm](http://wiki.guildwars.com/wiki/Glob_of_ectoplasm) and [Obsidian Shards](http://wiki.guildwars.com/wiki/Obsidian_shard) to those they deem worthy.  Over time these entirely replace gold as the primary form of currency.  At this point, gold is valued based on its relationship to ectoplasm.  Sometimes gold is strong, at it takes only a few thousand gold pieces to buy a single glob.  Sometimes it is weak.

The [White Mantle](http://wiki.guildwars.com/wiki/White_mantle) regime is thrown into chaos by the destabilization of its money supply.  Without [access](http://wiki.guildwars.com/wiki/Temple_of_ages) to the [Underworld](http://wiki.guildwars.com/wiki/Underworld) or the [Fissure,](http://wiki.guildwars.com/wiki/Fissure_of_woe) the heathen White Mantle are unable to control or participate in the Krytan national economy.  Eventually they are overthrown by a guerrilla capitalist monarchy, [The Shining Blade,](http://wiki.guildwars.com/wiki/Shining_Blade) and [Queen Salma](http://wiki.guildwars.com/wiki/Queen_Salma) resumes her family's dictatorial reign over Kryta.

The budding government, struggling with the economic chaos left behind by the White Mantle, and with access to the Underworld and the Fissure removed shortly thereafter, faces a national crisis: [What do you do when buying a loaf of bread requires several pounds of gold?](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyper-inflation)

With gold basically falling from the sky, becoming more useless by the minute, Queen Salma planned and executed a novel scheme: institute Tyria's first [fiat currency.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fiat_currency)

[Gold coins](http://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Coin) that we know today are materially worthless.  As many people have pointed out, there is no sensible relationship between the price of [gold ore](http://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Gold_Ore) and the value of a gold coin.  This is because the value of the coin is not in the metal with which it is minted, but rather in the royal seal magically engraved on each side.  Gold itself, as we know, is so common that it is worthless.

What does this mean for us?

* [Bags of Coins](http://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Bag_of_Coins) are in fact bags of gold (as they used to be named).  The value of a large bag full of non-Krytan gold coinage is roughly 4 Krytan silver pieces.  

* Personal fortunes no longer require a [worldwide network of magical storage agents.](http://wiki.guildwars.com/wiki/Xunlai_Guild)  Banks therefore can save a lot of space, and provide [additional services](http://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Storage#Collections)

* The value relationship of ancient gold coinage to modern Krytan currency can be computed using a variety of methods, e.g. Ecto prices ratios.

* [Potatoes](http://www.gw2spidy.com/item/12135) cost as much as [gold ore](http://www.gw2spidy.com/item/19698) because gold ore is nearly valueless due to its abundance and ease of harvest.

* The currency supply is strictly controlled by the Krytan monarchy, in collusion with the Asuran high council, the Norn lodges, the Pale Tree and the Charr Legions.  This ensures that the civilizations of Tyria are not destabilized again by massive inflation.

In conclusion, all is well in Kryta.  The price of gold ore is sensible and just.  All hail the wisdom of Queen Jennah.",,False,self,t5_2r9po,1359053150.0,,,True,t3_1773oq,http://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/1773oq/a_quick_explanation_of_gw2s_currency/,

1346223449.0,417,self.Guildwars2,z0byt,This has been the most enjoyable mmo I have played in years...,565,148,335,http://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/z0byt/this_has_been_the_most_enjoyable_mmo_i_have/,"**Rant**

I've been in several mmo beta's and played several mmo's including wow, warhammer, Tera, SWTOR, and now Guild Wars 2. Not only is this the most enjoyable game I have played in a long time I can't seem to stop playing it and I even got my girlfriend into it who does not play mmo's or any games really. I've waited for a few years since the announcement of GW2 since PAX (Even have the t-shirt from the event still) and I can proudly say that ArenaNet has not let me or anyone in the community down. In my own opinion, this was the smoothest release as well as the best release of the year, regardless of what any sales reports will tell you.

**Reasons I think GW2 is the best game of the year**

* The game itself is beautiful and runs extremely well on my POS computer. I know not everyone's computer can handle it and there are quite of few crashes but it is rare that my game can handle most modern games and they did such a good job that the scenery is still beautiful and captivating.
* The unique storylines and options will make replaying much less monotonous. Although, it does get a bit tedious to go around exploring each region, there is always the option to skip it and I always find myself constantly getting side tracked by events and such as well that even that is not boring.
* I haven't reached that boring stage. I'm not like a lot of hard core gamers out there that will sit down and play for hours on end trying to level up to the max level or rush to get through the game but this game has me constantly wanting to play at all hours of the day. Seriously, when I'm not playing, I'm thinking about playing.
* Downtime? I generally expect some downtime with the first weeks of game play to smooth out issues that didn't get covered in the beta. What did those genuis' do at ArenaNet? Rolling frigin restarts/patches/builds. Minimal downtime for game play. The longest down time I think I saw was when the login servers crashed the opening night but I was headed to bed anyways (and maybe the 20-60 minute downtime tonight for some servers).
* One thing, that I find truly attractive about this game the most has nothing to do with the actual game but the content and interaction and support ArenaNet has shown the community. They keep in good contact with the community, let the majority of the voices be heard and noted, hell the thread about name banning and general rude behavior was down right hilarious and also inspiring. They are creating a community filled with no gold spammers (I'm sure there might be some eventually), mature minded people who can show their respect for one another and ensure that frustrations are not voiced in an inappropriate way (for the most part).
* The game play is unique. Each individual race and profession has it's purpose and role but at the same time can still function in a group to work as a team. There are no ""set"" we need a tank, we need this, in a group (although some classes can tank better than others). Did I mention the storyline? Each individual race has it's own storyline and you can choose different options throughout the game.....

**Dear ArenaNet/NCSoft**

Thank you for doing an awesome job, as a gamer you have done us justice and put out a better mmo than we could of hoped for. I'm sure their are haters out there but just know that your hard work to put out a quality game has not gone unnoticed (obviously). From the bottom of my heart I can say this in all of its glorious meaning: ""TAKE MY MONEY!""

**TL;DR** Guild Wars 2 is the best mmo I have ever played

**EDIT** Yes there are problems with certain features of the game such as the trading post and mail not working. ANet released a statement about disabling the mail because of an exploit which they are working on fixing. Some of these things are not an easy fix (you would know if you had any type of software engineering background!) and there is a lot of testing on their own end to ensure that these fixes are working correctly and not breaking other systems.

Regardless, those ""features"" still do not affect my opinion of the game and its fun factor. I can still enjoy the game with those systems down.",,False,self,t5_2r9po,1346353528.0,,,True,t3_z0byt,http://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/z0byt/this_has_been_the_most_enjoyable_mmo_i_have/,

1354465221.0,424,self.Guildwars2,145k35,How do you guys feel with Guild Wars 2 being one of /r/games most regretful buys of 2012?,730,306,850,http://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/145k35/how_do_you_guys_feel_with_guild_wars_2_being_one/,"**Disclaimer: I don't want this to be a bashing post. The game is worth every penny I paid for it just for WvW alone, but I want to bring attention towards the outside world, opinions from players who aren't in this subreddit.**

I was reading through [this post](http://www.reddit.com/r/Games/comments/145b1g/what_games_have_you_regretted_buying_the_most/) about what game people regretted buying most this year, and right behind Diablo 3 was Guild Wars 2. It's kind of a breath of fresh air in terms of how many people don't like the game compared to the vibe in this subreddit. Many of the comments can be boiled down to players who just won't like any MMOs in general, but GW2 was supposed to appeal to that crowd as well (according to their preview videos hyping the game). For the record, I really do like GW2, but my criticisms for the game are consistent with why people stopped playing it. For starters, it was way different from GW1 (which is good, otherwise it should have just been an expansion). But on the other hand, it dumbed down character building to sealed-deck type builds. When GW1 was on its last legs, ANet introduced a lot of strange gameplay modes like Codex and a new quest structure system in EoTN that I wasn't too fond of. They pretty much used that to beta test GW2. I adopted, but it took over a whole BWE to get used to it. I was afraid people won't want to have ""get used to it"" and end up quitting after initial impressions.

The release wasn't as smooth as it should have been. Plagued with bugs and instability. Auction services weren't working, the tutorial system wasn't too intuitive, and it was crowded and laggy. Aside from that, the game did lack a good feel for immersion that really made you want to keep doing the next step. You couldn't get lost in the story because you'd have to continuously go out and level to meet the next recommended level bracket in order to not get stomped in personal story instances. While the holy trinity removal made grouping easier, it kind of made team dynamics weaker. The combo field system isn't as brilliant as I thought it'd be. It's rarely utilized enough to make it important. There are still defense, offense and support roles, but they aren't as dependent as classic Guild Wars 1 team building.

Now, I'm more OK with it than most, but seeing how almost my entire guild from GW1 quit GW2 after the first weekend at release got me pretty angry. They didn't want to change this much. They loved GW1 and they wanted an extension of that. We were pretty big on PvP, and most of us spent thousands of hours doing just PvP and some PvE on the side. I whole hardheartedly think PvE gameplay is better in GW2, but the story is weaker. The PvP definitely isn't the same, and I tried to ease them into it during the beta by explaining my experiences so they didn't have unrealistic expectations at launch.

GW1 had its launch issues as well. The group of friends I played with loved it during pre-searing and almost all quit after they made it to Ascalon (post-searing) and saw how dry the environment got after seeing the beautiful pre-searing maps. It wasn't a huge deal overall since the game got prettier, but having to endure the barren landscape hurt their launch and potential to keep players. I ranted about this during beta when everyone here was defending that it was ""just beta"".  Initial impressions are just as important as anything else. The game could get great later, but if you had to wade through a duration of weak experience to get there, you're not going to keep everyone interested.

I really am curious to see if and how GW2 will change over the next couple years. I know GW1 became a better game for the changes before EoTN, but I don't know if it will be enough to win back the hearts of ex-GW1 PvPers who liked team building as much as building their skill bars.

With that said, how does everyone else feel about /r/games essentially voting GW2 as the 2nd most regretful buy of 2012?

Having dual or multiple specs is absolutely not imperative to my or to anyone else's enjoyment of the game. That said, I do think it would be awesome to at least have one extra spec slot. Let's say I'm running Twilight Arbor and I run a high damage spec with some utility, but not a ton. We hit a brick wall since not enough of us can remove conditions or heal. It's just not working out. With dual spec I can swap right over to a warhorn build with healing shouts and tons of banners and everything, without inconveniencing the group at all by asking to go respec. Again, this is not at all necessary, but I think it would be a nice addition to an already super fun game. Thoughts?

1342908022.0,418,self.Guildwars2,wxv60,"I'm already bored after 17 levels, am I doing it wrong? :(",614,196,985,http://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/wxv60/im_already_bored_after_17_levels_am_i_doing_it/,"I'm kinda afraid that I will be nuked for voicing my dislike about some parts, but I became bored after 17 levels on my Necro. Don't get me wrong, the game feels extremely well made, and I think it is worth the $50 price, but I will probably wait a few months after release before buying it. Some things that does not feel right to me:

**The skill system**  
Since the last few levels, after I got all the skills for my weapons, I don't feel like I'm getting stronger, it makes me feel like I already know the ins and outs of my class, and there are no game changing skills to look forward to. There are a lot of utility skills to choose from, but most of them revolve around removing boons, inflicting conditions, swapping boons&lt;-&gt;conditions which feels unnecessary, since all of my weapons skills apply a ton of conditions already, and all the mobs go down in 3-4 seconds. I could use the ones that remove conditions from myself, but it's rare to have conditions on me, and they fade in a few secs anyway. This lead me to using 3 summons as my utility skills.

**The combat**  
I feel that the dodge/evade mechanic is overhyped. All of the fights are 23402341 to me. If I'm soloing, I could worry about dodging, but some monsters are impossible to read (mostly the animal types so far), and even if I just burn the mob down without dodging, I will regenerate back in 5 seconds after the fight, which makes dodging feel unnecessary. If it's a group battle, I cannot dodge, because the screen is filled with so many effects/projectiles/aoe on the ground that I can't even see the mob. I just run around the mob, trying to keep my distance. This also seems to ruin the combo system, I can't see anything which just means that I press everything on my skillbar, and hope it activates a combo.

**The conditions**  
I don't feel they really add weight. Almost all of my skills inflict some condition on the target. I never consider something like ""Hm, I should apply this first, because then I will do more damage"", because it either adds so little to the fight, or lasts for such a very short time, that I could use another damaging move, making the mob go down faster. On group fights, the mob will have all of the possible conditions anyway, which just makes my logic more like ""is the skill on cooldown? use it."".

It's a really fantastic game, and I could go on and on about how alive the world feels, how good the trading system is, or how nice of a feature the vistas are, how dynamic events are much more awesome than quest hubs, and many other things. I just want to get your opinions on these three things that I feel lacking.

Running around, killing things, helping out and mining and chopping shit down. The only time I ever returned to the ""hubs"" was for the story quest. Any gear I got was broken down or thrown on the Trading Post. Any crafting mats sent straight to the bank. 

I just wandered around doing whatever. I didn't have to run back to town every 40 minutes to empty my bags. I didn't have to hunt down the AH to get rid of blues. I didn't have to come back every 2 levels to get new skills. 

After that, I decided to have another look at crafting. Teleport straight to the bank. Collect my crafting gear. Teleport to the crafting zone, and pick up Weapon Smithing. Bit of a revelation there, actually worked out how crafting goes, but I need a bit more copper for that last sword I wanted to make. Teleport out to the fields, collect what I need and within 5 minutes I've got that sword I was trying to make. 

It took 5 minutes to go from crafting, to out collecting, to get back and make what I needed.

Now, I am certainly not the most hardcore gamer here, nor do I even claim to be the most hardcore follower of GW2, but I have been through a couple long-awaited game cycles, and I thought it would be a good time to throw out a few reminders to help alleviate what will eventually happen. Most of these are mistakes I've made before, so excuse me if it sounds a little paternalistic.

**1) Be patient with new fans.** From now on, the number of subscribers to the subreddit will probably grow substantially. The first wave will come over the next month, with another major wave during the betas. They will ask the same questions we probably learned the answer to ages ago. Be patient! Kindness goes a long way, and we want people to feel welcome and engaged.

**2) Get ready for some legitimate criticisms.** With gaming critics finally getting a hand on the ""final"" product, there will be some legitimate criticisms. We have built the game up in our minds (and legitimately so!), but keep in mind that a lot of these people play games for a living AND have had far more time behind the wheel than we have. We need to listen to the criticism, assess if it matters, and act as a good gaming community that aims for positive improvement rather than rabidly defending our beloved game. **If anything, listening to criticism will help us temper our expectations of the game and not be disappointed because we built the game in our minds to something far greater than it could ever achieve.**

**3) Rumors will only accelerate and be ever more ridiculous than before.** Just ignore them. Unless ANet says something about it, it's probably fake. 

**4) Don't be surprised if features announced more than 6 months ago, for one reason or another, just aren't in the game.** They could come later. They might have sucked. Us ""super-followers"" need to let it go, though. 

If anyone else has some words of wisdom about the impending wave from previous experiences, feel free to share.

As many of you are aware, today marks the beginning of an invasion. Our lands, homeworlds and farming spots will soon be under siege by the detestable creatures known only as ""Newbies"". These vermin, recently spotted near Queensdale and other places, will soon be spreading forth as a blight once their free weekend keys are activated.

In response to this epidemic, I am organizing the **Newbie Eradication Squad**, starting immediately. Brave souls who volunteer for the N.E.S. will be on the front lines against the scourge, using naught but their wits and skills to stem the oncoming tide.

Our strategy for the extermination of Newbies is threefold, and as follows:

1. **Offer Helpful Advice** - Subterfuge is often the our greatest weapon. It's your job to infiltrate their ranks and begin reconditioning them as soon as possible.
2. **Be friendly at all times** - I've heard the phrase ""Kill them with Kindness"" before and figured we should try it out. And since we can't directly attack other players, this may be our best shot.
3. **Show them how awesome you are** - Teach them to respect the power of a level 80 character! Fight amongst their ranks, show off your sweet armor and demonstrate just what to expect should they dare set foot in Tyria!

In particular, I'm asking for special volunteers to join me on a direct assault against their main hives! Plains of Ashford, Caledon Forest, Metrica Province, Wayfarer Foothills and especially Queensdale will be the main hotbeds of this confrontation.

More difficult than pulling a slot machine lever, and with even less payout. A winning combination, if you're a free to play korean MMO from 2003.

Downvotes? Of course! But I know a lot of you agree.

The best christmas present would be ArenaNet announcing that they're going back to what they said this game would be, or at the very least, making it so that hard enemies drop nice rewards instead of exotics dropping more commonly (yet still rarely as technologically possible) from skritt.

I miss being level 1-20, where drops didn't matter so much. Would it really destroy the game if earning things wasn't so difficult or demanding on luck? Would it really kill every drive everyone has to play if we all found an exotic every 10 hours of casual (read: non-farming) gameplay or so, instead of every 100? Would it really destroy the game economy if a legendary took 100 hours of playing (without distinct farming sessions) to craft, instead of 400 hours of pure farming?

Guild Wars 2 is not a fun game anymore.

Problems ranged from annoying glitches all the way to show stopper progression blockers. There is no argument there to that effect. The thing is, we need to take a step back from that and look at the bigger picture. Regardless of the first run at this, it's clear ArenaNet and GW2 plan to throw some awesome new concepts at us. Previous MMOs would add new content in patches and it would just, ""be there"" at launch. New island? Ok there it is, go explore, everything is in place and heck it's all be beaten and documented on public test realms already anyway. 

Instead, we had a 3 day event that built up over time. We established a beach head, we cleared wave after wave of mobs in a giant event train, pushing the line of scrimmage back into uncharted territory. We held the enemy at bay while NPCs cleared forests, erected defenses and built out new bases and new waypoints right before our very eyes. This brave new world was not just there ready for us, we had to actively help CREATE it in real time out of an uncharted and untamed wild land. Now that the event is over, the island has ""flipped over"" and is now more like traditional content with new quest and goals ready for adventure like any other.

It's clear that ANet was not quite prepared for what went down this weekend, but I seriously doubt this was their one and only attempt at this. Clearly they plan to make each new piece of content we get an interactive experience as it is released to us, in a similar fashion. They will learn from their mistakes, they will fine tune their efforts and streamline their procedures. We will start getting more content with even more complex and fantastical levels of interactivity not common in most MMOs.. and you know what?

*... we never paid a penny for this new content and experiences.*

Think about that. For a moment don't look at what went wrong, look at what they *TRIED* to do, look at what they *WANT* to do for us, the gamers, and look at what little they asked of us in return other than to try and enjoy it at their expense.

**Edit 1**: This comes up a lot so let me clarify on WHY I say ""it's free content"". Money we spend on things like gems and collectors upgrades and character slots are optional things we choose to buy that we are in NO way obligated to purchase. If we don't, we still get this content, so for the purposes of this argument there are out of the equation. This leaves us with the initial $60 purchase of the game... Now, the majority of games published these days have roughly 10-60 hours of playability in them when they ship. We pay $60 for those games... we also paid $60 for this game, and the average person who's been playing since launch has long ago exceeded their 200th hour or more. That means if you have played for more than an average of 1 hour a day since launch (which was ~80 days ago) you have already exceeded this level of content by 25%. Essentially your initial ""investment"" has already paid out and you are now enjoying things for free. Sure it can be argued that the upfront cost was a payment for all content and time, even your 500th hour and on, but that just means that with every hour you play the cost per hour goes down as it is amortized over time untill we start talking about fractions of a cent per hour and that's just plain silly! If you are of an average play style then you have already exhausted the cost to content ratio of a traditional $60 retail game, therefore this weeks content was a bonus to you. You can argue to the opposite all you want but really it's a simple matter of practicality. There are hundreds to thousands of hours of content for only $60 of REQUIRED money to get into this. At some point that money has long paid it's dues and is no longer a factor.",,False,self,t5_2r9po,1353315705.0,,HumanT,True,t3_13f97h,http://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/13f97h/what_we_the_players_learned_from_this_event/,

I propose a fix as a slider.  The slider would adjust the height of the camera where it is centered on your character.  I drew a picture of how it is now, and how a slider could move it up.  The camera being higher would make it easier to see around you without the camera being close/touching the ground.

We're working on a Guild Wars 2 related tool website and one of the tools we have done is a triats calculator.

Following today's blog post by ArenaNet I have decided to pull the traits calculator from the site so you guys can play around with it.

Please note that the information is based off the wiki so there is a few traits missing and as more information comes out the tool will be updated.

You can find it [here](http://www.gw2tools.com/calc/)

Have fun sharing your builds and if you have any feedback let us know!

You can also get in touch with us @ contact@gw2tools.com

I have some very interesting things to cover, but putting a video together takes a lot of effort and I'd like to see if there's some interest before doing so.  If there is, please let me know what you'd like me to cover.  I do have a good idea as to what I should be covering but I want this to be as helpful as humanly possible to my fellow purveyors of pink butterflies.

**Edited to add** Looks like there's a good amount of desire out there.  This is going to be a big undertaking, so it will likely not be ready by tomorrow but I hope to have it done twoard the end of the week if you guys can wait that long.  Keep responding with ideas and i'll incorporate them.  Right now here's the plan:

I have a very specific build that I personally believe is the strongest out there right now from a utility/soloing and dungeon standpoint.  So firstly i'll go into what mesmers are actually doing, and then go into the build that I have worked out.

I will also branch off to talk about a couple other builds and sets of weapons that I think will also be beneficial.  I will go into inward synergies with the abilities and do my best to explain how/why you should use things and when.  I know the class seems like its low DPS but I absolutely promise that it isn't!!

**SECOND EDIT**
So this blew up a bit, seems like there is a LOT of interest out there.  I have already captured a ton of footage and explanations about the basics - I will be getting more footage tonight, and in the next day or two i'll be throwing it all together.

Some people have asked for a text based guide.  To start things off, I am going to be focusing primarily on video, as I have always felt that video is better at showcasing nuance that text can sometimes miss.  If there's enough demand after the video is released, I will do a write up to complement it.",,False,self,t5_2r9po,1346868368.0,,,True,t3_zcdco,http://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/zcdco/mesmers_would_you_like_a_guide_on_the_profession/,

Currently, we're in a strange situation that, with the release of the APIs, you could look up the current status of every event in your zone online, yet only be able to see the events right next to you when you're ingame. Making it so that players can see every event occurring in a zone from their main map would help a lot with event participation, encourage focused exploration over idle wandering and make *looking* for the bulk of the content a less frustrating experience for players.

https://forum-en.guildwars2.com/forum/support/account/High-Ranked-players-Commanders-hacked-Merged/first#post833629

He's systematically logging players out by changing their email from under them. They get a notification that their email is changed, they're kicked from the game, then all their stuff is looted and a few hours later they get their account back from support to find NOTHING left.

These players are all high-ranking members of the server, including 4-5 commanders and many other prominent members of the community, most with lots of progress towards a legendary. It doesn't seem to happening to other servers.

There's no pattern to how he might be doing it - most have strong passwords, most with different passwords for their email, none have seen their email accounts compromised, they don't all go to the same community forums, and some have mobile authentication attached (although one with mobile auth had their password changed so they couldn't log in, but when they got it back nothing had been stolen - maybe the mobile auth helped).

He's even started to threaten players now from accounts he has hacked, as you can see in this screenshot where one of our commanders ""Freyn"" is getting his account looted and his friends talking to 'him' get threatened by the hacker.

http://i243.photobucket.com/albums/ff203/magdalenasins/gw036.jpg and http://i243.photobucket.com/albums/ff203/magdalenasins/gw037.jpg

This is really terrible, and doesn't seem to be affecting any other servers. Why/how we're being targeted, how he changes the emails and gets in or how he knows who the wealthy players are to loot we just don't know.

I know Reddit isn't for account support, but this is huge news that a hacker has the power to do this, and if it could be our server it could be anyone's. Please protect your accounts - although even that doesn't appear to be helping much in this case.

**edit:** To the people saying they must have bought gold from dodgy sites, obviously my personal vouching for their character will mean nothing to you (and it shouldn't!). But why would this be targeting a small close-knit group on just one random European server?

 The issue? Server transfers. A large amount of people are currently transferring their accounts to the enemy server and logging in then queuing up for the server they want to mess with. They then DUMP the supply from the enemy by building arrow carts or ballista in the spawn. What happened today was made totally obvious: they pick up an orb that one server gets, then run it to the ""enemy"" and intentionally kill themselves to give the orb to the ""enemy"" when it is just their original home server. Our server had captured a garrison, the person then picked up the orb and ran to the enemy who was sitting just south of that garrison we just took.

The server who did not spend any resources taking the keep (the third server) took the orb by using someone who transferred servers and were able to capture the orb completely. They ran the orb to their keep. Now, we were all telling him to go to Emhry Bay, but he went the complete opposite direction. If this was legitimate, then we'd have instead saw him take the orb and re-place it in the garrison we won or ran it to the bay like everyone on chat (/team and /say) was saying.

This is incredibly upsetting for the servers this is happening to. Obviously this is just one issue of many, but I think that this can be fixed quickly by just imposing a block for transfers for the servers currently fighting. If Server 1, Server 2 &amp; Server 3 are fighting, then neither of those servers should be made available to transfer from those three servers. Servers not currently against each other are free to transfer to.

*Edit: Patriickk suggests that to allow the transfer but not allow them to enter WvW until matchup is complete. This would be a good idea as well!

You guys downvote topics just because they explain how you currently farm gold and you are afraid A.net nerfes these?

It's the right thing to distribute information among the community and let A.net decide if these things are intended or not.
If it was not intended they will fix it and noone has an unfair advantage. If it was intended you can just keep milking that sweet spot you just found.

If something was so bad it broke the economy, A.net showed how to handle these situations and that they were capable of doing so.

But it is not ok to take a massive advantage over other players and to keep information to yourself.

While I am a gamer, and avid about GW2, I know I'm probably not the ultimate fan, even within this subreddit. However, what I do have some knowledge of is commerce, and from that background I can help everyone here begin to conceptualize how GW2's economy might look.

**How Real People Inflation Works - Oversimplified**

In a modern economy, the production and destruction of money (theoretically) comes from one source, oftentimes known as the central bank. Inflation is determined by a number of factors - GDP growth, the velocity of money (how often it's used), and the real value of a transaction. However, the one thing that needs to be remembered is that **the central bank adjusts the amount of money available in the economy (using bonds and other means) to keep inflation where they want it**. Too much inflation? Take money out of the economy. Too little inflation? Put money back in. It's a LOT more complex than that, but that's all you need to know for here.
 
 |


**The Problem With Video Game Economies**

There are a couple reasons that video game economies are so prone to inflation. This all roots from the fact that the game developers set rules that essentially make the NPCs all function as members of the ""in-game central bank.""

1) **The existence of money (for now on known as ""gold"") is very unpredictable.** The amount of money you earn for a task, instead of experiencing diminishing returns, goes UP as you progress. A player can essentially log in and gain money at a growing rate for each hour played.

2) **Every NPC acts like their own little central bank.** Think about it this way: when you kill a person and steal all their wealth in real life, you aren't actually *creating* any value. All you are doing is transferring that value to yourself. However, in a video game, when you kill a person and steal all their goods, a new person will respawn with a similar amount of wealth. Thus, every NPC is pumping money and value into the economy.

3) This one works the same for in-game and regular economies: **nobody likes it when you take their money for no reason.** If you knew that the central bank, in an effort to curb inflation, was charging you an extra fee for every gallon of gas you bought for the sole purpose of destroying that money so nobody else could use it again, you'd be pissed. You may understand if the government were giving you value in return (like a fee to access a beautiful park or an interest-bearing bond), you may be more understanding. Similarly, arbitrary fees to do necessary tasks in games have the tendency to piss off players. **Thus, a game must do its best to incentivize players to spend their gold without making the items they are spending their gold on necessary to the core game mechanic.**

|

**Methods for resolving these problems**

There are a few different ways to resolve each of these problems, but they all come with relative strengths and weaknesses.

1) **Limiting Transactions.** This is the Commie method of preventing inflation. In this method, you make it so the currency you obtain can only be used in government-owned facilities. The government then takes this currency and ""destroys"" it. You cannot give your currency to another person and you cannot use it for other goods. The positive side of this is that the government has complete control of the amount of currency available. The bad side is that this limits trade and the value-creation that goes along with it.

2) **Limiting dispersement of Gold.** To avoid inflation, you could also seriously limit the amount of gold dispersed. There are several ways you can limit gold dispersement. You could do this by minimizing gold earned from drops, or making gold come from time-intensive activities. This method does wonders to curb inflation, but eventually greats a ""grind"" dynamic, and once your game drops to a point where there is an obligatory grind to fulfill basic needs and desires, you are screwed.

3) **Creating Gold-Sinks** - The most raw definition of a gold-sink is any transaction or event in which a currency exits the economy permanently. This can be through an event, a purchase, or some sort of transaction charge.

There are good and bad ways to create gold sinks. Gold sinks should either be small, token amounts that help to chip away at inflation, or should be incentivized in such a way that a player feels like they are getting something out of it. If your gold-sink fees feel too large, players start feeling like they are being ""taxed away."" If your purchase gold sinks don't adequately incentivize making the purchase, they are useless. **Players want to feel like they are getting something for their hard-earned cash**.

|

**How GW2 handles these concerns.**

Arenanet has created a balanced approach to resolving in-game inflation.

**First, they split up earned value into gold, karma, and tokens and limit Karma/Token Transactions.**This method is applied in GW2 using Karma and Tokens. Essentially, tasks you fulfill give you karma (and fulfilling dungeons give you tokens), but you cannot trade Karma with other players or use it in trades. You then trade the Karma or tokens in for items of value to you, but these items have zero value to anybody else. Arenanet then sets your Karma and Tokens on fire, never to be seen again. **Thus, every player who enters and exits the game will not experience inflation with Karma and tokens, as the amount they can receive and the cost of Karma/Token stores is very strictly controlled.** If GW2 left it there, though, there would be no trade, no community, and no real in-game economy at all.

**Second, Guild Wars 2 limits dispersement of gold in two ways.** Gold, like experience, is earned most efficiently through events and hearts rather than grinding (in fact, I have personally yet to see a video that proves regular mobs will even drop gold at all). This helps to eliminate the ""grind"" mentality by encouraging players to play the game rather than engage mobs. However, mobs in GW2, whether or not they drop actual gold, do drop items which can be sold, which is effectively the same as getting gold. **To alleviate the gold inflation from item selling, GW2 encourages salvaging.** Salvaging breaks down items into their component parts, and those parts can then be consumed while crafting. This allows Arenanet to sink gold into craft-leveling without charging oppressive transaction fees. Most of the items that come out at the end of crafting will not be worth the sum of crafting components added to them, but will pay off in the long-term when more unique and cosmetically gorgeous recipes are available at the end of the game.

**Third, Guild Wars 2 makes transaction costs minimal and creates solid content as gold sinks.** This includes throwing giant parties for your guild, consuming dwarven ale, buying transmutation stones, participating in certain minigames, seasonal events, town-clothes, and more. Essentially, instead of buying tactical advantages and numbers, you are buying character enrichment and side-style fun. Transaction costs seem to be small, and therefore unintrusive (you won't one day walk up to the auction house and realize you just don't have the cash to list an item for sale or open the map and just realize you really don't have the funds to teleport).

Creating a world economy also helps to balance things. By theories of demand, gold will naturally flow toward servers that need it/are younger by being willing to post materials for lower prices. You may even see servers, because of age, begin to model the underdeveloped/developing/developed model of international economics (sorry, I'm nerding out a little).

|

**Conclusion**

While it's difficult to say for certain now, **Arenanet seems to have developed a sound, multi-pronged strategy for limiting and alleviating the inflation of in-game gold.** By limiting and controlling half of your revenue to be character-specific (Karma and Tokens), by eliminating incentive to grind mobs and making gold-earning tasks time-intensive, by encouraging the destruction of trash loot into crafting rather than vendor sales, by creating manageable transaction fees, by creating incentivized gold-sinks, and by preventing multi-runs on dungeons just for rare drops, GW2 attacks gold inflation from multiple fronts.

**Most importantly, though, the methods of handling inflation are unintrusive and, for the most part, fun.** Crafting, mini-games, cosmetic gear, achievement-seeking, DE-encouraging, token-earning, and Karma-spending are just plain fun. You get rewarded for sending your gold out of the economy, and those rewards are about enjoyment rather than stats.",,False,self,t5_2r9po,True,,,True,t3_qe3pc,http://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/qe3pc/a_primer_on_mmo_inflation/,

Sup guys, Nuuance (aka Nuu) here. I don't have many improvements besides shatter, clone, and confusion slight damage buffs, but here's a visual improvement i think would REALLY help: 

**In comments, tell which mockup you like BEST!**

* [Mockup1 (UPDATED!v3) Thicker/Whiter bars](http://i.imgur.com/XcQxN.jpg with duration bars around the circles)
* [Mockup2 --spartan421/s ""health-pool"" suggestion-- (UPDATED!v3) Bigger circles &amp; illusion ""order"" numbers](http://i.imgur.com/bjlaR.jpg)
* [Mockup2.5 (version1) Here's the same graphic, with hp numbers like some requested ""forgot the illusion ""order"" numbers](http://i.imgur.com/m3TPJ.jpg) 
* [Mockup3 (UPDATED!v4) The health-pool suggestion, except with colors for easier glancing](http://i.imgur.com/oLPrE.jpg) The red appears when clones are below 33% health. The white flashing appears when illusion's hp is below 75% health. Black is when above 75% health. 

**Health Numbers Readout (mockup 2.5):** 

* For the example, each illusion has 3,000 (3k) hp. So instead of listing the whole number, it's rounded into 2 digits around a decimal point. So 75% of the phantasm's health is 2.2k. 
* I decided NOT to do percentage, because it really doesn't tell you how much absolute hp your clones have. only relative data. All mesmers' clone/phantasm health won't be the same so saying 90% for one person might be only .7k hp while 90% for another might be 2.5k hp.

**Illusion Order Readout (Mockup 2 &amp; 3):**

* Hopefully this is obvious, but each of these numbers represent the illusion next in line to be ""overwritten."" 1 being the first, 2 being the second...and so on.
* The small numbers BELOW the circles w/the same look as the keybind numbers is an idea i had if people don't like the color flashing to indicate health. This way, as soon as an illusion reaches 50% health or below, the number changes to red. 


**Circles (ALL mockups):** 

* The purple circles stand for phantsams
* The pink for clones
* The circles around each indicator in the first mockup is a mini-health bar. 

**REASONING:** 

* First off, Yes, some people don't mind keeping track of illusions, but that can be a hassle while trying not to die/close to dying.
* Please remember, it's NOT something that says you can't shatter or shouldn't. 
* It's to help gauge shatter timing better. When we get symbols for clones, this will really help.
* And also, this DOESNT lower skill cap or encourage UI Camping/staring. For those of you who've played the game already, you know the action is very kinetic. and mesmer players constantly have to look/glance at the illusions bar to see if they have enough illusions out anyways. This wouldn't hurt anything.

* You can craft bags with different purposes other than just extra bag space. Eg the invisible leather bag that never shows up when talking to merchants (useful for storing stuff you don't want to sell by accident). [Source, this and next](http://tinyurl.com/cq732ov)

* Your mail inbox can fill up, and stop you from recieving new mail. Not all mail takes up space tho, like mail from completing Renown Hearts.

* NPCs doesn't fade away after you have completed a Dynamic Event, they simply continue on with their tasks. This may sometimes lead to new Dynamic Events, or simply provide a fun experience if you follow 'em. [Source](http://tinyurl.com/cohcsby)

* Max level is level 80, however, you will continue to gain xp, and will be rewarded each level with a Skill point (no stat increase). Skill points have more uses than unlocking your skills! [Source](http://tinyurl.com/bqseegs)

**Map tips**

* You can link to waypoints in chat, and people can then click it and teleport to it, if they have already discovered it. [Source, this and next](http://tinyurl.com/ceu667u)

* You draw or ping on the map if you hold Shift and then use your mouse. Works on both the minimap and the map.

* You can drop permanent markers, called 'Personal Waypoint', by holding Alt and left clicking on the map or minimap. To remove simply left click again or place another marker.[Source](http://tinyurl.com/bnwk2ls)


**Gathering and crafting tips**

* You might know you can [Deposit Collectible](http://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Crafting_material#Storage), and that it doesn't take up any space in your Account Vault, which is shared amongst all your characters (Account Vault duh!), but did you know that you can deposit all collectibles in your bag at once? This is done by using the bag [Option button](http://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Inventory#Options_Button). You can even access your [Account Vault](http://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Account_vault) from the crafting stations!

* Crafting materials in WvW is found in different sections of the area. Where, well [here](http://tinyurl.com/clfc8ar).


**Xp and leveling tips**

* Some monsters yield bonus xp, this bonus xp is determined by how long the mob have been alive. [Source](http://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Experience)

* 100% map completion XP reward is scaled to 10% of the required xp for you to lvl up, and grants you 3 [Transmution Stones (1-79)](/spoiler)(http://tinyurl.com/d2ol76w). [Source, this and next 2](http://tinyurl.com/czpd6zd)

* Xp for next level increases each level, however the time stays somewhat the same after level 15, since the xp gain increases by the same proportional amount.

* Having trouble with a 'Personal Story'? Then bring a friend! It's possible to guest all Personal stories, no matter race and level (downscaling). Two or more can even complete the same Personal Story at the same time, however this seems to have some restrictions like having to pick the same options as the owner (The one who initiated the story).

* Xp gained from crafting is % based of what you need to level up. Leveling a discipline to skill 400 (max) will grant you 10 levels. There are 8 disciplines, so you can reach level 80 by doing nothing but crafting.



**Gameplay tips**

* When placing a ground targeting ability, simply press the hotkey again to cast it at your mouse, rather than pressing with your mouse. Also, there is an option to make it so you cast at your mouse cursor instantly.

* You can aim your skills manually by controlling the camera when you have no target. This works great with several [leaping abilities](http://tinyurl.com/cncvbd3). [Source](http://tinyurl.com/cq732ov)

* A red bar will show under you skill if you are out of range or behind obstacle, the red bar will also show if your manually aiming, and the spell can't go full length, due to obstacle etc. [Source](http://tinyurl.com/d5edtbk)  

* You can only lose durability by dying, each armor piece have 3 stages: Normal, damaged and broken. Dying reduces 1 armor piece to the next stage, before an item can become broken, all other items must be damaged. Therefore, when all items are at normal, it will take 6 deaths to have all your gear damaged, and after 12 deaths all your armor is broken.

* Dying from taking fall damage will not damage your armor. [Source](http://tinyurl.com/cq732ov)

* Serveral instant spells can be used while casting another spell. Click [here](http://tinyurl.com/cwfyzxr) for a great example of pure pwning use in PvP [Source](http://tinyurl.com/bsc224e)

* You can 'mark' a target by pressing Ctrl+T, others in your party can the target this target by pressing T. [Source](http://tinyurl.com/czckxte)

* Most group buffs only affect 5 allies, so if you're grouped with other players, these will have priority over other allies. [Source](http://tinyurl.com/d7kfuyj)

* Environmental Weapons. Nuff' said! An awesome way to mix up the combat. [Source](http://tinyurl.com/czbgz9l)


**sPvP and WvW tips**

* You can swap teams in sPvP by clicking the + button on top of each team in the score screen, which is opened by pressing B. [Source](http://tinyurl.com/cq732ov)

* You can carry a max of 15 supply if you grab it from Stonemist Castle in the Eternal Battleground. Normal max is 10. [Source](http://tinyurl.com/d5edtbk)

**Ranger pet tips**

* As the ranger proffesion you have access to 2 pets during combat (only 1 active at the time), switching out your pet will heal it to full, but the switching cooldown is increased if you switch out a defeated pet, so the most effective thing to do, is to switch out your pet [before it is defeated](http://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Pet#Combat_mechanics), the cooldown on the switch will then be around 20 seconds.

I know characters by other people who have not set foot outside of Lion’s Arch after arrival just to craft to 80! Some characters are levelled and then forgotten about.

We are a competitive team who have been making a lot of noise in the competitive scene with sights on becoming involved with eSports for GW2. Right along with Alpha Collective, Team Imperial and several other competitive teams in the game right now.

The question is, does the community want GW2 to be a part of eSports?

Let me explain a bit more in-depth. I, an eSports fanatic, would love to see it happen and not just for personal reason (though it would be awesome to take part in the eSports). In the end what I do, what we do, and what we want to do is offer the community not just entertainment but we want to give back to you. In other games this is often done with guides, strategies, gameplay videos, and streams. Right now we are in the early days of GW2, but it is apparent to a lot of us who are trying our best to be the best that there is a great possibility for eSports in GW2. Some guides, streams, and videos are out there, but we want to offer you the best but it is all for not if it is not seen. We, the teams, can offer you, the community, a lot but we need to work together.

If you want eSports to become part of GW2, if you want content such as guides, videos, strategies, and streams we need you to want it. Come watch our streams, support the different teams, spread the word.

Games don't become part of eSports without an audience who wants it to. We need an audience. A lot of us believe that this will happen but raising awareness never hurts. So tune in to streaming sites like Twitch.tv, look me up (TR_aSith) and the rest of us out there like Alpha Collective and Team Imperial. 

TLDR; We, the competitive teams, want eSports to be a part of GW2. Do you?

Leave your comments below, be kind to others posting, and lets discuss!


**EDIT**

I also want to make clear this is not just my selfish self promotion, I truly want and believe in eSports for GW2. I fully support all the other teams and they supports us as well. We all want to see it become a reality, we all want viewers and followers for each other, it only means growth for the game.

And I don't blame ArenaNet for doing hyping the ever-loving Moa out of the game.  They're obviously proud of their work.  But, I had my concerns.  As a long-time MMO-player since the days of Ultima Online I wondered - could it really be as good as they say it is?

**Instancing**

This was one of my concerns.  Like many of you, I'm sure, the last MMO I played was World of Warcraft (for many years).  I thought it great that the whole world was just seamless (aside from dungeons - and switching continents).  GW2's zones do not seamlessly merge.  

The reality wasn't nearly as bad as I expected, and it then occurred to me that there was an advantage to doing it this way.  Because of this implementation detail, different servers can conceivably handle different zones.  So instead of the ""world"" being full, it's zones themselves that get full (at least, I think so).  Thanks to overflow servers, you're never really prevented from going about your business - and if you don't fancy going on to an overflow server for a zone, you can always go and do something else in a less-populated zone.

When ArenaNet announced overflow servers, I jumped with joy.  What a fantastic idea!  There are, however, some kinks to work out (such as being in a party of people and being on different overflow servers).  I don't think that it should be too big of a deal to fix this.  Perhaps they could implement some logic so that parties go to the same overflow server.  It shouldn't imbalance things.

**The Environments**

What can I say?  They're beautiful.  There wasn't one place I went where I didn't think ""This place looks great"".  And there wasn't any wasted space that I could see.  There was always something going on somewhere, and I felt like I was in a living and breathing world.  I'm not afraid to compare to World of Warcraft (as the ""Big One"", it's a natural comparator).  Wow's universe seems so static.  They tried to make this ""not so"" with phasing, but all that did mess up forming groups, and helping friends who were ""phased"" differently.  And even then, the replaced content was still just as static.  A bunch of NPCs sitting around.  There are NPCs ""sitting around"" in GW2 aswell, but I feel there's more conversation going on.  There's more people moving around and between towns.  People coming and asking for help (A precursor to an event).  I have no complaints.

**Combat**

I can only write about the thief class which is the class I wanted to play (coming from a Rogue in WoW), and was pleasantly surprised.  Combat felt fluid (shooting on the move feels *really* good!), and the dodge mechanic was absolutely necessary for survivability.  Whereas in Wow I just hit keys until my opponent or I died (perhaps ""getting out of the fire"" on occasion), I thoroughly enjoyed dodging, kiting, firing, trying to get the up on my enemy.  I didn't have time to go over all the possible extra traits and skills to refine my Thief (perhaps I should have played in PvP a bit), but there's a plethora of things I still need to unlock and investigate.  I'm going to thoroughly enjoy refining my thief to my play-style.

One issue I had with dodging was double-tapping the key to do it.  I'm not sure if it was my keyboard, but sometimes my ""get-outta-dodge"" bar was full and double-tapping did nothing.  Once or twice I didn't double-tap, but dodged forward (in to a bad guy, no less.  That didn't end well), but I'm sure these are minor kinks that can be worked out.

**Audio**

I have no real complaints here.  The background music is beautiful (no surprise there, given the composer), and the sound effects all pleasing.  If I was going to nitpick at all, it would be that some spells from other classes *appeared* to be brutally loud compared to my own pistol-firing.  But then, I don't suppose magic was ever supposed to be particularly quiet.

**Social**

The other thread on this subject hit the nail on the head.  Whilst I saw very little ""chatting"" going on (with the exception of the end-of-beta event), there was plenty of impromptu socialising.  Because there are no penalties for tagging monsters or resource nodes....  because everyone is rewarded for their contribution...  natural groups constantly formed and nobody minded.  Everyone would help and revive.  ArenaNet has done a splendid job of allowing emergent socialising to occur naturally, rather than Warcraft which effectively can punish players for working together.  Want to camp a rare spawn?  Tough if someone gets their bow off before you do - that loot is theirs.  In GW2, just contribute.

I've never seen a community in a game work so well cohesively together, and I do hope that it stays this way.  There are plenty of morons in the world (I'm probably one of them, lol), but I think in a game with emergent grouping like this, it will be the exception rather than the norm.

One addition I would like is the addition of **/say**, and perhaps a zone-wide local chat to ask for specific help if you feel on your own versus something too big and mean.  You might think ""But I don't want a whole bunch of idiots spamming chat"".  Well, regular chat doesn't bother me, and you can always ignore the person in question.  And the profanity filter is on by default.

**Level Scaling**

One of the things I was most interested in, when reading about GW2 was being scaled down when in zones that were for lower-level players.  Returning to the starter zone at level 20, I was pleased that I wasn't one-shotting everything.  I could still be killed if I wasn't careful (thanks to the reduced health pool).  I still felt like a hero, but not a moronic one who laughs off the blows being landed on his face.  And XP was still rewarded, even though it was a titchy amount.  If your buddies buy the game late and need your help through earlier content, it's not necessarily going to be a ""stand back whilst I hit a button and nuke the zone"" kind of fight.  It'll still be pretty easy, but it'll be fun too.

**Summary**

Just before the end of the beta-weekend, I looked at my map to see where I had been and what I had uncovered.  I hadn't scratched the surface of the world - and this is after playing it as solidly as I could for the weekend.  Something that won't be possible during my usual day-to-day routine when the game officially releases.  I didn't *touch* crafting.  I didn't do any dungeons.  I didn't do any PvP.  I was immersed in the world and simply tried to do as much as I could in PvE and dynamic events.

I am completely won-over and impressed by this game.  This is the kind of MMO I would gladly pay $15 a month for, and the fact it's free to play (after purchase, lol), is just an extra boon.

So - if you're on the fence about buying Guild Wars 2, I HIGHLY recommend it.  If you've never played an MMO before, then there has never been a better opportunity to check it out.  I am sure there are going to be balancing issues for a while, and I'm sure that many classes need tweaking.  We're still at the beta.  But hell, I'd play it in the state it's in now.  Quite happily.

Sorry for the huge circlejerk of a post, but this is a beautiful game in many, many respects and it *does* change the MMO genre.  For the better.",,False,self,t5_2r9po,True,,Thief,True,t3_szhh2,http://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/szhh2/through_the_hype/,

I honestly cannot remember then name of the quest but around level 74/75 in the personal story you will be given a choice of assaulting a ship or assaulting a camp.

Do not, under any circumstances, chose to assault the ship. The mission is 100% impossible to complete due to a bug with an NPC within. 

All you need to do is keep in mind around this level range to not assault the ship and you will be ok.

This bug has been here since release and after each new build it has still been broken.

I am aware this is not the place to ask for support, however, I felt it would be nice to warn people about it.

The bugged quest itself is called ""A Grisly Shipment"" if anyone else wants to send in a report about it

1348154179.0,368,self.Guildwars2,107176,"CALM. DOWN. As a GW2 video creator and partner, some clarification.",568,200,106,http://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/107176/calm_down_as_a_gw2_video_creator_and_partner_some/,"I have been following this drama for a bit now and figured I’d try and clarify a few basic concepts. Lets get a few things out of the way.
**This is not a new thing.** Not for Guild Wars 2 itself or for gaming videos in general.
I am a YouTube partner, part of a network. In other words, this sounds like something that affects me. Does it do so? No. [Do you see any flagged videos?]( http://tinyurl.com/co9ncnu) I certainly do not. 

As I mentioned, this is not new. This has been around for ages and most games have a policy similar to this. Guild Wars 2 has had this in their policies for a long, long time now stating that “The content must be used in a non-commercial context for private, personal use only”. ArenaNet, or more accurately NCsoft, are not actively chasing after video creators. This flagging system is caused by YouTube itself.

For this reason networks exist, there are a number of ways for content creators to earn money through YouTube. The drama that occurred here likely arose over a creator that uploaded a video, got a message (an *automated* one!) that his video was capable of being monetized. Awesome! But that’s not how things work. 
Monetization through this automated system does not make you a partner. YouTube explicitly states the following on game video monetization: “Whether you can use video game content for monetization depends on the commercial use rights granted to you by licenses of video game publishers. Some video game publishers may allow you to use all video game content for commercial use and state that in their license agreements. Videos simply showing game play for extended periods of time may not be accepted for monetization.” 
Yes, it is possible to monetize gaming videos through a number of exceptions. Minecraft is a prime example where monetization is fully allowed – by Mojang - without strings attached, a lot of indie titles have this, but **in general game videos can not simply be monetized by just about anyone on YouTube** and your video will be flagged and possibly pulled. *Keep in mind that you can still make videos as much as you want to if you do not activate monetization and therefor just use this for non-commercial uses.* (There are other exceptions that I won’t go into detail in, and admittedly am not too familiar with) 

Now then, networks. There are more than you could imagine, TGS, Machinima, TGN.. Etc etc. These are a *different* case altogether and most –if not all – of the content creators you’ll be watching Guild Wars 2 videos from are part of a network such as these. Through these networks you are a partner and the network you are part of takes care of the legalization ends, allowing you to create game content. 

I’ll state it again, this is not a new thing for Guild Wars 2. Games such as World of Warcraft, Call of Duty or Halo work in similar ways. It is tempting to simply monetize just about anything when you get these messages, but be wary. If you want to actively be making money from gaming content on YouTube – and you think you have the time required to do so – Join a network. 

Does this hurt people? Doubtfully. Again, this has been around for ages and do new partners arise? Definitely. Do people still monetize their videos? I do believe so. This won’t suddenly create a rift in all that we love and care about on YouTube or Guild Wars 2 and this is certainly not something “straight out of SOPA”. If it impairs the growth of smaller channels it has done so for years now and yet channels – Heck I’m a smaller channel – are still capable of growing just fine (Mostly without earning [significant] money off of it) until they are in a position to be partnered. 

*You can dislike ArenaNet all you want, but this is not a reason for it.*



TL;DR:
Nothing changed here, no reason to get all fussy.

For one, and the most transparent, it lets you do content without trivializing it. You can go back and do all this content and it means something. You can play with friends without feeling like it's a waste of time, etc. 

My favorite thing, though, is that it just MAKES SENSE. I mean, thinking about other MMOs, you go back into a low-level zone and are some kind of a god, taking little to no damage from the mobs and one-shotting everything you look at. How does this makes any sense? Somehow because you've leveled up, 5 huge, heavily armored dudes hacking you with swords is nothing? 

GW2 is the first time I've thought about this, but setting aside your LEVEL and thinking about REALITY, sure, it's gonna be easier, you've done harder stuff. And yes, you have a slight advantage because you've found some quality gear that is all-around better at doing its job. So you take a bit less damage and do a bit more. Your character has also done more difficult things, so why should they get more experience than they do. This just helps enhance immersion on a level that I've not previously experienced in an MMO and I LOVE it.

Also, the damn carrier pigeons. They are a phenomenal way to make in-the-field mail make sense. Just another little thing to make me feel like my character is alive.

There are ~~57~~ 58 unique staves in total (I left out the newbie PvE/PvP staff as I assumed most players are not interested in those basic models). I was able to get high res screenshots for virtually for all of them save for two dungeon staves (SE and CM) and two staves that are not obtainable in PvE atm (Final Rest and Primitive Pike). No one knows how to get Final Rest (dev said it was from a large chest) and I can't find the PvE equivalent model of primitive pike. 

Anyways, hope you like them! I enjoy the look of staves but unfortunately not alot of people uses them. I will be uploading the images to the wiki as well so if you like to help me with that please do :D

I planning fonctionalities where users will be able to place marker and export them to a json, to facilitate sharing. I'm also looking into the HTML5 API (local storage), so that everyone could have his custom map. I'm gonna work on that this weekend ;).

My goal it to make the greatest information map out there, so if you have any suggestions, feel free to send them out! leave a comment here on reddit, or [there](https://github.com/lpdumas/gw2map/issues/2)

I have a small list of things i want to implement on the github project page, feel free to comment on this to.

Thx all, i'm waiting for your feedbacks!

P.S: Sry for my english, not very good at it ;)


**EDIT** crap ... misspelled Google in title, sry about that ;)

**EDIT2** You guys are awesome, right now i have to go, but i will come back later tonight. Keep on the suggestions!

**EDIT3** 

I've updated the map. Changelog:

* Shit load of marker (thanks to [this man](https://github.com/multippt))
* Dev mod. When active you can add/move marker (i working right now on a way to remove/save/export/edit marker)

I'm not working on the UI at all, only on the code, so i know it's not very pretty.

1347050045.0,371,self.Guildwars2,ziuvm,Conditions are completely useless against large boss fights which severely limits build variety. ,496,125,392,http://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/ziuvm/conditions_are_completely_useless_against_large/,"Stacks of conditions on bosses have arbitrary stacks that were obviously meant for balance but they are completely nonsensical in large boss encounters. I'll go down the list. Please correct me if I'm wrong about mechanics here. 

Note that I am not discussing PvP balance here, this is a discussion about group events. These problems are less pronounced in PvP and Dungeons. 

**Bleed** - Stacks to 25

Elementalists, Warriors, Rangers, and Mesmers all have SUBSTANTIAL sources of bleed. Elementalists and Mesmers atleast can apply 25 stacks of bleed *by themselves.* So what happens when you have a mesmer, and ele, and a ranger using bleed? A huge amount of that damage is completely lost on the boss. Add more bleed into the mix and it's even worse. The solution here is to make bleed an individual condition, as my stacks of bleed don't weaken the boss for other people and there are no scaling gains.

**Burning and Poison** - 1 stack to 1 minute

1 stack? Ha. I hope these aren't actually working off only 1 stack. 

**Vulnerability** - Stacks to 25

Same issue as Bleed, every stack past 25 is redundant. Give Vulnerability diminishing returns instead, up to a soft-cap if unnecessary. 

**Confusion** - Stacks to 25

A boss having 25 stacks of confusion just means a mesmer dropped an Etherial field. I don't really care about this one because Confusion is overrated in PvE anyway against slow attacking bosses. 

Everything else is mechanically redundant, blind, chilled, weakness, crippled, etc.


tl;dr: If you're using conditions for damage against event bosses, that damage isn't contributing anything. This should change.

_______________

I think that's a really sweet design choice, personally.  Most players probably won't be attempting to max every discipline, but what it does do is further incentivize people to look into crafting and potentially gain a sizable chunk of levels on a character by doing so.  

I was thrilled when I heard that it was possible to level from 1-80 in WvW alone, so it's nice to see that the same can even be done by a non-traditional means like crafting.

I haven't been painting fan art as much; work is keeping me busy and I've been meaning to get back into doing original stuff and practice exercises.

The biggest problem is that the spells do not prioritize actual players, instead it's random between players, minions, pets and clones. What that does is make a lot of spells unreliable if you have necro, ranger or mesmer in your group. 

I am playing my mesmer in dungeons and more often than not my Time Warp is affecting one of my clones, ranger's pet or necro's minion rather than a player. Also guardian heals, staff empower etc.

Some days ago there was an interview where it was said [""improving the guild system wasn't a priority""](http://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/1hrr89/4gamers_interview_with_mike_zadorojny_lead/).

I don't know if this is a new case of developer blindess, but I do think guilds deserve some dedication, and soon.

But what would be one of my threads without a good amount of ideas:

---

**Making the guild panel a social panel**

Each guild should have a ""blog"" section, where officers can write down text, add links, etc. Not a real blog, and should have limits (like removing old news posts). It's main purpose would be posting guild news, explanations on how the guild works, etc.

People should be able to find everything about the guild in the guild panel, and the message of the day isn't enough. I'm tired of linking guides, too, and I would love to post them at the guild panel.

Also, the message of the day shouldn't go empty each time you try to edit it. I can't believe I need to copy+paste the message in a .txt to avoid losing it. My calendar says it's 2013, please.

Some space to store guild recruitment and welcome messages would be nice, too, so you don't need to save them in .txt's too.

---

**Communication from officers to members**

Officers should be able to mass /w or mail all members of a rank. When you want to announce something happening right at the moment, it's a pain to go whispering each member. Doing the same with mail goes further, and it's pretty much impossible.

There's no way for officers to communicate with the members properly. The message of the day fails once again, since people don't check it daily for changes.

---

**Guild mission activation control**

There should be options to limit guild mission activation for specific ranks. There's always someone that screws up and activates a bounty, a challenge, a puzzle or a rush too soon. These kind of things should be able to be controlled.

Also, the history logs should show who activated what, so the officers know if someone screwed up, and watch him to see if he does it often, or just demote him to a rank without permissions.

---

**WvW and guilds**

Guilds can put their banners on keeps, camps, etc... To give some buffs, and that's all. This is just boring, lame even. When a guild raises their banner somewhere, members of that guild should be encouraged and rewarded to defend the place.

The enemy should be encouraged to attack, too. Taking a tower defended by a powerful guild should give better rewards than attacking a defenseless tower. Powerful guilds should search each other for bloodlust and competition in the middle of the server battles.

We could introduce a new mechanic: Morale.

Morale would be server and guild-tied. Server morale would affect everyone, and guild morale would only affect your guildmates. When you win, everyone gets server morale, but then you get some extra guild morale just for yourself, because you did the work. Same if you lose, then you get extra penalization.

You'd earn morale first by defending. Each member defending a position with your flag would give morale to the guild. The second way would be taking enemy positions. Every member participating on taking an enemy camp would earn morale, more depending on the time it was defended.

Morale could give basic stat boosts, opening new strategies: You might want to strike attack a poorly-defended enemy tower in the middle of the enemy territory, no matter you won't be able to keep it, to then have a morale advantage at a better-defended tower you're able to hold.

It's just an example, but guilds should have a reason to defend the positions with their flags at any cost.

---

**Events and guilds**

Events and whatever are nice, but why are guilds marginalized out of them? There could be event-limited influence stuff, so guilds can party together and spend their influence on event stuff for the entire community.

And not just vanity stuff, guilds could drop event-specific buff banners, things like ""Aetherblade slaying banner"", for example. There's so much potential, I'm really surprised and saddened of how guilds do nothing special during events. Think of all the influence sinks, too!

---

**Last logged in**

I won't ask for a ""how much influence every member produces"" option. I don't think that could be positive in any way. However, inactivity detection is a must.

We should have two types: Last represented, and last connected. Last represented could require a minimum of time, like 30min, to make sure it wasn't a flash represent that doesn't show any kind of activity.

It's a pain to clean inactives to make space. This is probably the most important point of the list.

---

**Calendar with alerts**

A basic calendar, where officers can write notes on specific days and hours, with customized alerts to remember members what's going on, 30 or 5 minutes before it beings.

It could use the mail system, to make sure every member notices it, and doesn't lost the information.

---

**Guild achievements**

Why do guild missions have ZERO achievements? Giving all guild missions achievements would encourage people to play them more than once per week, as well as to help other guilds complete theirs.

There should be a ""Guild"" section in achievements, with a huge list including guild mission achievements and other simpler things like ""events/dungeons completed with guildmates"". Achievements can encourage team play and socializing, but instead they completelly ignore guilds (Except that get 10,000 influence achievement, which doesn't encourage socializing in any way).

These achievements could give specific visual rewards, to show you're part of a guild that did badass stuff, too. The guild itself could have an achivement list of its own, unlocking flag ornaments or siege weapon skins for the guild, and even custom armors (not necessarily new) for guards defending positions you raised your flag at, so the enemy knows there's good players defending the place.

---

**TL;DR:**

* Options to write long and classified pieces of text on your guild panel, for guild news and links. Editing shouldn't remove the previous text.
* Ability to mass whisper and mail members of the selected ranks.
* Control on who is able to activate and who has activated guild mission objectives.
* Reasons in WvW to defend positions with your flags raised.
* Guild influence stuff during events, so guilds can join the party with guild-specific stuff.
* Last logged and last 30min represented options to check activity.
* Calendar with mail alerts minutes before it begins.
* Guild missions and playing with guildmates should have achievements of their own, with rewards that show guild progress and effort.

The biggest part of MMOs is people and communities, and guilds are a big part of this, keeping people playing just because of friends. Not giving guilds the priority they deserve isn't a good decision, at all.

1354178785.0,365,self.Guildwars2,13zhzg,"Just got out of 1st lvl 20 fractal, boy are some players in for a surpise.",476,111,409,http://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/13zhzg/just_got_out_of_1st_lvl_20_fractal_boy_are_some/,"I've been preaching this for a while now, and I see some other skilled players in the higher level fractals saying the same. Its not about your Dps, its about survivablity.

I posted some mesmer support builds one day and largely they were met with approval but I still got the normal ""Mesmer's should just dps, Mesmers can't out tank this, Mesmer's cant out support that"" well sure, in PVE so far maybe that does work best. But I just got out of my first level 20 fractal, and the people who think certain classes need to play DPS and if not they are doing it wrong are in for a big surprise.

The farther I get in these fractals the more skilled players I am finally seeing, players that are build for surviving and supporting other players and not just DPSing. I see elementalists actually AWARE that I'm getting low in HP, and come over and heal me. I see Gaurdians spamming Aegis on bosses that give one shots. Players actually using the combo fields we put up. I see people actually playing as a team and running support builds. These glass cannon guys, or even guys built soley for DPS, like some people think thier class is ""meant"" to do, are being left in the dust. I may get some negative feedback for saying this but DPS is arbitrary in these levels of fractals and I'm sure it becomes more so later on, DPS will come from survivablity, you cant DPS if u keep getting downed and people have to res. Even me, a mesmer, running shatters or phantas dps build, gets murdered. I am forced to use purely tank/support clone tank and buff builds to really help my team, we stay alive, the dps comes, no need to rush things, theres no timer, we will get it done.

I think this is going to bring alot more situational and character build awareness to some people. It'll show them gaurdians and warriors arent the only tanks, and Ele's and Guards arent the only healers, all classes must contribute, and pure dps builds are gonna have a rough time.

edit: the point of this post is to say that in the higher levels you go in fractals, every class can bring some kind of support to the group, you dont have to go full support/tank but please be very survivable n please bring some type of support for us. 100% dps builds, if you were never downed and we never wiped, what did your build really achieve? We beat the boss a minute or two faster? Risky IMO.

I didn't actually delete the local.dat file in MyDocuments/GuildWars2 but I did send it to a backup folder so that the game would recreate it.

There's still a lot of testing to see how long this honeymoon phase lasts, but as it stands, it takes about ten seconds to take those same waypoints now.  The old file was 54mb, now it's just 1.7mb. The only thing I found that I had to do was set my graphics to how I wanted them to be again. Keybindings are all the same.

**Edit: Per vizigr0u**

&gt;Please note that if you ran the game in another language, it will reset to your default language (usually the one on your computer) and download all the sounds and text you were missing (which took me about 10 minutes). However, changing the language back in the options once you started the game again will not download any additionnal content as everything is already stored in Gw2.dat and not local.dat

1354270541.0,356,self.Guildwars2,141opp,I would love to see the respawn timers on general mobs be turned up significantly. Am I alone on this?,510,154,235,http://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/141opp/i_would_love_to_see_the_respawn_timers_on_general/,"Hey all,

I'm a *total* noob to MMO's GW2 being my first as such I don't know if there's something I'm missing or lack but this really irks me.

I feel like the respawn timer for general mobs is *far* too low. If I am walking through a fairly deadly area taking out mobs one at a time to get to a champ at the end of it there is nothing more infuriating than taking out 10 pretty brutal guys to have them all respawn before your eyes after bugger all time right as you provoke the champ (this still applies if you're in a party).

I've also had situations where I've taken out a mass of enemies around a skill point or objective to die, respawn 20mtrs away and have them all spawn back in what feels like less than 90seconds.

I see no decent argument in support of it either. Being forced to kill the same enemy over and over doesn't bring enjoyment to the game - and I'm not suggesting to turn re-spawns off all together but why not crank the timer up to 5mins or so. Make it feel like we're actually having some influence in the world, and that way when you clear an area you feel like it was time well spent rather than just a grind knowing that if you die or need to turn around and go back you're not just going to have to do it all again.

Thoughts?

**Edit:** Ok so the turn out for this post was actually much more vocal than I was expecting. I don't think I've read a single post yet that has out-and-out disagreed with the notion. So with near on everyone in support of it, my next question is what can we do about it?

I've not spent a huge amount of time on this sub, are there devs that frequent it? Is there a better/best way to bring it to ANet's attention?

This setup is a fun change of pace if you grow tired of ""jump &amp; kill or die"" moments and want to be at the frontlines of massive battles, reviving allies and standing in fires while laughing manically.

Here are the core traits we'll need:

**Update**: 

Since Gw2Skills is down, here's an alternate link:

[~The Ninja Medic Support Build on Guildhead~](http://www.guildhead.com/skill-calc#MMkc0zM0MnFvMMnFvM9MxGGzcqzozV)


[~The Ninja Medic Support Build~](http://gw2skills.net/editor/en/?fYAQNAV4YlUmiO3ey5E95EB3jiy0m6pwrjtTRUlPA;TYAqjMHJOyek7I5RA)


Since at this point you'll most likely look at 0/0/30/20/20 and go ""hahah, what."", here's a quick breakdown of how it all works together. Your role on the battlefield is switching from squishy-chaser to unkillable pain-in-the-butt AoE condition dispenser using almost nothing but the Shortbow and [Choking Gas](http://www.guildhead.com/skill/13024/choking-gas) with [Cluster Bomb](http://www.guildhead.com/skill/13041/cluster-bomb) to apply Area Weakness, which means if it shows up on your screen as hostile, you'll most likely end up tagging it. While you don't get the satisfaction of bursting down single targets, you **will** get a ridiculous amount of loot from any battle you're involved in.

Now for the hilarious fun parts: Reviving allies. You spot a Downed friend or two in distress, surrounded by carnage and 10-50 enemy Invaders. What you do now is [Shadowstep](http://www.guildhead.com/skill/13002/shadowstep) directly on top of them, then double-tap [Shadow Refuge](http://www.guildhead.com/skill/13117/shadow-refuge), which casts it on your location. 90% of the time, opponent players will now completely forget that you and your friends are even there; what happens now is this: 

* Regeneration kicks in from [Shadow Protector](http://www.guildhead.com/trait/2384/shadow-protector), which applies to Downed allies as well and speeds up the recovery process. If they're already bandaging themselves, this will usually get them up the rest of the way.

* You will start regenerating health from Shadow Protector **and** [Shadow's Rejuvenation](http://www.guildhead.com/trait/751/shadows-rejuvenation), turning any clever enemy AoE on your Shadow Refuge into a pleasant summer breeze.

* The smart enemy players that actually do catch on to your shenanigans are now too busy chasing off your [Merciful Ambush](http://www.guildhead.com/trait/2358/merciful-ambush) thief, which you can supplement with [Thieve's Guild](http://www.guildhead.com/skill/13082/thieves-guild) to create a total of **three** expendable dudes that act like giant bait pinatas dancing around your Shadow Refuge. Put on Yakety Sax. Bring popcorn.

* If for some reason your friends are Dead and not just Downed (you slowpoke), switch out [Signet of Shadows](http://www.guildhead.com/skill/13060/signet-of-shadows) for [Haste](http://www.guildhead.com/skill/13066/haste). Reviving players is an action, which is now **twice as fast**. In combination with the Rune of Mercy bonus, you can use it to scrape a dead friend off the ground with a single Refuge and still be home in time for dinner (note that +Healing doesn't affect the revival speed from Death, only from Downed).

* When you're done reviving your friends, we'll use [Bountiful Theft](http://www.guildhead.com/trait/1740/bountiful-theft) to not only steal the opponent's dignity, but also two of their Boons just because we can.

Since both Shadowstep and Shadow Refuge are Deception skills, we're reducing their CD via [Master of Deception](http://www.guildhead.com/trait/2383/master-of-deception), letting us do this whole song and dance an average of **once per minute**. If you find yourself using Haste to revive a bunch, switch out Bountiful Theft for [Trickster](http://www.guildhead.com/trait/2200/trickster) to shave off that CD as well.

Even though this is an entirely teamwork-focused build, whether you travel alone or in a group makes no difference, since groups of any less than five without focused chained roots / snares will **not be able to kill you**. Alternating between Infiltrator's Arrow, Shadowstep and Hide In Shadows along with Vit / Toughness gear (I like the Invader's set you can get for Karma) should let you escape from absolutely anything, then swing back around and continue being a nuisance. The focus on survival stats is what lets you stand in arrow cart / siege fire while using one arm to peel your buddies off the ground and the other to pick up all those loot bags from poisoned / bleeding foes. Congratulations, you are now a 23k health Thief with a degree in Saving Lives.

1347742079.0,352,self.Guildwars2,zxw47,Are you tired of the stale 5 signet warrior build? Do you actually want to be of use in dungeons and WvW? Take a look here.,514,162,274,http://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/zxw47/are_you_tired_of_the_stale_5_signet_warrior_build/,"Hi, I'm a warrior (Undead if you want to add me :P) on Yaks Bend.  I have been WvWing a lot since I got to 80 (during headstart) and i've had a chance to test a LOT of builds.

Everywhere I look I see level 80's using the same crappy 5 signet build, immediately dying in WvW/Dungeons and pretty much bringing the team down I know I must have rezzed at least 600 of them only for them to go and instantly die again. Today, I'm hoping I can change that.

What I'm about to write is a radical shift from how you 100 blade spamming warriors play the class, but if you actually try this, you will never want to go back.

**1) TRAITS**

The trait allocation is as follows:

* 10 Strength 

* 30 Defense

* 30 Tactics


Now you may say: 
""Oh how will I ever do damage"" 
or
""Pve will take to long""

But a Superior rune of bloodlust will make it seem like your damage hasn't changed, while your survivablity shot through the roof.


**2) MAJOR TRAIT SLOTS**

For Strength: Taking ""Berserkers Power"" for Pve and ""Death From above"" for wvw are your two go to traits. Death from above is invaluable when people are seigeing your gates. Simply jump down and voila, you have bought 4 seconds for your world.

For Defense: 
* Adept - Missile deflection/Turtle's Defense. (I prefer Missile deflection in pvp)
                  
* Master - Shield Master
                  
* Grandmaster - Spiked Armor/Defy Pain (I prefer spiked armor)

For Tactics: 
* Adept - Leg specialist
                 
* Master - Lung capacity
                 
* Grandmaster - Vigorous shouts. 


**3) SKILLS**

I use a Sword mainhand, Shield offhand and a Long bow.

HEALING

* Mending

UTILITY SKILLS: 

* For great justice, 
               
* Shake it off, 
                
* On my mark for PvE 
                
* And Fear me for PVP


ELITE

* Signet of rage.


**4) ARMOR/ITEMS**

I currently use the Knight's Draconic set, slotted with Runes of the soldier 
(Toughness vitality, and your shouts remove a condition at 6 runes)
My Accesories are a mix of knight's and carrion.
My sword has a superior rune of bloodlust and my shield has a superior rune of fire (30% chance of aoe on crit)

My stats are: 

* 2080 Power

* 1350 Precision

* 2039 Toughness

* 1678 Vitality

And

* Attack: 3034

* Critical Chance: 25% (45% with fury)

* Armor: 3311

* Health: 25992


**5) PLAYSTYLE**

* PVE: Your Shouts will do ~ 1500 healing each at level 80 to everyone who is in range of you. This means that every 20 seconds you have to capacity to heal your party for 4500 health. You will be doing this OFTEN. Your F1 and your  Cripple skill both immobilize, so whenever a monster starts to chase one of your squishys, They will have ~6 seconds to escape and heal up. On top of this. YOUR SHOUTS REMOVE CONDITIONS. 4 every 20 seconds in fact. Your party will thank you when they never have to worry about immobilize, poison, bleeding or cripple/chill.



* WvW: You will not die. Ever. I can run from tower to tower with ~7 80's whaling on me. You will be rezzing people (you res faster from tactics, and you give might to nearby allies when you do) and if you need to fight you will be able to. I can win 2v1's quite easily and 3v1's if they are ranged characters. (level 80's) Also if you come across a 5 signet great sword warrior you can laugh as he barely scratches you. You will jump down onto seiges, do massive damage, heal up and repeat. 

**Something to note**

Because of your traits, your signet of fury will give you 40 seconds of the boons instead of 30. If you combine that with ""Charge"" from a warhorn you will have perpetual swiftness :D


**Thanks for reading.**
 Hopefully you will take some of this to heart and try it out. If even 1 person sees this and becomes a better player because of it. I'm happy.

Everyone is up in arms about this, but the fact of the matter is most people see ""3,000 permanently banned"", and they instantly flip their shit. Yet, they have no facts. They don't question how many weapons these people bought. It was a VERY obvious exploit and it would have hit the economy hard.



I actually just saw someone post this: 



""I won't lie, I probably bought a couple hundred. I spent a couple thousand karma on this. However people have spent in the range of 20k-100k exploiting this, I would consider that heavy, I'd say the probably 20 or so 75-80 weapons I made would be mild when they're making hundreds.""
(source:http://www.reddit.com/user/Kentiah)



Even at ""only"" 6,000 karma, that is equivalent to around 300 weapons. That is absolutely a substantial amount. Melt them down in the mystic forge, etc. make a shit-load of gold and have full legendary gear. I call bullshit on anyone who says that isn't worth a permanent ban.

A couple months ago, I decided to stop being poor in-game. My playing time is fairly limited, and I'm not interested in grinding. However, I enjoy playing with MMO economies, and it's something I've done before. So I started looking for quick ways to make a buck.

This guide summarizes some methods I've found. 

* Each technique can be done in a few minutes, or for many hours, depending on how much time you want to spend.
* These are ""standing still"" techniques. You don't have to leave town. You don't have to kill things, complete events, etc.
* Most of these techniques don't require a lot of seed money to get started. However, the more you start with, the more you can invest.

I won't be covering any grinding, or methods more in line with ""normal gameplay"". I think we all know about CoF, and pretty much any other grinding or ""normal"" play is going to be less profitable than that.

**A note for those who disdain ""playing the economy""**

There is an interesting group of people who find it offensive that lots of money can be made through arbitrage and ""market manipulation"" and all manner of virtual-banker techniques, while real players have to eke out a living with the meager drops they receive through normal play.

I do understand how it can feel unfair that performing the core activities of the game leaves you dirt-poor. But consider this - I only dedicate 5-10% of my playing time to money making. When I'm using the techniques in this guide, I'm not really playing, I'm just making gold. However, in the remaining 90% of my time, I do whatever I feel like. I enjoy it, and I never ever worry about how much gold I'm making per hour. My 90% play time feels much more liberated because I don't have to worry about gold. And really, that 10% time where I'm just making gold - that can be pretty fun too, in its own way.

These are the resources I use on a regular basis. I'll explain them in more detail in subsequent posts.

I have posted countless times on the forums and have yet to get a response from anet.

I understand that we are a small percent of players and most of you probably wont care or even know that this is a major issue when attempting to play the game. For the first few months I actually had no idea that there were circle indicators on the ground for good and even bad spells. During this time when running a dungeon if I died to spikes in AC people would just laugh at me. ITS A DISABILITY, you don't go laughing at people in wheelchairs for taking a goddamned ramp.

Even now that I know there are circles on the ground I still can't do a thing about it. After the spider boss in AC I will sit at the base of the ramp and when people ask me why and I tell them to please just hit the chain so i can walk up without dying sometimes I get a response of ""no, quit being lazy"" I am really tired of this treatment and I am calling of people on this subreddit to help make anet know this is an issue that effects real people playing this game. Hopefully with enough support something can actually come of this and anet will quit ignoring people with this disability who want to play this game.

Thank you for taking the time to read this.

Edit: Hey guys, I just wanted to address a few things that people have said. When I start a dungeon I do inform members that for the most part I am not able to see any aoe on the group and to work with me if something does go wrong, for the most part this is not an issue as most people are ok with it. There are times when users will just be jerks but you know you just kinda have to ignore it and get over it.

As for some people asking what they should do, League of Legends has a really great colorblind mode that they added a year ago or so that just changes the colors of some spells and effects to other colors that us users have a better time seeing and telling them apart.  As one other user posted /u/Rajani_Isa a great example that all people without colorblindness should watch just to understand what some of us have to deal with http://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/18b78x/colorblind_mode/c8dfn9a 

As for people suggesting to mess around with my monitors hue, I have tried this and really it just seems to make things worse and the game looks even worse and the problems sadly just even worsen. Plus when I only play for maybe an hour out of day then I have to go take care of real life issues, I'd rather not have to spend 5-10 mins playing around with color when it would just be easier to hit a button ingame and never have to worry about it again.

If anyone would have any suggestions on how to actually make anet aware of this besides posting on the fourms as that sadly doesn't work, that would be great. 

As always, thank you for taking the time to read what I've type and I am glad to know there are people in this game who actually care.",,False,self,t5_2r9po,1360623830.0,,,True,t3_18b78x,http://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/18b78x/colorblind_mode/,

*WvWvW is great fun.* If any of you come from DAoC you have an idea of just how amazing GW2's WvWvW can be.

I've put together what I feel is an extremely comprehensive critique of the current implementation, with many suggestions. Key things that I would like to see addressed:

* WvWvW matchmaking [I actually built a tool to demonstrate problems with this right here](http://journals.rpgnexus.net/zenatrophy/gw2-thoughts/)
* Stonemist early game
* Direction of Squads &amp; commanders
* WvWvW Dungeon
* Final days WvW disaffection

I'd like to compile an exhaustive list of reasonable WvWvW requests. Please suggest things.

**WvW matchmaking in BWE2 was broken.**
####################

ArenaNet is specifically unhappy with how it turned out:

&gt; I’m really sorry folks, I don’t think there’s going to be much we can do except look into what happened and try to make sure it doesn’t happen again. 
- [Mike Ferguson](https://forum-en.guildwars2.com/forum/pvp/wuvwuv/Servers-do-not-rematch/page/1#post206657)


Glicko is their current ranking tool. Read more about it [here](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glicko_rating_system).

In BWE2, players kept finding their servers being thrown up against insanely silly matches, where they would be fighting two tiny servers with maybe 20 people playing WvW between the two of them. **Being matched against a tiny server sucks.** You conquer the entire world within an hour of play time, after which there's nothing to do. Being a tiny server sucks even more: you can achieve essentially nothing against a force forty times your size. *People on both sides just stop playing WvW.*

&gt; WvW matches: Tiny server matchups suck &amp; Glicko problems

A lot of people seemed to feel this problem would ""sort itself out"" if you just played enough matches, but you'd be surprised at just how many ""enough"" matches are.

**Rather than me telling you ""I've done the math,"" I'm going to link [you to a tool I've specifically written](http://journals.rpgnexus.net/zenatrophy/gw2-thoughts/) to allow everyone to explore the data themselves,**even if they aren't mathematicians or programmers. Please check it out. Hit Load Real Servers, and if you have a slow machine, remove the check mark from animation. Run about twenty fights.

You'll quickly notice that not only do bad matches happen a lot, they continue to happen (on average) for at least twelve rounds of combat. Thereafter, there's a small level of what I call ""churn"" which I'll explain latter that accounts for the remaining mismatches. The mismatches persist for so long because:

*  ""tiny"" servers lose at the same time as normal servers,
* and then they  end up fighting the losing normal servers subsequently.
* Likewise, tiny servers matched against tiny servers re-elevate the their 1st and 2nd place servers back into the general fray.

Fixes include:

* pre-ranking servers based on population rather than alphabetization (pretty sure that happened in BWE2)
* dramatically increasing the RD for a server during the calculation of that round's points if they lose by orders of magnitude in point value
* this would force all low-pop servers to the bottom
* note that this should only be for losing, since dramatic point boosts for destroying 20-man servers would break things
* make sure the RD is a reasonable value: as it approaches 1, the rankings will stop moving entirely


&gt; WvW matches: Rapid **rank point inflation.**

When ArenaNet awards ""2"" wins for first place, and ""1"" win for second place, the rank values start becoming deeply distorted. Why? Because once ranked correctly, the average server will gain ""1"" win point per fight (since 1st, 2nd, and 3rd are all equally likely) and the points begin spiralling out of control. Adding new servers when there's no longer an index value will mean new servers won't be placed correctly. It also boosts churn and contributes to anomalies. A server should in fact gain ""0.5"" points per fight on average, when correctly ranked, in order for Glicko to operate meaningfully. That would be 1 point and 0.5 of a point for 1st and 2nd. Don't believe me? [Try it out.](http://journals.rpgnexus.net/zenatrophy/gw2-thoughts/) 

* fix rank inflation by correcting point distribution to 1 and 0.5

&gt;WvW matches: **Stagnation** is a long term problem.

We haven't seen it because we've only been playing weekends, but eventually the servers will settle into a fixed rank. Try it out in the tool. Glicko is not a *matchmaking* system, so eventually we'll always be fighting the same 3-4 servers. Glicko needs a matchmaking feature that pulls opponents from the same approximate rank, rather than just the nearest two servers, in order to keep combat fresh.


**Stonemist Early Game**
###############

&gt;  Stonemist is hugely vital. And it happens to be that it gets conquered in about 15 minutes on high-pop servers. 

I think this is not as fun as it could be. Stonemist should not be a 15-minute tug of war that goes to the guys with the fastest computers.

&gt; * I'd like to see Stonemist require siege weapons to conquer for the first time.*

It should be a day-1 victory in the first 4-8 hours of play, not a 15-minute slam fest. Because Stonemist offers a portal, the controller can project twice the *sustained force* against nearby objectives. Stonemist is the key asset for early map control.

Here's just some of the valid strategies during the first couple of hours if Stonemist's neutral NPCs defend with arrow carts, oil and ballistas:

* Solidy supply lines first for an early assault on SM before other teams are ready
* Capture a nearby keep and fortify it, prepare counterassault to prevent player from capturing SM
* Run interdiction against enemy supply, denying them the ability to mount effective assaults on SM
* Ignore SM and make a frontal assault on an undefended homeworld
* Allow the other servers to breach SM outerwalls, launch sneak attack while they are assaulting inner walls

These are just some of the valid strategies that can be employed when SM is not a minute-zero objective. Here's the valid strategy if SM is zergable:

* zerg Stonemist

So yes, not only would we derive greater satisfaction from putting genuine effort &amp; planning into capturing Stonemist, exemplifying good strategy.



**Commanders &amp; Squads**
###############

&gt; Commanders right now have a few key problems:

* Commanders without guilds must rely on recruiting from the zerg
* They do need a way to gather squads up. Relying on people to invite themselves wasn't happening
* Invites are good, but a ""invite everyone standing next to me"" button on a cooldown is better during action
* The objective icons they set are far too small. I couldn't even see them without looking
* They don't currently have a good way to communicate amongst themselves to coordinate

It remains to be seen what will happen when there are dozens of commanders running around the map. Will this diminish their usefulness?

**WvWvW Dungeon**
################

&gt; Someone recently complained that they didn't feel like they ""accomplished"" anything by doing the dungeon.

I actually agree with this. The blueprints don't really feel like you've contributed to the the ""world."" I'd love to see completing the dungeon give your server a small buff (like +10 power) for three or so hours. The buff should be more or less insignificant, but still contribute. Modeled the same way the orbs of power are. Perhaps a ""Fragment of the Amulet of Yendor.""


**Final Week disaffection**
#######################
&gt; We haven't experienced this yet, but the incentive to compete in WvW will be reduced during the final days of WvW. 

At that point it will be obvious to one or two servers that they're just not going to win and they can't change that. Rather than having an exciting fight all the way to the end, you have a lackluster finale where one or both of your enemies just really isn't throwing their heart into it.

&gt; I'd much rather see every team giving it their all in the last two days of WvW. There's a couple of ways to achieve this:

* ""Last holding"" bonus where the server gets some special benefits for the share of the map they held when the match end
* Boosting the point value of held zones
* Offering special quests to disrupt particular keeps or zones of the leading player(s) with rewards
* Potentially hide the points from the players
* Alternatively, give points based on percentage of map held 
* increasing frequency and impact of dynamic events towards the final day
* cap last day with mega-dynamic event


**Miscellaneous Bugs**
######################

* Specifically in WvW, map vs team chat channels do exactly the same thing. We don't need both.
* The supply gathered carries between matches. It should reset.
* WvWvW resets at 3 AM EST/12 AM PST give a huge early lead to Westcoast servers
* Supply mechanic needs a tutorial, it's confusing
* The wildlife often kills players before they can find teammates 
* Hard to find other people on low pop servers, no real rally point, no indication of where people are, often fight is over before they get there
* We die a lot more in WvW than in PvE. The armor should be damaged less frequently than in PvE to handle cash loss


**Fun Ideas**
######################
* special chests that spawn when a keep is held for 24 hours by a Guild. (encouraging defense over zerg)
* World Events for losing server to help turn the tide. Ride out from Rohan, etc
* Dynamic events: ""Our scouts in the area discovered a lost crate of the enemy siege blueprints. Capture them in the next 30 minutes!""
* SM is fine at lower pop, but should scale up defenses to the size of the three server populations
*  A few more choke points in the map would add to strategic value of controlling mountain passes,",,False,self,t5_2r9po,1339846202.0,,,True,t3_v45tf,http://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/v45tf/indepth_analysis_of_wvw_glicko_i_also_made_a_tool/,

So...uh...yeah. Yesterday was kinda insane. I had intended to make Part 5 this morning but I had to talk about this first. Yall are awesome, and a lil bit crazy. 

 First, thanks for all the kind words of gratitude. I'm really not some expert on the game. There were actually several things I didn't know about myself that have been brought up in comments. So I learned as much from these posts as yall did. 

 Also, I am not incredibly rich nor did I make any gold from this. (I have like 4g) The only gold I have in game is from me farming and most of those mats go toward crafting exotic gear. Speculating on the market has always been low profit or a wash for me. Just don't have the knack for it. I honestly couldn't even fathom the response these posts received from the community. My guildies are a bit cross I failed to give them a heads up about the market going nuts, which I find hilarious. 

As for the market. Sorry. [This](http://gw2tp.com/i/2839) was shown to me by user cherise605 and kinda blew my mind.
 
 That was just one piece of the Traveler's set and I know these posts affected a large chunk of the items in the current market. I know this because I was trying to get some Gossamer Scraps and they had jumped in price as well....so kinda screwed myself there. All I can say is let the market stabilize over the next week or so and prices should go down I hope. 

 My goal with these posts was to help beginners who were struggling with the same things I struggled with on my way to 80. And also to give some guidance to level 80s who were feeling completely overwhelmed by Orr. HOPEFULLY, with all these new MF people in the various worlds, more and more yellows will be found and converted to Exotics, then those exotics will be converted to legendaries, and everyone will get cooler items for cheaper. I would like to think that given time, everyones overall wealth will increase because of these posts.

 Also, to those that have posed questions. I have answered the ones I felt I had a good understanding of, but some I feel could be better answered by others. I may make a post with my particular builds/understanding of Warriors and Guardians since those are my mains, but I would prefer others in the community create their own posts about their own classes. I am really looking forward to the [Mesmer guide](http://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/zpd2b/as_promised_the_comprehensive_mesmer_guide_parts/) created by Prometheus0110. This is what our community was created for so be sure to thank him. 

When I finish with the last Part, I think I will go through all the comments and update/correct my original posts so that they can be referred back to for a while to come. Also, if you can verify something I said is wrong (like there being no Pow/Vit/Tough armor), please make a reply and I will modify my info. I was very happy to learn that I could get 4/6 of my armor set on my warr with Pow/Vit/Tough from a karma vendor. Though now I need to find a way to farm 120k+ karma....that'll be fun.

*NOTE: I found those 4/6 piece at Melandrus Temple in the Cursed Shore for 44k a pop. I could only afford the chest right now. The Helm and Boots did not have those stats so I had a couple Pow/Tough/Healing ones made for me.*

I will get started on the next Parts in a bit. Thanks again and see yall in game.

How to make them and where they come from.,430,81,416,http://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/13gj0p/ascended_gear_and_infusions_how_to_make_them_and/,"Hi everyone! I'm a moderately active wiki editor and redditor and I'd like to consolidate all of the combined knowledge on Ascended gear and Infusions in one easy post here (since I know a lot of you don't read the wiki [SHAMELESS PLUG](http://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Ascended)).

###Backslots

There are 2 versions of back slots: Quivers, which have an offensive infusion slot, and Books, which have a defensive infusion slot.

##The basic recipe
* 250 Teir 6 fine crafting material
* 1 Vial of Condensed Mists Essence
* 50 Globs of Ectoplasm
* 24 skill points

The skill points item determines whether you get a Quiver or a Book. 24 skill points worth of Philosopher stones will make a Quiver, 24 skill points worth of Crystals will make a book.

There are 5 different variations of the back item, corresponding to 5 of the Tier 6 crafting materials. Totems, Venom Sacs, Karka Shells, and Dust do not have a recipe.

#Vials of Powerful Blood: **Quiver of Swift Flight / Book of Secrets**
* +24  Power 
* +17  Precision 
* +1%  Critical Damage 
* +32  Power 
* +18  Precision 
* +4%  Critical Damage

#Vicious Fangs: **Bowyer's Delight / Koss on Koss**
* +24  Power 
* +17  Toughness 
* +17  Vitality 
* +32  Power 
* +18  Toughness 
* +18  Vitality

#Ancient Bones: **Endless Quiver / Tome of the Rubicon**
* +17  Precision 
* +17  Toughness 
* +24  Condition Damage 
* +32  Condition Damage 
* +18  Precision 
* +18  Toughness

#Armored Scales: **Sights be True / Symon's History of Ascalon**
* +17  Power 
* +24  Toughness 
* +1%  Critical Damage 
* +32  Toughness 
* +18  Power 
* +4%  Critical Damage

#Vicious Claws: **Quiver of a Thousand Arrows / There With Yakkington: A Traveler's Tale**
* +17  Toughness 
* +17  Vitality 
* +32  Power 
* +18  Toughness 
* +18  Vitality 
* +5%  Magic Find

##Infused Back Slot

Once you've created a backslot item, you can infuse it. Infusing the back slot is expensive, and adds a built in +5 Agony resistance.

The recipe to infuse a back slot is:

* Base back slot item
* Glob of Coagulated Mists Essence
* 250 Globs of Ectoplasm
* Gift of Ascension

###Rings

There currently isn't a lot known about ascended rings. What we do know is that you have a *chance* of getting an ascended ring from the daily chest (mini chest that appears above your minimap) at the end of fractal difficulty 10+ (aka Tier 2). More info in speculation section below.

###Infusions

There are 2 basic infusions that you can purchase inside the fractals, a defensive Simple infusion costs 75 fractal relics and grants +5 Agony resistance, and a Versatile Simple Infusion costs 225 fractal relics and can be used in offensive or defensive slots.

Additional Infusions can be crafted with the following recipe:

* 250 Karka Shells
* 100 Tier 6 Crafting Material
* 20 Mystic Coins
* Eldritch Scroll

Offensive Infusions have +5 to an offensive stat in addition to the +5 agony resistance.

* Malign Infusion +5 Condition Damage
* Mighty Infusion +5 Power
* Precise Infusion +5 Precision


Defensive Infusions have +5 to a defensive stat in addition to the +5 agony resistance.

* Resilient Infusion +5 Toughness
* Healing Infusion +5 Healing
* Soothing Infusion +2% Agony Duration Reduction
* Bounteous Infusion +1% Boon Duration
* Vital Infusion +5 Vitality
* Simple Infusion (Only +5 Agony Resistance)

All infusions have a normal version, and a versatile version. The versatile version can be used in offensive or defensive slots, wheras the normal version can only be used in that specific type of infusion slot.

**I'm not 100% on the above breakdown of which ones count as offensive and which ones count as defensive**

###Fractal Weapon Skins

These aren't directly related to ascended gear, but you get them as random drops in tier 3+ (Difficulty 20+). They are account bound so if you get a skin you can't use you can transfer it to another character you own, but you can't sell them or trade them.

###Agony

Agony is a debuff that isn't a condition (can't be removed by condition removal) that ticks away percentages of your health. Agony first shows up in tier 2 (10+) from special boss moves. With no agony resistance each tick will remove 1/8 (12.5%) of your health. Having just 5 agony resistance will cut that damage hit in half to 1/16 (6.25%).

I am unsure if agony hits harder in higher tiers, thus necessitating more and more agony resistance.

###Speculation

* I believe the Shards of Crystallized Mists Essence (possible drop in tier 3, or combined using 5 tier 2 or 25 tier 1 mists essences) are the key to creating versatile infusions, and to infusing the basic rings that you can get as drops.

* I have a feeling there are more recipes that use the Glob of Coagulated Mists Essence than the 2 that we have found.

* I assume that the Prototype Fractal Capacitor that can be purchased using Fractal Relics can be infused in the same manner as the 10 other back slot items, but I haven't seen any hard evidence to prove this.

###Tertiary Info

Fractals are seperated into tiers. 1-9 is Tier 1, nothing causes agony, no significant upscaling of mobs, vials of essence can drop. 10-19 is tier 2, bosses cause agony, globs of essence can drop, daily chest can give you a ring. 20-29 is tier 3, more agony causing effects, mobs have additional abilities, Fractal weapons can drop. I don't know of anyone that has made it to tier 4.

There is a daily reward completion for each tier. Each tier has a different subset of possible rewards. I recommend at least doing the tier 2 (difficulty 10) daily each day as it has a chance to give you an Ascended ring.

###Closing

Any additional info (or corrections) are gladly welcomed. If you don't feel comfortable editing the wiki (I'm pretty terrible at it myself...) feel free to post info here and I'll get it in there.

There has been a lot of talk around the mystic forge skins and finding their recipes, so I've made a spreadsheet of everything I've seen listed that does not have to do with legendaries. This should help research by giving people an easy way to check what is known and what has already been made.   
https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0AvQFBweLyTK7dGNoTm1oWVI2NkkwY2VlTlZINURPeWc#gid=0
  
  
The spreadsheet is split into 4 parts:  
-Known Exotic Recipes: This list is alphabetized for the non-mystic coin/scroll components. If you want to avoid wasting time crafting something known, you should check here first. (Note that component 1 and 2 are in alphabetical order too)  
-Unknown Recipes: Exotic recipes are alphabetized, non-exotics (Things that don't use scrolls) get their own section. Items in red are known to be bugged, don't make them!  
-Known General Recipes: Includes conversion recipes, miscellaneous recipes, upgrade recipes, anything that's not an exotic.  
-Legendaries Related Recipes  


If you do forge an exotic, please tell in the comments what the recipe was. If you are planning on using it, please provide a screenshot of it being wielded (Not preview) since some effects may only show up outside the preview. If you are going to sell it at least take a screenshot of the preview for us.


Things I really care about:  
-In action screenshots of known forged exotics for those without them. (Meaning you actually equipped it and used it in combat) Previews are unreliable, they often don't show all the effects of these weapons. 
Examples:

Sometimes even watching when I played things like Skyrim with a good story. When I got GW2 about a month ago I fell in love with it. She had watched me some and thought the game was neat but never expressed an interest in playing. I was so mesmerized by the game, all the things that you could do and the amazing experiences that went with it. So on a whim I bought it for her for Christmas this year not knowing what the end result would be because even though she did not mind me playing she did not play her self. SHE LOVES IT! Because it allows her to play how she wants. Most of the time she stands around the maw to play it 10-15 a day, or just runs around talking to NPC's to see what dialog they have. I'm glad that GW2 has something to offer for everyone and has bridged the gap of gaming with my wife and I. We play together every night even if it's nothing more than running around the map killing mobs. Plus it's great to have someone close to share the wonderful experiences this game has to offer.

 So to the guys out there who have girls who don't play games have them try it, you might be surprised at the end result :)

They are **costly**, most have one use (usually a short duration) and they **do not offer good value for cost**.

**I have several ideas for solving this issue and**, with any luck, getting a bit more cash flow into Arenanet's pockets.

First off, **all unused cash shop items (including Black Lion Chest Keys and items) need to be tradeable**. All of them, regardless. This is important for several reasons, but mainly it is to allow more cash flow around these items, to give several of them more use and to just make them generally better.

**How to improve each individual item**:-     
**Town Cosmetics** - Purchasing and using these needs to apply them across your entire account similar to HoM items, and they should be freely buyable from a vendor when you get them. This is to stop them taking up bag / bank space, allow players to return to their default town gear and just make them generally more worthwhile.     
**Combat Cosmetics** - Purchasing and using these should do EXACTLY THE SAME as the HoM. It's ridiculous that players should have to purchase transmutation stones in order to transfer these onto different sets of gear. Also, allow them to have PvP equivalents that are in the same purchase.    
**Black Lion Keys / Chest Items** - Make them tradeable. At the moment, no one will buy these. All they give you is things to fill up your bank, stuff that you don't particularly want and items that you can use to harvest but not just yet. Everything here should be tradeable. Once that's done, it fixes everything.       
**Fun Items** - Bind to account, put a cooldown on it maybe, but these should not be used up once used. It makes them worthless to purchase. Reward the players and give them unlimited uses, and reward yourselves by getting more sales.    
**PvP Fun items** - Need to have a slot on your PvP gear (maybe use the back slot?) to put these in. The ones from the PvP chests should only be used for about 30 minutes, but the ones sold in the gem shop should have permanency.

**Please, Arenanet, help us out with this. We want to buy from your shop, but we cannot justify it with how it works at the moment.**",,False,self,t5_2r9po,1346499910.0,,CharrEn,True,t3_z6hlm,http://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/z6hlm/gem_shop_items_need_to_be_more_permanent/,

If you are trying to play with friends, you most likely already faced the frustration overflows can be, but theres an option that lets you travel to your party's overflow called ""join in"" which you can see by right clicking on your friend's portrait **while in the same zone**. This option is currently slightly bugged, making it work sometimes, but there are ways to make it work **all the time**:

- If you cant see the ""join in"" option and you are in the same zone, rezoning(Char selection/map changing) fixes it. You can tell who needs to do this by checking out the party UI. If someone's location in the party UI is in another map, then that person needs to rezone.

- If you can see the ""join in"" option but it errors, rezoning fixes it.

- If its still not working, then the other person needs to do it.

- The issue with ""join in"" not working sometimes or erroring seem to be because of issues with certain overflows, so when you rezone you change to another overflow.

- Avoid playing in your character's home world unless all your party can get in there.

I'm not saying they shouldnt fix it, but you can enjoy the game meanwhile using this bandaid fix.

EDIT: By ""relogging"", I mean just character selection, any kind of zoning seems to take care of the issue, so going to the mist, changing maps, etc, are solutions too.

Make sure the other people do that too, just in case they are the ones in a ""bugged overflow"" or with the ""position bug"", since if thats the case it doesnt matter how much you relog since they have to do it.

EDIT2: If zoning its not fixing it, then the other person is the one that needs to rezone or **both** of you. The issue of ""join in"" not appearing, erroring or not doing anything seem to happen when you are in an overflow with ""issues"", which could be it being full. So if both of you rezone(relog, change maps, etc) it should fix itself. If its not working for you, then post here with details so we can help you out, dont stubbornly insist that its not working while not listening to advice, we can help you if you are willing to listen.

 Anyone else like the idea of Class specific armor skins? Possibly add in NPC ""Leaders"" for each profession who sells them like the cultural armor. have them be at different intervals, 35,55,80 with 35 and 55 being mixed money/karma  and lvl 80 being bought by rare token items that drop from high level bosses and dungeons etc, hard enough to make getting a full set a big deal, but purly cosmetic so your not grinding for the best gear or anything.

Great job on the launch.  Just a handful of things I'd like to see changed, if possible, please.  Given how short the list is, it's obvious I'm enjoying the heck out of the game.  This would just make it more enjoyable.

 - I want them to change the ""Travel to instance/Requeue"" prompt to stop coming up in my face. Flash an icon on my screen, just like having to leave an instance. It's inconvenient.  I enjoy being on overflow, it's quieter :)
 - We should never have to work to be in the same instance. Way too many times I've stood around while people hop around zones, trying to all end up in the same instance. At the very least, if the zone is near x% full, it should shunt the entire group off into the same overflow.
 - After a major event, the chest needs to be called out better. Several times I've killed a big boss, only to find out the chest was far away, where the guy spawned, and I had no idea. If it's the reward for event, I should know where it is. Give us a green arrow path, like on the story missions.  Column of light.  Something.
 - Take, Use and Talk Too need to be on a different button than Loot. This is huge for me, with the events we have, dozens of bodies on the ground, and either npc's wandering around or items to click on to interact with, or weapons to pick up, it's tedious to go body to body. Or give me ""Loot Area All"" like in TOR.
 - We can't trade with each other, directly. The lack of secure trading is a pain.
 - When I double click on something in my inventory to put it in my bank, it should stack with other things in my bank.

Thanks again for the great game.  I'd post this on the GW2 forums, but the last time I checked they weren't up yet, and I know the devs read here.

However, if [Whiteside Ridge::Queensdale] is full, you'll need to wait, since there are no resource left for you to play on your own world. While PvP regions will basically lock down and you'll have to queue up for them, in PvE there is a system called *overflow*. An overflow shard is simply a server which runs a copy of the instance you desire to visit. This will enable you to queue up for your original world's Queensdale, while still keep playing.

**What's the problem of overflows?** Many people actually get confused when they first visit an overflow shard. They aren't familiar with the system yet, so they might think that they are still on their home world, resulting in confusion when suddenly people start to speak in other languages (especially on EU servers). They might even confront them, telling them they should get off their precious world and go into their own, for examples if a player from [Abaddon's Mouth [DE]::Queensdale] gets on an overflow. Also it's sometimes hard to get on the same overflow if you try to group with other people, for example if player A is on [Queensdale::Overflow #1] and player B on [Queensdale::Overflow #3].

**How can I check whether I'm on an overflow?** Usually a message will appear when you enter the specific zone. If you happen to miss the message, you can just check your minimap. It will show your current region's name and ""Overflow"" if you're in an overflow.

**What should I do when I'm on an overflow?** Just continue playing. If you try to group with other players in the same overflow, it should work without problems. If other players join in later, they should get automatically moved to your overflow if they weren't in the zone before they joined the group. Otherwise they can click on your icon and use ""Join in"" to actually join your overflow shard (notice that this was broken in both the last stress test and the first hours of the headstart, I guess this has to do with authentification aka login issues).

If you encounter someone who doesn't seem to understand the overflow system, looks for guild member, or is agressive about people speaking English, explain them the system. It's one thing to hate someone for his actions, but a greater deed to tutor someone into a happier experience.

**How long do I have to stay on an overflow?** That depends completely on your world's region's load. It can take up to one hour, or end instantly. This is why you should try to gain a friendly atmosphere on an overflow shard, as you may be stuck for another hour with these people.

Don't forget, the more you know, the more you can teach, the more you'll help. Hopefully this helps some people to handle overflow situations. See you all in game, when the log in servers are ready again.

1374721441.0,345,self.Guildwars2,1j04fg,Proposed effects of Charisma/Nobility/Aggression on characters,394,49,104,http://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/1j04fg/proposed_effects_of_charismanobilityaggression_on/,"**Plain and simple:** Charisma/Nobility/Aggression would be much more interesting if it affected the way your character composed themselves in some way.  It could effect things like:

**Character stance in and out of combat** - Charismatic characters may lean on a staff less, or swing their arms a bit, something to show them loosening up before combat, a noble character could stand perfectly straight, their movements maybe more reserved, and an aggressive character in combat may be more hunched or simply lower to the ground than others


**Character idle animations** - Charismatic character may smile and be more lively, swinging arms or waving if an NPC is withing x range, Noble characters could adjust/examine armor or simply put a hand on their hips, while an Aggressive character may survey the area, squinting or raising a hand to get a better survey of an area

**Animations made when conversing with an NPC** - Charismatic characters would be animated, making opening gestures and maintaining open posture, a Noble character could be stoic or conservative, while an aggressive character would be slightly dismissive, perhaps crossing their arms or keeping their body language closed

The thing is, while they do have an appeal to the roleplay side of a character, since the rest of the game is relatively rp weak, fleshing out the systems they have in place already may be easier than adding new emotes and stuff, but I guess this would present it's own issues as well.It should also be noted that I know some of these may not be entirely practical and it should go for lore accuracy and such first before simply being silly about it lest we end up with disconnected characters and actions.

For the record, I am in no way saying these would be easy, I'm just saying it would give the game some nice little detailing that may appeal to some people like me who are interested in the rp of the game.

(Up to date builds as of the June 25 patch.),410,67,125,http://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/1hrm83/tpvp_build_list_up_to_date_builds_as_of_the_june/,"Hello my name is Dantes. I keep an up to date build page for my guildmates. A few of them recommended that I share it with more people. Not all builds are created equal and some builds require different mind sets. So here are 3 different sets of builds for each class that are up to date and viable in ranked matches. I say ranked matches as you will see builds run tournaments on Twitch, that is a very different environment than ranked matches. Some of those builds are specific to team comps others there are little choice in builds since that is the best build at the time/meta. In ranked matches you typically don't fight the best players who pump out the utmost efficiency in their builds. So other builds often time shine even if they wouldn't in a competitive tournament. I will give a quick comment on each of the builds. 

Basically this is a meta tPvP build list. 

**Elementalist**

* [S/D Double Arcane](http://intothemists.com/calc/?build=-k34;2R0-P0w47N-Z0;9;5J-JT;159;204-45A5o0;3sV2DsV2D4BB): This is the standard S/D Ele build and very popular. It hits really hard, great survivability, and good team support. The skill cap for this build is surprisingly high due to skill shots on fire and management of water attunement.  

* [D/D triple cantrip](http://intothemists.com/calc/?build=-k33;2R0VU015-N-Z0;9;59-TT;10;348B45A4o0;3sV2DsV2D4BX): The famous D/D triple cantrips build has recently fallen out of meta due to nerfs to cantrips and buffs to other builds. Though people still run it and it's a viable build, if you have run Ele for a long time the slowdowns are noticeable. 

* [Fresh Air S/D Burst](http://intothemists.com/calc/?build=-k34;2R0-U015-N-Z0;9;5T-9T;159B;14;045A5w0;3Ewk2Ewk25Bu): This is the new S/D burst build. It uses a berserk amulet instead of a Valkyrie amulet and has less points in water making it very squishy. But it hits like truck and fresh air allows for consistent air bursts. 


**Necromancer**

* [Condition Terror/Dhummfire](http://intothemists.com/calc/?build=;044Z;1kHFG0A4oJkJ0;9;4TJ9-904A48-1;32;0EJG4;2hoHAhoHA2Vr): The new Dhummfire/Terror build is very powerful and gives Necro large amounts of counter pressure. The base of the build is simply 30/20/0/0/0 with 20 points free to spend. Some variations of the build are 20 in Death magic in order to buff staff or 20 in Soul reaping for Master of Terror. Feel free to place them where you prefer. 

* [Minion Master](http://intothemists.com/calc/?build=;04-_;1kH-D0z3oI-K0;9;4J-JT-08;229-16A;1XNV7;2nBnBnBnB6gF): MM is surprisingly effective at times but in other times you will be yelling profanities at your minions. The build isn't very popular but is very powerful in it's own way and should not be quickly dismissed. 

* [Zerker Wellmancer](http://www.intothemists.com/calc/?build=;04-8c;0kHFJ0D4wJVJ0;9;4TJ-J-07B57;207;2LNV45;1sV2DsV2D5Bd): Power builds have always been less popular than condition builds on Necro. But wells are very strong AoE damage and Lich Form with a zerker amulet hits incredibly hard. 

**Mesmer**

* [Burst Shatter](http://intothemists.com/calc/?build=-NFcg;1VPV11A7JVF71;9;4JJ;0T06-39;505A5wl6;2sV2DsV2D5Bi): The most common build in tPvP due to it being strong in team fights and strong in 1v1. Portal is arguably the strongest utility skill in the game and Moa is very strong at shutting down bunkers. 

* [Phantasm S/P Greatsword](http://intothemists.com/calc/?build=-Ng-FR;0VPVz0O7kWF71;9;4JJ-T-29-18;2345;1U-V0U;1sV2DsV2D5BB): Phantasm builds where nerfed in the last patch and they where never popular in tPvP to begin with. But they are still considered very strong in 1v1s and are still very much viable. 

* [Condition Shatter](http://intothemists.com/calc/?build=-N3SZ;1VPkz0y6JVV71;9;49O9-O4;049-4;345-Uok6;2hoHAhoHA2VC): The condition Mesmer has similar problems as a phantasm Mesmer. Very strong in 1v1 but very much okay in team fights. Condition shatter is very hard to deal with since Mesmer packs survivability with their clones and condition damage. Destroying them causes conditions on you but not destroying them causes conditions on you. 

Moa Morph vs Time Warp: These two elites are interchangeable and they are both considered very stong. I have won fights because of Time Warp and I have also won fights because of Moa Morph. 

**Engineer**

* [HGH](http://intothemists.com/calc/?build=-VRR;2Z;0h0m5cQFx0;9;4T9-T-49A5;319A;1a-1;3hoHAhoHA2VI): Has recently fallen out of meta but still very powerful. The amulet and runes are usually up to person preference. Rabid and Rampager are the two most common amulets. And Might duration runes or standard Condition runes are also choices. 

* [Nodefighter/Teldo Style Engi](http://intothemists.com/calc/?build=VVRw;0B-cPVv0c-gTFx0;9;4T9-J92475;308-5;0Uw;1w0-hoHAhoHA2cT): This build is very strong in 1v1s but has a very noticeable skill floor. A player that is skilled with this build will wipe the floor of almost anyone but a player that uses it poorly will have major difficulties. Teldo is the player the popularized this build.

* [Static Discharge](http://intothemists.com/calc/?build=-V70;2sPFn0l6gSFx0;9;5T-9T;158A;10;0157I;5sV2DsV2D5Bq): This build isn't very popular but with the recent buff of Rocket Boots. I've seen more Engis run this by swapping out Rifle Turret for Rocket Boots. The mobility from rifle and Rocket Boots is pretty amazing. 

**Ranger**

* [BM Ranger](http://intothemists.com/calc/?build=-FF37k;0wE-u-d2kDV-0;9-0a;3T9T;436A2;054BVV-7E;1nBnBnBnB9FS): This build received some much needed nerfs but is still powerful. The most common role of this build is holding the off points. It is strong 1v1 and still tanky enough to hold out for back up to show up. Pets are either felines or birds.  [Cleric Variation](http://intothemists.com/calc/?build=-FF3g;1wE-u-d2kDV-0;9V83;3T9T;436A2;054BWVF7;2nBnBnBnB3NJ)

* [Spirit Ranger](http://intothemists.com/calc/?build=-F7kF3;0wEFx-n2wDk-0;9k2a;29TT;25;036A36A;1KwF4F;1hoHAhJG42Vh): Not very popular but Spirits are noticeably much more powerful in tPvP than they are in PvE. This build is surprisingly strong in 1v1 but is also a tremendous asset in team fights. 

* [Trap Ranger](http://intothemists.com/calc/?build=-FFkV;1wEFy-v2oEF-0;9k2D;2TT9;247A28A2;3Ewl6;2jwmAjwmA2VH): Has fallen out of the meta but is still considered strong. The main reason people stop playing it was BM ranger did it's job at holding off points better. But this brings large amounts of AoE during team fights and is pretty good at holding the home point. 

* [Shout Heal](http://intothemists.com/calc/?build=-F7kF3;1FFt-p2kDk-0;9-0a;3TT9;436A27B2;0WVF7;2nBnBnBnB9cn). Thank you [/u/nightsfrost](http://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/1hrm83/tpvp_build_list_up_to_date_builds_as_of_the_june/cax7rap) This is a newer build that boasts larger amounts of sustain than standard BM ranger but at a slight cost of pet damage. 

**Thief**

* [D/P Burst](http://intothemists.com/calc/?build=-c3RV;1RwV0-6-FOFd0;9;4OT;0E28-07A;43;05BW4;2G3G3G3G35Bn): This is the standard 100-0 burst build. If you are new to the class I recommend OH Dagger instead of OH pistol. It is a very strong build and easily punishable if you are a poor player but still sees much high level play. 

* [S/D S/D Evade](http://intothemists.com/calc/?build=-cF3F3;0Vwk0-J5JOFd0;9;49T-T-2;027A;128B;1UNk65;1KJG4KJG45Bv): This build has seen some nerfs but is still very strong. It is a very difficult build for an opponent to lock down but doesn't have the insane burst of other thief builds. This build is also know as the Jumper build by the player that popularized it. 

* [Dantesway](http://intothemists.com/calc/?build=-c3RF3;0RwVb06-FOkd0;9;4OTE;020-05A4;65BW0L;1G3G3G3G35BK): I needed another thief build so I added mine. This build is very high burst and uses MH sword for great effect in team fights. But this build is also very hard on initiative. If you fluff a Black Powder/Heartseeker combo or spam 3 on this build, it will greatly punish you for it. But it is strong in 1v1 and great at bursting down bunkers and glass cannons. 

* [D/P Burst Variation](http://intothemists.com/calc/?build=-c3RV;1RwV0-6-FOFd0;9;49T;0T2;007A;436B5BW4;2G3G3G3G35Bb) Some players prefer traiting heavier into trickery due to the powerful traits in that line. But this has lower the potential damage. 

The skill [Shadow Trap](http://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Shadow_Trap) is kinda amazing now. It is basically a personal portal and can be used as such. Though it is kinda buggy if you want it is possible implementing it in the above builds. 

**Guardian**

* [Mid Bunker](http://www.intothemists.com/calc/?build=-73xs;1NFk40J3kF-90;9;69TT;44;048A2895wl6;2ZF18ZF183NV): This is the standard mid point bunker. The weapon choice is actually up to the guardian, I've seen players effectively use this with hammer/greatsword or mace/focus. Personally I run this build with scepter/shield staff. [Shielded Mind](http://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Shielded_Mind) often replaces Indomitable Courage in organized groups. 

* [DPS Triple mediatation](http://intothemists.com/calc/?build=-7Fwg;1NFF30I3wF-90;9;5TT44;139A09B;45NW0;2G3G3G30D5kU): The standard variation of this build is X/30/30/X/X so you are given 10 points to place where you want them. You can also replace the greatsword with scepter/X if you prefer that. 

* [DPS Symbol AH](http://intothemists.com/calc/?build=-7Bdg;1NFk20M3BG-90;9;59TT;23;049A269;1LJV4;2sV2DsV2D5kl): AH builds are fundamentally weaker in tPvP than they are in WvW or PvE. They require other players to be around in order to be incredibly effective. Since outside of large team fights you tend to only have one other ally instead of 4 the survivability is much lower. But it does benefit DPS builds since their survivability is already low. Though this build is still not very popular due to Bunker Guard being such an incredible asset to a team it can still be powerful. Variations include staff and hammer

**Warrior**

* [Destruction of the Empowered Burst](http://intothemists.com/calc/?build=-sg-7w;0VKFM0h4cL-60;9;4TJ;0J18A49;557-I-V0L;1KJG4KJG45BI): There are several variations to Warrior burst. I am merely one version of hard burst warrior. Destruction of the Empowered is very strong at punishing enemies. Burst Warriors and Burst Thieves should rarely be the first ones to enter a fight. They should roam around see a fight and back up their allies. This is where DotE shines, since many players will have their buffs at full midway into a fight. Variations include Divinity runes or Scholar also slightly different trait set ups that go for leg specialist. 

* [Zerker Longbow Sword/Shield](http://intothemists.com/calc/?build=-sFwo;1RK-Q0d4NL-60;9;5TJ-J;127A08;257-LRV4;2CoF2CoF25ke): This build is growing to be very popular. It is a rather different build than most players are used to. But it is very powerful build with burst and mobility from sword and AoE pressure from longbow. I had a pug match the other day where 3 warriors on the enemy team where running this build.  [The Defektive build](https://forum-en.guildwars2.com/forum/professions/warrior/Defektive-s-New-Meta-New-Patch-New-Build). 

* [Mace/Shield Greatsword Burst](http://www.intothemists.com/calc/index.php?build=-sg-BxFCRK-Q0f4cL-60L4kLVN0h4kG;5JJ-T;139-28;247AL-V4C;1CoF2CoF25kC) Cleansing Ire is proving to be a powerful trait that is bringing other weapons into viability. The premise of this build is using Skull Crack to stun the opponent for 3s (+Sigil of Paralyzation) allowing you plenty of time to hundred blades.  

Utility skills/Traits/Sigils/Runes and sometimes weapons can often be modified in the above builds. Say I recommended Runes of Divinity but if you prefer Runes of the Ogre. You can swap out for Runes of the Ogre and it will be just as strong if not stronger. Most players will make their own modifications to a build depending on the team comps or playstlye preferences. 

Disclaimer: I'm no pro player but I have played hundreds of tournament matches. I'm a Champion Shadow and am working on Champion Paragon. My personal best was the Top 300 and I used to lead a team where one of my members was in the Top 100. So I kinda know what I'm talking about but I always continue to learn and play better. So if I made a blatant mistake in one of the above builds, I apologize. If something is missing a sigil or missing a utility skill please comment. I checked them over to see if anything was missing or missplaced and I think I'm okay. 

-Dantes

If you see me in matches I""m probably on my Thief Dantesa Night or my Guardian Cadea Tayls.

1356630849.0,344,self.Guildwars2,15izyb,8 Great tips for New Players,417,73,257,http://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/15izyb/8_great_tips_for_new_players/,"As I was leveling up a low level alt the other day I noticed that a *LOT* of people must have gotten this game for Christmas - I haven't seen so many people in Kessex Hills since launch!
Anyway, in honor of our new batch of up-and-coming heroes I'd like to present 8 lessons I wish I had learned before I hit 80.

* **Vitality and Power** are your two most important stats early on, in that order. If you're buying gear go for the Vital prefix until you're level 21, then I'd recommend Vigorous. Precision requires a higher amount to get the same crit chance as you gain levels so you outgrow Precision gear quickly, and your armor is high enough early on that Toughness isn't as important as Vitality.

* **Upgrade your armor frequently.** It makes a tremendous difference for all your stats, not just your survivability. I'd recommend never letting your equipment get more than 10 to 15 levels out of date. You find good weapons much more frequently through drops, so don't worry so much about those compared to your armor.

On a related note, Crafting produces Masterwork (Green) equipment at levels 20, 35, 50, 65 and 80, so those are good times to change your wardrobe.

* **If you're going to craft, craft Armor.** It's much harder to come by good armor than good weapons. You should be able to collect *about* the right amount of materials to level up a single crafting profession if you play through normally on one character, but don't be surprised if crafting still drains your gold reserve.

* **Defensive Utility Skills** should be a priority over offensive ones while you're still learning the game. Sure that huge firestorm is fun, but when you accidentally aggro a pack of raptors having an ""Oh Crap!"" button to use to escape is the smarter option. Movement based skills that give you swiftness or slow/stop enemies are great for this.

* **Don't neglect lower level content.** Turning your nose up at an area 5 levels bellow you and trying to complete hearts 2-4 levels higher than your character can make for some pretty difficult and frustrating leveling. You won't lose out on much experience if you're a few levels above your area and it will be a ton easier. In particular, comb lower level areas for Skill Points!

In particular I found that from level 30 to 50 it's hard to keep up with the flow of PvE zones, so skip back to Harathi Hinterlands or Fields of Ruin and clean them out to make up for that.

* **Don't feel you have to stay in your race's zone!** Content will often level up faster than you do, so if you need a few more levels, take the Asura gate in your home town and visit another race's starting areas. 

* **Racial skills are crappy**, especially the Elites. Get your profession's normal skills first, then go back and get your racial ones last. Notable exception to this are Pain Inverter, Radiation Field, Warband Support and Hounds of Balthazar, but still skip them if you're unsure.

* **Salvage Whites, Vendor the rest.** For junk equipment you collect, that's how you get the most bang for your buck - the materials you get for salvaging outweigh the coins you'd get for selling common (White) equipment, but the opposite is true for Blue or above.

In my last game I managed to cap a point and hold it the entire match. I thought I'd get something for managing to do that but nope in the end i got 2 glory for simply being in the match and due to me getting 0 kills (they never attacked full scale only 1-2 and ran when they got low). I understand that it's probably there to stop feeders just standing about but give something to defenders/supporters even if they don't get kills.

I play as a defense-support Guardian traited and skilled to last long while still still being able to heal and buff yet I get nothing in the long run while the full on dmg people fighting inbetween points are getting ""top player x"" rewards.

1361406841.0,340,self.Guildwars2,18x6h0,Chat Codes; Ideal for RP-ers!,416,76,78,http://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/18x6h0/chat_codes_ideal_for_rpers/,"**EDIT 3:** I've updated this first post as of 2/21/2013.

Figured out quite a few chat codes that I felt some people would love to use. These chat codes differ from item codes because they are actual things the NPCs will say. The chat codes are colored based on which chat they are entered into(general chat will be green, map chat will be red, guild chat will be gold, ect.)

In case you are not familiar with chat/item codes, you basically would type [&amp;AzMeAAA=](or any of the other codes) into the chat box in-game and simply press enter to make your character say it(in this case, your character will say ""Now you've made me angry!"")

The way these work(from as far as I've been able to figure out) is they have to have these in the chat code [&amp;Az**--**AAA=] and the **--** are replaced with a capital and lower case combo like ""**Ab**"" for example. Most of them will look like this[&amp;Az**Ab**AAA=]. The ""Az"" part of the code starts at ""Aw"" and works up to ""Az""(Credit to turinpt for pointing that out, thanks).

Below is the list I have, I don't have too many(I've calculated there are well over 5,000 codes to figure out that are just text characters say so its not a small project).

Note: Excuse the table if it comes out messy, had to convert it to reddit format.

Hoping to make a bigger list of these which is why I'm sharing it with the reddit GW2 community.

This was the livestream if you missed it and want to watch it/re-watch it. http://www.twitch.tv/guildwars2/b/357921586

**Part 1**

**TL:DR**

* Incoming AoE ability balancing (nerf) - they are too effective right now
* Removing rez rushing in dungeons - i.e. can't WP if group members are in combat. Reducing difficulty on some of the more challenging encounters

* New achievement system to encourage players to go back to the deserted zones &amp; guilds stuff

* sPvP: custom areans. leaderboards, 1 team vs 1 team winner stay in loser kicked out tournament (paid)

* WvW - working on introducing progression, better rewards and fixing culling

* Class balance to bring up the weaker weapons/traits, more viable builds, and reduce AoE effectiveness. 

**What is our long term focus for PVE and how we are bringing left back to deserted zones**

* New achievement system that plays into dailies/monthlies that adds new style of gameplay
* New achievements to encourager cooperative play – i.e. rezzing, rallying) – things that will help players better at understanding the concepts of our game. 
* Allow players to filter back into some of the deserted zones (i.e. this month’s monthly  achievement for jumping puzzles was used as an example)
* New content with the guilds – 4-5 different styles of content that show up in the world that guilds can go in to help kick off and pull other players into it as well. 
* Adding tiers to guild economy/ear guild tabs, adding in new rewards for guild members to show off. 
* &gt;100 new rewards tied to the achievement system/guilds to allow players to show off some of the cool stuff they have done. 
* Framework rolling out next couple months
* New Ascended items coming into play outside FOTM with the new achievement/reward system. 

**Philosophy on the dungeons**

* Multiple phase change for the dungeons – first build – remove the idea of rez rushing (i.e. only way to beat some of the difficult encounters at the moment is to have dead players run back from nearby waypoints while players that are alive kite the mobs)
* You can no longer able to rez (I think he meant waypoint here)  if someone in dungeon is in combat
* We are nerfing some of the encounters that are a bit more challenging
* Phase 2 – go back and look at some of the encounters – retune and increase difficulty if necessary. 
* New rewards (no details)

**LFG mechanics**

* We are working right now on a system that go across the board, not just for dungeons, sPvP. It is a bit far off. 

**sPvP**

* Working on custom arenas – need to make sure it is bug free, we are polishing them atm
* Working on leaderboards – see your progress against other people
* New player experience for PvP – better matchmaking system – play with players of your skill level. 
* Working on a new 1 team vs 1 team version of our tournament system , will be paid tournament (but reduced the cost and reduced rewards). Winners stay in, losers kicked out to the lobby.  (Current tournament system require 8 teams for a single tournament with 3 rounds so it is hard to get tournaments started at the moment) 
* This new tournament version will be on Temple of Silent Storm map (this map has a lot of tournament potential).  
* Blog post coming up to talk more 
* Adding more PvP specific armor skins – i..e skins that are available in PvE but not in PvP. 

**WvW**

* Looking into progression in WvW to give you some kind of character development and rewards 
* Goal is to progression/rewards. Encourages more players to do WvW.
* Recently tested culling – we are doing great things with culling – running a lot of different tests/tweaks.
* Our WvW programmer talks about more on the official GW2 forums. 
* Adding more PvP specific armor skins – i..e skins that are available in PvE but not in PvP. 

**Upcoming AoE skill balancing (nerf)**

* One of the issues brought up a lot in WvW./sPvP is AoE (Area of Effect). We feel like they are too strong at the moment and a lot of people in WvW are gaming the system using AoEs. 
* For people that don’t know – max targets for siege weapons is 50 while max targets for AoE is 5. 
* Reducing AoE effectiveness to bring them in line with the single target damage skills. 
* Major update coming to all the AoE skills – make classes that are good at single target damage stand out a bit more.
* Same thing with dungeons – right now if you have a lot of AoE you can past encounters by just spamming AoE which is not what we want. 

**Philosophy inside weapons and class balance**

* We want every single class to feel like they have multiple options to deal with every situations, this doesn’t mean every class will have the exact same options.
* We want every single class to deal situations in an unique manner – we keep “purity” in certain skills/traits  i.e. only mesmers and thieves have stealth to deal with some situations. Not everyone have stealth but every class have a defensive mechanism they can use if they don’t stealth. 
* We want to bring up all the weak weapons/traits on par with strong weapons/builds/traits in addition to reduce AoE effectiveness.
* A lot of  classes have 1-2 good builds while some  have 5-6 builds , we want to bring up all the classes to 5-6 good and viable builds.


**Part 2 - Q&amp;A** (Part 2 is in super rough draft format, some things might be inaccurate, makes no sense, editing it when i get to rewatch)


**Q: How close do you feel each class fulfill the class philosophy**

* We use one set of balance numbers for wvw, pve, and spvp. We do this because people get acclimated to characters – we want people to play a class in a certain situation and feel comfortable in another
* Some classes are filling their roles, some are not
* We are brining up the weaker builds to be on par with the good builds. 
* So yes they are but there are more work to be done.

**Q: Expain what you mean by progress in WvW**

* We are encourage people to defend, to get involved, to break away from large mass mentality of zerging
* Reward the individual player for what they are doing rather than contribute scoring via server

**Q: Culling fixes available in WvW, sPvP, or PvE, when?**

* Depends on testing – WvW atm is bad, PvP is not an issue, PvE affected for large scale events (i.e. Lost Shores, Shatter event)
* We are testing the system in WvW and hopefully it will affect all across the board.

**Q: Fractals**

* Adding reconnect to fractals, and coming up a solution for the level restrictions – those are coming up in the next build.
* Able to start at the highest fractal level achieved by any group member – it will advance everyone who is eligible for advancement up one tier 
* You will be rewarded based on your personal level, not the level of the fractal you are in (i.e. if you are not 10+, you can’t get ascended rings by doing higher fractals etc)

**Q: Dynamic system in open worlds – how will it evolve – make it more understandable, more rewards**

* Changes to Orr at end of month – adding some new effects, environment zones, rewards
* Continue building lore/story – between content patches we will add in new events, new guild stuff. 

**Q: Stance on allowing people to see enemy nameplates in WvW**

* Mixed feeling – we want server to viewed as a whole and not introduce bitterness to individual players
* Not completely opposed to the idea – be interesting to get bragging rights, more competitive nature
* Not sure how to design around that at the moment
* Need to make it voluntary, prevent harassment issues
* WvW is about large scale massive battle mentality where individual players are not as important

**Q: Advancement/prestige  design for wvw**

* We want to keep things consistent – similar to some other stuff in the game. Can;’t talk much

**Q: How does dev priorize development time – new content or old content bug fixes?**

* We want to to do bug fixes first then add in new content.
* We looked at dungeons across the board, fractal bosses are more interesting – environment affect them etc. * We want to do the same to the original dungeon bosses.
* Specific teams to focus on different areas of the game to make sure no area is left behind.

**Q: Do you think classes will have more weapon combinations sometime in the future? (i.e. Eles using greatswords)**

* Great question, you might be able to see it in the future – can’t comment more

**Q: Examples to make boss more interesting**

* Different mechanics when bosses get to a different health stage etc like some of the fractal bosses.
* We now have more better tools to develop boss scripts. 

**Q: WvW and ascended gear?**

* It is an idea being tossed around – use the badge system perhaps.
* I am hopeful that it will.

**Q: Custom areans – new game modes? cost to host?**

* Yes, cost money to host, you rent server from us. 
* You can’t create an entirely new gamemode but you can turn some features on/off.
* I know you guys want new gamemodes like CTF

**Q: GvG – Guild vs Guild**

* Guilds battle in guild halls – you had a flag, a guild lord etc in GW1.
* We see it more as the team 5vs 5 stuff in GW2 and in custom arenas

**Q: New game modes?**

* We want to use conquest as the base and develop around it, we are talking about deathmath, CTF and see if they can fit out game.
* We can maybe we can implement some elements from other gamemodes. 
* Why do we keep to conquest? If you want something to grow, to do Esport, you want something that people can pick up.
* New mode – pushing the boundaries of what conquest can do arriving sometime before the death of the universe. 

**Q will GW2 become a ESPORT?**

* Yes, we are working on things that GW2 needs to be an esport – i..e custom arenas, Spector mode, better streaming support
* Releases later in the year. 

**Q: Do you agreee with the statement the current metagame is boring**

* Current metagame is boring, could use some expansion
* Bunker – a class is a class that hold down a position, has a lot of healing and self-suvability (i.e. a tank). We don’t want the bunker to go away completely. Bunkers give you an anchor in the map.
* We don’t  want to be case that every team needs a bunker. 
* Bring builds to all classes to what the bunkers are currently. 
* Eles are tough, guardians are tough, mesmers are hard to take care of, so are thieves. 

**Q: Do you find any profession to be out of balance? Like Ele bunker, roamer, thief one shot combo, mesmer portal?**

* Ele bunker is really strong, on our watchlist
* Mesmer portal is giving us problems –giving that tool onto other classes

**Q: Reward screen for the new crowns for the achievements**

* If you are playing a specific class, you have a reward that can be tailoring to your class
* A chest containing stuff that your class that you can use.
* Not class specific armor etc. 

**Q: Get crowns for achievement we already have?**

* First build only have crowns for daily and monthly achievements. 
* Later phase will have crowns are other achievement.
* New daily and monthly achievements tied to new content – allow to pick specific rewards you care about. 
* Feb’s monthly will reward crowns 
* Crowns are a new type of currency

**Q: Elaborate your plans for changing AoEs**

* This is not a quick fix, we are getting a lot of data.
* If your skil does 10 damage to a single target, if you have another skill that have the same opportunity cost but deals 8 damage to 5 targets, the AoE skill is better – we don’t want you to use AoE skills on single  target mobs. 
* Maybe add a new mechanic where mobs are resistant to AoE damage.
* In PvP and WvW we see people using AOEs on enemy players rezzing other etc",,False,self,t5_2r9po,1358463936.0,,Mesmer,True,t3_16rsh9,http://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/16rsh9/jan_17_dev_livestream_summary/,

I can't stand him. I hear its even worse for Night Order of Whispers Silvari, that he dominates the story straight from the very first quest.

Using the new mumble interface, the map will follow you around when you change zones or servers.  There's no web interface, this pulls data directly from the guild wars API and displays it on your screen.

To run, start up GW and then run the exe.

The download is [**here**](http://sourceforge.net/projects/gw2eventsmap/files/MapDisplay.rar/download)


The source here all here 

https://sourceforge.net/projects/gw2eventsmap/files/?source=navbar

Note that you will need pygame to run this from the source.  This was made in python 2.7, on Windows 7.  I haven't tested it with any other systems.

**RE: Safety**

I made this with only the guild wars API in order to be as legit as possible.  There's no hooking functions or interacting with the game itself in any way.  As such, I would be extremely surprised if anyone got in trouble for using this.  As always, use at your own risk.


**Details**

Left click on an event to see the event name.

Right click to minimize and restore the map.  This is useful if you only have 1 screen.  You can keep the small version in a corner and click to pull it up.

There are a few options in the config file that you may want to look at.  Those with older computers can lower the zoom level or turn on slowload to improve performance.

This is fully functional, but not totally polished.  I do plan on working on this more in the future, and I'd love to hear what features you all would be interested in.  

Edit: Updated, you can now click on event circles to see the event name and level.  Also loads twice is fast (subject to bandwidth limitations)

Edit 2: This now supports single screens if you run it in windows full screen.  Right click to shrink/restore the map window.  config file added so you can change the zoom level. Zoom 5 or 6 is much faster but less detailed.

Edit 3: The config file can let you see events in preparation by setting Prep=1.

Edit 4: You can now filter out skill challenge and group events.  Group events are now purple and skill challenges are green.

Download the file again if you are interested in the updated features.",[Other],False,self,t5_2r9po,1372028870.0,oth,,True,t3_1gx28f,http://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/1gx28f/a_gw2_map_that_displays_all_of_the_active_events/,

In the coming hours, we will be restoring account access to those who were suspended for exploiting the bugged vendor prices for the Norn Cultural weapons. Not everyone will have access restored right away. In some cases we are awaiting more information from the player, and some appeals are still coming in. We will address each appeal as quickly as we can. 

We’d like to remind everyone that we do not seek to punish, and any time a drastic measure like this is taken, it is taken to maintain the health and integrity of the game. As we reinstate these accounts, we expect everyone who appealed to honor their commitment to destroy all illegitimate gains, whether those are crafting items, currencies, or the weapons themselves. To remove currencies, making a purchase of appropriate value and destroying that purchase will suffice. 

We would also like to acknowledge that we are not free from blame. In a game this big, problems inevitably occur that are difficult to locate , and moving forward we will continue to address these issues in a timely, communicative and efficient manner. What constitutes an exploit, and what has resulted in these suspensions, is using a flaw in the game to gain an unfair advantage over other players that is clearly not in line with the design of the game. Please remember, opportunity does not equal permission.

We also understand that sometimes the consequences of such an exploit may not be clear or apparent. In these cases, try to think about how the actions of one player can affect the millions of other players, or the in-game economy as a whole. In your appeals, many of you stated that you only purchased large quantities of weapons to use for personal gain and not for profit. Such an act devalues the time and effort put forth by every other player who opts not to take advantage of an exploit. We will be publishing a FAQ on exploits soon.

On the subject of your appeals, most of you expressed understanding for the decisions that we made. For that, we are deeply appreciative. Going forward, we will strive to maintain only the highest of standards for the game and the community, and we ask that you do the same.

As one player noted in his appeal, we have the opportunity to work together to forge a legendary MMO experience and that is not something we take for granted. If you encounter any other bugs or anything suspicious in game, please feel free to report it by typing ""/bug"" in-game, or by sending an e-mail to exploits@arena.net.

All of that said, on behalf of ArenaNet and NCsoft, we’d like to extend a sincere welcome back to Tyria. Let's all have some fun.

1357507314.0,335,self.Guildwars2,162v35,How average users can save the Guild Wars 2 economy. ,503,168,368,http://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/162v35/how_average_users_can_save_the_guild_wars_2/,"First off let me give you a little bit of background, I have been a player of Guild Wars 2 from launch. I've been trading almost nonstop in the game for the last four month, and had stockpiled an amount of gold that was pretty unreasonable, I was starting to feel like smaug. My pursuit of more gold had become somewhat of an obsession, and finding ways to extract 100's and sometimes 1000's of gold out of the markets and away from other players became exciting and fun. I had no plans or goals in mind for the money besides increasing my own power to manipulate markets.

I am making this post because I have been removed from the game due to my snowflake exploiting, I am beyond guilty and made 200-600% (multiple thousands of gold) in returns with the exploit because I used it as soon as the patch dropped, and through the next two days. I do feel a little bad for the players who did it towards the end before it was removed as they probably only made a few dozen gold and still got the same ban as players like me, regardless I accept my ban from the game and in retrospect I realize most of my actions in game have actually been hurting the in game economy, and all of you. It's probably a good thing that I am no longer allowed into the marketplace. 

As one of the players who saw ways to manipulate and profit from market I can say the number one problem to the guild wars economy is not exploiters (although they are clearly a problem), it's the market confusion from normal players. When markets are out of balance (goods from one market can be converted to another market at a profit) That means players can cycle wealth and create gold out of the trading post at an unlimited level. This is what has happened to Guild Wars 2, markets have been out of balance for four months. Those who see it will create hundreds of gold, those who are not looking will become poorer over time, and eventually unable to compete in the unfair trading waters of the plutocracy. 

The markets are already mostly run by wealthy players, and I think it's pretty obvious to most people by now. The only way to stop this trend from becoming worse and worse is to identify these markets and have the community actively work on balancing them. This is done by players seeing the profit and deciding to also engage in a market converting activity. As an EvE online trading veteran it is surprising to see that the Guild Wars 2 community has failed to fix these unbalanced markets since the game has launched. I suspect that the main reason is due to the trading post tax being so high, it makes markets very confusing and the question of profitability always has to come into play, even when making steady normal profit. The other would be information suppression by those players currently making hundreds of gold off of these unbalanced markets.

It seems the prevailing notion in this community is there is nothing you can do to the wealthy players, and they already control the markets. This is not at all true, you have the ability to close off the free gold making machines they have been using since the game launched. I will now go into the problem markets that are making Guild Wars 2 into a less and less fair trading economy, and detail what the average user can do to fix it, and at the same time make a modest amount of gold for yourself. Once the markets are relatively balanced again I think the Guild Wars 2 economy will be in a much more stable and equal position.

#1 Tier 5 Materials -&gt; Globs of Ectoplasm 

This is the craft and salvage market, it has massive volume and is by far the number one money maker in the game. It has pretty safe returns in general and can yield very high profit margins. I would go as far to say that 30-50% of all the gold generated by traders comes from this market. The reason I say it is so high is because botters are supplying endless amounts of T5 materials, even ordering a thousand gold of materials does not really have a significant impact on the T5 market. Since the bots went underwater large scale orders I used were filled in the 10,000's in the matter of an hour.

You can currently pick up Tier 5 Materials at a cost of around 95 copper. For 15 of them and about 4-5 silver in silk, leather, and thread you can craft lvl 80 rare items. This should cost you about 19-20 silver to make. Now to salvage the item with a master salvage kit should yield about .9 ectos per item (I've done 10,000's of salvages and made thousands of gold from this market can confirm master kits return higher than the others and at a rate of .9 ecto per item. (9 ectos per 10 items salvaged on average)

This allows you to turn 20 silver into .9 ectos, or if you set it to the price to obtain 1 ecto it becomes 22 silver to obtain an ectoplam. If you need ectos for yourself it is an amazing way to save 35% of the market price, if you are looking to sell them you can make about a 20% return on any money you put after tax is taken out. The returns are immediate and can be cycled. Ideally enough people will start doing this to eventually balance the markets and fix the massive wealth disparity. This will cripple gold sellers easy way to print 100's of gold a day, and stop the guild wars 2 economy wealth gap from continuing to split. 

Major -&gt; Superior 

Similar returns are possible on material upgrading. Specifically major runes to superior runes, and major sigils to superior sigils in the mystic forge. This market involves a lot more luck, but its like a slot machine that returns 130% back over the long run. Sure you lose a lot of the time, but if you put 100 gold in you can expect 130 gold out. There is still risk of not hitting any good runes in smaller sample sizes and losing money. Maintaining these markets requires knowing the average cost of the superior rune markets, and that takes a lot more time to watch and maintain. If there is enough community demand I can go into the numbers of this market to show the profit margins.

There are also quite a few other smaller markets that I could share if there is enough interest in this. I just don't want to spend any more time on this if there is not.

I am not sharing this information so a few reddit members can make gold trading as well, although some probably will because its a side effect of balancing the markets. It's my aim to instead shut down the infinite gold supply that 1-2% of the community is taking advantage of at the expense of the other 99-98%. It's up to you guys how you want to react to this information, but I figured since I am now banned from the game, and I doubt anyone making hundreds of gold from it would give out this information and destroy their own money making machine I might as well make this information public, and leave the fate of the Guild Wars 2 economy up to the larger community.

1361250470.0,325,self.Guildwars2,18suws,A simple explanation of why the bleed cap needs to be removed.,416,91,449,http://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/18suws/a_simple_explanation_of_why_the_bleed_cap_needs/,"Lets assume we are hitting a mob with 20% damage reduction as both a Warrior to represent direct damage and then a Necromancer to represent condition damage:

(damage stats will be extreme so as to help illustrate my point. Necromancers are not capable of maintaining 25 bleeds individually for example)

* Warrior capable of hitting for 4,000 direct dps. Warrior hits mob for 3,200 damage per second.

* Necromancer capable of maintaining 25 stacks of 150 damage bleeds. Necromancer hits mob for 3,750 damage per second.

Now lets see what happens when we add additional players:

* 10 Warriors capable of hitting for 4,000 direct dps. Warriors hit mob for 32,000 damage per second total.

* 10 Necromancers capable of maintaining 25 stacks of 150 damage bleeds. Necromancers hit mob for 3,750 damage per second total.

Notice the issue? That is what everyone frustrated by condition caps are complaining about.

Finally, lets see what happens in a situation with an even mix of the two, with the addition of extra damage sources from both classes:

* 5 Warriors capable of an additional 2 bleeds at 50 damage each, plus 5 necromancers capable of an additional 300 direct damage per second each. Warriors hit for 32,500 damage total, Necromancers hit for 3,450 as bleeds are replaced by weaker short duration Warrior versions only allowing the Necromancers 15 stacks at a time, actually reducing their damage despite the addition of the direct damage from attacks.

This is exactly what happens in every group fight in the game. Condition damage classes are forced into the ground and denied relevance. This is why you should never include more than one condition dealer per group as long at the ridiculous bleed caps stand. 



EDITS:

* It is not a logical counter argument to suggest that high condition stacks caused by multiple players would kill too fast. It is currently possible for multiple players to kill FASTER with direct damage alone, which is not an issue. EG:

   * DD source = X time to kill
   * 10 x DD source = X/10 
   * CD source = X 
   * 10 x CD source = X 
   * Therefore, implicating that allowing ""10 x CD = X/10"" is OP holds no water, as clearly ""10 x DD"" already achieves this outcome and is not a point of contention.

* It appears that many are not familiar with how condition removal works. Any number of stacks of one type of condition count as one condition being removed. That means a skill that removes 1 condition will remove all 25 stacks of bleed if it removes the bleed condition.

* It is being said that removing the cap would imbalance PvE as bosses don't have condition removal. This is untrue for two reasons: 1. Many actually do have condition removal and 2. It's totally irrelevant to begin with, allowing players to do damage to a boss does not unbalance an encounter...

* It is not possible for any single player to maintain a stack of 25 bleeds, in fact, it is near impossible to maintain a stack to 20 bleeds without 100% condition duration. For perspective, a max stat, full Rabid Necro running food, weapon and might buffs will waver between 2,000-3,000 max dps as bleeds are applied and fade. Raising the cap will not boost individual players damage to insane levels, in fact it will have no affect on solo players. Condition damage specs will never do as much dps as a direct damage burst spec, the balance is already there without the cap.

* Yes, Epidemic would require a change, the details of which would be up to A-Net. My suggestion from elsewhere is this thread: Perhaps epidemic only allows spreading to a cap of 25 bleeds otherwise no bleeds are transferred.

   * target has 20 bleeds. surrounding enemies have 6. epidemic spreads 19 bleeds to a cap of 25.
   * target has 5 bleeds. surrounding enemies have 60 bleeds. epidemic spreads 0 bleeds as the cap has been surpassed.

* This is not a profession specific issue, I understand and apologize that I have diluted the discussion by using Warrior and Necromancer as examples, this was not my intention. I did not anticipate the intensity with which some approach even a hint of contention over class specific balance. 

* It is important when reading this post to comprehend that the issue applies just as much to PvP as PvE. Many are forgetting cripples/immobilize/blinds/launches/knockdowns/dodges and blocks do affect ability to apply and maintain conditions on a target, whilst also ignoring the possibility of a melee condition spec/ranged dd spec, condition removal and the increased benefit of healing and regeneration vs conditions.

Congrats guys hope your friends and brother enjoy their copies! Sorry to all who missed out if i could spare any more money to buy a couple of extra copies i would have.

So I'm feeling generous, I've got some extra shifts at work and can afford to do something nice so I'm going to buy 3 people a digital copy of guild wars 2. Now to decide who gets these copies I'm going to let the community decide the 3 highest people upvoted get these copies. The accounts must be at least 2 months old and have a minimum of 300 positive karma. So post away i'll leave this open for a while so give me a sob story on why you can't afford it, give me a name or an account of someone who you think deserves a copy of guild wars 2. And most importantly don't be a cunt. 

Edit - All the copies will be for the US region, sorry my EU chums. And no it doesn't have to be a sob story that was just used as an example. Don't feel obligated not to post because your karma is low i'm just trying to use it as a system to filter out the shitbags if you make it to the top 3 and you've only got 100 karma and been here for a month because you lurk thats fine. 

Edit 2 - Heading to bed for now ill go through as many comments as i can in the morning i'll leave this open close to 24 hours to give as many people a decent chance.

Coming from behind halfway through the week Henge of Denravi beat out Gates of Madness and Darkhaven after an incredibly close week of fighting, with the points between first and last rarely exceeding a 15,000 point difference.

As the week came closer and closer to an end the mood in world v world  hit an all time high. Some of the players present had been in the server since launch had had to endure week after week of bitter and frequently extreme defeat, so to finally have a victory, especially against an opponent that had beaten the server for the last three weeks in a row, has been a good experience.


Speaking personally, as one of the commanders in the server, it's been a really fun and tense match. I want to thank Darkhaven and Gates of Madness for such a great match. You guys have been amazing, honorable opponents. 


And to my own server, you guys are amazing. I love this server, the people here are great. It's been nice to see the transition over the last month as we've been getting more and more organised, and as our world v world crew has gotten more respect. We are one of the smallest population servers, if not the smallest, but we have achieved some great things with what we have. More importantly, the community is one of the friendliest I've met.


A lot of us here in HoD have been trying really hard to organise ourselves into a more competitive world v world server so it's great to see over a month of effort and organisation pay off with a victory. The times in the past have not been kind to us, so for many of us this signals an opportunity to finally begin having fair and balanced match.


Heres for more fun WvW, in victory or defeat.

Final Scores: 

Henge of Denravi: ~216,514

Darkhaven: ~202,223

Gates of Madness: ~200,194

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=thVuIZDdn80&amp;list=PL00553A085339802C&amp;index=7

I've been making videos about Guild Wars on youtube for a few years now and one of the most succesful series I ever did was retelling the story of Guild Wars 1 just before the sequel launched. We managed to complete prophecies back then, but after the game came out I (of course) found myself spending more time with the second game than anything else

However, shortly after christmas, I decided it was time to go back. I gathered a new group of artists and we have spent the next few months, up until now, producing the next part!

I understand that excitement for this has likely dropped since launch, but I'm here for two reasons really:

First, I think I owe it to the artists at least who helped me to share the video around a bit, *but also this whole thing with Cantha not appearing in Gw2.* It's kind of wierd to think that all this fantastic story and lore and ties to Gw2 may never make a comback for the second game, and I really want new players of the franchise to see what they could be missing.

I think for a lot of people Cantha was 'just that big annoying city' and they wouldnt flinch to hear that A.net doesn't plan to make it a part of Gw2 - and I really want to change that. The region has some of the most defined and interesting lore the series has to offer, particularly when it comes to Death, having an interesting antagonist, environments and links to the elder dragons. **It's the dragon empire for petes sake!**

So hopefully this video will convince people otherwise. I do a bit of a disclaimer type thing in the video itself and leave some links for those interested, so I'll leave it there.

Anyway guys, I hope you like this - I mostly lurk this subreddit on my normal reddit account and not post, so hopefully this doesn't grind anyones gears. :P

(And now, for you!)

---
###T6 Mat Farm Guide

Much like many players, I'm dirt poor. I developed these runs in conjunction with a freind of mine. We're both working on Legendaries (Frostfang for him, Moot for myself) and don't really want to pay for our Gifts of Might and Magic. To remedy this, we're farming up all our T6 Mats.

##This guide includes farms for:

+ Vicious Fangs
+ Ancient Bone
+ Vials of Powerful Blood
+ Elaborate Totems
+ Powerful Venom Sacs
+ Vicious Claws
+ Piles of Crystalline Dust

##Non T6 Mats included:

+ Corrupted Lodestone
+ Charged Lodestone
+ Onyx Lodestone

##Some things to note:

+ If the farming zone is full of bots, report them and try guesting on another server!
+ MF is highly recommended if you want some more rare drops. I personally use [Spicy Pumpkin Cookies](http://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Spicy_Pumpkin_Cookie). But any [MF Consumable](http://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Magic_find#Consumables) is good.
+ These are developed to be ""semi afkable"" so you don't really have to worry about dieing unless you really aren't paying attention.

---
###Vicious Fang/Vials of Powerful Blood Farm

[Link to map] (http://i.imgur.com/2VySIXQ.jpg)

Here you will be killing [Reef Skelk](http://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Reef_Skelk). Basically run from the Cove, north up the beach and back down, very simple.


##Recommended Skills:

+ Speed Buffs (Signet of the Hunt, Signet of Shadow, Rampage as One, for example)
+ AoE Damage Skills (Any Ele, dagger storm, whirling axe)

There is no Veterans on this run. Average in 45 minutes was about 5-10 of each Vicious Fangs and Vials of Powerful Blood.


---
###Powerful Venom Sac Farm

[Link to map](http://i.imgur.com/HRu07Y9.jpg)

Here you are killing [Reef Riders](http://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Reef_Rider) (and young Reef Riders). We basically run around in a circle, klling all the falls in our path.

##Recommended Skills:

+ Speed Buffs (Same as above)

There is 2 Veterans for this. Fights are straight forward. Watch for confusion and a reflection dome that they create. It will reflect all projectiles.

---
###Vicious Claw and Ancient Bone Farms
[Link to map](http://i.imgur.com/jRnVSvq.jpg)

Here you are killing the [Ice Brood Colossus](http://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Icebrood_Colossus) and [Corrupted Quaggan](http://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Corrupted_Quaggan).

##Recommended Skills:

+ Speed Buffs (Same as above)
+ The ability to dodge

##Other noted drops:

+ Corrupted Lodestone

There are no veterans along this path.

---
###Elaborate Totem/Ancient Bone Farm

[Link to map](http://i.imgur.com/8OQcOx1.jpg)

Here you are killing the [Grawl](http://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Grawl). 

##Recommended Skills:

+ Speed Buffs
+ AoE Damage
+ AoE Pulls (Binding Chains, for example)


There are no veterans along this path. Tagging the ""friendly rabbits"" can also be benefical. They can drop loot. (For instance, when first developing this run, I  tagged a rabbit, got an Unidentified Dye that turned into a Celestial. Good times)

---
###Piles of Crystalline Dust/Charged Lodestone + Other Lodestones

* [Link to map 1](http://i.imgur.com/cpwpvoL.jpg)
* [Link to map 2](http://i.imgur.com/TDnxXVD.jpg)

(First picture) Here you are primarily killing the [Sparks](http://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Spark) and [Air Elementals + Vets](http://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Air_Elemental). There is also [Ice Elementals](http://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Ice_Elemental) (Corrupted Lodestones) and [Embers](http://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Ember) (Onyx Lodestone or Molten?) within the ring. There are multiple Veterans. **You will need to open the Temple of Lyssa for this one.**

(Second Picture) Here you are killing ONLY Sparks and Air Elementals. There is four total veterans. An event will spawn where a champion risen knight will appear. **You will need to open the Temple of Dwayna for this one.**

Note! The drop rate on the Charged Lodestone is low (as compared to say, the Corrupted Lodestones). The drop rate on the Crystalline dust is kind-of low, but factoring in the amount of incandescent dust that drops, the value of charged lodestones and the value of the Crystalline dust, we figure it's still a decent farm. Shocking Crystals are dropped often, and add up quickly, which can be sold for a good chunk of silver after every 30-40 minutes.

##Recommended Skills:


+ Speed Buffs (Same as above)

---
###Other notes:

+ I have not yet found a good place to farm Armored Scales outside of the WvWvW Borderlands Central Lake (the Krait there)
+ Don't forget, you can promote [T5 materials to T6 ones!](http://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Mystic_Forge#Common_Crafting_Material_Promotion)
+ Bring a friend! Having someone else to chat with/run with makes things less dull!
+ Listen to music!

I thought this might help some people who are being a bit careful with their karma spending as karma sometimes can be a pain to farm if the zone doesn't have alot of events up. You can get a rough idea of when you can upgrade this slot and how much karma you need etc. 

GW2 has alot of leveling zone options and I am not going to be able to get them all in the first pass. However, once I reached 80 with my first character so I will go back and do the ones I missed along the way. So this list should be semi complete within the week or two. Also planning on converting the screenshots with item links to database sites like guildhead sometime in the future so you can view their stats.

This is a work in progress but I thought I might post what I have right now, enjoy!

Right now as you level to 80, the downscaling of experience and karma is pretty fair, as the devs generally want to have you keep moving forward to higher level zones.

However, the events in Orr are insanely zerged and crowded, and it's not all that challenging to just blindly kill stuff and farm karma.  They want us to play the game and not farm right?  People in Orr are essentially just farming karma and doing crazy Dynamic event chains over and over again.

At level 80, I have about 44% of the world complete.  There's a ton left for me to go do and see, and I want to go do it, however the karma and experience rewards are really, REALLY low and I don't feel that the invested time is worth it.

To alleviate this, I am proposing a flat amount of karma and XP for each event completed outside of the ""endgame"" zones (call it 75% of what you'd get from a typical event).  **This would only apply to level 80 characters**

The point of this idea is to incentivize level 80s to go explore and spend time in places other than just Orr, which would both alleviate the massive karma zergfest going on out there while also giving people the option to enjoy whatever content they wanted without feeling like they were sacrificing too much.

Right now, as more and more people hit the level cap, there are more and more level 80s heading into Orr, and eventually there will be a critical mass of those players farming and zerging down content.  With this tweak to the downleveling system, the population in Orr would not be so extreme, people could play the content they wanted without feeling like they're not being rewarded for it, and in general I think the entire game world will feel a lot more ""alive""

What do you guys think?

**TL;DR - Once you hit level 80, give all Dynamic events completed outside of the Orr zones a flat reward of karma and xp equaling 75% of what would have been attained in Orr**",,False,self,t5_2r9po,False,,,True,t3_104yhc,http://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/104yhc/would_you_like_lower_level_dynamic_events_to_give/,

First of all - this isn't me asking for a list of guilds in each server. This is me asking for a list of unofficial communities and famous entities that people know of that will be rolling on each, just so people who are having trouble picking a server can take a quick glance and get a sense of what online communities are rolling there. 

So far I know these:

EU:

- Underworld: Unofficial secondary Polish server

If you guys could help me build this list with other known entities and where they are going or where unofficial servers are... that would be great! For example, where is GW2Guru going, Dontain, etc. etc.

EDIT: I have no idea why so many people are downvoting this. I thought a more concise list would be helpful. *sigh*

All of these mini-games are extremely fun. Why not implement a server browser or a tournament queue. It's very obvious that you use the hotjoin function of sPvP for this (you even have your sPvP armor in these games), so I don't think it'd be too terribly hard.

I've already created the weapon galleries, so they can be viewed by visiting any weapon's page (i.e. http://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Staff) and scrolling to the bottom. You'll see a link to the gallery there. The way I have it set up is that it uses the wiki's built in Gallery to create a list of all weapons on the wiki of each type. 

What that means is if you were to go look for [Bandit Spire](http://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Bandit_Spire), for example, you will see an image in the gallery to the right. That image resolves to [here](http://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/File:Bandit_Spire.jpg). The important bit here is that this image is a jpg. My galleries are set to search the gallery links of all the weapons for the jpg of that weapon. 

So, if that image of the Bandit Spire was a .png it would not show up in my gallery. I am currently going through every weapon on the wiki and making sure the images (if there are any for the weapon) are located in the proper location and in the proper format). I just finished Staves, and it will take a bit of time to fix the rest, but I am working on it. I am also trying to format the pages a bit more consistently, based on format guidelines on the wiki.

Once that is done, my next task will be to find all weapons that do not have a screen shot and, together with a friend, I will be going through the game and getting screens of all of those weapons so that we can complete the gallery. If anyone uploads any images of weapons, I only ask that you do so in the gallery page for that weapon (if there is no image it will say [upload to gallery]) and make sure it is a jpg format.

This post is heavily modeled after theirs and the same materials were used to provide a control.

**Abstract (TL;DR):**

An analysis of a significant sample of salvagable materials has shown that salvaging mechanics are not affected in and of themselves by magic find in N≤500.

**Background &amp; Research:**

There have been studies on salvaging with different kits and if the anti-bot code has any impact on salvaging. However, these studies are done with 0% Magic Find in an attempt to reduce the number of variables. If Magic Find were to influence the drop rates of rarer materials, there would be significant motivation for players to stockpile salvage materials until such point that they could raise their magic find stat.

**Hypothesis:**

Increasing the magic find stat will lead to a greater quality or quantity of materials from salvage items.

**Materials &amp; Methods:**

In order to test this hypothesis a large number of salvageable items were needed. To fill this requirement Rags were chosen for four reasons. First, they can salvage in to two different materials – Silk &amp; Gossamer . Second, because of this Rags will be one of the more salvaged materials. If there are different thresholds for different items this will be one of the most relevant to the player base as it will be one of the most salvaged items and one that people will mostly need accurate numbers on. Third, a large number of Rags are relatively easy to acquire and because they are the same item will eliminate many potential sources of error, such as a varying loot table which would affect this study the most. Finally, because of the testing on diminishing returns, we have a control sample with an equal amount of samples.

Mystic Salvage Kits were used for the salvaging for two reasons. First, the control study used mystic salvage kits. Second, they were relatively cheap and easy to obtain.

Gear worn (assuming Magic Find stacks additively) produces a total of +108% Magic Find (6 x 3% from armor + 10% from Superior Rune of the Traveler + 50% from 5 Superior Runes of the Pirate + 15% from accessories + 15% from accessory upgrades).

500 Rags were used as the sample group to mimic the control study.

**Materials:**

*Mystic Salvage Kit – 2

*Rag – 500

For consistancy, this study was done while standing in the same place without moving.

The Rags and Mystic Salvage Kits were acquired at 8.00 EST 26/9 and salvaging took place after 10.00 EST 26/9.

The account and character has not looted nor salvaged in the last 24 hours in order to establish another baseline within reasonable limits.

Since diminishing returns/anti-bot code was already studied, the salvages were performed as quick as possible and only the final results tallied (i.e. no recording of per-item breakdown).

**Results:**

500 Rags yielded 732 (x=1.464) Silk Scraps and 72 (x=.144) Gossamer Scraps. Finally, one further observation, each salvage yields only silk or only gossamer and no amount of gossamer above 1 was observed.

**Discussion:**

Using the chi squared test, magic find gear did not have a statistically significant effect on salvage rates of Gossamer Scraps nor Silk Scraps. This reflects a community consensus that magic find will not affect salvaging.

Secondly, I have the Commander's Compendium on my character, so these claims are not biased by jealousy.  I've spent the last week leading my server through several siege based events, ending in quite possibly the best mass PvP experience I've ever had.  

There are a few problems I have with it.  First, the method of which you attain the ability to become a Commander.  Second, the problems that arise with multiple Commanders.  Third, the control scheme that doesn't exist with squads.  Last, some personal opinions of the concept I'll go over.

Currently the method of becoming a Commander is to gather 100g and buy a book.  There is no WvW involved, no approval system, nothing.  Get 100g, and you too can be trusted by the server to know how to take down a door without ever doing it.  This is BAD.  At the very least, it should require the equivalent of basic knowledge of how to play WvW, if that is the intention of the Commander ability.  I would suggest a 1,000 Badge of Honor requirement on top of the 100g, for starters, and possibly some way to verify that you have a guild backing (item through influence points, possibly rank 5 Art of War) you on your ascension.

With multiple commanders comes confusion.   I believe this is partially caused by the extremely poor squad system.  This creates substandard strategy in situations where multiple commanders are not needed.  

Squads are a mess.  There is no interface involved with squads.  You can't invite players, and you cant remove players.  The only way you know who is in your squad is by a '/squadinfo' command which is text based only.  /squad is rarely used, and I still can't see squad members on my map.  My suggestion is to have a squad tab added to the map menu, which allows you to drag and drop objectives with a number of players associated with them, as well as to be able to see who/what are where which would actually be useful. 

Below is just my opinion of what commander's compendium should be changed to.

War Standard

 - Icon on Map like you have now
 - Commander carries a Standard, and cannot use profession skills.
 - Grants buffs to himself and surrounding players equivalent to the Orb bonus, but does not stack with the orb bonus.
 - Is made in the mystic forge with an item equivalents of: 100 skill points, 1,000 badges of honor, 100,000 karma, and 100g. 
 - May only be activated once per day, and lasts a maximum of 6 hours.

To me, commander should just be a focus of the map, not a 'leader of the server'.  It should be a pleasure to fight next to a commander, but guild leadership should be the strategical center of GUILD wars, not some random guy with 100g.",,False,self,t5_2r9po,False,,,True,t3_10szpl,http://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/10szpl/they_need_to_change_commanders_theres_no_way/,

Also, it appears that the prices of Cayenne Pepper and Bowl of Blackberry Pie Filling are spiking and Bowl of Dilled Cream Sauce ~~has sold out~~ is through the roof. That will probably settle down in a day or two.

**Edit 2**: Prices have changed significantly due to this guide. I'm appending the prices *I* paid at the bottom so you can compare them to market prices at the moment to identify anything that may be out of whack before you spend your money.

**Edit 3: The prices of many of the items on this shopping list have increased dramatically and following this guide would cost you much, much more than 2g. I recommend not using it until the market settles down.**

-------------

I didn't start cooking before the infamous nerf and ever since then I've then been looking for an updated guide. There are a few out there but none of them had everything I was looking for so I made my own. 

Because there are so many paths to take when leveling cooking you need to prioritize. Here are the goals I set and met for my guide:

- No need to run to high-level karma vendors for any ingredients (like cherries, peaches)
- Avoid items that the market can put a stranglehold on (though there are a couple)
- Include a complete shopping list so you can buy everything at once, in advance
- Be able to go to the Trading Post, buy your materials, go the cooking station and go 0-400 with no additional running around
- Keep cost to a reasonable minimum

I understand that not everyone wants to powerlevel. Some people like figuring things out and getting all the recipes. This guide is not for those people. This is for someone who has money to burn and wants to quickly and easily add 10 levels to an alt. I also know that leveling via discovery *may* be more efficient in terms of money (I'm not sure), but it's more complex and takes more time and more bag space. I consciously chose to avoid a discovery-focused guide but would enjoy seeing someone else provide one.

This guide has been tested on four different characters. It makes sense given current market conditions but I recognize those may change over time, including if this guide gets significant attention. I did not use any crafting boosters.

The cost for me was under 2g, as low as 1.7-1.8 if I planned ahead and used buy orders. You can sell the things you create on the TP to recoup a few silver but don't expect much. Since most people will have a lot of these materials already the out-of-pocket cost will be even lower for them. You will also need to spend 110 karma at the cooking merchant.

Note that the cooking merchant sells most things in stacks of 10 so you will have to overbuy a few things.

I also want to say in advance in case anyone asks, I may do a similar guide for Artificing but for the other professions I don't currently see a way to improve on the guides on http://www.gw2wiz.com/.

It’s actually in and working, but the feature wasn’t publicly documented. Here’s how it currently works:
Under [Your Name]\Documents\Guild Wars Gw2Dev folder, you’ll see that GW2 creates a Music folder next to the Screens folder (where screenshots go). All you need to do to get your external music collection playing in the game is to create a playlist of the appropriate name and type in this folder.

Supported playlist formats are .wpl, .m3u, .pls, .asx, and .wax.
Supported audio types are everything FMOD supports by default, which includes .mp3, .ogg, .flac, .wav. aiff, and a bunch of old-school music formats, like .mid or .it files.

There are eight specific playlists the game recognizes, and these are designated simply by the playlist’s file name. They are: Ambient, Battle, Underwater, City, Crafting, BossBattle, NightTime, and MainMenu. Hopefully these are somewhat self-explanatory in terms of when you might expect to hear them play.

So, for example, if you create a playlist called Ambient.m3u, anything in that playlist will be heard instead of the standard in-game ambient music (the general music you hear when running around in the world).

Each internal playlist can designate a primary and secondary playlist to look for. Most of the playlists will fall back to Ambient if they do not exist. This means that if you’d like to simply replace the majority of the music in the game, you can just create an Ambient playlist, or maybe just Ambient and Battle. 

However, if you really want to customize your playlist in detail, you can create the more specialized playlists such as NightTime or Crafting.

The easiest (and at the moment, the only) way to test this is with a MainMenu playlist, since that will replace the music at the login screen.

If you disagree, please leave a comment and argue against the idea, but I think this is a discussion worth having.

I have noticed in my time on this subreddit that there is a mindset that, because GW2 does not have a subscription fee, the free content provided each month is a great favor that buys ANet a lot of credit with the player base, and allows most people to skip over some very large problems with the game and how the community - especially the forum community - is run.

The fundamental flaw with this view of GW2 is that ANet is not a charity nor are they your friend; ANet is a business, and while they are invested in this game, they will not take actions which lose them money. Why? Because they are a business. You are the customer, and by providing free content that is interesting that are guaranteeing your continued use of the product and that you will tell your friends about this game, which will in turn increase sales.

You see, unlike TOR, which was built entirely on hype, GW2 is making its profits through the credibility that free content updates provide. It is not as labor intensive as expansion packs, nor is it as far between, plus most of them require gems, which will always increase profits to a degree. Free content updates are going to net a profit for ANet or they would have been scrapped very soon after Halloween. 

What free content updates are not is a favor or charity. ArenaNet is not a parent and customers who complain are not ungrateful. When people complain about drop rates, about balance issues, about bugs and the lack of an endgame, what they are being is dissatisfied customers. They are saying ""This product that I paid for did not meet my expectations, please make it meet my expectations."" 

When the argument of ""but they give plenty of free content, what are you complaining about?"" is thrown around -and it has been thrown around, I assure you - it is harmful to the community and to the game. As much as you may personally find complaints grating and annoying, they are the only real effective way to voice dissatisfaction to a company without asking for a refund or in some way retrieving your money after you purchased their product. A company needs to know when its customers are not happy, because unhappiness among a customer base has a tendency to spread.

So please, when you get the chance, re-examine how you have thought about the people complaining and about the communities relations with ArenaNet and how it all relates to the cherished free content. Video Games are not rights, they are not privileges, they are products sold to customers, and while free content provided often is a very nice service, it should not buy credit with a community. It is not done for the benefit of the community first, but for the benefit of the bottom line; that is how a business is run and there is nothing inherently harmful about that mindset, but it is very simply how it works.

And please do not act like those who complain are ungrateful or otherwise whining. If someone is dissatisfied with a product they have a right to be unhappy and a right to complain. When you pay for a service and it does not meet your expectations, then you are free to be unhappy about it. This is not a christmas present. It is a video game, bought and paid for.

** **

Hello my fellow explorers! I present to you my new Guild Wars 1 locations on the Guild Wars 2 map, or as I like to call it ""**A Historical Guide to Tyria**"". First of all, let me tell you what’s new:

- Based on the release map (previous one was based on beta)
- I've visited almost all locations in game and adjusted all locations accordingly
- Zone names are now on the map
- Bonus mission pack locations are now on the map
- Added some interesting points that have more behind them than meets the eye
- Higher resolution! More pixels! Oink!

To give you a rough idea how the map was made:

1.	Placed the Guild Wars 1 map on top of the Guild Wars 2 map ([example](http://redd.it/t86sv))
2.	Mark all outposts, missions, cities, dungeons and zone names
3.	Go through every zone on the wiki and mark possible points of interest
4.	Visit and verify all locations in Guild Wars 2 (Nicholas and Yakkington would be proud)
5.	Adjust the offset on some locations
6.	Do the last 3 steps again for Guild Wars 2 locations that could be in Guild Wars 1

I will post a long list of locations and how they have changed over time in a comment below. If you happen to find any errors or locations missing please don't hesitate to tell me.

Before I crafted The Juggernaut I was under the mistaken assumption that the dye of my armor would be the biggest factor in the chrome effect.  This assumption was made after watching some videos on YouTube and reading the Wiki (which I have since updated, but couldn't quite figure out how to add new screenshots).
  
**Ambient Light**  
The biggest factor in the armor colour is the ambient light.  Which also means the best way to maximise the effect is to use a white dye (e.g. Celestial) to give the ambient light a blank canvas to work on.

Not only they are cheap (~1k karma per piece), they also have really good stats that you can ""pick"". What meant by picking is that you can buy any race's cultural weapon and they all have different secondary stats (for the most part). Say if you like precision, you buy the human one, if you like healing power, you buy the Norn one. If you like the Charr's huge blade, you buy the charr one. Unlike the cultural armor, the weapons are not restricted to race and barely cost anything and probably one of the best upgrades you can invest for your character. 


Anyways, I included a guide here with directions on how to access each cultural armor/weapons and some pictures of the cultural weapons at the bottom if you prefer to pick based on looks. Enjoy!

Trahearne wears a T3 cultural chest piece, T2 boots and leggings, and T1 gloves and shoulder pads, with no helmet. His skin (I forget but it was the second to last green among a bunch of them, Dark Pine or something), hair (Frost), and glow color (Honey) are all available to starting sylvari to choose so there is no problem there, and I imagine I'll be able to find the colors his armor is dyed via trial and error as I play.

We thought it would be a good idea to provide some sort of way for redditors to meetup during the upcoming beta weekend, below I've provided some recommend areas and servers which should help everyone.

As it is the first beta weekend this is all very much a trial and error, if any problems arise be sure to let us know by either replying or sending a [message to the moderators](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2FGuildwars2) and we'll try to keep this updated.

------

**PvE**

The recommended area to meetup is **Cobiah's Column** which is located in **Lion's Arch**.

[[Map of the area]](http://i.imgur.com/lqUrZ.jpg)

The recommended servers are the following:


* **Darkhaven** (North America)
* **Whiteside Ridge** (Europe)
* **Sea of Sorrows** seems to be the unofficial Oceania server but it's worth considering that the majority of redditors will be on the two above servers. (Oceania)



If you gather there **on the hour** hopefully you'll find other redditors, depending on how many servers are open and the time of day you might not find anyone there but fingers crossed that won't happen.



------
**World vs World**

The World vs World meetup area is a little harder to plan because of the nature of the map but hopefully you all fight hard to keep your main keep under control!

The recommended area to meetup is the **main keep** which is located in **your home World vs World map**.

**Mass meetup**

Here's the opportunity for everyone on the server to meetup at the same time and take group screenshots/go explore.

As before meetup at **Cobiah's Column** which is located in **Lion's Arch**.

Like the staves, there is a shield currently that doesn't appear to exist in game.

**Interesting Shields**

* [Call of the Commissar](http://dulfy.net/2013/01/11/gw2-shield-skins-gallery/#5) is not available ingame right now. It was never listed on trading post. It is a ""ghost"" much like Final Rest. However, the shield is very plain looking and there isn't as much interest in uncovering it.

* Want a big skull for a shield? [Godskull Targe](http://dulfy.net/2013/01/11/gw2-shield-skins-gallery/#21) is a good choice.

* [Diamond Aegis](http://dulfy.net/2013/01/11/gw2-shield-skins-gallery/#11) has a similar model to the [GW1](http://wiki.guildwars.com/wiki/Diamond_Aegis) version.

* [Jora’s Defender](http://dulfy.net/2013/01/11/gw2-shield-skins-gallery/#26) resembles [Round Shield](http://wiki.guildwars.com/wiki/Round_Shield) from GW1

* [The Chosen/Shield of Wing](http://dulfy.net/2013/01/11/gw2-shield-skins-gallery/#49) resembles [Shield of the Wing](http://wiki.guildwars.com/wiki/Shield_of_the_Wing) from GW1

* There are 3 variations of [Legionnaire Shield](http://dulfy.net/2013/01/11/gw2-shield-skins-gallery/#31), all of them can be purchased from [Plain of Ashford karma vendors](http://dulfy.net/2012/09/04/gw2-plains-of-ashford-karma-vendor-list/). The ~~3~~ 2 variations are for Iron, Blood, and ~~Ash legion~~ (Ash legion apparently just have a plain looking skin).

1365250106.0,309,self.Guildwars2,1bsjh3,My son and Tybalt Part 2 [Spoiler],394,85,204,http://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/1bsjh3/my_son_and_tybalt_part_2_spoiler/,"[My son and Tybalt Part 1 here](http://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/1bqcn6/my_son_and_tybalt_slight_spoiler/)

So after the soccer practise this morning we did The Battle for Claw Island. My son, who to be honest is rather skillful as a Ranger (for a 10 year old), cut his way through the Risen with his beloved Polar Bear and Jaguar by his side. He brought down the risen ship. He lighted the beacon. He killed more Risen. There was only a couple of times I had to point him in the right direction or translate some of the dialogue.

It took awhile, a long while but eventually it came, the inevitably ending.

When Tybalt talked the the main character for the last time I translated it to Swedish for him. I could see that he wasn't focused entirely on what I said, he was still into all the events and fighting that had been going on. It is the first real lengthy step in the personal story, the other ones up to this point have been mostly short and easy where he rarely needed any help from me. But he was affected by it, no doubt.

So when Tybalt walked into the courtyard and closed the gate behind him and said, *""I've done a lot of things wrong in my life. But this one thing, I'm gonna do right. I won't let you have them!""*, my son asked:

""Where is he going?""

My eyes teared up.

So I told him. I told him about the sacrifice Tybalt made to save my sons characters and everybody else. And I told him why. I told him the tale of Lightbringer Tybalt Leftpaw.

And my sons eyes got watery...

He hugged me and he cried. Not a lot, but he cried. He cried the ""right amount"", the ""right amount"" being ""I've lost a fictional character, not a real life friend""-amount. For the past years, ever since me and his mother got divorced, he's had trouble showing emotions when he is sad. He laughs, he laughs **a lot**. But when he is sad, he tries to hide it, tries to just ""take it"", to suck it up. Even though he is getting better at it, I was proud and happy that he actually cried this time and made no attempt to hide it. So... thank you ArenaNet?

I decided it was enough GW2 for today, we logged off and had some milk and cookies and talked about things, daily ordinary things but also important things. Life.

About one hour later we used YouTube to look at The Best of Tybalt, just as a reminder of the good times we've had with him.

*Tybalt trying to pose as a pirate:*

**Lightbringer Tybalt Leftpaw:** Yarr and rarr and blimey, matey! How's about you let us fellow pirates through? Avast, and bosun the prow-cap, sailor!

**Jackdaw Jailer:** Who did you say you were again, fella?

**Lightbringer Tybalt Leftpaw:** I'm Two-Tibs A'whisker, and this is Bloodcovered Backstabbin' Blackjack the Blade. Yarr. Raise the crow's foot and rope down the jib-jabber-gabber...thingy...

*Tybalt disguise himself as a woman:*

**Lightbringer Tybalt Leftpaw:** Burn me, I'm a human girl! Whoa, I've got two hands and some lovely...apples.

So even if there was a few tears and sadness, there was also laughter and joy. And isn't that the best experience one could have from the loss of a character, be it a fictional or a real one? Allowing oneself to be sad and morn but also laugh and remember the good times?

**For Lightbringer Tybalt Leftpaw! We will never forget you! Every Risen we'll kill from this day onward will die in your name!**

**PS:**
*My son knows what tool Treharne is, he's been watching me doing my personal story, listening to me complain about Woody and his annoying one-liners and tedious speeches. So when I told him that from now one he would be the one accompanying his character, that basicly Tybalt had been replaced by Woody, he looked at me and said, ""seriously?"" I could almost touch his utter disappointment.*

*For the past days my son has been leveling his Ranger doing only the personal story. I don't know if he will do that the next time he'll log on, I didn't ask. He might even play some of his other characters a bit more (he has a lvl 12 Elementalist and a level 11 Warrior). All I know is that the death of Tybalt effected him - just as much as the knowledge of Treharne joining annoyed him. So the lesson my son learned (or will learn) is this: The Personal Story up until The battle for Claw Island is mostly a very good and fun experience. After that, its mostly tedious and mind-numbing slaughter of Risen while listening to Treharne saying, ""This wont end well"". Or lying downed, waiting for the main character to finish the job and ress him.*",[Spoiler],False,self,t5_2r9po,1365250717.0,spo,CharrE,True,t3_1bsjh3,http://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/1bsjh3/my_son_and_tybalt_part_2_spoiler/,

Back pieces drop fairly often from Fractals of the Mists, in anywhere from masterwork to exotic quality. There are five different stat combinations, and only two of the guild backpacks' stats are available as drops. The Exotics are account bound, but the rares can be put up for sell on the trading post, *and they're cheap.*

At least, compared to the five gold you have to pay per guild backpack. I hold no illusion that someone isn't going to capitalize on that, but at the moment many of them are selling for five silver each. The value on them if you're looking for a rare back piece while you search for exotics or ascended is incredible.

* Cavalier's Spineguard - Power, Toughness, Crit. Damage
* Magi's Spineguard - Healing, Precision, Vitality 
* Rabid Spineguard - Condition damage, Precision, Toughness
* Soldier's Spineguard - Power, Toughness, Vitality
* Wayfarer's Spineguard - Magic Find, Toughness, Vitality

So if you need a back piece for cheap, this is the best time to get one. You won't be able to display a guild emblem, but for most people that's not going to be a problem.

1353265789.0,300,self.Guildwars2,13epnj,Please...show a bit of dungeon courtesy,398,98,133,http://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/13epnj/pleaseshow_a_bit_of_dungeon_courtesy/,"Most of my time is spent running dungeons, particularly AC and now FoTM.  75% of the time I can run fine with me guildies, but on occasion I must run with a PUG.  As the weeks have passed I have started to see a series of disturbing practices that end up making the dungeon twice as hard or harder for part of the group.  I have compiled what should be mostly common sense in dungeon courtesy, to try to raise awareness.

1) Please do not run far ahead of the group.  Far too often have I seen the coordination in groups broken because some 1337 xXXSniperPornNOSC0PzXXx has decided he can handle a sub-boss by himself and complain when he is the first to die.  Also triggering events way before the rest of the team gets there is a good way to piss everyone off.

2) If you plan on skipping a particular part please make sure the rest of the group is on par with that.  There may be 2 people in your group who have never done this dungeon or done it your way.  I particularly hate skipping anything (for AC this includes skipping the first dungeon burrow, Kohler, and running past most enemies), but if the rest of the group is in accordance I don't mind.  When you skip parts and don't communicate you murder your team when someone dies and has to run back through all of that.

3) Don't assume everyone is a veteran of a dungeon.  If there is even one person who has never done it, be patient and take a few minutes to explain some strategies.  It doesn't help you or the team if you have one member constantly dying/ breaking armor b/c he simply doesn't know.

4) For the most part, WP as soon as you die and rejoin your group ASAP.  If your team has wiped, regroup and refight as a cohesive group.

5) COMMUNICATION!  Just make sure EVERYONE is on the same page and you vote to make decisions.  If your opinion is not popular, just do as the majority demands (trust me, it is not worth your tears...better to trade them for the Ascalonian variety).

1352437045.0,304,self.Guildwars2,12wdrv,Coriolis Plaza a hint at things to come?,383,79,58,http://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/12wdrv/coriolis_plaza_a_hint_at_things_to_come/,"Today I was bored farming and playing through the game and was just wandering around Lion's Arch aimlessly. I happened to stumble into the area next to the central fountain (or what used to be the central fountain) and into Coriolis Plaza. 

As I looked around, I noticed that the gates have a direct corelation between their location and the Asura Gates in Gate Hub Plaza. On first inspection, its hidden pretty well, but then I thought of the name ""Corialis"" and hit Wikipedia. As someone who has not done much in the study of Physics, most was confusing, but I found this blurb interesting:

""...in the 1651 Almagestum Novum, writing that rotation of the Earth should cause a cannon ball fired to the north to deflect to the east.""

Drawing a line then through the fountain and understanding that as the deflection occurs that the precieved rotation of the object relative to the initial orientation occurrs, then it can be assumed that the Coriolis Plaza is actually a mirror of the Gate Hub Plaza. After playing around in Windows Paint a bit (my photoshop skills are a bit rusty...), I found that if you rotate twice 90 degrees to the right (and add a couple more degrees to the rotation) the lines drawn from the gates are almost similar to the gates in the Gate Hub Plaza. 

How does this give us some spoilers to the future of the game though? well, there are more gates in Corialis Plaza then there are in the Gate Hub Plaza. Don't worry conspiracy theorists, there is still an explanation... When you stand on the bridge leading over to Gate Hub Plaza and assume you are 6 on a clock, gates are located at 8, 10, 12, 2, and 5. There are islands that can easily support gates at the 7, 9, 11, 1, and 3 positions.

The gates at Coriolis Plaza line up when the first gate on the left is the Norn gate (8 o'clock at Gate Hub Plaza) and then everything else rotated off that point. This gives us a possible preview of potentially new gates springing up in the future. If you go under the assumption that the first gate to the left in Coriolis Plaza is the Norn Gate, then the one immediately next to it does not correlate with any of the gates in Gate Hub Plaza. That would imply there may be another gate springing up on that island in the future. The one gate from Gate Hub Plaza that does not have a Coriolis Plaza equivalent is the Asura Gate. At present time it would be burried in the wall. This does not mean the wall cannot be excavated in the future though. Likewise, the gate on the immediate right as you enter Coriolis Plaza is not the one that lines up with the human gate, but instead is the one next to that gate. This could mean that there is even more potetial to expand to a new continent even.

What I got to thinking off this is as follows:

1) Coriolis Plaza is a preview of potentially more gates
2) The principal is off a shot fired from the south drifting east, does this mean that we won't see this plaza utilized until we enter the Desert? or possibly that Fort Trinity becomes the new focal point? Maybe even Cantha (although that line tends to go southeast and not a direct path to Cantha)
3) Is this a hint at possible future racial cities?
4) Am I going insane and possibly have too much free time on my hands?

Anyways, I am greatly interested in your opinions on this and and especially intreagued if you have any more physics insight or knowledge about the effect than I can obtain from reading Wikipedia for a few minutes.",,False,self,t5_2r9po,False,,AsuraG,True,t3_12wdrv,http://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/12wdrv/coriolis_plaza_a_hint_at_things_to_come/,

I never played the Thief like that and I am having huge amounts of fun and success in my sPvP and WuvWuv. I go for survivability (21,5k HP, 2250 armor) and mobility, with a big focus on jumping in and out of stealth (Cloak &amp; Dagger, Healing Stealth, Steal).
I try to confuse enemy players, bleed them, blind them, vanish in one place and show up in another. And I am having great success with it!
I love how stealth is not a semi-permanent thing, but instead a quick burst of misdirection and safety.

Special thanks to Redditor **Gariy** who gave his time and expertise in developing surveys to help make the Post-BWE 2 Survey even better. A big thank you goes out to everyone who gave feedback for improvements back in May.


The survey is **much longer** than the Brief Post-BWE Survey. Things to note:

* The long form questions are optional, don't fret if you want to leave them blank.

* All other questions are required. This might be a bit clunky but it's due to some of the Google Survey platform limitations.

* Due to the platform limitations some of the more robust suggestions from the community couldn't be implemented. Sorry!


I'm thinking about keeping the survey live until Saturday morning EST and then we will have some basic numbers and graphs that Google Surveys generates.

One thing I learned while painting this is that holy crap there's so much more details in their faces compared to the other races. Was really fun to paint though, so many different textures!

If anyone is interested, here are more portraits I've previously painted of my warriors-

As you may know, I got 100% world completion on Thursday, August 31. 

As of Sunday, September 2nd, they added a new POI to the game. Upon finding it, I got a new reward. 

Screenshot found here: http://imgur.com/Romo7,JY4Sq#1

So, while I first received no rewards upon my initial completion, upon my second completion I received a gift that can get me a(some) legendary weapon(s). Cool right?

I also posted a guide about how I got 100% world completion, and you can find it on my twitch page at www.twitch.tv/misterslin underneath the Guild Wars 2 header.

Enjoy!

I want to shed some light on other consumables that may or may not be well known and can be quite useful depending on the situation. Hopefully this will inspire some of you to go back to the low level zones and do some events to unlock them. 

Most consumables are not useable in WvW and sPvP unless otherwise specified. **I will briefly describe their function and acquisition here and there are more detailed maps and info inside the links.**

Most consumable vendors are only unlocked after completing a small chain of events so don't expect to walk in and buy the stuff right away. 

**Utilities**

* [Ash Legion Spy Kit](http://dulfy.net/2013/01/16/gw2-useful-and-fun-consumables-guide/#1) (invis): Probably the most popular consumable, 10s of invis if you stand still. Very useful in various PvE situations. Purchased for 28 karma in Plains of Ashford near Black Citadel
* [Order of Whispers Spy Kit](http://dulfy.net/2013/01/16/gw2-useful-and-fun-consumables-guide/#2) (stealth): Less used than Ash Legion kit but this one grant you 3s of stealth while moving + blindness to enemies. Purchased for 16 copper in Caledon Forest (near Morgan's Spiral)
* [Effigy Fragment](http://dulfy.net/2013/01/16/gw2-useful-and-fun-consumables-guide/#3) (light source): Can be used in WvW and act as lightsource which are very useful in jumping puzzles with dark rooms. Purchased for 1 silver 4 copper in Fireheart Rise (near CoF entrance). 

* [Experimental Rifle](http://dulfy.net/2013/01/16/gw2-useful-and-fun-consumables-guide/#3b) - Rifle with a ""rocket jump"" ability that you can aim. Purchased in Malchor's Leap

* [Experimental Teleportation Gun](http://dulfy.net/2013/01/16/gw2-useful-and-fun-consumables-guide/#4) (short range jump + portal): Useful if you need to cross a wide gap on the same vertical plane. Purchased from 32 copper in Timberline Falls 


**Buffs and Debuffs**

These consumables allow you to gain swiftness/fury/might without equipping speciifc weapons/traits (i..e stuck in combat) and apply debuffs to certain bosses without using specific weapon skills /traits (i.e. poison to bosses that heal, and vulnerability + weakness to mobs to make them die faster and hit softer)

* [Depleting Power Crystal](http://dulfy.net/2013/01/16/gw2-useful-and-fun-consumables-guide/#4b) (apply 6 stacks of bleed + 5 stacks of vulnerability on foes, 900 range, no CD on use). Purchased in Caledon Forest

* [Pot of Hylek Poison](http://dulfy.net/2013/01/16/gw2-useful-and-fun-consumables-guide/#8) (swiftness + AoE poison). Unlike the med kits, you do not need to run over the dropped item to gain swiftness (handy in small spaces) and poison is useful for mobs that heal. Purchased in Timberline Falls for 32 copper. 
* [Rotten Drake Egg](http://dulfy.net/2013/01/16/gw2-useful-and-fun-consumables-guide/#9) (2 stacks of might per consume): If you spam it, you can get to 16-20 stacks of might. Purchased in Queensdale for 14 karma
* [Skale Venom](http://dulfy.net/2013/01/16/gw2-useful-and-fun-consumables-guide/#10) (chance to inflict weakness + vulnerability on critical hits): Lasts for 10 minutes or until you get downed. Really useful in PvE and can be used in WvW. Purchased in Iron Marshes for 16 copper.

I have played a lot of Korean mmos and it is something I enjoy.

This anti-bot diminishing returns on loot has simply affected my play so much, its not even funny. I will grind on a group of mobs for maybe 20 minutes and BAM - no loot. So now I must relocate and attack other mobs for awhile so that I can get loot again ? It is just asinine and ridiculous.

The fact that this is pretty much the only bad thing I have to say about this game exemplifies to me the reason I dislike it so much. I love the game, but this is the absolute worst thing ever thought of or implemented - it only affects honest players. bots don't care about how long it takes to get loot/levels.

Just remember when you make things illegal that criminals use, they don't follow the law anyway and so that only affects law abiding citzens. So it is with this mundane and archaic system - it only hurts real players

Please please please Anet remove this silly and completely counter-intuitive  mechanic so I can grind some mobs in peace. 

**edit: frontpage wtf.** I just want to reiterate that I love this game - this mechanic is just SO broken. To me it isn't even about farming, it is about fun. People can grind WvWvW for 10 hours if they want, or do dungeons for 10 hours if they want, but I cannot farm a group of mobs for 10 hours if I want?

**The story**

It's 10am. I wake up, I have breakfast, I get on my computer and jump straight into World vs. World. The map looks more/less the same as it was when I went to bed eight hours earlier except we'd lost Stonemist Castle and Wildcreek Run. According to someone who is now a friend, we'd lost everything except the Lowlands Keep overnight. Sure, no big deal, it always happens, and we took everything in our third of the map back.

Soon after I got on, Wildcreek Run was under our belt again after a fight which I missed out by a minute or so. Immediately putting myself to work, I upgraded the walls of the tower and got double delivery from Rogue's Quarry. *Wildcreek Run would be upgraded and I would make sure of it.* By midday, we had the walls reinforced, the gate reinforced, mortars and a siegemaster in the grounds. I spent a lot of cash on it, though it wasn't just me that spent it. A lot of people on my server mailed me silver coins ('donated') so that I could grab these upgrades, including Fortified Towers and, at Lowland's Keep, Fortified Walls. The amount of cash must have been over three gold. It was 1pm by the time we had upgraded it.

In the meanwhile, this upgrade spree at Wildcreek and spurred other members of the server to upgrade the other four towers and supply camps, even going as far to whack *eleven* arrow carts in Wildcreek Run and nearly the same number in Klovan Gully. The teamwork was **outstanding**.

Until twilight fell upon the real world, and the guilds came. 

We have two commanders on the server as far as I know. Personally, I'm not a fan of either of them, and here's why:

I encountered one of them yesterday. He came over to the Eternal Battlegrounds and bawled out how his might World vs. World guild had taken over most of the Borderlands and how we weren't taking Stonemist. Note that said castle was so heavily fortified that our happy little force could not really take it. That's fine, Stonemist isn't a big deal. So after getting twenty or so people to leave, his guild arrived. The sheer mass of people around this one commander created such a gravitational force that everyone of the map came to him, and the momentum of this group became so colossal that all of a sudden we were steaming through towers and it was *great*. Well, until we started losing our upgraded towers that we had been leaving behind.

The second commander came around today and the same happened. A group of us, who had been talking to each other all day, sending reports through Team chat, keeping the whole server updated about our towers, enemy movements, requesting support and siege weapons at defensive locations, were instantly thrown into the vacuum chamber as the sporadically-moving, silent guild zerg started going around the map, capturing locations and losing them when they moved on. We nearly lost Wildcreek Run, which I mentioned earlier, and Klovan Gully - as I'm told - due to the fact that our entire server was literally clinging to this commander.


**Why?**

Because when a commander comes along, he's marked on the map and his name is known. Suddenly, he becomes THE commander. He apparently commands the entire server. Well, unfortunately, that's not quite true. They seem to have no idea of tactical play, strategies etc, because they are the leaders of 'World vs. World' guilds.

This means they have a cult following wherever they go; zealots ready to lay their lives and gold on the line (as they have done to buy said person the Commander rank) to keep the zerg swarm moving. The lack of communication suddenly means that the largest force on the map - which is constantly growing - won't respond to the pleas of tower /keep defenders because they only agree on movements within guild chat. And then the hopeless of them defenders forces them to join the swarm just to stay alive.

As soon as a commander steps onto the field, the zerg follows. They don't command anyone. They don't even suggest things, or take suggestions. They don't assist places simply because they have such a huge army around them that they can stomp towers with their golems.


**What can be done?**

I know people agree with me here, and I'm not the first to say this; I'll repeat what's been said before: *The Commander rank should not be bought, it should be voted for.*

I've had people tell me ""You're the best Commander I've seen around here"" or ""Oh, here's the bad commander..."" (when one of the zerg-leaders come into WvW), even though I'm not a Commander. I'm just a tactical player that believes in defence, communication, teamwork and expansion for objectives, and I believe in tactical moves, the use of supplies and upgrades bought from multiple people donating.

I firmly believe, and I do so hope, that the Commander rank should be 'voted for' by World vs. World players. How would it work? Perhaps you could right-click a player's name in World vs. World and ""vote"" for them to be Commander. Then perhaps if 50% of the population of the World vs. World players on your server agrees, they get Commander rank for 24/48 hours, or up to a week.

And what would happen to those with the Commander Manual? I don't know, refund it or something? Make it into 'guild commander' or something? Just anything is better than giving leaders of large guilds a beacon on the map to force a zerg.

Just my $0.02, and I'm sure others agree.",,False,self,t5_2r9po,False,,,True,t3_10cz2v,http://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/10cz2v/the_world_vs_world_commander_feature_needs_to_be/,

* [The Predator](http://dulfy.net/2013/01/31/gw2-rifle-skins-gallery/#46) – envelopes the user with flames when drawn, dragon head shoot out flames, and leaves behind footsteps

**Interesting Rifles**

* [Charrzooka](http://dulfy.net/2013/01/31/gw2-rifle-skins-gallery/#7)- biggest weapon in game. The Hunter is probably the next largest. Because these rifles are so long, a portion of the weapon is buried in the ground on human characters when sheathed. I don't know what they look like on asuras (if you have a pic of an asura with it, please post :)

* [The Hunter](http://dulfy.net/2013/01/31/gw2-rifle-skins-gallery/#45) - This is one of the few legendary precursors with an unique model that isn't shared with a cheaper exotic. The model is also quite desirable. 

* [Vera](http://dulfy.net/2013/01/31/gw2-rifle-skins-gallery/#48) is a reference to the Vera weapon used by Jayne Cobb on Firefly, the popular Scifi TV show that got canned :( The color scheme is also somewhat similar to the real Vera.

I used transmutation stones also with them.. idk if that has something to do.

&gt; I'm guessing it's that there isn't a model for the cultural armor on other races, which makes the game display nothing at all when you preview it for a character of a different race.

**From : sg3s**

Didn't plan this at all, just came home from work and decided to paint for 3 hours. I think the forest is a bit too boring, and am not totally happy with my concept. However, that's how I paint sometimes--I take an idea and run with it until the end. 

I think the sylvari design and the thinking behind it is mind blowing, and can only hope to achieve such depth to my concepts in the future. This can be considered my little offering to the design gods and goddesses of ArenaNet. ;)

Hope everyone likes it! I'm finding this is a good way for me to learn more about GW2 in a way that I understand well. :D

We have become aware of some cheating on the subreddit, by owners of blogs and YouTube channels.

Asking for upvotes on Twitter or Facebook is heavily frowned upon, and goes against the spirit of the site. Voting is the core of reddit, and should only be done by the regular members of the subreddit, not manipulated by external sources.

Here is reddit's official stance on the topic: http://www.reddit.com/help/faq#Whatconstitutescheating

Breaking this one is the most serious, and could potentially see your account banned from the entire site if the administrators become aware.

Also something to be aware of is reddit's spam criteria: http://www.reddit.com/help/faq#Whatconstitutesspam

&gt; If over 10% of your submissions are your own site/content, you're almost certainly a spammer.

To participate as a good member of /r/Guildwars2, please don't treat the section as an RSS feed. Only post your own best content, and post links to other sites too.

Most people are behaving like model redditors, this is great. If you find your account banned and think you may have slipped up, shoot the moderators a [message](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2FGuildwars2).

What I've done here is compile a viewing/reading link list of lore coverage.

[The World Before GW2](http://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/The_Movement_of_the_World) Article on Guild Wars wiki

And last but not least, [The Big Lore Show](http://www.talesoftyria.com/tales-of-tyria/2012/1/16/tales-of-tyria-14-the-big-lore-show.html) video from Tales of Tyria, 1:37:55. This does a good job of tieing all of the above together as well as covering some of the specific stories and legends that the typical hero would know.

Also recommended: Read [Ghosts of Ascalon](http://www.amazon.com/Guild-Wars-Ascalon-Matt-Forbeck/dp/1416589473/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1335456072&amp;sr=8-1) and [Edge of Destiny](http://www.amazon.com/Guild-Wars-Edge-Destiny-ebook/dp/B003VPWXLU/ref=sr_1_3?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1335456072&amp;sr=8-3), two novels that further set up the stories of Guild Wars 2.

Happy loremongering.

EDIT: I'll stick bonus stuff here as I find it that fills in various gaps.

He hasn't paid much attention to the Personal Story before but the past few days he has been enjoying it a lot. Even though he doesn't know English all that well yet (we're from Sweden) he manage to do pretty much most of it without any help from me.

He has grown very fond of Tybalt. He love whenever he is around with his big ass sniper rifle, ""he looks soooo cool"" he says. Whenever he is playing and I'm in the kitchen or wherever, I can hear when Tybalt enters the scene. ""Tybalt! Dad, Tybalt is here!""

The problem I have is that he is closing in on The Battle for Claw Island...

:'(

**Edit:** My son have been playing for a while now while I've been making dinner for us and his sister. I checked up on him - and there it was, in the top right corner: ""The battle for Claw Island"". I told him what it was like, how lengthy it could be and that he should wait until he had reached level 50 (he is 48 atm) at which time we also would equip him with new gear (something we do every 5 levels and he enjoy) which would make it a bit easier. We'll probably play it together tomorrow (no more games for you today son, its friday, dinner is almost ready - and  ""Spiderman 2"" is on TV soon).

I've recently joined this subreddit and am blown away by the sheer amount of neverending blabbering about how bad recent patches are and how badly Arenanet is doing keeping GW2 alive. They are trying their best to answer to everyone's demands: making the game harder, making the game easier, adding more end-game content, make the game less grind-dependent, make the game more grind-dependent, ... A game is not drawing a circle: you can't do it perfectly. It's more like cooking dinner for ten friends: five will love it and five will hate it. At the same time, two different sorts of players will demand two different kind of games.

Of course, here is the place to debate whether or not Arenanet has taken a good step in the direction of your needs, but over the past two days, regarding Dragon Bash, I've seen over ten threads dealing with the exact same issue: 'I don't like it'. And all of those threads proceed to be upvoted by tons of people. We get it you do not like this update.

This place should be a subreddit where we deal with all the problems once and PROVIDE A VALUABLE ALTERNATIVE. This is so very, very essential. You can critique al you want, but it means nothing if you don't have something else you came up with. Arenanet can't read minds and is just trying to strike a perfect balance between grind, fun and reward.

I for one love the new update. An exciting minigame, not too difficult achievements (I got half of them in a single day by playing 5 hours in total, the event ends in a freaking month), and some damn cool rewards. Those holographic wings? Awesome! The Jade skins? Unbelievably cool! The free minis you all got if you bought some gems? Cool beans! Some of the items are supposed to be hard to get. If you'd get them right away, you would leave the game in a day and come back for the next update. Try to develop a feel of acomplishement when you finally got that greatsword skin, or that rare mini.

You can very easily downvote this into the ground. You don't agree with me because you think the event sucks monkeyballs. But that won't help you any further. What needs to happen is this subreddit becoming a friendly, social and fun place where we share ideas to make this place better. Not a dark dungeon where we all depress one another because 'this patch sucks soooo hard'.

Thank you and have a splendid day.

**EDIT:**

I feel like I’m forced to make an update to this thread. I’ve got a lot of response and I’ll try my best to give my opinion to a majority of those. In advance sorry if my tone becomes a little less formal as a lot of you guys don’t seem hold back using insults and accusations in yours. I feel deeply depressed as the Reddiquette does not appear to apply here. I have never meant to hurt anyone and simply stated my opinion on current matters, which caused said replies and a nice collection of downvotes on all of my comments.

First of all, and the main response I got, is that I implied criticism is bad. This is probably my own fault as I badly worded my first sentence. But if you’d all looked a bit further, I clearly said that I encourage you guys telling the devs where it’s at. The only complaint I had was that those complaints are often ill-stated and just a blatant insult in the face of Arenanet. In the past days, all threads seemed to have gotten a ton of negative replies in relation to the Dragon Bash patch. THAT’S GOOD. It’s very good. By expressing your experiences with the patches, the devs know that you didn’t like it and are more likely to change things in the future. Now my post was to urge you all to take the second step: building up your criticism with a series of arguments and ways you’d like to see it evolve. You can bend it any way you want, but what would you like to read more as a dev: “This patch is shit.” Or “This patch is shit because the lore underlying the patch seems far-fetched and childish. In the future I would like to see lore that involves an active threat to Tyria where the main characters of the game need aid with their efforts to stop the evil”? To sum this part up: I don’t discourage negative posts, I cheer upon them, but try to put more meaning into it.

Secondly, and to be honest , the one that has annoyed to me most and really disappointed me to the core is a ton of people calling me a blind fanboy who’d do anything to make the devs happy and satisfied. This is rude, unnecessary and irrelevant to the post. I can assure you I am not a ‘fanboy’. I do have my complaints about the game just like anybody else. The storyline was too short, the multitude of dungeons too small and the random events in maps are not as ‘spontaneous’ as promised. I do have these complaints, but as I have no real alternative except the obvious: adding more content (what the devs are said to be doing), I don’t feel the need to state it. Again: I am not just a fanboy, I am someone who feels empathy with a company who’s trying to give two sorts of players everything they want. As opposed to some people who feel like they have a magic wand that makes the devs create content to their needs as a magic genie.

To end, I would like to speak to the people who called this post a ‘bigger waste of time than the actual replies’ and that ‘I should just ignore them’. I disagree. That’s like saying to Martin Luther King not to mention his dream since if you don’t like racism, just ‘ignore it’. Not that I’m comparing myself to MLK. This post is not worthless because a lot of you (mostly those opposed) took the time of thinking about the matter and maybe learning something from other Redditors. It’s not worthless because I care about this game, and I care about the people that share that same sentiment. And if it maybe caused one person to think and go ‘maybe I should tell them why I don’t like this patch’, then I’ll be a happy man.

I only posted this with good intentions and hope to see you guys on some other thread someday!

Yours sincerely,

The previous three galleries were [greatswords](http://dulfy.net/2012/11/07/gw2-greatsword-skin-gallery/), [staves](http://dulfy.net/2012/11/13/gw2-staff-skin-gallery/), and [swords](http://dulfy.net/2012/12/06/gw2-sword-skins-gallery/).

There are 60 unique scepters in this gallery, excluding the basic starter scepter. This should pretty much cover all of the scepters available in the game at this time. Unlike the other weapon types covered previously, there are alot more scepters with particle effects/animations. 

Link to the gallery: http://dulfy.net/2012/12/28/gw2-scepter-skin-gallery/

**Scepters with particle effects/animations**

* [Emberglow](http://dulfy.net/2012/12/28/gw2-scepter-skin-gallery/#14) – flaming tip
* [Eye of Rodgort](http://dulfy.net/2012/12/28/gw2-scepter-skin-gallery/#15) – red misty effect around the eyeball, which turns occasionally
* [Flame scepter](http://dulfy.net/2012/12/28/gw2-scepter-skin-gallery/#16) – small flame effect when sheathed
* [Ghastly Scepter](http://dulfy.net/2012/12/28/gw2-scepter-skin-gallery/#18) – Turns blue at night and has a chilly effect when drawn at night
* [Glyphic Scepter](http://dulfy.net/2012/12/28/gw2-scepter-skin-gallery/#19) – white sparks and semi glowy orb
* [Immobulus](http://dulfy.net/2012/12/28/gw2-scepter-skin-gallery/#23) – spew out hearts, flowers etc when drawn
* [Inquest scepter](http://dulfy.net/2012/12/28/gw2-scepter-skin-gallery/#24) – subtle red spark
* [Krytan Scepter](http://dulfy.net/2012/12/28/gw2-scepter-skin-gallery/#27) – faint light inside the scepter when drawn
* [Meteorlogicus](http://dulfy.net/2012/12/28/gw2-scepter-skin-gallery/#31) – the planets and clouds move around and the scepter has a tiny trail when swung
* [Modniir Baton](http://dulfy.net/2012/12/28/gw2-scepter-skin-gallery/#32) – blue flames
* [Molten Scepter](http://dulfy.net/2012/12/28/gw2-scepter-skin-gallery/#33) – small flame when drawn
* [Mystic scepter](http://dulfy.net/2012/12/28/gw2-scepter-skin-gallery/#34) – subtle white spark
* [Orrian Scepter](http://dulfy.net/2012/12/28/gw2-scepter-skin-gallery/#39) – very subtle water drips
* [Peacemaker’s Scepter](http://dulfy.net/2012/12/28/gw2-scepter-skin-gallery/#41) – pink glowy effect coupled with pink sparks
* [Princess Wand](http://dulfy.net/2012/12/28/gw2-scepter-skin-gallery/#44) – sparkles
* [Scepter of the Dragon’s Deep](http://dulfy.net/2012/12/28/gw2-scepter-skin-gallery/#46) – misty effect when drawn
* [Shiverpeak Wand](http://dulfy.net/2012/12/28/gw2-scepter-skin-gallery/#49) – tiny glowy thingie at the middle

* [Zhaitan’s Reach](http://dulfy.net/2012/12/28/gw2-scepter-skin-gallery/#59) – the hand has a grabbing animation

The legendary scepter, Meteorlogicus, unfortunately isn't as ""bold"" as the other legendaries (i.e. twilight/sunrise, bifrost, bolt). It doesn't leave a footprint and only has a small trail around it when swung around. Eye of Rodgort might be more suitable for those looking for a more undead/necro theme. 

For those looking for a cool particle effect but on a budget, Modniir Baton can be obtained with very little karma. If you are in the Order of Whispers, Whisper’s Secret Scepter is also quite cool and some what affordable.

- “Tons” of bug fixes.
- “Some” balance changes.
- Portal is a cool ability that’s important to the game but has some problems (whatever that means from their perspective idk).
- The ability to use custom dyes in pvp is possibly coming in a December patch.
- Broken treb and lord announcements should be fixed soon.

So the last few days since my last upload have been interesting. For the odd few that don't know, I had my [last thread](https://www.facebook.com/GuildWars2/posts/114899191994975) linked on the Guild Wars 2 Facebook page, and ended up getting a lot of love over it.

I have to be honest though, as cool as all the comments I saw on Facebook and received on deviantart were, they just weren't as fun and comfy to read as the ones you all give me here. However, please just comment as you would normally! 

With the [last](http://jeffufu.deviantart.com/art/Guild-Wars-2-Fanart-Jackalope-Field-Trip-328928302) painting I had a golem chasing a jackalope. That set my mind off for the next little while, where I decided to spend the next three days during part of my lunch working on my idea of the golem eventually being the guardian of the little jackalope, journeying far to get it home. 

Thanks for being awesome everyone. I hope you like this painting.

And a quick also-cool thing that happened today. I blog about every month or so on my website, usually about what kind of art/design stuff I am doing, and more recently, just stuff in general. My most recent one was about my little fan art adventure that started here, with the [red golem](http://jeffufu.deviantart.com/art/Guild-Wars-2-Fanart-Birthday-Golem-328183229) painting. 

I was checking the blog post visits, seeing it go up to 18, 19, and then 20. Normal. I checked again a bit later, and it was at 64.

I thought this would be a time to release my endgame gearing guide that I wrote in the past week. Basically, if you are not sure what to do at L80 to get all exotics, then this might be a worth a read. 

**Full Guide here**:http://dulfy.net/2012/10/03/gw2-endgame-gearing-guide/

The guide is fairly lengthy and and to reduce the amount of vertical scrolling, I have enclosed most of the information in dropdown boxes. This allow you to skip the sections you don't want to read and jump onto the important bits right away. I will also include a TL:DR summary here.

Those who care only about exotics might find these three charts helpful

**TL:DR Summary of Contents in the guide** 

**Basic Information**

* Item tiers (White (trash) &lt; Blue (fine) &lt; Green (masterwork) &lt; Yellow (rare) &lt; Orange (exotic) &lt; Purple (legendary)

* Item affixes (Berserker, Rampager etc)

* Salvage everything that is L70+ for rare mats w/ discussions on salvage kit usage

* Map Completion your 60-70 and 70-80 zones for L70+ exotics

**Trinkets &amp; Backpieces**

* Skip rares and get Masterwork trinkets instead (stats upgrade is minimal and rares are about 45x the prices of masterworks)

* Mats you need for exotic trinkets

* You can get a rare guild backpiece for 5 gold (waste of money really)


**Armor**

* Fine/Masterwork: Cursed Shore karma vendor location and stats

* Fine/Masterwork: WvW karma vendor location and stats

* Rare: What mats you need to get a full set crafted (1.5-2 gold for the full set)

* Rare: WvW karma vendor also sell a rare set for 95k karma

* Exotics: Select sets based on your stats preference

* Exotics: Four ways to get full exotics: crafting (10-12 gold for full set), Dungeons (token grinds), WvW (Badges of Honor grind), or Karma (Orr Temple karma grind at 42k karma/piece)

**Weapons**

* Fine/Masterwork: Cursed Shore Karma vendors or WvW vendors

* Rare: WvW karma vendors or T3 cultural vendors if you got spare karma

* Rare: How to get them crafted w/ full mat list. 

* Exotics: Full mat list for regular crafting, mat list for mystic forge crafting, you can also get them from dungeons and wvw

**Runes/Sigils**

* A list of most exotic runes/sigils in the game with methods on obtaining them (mat list for those that are crafted)

**Food**

* Peach tarts for 26% magic find and +60 power (&lt;20 copper each)

* In sPvP you can snag all your weapon loadouts and fully customize your character as if you already unlocked everything available for your class, technically speaking
* In your options you can opt out of showing your helm, some of them are pretty ugly
* There is a seven day cooldown between paid server/world transfers
* Your home server/world is account based

1374527368.0,284,self.Guildwars2,1iu7ss,"I've played since launch, and one big thing this game lacks is polish.",396,112,172,http://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/1iu7ss/ive_played_since_launch_and_one_big_thing_this/,"I'm not saying the game as a whole is unpolished. In fact, NPC dialogue (both text and oral) is some of the best in the business, and new content is usually a textbook example of how to do proper worldbuilding.

That said, I'm really hoping we get some sort of polish patch at some point, or they decide to prioritize rolling out at least some sort of polish/QoL feature in the bi-weekly patches. If they push themselves to fix something every two weeks eventually it would add up and we would see a much more polished game.

* TP still lacks basic filter functionality (can't filter light/medium/heavy or backpieces, can't search for specific prefixes like Berserker/Knight because not all of those items have ""Berserker"" or ""Knight"" in the name) and doesn't remember what page you were on last. Back/forward button would be nice. [Changing interface size still ruins all the text in the TP](http://imgur.com/a/7DQbl). A way to search your past purchases/sales would be cool.
* Guild management is worse than many contemporary MMOs: can't see last played, can't see alt names, no calendar/schedule, only a small space for messages from leadership to the members, and guild members have to check to see if it changes because the game doesn't tell you if it does. We have heard recently that guild management is not a priority and will not get fixed soon, which I find really disappointing, considering the sorry state it's been in for the entire life of the game. Guild Missions are nice but that exacerbates the problem of lacking a calendar. Additionally, the Guild Mission UI does not update for guesting players, would be nice if it did. Same goes for the WvW UI when guesting, you can't see the current matchup scores if you are guesting.
* Clipping on many kinds of armor has gone unfixed. Weapons often clip through the ground and while sheathed (with hair/armor), large shoulder armor often clips as well. Many helmets remove your hair entirely, including facial hair. They fixed the Dragon Bash helm removing facial hair within about a month, but ignored other, older helms doing this, which I find silly. It proves that if they really want to they can fix the helm facial hair clipping but have decided for whatever reason not to. And Charr armor is horrific in most instances, but you can go see [u/Charrikayu's](http://www.reddit.com/user/Charrikayu) [excellent post](http://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/1isd48/i_want_to_share_the_agony_of_charr_armor_and_how/) on that.
* Achievement UI got a revamp, which was great, but what about balancing achievement points themselves? Compare PvE points to PvP or WvW and you have to spend many many more hours in PvP/WvW to get much fewer points than in PvE. These should be balanced to reward the same amount of points for the same amount of effort, especially when these Living Story events, worth ~150 points, tend to gravitate toward PvE. Devon Carver (WvW dev) has acknowledged this issue for months now but we haven't seen any changes.
* Person opening the dungeon leaving/getting kicked results in the entire party getting kicked out of the dungeon. It doesn't happen too often but when it does it's extremely frustrating that one person can hold your party hostage. Yeah, you can circumvent this by ignoring the problem and avoiding pugs or being the one to open the dungeon yourself, but that doesn't change the fact that the problem exists and Arenanet has done nothing about it.
* The chat often culls all player chat when you drop party or zone. Would it be so hard to preserve the chat until some maximum volume of text is reached?
* Items don't stack properly when you double click them from your inventory to insert them into the bank or vice versa. You have to drag them manually to avoid creating two stacks of items. It's the last thing on my list because yes I have gotten accustomed to dragging the items but really, the fact that this is even an issue seems paradigmatic of the levels of polish in this game.

TL;DR Guild Wars 2 lacks polish in a lot of areas. They seem able to push out content at unprecedented rates (what we are getting every 2 weeks is amazing) but frankly, it's starting to bother me how many things they have left in a sorry state for many months now.

1357131694.0,280,self.Guildwars2,15tnyo,"For all the recent complaints about RNG, farming gold, and progression to end-game items",450,170,288,http://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/15tnyo/for_all_the_recent_complaints_about_rng_farming/,"A lot of people have been frustrated/unsatistifed with the way ANet has implemented RNG into gw2 and ,with their forum posts, seem to depict a guild wars 2 where farming gold is ridiculously slow, boring, and tedious. So, before I comment on all of that, I'll just drop an easy way for even casual gamers to obtain a good amount of gold everyday.

**Easy way for even Casual Gamers to make gold**

Running CoF path 1 takes me(with groups found on gw2lfg.com) an average of 10-14 minutes to finish. 
That being said, i'll list how much gold one run of path 1 can get you: 

1. Slave Driver -- 14 silver(with omnomberry bar) + bag of wonderous goods
2. Acolyte/Saving Crea -- Chest + 10 silver + bag of wonderous goods
3. Opening the gate -- Chest
4. Legendary Effigy -- 21 silver + Chest
5. Finishing the Dungeon -- 26 silver + 60 Dungeon Tokens

You can use the dungeon tokens to buy lvl 70 rares in LA for 30 tokens each and you can salvage those rares for ectos to sell as well. 
Assuming .9 Ectos per Rare,

2 x .9 x 26 silver(price of ecto) = 47 silver

3 bags of wonderous goods you get 3 bag of coins and 9 dungeon tokens total. Since 30 tokens = a rare,
9/30 x .9 x 26 = 7 silver
Average gold received from bag of coins is about 4 silver so 3 x 4 = 12 silver.

Added all up: 14 + 10 + 21 + 26 + 12 + 7 + 47 – 3(price of omnomberry bar) = 1.34 Gold.

There. **You've made 1.34 gold in 15 minutes.** No exploits, no playing the TP. Thats NOT EVEN INCLUDING the possible rares/exotics/blues that you can get/sell from the three chests.  
15 minutes a day for 1.34 gold. You can spend the rest of your time online enjoying other content, dungeons, and other great features that ANet put into gw2.
Onto the topics 

**RNG**

People complain a lot about RNG because they seem to think that RNG is the **main** source of income generator. Viewing RNG as the main source of income is flawed and of course people are going to be mad if they see it this way. You wouldn’t make playing the lottery your day job because it isn’t stable. People seem to latch on to the idea that fast money can only come from RNG which inherently favor bots because it is a numbers game. However, as I’ve just illustrated above, you can easily earn good amounts of money. 1.34 gold in 15 minutes with linear progressions. Anet has put PLENTY of linear progressions in the game but people seem to just ignore that entirely.  There was a recent reddit post with around 200 upvotes that said gw2 needs non-RNG paths to endgame crafting materials. **There are. It’s called gold.**  If you are farming Orr for 2 hours a day trying to get Charged Lodestone drops. Yes. You’re going to have a bad time. Why? Because its not how ANet intended for the game to be played and your income is 100 percent RNG based.  RNG should be viewed as a **fun BONUS** to otherwise completely linear progressions. The 1.34 gold per dungeon run DOESN’T EVEN INCLUDE RNG drops. How awesome would it be if you could get 1.34 gold in 15 minutes and have the possibility of a precursor/exotic/rare drop? Wait that already exists. 

**Playing the TP**

If you played the Trading Post for your wealth good for you, you deserve it and here’s why. Playing the Trading Post isn’t some mindless thing. You have to have the insight and game knowledge to be able to predict price increases within certain items. Not only that, ANet has a 15 percent tax on returns(listing fee) So you not only have to predict price increases, but an increase that’s larger than 15 percent. If someone has a program or the ability to obtain 15+ percent returns then they should stop wasting their time with guild wars and play the stock market instead because that’s pretty incredible.  They also deserve it because when they play the TP there’s the risk of losing your money entirely. There’s no risk in farming. Higher risk =higher reward

**Value of Gold**

Despite what everybody says, the value of gold is not going down.  Here’s why. GW2 is a VERY new game so of course the prices of things are unknown in the beginning. Only through time and trial do people figure out how much things are actually worth. Everybody points to the Charged Lodestone price of 4 gold and just scream that golds value is decreasing but they seem to completely ignore that T6 materials like Vicious Claws(which used to be 25 silver) is now 5 silver, Vial of Powerful Blood(which used to be 26 silver) is now 10 silver, and etc.  Price reflects supply and demand and because Charged Lodestone is used in so many popular legendaries of course its price is going to go up. Other lodestones which used to be 1-2 gold are all now below 1 gold.(with the exception of Onyx). That being said, I think because of its high demand, Charged Lodestone drops should be modified but that’s a drop rate issue 

**Gold buying**

This is everyone’s biggest gripe. Is it unfair? Yes. Was it possible for ANet to completely stop gold buying within the first couple months of release whilst worrying about other things like gameplay and bugs? No. That being said, ANet is doing something about it. A lot of people are complaining about the recent massive and automated bans of people sending gold. Is it accurate? Not 100 percent. But what it does do is scare the general gw2 community away from buying gold in fear of being banned. That being said, Is it unfair for the people who did it early and used that gold to buy their legendaries or play the TP? Yes. Is there an even reasonable way to punish those people? No. 

TL  ; DR calm down, critically think about how you’re playing gw2 and see if your frustration is coming from a badly designed game or if you’re just not doing it right.

**Edit 1: ""Why can't i get _____ by just playing the game""""**

The reason it takes a much longer amount of time to get gold by ""Just playing the game"" such as map events, map exploration, group events, veterans, champions, and etc instead of dungeons is because **Dungeons are the hardest widely available option in PvE.** If you really stop to think about it, all those other ways of ""just playing the game"" are much easier than dungeons. **Reward scales with difficulty** and people seem to forget that dungeons are the hardest. Why? Because group/map events, veterans, and champions can be zerged down by groups of 10+ people easily and with very little effort. It's not very hard to afk auto-attack a big boss/event.  For example, for the end of the Claw of Jormag event, you could just stand near the cannons and afk range the elementals who spawn. Dungeons contain really difficult monsters/bosses, jumping puzzles, and etc which can easily teamwipe a group. I've never witnessed a group/map event that wiped a zerg of more than 10 people. That being said, i do think ANet should scale rewards better when you don't have a group of 10+ people and they're still trying to do events that are designed for 10+ people.  Its pretty much a server issue where some worlds have less people than others.

So you can enjoy the game all you want but your reward will be compensated by the difficulty of the thing you're doing.  

**Charged Lodestones**

One of the comments below from workacct99762 was very insighful so i'm just going to copy paste it here i hope he doesnt mind!
the sell price/sell volume/buy volume moving averages for Charged Lodestones approximately double from 1.71g/178.5/955.9 on Oct 27 to 3.72g/599/3584.4 yesterday (Jan 1). Compare that with Crystal Lodestones which went from 1.37g/115.2/373 to 0.8g/519.7/1217.
Add in the fact that early/mid October is when the Foefire weapons and Mjolnir got their wiki pages (indicating the start of a general awareness of what is required for them) and it's perfectly reasonable that Charged Lodestones are now more expensive, given the much higher demand.
Even more telling, Onyx Lodestones which currently have approximately the same demand (moving average buy volume of 3283.7 vs 3584.4) as Charged Lodestones with twice as much supply (1256.7 vs 599) still cost more than half as much as Charged Lodestones, indicating that Charged Lodestones are potentially undervalued/Onyx Lodestones are overvalued.
So if people are manipulating the markets on these items, they're doing a shitty job of it. (based on my silly assumption that the number of 1-10c buy orders isn't skewing the demand that badly, or that it's equally skewed across all &gt; 5s priced items

To add to that, Charged Lodestones are expensive because they're harder to obtain. Their main drop area, the Crucible of Eternity Dungeon, is not a very easy, and thus popular, dungeon. Therefore, it's harder to obtain Charged Lodestones in comparison to, let's say, Molten/Glacial Lodestones because the dungeons that drop these (CoF and HotW) are much easier and more popular than Crucible. This coupled with more popular legendaries requiring Charged creates the elevated price

A lot of you guys here on r/guildwars2 are fine people, and have made me proud to be a part of a game community that truly cares for the game and has a fantastic attitude with how things turn out.

The news about ascended armor has been extremely telling.  Many of you have shown your true colors... It makes me sad to see people turn on the makers of this game so quickly, before we even know the gross specifics about how the armor will work, how long it will take to get, and so on.  

The weeks before release were fantastic.  I felt at home here.  But seeing the disgusting and embarrassing reactions made by my fellow Tyrians has made me sad to be a part of this community.  Sure, you can be disappointed about a game's direction, I don't mean that you shouldn't speak out.  But jumping the gun and pissing your pants before you've actually played with the new update and seen the real outcomes is foolish.

I'm not a fan of the update myself.  But I'm open to see where they intend on going with this, and have decided to relax and continue playing the game I love.

**EDIT:** Some people seem to think that I'm in support of Ascended armor, or that I'm blindly loyal to Anet.  Read my last paragraph.  **I'm honestly worried about the state of gear progression in this game.

Forging Trinkets for Commendations is the best way to buy Black Lion Keys at the moment. There are a few options, but trinkets have the best key to gold ratio of any item.

I am hoping since the markets are quite large (candy corn, ecto, orichalcum) that the rates on those items won't go up to much even if people decide to make some extra keys. If they do you can always just use the rare trinkets to avoid the market speculators trying to ruin your Wintersday fun!

1. The ones who do seem to be saying ""Meh, They do the most damage and you'll mostly only see this class-ism in CoF speed runs. The classes are simple and easy to play and I want to be done with the dungeon asap.""  - so i guess that's the reason.

I know some of you missed it, I apologize but I felt anxious to share. The survey was up for about 20 hours, I think. Next time I'll wait for it to disappear from the front page!

[As mysteryoeuf pointed out](http://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/t1pb4/the_brief_postbwe_survey_results_are_in/c4iwrch) there are potential repeats in the data that sully it up a bit. I haven't played a lot with the google doc tools to try and correct for any of that, so just be aware.

**Graphs of the data collected:**

* **[Profession and Race Choices](http://i.imgur.com/WCgwl.png)**

There seems to be a pretty good spread across the profession choices within our Reddit GW2 community. Elementalist is clearly favored with 14% of the response set with Guardian/Warrior trailing not far behind at 11%. Engineer and Necro came in last at 8%. However, there is still a large percent of the community who are undecided (19%) or who like to play multiple professions equally. This question will be fixed to be more inclusive of different play styles (multiple mains) in the second BWE survey.

I was surprised with the high numbers of Asura and Sylvari but I believe there is some bias there are people are most likely psyched to try them out but haven't been able to do so yet. Once they are tested I think things like animations and other aesthetic factors may play into whether or not people truly hold on to them as race choices.

* **[Hours and Activities](http://i.imgur.com/H6wLy.png)**

The hours played item was woefully broken because I failed to diversify the top end. It looks completely skewed for that reason. I will fix that in the next survey as well.

Not surprisingly, Roleplaying was the least popular activity during the first BWE at 6% participation. Also intuitive was the high participation in aspects of PvE and the participation in gathering and crafting. I thought more players would participate in PvP but it is likely that people were trying out classes to find what they liked. I need a question that polls what activities players like to do as well as what they have done.

* **[Activities \(repeat\) and Age](http://i.imgur.com/unYhL.png)**

The age breakdown seems typical of what (I imagined, at least) the Reddit community is comprised of.

* **[Gender Expression, Changed your mind?, and Responses per day.
 ](http://i.imgur.com/wCIMf.png)**

90% Male. 7% Female, 2% Prefer not to answer. This item will be fixed to be more inclusive next time. 

""Did the BWE change your mind?"" Was a poorly designed afterthought. The question was put in rather early (134 participants did not have access to it but if you look at the raw data you will see that people have chosen a main profession but also selected that they ""can't make up [their] mind."" So the data here is really iffy. Next time the question will be ordered appropriately among the rest of the questions and will be worded differently to strengthen it.


**Raw data for you to play with in SPSS, Excel, or your number masher of choice.**

Doing event in Orr at the normal rate (assuming you don't constantly buy Karma boosters) gives you 378 karma meaning one Jug from one Daily would equal 20 events in Orr.  The entire Plinx chain in Cursed shore consists of at most 9 events (Plinx, broodmother, tar elem, arena champion) so really a Jug of Karma from Daily is a bit more Karma that sitting and farming the Plinx event twice in a row.

For me, as I am not playing for hours a day to get a Legendary, this totally removes the pressure to grind Orr for Karma (drops and gold are a different story).  This also makes Tier 1 weapons reachable for lower level characters.  I appreciate no longer having to worry about getting Karma at level 80 because I can pick up a daily (Jug of Karma) doing whatever I feel like in just a few min.  My (Karma) grinding days in Orr are done and I won't look back!

If only the loot drops weren't so good . . . .

Earlier this week I added the alliances system. It's still a bit rough around the edges but it works. You create alliances much the same way you create a guild. Once created, you can invite guilds to your alliance by visiting their profile page and clicking the invite link there. They can then accept or reject the invitation via their own My Alliances page.

Today I added some extra fields to guild profiles and I intend to make most of them filterable to make searching for guilds easier. The new fields are Timezone, Location, Minimum Age, and Twitter.

I'm also going to separate Languages into Primary Language and Other Languages in order to make guilds filterable and sortable by language, which isn't possible with the current free-form languages field.

One of the most commonly requested features is a total population for each server. I don't intend to add this because the number would be almost completely inaccurate due to the fact that many guilds don't state their size, and because many guilds aren't even on the site.

That's all for now. Any other suggestions are welcome, and if you know of any guilds that haven't added themselves to the site then let them know. It'll going to be a good thing for everyone to have a reasonably accurate picture of where guilds are rolling for launch, so that guilds and players can make more informed decision about where to roll themselves.

However, in game it feels lower than this.  The perspective seems rather flat in many places, as though viewing the game through a telephoto lens.

So which is correct?  Inspecting the projection matrices that the game sends to the graphics driver is off-limits.  But through computer vision techniques we can estimate the FoV by inference.

Going to Rata Sum where there's a nice grid texture on the ground, I took some screen captures and [measured the pixel positions of some of the intersections](http://imgur.com/cQ8P8).  Then I wrote a [short Python program](http://pastebin.com/Py5jdV30) to take advantage of the [OpenCV computer vision library](http://opencv.willowgarage.com/documentation/camera_calibration_and_3d_reconstruction.html) to estimate the parameters of the 3D view.  Beyond the usual pinhole camera model, two assumptions that I've made are that the center of projection is at the center of the screen (reasonable since that puts it in the middle of my characters head), and that the focal length is the same both horizontally and vertically (typical in computer graphics).  I've also verified the results of my program by manually reprojecting some points using the estimated camera properties.

Based on several sets of measurements, I keep arriving at an estimate of approximate 65 degrees for the horizontal FoV and a bit under 44 for the vertical on my 16:10 display.  This does not seem consistent with Jon Peters statement and leads me to wonder if either he's mistaken or ANet's perspective math is bugged.

In particular, I notice that doubling the screen scale from a 75 degree FoV leads to a 42 degree FoV which is potentially within measurement error of what I estimated for the vertical FoV.  There are [a number of multiply or divide by two factors](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angle_of_view) in setting up the FoV in the projection matrix. I wonder if perhaps they've erred on one and we're seeing half of what we're supposed to be seeing.

TLDR: Measurements suggest that the game's actual FOV is lower than ANet's intended value.

1332637823.0,273,self.Guildwars2,rc41r,Initial thoughts on the state of GW2,372,99,188,http://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/rc41r/initial_thoughts_on_the_state_of_gw2/,"First, my background: Someone who played GW1 (held HoH), and has been in the top few percent of players in PvP in myriad other popular MMO's.

* **PvE**

My thoughts are similar to the ""burned out after 1 day"", but hopefully I can do a better job articulating why I feel that way than he did. It's not that the PvE is too easy, which is sort of the impression his post gave. Questing is *always* easy in MMORPGs, and honestly it should be; if I wanted to play Dark Souls, I would play Dark Souls. 

The problem is that PvE is more mindless than in any other big ticket MMO. In WoW, or SW:TOR, or Rift, questing is really easy, just like it is in GW2, the difference is that in those other games there are resources to manage, procs to be on the lookout for, spells to be on the lookout to interrupt, etc. Sure, you can absolutely ignore all these things in those other games and still steamroll the content, but at least it's there; it's something to focus on--something to optimize and become better at.

In GW2 while questing, you will literally find yourself mashing abilities on cooldown with no concern for what any of them do. On paper, it might seem like there's tons of synergy between moves, but almost universally the reward for setting up these combos is non-existent and spamming your moves is probably 95% as effective as perfect play.

Dodging isn't super revolutionary, but I like it as a mechanic overall. It's basically a new way to avoid standing in fire, and also an essential way to drop aggro depending on the situation.

* **Structured PvP**

It's really nice to be able to get a maxed out character 10 minutes in and play around with it to see if this is the class for you. The battlegrounds are really well done, and the class balance actually seems to be pretty damn good. As much as ANet has attempted to bolster and upsell the PvE, the reality is PvP is still their wheelhouse. 

* **World PvP**

Something is busted about it atm, but I can already see that when it's functioning properly, it's going to be a real blast. Epic battles of large armies vs other large armies, smaller skirmishes between smaller groups breaking out constantly in other places. The hype here is well-deserved; it's going to be incredible and probably worth your 60 dollars by itself.

* **Performance**

Needs a lot of work. On systems capable of getting 40+ FPS almost everywhere in Skyrim (60 indoors), I find myself getting FPS in the teens while out in the world, and when particle effects go crazy during DEs it can drop to single digits. Interestingly enough, performance seems to be much better in structured PvP (smaller area I guess), but in structured PvP maps I seem to get 30-40 FPS regularly, which is acceptable.

I know ""it's only beta!"", but the same thing was said about SW:TOR and the performance issues in that game persist even to this day. I expect to be able to get 30 FPS or so in ""normal"" situations, with drops when things go crazy, but I'm finding that on average my FPS is in the teens or low 20's. The one saving grace is that even at 20 FPS it's surprisingly ""smooth"", spinning around rarely causes ""catches"". I would argue that a game that runs at 60 FPS a lot of the time and drops to 20 when you start turning is a lot worse than a game that runs at 30 FPS most of the time and only drops to 25 when turning. Still, this needs a lot of work; hopefully there are further optimizations to be made and driver updates which will squeeze out a few more percentage points of performance.

* **Aesthetics**

If anything, ANet under-hyped this part of the game. The game is beautiful, and the environments are varied and immersive. The towns are huge and they really do feel alive like they are a real town that you are just visiting, whereas in other MMOs often towns feel like they were placed there just to facilitate repairs/auction houses. GW2 towns feel like you are just a traveler visiting a vibrant city that is going about its day--it's really well done. Simply put, the environments are stunning.

* **Hopes**

This game as it exists now is probably worth 60 bucks considering there's no subscription. The PvP is really good. My hopes are that ANet decreases the effectiveness of button mashing and increases the effectiveness of skillful use of cooldowns. Make button mashing 50% as effective as perfect setups as opposed to 90% as effective. Also, the performance really needs to be improved. None of the graphics settings change the FPS I get, low settings are within 2-3 FPS of maxed settings (with shadows to low), and again this is on a system that is more than capable of playing Skyrim with tons of eye candy.

This post comes off a little bit more derisive than I meant it to be. This is a great game, and if they can squeeze some more performance out of it, it's absolutely worth your money. I feel bad about breaking the NDA, but I feel like with all the one-sided ""this is what's terrible about the game"" posts being made in this sub-reddit that I should at least try and offer the game a fair shake.

**TL;DR:** The game is beautiful, runs like shit, has some of the best PvP of any title out, and solo PvE needs to be tweaked such that skillful use of skills is actually worth doing because right now it's a mindless button mash with nothing worth paying attention to.

edit: It seems like the FPS issues are due to CPU utilization, not GPU. Even on my midrange cards, the GPU usage never goes over 40-50%, but CPU usage is pegging a single core on my not-top-of-the-line i7.

1334236231.0,276,self.Guildwars2,s63rk,Preparing for the Beta - Let's talk the 'negatives' of Guild Wars 2!,382,106,462,http://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/s63rk/preparing_for_the_beta_lets_talk_the_negatives_of/,"Inspired by a [recent find from MattVisual](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pugsvos4y5g) over at YouTube I thought it would be a good idea to start a similar discussion here with you /r/GuildWars2.

There's a lot of excitement in the air and the hype seems to reach new levels every week. This easily leads to people forgetting that nothing is perfect and if we're going to help ArenaNet while participating in the Beta events we need to remove our fanboy/fangirl glasses and start thinking critically.

This will hopefully also help cool down some of the ""over-hype"" that inevitably leads to disappointment.

I mention a few of the **potential** flaws below to start the discussion going, I don't even fully agree with all of them myself but I know they've been a source of discussion in the past. These could also be completely void flaws once we get to test the game, but I believe they're worth keeping in the back on our heads when first jumping into the game. After this it's up to you to add more examples or expand the ones mentioned.

**REMINDER: Do not downvote based on opinion!** If you don't agree with a certain flaw then **explain why** and try to convince the rest of us to see it your way instead.

* **""Revolutionary"" quest system** A lot of focus has been put when advertising Guild Wars 2 on how unique the questing system is and how it's going to change how people play MMO's. My worry is that this turns out to be simply a new ""look"" on an old system. The hearts can easily be compared with traditional quests where the quest giver is located in the vicinity of the quest. Several other games do this. Dynamic events can also be compared with repeatable/daily quests with the only difference that the quests vary from time to time. How this turns out all depends on the implementation of the systems and how they truly integrate in the game world. Which leads me the second point:
* **Dynamic events in the long run** One of the things that no videos of previous betas can truly show us is how the rotation and frequency of DE's will work in the long run. Will the novelty wear off? Will it feel like ""oh, here's another 'kill random boss guy' DE"" or ""'defend random village' DE"" and not this exciting feeling of a living world that beta testers have been telling us of? Especially considering that event chains rotate/repeat, will the content feel fake? I'm eager to put this system to the test.
* **Meta-game cookie cutter builds** For those who don't know what this is, it's basically what the top players, through research and experience, comes up with as ""*the* build"" that everyone should play as it's superior to any other builds. GW1 has this, WoW has this, most games have some sort of other of meta-game ""optimals"". Will GW2 have them? Will there be a specific combination of weapons, utility skills and traits that are far superior to other combinations for the same profession? If there is then the diversity between players that ArenaNet advertises will not be seen.
* **Messy, non-fluid combat** This has been mentioned before, clunky response time on skills, 'spammy' combat rotations, messy visuals, etc. And a lot of these complaints have been claimed ""fixed"" or ""you're not playing it right"". But I still think this is worth looking into **very** closely when we get our hands on the game. The combat is essential that it feels fun and fluid, so no matter what people claim I still feel there is room for scepticism and concern on such a crucial mechanic.
* **Lackluster personal story** GW1 was almost entirely about the story, you could basically ""finish"" the game, something previously unheard of in MMO's. GW2 is a step away from that but to keep those story fans they have the personal story. Will this be up to the task to replace the epic campaigns GW1 players got to experience? If the personal story is optional and more of a side-quest, will it feel as important and epic as it felt in GW1? Will it feel detached from the ""real world"" considering it's entirely instanced and based on your choices?
* **""End game""** No matter how often ArenaNet says ""there is no end game"" or ""the entire game is end game"" I still think this is something worth discussing. I feel that every MMO needs some sort of progression outside the character itself, a feel of increasing importance in the world. ArenaNet claims to have this in the way of how Dynamic Events play out and your personal story progresses, how you slowly learn more about the Elder Dragons and eventually reach the home of Zhaitan (the main antagonist of GW2). Will this be enough however? Even in GW1 where the ""personal"" story was an even stronger focus, there were many things the player could do once they finished the campaigns. The Underworld, the Fissure of Woe, Domain of Anguish, EoTN Dungeons, etc. All of it could be classified as end game. In GW2 however, ArenaNet responds the claims of ""no raids"" or ""~~no end game dungeons~~"" with ""you can always go back and finish DE's in older areas"". Will this be enough? Wouldn't this make you feel like you went from the one who fought against Zhaitan to a farmers apprentice fending off farm vermin? We'll have to see.

1373563349.0,270,self.Guildwars2,1i3c6e,Could the Zephyrites and Glint be connected?,318,48,120,http://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/1i3c6e/could_the_zephyrites_and_glint_be_connected/,"Greetings reddit, this is my first post here so hopefully this topic works out as intended!

After spending a few days with the new patch and reading various topics here i've noticed something that could be a link between the Zephyrite Aspects and Glint.

For GW1 players, we should remember that “The Dragons Lair” mission had us face 6 Aspects, consisting of Light, Nature, Chaos, Darkness, Elements and strength, which all took the form of a dragon, before we faced Glint herself, the “Crystal Dragon”.

This alone wasn't enough to draw a conclusion, however at the very end of the Zephyr Sanctum is a teacher talking to a group of children, she talks about how the Elder Dragons are not evil, but simpley forces of nature (This we already knew), but she also talks about Glint, and seems to place a lot of respect and emphasis into Glint whenever she is mentioned, I found it strange that a group living in the sky would know of Glint specificly, but even stranger that they seemed to speak of her in such high regard.

Now today I came across this reddit thread with the whole “Zephyrite song” recorded In game.

http://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/1i2mdu/i_became_obsessed_with_the_zephyrite_song_so_i/

In the song they appear to be mourning the loss of something, it can't be the aspects themselves otherwise the sanctum wouldn't still be flying, but some Lyrics really stand out.

“She flies no more in glinting beam and leaves a hollow hole”

Specificly refers to the being in question as female and a subtle hint with the word ""Glinting""

“Alas, her magic strewn in sand. Alas her soul undone”

Most likely refering to [Edge of destiny spoilers](#s ""Glint's death at the end of Edge of Destiny, where she died in the Crystal desert."")

“The clouds shed tears upon the land for the loss of our Crystal Sun”

This makes it sound like Glint was a core part of the Zephyrite “Religion”

“Alas Alas how time must pass. Ancient, magical friend.”
 
“So terrible, so dreadfull that so treasured should so end”

Refering to this being as ""Ancient"" seems to fit Glint perfectly so far.

Now the rest I haven't seen myself in game, and am going purely off the wiki, but on the Zephyrite wiki page has this sentence.

“Generations prior to the rise of Orr, a wise elder called the dwarves together and called them the protectors of heritage. Over time, guardianship was passed on to the humans. During this period, humans discovered the three Aspects and decided to construct Zephyr Sanctum as a safe haven from influences of the outside world and dedicate themselves to the aspects.”  

http://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Zephyrite

This alone sound's like nothing major, but in GW1, there was an order known as the “Brotherhood of the Dragon” 

http://wiki.guildwars.com/wiki/Brotherhood_of_the_Dragon 

This brotherhood being a Dwarven group with a connection to Glint as the Vision of Glint could be summoned in Droknars forge from their Shrine. (We also recieved a cloth of the Brotherhood in GW1 for completing the Glint challenge in EOTN)

Trying to put all this together, could it be that the “Wise Elder” mentioned by the Zephyrites who called the Dwarves together was infact Glint? And that the duty of the brotherhood was passed onto Humans after the Dwarven race underwent the Rite of the Great Dwarf in EOTN, renaming themselves Zephyrite's in the process?

This would mean that the Zephyrite are the modern day version of the Brotherhood of the Dragon, and would explain why they are singing supposedly [Edge of Destiny spoiler again](#s ""morning the death of Glint, having most likely just heard of her death now"") upon landing and communicating with the races for the first time in most likely years.

It would also explain why they hold her in such high regard as to refer to her as their ""Crystal Sun"" if she was infact the ""Elder"" who founded the order with the dwarves centuries ago, could this also mean that the powers of the aspects that the Zephyrite's use are linked to the Aspects that guarded Glint's lair 250 years ago?

Maybe i'm seeing links where there are none, or maybe i'm stating the obvious, but either way it interested me enough to make this topic and see if we can get a good discussion going =D.

Sorry for any formatting errors / spoilers not being hidden etc, this is my first post on Reddit so hoping everything goes well &gt;&lt;

As pointed out by anzenketh, Arenanet have uploaded a new lore Article on the Zerphyrites which seems to confirm quite a few of my suspicions! =D

Let's hear it.

**HOW ABOUT YOU SHUT THE FUCK UP, CUINA?** I don't know what your deal is, but you are the most unfriendly bank teller out of all the employees I have met in the various branches of your company. Are you constantly having a bad day? Or are you just naturally this bitchy? I get that you work practically 24/7, but so does every other employee in Tyria. Every time I see you at your workplace in the LA bank you are practically spitting at customers with a complete disregard for proper social etiquette. Now I'm no expert, but that can't be good for business. And yet your manager consistently places you closest to the door from which most people enter. What the fuck?

Why don't you take some pointers from your colleague Lizette? She works the same hours as you and still manages to be friendly and *nice*. In fact, I've been taking my business to her lately and I'm happy to report that the difference in customer service quality is well worth the extra walk. Can we get Lizette a promotion? Maybe make her the head teller, or at least transfer Cuina back to the Ascalon branch so that she can stop bitching about how the Legion calls? Who do I have to file a complaint to in order to get this Charr to shut up? I'm getting real tired of your shit, Cuina, and I know I'm not the only one.

Recognizing the name, I went right to it, and read a poem called [Wonder](http://www.poetryfoundation.org/poem/174685). Essentially, it is the story of Traherne having a dream or vision of himself descending to Earth as an angel and witnessing, or restoring, or creating a paradise amidst the darkness. The allusions to the restoration of Orr can be easily read, I feel. Furthermore, another poem, [On leaping over the moon](http://tartarus.org/martin/readings/poem01.html) in which he praises and remembers the strength of his late brother Phillip. If any of you played a sylvari story arc which brought you close to Trahearne from the get-go, you of course know that the sword he wields, Caladbolg (Rife with historical and biblical reference in its own right) was originally awarded by the Pale Tree to another first-born sylvari, Trahearne's 'brother', for the purposes of his wyld hunt which brought him into conflict with a great Lich of Orr. You aid in recovering the blade, and it is then wielded by Trahearne. I know that the brother comparison is a stretch, but its been acknowledged that Sylvari lore is so full of Arthurian legend, that I really don't see why MUCH of the GW2 story may not be influenced by 17th century literature.

1363724949.0,265,self.Guildwars2,1am62r,A preview of the Guild Rush missions,314,49,90,http://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/1am62r/a_preview_of_the_guild_rush_missions/,"Hey everyone, this past weekend, the guild I run guild missions with (Immortals Reawakened on Yak's Bend) was able to unlock Guild Rushes and we had alot of fun doing them. I thought I would give you guys who havn't unlocked it yet a taste of the fun activities you can expect as you unlock more guild mission categories. For me, guild rushes are the next fun thing after jumping puzzles. 

**The Basics**

To unlock Guild Rushes, you must have unlocked Guild Bounty + Guild Trek and have Politics 6, 50k influence and 80 guild merits. 

There are 6 Guild Rushes we have found so far. I think that is all the Guild Rush that are available at the moment. In each guild rush, you are transformed into a different animal and given three abilities. You must follow a specific path from point A to point B while avoiding traps and hostile creatures along the way. You are given 30 minutes to get 15 guild members to the finish line to receive guild merits from this activity but anyone repping the guild who crosses the finish line will receive a weekly chest containing 1 Guild Commendation, 2 rares, and 50 silver. 

The easiest way to do them is to have non-transformed players (I call them escorts) clear the way of hostile creatures and then transformed players just have traps to deal with. For me personally, it does take away the challenge somewhat and I like to do Guild Rushes with all the hostile mobs present just for the extra thrill factor.

**Guild Rush videos**

I do have videos of each Guild Rush course up you can watch to get a waste of what each course is like. I will list each course here in terms of fun factor (personal preference, yours may differ) 

* [Spider Scurry](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z5x4J9mC3XI) - I really like this one even if the army of dredge camped here can be annoying at times. You are like a tiny ""spiderman"" and can leap from plank to plank using webs. You can go anywhere you want - horizontal, vertical. 

* [Crab Scuttle](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mtVEM92-BF8) - Do you enjoy longwalks on the beach? What about longwalks in the beach in crab form while chased by suicidal karkas and angry reef drakes? 

* [Ghost Wolf Run](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtQZogmndTI) - This one is particularly enjoyable since I can leap long distances in wolf form and the scenery is quite nice (waterfalls)

* [Chicken Run](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_o5r-raRyc) - It is always fun when you get turned into a chicken and must escape nasty harpies and bandits. 

* [Bear Lope](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H57v-NItzns) You get turned into a cute bear cub but must journey through a nasty cavern filled with bats, ice wurms, trolls, grawls, fleshreavers, and imps. 

* [Devourer Burrow](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0KasSzq-BmA) Become a devourer and trek through a spider cavern filled with spiders and some of the most annoying traps. 

**Guild Rush guide**

I do have a more detailed guide in written format explaining some of the stuff in more detail but most of the guild rush courses are fairly self explanatory and you don't need to read a guide on it.

http://dulfy.net/2013/03/17/gw2-guild-rush-guild-mission-guide/

Anyways, most of the fun in these guild rushes is doing them so hopefully you will have as much fun as I did when you get to do them :)

It's worth the read though, and gives perspective on some of the difficult dungeon content.

As a GW1 player, I totally agree with what he has to say about the Domain of Anguish.  Here's the link: https://forum-en.guildwars2.com/forum/game/dungeons/Do-NOT-nerf-please/first

(This first paragraph is him quoting someone else in the forum post)
&gt; “What I would call ‘hard’ was trying to run Domain of Anguish and Mallyx with a balanced setup in the first weeks it was released. Many people called it impossible, but it was a heck lot of fun to do! Why? Because it offered veriety and fluid gameplay, quick and deadly like it should be. Not kiting a mob for 2 minutes and then walking into the next mob rinse and repeat.”

&gt; I’ll point out ironically, when we first turned on DoA back in Gw1 the posts you’re seeing in this forum from a few folks about difficulty were the exact same comments everyone had about DoA. It was “impossible, mobs were just tuned to do insane damage and have huge HP, there was no tactics to defeat DoA”, etc. I went back and read through the original DoA launch feedback and it was literally identical to the comments folks on the forums are leaving now.
We made the choice back then to stick with the difficulty, and give people time to learn how to play the dungeon better and overcome it. A few months later, people viewed it as the most fun thing in the game and totally reasonable without us changing anything.

&gt; We’ll be doing the same with the Gw2 explorable dungeons, our own internal testing teams and alpha test groups learned to beat them using a combination of player skill, synchronous builds, strong use of cross-profession combos, use of cooking/consumable buffs (these make a huge difference!) and well formed player tactics. By comparison, after having months to play the game and the time our alpha was complete, some of our better dungeon groups felt the explorable dungeons were too easy for launch, we decided not to make them any harder given the expected player skill on launch.
We’re actively monitoring every dungeon and working on balancing issues we encounter appropriately. We’ll be keeping an eye on bosses we think don’t have enough varied mechanics to warrant their large health pools and updating them over time to make them more varied/interesting fights. We’ll be monitoring, and continually tweaking/adding to dungeon rewards over time and of course balancing where we see the need. And of course, we’ll be looking at adding more dungeons as well!

&gt; All of that being said, the game is VERY new for most of our players, and I can absolutely promise with more knowledge of the game and advanced player skill, the explorable dungeons can all be overcome by being skilled groups. We’ve seen many groups do it just fine in our internal alpha test once they had time to learn how to play the game well. Just like Domain of Anguish in Gw1, it takes time and practice to learn how to overcome stuff as hard as our explorable mode dungeons, and that’s exactly the kind of players they are designed for.

Basically, I was unsatisfied with just being able to preview items in the clunky PvP Locker interface and wished there were a better solution for putting together outfits and such. I know there are some other sites out there that have static pictures of armor sets on different races/professions, but I still thought the idea could be taken further...

http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-4Da3uqUHh54/UQNJvhGQLpI/AAAAAAAAATc/qkxbwoGWro0/s1600/gw2_outfitter_finished_view.jpg

I decided to design an idea mockup of sorts that showed exactly what I had in mind for this site - the result is **Guild Wars 2 Outfitter**! This site would allow users to create custom outfits and then share them easily with the community.

Features would include:

* Sample model and armor/weapon previews in 3D
* Instantly filter results
* Outfit Mode and Dye Mode
* Shopping List with real-time info pulled from the Trading Post
* Account features
* Easily browse outfits created by others

For more information, including more screenshots and full explanations of the features above, please visit my blog: http://www.aeryplays.com/2013/01/guild-wars-2-outfitter.html

Guild Wars 2 is a really cosmetic game and there is such an importance placed on upgrading the visual appeal of your character that I think the community really needs a site like this to exist. The only problem is that even though I have the idea and drive to make it, I do not possess the necessary coding experience to take on a project like this. Honestly, I wouldn't even know where to begin trying to learn. I'm posting this in the hopes that someone with more knowledge than me in website development will see it and like to help make this happen! Or at least shed some light on how difficult something like this would be to make.

So if anyone would be interested in working on this project with me, I'd love to hear from you.
Or just general thoughts about this idea would be great, too. Thank you for reading. :)",,False,self,t5_2r9po,1360570317.0,,SylvariE,True,t3_17bx95,http://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/17bx95/guild_wars_2_outfitter_create_share_rate_a/,

I didn't capture the dialogue that she has, but she's sitting on that hill and admiring the view for inspiration.

After taking a couple of minutes and killing him, a chest opened in the corner of the room, and it *opened* Borderlands style, top opened, the two side panels flipped out, and the middle raised up.
