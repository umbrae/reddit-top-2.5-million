The appointment with the new therapist is at 11 am, four hours from now.  Four hours to get through.  I haven't slept, but I've smoked around 15 cigarettes tonight, until I threw up coffee (I can't eat).  I know if I don't go today, I won't make it to the end of the month, or maybe even the week, much less the semester.

For the first time, I'm going to come clean to this therapist.  I'll admit that the mood swings are getting worse, more defined: when I'm manic, I can't sleep, I can't catch my thoughts as they swirl all around inside my skull, I'm compelled to talk and be witty and make everyone love me.  Or instead I'll get so frustrated in the Starbucks line that I'm two minutes from screaming and attacking everyone for being so fucking stupid.  When I'm depressed, I lay in bed for hours and cry and fantasize about suicide.  The only plans I can make are to kill myself.  I have dozens of drafts of suicide notes lying around.

I will also tell this new therapist that I've been hallucinating for almost two years now.  I've only told one other person because of the stigma and because it's solid evidence that I'm slowly and surely losing my mind.  

I won't tell anyone where I've gone, and I know they'll take my phone when I get in because they put me there before when I chased a bottle of lithium with a bottle of whiskey.  With any luck, no one will notice until it's time to start drinking on Friday, because I'm a staple in that activity.

I'm supposed to graduate with a Bachelor's degree, a major and a minor like some sort of fucked up song, in May.  But that's difficult to do when you can't make it to class half the time, or you walk around campus audibly hating everyone, or the Ghost appears behind you or next to you and you don't believe in ghosts so what could it be?

As long as I make it through these fours hours, I can safely hide away from the world until I have shaven into new mirrors, until the the wound is stopped or opened

forever.

UPDATE: Thanks so much everyone!  They diagnosed me with OCD and PTSD while I was in there, along with the old Bipolar NOS diagnosis.  I'm doing a lot better, and I actually made some really good friends.  I've done almost a complete 180 from where I was last week.  I know it won't stay like this for too long, but it's better than the other option.",,False,self,t5_2qnv4,1359844592.0,,,True,t3_16qxlg,http://www.reddit.com/r/bipolar/comments/16qxlg/instead_of_killing_myself_im_committing_myself_to/,

The said person was triggered by the nasty comments and subsequently started to self harm and smash into a depressive and bad spiral. This user is a personal friend of mine and has come to me in confidence about the situation which is why I shall not name the said person. Said person has informed me that they will not be using the subreddit anymore because of this. 

So I beg of you, please be fucking nice to each other. I am appalled that this has happened after I worked so hard to create such a lovely community for us all to hang out and chat in. I did not put the hours into this sub for people to just argue and be mean to each other. It is supposed to be a safe and warm environment for us to discuss bipolar and show links and produce discussions. 

I would appreciate if you upvote this post so it gets seen by everyone (I receive no karma for self-posts like this btw).

Please be mature and be careful what you say, this is a very unstable environment for most people and lots take refuge in this sub because they know it is safe from trolls etc unlike the other subs.

PLEASE UPVOTE - REMEMBER NO KARMA IS RECEIVED!!,115,26,94,http://www.reddit.com/r/bipolar/comments/wnilp/rbipolar_is_changing_for_the_better_please_upvote/,"Well hello dear lovely bipolar people! Stupidmelon13 here - your friendly Moderator for the sub.

/r/bipolar has been on a bit of a downward spiral the past 3 months. For those of you that don't know me I took the sub over 7 months ago and drastically changed it from a completely dead subreddit with 200ish people in to the success it is now. We did this by being different, by creating a safe and pleasant environment for bipolar to chill out in and talk about things, joke and basically be free. 

This is currently not working anymore. Posts are becoming mundane and repetitive, with comments getting abusive and unsafe and not nice. Don't we all want somewhere nice? 

*So, now the rules are changing.* 

* No more posting for diagnosis

* No more posting about medication help

* No more posting about anything that your doctor should be handling

Basically, we want a positive area, a safe area, a fun area. You get the drift. We are not doctors, or physicians. It is a community to get to know each other, have fun, talk, discuss, post pictures, experiences, stories, etc etc etc. 

To help enforce this I am enlisting several of my assistant mods and promoting them to fully fledged moderators of the sub. I am bored of seeing posts that do not belong here, and people that are abusive and untoward. We have our own secret subreddit where we discuss this sub, so any issues that arise should not be dealt with personally but instead between ourselves in our sub before any drastic changes are made.

Remember, these changes are positive, if you can take a moment to search for the top posts of the past month, you will see what does well in the sub and what type of posts are welcome. It is that simple. 

Hoping that the new Mods will introduce themselves and add to this the changes and help they will also make in the sub in regards to making it a better and safer place, AND more interesting!! So new mods please comment below OK?!?!

Self posts are still welcome just save the medical and rant stuff etc for your doctor, or try /r/bipolarreddit as they may be happy with your posts there xx

Much love, hope you all understand and any questions please comment below :) SM13 xXx

The mood swings are like a roller coaster. Like roller coasters, every biploar's ride is different. For some, it is a series of hills of varying heights. For others, the highs and lows are unpredictable as you're whipped around and pass through dark tunnels, all the while hearing the supports creaking. And some are so fast and turn you upside down so many times that it's completely disorienting and you are shaking by the time you've completed a lap. Sometimes, you feel no support under your feet, which reinforces the ever-present fear that all of the safety measures could fail, and you'll fall to your death. There are those precious times when the track is flat and you're fine (euthymia), but it doesn't necessarily last long, and not all rides have them. The highs are intoxicating - you feel on top of the world, seeing everything around you from an enlightened perspective, feeling all-powerful and all-seeing, imagining anything is possible, but then you pass the crest and fall, racing out of control, unable to stop, not knowing how far you'll drop, how long it will be before you come up, or if you'll ever reach those same heights. There's no end to the ride. You can only pray that you can stay on a flat stretch for as long as possible and that maybe, just maybe, the next lap will be easier.

There are several disorders on the bipolar spectrum: bipolar I (manic episodes, usually with minor or major depressive episodes), bipolar II [hypomanic episodes (no psychosis or major social/occupational impairment) with major depressive episodes], bipolar NOS (doesn't fit criteria for type I or type II). I am diagnosed with bipolar type II, so I can't explain what mania feels like, but I'll tell what I can.

(Hypo)mania feels a lot like an ecstasy roll that lasts for days or weeks. It's exhilarating but eventually exhausting, and it can get out of control. Sometimes the entire roll goes bad.

Hypomanic episodes can feel great - elevated mood, grandiose thoughts racing through your head, high energy, great productivity, more social energy. Everything is wonderful. Everything is possible. Everyone is good. This can lead to some poor judgment calls. Risky sex, purchases, and gambling all seem like great ideas when ""nothing can go wrong"". This feels great at the time, but once you return to a normal mood, you look back and realize exactly how ridiculous it was and wonder how in the hell you thought that wasn't a stupid decision.

Hypomanic episodes can also feel awful, with irritability replacing the more pleasant symptoms. You just feel pissed off at everything for days on end, including coworkers, family, and friends. You need less sleep, since you're buzzing with negative energy. You make impulsive decisions, but they're fueled by irritability, not optimism.

And then comes the fall. I've heard that the higher the (hypo)mania, the deeper the depression that follows, and from what I've seen, it's true. Once your mood has dipped, you look back at the high and realize you were wrong about how great it was, which exacerbates your slide into depression. It's awful because something great can elevate you into (hypo)mania, but looking back, you're jaded about the whole experience, since you know your judgment was off at the time.

Anyone who's been depressed knows how awful it is. No willpower to get out of bed. No desire to do anything or see anyone. No hope for the future. Feeling worthless. Feeling numb. Unable to concentrate and get anything done. Feeling unworthy of anything good.

Bipolar II is depression-heavy, so this happens a lot. Some are mild depressions, but many are severe. Days on end of thinking nothing but how much you want to die. Inability to do anything except eat (there's a huge risk of weight gain with bipolar II). Hopelessness compounded by the fact that you think that due to your illness, it's virtually guaranteed that you'll end up down here again.

These inconsistent moods, emotions, and behavior can take a toll on relationships. People might understand if they knew where you were coming from, but there's still a strong stigma against bipolar, so it's not something most people want to admit. Even if they know, you are just so unstable. Supporting a friend through depression after depression is a lot of work. People are charmed by the hypomanic you, but that person can disappear for months on end.

Since hypomania is rarely recognized by patients, someone with undiagnosed bipolar II is just confused. They see themselves acting hysterically happy, abnormally irritable, and hopelessly depressed over and over again. There are often stimuli that spark the mood swings, but the reaction is far overblown. You see yourself as ridiculously overdramatic but don't understand why.

The diagnosis is a double-edged sword. It's a relief to hear a reason why you've had so many issues in the past and that there are ways to help, but it's emotionally crushing to be formally labeled as mentally ill. A lot of bipolar celebrities have committed suicide, so that puts a damper on hopes of someday really getting better, and it definitely doesn't feel fabulous to share this problem with people who are well-known.

I was just recently diagnosed, so there's a chance my drug cocktail will change, but as of now, I'm taking 200 mg of Lamictal. The pill is huge, about 1 cm in diameter. Every single night, seeing that I've got mental issues severe enough to warrant having to take this pill just makes me sad, especially since I will have to take it every single day for the rest of my life.

The worst thing to me is that I'm afraid to do anything that will make me too happy because I don't know how many more deep depressions I can withstand. After all, the suicide rate for bipolar disorder is around twenty percent.",,False,self,t5_2qnv4,False,,,True,t3_187cz9,http://www.reddit.com/r/bipolar/comments/187cz9/a_spoton_description_of_what_bipolar_disorder/,

Throughout /r/bipolar's history there have been posts asking if the submitter has bipolar and the like. We have decided as a community to create a PSA about Self-Diagnosis for this reason.

It is important that if you think you may have Bipolar disorder or any other mental illness you seek a professional. 


[Self-diagnosis](http://www.livestrong.com/article/265651-what-are-the-dangers-of-self-diagnosis/) is prone to error and may be potentially dangerous if inappropriate decisions are made on the basis of a misdiagnosis. Because of the risks, self-diagnosis is officially discouraged by governments, physicians, and patient care organizations. Even physicians are discouraged from engaging in self-diagnosis, because doctors too make mistakes in diagnosing themselves. If the self-diagnosis is wrong, then the misdiagnosis can result in improper health care, including wrong treatments and lack of care for serious conditions.

It is important that you know that no one here is qualified to diagnose you including yourself. We can and will offer support from a place of experience. Everyone is still encouraged to post and ask for local resources as we may have missed some below, but please be mindful of self-diagnosis.

_______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

**How to get Treatment:** (after getting a diagnosis)

* Contact a licensed Psychologist in your area - waiting lists maybe long and you may have to call around to find a doctor that has openings for new patients that will take you soon. If you have access to a database of doctors in your insurance network online this is a big help (it really helped me out). 


* Document any changes that you can recall in your moods or behavior- the initial visit may seem daunting if you have never been in therapy before and having everything documented can help the psychologist and you a great deal.


* Be aware of family history- Some mental illnesses have a tendency to be prominent in families, knowing this information can be quite helpful to your doctors. 


* Keep a mood diary for the days or week(s) up to your appointment.- There are some that provide integration with smartphones and desktops 
	* http://www.findingoptimism.com/ - Desktop and mobile
	* https://www.facingus.org/
	* http://www.mymoodtracker.com/ - mobile app only

* Once you have seen your Psychologist you may also see a Psychiatrist who can provide medication. For some of us, we have made this decision and are happy on this path.  

 For others medication is not what is desired. Either way, work with your Psychologist to determine which path is best for you and always make sure your voice is heard.
	
* For those of you that decide to take medication...**PLEASE DO NOT ADJUST OR STOP TAKING YOUR MEDICATION WITHOUT CONSULTING YOUR PSYCHIATRIST!**. If you are about to run out of medication, contact your psychiatrist ASAP.

If I had cancer (which I do believe is just as bad) I would get sympathy and not judgement for having a TERRIBLE day with my illness. 

Fighting suicide is hard and scary. It is terrible. After my last attempt in 2009 I vowed never to try it again, and I haven't. However, with my pregnancy I have felt the worst suicidal compulsions. I will not hurt myself. Maybe that is why I get no sympathy. I had a HARD day. I have HARD days and it's like no one cares. I want what I am going through to be recognized as hard. 

I get feelings of the most intense heartbreak, and I hold on tight not to die. I don't feel like people really understand what I'm going through. It makes me feel so alone. I feel like they see me as ""less than"" others. I am struggling just like someone with any other illness. 

Thank you. Hoping for relating and/or advice so I don't feel alone. 

EDIT: Thank you everyone! All your comments and even upvotes helped a big deal. 

I also want to add a comment that someone left that describes part of what I'm trying to say very well:

It's especially frustrating because not only do people not view those with a mental illness as strong like they do someone who battles a ""normal"" illness, but they often even see them as weak.""

Thank you goosie7!!

What do you think?


 [From buzzfeed.com](http://www.buzzfeed.com/whitneyjefferson/nick-cannon-wrote-an-open-letter-to-amanda-bynes) 

""As we all know I do interviews every single day about all my various projects, whether promoting AGT, Wild’N Out, my album, my stand-up special, NCredible consumer products, and various philanthropic and charitable efforts. Usually during these interviews I am consistently questioned about my wife, my kids, and my health and I happily answer them all. But as of lately I have been hit with an onslaught of questions about someone I consider family, someone I watched grow up, and someone I genuinely feel is one of the most pleasant human beings I have had the pleasure of meeting, Amanda Bynes.

The questions have ranged from, “Have you spoken to Amanda” to “Are you working on her rap album”. Sometimes I would answer in a playful humorous manner and sometimes I would brush it off as another Pop culture topic that a reporter was trying to retrieve a sound bite for. But after recent events of Amanda being admitted under psychiatric care and reported as 5150, I see this as no laughing matter. I tweeted a few weeks about how the entertainment industry just consumes people and spits them out like flavorless bubblegum. A few chews of enjoyment then they’re under a city bus bench. Don’t get me wrong this is not a pity for the popular statement. I am always the first to say that fame and entertainment is one of the best and easiest occupations to ever have, but one must know how to navigate through the matrix or you may find yourself in a very dark hole.

When a person is told all of their life that they are awesome, the best, the greatest and they are catered to every moment of the day. Imagine being the breadwinner in your household before you can even drive. Imagine you parents, teachers, and employers NEVER telling you NO. Anything you ask for or want, the world gives you, at some point you are bound to self-destruct. I call this “access to excess”. I’ve seen it happen to many of my friends and colleagues young and old. It goes back to that old saying; “Too much of anything is bad for anyone”. Whether it’s fame, money, sex, drugs, attention. It’s all a dangerous addiction. When there is no balance in your life a person will always become victim to their reality or lack thereof. The question is, when this destruction occurs, who is there to help put back the pieces. What do you do when you have no solid support system? When you feel like your friends are talking behind your back. When you feel like your co-workers are jealous and out to competitively sabotage you. When you feel your family has turned your back on you. When you feel like you parents have a conditional appreciation for you and only really love your money. You find yourself alone in that dark hole. Then you have to rely on your own devices once again in this vulnerable state. You become paranoid, frantic, manic, irrational because you can bounce your thoughts or ideas off of anyone anymore. Your reality no longer allows you to reason with the world, so you try to break through to get back to what you think is common ground. You are either trying to get back “hot” again or just searching for that adulation that you once received daily from the masses. Then enters the media, or what I like to call the ultimate magnifier. It’s like if you have a delicate piece of tissue under the sun, that tissue is under INTENSE heat with nowhere to escape but once you place a magnifying glass over that tissue, it’s bound to instantly burn up in flames. This is what I believe happens to many people in the public eye and we all sit back and judge these people for our own entertainment.

We say things like, ” I’m glad I’m not famous “, “Celebrities are Crazy”, “See what fame and money does to people”. And most of the time your assumptions and accusations maybe accurate but also inappropriate. No one on this planet needs to be judged or even has the right to judge. We are all equal and we all have our downfalls, fame or no fame. Money or no money. Life is hard for everyone in some since. And we need each other to in times of despair. No one can make it through anything alone. So I ask people who are quick to judge, tweet, report, or comment to ask yourself; what if that person was my sister? My brother? My Mother? Or me? What then would I say? In the words of the great poet and artist Bill Withers, 'Sometimes in our lives We all have pain, we all have sorrow'. We all end up alone in that dark hole at some point in our lives and if you don’t have a foundation of friends and family to help bring you up and out it makes that journey long and detrimental.
So I say to my sister Amanda Bynes you’re not alone. I’m here for you. I understand. I care and I appreciate you, because that’s what family does and that’s what family is for. I also extend this to anyone else in my life, past or present that may find themselves in hard times. I’m here! Call me! Because I truly believe, the hand you’re helping up today may be the one you’re reaching for tomorrow. So not to be all cheesy and over sentimental but I got to end this with the ingenious Wither’s lyrics 'Lean on me when you’re not strong and I’ll be your friend, I’ll help you carry on. For it won’t be long until I’ll need somebody to lean on.'""",,False,self,t5_2qnv4,False,,hotpink,True,t3_1jqnv3,http://www.reddit.com/r/bipolar/comments/1jqnv3/i_thought_this_open_letter_to_amanda_bynes_was/,

They're anxious, just as we once were, checking again and again against various websites. They know they fit the symptoms, but they don't want to know what the symptoms are. Those are easy. They want to know what it *feels* like to be bipolar. The every day, why-are-we-so-vulnerable-to-suicide feelings. So here it is. For me, at least. For the record, I struggle with bipolar 1, rapid cycling.

----------------

Somewhere, there is a kid stuck in adolescence wondering if life ever gets better, just like I used to. Everyone says it does, but I don't know anymore. I tried to die, I didn't, and I only feel better for intermittent periods. I feel so unsure of myself. The few friends I do make, I alienate due to self doubt. It's horrifying to look at your life, this lonely, flighty, guilt ridden life, and know that it's your fault and you're not going to get any better. That's what I'm beginning to realize now that I've left home. I can run from my problems, but I can't run from bipolar.

It's wonderful when you feel yourself being effortlessly pulled out of the sickening, nails-in-the-brain depression you've been stuck in for months. But it's horrible to realize this new found confidence isn't any inherent character trait. It's the disorder, and you aren't even sure who you are. Are you the charming, productive, outgoing person you are when manic? The anxious, lethargic, self doubting person you are when depressed? The absurd, melancholic, creative person when having a mixed episode? There's no sense of identity, and life feels like a string of bizarre, disconnected memories that you try desperately to escape and forget.

I'm just so tired. All the time, I'm tired. I barely sleep anymore and I feel like I'm always just trying to find some way to distract myself from thinking. My mind plays tricks on me and I just feel tired.

There's such a disconnect within myself. I am brave and terrified, intelligent and confused, kind and cruel. I don't ever know who I am, because it changes so effortlessly and absolutely. I have no personality and no real life. I make and lose friends easily. 

I'm lonely, and I've realized that this isn't going to change. We can pat each other on the back in this subreddit and give encouragement, but it feels so hollow. I don't draw any comfort in false reassurances. What makes me cry, what makes me feel accepted, is when we're honest about these feelings. I finally feel like I'm not crazy. 

Sometimes I feel so lonely that I cry and pull my hair out in clumps. I feel like the proper type of crazy you'd always understood as a child. The poster boy of mental illness. But when I read what people say here, everything is okay for just a little while. For just a little while, I am not alone. Other people feel as I feel. They see the world as I do. We're so far apart, and we'll never know each other, but you all have saved my life by letting me feel at least a little bit normal. I just have to get this all out there. I have to give back what I've gleaned from this sub, or I haven't learned anything at all.

We're different, sure. But we're together.

Within the first 24 hours, I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder and EDNOS (eating disorder not otherwise specified). Even though I’m only twenty right now, I don’t know if I’ll ever have a time worse than those seven days in hospital and the months leading up to the admission.

I wasn’t skinny enough to have full-blown anorexia, even though I was eating less than 600 calories a day. I’m lucky I didn’t come out with a depression diagnosis, because I only had a few extreme manic episodes. I lived a significant portion of my life depressed and angry, with bursts of what looked like a drug-induced high. I didn’t even try illegal drugs until after my release, which was a miracle unto itself.

I felt like a failure. I didn’t know what I was doing. I didn’t succeed in my anorexia, or I would have been diagnosed. I hadn’t had a manic episode in months. I couldn’t remember what it felt like to be happy, only that life was a worthless stretch of time that I couldn’t escape from.

I was put on some medication that my later doctor couldn’t believe was prescribed for me. It did nothing but exacerbate the disorder. I was smoking frequently, crying at least once a day, and alienated from most of my former friends, all of who knew about hospital. They didn’t bother to keep in touch. I was dealing with too much to put in the effort for them, and as a result, I had only one friend. Even he didn’t fully know where I was medically.

I later learned that admission to a mental institution for anything other than a traditional eating disorder is a scar you can never take off your record. A mental disorder is socially stigmatized and taboo. My time in hell was brushed off as “that time I was in hospital, but I don’t want to talk about it”. I phrase visits to my psychiatrist as “time with a specialist”.

It’s times like these that I wish I had cancer instead. At least then it would be real, and the emotional hell I’d be going through would have a justified cause, and I could talk about it and people would at least pretend to care, because it’s a real thing.

A mental illness, on the other hand? That’s something you never share. It’s the skeleton that always threatens to come dancing out of your closet at times you can’t afford it to. You can’t tell people things got so bad you checked yourself in for evaluation, just to make sure you were crazy.

People as a whole don’t seem to understand that mental illness is just as bad as physical illness. You can’t always control your behavior. You have to see doctors just as often. But what makes it worse is that you can’t tell anyone. You can’t pitifully say “I have diabetes” or “I’ve got lupus”. You have to suck it up and pretend like everything’s fine all the time, and the notion that people will find out is another worry you’ll never be rid of.

While I was in hell, I told my close group of four where I was and what was going on. It was impossibly hard, even though I loved them. I still love some of them. How do you tell someone that your cushy life isn’t working out? How do you ask someone to bring things like shampoo to the piece of hell you’re locked up in?

You’ve probably noticed I don’t treat the hospital I was in with a lot of respect. It’s because I don’t respect it as a medical institution. What kind of place doesn’t let patients in critical condition see a doctor every day? There’s a reason every one of us was in that place, and it wasn’t because we were all doing fine. It’s because someone cared enough to try and get us the help we so desperately needed. So why was there only one doctor? Why did he only see me three times in the seven days I was there? Why were there only two toilets for a hall of 30 people? Only three nurses, one of which didn’t even speak English? Why was I not talked to about any kind of long-term treatment plan?
I consider myself lucky that I got into the second best school in the US for my major. I had to tell every place I applied to that I’m damaged goods. I couldn’t say I won’t succumb to major depression again. I still eat less than 700 calories a day. And I can’t say for certain that any of the friends I might make are going to know about my conditions.

I run a blog, averageisaverage.blogspot.com, and both people I know and people I don’t know read it. Do you know how hard it is to write about your life when you have to leave out one of the biggest things about you? I can’t just say “I’m so hungry, but I’m already at 600 calories for the day so I can’t eat anything.” The time I had a five-hour absolute meltdown gets brushed off as “nothing really interesting happening”.

I probably shouldn’t be, and I haven’t told anyone this, but I’m off my medication. The eleven daily pills still sit in their little orange bottles, waiting for the day I’ll grow up and take them. I can’t. I just can’t. The feeling of pills being stuck in your throat is the worst, and the one’s I’m on always get stuck. But I’m off them because I can’t bear to be dependent on pills. I want to know that I’m mentally okay enough to crack it on my own.

But the part that gets me is that I don’t think I am. The five-hour ordeal and two-day aftermath happened after I stopped. I’m sobbing as I’m writing this. I don’t have the energy to do anything other than sleep and look at simple things on the internet. I’m angry with people a lot, and angry that I don’t have any friends. 

I want to be strong, and I want to tell people that it’s not the end of the world to have a mental disorder. At the same time, I would give almost anything to have cancer instead of what I’ve got.",,False,self,t5_2qnv4,False,,c0c0c0,True,t3_1i4ej1,http://www.reddit.com/r/bipolar/comments/1i4ej1/i_just_need_to_know_someone_has_read_this/,

But I'm aiming to help people who are going through what I am. I was diagnosed as bipolar last year and as having anxiety a long time before that.

Firstly, my age does not affect anything, ""You're only 18? It must be hormones"" No. Funnily enough they don't give medication or intense psychiatric treatment to hormonal people. You can't really ""grow out"" of a mental illness.

I hate when people say I use my illness as an excuse. ""You don't want to go out tonight? You're being boring"" No, I just don't want to face life right now. Being boring has got nothing to do with it. Or when I can't face college or basically anything. ""You just can't be bothered, you're being lazy."" It's not like that at all. People are just too close minded to see the full picture.

When people say I'm more fun when I have manic episodes. They might see it that way, but it really scares me. It's terrifying to have that feeling of not really being in control and doing random over the top things. But apparently that makes me more interesting. Apparently I'm more fun when I don't take my medicine. Well I'm sorry if my mental well being is in the way of your ""fun.""

Sorry for the rant. I hope people can relate in some way.

1366467399.0,33,self.bipolar,1cqp64,Hypomania: That Great Sweater You Just Have To Send Back,40,7,41,http://www.reddit.com/r/bipolar/comments/1cqp64/hypomania_that_great_sweater_you_just_have_to/,"Those of us who have battled Bipolar II long enough know the signs of hypomania. And since a hypomanic episode happens so rarely compared with depression, when one does occur, it feels like receiving a beautifully gift-wrapped present. We unwrap it with frenzied anticipation, knowing the gift comes with an expiration date. Just what we've hoped for, just what we've wanted, but it may not be exactly what we need, like a sweater ordered from a catalog that doesn't fit quite right. We love the looks and how it feels, but it just doesn't match the rest of our emotional wardrobe. The gift of hypomania, enjoyed while it lasts, ultimately must be returned.

For me, the gift of hypomania feels like electricity fluttering through me, like an endless tickle with a feather just below the surface of my skin. When hypomanic, I have no desire for sleep or food. My eyes are opened wider and my senses feel heightened. Remarkably jovial and talkative, talkative to the point of interrupting sometimes, I feel like I need to comment on everything. Those closest to me say they like me hypomanic, but they are more than ready for me to calm down. Hypomania creates a caricature of myself. Invincible. Bigger than life.

One benefit of hypomania for me is productivity. Once my boundless energy is bridled, I can tackle just about any project. At work, my desk is organized, papers are filed, and exciting new lessons are developed. I never slow down and neither do my students. For middle schoolers, a hypomanic teacher is quite a treat. I talk a mile a minute, cracking jokes and pacing about the room, and we bounce from one activity to the next. Not many papers get graded, and tangential thoughts may invade my lessons, but ultimately, my hypomania, in small doses, benefits my students. Back to School Parent Night, while hypomanic, is a bit dangerous, however. One year, while flying high, I gave a multimedia presentation to parents about my course. I hoped the buzz I was feeling translated to teacher enthusiasm rather than wild-eyed crazy. Luckily, there was no fall out from that evening. No parent complaints, but I realize now that there could have been.

At home, my productivity may take the form of organizing every closet in the house, or cleaning out all of the kitchen cabinets. My family finds this helpful yet annoying, since I see no reason why everyone can't unload all of their clothes from their dressers and get organized too. My hypomania once even inspired me to paint my office. Now that was a mistake. Not only did I choose a yellow the shade of an egg yolk, I painted with such unfocused energy and lack of precision that once completed, it looked as though the sun crashed into the corner of my house and splattered all over my office walls. Needless to say, I had to hire my ex-husband to come and repaint it. Talk about humiliating.

One of the most prominent symptoms of my hypomania is this incredible urge to create something and follow it through to completion to the exclusion of anything else. For example, I may sit at the piano for hours composing a song, and until I am satisfied that it's finished, I will not get up unless I am forced to by the demands of family or work. Even then, while begrudgingly meeting my commitments, I feel a magnetic force pulling me back to the piano. It takes all my strength to fight it. Confession: there have been days where I have gone to work and instead of going straight to my classroom to prepare for the day, I've snuck into the music room and spent my half hour prep time playing the piano before the music teacher arrives. Being creative becomes my primary focus. Then, on those same music mania days, I will return to the music room during my free period and see if the piano is available. Again, I'll play until I have to return to my own class.

Being hypomanic has its benefits but it certainly has its downsides too. The biggest negative hypomania brings is the dread of its inevitable end. We know it won't last forever, but we want it to. We want to feel that electric energy and invincibility just one day more. The dark days of depression glare us in the face too often. We don't want to look at them again. We are willing to risk just about anything to keep that hypomanic euphoria, even if our symptoms lead us to do dangerous or careless things like shop too much or drive distracted or worse. We crave that sense of elation so much we are willing to risk it. Nothing bad will happen to us, right? We are invincible!

But eventually, we know the gift of hypomania must be put back into the box and returned and our days must turn back to the darkness that is depression. We'll wait patiently for the next gift-wrapped package of hypomania, while flipping through the catalog and dreaming of that perfect sweater.

He started me off with a smaller dose of Seroquel, but after I told him about punching a hole in my bathroom wall during a fit of anger, he recommended I commit myself to a psych ward so he could observe me under a new, higher dose of medications. I complied, not realizing that once I was in it was in HIS power to decide when I left, not mine.

In only a week, I went from feeling shitty about my diagnoses to being absolutely terrified and depressed about my future with bipolar. Despite being functional and independent previously, I was treated like a child and surrounded by people much more severe than me. Me being only 18 at the time, most of the patients there, whether they had bipolar or something else, warned me that I would be like them one day. The nurses treated me like I was a drug addict (refusing to believe I wasn't ""addicted to marijuana"") and belittled me and laughed when they would find me crying alone in my room. One nurse even told me ""Look at you! You're crying like a child. Pull yourself together!"" When my psychiatrist visited me on the 2nd day and I asked him if I could leave, he shook his head at me and chided me for not referring to him as ""Doctor"".

I managed to get out in 5 days thanks to one nurse being extremely understanding and vouching for my stability, but I still don't understand how the fuck that kind of environment can be helpful for someone with a mental illness. I don't think I healed there, I simply acted stable to the best of my ability so I could get out ASAP; the new drugs ended up being way too much for me anyway, and I was put on a much smaller amount almost immediately after.

I would easily put that experience up there as one of the worst in my life. I understand that my psychiatrist wanted to stabilize me quickly to prevent any further damage to my brain, but I just thought it was such a fucked up way of dealing with it.

Has anyone else had a horrible experience like this? Maybe I just had a bad hospital, but its definitely prevented me from opening up more to my psychiatrist in fear that he will put me in the ward against my will. I know he doesn't have the power to keep me there, but he's made it clear before that if I go against his wishes he will drop me as a patient, and as he really is the best psychiatrist in my city, I don't have any other option.",,False,self,t5_2qnv4,False,,,True,t3_1cxc78,http://www.reddit.com/r/bipolar/comments/1cxc78/terrifying_experience_of_a_psych_ward/,

Even if you spent all day hiding from the world or blew off your responsibilities because you just couldn't deal with the stress, that was the best you could do with what you had in you at the time.

I am not arguing its possible use as a treatment for 'SOME' Bipolars in the future. If you are on this sub for any amount of time at all, you will read on how some drugs are the best thing an individual has been prescribed and for the next person its an absolute nightmare.  Even a post suggesting that someone thinks eating boiled bat poo helped, there will be some desperate individuals who will think about or possibly try it.

 No matter what the current reasearch states regarding positive results, these are done supervised by trained professionals under very controlled conditions and still have to go through large scale clinical studies.   Even before it is tried it has already been tested for other possible negative effects. With any new drug there are still dose, side effect and possible interaction issues with other meds. 

  There is also well monitored quality control from manufactures when making any product.  The person who made the MDMA probably isn't sure of the purity (dose) and the person giving it to you has no real idea at all what they might be handing out.  Knowing purity isn't even an option from some undergrad  chemist who read an on-line instruction and thought they might try their skills at making it.

 When it comes to your health taking a chance is not about the risk its whats at stake.  The chance that someone may completely bug out and do something dangerous is too high to take a chance.

  People making these posts are obviously not medically trained and if they were would not be blindly recommending someone try it. There is a reason medical training is so in depth and takes so long.

If you were foolish enough to try it and had a good time, please do not bother posting it here.  The fact you had a good first time doesn't mean you might the second or that someone else can do it and get the same result. The fact that someone might take it as advise and do something dangerous is too great.

 I have a background related to this type of subject. I keep up on current publications and my interest in MDMA as a possible treatment is a lot more than taking blind advise and then taking a questionable quality drug unsupervised by anyone than untrained friends.",,False,self,t5_2qnv4,False,,,True,t3_13g7wf,http://www.reddit.com/r/bipolar/comments/13g7wf/mdma_posts/,

I met someone! We met about a year ago and only recently started dating. On our first date, very early one, she said: ""There is something I need to tell you. I had a big break down about 6 months ago and am Bipolar"" to this I LIT UP, smiled, and shared a little bit of my own history. Her eyes sparkled and it was a magical moment.

We are still hanging out and taking things slowly and it is very special to finally connect with someone who totally gets it.

It's WONDERFUL to be with another bipolarite!

Anyways, I just wanted to share a little story about this to give a little light and hope to those who might have lost a little hope in finding a strong, deep connection due to this disorder.

You have all been a great help to me these past months as I try to come to grips with what it means to be bipolar, and I want to thank you for that. Your stories have helped me realise that I am not alone in my struggles, and the websites and information you reference provide me with solace, hope and motivation. My blurb: It's my 21st birthday, I was diagnosed back in November by my GP but have yet to seek a psych or therapy due to travel abroad, which has been extremely difficult at times but I'm so glad I managed to follow through with my plans. A life-changing and formative experience it has certainly been. I'm taking Quetiapin 25mg during my travel which is enough to curb the worst of it. I like discussing metaphysics and intelligent conversation in general.

Anywheel, I'd just like to say thank you and that I look forward to being an active part of the community. Never stop being awesome!

Stating that the 2 years of basic med school has taught her that my disorder will be inherited by my children there for continuing my curse. Also naming other disorders that she conveniently doesn't have and ignorantly declares 'unfit'. As you can tell she's incredibly ignorant, but is this at all true?

I just came by to share a story that helped me *today*. Since time is so relative (perhaps irrelevant) to the bipolar, this likely won't affect me tomorrow like it did when I heard it today. But maybe I can pass it on. Sometimes we learn the most from chance encounters. 

And children.

Today I was eating alone at Panera (pretty usual), and there was a table next to me with a mother, her young child, and a toddler. I'm a people-watcher by nature, and these three were really fascinating me.

Anyway, her mother was praising her two children, asking, ""How many sunshines do I have in my life?"" Of course, she was talking about her two children like the good mother she probably is. But, the girl responded, ""Three."" The mom wasn't following the math. And neither was I. Until the little girl pointed out that *the mother* was a sunshine in her own life (besides the two children). 

I thought this was brilliant. That you can be your own sunshine. I know it sounds quaint and like some seventies-induced Allen Ginsberg poem, but it's really profound. I would have never thought to answer the question that way. And today I learned something from a child.

(Of course, my depressive-thinking kicked in about the fact that I'll probably not have children b/c I'm so wary about passing this disorder to someone else, perhaps even in an extreme that I'm not even familiar with.)

Anyway, the message was clear: be good to yourself. I'm always wishing you all the best.

You guys are awesome and the best.,28,1,5,http://www.reddit.com/r/bipolar/comments/1bo9a3/thanks_a_million_to_this_sub_you_guys_are_awesome/,"So I came here desperately asking for advice about last month and tonnes of you gave me some insight and advice on how to help out my friend. Which is now my boyfriend. 

It was hard for him to admit that he is bipolar at first, he went through few days feeling despair and hopeless and refused to seek professional help. Up till today I cant make him do it, its his choice and I can only stand by his decision. I know a lot of you will tell me its not gonna work out well in the long term but I can only hope. Forcing him will only make it harder for him. I understand he is afraid and so am I, the only choice I have in hands is to learn more about this disease.

After discussing on methods, we decided that he should learn to speak out how he feels as much as he can manage. Its hard, he flips most of the time and accuse me with all kinds of words that sliced me to minced. Over two weeks I can see the progress, its going better and better and I can see how hard he is trying. For example when we were in argument and I'll usually give him some time to digest his own outbreak, he used to ignore me for a day or two but now he calls back within 1 hour time to apologize and ask how he can be better. 

I dont know if im doing right, but I took alot of our pictures put around his room. I told him to try to think of all the good moments we had, even when he is mad. Its never easy to him but Im trying whatever possible way before he have the courage to get help. It works well for him, very well!! he snap out of anger or depress mode once he realize hes out of norm and tell me he is sorry. He's afraid that I will leave because he knew it will be hell for me if my choice is to stand by him till we are old. I honestly cant give any promises but whoever out there that have a bipolar partner.. PLEASE DONT GIVE UP ON THEM. 

It was never their choice from the beginning to be entwined with this disease. I can't speak for all, but I realized, all he needs is a very understanding partner that are willing to understand his condition and look beyond his flaws. Love is never enough, patience and strong will is the only way to survive this. Believe me when I say, seeing how hard he strive to be better, makes EVERY pain i went through, worth it. I dont know about forever, I can just try my best for him, for us and hopefully he dont give up on himself. 

I thank this subreddit again, I would have given up if not for all the hopes and successful relationships I witness here. Thank you from the depth of my heart.

Anyways. In the two years I've been on a downward spiral. With the exception of my few days of hypomania, it was impossible to drag me out of bed, to even clean my room, do projects, or anything. I just gave up. I spent a lot of days sleeping and a lot of nights laying in bed. 

The other day I decided I was going to clean my room. So I did. The next day I invited my boyfriend over to watch movies, and I still kept my laundry going, while he vegged. I then made him dinner, cleaned up after dinner, switched my laundry etc. After he left, I tidied up, did my full bed time routine, and crawled into bed at a nice 11:30pm. 

And I started crying. That was the first feeling of normality I've had in two years. I was so happy that I was able to just keep doing what needed to be done, and not because I was forcing myself in a hypomanic episode. I didn't just curl up and say ""fuck it"". I just lived, and did it.

1) We tend to isolate ourselves from others.

Because we fuck up. Over and over and over. Usually in big ways that freak people out if we are around them long enough. Which in turn becomes just too damn painful to make socialization worthwhile.

2) When we fuck up, it's almost always during a manic or hypomanic or mixed state, which is inevitably followed by the slide into that deep, deep hole of depression.

And when we slide into that depression, it amplifies every. single. transgression. we've. ever. made.  
Perched on our shoulder, it whispers in our ears every single fucked up thing we've ever done to either ourselves or someone else. And, since we tend to fuck up more grandly and with more consistency than the general population, we have more to feel generally horrible about. And obsess about. Especially when we think ""Fuck, this *is not me! This is not what I do!* But, we did it, and there's no hiding from the fact. And because we know, *we know*, that no matter how great or how stable we may be feeling now, *we will fuck up again.* And, ultimately, that's the thing that is the scariest monster under our collective beds, no?

I have an illness that makes me do things that are inconsistent with my personality sometimes. I thought all I had to do was fight it with medicine and try to get by.

That simply won't do.

To hell with this illness. More importantly, to hell with my complacency about it. I cannot sit around waiting for my life to change for the better. Nobody, nothing in the world can change my life for the better. Except me.

I have to fight with everything I have. My life will not become better until I'm willing to bleed to make it happen. And I will tell you now, I am willing to bleed for it. I know this now. Nothing is going to stop me. No one can stand in my way; I am my only obstacle. 

So, to use the Christian metaphor, I am going to pick up my cross and carry it, endure it, and grow stronger. Because there is no other option. I have exhausted all other possibilities. The choice is to stay in the pit or climb out of it. 

Self-pity is worthless. Tonight I saw what comes from giving up. I got a good close look. I saw the horror, the pain, the wretchedness. I saw a woman - my own mother! - dead inside while her heart kept beating. No faith, no hope, no love, no purpose. Just self-pity. Self-hate. Resignation. *Poison* for blood, *poison* in her mind. And it gets into your skin like second-hand smoke.

I also saw what comes from endurance. My father, who lives his life like a real man, who carries his family on his back every single day. I saw hope, I saw faith, I saw love. No self-pity. No writhing in pain. Quiet acceptance. He stares his demons in the eye without fear while doing his work, because *that's what you do* if you want to make anything out of life. And despite all he carries every day, he *still enjoys life.*

Even as a child my brain knew it was bipolar. It understood the works of other bipolar people and collected them. I recognized like minded people - those who are 'emotionally action packed'! How soul crushing was the moment I acknowledged it. Bipolar is classified a mental illness. To own the term meant to own that I am mentally ill. It meant waking up to considering that 'my people' are the mentally ill people. No. No. This will not do, I said to myself. This doesn't feel right. How can such wonder and beauty come from a place of illness associated with stigma? The bipolar mind is a unique gift. And I have to medicate it away because it will not do. It is not healthy. This is the curse of bipolar. Two selves exist in one mind. The challenge is to never allow either of these selves to exist entirely, but to meld them and ask them to coexist in a healthy way. This inner cooperation, they say, is your true self. So, I must look in the mirror and tell myself that I am only able to be truly me if I take this medication every day. My medicated self. Well fine then world. I will compromise and medicate, but in exchange I ask that you stop associating cruel stigmatic words with mental illness and medication, for it is soul crushing. It is being bullied every day by an entire society. It will no longer do. This is my civil rights movement. Stop talking about us as this **disabled** stigma of mentall illness, start seeing us **Differently Able'd**, for that is what we are.

I find it  hard to believe that depression has had given us any advantage but I've tried anyway to make a list: 
Introspective - While depressed we manage to block out the world and it gives us time to examine our thoughts and feelings which we would may otherwise not have time for. I've found that during an episode I've had very different and interesting view on things like life, society, past events and the future.
Depressive realism - allows us to no longer see the world through positive illusions and gives us a more realistic view of reality. When the whole world was appeasing Hitler only the manic depressive Churchill knew he couldn't be reasoned with and prepared for war.
Empathy - Our experience of depression lets us understand a very common illness which effects 1/4 of the population. I've found that my experiences of depression have helped me built stronger relationships with people who have went through grief or depression and even people who have helped me through my depressions.
self-image - Going from the grandiose delusions of mania to the self critical hatred of depression allows us to built up a better picture how we really see ourself and how we relate to the rest of the world. Now when I'm feeling low about my appearance I just tell myself its just my perspective of things, even when i'm not depressed.

Overall I find mania and depression illuminates the whole human experience giving us a whole range of thoughts of emotions the world just could not perceive. Without this downside of depression we just wouldn't be able to experience this range.

Visual arts, performance, writing, music; in all the arts bipolar talent is common and sometimes exceptional. Patty Duke, Ernest Hemingway, Trent Reznor, Sylvia Plath, many more. The link between bipolar disorder and creativity is well-established, though further study is needed. One research finding: as many as 60% of people with bipolar disorders are writers. 

2 - Energy. Not sleeping for two or three days without feeling effects is even better than modafanil (Provigil). People take all sorts of stimulants attempting to experience similar energy; if you could bottle this symptom of mania and hypomania, you’d make a mint. 

3 - Exuberance. Kay Redfield Jamison, prominent psychiatrist who studies and has bipolar, wrote the book Exuberance: The Passion For Life in celebration of the passion and joy in mania and hypomania. “Exuberance,” Jamison says, “is an abounding, ebullient, effervescent emotion.” And it’s contagious. Bipolar disorder spreads happiness; think Mary Poppins. 

4 - Unlike Mary (well, we don’t know for sure), lust a.k.a. “hypersexuality” is also a prominent feature of hypomania. People with bipolar disorders tend to be dazzling, passionate and adventurous lovers. 

5 - Perspective on emotions. What goes up, must come down, and back up again. Viewing life and issues from both ends makes you more philosophical about the meaning of things. Would this matter when not depressed? Would that seem a good idea when stable? Emotions become illusory flavourings. 

6 - Proof of the biological basis of mental illness, especially this one but it disproves dualism in general. More scientific evidence and ongoing research plus personal anecdotes asserting internal causes and correlates of depression and hypo/mania (as well as some environmental interactions, it’s not totally reductionist) than you could ever hope to read. Hands down, no debate here, it’s physical. 

7 - Lots of bipolar celebrities. “Did you know so-and-so had bipolar disorder?” is an easy conversation starter, raising an eyebrow, implicitly comparing yourself to Marilyn Monroe, Florence Nightingale or Winston Churchill. 

8 - Depth of experience. You’ll not meet more experienced, well-travelled, multi-dimensional people. Exceptional and often unusual stories to share. Could be because people with bipolar disorders, so often adventurous, tend to be high-achievers and leaders with above average intelligence. 

9 - Courage. Tied in with bravado and gradiosity, at its most severe it can be dangerous risk-taking, but at its best it’s inspiring and heroic. 

10 - Depression. What’s good about depression, you ask? Light needs shadow, and the most profound understanding includes both. It illuminates the whole human experience.

Being Bi polar, whether you have Bi Polar 1, Bi Polar 2, or Cyclothymia, it can be awful. We have ups, where we can think straight, and we can't reason. We have downs, where the world is a horrid place. Some of us have hallucinations, some of us hear things. 

A lot of us have tried to run, with drugs, alcohol, sex and drugs, but honestly, none of it works.

We are unique, and we might feel alone most of our days, but we're not. Here in this subreddit, we have something rare, we have a safe place to talk, somewhere where people know how it feels, and won't judge what has been said, or what has been tried.  

Here we can feel accepted, because here we are, here we can feel love, because here we are loved. 

To start, I would like to say I am a new comer here, but I have already been contacted by a mod, and shown acceptance, and just through that action alone, I can see how we can all change our lives.

So encourage everyone, show some love, just comment and say stay strong, or check in on a fellow. What if we are all some people have? 

We're all walking this journey, lets not walk it alone.

Your the reason why people think my disease is a joke.,25,0,17,http://www.reddit.com/r/bipolar/comments/17qhp5/another_movie_to_give_more_fuel_to_those_who/,"The creators of the film Side Effects call it a psychological thriller with a backdrop that criticizes the ""pharmaceutical industry and the pills it promotes to treat depression.""

Although there is much to debate about the pharmaceutical company in itself, Hollywood consistently feeds into the stereotype by giving notion to all the bad things about psychology.  In the article, the creators of the film express their concern about the ""reality of this disease.""   They mention that treatment helps people, and that there is a big difference between one who is sad and another who is truly depressed.  The reality is that the positive perspective of psychology and medication will not be revealed in this film.  Why?  Because its simply not good film making.  There's no drama in watching someone go to doctor appointments and taking a dozen different pills while gradually getting better over the next 6 months.  There's drama in death, pain, and suicide.  And that's what this film will feature.

I can already see the dumb ass stereotypical Hollywood rehashing the same stupid falsities about psychology I see all the time.  The psychologist curing a patient by dissecting their dreams, the mental hospital with a deranged nurse, oh and this one is always fun:  The random person that cures that mute mental patient because they played them a song from childhood.  I really hope this movie isn't one where the protagonist realizes he didn't need the medication after all.  Happiness was inside him all along!  All he needed to do was follow his dreams!  

Good god.

What total bullshit.  I'm sick and tired of it.  I'm not demanding Hollywood changes the way it looks at this disease.  I can't do that.  Its up to the story tellers.  I seriously doubt they'd be able to make an entertaining movie about the real ""side effects"" of depression.  Someone so depressed, they can't even get up from their bed to take a dump.

How many more have to die. How many more suicides? How many more shootings? How many more homeless and drug addicts do we need on the street before enough is enough. I can't stand it.

At the dinner table at Thanksgiving it's perfectly fine to talk about someone's struggles with cancer or diabetes, but the minute someone brings up their mental illness it gets awkward and weird because they shouldn't talk about it.

What other serious condition illness (besides HIV/AIDS) do you have to keep quiet about?  What other illness is the person who has is to blame. None.  And I say that's fucked up.  I'm not to blame.

We're invisible in the media.  The only TV show I've seen with a main character being treated for mental illness is Homeland and that's not even on regular cable.

The only time we make the media is when one of us doesn't get the help they need and kills themselves or a lot of people or both.  But at that point, they are dehumanized to the point where only a monster exists, not longer a human being who thinks and feels too.  A person, who with maybe the right combination of therapy and meds might not be dead or in jail and who might still be remembered as a person (i.e. most recently Adam Lanza and James Holmes).  

You might be thinking the American healthcare system is to blame, well yes it is in many ways, but before anything happens, the dialogue has to change.  How do you think marijuana was legalized in 2 states--the dialogue changed.

So let's start talking.  I'm bipolar, it sucks, but I'm fucking proud.  

And you should be to because who else has to take personal responsibility for a serious (often deadly) health condition?

I could tell a slight difference with a couple of them (the people around me claimed they did more for me than I actually noticed), but the side effects were all unbearable for me. I was constantly restless, couldn't achieve orgasm, couldn't focus... the list goes on.

About 3 years ago I started smoking pot, though. When I'm high, I feel like I become completely rational. It's almost like my mind slows down a little; the constant storm of thoughts turns into a light rainfall. The second I take a hit, my moods are less intense, and I can actually step back and see what triggers them. Instead of experiencing my normal impulsive, overstimulated mania, I become extremely productive and can hear even more possibilites in my music. The downs become bearable, and I cry a lot less. 

Unfortunately I don't live in a state that issues medical marijuana cards, but I'm moving west this summer, and I know I'll qualify for one. I look forward to the day!

I bought it right after my first major meltdown a few years ago.  I'd drive for hours and hours going nowhere in particular to clear my head.


Last night I swung into a deep depression and needed someone to talk to, someone to call, someone to visit with, someone to sit with me.  I couldn't think of a soul in the world.  I've cut ties with everyone that i'd ever considered a friend (they weren't my friend, I was their friend).  I'm too anxious to leave the house to meet anyone.  My family worries too much about me as it is, so I can't let out any darkness to them.  I got in my car, filled the tank, and drove 130 miles, at midnight, with work bright and early today.


During that drive I realized that no matter how bad I feel, no matter how badly people hurt me, my car has always been the one sitting there, eager to go on an adventure. Always been there to console me.  It's my best and only true friend.  Statistically we'll die together.  I [cranked the stereo](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hh8YuLGHgfI) and bawled.  I don't cry, ever, so this was rare.  I couldn't stop.  It was a mix of being stupidly sentimental for an object, a large amount of self pity, and an intense feeling of being lost and alone.


In my last counseling session I decided that I hate where I am, and I hate where I'm going, but I like the trip in between.

I told him about my bipolar disorder and the crazy things I thought and sometimes did, and he reciprocated with stories of his own issues.  It turned him on by how fucked up I am.  The fact that I sometimes hallucinate was even more arousing for him; it was like he was mesmerized by my psychosis.  

I went off my meds a couple months after I met him and slowly spiraled into almost total madness.  Talking to him made it even worse because I began to see the instability as an erotic thing, and it became something I was proud of.  He loved me, he said, not despite of it but because of it.  He was the first man I've ever been in love with, and it almost destroyed me because of how obsessive and emotional it made me.

Last December, however, I had a bit of a mental breakdown in front of him: a mixed episode exacerbated by alcohol. He'd never seen my actual ""craziness,"" just heard me talk about it.  Since then I haven't heard from him.  When I was hospitalized a couple weeks ago for another episode, no one knew where I was and a bunch of my friends contacted him because they thought he would know. When I got out of the hospital, I texted him apologizing for all the hassle but he never answered.

I don't think I'll ever hear from him again.  It's like he fell in love with the idea of my mental instability, but once he saw it in real life, it scared him off.  I guess it just hurts that he cared more about the illness than about me personally.

I normally pay $25 for my 15 400mg pills (the clinic I go to has some federal benefits + other goodies for the attached Walgreens).

I go to refill, and they didn't have the Seroquel available anymore for $26 anymore. It was now $275 WITH the prescription discount club! After running to the bathroom to cry (This was the first bipolar med that has worked for more than a week). Then something amazing happened.

Now, this Walgreens isn't as busy as a regular one, it's mostly reserved for people who go to the attached clinic. They mostly do mail order (they will mail all your meds for free anywhere in the US), While they are in a very progressive area (Hell they are attached to one of the largest LGBT health centers in the US!), but I figured they would be less lenient than a bigger store..

I Came back from the bathroom and the manager had my meds waiting for me... for $26. She gave me the meds that cost the $275 for 1/10th of the price. I have no insurance and I have very little money (wasn't able to work because of being unstable), and this was amazing.

That song is burned into my heart and, for a first play-through, I hit the notes almost instinctively. 

I can't show my instructor any progress for the piano lesson I have later today, but by damn I finally did something!

Since we all seem to have pretty much the same questions about all this, I wanted to make one big post. I went to the Cleveland Clinic today for a second opinion and some more thorough testing. Since I have the benefit of really good insurance, and one of the world's best hospitals in my backyard, I feel that I should share what I learned. (And also consolidate what I've learned so far in this process.)

**Ideal diagnosis process** (assuming you weren't hospitalized, of course)

1. ""Help, I think I'm bipolar.""'

2. Go to primary care physician and get tested for physical problems. (Do not ask for psych meds, this is the wrong doctor for that.)

3. Fix whatever comes up on those tests. Retest to confirm success.

4. If that's not sufficient, proceed to psychologist. (Not psychiatrist. They're different.)

5. If psychologist says ""bipolar"", proceed to a different psychologist. Don't mention the diagnosis, just explain your symptoms again. (Think of what happens when someone tells you not to think of a pink elephant. Don't ask the psych to not think of you as bipolar.)

6. If second opinion is also bipolar, find psychiatrist.

7. Find good psychologist and seek treatment while continuing to see psychiatrist.

8. Chart your moods daily. Give charts to psychologist and psychiatrist regularly.

9. Get support. 

10. Go forth and be happy :)

**""I want a natural cure"" / ""I'm not happy with my treatment"" process:**

1. Keep taking your meds. Don't taper yourself. Withdrawal is a bitch, and you can die.

2. Go to a general practitioner and get tests for physical problems.

3. Address physical problems. Retest to confirm success.

4. Get a good psychologist if you don't have one. (Not a psychiatrist. They're different.)

5. Chart your moods daily. Give charts to psychologist and psychiatrist regularly.

6. When you're more stable, tell the psychiatrist that you want to try reducing your meds.

7. Get support. 

8. Go forth and be happy :)

Now for things that can look like bipolar but arent.

**Antidepressants - Yes, that includes the herbal ones**
Did you have a manic episode? Did you start taking antidepressants recently? Are you on antidepressants alone? Antidepressants can cause manic episodes in people who aren't bipolar. They can also trigger bipolar disorder in formerly healthy people, and make mood cycles both more intense and more frequent in people who are bipolar. These problems may or may not go away when you quit taking them. Talk to whoever prescribed them and ask if you really need to be on them. If you started popping herbal supplements on your own and started having problems, stop taking them and see if the mania goes away.

**Physical problems that can look like bipolar:**

I'm still new to this and I feel like I've been in shock for 3 months.


Backstory: we've been together for 8 years (since we were 18 and 20) and I can't stress the fact we had a beautiful relationship enough. It was like out of the movies... the first day we hit it off, and a few days after, we both admitted we could see ourselves falling in love with the other. Every single year we loved each other more, and until everything happened recently, our love for each other grew on a daily basis. The longest we went without talking once during the day in our eight years was two days, and it was sad for both of us. I think we had four days total that we didn't talk at least once the whole time. We were just perfect for each other and we were best friends. When we did bicker, we'd argue for five minutes and gush for ten minutes about how good we are at solving our problems. We lived together off and on, but never had an apartment together until last October.


Her backstory: she has one sister. Her father passed away when she was around 5 or 6, and her mother suffered severe anxiety issues for a year before committing suicide last summer. She took that hard for a while but bounced back and stayed busy with work. She got a car she wanted to trade in, was up for a big promotion at work, and was preparing her moms house/childhood home for sale. She had a lot on her plate this last year and I was there for her through everything.


So here's where it started. It was late March when she had started getting less sleep. I had finally pulled the trigger and ordered the engagement ring (that she picked... I'm unoriginal but she loved that ring) online, and I planned on asking her to marry me on our anniversary. She knew it was coming and we were giddy thinking about having our wedding. She was getting home late and leaving early so we only had a few hours with each other at night, which isn't too uncommon sometimes.


I didn't notice any weird behavior until mid-week, when she acted very strange to me about everything. She was a bit amped up. Lately, she had been planning all sorts of things (going to France, starting a cleaning product company, writing a book, etc.) which I attributed to just brainstorming (and she has come across some money recently). After we talked and I thought she was okay, she resumed writing her book. She casually mentioned her sister wanted to talk to me. I called her right away, and her sister pretty much told me exactly the way my girlfriend was acting the previous day. That's when I realized something was wrong. Bipolar disorder and mental illness runs strong in her family, so I knew it was a possible first manic attack right then.


We were up for 80 hours. She wouldn't sleep and slowly became delusional. I could type a book with the things that went on. The police were called three times and mental health experts were helpless until the final day when she popped out of bed saying the building was coming down. Until that point she didn't want to go to the hospital. That time she came with.


They discharged her after 2 days. She gets out, seems normal for about 8 hours and then flips out. She was extremely agitated with me when I asked her where she hid my computer adapter (wireless usb keyboard and mouse). I was the bad guy the whole time before that for having to follow doctors orders and trying to keep her from burning bridges/spending money/driving. That really ticked her off, and she started yelling at me and throwing my stuff at me. Called the mental health services and they took her to the hospital whether she wanted to or not (she cooperated).


After she got out, she wasn't mad, just constantly agitated. The experts said to give her some space this time and let her ride it out. She called, agitated, and told me she's moving my things around and I can come get them whenever. Again, agitated but not mad or anything. Like she was frustrated with something else but handling our relationship problems fine. I complied, went and got my stuff (in fear that she might destroy something) and put it in storage. We stayed in touch but she grew more and more agitated with everything over the course of that week.


Finally, she texted me, saying she loved me and missed me, and that she was sad because she didn't know ""what was going on"". She asked me to come the next day at 4pm. The next day, an hour before I'm supposed to be there, she texts me, saying the people at the restaurant down the street stole her credit cards and she's going to leave without paying. Cops called, no charges but they took her back to the hospital a third time.


They said they would probably take it to a judge (?) on the third time to maybe get her long-term care, but they let her out right away again. She got home and I gave her a few days.


I went over there since I hadn't heard from her in a few days. I walked in and I see a guitar and a skateboard. I entered the bedroom, and she is with another man in our bed, and they're both naked. She was surprised but starting to cry/get really sad. I stayed calm and collected and even introduced myself to this guy. I knew hypersexuality (or whatever it's called?) might come into play. I asked him if he knew she was in and out of the hospital and that we were together. He said yes. I saw red. She asked for a minute of privacy and I went to the living room and smashed his guitar. He yells ""HEY"" from the bedroom, scrambles, and comes out IN A PAIR OF MY DIRTY BOXERS I LEFT BEHIND and starts yelling at me. We exchange words and he literally forces me out of my apartment. I just leave. The last time I saw her was when a police officer escorted me back over there to get my electronics. She was still manic and he was still there.


She then flew to New York with this guy (we live on the west coast) and spent around $20k. We tracked her as long as we could online but she started using cards her sister and I didn't have access to. The dude ended up god knows where (probably flew back) and my girlfriend ended up in North Dakota with a NEW guy. This guy is cool though and I got in touch with him via Facebook through her account.


She told him (and has been telling people) that I was physically and emotionally abusive to her. I'm not entirely sure how that manifested itself. I never raised my voice at her when she was manic and I always kept my cool. I guess I can attribute it to being a delusion but it still hurts really bad to have that accused. I can't even tell you. It took some convincing, but he finally believed me. She spent another $10k along the way and she finally has a bad delusional night and he sees it for the first time head on. It freaks him out and he encourages her to fly out on that Wednesday.


That Tuesday, she breaks into the courthouse there (after hours) to try and 'file protection orders' against me before coming back home. Not sure what that means. She gets arrested, spends a bunch of days in jail and gets transferred to a hospital there. And here we are.


I've been staying away from home but I'm going back since it sounds like she won't be home for a bit. I gotta put that apartment back together and I simply can't stay away from home any longer. I don't know what to do because it has been so long and she's saying these terrible things about me that aren't true. I'm getting spotty updates about it via text from this new guy but I'll have the latest soon. It's been really really really hard.


I need some advice and maybe someone could tell me if this MIGHT be something more serious. I also would appreciate any advice as to how I should handle all of this. It has been the worst thing I've ever gone through. I feel so bad for her but I'm also not doing great myself, so it's a struggle.

1365619339.0,23,self.bipolar,1c2vse,Abusive therapist,25,2,9,http://www.reddit.com/r/bipolar/comments/1c2vse/abusive_therapist/,"I want to share my story, partly because I would like the opportunity to talk about it and partly because I hope that it might help someone else avoid a similar situation. 

I was having a lot of problems dealing with my emotions from day to day. It was severely affecting my ability to work because I would get so scared or angry or sad about something that I would be so upset for 3 or 4 hours and unable to calm down and concentrate on anything. I could only put in my full concentration about half of the time (and even for part of that time I was only half focusing). I didn't have a lot of money but I figured this was something worth spending money on since it was so severely affecting my ability to work and because me being able to work more and work better/harder would be a huge benefit to me. So I decided to spend the money and see a counsellor who specialized in helping people deal with their emotions. 

Anyway the long and short of it was that he started flirting with me (the idea that a therapist would do this was just so far out of left field for me that I did not recognize it as flirting for a long time). And it calmed me down immensely emotionally of course so I thought that therapy was working! I thought that therapy was working because he was an expert (he was a prof at a local university and had worked with the leading person in the field) and was incredibly good! He wanted me to call him several times in the week and he would talk to me for fifteen or twenty minutes. He would also only be helpful to me if I was very flirtatious with him too (again it was so far out of left field to me that a therapist would do this that I did not realize he wanted me to flirt with him). 

The whole premise of the therapy got changed from helping me to deal with my emotions/concentrate to helping me work on relationships with people (he implied that this was the reason that I could not concentrate).

Something felt uncomfortable but when I mentioned this to a couple of friends of mine they encouraged me to stay and keeping talking to him. He was also a prof at a university near here and they were a bit overawed by that fact and him having a PhD too (rolls eyes). 

Because I had no idea that he was flirting with me and the only time he was being responsive to me was when I was flirting back with him and because I thought that we were working on relationships, I started to flirt with EVERYONE, I thought I was being friendly or having better social skills. I don't know how I could be so blind about this. :(

The long and short of this is that I started being really inappropriate with a lot of people professionally. I wanted social support from them (sometimes people who were not meant to give me that) and I would flirt with them in order to get it. I did not realize I was flirting, I thought I was just being cool and appropriate. I eventually stopped seeing him and began to see other therapists, however the other therapists didn't flirt with me and so I felt that they weren't as empathetic and the ""fit"" felt nothing near the way the ""fit"" with him felt, obviously because there was a huge sexual element to the fit with him that made me feel very good and very ""understood"" and ""supported"". I just could not connect with any counsellor because the way they made me feel was so ""bad"" (in comparison to him) and now I was comparing all counsellors to him. They wanted me to calm down and not flirt and by then I thought that that was the way to be. 

I needed someone to take me aside and EXPLICITLY explain to me that what was going on with him was sexual in nature and of course it felt GREAT and would be the BEST THING EVER at helping me calm down because there was a sexual element to it and sex is a huge and powerful thing. I needed it pointed out that OF COURSE no other non-abusive relationship with a counsellor was ever going to measure up or make me feel quite as great and UNDERSTOOD and as CARED FOR as he had made me feel. 

Everyone who tried to disapprove of the way I was acting, I thought that they just HATED/DIDN'T UNDERSTAND my personality :( Basically I did not trust other people because they didn't make me feel as CARED FOR and UNDERSTOOD as he did, so thought that they just didn't understand me and so I couldn't quite believe them or trust their advice in the same way. I felt that they just didn't get me so they didn't understand.

At the moment everything is a huge mess, I've embarrassed myself so much professionally :( I was flirting with everyone :( Some of my professors flirted back and I'm not sure how much of this was inadvertent/automatic/appropriate/inappropriate. The whole time this was happening I was quite uncomfortable and was having PTSD symptoms at the same time. It's upsetting because I feel horrible that by my flirtatiousness I encouraged some of the inappropriate behaviour. I wanted people to flirt with me (even though I didn't realize that that was what I wanted at all!, I was horrified to realize that I was doing this last week) because I wanted that sense of being cared for/calm. I was *trying* to get people to flirt with me, although I did NOT understand it as trying to get people to FLIRT with me :( I thought that I just wanted them to be super nice to me. I don't know how I could be so oblivious. I am almost wondering if I have a touch of Aspergers now that I did not recognize my behaviour as flirting, especially given people's responses. I am horrified that I was so inappropriate with people. I want to apologize to everyone that this happened with, but I feel like it would be embarrassing or make the situation worse to say, ""I was flirting with you and I'm so sorry, I didn't realize what I was doing.""

I don't think that anyone will ever want to work with me or have me work for them. The counsellor got me to not talk to my parents/family, so that relationship is in a mess, although it also wasn't great to begin with (and there were many abusive elements to that relationship too).

[explanation],24,2,5,http://www.reddit.com/r/bipolar/comments/15udun/being_bipolar_and_taking_the_myersbriggs/,"Link to original thread [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/bipolar/comments/15qlre/being_bipolar_and_taking_the_myersbriggs/). Thanks to kate_dane for bringing up a really interesting question.

I have no idea why I didn't think of this when I originally saw this post. And because I'm afraid that commenting in the original post (b/c it's already old by reddit standards) will go unread when so many of you will probably find this information helpful to understanding yourselves, I decided to create a new post. 

Anyway, there's a really, really interesting section in Robert Corrington's *Riding the Windhorse: Manic-Depressive Disorder and the Quest for Wholeness* that explains the psychological types in relationship to bipolar disorder (i.e., what happens when you become manic). If anyone really wants to read it, reply here or PM me and I'll scan it for you. It'd be pretty bloody long to type it all out. Anyway, here's the gist of it: ""No matter what the individual may privilege in terms of introversion or extraversion, the mood swings characteristic of manic-depressive disorder have their own logic. I would reconstruct Jung's perspective in the following way: in manic-depressive disorder, mania must be extraverted, regardless of the individual's dominant or inferior attitude, while depression must be introverted, regardless of the individual's dominant or inferior attitude. However, when it comes to the four functions, I think that the model holds. If my conscious and dominant attitude is feeling, then the violent onrush of the unconscious will propel me into my inferior function, in this case, thinking. The disorder overrides the attitudinal structures, imposing extraversion on mania and introversion on depression. Yet it seems to work *with* the function types by the process Jung referred to as *enantiodromia* (the rapid conversion of something into its opposite). Hence, an extravert will remain an extravert in mania, while an introvert will become an extravert. An intuiter will become a sensor, while a thinker will become a feeler, etc. The introversion of depression may work with the auxiliary function, but this is less clear.""

So, in short, say that when I am stable, I am INFJ. When depressed, I will still be INFJ. As the last sentence notes, this is probably the case (with me it is definitely the case), but for some it may work differently. It's unclear. Anyway, when in mania, something pretty spectacular happens: I become ESTP. If you consider all the different types and the ways in which bipolars inhabit multiple types, it really shows why this disorder is so different for us all. So, say for example that I am ESTP while stable: I am ISTP (maybe, but definitely introverted) while depressed, and ENFJ while manic. I mean, this is fascinating. Those with bipolar disorder can really be two (or three) different ""types"" of people.

tl;dr The OP (kate_dane) is right. If you want to take the personality type test and are unsure, try to answer from the perspective that your mood is stable, if possible.

I had plenty of mental health issues before them but this is when I started losing grip on reality and enter into one of the darkest places I have ever known. Then in March 2012 I got a diagnosis of Bipolar disorder and it shattered my life. I can't even count how many times I planned on killing myself and was hospitalized twice, once for a suicide attempt. I was kicked out my mom's house, moved in with a friend was only allowed a month there, then moved to be a nanny, back to my mom's and now moved go my dad's as of yesterday. I lost my job because they found out I was bipolar and they demoted but I found a way better job that I love.

Been one crazy fucked up year but I survived and a lot has to do with this community being here to support me and encouraging me. So thanks guys!

1357767006.0,21,self.bipolar,169sxl,For those of you that have been in a psych ward have you ever had a good experience?,23,2,45,http://www.reddit.com/r/bipolar/comments/169sxl/for_those_of_you_that_have_been_in_a_psych_ward/,"I have been in the ward three times in just under two years. In feb of 2011 I was sent to a state facility with a judicial admission (a judge sends you there against your will).

The unit I was sent to is 50 miles from where I lived, and it was horrible. If you have ever seen one flew over the coo coos nest it's pretty close. I couldn't eat the food because it made me sick, I had several people threaten to rape me ( this is why you don't put a m2f transsexual in the male ward ) and they never listened to anything I had to say. I don't have health insurance. They put me on abilify when it was brand new. That's an $800 a month med. (72hour suicide watch at the hospital + 72 hours at the ward before i signed myself out) 

the psych they set me up with was the same one who I saw as a teen (she put me on Prozac originally which caused my first suicide attempt). She then drugged me to the point I couldn't get out of bed. I developed a fear of doctors at that point (I was on 15mg abilify, 200mg lamictial, 100mg trazodone, 90mg propranolol, and 600mg of seroquel. ) 

I eventually told her to go fuck herself and then went without meds for about 6 months when my roommate ( a doctor) had me committed on her orders. 

I was at a nice ward this time (UIC) and it was a totally different experience. I was placed in the female ward, the staff was kind and respectful ( one nurse had a problem using the correct pronouns but the rest of the staff fixed it quickly) 

The drs there listened to the rule that it had to be cheap and not totally zonk me out. I was placed on 150mg of Wellbutrin xr and 25mg of lamictial. 

I'm not a very social person in the best of times, but I started talking to this girl Molly. She has a severe problem with self injury and something else (it escapes me now). She was very nice and a lot of fun to talk to. I later found out that she lived in a group home. I spent 24 hours in the ER and a week on the unit. 


I stayed med compliant until the combo I was put on was making me suicidal again (and I was developing a severe anger problem, I blew up on my roommates daughter which was part of the reason she disappeared one day. (She now lives in Canada and we are talking again)

I managed to avoid the hospital again until August 2012 where I checked myself in again and pleaded to go back to UIC. The head dr in the ER made up a phony letter saying the state one they were going to send me to refused to administer my hormones and that it was a no go and I was at UIC again. 


Now, being Locked in a unit with no real privacy or Internet access sucks, but I actually had fun the last time I was there. They put me on 2mg (I think. The bottle is around here somewhere) of zyprexa and I actually felt stable for once. I quickly made friends with four of the people who were there. Two were my age and the other two were older. We talked all day and had a blast ( if it is possible there). 

Since I had been there before the nurses all remembered me, and I could practically get away with anything. Normally you'd have to ask to get something out of the fridge but they told me to have at it. I was allowed to use my MP3 player along with one of the nurses pair of beats headphones. 

i was allowed to talk to the nurses as much as I'd like (they tried not to keep too long of conversations with the other patients. (some of them taught me some very valuable life skills, and showed me that there are very open minded people who are still very religious. The way they treated me solidified my choice of getting into psychology to teach and to become a therapist (or work as a nurse on a ward). I was allows to talk to the nurses after lights out if my neighbor was keeping me up (it happened about half the time i was there. ) I asked one of the nurses if he had ever heard what happened to Molly and he told me that she had swallowed some glass and had died (he at least waited until I was released to tell me that).  I was sent home after 5 days (my group of friends all left the same or next day as well). 

The one thing I learned from that trip is that Haldol is nasty and to never take it (apparently the resident I had got it backwards when she said the Ativan was for sleep (I got yelled at for requesting it. Then apologized to when they saw it in my chart ). I was still loopy and was slurring my speech the morning after I took the Haldol. 

I am friends on Facebook with the youngest girl I talked to on my last trip and still text with another every once in a while. 

The zyprexa worked for a few weeks but then I became depressed and I had managed to gain 20lb in two weeks so it was replaced with depakote. That did nothing except make me suicidal. 

I am now on Seroquel (100mg ir a day) and everything works great. The hospital set me up with a psych and therapist at the same clinic where I see my doctor. They are all very supportive and have renewed my faith in the mental health facility. Unfortunately my psych left the clinic this month  but as long as I remain stable I can just get refills from my doc (I have a year and a half with of refills though). 

Tl;Dr: my experiences in psych wards  


Anyone else have any positive experiences ?

1335353549.0,19,self.bipolar,srly1,Top Ten Terrific Things About Bipolar Disorder - (repost),24,5,27,http://www.reddit.com/r/bipolar/comments/srly1/top_ten_terrific_things_about_bipolar_disorder/,"1 - Creativity. Visual arts, performance, writing, music; in all the arts bipolar talent is common and sometimes exceptional. Patty Duke, Ernest Hemingway, Trent Reznor, Sylvia Plath, many more. The link between bipolar disorder and creativity is well-established, though further study is needed. One research finding: as many as 60% of people with bipolar disorders are writers.

2 - Energy. Not sleeping for two or three days without feeling effects is even better than modafanil (Provigil). People take all sorts of stimulants attempting to experience similar energy; if you could bottle this symptom of mania and hypomania, you’d make a mint.

3 - Exuberance. Kay Redfield Jamison, prominent psychiatrist who studies and has bipolar, wrote the book Exuberance: The Passion For Life in celebration of the passion and joy in mania and hypomania. “Exuberance,” Jamison says, “is an abounding, ebullient, effervescent emotion.” And it’s contagious. Bipolar disorder spreads happiness; think Mary Poppins.

4 - Unlike Mary (well, we don’t know for sure), lust a.k.a. “hypersexuality” is also a prominent feature of hypomania. People with bipolar disorders tend to be dazzling, passionate and adventurous lovers.

5 - Perspective on emotions. What goes up, must come down, and back up again. Viewing life and issues from both ends makes you more philosophical about the meaning of things. Would this matter when not depressed? Would that seem a good idea when stable? Emotions become illusory flavourings.

6 - Proof of the biological basis of mental illness, especially this one but it disproves dualism in general. More scientific evidence and ongoing research plus personal anecdotes asserting internal causes and correlates of depression and hypo/mania (as well as some environmental interactions, it’s not totally reductionist) than you could ever hope to read. Hands down, no debate here, it’s physical.

7 - Lots of bipolar celebrities. “Did you know so-and-so had bipolar disorder?” is an easy conversation starter, raising an eyebrow, implicitly comparing yourself to Marilyn Monroe, Florence Nightingale or Winston Churchill.

8 - Depth of experience. You’ll not meet more experienced, well-travelled, multi-dimensional people. Exceptional and often unusual stories to share. Could be because people with bipolar disorders, so often adventurous, tend to be high-achievers and leaders with above average intelligence.

9 - Courage. Tied in with bravado and gradiosity, at its most severe it can be dangerous risk-taking, but at its best it’s inspiring and heroic.

10 - Depression. What’s good about depression, you ask? Light needs shadow, and the most profound understanding includes both. It illuminates the whole human experience.",,False,self,t5_2qnv4,False,,red,True,t3_srly1,http://www.reddit.com/r/bipolar/comments/srly1/top_ten_terrific_things_about_bipolar_disorder/,moderator

It was the holiday season and the cold dark days mixed with mounds of work to do, just dragged my motivation to the gutter. Stuck in my room, not washing or eating. A few days passed and I discovered r/bipolarreddit . Blissfully unaware of the type of subscribers they had, I submitted a post. Desperation. I needed something, someone, anything, anyone. Downvote, downvote, nasty message, nasty comment, downvote. Needless to say.. the post in search of help was not well received. 

That, that moment of realization created a spark in me (you all know the manic one lol). This spark ignited the fire which became /r/bipolar.

I wanted to create somewhere safe, happy, helpful and well... fun! With a little over 200 followers, I took modship of a deserted sub and began the struggle to edit, market, moderate and generally create this subreddit. It was not easy and I gained a lot of trolls which one by one I exterminated and the battle went on. Funny pictures, helpful links, informative discussions, beautifully kind subscribers and a little bit of cute editing all made this sub rapidly grow. 

After just a little over a month we won Subreddit of the Day Feb 20th 2012!!! That, was a very proud moment. And one that the people who helped make it happen should be very proud of too.

And now, a year on we have 3,170 truly inspiring individuals, not forgetting the wondrous and delightfully exquisite Moderators that keep us safe and joyful. A rough increase of 1,500% in subscribers in just a year is quite a feat, one that I will never forget. 

I will always remember the people I spoke to along the way this past year, people that helped me when I, the helper, needed a warm hand. I even made friends, some of which I lost because of my or their bipolar traits, but we live and learn. I even flew to Chicago to meet up with one of our best, but I screwed that up and was way out of my depth :( although enjoyed my time there with said person immensely! :) 

So, I guess this is a thank you. Thank you for making this subreddit what it is today, after all it would not be here without you... Here's to many more years of continued to support and warmth in this fantastic environment.

I'm curious as to what results other bipolar people have gotten. The last time I took it (just now) I got INTJ. But it has changed pretty much every time I take it, sometimes quite drastically.

It was quite lovely, only about ten of our closest friends, and a few new ones.

As the party went along, we started talking about different things. Somehow, while two of my friends on either side of me were talking to me about pokemon, I overheard a good friend of mine talking to one of my newer friends about bipolar disorder. I decided to listen in at first and hear what they were saying. My good friend (whom I'll call ""Sharon"") was talking to my new friend (""Sadie"") about an experience she'd had with a girl in highschool who had bipolar disorder. She was talking about how the girl had pulled a knife on someone and was ""going berzerk""....and people with bipolar disorder ""scare the shit"" out of her. My new friend was speaking in agreement about how frigthening people with the disorder are, how unpredictable and terrifying they are... and that's when I knew I had to speak up. 

Keep in mind that Sharon is one of my good friends. She's getting a tattoo with five of her bests on her upper back, represented by their favorite animals. I'm included in that. She's going to have a rat tattooed on her back with my name under it for the rest of her life. We've been friends for just over a decade. The girl she was talking to is one of my best friends' new roommates with whom I get along extremely well. Both are extremely caring/sensitive people.

I've not yet told more than a choice few of my friends that I have bipolar disorder, for various reasons. I got up and sat down beside Sadie and across from Sharon. My feathers were kind of ruffled but I knew I needed to keep composure, knowing it was likely they just didn't understand. 

""Sharon, when's the last time I scared the shit out of you?"" I asked. She looked perplexed and said ""You're the most considerate, understanding person I know. You've never scared me."". ""I have bipolar disorder."" was followed by a breif awkward silence.

Sadie turned to me and asked ""Are you on meds?"" to which I said yes. What happened then was quite...disheartening I guess. She put her hand on her shoulder, looked me in the eye and said ""Please don't ever stop taking your meds, I don't want to stop being your friend.""

I can't remember exactly what I said after that, I remember being kind of jumbled but trying to explain that having a mental illness doesn't make you inherently violent, and gave a few poor examples from the media (of what, I can't remember anymore) before walking off to my friends' room to be alone.

I understand that neither were trying to hurt my feelings, but that they just don't understand. I have a feeling that I could talk to them about the disorder in the future to help them come to a better understanding of what bipolar disorder really is, though I'm still just a bit choked at what happened that night. I bear no anger or resentment towards either of them. They're very loving people, I think I just need the courage to educate them more...what do you guys think?

It's been over two years since my diagnosis, and sometimes, I think, it is difficult, not to mention terribly painful, to read through /r/bipolar. Some days, however, I'm up for the challenge. So, as a measure of my solidarity and support, today I offer you something that I have found extremely helpful when words and explanations never seem to capture fully what our various moods feel like. I'm almost through David Foster Wallace's Infinite Jest--a book that has aided as much as it has hindered my recovery--and this is just about the finest description of depression I've ever encountered. THIS is what it feels like:

(Note: the first line is spoken by the doctor, the next by the patient, and so forth)

""'What I'm trying to ask, I think, is whether this feeling you're communicating is the feeling you associate with your depression.'

Her gaze moved off. 'That's what you guys want to call it, I guess.'

The doctor clicked his pen slowly a few times and explained that he's more interested here in what *she* would choose to call the feeling, since it was her feeling.

The resumed study of the movement of her feet. 'When people call it that I always get pissed off because I always think *depression* sounds like you just get really sad, you get quiet and melancholy and just like sit quietly by the window sighing or just lying around. A state of not caring about anything. A kind of blue kind of peaceful state.' She seemed to the doctor decidedly more animated now, even as she seemed unable to meet his eyes. Her respiration had sped back up. The doctor recalled the classic hyperventilatory episodes being characterized by carpopedal spasms, and reminded himself to monitor the patient's hands and feet carefully during the interview for any signs of tetanic contraction, in which case the prescribed therapy would be I.V. calcium in a saline percentage he would need quickly to look up.

'Well *this*'--she gestured at herself--'isn't a state. This is a *feeling*. I feel it all over. In my arms and legs.'

'That would include your carp--your hands and feet?'

'All *over*. My head, throat, butt. In my stomach. It's all over everywhere. I don't know what I could call it. It's like I can't get enough outside it to call it anything. It's like horror more than sadness. It's more like horror. It's like something horrible is about to happen, the most horrible thing you can imagine--no, worse than you can imagine because there's the feeling that there's something you have to do right away to stop it but you don't know what it is you have to do, and then it's happening, too, the whole horrible time, it's about to happen and also it's happening, all at the same time.'

'So you'd say anxiety is a big part of your depressions.'

It was now not clear whether she was responding to the doctor or not. 'Everything gets horrible. Everything you see gets ugly. *Lurid* is the word. Doctor Garton said *lurid*, one time. That's the right word for it. And everything sounds harsh, spiny and harsh-sounding, like every sound you hear all of a sudden has teeth. And smelling like I smell bad even after I just got out of the shower. It's like what's the point of washing if everything smells like I need another shower.'

The doctor looked intrigued rather than concerned for a moment as he wrote all this down. He preferred handwritten notes to a laptop because he felt that M.D.s who typed into their laps during clinical interviews gave a cold impression.

Kate Gompert's face writhed for a moment while the doctor was writing. 'I fear this feeling more than I fear anything, man. More than pain, or my mom dying, or environmental toxicity. Anything.'

'Fear is a major part of anxiety,' the doctor confirmed.

[...]

'Listen,' she said. 'Have you ever felt sick? I mean nauseous, like you knew you were going to throw up?""

The doctor made a gesture like Well sure.

'But that's just in your stomach,' Kate Gompert said. 'It's a horrible feeling but it's just in your stomach. That's why the term is ""sick to your stomach.""' She was back to looking intently at her lower carpopedals. 'What I told Dr. Garton is OK but imagine if you felt that way all over, inside. All through you. Like every cell and every atom or brain-cell or whatever was so nauseous it wanted to throw up, but it couldn't, and you felt that way all the time, and you're sure, you're positive the feeling will never go away, you're going to spend the rest of your natural life feeling like this.'

The doctor wrote down something much too brief to correspond directly to what she'd said. He was nodding both while he wrote and when he looked up. 'And yet this nauseated feeling has come and gone for you in the past, it's passed eventually during prior depressions, Katherine, has it not?'

'But when you're in the feeling you forget. The feeling feels like it's always been there and will always be there, and you forget....'""

One of my ex-girlfriend's talked to me recently. She's not a bad ex or anything. We're actually pretty good friends. What she said, though, really got to me. She said that my bipolar is part of who I really am. Without it, I'm not me. I don't think I really believe her or anything, but it kind of sucks.

Last night I was going out alone to run an errand. I didn't quite make it in the car. I feel in the driveway and found myself crying with my back on the wheel of my minivan. Right there in the driveway, in the dark, crying uncontrollably. I was shivering, scared, and so very sad. I didn't want to exist anymore. I was so scared and my front door was only 30' away from me. This went one for an hour or so. I just wanted to give up. I managed to get my phone out and call the house. My four year old came out and asked why I was crying. I just told him I was really sad, and he wrapped his little arms around me and held me telling me that I didn't need to be sad. He was there to make me better. He gave me the strength I needed to get up and get back in the house where I was able to come out of it. I hate how melodramatic this sounds, and I want to roll my eyes reading this, but I just wanted to share how in my darkest moment, I was able to ask for help. I've always told myself not to let my family worry about my “crazy” side and did my best to keep the most extreme moments hidden. I don't know what I would have done if I hadn't reached out to my spouse and my son. I felt so silly and exposed, but I've never been more pleased to open my eyes this morning after taking a xanax and a sleep aid to knock me out. I still feel like hell, and could start crying again at any moment, but I have hope today, and I'm going to make contact with my new pDoc to get my meds adjusted. It would seem that they aren't quite doing what I need them to anymore. I don't consider myself a dramatic person at all, and I feel silly even sharing this. But there is a part of me who feels like it will help. So there it is.

He went manic about two years ago for the first time. He'd never had any problems prior. He was 21 when it happened. Only the first time it was weeks of staying up late writing these crazy theories about the universe, they were insane ideas. 

My parents were in denial, I suggested bipolar first after looking up what I thought were his symptoms. 

Eventually one day he got aggressive and my youngest brother had to help me hold him down, this was around Xmas time 2010. 
My mum managed to get him on a train (he was too afraid to drive in cars because of the slim chance of having a crash). 

Anyway they diagnosed him and gave him meds. 

He was ok after a few weeks and came home, and he turned back into his normal self. 

A month or so ago he decided he didn't want to take his pills because he didn't need them. We all tried to tell him it was a bad idea but you guys would know if you are manic you don't listen to logic and aren't rational. 

Anyway he was getting really obbsesed with writing a movie. Then a song. 

Anyway today I came home from work and all of his things from his room had been moved out, and everything from the bathroom. it was like a horror movie where everything is suddenly moved. He was looking for a bandaid or something. 

So that was weird. I asked him why he did it, and he seemed ok? Like he said, ""Oh I don't know it was crazy, I'm stupid"" and he seemed embarrassed, like a normal reaction. 

This was like 6pm? 

Anyway I made dinner and dad told him to take the dog for a walk (so dad could ring his friends and explain why he was calling them all crazy like, and so that he would come back, have dinner, take a sedative, and then take him to see his psychiatrist tomorrow). 

He was gone for about 40 mins. When he came back I, as nicely as I could, just asked him where my razor was (because he'd moved everything and I need it to shave before work tomorrow). 

But he said ""Nope no idea Lol"" but in a kind of aggressive voice. 

I didn't think much I knew he was getting kind of manic so I didn't want to pester him. 

So I went into my room and was writing a really great response to an AMA answer on that tom hanks kid AMA, while watching an ep of that 70's show. 

I heard him yell ""STAY THE FUCK AWAY FROM (OUR DOGS NAME)!"". 

I was like wtf, I went out and it was just dad and him, and our dog. I was like wtf, then he walked right up to me , right in my face and was just trying to get me to fight him, he was calling me fat, and saying I never do anything (which is true, but at least I have a job), and said something like, ""so that's better than getting laid is it?"" (watching tv and redditing) I was like WTF (you're one to talk) but I didn't say that, I just tried to stay calm but honestly I was pretty scared. He started saying ""It's all obvious now, I'm the devil"". 

Dad walked behind him and mouthed ""I'm calling the cops"", I just tried to shut my door. 

He had totally snapped. Cracked. I've never seen it like this before, he was never this bad, and threatening.. 
He said ""Do you know why I have to choke the dog?"" I ignored him and walked out the back to make sure the dog was ok. 

""because I'm the devil"". 

Now you should know he absolutely LOVES that dog. More than anyone in the family. And she loves him back too. 


So I just stood out the back with no weapon just thinking I'll have to take him down.. Mean while WHERE THE FUCK ARE THE POLICE! 

My dad had rang 000 emergency five minutes ago but no one was there. This is a small town, cops are about 5 blocks away with nothing to do. 

I ran 000 again and by this stage he had decided he was going to run away because his mum told him to stay put (dad had called mum who was at work ((nightshift)), I was down the other end of the house 1)hiding and 2) trying to get the bloody cops there! The women just DID NOT understand the gravity of the situation. I know it's a tough job but she was even arguing with me, I was just trying to explain where we lived. At one point he started to yell because he could find his ipod, he started yelling where is mine? I told him I don't know! (honestly I had no idea) he picked up my iphone and said ""is this it?"" I said NO that my phone, he shrugged and threw it on the tiles, it broke the screen and the back, but I didn't care I was more concerned about getting the cops there ASAP!

She said they were on their way (now ten minutes later). I went out the front to try to flag them down.


Just as I went out they were driving past. They missed our place. Fuck. I ran out to the road (i'm very unfit) and tried waving my iphone to flag them down. They didn't see me. They drive about 1km down the road in the totally wrong direction. What the fuck. Why don't police have fucking GPS????They're like a hundred bucks???


I ran out tot he road and they didn't see me flag them down ( i was waving my broken iphone but it was too dim they didn't see it). 

Then I heard him come out the front of our house and he was walking toward me, I was freaking out. I mean I'm big guy, but Im really unfit so I couldn't run, he's way fitter than me and totally fucking psychotic. 

He was saying ""Im coming for you"" ""should have hid better"" in a kind of sing song murderer  voice. 

I ran into the neighbours place calling triple 0 YELLING at them to get there. I know I wasn't being rational by then but it was so fucking simple, call the local station, and RADIO them that the car on the call WENT past and NEEDS TO TURN BACK NOW! 

Mean while my brother starts smashing on the door. The neigbours are like WTF, one is a nice guy and we know him but he's slow and didn't know what was going on obviously. The other guy looked furious, I tried to explain, brother smashed half the door in while I was trying to hold it, while trying to call 000 to get there! 

Then he started singing 'tip toe, through the tulips"" he thinks hes in a movie or something! Insidious! I was freaking out, I turned around and he's casually walking inside saying "" you know you shouldn't leave your back door unlocked"" I was like WTF, I said THE COPS ARE OUT SIDE NOW! even though I knew they weren't. 

But it kind of worked because he started talking to the guys inside, I heard him say ""oh that's a nice TV"", like he was going to smash it, I was like FUCK he's going to break the TV and the pisssed off guy is going to bash him! I said look don't hurt him he's crazy!

I ran off home and go my keys and BELTED it to the road in my avalon, I floored it down the road where the cops had gone. I started flashing my lights at what I thought was them, but it was some other guy in a 4wd, I said ""Did you see cops go past here?""!!! He said yeah but was vague, he was suspicious of me or something. 

I floored it again and then saw the cops, I did an 8 point turn because the road is so narrow (country road), I revered and yelled out, FOLLOW ME! 

I floored it back down the road, they were following me, I pulled up with my high beams on the neighbours house, and they did too. I told him he was inside but HE WAS NOT ARMED, they kept asking that (fair enough) but I didn't want them to hurt him. 

They went in side and luckily he didn't put up a fight, but he was saying some really disgusting things to the cop, things he would obviously, no one, would obviously ever say. 

He was feining possession like a devil as they walked him away, they put him in the truck and locked it. 

He started singing the tulips song again. 

I was really worked up, I was furious the cops had taken so long, because 000 didn't take us seriously. Three calls. And even then I had to lead them to the house. 

I said this to the cop and he took it personally, he said somehthing to me like "" your a cock head"". I was so mad but I didn't have time to start an argument plus I was worried he might lock me up too!?

The young cop walked with me and dad back to our house, I told the neighbor we will pay for a new door etc, he was really good about it. 

We gave the cop statements. 

Anyway they took him to the local hospital. They aren't equipped to deal with him. We want to get him back to the melbourne clinic. We have private health insurance so it should be ok. 

My mum and dad are at the hospital with him. The police are still there. 

He is refusing to take any drugs. 

So now what? He is trained as a nurse, even though he didn't want to do it, there is no way he can ever work in that field again now, I guess. He is 23, is so smart, has his whole life, and he's fucked it, because he stopped taking his medication. 

I recorded some of the conversations with the cops with my iphone. I want to play them back one day, in a few months, once he is stable, in the hope he will never consider going off them again. Because by the time he decides he is going off them, it's too late, he is manic and then this will happen again.


Sorry about the bad writing I'm normally pretty good but I'm so worked up and tired and don't have anyone to talk to, but I just want to write this in the hopes that someone with bipolar might RECONSIDER stopping their medication without any help from their dr first. 

I think stopping on his own was possibly the cause for this sudden onset. 

I feel the worst for my mum. She's pretty old and finally got a good job even though it's night shift, and she had to leave, and I mean that's the least of it, she is heartbroken as you can imagine, I feel so bad for my parents, and my brother. Right now I can't see a time when he will ever be able to live a normal life. Unless he stays on his meds for good. But who knows?


Anyway thats all I have to say about that.

If I'm upfront with people and they react badly, won't that just weed out the people/jobs that aren't good enough to have me?

I'm not throwing it in anyone's face or awkwardly making a point of announcing it, but I'm definitely not avoiding it.

I was talking with a parent of an individual with mental illness and the parent expressed to me that stigma would be decreased in this country if families and I’m imaging parents specifically, could have access to their child’s records and have the right to institutionalize them against their will if they felt it necessary.  So what do we think of that?   What do you think of that?  I certainly know what I think of it.  But before I express my personal opinion here, let me offer a couple of perspectives. 

 I can appreciate the intense need to protect one’s child, to eliminate inappropriate or even dangerous behaviors, and how very difficult it can be to help one’s child when the system is set to preserve his or her rights even unto dire consequences.  Wouldn’t it be simpler if when an individual is stamped with a label of mental illness, the label also offered family the right to interfere on behalf of the individual and seek treatment for that individual?

So would this eliminate stigma?  Would allowing families the right to make decisions and access medical records of individuals with mental illness help to eliminate stigma?  How so?  Or would being able to institutionalize another person against his or her will just eliminate society from seeing them and what they have?  And is that a reducer of stigma?  

In the 1500’s in Europe the “mad” were taken out of society and placed on ships to wander the sea.  Later madhouses replaced ships and the unemployed and poor were added to the insane as a means of reformation and for keeping the above mentioned groups from undermining the norms of society.  Eventually, asylums took the place of madhouses.  The poor and unemployed were removed from the ranks of individuals placed in these places as the insane might infect them.  The insane were treated as children and were offered positive reward and punishment for corresponding behavior.  If society experienced any guilt as a result of producing a population of insane individuals, that guilt was removed and placed within the insane individual by conditioning and as leverage for desired behaviors.  So now we have a more civilized version of asylums where the point is to try to get the individual back out into society to function, which is not working all the effectively either because society is not equipped to accommodate the needs of the mentally ill population. So in the midst of the little jag of history, where does giving the family the right to make decisions for individuals factor in?  Think about it.  
Here is my view.  As a person who has a mental illness, a rather high I.Q. and a sense of personal space, I find the idea deplorable.  I understand that there are individuals with certain types of mental illness who are not cognizant, but passing laws that allow the family to make life decisions against those of the individual, not to mention have access to medical records, would affect me as well because I am mentally ill.  And I am not at all okay with my family taking over my personal freedoms and seeing records that are mine.  I have to ask individuals who are not mentally ill, “How would you like to have someone in your family decide you are going to be put away in and institution?”  How would it feel to know your family can have access to your medical records any time they would like?  See, once we step over that line that protects personal freedoms, we have entered a very dangerous place that is only a step away from ships wandering around, indefinitely, on the ocean.  I, for one, say what will be done with my life, and if I decide I want to end it, that is my one basic freedom, because my life belongs to me and I will settle what I do with it with God.

I also believe that embracing such an ideology enforces stigma rather than eliminates it.  But again, this is my personal feeling on the matter, and I’m coming from a place of considerable bias.  I did ask my mom about what she thought.  I wondered if maybe all parents feel this way and I have been grossly biasing my view.  She intimated that she would never consider having the right to make decisions for me as a solution for my mental health issues, and I found that reassuring because she has experienced me suicidal many times over the past 20 years. 

So here is what I propose to help your family if you have a mental illness.  If you are no longer in denial about having a mental illness, take preemptive steps.  In the past I have it set up so that my sister had power of attorney over me and mine, and she has had to use those powers for me in the past.  Now that I am married, my husband has those powers with consultation from my mom and sister.  It’s not difficult to set such a thing up, and I still have control over how it would be managed.  The best policy is to plan ahead if you can at all.  If you are person who moves in and out of sanity, when you have a sane moment, get it done so that your family does not have to fight the system to take care of you.  It is valuable to remember that while many families love and want to take care of family members with mental illness, there are just as many who do not and who would take advantage of the option to just dispose of a life that struggles with mental illness by having the person locked up in and institution.

i worked an extra 17 hours this weekend. i even stayed up a full night trying to fix something. i got it working and everything went smooth for the rest of the events. 

... why do i care? my life is a total wreck. yet i would bend over backwards to make sure things go well for work. because i know that if i mess up, or if someone else messes up and i can fix it, it effects hundreds and not sometimes thousands of people simultaneously. 

so that means i can take care of thousands of people, but i can't for myself. i'm not saying that i'm important or anything. i'm just stating the fact i take care of so much and neglect myself. 

at times i feel as i'm a drop in the water of the world. but then i learned that i'm not in the same water as everyone else. i'm in a puddle or something. or in a crappy fishbowl. 

do i present myself as this butterfly as people tell me? or is it just encouragement because i have low self esteem and they just need me at work because no one else will do what i do. mainly because they have families and can't drop what they are doing because a broadcast is having an issue. but they get paid the same as me. they get the same benefits. why am i doing all this work, taking no vacation and neglecting myself? 

why... b/c work is easier than life. thats why...

BUT, it is also a medical disorder that affects the parts of you that determine who you are. Having cancer or not having cancer has no fundamental impact on who you are as a person - can anyone really say the same of bipolar disorder?

I think it's important that we recognize that being bipolar is who we are. It impacts our personalities, our behaviors, our interactions with others - it infiltrates every bit of our mind. We are bipolars - **and that's perfectly okay.** I am bipolar, and I'm not going to feel bad about saying it.

However, my parents claim that when I was ten years old I went from a happy go lucky kid, and turned into a rainy beast that clawed out the eyes of anyone who got near me. 

I always considered my ups and downs as normal, but in retrospect, it probably was the reason behind my compulsive behavior, dropping out of school half way through the year, the hours and hours I spent in bed. 

When I was 18 I was drafted into the army, at first it was amazing. I loved the thrill, the rush of running, feeling like I was making a difference, my physical health went from fat with a screen tan to solid muscle mass, with a dark tan from hours in the sun. 

Then I fell. Something happened to my knee. I got kicked off of my base, thrown into the buerocratic bullshit of the army, floating. I had no commander, I had no base, I had no one to answer to, and no one I could ask for help. Only a slip of paper with an address, that I would hobble on my crutches to, every day, sit outside an unmarked building waiting for someone to tell me what to do, from 8 am, until 6 pm. Then I would hobble back to my parents house, lock my door, and cry myself to sleep. It was a dark time for me, every time I think about that period of time, I feel like I'm floating in an endless ocean, any sound I make feels like it echoes for miles and miles and no one can hear it.

One day, I got to see a doctor. I then saw a physical therapist, and for a month, I would exercise for hours. It wasn't easy, but when I got a position, I could just limp, in my own, and that was a big deal. 

I was moved to a base, 6 hours south of my parents home, as a staff Sargent for a battalion of officers in training. Easily 600 new people every 3 months, making sure they had food, water, beds, clothing, gear, ammo, I did a damn good job. 

That's when I started having nightmares. I would wake up, crying, my sheets stocky with blood from the deep scratches I'd gouged with my nails while I was asleep.  My life became a living hell. I wouldn't sleep, for days, trying to escape the hellish nightmares I knew we're waiting for me, when I let my guard down. I threw myself into my work, tirelessly cleaning my storerooms, reorganizing everything I had, I would work out, for hours and hours every night, trying not to fall asleep while lifting weights. 

Everything came crashing down around me, when I came back from the shower and found my commander sitting in my room waiting for me. He saw the scars, scabs, and open wounds. He got up and left without a word, and the next day I was transferred to another unit. I sank down into depression, the likes of which I have not experienced since then. 

I was moved from unit to unit, no one wanted me. I slept all day, hardly eating, sitting in my room, cutting, and listening to music. I tried to escape by reading books, I read everything I could get, but nothing helped. 

I would take walks in the dead of night, sneaking past the guard towers, climbing onto rooftops, I would stand looking down, for hours, until the sun came up. Then I would slink through the base, back to my room, my private place of torment, and pain. 

I think I was sent to the emergency room once or twice during that time, some high ranking officer would come looking for me, and would find me sitting in bed, with a bloodstained uniform glued to my body. They'd take the initiative to get me sent to the emergency room, but I always ended up back on base with some bullshit diagnosis like OCD, or none at all. 

One day, I woke up, and... I felt really good, alive. My whole body seared with... This pleasant tingling. Every time I moved, my scabs would crack, and pull. It felt amazing, really. I hadn't felt as alive as that in a long time. I put on a clean uniform, I ventured out, I went to do whatever my job was at the time, no one said a word to me, I just joined in on the manual labor, and worked myself to the bone. 

I noticed something was wrong, everyone who saw me shied away, they seemed scared of me, I heard whispers following me everywhere I went.  Then it hit me, I was covered in a bloody uniform, probably pale as a ghost. No one had seen me in months. So I went to the doctor. 

I got into her office, and she asked me what the problem was. I took off my shirt, and let everything out. I told her about the nightmares, I told her about the depression, I told her how I'd felt alive that morning. 

She told me she would get me help, she promised. She lied. 

Next thing I know, it's two weeks later, someone is putting an m16 in my hands, telling me I'd be doing guard duty for the next two weeks. 

I'm in my room, people are talking to me, a lot of people, everyone seems upset, I don't even remember coming up here. Suddenly someone is pulling something away from me. I hold onto it for dear life. It slips out of my fingers. ""Are you crazy?!"" ""What the fuck are you thinking?!?"" ""Why didn't you talk to us?!"" 

That's how I was let out of the army. I saw two people the same day. Then I was discharged. 

I think my parents noticed something wasn't right. I insisted on moving out of their house as soon as I was discharged. I found a job in the city, an apartment 2 weeks later. 

I was cooking in a bar, I took care of the bartenders when they ordered food, in return they took care of me. Special coke, or cubalibre. I would finish my shifts with a few beers, and a couple of shots. I would go home and drink, I would wake up in the middle of the night thirsty, and I would drink. It was a dark time. 

I tried to kill myself, probably another two times. I took tray after tray of pills, I would wake up the next day feeling like shit, sometimes I would puke it all up. 

Then I discovered pot. It was a godsend. My leg stopped hurting, I was drinking less, I was smiling, laughing, I made friends, I was going out, I started bringing girls home every night. I thought ""wow, I feel good, I'm making money, I don't give a shit about anything, this is what life should be like.""

But then I started getting less shifts. Money was tight, I wasn't even making ends meet. Debt, to the bank, to my dealers, to my friends. So I have my two weeks notice. Set up an interview with a bigger more high end restaurant, I thought I had everything under control. 

I woke up the next morning in my shower, cold water streaming down on me, blood puddles under my head. I was groggy.  I looked in the mirror, my two front teeth were cracked in half, my lip was dripping blood. I pulled out the rest of my teeth from the nasty gash in my lip, washed up, and called a cab to the E.R. 

After a few weeks, I was feeling better. I started my new job, I was making money again, moving up faster than they could believe. Prep to cold line in two weeks, cold line to hot line in a month and a half, hot line to night manager in a month. I was cooking up a storm, feeling great. I was hardly sleeping, hardly eating, putting so much Ritalin up my nose, that I was super human, I was god. I was unstoppable. 

So I decided to see how far I could go. Acid, benzo's, oxy, pot, booze, nicotine, morphine, shrooms. I did every drug I could get my hands on, and I was still able to out-cook, and outwork everyone. I was seeing flaming beasts soar out of my frying pans, and do my bidding. My food was godly, my strength was godly, I. Was. God. 

But being god got boring. I didn't want to be better, I just wanted to be like everyone else. Fuck special. I tried again, and again. I mixed it all. 500mg of Ritalin, 20mg morphine, 20mg Xanax, 50mg oxy, bottles of booze to wash it down. But without fail, I would wake up a few hours later, hungover, and angry. 

Then my favorite co-worker quit. He was happy, he was so happy to leave. So I followed him out the door. And it felt good. I felt free. I spent my days lazing around the house, tripping, or stoned, so detached in my own little benzo's world. 

Money runs out, so I go back to the bar. I work a few days a week. I'm so fucked up, that they could have told me to move mountains, and I would have. My friend wants to move in with me, he has a friend who wants a room too, he tells me she's cool. So we get an apartment.  I work in the bar, then I work at home, painting, cleaning, renovating, putting up shelves, bookcases. 

The friend is cool, she's cute too. I haven't had another woman except work, and drugs for a good year now. Then I find her in my bed, so why not? I can tell she doesn't like the drugs, she drinks, and smokes my pot, but she steers clear of me when I'm in my own little world. I start thinking, I may have a problem, doing lots of drugs. I'm miserable, I walked out on my job earlier that week, I'm out of money, game over. I try again. 

I'm drunk, popping Xanax like they're candy. I'm at a friends, he offers me a tray of oxy's, I dig in, they're gone, so is the beer, I run home, bring a bag. Rum, vodka, beer, pot, shrooms. I eat the shrooms on the way, open a beer to wash them down. I get back to my friends, he asks me if I'm okay. I grin like a fool, and tell him to grab a controller, black ops, now. I start on the rum, we smoke the pot, I'm feeling alive, there's music, but no one is playing any, I'm dancing, my whole body is one with the beat. I'm playing black ops. Fucking nazi zombies. Anyone have something fun? More Xanax, wash it down. 

I wake up on the couch, it's 2 am. My friend is sitting across from me, he looks sad. I stand up, he's looking at me. I ask what's wrong. He slaps me across the face, tells me I can talk to him, goes to bed. 

I walk home. My body hurts. I'm crying. I know I'm not right. My life has been hellish at least since before the army. I call my parents, to ask them if I can stay for a few weeks. 

I lock myself in their basement, and detox. It hurts, I'm in pain. I'm up, down, up, down. Every minute brings a new mood. I'm sick, it hurts, I'm sweating. I wake up a weeks later, sober, and depressed. 

I started taking long walks, rolling cigs by hand, trying to pull my shattered self together. It's crushing, sobriety. I actually have to face myself. I feel like I'm recovering from an illness. Philosophy, questions. I run them through my head, all the time. it doesn't stop. I just can't figure out why I'm here.

I go back to the city. I keep myself stoned. It's the easiest way to cope. I get a job, in some new cafe. I slowly come up, and then I'm at the top again. I walked out one night, and don't go back.

I see a few doctors, get a referral for a pdoc. I make an appointment, the first available. It's in 2 months. I'm trying to stay afloat. But I'm sinking, sinking, sinking. 

4 am. I call my parents. ""Can you come take me to the E.R.?"" ""What's up, what's wrong?"" ""I want to die."" ""We'll be there in 40 minutes. Don't do anything stupid. We love you.""

They sent me to an inpatient clinic. 

They told me I'd do better as an outpatient.

It's been a month. I still feel pointless. Everyday, I wake up, I wash my face, brush my teeth, wash down my handful of pills. Vitamin D, Vitamin B, Mood stabilizer, antidepressant. I shower, get dressed. I smoke a fag. Coffee, fag, homework, fag, walk the dog with a couple of fags, go to class, fag,  come home, fag. Music and fags, TV and fags, Video games and fag.

My life has become going through the motions, appeasing everyone else's desires. My days are broken up by the cigarettes I smoke, and in those 5 minute interludes my thoughts are my own. I feel like a robot, pointless, and only existing as some childs science fair project, thrown in a box of memories, forgotten until the day the family moves, and leaves me behind to rust.

I'm not depressed, I'm not manic. Neither up, or down. Not here, not there. I'm not anywhere. I float, in this endless void called life. Pointless, worthless, wondering what I've done wrong.

I don't know.

(Positive post.)",19,2,10,http://www.reddit.com/r/bipolar/comments/16pw0c/harsh_realizations_and_maybe_some_advice_for/,"To start off I've been diagnosed both Bi-Polar type 2 and ADHD. I was initially diagnosed with ADHD and it blew my mind how much it *was* who I am (same realization with my bi-polar diagnosis.) I never went to doctors (for anything) after cratering a few times after some bouts with GP's putting me on paxil, anti-depressants, and eventually welbutrin, I was pretty much done. 

Fast forward a few years, I found drugs that made pretty much everything better. That would be pot, mushrooms, and LSD (which I've probably done far too much of.) So I ignored all my emotional issues as even with them, I always had a stable job and could deal with them as I've always dealt with them. I will say that in no way am I saying people should take these drugs, but the introspection of LSD saved my life, as I'm also morbidly obese which I've been able to manage after a very emotional trip of LSD.

So I moved to Seattle, WA from Salt Lake City. I moved away from all my friends, made a very stable and great new group of friends (mostly adults with lives.) Eventually I edged into a full time stoner. I was smoking all the time, and the only way to get out of my incredibly moody and depressed state was to numb myself with pot. I had a better life though, I have a really good job, really great friends, and I've lost about 80 pounds, but I was still incredibly unhappy in all the in-betweens. So I got a psychiatrist because my GP said he wasn't going to prescribe anything for me when it comes to mental health. He ended up giving me Lamotrigine which I fought constantly. I had it in my mind that it was going to numb me, ruin me, make everything worse, that my psychiatrist was wrong, and I fought, and I fought constantly. I kept taking it though. I kept on and I fought more, but I kept taking it. I was still compulsively smoking pot, I would guess I was smoking around 500-700$ a month. 

So one of my newer groups of friends had a very unstable friend who claimed that depression, ADHD, and anything else mental was just lies from doctors. I saw this as an anti-intellectual stance and after some backbiting on her part, I didn't get angry because I felt bad for her. Me not getting angry was weird. I ended up reflecting on why I wasn't getting angry. After a while I realized it was because I was doing the same thing. My compulsive pot smoking was right down that alley of ignoring what was real, that it was more than likely what was exacerbating my mental health issues. So I quit smoking, and I kept on the meds, and I've never been clearer in my life. 

I can lay in my bed at night in silence and sleep, I can slow my thoughts down to not constantly think about suicide, drugs, or anxiety. I still have stuff to work on like debt, my life, getting things like clothes and a new bed, because I'm not constantly worrying about whatever it was I was always worrying about and trying to fill it with something that I thought was helping.

So yeah, I just wanted to get that off my chest, and figured maybe it will help somebody. ",,False,self,t5_2qnv4,False,,indigo,True,t3_16pw0c,http://www.reddit.com/r/bipolar/comments/16pw0c/harsh_realizations_and_maybe_some_advice_for/,

Whether you read this all or not, thank you for what time you may have given to my post.

I was born with a mood disorder, with cycles being traced back to when I was an infant; two to three weeks at a time before I would fluctuate to the other end of the spectrum. It was later discovered that my father's side of the family has depression tracing back 7-8 generations. I started suffering from anxiety attacks at the age of six; I would suddenly become overwhelmed with the imminent feeling of needing to be somewhere safe with someone equally as safe. (As the years progressed and I became more self-aware, that place and person were one in the same: wherever my father was, I needed to be there with him.) When I was nine, I started anger management per my parents who found my fits of rage and lashing out in anger totally abnormal, which I agree. At this point, I was an out-of-control nine year old with an acute awareness of the fact that her brain didn't work the same way everyone else's did. It didn't work or process emotions and information like the rest of the world. In my eyes, I was 'defective'.

I was hospitalized for the first time at 15 after telling a school counselor I could not vouch for my safety and had no drive to live anymore. I couldn't tell my parents this; when the school counselor first called to tell them he thought I was suffering from depression, they grounded me thinking I was doing it for attention. (I can proudly say we have come very far since that incident nearly nine years ago and they are the most supportive people I have in my life dealing with my illness.) I spent Thanksgiving that year in the hospital and walked away with a diagnosis of depression.

That diagnosis was changed within 12 days of my discharge after Prozac shot me through the mania roof. I was diagnosed with Bipolar. The following year, at the age of 16, I attempted to kill myself by overdosing on 100 different pills. Had I waited 10 more minutes to call 911, I would not be here today. This called for another week-long stay in the hospital. After describing to my intake doctor my entire out-of-body experience during the whole ideal, and his follow-up interview with my parents, my diagnosis was change to Type II Bipolar Cyclothymia. This was by far the most accurate diagnosis to date. I was released in time to hand out candy to Halloween trick-o-treaters. 

That spring, I was hospitalized for a third time. Two years after that, I willingly admitted myself during a sudden, uncontrollable cyclothymic episode. That was four years ago. The year following my last stay was the last time I was on any sort of medication: 1800mg of Lithium and 10mg of Zyprexa. This would have made my total number of different prescriptions I have ever taken to a round 17. Seroquel has by far, with Lithium a close second, the most effective medication I have ever taken. With the support of my medication doctor, therapist and parents, I ended therapy and eased myself off medication. While the transition off was rough, the last three years have been bliss. 

I have recently started my first serious relationship, one that we both foresee ending in marriage one day. He is the light of my life. He loves me beyond words. He accepted me and my illness and said to me one day, ""I knew you came with a learning curve, but I'm down to play ball. I will always try my best to understand, but please forgive me if I can't. I just want you to be happy, and whatever I can do to help I will."" We had our first fight two months after we started dating, and the last month has been plagued with fighting.

I will find myself suddenly overcome with this blinding rage in reaction to something that is said to me or something that happens. I find myself angry before I can even decide if it is worth being angry about. I suddenly lose control and find myself *watching* instead of in control. I can feel my self control slipping to the point where I become verbally abusive. After another fight over the weekend, my boyfriend confided in me he feels unsafe when I get like that. He understands, though, as best he can. He can see when I lose myself; he can see how empty my eyes are and hear how illogical I become in my snide remarks. This is something I have struggled with my whole life; probably one of the most obvious early symptoms of my disease. 

Let's backtrack a couple months for the full story. Shortly before Halloween, I walked in to work and that unsafe feeling washed over me. I hadn't had an anxiety attack in *years* and have since grown up a lot (chemically, hormonally and maturity). I was able to catch the mood shift instantly and called my father preemptively. I had never been able to stop an anxiety attack in its tracks and felt quite proud. This should have been the first sign of an incoming episode but I didn't heed the warning as I should have. Two days later, when I was out costume shopping with my boyfriend, I momentarily lost track of him in the warehouse and the anxiety attack I thought I had managed to avoid came crashing in to me. I barely made it outside before I broke down sobbing. By the time we made it back to my apartment, I was a mess and my boyfriend was panicked; he had never seen this before and didn't know how to react. I managed to get 'call my dad' out between sobs and he immediately called him. My father talked me down as he always did and while the residual mood took a couple hours to totally wear off, I felt sane again, albeit sad. My boyfriend and I talked for a long time that night; I explained what happened and how I feel. Tried to explain no one thing sets it off. He wanted to be the person I called next time and asked what it is my father said to me on the phone. For the first time in my entire 23 year existence, someone loved me for my crazy and wanted to not only understand but stand by me and help. I am sure every one of you can relate to that feeling of having someone.

But the anger has only continued to linger, unwanted, in our relationship. The fighting become more frequent and less provoked. The anxiety attacks are an almost weekly thing, where I can count all the past anxiety attacks I've ever had on two hands. He says he can handle the sad me, but not the angry me. I can't handle either of me. I just want it to stop. I want to be 'normal' and stable. I want my life back. I want me back. At this point, I don't even know who I am anymore. I am just this bundle of bipolar scar tissue that is angry and sad about being angry and sad.

I don't have health insurance due to a recent job change. I thought a healthier work and sleep routine would help bring balance back (in the past it normally has), but it hasn't helped like I thought it would. Which has created an additional issue: no health insurance. This means I couldn't get on medication when I wanted to, and quite frankly should have. This also means I have no access to a therapist, another integral part of coping and managing bipolar, or at least mine. Today, after nearly losing my boyfriend this weekend due to another anxiety attack that flared and became a rage phase, I called my mother and confessed my mental shortcomings recently. She saw one first hand at the Oregon Civil War game two weeks ago, when I randomly started crying because I felt so uncomfortable being so exposed to so many people in such a large, open, public setting. I spent the second half of the game sorting my sharing-size bag of Skittles by color to calm down. She agreed to pay for the appointment and medication out of pocket. I also leave for 90* Mexico with the family and the boyfriend on Saturday. I'm hoping a good overdose of Vitamin D, combined with medication for the first time in three years, will do my mood some good. I plan to jump back in to therapy once my health insurance kicks in come January.

So today, /r/bipolar, I come to you to proudly say I am embracing this much needed change in my life with a smile on my face and hope for a happy future. I hope the next time I come off medication, I can have an even longer symptom-free streak than before. I hope to finally start and finish school on medication, a feet I have attempted too many times for my own good that ended in a fiery failure of dropping out. I hope to bring my boyfriend with me to a therapy session or two so he can truly take part in helping me manage my illness. But for today, for the first time ever, I am accepting this much needed change. I wish to have a family with children one day. I hope to be happy and successful my whole life. While I've said it before and it was true, I say it again to you right now: **Today is the day I take control of my life and happiness. And I shall WIN.**",,False,self,t5_2qnv4,False,,yellowgreen,True,t3_147v34,http://www.reddit.com/r/bipolar/comments/147v34/after_three_years_symptom_free_today_i_am/,

I know this is bit of a taboo topic around these parts, and that this subreddit is very encouraging of using medication to deal with our collective disorder. I have absolutely no problem with that, and think that a lot of the time medication can do wonderful things for people. I feel like (as someone who is Bipolar Type 2) that in the case of Type 1 it makes even more sense to use medication as the manic periods can be even more difficult to control (Once again, I've never experienced true mania so it's hard for me to say).

But personally, I've always been against taking medication to deal with my own issues. I have a close, supportive group of friends who are aware of my disorder and are always there for me when I need them. I'm a very self-aware person and am good at identifying my emotions and where they are stemming from which helps me through it quite a bit.

Not only that, but my fields of study (Physics, Mathematics, and Computer Science) are all heavily focused around the use of logic and problem solving. All of the concepts and skills that I've learned so far have also been very applicable to the anxiety attacks that I'll have from time to time. 

Between these supports and my therapist I've always felt like I can manage without taking medication. I got to wondering though, how many others are out there like me? How many of you are dealing with your disorder without meds and feel like you're succeeding? 

Like I said, I think medication can be very useful and in some cases necessary. But at the same time, I feel like on there are also anecdotal cases where meds were not necessary. I'm not trying to  call anyone out, or start an argument between meds vs no meds, only attempting to facilitate a discussion between the community.

On top of that, people who are currently taking meds, what's it like? How does it change your perception of reality? How do you feel in the short-term? In the long-term?

Not long after separation and moving back to my hometown, I was diagnosed with Bipolar Disorder (Type II).

It has been a complete mess. I've not kicked, screamed, fought or retaliated when he has gone off on his diatribes either verbally or electronically as much as I have wanted to. I've done everything my legal team has told me to do and have been transparent with my disorder and how the relationship failed.

So it is finals week at UNC-A now, and this is rough to deal with. Last night, I forgot to take my medication, and so I got at most four hours of sleep. I was at someone else's house, and in the early hours of the morning, I started feeling that rise...the manic/hypomanic rise. I kept someone awake talking about how I wanted to go outside and run five miles...At four o' clock in the morning. He finally got me to shut up and went to sleep.

Soon after, I start getting really paranoid about what is going on. I fear that I might start seeing things like the other night I was late on my meds, when I thought that lightning was flowing into my palms and giving me a godlike power, and the sky looked like a rich purple and blue, pulsating. It was like a dream...I did not know it wasn't real until I woke up from it (when I took my medication). Sometimes mania can feel incredibly wonderful.

I did not see things this morning. I heard voices. There was this one low voice that kept repeating over and over, ""Go die, go die..."" Later it kept begging me to put my finger in a socket, and then I mentally told it to shut the fuck up. That made the voice mad, and it said that every time I refused to kill myself, it would show me what would happen to my family. A vivid image of my sister getting ripped apart emerged in my mind.

It got better once I interacted with people, and I quickly went back to my dorm room to take my medication.

To top this off, later in the day, I had a (mentally healthy) friend tell me, ""I wish I could stop feeling so manic-depressive..."" in a really dramatic tone. I glared at him. He seems to think bipolar is just feeling stressed one minute and chilling out the next, or something like that.

There is just no one I can discuss this with who won't treat me like a small child. My boyfriend is also bipolar, but recently he has been giving me the child treatment, and overriding every. single. decision I make. I appreciate the concern, but I just want someone to relate to :(. I won't have a doc's appointment for another few days.

Have you ever flown too close to the sun?

Have you ever been so close to perfection you can taste it?

Have you ever felt invincible,

Unbeatable,

Incomparable,

Every action you made a construct of the god's

No one can tell you you're wrong

No matter how little backing you had

No matter how little rationale was present

You were invincible

You were untouchable

Although the feelings that follow

Will make you feel like porcelain

Every action made that night will eat at you

Like rats eating at a rotting corpse

Only the stench is worse

When you return to some semblance of reality

You will wish you were dead

Because although you shined brighter then the sun that night,

The light you shined revealed your darkest secrets

The kind of secrets no man reveals

The kind of secrets that drive men to church

The kind of secrets that define the devil

And everyone you love has seen them


Shining so bright, your secrets are revealed

They will never see you the same again

The sun has melted your wings 

And you begin your descent to the ocean floor

To be crushed under the weight of a mountain

This is the penance you pay

For playing as a god for a night.

That said, I'm creating this post as a place for the humorous catharsis... Where we can share what we consider hands down our most hilarious and harmless (this is key) antics. The rules are as follows: 

1. Do not post something you are not okay with people laughing at. 
1. We're doing this for fun, not criticism, any posts that are derogatory in nature towards anyone will be removed without mercy. 
1. The intention here is to engender hope that one day those of us currently suffering will be able to look at some of our trials as learning experiences, sources of laughter, and  if you disagree this thread is probably not for you... Yet. 
1. Take everything you see herein with a grain of salt, and a word of caution... Not everyone shares the same sense of humor, and this thread may wind up containing triggers. Goes without saying, the whole forum has that but... I'm saying it, just in case. 

Now that that's out of the road, the reason I created this thread was mostly to share this little excerpt of my time in the psych ward for what is (hopefully) your amusement, and mine: 

It was another boring day in the psych ward, June, 2004. I had completed no less than six jigsaw puzzles, and watched the Star Wars Trilogy at least ten times. I'd made brownies, and rocky road cookies, and had grudgingly participated in the group exercise of the day, which was stretch-band yoga. 

I began to think. And think. I was a little drunk on a cocktail of what may have been a far larger dose of Zyprexa and Clonazepam than I ought to have been taking due to my low drug tolerance; we did not know this was a thing with me at the time. I'll never be sure if it was the medication or the bipolar that led to.. The incident. (One of them, anyways.)

I was busy mulling over my past relationships, the latest one having been a failure on a massive scale. In my drunken/manic state, I determined that I was *clearly* (sarcasm/facepalm) having so many problems because I was so very drop-dead-gorgeous, and no men were truly interested in me for my intelligence. Naturally, I felt persecuted, why ought a goddess like myself be doomed to lead a life as nothing more than a trophy wife, a veritable waste of my numerous talents and charms? 

I thought about this for a time, and I thought... Surely every goddess ought to wear a toga. It was then I spotted my hospital blanket. It wasn't pristine white, of course. There was a nasty blue stripe and some ""property of _____ hospital"" stamps in the same blue. But it would do, oh yes. 

And it did. My toga was glorious. An incredible marvel of engineering, considering they didn't allow us safety pins. I have never since been able to duplicate how I had it draped. And yes, I have tried. 

But a toga, I fear, was not enough. 

No, no, I needed a sign. I had, luckily, hoarded some blank paper and tape, gained from the nurse's station whilst they were otherwise occupied by my fellow prisoners. I even had a crayola marker. It was brown. I wrote ""TROPHY WIFE"" in large letters across my ill-gotten loose-leaf, and pasted it to my back. 

What follows is possibly not ONLY a glorious rendition of my first foray into performance art, it is also my only foray into performance art. 

I snuck out of my room. It was an open floor plan. But by some mercy, nobody saw me, though it was 3 pm. This was sadly disappointing to me. I *wanted* them to notice my pain, my suffering. And then, I saw it. It would be the crucial instrument to my latest coup d'etat.

Shame that I can't express myself as well as I would like. Shame about how I can act in social situation (I feel I make people awkward sometimes)

I realised this the other day and it amazed me I've never noticed it before. I've done it my whole life, being ashamed of myself. It no doubt stems from my childhood so for me to really get to grips with it I'm going to talk to my therapist, I just wondered if any of you are similar or the same? How do you deal with the shame you feel? How do you notice it affects your behaviour?

have you ever heard how loud a heart breaks?
The man on the moon, shed a tear, for each shard, he knows all our sorrows, he knows all our pain, he hears all our screams. 

Some days I wish I could join him, just to be away, just to put things in perspective. Other times, I just want him to leave me alone, because I can't stand the thought of people seeing me like this.

I wonder if he can see my dreams, if he knows how my heart beats her name, and my soul grows so cold without her. If and angel would come to me now, I'd bet for guidance, and the path to her, she loves me so, I know she would hold me close, and never let go.

But I am but a man, whilst doing what I believed was right, I destroyed my world, I burnt my cities to ash, and walked away from the tear that I swore I would never cause.

Bipolar never made me a monster, I made me a monster. Bipolar gave me the courage to kiss her, gave me the bravery to hold her hand.
My humanity, my misunderstanding, left me alone, and now I beckon to the world. 

Reunite me with her and I will  be in your debt.

Ps...I am writing a novel, I am drunk, I am depressed, and I don't know how to face tomorrow, but you know what I know?

I constantly feel like people hate me, especially people who I have been ""friends"" with for many years. I feel like everyone has abandoned me. I feel so alone. I feel like I can channel my energy into something productive, creative, and innovative; but I don't know how to go about doing this.


I have frequent musical hallucinations. They have become more prevelant over time; I hear them every morning and they are playing in my head for several hours a day- they are usually songs I've already heard before; I attribute them to some sort of hearing impairment (as I used to play drums frequently and there have been a few times where I was almost certain that I have some sort of permanent hearing deficit). I sometimes hear ""voices"" for the lack of a better word, but I am 100% aware that they are not really there and that I am creating them, perhaps out of loneliness or to guide me.


I live with my mother and sister and I plan to go to college soon. I was actually feeling good about attending college soon, but I get in these MOODS where everything is fucked. My attention span is terrible- generally when I read something, I forget what I was reading when I jump to the next paragraph. I have extreme difficulty focusing on words and their meanings.


My first ""manic state"" was after I used MDPV/mephedrone ""bath salts"" for the first time. I became very addicted to this drug and I don't feel like I have ever been the same since I first used it, in spite of the occasional ""stable/normal"" states I have felt since then. I generally do not experience MANIC STATES. I sleep TEN TO TWELVE hours a day for the past month or so. I sleep excessively. Occasionally I will sleep only a couple hours for a few days, or not sleep at all, but this generally doesn't last long enough to be considered a MANIC STATE.


I want a fucking hug. A god damn slushie. A fucking beam of light into my brain to activate neurons to help me see outside of myself. My thinking is negatively introspective and outwardly inverted; at least I am aware of this! But I don't know what to do. I don't know who to talk to. No one fucking listens. My ""friends"" insist that there is NOTHING WRONG with me and I am apt to believe them at times. They all insist that I am causing problems for myself and that once I get busy and active and start doing things I will feel much more in control of my life and of my emotions; I agree that activity will make me feel better.


But I fucking hate everyone. I am an empty shell. I am full of bitterness and hate. I hate myself: everyone becomes brighter. I hate everyone else: I become brighter. I am always wearing a mask; I am always transparent. 


There is never a balance of yin and yang. I have tried meditation; I am trying to learn yoga but I get extremely frustrated because I have always been  terrible at learning new information and reciting it; I am trying to learn more about the world around me.


I CANNOT AFFORD MEDICATION OR PSYCHIATRIC VISITS!~~ :(
I don't trust doctors. I just want the medication. I just want the fucking medication but I can't afford the visits to their fucking terrible ""services."" I have never met a doctor who has helped me. They all give me SSRIs which have fucked me. I took Lithium once and should have stayed on it; after I stopped taking it I experienced a ""MANIC STATE"" for three weeks.


TL;DR: How are your meds? How's your life? Do you feel like this? Do I sound insane? Do you care? Has anything improved for you since you began treatment? I can't hold a fucking job or stay in school. Have your meds helped you with this? Are there any programs you could refer me to in order to help with my inability to pay for treatment? I want to get ""stable"" so I can feel comfortable enough to make something of myself. I want to feel comfortable in my skin and in my brain. That is all.

This came as a complete shock to me, I didn't see it coming.  Reasons were varied but in particular one thing resonated - ""I've lost interest, it happens with a lot of the hobbies I have.""

I reasoned and bargained and we decided to ""work on things"" but two weeks later and even more distance I get hit with another cracker - ""I can't deal with your depression.""

I have bipolar disorder. I also have a rat that I rescued from the wild. (for the truly curious, it's somewhere in the history). He's always been a bit 'distant', but as I got him a domesticated companion early on, he was fine. Until the companion died from complications of hind leg paralysis.
After domestic rattie's death, my wild rat reverted, became...reclusive. Unsocial.
I tried introducing him to a new young rat, which he promptly and violently killed.
I opened up his cage, and let him free range in the room (my studio). I vowed to at least be there for him every day. Months went by, and he wanted nothing to do with me. Still, I tried.
Sporadic success with hand feeding: some days fine, some days aggressive biting. I kept trying.
Fast forward months later. Perhaps even a year.
I'm having a particularly awful episode, and am trying to hide from my family. I'm crying. I am beside myself; nothing to do but wait it out.I sit by the rat cage with my head in my hands, crying as quietly as possible.
Here comes my hermit, non-social rat, out of his hiding place. Waddles out of the dark, onto my lap. Takes my finger in his paws, and starts grooming.
This, my friends, is the true definition of love.

Learning to understand normal emotions after a lifetime of working around the bipolar crazies.,21,4,9,http://www.reddit.com/r/bipolar/comments/17krso/has_anyone_else_dealt_with_this_learning_to/,"Hi! I'm 25, and I've been bipolar since I was 12 or 13. I've only been on medication for a little over a year. Suffice it to say, my entire adolescent and adult life has been a dance between the extremes of emotional irrationality. I knew nothing of normal emotions. So much of my time and energy and self has, over the course of my life, been devoted to the disorder. In the past several years, the mania progressed into psychosis, which meant whatever I was feeling had even less resemblance to what normal emotions are.





Since being medicated, all those parts of myself that were filled with the bipolar have been hollowed out. I've spent a lot of time trying to figure out who I am now and what I am going to fill those spaces in my personality with. Slowly, real emotions have trickled in. At first, I had no idea how to interpret any of them. They were just THERE, amorphous clouds of discomfort that I couldn't get away from, ignore, or untangle. 




As the months have progressed, I've slowly begun to understand them. Sadness. Hope. Jealousy. Disappointment. Joy! Fear. Resolve. Compassion. Empathy. Real things. Emotions I have never produced before. I am still on the journey of trying to figure myself out, but I'd like to hear from the community. I know no other bipolar individuals in my life who have stuck with medication as long as I have, and thusly I have nobody to share my experiences with.




Right now, the primary emotions I'm feeling are sadness and disappointment. I've gotten myself into a very emotionally complex situation with a new sex buddy, as well as dealing with eviction from my apartment and the myriad changes that is bringing to my life. 




I could really use some commiseration. Sadness sort of feels like the sensation of a foot that has fallen asleep waking up. Disappointment feels like a warm coal in the pit of my stomach. Joy feels like a tiny, harmless mania. Fear feels like a rushing fire in my veins. Resolve feels like a rock in the middle of a storm that I have my feet firmly placed on. Hope feels white, if that makes any sense. It feels white and warm and it sort of sits behind my ears and the sides of my lungs and my abdomen. Jealousy is painful, and feels like disappointment and fear mixed up together. It burns. Empathy and compassion feel like a stretching of the self towards another person, a desire to help with no regard for myself. 




This all sounds nuts when I type it out, but we're all crazy here, right? Sitting with this sadness and letting myself feel it is uncomfortable, but it feels good in a weird way. Being a normal human is weird is essentially the point I'm trying to make here.

It like having to talk to your parents about something you did after a fun day at the amusement park. Reflecting on some of the mistakes you made while having all that fun.

While I really enjoy and excel at teaching kids, I am mortified at the thought of raising teenagers.  On top of that, I fear that bringing a child into this over-populated, terrible world in the throws of climate change and environmental upheaval would both be selfish and cruel.



And of course, the likelihood that any child I bear will have the disease I have.  That they will have to suffer the unimaginable pain that I experienced while growing up.  While I could help them cope and medicate better than my parents could help me, it probably won't be enough.




I dream about getting pregnant.

They start out pleasant.  I discover I'm pregnant or suddenly find that I am *very* pregnant, but I'm happy about it.  Then my real-life neuroses kick in and I start wondering if I've been eating right, exercising, and taking vitamins.

I have been depressed for a very long time (about 1 year) and I have finally come out of it. I have been diagnosed as recurrent major depression for the last few years by a couple psychiatrists and psychologists. 

During my latest depression episode I was recently hospitalized for suicidal threats and planning (this episode was going on one year so I was tired of life at this point). I was diagnosed Bipolar II during my 28 day stay. I was put on Lithium 900mg once a day. It gave me intolerable side effects so now I am off it after 2 months, &amp; unmedicated at this point. My psychiatrist and I do not agree with their diagnosis but it certainly is not being ruled out. So since my first hospitalization I am trying to be more aware of my moods.
I am trying my best to keep up a mood chart. I am being as honest as possible with my psychiatrist, and always bring my notebook to remember points to discuss for my session.

Well last week, just kinda one day, it's like a switch went off and the depression stopped. I woke up and everything was cool. No worries. I felt awesome. Everything seemed brighter. Talking a lot more and seem more enthusiastic (but no pressured speech). It felt like I got new knowledge, like I am in control again. 

And when I been taking a shower, it's like I am hearing an old radio playing with old school jazz and blues music. (I will also note that I love music and listen to it as much as possible and I am an artist as well - but not in that genre).

At times I can concentrate like a lioness catching prey during certain tasks, and then other times I get so distracted like a kitten and everything seems so interesting and can't pay attention. 

I am horny as heck right now too (during my depression I would only have sex once a month if that and never masturbate, this week I already had sex 3 times and masturbate about 4-6 times a day).

 I am cooking dinners again most days, I am catching up and keeping up with housework. 

I don't eat during the day but I binge eat at night and I hate doing that. In the last week I gained about 10 lbs from doing that (though I can't complain). 

I got so many thoughts flying through my head and it gets frustrating at times because some of them are good but I can never remember them. 

My heart races and I feel like danger is ahead for no reason at times. I get irritated and angry over stupid stuff. I can't stay still and it feels like my skin is buzzing. 

I been sleeping about 5 hrs a day (my usual is about 8-9 hrs). 

This is the best I have felt in a while. I have hope, but at the same time could care less is if I died tonight. I don't feel euphoric and I am far from apathetic. I don't know if this is normal because I honestly don't remember what my normal self feels like anymore.

I think I'm feeling alone and just need to talk to someone - 

I am hyper-sensitive to all medications and substances (trust me, I'm the last person you wanna smoke pot with..I get super weird super fast). If a medication has a side effect, I experience it, even on the lowest dose possible. I'm bipolar 2, technically; I've never had a mania episode bad enough to totally throw me off the chains, but the episodes I do get are enough to make life hell for a while. My biggest thing is the major, chronic depression I get interspersed with random high excitability, irritability, inability to sleep, and feeling like I'm on top of the world when really I'm a mess in my head.

Right now my doctor is trying to manage my depression and bad anxiety. I started Effexor a little over a month ago and it finally quieted enough of the stuff in my head to make me feel stable for a bit, but it made me ravenously hungry to the point where I was consuming 2,000 calories+ a day and not feeling full at all. Miserable. Plus, in high school when I was going to a psychiatrist my mother appointed and didn't really have the agency I have today, I gained nearly 100 pounds on a combination of Risperdal and Lexapro over the course of about a year. It was a nightmare and I still haven't lost all that I gained. So, me being stubborn me, I stopped the Effexor cold turkey..couldn't break the pills in half, couldn't get in to see my doctor, and I was already on the lowest dose possible. 

Last night my irritability and frustration got so bad that I was having a hard time dealing with situations that probably don't make most people crazy, but send me in an emotional fit where I want to hit myself and hide in a corner. (Side note - does anyone else experience this? It is the only thing that makes me ashamed of being bipolar..in high stress situations I do okay as long as I'm around people, but alone I kind of feel like an over-stimulated child that wants to throw a tantrum and hurt myself; the stress is enough to make my chest tighten up and this total lack of self-control washes over me. It kind of reminds me of fits that autistic children have, actually, which I am not saying to be rude or insensitive...I have worked with special needs kids most of my adult life and cherish them immensely) So, I took the Effexor after nearly a week off of it and I'm fighting to get in to see my doctor. It's hard to find specialists or get into see them where I live, even though it's a major city, but I feel like I should trust this guy as an internal medicine doc because he is very willing to listen to me and tweak medications, plus he's been doing research on medications to help figure things out for me. I get frustrated, though, because nothing ever seems to work. Thus far, we've tried four different medications over the course of six months and the side effects are far outweighing the benefits each time. Anybody able to relate to this? What would you do? I'm finally realizing that I NEED medication to function throughout my day and be successful in my life, but I always feel like I'm fighting a losing battle with the meds.. 

**EDIT: I realized just now that the rules have changed and I'm not supposed to be asking for medication help.. I'm not asking for people to be all, ""Oh, you should try such and such at this dose!"" like a doctor would, I'm trying to facilitate a discussion around being frustrated with medications and building a community through the ""I feel ya bro"" sense.

I have now been stable for over a year but still have panic attacks. I am 20 and in college. I completed my first semester of college last semester after a few attempts that ended with me in the hospital. Needless to say, i was scared to go back at first. I acquired my first PSD a few weeks before starting classes. He was already trained for a friend of mine who had semi-retired him, not because of his age, but because she was barely having attacks anymore. So he was offered to me to see if it would help me get through the day. I worked with him and learned how to be a handler and then i started school. It wasn't easy, but my dog was there for me every time i needed him. He made it possible for me to get through an attack and get on with my day. It changed my life. I was able to complete all of my courses and finished my first semester of college. I was so happy after my last final that i just sat there and cried and held my dog. (people were stopping to ask if i was ok lol) Since then, i got my own dog (a border collie named Tonks who is 6 months old now) and have been working closely with a trainer to teach her to help me the same way that the first one did. I start classes on August 20th and so far, Tonks is more than prepared to help me. I am excited to face the world with my own little panic warrior at my side. I wish I could have known how amazing these dogs could be before all of this happened. I just wanted to spread the word and try to share my happiness with everyone else so that they too could benefit from it. I would love to hear your PSD stories and also i will answer any questions you have to the best of my ability (I don't know everything about service dogs, but i will tell you about my personal experiences).",,False,self,t5_2qnv4,False,,,True,t3_wvmxl,http://www.reddit.com/r/bipolar/comments/wvmxl/psychiatric_service_dog_the_best_thing_thats_ever/,

I'm a 27 year old female, and I've been trying to deal with having bipolar disorder (as well as several other ""fun"" disorders) for 10 years now.  I've only been on medication for one year, and that was when I was 23.  My dad keeps saying it's all in my head, and I could get over it if I really wanted to.  I have deep scars up and down both my arms (I haven't cut in 2 years! yay!).  

Where I live, you either see a shitty psychiatrist who will make you cry and tell you you're faking it (seriously), then refuses to prescribe anything because ""you don't have insurance anyway, so you wouldn't be able to afford it.""  Anyway, I saw him once after my first suicide attempt and never went back.

I've been manic for the last two months or so, and everything is perfect, until I start having sex with whoever will have me.  Today, when I woke up, I just felt like a huge boulder had been placed on my chest.  I've dealt with this for so long that I should know what to do when I cycle back to depression, but I'm totally clueless.  

I'm sorry.  I'm rambling.  I just don't have anyone in my life who understands and won't say ""oh, just come out with me! we'll have fun and then you'll be okay!"" or ""shut up, you're just making it up and trying to get attention.""

I'm unemployed and currently in school (had to drop out several times over the years because of mental breakdowns), so I can't afford to see anyone.

I've been unmedicated for much of the last 10 years, but the last two have been a nightmare and getting worse. Late last year I got to the point when I was pretty much never in a manic (10% of the time) or debilitatingly depressed state (the remaining 90%). I decided that if I couldn't solve it by the end of this year, there's no way I could go on.

Fortunately thanks to a caring and unbelievably patient girlfriend, I finally saw a pdoc earlier this year and I've been medicated with 100mg per day of lamotrigine. The change these last few months been truly incredible... I've got my life back and I can interact with people and my surroundings pretty much like a normal person. If I can be like this the rest of my life, I'd be happy...

...Except there's one little problem; it's utterly destroyed my short term memory, just like carbamazepine did when I was younger. Sometimes it's just about manageable if I take notes all the time, but at other times it's like living  in a haze and not knowing what I was thinking about/doing last. I often can't even complete sentences... and writing this has been so hard because I keep forgetting what I'm writing.

I'd almost consider giving up my academic career because the change has made my life liveable again, but I don't want to go out without a fight. Is there anything I can do to get my memory back?

Thank you!

A few years back I chatted on another bi-polar forum and it was a common question - how do I know if the rash I have is THE rash? 

Having had THE rash, I would like to share some photos and answer questions if anyone has them. A lot of medical professional don't even know how to spot or treat the rash (which isn't really a RASH per se, it's the start of a condition called Steven Johnson Syndrome) and not everyone who gets a rash will go on to have SJS - they are 2 different reactions. 

Here, in photos, is waht it looks like. I find this to be helpful since a lot of photos out there of SJS show it in it's later stages, not when it first forms.

[My arm, day 1](http://i.imgur.com/Qj3iU.jpg)

[My mouth, day 2](http://i.imgur.com/mLKII)

[My back, day 3](http://i.imgur.com/qnwWC.jpg)

[My mouth, day 3](http://i.imgur.com/WfIUS)

[My mouth, day 4](http://i.imgur.com/Z68Cr.jpg)

After that it just gets worse, like the typical photos of SJS you see online. The rash is fast growing, and even with stopping the medication you have to just let the reaction run it's course. The biggest tip off that it's SJS and not just a rash is that your mouth and nose are affected right away - the skin in them are one of the first to start dying and falling off, so you develop a really awful taste and bad breath. Second tip is that the rash HURTS. I'm not just talking painful itching rash, but like 3rd degree burns. By the end of the first few days of the rash, it will become very clear that you're not just fighting a rash, but something more. It's VERY IMPORTANT (I can not stress this enough) that at the first signs of a rash, you call your doctor ASAP, and if you start showing signs of it progressing that you get yourself to a hospital immediately.

oh and if anyone is curious what I normally look like, with out the swelling and marks, LOL here's me [Normally..](http://i.imgur.com/0QhEp.jpg)


eta - I'm not posting this to scare anyone away from their medication, but to ease peoples worries about the rash. SJS is very rare - about 6-7 in a million get SJS, and it can be caused by hundreds of different medications. However, having said that, for some unknown reason certain medications - like lamictal - tend to have a higher rate of SJS/TENS than other medications. The only other medication that has a higher rate is sulfa based antibiotics like bactrim. Not everyone who has a rash from medication like Lamictal will go on to getting SJS, but there are signs to look for so you can get treatment right away. I just wanted to let everyone here know, because no one warned me. I was told to watch for a rash, everyone mentions a rash, but no one talks about the fact that it's not JUST a rash.

I take my treatment seriously and am taking all my medication, but need an adjustment and have been trying to stay afloat until I can see a doctor who doesn't treat me like an idiot (I have a graduate degree, am financially independent, etc).

In the interim, things have deteriorated and I've been frankly losing it at home. Interestingly, I'm fine at work. My boyfriend told me yesterday that he never knows which ""me"" will come home from the office, one that hates him or loves him. It was devastating to hear but I know he's right. I already knew I was letting him down (I'm never in the mood for sex, I snap at him a lot) but that cut deep. I know most of this is my fault but I also wish he'd try harder to understand my illness and help me through it. Talking about it seems to irritate him, which in turn irritates me and leads to the snapping behavior. The cycle has left me wondering if being in this relationship is unhealthy for me right now. He's a great guy and treats me well, but I feel only guilt around him for getting sick NOW of all times.

To make matters worse, I saw that he'd posted a Craigslist casual encounters post for a 420 buddy this morning. He's new here too and aching to make friends but I never thought he'd do something so...well, wreckless. Even irrational me knows better. I trust him, and think that's all he's looking for but I can't believe I drove him to that.

I don't want to do anything irrational (in a lifetime of bipolar disorder, I've never had casual sex, done crazy drugs, spent massive amounts of money, etc) but I'm considering breaking up with him after he moved 250 miles for me (guilt, guilt, guilt) so I can focus on me and stop hurting him.

I need your advice. Please help me.

And then when later proven horribly wrong, acts like it was a fair mistake or that it was my fault for blindly trusting her. Which is how a relationship should work so whatever.

My parents have been lying to me for twenty-something years now with their empty promises and constantly fluctuating ideals. They'll tell me something is for something else I want to do but then just twist it all around. They appeal to my morals and then prove that they don't give a shit about my morals as long as it appeases their morals. Which are different.

I'm really sad though because....she completely understood me.  I have trouble communicating and she would totally understand my babbling.  I'm having to quit because I'm graduating.

Guys, in three weeks I will have my master of science degree in clinical and counseling psychology.  I have a job set up.  Therapy is THE best thing I could ever do for myself (and the meds).  

Lesson: Get help when you feel you need it. Fuck stigmas. Do what's best for you. It's your life, live it for you.  Get the help you need.  It took me 6 years to get my BS, then 3 extra years to get my MS.  Yea, I didn't graduate on time.  So what. I did it, didn't I?  And that's what counts!

I am: a daughter, a great sister, a good counselor that will become a great one with practice, i'm creative, i am a wonderful friend, i am a person that i would be proud to know, i am a pet owner, I'm funny, I am a good listener, I strive to improve myself, I'm pretty, I'm loving, I'm caring, I'm giving, I'm respectful, I'm passionate, I'm mannerly.  I HAVE bipolar I disorder, generalized anxiety disorder, PTSD, hypothyroidism, and polycistic ovary disorder.  This disorders do not define them.  Don't let them define you.

I've been severely depressed for about 3 years.  I once had treatment, but I lost my insurance.  I've been living like this unmedicated for 3 years now.  Because of this, I only have a part time job where I work once a week.  I make about $300 to $400 a month.  I have no life and think about killing myself everyday.

A few months ago I found light at the end of the tunnel.  An insurance  by the federal government called PCIP for people with pre-existing conditions was available.  All I needed was to do my taxes to qualify.  I finally got around to finishing my returns and was ready to sign up for the program.  This is what I found on their website:

""Beginning February 16, 2013, the federally-run Pre-Existing Condition Insurance Plan (PCIP) is suspending acceptance of new enrollment applications until further notice.""

My heart sunk.  My hope lost.  I've applied for state run mental health treatment before only to be denied.  I didn't qualify.  Apparently I wasn't considered a severe case.  How severe does one have to be?  I can't function in my day to day life.  

So I'm thinking to myself what happens now?  Is there anyone that will help me?  Why me?  Why must I suffer this way?  I see other low income individuals get treatment for other diseases.  Why is mental health so different? Am I doomed to be like this for the rest of my life?  What's the point of living if you can't feel joy?

**Edit**: A lot of it has identifying information so I don't want to share the whole thing. But part of it, the part that made it a great accomplishment, really pulled me back up out of the abyss I was in.  


I asked that they read these two separate quotes at my funeral. The first is by a cosmologist, the second a translated quote from the Spanish film Pan's Labyrinth (which I recommend watching immediately if you never have; it's beautiful and I think it kind of saved my life). Parts not in quotes are written by me. 


*""The amazing thing is that every atom in your body came from a star that exploded. And the atoms in your left hand probably came from a different star than your right hand. It really is the most poetic thing I know about physics: You are all stardust. You couldn’t be here if stars hadn’t exploded, because the elements - the carbon, nitrogen, oxygen, iron, all the things that matter for evolution - weren’t created at the beginning of time. They were created in the nuclear furnaces of stars, and the only way they could get into your body is if those stars were kind enough to explode. So, forget Jesus. The stars died so that you could be here today.""  
~Lawrence Krauss*


*I am not afraid of death.   
I am afraid of dying, scared that it will hurt,   
scared that there will be something I regret.   
But I'm not afraid of being dead.   
For billions of years, for most of the universe's timeline,   
I did not exist at all.   
And it wasn't so bad.   
I'm grateful that for one little blip of time,  
I was thinking, breathing, feeling stardust.*   


...


*""Many, many years ago in a sad, faraway land, there was an enormous mountain made of rough, black stone. At sunset, on top of that mountain, a magic rose blossomed every night that made whoever plucked it immortal. But no one dared go near it because its thorns were full of poison. Men talked amongst themselves about their fear of death, and pain, but never about the promise of eternal life. And every day, the rose wilted, unable to bequeath its gift to anyone... forgotten and lost at the top of that cold, dark mountain, forever alone, until the end of time.""    
~Ofelia, Pan's Labyrinth*

*I believe that eternal life lives in the last moments of death, that those seconds can stretch out into eternal bliss. I found my peace, as Ofelia found hers while her life slipped away.*

Being in my mid-twenties, this is the last thing I wanted to do, but I essentially had no choice. Herein lies the biggest issue with this: I am diagnosed with bipolar disorder and I choose to work through this unmedicated. I do not have control over the highs and lows, nor am I seeing a counselor for help right now. A few months back I was seeing a counselor who wasn't qualified to help with mental health issues (his words, not mine), and it kind of just ruined the experience of ""asking for help"" for me. 

One of my parents is also bipolar. As far as I know, there is no ""formal"" diagnosis, but it is very clear, and has been clear, through the years that they are suffering with bipolar disorder. It made my upbringing very difficult and our relationship was very much strained for many years. Knowing this, I did my best to bite my tongue and keep to myself when I moved back home. 

Sometimes I just. can't. take. it! 

When I make a snappy remark in return to something nasty being said to me, suddenly I am at fault with the other parent, and need to learn to ""humor"" this behavior. I'm talking rude remarks being made towards me regarding my appearance, my behavior (even if I'm sitting in my room alone), etc. just for laughs. I can tell that these are the manic episodes. Defending myself becomes out of the question. I'm yelled at for not humoring this behavior followed by the bedroom door slamming. Constantly. I don't know what's worse though... the manic phase where I'm being picked on, or being around someone who refuses to get out of bed or come out of their room. 

It becomes so intolerable because I'm fighting so hard to keep my emotions to myself through this. I don't yell. I don't slam doors. I don't make nasty comments. And I pull myself out of bed on the days that I would rather sink into the comfort of my blankets and pillows and never get up again. This tortures me more than dealing with being bipolar on my own.

Aside from moving out, which I plan on doing as soon as I have more money saved (it would be nice to save money if I could stop spontaneously spending it during manic phases!), does anyone have any advice on how to deal with this? Talking about it with my parents is almost out of the question because of the denial that THIS mental health issue exists. 

Does anyone else have experience with having a parent or SO or close friend with bipolar disorder, too? How did you cope? 

I apologize if it's annoying that I didn't specify the sex of the bipolar parent. I just really needed to vent/ask for advice before I lose my head.

**tl;dr** Living with a bipolar parent and being told to ""humor"" them instead of anyone admitting that there is a problem, and getting help.

I feel sick.  I feel like there is no hope.  I feel ugly.  I feel pain.  Last week it got so bad, I just called in sick to work.  I don't know what's worse.  Calling in sick and proving how unreliable you are, or going to work with a bad mood proving what an awful person you are.

I tried motivating myself to keep moving.  C'mon, get up.  You got to make yourself some money.  Remember, this is your goal.  To be independent, to have the things you want.  To travel the places you desire to go.  But it didn't work.  I even go so far as to get in the shower, get dressed, put my tie on, only to relapse into another spiral of hopelessness.  

I'm worried. I had to stop taking my meds over a year ago because they stopped working and I have no insurance to re-visit the doctor to get new meds.  I don't know how much longer I'm going to keep this up.  I'm afraid I might be collapsing at the seams once again. I'm scared about Monday.  I'm scared about my future.

I'm not worried about getting fired.  I have sales job which means I'm mostly my own boss but I do have to come to sales meetings.  If I don't work, I don't make money.  That's what I'm worried about.  And ultimately, if I don't make money they can terminate my contract.

**Edit:**Well it happened. Couldn't wake up this morning to make the 7 a.m. meeting. I was asked to leave. I haven't event talked to my supervisor. got the text this morning. For those of you are wondering if this is legal, the answer is yes. Its not even a real job. Its a sales job which means I work as an independent contractor. Honestly, I didn't want to do this job, but right now it was my only choice.
I''m not sure what to do now. This is a serious blow to my self esteem and is going to effect me for quite some time. If I can't work, I can't make money. If I can't make money, I can't get insurance. If I can't get insurance, I can't get treated. I will be in the same pisshole tomorrow as I am today. Nothing will change, and there's little reason to go on like this.

There are just a few quirks, you know? I don't sit very often at all, and even when I don't point it out (by reflex I assume people notice and so I try to put it into conversation to explain it and let them know it's just more comfortable when I'm already standing to run from whatever the fuck is going to destroy me) people will say, ""oh, you can sit!"" and then I have to explain when I sit down all the delusions become so apparent I'll start crying. But I don't say that.


Oh, and then it totally started getting worse! I was diagnosed over two years ago and took my tranquilizers, and got very ill. Took my anti-anxiety meds, Buspar and whatnot, and thought it was all a joke. I never thought I was bipolar until utterly everything was torn to shreds.

Stimulation of any of my senses becomes distorted and will scare me into flight mode, adrenaline coursing through my viens at top speed. I'll shake, hyperventilate, everything at noises, or smells, that feed my delusions. I'm terrified of everyone except for one person whom I feel as if I'm letting down by being so emotionally weak- but I've fought this delusion for so long and there's barely any effect, and I feel as if I'm a brittle glass pane on a frozen day. I'll break at the slightest touch, whether it be in kind, to take me to the warmth, or in malice, to shatter me. I'm so sensitive to those who love me, and to those who hate me. 

Everything is becoming more and more unnerving. I can feel the judgement of others tickling the back of my neck with butcher's blades. The hate and malice that flitters in the night sky sees me, the weakest link, and dives for the kill. The good people in this world are slowly being broken by those who blindly lay intolerance and insensitivity everywhere in this world. 

It's like my mind is finally breaking. I ignored everything. Every bad experience I had I just buried. But they're coming back as hallucinations and delusions- I feel as if I'm paying for everything I ignored that hurt me by having my subconscious destroy my daily life.

I got out before my 72 hour hold because they said I showed good judgement in getting myself to the ER and the doctor there was friends with my Shrink. The place wasn't bad at all, the groups really seemed to help a lot this time.

I have been taking lamitcal for 2 months now and I feel great.  For the first 3 weeks or so I was pretty low.  At first I thought it wasnt working and making things worse but my psychiatrist said that that is normal.  So if you feel low for longer than normal at first know that it is normal and you will feel more stable as time goes on.   Yes I still have ups and downs but they are nowhere near as deep or high as they used to be and to tell you the truth I am up more than I am down. This is contrary to what I used to be.  I used to go about a week being down and like 2 days being up so I couldnt keep things constant such as jobs or relationships.  I am feeling a lot more stable and it is great.  I have been up for a week and a half now and its incredible and only down for a week.  This is an improvement because the amount of up time has increased.  I am finally able to lift consistently and work my schedule for work.  I have missed maybe two days out of 2 months because I ran out.  This is the #1 thing you can do.

During the relationship they seem too ecstatic for words and invest everything they have in that person, convinced they are ""the one"", but in time eventually lose all interest and sometimes very rapidly.  I worry this behaviour will never end and often experience the fallout.  I've tried to understand what is going on from an outsider's point of view so I can support them, because they often don't want to talk about things and I wouldn't want to make them feel uncomfortable pressing.

I've read quite a lot of literature on manic depression (so as to be better informed about my friend's condition), but from my own observations on both my friend and another who is manic depressive I have some thoughts which I'd like to run past you.  Please don't be offended!

My theory is some bipolar suffers (like my friend) self medicate their condition using love.  I think they try to achieve hyperthymic or hypomanic phases, when they are at their happiest, creative, energetic, alive, and respite from horrible depressions.  I believe those phases can be triggered using the lovely neurochemicals associated with new relationship energy (NRE) and love : oxytocin, seratonin, dopamine, norepinephrine etc.  So they meet a person who ticks some boxes, convince themselves they love them, invest almost everything you have in that person (in my friend's case about 99.99% of their focus, which is where everything else blurs myopically and which often gets them in trouble), which fuels the neurotransmitters and makes them in love, ecstatic, happy and hypomanic for a while.  They're so happy and they project that glorious energy and intensity that they've gained back onto the source of their happiness (the significant other), which makes the S.O. feel great.  The trouble is it appears the NRE neurochemical hit eventually wears off and they can no longer get that medicinal trigger they need and the depressive cycles return more frequently and the hypomania is lessened.  This leads them to eventually discard that person so you can fully concentrate on a NRE hit from someone/where else, creating a cycle of love addiction.

Does this behavioural cycle resonate with anyone here?  Any suggestions?

I also have relatively severe OCD. I had never considered OCD to be a part of what made me, well, me. It was a disease in my mind, a glitch in my brain that I still am trying to exterminate or at least deal with better to help me cope with life. It was seperate from me, I could deal with it in that sense.

I'm currently very depressed, basically bed-ridden. I feel as though I've lost credibility, lost myself. The hopelessness keeps building.

They told me that out of 60 applicants I was in the top 5 and that 2 of the 5 were ""over-qualified"".

Whether I get the position or not, it has helped me to realize that I have value and can take this and go further. Should I get it, they will train me to take over for a guy that has been the mouthpiece for the corporation for 40 years. They have locations in the U.S., Vancouver and Wales.

Fellow polar bears, keep your chins up and shoot for thing's you want but don't think you are worthy of doing! others see some of our qualities as benefits, so please, if you will, cross your fingers for me, for if I do achieve this position, it will truly change my life. 

You guys are the best and I love many of you just from your personalities you show on here. You guys are fabulous.

I am anxiously awaiting and should know in a couple of weeks, I will update either way, but promise for no dramatic piece if I don't get it.

**Edit** Well, I did not get the job, was called and informed today. They said it was down to me and another contender, they made an offer and it was accepted. Meh, you win some and you lose some.

What I mean is that you don’t have the option to determine what it affects and what it does not.  Wouldn’t that be nice though?  I sign a contract with my brain and the mental illness agrees to only rear its ugly head in this, this, and this area.  Everywhere else is off limits.  If I could to that I’d simply sign a contract with my brain to not have it at all.

It is so difficult to have to view every moment of one’s life through the lens of mental illness.  There was once a time when I could remember what it was like to not have that lens, but it has been so many years now, I believe the memory has faded.  One thing to always remember is that the choices you make affect your illness and your illness affects the choices you make.  See, it’s cyclical.  And what really stinks about bipolar disorder is that we live a life of extremes so long before we find stability, by the time we get to a place where we can poke our heads out at the world and consider joining it, we no long know what is acceptable and what is not. 

 For example, we tend to be very long term in our tolerance of abusive relationships or even those that are simply not good for us.  There is little to compare to.  It is difficult to tell someone to hit the road when they have suddenly gone from adoration and long term hearts and flowers to MIA and wanting occasional visitation rights when you don’t really understand what behavior should be excused and what should absolutely not be tolerated.  The reason for the lack of understanding is that you don’t know whether what you feel is accurate or inaccurate, because you often experience emotions as extensions of a mood disorder that prove inaccurate.
Often I have done something that I perceived to be very rational and middle of the road only to find that my loved ones are shaking their heads, asking me why I would do such a thing.  In my mind what I have done is nothing compared to what I know I’m capable of doing.  When such times occur I find I am shaken a bit in my confidence.  I feel as though I’m in a dark room blindly groping for a light switch.  I suppose I could give up.  I could withdraw completely from relationships and have pretty much done so in the past, because I do not always trust myself to be a good judge of character, and for this reason I do not trust others.
  
I do not have answers for this.  I am struggling to accept that what I see in the world is hell and gone from what most people see who do not deal with mental illness.  This is where God intervenes…well he intervenes on several levels when I let him.  But this is where I believe he intervenes and helps me learn, for I do not believe I would without him.  I know too many individuals who can’t get away from their choices long enough to learn anything.  I know God does this for me.  And when I accept what he shows me I get to do the most amazing thing…I get to move on.  So friends, here’s to moving on, may we all be able to take our little bipolar lenses and move on.

1332970499.0,16,self.bipolar,ri6ot,"I'm a bit nervous about travelling for spring break.  I asked Google for help, and came up with this article about making a Bipolar Travel ""Toolbox.""",17,1,10,http://www.reddit.com/r/bipolar/comments/ri6ot/im_a_bit_nervous_about_travelling_for_spring/,"You can read the full article [here](http://www.practiceofmadness.com/2011/01/traveling-bipolar/), but I weeded out the information about the ""toolbox"" and am just going to copy/paste it here.

**Something to listen to.** I bought a hypnosis down load and put it on my iPod. I used the hypnosis recording two or three times before I fly, or use anything which is usually very crowded – like London Underground. Then I get it ready to switch on to calm me down when I’m boarding and getting seated on the plane, or entering the underground. My recording is specifically about phobias and irrational fears. You can get them on all things, cheaply all over the web.

**Something to smell.** I find smells can calm me down and/or set up to  panic. If  someone close-by smells sweaty or unclean that could set me off. Now I have a tool to combat it. I purchased a roll on oil which has lavender and bergamot in it. It’s my fresh air when I feel stifled.

**Something to taste.** I choose fruit flavoured boiled sweets. Might sound weird, but I can feel sick or nauseous if stressed, and I find a hit of sugar helps. Also, you have to suck the sweet, which give you something to focus on – like its taste, how small it is getting, and the texture of it on your tongue.

**Something to drink.** Water – Everyone should travel with a bottle of water anyway. Plane travel especially is very dehydrating, and if you’re prone to panic, you need to hydrate often and stay away from caffeine (in coffee and pop and tea) and alcohol of course. Although, I once treated myself to a shot of Jack Daniels, before landing, but it wouldn’t have had time to reach my system till after I’d left the plane.  

**Something to cool me down.** I choose a hand held fan – mine is very loud though. Try to get one less annoying than mine! I only use it if a feel especially breathless or stifling hot. It helps! Wet wipes which smell of lemons are also a less annoyingly noisy option. 

**Something to warm me up.** However much I loathe being too hot, I also loathe being cold. I take socks and a cardigan or light coat. Or a jumper/sweater. Some airlines offer blankets, which is nice too.

**Something to calm me down.** Although my hypnotherapy down load helps, I still choose to take some calming pills before I board – either natural (mine are natural and from the web – I bought loads after Portugal) or get something with a bit more kick from the doctor.  I prefer to remain as close to ‘normal’ as possible though. Especially if I’m travelling alone.  According to what you’re taking take them appropriately. Don’t overdo it! I take three an hour before boarding and I’m fine.

**Something to read/do.** First and foremost, something I take everywhere: My marvellous Kindle, which is cram packed full with books to read. It totally works to occupy me if I’m engaged within those lovely digital pages BEFORE I board, because then I can usually get right back into it on the plane. It really helps me get through that awful stage where everyone around me fusses and fights over luggage locker space, getting to their seats and whatever else people do (why do they have to take so long to sit down – aarrgh?). This is my worse time and the time I’m most likely to panic.",,False,self,t5_2qnv4,False,,c0c0c0,True,t3_ri6ot,http://www.reddit.com/r/bipolar/comments/ri6ot/im_a_bit_nervous_about_travelling_for_spring/,

Here's a weird question. I feel like all my life, even before I started feeling the depression, I have had some tendencies that are highly bipolar... for instance, obsessions and irrational mood swings. 

I am extremely obsessive about writing. Once I wrote a 90,000 word novel in 10 days. Another time I wrote an 80,000 word novel in 13 days. I have several other similar ""records"" with writing. Over the course of the last 5 years, I have written 13+ fiction novels, totaling more words than the entire Harry Potter series.

Also, I have had dramatic and unexpected vacillations in my feelings towards people. I once dated a boy that I'd had a crush on for a full year. I was as happy as could be with him for three months. Then all of a sudden, over the course of a few days, he became repulsive to me. No idea why. I dumped him and was so ashamed of ever being with him that I didn't talk to him for three years.

These behaviors seem pretty bipolar to me, but these things happened at least 3 or 4 years before I felt the depression starting. So my weird, round-about question is... is it possible that I was having bipolar symptoms all my life, before the real ""onset"" a little over a year ago?

After we married it was like a new person came home. All of the sudden I was smothering her but in all honesty I changed nothing.  She withdrew from our families and started to neglect or dogs, myself and the house. She began drinking, crashed our brand new car, continued to drink leaving me stranded at work many times and now has started to take off for days at a time not telling me where she is or when she will come back. 

She tells me she's withdrawn and cannot stand to be home. She's become verbally abusive and will snap at me at the drop of a hat. I'll admit I have not handled it well. I could not understand for the life of me how she could just turn off her love and affection toward me. I did not cope with it well and I'm still having trouble. I feel helpless and useless.

She brought me back from the abyss Friday. :),16,2,2,http://www.reddit.com/r/bipolar/comments/1f23tc/i_love_my_amazing_fiancee_she_brought_me_back/,"Things got dark on Friday afternoon.  I was about to go into a major depressive state.  I tend to cycle quickly, but my depressive states have gotten more frequent, and far darker than ever.  The last time I had a depressive state I hallucinated, and that was the first time that happened.

Friday, I felt it coming.  Does anyone else get that feeling that seems to rise up from your insides, like you're locked in a ship and the water's rising and there's nothing you can do about it?  You know it's coming - mania or depression - like some urgent sense of impending doom?  That's where I was.  It's like that slo-mo YouTube video where the giant cruise ship is about to crash into port, and all you can do is watch the inevitable.  And the tears came...

My fiancee saw it coming.  She rubbed my shoulders, and slowly put her nose almost against my nose, trying to get me to look into her eyes.  She wasn't aggressive, just calm and slow.  She was trying to keep me from doing what we call ""leaving,"" which is me going to a bad place (high or low).  She just kept whispering, ""Please don't leave me, baby.  Don't go there.  Fight.  You can fight this.  You're strong.  You can do this.  You have to fight for us.""  One would think this could be annoying, but it was this soft whisper, almost void of emotion, just relaxing, like my own internal cheerleader.

I could feel the hallucinations coming, and I wanted them to come.  I wanted to wear them like a blanket.  But I wanted her more.  She made me want to fight.  The episode still sucked, but she reminded me that I had a will.  It may be raining, but I have an umbrella.  It may be a broken umbrella with a few holes in it, but I can use it.  It's mine, and I can fight.

I don't know what I did to ever earn her love, but I do believe I'm the luckiest man in the world - even with this stinky stupid disease. :)",Amazeballs,False,self,t5_2qnv4,False,,darkgoldenrod,True,t3_1f23tc,http://www.reddit.com/r/bipolar/comments/1f23tc/i_love_my_amazing_fiancee_she_brought_me_back/,

I was angry and lashing out, so was he (and I have the scars to prove it :). Especially after his domestic buddy died too early, and he refused all others.

Long story short (long story in r/rats), my sweetheart rat died in my arms yesterday morning. Fucking traumatic, to say the least.

Had to deal with a complete douchebag via email (won't go into it, but trust me please, if I did you would all hate hate hate him too). SO out of town for the weekend (so no crutch, no ballast). Decide to actually (gasp!) request a Rx of ativan for the weekend (not a month! not a week! a fucking weekend), only to be told that my prescriber is gone for two weeks and since I don't have 'benzodiazapines on record', the MD on call can't prescribe. REALLY!

So, I end up with a cocktail of benadryl with a wine chaser and a really, really fucked up weekend.

(my moods change 1-2x a week.)

For example: I got in a fight with my now-ex bf a month or two ago, I was so angry and yelling at him for a day or two, then super contrite and apologetic, then belligerent at him again... obviously he was upset that I kept reacting differently and I didn't really have an explanation. I still don't know what is the ""right"" or ""rational"" way to feel about it. Does that make sense? As a result I've let people say and do things to me that I never should have allowed because at the time I was afraid that standing up for myself was just an irrational thought.

tl;dr how do I know myself better and get more in touch with what's a real and valid emotion, and what's just depression/hypomania talking?

This morning he wakes up playing the victim card, blames me for how had I not done something fucking two years ago, he wouldn't had been abusive. So the abuse is my fucking fault. I have no fucking affection for him anymore. He says he doesn't love the woman I am today, he loves the woman he fell in love with ~2 years ago, but any time I bring up divorce he cries like a baby. 

He is not helping my mental stability. And then wonders after a week of not having sex why I don't wanna jump on his dick or find him sexy.

Basically, I became friends with a really nice guy about a year ago and he told me right away that he was bipolar. I didn't know much about the disorder at the time, but I made sure not to treat him any differently than I would my other friends.

Our friendship started off nicely, he was always kind to me. Unfortunately, as we got to be closer friends, he wasn't always nice to me any more. Sometimes he would have bursts of anger, or be crying when we were together. He is rapid cycling, and I'm not sure if he takes his medication regularly. I still try my best to be supportive of him and to make sure he's okay. This is pretty difficult for me because I am relatively unfamiliar with how to deal with issues like this (which is why I am asking for help).

I suppose the real problems started coming to us when we would drink together (we are both in college, so this happened a lot). Alcohol seemed to amplify whichever mood he was in and whenever I was intoxicated I wasn't able to deal with situations as well as if I was sober. Some of these nights we would spend being romantic with each other, and some we would spend arguing for hours. One of us would usually end up crying.

A couple weeks ago, I told him I thought it would be best if we stopped being ""friends with benefits"". I could tell he didn't actually want a relationship with me and I didn't want to lose his friendship. I think this made him angry and we got into a very big argument. I tried apologizing afterwards, but he just ignored me. He has ignored me for about two weeks now when we used to talk at least a couple times a week. I know sometimes he ignores me when he is depressed, but I can't tell if this time it's because I hurt his feelings or he's really angry at me.

I know we both like spending time with each other, and I don't want to lose his friendship over something silly. 

I guess my question is: Should I keep trying to talk to him or would it be best to leave him alone? I'm really trying to understand how he thinks better so that I know the best way to deal with these situations.

Oppositional defiance being one of the big buzzwords at the time, schizophrenic-tendencies being at the far end of the diagnostic spectrum, but at the forefront, there was always: bipolar/unipolar.  It seems like they could never make up their minds.  

I spent the majority (well, I spent 95%) of my formative years locked up.  Either in a juvenile detention facility or a psychiatric ward of (insert treatment facility here, I've been in most major ones in Arkansas and one in Texas).  I'm 29-years-old this year, and even though my treatment ended a little over a decade ago, it's still something that (more or less) haunts me.

The first places I went, they intentionally overdosed me on whatever medication I was taking at that time.  (Blood-work would reveal *less than satisfactory levels* and they'd up my dosage by a factor of 5 or so.)  So to restate the previously stated, while I spent the majority of my childhood institutionalized, I spent the majority of *that* time period in a constant state of being poisoned by my doctors.

I've attempted suicide twice in my life - and by attempt, I mean *would have succeeded had I not been rushed to the ER*.  Once in my childhood, and once in my adult-life, both overdoses.  The first overdose was the strangest experience of my life - reality warping in on itself, people and places vanishing before my eyes, thoughts becoming tangible objects and tangible objects becoming nothing... the 2nd overdose landed me in a 2-day coma.

I've got hundreds of scars on my arms from cutting, one of them extremely deep (and, ironically, the only one that bled the least).  

A decade later, and I am still constantly reminded of my disease.  I don't go out much, have all but withdrawn from society, and I hate people.  But I think my **one** saving instinct is this total sense of apathy I have to - well - everything.  

I stopped cutting, not because I was able to seek and find help, but because I grew extremely *bored* of it.  After the last suicide attempt (the coma), I stopped trying.  Not because it of some sense of futility; I just got *bored* with it.  That, and I started actually trying to find **something** to deem worthy of actually trying to live for.

I don't know why I'm telling you all of this.  But I can offer some advice, however impractical or asinine it may be.

I've been on seroquel steady at high doseages for about a year now, and the result is that I've always taken myself off the medication (in the past, i've been on and off for nearly ten years) because I find stability so 'boring'. Most people enjoy the little swings of emotion between baseline and happy, and have these little rhythms of emotion that define their existence. However with bipolar you have these huge extremes of emotion and often it seems like nothing compares.

The average happy feeling is just nothing compared to the that euphoric mania. And so after awhile I think we don't recognize the smaller emotional swings in our lives because they barely show up on our emotional radar.

I know that a diagnoses of bi-polar isn't something to call a victory, but I'm 26 and only just started college. Despite my intellect, I did only well enough to just pass in grade school. I've always had trouble holding down jobs. I got labeled lazy and unreliable. It's not that I'm lazy or unreliable, but to someone looking in from the outside, like an uncle that only sees you not in school and in and out of jobs, it's too easy for them to play judge and jury.

When I found out my father was bi-polar when I was 18, I started to research it myself and it sounded very familiar. But anytime I considered it with a friend or family member, most of the time I was treated like a hypochondriac or as if I was exaggerating my problems. Sometimes I would actually get a lecture on what bi-polar *actually* is and why it didn't apply to me.

Over the last two years, I've known. My anger is too explosive, my depression is too deep, my anxiety is too disabling and my highs are far too annoyingly high (to me and to those around me). So when the doctor said, ""I agree with your diagnosis. I am going to diagnose you as bi-polar,"" I felt vindicated. It's not like anything about me changed, I am who I've always been and I've known about this for a while.

My wife of 13 years was diagnosed a few months ago with Bi-Polar Disorder. The diagnosis explained much about the problems we’ve been having the last 3-4 years as a result of recession imposed paycuts and job changes which ultimately ended up with me re-enlisting in the military after a long break in service. It also explained much about the crazy, fun times we had as a couple during the first half of our marriage. (On a related side note sex with an attractive, outgoing, bisexual, apparently bipolar woman can be insanely exciting and satisfying…)  Of course, the problems this condition causes when untreated finally had me hit my breaking point a few months ago and after I was told (once again) to “not come home from work” and I didn’t. 

To be clear, her condition manifests primarily with these symptoms: mood swings, negativity, lashing out, hypochondria, slight financial irresponsibility (slight because we have very little money or credit these days), and narcissism. She’s not self-destructive (though she did a lot of drugs in her 20s before I met her) or any danger to our kids. 

Since her diagnosis I’ve moved back in.  I’ve started my own therapy and she’s asked me for at least six months to get her medications dialed in and her own therapy a chance to work….but I don’t know if I’m already too far gone. We have two kids (5 and 8) and frankly they’re the only reason I even want to try…I’m a very involved dad and I can’t imagine being away from them. But it doesn’t change the fact that I have a LOT of resentment built up from the years where I didn’t speak up or was more adamant about her behavior. I have what my therapist calls ‘escape fantasies’ more often than I think I should. I’ve developed feelings for other women…nothing I’ve acted on but I feel like I’m missing out… After two months I don’t see a huge change except that she doesn’t have as many mood swings as she used to. We haven’t had sex in months and I don’t feel a desire to be intimate with her at all right now. 

Am I wasting her time and mine? How long before I can expect to see more significant changes? Or is this it and I have to decide whether or not I’m willing to be a caretaker for the rest of my life? And if I decide I can’t do it, what kind of douchebag does that make me? I don’t intend to belittle the condition or those that have it so please don’t take offense.

They're all waiting to watch me fall.

Fairy wings flutter quietly

Is my sanity gone?  Can you still see me?

Watercolors drip down the crisp white page

Each drop whispers of my internal rage.

The black keys ring in the velvet night.

Together they make a little tune

Hope falls with the raindrops down from the sky

The raindrops that come from my heart as I cry.

And when I wake up from this rose-colored dream,

The fairies will be gone, no longer able to hear me scream.

The monsters will enter from stage right

I trip and I reach and I run in fright.

He'll whisk me away to those familiar lands.

Today I received an ""invitation"" in the mail through this company, telling me I ""may qualify"" for a ""medical research study being conducted in (my) area.""  The letter then directed me to a ""patient recruitment company('s)"" website (AcurianHealth), in which I would be directed to give detailed information about my condition(s)-the carrot being potentially ""qualifying for up to $800 compensation"". Lo and behold, when I went to the website, the study was on (ta daaa!) ""depression"". 

One of my prescriptions is welbutrin. 

Now, at the bottom of the letter, it states ""No information about you has been provided to (recruitment company)"". Hmm. 

So, I called Walgreens corporate office and asked exactly how, if no information was provided about my prescriptions, did this company know to send me this particular ""invitation""?  I was told that while they don't provide any information to the company(or companies) they are paid by, they do go through customer prescription histories to find ""potentially eligible"" customers for these companies. 

I find this a really unethical and disgusting practice, and it pisses me the fuck off, because OBVIOUSLY now this company has my name in their files, tagged as (at the very least) using medication to treat depression. How exactly, then, is this not providing any information about me, exactly?

When I asked whether I could be removed from further similar commercial solicitations culled from my prescription information, I was told that they could only remove me from *any* mailings, no matter what they were. So, all or nothing. I opted to be removed.

I guess I just wanted to vent. I'm sure every pharmacy chain does this, as it generates quite a bit of money for them (they get a fee for each mailer they send out), but it just feels like such a violation.

This morning, I stepped outside my front door to cut some hyacinth blooms to put in a vase.

After walking about halfway down the little sidewalk to the front door, I saw a squirrel, just a few feet away. No big deal-I mean, I raised an orphan squirrel when I was in college, after all!

I said something silly like ""Oh, hey there little guy, aren't you cute!""
And he started. scampering. towards. me. *quickly*

Immediately my brain yells ""RABID SQUIRREL! GOING FOR YOUR BARE FEET! RUUUUN!"" So I made a little pathetic squeaky fear noise and hightailed it back inside, peeking out the window, expecting to see a frothy mouthed mini-beast clawing at the door.

My youngest son was standing behind me, with a questioning look in his eyes. 

""Um, yeah. I just, er. There's a squirrel out there. He was, um...running towards me.""

I look out the window again just in time to see this poor little guy obviously freaked out and racing up a tree to safety with what I swear was a ""wtf just happened there?"" look in his little face.

My son's reaction: ಠ_ಠ   ""A squirrel? You ran inside...because of a...squirrel?""

So evidently someone in the neighborhood has been hand feeding squirrels, and this little guy heard my ""Hey, little fella"" tone and probably thought ""PEANUTS!"" and came close for the expected treat and instead ended up scared witless. :(

He left his car unlocked outside his and my dads place of work with his wallet and phone inside and has been walking around without a coat in the cold. he has resisted my attempts to tell him that these symptoms sound like textbook mania.  

I am bp2 so have never experienced anything like this.  currently he is with my dad going on about all his newfound divine knowledge no doubt. advice anyone?  even if we can get him to see a psychologist I'm not sure what they could do if he's not willing to believe anythings wrong. thanks and AMA.

Apparently this started happening last Friday.

He has been working out alot, more than he ever has.  And he admitted to taking human growth hormone for 4 weeks.  (not sure of the implications of this since I dont know much about it)

I tried my best to listen to his thoughts without being judgmental but while also reiterating that I think he is manic and needs to see someone.  He eventually started becoming hostile to that idea and that I dont believe his prophecies are true.

Update:  Brother is staying at my parents for the night. My dad took him to the psychologist and the psychologist suggested that he is possibly bipolar or schizophrenic.  Unfortunately he refuses to take meds.  My dad is aware that involuntary confinement might be where this is headed.

Watched one of my close friend's try and drown herself in a bathtub and vomit her brains out when she got too drunk. I didn't see it specifically, but my friend says there was black bile or something in her vomit that is a sign of using heroin, and I know she's struggled with it in the past. Now, apparently she's pregnant. Went to visit my Uncle a few weeks ago. He proceeded to shed light on how close he came to dying a few months ago. How he was going to stab himself, but called a suicide hotline and didn't. The hotline operator then called the police, and he came to the door with a fake BB gun in order to have the cops shoot and kill him. They came real close, but he dropped it. Nowadays he can barely afford the medication they put him on. He said he was doing good, but that he still struggles. All my friends from college seem non-existant. They're either too far to hang out with, or don't care to know how I'm doing. One friend that I was pretty close to won't even talk to me because I pretty much led her on. We didn't have sex or anything, but things got hot and heavy for a little while, and I didn't mention I didn't want a relationship with her until a few weeks in. Everything seemed fine until a week or two before the semester was over. She started being really bitchy and snappy at me, stopped trying to talk to me, all that stuff. I attributed it to her problems with depression and anxiety that she had to leave all of her friends for the summer, so I dealt with it. A few weeks into summer a friend of ours has a party and she comes to it as well. I try to be friendly and whatnot, but she didn't seem that interested. Then her friend tells me that she's been angry with me for a while now and needs time to cool down still. This makes me sad because I know I did something shitty to her, but it also pisses me the fuck off. Why didn't SOMEONE tell me? I've been kept in the god damn dark this entire time. I would have apologized earlier if I had known that was the case. But no one told me, she hates me now and won't talk to me. I don't have many people that I can trust to talk to, and one of them won't talk to me and the other is one I need to talk about. I'm trying to better myself over the summer, quit smoking, play guitar, start working out and all that jazz but I can't stop laying in bed and getting caught up by my thoughts and feeling so incredibly pissed off, angry and depressed.

I basically called my friend a bitch and a cheating cunt last night while drunk (the most I've ever been). It was supposed to be a stress-free night that ended with both sides raging at each other and her crying. Goddammit. 

I was incredibly stupid in my reasoning for feeling that way. Something little set me off and I went from happy-go-lucky, to depressed, to angry, back to depressed, then back angry before I let her have it. I can't seem to be happy. I can't seem to stop myself from taking out my hate for myself on others, especially the ones I love. I excel at pushing people away. Now I might lose another friend who's been nothing but helpful and understanding because I made a stupid decision and let something little and stupid get to me. I will never get that drunk again.

I want to be the best friend I can be for this girl, because she's been the same for me, but I'm my own worst enemy in this endeavor, and I have no idea why other than I hate myself. I hate the fact that I feel like a failure. I hate the fact that I can't seem to stand up for myself or be assertive. I hate the fact that when I do, it ends up hurting people and pushing them away. I hate the fact that my life is a big steaming pile of shit. I hate the fact that I have the emotional maturity of a five year old. I hate the fact that I can't maintain any meaningful relationship. I hate the fact that I never learned to control myself. I hate the fact that I feel like I'm set in my ways. I hate the fact that life has made me bitter. I hate the fact that I just might end up like my dad: bitter, stuck in a job I hate, and just settling for what I can get. I hate the fact that every time I try to make a change, I can't seem to keep that change going. I hate the fact that if I do have change, it's almost immediately taken away from me by my own hand or by circumstance. I hate the fact that I seem to be subconsciously seeking approval, love, and affection in all the wrong places. I hate that I seek sympathy instead of actually changing anything. Finally, I hate the fact that I hate myself.

On top of all that, my meds keep me from really releasing any emotion. I'm deadpan, and I know I really need to cry or something. I feel like the biggest pile of shit because of what I did, but I can't really feel it. It's frustrating.

Unfortunately, or maybe a bit fortunately, I was diagnosed with anorexia and bipolar in the same week. 

Years ago when my anorexia really *took over*, I got down to a pretty low weight. I stopped menstruating, I became really sickly, I was depressed, and all sorts of other negative side effects presented themselves. I don't know exactly when it ""changed"" but I now have issues with a binge/starve cycle. I will starve myself for days before going on a couple of days long binge. My doctor questioned what a ""binge"" is to me, and apparently I don't fit that ""criteria"" but a binge to me is eating much more than I usually do in a short amount of time to make myself feel full. Only then comes the starvation period again. On and on and on. 

When I really analyze the pattern it seems to be in line with my manic/depressive phases. Sometimes I have mixed moods and feel two ways about binging or starving. Currently, I feel the need to stuff myself and eat poorly. I've been doing well in life, but some things are missing that make me feel depressed or stress me out. When I feel good about things or triggers aren't worrying me, I stop binging and start starving. 

Part of me (disgustingly) wishes that I could just starve to that low weight again, while the other part of me wants to just be healthy already. Unfortunately, healthy to me is having to see my bones and *look* thin. So most medications for bipolar are completely out of the question for me because I refuse to gain any weight that I can't easily lose. I'm currently on tegretol because my psychiatrist prescribed it to me because he thought it might help, plus he told me it wouldn't make me gain weight. I'm not sure if it is working on its own because I still feel these dips of depression and highs of mania through the leveled out feeling. 

tl;dr:
Anyone else suffering from eating disorders and bipolar? Do you see a link between the two? Does anyone have any advice on how to cope with this?

After a week of calling in sick to work, I was finally let go.",15,2,8,http://www.reddit.com/r/bipolar/comments/16l0h3/well_it_happened_after_a_week_of_calling_in_sick/,"My first feeling of course was that sensation you feel when something awful has happened.  Like your throat has just swallowed your heart and is now burning inside your stomach.

I received it this afternoon through text.  I haven't even talked to my supervisor yet.  I know what some of you are thinking.  Is this legal in the U.S?  The answer is yes.  I was working as an independent contractor, so they are basically just terminated my contract.

I had taken a break from this job to focus on something else that actually brought in a lot of money.  When I tried to go back, I couldn't switch from a night schedule to a morning schedule.  I'd wake up feeling like complete and total shit and the anxiety was overwhelming.  I was paralyzed by my own thoughts.  I called in sick everyday because I just couldn't get up.  There was even one time where I was going to get there late, I got up, showered, got dressed, put my tie on and then the anxiety swept over me like a tidal wave.  I couldn't move forward.  I was pinned by heavy debris created by my own mind.

What happens now?  My first thought is suicide.  I can't imagine living my life this way forever.  I graduated in 2011 hoping to finally find a good job with health insurance.  Since then, life has been a literal nightmare.  

My meds that had been working on me for 10 years suddenly stopped doing their magic.  I couldn't function.  I couldn't properly search for a job.  When I would get interviews, I would do poorly.  I felt brain dead, aloof.  I remember one time I was asked a question.  I literally froze.  It took me about 2 and a half minutes to finally answer the question and it wasn't a great answer.

I had to move back into my parents home because of this.  It was the only place I could go.  It made me much worse.   The environment here is toxic.  There are 3 bedrooms here, one bathroom and 7 people trying to occupy the space.  I sleep on the couch which is the worst thing for someone who is bi-polar.  I can't get any sleep because I can't sleep at night and get constantly woken up early in the morning  by people who don't give a crap that I suffer with this disease.  

My father is an alcoholic.  He doesn't work.  He doesn't talk to me nor anyone in the house.  He drinks beer all day and stays in his room. Its so bad he even got refrigerator for himself so he could avoid having to pass through anybody on his way to the kitchen.  He's got a serious problem and won't admit to it.  Every once in a while he tries to start a fight with me.  He'll call me lazy and stupid.  He'll try to run me out, by demanding that I leave.  He's even threatened to call the cops on me several times.

My sister lives here with her 2 kids.  She doesn't talk to me nor the family either.  She's been convicted of marijuana possession. This was not some dumb mistake she made while she was young, no, It happened when she was 30.  She hasn't worked for several years.  She's abusive and neglects her own children.  She leaves to party every night while my mother takes care of them, even when they are sick.  Sometimes, she doesn't feed them and they end up eating cereal or potato chips for lunch.  Her son wets his bed.  Many times, she's put him to bed without changing the sheets.  The boy sleeps in his own urine.

There's my brother.  He's cool I guess.  Nice guy, smart.  But there must be something wrong with him too.  he's 26 years old and he's gone to school for 8 years.  The strange thing with him is that he has taken nothing but music courses the entire time he's been there.  In fact last semester was the first time he ever took a basic course.  He's not interested in the least to graduate and seems to be quite happy where he is.

Finally my mother.  She's the only one in this family who works besides me. And she works hard.  I don't know how she does it because I would have liked to inherit those genes.  She leaves the house around 6 in the morning and comes back at 8, sometimes 9 at night.  But the big problem with my mom is, she allows everyone in this family to behave in the ways that I've mentioned.   She allows my father to continue being an alcoholic.  Even though he abuses her, she still picks up and cleans after him, does his laundry and serve him food.  She doesn't talk to him, she doesn't pressure him to get a job, she doesn't say anything when he abuses the rest of the family.  She allows him to live his life in his happy little bubble at the expense of the rest of us.  

She does the same with my sister and my brother.  She allows my sister to neglect her kids and go out and party every night.  Recently,she gave her a car even though she knew full well that my sister is driving with a suspended license.  When I asked why she did this, her excuse was, ""Because the kids won't be able to go to school.""  I told her there was something called a bus.  She said, ""Well, they would have to wake up early.""  She allows my sister to neglect her children so that the kids wouldn't have to wake up early.  What kind of logic is that?  

She allows them to destroy themselves, and I think she's even done it with me, although, I do my best to help my mother out anyway I can when I am healthy.  I've worked hard to actually get a job so she doesn't have to support me too much.  But being in this chaotic environment is slowly killing me.  I have enough money to move out, but I don't have a steady income.  I'm worried I will not be able to find a job.  Plus, I've got a $40,000 student loan bill to pay.

So you can see the type of predicament I'm in.  There was a time where I was living at California on my own.  I remember I was happy.  I was working, I was independent, and I was doing something that I loved.  This was when I was on the meds, and they were working.  Going back to school had to be the worst decision I ever made.  I see myself now and I wish I had stayed over there.   

I have no job, no health insurance.  I've even tried to get state funded insurance but I didn't qualify for the services I really needed due to budget cuts. I'm tired of lying to others because of the serious stigma associated with being bi-polar.  I'm tired of this never ending cycle of pain.  I'm living a nightmare and I only see one way out.

Then I hold it again and count to 70. I keep repeating - usually about 10 times - until I get back to normal. I just keep holding my breath and punishing myself until I am forced to realize that I am acting irrational and that I should let the small things go. One exercise usually isnt enough which is why I do it about ten times. (Believe it or not 150 seconds makes you feel like you've just gotten hit my a bus).

I've heard a lot of ""things will get better"" and ""we just have to keep trying meds until we find the right combination, which we will find, guaranteed"".

He was diagnosed as bipolar midway through our relationship when I encouraged him to seek help. He stayed on meds for only a couple months. He also struggled heavily with substance abuse (opiate painkillers and alcohol) and lied about it for years.

Whenever we would break up, which only happened two or three times before, it was because he would have these ""episodes."" Now I am not sure if what was happening is symptomatic of bipolar disorder or not. He would have uncontrollable fits of rage sparked by something extremely miniscule, harm himself (cutting his arms up), and say horrible things to me. Often, the next day, he does not remember the episode. He is also usually drinking when these things happen (but since it is abnormal behavior even for someone who is drunk, I am confused). Is this typical of people suffering from bipolar disorder? These episodes are what scare me the most because they are unpredictable and extreme.

I need closure. This weekend he destroyed our new apartment. When I tried to barricade myself in the bedroom, he kicked in the door and unintentionally hurt my foot. He smashed glasses everywhere and overturned the bed. As he packed his things to leave, he screamed unspeakable things about me, calling me every name in the book. After he left, I called the police.

I found out he was arrested tonight. The police pressed charges against him. They are strongly encouraging me to get a restraining order. One of the charges was domestic assault and battery. I am feeling guilty now. This all blew up very quickly. Am I overreacting? Should I drop the charges?

I am sorry if this is a disorganized rambling mess, but I am having a hard time thinking clearly after all this.

UPDATE 10/25: Thank you everyone. Your comments were all so helpful and provided a lot of perspective. Getting advice from friends and family members can only go so far because they are so unfamiliar with what I have been dealing with for years.

I got a call from the DA's office today saying he had been arraigned. I asked about my options, and apparently the state is pressing charges. In addition, the police officer was the one who pressed charges against him initially, not me. Apparently this is how it goes in cases where the officer suspects abuse. So I do not have now and never did have any control over the charges. The DA's office did want my opinion and said that it could sway the case.

The World Doesn't Know
The world doesn't know this, but every day is a fight against the voices, a struggle to keep them at bay. For a long while (sometimes its a week, sometimes its months), you don't really hear them; they're too faint and probably still exhausted from the last time they tore through your defenses. But as they regain their strength, the tormenting words increase in frequency and the number of times you see yourself losing control in your head builds.

At first its a glimpse of being quick to anger and yelling, ""Fuck you"" at someone who really didn't do anything wrong. But then it grows and suddenly, you see yourself screaming and lashing your hands out in hopes of something breaking (like a lamp or a window or a cup) so you yourself don't have to. You're frantic and your voice is shrill and you see yourself acting like a zombie from Left For Dead, except you're not flesh thirsty or decaying, you're just incoherent and crazy and mindless. You're smashing a computer screen with your fist, over and over you're shouting for them to get away, and you're cutting your wrists with your own finger tips. Because look at this worthless you- you can't fight against it and that voice is whispering, ""You know, you're supposed to kill yourself, it's the only way your story is supposed to end."" so matter of factly that it's hard to argue anything against it.

All this is in your mind's eye but the line starts to blur, and suddenly you aren't sure if you're acting out the possibility for real or not. So you jerk yourself out of it, try to keep control. Because picturing it is like being stuck in sinking sand- the possible realities will drag you under until they're the sole reality, and unless you keep control, everyone will know. And they will look at you and they will recognize that something is off, there's a part of your brain that's uncontrollable, which is absolutely terrifying. So you pull back, push away the thoughts until they're just scratching behind your eyes and you keep them there with a smile on your face and joke to your coworker.

Words of hurt, words that would immediately be regretted, (why-does-your-brain-want-you-to-say-them?), words that you honestly, truthfully don't want to speak struggle against the restraint of your throat. They're bitter but they don't leave your tongue until they've clawed their way out of your mouth, but at least you're alone now so the only one who burdens their abuse is yourself, and that's better than him or her or them.

You're trembling and sobbing and incoherent, mumbling sporadic words that don't always string into full sentences, but when they do they're bible verses or song lyrics or something along the lines of, ""You aren't worthless, you aren't."" because that voice keeps punching words at you to convince you that you are, constantly slams you over the head with them and your head hurts and you're exhausted from fighting.

But you don't stop, because stopping means grabbing something sharp and blood and giving up. But if you do that then you won't be able to find your purpose, and there's no way the only reason you're living is to fight this mental battle and feel worthless- you refuse to believe that because what's the point of having fought this long if its true? You fold your hands in a prayer, that's the only way to stop nails from scratching your thighs, your arms, your neck, and whisper bible verses and hymns and ""you can get through""s.

The voices and the pounding have torn you down, because you can only stand against constant screaming, punching and hatred for so long until you're worn thin. But they tire too, and they aren't nearly as strong as they think they are or as you, so they retreat to the dark places of your mind to build up again.

In their absence, you build up too, and you're happy and content because a battle's been won. They'll be back, but that only means that you're still here to greet them, which is the most optimistic thought you've had for a while so you bathe in it and smile and the world is non the wiser.

I was thinking we should make a bipolar mixtape. Everyone gets to contribute 1 song and I'll edit this post to add youtube links to all the songs. It can be a song that is about bipolar for you or just a song you really love, but please share your reasons for including the song as I like to hear stories about how music touches people.  I'll start...

**1.  Ray LaMontagne - Crazy** - TeslaBoyGangsta

""I have always loved the Gnarls Barkley version of this song as I think the lyrics are so true, but then Ray covered this and his raspy voice plus the starkness of his acoustic guitar just took the song to a whole other level for me.""

**2. Nujabes - Highs 2 Lows** - BirdMav

""captures the essence of bipolar I feel like.""

**3. Dixie Chicks - Landslide** - SweetJade

""As a person with Borderline Personality Disorder and Bipolar with a mother who has her own issues (undiagnosed Bipolar is my guess) this song helps me feel I can move on. Having grown up walking on eggshells it helps me step back and reflect that I am doing the same thing and still can move on.""  

**4. Rilo Kiley - Better Son/Daughter** - SlashaSlim

""I like to play this song for family and friends so they can understand how I feel.""

**5. Aesop Rock - One of Four** - j313 

""I get pretty heavy depressions/mixed episodes, and this song really speaks to me.""

**6. John Mayer - Not Myself** - lamingtoncroissant

""I find it explains very simply how I feel going into a relationship.""

**7. Klima - Flourescent Stars** - Coolbritannia

""Pretty much how I feel most of the time. ""

**8. Laura Marling - My Manic and I** - ApathyToTheMax

""I Don't know, I just love it.""

**9. Youth - Daughter** - Sporie

""I had discovered this song shortly after trying to commit suicide, just around the same time I was diagnosed. The line that really struck me was ""If you're still breathing, you're the lucky ones"". When I heard that, it breifly broke the zombie-like fog that I was in. It's very personal to me since I tried to drown myself. I felt lucky to have lived through what I did. ""If you're still bleeding, you are the lucky ones, because most of our feelings they are dead and they are gone"" was another line that really struck a chord in me. The highs and the lows I've lived through were, and still are sometimes distressing, but it just reminds me to appreciate that I have the capacity to experience such variety. The tone of the song in general seems to be about heart break, which is relevant to me at this time in my life since I've just been broken up with by someone with whom I was extremely fond of, someone who could not fully understand or handle what I was going through, which was a depressive state. Through the blatant heart break theme though, there's a prevailing theme of being appreciative of what is still there, and that's what really comforts me and gives me hope when I listen to this song.""

**10. The Kills - Cheap and Cheerful** - dabbleinlife

""If my mania had a soundtrack it would be this song. ""

**11. Lee and Leblanc - Beautiful** - Wormswormsworms

""There's a ton of songs I could mention, but to pick one in this moment...""

**12. Missy Higgins - Nightminds** - 8srs9

""Explains how I feel and reminds me how my girlfriend is there for me. Sounds cheesy but that's why!""

**13. The Classic Crime - Beautiful Darkside** - Whimsical Realist

""I heard this late last night while lying in bed and it was just.. too accurate.""

**14. James Blake - The Wilhelm Scream** - an-actual-lemon

""Things haven't been very easy for me lately but finding this sub has really helped brighten up one of the worst days i've had in a while. I don't feel so alone with my problem anymore. I hope this song helps others on here as much as it has helped me.""

**15. Blue October - X Amount of Words** - quietmind2014

""the song x amount of words really hits home for me.""

She started talking to strangers in public, to an extreme degree, and sleeping only a few hours a night. We started getting into huge arguments where she accused me of irrational things and then refused to justify herself. She started making huge decisions all of the sudden--she came home one day and said that she'd found a house that she wanted to buy and was already talking to a realtor, without us having seriously discussed buying a house at any time in recent memory. Basically, she was showing (what I would later learn to be) the classic signs of mania.

It started to get worse. She was so distracted all of the time that she didn't have enough attention span to eat, or do her work. She lost over 10 pounds in less than a month, and her performance at work got worse and worse. Her coworkers and administrators began to be afraid for her (along with all of her family and friends, who've all noticed drastic changes in her personality), and while she recognized that she was being ""manic,"" she didn't think it was a major issue, but at my urging she tentatively made plans to talk to a psychologist. She saw her once and had an unproductive meeting, so she didn't go again. Our marriage continued to get worse despite my efforts to be patient and loving.

That same weekend, shit hit the fan. Her mania reached a peak and she had a total nervous breakdown in public. At the urging of a local crisis hotline, I called 911, and she was sent to the hospital for the night. By the morning, she had calmed down significantly (due to antipsychotic drugs, mostly), and she came home.

Later that week, the same thing happened again. I didn't want to call 911 (I know she hadn't like her experience in the hospital), but I felt I had no choice--she was out of her mind on the mania, not speaking coherently at all, and I was terribly worried for her. They took her away again and decided to keep her for 72 hours. While she was there, they gave her medication to treat her mania (mostly Seroquel, I believe), and while I believe it reduced the symptoms a bit, it made her feel physically uncomfortable.

When she got out, she was adamant about never taking medication to treat her illness again, and she hated my guts, blaming me for sending her to the hospital. The following week was hell; it was an almost constant onslaught of verbal abuse and stress (not to mention confrontations where she got violent and physically lashed out at me), and I've been trying to counter her anger with love and calmness, although it's really taking its toll on me. All while I've lost sleep and stayed up late to do her work for her so she wouldn't get fired from her job.

She is still manic, although recently there has been some rapid cycling, as well. She has begun hiding my own possessions because she doesn't trust me, and has claimed that *I* am the bipolar one, and that everyone around us is paranoid about her and just doesn't understand her. She still refuses to take medication, telling me she will NEVER take anything and that the problem isn't serious enough for me to even worry about it. She has been taking self-prescribed naturopathic medicine (L-theanine and GABA), and it's not improving her symptoms at all, although she believes that it does. She says she'll see a psychologist again, but she hasn't made an appointment and I'm unsure if it will actually happen. And she's said that she'll leave me if I ever call 911 again when she's freaking out (she told another friend she'd kill herself if I ever called 911 again). 

I'm at a complete loss as to what to do. She's in denial and I can feel our marriage crumbling around us no matter how hard I try. What the heck can I do? Before this all started we were happy, in love, and basically had great lives going for us. Now it feels like a living hell... Any advice would be appreciated.

TL;DR: My wife is constantly manic now and I miss the person she used to be.

**Edit**: Two pieces of extra information I left out, which might be useful to know:

1) We've known each other for 9 years now, but this flare-up is just now happening. I believe it started when she was depressed this past winter following surgery which made her less active and have to go to PT. It wasn't *severe* depression (I've seen much worse in my family), but she was depressed. It was soon after she had recovered from this depression that the mania started to kick in.

2) I agree that I need to see a psychologist as well; this has been very hard on me. I've made an appointment for this Tuesday to start seeing someone regularly.",,False,self,t5_2qnv4,1339957583.0,,,True,t3_v6oim,http://www.reddit.com/r/bipolar/comments/v6oim/i_want_my_wife_back/,

But the lying, the deception... it's really upsetting. I don't want my own friends to look at me as someone to protect, someone to look down on. Let me stand up, stand alone, stand on my own two feet!

My life is undoubtedly harder, my emotions are amplified, but I'm not a fucking invalid.

I'm a little lucky, I guess. I've had a few people tell me that they really respect and admire me over the last year or so. People who have absolutely no idea that I'm bipolar, or what goes on in my mind. It's touching, and my self esteem is at a point where it's high enough to believe it, but still low enough to be absolutely astounded by it.

But these things... these little things... feeling guilty, feeling inferior... those are the things that play with me in a way that it's stopping me from living a solid, ""normal"" life.

Tonight I have a lot of spare energy to burn, so thought I'd use it for (hopefully) good and not evil.  A Beginner's Guide!

Just recently diagnosed? If so, I think it's safe to say that what you are currently experiencing anger at the audacity of such a definitive ""label"" slapped on you, fear and distrust of the medications and side effects (not to mention the very idea of taking them for the rest of your life), and perhaps most painful of all, the idea that these things will steal away that which makes you, *you.*

You know you are different. You have always felt there was something about your processes that held you separate from most others. Yes, bewildering at times, and yes, sometimes causing you to spin utterly out of control like a brilliant hurricane. And yet. This is what defines you. And now you have been reading that it's a defect.

First, I think there isn't a single person on this subreddit that hasn't gone through these stages of anger and disbelief when first diagnosed. I know I did. I fought it like hell and gave my psych a run for her money. I am an artist, and my best work was always done in a state of obsessive, all consuming periods. I slept little, ate little, and lost myself in the beautiful frenzy. That was the good part.

The other part, however, was not so elegant. It was agitation, uncontrolled rage, and poor decisions. As I'm bipolar 2, it was also a lot of time spent in a dark, dark corner of my mind. This too, though, was mine. Deep depression can be it's own rather sadistic comfort, turning the world into a monochromatic abstract, distant and muted and numb. But very, very comforting in a way that no one that has not experienced it can ever understand. Again, this too belongs to you and you alone. Myself, I fought to keep it like a jealous lover.

It took months and months before I was able to step aside and take an objective look at my life, and what this illness has done. Both the things I did and regret, and the things I was not able to do, and regret. The way I isolated myself, and the pain I caused those who love me most.

And when I had finished looking, I made my decision. I would agree to try the medication, with the understanding that I would be in control. I would decide whether they were working, and if not, to either try another or stop. This feeling of control helped immensely. Remember, *you have final say over your treatment.* 

It took a long time to slowly titrate up enough to feel the effects of the medication, but I stuck with them. I continue to argue with my extremely patient psych. And I find myself finally, finally on the other side of the looking glass, what do I see?

I see a stability I've not had before. My mind is focused, and I'm not constantly questioning myself. I'm not hearing the constant internal voice of self hatred and suggestions to self harm or try to mute them with alcohol. If my illness was like a lover, then I was/am finally able to see that it was an abusive one. I am no longer paranoid, no longer jumping from one extreme to another. No longer spending weeks in bed, unable to brush my hair, take a shower, change my clothes. I am finally understanding the term happiness.

Please keep in mind that google can provide valuable information, but it can also serve up a vast quantity of bullshit and false, misguided, and downright ignorant pseudo-information. Learn to read things concerning bipolar illness with a critical eye, because much of it will be outdated or outright untrue.

Ultimately, it does not matter what ""They"" say. What matters is that you find someone that you can trust to guide you through the lies and misinformation-both the ones this illness tells you as well as the ones the charlatans try to pass off as truth. Remember that statistics can be manipulated and twisted for maximum sensation value. After all, it makes for good reading, doesn't it?

Remember that you are not defective. Medication will not steal away that which makes you *you*. Bipolar gives us a unique perspective on the world; several, actually. This will not be taken away. The good parts remain, just not the terrible heights and paralyzing lows.

Also, read through this subreddit. I have learned so much here, most important is that I am part of a group of very intelligent, insightful, creative people that share experiences that I thought were unique to myself. It's amazing to finally feel as though I amongst people that truly understand me for the first time ever.
I hope you'll stick around and when you feel comfortable, post your thoughts and comment away. You are safe here, and when you feel you have no one around you that can possibly understand what you are going through, come on by and rant away. Guaranteed, we'll understand *exactly* where you are coming from.

These amplified and caused extreme versions of some of my symptoms, such as feeling completely numb, increased suicidal thoughts, hallucinations and mood swings. The GP then pushed me to see a Psych to ensure I received a proper diagnosis.

2 months ago I was finally diagnosed with Bipolar and I have started Lithium in conjunction with my anti-depressants. I can't emphasis how much the lithium has been able to balance me out. For the first time in a long time, I have a clearer head, and I don't suffer the usual horrible headaches, numbness or general loathing of life. Whilst they symptoms do exist still, they are no where near as bad and have enabled me to finally take control of my life again.

So in short - if you are on your journey/path to finding a way to live with this illness, don't give up on all the drugs if one doesn't suit.

Someone behind you is having your head dunked under water. Maybe they're a friend, playing with you and will let you back in a second.

Each time is different and the dread of the next one and not knowing makes it worse.

 

This is what it feels like, to me, to have Bipolar disorder. You could be in an up phase, or a down phase, but the anxiety persists no matter what. This is what many people live with on a daily basis.

 

Something I've noticed while having this disorder, is a summation of what it feels like. And it's terrible, but you learn to live with it. So when people accuse you, or strike you for your moods, they can't even fathom whats really going on inside there.

Why can't people just acknowledge it as an illness? I was sick one year and lost an incredibly close friend. Because she thought that's how I was. I was freaking sick!

I'm not looking for pity, just understanding. I'm open about having bipolar disorder to my friends, but have never come across somebody who I could really share things with. I had a good friend once who was open about being bipolar, but she was a very sad person and took out her problems on other people, so I couldn't really rely on her. I've had a few other friends with anxiety and depression issues, and I took some comfort in helping them through the worst of things, but too many crossed my own boundaries and weren't there when I really needed them. These were problems with the people, not the nature of the disease, but it's so disheartening.

This may sound silly, but I wish I knew somebody like myself. I try very hard to manage my condition and come across as normal, but I'm very self-critical and never entirely content with myself. Some days I want to open up to the first person I see, just so they could hug me and tell me it was going to be all right, but it's so hard to open up to people.

I hope things get better. I used to want to die, but don't anymore. I used to want to lay and bed and cry all day, but don't anymore. I'm on better now, and I want to live and do things. But the business of living is difficult, and it's hard for me to connect with people. I want to accept myself, and be my own friend first, but am not quite sure how to get there, and sometimes I feel like another bipolar person could understand me. Whomever you are, I hope that somehow you will understand my words and what I go through every day. It's a Saturday night, and I'm going to go out with some of my friends, but I would rather stay in and work on my BA thesis than be the lonely girl at the party.

Anyway..
She's 27, I'm 32. We've been together for a little over 8 years now and have had a lot of great times and I really love her and want to be together with her for as long as possible. 
She has always had periods of depression, but mostly short ones (a few weeks at most), and the expressions from them have often been aimed at ""non-people"", people she doesn't really know or need to know. Random strangers doing something she doesn't like etc.

But now it's much worse then ever before, she's been down (with a few good days, but mostly bad) for about 2 years now. This has lead her to sitting inside a lot which also has lead to her not getting that outlet towards these ""non-people"". 
It has instead started to be aimed at her friends and family first, then my friends, then our mutual friends, and lately myself, which I kind of understand since my mother has become very sick and I haven't been able to be there for her (my gf) in the same way for the last few months. So, troubling circumstances.

I know it's not ""her"" saying and thinking these things, and many of our friends understands this as well and are still with us. But the last few months it has started to affect our relationship in a serious way, she says these **really** mean things that hits you right in the heart, and it's beginning to get hard to just accept it, it's still her saying it..Sort of. I've started to get mad, instead of trying to calm her down in whatever way that at the time seems fit.

I'm trying to get her outside again. We've bought a puppy, go on vacations, help her with her interest in painting (buying her supplies, taking her to museums for inspiration, encouraging her etc) and all of these things have helped a lot, but that final push into ""not crying at least once a day""-land seems hard to reach.. 



Have you been in a long depression and (sort of) got out of it?
Did anyone near you help? In what ways? What would have helped, even if no one did it?

Anything I can do or say to make her ""think different"" in those really dark moments? 
Things I absolutely shouldn't say?

What should I do if I'm feeling I get mixed signals? For example ""I don't want to be touched""/""You never touch me"", both said in the same day. I've told her that I feel that way, which only seems to lead to her disliking me even more, so is there anything else I rather should be saying?


AskMeAnything if you need more info that could help. Any tips/thoughts/links to earlier threads on the same subject are all very appreciated. 

Sorry if anything is unclear, english is not my first language, if so, just let me know and I'll try to explain in another way.

Then somewhere down the line a few months into our friendship i start getting possessive when they hang out with someone without me i get offended and hurt so badly, i get paranoid that i did something wrong and i get so scared. ill text them and ask if thy are mad at me. if they dont reply quickly i become frantic and text again and again. ive gotten to the point that ive driven by their house to see if they are lying to me when they say they are gone or somethign and cant hang out. its so scary i actually hate it so much because it always destroys these friendships and it hurts so bad. But i cant stop it. Its not a scary obsession other than that, id never do anything extreme because i cant bring myself to be a full on creep but i just get so hurt and overly emotional


apart from that i tend to create so much drama. ill long for attention and comfort from this person that ill make up problems just so they will feel bad for me or comfort me. ill make up stories that will hopefully interest them. ill buy them things, do anything for them


it kills me and i hate that i do this but its like i cant stop. i hate hate hate myself for it and i scare the people away so much that im so hurt in the end and fall into the worst depression",,False,self,t5_2qnv4,1369215202.0,,,True,t3_1etpcu,http://www.reddit.com/r/bipolar/comments/1etpcu/question_for_those_with_bipolar_do_you_ever/,

Us bipolars read and listen to music differently. It affects us differently. Listen to the right song and you instantly feel recharged and ready to face any challenge. Listen to the wrong one and you end up being depressed and wanting to die.

Even if you're not into the band I'm sharing, just take a listen. I think the lyrics and the style of hardcore interchanging with melodic choruses is the best musical interpretation of what being bipolar is like.

The songs are even sung two different ways and played 2 different ways. Both styles showing both ends of the spectrum and what it's like living with this monster inside you.

Beauty and hope and redemption juxtaposed with anger and depression and pain.

If so, when do you tell them, and what do you say?

I always tell good friends I'm bipolar—basically anyone who I think is important enough that I want them in my life. Four reasons: (1) none of my life story makes sense without mentioning my illness, (2) sometimes I like flake out on account of the crazy, and it's important to have the people I love understand that so they don't get too freaked out, (3) a lot of my friends are of the insane or traumatized persuasion themselves, so if I tell them we can help each other, and (4) some of my bi-polar stories are pretty badass and hilarious, though of course they were terrible (tragedy + time = comedy, ya feel me). I usually tell friends during the big ""so what all fucked up type a shit has happened to you/have you done?"" conversation which we inevitably have whilst drunk or high. It's a ritual of mine.

Recently I started seeing this guy (I am a human male, by the way), and he's fucking amazing, and on our third date, I told him about my past. I didn't want him to not know what he was getting into. Luckily, he seems to understand (might help that he's into neuroscience and shit like that, and that he looks into my eyes like a little puppy).

Do you guys/gals tell? How long do you wait? What the fuck do you say? I just explain to people, like, the brain is an organ like any other... I've been on meds for four years... My disease has given me a perspective on and love for life I wouldn't trade for health... And people seem to get it. But I always worry I'll tell the wrong one and it'll come back to haunt me.

(Peer reviewed links inside!)",14,2,12,http://www.reddit.com/r/bipolar/comments/18xjz2/bipolar_sunlight_and_you_why_you_should_care_peer/,"Good evening, /r/bipolar! There's a lot of recent information most people with Bipolar Disorder have been in the dark about (no pun intended) which I thought could help you guys. Before deleting/skimming, every claim I make will be backed up by an NIH study- so kindly give it a chance! I am not a doctor, nor will I portend to be one- hopefully this will just be a little helpful to you guys.

It's a theory that's been floating around for a long time that seasons affect folks with Bipolar Disorder, but little empirical evidence existed to support these claims. Lately, though, with the advent of modern science taking Seasonal Affective seriously, there's finally been some interesting developments in this area. Back in 1995 [this study](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8541932) provided a fundamental basis for the claim that Bipolar is affected by the seasons. Following it were many others, including [this](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22085482) that debunked the claim. Despite the conclusive nature of the last study, there continues to be consistent [emergent data](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19909672) linking peculiar melatonin, internal clock, and circadian rhythm genes to Bipolar Disorder. So if it's not seasonal, what gives?

Well, since studies on SAD began, a common overlap between the characteristics of SAD and BPD became apparent in a [big way](http://archpsyc.jamanetwork.com/article.aspx?articleid=493246). There are countless articles linking the two- but the funny part is many of the researchers have postulated in individual studies that people with SAD may exhibit the tendencies of mild BPD (cyclothymia) with a general lean towards hypomania, but fail to report it or tell a mental health professional because hypomania is [chronically undereported] (http://books.google.com/books/about/Drug_Induced_Dysfunction_in_Psychiatry.html?id=pol0204fqjIC) and only about 20 percent of cases evolve into full blown Bipolar Disorder. The common traits consistently appear to be in abnormalities of the circadian, rhythm, and internal clock. Why is this important?

These set of characteristics allow for the use of [""light therapy""](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15800134) to treat SAD- specifically, there exists some sort of abnormality that drastically increases biological response to the presence of sunlight or sun-like light (""light boxes""). Indeed, in [studies done by the NIH](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17950467), there exists mounting evidence it can be utilized across many types of mood disorders for treatment as adjunct therapy with medications:
&gt;This analysis of randomized, controlled trials suggests that bright light treatment and dawn simulation for seasonal affective disorder and bright light for nonseasonal depression are efficacious, with effect sizes equivalent to those in most antidepressant pharmacotherapy trials.

that is [significantly faster alone](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9609674) than equivalent therapy with antidepressants alone, again, across the mood disorder spectrum.

So why aren't people breaking open light boxes across the nation? Well, only certain groups within distinct mood disorders respond to treatment so drastically well- so while it may help someone afflicted with treatment resistant depression, many would rather not spend money on light therapy. Why the hell am I telling you all this? [Bipolar Disorder](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18076544) is one of the few broad spectrum disorders where a [*majority*](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3181775/) exhibit this awesome response. In fact, it's often so effective that the primary concern about its use in Bipolars is the possibility of inducing mania. However, in that last study, it shows that people who were on a mood stabilizer (lithium, specifically), had a drastically reduced rate of mania versus people not on mood stabilizers exposed to light therapy, and an even greater positive response (even greater!) while being empirically and consistently better than placebo (as previously outlined in a study).

So: to summarize: there exists a metric ton of evidence proving light therapy can be overwhelmingly effective in *most* patients. I am by no means insinuating everyone should go out and buy light therapy boxes; however, it is worth investigating with your doctor to see if it's something that could help. Remember: as previously outlined in multiple studies, it can reduce the side effects of an existing regimen, while adding few or no side effects of its own, while also increasing the efficacy of existing medications and reducing the incidence of depressive episodes.

In a easier to read, list format, light therapy can do the following (as detailed in linked studies):

* reduce side effects of other antidepressants and reduce the time it takes for an antidepressant to reach full efficacy, including SSRIs
* improve sleep patterns and reduce delayed sleep phase syndrome, insomnia, and other sleep disorders common in BPD and other disorders like ADHD or depression, as well as improving overall quality of sleep
* reduce severity of depression episodes in BPD, as well as overall duration of said episodes
* improve mood while not *necessarily* inducing mania, though this can occur
* provide support for rough winters and offset schedules that yield reduced exposure to sunlight, which can be stopped without any discernible rebound period

**tl;dr: Light therapy is worth a look, it's backed up by countless studies and can really help some folks. It can reduce the severity and frequency of depressive episodes without adding a complicating chemical component to your regimen. Even if you can't afford light therapy, keep this in mind when you're feeling down. A little sunbathing can really improve your day or week, in a very real (and not subtle) sense, way better than any vitamin or herbal supplement ever could. It's biology!**

Maybe some of you can strongly relate to these emotions and experiences

About a week ago I took a shower at 3:00 in the morning and while showering I began to feel… incredible. Invincible. My eyes were open I felt as if I was finally moving in real time, like there absolutely no lag between my movements, my thoughts, my emotions. My brain and everything about me felt in sync. I wanted to do things, so many things, but I couldn’t handle that many things at one time. I began to work on Spanish homework that was well overdue but I only got one page done before I became bored with it and decided to do something else. I organized my room, finally got all my clothes into a pile, neatened up the things lying around. I watched a few episodes of scrubs and ate some…    the feeling soon went away…    I didn’t want it too, I never want it to. I want to feel like that every single waking moment of my life. I could do so many things, and are so many things I want to do I can’t even make a list. But once that feeling goes away all those tasks seem daunting, I feel I can’t handle any of them, I’m scared I’ll start and not finish, try and then fail. 

This feeling…   is indescribable. I’m giddy, I’m amazing, I’m smiling for absolutely no reason and I feel like hugging everyone in the world, I feel like I could find the cure to cancer if I worked hard enough. My thoughts, crystal clear, tasks are so neatly organized in my brain, I can decide what exactly needs to be done and what I’m capable of doing right at that moment and man I fucking do it. It’s uplifting, it’s amazing, I reach levels of thought so deep and so provoking, I wish everyone could comprehend what I’m thinking right then! Everyone else seems to be moving so slow, infuriating slow, why aren’t they accomplishing anything? But who am I to say, when I’m not on one of my rare highs I’m don’t want to anything other than the small amount of things that interest me right now, and normally those things will not help me in the long run.

I’m intrigued by drugs. Inducing another state of mind and being able to control it is fascinating, to observe from the inside how my thought processes change, how I reach other levels of thinking. marijuana became monotonous, I now know what to expect each time I smoke, it’s no longer a taboo for me to explore. Though on occasion it’s enjoyable to smoke and just enjoy the slowed down thoughts. I do notice every single chance in my mindset, my perception of things. I notice energy levels, motivation levels, anger and irritability with each passing hour, be it from my medication, caffeine, pot, nicotine rushes, common amphetamines(though I haven’t had those in a while due to my addictive nature, I’m smart enough to stay away from it). I use to experiment a lot with drugs, but I’ve held back on that now, I know that they could drastically affect my mood stability. Aside from “experimenting” with drugs, sometimes I used drugs just because I felt like being self-destructive, smoking cigarettes non-stop, drinking just because there was alcohol, feeling like the only way to have fun was to have pot.

Reading back over this my thoughts seem kindof scattered, but that’s what’s racing through my mind

I am bipolar and also have social anxiety disorder. We were getting ready to go out to dinner at a lovely place where we have reservations for two. As I am finishing up, he asks if we should invite his mate and her girlfriend. I say the reservation is for two and as the place is quite posh, it might be too late to change. I also told him that I didn't feel like performing tonight and would rather it be just the two of us. He got upset and said I was making things up in my head; that I didn't have to ""perform"" and I was being a lunatic.

It has been a stressful couple of weeks but in the best of days I wouldn't relish being called a lunatic by the person I am closest to. I blew up and explained that I wasn't making anything up, that every time I interacted with anyone I am performing. I am always on guard and I feel the need to keep up a cheerful façade around people, particularly around his mates and for this girlfriend who I only know slightly (though they are both good people). By this time I was in tears out of anger and frustration. He said I needn't be so upset over a hypothetical situation. I explained that A. I was upset over his name-calling and refusal to listen to what I was saying, and B. That it wasn't me expecting the worst case scenario, it was a dead cert that if we went out with others, I would feel the need to be entertaining and it wouldn't be relaxing at all.

This might be more of a case for /r/socialanxiety (if there is such a thing). I have often gone out with his mates and I do have a good time but I was looking forward to a night off from social pressures. Anyway, this post isn't really about that. I'm more hurt that he called me a lunatic and that he decided I was making it all up. He's a decent man but he doesn't understand at all what it's like to have my disorder so I don't know why he won't do the barest research or at least take my word for it.

I took care of six errands I've been putting off this morning while getting in touch with a professor about a paper I didn't write during a massive depressive swing that bottomed out earlier this week.

I felt vindicated. I finally had a professional confirm what I already knew to be true that so many around me had convinced me was all in my head (no pun intended). I was right, and they were all wrong. Na-na na-na boo-boo, right?

I've since been forced to look at the issue not as an abstract possibility or a hypothetical but rather a confirmed constant for the rest of my life. 

Before the diagnosis I could convince myself that my episodes might not happen again after the last one. Now, I know they will. I know that for the rest of my life, at any point in time I might just lose it again and I have no practical control over it. 

Before the diagnosis I could convince myself that I had control. Now, I know that I don't. There is a certain level of control that can be attained, which I am currently seeking. I've started medication and I'm seeing a therapist. And this all may curb the severity and frequency of my episodes, but there is no cure and they won't ever go away. I have limited to no practical control over when I have an episode, how long it lasts or how deep it goes. And inherent in bipolar, the control I have over what things I might say or do, to both myself and those around me are equally as limited. There's still a me inside, but he get's buried among the briers that I vomit.

Before the diagnosis, I didn't feel compelled to study up on all the possible triggers I've never encountered, how they might apply to me and how I might personally react to them. In the same vein, I didn't dissect everything that I had ever done, every mistake that I had made, every job that I lost, every person that I hurt or every wall that I broke; it was just 'me in the past', not the 'I in bipolar.' Now, everything I do, think and say is potentially related to my disorder and I have to consider that.

Today, after working a short two hour shift at work, I got so angry at my girlfriend that I felt compelled to leave my own house and leave her here as she was in the bathroom. And maybe if my anger was valid, it might have been called for. But no, I get angry and anxious over the fact that she feels ignored as I sit on my computer and argue with people on the internet. She expressed her dissatisfaction, and rightfully so. And it wasn't until I got the urge to drive head first into a telephone pole that I realized that my reaction was not only uncalled for but way over the top. 

I did eventually calm down and we did eventually talk. I ran a correlation between my reaction and my illness. But that's exactly what I'm saying: now that I know, it feels central to who I am much of the time. Not all of the time, not even most of the time, but it's enough to dwell on.

I don't know... I suppose that's central to all of this: I don't know. I don't even know what it is that I don't know, but of course then I wouldn't feel compelled to say it. I just... I don't know...

I started lamotrigine three weeks ago. 

A GP I saw last Friday didn't consider SJS because I was complaining about Seroquel. My psychiatrist prescribed 25-50 mg of Seroquel last Wednesday to help me sleep and as an anti-manic agent.

I woke up Thursday feeling like hell: my throat and mouth hurt especially. I thought it was the Seroquel.

The sore throat and mouth ulcers/irritation are classic symptoms of SJS.  

I stopped the lamotrigine yesterday. Now I wait and see if the SJS progresses. 

My throat and mouth remain irritated and sore.

The SJS diagnosis is making me paranoid about any itchiness and fatigue I'm experiencing. 

I'm allergic to sulfanomides and pyridium. Pyridium is related to sulfanomides but I don't think it's classed as such.  Sulfanomides can also cause SJS. I wonder if my sulfanomide and pyridium allergies should have been considered when my psychiatrist prescribed lamotrigine.

Cummings wrote:  “To be nobody but yourself in a world which is doing its best day and night to make you everybody else, means to fight the hardest battle which any human being can fight, and never stop fighting.”

This quote speaks to me because it defines the quest for self. If you think you are not going to have to fight to become authentically you, you are delusional.  Life requires a knowledge of self in order to live it fully. 
 
A man went to Carl Jung, a well known psychologist, for treatment of chronic depression.  Jung told the man to cut his 14 hour work days to 8 and to spend time in the evening in his study alone.  The man cut back his work and spent time in his study.  He listened to famous classical composers and read famous authors.  Weeks later he went back to Jung, complaining he was no better.  After hearing what the man had been doing Jung said, “But you didn’t understand…I wanted you to be completely alone.”  The man looked terrified and said, “I can’t think of any worse company.  Jung said, “Yet this is the self you inflict on others fourteen hours a day” (Manning, 2002). 

We spend our lives avoiding ourselves as if we are afraid of what we will uncover if we do pop the top and look inside.  The National Institute of Mental Health puts mental illness in America at 57.7 million people.  In 2008 Johns Hopkins released data that showed the suicide rate had increased for the first time in a decade, and no longer is the teenage population the highest risk.  The high risk category is individuals who are middle-aged (Johns Hopkins Bloomberg 2010).  So why is that do you suppose?  Why do we have such a high rate of mental illness and Americans who are reaching middle age and discovering life is desperate enough to end?

I am sure there are lots of reasons and environmental stimulus to push an individual to that point.  I have experienced extreme mental illness and have played the “how best to end it all” game too many times to count.  But I think that under all the layers of life gone wrong and disillusionment there is a self-hatred that eventually clinches the decision.  If you cannot love yourself, how long can you fake it until you are found out or you simple can fake it no longer…Um..maybe middle age?

I was a hairstylist many years ago, and the women who sat in my chair day after day had no knowledge of who they were, and they were looking desperately for me to show them something beautiful about themselves.  And no matter what I saw I could rarely convince any of them.  We have a serious problem with avoidance in our culture.  We don’t want to spend time alone with ourselves, not because we are certain, but because we are afraid that our greatest fears will be realized, that we are not worth having conversation with, that we are ugly, that there is nothing worth knowing about us.
I was forced to pop the top and look at me.  Mental illness mercilessly drove me there, and it saved me.  I still have to go back and do that.  I find I can easily grow away from myself, and that is when fear of what I’ll find when I do take a look creeps in.  

I challenge you this week to cut back on your time with people and the white noise, and take a little time with you…no radio, no television, and no books…just you and you.  Dare to do it.  You might be surprised at what you find, but go into the experience with a little mercy and no judgments.  This is not about assessment.  It’s about spending time just being and about a reckoning with you.  I'm going to head back that way this week as well.

I've always thought that she'd be better with someone else, because living with me can be difficult. Even on my meds, I have periods of constant cycling. When manic, I rage. Sometimes I scare myself. It isn't nearly as often as it was before being properly diagnosed and medicated, but it still happens.

Last night, she confessed that she's realized that it isn't ""if"" our relationship will end, but ""when"". The tipping point was [this article](http://www.madambipolar.com/2012/07/bad-news-plus-good-news-guest-editor.html) posted in here a few days ago. Christmas day, one of the parents of my oldest daughter's (she's 3) friend, who was also bipolar, committed suicide. My wife has recently been spending time with the mom, because the kids have play dates together. They've been talking a lot about the suicide, and how there were no signs leading up to him just saying he was going out for a walk to take his life. She's aware that sometimes I hide the severity of my cycles from her, and that scares her. Sometimes when I rage, I lash out. She worries that someday I'm going to do something to the children in a rage (it honestly scares me too). 

Needless to say, she wonders how much time we have together. Will she have to leave? Will it be because she doesn't have the strength anymore to be supportive? Will it be because I've violently lashed out at her or the kids? Will I take my own life? Will my illness just degenerate to the point that I'm always in a state of mania or depression, and I'll just spend all my time hospitalized? Will I just leave?

All of this makes me wonder if it's even worth maintaining a relationship. I love my wife and don't want to lose her. But realistically, why would I want someone to stay with me, when I often don't even like living with me? I don't want her to live in constant fear of me doing something to myself. I don't want her constantly wondering if I'm hiding my emotions from her. I want to be there every day to see my kids grow up. I don't want them to see or experience the monster that I am capable of being when I'm manic.

One of the things I enjoy particular is the diverse culture with one thing that bonds us. A part of me wants to know what percent of us makes up gender and sexual orientation and if you are settled with a loved one. I honestly have no interest in knowing ethnicity and location. 

I know that's a weird cross section of interest. I've noticed that this melting pot seems to be much different in those areas. 

But here is the other thing, I don't want to know who is what. I like the fact I have chance of judgement or prejudice when talking with each of you. I like just talking to your pure inner self free from whatever places a label in society. 

If I were to set up an anonymous survey with those factors, would you all be willing to participate? For some reason gender and sexual identity interests me, and so far I've noticed more free minded people here. 

Now I type this out, it makes sense. I have interest in knowing your perceived identity. Who you have discovered within. Your body and location has nothing to do with how I see you.

Other than that, I am a single father with an autistic son, which keeps my levels of stress pretty high. I wonder if it would be good for me to add the stress of an relationship.

I am a 37 yr old father of 4 children. Who is in the process of getting a divorce. I am unemployed. Have no insurance. No money. No medication. Though I do have refills. No transportation. No license. Hell no life. I am extremely close to being homeless. Have in the last 6 months been to 2 homeless shelters. The bed bugs are horrible. I have applied for SSI/Disability. But that determination is a long ways off. In a nutshell I need help. I feel close to the suicide think again. I have told I am affected by Bi-Polar by two different people in two different states, two different times. AT this point I feel like I am losing my mind. How do I deal with the pressures and stress associated with this condition? I feel like my wife in one sense does great at taking care our children. But there are certain aspects I do not like. Mainly how quickly she has already moved on after asking for a divorce. I am very fixated on the sexual side of this issue. I go totally off the charts when she has a guy stay the night. It's not just the staying the night either. I know my wife. She cut me off. Asked for a divorce. Then a month later had already jumped in the sack with some other guy. Didn't as how I felt at all. I lost it of course. The guy couldn't handle the situation. So he bailed. Now she's sleeping around with an old classmate of her's who is a addicted to alcohol. And now I feel very close to going off again. The whole pressure side of thinking about things is about to get to me. I honestly feel very close to harming someone. She says I am being retarded and selfish. I disagree. But how much of it is my condition or just my unhappiness? If she would just do better in this area of life I think I would be able to cope. As is she defies me at every turn. And this is with me telling her It would help me chill out. I guess this is me sending out an internet SOS. I have very little family and really no friends. I have no one to talk to that has some understanding of what it is like to be Bi-polar. Most of my family it would seem do not understand me. I feel very alone and upset. I have a million things to say. But no one who truly cares enough to listen. Something drastic seems like the only option. Though I am doing my best to refrain from that though. Any thoughts?

I am currently titrating up on the generic form of Lamictal. I am on 100 mg now, and tomorrow I start my first dose of 200 mg. I, however, am terrified to continue. I have Bipolar, and anxiety. Knowing I am a bit of a hypochondriac anyone I know that I've asked about this has said ""it's probably nothing. You're fine."" However, I read into it. 

See, I've been experiencing some mysterious bruising on my legs and torso, most of them small, scattered, with one very large bruise on my knee. It's unlike any I've seen before, and I am not the first person to experience this as I've researched. 

Before I even noticed that, I have been experiencing a dramatic change in my sleep patterns, extremely vivid and strange dreams that wake me up frequently during the night, and feeling very low energy and fatigued all day no matter how much or how little sleep I get. All that stuff, honestly, I could live with - as long as the drug was a support for me. The bruises though, that was the last straw.

Has anyone else here experienced something like that, or know anything about it? I want to stop taking it. It could be a sign of problems with the liver, which is a possible side effect of this drug. 
I was advised that an abrupt stop could potentially have negative side effects (such as seizures, even if you're not taking it for seizures,) but could those *potential* side effects really be worse than the *real* side effects I'm experiencing?

My goal was to strike up a conversation with someone I didn't know.

I bought my ticket online beforehand to ensure that I would actually go. I was really nervous and sat in my car in the parking lot a bit before I headed in. Alone.

It was packed. I thought it'd be science geeks like me but there were lots of skinny chicks with high heels and spandex outfits. In my t-shit and sneakers I felt out of place a bit. No worries - I soldiered on! Had a glass of wine and walked around enjoying some of the exhibits. They had a DJ (playing awful top 40 but what can you do, this is CT) and lots of people dancing. I only sat in the bathroom for five minutes! I promised myself to stay for at least a half hour.

So after I finished my glass of social lubricant, I managed to compliment two people on their shoes and shirt, respectively. I was greeted with a thanks and then they turned their backs on me and faced their friends. Not one person talked to me for the hour and a half I struggled through.

I came back to my mom's place tonight (my place is a half hour from here) and she basically said, ""Well, what do you expect? No one goes to those things alone.""

Bears, I feel awful right now. I'm sitting in bed crying and I think you guys might be the only ones who get it. I don't know if it's me or if it's CT's unfriendliness in general, but I feel really lonely right now. Tonight just felt like high school all over again.

Yesterday I was feeling a bit more perky, decided to wander over to another sub to see what was up. It's the askafeminist sub. Hey, cool! This could be interesting! I mean, hey, how could THAT not be a safe sub to engage in some good discussions, right? OMG. WRONG WRONG. 

I...I just don't get people, I guess. I mean, I posted one question regarding the 1979 Iranian revolution because I would love to get some perspective from an Iranian woman's pov. I love sociology. I like to learn from diverse (and oftentimes opposing) views on a variety of subjects, because I have a curious mind and I believe there is a lot to be learned by listening to different pov's.  So, what was the first comment I received? This one:
*trackerbishop
Hello. I am a 60 year old woman who emigrated to the uk during the revolution. I received a PhD in sociology after emigrating. The revolution was a tough time for everyone in 1979 because we couldn't have lesbian sex and abort babies into the trash. So I emigrated and have wind contracted numerous stds and couldn't be happier*

Wat?

Ok, well, there is always one in the crowd, right? Moving right along...Hey, someone is asking for suggestions for subjects of discussion for their weekly feminist club...Well, I have been interested (again, that sociology thing) in how women often times feel like we have to ""hide"" our gender to avoid the whole ""togtfo"" thing. I mean, I don't have girl children, but if I did it would be part of the whole 'internet safety discussion'. And immediately got pig piled on by a bunch of angry, angry Ragesauri (plural of rageasaurus?). 
Yikes. Way to go and reinforce those ""angry raging feminist"" stereotypes, ladies!

So, I went against my own advice, and waded to another shore w/o using a throwaway, only to be attacked by the angry natives. I won't make that mistake again, let me tell you-it just isn't healthy.

Now, YOU guys. You guys I love. I'm staying here from now on, where it's safe :)

A bitchfest. I'm not offended if you pass it by. I just needed to rant and luckily I'm still coherent enough to realize that posting on FB is not a good idea. 

I realize I'm only at 100mg of lamictal, which isn't enough to make a difference. I realize I've been sliding slowly back down the rabbit hole. I actually cried at my appointment last week, and I NEVER fucking cry in front of people. On that note, I have been crying at everything. Seriously, a couple days ago I dropped my son off at school and was listening to the radio. Some girl came on and started crying because she had won something (tickets or whatever). I STARTED CRYING. 
I've been crying while driving...just...driving.
And OH FUCK the irritability! The intolerance for being around people! 
Today I made the grievous mistake of going into The Walmart to see if they had a dog harness (they didn't), and I barely made it out of there alive. Holy crap it was like stepping into some sort of surreal goddamn David Lynch scene. I swear to god I almost got run over by an enormous woman riding one of those scooters. I started feeling like my heart and lungs were being squeezed up into my throat. This, in the time it took to race to the pet area, have a quick look, and race out. Why did I go there? Never Again. 

Also,I'm not motivated. To do anything. Laundry is building up, I can't seem to get my shit together and clean house. Mind you, I'm usually a bit of a neat freak, so at the same time the mess is freaking me out. Haven't been out in the studio to do anything but minor touch ups for an installation. For almost a year. I was supposed to be working on paintings for an upcoming exhibition and I had to cancel it. I haven't sold anything in months and months-maybe because I haven't hustled anywhere to show. 
Tonight I snapped just a bit at my husband for dumping his goddamn espresso grounds into the sink and leaving them there (WTF, we HAVE A LITTLE COMPOST BIN RIGHT THERE UNDER THE FUCKING SINK), and now he's pouting. Which is just making me more angry.
To top it off, the ONLY thing I've noticed about this lamictal is feeling like Charley in 'Flowers For Algernon' when he starts going backwards. I not spel veri gud no mor. I dont remembr stuf gud no mor. 
So, overall, I am just in one of those moods. It sucks. I'm just going to hide out in the bedroom as much as I can, because it's the only thing I can think of, and I don't want to run the risk of going off on my boys. This just sucks balls.
Thanks for letting me vent.

Not about life, just lost within myself. It's not an ""I don't know who I am"" it's more like I'm looking at an unfamiliar reflection. Someone that I'm not comfortable with. Generally, that's when I'm depressed. I can't identify what I'm thinking about, and when someone asks, I freeze up and lose my train of thought. It's like static. Things take me more time, because I feel so utterly slow and useless. I'm not myself; sometimes I do completely irrational things that I later regret. Also, I can't treat people the way I normally would, it just gets hard to be social. I don't know if anyone can relate to that. If you can, then I'm sorry for you. 

A couple of weeks ago, I was so depressed I went to see a psychiatrist. She prescribed Abilify (and gave me a huge coupon for it) so I've been taking that once a day. Unlike in the past, I've actually kept to it. I was on depakote a long time ago, but it made me have panic attacks all the time. I was unmedicated for over a year. I thought I was being successful, it seemed like a huge accomplishment to be so independent. I was trying so hard to keep it that way, even waking up at five to run. Sure, I had scraped my knees a few times along the way, but I never actually wanted help until I had fallen down and broken both of my legs. Which led to this overdue visit. 

At first, I was less nervous. My sleeping schedule started to improve. I didn't start to notice it until this week, but I feel like I'm waking up. I'm sure everyone has looked back at their past self and thought, 'God, I was so stupid back then' but that's not the case. I don't think I lacked the ability to think. Moreso, I lacked the actual thinking. When you're unconcious, going through the motions, and trying to get by you just don't think. Atleast not in the quality I can now.

It's similar to when I start to get manic - I think that I've reached some new cognitive level. It's the same food with a different flavor. I suppose it's not quite as spicy; I don't have an abundance of energy or an irrational sense of rationality. I just have motivation, because getting out of bed in the morning, it just makes sense. I'm not getting burned out on all the projects I start, but I'm actually getting things done.

Anyways let me rant just a little. I am a relatively intelligent person (and saying that is probably modest). I am fairly well-rounded too---good at math/science, AND english/social studies/blahhh. I have two problems with choosing what i want to do however....

1. what i want to do with my life/my entire outlook can completely change depending on my mood. the other day, after a few ""high"" days, I half-jokingly said to my mom, ""what if I were an actress? could I be an actress?"" she responds with ""yeah, you need to up your mood stabilizers."" okay, great. also, I have no idea if I can be in a social job or not. If I'm manic, everyone's my best friend and I'm a social butterfly. If i'm depressed, I want to kill everyone. (not really but you get what I mean).

2. I feel like I have a lot of potential that can never be harnessed. For example, my science and math teachers have told me I should be a doctor. Yeah, like I could possibly make it through medical school without a huge mental breakdown (no matter how well-medicated I am). I can't do stuff like that. It's too much.

My problem is, though, that when I am depressed I tend to get distrustful, and connect unknowns about her life in ways they shouldn't be connected and end up with this web of conspiracy that insists that I am being used and she is cheating on me, and doesn't like spending time with me; it utterly obscures all the good in our relationship, and those things that are so obviously contradictory of my spun web. And when I come out of my depression I look back and am baffled by how those ideas ever came into my head. 

I think this is pretty normal for depression. But even though the ideas are fabricated, *the feelings are real*. I am in true distress by them, and sometimes that lingers and I feel like I can't trust her even when I am not depressed. I work hard to ignore it. It's like when you think someone has wronged you and build up an anger toward them. Only to find out it was not them, but the anger still takes a while to settle. (or maybe that's just me...)

I try to be open about this to her, but I'm not sure she really knows how to handle it. She assures me that it doesn't bother her, which is wonderful, but that only comforts me when I am not in my depressed mindset. I think she is willing to try things out, I just don't know what to suggest. Should I tell her all my insecurities to keep them from spinning through my head ad nauseum? Some of them seem pretty awful for me to have ever concluded, and it doesn't seem fair that she should account for every detail of her life that I am construing into deviance. And it's hard sometimes to admit my flaws, and to explain that even though those thoughts are in my head now they do not represent my common beliefs.

When I got there, I saw her through her window walking towards the door. I assumed she had seen me. As I approach her door I hear a very loud ***BANG***. It sounded like she had dropped or knocked something over so I waited a few minutes. When I heard nothing else, I went ahead and knocked on the door. She started screaming, ""Help! I've fallen! I can't breath! CALL 911!!"" I called 911 and tried to get into the house but none of her doors or windows were unlocked.

It’s been five days since the music festival and I still can’t sleep.  I’ve already purchased my tickets to go see Bassnectar perform again a few months and 600 miles from now.  I’ve been continuing to go to work at the semiconductor company where I’m an engineering intern and I can’t stop coming up with amazing ideas to pursue in regards to production control fixes.  This upcoming weekend is a four day weekend due to the fourth of July and I can’t wait for it to come.  I get off work after another amazing day at the office and proceed to head home as usual.  I am so excited to go cliff jumping tomorrow that I can’t contain my excitement.  I start jamming out to the music I’m listening to at the light and proceed to get weird looks from the car next to me.  I laugh and continue jamming, really, really hard.  
I make it home and proceed to head to my office where I’ve spent the past few days and nights watching videos on youtube and reaching out to the people who’ve created them, offering my opinions on their material as well as commending their dedication to their videos.  I spend the next few hours doing the same and eventually realize that I need to eat dinner.  I start cooking spaghetti and realize that there’s a ladybug on the ceiling.  I feel as though this is a sign for the upcoming fun tomorrow and pay close attention to what the ladybug is doing.  It starts walking on the light fixture above me and I start to count how many squares it’s traveled on the plastic covering of the light.  14.  I make sure to remember this number as it’s sure to help me in my adventure the following day.  I finish cooking and eat my well-made spaghetti, it’s delicious.
After cleaning up the dishes, I go back to the office and make the stark realization that chairs are evil and that I shouldn’t be using one.  Chairs promote a sedentary lifestyle that I can’t even imagine living at the moment and it bothers me to be in the same room as one.  It goes out into the living room.  The ladybug has followed me into this room, I take this as another sign that the number 14 is going to be vastly important.  I start to listen to music on soundcloud and play a song by NitGrit called “The Awakening”.  I remember that there’s a video someone made to it and proceed to watch it:
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Wcv5sfiuQU
Its super trippy and I somehow feel connected to it, that the ladybug who is on the ceiling is somehow trying to tell me about life lessons.  After it finishes, I start to scribble everything that comes to mind down on my dry erase calendar on the wall.  To me, everything is interconnected and makes perfect sense.  I draw one line from a realization to another, thinking of the ways these things interconnect and are meant to be.  I’m a genius.  The rest of the night continues on, with me listening to more music on soundcloud and writing the artists, telling them how I want to start a music label and that they should hit me back if they’re interested.  
The morning comes and my friends arrive for our trip out to the waterfall where we’ll be cliffjumping and swimming.  I still haven’t slept.  I show them all of the amazing connections on my calendar and proclaim how excited I am about life.  One friend seems to get what I’m saying and comments on a few of the connections and how it’s an interesting take on the relationship.  I agree and am stoked that someone else shares my new view on life.  We pack our things into the car and proceed to get ready to head out.  My neighbors are outside, a young couple in their late twenties doing some yard work.  I strike up a conversation about the weather since it was nice out and proceed to fill them in on our entire trip planned for the day.  They seem curious about cliffjumping since they’ve never done it before so I tell them that it’s about the best natural rush you can possibly get.  I’m having the best day ever I think to myself.  
	We finish packing and head down to the local REI.  Me and a friend are going to buy some Vibram five fingers for the trip.  In our opinion, these are going to be the best shoes ever to go cliff jumping with, and I willing drop $90 on a brand new pair.  I buy a year-long membership to REI while I’m there because hell, why not.  We pick up parking passes for the place that we’re heading to and embark on the short trek out there.  On the way, I’m starting to feel how the music we’re listening to is affecting our immediate moods.  It’s also interesting to me to note when we drive through shady spots as opposed to light spots.   I’m convinced that something about the shade brings out more negative conversation than that of when we’re in the light.  I keep telling my passenger to make notes of the some of the things that we’re thinking up on the way out there.  “Wandering thought train of love” is what I feel we are while in my car and am stoked on it.  Rolling down the windows completely changes the dynamic of the ride and each billow is affecting my mood.  I’m amazed that I hadn’t noticed how light and sound affected me previously and make sure to tell my friend to jot down (364) because it represents the light spectrum from a computer’s standpoint.  
	We arrive at the exit and no joke, its number 41.  I take this immediately as a good omen because of the number 14 that the ladybug had told me the previous night.  I get utterly excited and know that I am meant to be here at this place with all of these specific people.  We make the 2-mile hike in to the waterfall and setup shop at its base.  There are tons of people that I know here who I wouldn’t normally expect to see and I start to feel as though I’m the reason that they’re here.  People from my high school, people from work, and people from my college all in the same spot enjoying what I feel to be the most beautiful day ever.  I start talking to one of my friends from college, saying how I’m never smoking or drinking or doing drugs ever again because I’m so high on life.  He questions me on it and I argue that there is no better high than being completely sober because it allows you to experience all of your senses to the max.  He shurgs, agrees, and walks off with beer in hand.  
	The day progresses and I meet an Indian fellow taking pictures of the waterfall.  I ask whether or not he’s from Gao as I would love to visit there someday.  I’ve heard about headphone parties they have there where there are 3 DJs spinning and you can select which one to listen to on your headphone frequency selector.  I take his contact info down in my phone because I really want to go to India.  Cliffjumping concludes and I depart from my group to head the complete opposite direction where my parents live.  I realize I haven’t packed anything for the 3 day weekend but I could care less.  All I have on is a shirt, shorts and my vibrams.  
	On the drive out, I stop at a local convenience store/ gas station to pick up some gas and grub.  I feel as though I’m meant to stop here.  I start talking to these teens who have the same hat as one of my friends that I was at the musical festival with.  I ask if they know her and it turns out that they do.  I’m not surprised by this because I’m at the point where I’m feeling all powerful and that everything is happening for a reason.  I text my friend saying that I met Lucas, one of her friends from the ski camp where these teens were staying.  I get a huge question mark in return.  I proceed to the checkout and the cashier looks at me, and says that he was at the same music festival.  He tells me that he just went and was able to get in completely free.  I am now convinced that something divine is happening to me even though I’m not a religious person at all.

Cheer me up, or at least share in my sadness?
