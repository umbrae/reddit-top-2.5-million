Edit: I wonder how the supreme court ruling that states one cannot be tracked without a warrant will hold up outside US borders... except the device was put on the vessel in a US territory.

Edit 2
Thanks to Facebook Fu I have uncovered some 1st hand accounts of the Capt's encounter with the FEDS, this is 2nd hand information and the person writing it is not myself despite the usage of the words ""me"" and ""we"".  This was posted July 26th.


""Shortly after me and CAPT left the virgin islnds we were hopping down the southern coast of Puerto rico and we pulled in to Ponce before we dropped anchor the Dept. homeland security motioned us over to the customs dock. These assholes searched our boat for 8 hours looking for drugs. they had 12 different officers and a k-9 unit tore up every thing. then when they couldn't find anything but my rolling papers they dispatched a unit from San Juan ( 2hr drive from ponce)to come and do another search . they logged our boat for search again upon entry to the US and notified the FEDS. all because capt. re did some fiberglass on the inside they thought that we hid drugs under neath the fiberglass.
 ""

This was posted not too long ago by the Captain himself:

""
While down in Dominican Republic I found several boats of sailors i have meet in the 16 years and 35,000 sea miles, repairing their boats from Pourto Rico DPNR. ( whick is Home land security ) or what sailors call ZZ gestoppo. From where they drilled holes into the hules in search of who knows , doing damage to these hules. Nothing ever being found. On the water i get stoped alot. It is not like i am trying to hide or be sneaky. Da , i painted the boat a bright yellow what the hell.

One of the owners had bought a hull for a Wesail 32 and was completing it in the yard. Ever since then I dreamed of doing the same thing.
In 1996 I had a mid life crisis and caught the sailing bug again. I asked my wife if she would be interested in sailing around the world when we turned 55 and being the wonderful woman she is, she said yes!
Over the next 14 years we turned our backyard into a workshop and many weekends and evenings were spent building this boat. During that time my wife started taking sailing courses at Humber College in Toronto. One day the manager asked if I'd be interested in teaching sailing courses for them, I obviously agreed to their offer and that was the first time I realized we could actually start making money from sailing. The pay as an instructor wasn't very good but it offered me the opportunity to travel to the Caribbean to teach on their chartered boats as well as bring my wife along.
Through teaching I developed a following of people in the local sailing community who followed my project and from there we decided we could sell sailing courses to compensate our retirement on the boat. The business side of this project wasn't anticipated but it was an opportunity we decided to embrace.
I'm happy to answer any of your questions you may have!

Ask me anything!",122,8,69,http://www.reddit.com/r/sailing/comments/1658dx/why_the_hell_not_iama_norwegian_guy_who_wrote_my/,"I'm 30, and have been at sea since I was a kid, as my family on my fathers side have all been fishermen. I got into sailing in my early 20's, pretty late, really, but I got so hooked on it, I pretty soon spent a third of a year on the ocean - _not_ counting day trips. My speciality is square-rigged boats, especially everything you'd think of as ""viking"". But I'll have a go at anything wooden and scandinavian, such as Colin Archers, or other decked double-enders.

I've sailed a few different modern boats as well, but not dinghys. I've raced a H-boat with my friends, and I've meen the mainsail-guy on an IMS 50, a One-off FARR design 40' and had a few goes in normal cruisers. But when it comes to mobern boats, I don't know much more than the next guy.

I'm currently applying for conservator positions at museums, as well as crew on old museum vessels.

**Update!** I've added links to pictures and videos of some of the vessels I've sailed.

* [Youtube clip of the lainch, naming and hoisting the sail of Harald Fairhair, the worlds biggest viking ship!](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90uKGICMbAI). This ship is built by traditional boat builders that have specialized on the ""modern"" descendants of the viking boats. These boats were in use up until around 1900, and are almost identical, both in rigging and construction, to the viking boats! Harald Fairhair is not a replica, but the result of boat builders trying to build a viking ship that acutally sails as well as in the sagas. Other replicas just haven't been very successful, either they're not very good, or they seem to tear themselves apart. Harald Fairhair will hopefully be both fast, safe and have a longer lifespan!
* [Yours truly, looking badass on watch](http://i.imgur.com/le62P.jpg)
* [Me again, looking badass in the water...](http://i.imgur.com/Sj5C0.jpg) We've tried to capsize different traditional boats too see what they can handle. Surprisingly they don't ""flip"", but when the sheer goes under, they stop turning over and go straight down. There's a lot of myths about how you can sail the water out of a completely submerged boat, and bail it fast enough to get it out. In an 18', two very good sailors actually managed to sail a submerged boat! The sheer got just enough out of the water for them to bail it. But bailing by itself will not work unless if the sea is dead calm, but what kind of sailor are you if you capsize in the calms!?
* [Taken on the deck of ""Anna Rogde""](http://i.imgur.com/4qLsIh.jpg?1), the worlds oldest still sailing schooner. We tried to gather crew and sail her in the Tall Ships Races, but we started too late and didn't make it. That's when I applied for the full rigger ""Sørlandet"". I haven't sailed on Anna Rogde more than a few weeks total.
* [What ""Anna Rogde"" looks like](http://i.imgur.com/chANq.jpg). Couldn't find any big pictures of her, sorry...
* Even though viking ships are my speciality, [""Sørlandet""](http://imgur.com/a/wvKTV#3) is my favorite ship in world. I'm applying for a job on her these days, wish me luck...
* [See the guy at the top of the mast?](http://i.imgur.com/LuRSzh.jpg). That's me. This was taken as the Tall Ships fleet left Stavanger, and I was working on the royal on the mainmast then. Cool, huh? I found this in a magazine a couple of weeks after I left her.
* [A ""seksring""](http://i.imgur.com/Uhmggh.jpg). A faering has four oars, a seksring has six. That's the old ""aering"" way wich describes the size of a boat. Today we just use that for the smallest boats, from eight oars and up, we use the number of ""rooms"", a room is the space between two thwarts and with enough room for a man to sit and row in.
* [A faering next to an ottring](http://imgur.com/a/wvKTV#6). Uh, so that I said about number of oars and rooms? Well, it doesn't count for ottrings. It means eight oars, but in northern Norway, an ottring has five rooms. What has happenes is that the name stuck with a certain use, and not the size. Ottrings were the first true boats built specifically to fish with nets. As nets got bigger, the boats grew from four rooms (eight oars), to five, but the name stuck. This ottring is named ""Håløygen"" and was built in 1880. Looks like a small viking ship? As I said, they're direct descendants!
* By far the boat I've spent most time in, [""Salarøy""](http://i.imgur.com/B6GeLh.jpg). This is a fembøring, wich also deviates from the room/oars thing... Offcourse. Well, fembøring is a very old description. Around 1880's the fishing industry went trough the roof, and nets got so big the five-roomed ottrings became to small. Fembørings had as many as seven, and some very few even eight rooms. ""Fem"" means five in modern norwegian, but in norse, ""femr"" or ""fimr"" meant light/fast, and ""børing"" meant ""carrier"". Before used in fishing, since the late iron age, this size had been used as a small, but very fast coastal cargo freighter. It seems that this size strikes a balance between different forces working against each other, that makes it the fastest. But it'll be interesting to see how ""Harald Fairhair"" performs! The Sagas describe how they sent fembørings out to scout ahead.
* [Out island hopping in ""Salarøy""](http://i.imgur.com/9ycIk.jpg). Dinghy looks a bit overloaded...
* [""Drauen""](http://i.imgur.com/9Hkdkh.jpg) is a replica of one of the oldest boats we've got. The original was built in the 1840's but is way to valuable to sail...
* [Misværottringen](http://i.imgur.com/7oPIZh.jpg?1) as it sits in storage at the Norwegian Maritime museum. Now THIS thing might be as old as from 1750! But it's in absolutely brilliant nick!
* [The view from deck as the Tall Ships fleet left Waterford](http://imgur.com/a/wvKTV#11). Ok, so it wasn't terribly exciting, but the view wasn't too bad!
* [The three prototypes](http://i.imgur.com/HNb0Ch.jpg) we used to test hull shapes, sail and rope shape and materials - silk, hemp, wool and leather - and steering oars. They're named ""Urd"", ""Skuld"" and ""Verdande"", after the norse godesses (norns) of fate.
* [Verdande](http://i.imgur.com/pA5aih.jpg) I think, with silk sail with leather leeches. The leather actually came from walruses. They cooked oil, to use for perservation, lubrication and oil burning lamps. I had a swig of it. Threw up for days. It was the mankiest, most acrid piss I've ever tasted.
* [Goxsheim](http://i.imgur.com/gl0Moh.jpg), a beautiful 74' ketch (In scandinavie, we kall this rig a ""galeas"") I've worked on. We took skiing tourists to the Lyngen alps to go alpine touring. It even has a sauna on board!

So my colleague agreed to answer any questions he can when we meet up this afternoon/night. He has sailed several 1 ton world championships in the 80's and 90' and have been competing since young age. He started as a sailmaker in his early twenties and is now CEO of our company. We're working out of Stockholm, Sweden on a small loft doing mainly high-end modern sails. 
He agreed to help out as long as it's me doing all the typing =)

Hope we can help someone out!

As it is Sunday and we're not working, I cant provide any proof. I can do that on monday on request however. Ill throw you a picture of a spinnaker we worked on a while back instead:

He then decided to sail it down to Barbados (where we live/lived). 

Now the last time I heard from him, via Skype, was on the 16th. Nor my mother or I have heard from him since. He said he would speak to my mum on the 23rd and never came online.

We have tried calling his cell - it's off (that's normal because of roaming charges). Skypeing him - he hasn't been online and emailing him - no answer.
He did set up SPOT Satellite GPS Messaging but has not activated it or whatever you need to do to get it up and running. I have the email link but do not understand it.

My mother is beside herself with worry as he is almost 60 and although a qualified Ocean Skipper is a bit rusty and sailing on his own last we heard.
Is there any thing or anyway we can find out how or where he is? He could be anywhere between Key West, Fl and the north Caribbean.
Any ideas or advice would be appreciated.
Thanks all.

Edit 1: 25th April. My mother will be calling the coast guard at Key West tomorrow morning and try and go from there. 9 days with no communication and 2 days over check-in date is too long. 
Will update this tomorrow with more news just to keep everyone updated. Thank you all for your well wishes and good vibes.

Edit 2: 26th April. I want to thank all those who have pm'd support and help. My mum is attempting to gather more info on the yacht from the broker as it was only bought in December. Hopefully from there we will be able to give the US Coast Guard some relevant info. 
I have also tried looking for his boat name on marinetraffic.com/ais and nothing is coming up. In fact. nothing is coming up for his boat in general. I am starting to think he will be found talking to a football on a deserted island somewhere!
Mum will call the Coast Guard tonight and let me know as I will be away form tonight until Tuesday (still have internet though) so will continue to update.

Edit 3: My mum has spoken with the coast guard and because he was last in contact whilst on land it has been given over to the police/sheriff dept as a missing persons report. As the boat was undergoing some repairs in Key West the last time i spoke to him, the police officer will call around to all the marine repair places and see when it was repaired and given the OK to go back into the water. 
Once we know he is officially off shore it will get passed over to the coast guard and they can pick it up from there. I also have the hull ID number now. Hopefully we will hear something in the next day or so. This is very unlike him and is not the sort to not let us know what's going on. I hope we track him down soon. 10days without contact is pushing it even for my nerves.",,False,self,t5_2qiye,1367003753.0,,,True,t3_1d3f8i,http://www.reddit.com/r/sailing/comments/1d3f8i/tracking_someone_at_sea/,

Thank you everyone so, so much for all the well wishes and thoughts.
We got a call from him this morning (UK time). He is fine, managed to get another sailor when in Key West so he has not been on his own. 
Apparently the weather has been terrible and they have only been making 60miles a day and having to use the motor a lot of the time. He should be past Puerto Rico by now..

He got held up in Cuba for a day before moving on and then had to make for Cuba again for fuel and supplies and got held by customs for another 2 days with no way on contacting anyone. 
So it has been a mixture of weather in the area and custom issues in Cuba.
He apologises for all the fuss made over him (coast guard, police and even a small newspaper article!) but I guess that's sailing for you.

Again thanks all. You helped keep me calm and rational with your thoughts and advice. Hopefully one day I will be posting a picture of us both sailing when he eventually makes it back.",,False,self,t5_2qiye,False,,,True,t3_1df4ay,http://www.reddit.com/r/sailing/comments/1df4ay/updated_tracking_someone_at_sea_hes_ok/,

I submitted a post a few months ago about my good friend who had just completed sailing around the world. Well, he came back to the states and  we were roommates for a bit. He had trouble acclimating to regular life and decided to hit the road again. He made plans to volunteer at an orphanage in Northern India. On his way through India he fell ill with typhoid fever. He spent 10 days in the hospital and was released. He continued on his journey North, rented a room in a guest house along the way. Went to sleep around 8pm and never woke up. 

He hadn't fully recovered from the typhoid fever and he had sepsis as a result of it as well. Anyway, It's a pretty sad story and I'm pretty sad about the whole thing but I think he'd want his people to be happy that he lived a full and generous life touching many hearts and minds.


here's my previous thread:

another video: https://vimeo.com/43147852

here's a quote from his final blog post that is nice:

""This trip was about simple discovery, venturing out to see the world and the people in it. Along the way we faced obstacles and challenges that only a trip like this could produce, and with no alternative but success we overcame. What we found was that the world is indeed a beautiful place filled with beautiful people. And like nearly everything in life, it is the people that make the experience and Bubbles was blessed with the best characters this world has to offer. It was a dream come true for me and If I learned anything on this trip it was that with a little luck and a lot of determination (or maybe it’s the other way around) you can make anything happen… just go for it!!"" -Alex Rust",,False,self,t5_2qiye,1370464437.0,,,True,t3_1fqnxa,http://www.reddit.com/r/sailing/comments/1fqnxa/friend_who_circumnavigated_the_globe_has_passed/,

It worked, but was time consuming to setup and not easy to get back on board.

A week or so ago, I finally sat down and [made myself a rope ladder](http://imgur.com/Hduno).  The process was pretty easy, based mostly from [this youtube video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VEXttVyT1A4).  It took an hour and a half from start to finish.  I made myself a little jig to start each rung which was quite helpful - just two nails pounded into a board to get equal spacing for the length of each rung.  I also counted out the number of turns around each rung to keep everything symmetrical.

I started with 200' of 3/8"" three-braid nylon rope from West Marine.  I only ended up using about 125' to make the 6 rungs.  Probably could have gotten away with only 5 rungs, and made them a little narrower to save on length, but now I'll have some extra dockline and emergency anchor rode.",,False,self,t5_2qiye,False,,,True,t3_peodf,http://www.reddit.com/r/sailing/comments/peodf/i_made_a_rope_ladder_for_my_sailboat/,

1360414692.0,40,self.sailing,186v3s,Amazing opportunity: Crew needed for 88' Sailboat (Sindbad) travelling from Panama &gt; Ecuador &gt; French Polynesia &gt; ? [XPOST from r/SailingCrew],58,18,19,http://www.reddit.com/r/sailing/comments/186v3s/amazing_opportunity_crew_needed_for_88_sailboat/,"Please upvote so people can see this opportunity (I get no karma for this self-post)

I was originally supposed to be crew on the Sindbad, but have received a better offer on another boat and have to back out on my Sindbad position.

Therefore, my spot is open and they will be looking for crew.

You would have to pay for your flight to the boat and your flight home, and they ask for $250 a week to help with food and gas (you can probably negotiate this down being more last-minute and if you have experiece). They asked me for a 3-month commitment, so they may ask you the same thing.

It's a very large and comfortable boat, and it's not a 'boat delivery', so they take their time and give you the opportunity to explore the islands that you stop at.

Here is the boat:

I built a nice 130ft dock that ends with sunk pilings for a future boathouse and its looked lonely for a year now.  A few weeks back a few small sailboats popped up on craigslist that were water ready in the $1500-$3000 price-range so I figured I'd go take a look.  A week later I own a 1977 Oday 22, rusty old trailer, and a recently rebuilt ~1980 johnson 7.5hp.  I picked up the trailer and brought it to my house and then met the seller at a dock about 12 miles from my house so he could ""show me the ropes"".  While the day was sunny and nice the wind was either in our face or dead calm so we motored 95% of the time and got it moored in my backyard.  He was a nice guy but didn't really get to show me too much as far as how to sail.

I took it out with my wife and her cousin yesterday just to play around with the sails. I've never sailed before, ever. I couldn't start the motor after I released most of the lines and it started to drift back so I jumped out to secure it. Finally got it started and almost immediately hit a sandbar. jumped out and pushed it loose. Got under way with the motor. Raised sails after 10 minutes of trying to figure it out. went in circles for 30 minutes as I tried to wrestle the jib halyards into place while dodging the boom. Winds were maybe 5kn so we really didn't fill the sails much.  Fortunately the motor started right up easily enough so we cruised back to the dock and I tied it all up.  I had some fun but my wife said she's not going with me again until I know what the hell i'm doing, lol.  Anyway hello.  I know nothing other than a few days of reading the internets.  I guess i'll go buy sailing for dummies or something.  cheers.

It is a bittersweet time as my wife and I have decided to sell Megatron, our 2004 Beneteau 373.  I know r/sailing is not normally a place to list ones boat for sale, but I think our setup might be of interest to the reddit community.

We both work full time, remotely, as independent consultants.  She is a copy editor and I am a web / iOS developer.  We moved aboard in March of 2010 and have traveled between Annapolis and Maine during that time.  

We are set up for remote work with a long range wifi antenna and tetherable iPhones, a big house battery bank, and solar panels.

It has been a BLAST and I would love share my experiences with you and/or find a happy new home for Megatron.

I bought ""Vixen"" back in August of this year and am pretty excited. I found her on Craigslist and got a really great deal.

Vixen is a somewhat unique design for a BCC in that she was ordered from the factory and finished by a couple at home. When I purchased Vixen I was lucky enough to receive the original photographs of her construction. 

I finally have gotten around to scanning them and I must say they turned out beautifully. Check them out! 

From the original owner: 

""As hull #2, she was originally molded at our request without an aperture for a prop as we planned to sail her engine-less. When we returned to California, we  moved the hull to Rancho Mirage, CA where, over the course of the next 3-1/2 years, we finished her off as a ""spare-time"" project, putting in some 6,000 hours (We were new to this boatbuilding thing...) She was launched in San Diego in July, 1980."" 

Yay!

I'll start with myself though, as an introduction:

I sail mostly in high school in Southern California, on Flying Juniors. All of my racing has been on these double handed boats, most of them interscholastic. I've had a few practices where I sailed other dinghys, such as Finns and Lasers, but haven't raced them yet. I've also sailed a 420 a couple of times.

My father is a boat captain in Florida during his semi-retirement. He was able to translate all his years of sailing into his license because he kept a log in his last 3 or 4 years of sailing in the Northeast. 

Now he gets paid to sail/deliver boats of some rather large sizes (I think he is up to 150 or 200 tons now). He also gets to go boating whenever we come to visit just by calling a client who wants their boat ""exercised"". Can you believe it?  

We, meaning myself, wife and two kids, fly down once a year and say ""Dad, we'd like to go out on the gulf in a 50 footer, do you think you can arrange it?"" and inevitably we'll get something rather large, opulent and wayyyyyy outside what he or we would be able to afford on our own. It helps that he is really really good at what he does, including being a salesman for his own services.

Eventually I hope to get enough experience myself and when I am ready to retire will either take over his little business or establish one myself. It is very competitive, as you can imagine there are lots of folks that want to live like Jimmy Buffett. But hopefully I can make enough to supplement my retirement in 20 years.

1374947333.0,32,self.sailing,1j64js,Cruising in racer infested waters and embarrassing myself in front of the entire yacht club. -A short story of shame on the SF bay.,33,1,22,http://www.reddit.com/r/sailing/comments/1j64js/cruising_in_racer_infested_waters_and/,"I live aboard my Contest 28 in the Berkeley marina, CA. I'm proud of my little blue water boat and have done some really nice work on her. A notable bit is the bright orange sunbrella I put on her when I had the sails repaired. You can see the orange streak running up my rig from any point in the marina. So, when I sail *Duende* it is clear to any knowledgeable onlooker that Spots is leaving port. 

I am an active member of my yacht club, often volunteering and I am always happy to chat with members. Folks know me, they know my boat. One YC activity I don't engage in is racing; I don't dislike racers it is just not for me. I am happiest going out for a day sail with friends who are new to or have never been sailing. Two weeks ago I gave a couple greenhorns more experience than any of us were looking for. 

The wind was mild for the SF bay so I raised full sails and started beating out in the direction of Angel Island, which is directly upwind of my marina. My fresh crew of two newbies was emotionally divided. 'Tasha was exited and she was soaking up my instruction like brand new bilge pump. Her boyfriend (ironically named Samson) was nervous and seeing sharks in his minds eye. I set the sails on a port tack and gave 'Tasha a shot at the helm, she took to it very well and I began trying to soothe mighty Samson. 

He simply was not having it. Insisting we were healing too much and babbling nonsense about sharks. I decided it would be best to head in. I moved to take the helm back from 'Tasha and began explaining how we would fall off, jibe and go home. That is when I saw a small racing buoy sliding off the starboard side of poor *Duende.* Shit. It was far to late to attempt any kind of maneuver so I said a little prayer and got ready to roll up my genoa. 

We were caught. My little Contest bucked and pointed straight downwind. I quickly brought in the foresail and explained that we would be forced to jibe several times before help arrived. Luckily the anchor was set well and we were not going anywhere. Unfortunately, the race was just about to begin. The first air horn blasted from the committee boat and fiberglass filled with eyes that carefully looked away from us started gliding by. 

As I pulled out my cell I silently cursed my BYC burgee and flamboyant sail choices. I called some family and friends and they came out to tow us off. After a few harrowing attempts we came free. During the process I had managed to drop the main. I had started the engine but would not dare to put her in gear until we were well away from the buoy. So, as we drifted off and waved good-bye to our saviors I explained something to Samson.

I told him that this debacle would be the worst thing to happen to us all day. I intended to go for my sail now and if he did not like it he could risk the sharks on the swim home. Amazingly, this calmed him down completely. We had a lovely sail, lunched in the shadow of Angel Island and I still have not set foot in my yacht club two weeks later. 

I really need to wash some dishes.  ",,False,self,t5_2qiye,False,,,True,t3_1j64js,http://www.reddit.com/r/sailing/comments/1j64js/cruising_in_racer_infested_waters_and/,

It has been a dream of mine to live aboard a sailboat and travel the world,  my interest in sailing was piqued on a week long sailing trip on lake michigan with some friends and sailing has been on my mind ever since. I'm sure this is a story you have heard before and I hope im not rehashing a tired topic but I view this sub as a valuable trove of information.  So basically I would love to travel the world on a blue water sailing boat but I am not sure of the logistics of it.   As far as experience I own the Annapolis book of Seamanship and plan to study religiously and many family/friends are sailers so rest assured I will not embark on any serious trip without proper training(probably take classes honestly). But I want to hear about the financial feasibility of it from people who have lived on a boat and just general info on living  on a boat.  As far as an ocean crossing boat, do I need a crew? is solo feasible? Any tips?  Again I'm sorry if I am bringing up an old topic, I just think I would be a fool to pass up this trove of experience.
EDIT: thanks for all the constructive replies and links, your personal experiences and stories are very valuable, this is probably still years away but its never to early to start planning something this big!

But feel free to have a peek at the [original brochure](http://www.hallberg-rassy.com/monsun/HR31MonsunColourBrochure.pdf). Pretty, isn't she? Sails in very good nick, engine overhauled four years ago, though it does bother me a bit that it's salt water cooled. I've had some bad experience with them in the past. There's an Autohelm 3000 with a spare arm, big, shiny lewmar vinches all around and gauges from raymarine. Inside she's 99% original with solid mahogany and teak everywhere, there's hardly any GRP inside! She's dry and smells fresh, I couldn't find any signs of mildew! Propane kitchen with an oven, new toilet.

She's from 1982, and exactly as old as me! We're meant to be... Extremely sturdy buildt, the hull is over an inch thick below the waterline! Massive grp, and full wooden liner on the inside. Everything on the rig is overdimentioned as well. No sign of rust anywhere on it.

So! Time to start planning voyages!

The title is currently held by [Banque Populaire V](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jules_Verne_Trophy), with a time of 45 days 13 hours 42 minutes 53 seconds. 

The fastest mechanized circumnavigation either goes to the [USS Triton](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Sandblast) (a submarine that circumnavigated the globe in 1960), or to [MY Ady Gil](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earthrace) (then Earthrace) both of which made the trip in about 61 days.  The Earthrace suffered mechanical troubles underway and was later painted matte black, sold to the Sea Shepherd society, and subsequently sunk after a collision with a whaling ship.

Obviously a motor vessel, especially a modern nuclear submarine or aircraft carrier, *could* circumnavigate the globe faster than a sailboat, but I think it's pretty awesome that none have.
