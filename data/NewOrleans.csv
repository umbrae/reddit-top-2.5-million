I get back into town about once a year now, and the rest of the time keep tabs on everyone (yes, everyone) through nola.com and other forums like this one.
Here's my request to you, my fellow NOLAphiles: show me the one thing you most associate with New Orleans. Maybe it's food, maybe it's a jazz band, maybe it's watching the Saints... I don't care what it is. Back stories (first time I ate at this place, etc.) are most welcome. I find myself really missing home this time of year, and all the wonderful people and places that made me who I am.
So dig deep, show me your NOLA, and make me feel like I'm at home.

EDIT: Didn't expect this thread to garner so much commentary on statutory rape laws. Regardless, some good stories in here that make me yearn for home.

The lot is kinda hidden from the street and really isn't used except for a few employees and the garbage dumpster.


So somebody starts pounding on this door like their goddamn life depends on it. I mean, hard enough that it sounded like a volley of cannons was going off in the office. Scares the shit out of everyone.


I go walking back there and open it (not my smartest moment) and there's this little 90lb greasy haired tweaker white dude standing there asking for food. I tell him to go away and he tells me he has a ""right"" to come in and get food because we're a ""church"" and he's hungry. For those of you who don't know what I do for a living... I do not run a church.


I look passed him, and notice there's this 350lb black chick (250lbs of which is ass and tits) leaning against the car. Looking at this broad, the first thing that comes to mind was that she's a heavier version of TT from Reno 911. The resemblance was goddamn amazing. So this fuckin tweaker is begging me for food while she's in the background screaming about me being racist and running a racist church and she's gonna call the mayor and file a complaint. I tell them to both fuck off and slam the door.


So a couple of minutes later, more pounding at the door. And now I'm fuckin pissed. So I throw the door open, and there's tweaker dude again. Now he's going on about his car won't start and wants to know if I'll give him money for a tow truck. The whole time he's explaining this, TT is in the passenger seat screaming at him about how ""she hungry"" and he needs to ""do something useful with his white ass"" and get the car fixed. I tell him I can't help him and slam the door.


About 10 more minutes go by and now I'm curious. I walk over to a window and TT is outta the car beating the crap out of tweaker dude with her purse. She seems me looking at her, and fuckin takes off running across the parking lot, across the street (almost getting hit by a car), and down the sidewalk. So I'm standing there slack-jawed in amazement that a woman that size can run that fast when I notice this chick has no shoes, and no bra. And those big 'ol titties are flyin everywhere.


About another ten minutes go by and catch a glimpse of a truck (a little Ford Ranger) driving through the lot, so I go back to the window. This tweaker and his buddy are talking back and forth and looking at the car. They both walk over to the door... More pounding... I answer... They ask me if I have any rope... I tell them no and slam the door.

These dudes head back over to the car, take out a couple of pocket knives, and in an act of sheer brilliance, start cutting all the seat belts out of the car. I can't figure out what the fuck they're doing until they tie one end under the car and other end to the bumper of the pickup - so there's basically this ""rope"" made out of five or six tied together seat belts. This guy gets in the truck, and fucking floors it. The chain of seat belts immediately snaps and the truck shoots across the parking lot. So being that the definition of stupidity is doing the same thing multiple times and expecting different results, these guys try this 10 more times with their chain of tied together seat belts getting progressively shorter. Eventually there's like a foot of space between two bumpers, this guy gives it another try and it actually holds. 


So this dude in the truck is so damn impressed with himself that he does the only logical thing and slams on the fucking brakes, sending the car straight in to the back of the truck. Tweaker dude comes running up, and the two commence to get in a screaming match about whose fault is that their two beater vehicles now each have an extra dent. Pickup truck dude finally says fuck it and goes flying out of the parking lot and down the road with the car in tow. Tweaker dude pulls a tube of super glue out of his pocket and walk out of the parking lot and down the sidewalk huffing it.


TL;DR Fucking New Orleans.


EDIT: Should add there was nobody in the car when the guy towed it away, so he couldn't have even turned a corner. But I went outside a couple hours later and looked up the street and neither vehicle are anywhere around here.",,False,,t5_2qhp5,1365627558.0,,,True,t3_1c32dv,http://www.reddit.com/r/NewOrleans/comments/1c32dv/so_im_sitting_here_at_work/,

1364239095.0,82,self.NewOrleans,1azo51,People to NEVER rent from in New Orleans,94,12,94,http://www.reddit.com/r/NewOrleans/comments/1azo51/people_to_never_rent_from_in_new_orleans/,"7535 Willow St. - Landlady withheld **entire** deposit ($500) because of a few spots of paint chipped from the wall and a broken set of flimsy, cheapo blinds (which were fucked to begin with). This woman had her father do all of the maintenance work and I know for a fact he kept spare paint in the front storage room. I went back to visit the new residents a few months later to warn them of the scam and found that the paint spots had not even been repaired. Termite infested (during season) and we used to have to use the electric stove for heat during the winter because insulation was so poor. 

7712 Plum St - Also nearly non-existent insulation, with wind blowing in through gaps in the doors/frames. Landlord took *8 months* to repair a broken window, and when he finally did he sent some really really sketchy dude that decided it was ok to use one of my paintings as a dustpan, still managing to leave a huge mess and all of his tools behind. took almost 45 days to refund security deposit, but then caused me to seek him out because he had not signed the check.

930 Poydras - This architect (Wayne Troyer) is the Anna Kournikova of the architectural world in New Orleans; looks great but functionally useless. (EDIT: I was confused by nearly identical features in the two Troyer buildings I had previously stayed in and this one, which was constructed by Eskew-Dumez-Ripple. Still not in love with Troyer architecture, especially as per the massive design failures of Tulane's L.B.C. . I've heard they are filing suit against him) The building is nearly brand-new yet the windows leak when it rains. The paint scheme is seizure-inducing piss-neon-yellow with ridiculously bright rows of fluorescent bulbs that are on 24/7, which really fucks with you after a while. The building is infested with slimy BP employees who drag their glutted selves around with airs of extreme arrogance and self-importance, and the 300+lb one that lived above me would often use a vibrator on himself, which I could hear and *feel* through the ceiling, walls, and floor. Phantom beeping would often permeate through the walls and my sleep was frequently and violently disrupted by helicopters flying around and explosions going off around us during the filming of movies. Speaking of which, the building itself is often used to film in and residents are often barred from entering their own living space at their convenience. There are few things worse than coming home from a long, hard day's work (especially after biking through the CBD and Quarter) to find some asshole with a paper badge and a gun telling you that you can't come in to your own building because they're filming some bullshit C-list Sylvester Stallone movie. There is no compensation offered for these ridiculously infuriating occurrences. The apartment itself was painted a blinding, sterile white and the floors (and ceilings) are nothing but bare concrete, turning the entire place into an echo chamber. My room did not have a door, but rather a sliding piece of wall (with no lock, and a large gap between the door and the floor) and every time I slid it open I ran the risk of ripping out / damaging anything that was plugged into the outlets that were positioned on the other side of the wall, directly in the path of the door-track. The brand new, state-of-the-art, ridiculously over-teched washing machine frequently malfunctioned, locking my clothes inside itself for *hours* at a time, completely fucking with my work uniform, which nearly caused me to lose my mind with unnecessary stress and grief; I almost physically destroyed it in a rage when I had nothing to wear to an important work event. By the time the goddamn thing released itself my clothes were usually mildewed to a point where I had to wash them all over again. Parking in the building is extremely expensive and you have to fight for your spots. I also know I'm not the only one who would miss their car by walking half a floor up instead of down (an easier mistake to make than you think), then start second-guessing myself about where I parked (especially if I had been in a hurry) and spend an extra 4-7 minutes looking for it. There are bike racks with cameras that cover a portion of the room, but someone attempted 4 times to cut my lock. Once you exit the first bank of elevators you have to turn right to reach the second, and all of the people from the second are turning left to reach the first, so you often awkwardly bump directly into each other. Every other resident owns a dog, and these dogs love to piss in the elevators, making them reek something foul. Thus a crew of very sad looking Hispanic ladies is employed nearly round-the-clock scrubbing said piss out of the rugs. Also, frequent episodes of ""Jersey Shore"" play themselves out on the 4 foot deep rooftop pool. 

1424 Dauphine St. - I could write a small book about my stay here. By far the most tyrannical control freak I've ever encountered in my life. This man would frequently dictate to me what temperature I should keep my air-con on (he said 72 was too cold and 74 was more appropriate during the New Orleans summer) even though I paid the bills and he lived in a separate building. He would call me several times a week leaving cryptic, minute-long ""We need to talk"" voicemails a-la Bill Lumbergh without specifying about what, which usually turned out to be someone chaining up their bike to his fence, which for some reason he though I was a part of (even though I kept my bike inside my apartment). He would subtly verbally abuse his wife in front of the other tenants, which was very uncomfortable for all of us, and also felt the need to lecture me on which floor I should set up my bed, and got upset that I couldn't afford more furniture. Took him over a month and a half to refund my deposit. 

ArtEggs Studios - Internet services were offline for sometimes a week a a time (which makes it hard to conduct business), the fumes from the renovation of the studio next to time were so noxious I had to wear a respirator to get my work done, and there was a *massive* gap in the ceiling that ruined any sort of insulation I was hoping for. I was promised on several occasions that this would be fixed, but that was a lie. Landlady withheld entire security deposit ($500) because she claimed the re-paint-job was inadequate (it's an art studio and I invited my girlfriend to freestyle paint over the horribly sterile white walls). She has refused to provide receipts for this job and will not return any correspondences. I also know for a fact that she outsources her maintenance work to sketchy contractors who do half-assed jobs.  

The more you know. 

EDIT: I am so glad this thread has started taking off, and I hope that it saves many innocent renters from criminally negligent and previously impervious slumlords (and ladies).

1369066125.0,74,self.NewOrleans,1ep83m,[Local Politics] Today Louisiana state legislature will vote on HB 103 which would both remove the mandatory minimum and lower the maximum sentence for marijuana possession. Contact your rep today (details inside),88,14,12,http://www.reddit.com/r/NewOrleans/comments/1ep83m/local_politics_today_louisiana_state_legislature/,":edit:  I was mistaken.  they weren't voting on it Monday.  They didn't even begin to debate the issue until today (Tuesday May 21).  Everything else below is valid.

[Here](http://www.legis.la.gov/legis/ViewDocument.aspx?d=843959&amp;n=HB103%20Engrossed%5C%5C%5C) is a copy of the bill in its entirety.

[Here](http://www.legis.la.gov/legis/FindMyLegislators.aspx) is where you can find your representative.

House Bill 103 reduces penalties and incarceration time for those convicted more than once of possessing marijuana, and removes cannabis possession as an offense that qualifies for mandatory minimum sentences under the state's habitual offender ('three strikes') law.

Specifically, the proposal seeks to lower the maximum penalty for a second marijuana possession offense from five years imprisonment to no more than one year. It lowers the maximum penalty for a subsequent marijuana conviction from 20 years imprisonment to no more than two years.

**If you are are in favor of eliminating mandatory minimums and lowering maximum penalties for the offense, you should call your state rep (not US congressman, your state rep) and tell them that you support HB 103 and would like them to vote for it**.  Alternatively, if you want people going to jail for up to 5 years for pot possession, you would call your local rep and tell them you oppose bill.

I've been half-heartedly looking for a home for her for a while, but now that I'm back at work post-baby we really can't give her the attention she needs and it's a bit more urgent. She's really friendly, playful, and energetic - the kind of dog who needs someone who has time to take her for a walk every day and play fetch and whatnot (she kinda rules at fetch.) She's very quiet unless someone approaches the front door; that's the only time she barks. She's not fixed and I have no idea whether she's had her shots or not. Do you know anyone who'd like to adopt her?

My best friend only has liability insurance (she fell upon hard times and had to drop her uninsured motorist protection) so our only hope is to spread the word and hope the perpetrator gets caught so she can file the appropriate paperwork and be able to get a source of transportation back. The intersection was Louisiana and Claiborne. It happened around 2AM while my best friend was on her way to bring a friend home from work. 

My best friend was stopped at the light when a small silver car with a Florida license plate hit the back of her and then sped off. The driver was a female with light colored blonde-ish hair. My best friend's car is TOTALED. Her back windshield is gone and her trunk is pretty much in her back seat. The impact pushed the rear end of her car into her tires so she was not able to follow the woman.

Whoever was driving, I'm sure they didn't get very far (definitely not to Florida). Judging by the damage to my best friend's car, I'm going to assume she will need repairs done before she goes back to Florida, or a rental car, or a tow truck to get her to a shop. She has to have damaged her engine, ESPECIALLY after speeding off like she did after such an impact.

If ANYONE notices or has ANY information regarding a silver (or light neutral/silver colored) car with Florida plates that has a really messed up front-end.

Being born in New Orleans where you are generally below sea level doesnt exactly start you off well for climbing mountains. I finally decided to commit and I quit my job and got on the road at the beginning of last month. My New Orleans habits and attitude have got me in trouble a few times and also helped to make new friends. I almost got arrested in Taos Ski Village in New Mexico for open container, got told I was ""too intoxicated"" and cut off at a bar in Alamosa and recently was kicked out due to the unknown ""last call"". The most useful skill that I picked up in new orleans is playing piano. I have been destroying some open mike nights and when your in a land of country and bluegrass hitting people with some New Orleans funk and R&amp;B on piano can really blow em away. 

I am fairly close with a number of major players in the outdoor community in  New Orleans and I am hoping to act as an ambassador on this trip. I would love to come back to the city and help people realize the outdoor recreation possibilities that can be accessed in the South East. New Orleans is surrounded by water and when I am home all I do is canoe touring. I want to bring these experiences to all of you guys. if your interested in outdoor recreation let me know. I have tons of experience.

I hope yall like what I am doing and if you want you can follow my trip at my Adventure Blog http://monkeyhillmountain.blogspot.com/ I would love to answer any questions anyone has for me about my trip or the outdoors in general but considering im on a massive road trip, unlimited internet is a commodity.

I went to Tulane for my first semester of college in the Fall of 2012, and am now back home for a medical reason. 

Although I'm free to go back when I'm able (Spring 2014) without hassle, I don't know if I can emotionally afford it.

I **love** New Orleans.  I think it's a magical place.  However, the kids at Tulane are not a set I fit in with even sort-of.  

My entire dorm was either not to be seen or out getting blackout drunk most days of the week, which is something I don't do, so I ended up spending most all of my free time sitting on my bed by myself.

I bought a tour book from Barnes and Noble (""Frommer's Guide"") with which I was gonna explore the culture of the city, but everyone was too hungover to go with me.

I wanted to have intellectual conversations, but everyone wanted to talk about how they tried (insert drug) for the first time.

I met a friend who was going to play jazz with me in the Quarter, but he ended up getting sucked into the frat culture and stopped playing his instrument altogether.

Et cetera.

It really really sucked.  The irony is that New Orleans is such a cool place, but being anywhere all alone isn't any fun. 

I tried really hard, too, but ended up just shifting between hating myself and hating everyone else, which isn't normal or healthy.

So it is with great pain that I say goodbye.  I don't think I'd be able to do well academically while being so depressed about my social situation.  

Earlier tonight I sorted through my Mardi Gras beads to make a display for my mom here back home ( [hey look, it's shiny!](http://i.imgur.com/fXeH19x.jpg) ), and it got me really sad hence writing this post.

Thanks for being such a great city; hopefully I'll be able to visit again sometime later in life.  Y'all are some of the nicest people I've ever met.

Wow, definitely more people than I expected were interested. The first class in June is full, but I will try to pick a date in July or August for a second one. That one would already be full as well. 


I have also decided that I am going to do a cut rate ($45 plus your expenses) course for those of you who pretty well know what you are doing and just need to take the course for posterity/legal info.

STILL responding to PMs, sorry if I have not gotten to yours yet!!


--------------------------------------


**ETA1:** 
First, I am surprised at the positive feedback I have received. Thank you guys so much (even you anti-gunners).  I got a bunch of PMs (way more than the comments would indicate) and I am working through them, I might not be able to get back to you tonight. I also realize I was working from the top down in responding, so the oldest PMs were ignored after the few this AM.


Second, a huge thank you to all of you who have PM'd me and honestly represented that you are not part of the target demo/are skilled and just need a permit. I've decided that I am going to do this:


Sometime in July/August, I will have a second course for r/neworleans redditors only and charge half my lowest rate, or $45/person. I can probably take a larger group - no more than a dozen - as it seems like a lot of you are former mil who know how to operate the gear and you just need to take the course. I am OK with this. I am saving your emails and I will update you all as a group later this week.


Third, I will *probably* have a second free course in the future for the target demographic (those most likely to be the target of a violent crime and with little firearms experience), so don't worry too much if you miss this one. Just be sure to contact me so I can give priority for the next course.


So so so sorry I can't respond to everyone's PMs right away, have to go to work! I'll be back. Thanks again, all of you. 


--------------------------------------


Dear all,


In the wake of the horrible assault that occurred near my neighborhood this past February, [I extended an offer to teach a free concealed weapons course](http://www.reddit.com/r/NewOrleans/comments/17znsc/my_best_friend_was_kidnapped_and_raped_last_night/c8aopdl) to this subreddit. Here's the info on this course:


**Me:**


As I stated in that post, I am a concealed weapons instructor based in New Orleans. I have been on r/NewOrleans for several years under another handle (using this one to preserve the anonymity of the other). I am glad to forward my resume and website to anyone who is interested, but I am not posting that info here because I want to keep this low profile and because I don't want anyone to think this is done for PR or any sort of profit. I have another full time job and a wife who I love to spend my little spare time with, so I honestly wouldn't want an influx of business. Someday, I truly hope I can teach without charging for it, as I want everyone in this city to have the *option* to defend themselves if needed.


**The Course (6/9, 9am-6pm, location TBD):**


I took my concealed weapons permit training course in Florida almost 10 years ago, when I was 21. It was in the back corner of a fairground gun show, and I think I paid $50 for it. It was a big group of 25-35 people, and all of them sat silently while the 'instructor' droned through the standard NRA lecture materials for several hours. Upon lecture completion, we took our 'live fire exam' - we loaded two powderless/primer-fired (i.e., probably no more powerful than a BB gun) .22 rounds into a revolver, shot them into a shoe box about 6 feet away, unloaded, and then passed the course.  Afterwards, before we received our certificates, we got a sermon/sales pitch from our instructor to join his church (and I won't name the controversial denomination that it was) in addition to some pamphlets about going to hell. 


I figure that this is a solid curriculum to replicate; mixing an efficient lecture devoid of time-wasting class participation with an easy-to-take test, and then pouring some Jesus on that sumbitch at the end. Obviously, I am kidding - but only partially: When I put together my course a little over a year ago, I **did**, in fact, base my syllabus on that course I took 10 years ago.  That is, I wanted my course to be the complete and total opposite of that farce of a course *that was supposed to teach you how to use a deadly weapon against other human beings.*  Sadly, most courses are like this. Louisiana is better because the requirements here are quite stringent vis-a-vis the contents of the lecture and the testing methods, but even so, it is the bare minimum, and it is typically taught in a diploma-mill, ""get 'em in, get 'em out"" format with sometimes dozens of students. I don't think this is adequate.


My course goes like this: 


* Eight people tops, to encourage participation and for obvious reasons associated with learning the material as completely and comprehensively as possible.
* Lecture on safety, mechanics, technique, and whatever else you want to talk about at greater length (this is usually gear or legal issues).
* An as-comfortable-as-I-can-make-it range session including a rehash of the technique, practice, and diagnostics. 
* An ""improved"" version of the LA state required live-fire test, i.e. you will take all 36 of your shots into a B-27 silhouette target from 25 feet, skipping all the bullshit/easier distances closer than that. (Don't worry, after my course, no one of my students has *ever* failed the 'improved' test - not even close!)
* Completely devoid of religious or political discussion.


Essentially, when you are done, you are more confident, you have the bedrock to base future practice on, the knowledge of how your gun/a gun works, and you can hit a man size target from 25 feet away (under ideal conditions, so don't get a false sense of security from that last part -  practice, practice, practice). You will also have a certificate that will allow you to get your LA CCW permit (assuming all other prerequisites are met, and assuming you are fully confident in your ability to exercise that right).


I am only planning one course for now. Depending on its success and feedback from the students from this group, I will likely offer more (free) courses. I am NRA Basic Pistol certified (along with a host of other qualifications that I won't list here), so this is a legit class that qualifies you for a Louisiana (or Florida non-resident)* CCW permit if you pass the written and firing exams. 


**YOU:**


OK, still interested? Here is what I need from you:


FIRST, I will give priority to women/those of you least able to defend yourself or most likely to be a victim of a crime/those of you who have already asked me about the course in the past. Dudes will be included if availability permits. I only want novices or beginners, if you are already proficient with a handgun, you'll need a special reason for me to teach you for free.  Note: I may ask my wife to attend the course so I look like less of a creep/this ends up being an all-women class.


**Please do not take this course if you just want a free CCW**. Please. 


You cover your own costs (basically range fees and ammo), and I'll teach for free. These classes are typically not cheap - even the cheapest of them exceed $100/person.


**SECOND**, apply for the course this way:


Send me a PM with ALL the following info:

1) Your email address;
2) Your age (you can ballpark it to a decade if you feel more comfortable, but I do at least have to know whether or not you are 21 or older);
3) Your firearms experience level, and;
4) A short note on why you want to take the course.


There are a lot of reasons I want this information, but partially because I like to screen course applicants beforehand to make sure that I am teaching the right people.


**Finally, some parting notes:**


I realize this is a polarizing topic, but I will tell you this: There's a difference between being anti-gun and anti-gunpeople. I am anti-gunpeople myself, and I feel like many, many anti-gunners are essentially, anti-gunpeople to one extent or another, and not necessarily anti-gun. Having worked in the gun industry for almost a decade, I will tell you that gunpeople can be jerks, and their macho, hyper-republican, super-religious, ""if you don't like it you can git out"" bullshit has generally ruined the public's perception of gun owners. I get it. I am not that. This is an educational course, and as such, religion and politics are excluded. You'll feel comfortable, and even if you may consider yourself ""anti-gun,"" you are going to have a good time, or at worst, be a little bored. Expand your horizons a bit and give it a shot. 


OK, that's all I have. I am embarrassed to admit that I am apprehensive about this for fear of negative backlash, so if you disagree or think this is silly, please communicate that respectfully and I will return in kind (no pun).


I can send you to my personal webpage if you want to check my creds or see if there is something you are interested in, I'd just rather not put it on blast right here. PM me for that info.

I live around Jackson and Magazine street. This past Friday I was at Tchoup45, Grits, FnM's, etc having a good time. I was ready to go home and I'll be a little ambiguous about the state I was in. I walked outside to catch a cab but then realized I could just walk to my friend's house around St. Charles and Napoleon. So I started walking. Get to his house, everything is locked and he's already asleep.

SO

I say screw it and start walking to my own house. This walk now just got longer than I had anticipated. I was expecting to get mugged or jumped, and mentally preparing myself for it.

WHEN OUT OF THE BLUE and I shit you not -- some girl decked out in running clothes turns the same corner as I am in the opposite direction and we bump in to each other. 

She literally asks me where I'm headed. . . I point where I'm going. . . she says she's going the same way. . . and asks if I'd like to run with her.

This seemed like a good idea at the time, I take off my shoes, run about 3/4 of a mile with her barefoot until we part ways. No names exchanged no nothing, just light conversation. I don't really know where this was at the time, somewhere in the general uptown area around Touro perhaps.

My legs are still sore even today. And I just need to know if I dreamt all of this up. Which I am 90% sure I did not.

Well if you are of no help then thanks for reading and I hope you were entertained by my story. THANKS!

As we approached the stop sign, two black males (aprox. 16-20)approached our car, one was in the front, the other on the drivers side. They told us to get out of the car, we didn't, I leaned over to my grandpa who was stunned (Like deer in headlights) he slowly started moving and one of them shot at the car, bullet went through the window and hit my grandpa through the arm. We took off and called the cops but the part that frightened me was this happened in my childhood neighborhood where I thought ""would be safer"" since I knew it so well. 
Grandpa is in his 70's, a heli pilot during the Vietnam war for the South Vietnamese Army. He's got a missing finger or two from his time in a POW camp for a couple years, and he stills play the piano. He's hardcore.
Shit happens, could happen anywhere.

Here's the rules:

* Hurricane Isaac and Republican National Convention Mixed Drinking Game: Every time the Republicans say, ""Our hearts and our prayers go to the people of Louisiana"" take a shot. 

* If the power goes out during Mitt Romney's speech, drink the bottle.

* Every time a news caster mentions that Bobby Jindal isn't there because he's dealing with a Hurricane, drink a shot.

* If Hurricane Katrina is mentioned at any point during the RNC by a Republican OR a newscaster, take two shots.

* If lightning strikes outside your home when a Republican mentions any of the following things: God, the Economy, or Healthcare, take a sip of your drink.

* If someone mentions cutting funding to 'useless government programs' take a sip of your drink, if they mention the National Weather Service in any capacity, take two shots for the irony.

* If Bobby Jindal makes it to the Republican National Convention via Satellite, take two shots.

* If a Republican complains about not enough federal aid being sent to Louisiana for Isaac, take a shot. If within the next two weeks, they complain too much money was spent on Isaac, restart the game again, and take two shots.

Edit: I've been adding rules as time goes on. Contribute below!

From thatbox:

* When Cox fails before Entergy, down a beer and switch to rabbit ears.

* Every time a Republican uses a dog whistle term to disparage the racial makeup of New Orleans, take a shot.

* If a Republican rails against federal spending and calls for increased support to New Orleans or stronger levees in the same speech, push the cork into a new wine bottle and split it among all participants.

* If a Republican who has previously demanded budget offsetting for disaster aid calls for disaster aid without naming a cut, take a shot.

From ChiguireDeRio: 

* If any government oficial at the RNC mispronounces ""New Orleans"" drink two shots

I know plenty of other cities are getting active and getting involved and I was wondering if anyone knew of one or would be willing to help me get one started for our city. 

The government has gone too far this time and we can not keep sitting by and letting our right be taken away. So if anyone has suggestions as to what we can do to make our voice be heard speak up and let's get this organized.

Edit: Well I assumed I was getting involved in this late but turns out I was pretty early. We are getting everything more organized in /r/restorethefourth and the IRC channels. We have started to work on design and other publicity gaining mechanisms such as the #restorethe4th hash on twitter and using *[this](http://i.imgur.com/UqUmNKX.jpg)* as a facebook profile to spread the word on social media. I am designing a trifold brochure and will hopefully have that complete by the end of the day today. 
I would like to point out I am only 22 and really haven't been involved in any protest so I have no idea what I am doing so if anyone who has more experience wants to help me out that would be awesome, but until then I will do my best to at least get some people out on the street come July 4th. 
Any questions or suggestions please feel free to PM me.

In this guide I'd like to include: 

*  What people should look for/avoid when moving down here.
* An in-depth description of the main areas people are interested in moving too (Mid-City, Uptown, Downtown, Bywater-Marigny, Lakeview, and others I may have forgotten)
* Also what people should expect before moving here i.e. Don't come down here and complain about the music building next to you that's been here for 20 years. 

Feel free to add any statements/Q&amp;A's of your own. 


Also, we've made it to the 2,000 mark for this sub! I would like to welcome all the new people and if you still don't have a neighborhood tag feel free to message me.

Redditors, you hold a fondness in my heart and therefore I feel compelled to share this information with you to warn you.  If you are looking for a double apartment in Uptown near the CVS on Prytania around the 1st of May, and you are sourcing your prospective rentals on craigslist, you will find mine listed there.  If the ad doesn't scare you off right away, then PM me if you are looking in this area or have any question after meeting or talking to this lady.  I will send you a clip that I recorded with my Dropcam today of her interaction with a prospective renter. You'll get the idea.

The current guide is kind of arbitrary and I can understand how it could be overwhelming to some tourists - hence the ""I read the guide, but where should I eat / what should I do?"" posts. This is just an outline for the food &amp; drink portion - I'll do history, hotels, parks, museums, etc. in another post.

EDIT: Should also add that I think we should limit it to areas of the city that are easily accessible to tourists by public transportation in the areas they mostly stay... We could get in to The East, Metairie, Kenner, etc... But it's probably not worth it.

**I'm just making this post to see what you guys (and gals) think of revising the guide, what you think of this outline, the categories, and so on. If you think it should be broken down differently, or have some better ideas for the layout, lemme know. If you think this is a colossal waste of time, lemme know that as well - or just downvote this post and we'll forget it ever happened.**

The hit the rear drivers side of my vehicle with their car, a silver Impala LS, then ""ran"" to a Burger King a mile away. Smart rite? Someone eventually drove by and told me the people who hit my car were there.  My neighbors drove me there, and I jumped out and got as many pics as I could, of the driver, the car and the plates.

UNFORTUNATELY, they had a temporary license plate, which according to the NOPD, a subpoena has to be issued to get information on. 

So I need your help! If anyone sees this car around, please, PLEASE let me know where? It seems like I'm kind of in a ""If you want things done right, do them yourself"" kind of situation..

This is the only picture I have of him, with my mother and sister at her high school graduation from John Ehret in 1976, five years before I was born.

Here is what I know about him: Ken Burton from Sussex, England.  Sold antiques on Magazine St. Knew how to play piano. Had a dog named Prince.  Was with my mother, Augustine, for at least five years, but left her when he learned she was pregnant with me. I believe they lived together in my mother's house in Gretna.  He would be around 75 now if he's still alive.  

I don't know his birthday or anyone else he is related to. I don't know if he's still in the New Orleans area.

Every now and then I get the urge to find the fucker, but I don't really know if it's possible. So if anyone has any leads, or any advice, I am open to it!

Also, I live in Seattle so my options may be kind of limited, but my sister lives in Gretna and would be very willing to help me with this.

Thanks in advance, even for taking the time to read this!

Hey R/NewOrleans!
Before you ignore this or just mark it off as spam, give me a minute.
I'm in an original rock band from New Jersey. We are looking to book a show in March on our way to SXSW in Austin, Tx. We've been playing together for about four years and are finnally ready to hit the road on our first tour. 
We have emailed a ton of venues and have had very little help. This is a community that I hope will show us some love. 

We are completely independent of any outside influence from labels, agents, booking companies
We record our music in basements and in cabins. 
NJ has been very good to us. 
We're poor, enthusiastic, and grateful for whatever help we get. 

As a gift, you can download our newest EP ""Led Into The Woods"" at TheAmboys.bandcamp.com

I was just coming back from getting a tattoo touched up when I saw three guys watching two girls kick another girl in the head repeatedly. Nobody was doing anything about it.


I have never been subject to the bystander effect, so I go there and ask just what the hell they think they are doing?? I told them to stop kicking her. One of the guys got in my face, ""You don't even know what she did!!"" I replied, ""It doesn't matter what she did... she is unconscious and you dumb fucks are kicking her in the head, you have won, now stop!""


One of the girls goes in for another kick and I shoved her. She goes to the ground and doesnt get up. Her guy friend says that now I am going to jail for assault (Lol... right) So I just swung at him. He dodged it, and his friend in my peripheral came at me with a wild hay-maker swing that I ducked. I grabbed him and we were beating the hell out of each other while his two buddies were also beating me in the head.


I have a black eye and knots all over my head, but the blood that I washed off my hands were not mine after the fight. 


The reason I am saying all this is not because I am bragging or think I am tough, but because these fucking clowns have infected this city too long. They seem to be everywhere and are a blight... they deserve no quarter or mercy. I just wanted to make you all aware and tell you not to be a bystander. If you can fight, destroy them wherever they are.

If we were ever bored we could check the bucket list to see if there was anything we could go out and conquer that day (or night). Obviously these task were pretty singular to my University and full of tradition passed on from other people in my shoes years past. I have realized this city has so much unique charm and heaps of things to offer.

But he and prosecutors agreed to an eight-year sentence, with credit for time served and the remaining balance suspended. He was released immediately.

&gt;Joseph Kemp, 23, and Dominick Grant, 22, both pleaded guilty to accessory after the fact to second-degree murder. Both were sentenced to five years in prison and, like Jackson, offered credit for time served and the remaining years suspended.

&gt;But Clay declined to plead guilty as an accessory, and decided to gamble instead on a second-degree murder trial. He would face life in prison if found guilty as charged.

&gt;On April 1, his attorneys said they were ready for trial, with the second witness called to testify.

&gt;But Assistant District Attorney Jason Napoli asked for a weeklong delay, citing problems with a material witness. Orleans Parish Criminal District Court Judge Tracey Flemings-Davillier granted that request and scheduled the trial for Monday.

&gt;But come Monday, prosecutors were still unable to secure that witness, according to court records. They asked for a delay in trial.

&gt;Clay filed a motion for a speedy trial last July. Once such a motion is filed, Louisiana law requires the district attorney bring a case to trial within 120 days if the defendant remains in jail. If the district attorney does not do so, the law mandates that the defendant be released without posting bail.

&gt;His trial has been rescheduled for July.

I am not talking about one or two roaches, I am talking the walls and floors look like they are moving. It is so bad that they are getting into the fridge. Here's my question, is there some sort of public agency I can report this to? Something like the health department or code enforcement. I have tried every spray, power, trap I can and nothing works. Obviously my slum lord refuses to do anything. If I could afford to move I would. The roaches are in our beds and wake us up by crawling on us. We have to do the dishes twice, once before we eat because the cabinets are full of them and once when we are finished eating. We can't even have open drinks because of the roaches. Every morning the counter tops look like some body poured pepper all over them from the roach poop and egg sacks. The building is full of problems. During hurricane issac my bedroom ceiling started to leak (mind you I am on the first floor of a 3 story building) and my ceiling developed black mold. My slumlords solution was to paint over it. Obviously it has come back. Now me and my roommate have developed allergies and respiratory problems. My roommate and I were healthy males in our 30's, now we have these problems from this apartment. We know it's the apartment because when we leave we are fine, but so as we come home we start sneezing and coughing. This place has turned our lives into a living hell. We feel like prisoners.

She was married once to my grandfather, but long story short it didn't work out. 

She was telling me about a man named Jimmy who she went on 3 dates with back when she was 20ish. She was saying how he was one of the only people who truly made her laugh and they had a natural banter. She said they connected immediately and had a great time each time they were together. At the time she was dating my grandfather and was in love with him, so the Jimmy thing couldn't continue. Which is fortunate for me, but given that she still remembers this man and now probably regrets not spending more time with him, I would like to find him. 

I'm not sure what my goal in the long run is, but if he is still single (or not) I think it could be really great for them to meet again and reconnect. 

She doesn't know his last name or where he went to high school, but he was a New Orleans boy. She went to Sacred Heart so I am assuming he was an Uptown boy as well, but I could be wrong.

In brief, what I know about Jimmy (whose real name, I assume, is James):
-He should be about 72 now
-From New Orleans
-Either owned a sail boat when he was younger or had access to one at the Yacht Club
-He rode in one of the truck parades that followed Rex (either Elks or Orleanians)
- Soon after he dated my grandmother he dated a woman name Peggy Mcinerney for two years

So I guess I'm looking for one of y'alls fathers or grandfathers. The only information I'm going to give out about my grandmother is that her name is Alice and she went to Sacred Heart. 

I may be able to find out his last name through a great aunt. If I do I'll update.

Here's to long lost love.

UPDATE: His last name is Waters. Jimmy Waters.

UPDATE 2: He was born in 1940. They knew each other in 57-58",,False,,t5_2qhp5,True,,,True,t3_rqm2k,http://www.reddit.com/r/NewOrleans/comments/rqm2k/i_know_this_is_a_long_shot_but_can_you_help_me/,

1360775327.0,30,self.NewOrleans,18gc6p,Total stab in the dark - but I am trying to find a nice kid who marched in the Krewe of Thoth,31,1,6,http://www.reddit.com/r/NewOrleans/comments/18gc6p/total_stab_in_the_dark_but_i_am_trying_to_find_a/,"I moved down to New Orleans a few months ago, and this was my first experience with Mardi Gras.  One of the parades I went to was a family one - Thoth.

**TL;DR, saw this kid in a band with a jacked up tuba, who did a really nice thing for a child in the crowd, and I want to buy the kid a new tuba.  But I have no idea how to find him.**

I was sitting down getting a nice buzz with my in laws and all that and after watching band after band, I noticed one black kid playing a white tuba all taped up with duct tape.  I felt so bad for him.  I just immediately felt like I wanted to buy the kid a new tuba.  Everyone else had these nice shiny tubas, and his was all gerryrigged with duct tape.

But I suck as a human, and all I did was just let it well in me without taking a picture or doing anything tangible about it.

As fate would have it, the parade got stalled with him right in front of me.  Right about this time, one of my little 3-year-old cousins (in law) started to pitch fit.  His parents were trying to corral him and this tuba kid noticed, and WHILE STILL PLAYING, tried to take a beat off his neck and give it to the kid.  The bead got hung up on his tuba, and I could see him getting frustrated about it.  Rather than just saying ""screw it, too bad kid"", he kept persevering while playing and got the beads off.  By the time he did, the kid had already calmed down, and so neither he, nor the parents realized this kid was giving them beads to the child because he was crying.

My heart broke watching this, but I was kind of just watching it like it was a TV show, and it didn't hit me that I should have taken a picture or done something to identify this nice kid.    It's been eating at me for three days.  I spent 2 hours online trying to find pictures of Thoth so I could look through them and try to identify him.

So, how can you help?

**Find me sources of pictures or video**.  Nothing listed here (yet):  http://www.mardigrasparadeschedule.com/krewes/thoth/
Nola.com only has like 10 pictures.  

Most of the stuff I saw on Youtube (understandably) focuses on the floats and dancers, not the bands.

**Identify what group/band he was in**
I saw this guy's pictures on Flickr - I THINK this may have been their attire:  http://www.flickr.com/photos/rigolphotography/8466544173/in/photostream.  But if that's the Irish Channel Corner Club, then it's not this kid's band because I saw a video of them, and it's not them.  It could have been these guys:  http://www.flickr.com/photos/rigolphotography/8466547503/in/photostream.  I seem to recall the band being largely black, so it may have not been the second group.  I'm just remembering that he was wearing red.

**Get me a list of every band that marched in Thoth.**  Then I can try to search youtube with the school/band and Thoth and maybe come across his picture and narrow it down.

All I know is that they were fairly close in the parade to the Roux La La girls.  Like 2 or 3 before or after them.",,False,,t5_2qhp5,1360776415.0,,,True,t3_18gc6p,http://www.reddit.com/r/NewOrleans/comments/18gc6p/total_stab_in_the_dark_but_i_am_trying_to_find_a/,

I've been obsessed with the city since I was a little girl, and visiting twice in the past year only intensified my desire to just do it.

Today is the last day at my (great) job. I sold most of my stuff and am taking only what fits in my small car. I'm sleeping on a friends' couch until I get on my feet. I know like four people in the city, and only two of them well. 

Have I pulled a Gob and made a huge mistake? Am I going to be homeless and playing harmonica on Decatur within the month? I'm so excited, but then it hit me at my goodbye party at work today that...holy shit, tomorrow I will be unemployed. I'm leaving the people I've known my whole life to go to a place I've spent a collective two weeks in. Am I fucking insane?

I suppose I just need to hear something positive. If anyone has any suggestions of places to apply (I have years of PR/Marketing experience) that would be great. And if anyone wants to go out for a beer next weekend, that would also be great! I arrive next Thursday. 

Thanks for listening. Can't wait to breath that swampy night air!

EDIT: Thanks everyone. I really appreciate all of your (even BobKelso's) input. I'm excited for this adventure and I'm optimistic. I'm a tenacious person, and will give it my all - that's all I can ask of myself in life.

Sitting outside drinking beer for the few days after the storm is all fun and games until someone gets bitten by a mosquito.

2.) Please remove all projectile objects out of your yard.  I don't want it coming through my window.

3.) Turn off all electronics before the power goes out (especially if you are evacuating).  You don't want to come back to your house on fire because a burner started up when the power came back on.  Trust me, I will not try to extinguish your burning house. 

4.) Chainsaws / axes.  People's driveways/garages get blocked constantly by fallen trees and large branches. Be prepared to cut and move them out of your way so you can escape.

5.) Candles.  Nighttime sucks when you can't see anything.  Also - interesting fact: As of today, candles don't require batteries to operate.  (But don't burn down your house. See #3 sentence 3.) 

6.) Matches to light candles mentioned above.

7.) Start your generators and let them run a few minutes today. Make sure your oil is good and everything is ready to go.

That should be it. Other than the rest of the obvious stuff - dry goods, beer, charcoal for the pit, batteries, flashlights, etc. 

Mention often forgotten things in the comments please.  

Everyone be safe!


ETA:

- Battery powered radio or TV with antenna to keep current with information after the storm.

- Fill bathtub with water before storm hits.  You may need to use some in the tank for the toilet, they don't run on magic. 

- Fill water in tupperware containers and freeze, also place fridge on coldest setting.  (Thanks geekgirlpartier and BobKelsoMD)

- Have emergency contacts outside of the area ready.

Your generosity and hospitality was extraordinary. I'm sorry we kept you up until almost dawn. 

I wish I remembered your names.

I went back to Bar Tonique a couple of days later to leave an open tab for you, but it was a different bartender and my description of y'all was insufficient to jog his memory.

But meeting you two was one of the highlights of our trip. We'll be back, and we'll be looking for you. In, you know, a good way. Not a stalkery way.

I hope y'all read reddit.

(See, here's what happened: after pinballing all over town meeting people we knew from various social media sites, we ended up sipping Dark and Stormys at Bar Tonique with a couple of new friends who unfortunately had to work the next day, so when they left, we moved to the bar. My wife and the bartender compared tattoos, we all had shots of some sort of clove/cinnamon schnapps-type thing, and I struck up a conversation with a friendly couple who invited us back to their apartment around the corner when the bartender finally shooed us out around 3:30 AM.

Help my little brother who just can't catch a break?,28,1,22,http://www.reddit.com/r/NewOrleans/comments/12gzuh/garageish_sale_help_my_little_brother_who_just/,"My little brother pretty much followed me to New Orleans. He struggled for a while but then landed his dream job and had an awesome girlfriend. Within 4 days he was laid off from his job and his girlfriend dumped him. 

Then about 2 weeks after that he was robbed at gunpoint outside of his house they stole his cell phone and his wallet then used his debit card for over 1000 dollars before he could get his hands on a phone to cancel it. I have recently moved out of town and he is going to come and live with me because he is my beat friends and he just wants to start over in a new place. 

Since his debit card was stolen and used his bank put a 90 day hold on his bank account and he cannot access any of his money. He learned this when he tried to buy a plane ticket to come out to where I am. So since he has to fly out here he is trying to sell all of his stuff. Here is what he has.


42"" Sony Flatscreen - $500

Dresser - $50

Vintage/Retro Couch - $30

22"" Proview Computer Monitor- $60

Long Black Light - $5

TV Stand w/ glass doors- $40

Awesome Headboard/Cabinet/TV Stand with Dimmer- $50

Portable 8"" Toshiba Dvd player- $95

Free weight dumbells, pull up bar, perfect pushups - $60

24"" TV- $40

Bar height table with 2 stools- $200

2 David Clark aviation headsets -$300 each

Full size bed frame. Its a simple metal riser one -50

Thanks for looking!


TL;DR NOLA has eaten my brother's soul and he is selling his stuff so he can move.

We had a lot of redditors there. Looks like we will be sticking around, so stay tuned for more events in the future! And we apologize for the DJ/band situation, but we hope everyone had a great time and found something to engage in. 

UPDATES: This is now a REviction (as in ""return to life"") party!    Also, the musical acts are subject to change due to the short notice of the event, but we always put on a great show no mater how impromptu. And we start working the door around 11 pm.

EVICTION PARTY! Party or Bust or BOTH! The St Claude treehouse faces eviction! Tomorrow night we're having an old school treehouse party. If you got love for the treehouse and what it provides for the community (free use of power tools and resources, free gallery space, small underground music venue, keeping kids out of trouble, etc) come out and show your support.
 

Hit us on Facebook at NOLA arthouse.  https://www.facebook.com/pages/The-NOLA-Art-House/146787733409

$5 donations, or whatever you can give!

Party starts at 11ish.

If you live out of state, or can't make it to the event tonight but still want to support us you can donate here. Huge thanks to those who already have, between this, the new renters, and the party tonight we feel pretty confident about making our goal.

The post got a fair amount of upvotes, so I figured I would upvote and try to push it further.

Contra to what most people thought, it actually passed the LA House, but now it's stalled in the Senate.  The bill needs a 2/3 majority to be discussed in the Senate, and fell 6 votes short.  According to [this link] (http://www.nola.com/politics/index.ssf/2013/06/marijuana_pot_possession_senat.html#incart_river), it will get another chance today.

If you are are in favor of eliminating mandatory minimums and lowering maximum penalties for the offense of marijuana possession, you should call your state senator (not US Senator, your state senator) and tell them that you support HB 103 and would like them to bring it to discussion.  All you are asking them to do is vote yes SO THAT IT CAN BE DEBATED ON THE FLOOR at this point.  

[Here](http://www.legis.la.gov/legis/FindMyLegislators.aspx) is where you can find out who your state senator is and these are the 19 people that need the most attention:

Here are the 8 people who abstained from the vote:

* Appel

My 60 year old Dad came down for his second visit and to see Eric Clapton last weekend at the Arena. The concert was great and we bonded as Clapton played ""Hello old friend"" for the first time since my Dad saw him live in 1978 and we shared a moment as he played ""My Father's Eyes."" But the most powerful memory came a night before at the Arby's on Canal. 

I live in the CBD so we went out on Friday night to Frenchman...drank some Bourbon and diets and made our way home via Bourbon. We stopped at Lafitte's and sang ""Rocketman"" in the back while sharing a Voodoo Purple drink and some cherries and started the walk back to the CBD. As we reached Canal, he let me know that the old prostate was kicking in and he didn't know how far he could make it. I gave him a hard time for walking past multiple stops on Bourbon (just like he used to give me a hard time for ""not going before we left"" on road trips when I was a kid) and we accelerated our pace trying to make it to my apartment. As we got closer, he knew he wouldn't make it all the way home. He started to run ahead before ducking into, of all places, the storied Arby's on Canal. He immediately darted up the stairs and tripped on his way (the old man had become a lightweight as the years passed) and a group of young men laughed at his struggles. Unbeknownst to him, the mirrors at the top of the walls on the ground floor allowed me, and everyone else in the establishment, to watch his struggle as he searched in vain for an unlocked restroom. He bounced from door to door with that telltale hop in his step until he settled in front of a garbage can. He paused, and relived himself into the trash receptacle as the same group of young men giggled. I stood in line pretending to be a paying customer until he came back downstairs. Finally, he stood by my side and said that he wasn't really hungry . We snuck out while the door guard was distracted and walked home. When I explained the mirror situation to him back at home he replied, ""well, everyone needs a New Orleans story, right?"" I felt closer to him than ever before.

Very abrupt.   Even a bit ... rude?



Yes these were both women.   Now I know people will explain where this ""stranger danger"" is coming from.    But more importantly, is there some way I can rephrase that?    Do I just avoid the subject altogether?   





I'm no tourist.   I have a community of friends here and I'm serious about staying here.    Becoming a local.    Trying my hardest to build up a stronger comedy scene in town and to that extent I'm producing a comedy festival in November for that purpose.
