I was bored today, and decided to play around with the checkbox ""hack"".

For those who don't know what that is, it's basically creating CSS click events with checkboxes and it doesn't involve any javascript.

This is how it's done:

    input[type=checkbox]:checked ~ div { }

So here's my code, let me know what you all think. It's not really meant to be UI/UX friendly, but just a neat little demo.

Thanks all!

What turned out to be the most painful job was cleaning up the CSS, it had literally thousands of unused selectors and rules.

I tried an extension for chrome which didn't work, and then installed ""Dust-me selector for firefox"" (https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/dust-me-selectors/reviews/), which worked like a charm.

However... this identified all unused selectors, but many rules had multiple selectors, and it did not provide any functionality to actually remove the rules that no longer add any selector.

Since thousands of them were unused, I ended up writing my own python tool to remove them (https://github.com/ccontavalli/css-tidy).

I discovered cssutils for python, which found lots of errors in the CSS, and also comes with tools like csscapture, cssparse, csscombine. I discovered csstidy, and several sites doing validation and cleaning.

Overall, I spent &gt;= 4 hours for a job that should have been pretty straightforward to do, given the right tool.

So.. here's the question: what are tools to work with CSS that worked well for you? some that didn't work?

There are two things I'm asking for here:

1) General resources for picking up CSS layouts. Anything that's helped you understand what the hell is going on under the hood is appreciated.

2) It seems like my biggest gap in my understanding is what gets inherited and what gets overwritten. EG: If the innermost element is set to display: inline, but its parent is set to display: block, and a sibling of the parent is set to display: inline, this somehow actually results in the child and ""uncle"" displaying inline.

Allow me to introduce myself.",22,5,14,http://www.reddit.com/r/css/comments/kn8bw/why_hello_allow_me_to_introduce_myself/,"Greetings, subscribers of /r/css!  My name is airmandan, and I am your new mod.  I noticed that the person who originally created this reddit had only posted twice in the last year, and hadn't posted in here in over two years, so I asked the admins if they wouldn't mind if I took over.  They kindly obliged.

What does that mean for you?  Nothing too drastic.  I like this community and would like to see it continue to operate the way it has independently, without too much intervention from me.  You may recognize my name as the creator of [/r/firstworldproblems](http://www.reddit.com/r/firstworldproblems), and if you subscribe there, you'll know that I have a very hands-off approach to moderating.  I don't feel the need to micromanage a community.

As you can see, I've put two simple rules into the sidebar:

1. No spam.
2. Be nice.

The sidebar spends some time explaining those two items, but I think they're pretty simple and don't represent any drastic change in direction for this community.  I also clarified this community's raison d'être and mission over there in the sidebar, which basically reflects what the community had already been doing before I came along.

That last point, of course, raises the question: if the community had been managing itself effectively for the last two years without me, why does it need me?  To answer, I'll give you an aviation metaphor: even the best autopilot needs a person to land the plane (which is not actually true anymore, but just give me enough leeway to say that it is for our purposes).  I won't interfere with your posting, but if your posts accidentally get stuck in the spam filter, now you have someone to ask to dig it out.  I will also try to grow this community so that we have a robust userbase with a lot of knowledge and experience to draw on.

Finally, I'll be working over the next few weeks to implement a nice custom style for this reddit that shows off what CSS can do.  If you've been watching First World Problems for the last couple weeks, you've no doubt noticed me tinkering with its design to make reddit's default...*utilitarian*...design a bit more user-friendly.  Once I finish over there, I will take what I've learned about styling reddit and apply it here in a way that makes us look both unique and innovative.

If you have any questions or comments, please do let me know.  I will monitor both this thread and my modmail for any input from subscribers here.  I look forward to working with you all and growing this community to make it the best it can be.

Having said that, it's relying on a third party CSS parser so it's loading two additional js files and there's still room for performance optimizations. Also, I still have to add support for IE10 'vm' instead of 'vmin'. When that's done, you'll just write code using vmin and the shim will do the translation to 'vm' for you.

Let me know and I'll set it up on github.

I'm confused as hell, though, by the myriad of options out there for what should be a simple task: building a static page (or 1-page app) with a good, clean set of code, with tools that make the job easier, not require you to spend days learning and configuring them.


I learned Compass and have been using it (it's really good for making cross-browser stuff less of an issue and gives you CSS variables, which are awesome), but it doesn't have a grid system. I also like HTML5 boilerplate, but it doesn't interact with compass. Right now I've got HTML5 boilerplate with its css ripped out and compass spitting out its css, plus the zen grid compass plugin. I can't help but think: this should be a lot simpler. This is too many plugins for your plugins, a rabbit hole of github projects and framework-ception.


So what's your 'stack'? Is the one I described not actually that complicated? What's a realistic toolkit for what I'm doing?

My web design lecturer told me that every time you see an ID in a rule you add 100 to the specificity value, then you add 10 for every class and 1 for every tag name then the rule with the highest value is the one that takes priority.

I would understand that fine but I made the following page:

    &lt;p id=""test"" class=""a b c d e f g h i j k""&gt;Blah&lt;/p&gt;

With the CSS:

    #test{
        color:blue;
    }
    .a.b.c.d.e.f.g.h.i.j.k{
        color:red;
    }

From my understanding the text should be red because it has 11 classes and hence a specificity value of 110 whilst the first rule has a value of 100. When I load the page the text is blue. Can someone explain to me what I am missing here?

So it's probably better to just use a much lighter framework for this project. 

I would like something light (css only and maybe some JS to handle really shitty old browsers), with ie7 support, proper media queries in it, cross browser compatibility, and nice clean and organized code that a noob can easily follow. 

My original choice was ""skeleton"" but reading a comparison review on vermilion made me second guess that choice:

""Responsive considerations seem like a bit of an afterthought. Examples: tabs do not stack for mobile versions; 1-column images (tiny, since it's a 16-column grid) go to full-width (huge) in the two narrow layouts. ""

In my head it makes sense, but I feel like when I try to practice it, I always get unexpected results.

and

    color: #fff;
but to match a mockup you may end up doing this later

Should the sheets be consistent by expanding white and black to `#ffffff` and `#000000` respectively?

So the idea is simple. Split a box into two sub-boxes.
The trick is that everything should be percentual - no fixed sizes (EDIT: apart from potential margins).

One way to do it is setting a *float:left* to both sub-boxes and their *width*s to 80% and 20% respectively. The problem with this method is that some browsers will break the second box into a new line. This can be avoided by setting the widths to 79% and 19% or something similar, but now we get a gap on the right side of the blue box in most browsers.

So how do we do this cross-browser without any gaps?

And another thing, how do we then add our own (fixed size) margins to the red and blue box?",,False,,t5_2qifv,True,,,True,t3_j33s2,http://www.reddit.com/r/css/comments/j33s2/is_it_possible_to_do_this_for_every_browser/,

I decided to run a test, and here are the results.

After much searching I finally found a 'Near English' phrase that had 0 Google results (it was a hell of a lot harder than I thought it would be).  'staminified dawg' was my key.

I have a domain that I use for random css/php/js tests that was registered on March 23, 2012 and currently has a pagerank of 3 (how I have no idea).  So, I set up some ::before and ::after elements in the form of...

    .petal:before {
    content: ""staminified dawg"";
    display: none
    }


    .petal:after {
    content: ""staminified dawg"";
    visibility: hidden
    }


(The display and visibility were used separately to see if there was any effect from either scenario)


At the same time I linked a new page off the index.html and checked webmaster tools to see the index status.  All the other pages had been indexed.  3 weeks later... the page has been botted since, and the new page had been indexed. 'staminified dawg' still has 0 hits on google.   

So what do we know?  Only that ""staminified dawg"" has yet to be indexed --we still don't know if the {display: none} and {visibility: hidden} tags have had an effect.  

The next step is to make the {content: """"} tags visible on the page and get somethign else indexed at the same time  I guess we'll get a little bit more of an answer then.

I need something beyond the basic tutorials everyone recommends to get started. Where's step #2?

I know a lot of this comes with practice, but is there anything that can at least guide that practice along? I just don't even know where to start most of the time, and practicing generally turns into me putzing around for hours and not accomplishing anything.

This grew into a crude draft of a syntax for computing a color value based on another color value.

For example, a common practice of mine is to make :hover colors of links lighter than in their default state.  This has to be done separately for every link color, but this new syntax would allow the hover color for every link to be declared as, say 20% lighter, only once.

Any channel of a color value (red, green, blue; hue, saturation, lightness; alpha) could have some simple arithmetic (add, subtract, multiply, divide) applied to produce a new color.

I went through the CSS www-style mail list archives basck into 2008, and only found a brief discussion of a subset of these capabilities in [Color lightening and Darkening](http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-style/2008Aug/0239.html).

Is this a capability that others would be interested thin?  Does it follow the spirit of CSS?  Would it end up being too computationally expensive?  I think this is a pretty cool idea, I'm wondering if I should pursue it further.",,False,,t5_2qifv,False,,,True,t3_h1lvl,http://www.reddit.com/r/css/comments/h1lvl/i_thought_of_an_addition_to_the_css3_color_module/,

I have no idea what he means unfortunately. CSS code is over my head right now until I learn. Can you help me know what he meant? Also, point me in the right direction to have posts appear on the front page like I want. Thanks!

Also 1 last thing sorry to keep bothering you.  How do I make each post appear uniform in length?",,False,,t5_2qifv,False,,,True,t3_13uz0j,http://www.reddit.com/r/css/comments/13uz0j/i_messaged_the_creator_of_thisiswhyimbrokecom_for/,

Here's my HTML, followed by my CSS:

This is my index.html (trimmed for clarity):

    &lt;body&gt;
        &lt;div id=""container""&gt;
            &lt;div id=""header""&gt;
                Header Stuff
            &lt;/div&gt;
            &lt;div id=""content""&gt;
			    &lt;iframe src=""home.html"" frameborder =""0"" name=""mainframe""&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
			&lt;/div&gt;
		&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;/body&gt;

This is the page that appears in the iframe, home.html:

    &lt;body&gt;
		&lt;div class=""contentdiv""&gt;
            Frame content
        &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/body&gt;

And here's my CSS:

    html
{
height:100%;
}

    body
{
min-height:100%;
height:100%;
background-color:#953b3b;
font-family: 'Lato', sans-serif;
overflow:hidden;
}

    #container
{
position:absolute;
width:100%;
height:100%;
}

    #header
{
text-align:center;
z-index:50;
height:15%
}

    #content
{
position:relative;
height:85%;
width:100%;
}

    iframe
{
position:relative;
height:100%;
width:100%;
}

    .contentdiv
{
position:relative;
height:100%;
overflow-y:scroll;
}

When I do this, it works all nice, except that the bottom of the contentdiv extends below the bottom of the browser window, just a teeny bit.  It's almost exactly 3% when I have my browser on fullscreen.  If I set the height of .contentdiv to 97%, it more or less exactly fixes it.  But if I shrink it to a window, I can see that the smaller I make the window, the more extends below the bottom.  When I put content inside the contentdiv, the bottom of the scroll bar is cut off too.

I cannot figure out what the heck is going on.  What is forcing my div to be bigger than the window, and which div is being forced?

Thanks to anyone who can help me figure this out.",,False,,t5_2qifv,False,,,True,t3_13fsgn,http://www.reddit.com/r/css/comments/13fsgn/losing_the_very_bottom_of_my_pages_and_cant/,

This demo will only take you to the second link if you click within 500ms. Otherwise it returns to the next default state (red or blue in this case, but that is purely for illustration). I only prefixed webkit and moz when I was working on it, so be sure to change it if you are on Opera or IE9-10.

Basically, the first click begins an animation cycle that displays an outside link and then displays yet another at the &gt;99%keyframe, this means that the final bit of animation lasts ~5ms, so the transition is seamless. Instead going back to the original state it goes to a new position that display another link that is identical to the first except for its href. Clicking this new link animates again and then returns us to phase 1. 

I used a viewport and movement to get this effect, but I am certain that other methods of obfuscation would work just as well, but it was easier for me to get this working correctly. 

It might be overly complex, but it is the only implementation of the feature in pure CSS that I know about. Any thoughts on improvements?",,False,,t5_2qifv,False,,,True,t3_yrd2y,http://www.reddit.com/r/css/comments/yrd2y/css_only_double_click_using_a_round_robin_of/,

I've floated the tags to the left and right though it seems it's stacking them horizontally rather than vertically when I do that. Is there a simpler solution to moving my tags to the side of the screen or is it my method of vertical positioning that's the issue.

1370626859.0,6,self.css,1fvi09,[Firefox-specific] Do there exist any zoom-independent sizing units? (Please read before judging!),7,1,4,http://www.reddit.com/r/css/comments/1fvi09/firefoxspecific_do_there_exist_any/,"I have a question which a lot of people here will take to mean a lack of understanding of Web design, so I want to explain myself first.

*I am not developing a Web page* or anything that is going to be used by anyone except me. Rather, I am using the [Stylish](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/stylish/) addon for Firefox to allow me to style various pages to my own needs.

Secondly, I am styling Firefox's built-in `ImageDocument` page - the page you see when you go directly to an image link such as http://i.imgur.com/jMMcgbr.gif, which allow you to click the picture to magnify it, and so on. I have a [Greasemonkey](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/greasemonkey/) userscript that I made that allows me to style these pages.

So, onto my question. I have a background image that I am tiling behind the image itself using CSS like this:

    body.userscript-ff-imagedocument img.decoded {
      background-image: url(""data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAABAAAAAQCAYAAAAf8/9hAAAAAXNSR0IArs4c6QAAACVJREFUOMtjZCAM1PBJMjFQCEYNGAwGMBKKZwYGhlujgTjsDQAAwO4BRcMF20YAAAAASUVORK5CYII="") !important;
      background-size: 5px auto !important;
      background-color: rgb(240, 240, 240) !important;
      box-shadow: 0 0 1em rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.75);
    }

(""userscript-ff-imagedocument"" is the class which my userscript adds to the BODY tag when it detects an `ImageDocument`.)

This background image allows me to easily see where transparency exists in the image. However, when I zoom in, the background zooms in with it, which makes it difficult to tell where the image really has transparency and where that's just part of the image. (The `background-size` property makes it a bit easier because the background will move around a little when zooming due to Firefox quirks, but this is obviously not optimal.)

So, my question: **Is there any way to specify units for the `background-size` property that are zoom-independent?** Even if they're only available on internal Firefox pages, that should be okay since this is an `ImageDocument` and not a regular HTML document.

(And it should go without saying that if you're wanting to use zoom-independent units in actual Web design, you're going about it the wrong way and alienating a lot of your viewers. I actually don't expect that this functionality exists, but I figure this would be the best place to ask just in case it does...)",,False,,t5_2qifv,False,,,True,t3_1fvi09,http://www.reddit.com/r/css/comments/1fvi09/firefoxspecific_do_there_exist_any/,

This is more idle curiosity than anything concrete.

I know Compass already contains something like this, but I wanted to build it myself to get a good handle on things, and Compass's are a bit too much information all at once.  What I'm really trying to do is a create a reference of prefixing / bad spec implementations for various flexbox properties in order to better-tackle them in the future.  I'd probably never use flexboxes for anything other than a mobile site right now, but it's a fun project nevertheless.

Here's what I have:

    .display-flexbox {

                  flex: 1; }
    
    .flex-order, .box-ordinal-group {
      -webkit-box-ordinal-group: 2;
         -moz-box-ordinal-group: 2;
          -ms-box-ordinal-group: 2;
           -o-box-ordinal-group: 2;
      -ms-flex-order: 2;
               order: 2; }
    
    .flex-direction {
      -webkit-box-orient: horizontal;
         -moz-box-orient: horizontal;
          -ms-box-orient: horizontal;
           -o-box-orient: horizontal;
              box-orient: horizontal;
      flex-direction: row; }

The class names are just demonstrating which property each is attempting to effect.

Any comments?  Have I put in anything unnecessary, made any mistakes, or left anything out?

Anyone have a good setup for dealing with justify-content in the most-possible browsers?

edit: left out my box-sizing one.  Nothing to it, though:

    .box-sizing {

         -moz-box-sizing: border-box;
          -ms-box-sizing: border-box;

edit:

I wanted to bound a container to the height/width of the viewport, and than bound children elements to that container. This is only possible by utilizing and setting heights and max-heights, along with widths and max-widths. The issue I am discussing is how come everything will work fine, but when it comes to constraining children elements the computed CSS for max-height is not being used as an override for the height css of the container.

I know the other solution for this would be avoiding height all together and just using positioning with left, top, right, bottom all set **but I am confused by why the CSS engine isn't rendering the max-height to constrain children elements**.

I don't know what I did wrong, I'm no expert, but I know my way around basic html/css... and removing a featured tag as far as I know should have little or nothing to do with the css that's holding the featured box together.

I'm relatively new to CSS, been dabbling here and there for a bit, but still consider myself a beginner. I'm trying to design a simple website for my husbands high school reunion and I'm in the stage of simply designing the layout. I currently have three div's, one for the header, one for the menu, and the third for the main information on the site; however, my issues arise when I try to add padding to the div for the main information and layout of the menu div when I'm on a monitor with less resolution. 

When I comment out, or remove the line of code for padding, the div spans the page 100%, but I want to add a 5% padding to the left and right so there's some spacing between the left and right of the body text. When I add 5% padding to the left, the left side of the page looks fine, but it pushes the text of the div off the right side of the page and requires side-scrolling to get the rest of the information. 

As for the menu, I'm not using any absolutes, just percentages, and on my larger, external monitor, the menu items are all horizontally listed, but when I disconnect my monitor and work on my laptop monitor, the menu items get stacked on top of each other.

How can I 1) get the padding for the main text fixed, and 2) get the menu to stay aligned so it's constantly lined up properly?

Similarly, with the height of ""box"" being set at 100%, it takes more than that which makes the scrollbar of nothingness appear (scroll bar even though there's nothing to see by scrolling down). Any ideas on that?

I'm putting together a proof of concept for an interactive graphic for a class project. The idea I had is to have pictures of different foods, which resize corresponding to their percentage of different nutritional values (e.g. fat or carbs) when you click on a link to that particular nutritional value.  

I can't seem to get this to work. Here's the HTML I have:  

    &lt;a href=""#tag1""&gt;Tag 1&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=""#tag2""&gt;Tag 2&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=""#tag3""&gt;Tag 3&lt;/a&gt;

    &lt;div id=""tag3""&gt;
    &lt;div class=""sourcreamstandard""&gt;&lt;img src=""sourcream.jpeg"" /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
     &lt;div class=""sourcreamtag1""&gt;&lt;img src=""sourcream.jpeg"" /&lt;/div&gt;
     &lt;div class=""sourcreamtag2""&gt;&lt;img src=""sourcream.jpeg"" /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
     &lt;div class=""sourcreamtag3""&gt;&lt;img src=""sourcream.jpeg"" /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
     &lt;/div&gt;
     &lt;/div&gt;
     &lt;/div&gt;

And the CSS:

     .sourcreamstandard img {
     	height:50px;
     	weight:50px;
     }

     .sourcreamtag1 img {
     	height:50px;
     	weight:50px;
     	position: relative;
     	top: -50px;	
	
     }

     .sourcreamtag2 img {
     	height:50px;
     	weight:50px;
     	position: relative;
     	top: -100px;	
     }

     .sourcreamtag3 img {
     	height:50px;
     	weight:50px;
     	position: relative;
     	top: -150px;	
     }

     .sourcreamstandard, #tag1:target img {
     	display:none;
     }

     .sourcreamtag1 #tag1:target img {
     	height:400px;
     	weight:400px;
	
	
     }

     .sourcreamtag2, #tag1:target img {
     	display:none;	
     }

     .sourcreamtag3, #tag1:target img {
     	display:none;	
     }
  
And so on, with :target pseudo-classes for every one of the tag links, the idea being that when a tag is selected, the images while take on the CSS classes which hide them or resize them when appropriate. I'll go through and add some CSS3 stuff to get smooth transitions for image resizing once I get this working.

Hi. The above image is the relevant part of the website. The three bold headings (name email and declaration) are dt items in a definition list. The text under each is obviously the dd items for each.

The css I've used to position the menu and style it is as below.

    #menu /* menu position */
    {
    	width:210px;
    	height:300px;
    	float:right;
    	text-align:left;
    	margin-top:-30px;
    	margin-left:-300px;
	
    }

    ul  /* list decoration (removal) */
    {
      list-style: none;
    }

    #menu a /* menu static link decoration */
    {
    text-decoration:none;
    color:#dddddd;
    }

    #menu a:hover /* menu hover link decoration */
    {
     text-decoration:underline;
    }

    #menu ul
    {
    border:1px solid #7a7a7a;
    padding:0px;
    width:200px;
    }

    #menu li /* menu */
    {
    	border:1px solid #dc5d72;
    	padding:5px;
      	background-color:#b51032;
    	border-left:8px solid #741617;
    }

    #link_menu /* menu heading */
    {
    	font-weight:bold;
    	margin:0px;
    	color:black;
    	background-color:#dddddd;
    	text-align:center;
    	border-left:0px;
     	font-size:25px;
     }

    #menu li:first-child /* menu */
    {
     	border:0px;
    	padding:0px;
    }


I'd like to stop all the &lt;dd&gt;s from flowing over the top of the menu div. I've tried applying clear:both; and clear:right; to each of the separate children in the details section but none make it stop :(

Please help :D


**EDIT: Fixed it. The #menu{margin-left:-300px;} meant that the div wasn't actually where it was. I had it there because the &lt;hr/&gt; above the details section was cutting off ~400px before the right side of the page. I must have deleted some padding somewhere because now, even though the margin setting is gone, it still rules to the edge of the page.**",,False,,t5_2qifv,True,,,True,t3_s0a4e,http://www.reddit.com/r/css/comments/s0a4e/need_help_with_text_flowing_over_a_div_element/,

Positioning things within the console div has proven to be a PITA so I'd like to ""absolutely"" position elements within it.  Is there any way to do that?

Where this is coming from:  At the top left of the console is a 200px wide logo div.  At the top right is a nav div with a few links.  Below both of these divs I wanted to put a 900px wide div to hold content, but instead of having some spacing between them, they touch.  No manner of margin-ing or padding would shift the content down.  I tried adjusting the positioning elements as well but nothing moved.

Any links to good positiong tuts would be appreciated.
