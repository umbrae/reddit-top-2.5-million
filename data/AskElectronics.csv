1358354877.0,32,self.AskElectronics,16owyj,"Here's a Rail Splitter circuit: +30V in, ±15V out.  aka ""Virtual Ground""",38,6,27,http://www.reddit.com/r/AskElectronics/comments/16owyj/heres_a_rail_splitter_circuit_30v_in_15v_out_aka/,"In [another thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskElectronics/comments/16k8ul/does_anybody_else_hate_negative_supply/), I mentioned a simple active Railsplitter circuit.  Someone asked me to post the design, so here is the [(schematic)](http://i.imgur.com/tyhdM.png).   
   
A non-grounded 30V input (from a Wall Wart) is converted into a pair of ±15V rails and Ground.  It's just the CMOY headphone amplifier's two-resistor rail splitter, followed by a high current x1 buffer.  R1 and R2 divide the 30V input in half, then the opamp and Darlington power transistors drive the output to that voltage.
   
I've used Q1 as a VBE multiplier to set the DC bias current in Darlingtons U2 and U3.  I chose 10 mA of bias current; you can change this by adjusting the trimmer potentiometer R4.  Start with R4 = max resistance, which will be minimum bias current.  Then slowly dial up R4 while monitoring the supply current.  When supply current has increased by 10mA, that's your setting.  
  
I spent lavishly ($0.51) to purchase low-ESR output capacitors, from the sexy gold-and-black Panasonic FM series: [link](http://www.digikey.com/product-detail/en/EEU-FM1V221/P12411-ND/613772).   
   
Simulated circuit performance is shown in these two plots: [(sine)](http://i.imgur.com/xROW2.png) , [(square)](http://i.imgur.com/CvpdH.png).   
   
In the first plot, I'm driving a 2 amp peak-to-peak sinewave at 50 kilohertz, into/out of the virtual ground.  VG moves by ±7 millivolts, so the output impedance at 50 kHz is 7 milliohms.   
   
In the second plot, I'm driving a ±1 amp square wave into the virtual ground.  It recovers smoothly, with no overshoot, ringing, or other transient misbehavior.   
   
I chose a 1980's vintage bipolar opamp, the NE5532, because (a) it is rated to work at supply voltages as high as 44 volts; (b) its GBW is 10 MHz which is fast but not too fast; the Darlington output stage contributes about ten degrees of additional phase shift at 10 MHz; (c) in this configuration neither the inputs nor the outputs see rail-to-rail swings; (d) the 5532's output stage can drive lots of current when called upon; this speeds up the step response.
   
You'll notice that I used a 3-pin IC current source, the [(LM334)](http://www.jaycar.com.au/images_uploaded/LM134.PDF) with a set resistor of 14 ohms, resulting in 4.6 milliamps bias for Q1.  I prefer to drive the VBE multiplier (a constant-voltage circuit) with a constant-current source.  This way, Q1 has a constant VCE *and* a constant ICE.  Aaaah, nice.
  
EDIT- fixed reference designators U2, U3.   
   
EDIT2- Here is a [(photo)](http://i.imgur.com/ccYaT.jpg) of the prototype.  I used thru-hole because I wanted heatsinks bolted to the board, and because I wanted to use these big honking 20 ampere green colored terminal blocks for input and output.  Addutionally, I thought it would be fun to measure performance with different opamp types installed, so I used a DIP socket: that also called for thru-hole construction.

1334241769.0,27,self.AskElectronics,s67uv,Heres a gain-of-100 amplifier for 5 MHz signals,31,4,19,http://www.reddit.com/r/AskElectronics/comments/s67uv/heres_a_gainof100_amplifier_for_5_mhz_signals/,"There's another thread over [(HERE)](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskElectronics/comments/s4x4s/design_need_to_amplify_5mhz_signal_100x/) where folks are discussing assorted different schemes to amplify a 10mV, 5 MHz sinewave by 100X.  I decided to ask LTSPICE whether this could be done without any ICs, using junkbox transistors.  The answer was yes.
   
LTSPICE says to use the 2N4401 transistor which sells for nine cents in quantity one at hobbyist websites [(EXAMPLE)](http://www.futurlec.com/Transistors/2N4401pr.shtml).  If you buy it in a surface mount package, quantity 6000 or more, the price drops below 2 cents [(REF)](http://search.digikey.com/us/en/products/MMBT4401LT1G/MMBT4401LT1GOSTR-ND/919608).
   
So here's the [(SCHEMATIC)](http://i.imgur.com/vYien.png).  It's utterly straightforward: an emitter follower input, 3 cascaded common emitter gain stages, and an emitter follower output.  Each amplifying stage uses a teeny bit of gain-peaking (via small capacitors C22, C32, C42) to extend the bandwidth.  The circuit uses standard E96 resistor values [(REF)](http://www.technick.net/public/code/cp_dpage.php?aiocp_dp=guide_standard_resistors_table).
   
The frequency reponse (Bode) plot is [(HERE)](http://i.imgur.com/n8KCM.png); I've put a cursor at 5MHz: gain is 100X (40 dB).  The amplifier finally ""craps out"" (-3dB bandwidth) at 75 megahertz, so the end-to-end GBW product is 7.5 Gigahertz.  Not bad for 45 cents worth of semiconductors.   
    
*Edit- Forgot to mention that because this is a cascade of an odd number (3) of Common Emitter stages, the amplifier as a whole is inverting.  That's why the mid-frequency phase (on the Bode plot) is close to 180 degrees.*   
   
**Edit2- For those who wish to calculate power dissipation: The numbers you need are: (a) Supply = 12V; (b) Base to Emitter voltage of Q2, Q3, Q4 = 732 millivolts.  VBE of Q1 and Q5 are approx the same. (c) At DC, the ratio (IC/IB) of Q2, Q3, Q4 is 213.  The ratio for Q1 and Q5 is approx the same.**   
   
Edit3- The 2N2369 transistor model, also presupplied with LTSPICE, looks a lot [(faster)](http://www.reddit.com/r/ECE/comments/s7zz2/extract_transistor_speed_parameter_ft_in_spice/) .

I'd like to present one possible solution which uses inexpensive NPN power transistors to implement a snubber.   
   
The circuit is [HERE](http://i.imgur.com/90ZsO.png) and its performance in SPICE is [THERE](http://i.imgur.com/ulFhQ.png) .  
   
N channel power MOSFET M1 switches a solenoid on and off at 10 kilohertz.  The solenoid current is 19 amperes (blue curve).  When the MOSFET turns off at time t = 50 usec, the inductor has huge di/dt and so the drain node voltage shoots up.  The snubber circuit turns on and clamps this voltage to about 20 volts, which is well below the absolute maximum VDS rating of the MOSFET.   
   
The conventional approach, using a [FLYBACK DIODE](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flyback_diode) would require a diode rated for 19 amperes, and would take 10X longer to dissipate the energy stored in the inductor's magnetic field, since the diode dissipates (V x I) watts and V is 10x lower.  (Vdiode = 1.6 volts, Vsnubber = 16 volts).   
   
*Edit1- number typo, missed the Ninja Edit window*   
   
*Edit2- a different [(version)](http://i.imgur.com/5Sptr.png) whose snubber uses a MOSFET rather than a pair of NPNs.  approx. same cost but lower parts count.*   
   
*Edit3- since folks are discussing power dissipation of the individual snubber components, I would like to remind everyone (including myself!) that the series resistance of the solenoid, ""Rcoil"", is included in the snubbing circuit loop.*  ***Some of the energy stored in the inductor's magnetic field, is dissipated in Rcoil.***  *Don't forget!*",,False,self,t5_2se13,1340839679.0,,,True,t3_vozcx,http://www.reddit.com/r/AskElectronics/comments/vozcx/design_heres_a_snubber_circuit_for_16_amp/,

Why is this happening and how do I fix it?,19,0,36,http://www.reddit.com/r/AskElectronics/comments/nixq3/repair_my_metaltopped_table_is_producing_an_ac/,"My computer desk is a 5'x3' wooden table with a stainless steel top (not solid, just a thin sheet of metal on top of wood). It's sitting on a carpeted concrete floor. 

The other day, I noticed that I could feel a slight tingle pain in my wrists resting on the tabletop when I was touching my keyboard (aluminum, USB). It was so slight that I initially just thought it was a teeny bit of something that was causing the discomfort, but after realizing I could feel it in both wrists, it became clear that it was likely electrical in nature. To confirm, I got out my Fluke DMM, connected one probe to a building ground, then touched the other to the table top. It read ~55V AC!

After seeing this, my first thought was that one of the computer parts or peripherals on my desk had a short and was touching the metal table surface. Not seeing anything that was obviously contacting the surface, I started removing things one by one to find the culprit. Here's where it got interesting: every object I removed caused the voltage reading to drop by ~5-10V, but eventually, after removing everything from the table, it still read ~2V. Adding things back to the table causes the voltage to increase. 

A bit of additional experimentation showed that plugging anything in near the table caused the voltage on the table surface to increase, though not as much as if that item was actually sitting on the table. 

I'm fairly certain that the tabletop is picking up an electromagnetic field from nearby wiring or devices and this is somehow creating the voltage I can feel and measure. 

Also, I have been using this table for my computer for six years and this is the first time I've ever felt that tingle. Nothing was recently added or removed from the table, so I suspect atmospheric variables may be a factor.

My questions to AskElectronics are: 1) What is actually causing this voltage and 2) What's the safest way to resolve this problem? I thought about just connecting the table surface to a ground, but I wanted to make sure that was safe.

**Answer:** The resistor is used to limit the current to a safe value. LEDs are semiconductors, diodes in particular. The current flowing in an LED is an exponential function of voltage across the LED. The important part about that for you is that a small change in voltage can produce a huge change in current. That is the most important concept of this article. Resistors aren’t like that. The current and voltage in a resistor are linearly related. That means that a change in voltage will produce a proportional change in current. Current versus voltage is a straight line for a resistor, but not at all for an LED.

I guess if the inductances were fairly high it would be simple. I started out thinking that perhaps I could use a computer audio card or an arduino or something like that but the problem is that some of the inductances I would like to be able to measure are low - (in the nanohenry range) Which seems like it would present problems. I don't know.
What do you folks think? 

I guess I also am wondering what other kinds of inexpensive options there are for measuring inductance. I suppose I could use the formulas to wind up my own coils exactly as specified (known values) and then compare them to unknown coils using an oscillator and a meter. Or resistors using a ""Wheatstone bridge""?

EDIT: Found [this web page](http://reibot.org/2011/07/19/measuring-inductance/) and I already have all the parts, including the LM339, except that this may not work well for high frequency inductors, they say.

(or What should I do differently when drawing schematics in the future?),22,6,23,http://www.reddit.com/r/AskElectronics/comments/17mhzq/do_my_schematic_break_any_conventions_or_what/,"~~Schematic: http://i.imgur.com/y7jd390.png~~

**UPDATED Schematic: http://i.imgur.com/eI8qx80.png**

Hello, I have drawn a schematic with a knock pattern recorder/playback circuit. It was initially built with an Arduino Uno and then adapted to run on a bare ATTiny85.

I started by splitting the voltage regulator to a separate circuit because I've seen it done before and I appreciate the way it cleaned up the circuit. Did I go too far in making all peripherals separate schemas as well?

Also, I don't have a VCC symbol, only a named net from the Vout of the regulator, I do however use GND symbols. Is this bad practice? 

It's done with EAGLE, as most of you can probably see, with a minimum of label adjustments etc. I figured default settings were quite close to standard conventions. 

Sometimes I see a box with a frame around schematics with an information area containing project name and author in the lower corner, but I couldn't figure out how to do that. The frame and the description texts are just wires and text added to the Guide layer. Not sure of all the layers' purposes so I improvised.

Any advice/correction is welcome.

*TL;DR Did I do something dumb in my schematics? Tell me.*

**Update 2013-02-01 13:42:00**

Thanks for all the feedback! 

The [updated version](http://i.imgur.com/eI8qx80.png) above implements some of the suggestions made. Some of the other suggestions requires me to look into certain components or the software (EAGLE) but will be added: 

* Add protection diodes and proper power switch for battery. 
* Attach solenoid directly to battery via voltage divider or separate regulator. 
* Put a zener diode on the piezo element for spike protection. 
* Change the battery connector symbol to something showing polarity signs.)

However, as soon as I put the capacitor C1 in there, everything goes stupid. Oscillations, the gain collapses etc.. 

This is the standard active second order low pass set up, correct? So what gives? Simulation tells me it should go weird, but only when I drive it with an op amp. And putting a capacitor in between the output of O2 and the + input of O1 doesn't help.

There are a number of ""found"" electronic component packages all over the robot for detail and movie effect. These items range from various mosfets, resistors, capacitors, to Bourns trimpots. However, there is one part in particular that has eluded us for **many** years now.

[Picture](http://i.imgur.com/UATt3g7.jpg)

[CAD Model](http://i.imgur.com/DZUSrub.png)

This part is used on top of the robot's head (3 times to be exact), as well as the chest, back, and lower torso. It is used approximately 9 times on the entire robot, if not more. Because of how frequently it occurs on the robot, we think *it may have been something common or easy to obtain at the time*.

The part measures approximately 1.9""L x 1.165""W, and 0.265"" in height at it's tallest point. It is painted a dark grey (*one might say black*) with a copper-painted raised extrusion. As you can see in the pictures, it has a TO-127 package attached to the top, as well as an IC.

It bears the numbers 1 through 6, *possibly indicating pins and/or their locations*.

It may have had a hinge on the sides. *It could have been two parts, perhaps two connectors together*.

We *may* be looking at the *bottom* of the part. We do not know.

I want to point out that **ALL** detail pieces used on the Johnny Five robots were electronic in some nature, therefore there is no reason this part would not be electronic in some form.

Original material is unknown as the head of the robot was cast in fiberglass. It could have been metal or plastic.

Things we have considered it could be (and searched countless Ebay listings and Google Images):

* Micro/mini cassette tapes &amp; cases
* Vintage transistors
* Transformers
* Audio amplifier ICs
* Relays
* Circuit breakers
* DC to DC converters
* Connectors, edge connectors, SCSI connectors, various cable ends &amp; shells

No oscillator, no PWM, no opamps, no NE-555s.  Just transistors and resistors.  Milliamps and volts.
   
I put together an analog fan speed controller design, using a thermistor sold by a popular hobbyist website.  [HERE](http://i.imgur.com/lBaFA.png) is my schematic.  It consists of   
   
* 3 discrete transistors   
   
* 5 resistors   
   
* 1 thermistor (to sense the air temperature)   
   
* 1 fan: 12 volts @ 1 ampere  (thus Requiv = 12/1 = 12 ohms)
   
Simulated results are in [THIS PLOT](http://i.imgur.com/sY8Zz.png).  When the air is cold, the fan spins slowly.  When the air heats up, the fan goes faster.  You can adjust the temperature-vs-speed curve by altering the values of R2, R5, and R6.
   
I used a P-channel MOSFET simulation model that I happened to have lying around; in real life you wouldn't select the IRF7220 because it's a surface mount device, rated for less than 3 watts.  In real life you'd use something like [THIS](http://search.digikey.com/us/en/products/FQP27P06/FQP27P06-ND/965349), a big honkin $1.20 transistor rated for Waaaay more power dissipation than this little circuit will ever produce.  But I didn't have a simulation model for the Big Bertha device so I used what I had.  As long as you choose a PMOS rated for &gt;20 watts and with RDS(on) &lt; 0.1 ohms, you'll be fine.  It's a 12 volt circuit so you don't even need ""Logic Level Gate"" transistors, saving a few pennies.  You *do* need a power transistor, to deliver the 1.0 ampere that the fan needs to go full speed.

Essentially, this works on two principles: binary and diodes. Binary because I know it takes a specific pin on/off combination, based on a binary system. Diodes because it heavily relies upon the direction of the current though the LEDs to only power one of them.

I currently can't think on how to do this, but any help is greatly appreciated!

Now, there seems to have been a recent push to manufacture low-loss capacitors, meaning those with lower and lower ESR. If one uses low-ESR capacitors in a board, then the board resonances can become quite high Q, and store a significant amount of energy.

1355248050.0,13,self.AskElectronics,14oacj,Here is an inrush current limiter circuit for 230V switchmode power supply,15,2,6,http://www.reddit.com/r/AskElectronics/comments/14oacj/here_is_an_inrush_current_limiter_circuit_for/,"I saw that someone is wondering how to replace an inrush current limiter (NTC thermistor) at the input of a 230 volt switching power supply.  This reminded me of Motorola application note AN1542, **[Active Inrush Current Limiting Using MOSFETs](http://www.bonavolta.ch/hobby/files/MotorolaAN1542.pdf)** so I implemented the Motorola idea in LTSPICE to see if it would work.  Answer: yes.  
   
[HERE](http://i.imgur.com/mADRb.png) is my circuit schematic.  It works by installing a relatively large resistance (R1) in series with the existing 80uF filter capacitor (C2).  R1 is large enough to limit the inrush current to less than 2 amperes.  The equivalent series resistance of C2 is modeled by ""R_esr2"".   
   
As the DC voltage of the top rail rises, MOSFET M1 sloooowly turns on, gradually decreasing its drain-to-source resistance and gradually shorting out resistor R1.  The slow turn-on is provided by the Thevenin equivalent resistance of the (R2, R3) voltage divider, driving capacitor C3.  Zener diode D5 protects the MOSFET's gate terminal and keeps VGS comfortably below the datasheet maximum.
    
Simulation results are shown in [(this plot)](http://i.imgur.com/WcKNz.png).  The blue trace is the top rail supply, asymptotically approaching 230 x sqrt(2) volts.  The green trace shows the drain node of the MOSFET.  Very gradually, the MOSFET turns on and pulls down its drain more and more, until eventually the drain is a flatline waveform at ground.   
   
The MOSFET's gate is plotted in red.  You can see that it hasn't hit its asymptote even after 300 milliseconds.   
   
The simulation circuit includes a 0V voltage source ""Vxxx"".  This is merely a convenient way to monitor the current that flows from the bridge rectifier, to the filter capacitor (and the load).  Current is plotted in the bottom panel in light blue.  You can see that it never exceeds 1.5 amperes.   
   
I made a before-and-after [(plot)](http://imgur.com/IySbP.png) to show the effects of installing this circuit (R1 = 180 ohms, plotted in blue), versus leaving it out (R1 = 50 milliOhms, plotted in green).  The circuit schmeers out the charging time of filter capacitor C1, reducing the peak current at inrush.   
   
You'll notice that I added another, smaller filter capacitor (C1) along with its equivalent series resistance (R_esr1).  I made C1 = 5% of C2 but this was an arbitrary choice and you may want to experiment with it.  Perhaps you may find that C1 = 0 (!) gives acceptable results.   
    
Summary of circuit modifications:
   
* Add a second filter cap (C1) whose value is ~ 5% of existing cap   
   
* Install an inrush current limiting resistor (R1) in series with the existing filter capacitor.  Choose R1 such that the inrush current is less than XX amperes, whatever spec you are trying to meet    
    
* Install an Nchannel MOSFET that shorts out the inrush current limiting resistor.   
   
* Drive the MOSFETs gate from a voltage divider (R2, R3) and a timing capacitor (C3).  Protect it with a zener diode (D5)   
   
*Edit- it's not at all clear how to choose a wattage rating for current limiting resistor R1.  Belt and suspenders conservative people might say: 1.5 amp peak = 1.1 amp RMS, times 50% duty cycle, equals 0.55 amps.  Power is less than or equal to 180 x 0.55^2 = 55 watts.  Others might say, ach ptui, all the excitement is over in 150 milliseconds, derate by a factor of twenty: 3 watts ""ought to"" be just fine.*",design,False,self,t5_2se13,1355263176.0,design,,True,t3_14oacj,http://www.reddit.com/r/AskElectronics/comments/14oacj/here_is_an_inrush_current_limiter_circuit_for/,

If some veteran board experts could add in some of their own knowledge, maybe we can make an official guide for designing PCBs. Most of my experience comes from designing dc to dc switching supplies, so there is still plenty for me to learn.

* Use as few layers as possible. This is pretty intuitive, but especially in things like SMPS layout, having only a few layouts will improve things like circuit capacitance.

* On that same note, make sure that every part that has an exposed pad under it is connected to ground. Double check any part you are unfamiliar with to see if it has an exposed pad under it. Nothing feels worse than not realizing the parts you ordered have an exposed pad.

* When switching high currents, watch for stray impedance on your board. Use nice thick traces and keep everything short. When switching high voltages, watch for stray capacitance. Make sure you have lots of isolation around your traces and try to route everything so it doesn't have to go under these lines.

* Keep ceramic filter caps near the load or input in order to keep ground loops short. Ceramics have low impedance, so if the board has too large of an impedance, then they won't do you much good at all. When using aluminum caps, you can generally place them anywhere on the board, as they have such a high impedance that they aren't as sensitive to placement.

* When you have multiple layers on a board, you'll save yourself some headaches if you try to run traces vertically on one layer, horizontally on another wherever possible.

* Run differential pairs next to each other on the same layer. Often, the pair will be specified to be 100 ohms, but depends on the application.  Keep the impedance of the two lines the same, otherwise you may get a phase delay, which will affect performance.

* If you are going to assembling boards by hand, don't go bellow 0402 in part size. If you aren't very comfortable with soldering surface mount yet, stick with 0603 or above.

* On sense resistors, make sure you have low inductance resistors. Generally, this means choosing resistors that the manufacturer specifies for current sense.

* The recommended layout for most of the RF/microwave components I've seen includes an uninterrupted ground plane.

3. [A picture of the breadboard.](http://imgur.com/KsYRX,0XrtD#0)

First off, I know very little about induction, this is the first ever radio project I have successfully gotten to work, and I've gotten this far largely by trial and error. I added the second 555 in an attempt to boost the carrier frequency from ~550khz to ~1100khz, for some reason this boosted signal quality(amplitude?) significantly but not the carrier frequency. I added another 555 in the same configuration, but the result was a decrease in signal quality. I have no idea why this happened. Also what is happening with the wave form here? The only tool I have at my disposal to even try and look at this is a digital logic probe.

I added the toroid because the guide suggested an inductor and it was all I had laying around. I don't know how to calculate the inductance on it, if someone could explain this to me like a 5 year old I would really appreciate it. Also, I'd like to know WHY the toroid works so well there.

The antenna was added by touching random spots on the circuit with my finger and looking at where the signal increased. For some reason This was off pin 1 of the 555s. Once again, no idea why.

Finally, the signal itself is present at 530khz all the way to ~800khz with another very weak signal around ~1100khz range(harmonics?). Is there anyway I can narrow down the signal? I hate to think one of my neighbors might be a short wave operator and getting pissed as hell at this thing leaching into their bands.

What I'm wondering is, how do they actually work? I understand the crystal side of it -- apply voltage across crystal, it resonates quite accurately at a known frequency, but how do the caps come into play?

I've read the [wiki page on them](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crystal_oscillator), and it talks of the ""load"" capcitor:

&gt;have a specified resonance frequency with a known 'load' capacitance added to the crystal. For example, a crystal intended for a  6 pF load has its specified parallel resonance frequency when a 6.0 pF capacitor is placed across it. Without this capacitance, the resonance frequency is higher.

But the circuit diagrams I've seen have the capacitors going to ground from either end of the crystal, not across it.

All this stems from designing a board for a micro -- the uC datasheet doesn't say much about the circuit, just ""connect the crystal to these pins"", effectively, and I'm trying to figure out what cap values to use. The datasheet for the crystal I'll use (ABRACON ABLS series) says ""Load Capacitance: 18pF"", and ""Shunt Capacitance: 7pF max"", but I'm not sure what to do with those values.

My random googling hasn't turned up much, where can I learn how the crystal circuits work and what cap values I should use?

It has 11 pins, of which I have figured them to be
VCC,  Y0 to Y6, GND, SIN, CLK.

I am hoping that someone with experience enough can have any guesses on how this device actually works from the behavior I have been able to figure out.

This is what I think:
Y0 to Y6 are the 7 rows in the display. CLK is the clock to the device, SIN I don't undestand but if it's LOW I cannot light new leds on the display only scroll (move one step right) already lit ones by ticking the clock( CLK-LOW, wait1s, CLK-HIGH)

Heres my usage example:
So, I set CLK-HIGH, SIN-HIGH, Y2-LOW, Y0,Y1,Y3..Y6 HIGH and start ticking the clock then the leftmost led on the third row (y0 is first) starts to shine followed by the led to the right of that (see it as the leftmost moving right and the new leftmost being lit). 
This is all well, something that confuse me much is that if I now set Y3-LOW all the leds that were lit on Y2 also get lit on Y3 and does not seem to let me program the Y3 and Y2 leds separatley (or any rows, all rows always have the same leds lit).
If I set SIN to LOW It seems I cannot set new leds (the leftmost ones) as I tick, but the old ones that I have set do move to the right.

My questions are:
The original device was able to not only scroll right-&gt;left, but also up-&gt;down with different messages but I am only able to scroll left to right.
I obviously also wonder how I can make leds on different rows differ on the same column.

Any ideas or thoughts are appreciated! Its an arduino mini that the display is connected to if that makes any difference.

So I scored a plasma TV on Craigslist for $25.  They said it was broken, so i figured it'd be worth it to try and fix.  What they said happened was they heard a small POP then the picture went out - they also might have seen a little bit of smoke coming from the right side of the TV.



What I've done so far:

Took the back panel off, inspected each board fairly carefully for any blown caps, blown fuses, burnt-out ICs, but wasn't able to find anything.  When I power the tv on, there is indeed no picture, but you can see some flashes of static in horizontal bars about 3"" wide once every 5-10 seconds, and they seem to be fairly random.  When the TV is on, if i get real close to the boards on the back, i can smell that ""magic smoke"" smell coming from the Y-MAIN board (which is in the right place to be consistent with the seller's smoke story), but i can't actually see anything burning.  I figure something went wrong with this pcb, and from reading online, it seems like the Y-MAIN board is a common failure in plasmas and LCDs.

So my question is, does anyone know of any good resources for diagnosing this thing?  Any specific components i should check on this board, or things to look for that i might not be catching?  I see these y-main boards going on ebay for around $70, but if i could replace any components, that would be better.  I'm pretty good at soldering, so i don't think that should be a problem.

I'm not clear on when to use a capacitor and of which size.  I know you can cause damage without them but I couldn't understand this case.  Wouldn't pin 18 still see 'High' without it?  Is it a voltage issue since it's from the 5v source?  Maybe it has something to do with the long lead wires and possible flickering of the signal from the sensor?

What would happen if it wasn't there at all?
What would happen if it was a 1μF capacitor?  
What would happen if it was a 100μF? 
(would 100μF just delay the High, until the capacitor was fully charged/energized/capacitated, then extend the high signal?  Maybe becasue the script is polling that pin every 1 second so as not to miss a quick 'high' signal?)

still learning, but i'm affraid to do damage on my pi experimenting on my own.

After seeing [naval_person's diagram](http://i.imgur.com/Nmg0415.png)  I thought that a 555 probably wasn't the best approach, so I decided to try a different 8-pin chip: the TL082 dual opamp.   
   
My [(circuit schematic)](http://i.imgur.com/YREfjeg.png) is pretty straightforward: the dual opamp is used to generate a triangle wave, which is applied to the two LEDs by emitter followers Q1 and Q2.  Here are the currents through the LEDs, when the Frequency_Adjust potentiometer is set halfway: [(waveforms)](http://i.imgur.com/udGqZ6t.png).  Repeat rate is about 80 seconds.   
   
This circuit works because the TL082 is a JFET-input opamp.  Its input bias current is negligibly small, so we can use very high impedances to get very long ramp times.   The JFET input has a second benefit: opamp U2 is used as a comparator, so its input differential voltage is sometimes very large.  Huge deltaV isn't a problem for JFET input opamps, but it can cause troube for bipolar opamps with back-to-back input protection diodes.  Linear Technology includes [(this figure)](http://i.imgur.com/RN6O9MZ.png) in many of their datasheets to remind customers of these diodes.   
   
*Edit- forgot to say that TI also sells the TL072.  It is the same JFET input opamp as the TL082, except the TL072 is designed/tested for especially low noise.

Is there a specific way to connect the resistors or can they go in either orientation? I'm very sure that all the LED's were connected correctly (anodes to +, etc).

One way to do this is to use an exotic high-voltage, rail-to-rail opamp IC followed by a discrete power-driver [(ref.3)](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskElectronics/comments/14i98s/designing_a_temperature_controller_with_a/c7ddmqz).

It might be fun to address this problem without using exotic parts.  So I came up with [(this circuit schematic)](http://i.imgur.com/k6DvV.png) that uses a commodity IC and three commodity discrete parts, and yet, seems to solve the problem -- as long as you heatsink adequately.   
   
Frequency response is shown [(here)](http://i.imgur.com/yXM0d.png).  Bandwidth isn't earth shattering: just 145 kHz.  But I imagine it's more than adequate in a temperature control application.  Phase margin is a very forgiving 80 degrees.  
   
Opamp U1 is used as a fixed gain (R2/R1) block, feeding a common emitter amplifier Q1 with current source load Q3.  These drive an Nchannel MOSFET source follower M1, which supplies power to the 20 ohm heater load.  Zener diode D1 sets the opamp's supply voltage at 15 volts, and Zener diode D6 prevents M1's gate-to-source voltage from exceeding the VGSmax specifications on the datasheet.

I get the concept of a resistor. I know i can use Ohm's law to take the voltage and  ohms and get the current. But all of this doesn't really help me understand what's going on.

so lets say i have an LED that has a forward voltage 1.9-2.0V and my netduino is putting out a voltage of 3.3v. Well my brain tells me i have to drop the voltage so put in a resistor. Now the LEDs i bought came with 200ohm resistors and they work. But why? How would i know if the resistors weren't included?

Now, i am reading a book that talks about resistors and basically says, assuming you are using an LED with a 2.1 volt forward drop, a 150ohm resistor will limit the current to 8mA. Well doing that math, that was taking ohms law (3.3 - 2.1)/150 = .008. But what does that mean? does that mean the LED changed the voltage?

The book goes on to sat that 8mA is the maximum current rating for the digital pins. Wouldn't that mean it's putting out that much to begin with?

I hope my statements clarify my confusion to those who are knowledgeable. It bothers me that i can't take a component that says it needs 1.2v and know how to change 3.3v to 1.2v or something similar. Do i really have to have a voltmeter or can this be done with math?

I am trying to find the best component to drive a high amp PWM signal. My application will require ~30V and up to 20amps (100% duty cycle.) 

The highest amp optoisolator I can find is rated for a max of ~5amps which means id have to string a bunch of them together.

Obviously there are SSR (solid state relays) which could handle the task with respects to current, but Im worried about their long ramp up time causing a loss of PWM resolution.

-For reference I am using a PWM controler with a 12bit resolution so I ""think"" that means I need something which can ramp up/down inside of ~100us

-I also need something that is relatively simple as ill need to make quite a few of these circuits and if I need to have 10 components just to do this once its going to be a bit cost prohibitive...


Does anyone have any clever ideas here?

Components used are:

R1 = R2 = 240 ohm, 0.6 W (as they specify)

T1 = T2 = 300 volts, 120 amps MOSFETS (they use 100 volts, 35 amps)

D1 = D2 = 15 A, 600 volts Schottky diodes (they use 1 A, 70 V)

C1 = 2 microfarads, 1000 volts polypropylene capacitor (they used 330 nanofarads, 1000 volts)

L1 = 6 loops in 3/8"" pipe

L2 = 750 microhenry toroidal inductor

I'm using a 12 V, 100 amp power supply.

Anyhow, I've hooked it all up, I think correctly, and when I switch on the power supply it apparently trips a circuit breaker as the fan starts for a fraction of a revolution before the power supply turns off and then it won't turn on for several minutes after this happens.  At 12 volts that instruction site seems to imply about 4 amps, which my power supply should be able to supply handily.  I tried hooking up a few 1000 microfarad capacitors in parallel with the power supply (as suggested in their troubleshooting section, to deal with initial surge current) but the same thing happened.

1) Is this indeed a circuit breaker tripping?  I don't know what else it could be.
2) How is the current draw of an induction heater determined?
3) How can I get this to work?

Edit: Tested MOSFETs and diodes, all fine.  Removed input inductor to avoid inrush current, no change.  Removed capacitors, no change.  I think I'm going to get a new power supply that's a little more transparent.

The task I want to do is to show visual stimuli (simple shapes, color blocks, etc, coded in MATLAB) to our experiment animal (fish) while it's being mounted on a microscope stage (not a lot of physical room, hence the need to use a tiny LCD). 

Here's are some TFT-LCDs that other labs have used:

[LCD 2](http://www.weartronics.com/products/320M)

I've been tasked with creating a 12VDC (automotive) to 200VDC 50W PSU, and I've hit a road block when it came to picking a suitable transformer. I haven't settled on a topology yet, but I was thinking push-pull/half bridge, or maybe even flyback? I'm flexible, but the only requirement is the output has to isolated, so it will need a transformer.

So, I did up a design for a push-pull topology based around [this Coilcraft transfomer, (8:1 150W 2P2S)](http://www.coilcraft.com/lm5041.cfm). The only catch is the voltage rating is only 75V, and no indication as to the V.uS product. Coilcraft are terrible at giving you information about there transformers. The application note to go along with this transformer has uses a V.uS of around 80@500kHz,50%Ds, which seems reasonable but it means it isn't going to cut the mustard for my application. On closer inspection I found a [planar transformer prototyping kit](http://www.coilcraft.com/planarkit.cfm) using a similar core which gave more information about the transformer, namely the effective area of the core and some vague indication it was using a ferrite core, such that you could calculate the number of primary turns required for a particular V.uS. And for switching 75V@500kHz 50%Ds, who would have guessed that you need 8 turns? I wish coilcraft were more thorough with their documentation.

So I went searching, and it turns out pretty much every planar transformer on the market shares this limitation, that voltage rating is dictated by the number of turns on the primary. The hexi-path configurable transformers wont work because the secondary side will not have the current carrying capability at the ratios I need. And I haven't been able to find any normal SMPS transformer that are suitable for this application (or that many at all actually).

Long story short, help!

* Are there any off the shelf transformers out there that are suitable for this type of application?
* If the answer is no, how feasible would it be to make a SMPS transformer? I've seen that there is a pretty wide selection of ferrite cores available for both wire wound and planar transforms, but designing and building a transformer is out of my current realm of experience, but I'm willing to learn!
* Am I barking up the wrong tree with my topology? Should I be doing a single isolation stage followed by a boost stage?

Much of the questions I ask delve deeper than the curriculum cares to cover so I'm often left without answers.

One of my biggest peeves is the concept of a device that has a ""high voltage but a low current"".  I've spent literally days of my life solving Ohms Law circuits and have come to understand that voltage and current are NOT independent of one another and are forever slaves to the circumstances of Ohms Law.  I often ask about the dangers of high voltage in an attempt to understand the boundaries of my trade, specifically what can and can't kill me.  Things like an electric fence are a prime example of what I'm curious about.  It fan be several thousand volts but a low enough current so it isn't fatal.  Why?  How?  Your body has a resistance and should produce a current when applied to the fence's voltage, especially if you put yourself in parallel (both arms?)

I also see it on the backs of transformers etc.  A voltage and then a current and sometimes power.  I don't get it.  Isn't that ALL decided as a result of Ohms Law?

A while ago, my notebook charging cable had a cable break that I wanted to fix. Without really having a plan, I cut out the part with the break, stripped off the outer insulation and was looking at the copper wires surrounding the inner part. I bent them to the side (they were parallel, not woven to a mesh) and fixed the inner part first, which was easy since it was basically a normal piece of stranded wire.

But after that, I didn't really know how to connect the surrounding wires without drowning them in solder. I tried splitting them into three groups and merging the wires of each group to solder them, but I still couldn't make a decent joint without keeping some of the wires unconnected or using huge amounts of solder.

I didn't take any pictures, but I made some drawings, hope you get what I mean.

So first I had the wires, slightly overlapping:

Then I merged them like this, at three sides of the cable (that was already really fiddly):

And this is the part that didn't work at all (soldering them together):

The wires just kept spreading apart, it was a huge mess and eventually I started melting the heat shrink tubing of the inner core.

In the end, I just put together all of the outer wires on one side and soldered them, so that I had two cables beside each other, instead of around each other. It works but it looks like someone did a shitty job. I would like to do it ""right"" next time.

If the AC supply switch is on, the heater is activated whenever the PIR senses movement, regardless of the room temperature.

That's... *suboptimal*, to put it politely. It's not good to live with.

So I'm engineering my own way to better control! I thought I can easily build [one of these thermistor-driven thermostat plans](http://www.craig.copperleife.com/tech/thermo/).

I can't change much about the PIR itself, because this is a standard University-managed student accommodation setup, and their attitude is ""put up and shut up"". Bypassing it altogether and connecting a relay to the mains behind it is strictly off-limits (and would see me disciplined), so:

**1.) I need an output device that will trigger the PIR sensor automatically when I command it to.**  
I'm thinking of a simple battery-powered circuit sat near the PIR, monitoring temperature and passing on either a 1 or 0 signal to the PIR. Some Googling led me to [this thread](http://www.candlepowerforums.com/vb/showthread.php?256472-IR-LED-PIR) where the OP wanted the same effect as me - to trigger a PIR remotely. It was suggested that high-power (0.5W) infrared LEDs might do it -  
**2.) Is this sufficiently bright - or perhaps overwhelmingly bright? What wavelength of IR LED will it work best with?**

Someone pointed out that PIRs don't get activated by a simple on/off change in infrared light seen - the light has to *move*, from one zone of the sensor to the next, to trigger it.  
**3.) Failing some mechanical setup to provide actual movement** (which would probably be noisy to sleep next to at night, unless you have bright ideas I've not considered yet /r/AskElectronics), **will two LEDs aimed at opposite sides of the sensor be interpreted as 'movement' by the PIR when they flash back and forth?**

I finally dragged an oscilloscope into work, and after a few days of plugging around and several upsets (What? I magically fixed it? But this one doesn't work) I think I have narrowed down the issue.

I had my scope grounded to the negative lead of the battery terminal (as that's where all ground traces/wires seem to go) and probing things from there. Vcc on the misbehaving Attiny looked fine -- there was a little bit more noise when the motor was running, but it wasn't moving around any. I'd put a decoupling cap on the chip and Vcc would look a whole hell of a lot better, but the IC would still screw up. I tried a number of different things, which eventually just turned into me probing whatever I could hoping something would jump out at me.

Something did.

I noticed that probing the ground pin on the IC didn't show a flat line -- on the contrary, it showed a ~3Mhz sine wave that was about 0.4V peak to peak! Wondering why the IC booted at all, I then compared (add mode) Vcc to ground, and got a fuzzy (so, noisy) but fairly flat line. Then I triggered the motor. My scope is ancient, and doesn't have such niceties as a single-shot mode, but watching the trace jump up off the screen told me everything I needed to know.

So, the Vcc line, relative to ground at-the-battery, was absolutely stellar. **But when the motor activates, it's putting a large upward spike on ground, causing a brownout in effect from the other side of the circuit!**

I think I can work out a solution from here. I lifted one leg of Q1 (was connected to the ground wire off the board) and gave it its own wire directly to the negative battery terminal. And that fixed it! This is far from ideal though, as to put it into production use would require me to fish a wire through a rubber hose.

The ATmega is in the form of an Arduino Micro, though I'm not using the Arduino software. The Micro has a built-in power source detection circuit, which will use either USB power or external power (It [appears](http://arduino.cc/en/uploads/Main/arduino-micro-schematic.pdf) to use a FDN340P, though I don't know enough about electronics to grok how that works. It is said that you can supply ~7V on Vin to provide 5V to the 5V pin.)

The LED power strip draws a bunch of current (96 20ma LEDs, so nearly 2A when full-on), so I can't power it from USB. I have an external, regulated, 5V/2A supply.

I've been prototyping with the USB ground tied to the external power supply ground. Nothing has blown up yet, but I'm not sure that this is a good idea. I'm vaguely aware of ""ground loops"" and how they can wreak havoc on analog circuits (like audio circuits), but I think I'm mostly safe in my digital world. Leaving the grounds disconnected from each other produces some interesting, random patterns on the display, but it's unfortunately not the effect I'm seeking.

At one point, I had also tied the regulated supply's 5V line into the Micro's 5V line, which was sorta also connected to USB 5V through that power selection circuit. I'm pretty sure this was a bad idea, though again, nothing seemed to blow up. The real problem was that it provided a path for USB to try to power the LED strip, which I definitely do not want.

So with that wall of text, my question is basically: is it safe for me to tie together the ground pins of my two power supplies?

I am working on a project at uni where I have fabricated a silicon chip using lithography(gonna refer to this as the die). The chip is 10mm square and has 12 pads along one edge. I need to connect the pads on the die (gold ~400µm squares) to external test equipment. The project is a bio-sensor so the chip itself will be in contact with a water based solution (IE not sealed as most chips are). 

Current plan is to directly attach the die to a PCB or similar, to which I can then attach a connector box to i can plug in external equipment. I will wire bond the pads on the die directly to the board, and insult (encapsulate) any parts i don't want to get wet/short.

I have a meeting with someone from the university who should be able to help out, but would like to get any input here before i make a fool of myself.

Questions are:
1)Is this feasible and the best solution to my problem?

2)With wire bonding, would I need to be extra careful regarding the PCB material tracks or would standard copper ones be ok?

3)Could i use something like this to save designing my own board - all I require are simple tracks from the chip to a connector block?

I've studied electronics in the past and even got good grades in my classes but op amps just aren't very intuitive to this day. Take for example this page:

http://www.electronics-tutorials.ws/opamp/opamp_2.html

The math they use makes total sense. But I still don't *see* how the op amp does these things. Is this just the internal circuitry acting as a black box?

So let me give you an example of how I see things. I'm going to use their diagram here for reference. Say V2 = 1 volt and the rails are at +/- 5 volts. So Vout would be at -5 volts. Next, since the op amp gets looped back into itself, the point X in their diagram ends up going to 0 volts. Wouldn't that then mean that V2 = 0 volts? So then you have V1 = V2 = 0 volts (ground) and shouldn't Vout then be 0 volts as well? Then if Vout = 0 volts... X is no longer at 0 volts and V2 is something else again... it's like this loop in my mind.

Or is this kind of like a differential equation where you can't get the solution step by step and you have to have it all work at the same time?

I have a ""Soladyne"" lantern (plastic lantern that charges via a small solar panel on top, or it has a crank that can charge the battery). We use is once per year or so when we go camping, it otherwise is in storage. As you might imagine, the battery is now failing after only a few years. I took it apart and found the battery pack to be a set of 3 AAA NiMH cells wired in series. The lantern is LED lights so is fairly low in it's power requirements. I have limited knowledge in electronics but know enough to be dangerous. I can replace the batteries easily enough, but ultimately would like to replace the battery pack with a capacitor in order to avoid the battery pack failing again in a few years. I have a few questions:


1: Is this even a reasonable/good idea? If we can get ~20 minutes of light out of the lantern with a reasonable number of cranks (or by leaving it in the sun all day) we will be happy, we don't need it to last hours. As it is, we need to crank it every 20-30 minutes as the lights get dimmer and dimmer.

2: I have a 200V 220uF capacitor that is physically about the size of the battery pack and will fit right in the current location of the battery pack. How long could one expect that to power the lantern? It has 12 LEDs.

3: If that one won't work, I found a 1farad ""supercap"" that claims 2.5V for a few dollars, can they be wired in series like batteries? Can I wire 2 of those together to use in place of the battery pack? If so, how long could that be expected to power 12 LEDs?

4: If neither of those would work for my purpose, is there any other alternative I could use that could stand up to the kind of use this gets (once or twice per year, crank 50-100 times and use, or leave in sun all day, and use. Do this for 3 or 4 days, then back in storage until next time) and not fail as often as I can expect NiMH batteries to?

Much thanks!

EDIT: for formatting

EDIT 2: Thanks for the replies everyone. It looks like this idea is not going to work out like I wanted it to. I was hoping that a higher capacity cap would be able to store enough energy to run the LEDs for a reasonable period of time, and it looks like that is not the case. I will look into the low self discharge cells that bradn recommended. If I can get 20 years out of a set like bradn claims, I will be happy with that.

My understanding of rechargeable batteries is that they don't particularly like to be charged only part way and drained off to near flat which is why I feel that the solar panel/crank method is harmful to the cells. I know that to some extent that is a hangover from the days of NiCD batteries that had problems with memory and whatnot, but can it really be not damaging to the cells for them to never see a full charge? To always see low levels of charge (somehow I doubt 8 hours in intermittent sunlight, or several minutes of cranking will charge them fully)? Assuming I am incorrect on my assumptions, I will go with a new set of eneloops and see how that goes.",repair,False,self,t5_2se13,1347631923.0,repair,,True,t3_zuutc,http://www.reddit.com/r/AskElectronics/comments/zuutc/want_to_replace_battery_with_capacitor_in/,

I'm a mechatronics controls engineer doing controls for engines so I'm very familiar with the PID theory I just have no clue how these ""work"". I'm used to designing my controller from scratch in Simulink and flashing it to our ECM so I have quite a few questions about these.

From what I've heard about these and found online is that they lack documentation and if you can find it it is in pretty bad engrish.

- Outputs: I've seen Relay &amp; Solid State Relay, what's the difference? Does the SSR need a different type of driving signal? This one lists ""Voltage Pulse Output"", is this a PWM signal?

- Controller. P is straight forward. I and D with units of ""seconds"" I'm not used to. (For example I'm used to D being in units of [Output]/[dInput/dt]). Even just knowing how it's arranged would help Out=(P+I/s+D*s)*Err or I've also seen it terms of loop gain.

- ""Heat -reset proportional control"" No clue what this is.

I'd like a bit more control than that. I have an Arudino but by time I get it programmed, setup, all the hardware needed one of these controllers is about just as expensive and in a much nicer package.

To begin, I got a [Micros ASM eclipse touch screen](http://www.ebay.com/itm/MICROS-ASM-ECLIPSE-DISPLAY-ACTIVE-pn-400497-002-PARTS-ONLY-/130677223095?pt=LH_DefaultDomain_0&amp;hash=item1e6cf82eb7) off ebay (P/N: 400497-002) and I am currently working on making it work again. The issue with these screens is that all communication/power is done over a single DVI-D plug made just to be used on the cash register only. Right now I am working on tracing and decoding the signals so I can create a breakout cable (and diagram for everyone else) to allow these cheap touchscreens to be used for other things. I have pulled apart the adapter cable and have determined that yes, it appears as if the screen is truly using DVI, but I need help figuring out which DVI wires are important, and which ones Micros would be using for their other stuff, so I can avoid plugging these into a computer.

So, my question is, what wires on a single link DVI connection are actually required to run a video signal, and which ones can I ignore or investigate further as possibly being used my Micros for RS-232 and power? I am guessing that the DDS power/clock wires would be required for resolution identification, but what about the 5V standby wire, or others? (12 wires for R/G/B/Clock+returns+shields have already been put aside as being DVI)
 
As a side note, if anyone has worked with these screens, or even knows the voltage they run on, please let me know. Except for the shield ground, and the DVI RGB and clock wires, the rest of the wires are probably 28 gauge and I have a hard time believing this entire screen would run power off any of them. The voltage of the cash registers computer is 24V input, but I believe the screen is made for 12v. Also, RS-232 should be easy to trace for me, I already found the MAX232 on the PCB for the touch driver and will be doing continuity tests on that.",,False,self,t5_2se13,False,,,True,t3_s55qv,http://www.reddit.com/r/AskElectronics/comments/s55qv/design_minimal_dvi_cable_help_determining_the/,

I mostly work from DC to audio frequencies, some work in the few hundreds of kilohertz, but I'm also interested in hearing about this going into microwave range.

The only things I can think of are power considerations (smaller resistors = larger currents), DC voltage offset on the op-amp, and input/output impedance (although I'm not sure of the significance—only max power transfer theorem and loading?).

Also, as an extension, what about filters? Say, a simple first-order RC high- or low-pass filter, or a Sallen-Key filter, where you similarly have ratios between capacitances and/or resistances.

I am currently making electronic match igniters for model rockets, and they work by passing electricity through a short segment of very thin copper wire.  The copper wire is touching a match head, and when the copper wire heats up because it's so thin it ignites the match head which then ignites the rocket engine.  **Here's the issue:** I have made many igniters and successfully ignited them using a standard 6 volt lantern battery I got at Radioshack (also Radioshack brand).  I'm not sure of the amperage or any other qualities of this battery.  Though I haven't tested igniting an engine yet, that's a separate issue and I'm sure it will work.  However, I would like more power so the igniter can ignite faster so today I found and old AC phone plug for an old wired house phone type device.  I stripped the 2 wires coming from the plug and tried igniting the igniter in that way.  It was unsuccessful (not enough power to make the thin copper wire even heat up).  After a few trials I came to the conclusion that it's not going to ever heat the copper wire and ignite the match head.  The plug on the cord has a label that reads the output at 9 volts and 210 mA.  So what am I doing wrong?  I assumed that because it was 3 volts higher than the lantern battery that it would ignite faster, which is my goal, but obviously it isn't the voltage.  If possible, what type of battery would fit my needs well? 

EDIT: here is a Youtube video showing a step-by-step video on how the igniter is made for easier understanding (and shown igniting at the end) [HERE](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYnNmPn8XNo&amp;list=FLZeakCcNpfwL64casQOzRLQ&amp;index=1&amp;feature=plpp_video)

I as looking at some [MUN5335DW1](http://www.onsemi.com/pub_link/Collateral/DTC123JP-D.PDF) dual complementary pre-biased transistor arrays.  These have an NPN and a PNP bipolar in a small package, each with a 2.2K base resistor (so I can drive it straight from a digital logic pin with reasonable base current) and a 47K base-emitter resistor (to hold it off when undriven).

I was thinking two of these per coil, with the NPN bases driven by logic, and the PNP bases connected to the NPN collectors.  So I can use a different (higher) voltage supply to drive the relays.

*However*, I'm trying to figure out how to protect the result against inductive kick.  Once I start turning off the NPN, the collector voltage will rise sharply, which will slam off the PNP, and then zener its base-emitter junction.

One way to protect it would be to use 4 diodes to connect both sides of the coil to both rails.  But that's 2 more packages if using cheap dual diodes, which is expensive in board area.

I could also just use a single bidirectional zener (e.g. [ON ESD9B5.0ST5G](http://www.onsemi.cn/pub_link/Collateral/ESD9B-D.PDF)) to limit the coil voltage, but that bumps into to the PNP reverse Vbe maximum.  I'd need to change to a slightly higher rent base drive.

**1.** From a beginners perspective, is this *far* too advanced to be starting on? Is it just better to seek out a professional for the prototype stage and if so, what 'title' would I be looking for? Hardware designer? The end goal is to prototype a (hopefully) marketable product, so it's something of a business venture and I'm prepared to fund the stages of its development if it helps. At the end of the day, I'm more of a designer than a developer, I'd rather it done properly even if it costs something.

**2.** If it's not too difficult and something that could be learned over a few months (minus full time work), what sort of subjects, books, pdfs, wikis or other resources would I need to be looking at to get started? I'm a web designer so this isn't really my field... but if there's a specific area of electronics that covers this sort of project, it'd really help to find out.

And of course if there's a more appropriate subreddit for this sort of question, my bad, I'll redirect it quietly!",design,False,self,t5_2se13,False,design,,True,t3_1j8xws,http://www.reddit.com/r/AskElectronics/comments/1j8xws/advice_needed_on_undertaking_a_unique_electronic/,

I am back again with more problems.  

I have an H-Bridge circuit that I have made on a breadboard, and moved successfully to PCB for a few revisions.  Previously the system was running at 6V, but now the need for 12V has arisen.  So keep in mind that this system worked for 6V.

Here is a schematic of the portion I am trying to fix. http://i.imgur.com/Kjcnk9Q.png?1?4544

The P MOSFETs I am using are FQP27P06 which I purchased from sparkfun https://www.sparkfun.com/products/10349
Datasheet here: https://www.sparkfun.com/datasheets/Components/General/FQP27P06.pdf

The N MOSFETs I am using are FQP30N06L which I purchased from sparkfun https://www.sparkfun.com/products/10213
Datasheet: http://dlnmh9ip6v2uc.cloudfront.net/datasheets/Components/General/FQP30N06L.pdf


The problem I see when running the system on 12V, is that the current spikes extremely high, even with no motor load attached and no input from the arduino.   I have tried adding 1k pull down resistors on the gates of the MOSFETs, but that does not help, the current still goes up to 6 amps or more.  

I do need the system to be able to drive a motor at 12V and up to 5A (that is my stall current on the motor), and not get extremely hot. 

I feel that there is just some little thing or concept that I am missing to get this to work.

a few months ago my motherboard died and I got a new one for a good price from my friend.

The board is an msi MS-7623 ver 2.3

Still I really want to know what killed it so I'm going to describe what I've done and what happened here as much as I can.

On a warm summerday... Na, I'm just kidding.

I found my stock CPU cooler one day lieing around somewhere and thought: Why not try putting that on your board and find out where to put it best in terms of cooling.

So I plugged it in (to a 3-pin connector) and was booting up my PC but I just realized that I don't know the usual temperatures and the cooler was still plugged in (which would mislead my messures). So because I've read about people unplugging their fan while the system is running without any troubles I thought I'd do the same, so I did.

Then after about 2 or 3 more seconds my PC suddenly turned off, like if you pulled out the power supply's cord (I was grounded and there was no electrostatic discharge or some of that kind going on...)

My heart froze for a second and I knew right away that this was not going to end up well. I unplugged my PSU and everything and suddenly thought... where does this stench come from?!

Things got serious on this when I realized the stench came from the CPU. I put my PC down and started to unplug my CPU to find... nothing. I thought the CPU was fried or something of that kind but no visual damage.

I was a little confused at that time but plugged in nothing but my CPU and the power supply. It started spinning and I suddenly heard a rather loud bang. I was shocked and instantly unplugged my PSU... Right after that I thought because the pieces are dead already I'll give it another try, this time there was no bang but a little sizzling noise going on around where my CPU was sitting. I decided to keep it turned on for another 10 seconds and if there was no beep I'd turn it off again and indeed there was no beep, so I turned it off. I smelled the stench again and thought I'd have to figure out where it comes from exactly.

Turned the system on again for around 10 seconds, turned it off and instantly plugged my CPU out and sniffed on both the CPU and the socket. The CPU was fine but it was definitely coming from my board.

After this I got a new motherboard from a friend for a good price and my CPU was indeed undamaged, it turned up just perfect, it's running for about 2 months now, even overclocked it and it's all fine.

Now there is still one thing I'm wondering about: What killed the motherboard and what happened exactly?!

I already posted this on http://www.reddit.com/r/techsupport/comments/1hspio/what_should_i_do_with_my_dead_motherboard/ with another intent but thought I'll give it another try here.

The board is still intact by the way if you want me to do any further tests with it.

I also want to mention that my old, and really crappy (I got a new one, don't worry!) PSU was still spinning up but I have nothing I could messure the Volt with so I'm not 100% sure if everything's alright with it.

I'd really appreciate any answer on this and further ideas. Thanks already, Folas

So what I'm trying to do, basically, is build a USB DAC which can do up to 24/192 audio, as well as DSD. I know I said just above I don't believe in audiophile kind of nonsense, so it might come as a surprise that I'm even using DSD or 24/192. Well, the point of this is to find out once and for all whether I or anyone I know *can* actually hear the difference. So with that out of the way let's begin.

To get the audio from the computer to the DAC, I'll be using the XMOS USB Audio Reference design. According to the site, it uses asynchronous USB, so this should isolate it from the jitter inherent to USB. Now, for DSD, this presents an interesting problem. Luckily, there is a relatively easy solution. There is some firmware which supports something called DoP, which essentially transports DSD data over PCM frames. The XMOS chip will the convert it in to true DSD and spit it out, to be sent to the DAC. 

Now, here is where I'm confused. Once the XMOS chip spits out the I2S and/or DSD signal, what, if anything, do I need to do to make sure that it is jitter free before reaching the DAC? I know a fair amount of designs use an asynchronous sample rate converter (ASRC) to upsample to the highest sampling rate (24/192 in this case probably). How do I know whether this will attenuate the jitter? Supposedly, the AD1963 is much better than the SRC4192, but I can't figure out why merely from the datasheets. As for DSD, well, I obviously can't use an ASRC with it. TI has some products they call ""jitter cleaning clocks"" which are two-pass PLLs. Would those work? If so, how do I know which one to choose? If not, why wouldn't they work and what would?

So here's the short and sweet version of the story: My sister/brother in law somehow acquired an old pinball machine.

They decided to give it to my BIL's younger sibling, to ""do whatever you want with it"". Said younger sibling is kind of an idiot, so he decides smashing it is a good idea. Luckily, he's an idiot, so he doesn't do a very good job of smashing the machine. It then got left in the rain (3-5 days light rain) until I spotted it and asked if I could have it. As far as I can tell, the insides stayed dry(ish). 

So now I have this awesome pinball machine and I would very much like to get it up and running again, but have no idea where to start! (Other than a good cleaning, of course) When I plug it in, nothing happens, regardless of the on/off switch's position.

This is an old apartment and I just moved here recently. The room we chose for the 'office' in fact does not have any three-pronged outlets. The adjacent room does, and what we've been doing is running a heavy-duty extension cord down the hallway to power up our desktop computer. I checked today with an outlet checker, that three-prong outlet is in fact grounded.

We have a three-to-two-prong outlet converter as featured [here](http://www.amazon.com/Prong-prong-grounding-converter/dp/B000I96AUM/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1368821996&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=three+to+two+prong+converter). I read that sometimes old two-prong outlets are actually grounded, so I attached the adapter to the screw and tested it - no dice. Open ground light. 

So here I am with a desktop in a room with no readily accessible three-pronged outlets and I would like electrician advice on how to proceed. Options I am considering:

* Plug in the adapter to the two-prong outlet, plug in a surge protector to that adapter, then plug in the desktop items to the surge protector
* Keep the current arrangement with a long extension cord connected to the other room powering a surge protector in the office.
* Look into installing a GFCI in the office. However, this isn't really an option because making alterations to the apartment would break my lease.
* Ask the landlord if it would be feasible to install three-pronged outlets in the office (and for that matter, the living room).

The sticker on the garage door opener says it operates at a frequency of 360 (Hz I guess?) It's the same problem with both my vehicle's built-in remote opener and an external one. Weak batteries aren't the problem.

I tried changing the remote code (changing dip switch settings in both the remote and door opening unit) and it still required me to be in close proximity.

There's no visual damage to the antenna hanging from the unit, and it's attached securely. (Verified when I opened to change the dip switches.)

I tried calling the Vivint and the rep and supervisor both said they never heard of this problem before and I would have to basically prove it. There haven't been any other electronics or lights installed here, and searching the problem with my remotes suddenly not working led me to the security system possibly being the problem in the first place.

So how can I prove the security system could be the problem, or do you have any other suggestions?

In my highly scientific experiments so far, I can reliably make the light come on whilst prodding it with a conductive piece of material (doesn't seem to matter if it's insulated from me or not), but not trigger a button press.

There is a system which gives certain voltage output which is the error in a system. It is a sinusoidal wave the peak to peak value of which is my error voltage. I have to take that error voltage and then give a voltage signal to an electronically controlled attenuator which then attenuates my system and changes the error voltage. Obviously I have to minimize the attenuator voltage. But here are the problematic parts:

1. There is a error null point of voltage which when given to the attenuator will nullify the error, that null point is not known. The circuit has to find out that null point and keep the attenuator voltage there.

1. The error null point may change change while the operation of the system due to different things. That may create some problem too.

Can someone help me design an electronic systems (maybe using op-amps?) to solve this problem?

A question about RF oscillators. Specifically, I'm teaching myself about radio receivers and my current application is the LO in a broadcast-band AM superhet receiver.

How important is it to control harmonic (or other) distortion in such an oscillator? Should you not worry about it at the oscillator, and just filter out the harmonics on the output? Or should you take steps to control it from the beginning, and make sure the oscillator's active device always stays in its linear range? (I hope that sequence of words is what I meant to say...) Or maybe you don't even need to filter the harmonics out, since any higher frequency products should be filtered out by your IF filter.

It apparently works with loads up to 100g.

So I'm trying to figure out how accurate I can safely get with this thing.

The sheet mentions a sensitivity of 0.7mV/V of input (I think?).

So completely going from speculation here, I connect my 'excitation' voltage across the EXC pins. Lets say I'm using 12 V (I think it mentions it's safe up to 100 V DC?). Then I connect an analog-in and ground on my Arduino to the SIG pins.

My calculation is I have 1000/0.7 = ~1429 different values for each volt of input. So if I put in the aforementioned 12v, I now have 12*1429 = 17148 different possible values.

So to get my resolution in grams, I divide 100g by that to get 100g/17148 = 0.00583g or 5.83 milligrams.

Is that correct? If so, can an Arduino Uno (ATMega 328P) even measure that accurately with its ADC?

Any insight or suggestions would be greatly appreciated.

",14,4,17,http://www.reddit.com/r/AskElectronics/comments/11w39b/gremlins_in_my_project_arduino_doesnt_work_the/,"Hey, so I started this project a little while ago and everything was going great. Basically It's an arduino that turns an appliance on for 15 minuets and then sounds a buzzer when its done. It has a button to reset the timer and a switch to cut power to the arduino to turn it off completely. [here my schematic](http://i.imgur.com/wUrS1.png?1).

 I had the code uploaded and was testing it while it was plugged into the computer and everything was great. I decided to test it with a 9V regulated wall wart and for whatever reason the buzzer stopped working. It actually started making fizzing noises. My fist thought was I messed up when I soldered the barrel jack connector on so I ran the power straight to the Vin pin. No luck. I tried using a 9v battery, but the same thing happened. Finally I decided it might be the pin I was using to turn the buzzer on (Tx1) or I made a bad connection somewhere. I reprogrammed the code first to turn pin 2 high and was about to go re solder it when my friend came over to ask about it. I was in the middle of explaining to him what I thought the problem was when I inadvertently touched pin 2 and pin 1 with my finger. I'm using header pins soldered into the board so I was making a connection between the two pins. All of a sudden, the buzzer started working! I was amazed and decided I must have done something to damage pin 1 and proceeded to re solder the connection to pin 2. I finished soldering, came back and tested it again but the same problem started happening.  

 I'm really not sure what to do next. I might try running a resistor to ground before the transistor but I was doing that originally and couldn't get the transistor to switch. It seems so strange that it works perfectly fine when it's plugged into the computer but not when it's plugged into the wall. 

Does anyone have a clue what's going on? I'm using an Arduino Leonardo if that makes a difference. 


Update_1: So I wont be able to test until tomorrow, but first thing I'm going to do is double check the power supply to make sure it's regulated. For anyone interested [this is the one I'm using] (https://www.adafruit.com/products/63)

I was testing it some more and I noticed the relay had some trouble reliably switching on. I think this could be a transistor problem ([I'm using this one](http://www.onsemi.com/pub_link/Collateral/2N6426-D.PDF)) but that still doesn't explain why it works fine with USB. I think the only thing that really explains that would be a decoupling problem or a problem with the power supply ( even though I tested it with a 9v battery too). I don't know much about decoupling.

Final Update: I got it to work by removing R6 and using the external power supply to power the relay from the Vin pin. ",,False,self,t5_2se13,1352080955.0,,,True,t3_11w39b,http://www.reddit.com/r/AskElectronics/comments/11w39b/gremlins_in_my_project_arduino_doesnt_work_the/,

I am making Atmega8-based multiple-interval thermostat and I have a problem: it is prone to 220V ripple created by load. When it decides to turn on load with relay nasty jitter occurs, making chip either turn off (I have enabled brown-out protection) or code (delay()) runs faster then it should.

Here are [shematics, photos and oscilloscope screenshots](http://imgur.com/a/pVQuJ).

For explanation, [first](http://i.imgur.com/nCWQg.png) screenshot shows blue - 5v for the chip, yellow - 19v-16v at rectifier. 5v circuitry gets up to 6v down to, sometimes, 3v or even less..

Now [second](http://i.imgur.com/5Uno4.png) capture shows again blue for the 5v and yellow - 220v at output after relay, just before my test-load (small halogen table lamp). Jitter goes for about 0.3-0.9ms.

I tried various scenarios and it's now quite clear that load does something I do not yet understand. I can turn lamp manually just after relay closed and result is the same. I can get the same effect by plugging lamp into sibling wall socket!

I am only high school educated, know the basics of electronics, ac/dc, earth, neutral, live and a basic knowledge of how magnetic fields are used to convert mechanical energy to electrical.

I chose something simple, a basic earphone for an mp3 player that was beyond repair and took it apart to see if I could figure out how it converts data on the mp3 player to audible sound.

The first part was obviously the wire, it has two small wires inside which are molded to a rounded piece of metal, with an outer ring covered in some black plastic coating, covering up the holes, I have no idea what the purpose of the holes are.

My first guess for the two wires is flow and return current/ input-output.

The next piece is a magnet, my guess as to the purpose of the magnet is that the mp3 player pulses electricity through the wires directly affecting the state of the magnetic field?

The next piece is a thin film of plastic attached to a copper wire wound into a coil, this is where I am stuck a little, my guess is the magnetic field affects the copper coil in some way to produce sound vibrations, although I am not sure how.

The next piece is another small metal dish with holes in it, 12 to be exact and evenly spaced in a pattern, not sure if the pattern itself is relevant but my guess is this has something to do with even distribution of sound.

The final part is a thin flexible gauze, probably to keep dirt from clogging up the inside of the buds and causing degradation of sound quality, it might serve a purpose beyond that but I am lost as to what else it could be.

How much of that did I get right, am I a complete idiot?, I dread to think what would be the result of me trying to figure out the inside of a TV or a microwave, I feel like an idiot because if I tried to learn about the inner workings of half the devices I own I would struggle to understand from observation.

I've gone through the datasheet and app notes, and done all the sums for the ratings I need for all the components. There's only one thing I'm unsure of -- the inductor values, specifically what I'll need for the peak/continuous ratings.

Relevant info:

* running from a 48V supply
* strings are 3V (many LEDs in parallel)
* current needed to drive them will be about 6 to 7A

As you can see, at 3V, it's very high current, but since I'm switching a 48V input, it should be a lot less. According to the formulas from the datasheet, the FET only needs to be rated at about 1.1A (and that's with a 3x safety margin), however the ""inductor peak current"" needs to be 6.9A. That's where my problem lies.

I understand that the peak current for the inductor is only that -- *peak* current. However, what sort of inductor should I choose?

When I've looked for inductors I see that datasheets don't seem to specift a 'peak' current, they just give values that seem to be average currents. If I pick one based on that, do I just make sure it's above my average current (eg. with a 3x safety margin like the FET)?

I've found some pretty good, cheap ones from Futurlec that are 100uH, 2.1A continuous (I only need about 15uH, but 6.8A peak). Would they work?

**TL;DR: My switching LED driver circuit draws 300mA average, 7A peak. Can I use an inductor that is rated 2.1A continuous; will it handle the peak current?**

**EDIT: my apologies, I was getting things back to front; I was somehow managing to get the fact that it will draw 300mA from the 48V supply (average) confused with the fact that it will be providing 6-7 A continuously to the LEDs.**

So clearly the inductor needs to be *at least* 6-7A, if not a bit more for a safety margin. So now the only question is, where can I find a source of cheap inductors? Digikey and Mouser are expensive (~$2-3 each), whereas futurlec.com has power inductors for 45c (but only down to 100uH/2.1A).

What's the best way to bring down a larger voltage (typically 5V, 12V in my cases) with minimal impact to the system I'm measuring? I'm calculating power usage by the voltage drop across a small &lt;.1 Ohm resistor in series with the supply lines of various systems (ARM development boards, eventually ATX Power supplies in a desktop computer). I need to measure the voltages on either side of the resistor to do this.  

The problem is that most of these systems have supply voltages higher than the 3V ADC of the development board I'm using to log data. I'd like the project to be as self-contained as possible and run off the 3V, 5V supplies of my development board or the supply line of what I'm measuring (though this will influence the power usage slightly).  

Most of my electronics experience is with op-amps due to my brain suppressing most knowledge about BJTs and MOSFETs.  

I've thought about using a simple voltage divider with resistors but I fear that will draw too much current. I've thought of a few things with op-amps but the problem is I can only use single-supply op-amps. The best I've come up with is to make a buffer with an op-amp and the supply of what I'm measuring, and then a simple voltage divider.

I had an simple idea to take an audio output and reduce the voltage on one side in order to create a 'balanced' sound for her. I initially wanted to build a really small passive circuit (with SMD components) so that the package could be small and just added to the end of a headphone jack.

I initially did a test and found out what ratios she needed to hear a balanced sound. Using winamp, I deduced that the left had to be 70% louder than the right. Just to be safe, I output a sine wave playing in winamp from my computer to my sillyscope and found that the ratio in amplitudes was actually 65%.

I threw together a quick voltage divider on a breadboard as follows (excuse the paint drawing): http://i.imgur.com/NnvrfrG.png

Using the same sine wave but putting winamp back to center balance, I checked the ratio of amplitudes through the voltage divider and it was roughly the same as what I saw through the ""70% left"" in winamp. The actual measurements were 620mV Vpp on the right side and 1.8V Vpp on the left side.

The problem happens when I plug in the actual headphones... the load makes the right channel jump down to about 100mV. I should probably mention that my headphones have a 300 ohm impedance. This happens with other headphones too, but I haven't checked by how much the amplitude drops.

I realize that the resistors are probably eating up the current the headphones need to be driven with so my question is: is there any way to do this with passive components or would I have to make some sort of amplifier (i'm trying to avoid powered circuits...) for this to function correctly?

Thanks!

I'll probably end up using a potentiometer for one of the voltage divider resistors so that you can adjust the volume attenuation for specific needs/headphone impedances.

1.  Will one pair of wires, say orange and white-orange be enough to carry this current?

2.  Which pair (or pairs) of wires should I use?  They all have different twists, and I'm not sure how much this affects a DC current.

3.  I'd like to solder all the CAT5 wires that come through the gangbox in the wall to a custom molex connector, that will plug into the power supply of the computer.

° Transformer Pin #1 connected to +12V input, as well to Pin #3 through a 1K resistor.

° Transformer Pin #2 connected to the ""negative"" side of 300V film capacitor.

° Transformer Pin #4 connected to 2SD882 Collector.

° Transformer Pin #5 connected to 2SD882 Base.

° 2SD882 Emitter connected to -12V input, as well as to ""positive"" side of 300V film capacitor.

Am I doing anything wrong? I can't seem to get more than a 1-2 volt output. ANY help or ideas would be highly appreciated!

Edit: To clarify what I'm asking, and why... Here's what I plan on doing. I currently have been playing with Arduino and relays, and I'd like to hook them up to 120v instead of 5v. (they are rated for 240 max, it's an 8 way relay). 

This arduino will be connected to my wired network (ethernet), and control multiple different lights and that will be strung in my new apartment (under the kitchen cabinets, around the floors, etc). These lights have a hot lead, and a return lead - no grounding. In addition, I am looking to control a walking signal as well.

I'm slightly afraid of the 120v, I've heard stories of it. The last thing I'd want is to be shocked by holding a wire the wrong way (which, I'm assuming I can hold it by the plastic coating? I have some weird fears about holding a wire at all while the system is on, so I probably won't run in to this. I'm more concerned about how the stuff could potentially flow)

So I'm trying to convert an SNES controller to be wireless. I've got the SNES Controller side finished - its an ATMega328 + nRF24L01; I'm using the SNESPad library to get input from the controller - I put the state into an int and send it off to the receiver - another ATMega328 and nRF24L01; from there I can bitshift to get the state of each button.

That all works perfectly. What I'm struggling with his how to take the current state and output that back to the SNES. I've looked at the NES/SNES serial protocol, and understand what I need to be doing there, but the only part I can't figure out is how to wire the sucker. The SNES has its 5v vcc line and its ground. I would imagine I would tie its ground to the ATMega's (it's powered by its own source), and not take the 5v. At that point, I should be able to read high/low off of the Clck, latch, and data lines coming from the snes? Or is that not the case?

Is there anyway I can start to develop an intuition for these kinds of circuits? Should I take power electronics, or should I just teach myself the fundamentals.

In simple terms:
1. Look at 4Ah and get it's value (say 40h on the first cycle)

  * BGA is a no go, otherwise 0.6mm pitch and above is preferred (hand assembly)

I've found a lot of almost-solutions, but nothing quite fits the bill.

The worst-case forward voltage drop at the right brightness is about 3v2 and the rest of the application runs off a 3v3 low-noise boost regulator - my secret hope is that there's something with FETs on the high and low side that will be able to drive the LED with near the full input voltage if it has to - I would love to avoid having a boost regulator (and all that noise) just for the LED.

Failing that, there doesn't seem to be a nice integrated boost/current-source IC with independent channel dimming.  There's more options if I boost off the already-boosted 3v3, but that seems like a hack.

Not sure if this helps, but there were other cases when the resistors had cold joints on one side or were missing entirely.

The beast has been silenced, and is now suitable for use in a home theatre PC. Thanks for all your help, guys!

One day while I was working on a laptop, I tried replacing a wifi card, but forgot to take out the battery. 

Some part of the card touched my screwdriver, my screwdriver was touching a grounded part of the chassis. Some of the smoke leaked out.

Ever since then, the laptop has made a terrible squealing noise and refuses to charge a battery. (oddly, it runs off battery, or, it runs off AC, *BUT* if you plug in the AC while the battery is in, it shorts out the adapter and refuses to do anything.)

So anyhow, I've located the source of the noise. It's a 1cm^2 choke marked 0R8, which I assume means 0.8&amp;micro;H.

Now, I really haven't the foggiest idea how inductors work. Would replacing this coil fix this problem, or is something else causing the coil to oscillate at a weird rate, causing the noise?

If I do replace it, does it need to be the same exact impedance or can I just throw any old inductor in there? What would happen if I simply removed it?

PS: I'm not even trying to repair the battery charging circuitry. I'm okay with how it currently works, I'm just trying to make it stop screeching.

Unfortunately it appears one of them is shared with the RESET pin for the microcontroller.

I don't really need the RESET pin, but unfortunately disabling it means I can no longer reprogram the device using the Arduino as an ISP. The only way to do it is to use a high voltage serial programmer, where 12v on the RESET pin forces the micro-controller into programming mode.

I've looked online and people have pretty complicated solutions for building a high voltage serial programmer... but theirs also have a ridiculous amount of extra functionality and protection.

So my question is, would tying the RESET pin to a 12 volt source (such as that produced by a PSU) be good enough to force it into programming mode, and then simply connect the remaining pins as normal to my programmer? If the programmer has to be the one to put the chip into programming mode, I could just use a BJT I have lying around to source 12v into the RESET pin.

Completely removing the chip from the circuit it resides in for reprogramming is not a problem for me.

I am a student currently taking a 2 year Electronic Technology degree.  My instructor has asked me to help him with a project that he would like to get up and running for the open house the program is having next month.  His project is to have a robotic arm hold a shot glass, and move the arm underneath a rotary shot dispenser, that dispenses one shot when the arm presses up on the dispenser.  What my instructor has asked me to do is to somehow attach a  motor of some sort to the rotary shot dispenser, that has multiple positions to rotate to so the arm can dispense a variety of shots at choice. The top part of the shot dispenser rotates 360 degrees, with the base and shaft stationary. There is some sort of ball bearings that sit on top of the shaft that allows the top to move.  My instructor has given me carte blanche to do what I want with it, and modify it as I need to. As shown in one of the pictures, the metal arms that hold the bottles of alcohol are only held on by two screws attached to the ball bearings, which seems like it will give easy access to somehow attach a motor.

The problem is I don’t know very much about motors, and the difference between them, such as stepper motors, servo motors, ect, and which should be used for certain purposes. I have asked him briefly about the power and controls, and he said that they will be controlled by a PLC and not to worry about that part of it.  He said just figure out how to attach a motor to it that meets the criteria with the multiple positions, and others will take care of the rest. He also said any parts and materials will be supplied; I just need to give him a parts list order.  I have attached some pictures of it as well as a Youtube video that shows the same model and how it operates. 

So, first question is what kind of motor should I use and why? And also, where and how would you suggest attaching the motor to the dispenser? Any suggestions or tips will be very much appreciated as I feel lost as to where to even start.  Thanks in advance, and let me know if there are any other questions.

The reason why I am doing this is straightforward. I am a programmer and I don't like pressing e.g. the combination Shift+9 to write ""("". I'd like to have the ""("" key directly on the keyboard along with other 13 keys.

Because 3D printing is still pretty expensive I've decided to combine two keyboards to physically get those 14 extra keys and 3D-print only the main shell of new keyboard.

The problem is that I have no clue what electronic board should I use to make it working. Maybe the originally embedded keyboard electronic board+circuits could to the trick. Or should I use custom board e.g. like Arduino?

I want to hook up a simple two buttons, and a micro switch to a plug-and-play ready Keyboard USB board. (Trying to make a small pinball cabinet to fit a Nexus 7 into, and run via a sixaxis controller calibrator) 

My main questions are.

1. Will this work?

2. If so, where can I buy a cheap USB circuit board?

3. Is there a more simple solution to what I'm trying to do?

Bonus extra credit question.

The only reason I'm using a micro switch is for the pinball plunger. Where I was just gonna calibrate the switch to be closed, and a direction. That direction, when 'pushed', would slowly move the in game plunger, and releasing my plunger would simply shoot the one in game at it's position. 

Can anyone think of a way to wire it up to be an analog signal, that could be compatible with android devices, so I can make an actual analog plunger as opposed to what I have here?",design,False,self,t5_2se13,False,design,,True,t3_183j6e,http://www.reddit.com/r/AskElectronics/comments/183j6e/question_from_a_newbie/,

Also, this counts as a project for my school so it's definately not going to waste. Another Electronics student reporting in :)

So, in short - What do I need to know about splitting an audio signal (stereo) into two outputs? The idea itself seems simple enough, just wire the input into two outputs and do it properly to preserve the quality of the signal. How about adding a switch to change the outputs/disabling/enabling them both, adding some volume-tweaking into it? 3.5mm plugs, all in a single piece of PCB. My school has nearly everything an electronics student could ask for, including automatic drills and a warehouse full of different components, so I should be fine.

Im going to need all the schematics, simulation files, circuit designs etc. Basically, everything that Multisim and Ultiboard softwares give !
But, that's my job to work with those, Im here just to ask if there's anything I should know about splitting an audio signal.

Also, if you read the whole post and provide constructive input to me, I'd greatly appreciate it.


I'm in the process of designing a set of microcontroller with wireless interface nodes for a home automation/integration system but as with all electronics, there is power needed. Both the micro and wireless module can happily be powered off 2-3.3V(or at least that's what the datasheets say)


Each node will be used to both collect power consumption data as well as interface (with triacs or relays) with a 220V piece of equipment (light/plug point/geyser etc)


Because the idea is to populate an entire house with these, and because they will be right next to a mains supply, batteries are a silly choice. Transformers are bulky and relatively expensive leaving the solution as little transformerless power supplies.


As I understand, there are essentially 3 stages to this conversion to get from an AC supply to a 3V DC supply(Please help if I'm waaay off) and I think that they're in this order:


220V AC -&gt;|Rectify|-&gt;|Filter|-&gt;|Regulate| = 3V DC


To rectify, I can go either full wave (diode bridge) or half wave (single series diode) And this is about as far as I am sure of.


To filter, I need some kind or RC network (I need help with this)


To regulate I think I can use either a zener diode or a linear voltage regulator.


I've been looking at these and am not quite sure how I should proceed cos I don't fully understand what each stage is doing:

http://electroschematics.com/3752/transformer-less-power-supply/
with this one, I don't understand what the R1/C1 network is doind and why R2 is even there. Also, what is the purpose of R3?

http://jeelabs.org/2011/12/17/a-power-supply-which-draws-12-mw/
this one confuses me from the beginning because of  C1/R1 and C4 on the input stage, then the regulating(?) zener U$1 comes before the rectifying diode D2. The filtering cap C2, I understand and everything on the right of C2, I assume(having looked at the LT1121 datasheet) is part of the final regulating stage.

http://www.daycounter.com/Circuits/Transformerless-Power-Supplies/Transformerless-Power-Supplies.phtml
this one I can also partially understand but again, the(I assume) regulating zener comes before the rectifying diode D2 in figures 1,2 and 3. Why are the input stages in Figure 1,2,3 and 4 all different?


Why are all of these so different. Is any particular design superior to another.

So I am laying out my first PCB at work and am getting mixed up with all this information I'm finding on using ferrite beads on digital supply lines/pins and noise reduction.

I was originally under the impression that you would want to keep any switching noise from digital ICs from propagating back into the psu/other components (and vice versa) by sticking a ferrite at the digital IC power pin and directly at the digital supply input to a board. 

BUT, I stumbled on [this page](http://processors.wiki.ti.com/index.php/General_hardware_design/BGA_PCB_design/BGA_decoupling#When_not_to_use_them) that says don't use ferrite beads on digital power sections since it resists the high transient current draw needed for the IC clock. Which makes perfect sense to me. Then how do you deal with digital noise throughout the circuit? I can't really find anything else that agrees or even mentions with it. All the other info I can find involves separating the digital from the analog supply/filter section when you have a single power input line to the PCB. 

I've just been going with datasheet recommendations for bypass cap values, but it looks like I may [need](http://download.micron.com/pdf/technotes/TN0006.pdf) to [calculate](http://download.micron.com/pdf/technotes/TN0006.pdf) the frequency/transient current response to see if I can stick a ferrite in there and the bypass can provide the needed current.

I was looking for general advice (books would be great, even [general](http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=sxRtQgAACAAJ&amp;source=gbs_similarbooks) layout ones), but it's always situation specific.  So some vague details:

80MHz PIC (digital power)

several high resolution ADCs/DACs (&gt;100kHz sample, DAC only uses digital power)

single/solid ground plane

separate power rails from the psu for analog and digital power, both used on a single plane. So I'm probably being overly paranoid.

There are touch-keys also connected to this IR panel. Initially I removed the panel with the IR and touch-keys and found power lines and data lines (4 pins - +/- power, +/- data) as well as an IC. This made me think that the panel interpreted the IR/touch-key signal and then converted it to a digital pulse or something when sending it to the LCD control board.

Well just recently I went to go check it with a oscilloscope... and that's not how it works. The signal is very rough (though generally following a sin wave). When I press a touch key, it gets really rough (higher frequency I think). The pattern observed looks pretty similar for all buttons except two where the amplitude is higher.

The oscilloscope wasn't able to get any sort of fix on the actual frequency.

So what I'm guessing is this board just takes the IR signal and the button presses and converts them to the same type of analog signal.

I think my next logical step would be to get the amplitude/frequency produced by the remote... which I guess could be done using an infrared photosensitive transistor and an Arduino with some prewritten code.

Once getting that though, is it possible to take the IR out of the equation and reproduce the signal on the Arduino (digitally or as analog)?

It's an enormous project that I have had success with up until now, but admittedly, I perhaps should have just spent the extra money on a pre-built one. I have not seen many RF boards, and without schematics, I was hoping a knowledgeable person would simply know some standard structure for these sorts of boards. If anyone can point me in the right direction, Thank You, if not, no problem, I'll figure it out somehow.

**Background:** I'm pretty handy mechanically, but I am a complete novice with Electronics, especially with Radio Frequency receivers and controllers. I have done my due diligence on this problem, working tens of hours over the course of weeks to try and figure it out, and fiddling with the pieces.

**Problem:** I am attempting to create an Electric Skateboard, but at the moment, the only concern is getting the motor to run at different speeds. 

The components are:
-36V Lithium Battery Pack
-36V Electric Scooter Motor
-36V Speed Controller, for that motor
-RF Controller ""Gun""
-RF receiver

I purchased this RF receiver and the controller for that receiver from the same company, and they are meant to go together:

http://imgur.com/a/yINTZ

Unfortunately, the board did not come with a schematic, my Google searches based on the markings on the board itself have been fruitless, and the company cannot provide me with one. I am attempting to connect it to the Speed Controller, schematic here:

http://www.electricscooterparts.com/hookup/CT-312C1-3.htm

Through the Throttle(/Battery Gauge) connector. Once connected, it should respond to the RF controller gun, and when pressed, it should accelerate, and when left alone, it should not send a signal. I have used cables to connect the RF receiver through the ""4.3 V positive"" and ""Ground"" at various jumpers on the board, and then connecting the ""Signal"" through various jumpers. At times, with these connected, I have gotten the motor to work just fine, except it is always one speed, there is no variable speed, and when using the RF controller gun, it doesn't change the speed at all.

My questions are: Is there a general standard purpose for jumpers on an RF receiver board of this type? Am I doing something horribly wrong? As far as I understand, the motor and speed controller should fit with a board of this type, as the company I bought the board from has motors very similar to this, but is it likely they are not compatible anyway?

Is this practical?,11,3,15,http://www.reddit.com/r/AskElectronics/comments/127nnc/i_want_to_build_an_8bit_adder_is_this_practical/,"Basically, the idea is that there would be two rows of 8 switches (the inputs) and a row of 8 LEDs (the output). I'd like to build it out of simple transistors. Ideally, it would be portable and would run off of a 6V battery, and it would be permanent (everything soldered together). I guess I would need some sort of chassis for it.

Is this feasible?

One challenge I have with this is that I have no idea what kinds of transistors to buy. I don't know what the difference is between a PNP or NPN transistor (does it matter?), or what other properties I should be looking out for.

**The following is just some background information about me:**

I am a programmer by trade, but very inexperienced when it comes to building real, physical circuits.

I have taken a calculus-based physics class on electricity and magnetism. In that class I learned about a lot of the concepts behind DC and AC circuits, including voltage, current, resistance, capacitance, inductance, impedance, and so on. Coulomb's Law, Ohm's Law, Gauss's Law, Kirchhoff's Laws, Ampere's Law, and so on. I feel like I have all of these concepts down.

The problem is that I have very little experience building actual circuits. We've made a few simple breadboard circuits involving resistors and LEDs, sure. In lab, we made a rectifier using diodes (wheatsone bridge), filtered with a capacitor. However, that is about it.

On my own, I've ""built"" a lot of logic circuits -- using a software simulation program. In that program, NAND gates are given, and you have to build the other logic gates (AND, OR, XOR, etc.) from those; and then use those as building blocks for more-complex circuits.

So far it has been working, but I noticed one little thing:

Here is my circuit:

Now, as far as I understand, by slowly increasing Vgs you can slowly decrease Vds. Hence if I input a ramp voltage into Vgs I should see a ramp like voltage on the output. 

But when I simulate the circuit, thisi s what I get:

As you can see, the reponse from the mosfet is instantaneous. Maybe I am using the wrong type of MOSFET?

I removed everything after M1 and simply added a load, to see that part of the circuit's behaviour and I get the same thing:

Thanks again everyone.

I made a very simple circuit that runs an ATTINY45 as an arduino. All it does is take an analog reading in, and put out PWM to a mosfet for dimming a long line of LEDs (approx 1 amp). When I was running this on the breadboard I used all 5V and it worked. The mosfet however tends to freak out when trying to switch 12V. I've verified that I'm getting a good 5V. I also know that this 'arduino' works fine back in the beradboard so it has the right program on it and functions there. So the only difference is the mosfet is switching 12V now vs 5V. I feel like something is left floating as they will blink like seen in the video below but touching the back of the circuit will cause the LEDs to come full on. Any ideas?

All I want to do is take the 5v high from an Microcontroller, and use that to trip the transistor and complete the circuit the lazer is on.

Sparkfun is dragging their feet on their update of the [EL sequencer](http://www.sparkfun.com/products/9203), so I thought I'd pop into Seeed studio's $10 board service and make some of my own. Super easy right, just copy all the open hardware designs to fuse the arduino pro with some of the Triac circuits. 

I noticed something though, in their [update](http://www.sparkfun.com/products/10878) they (smartly) added optoisolation to their triac switching circuits. The design is totally normal for any solid state relay circuit, and actually now that I think of it literally every triac switching I have come across. Why?! 

Most of the circuits [here](http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_FdGFE8NBDgc/TDsHxhuPfiI/AAAAAAAAD_Y/gn2IbmcVU8c/s1600/DC_Control_for_Triacs_Circuit_Diagram.png) [here](http://electronics.stackexchange.com/questions/17731/choosing-components-for-a-triacs-snubber) etc... are built for motor switching and AC power lines, I am dealing with far far less current than that. 

So what is the deal, do I NEED that second triac or can the opto guys handle the switching current, since it is zero crossing it should be fine with transients.. the second triac is like .70c (usd) each and quite a lot of valuable real estate. 

-----------------------------------------------

**EDIT: Conclusions**

From what I have gathered so far the reasons that it is NOT ok to run an opto-triac without a second load triac are the following 

* The internal Triacs are very low current
* The inrush current of an inductive or resistive load can be many times operating current (see previous)
* They are only designed to switch another Triac.

That last point is pretty easy to ignore though, so given the very low current of EL, and the fact that it is a capacitive load, I may be able to get away with it. I'll place a order and hit the bench in the near future.

I found multiple sources saying that I need a 'reset' chip before the printer will recognize that my cartridge has been refilled and is not actually just empty.

So I found where this chip was stored in a little drawer in the cartridge, and noticed it was a very simple 8 pin IC on a circuit board with no visible input/output pins. Just a ring of tracks... which led me to believe this is an RFID tag and what I'm seeing is rings to provide power through an inductive external source.

So I checked the model number online, and sure enough - it's an RFID tag and that's it.

Now as far as I know, RFID tags basically just broadcast an ID and that's it - they cannot really be written wirelessly (I think).

Therefore, I've come to the conclusion that the 'page count' associated with the chip ID on the toner cartridge isn't actually stored in the chip, but rather in the printer's memory itself.

That seems kind of weird though, because that would mean I could take the 'empty' cartridge from my laser printer, refill it, and then stick it in an identical laser printer that hasn't 'seen' the cartridge before and have it work like it's brand new.

Anyone know if this is the case? I would rather not buy a stupid overpriced 'reset chip' online and just reset the memory on my printer instead :p

Thanks!


**EDIT**: So this is the part number written on the chips : **MH2046 818 42E**

I looked around online, and apparently everyone who has looked says it's similar to the MH204 and can't find any further information.

Unfortunately, the chip is read/written - so the page count is stored in the chip.

So Ig needed to drive the FET should be about :
Qg*f = 4.8uA

The avr chip can sink/source something around 80mA per port. I'm using 2 pins on a port to drive two MOSFET's, therefore unless I'm understanding something incorrectly, I should have ample current to properly charge/discharge the FET's in the time needed.

I should add the waveform is actually 800uS on, then 30ms off, etc., which I guess is something like 2.6% Duty Cycle? 

Also, the load is 54V, and 2 ohms, so very high current.

The power supply is only rated for 5A so I don't know how it is even working. I guess because it's pulsed it's effectively a good bit less than 5A. I think I saw somewhere that the RMS was a*sqrt(D) where a is the amplitude of the signal, and D is the duty cycle. So I'd have something like 27A * sqrt(.027) = 4.44A as my RMS current.

Does anyone have any good resources which get into the actual implementation of ADSL/FSK systems?

I'm familiar with communications theory, but they never went into practical implementation at Uni. Mainly theoretical construction and deconstruction of the signal, not too much on the front ends either but I'm quite comfortable with analog signals.

From what I've read these systems are implemented on high speed DSP with ADC/DAC and associated front end, I can see how it is possible but I don't know how to attack the problem.

Let me start by saying I know very little about electronics. I once tried to change a light switch without turning off the power thinking my Dr.Martins would stop me getting shocked ... I was also dropping wet as I just had a show. So yeah, just keep that in mind here. 

I want to make a speaker box in an ammo box. One thing I hate, is waiting for things to charge (most of my power tools are mains operated for this, so I don't have to wait for charging). So I was thinking; could I use capacitors instead? 

Mostly inspired by this guy's ""boost pack"" (http://youtu.be/GPJao1xLe7w) he made to replace a car bat. Most of the ammo box builds I've seen use car batteries, and I could add on a ciggy lighter socket for extra bits when I'm out and about. 

So, is that a thing a person like me could figure out? 

Is there even that much to figure out? 

My assumption would be just to buy some big ol' capacitors that add up to what ever voltage I  need, add a bit of power and go about my day. Or am I utterly wrong there?

it is not like in engineering where I can plan ahead and buy components for the long run.  Sure, we try to do that, but new ideas are born all the time in the course of data collection, making it necessary to choose new frequencies.

This a bit towards the scienc-ey end of electronics, but it here seemed more relevant than /r/AskSciTech.

I'm trying to use a lock-in amplifier to reduce noise in a spectrometer experiment. Pretty standard set up:
 
Light source -&gt; Chopper -&gt; Spectrometer -&gt; Lock-in Amp -&gt; Oscilloscope

And of course, the reference signal from the chopper goes to the amp as well. 

I was expecting the output to be similar to the input signal, but with less noise. [However, this is my output.](http://i.imgur.com/isvxYvp.png) Yellow is input signal, blue is output.
Sorry for the horrendously low resolution (cue 'was this picture taken with a potato' jokes), but it's the best the oscilloscope can handle.

To my eye, this looks like the output is being smoothed over time, making it more or less useless to me. I've got the time constant as low as it'll go (1ms), and increasing it seems to increase the smoothing effect.

As you can see, the signal is getting through, so I don't think it's a reference problem (I've checked the signal monitor output and matched up perfectly).

I'm not all that familiar with these devices, so I'm not really sure where to go from here. Is it just not fast enough to keep up with the signal? According to the manual, it should work up to 120kHz. :s

* Pictures are after the smoke happened.

Basically I have a 50-channel GPS Receiver and I want to make something out of it.

First of all, is there a difference between a GPS logger or receiver? 

I noticed GPS devices like cell phones can be tracked by software (for example Norton Anti-theft, Plan B, etc...) but some GPS devices only show you directions/maps and don't have any tracking or remote control features. 

Do both types of devices use the same general techology, a GPS logger? It is my understanding that as long as you have a GPS Receiver/Logger, all of those functions like tracking, logging, and directions are entirely software based. 

In other words, if I wanted to take a Magellan Navigation System and mod it to send logs to an online database that I host, could I do this?

If I'm correct that my [GPS Receiver](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/9566) can log locations, how do I get this information to an online database? Do I need a cell phone or something with a data plan?

If so, how does [pet tracker](http://www.pettracker.com) work? They do require a monthly subscription fee, but I certainly doubt those devices have a cell service carrier.

The Child Guidance Talk 'n Play. This bad boy provided me with hours of entertainment as a kid, and as an adult, I'd all but forgotten about it.

With all the tech we've got today, why hasn't anyone tried repairing one? Barring that, why hasn't anyone designed an emulator?

Okay, maybe ""emulator"" isn't the right term, but it's evocative, and it makes my point, I think.
As I understand it, the Talk 'n Play worked like a 4-track cassette player, with the user being prompted to press colored buttons at various moments, which would instruct the machine to play one of the four tracks on the tape. Seems simple enough on paper.
Well, maybe my Google-fu isn't as strong as it should be, because I'll be damned if I can find *anything* out there about how to build a 4-track player, or even repair one.

I have had suggestions to use the Texas Instruments 5940 chip (http://uk.farnell.com/texas-instruments/tlc5940ntg4/ic-16ch-led-driver-dip28-5940/dp/1226306) in combination with time multiplexing to control which LED is on at a time, but this is a power sink and would only work with common anode LEDs.

Another suggestion was to use lots of transistors to control which LED is on at a time but this seems like too many transistors to be useful.

What I think I would need is the opposite of the 5940 chip, so instead of controlling which output is grounded to turn an LED on, I choose which LED is powered. In combination with time multiplexing, this could work. However, I do not know what these chips might be called or how to search for them.

**Project introduction:** 
&gt;The Very Simple Computer (VSC)
&gt;was designed in class and breadboarded in
&gt;the laboratory by the students of an
&gt;undergraduate-level computer architectures
&gt;course. The computer uses small and
&gt;medium scale TTL integrated circuits. It has
&gt;an 8-bit word with a 3-bit op-code and a 5-bit
&gt;address, resulting in 8 instructions and 32
&gt;words of memory. The VSC uses a rocker
&gt;switch input and directly monitors (with LEDs)
&gt;the bus for the output. This relatively
&gt;inexpensive project (&lt;$100 including power
&gt;supply, ICS, breadboards and assorted
&gt;hardware) is a natural for a small computer
&gt;science department on a limited budget. In
&gt;addition to providing the students with a
&gt;sense of accomplishment, the VSC raises
&gt;many practical architecture issues not
&gt;encounted when using laboratory simulators:
&gt;This paper outlines a method for incorporating
&gt;the design of the VSC into
&gt;regular classroom lectures, and offers a
&gt;number of recommendations for instructors
&gt;who would consider using the VSC in their
&gt;own course.

&gt;A number of educators have used simple
&gt;computer designs to provide a basis for
&gt;classroom instruction. Notable examples are
&gt;Sajjan Shiva’s ASC (A Simple Computer)l
&gt;and A. K. Dewdney’s SCRAM (Simple but
&gt;Complete Random Access Machine).z While
&gt;these computers have no practical purpose
&gt;beyond their educational value, they are both
&gt;candidates for classroom laboratory projects.
&gt;While the design of the VSC was heavily
&gt;influenced by these two machines, the
&gt;decision to take the system to hardware
&gt;produced a slightly different set of design
&gt;goals. First of all, the VSC has an instruction set size of 8 rather than 16 as provided for in
&gt;the ASC. This decision was based on the
&gt;simpler hardware configuration resulting from
&gt;the smaller instruction set. Next, the VSC
&gt;provides 32 words addressable memory
&gt;rather than 16 as with the SCRAM. This was
&gt;done to provide an example of chip-select
&gt;circuit design in the memory unit. A block
&gt;diagram of the VSC is shown in Figure 1. The breadboarding of each VSC
&gt;functional module is assigned to one or two
&gt;students as individual projects. These
&gt;assignments are given with a design specification,
&gt;indicating the format of inputs and
&gt;outputs, expected control signals and
&gt;required outputs of each module. The
&gt;modules are tested independently and
&gt;passed by the instructor. Toward the end of
&gt;the course, the class begins the task of
&gt;module integration. The integration effort is
&gt;one of the most beneficial laboratory
&gt;exercises of the course, usually requiring
&gt;occasional conflict resolutions by the
&gt;instructor.

A couple of days ago on /r/electronics I saw that somebody had build a UV LED array to photo-etch PCBs and thought it was a really good idea (much better than the UV box I tried to build years ago with a couple of UV florescent tubes) and I thought I'd have ago at building one.

Looking around I've found several people who have done this and they've all used different LEDs with different view angles and brightnesses. A quick check of my options shows I can get either 3000mCd 20deg LEDs or 500mCD 170deg LEDs and this is where I have a question.

As far as I understand, the rating of the LEDs in mCD is the brightness, not the amount of light that they throw out in total. That is a very bright (high mCd) LED with a small view angle can give off the same total amount of light as a dimmer (lower mCD) LED with a large view angle, it's just the light is spread over a larger area. Is this right?

It's just that to give the most even illumination I would have thought a panel of LEDs with the biggest view angle (the 500mCd 170deg ones) would be better (assuming I put a mirrored or white edges around the panel to reflect back the light that would be lost) but I wanted to make sure that the total illumination wouldn't be greatly reduced.

On his departure, the friends shared looks of suspicion and wondered what the incident was all about. On looking at the support strut they noticed a metallic button-like object attached to it. Upon repeated tries, they could not pry the device off the wall. Upon investigation of the other struts, no other devices were found.

Upon hearing this story, I decided to investigate, so I walked over a few hours later and pried the device off the wall with a putty knife. Bringing it back to the office, I pried the device apart and found a circuit board inside.

We have no idea what the hell this thing is, and we're really intrigued what this device might be. There were no batteries inside or power source that could be seen, so what the heck could it be?

My husband wants to make sure I don't kill myself having electricity and water together and wants me to be a slave to a little 9v battery.  I'd like something that can be used again and again that will also etch quickly (5 minutes to 30 mins tops).  So what are my options?

Do I find an old cell phone charger plug, strip the wires and then hook them to wire extensions with alligator clips?  I've read things about people using various chargers set to amp limits and I know I need dc not ac, but I will be honest-that's pretty much the extent of my knowledge.

Usually they end up with a lot of noise, or hum.  

Just today I was assisting a friend who took apart a Lepai 2020a+ amplifier, and inside was a pot with six pins and a wire which appeared to either go to the power or ground plane that was soldered directly to the casing of the pot.  

This amp was connected to a board of my own design via an RCA cable, and after his modification, the sound of data being transmitted to an LED module on my board via a ribbon cable became extremely loud.  Normally you would have to listen closely to notice it, but after his failed mod it was as loud as all the other sound effects, so I'm not sure if it was picking up RF interference from the air, or if I had some kind of a ground loop... Truth be told I'm not even sure what a ground loop is exactly. I know it's to be avoided but I don't know how one would cause one in the first place.  I mention it because I've heard it's bad, and this amp was running off the same battery as the audio and light circuit, and so they share a ground, and the RCA cable has a ground, and that's a kind of loop I guess, but I don't know if that's a ground loop or not.

Anyway, his pot had that wire soldered to the outside and I tried to find some info online as to why they would do that, but I didn't see anything.  It seems odd since you'd have a ground on one of the pins for an audio pot, wouldn't you?

I'm pretty sure none of the others who have tried these sorts of mods have soldered any ground wires to the outside of the pot, and my friend screwed up the board pretty bad when he removed the pot from it, so honestly I can't even be sure everything was wired back up the same in the end, but since others who have tried this same sort of things have had issues, I'm wondering if anyone has any suggestions for how to accomplish this mod successfully and put the volume pot on some 6"" leads?

I want to replace everything that looks damaged, but I need help finding replacements.

I could probably find something on Digikey or one of those biggies, but shipping is a small fortune! I want to buy something from the smaller places that has very cheap shipping, but that means a small selection. So I need tips on figuring out what I need.

Here's photos of the componens I want to replace: http://imgur.com/a/ZWjsV
Sorry about the image quality, but they aren't much easier to read in real life.

First, **two small caps**:  
One is unreadable, but I'm pretty sure they are the same. They were in series, with the middle pin connected to something. The text is:

    250~
    RY1n

I guess that means they are 1nF 250VAC caps? Can I just get any 1nF caps with at least 250V, or do I need a certain type of caps? I'll make a quick capacitance meter to verify their current capacitance.

Next, **the box capacitor**:  
Fortunately I can see it's a Rita PME 271 M 610, 0.1uF, 250V. The 250V isn't visible on this cap, but I found a photo of a cap that is [almost exactly the same](http://www.vintage-radio.net/forum/attachment.php?attachmentid=50817&amp;d=1304970801), just X2 in stead of X. Can I just get any 0.1uF cap with at least 250V, or do I need a certain type of cap?  

Finally, **the resistor**: 
The color bands are really hard to read, but I think it says 56 ohm 5%. My multimeter says about 59 ohm. That's almost within 5%, and considering the age and damage I'm convinced.  
I think it looks bigger than 1/2W and a lot smaller than 5W. I'm guessing 1W. I should have included a scale or taken measurements. :-/

I am building a circuit where most of the components work on 5V but one, that works on 3.3V. This 3V3 must be as stable as possible, considering that the overall power input is the +12V coming from the car battery, which, correct me if I'm wrong, could be quite noisy when the car is running.

The question here is: How do I create the regulation circuit for maximize stability and avoid noise?

I've seen that, for example, Arduino has two regulators, one that takes ""anything"" and outputs 5v, and the second one that gets the +5V from the first one and outputs a +3V3, whose output is further stabilized by a 1uF capacitor.

I was thinking that this solution is better than making the 3V regulator also taking directly the battery 12V as input. Is this correct?

Also, would this be enough or would you advice taking some more precautions? Such as using more than 1uF for the 3V3 output capacitor, or even some more circuitry before the 5V regulator (beside the standard 10uF capacitors)?

Re: [This](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskElectronics/comments/15q79w/flyback_transformer_for_plasma_speakers/). Just had a thought. 

Plasma globes are cheap and everywhere. I know some that can be driven by USB (5V, 1A), or batteries otherwise. They step that up to a couple kilovolts for the plasma globe.

And they have a flyback inside that's designed for high voltage. Even though power's going to be pitiful, can't they be used to build plasma speakers with?

Bonus: The driving frequency of the transformer can be found just be looking at the trace of the driving circuit in the PCB inside the plasma globe.

So I've got this guy: (https://www.sparkfun.com/products/10967) and he gets fried from reversed polarity when the battery is inserted backwards. Unfortunately due to the really weird setup it's not possible to use conventional methods of protecting against reversed polarity (nubs on the positive terminal, one-way only plugs etc). I _know_ that sounds insane, but just trust me on this. I'm trying to find an electronic solution to protecting the component from reversed polarity. Tried using a Schottky diode but the forward voltage drop (0.48V) was so high that the StepUp driver can't work well.

Next thing I tried was putting the Shottky in parallel with the battery but backwards to act as a shunt. When the battery is inserted properly the Shottky diode pretty much blocks current from flowing through it and everything works just fine. Turn the battery backwards and instead of the battery frying the StepUp driver, the current (for the most part) flows through the diode. Problem is, it drains so much and so quickly that the battery contacts got EXTREMELY hot and everything MELTED. :D NiMH batteries have an impressive discharge rate! Something like 2.8A if I'm not mistaken! Also the Diode is rated at 1A so I don't even think this is going to protect the StepUp for very long.

The good news is, it protected the StepUp driver! Bad news is, it created amazing new problems. Hah! So... what the heck am I doing? Is there a nifty way to get a transistor or cheap little MOSFET into the circuit before the StepUp driver that would allow current to flow to the driver when the polarity is right, but shut it down when it's reversed? Better yet, is there some trick to make it that either way you insert the battery the device will work properly?

I'm not a total noob, but I'm not trained. I've learned everything from experimentation and asking questions. I've destroyed more than I've created. Help me keep destroying things!

Here is a little mathematica code that allows me to probe the function space by choosing some values.  The values I chose here are the actual measured coil series resistance and its inductance (I will post the code if you want it!):

[Mathematica slider program](http://imgur.com/Qosmz)

I'm pretty sure the code works, because the values it outputs for frequencies I have sort of memorized are pretty good.  For example, f = 30.1735 MHz, then cs ~ 10-30 pF and cg ~ 600 pF gives a good impedance. This is experimentally true.

But guys, I cannot for the life of me figure out how to characterize the space {f, cs, cg} to make the impedance matched! And it is absolutely vital that the matching is very very good, or else the weak NMR signals will not be noticed.

Sometimes in the process of NMR/NQR it is useful to do a back of the envelope calculation that tells me to check 39.8675 MHz if I see a signal at 30.8673 MHz (made up numbers)...but changing frequency is a pain in the ass, because the values of the caps greatly differ and I tune them by hand.  I don't want to go to the mathematica program I wrote - I want something faster. 

I wish I had level curves....or a contour plot.  Something like, in pseudocode,

**Plot {cs,cg} as a function of frequency such that Ztot = 50 Ohms and Im[Z]~constant**

Whatever works.  I'd like some understanding of how this circuit works, because it's being difficult.  Anything helps.

I've already confirmed the battery is capable of charging and powering the Pi at the same time.

What I'd like to happen: When power is available to charge the UPS (from the ignition) this will switch the Pi on. When power to the UPS is switched off, the Pi will be signalled to shut down, after sufficient time has elapsed to allow the Pi to shutdown, the UPS should shut off the power.


What I'm thinking: Power from the car, as well as supplying the UPS, will also switch on [2 opto-isolators](http://www.sparkfun.com/products/314). Opto1 will turn on the UPS-to-Pi power, the connection from car to Opto1 will also include a capacitor to keep Opto1 on for a short time after the car power is switched off. Opto2 will be used to signal the Pi when the car power goes off, so it can initiate a shutdown.


What I need to know: Is this solution over/under/poorly designed? How to calculate what size capacitor I will need to keep Opto1 lit long enough to allow the Pi to power down? Is there a simpler/better solution?

I think we all know the inverting op amp amplifier circuit (resistor from input to negative opamp input, resistor from there to the output, positive opamp input grounded).

Suppose you want a gain of -1.0. Now, you could use two 100-ohm resistors. Or two 1000-ohm resistors. Or two 20-megaohm resistors. Or... you get the idea.

Does it matter at all, what the magnitude of these resistors are? Theoretically it ought not to matter... but I have a circuit with some large resistors (many megaohms) and I'm suspecting that small bits of noise in the circuit, are ending up being large voltages on the output, because of this.

Like if you have 1 uV of noise or interference, then 1 megaohm resistance means ~ 1 V of noise. Or something like that.

I'm going to try reducing it to the kohm range, but does anyone have any comments?

Everything is working exactly as it should (decent stable output, etc), except my rectifying diode on the secondary winding of my flyback is getting very very hot (painful to touch).  It's rated for 200V, 2A (ss2150)

I can't for the life of me figure out why it's getting so warm.  It's a schottky diode, and the whole secondary circuit only draws around 1-2mA under load.

I want to think that it has something to do with some large AC currents passing through the diode and shunting to ground through the output caps, but I wouldn't think there would be enough to really roast the diode.

The diode does report a .5mA leakage under 150V reverse, but this would only give off 75mW of power which doesn't seem like enough to explain what's happening.  I've found some smaller current rating that boast a 500nA reverse current at that voltage level.  Should I use one of those?

Say for example I have an Arduino or TI-Launchpad or one of those and I programmed it to have an LED blink every 10 seconds or so. If I just have a DC power supply (batteries I suppose) how does the circuit turn the LED on? It would have to have current flowing through the LED and in order to have current you need to have voltage right? Well how does the circuit apply a voltage and then take it away without someone physically disconnecting and connecting a voltage source every 10 seconds?

EDIT: sorry for the still bad explanation. What I was really asking for is expressed in jorticus' [reply](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskElectronics/comments/h3ksh/how_is_it_possible_to_change_a_voltage_at_a_part/c1sb75i) which was: how does the microcontroller set a pin to a high voltage?

&gt;Once you send a logic HIGH voltage (usually 5 V) to the left side pin of the transistor, it kind of like connects the emitter (bottom) pin to ground, allowing current to flow through your device

HOW does it send a logic high and HOW does it connect the emitter pin to ground?

It was suggested that I should blink the LEDs in that circuit by using an N-channel MOSFET, rather than simply making the PIC pins go high/low.  1Davide gave a thorough explanation of how I should insert the MOSFET into the circuit.

I obtained this MOSFET:  http://search.digikey.com/scripts/DkSearch/dksus.dll?Detail&amp;name=2SK2962%28F%29-ND

I've built a simple sample circuit on a breadboard, where I connected the PIC pin to the Gate on the MOSFET, Source pin to ground, and Drain to a 10ohm resistor then through an LED then to ground.  I have a simple program that turns the PIC pin high/low.  But, nothing happens at the LED.  I tested the program with the LED on the PIC pin, and it's fine.

So, I'm trying to understand how the MOSFET works, in order to understand why my LED isn't blinking.  Here's what I think I know so far:

* it normally doesn't pass any current
* if the Gate sees a voltage above its threshold, it passes current to the Drain

Things I'm wondering about when I think why it might not work:

* where does the current come from to drive the LED?  1Davide said to connect the Source to the ""negative supply"".  I interpreted that to mean **ground** - but maybe he meant the +5V supply?  In that case, current would pass straight from Source to Drain, so long as Gate allows it - and that makes sense to me. 
* when I set a PIC pin ""high"", exactly what voltage does that produce?  (I bet the datasheet says, but I just thought of this while I'm typing...)  If that voltage is not above the Gate's threshold, then the Gate won't open.  If I read the datasheet right, this MOSFET's Gate threshold is 0.8V minimum.

I'm sure this is probably easier than I'm making it out to be, but yet it ain't working.

Thanks for your help.

**EDIT/UPDATE:**

I tried it with this MOSFET instead:  http://parts.digikey.com/1/parts/1025893-mosfet-n-ch-60v-1-1a-to92-3-zvn4306a.html

With this one, IF I connect the Source to the +5V supply, the LED lights continuously, but doesn't blink.  If I connect Source to ground, nothing happens.

In my experience these cause nothing but frustration, due to the ground leakage they create (hundreds of microamp!):

 * Sensitive measurements see ground fluctuations due to the ground resistance.
 * If I try to lift the ground, then the interference often gets worse since the ground currents are now running down my signal cables' shields. So, I have to install bypass ground drain wires and pray that I can screw them on tight enough to make a low enough resistance.
 * If the ground pin gets disconnected accidentally on an otherwise floating appliance (e.g. laptop powered through a 2 prong mains power adapter), then touching the equipment gives enough current to [cause small shocks](https://www.google.es/search?q=laptop%20shocks%20me%20when%20plugged%20in).

I have to ask, why on earth are there Y capacitors? Appliance-induced ground currents would be 100x smaller without them (just look at the data sheet of a medical grade power entry module, and compare to a standard one). I know they are supposed to help with radio frequency EMC filtering and all, but to that end why not instead just slightly beef up the X capacitor (which couples line-line), and/or move the Y capacitors to the *equipment* side of the power supply transformer? The Y caps actually *create* an EMC problem for a guy like me measuring analog at low frequencies.

It seems the mains-side Y capacitor is exploiting the safety earth wire to a bad end. The whole point of safety earth is that an electric shock requires two failures: appliance short circuit on transformer mains side AND disconnect of safety earth.

I'd love to know why IPS screens seem to be so prone to this ""yellowing"" issue with the tint.

To be clear: I'm *not* talking about subjective preferences between ""cooler"" and ""warmer"" colour temperatures etc.

I'm also *not* talking about backlight bleed or even ""glue"" drying, since this yellow tint problem persists after many weeks of use.

I've had and seen *many* IPS based displays from phones to computer monitors and they almost ALL have this issue to some degree or other. 

The internet is awash with forum posts where people with iPhones, HTC's etc and monitor displays are complaining about a yellow tint to their screens in some form or another. I've *even* seen it with amoled displays - Glaaxy S3 surprised me when I saw it had it, same with S4. IPS displays are particularly notorious for it. People go round and round suggesting that it will go away on it's own, that it's personal preference, that it's not really there, that it's ""normal"" and you'll get used to it, that you should switch to amoled etc etc. The reality is that it *is* there and to the extent that a lot of people can see it and have a problem with it (understandably and me included), it's very frustrating. 

I've currently got a Nexus 4 I'm relatively happy with but I had to go through about 8(!) returns to get one I found ""acceptable"" and even then the issue is still there.

It seems to be that the ""yellowing"" is normally more pronounced on one side of the screen to the other in a kind of gradient, although sometimes it's relatively uniform across the screen.

My theory is that most people simply don't care and see their screens as ""good enough"" which is why manufacturers have never got round to addressing the issue which is looooongstanding.

I'm about 90% sure it's something to do with the nature of the manufacturing process or even something inherent in IPS technology. *Something* is causing it and I'd love to know, in technical terms why it keeps happening and why it's never addressed.

So if we could find out what's causing it, maybe we could figure out why it's never addressed. Cost probably, but then it's also likely due to user apathy. What is the *cause*??

Hi! the [74HC595](http://www.nxp.com/documents/data_sheet/74HC_HCT595.pdf) is a serial in, parallel out shift register that i want to use to control an 8x8 LED display. The LED display is the [LE-MM103](http://darcy.rsgc.on.ca/ACES/Datasheets/LE-MM103.pdf). It has 24 pins. 

Along the top are 16 pins, 8 of which are connected to their own *column* of red LED anodes and 8 of which are connected to their own *column* of green LED anodes. The remaining 8 pins are connected to a *row* of cathodes. So, I can use a shift register to provide serial data to the 16 anode pins, then multiplex each row by changing which of the 8 cathode pins are connected to ground. 

Now my instinct was to use 8 BJTs to connect the rows to 5V (row is inactive as voltage drop across the LEDs on that row is 0) or 0V (row is active as voltage drop across them is sufficient to switch them on). Here is where my questions arrive.

The datasheet I have for the MC74HC595A indicates an input current for each pin. Does this mean I can simply set the correct pin on the shift register to 0, the rest to 1 and sink current through it into the ground pin?

I have a hexaphonic guitar pickup (i.e. separate signal for each string). I would love to build some sort of box that outputs only whichever string is the loudest, so that I can use that for some sort of monophonic synth effect. (Another possible use case could be to attenuate the inputs on the higher strings so that the output will be whichever is the lowest string that's currently playing, and then octave-divide that to get a bass tone.)

Anyway, enough about the use cases. I'm wondering how I could actually implement this. It would be easy in DSP, but I've never really designed a full DSP system before, and I don't know of a good way to get 6 inputs into my Raspberry Pi on the cheap, so I'm hoping to stay analog.

Obviously I would need 6 envelope detectors; that's the (relatively) easy part. I could also use an analog mux to select which signal will be output. But it's the part in between that I don't know how to do: having 6 voltages coming from the envelope detectors and figuring out which is highest. I imagine I would want to do some sort of comparator shenanigans, but I can't actually figure out a configuration that would work.

All I've been able to figure out so far is a completely different implementation that's way too complicated: create a block that takes 2 signals, does envelope detection on both, compares them, and passes through whichever is louder. The problem is, I would need 5 of these blocks in total, and that means I need 10 envelope detectors, which would be way more complicated than what I want.

1372820875.0,6,self.AskElectronics,1hjkdt,Trying to wrap my head around floating grounds and what happens when they are connected...,8,2,23,http://www.reddit.com/r/AskElectronics/comments/1hjkdt/trying_to_wrap_my_head_around_floating_grounds/,"I'm trying to wrap my head around floating ground circuits, and what happens when their grounds are connected.

Let's say I build some circuit, any circuit, powered by a DC wallwart, which only has two pins that go into the mains outlet.  My circuit has a ground rail and, say, a +9V rail.  My understanding is that the 9V rail is 9V higher than the ground rail, in relative terms, but the actual absolute potential of both rails is arbitrary.  My ground rail is ""floating"" and is not guaranteed to be at the same absolute potential as either the netural or safety earth pin of my outlet.  Is this correct?

Side question: under real world conditions, what sort of difference in absolute potential between the negative output of a DC wallwart and the mains neutral/earth would I actually expect to see?  What causes that difference?

Now let's say I build a second wallwart powered circuit, plugged into a different outlet.  Again I have a floating ground rail, and a rail 9V higher than that ground rail.  Again, the ground rail's absolute potential is arbitrary.  Also, I assume that in general there is no guarantee of any kind of fixed relationship between the absolute potential of the two ground rails, and one may be higher than the other.

Suppose I connect the grounds of these two circuits together (let's say one is a synthesiser of some kind and the other is an amplifier).  This is a perfectly ordinary thing to do and I've done it before and I understand that, practically speaking, the two circuits just ""fall in line"", i.e. the two ground rails end up at equal potentials.  But what is actually *happening* here?  At the instant I make the connection, does current briefly flow from whichever ground happens to be higher to the other one, before the equalise?  Part of me feels like it must because there was, at least initially, a potential difference between the two grounds.  But where does that current flow, I mean it needs to flow in a loop, right?

Now, suppose I bring my oscilloscope to the bench with these two circuits.  Unlike the wallwarts, the scope has a three pin mains cable so it has a reference to earth (which again is just another arbitrary potential), and I understand that usually the ground clip of the scope probe is shorted internally to the mains safety earth.  Let's suppose I connect that to the (now common) ground bus of my two circuits, so I can measure the signal at some point inside one of them.  The common ground of my two circuits then shifts to equal the earth potential supplied by the mains, right?  And that's just no big deal?

I guess I'm confused because I've read that if you accidentally connect the ground clip of a scope probe to something that's at a high voltage relative to safety earth then you can blow up your scope because you've created a short circuit for that high voltage and you get a whole lot of current flowing.  That's bad.  But I feel like there's no conceptual difference between doing that and connecting the ground clip to the ground rail of something powered by a wallwart, since that ground rail is not at the same potential as safety earth.

Is it just the case that the absolute potential of the ground output of a wallwart is never very far away from your mains earth potential, so you when using your scope to probe equipment with floating ground you're just creating a short circuit across a very low voltage source?

But even if that was the case...when you short the floating ground to safety earth, the potential of the floating ground simply gets pulled up/down to earth and then no current flows (I think).  But when you short some higher potential to safety earth, that potential doesn't drop, it just drives a whole pile of current through your scope until something burns out.  This feels like a quantitative difference in voltage causing a qualitative change in behaviour, which feels counterintuitive.

Does the high voltage not simply get pulled down to safety earth because there's some force acting to actively maintain that potential, whereas the arbitrary potential of the wallwart's ground output can be freely moved around because there's nothing holding it in place?

Sorry for the fairly long and rambling question.  I'm not entirely sure exactly which concepts it is that I'm confused about.  An attempted TL;DR:

* Is it true that floating potentials can simply be pulled up/down to match earth just by shorting them to earth, with no ill effects and no sustained current flow?  If so, how does that work, physics-wise?
* If that is true, what is it that makes that situation different from shorting non-floating potentials?
* If that isn't true, then just what *does* go on when you connect to floating grounds?",theory,False,self,t5_2se13,False,theory,,True,t3_1hjkdt,http://www.reddit.com/r/AskElectronics/comments/1hjkdt/trying_to_wrap_my_head_around_floating_grounds/,

It includes a power supply that's rated 12V DC 2.5A and the label on the speaker indicates the same.  I want to take this radio on the road with me and run it off batteries and currently trying to figure out what I can do.  My only requirement is no SLA because it's too heavy for backpack carry.

I got brief access to a bench top DC power supply and for the most part, at 12V the current stayed between 0.25 to 0.5 amps, occasionally spiking to 1A but that was very rare.  I'd say it was under 0.6A 99% of the time.  

Additionally I figured out that the speaker system automatically shuts off when I dialed the voltage down to 6V.  After it shut off at 6V, I had to remove power to the system and wait a few minutes before I could turn it back on.  At 9V, I didn't notice much, if any, degradation in audio quality and I had it running continuously at maximum volume probably for 20 or 30 minutes at 9V and the current was still around 0.25 to 0.5A most of the time.

What options do I have to power this?  I was thinking either AA NiMH since I have plenty of those, or lithium 18650 but I need to buy those.  For AA, I was thinking I could get 8 in a battery holder since those are more common than 10 cell variety.  I found a few 18650 battery holders also for up to 4 cells.  

Originally I was thinking I would need to use a voltage regulator, but since I can run the speakers on anything from 7 to 14V, I'm thinking I could skip that and just run it straight off the batteries.  If I use 8xAA, the voltage should be around 9.6V nominal and 3x18650 would be around 10.8 to 11.1V but would be 12.6 initially.  For 4x 18650 though, I think I would use a regulator because initial voltage would be 16.8 and then dropping to 14.8.  I did not test above 14V.  I'm leaning towards the NiMH currently because I already have the batteries, and all I really need is a battery holder a plastic case and a few other things like a switch, barrel connector, and a few wires.  I'm thinking for what I'm doing it will be safe to not use a relay.

According to my math from using the bench DC power supply, at 9V and 0.38A (the middle value) that is 3.42W which is the power requirement for the speakers.

My AA batteries are 1.2V and around 1.9Ah.  So 8 of them would be 9.6V and about 18Wh.

So that means the estimated run time is around 5 hours.  I really only want around 3 hours run time.

Does this sound like a reasonable plan and does my math look right?  I'm just concerned why this thing came with a 2.5A power adapter even though the speaker very seldom used more than 0.6A and only for brief and rare instances required 1A.

I am troubleshooting a basement dehumidifier.  I'm 99.8% sure the problem is the motor that runs the fan, but I'm not 100% sure how to independently test the motor independently to be completely sure it is fried.  If it were a DC motor it would be easy, but it's AC and has a lot of wires.  I have about 0 experience working on AC circuits.

The schematic can be seen here:
http://i.imgur.com/I5gRHNf.jpg

So yellow and org go to a cap, which goes to ""Line"".  It looks like Blk is the high speed and red is the low speed.

So, to test the motor, I plugged it into an AC circuit (with breaker and fuse) directly to the blk/yellow lines.  The motor didn't do anything.  So I'm guessing it's bad.

However, when you manually spin the motor, it generates a bit of voltage on the lines I had it connected to.  So, this to me says it *should* be a good motor, since it's working as an AC generator when it's spun.  I should note that a kid helping me was only able to generate almost a volt when spinning it as hard as he could.

How I came to the suspicion that it is this motor:  The dehumidifier would seemingly run normally if it was left off for many hours, but when running it would start up for a few seconds, then cut itself off.  After disassembly, I determined the compressor's thermal protection was kicking in - it was getting HOT, and the blower was never turning on.  I also tried high and low fan speeds.

I then connected my multimeter to the PCB where this fan is connected and found it was supplying 120v when connected to the Black/Yellow lines as I was trying to test.

So, having no experience with AC motors:

That rectangular prism will have about a 1/2in in diameter hole that extends through it for potential wiring et cetera.

Essentially I need to create a circuit that can switch on/off a laser diode but importantly once it is switched off it must send a mouse click or key stroke to begin analysis in the instruments software. It is vitally important that the timing of the turning off / starting analysis sequence is reproducible.

So far what I have done is create a simple toggle switch in a box that actuates one relay that controls the laser diode. That bit works perfectly.

The problem I am having is that it is very difficult to trigger a computer to 'click'. By 'click' I mean short out some contacts and then open them again, not too quickly, not to slowly. I have simply opened some mice and wired connections to the left click microswitch. I then made some brushes that a spring loaded solenoid brushes past momentarily, HOWEVER... just my luck that it actuates TOO quickly and the computer is unable to detect it. Unfortunately, lowering the voltage or current makes it unable to actuate and I have been unable to mechanically manipulate it to be 'slower'.

Current basis of operation:
Toggle switch on: Laser relay closed, power goes to laser driver, trigger solenoid powered and magnetized
Toggle switch off: Laser relay open, no power to laser driver, trigger solenoid in its unpowered position.
Toggle switch transitioning momentarily: Laser relay losing power, driver losing power, trigger solenoid opening because of spring tension and brushing past mouse brushes.

What I do is supply 5V to one row at a time, and supply GND to the LEDs that should be on by supplying 5V to the base pins of the relevant transistors (model is BC547B). Between the transistor and GND is a 220 ohm resistor to limit the current over the LEDs.

I've tested the LEDs by *very briefly* supplying 3.3V to them. All of them lit up, though one or two LEDs seem a bit dim. But this does show that the LEDs aren't the problem. I've verified that there are no shorts, and everything is connected properly (when putting a multimeter across an entire column or row of LEDs, the resistance is shown as ~0. The resistors are all properly connected to the GND wire (resistance shown is between 218 and 221 ohms).

However, when I supply 5V to a single row and a single transistor, nothing lights up. I've tried almost every possible combination of row and column, and nothing lights up.

You have to be careful about what it touches, and they're genderless in a way that allows you to short two batteries together if you accidentally plug them into each other.

So, I'm looking for alternatives.  I need a connector which can carry 10 Amps for 10-15 minutes at a time.  Voltage drop isn't a huge concern, and the connector can get warm as long as it's reliable.  Size needs to be on the order of 1x0.5x0.25 inch for a mated pair.

When first installed (~6 months ago) it worked, but sometimes the AC side 'stopped working' and they'd have to leave it for a bit before using it again. My understanding is that it 'stopped working' more and more often till they gave up on it and swtiched it off. Then I arrived.

Batteries 1 and 4 give no reading with a volt meter. Batteries 2 and 3 give 12v.

Took it to class last night and my prof and I began troubleshooting. He didn't think it was an issue with the converter and so we began looking at the circuit. After some probing and other tests, we found some questionable areas, cleaned up some jumpers, etc. Not sure which one did it, but afterward it worked fine! There must have been something that was improperly grounding or causing something that kept pulling the output down to ~3v.

**[/UPDATE]**

I want to thank everyone for some amazing replies though! I swear sometimes I hope my circuits don't work because I end up learning 10x more by asking questions than if I'd gotten it right the first time.

Sorry I don't have a schematic off hand to show, but basically I've got a DC-DC adjustable step-up converter (Specs below) I'm using to power a PICAXE MCU and L293D (logic supply only) from a single Li-Ion battery. At present, the only thing it's powering is the MCU and L293D. I haven't connected the output supply to the L293D.

I connected the battery to the converter and dialed the output to 5v (+/- .05v). When I connect the output to my circuit though, the voltage drops to ~2.85v.

I realize not much can be formulated w/o looking at my exact circuit, but I'm wondering if there's anything in general that can cause this? As I'm writing this and going over some of the specs though, it is a switching output at 50Hz. I have two capacitors setup across the converter's output: one 1000uF electrolitic and one 100nF ceramic, as well as a 100uF ceramic across the V+/V- on the MCU and L293D. Could this be causing any issues?

Specs:

* Wide Input voltage: 3V-30V

* Output Voltage: 4-35V (Adjustable) 

* Output current: rated current 3A MAX ( Heat-sink Needed)

* Conversion efficiency: Up to 92% (output voltage higher, the higher the efficiency)

* Switching Frequency: 50KHz

* Rectifier: Non-Synchronous Rectification 

* Short circuit protection: current limiting, since the recovery 

* Operating temperature: Industrial grade (-40 ℃ to +85 ℃) (output power 10W or less) 

* Full load temperature rise: 40 ℃

1363038262.0,5,self.AskElectronics,1a3udu,Best way to get +/- 14.5V ?,8,3,12,http://www.reddit.com/r/AskElectronics/comments/1a3udu/best_way_to_get_145v/,"I need the following voltages: 14.5V, +/- c. 15V, 5V, 3.3V. Only the +14.5V needs any significant current (~3A), and getting the lower voltages is no problem- i can do this with cheap linear VRMs.

What is the best (cheapest) way to get the positive/negative along with the uncommon voltage?

1. Use a +/-15V DC power supply, and then use a linear VRM to provide a +14.5V output.

2. Use an adjustable +15V supply at 14.5v and then use a switching inverting VRM to get the negative 14.5v.

3. find an adjustable +/- 15V SMPS

The issue with #1 is that it would require a very low drop-out voltage, and probably need to be adjustable, and would output up to 1.5W heat. As for #2; inverting VRMs are pretty expensive, worse still requiring an adjustable (or -14.5v) one. I've had no luck finding a PS that is adjustable on its inverting rail, either.

This circuit will be used in a battery-powered device so low power consumption is one of my design constraints.  This constraint led me to a non-inverting amplifier topology over the traditional trans-impedance amp.  As I understand it, the main caveat to this approach is sacrificed linearity.  The key to maintaining linearity is to keep the voltage across the photodiode relatively low (~100mV).

Based on the expected light levels, photodiode sensitivity, and A2D voltage range, I computed the gain needed for my circuit: approx 17.  Seems perfectly reasonable for a single stage.  Since I need to operate off a single-supply, I found a Linear Technology part (LT6003) that offers low power consumption and rail-to-rail operation on both inputs and outputs.  The result was this [circuit](http://imgur.com/a/JeCMC).

I simulate the design in PSPICE and things look pretty good.  Next, I breadboarded the design and took some gain measurements from the circuit.  I noticed that gain was rolling off by about 5% at low signal levels.  At this point I went back to the sim to see if I could spot the same behavior.  Much to my surprise, the gain was actually *increasing* by about 5% at low signal levels. Gain plots can be found [here](http://imgur.com/a/JeCMC).

So my questions are, what is causing the disagreement between simulation and the actual implementation?  From what I've heard, the models in LTSpice, particularly the ones for Linear Tech components, tend to be fairly high fidelity.

I've also tried to do a reasonable job of matching the impedance ""seen"" by the opamp at both its input terminals but the simulation indicates that the circuit isn't too sensitive to changes in input impedance.

Any advice would be appreciated!
