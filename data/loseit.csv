About 2.5 years ago, I was 23 years old and weighing in at 350 lbs on a 6' frame. Sitting in the office of a weight loss specialist, she only offered up one recommendation: weight loss surgery. I kind of panicked at that point. I was 23 years old, a PhD student, and full of questions. That was a defining moment in my life process. I had the setback of a severely broken foot that required two surgeries and an extended healing process. Towards the end of the healing process, I heard about a local pool that offered water aerobics and thought it would be a good way to start moving towards exercise without being high impact on my foot. After the first class, I realized that water aerobics just wasn't my style. I decided to return to the pool during open swim to try out laps. I was nervous and rocking a ridiculous leopard print halter top one piece because it was the only swimwear I had. At the beginning, it was all I could do to get one length of the pool (25 yards) completed at a time. And this is where I started. I swam as much as I could each day and loved every minute of it. I have found that swimming is very therapeutic in a lot of ways - physically and mentally. At the same time, I started using the myfitnesspal website and app. I was very careful and obsessive about the calories for a long time. The pounds didn't come off quickly at first and this was very discouraging, but gradually, the weight loss began to show. I have since found myself able to swim for two hours with minimal stops for goggle adjustments and I have also incorporated land exercises - biking, elliptical, and revolving stairs - into my workout schedule. I am now committed to working out 6 days a week, eating healthy, and just being a genuinely healthy person. The BMI calculator says that I've still got about 25 lbs to go, but I'm at the point where I've done a good thing for myself and anything else is just super!

Lifestyle change begins 01/2012

I think there are few words that feel as ugly and awkward as the word obese. Its the kind of word that always follows a sympathetic pause in the presence of the paunchy. It is so round and clinical and weighted down with taciturn lowness that it clings to a person in a way that squeezes and cripples him with what is simultaneously the most formidable and and the most elementary malady for a person to beat. January 5, marked one year since I resolved to change myself.This essay will probably be the most gushing and candid thing I’ve ever written, parts of this may seem attention seeking or boastful but I promise that this comes from the deepest, most sincere, and thought-worn parts of my heart. Its something I’ve had kicking around in my head for the better part of 15 years; this is the eulogy for my obesity.


Size has always dominated me, I began to chub around the fourth grade. I wouldn’t say that I was by any means a too-sad kid but I do think that feeling sad was a trigger for me. As a kid I had a difficult time finding a place where I felt like I was supposed to be. Whenever I would venture a try at something new, I would inevitably leave inadequate. I would feel bitter about being rejected by girls or I would feel sad about not being able to keep up with boys. In response I withdrew and went to food. As I grew up, I never felt right and I never I had anything that was mine with which to excel…I would fantasize about accomplishment and taking ownership of the kind of charisma and strength that would enamour me to those girls and make myself a hero in the minds of those guys, but I had lost so much ground over time that the idea of changing anything was daunting. It felt like my life was looming over me and I used food and humor as a means to swat it.


Gaining weight was mostly gradual with a few sharp spikes. It went on slowly until one day I realized that I was a fat kid and at once the idea got stuck in my head. I remember this feeling of compliance like:""well, this is me now."" As I grew older and boundaries widened, I became heavier. I would ride my bike to the Meijer on Clyde Park when it had a McDonalds in it and I would eat a Double Quarter meal Super-Sized and a twenty-piece chicken nuggets, turn around and ride home. This secret meal would lay on top of everything else I eaten during the day and I would enjoy it with stealth in my mind. It didn’t help that I was also slow to develop socially; I didn't have friends yet and food became music for me. It entertained and occupied me. I would go to movies by myself (which I loved doing) I would devour my lonely popcorn and inhale my propitious Pepsi. With every little bit of freedom I enjoyed, my weight gain would apex and level off. When I got my first job (at a pizza joint) I had tons of free food and money to spend on whatever I liked, when I got my license I could travel farther for different brands and combinations of fast food. Every bit of independance further cemented my habits.


Eventually I did develop a bit of a social lean but I still had a hard time accepting myself to my peers, I always felt like my stature stood between us. For example, one year we went to Michigan Adventure, I hadn’t thought much about the seat in a roller coaster and and never had a problem with a lap bar, but then I got in line for The Corkscrew. We waited eagerly and when the time came I walked up to the cart and looked inside and I thought ""shit."" I sat down next to a friend and it was tight but we were both able to sit. I reach up to pull down the shoulder harness and it wouldn’t click. My chest is too far from my back to get the harness to lock. I want to get out but instead an employee comes to me and tries to help by pressing it into me while I 'suck it in' No dice. I stood up and walked away with all the eyes on my back. I held the ride up and I was that fat kid that didn’t fit so I watched my friends ride the coaster from the sidewalk. It was the first time my size made me feel t isolated in front of someone. My attitude was to quietly tack roller coasters on to a list of things I couldn’t do. Eventually I out grew movie theater seats, airplane seats, and ‘Big &amp; Tall’ sections in the mall and I passively waved goodbye to all of them.


And time just passed by - I built powerful, lasting, and comfortable relationships. I worked and had fun but never really achieved anything. I had quiet goals but all of the things I wanted for myself came to be plain conversational fodder, things you get drunk and dream about out loud. Everything I wanted was so public and everything I was was so private. I wanted to act and I wanted to be a comedian. I did open mics and it left me disgusted and exposed, it was a sort of exhilarating misery that kept you facing the goals you pushed away. I gradually lost momentum and just sort of stalled. Life for a few years was like a room dimly lit by the flickering light of a TV. It was quiet, and private, and comfortable. I remained stealthily obsessed with food. It occupied my mind. The flavors and textures and that feeling of occupation in your core gave me a sense of contentment that was so durable that it became ever-present in my life.


I haven’t always lacked a sense of the need for change. Periodically, I would have manic bouts of conviction and backbone. I would face the world and strive to be social, and better, and healthy. I would purse comedy again, I joined gyms, I sought and gained relationships...complacency though eventually had me back in my room eroding from a habit bordering agoraphobia. Eventually I realized that I wasn’t the possessor friends I once was and I became aware of the cheerlessness I felt for myself and that revealed to me the delicacy of the relationships I had. I was pushing people away from me so that I could revel in my faults. I began to see the folly and futility of so many of the years behind me. I became morbidly mindful of my mortality; I would imagine a roommate finding me dead and how they would react. How my family would react. In that, I realized that I’d lived so absent mindedly for so long that I had become OK with being dead when I was 40 and had subconsciously planned to be alone and idle for whatever time I had left. I’d let indulgence and apathy become intuitive.


A dramatic shift in my mindset came to pass around summer 2011. It was also around this time that I, as none of my friends or family knew, auditioned for a weight loss reality show. On the show, overweight men and women are taken away to a fitness sanctuary where they are taught healthy habits and exercise and exercise and exercise ... it was much like a real-life adult version of the movie Heavyweights. While gone, participants don’t communicate with family or friends and then, after an agonizing and heart lifting episode is complete, they are revealed to friends and family in a new body and attitude. I wanted to be a part of that show and thought I had it. I was interviewed and inline to be a part of the show when, abruptly, the series was put on hold and the new season never materialized.

I was devastated. I had poured my future into this idea that I could be taken away and fixed. That I was going to leave and come back as a new person for everyone to hold up cheer for. I had built up tremendous optimism and lost it all just as quickly. I went right back onto the destructive beat I had just left. Looking back, not making it on that show broke something for me and pushed me to get bad enough that I could get better.


Fortunately it only took about six months, I grieved the loss of my spotlight and my champion transformative moment and during that time reflected soulfully about who I am to the people in my life, who I am to myself, and most importantly recognized that I have it in myself to become the kind of person I want to be: I want to constantly be aware of my potential. I want to be a man that knows and practices right from wrong. I want to modestly inspire goodness, optimism, and effort in people; I want my integrity and my character to be something worth holding up. I want to be external and in the lives of people and I want people to feel that having me in their lives is a thing of value. In order to realize these things I had to accept accountability for what had misrepresented my capability and demeaned my resolve for so long. It wasn’t my weight, it was my attitude about life and an enduring lack of enthusiasm for the future.


I took responsibility for my well being one year ago, I weighed 420 pounds, I wore a XXXXXL dress shirt and 48 jeans. My life and the way I lived it literally changed overnight and hasn’t stumbled. I began by eating a calorie restricted diet and eventually shifted to focus on lower carbohydrates. For exercise I started by walking three miles a day. I would take the bus to school, get off walk a ways and get back on further down the route. Once spring rolled around I began to bike. Those rides progressed from two, to six, to ten mile rides, mostly to and from school. Soon the distance between school and home wasn’t clear or long enough so riding became a purposeful thing rather than utility. I rode and rode. By the end of the summer I had joined the half century club having ridden over fifty miles in one ride. In August I began running using the Couch to 5k program and ran my first full 5k on November 17 and putted along to finish my first 10k on December 15. As of today I have lost 178 pounds, wear a large and 34 jeans. I am stronger and faster than I’ve ever felt myself be. I feel appreciation and optimism in everything that I do and I sense that this is the way life should feel. I’ve still got a lot of work to do but at this point the habits have rooted and the education that I’ve gained over the last year will nurture them. I cannot see my life going backwards, this is who I was always supposed to be.


I’ve spent most of my life planning and daydreaming without action and now everything seems so attainable.This is why I write today, I’m ready to say goodbye to that old life now and to focus on maintaining goal oriented momentum and pushing harder so that the strength in my musings becomes the strength in my character. I can do better, I can do better. I can be the Greatest Man in the World.


Thank you to Mom, my Dad, Jerry, My brothers Eric and Adam, Jessica, Marshall, Corey, Colby; you guys specifically have given me clarity and always been frank with be about delicate things. And to Britt, Allen, Jen, Margie, and Alex, you guys give me the happiness I need to suck it up and do it. This might all seem overly sentimental but I only plan on doing this once and you’ve changed my life in ways that can’t really make sense to you.


Part of the audition process for the reality show I mentioned was to create a series of videos focusing on different aspects of my life. I edited one of them and am keeping a few private, but as for the rest, I don’t see a reason to keep it closeted anymore, I feel like that person is gone now. I uploaded these in May 2011, until now it has been accessible only to the producers of the show. For those interested, I have the links listed below. I think they are a thought-provoking relic.

Basically I just stopped eating quite so much, made sure a bit more of it was healthy and was slightly more physically active ... that lost me the first 30 or so pounds. Since then, it's been proper serving sizes, counting calories (without depriving myself) and exercise a couple of times a week.

I won't bore you with the sob story, but my life experience with weight is fairly typical. Basically, normal sized through most of childhood, got bigger in teenaged years, and then REALLY put on weight in college (like 200 lbs in four years). Anyway, I promised myself that once I finished my Ph. D, I'd get serious about my weight. Once I became ABD, I figured I'd better make good on my promise to my body.

Anyway, after my first real medical examination in years (once you pass a certain point in your weight, you DO NOT want to go to a doctor's) I learned my actual weight. 492 lbs. Honestly, I was happy, since I expected it to be over 500. Additionally, my blood work was impeccable: not diabetic, cholesterol was normal, EKG was perfect, and even my blood pressure was dang good for a person of any size, let alone a galoot such as myself. 

However, I knew my relatively good health wasn't promised forever, especially at that weight. I know the life expectancy for big guys, it's not pretty, and I'd like to be able to see my niece grow up, maybe even have some kids of my own. With the beginning of the new year, I put my plan into action

The main thing was changing my diet. I downloaded the Myfitnesspal app and started religiously tracking my calories. (Be friends with me! My name on it is ""stutully"") After a couple days of seeing my regular eating habits, I figured out where to make changes. For the most part, I eat a small 200-300 calorie ""meal"" every two hours or so. These meals are very basic, like oatmeal or a kale shake. I keep my calorie intake at 2000 calories, and don't allow myself to cheat. Although it might stink passing up a slice of pizza or going out with friends to get wings, my logic is passing up on it now will allow for me to enjoy it for years, if not decades later. 

As for exercise, I put in about 30-45 minutes six days a week doing weights and cardio. It was hard for me to work out at first, especially in the early days with the calorie adjustment, but after a month or so, I was fine. Additionally, I've begun taking regularly nightly walks that last about 30 minutes or so, a habit I've never had before.

So in almost 5 months, I've dropped 94 lbs. I know I have plenty more to go. (I like to say I'm now just ""fat"" instead of ""hugely fat"") Regardless of the amount of weight left I have to lose, I am proud of what I've accomplished so far. Also, if I can do it, ANYONE can.

TL;DR: Fat guy, who's still has lots to lose, loses 94 lbs in under 5 months with boring old calorie counting and exercise. ",,False,,t5_2rz8w,1369851350.0,,95lbs,True,t3_1f9ze2,http://www.reddit.com/r/loseit/comments/1f9ze2/im_probably_the_happiest_person_ever_to_see_a_3/,

I made the financial commitment and I was going to do the program.. and I was going to do it right..  In the first month I followed the plan religiously..  and lost 28 lbs..

Here's a before and after..   and trust me.. I really hate looking at these so this pains me..

http://i.imgur.com/Z7QGi.jpg

Shortly after the first month,  I was still bitter that I spent the money, so out of spite, I quit Isagenix and was totally motivated to educate myself and do it properly..   and so I started a Paleo diet..   I'll give Isagenix a bit of a complement here..   Because I had consumed so much liquid and wasn't filling my belly with food all the time.   My stomach shrank..  I could not consume the meals I was eating before.  So this really helped in the months following.

Another 6 weeks after quitting Isagenix and starting Paleo, I was down another 22 lbs..

Here's me shortly after losing 50..  This still pains me cause I hate how I let myself get too far..

At about this point,  my back was starting to feel way better.  Not perfect..  just better..  So I started walking..  maybe 2k a day perhaps..  but this was strenuous..  I would get in sweating..   When that started to become easier..  Around this time one of my MFP pals LeanerBeef posted a challenge about running a 30-35 min 5k..  He didn't know it.. But i'm friggen super competitive..  so I signed up for a 5k, started the c25k running program and never looked back.  I ran the 5k in something like 32 mins..  When I started c25k.. I was doing it in 45 - 50 mins..

Right before this race I had discovered Saucony running shoes.. and they were the most damn comfortable shoes, I have ever worn..  at this point it was fate..  I was to become a runner..  I've put over 500 kms on my shoes.

I've now run 2 - 5ks,  1 - 10k..  and my absolute favorite race.. The Spartan Run..

Me the day before the spartan run..  Down 85lbs..

http://i.imgur.com/jumY4.jpg

Today I still maintain a Paleo diet..  probably a little more lax than I used to be..  I run 20-30 kms a week.. and go to the gym at least once a week.. but i try for 2, and soooooometimes 3..

I don't really log food much anymore but I still log exercise and weigh myself religiously..  If I find i'm up,  I go back to logging food religiously..  After a year, you get used to smaller portions,  you know what's good for you..  you can tell when you don't feel right..

 I've watched people lose large #'s in the past year..   and I've seen people who don't lose #'s, but daaaaamn they look smexy cause their body composition has changed big time..   

This journey was more mental, than physical.    Don't make excuses people.  This is totally do-able.   Everyone has time.  Don't give me that bull****, I don't have time excuse.  Make time.. It's your life.  We've become too lazy and make too many excuses..   Your body was meant to have motion.   MOVE that body..  

Anyways here are some most recent pictures..  

down 113 lbs..
down from a 5xl tshirt to an xl..
down from a 44 waist to a 34 waist.
up from 0 pushups to 12 pushups..
up from 0 crunches to 50 crunches.
up from 10 sec plank to 1 1/2 minute plank.
up from running 5 seconds to running 59 minutes..

1 year..   That's all it took..  and my life is completely different..  You forget how fast it goes..   I can't thank my MFP friends enough for the help and motivation that they have given me..   I also want to thank my close friends who joined me on this journey..  Their success has made me extremely happy..

Yes, you. The one feigning to not see me when we cross paths on the running track. The one not even wearing sports gear, breathing heavy. You’re slow, you breathe hard and your efforts at moving forward make you cringe.  

You cling shyly to the furthest corridor, sometimes making larger loops on the gravel ring by the track just so you’re not on it. You sweat so much that your hair is all wet. You rarely stay for more than 20 minutes at a time, and you look exhausted when you leave to go back home. You never talk to anyone. I’ve got something I’d like to say to you.  

You are awesome. If you’d look me in the eye only for an instant, you would notice the reverence and respect I have for you. The adventure you have started is tremendous; it leads to a better health, to renewed confidence and to a brand new kind of freedom. The gifts you will receive from running will far exceed the gigantic effort it takes you to show up here, to face your fears and to bravely set yourself in motion, in front of others.  

You have already begun your transformation. You no longer accept this physical state of numbness and passivity. You have taken a difficult decision, but one that holds so much promise. Every hard breath you take is actually a tad easier than the one before, and every step is ever so slightly lighter. Each push forward leaves the former person you were in your wake, creating room for an improved version, one that is stronger, healthier and forward-looking, one who knows that anything is possible.  

You’re a hero to me. And, if you’d take off the blaring headphones and put your head up for more than a second or two, you would notice that the other runners you cross, the ones that probably make you feel so inadequate, stare in awe at your determination. They, of all people, know best where you are coming from. They heard the resolutions of so many others, who vowed to pick up running and improve their health, “starting next week”. Yet, it is YOU who runs alongside, who digs from deep inside to find the strength to come here, and to come back again.  

You are a runner, and no one can take that away from you. You are relentlessly moving forward. You are stronger than even you think, and you are about to be amazed by what you can do. One day, very soon, maybe tomorrow, you’ll step outside and marvel at your capabilities. You will not believe your own body, you will realize that you can do this. And a new horizon will open up for you. You are a true inspiration.  

I bow to you.

In 2009, I had 195lbs on my 5'6"" frame. I was really uncomfortable wearing a bikini, I secretly ate huge amounts of foods, and I was almost entirely sedentary. 

Over the course of 2010, I made a radical shift in diet and exercise level. I personally used the [Body for Life program](http://www.bodyforlife.com) to initially re-educate myself on how to move and how much/what to eat. I dropped 25 lbs in the first three months. Now, I do various exercises to stay fit, keeping myself from getting bored by trying different classes (yoga, boxing, jump rope, whatever) and eating with awareness of my body. I never eat until it hurts anymore. I try to check in with myself and make sure I'm hungry before I go for a snack. I drink a lot of water. 

I've flirted with keto, paleo, and a few other diets. I've made progress with them in the short term, but have found that long-term, a little bit of everything in moderation works for me. Whole natural foods fill me up the best and keep me bouncy, so I tend to gravitate towards them. I like to dance, so any exercise that involves music is sure to appeal to me. 

Ultimately, just taking an interest in my physical health and making it part of my daily routine has been the biggest life-altering gift I could have given myself.

FAQ:

**How old are you?**

23 

**How tall are you?**

5'10''

**What made you decide to do lose the weight?**

I really, really, really want to be a United States Marine. It is something I've been wanting to do for a very long time. Now I'm very close to finally getting the chance to earn my Eagle, Globe, and Anchor. I can't wait!

**What do your work outs consist of?**

The way I lost the first 100 pounds was by doing cardio for at least an hour a day. Cardio Cardio Cardio. I used the elliptical machine the most. Now I run 3 to 5 miles a day and still do the elliptical machine for 30 minutes afterwards. I'm also weight training, although I'm finding it hard to build muscle with the little amount of food I eat daily. Whey protein helps though!

**What's your diet like?**

I'm trying to lose another 5 to 10 pounds at the moment so I'm eating very little. Whey Protein after my work out in the morning, bowl of cereal for breakfast, 2 homemade chicken wraps for lunch, another bowl of cereal for dinner. I'm probably on a 1500 calorie daily deficit. I know, I know. That's insane. I wouldn't recommend anyone do this unless you know your body can take it and you have the mental toughness to go hungry from the moment you wake up to the time you go to sleep. Do I have cheat meals once a week to keep me sane? Absolutely! I usually make myself a cheeseburger or 2 at home on Saturdays.

**Best advise I can give someone about losing weight?**

Don't quit. Don't you ever quit. You only fail if you quit and give up. As long as you don't quit, you will succeed. I promise you that. 

Look, losing weight is hard. If it was easy, everyone would do it and we wouldn't have a weight problem in this country. Will you stumble and fall throughout your weight loss journey? Yes. Plateaus are a bitch. You work and work and the number on the scale doesn't go down. That will seriously kick your confidence down a ton. And you will cheat on your diet for a day or even a whole week but as long as you get right back to it ASAP you will be fine. Learn to forgive yourself.

This wasn't my first attempt at losing weight. I had been trying to lose weight since I was 14 after being overweight for as long as I could remember. What was different this time than all those other attempts? I didn't quit after things got hard or made mistakes on my diet. I kept on going. That's what made the difference.

Four years ago, on April 12th 2009, I went to a restaurant for my friend's birthday and saw the most beautiful woman I've seen in my entire life. She was not only pretty, she seemed to be a genuine good person. When I saw her I realized that a fat slob like I was would never be able to be with such a beautiful woman. That's the day it all changed. 


I was 370 pounds, I started eating healthier and running at LEAST 1 hour a day. Holy shit was it hard at first but it did not matter. 

One of my friend is a personal trainer and he was more than happy to help me get started, so I began going to the gym 6 days a week + going for a run every morning before work. 


That same friend had me meet one of his friend who helped me on the food front. What to eat, what to not eat, I kept eating pretty much everything I ate before, just less but it was more on the healthy side. I was allowed a cheat day, the day I didn't go to the gym, because let's be honest... if I was that fat it's because I fucking enjoy eating right? Can't take everything away all at once! I stopped doing the cheat day maybe a year in because I couldn't get myself to eat such nasty shit anymore, it didn't taste as good as most of the healthy stuff anyway.


Two years later, 180 pounds down, healthy, fit, I went to the same restaurant after dinner service to see if she was still working there to tell her how she changed my life. She was. I told her I needed to talk to her once she was done. I waited outside for roughly 30 mins when she came out.


I explained her everything and how she changed my life. She started crying and said nobody ever said something like that to her and she gave me the longest hug.


Two years after, we're still together and I don't regret a single thing I did leading to this point in my life. She is my perfect woman and I could not be happier. I'm living a dream.

**Understand Hormone Signaling to Understand Why You’re Packing on the Fat**

* **Insulin** – Insulin is a hormone. It signals to your body that glucose needs to be stored. Insulin is released in response to glucose entering the blood stream. ALL carbohydrates(sugar, whole grain, complex, and simple) are broken down into glucose. Your body releases insulin in direct proportion to the volume of glucose in your blood. Glucose needs to be either burned as fuel, stored in the liver and muscles, or stored as fat. High levels of glucose in the bloodstream is toxic to the body.

&gt;Insulin stops the use of fat as an energy source by inhibiting the release of glucagon. With the exception of the metabolic disorder diabetes mellitus and metabolic syndrome, insulin is provided within the body in a constant proportion to remove excess glucose from the blood, which otherwise would be toxic. – Wiki

Low-carb diets like the ketogenic diet are the gold-standard for losing fat. Low-carb diets by definition limit the amount of glucose entering your bloodstream thereby eliminate blood sugar(glucose) spikes. This mediation of blood glucose then eliminates large insulin spikes.

With our new understanding of insulin it is easy to see why the average person eating a standard Western diet has weight issues. Most of their meals consist at least 100g of fast-digesting carbohydrates made up of breads, pastas, and flours: pizza, burger buns, sandwiches(subway is a terrible choice for weight loss), pasta sides, sugary cereal, and sugary soft-drinks.


These processed carbohydrates are easier for our digestive system to break down and thus introduce glucose into our bloodstream faster and at higher volumes than carbohydrate rich vegetables and fruits. It requires nine cups of strawberries to equal the sugar content of one 20 oz soda. As we learned earlier, high levels of glucose is toxic to the body, so our bodies must do something with it. Glucose stored in the liver and muscles are used during exercise. If these stores are depleted then blood glucose is shuttled to these stores(muscle and liver) before it is stored in fat- this is good. This explains why nutrition and fitness experts recommend eating your large portions of carbohydrates only after exercise.

The problem for most Westerners is that their carbohydrate consumption is completely out of balance with their physical activity level. I am a very active man and I only need an average of 150g of carbohydrates per day to keep my muscle and liver glycogen levels full. The average westerner consumes on average 300g of carbohydrates per day. And they don’t exercise. With every meal they are storing glucose as fat. With every meal they are releasing a hormone into their body that inhibits their body’s ability to use fat as energy. And then you get to listen to them whine about how hard it is to lose weight.

Type 2 Diabetes is a direct result of our standard Western diet’s effect on insulin.

&gt;When you have type 2 diabetes, your fat, liver, and muscle cells do not respond correctly to insulin. This is called insulin resistance. As a result, blood sugar does not get into these cells to be stored for energy. – PubMed

If you have eaten a high carbohydrate diet for all of your life it is likely that you are insulin resistant to some degree. Insulin resistance causes lethargy, fat gain, and will eventually lead to type two diabetes. I’ll show you how you can easily reverse all of this with a few simple steps later in this article.

The final piece of the insulin puzzle are its effects on your hunger and energy levels. Think “sugar crash.” You eat something high in sugar, feel manic and are filled with frenetic energy for half an hour, and then your energy levels plummet. You’re left feeling lethargic and moody. Your brain personified would look like a foggy night in London. This is because the high carbohydrate meal you just ate flooded your blood with glucose. Your body responded accordingly by releasing high levels of insulin. While the glucose was still in your blood-stream you had high levels of energy but insulin is a very efficient hormone and quickly transports the glucose to your liver, muscles, and fat cells. Insulin is so efficient infact that large insulin responses will leave you with too-little glucose in your bloodstream. This then signals to your body that you need immediate energy and you will feel sharp cravings for more high carbohydrate foods. A vicious cycle.

* **Leptin** – Leptin a hormone that tells your body that you are full. It counteracts other hormones which tell your body to feed. Leptin is released in large quantities when you eat fats and proteins and in lesser quantities when you eat carbohydrates.

&gt;Leptin acts on receptors in the hypothalamus of the brain, where it inhibits appetite

&gt; * counteracting the effects of neuropeptide Y (a potent feeding 

&gt; * stimulant secreted by cells in the gut and in the hypothalamus)

&gt; * counteracting the effects of anandamide (another potent feeding stimulant that binds to the same receptors as THC)

&gt; * promoting the synthesis of α-MSH, an appetite suppressant. – Wiki

Fats and proteins cause significantly more leptin to be released than carbohydrates. Just think about a typical standard breakfast. You can eat pancakes all day. But how many plates of bacon and sausage could you eat before you started to feel sick?

The added satiety afforded by fats and proteins because of leptin is an essential weapon in your war against fat. You can “diet” without feeling starved all day. You can shed fat effortlessly while eating your favorite foods- like bacon!

When we don’t have blood sugar crashes that are caused by insulin spikes we won’t crave sugars and carbohydrates. When we eat meals that are high in fat and protein we stay satiated all day.

* **Cortisol** – Cortisol is a hormone that tells your body to release energy(stored in fat cells). Cortisol is naturally highest in the morning, but is also release when the body is under stress- mental or physical.

Cortisol is very beneficial when it is in balance. However, most of us do not have healthy levels of cortisol due to our high-stress modern lifestyle. Elevated cortisol, like insulin, can wreak havoc in your body. Elevated levels of cortisol actually leads to weight gain and a resistance to fat-loss(especially visceral and belly fat).

If you have a layer of belly fat that you just can’t seem to lose no matter what you try then it is almost certain that you have chronically elevated cortisol.

&gt; Sustained high cortisol levels are dangerous because they:

&gt; * Slow down healing and normal cell regeneration.
&gt; * Co-opt parent molecules needed to make other vital hormones
&gt; * Impair digestion, metabolism and mental function
&gt; * Interfere with healthy endocrine function
&gt; * Weaken your immune system – Source

Cortisol also counteracts the effects of insulin and conversely insulin counteracts the effects of cortisol. Therefore we want to minimize our insulin levels in the morning to take full advantage of the enhanced fat metabolism caused by our naturally high cortisol levels.

When we eat we want our cortisol to be at a low point so our bodies can efficiently store our nutrients in our muscles(because some insulin is good, without it we could never put on any mass, and bodybuilders have for years been injecting themselves with insulin before meals in order to gain weight faster).

So then it makes sense to eat our big meals later in the day when our cortisol have dropped off naturally. In following this regime we take advantage of the high fat burning power of cortisol in the mornings and let our bodies repair and replenish in the afternoon/evenings.

* **HGH** – HGH or human growth hormone is vital to the repair of our bodies. Studies show that fasting greatly enhances our body’s natural production of HGH.

&gt; “Fasting causes hunger or stress. In response, the body releases more cholesterol, allowing it to utilize fat as a source of fuel, instead of glucose. This decreases the number of fat cells in the body,” says Dr. Horne. “This is important because the fewer fat cells a body has, the less likely it will experience insulin resistance, or diabetes.”

&gt; This recent study also confirmed earlier findings about the effects of fasting on human growth hormone (HGH), a metabolic protein. HGH works to protect lean muscle and metabolic balance, a response triggered and accelerated by fasting. During the 24-hour fasting periods, HGH increased an average of 1,300 percent in women, and nearly 2,000 percent in men. - ScienceDaily

Increasing our body’s natural output of growth hormone will help you shed fat AND gain muscle. You’ll even wake up feeling more refreshed after a night’s sleep.

A side-note about growth hormone and alcohol: Never go to bed with alcohol in your system. Alcohol deprives your body of the restorative properties of HGH. Alcohol can decrease the secretion of HGH during sleep by as much as 70%.

**To Recap the Hormones**

* Insulin – Released when you eat carbohydrates. Too much insulin causes fat gain.
* Leptin – Tells your brain that you’re full. Proteins and fats release more leptin than carbohydrates.
* Cortisol – Your body’s “stress hormone.” Naturally highest in the morning. Excessive cortisol causes metabolic problems and stubborn belly and visceral fat.
* HGH – Repairs the body. Fasting causes increased HGH production. Alcohol inhibits HGH production.

**Now We Understand the Science but How do we Take Advantage of it?**

* **Intermittent Fasting** - Popularized by Martin Berkhan on his website www.leangains.com. Martin has a very clear and concise guide written here. I will cover only the main points in this post.

The main idea is that by fasting for 12 to 16 hours a day we create beneficial hormonal changes within our body(remember that fasting for 24 hours caused a rise in growth hormone of 2,000%). Not flooding your body with insulin throughout the day is the greatest benefit for fat loss that comes with intermittent fasting. The average Westerner rides a rollercoaster of high blood sugar followed by high insulin. Which then drops them into a catatonic state of low blood sugar until their next meal- which sends them right back up to the crest of their glucose/insulin high. Compare this to someone following an intermittent fasting style of eating: they will have steady blood sugar and almost no insulin response for 16 hours out of the day. Even if they choose to eat large portions of processed carbohydrates they are still subjecting their body to only 4 to 8 hours of an insulin roller coaster as compared to the all-day insulin rush caused by “normal” diets.

&gt; Insulin resistance is currently a major health problem. This may be because of a marked decrease in daily physical activity during recent decades combined with constant food abundance. This lifestyle collides with our genome, which was most likely selected in the late Paleolithic era (50,000–10,000 BC) by criteria that favored survival in an environment characterized by fluctuations between periods of feast and famine. The theory of thrifty genes states that these fluctuations are required for optimal metabolic function. We mimicked the fluctuations in eight healthy young men [25.0 ± 0.1 yr (mean ± SE); body mass index: 25.7 ± 0.4 kg/m2] by subjecting them to intermittent fasting every second day for 20 h for 15 days. Euglycemic hyperinsulinemic (40 mU·min−1·m−2) clamps were performed before and after the intervention period. Subjects maintained body weight (86.4 ± 2.3 kg; coefficient of variation: 0.8 ± 0.1%). Plasma free fatty acid and β-hydroxybutyrate concentrations were 347 ± 18 and 0.06 ± 0.02 mM, respectively, after overnight fast but increased (P &lt; 0.05) to 423 ± 86 and 0.10 ± 0.04 mM after 20-h fasting, confirming that the subjects were fasting. Insulin-mediated whole body glucose uptake rates increased from 6.3 ± 0.6 to 7.3 ± 0.3 mg·kg−1·min−1 (P = 0.03), and insulin-induced inhibition of adipose tissue lipolysis was more prominent after than before the intervention (P = 0.05). After the 20-h fasting periods, plasma adiponectin was increased compared with the basal levels before and after the intervention (5,922 ± 991 vs. 3,860 ± 784 ng/ml,P = 0.02). This experiment is the first in humans to show that intermittent fasting increases insulin-mediated glucose uptake rates, and the findings are compatible with the thrifty gene concept. – Journal of Applied Physiology

To put all that science talk in simple terms: fasting reduces insulin resistance. This is good.

Intermittent fasting is much easier to follow psychologically than other calorie restricting diets. Eating six small-meals consisting of 400 calories each will leave you feeling unsatiated and craving more . Compare the small frequent meals to the psychological effect of taking a post workout shake of 400 calories and then eating a meal that consists of 2,000 calories. You’ll be physically AND psychologically satiated with the latter and not feel at all deprived even though with both protocols you ate only 2400 calories in the day.

It is also difficult to overeat when in a 4-8 hour feeding period- especially if those meals are high in fat and protein. Meals high in fat and protein will cause large quantities of leptin to be released and thus leave you feeling full and satisfied.  IF really is a “diet” protocol where you can reach your body composition goals by eating massive and satisfying meals.

When you are following an intermittent fasting protocol the best time to eat is after your workout. Remember that our body will prioritize glucose for the liver and muscles before the glucose is stored as fat. Therefore by eating your carbohydrate dense meals after your workouts the glucose you consume will first be prioritized by the body to repair and replenish your muscles.

It is best to break your fast past noon. This lets your body take advantage of the natural rise in cortisol in the morning which will allow you to mobilize fat for energy. Working out in this fasted state promotes high fat loss. It takes a few weeks to get used to working out in a fasted state but you will experience no detrimental effects on performance once you do get used to working out in a fasted state.

**My schedule:**

* 0500 – Wakeup
* 0530 – Cup of green tea – With no honey, we don’t want any insulin response from glucose interfering with our natural cortisol.
* 1600 – Fasted workout – I sometimes snack on almonds and small pieces of fruit during the day, but nothing more than 100 calories per serving. Ideally I would workout around noon and eat my first meal around 1300. But this is not feasible because of my full-time job.
* 1730 – Post Workout shake – 700 to 1000 calories, 50% fat, 30% protein, 20% carbohydrates from fruit
* 1930 – Meal – 1500-2000 calories, large portion of meat(around 16ozs) with veggies and fruits as sides. Generally macros break down into 40-60% fat, 20-40% protein, and 10-30% carbohydrates.
* 2300 – Bed – Arnold says we only need six hours of sleep. Listen to Arnold.

**Nutritional Strategies to Maximize Fat Loss**

We’ve talked about how the foods you eat effect your hormones and when the optimal time for eating is. In this section we’ll cover different nutritional strategies that can help you achieve maximal fat loss.

* **The Ketogenic Diet**

If your goal is to lose as much fat as quickly as you can then The Ketogenic Diet is your answer.

&gt; The ketogenic diet is a high-fat, adequate-protein, low-carbohydrate diet that in medicine is used primarily to treat difficult-to-control (refractory) epilepsy in children. The diet forces the body to burn fats rather than carbohydrates. Normally, the carbohydrates contained in food are converted into glucose, which is then transported around the body and is particularly important in fueling brain function. However, if there is very little carbohydrate in the diet, the liver converts fat into fatty acid sand ketone bodies. The ketone bodies pass into the brain and replace glucose as an energy source. An elevated level of ketone bodies in the blood, a state known as ketosis, leads to a reduction in the frequency of epileptic seizures.[1]

The keto diet is perfectly safe for those without epilepsy. When your caloric intake is less than your expenditure on  a “normal” diet- one which is balanced in fats, proteins, and carbohydrates(40% carbs, 40% protein, 20% fats) your body goes into a state of gluconeogenesis. Gluconeogenesis is a process where your liver converts proteins into glucose. If you are cutting on a “normal, balanced” diet your body will actively convert your precious muscle tissue into glucose in order to fuel the body’s vital functions. This is bad.

When you follow the ketogenic diet your macro breakdown looks like this: 55-65% fat, 25-35% protein, less than 5% carbohydrates. Eating in this manner consistently will cause your body to shift from burning glucose as its primary fuel source to burning fat as its primary fuel source. A person on a ketogenic diet will not experience gluconeogenesis. Rather than converting protein to glucose the body will directly tap fat cells to fuel its energy requirements.

This is exactly what we’re going for. Now instead of burning our precious muscle tissue our body directly burns our fat stores when we eat a caloric deficit.

I’ve cut with every diet out there. For me I lost 50% muscle and 50% fat when cutting on a traditional 40/40/20 diet. My strength in the gym dropped 5% each month. When I switched over to a keto diet my strength actually increased week over week and my weight loss was almost 100% fat. Not only did I preserve muscle, but I lost bodyfat 25% faster on the keto diet as compared to the 40/40/20 diet. AND it was easier to follow. The high fat and protein intake left me feeling full and satiated.

**Where your calories should come from:**

* Fat – Avocados, coconut oil, olive oil, fish, grass-fed animals, almonds, macadamia nuts, almond butter, coconut butter, grass-fed butter, free-range eggs. Avoid - Too much farm-raised animal fat, peanuts, vegetable oils, trans fats. 50-60% of your calories should come from fat on the ketogetnic diet. I understand that budgets often won’t allow for purely grass-fed animals. I am in the same boat and still eat a mainly farm-raised animal meat. In the big picture it’s not terribly bad for you as long as you actively seek out healthy fats from avocados, coconut oil, fish oil, and nuts. Your goal is to balance your omega-3 fatty acid intake(good, anti-inflammatory fat) with your omega-6 intake(bad, pro-inflammatory fat) in a 1:1 ratio.
* Protein – Grass-fed beef, pork, poultry. If you can’t find grass fed eat lean cuts of these same meats and get your fats from the good fat list above. Wild fish are also a fantastic source of protein. Also eggs, almonds, and macadamia nuts. Whey protein powder is great for supplementing your protein intake. 30-40% of your calories should come from protein on the ketogenic diet.
* Carbohydrates – Avoid six days a week. Refeed on Sundays. Refeed days should consist of 1.5g of carbohydrates per pound of body weight. If you weigh 200lbs you will eat 300g of carbohydrates on your refeed day. Get your carbohydrates from fruits and veggies – bananas, apples, pears, strawberries, sweet potatoes, potatoes, plantains, yucca root, are a few options. Avoid processed carbohydrates(breads, pastas, flours). Your goal is to avoid eating ANY carbohydrates Monday through Saturday.

**Benefits of Keto:**

* When your body has no fuel from food it burns stored bodyfat instead of converting protein into glucose.
* The most effective fat burning diet in existence.
* You can eat awesome and satisfying meals- like bacon-wrapped steaks! On keto you can eat until you’re full and still lose 2-3 pounds of fat per month.
* Maintains muscle mass on a cut better than traditional 40/40/20 diets
* Keto increases your body’s insulin sensitivity and gives you steady energy levels throughout the day because you avoid insulin induced blood sugar crashes.

**Negatives of Keto:**

* It can be difficult to avoid all carbs and stay in ketosis. 
* You are missing out on vital nutrients by avoiding fruits and vegetables. You should always supplement with a high quality multivitamin but this is especially important while on keto. [Link to my favorite cost-effective multi.](http://www.thehealthygamer.com/nowadam)
* Your gym performance will suffer because your muscles will be glycogen depleted. This will lead to lower strength and endurance in your workouts. However this is temporary. As soon as you refill your muscle glycogen your performance comes back. Thus you should do your heavy lifting on Mondays after your carb refeeds.

**Carb Cycling**

Carb cycling is a nice middle-of-the road approach for people who want to lose fat but don’t want their gym performance to suffer. Depending on the amounts of carbs and calories you take in carb cycling is a very effective recomp eating strategy. Recomp is when you lose fat and gain muscle at the same time(albeit not as much fat as you could lose on a purely cutting diet, or as much muscle as you could gain on a purely bulking diet).

The idea behind carb cycling is that we want our muscle glycogen stores to be full when we perform our maximal effort lifts. We also want to keep our insulin as low as possible during the week in order to mobilize the greatest amount of fat and avoid all of the aforementioned problems that can come with excess insulin. We can achieve this by timing our carbohydrate intake.

When you carb cycle you should pick three days a week where you want to have the best performance in the gym. When I carb cycle I follow a 5×5 program and do full-body lifts Monday, Wednesday, and Friday. So then my diet and exercise would look like this:

* Sunday – Perform 10 minutes of HIIT. This can be sprints, full-body cardio circuits, anything. I have a post detailing good interval circuits here. After you perform the HIIT eat a meal containing 100g of carbohydrates. Then I will eat another meal two to three hours later containing 50g of carbohydrates. I prefer bananas, plantains, and sweet potatoes for my carb sources. You perform HIIT prior to eating the carbs because the exercise will ensure that the glucose you consume is shuttled to muscle glycogen stores and not stored as fat.
* Monday – Full-body heavy lifting session in the gym. 15 minutes of HIIT after the session. Eat less than 50g of carbs post workout and no other carbs for the day.
* Tuesday – 10 minutes of HIIT followed by 100g of carbs with another 50g in a follow up meal.
* Wednesday – Full-body heavy lifting session in the gym with 10 minutes of HIIT after the session. Less than 50g of carbs post workout.
* Thursday – 10 minutes of HIIT followed by 100g of carbs with another 50g in a follow up meal.
* Friday – Full-body heavy lifting session in the gym with 15-20 minutes of HIIT after the session. Less than 50g of carbs post workout.
* Saturday – Depending on how I feel I will either perform another session of HIIT, take a walk/hike, or just rest.

This schedule can be modified to fit your lifestyle. The important thing to note is that your carb intake should always come after your workout. And you should lower the carb intake on your workout days to less than 10g if you want to achieve maximal fat loss. You will not reach ketosis with carb cycling. Carb cycling is great for keeping your insulin under control while giving you maximum strength and endurance in the gym.

**Where your calories should come from:**

* Fat – Avocados, coconut oil, olive oil, fish, grass-fed animals, almonds, macadamia nuts, almond butter, coconut butter, grass-fed butter, free-range eggs. Avoid - Too much farm-raised animal fat, peanuts, vegetable oils, trans fats. 30-45% of your calories should come from fat while carb cycling. I understand that budgets often won’t allow for purely grass-fed animals. I am in the same boat and still eat a mainly farm-raised animal meat. In the big picture it’s not terribly bad for you as long as you actively seek out healthy fats from avocados, coconut oil, fish oil, and nuts. Your goal is to balance your omega-3 fatty acid intake(good, anti-inflammatory fat) with your omega-6 intake(bad, pro-inflammatory fat) in a 1:1 ratio.

* Protein – Grass-fed beef, pork, poultry. If you can’t find grass fed eat lean cuts of these same meats and get your fats from the good fat list above. Wild fish are also a fantastic source of protein. Also eggs, almonds, and macadamia nuts. Whey protein powder is great for supplementing your protein intake. 20-30% of your calories should come from protein on the ketogenic diet.

* Carbohydrates – Get your carbohydrates from fruits and veggies – bananas, apples, pears, strawberries, sweet potatoes, potatoes, plantains, yucca root, are a few options. Avoid processed carbohydrates(breads, pastas, flours). 15-25% of your calories should come from carbohydrates.

**Pros:**

* Your muscles will feel refreshed for your heavy lifting workouts.
* You can still gain strength and muscle while simultaneously losing fat. Or if you’re focusing more on cutting weight you can maintain muscle and strength while cutting a good amount of fat per week(.25-.5% bf per week).
* Easier to stick to than a strict keto or low-carb diet.

**Cons:**

* You won’t lose fat as quickly as a pure cutting diet, and you won’t gain weight as quickly as a pure bulking diet. Every decision in life has its trade-offs.

**What Sorts of Workouts Should I do?**

Progression. Consistency. Efficiency. These shall be your watchwords.

To know the best workout routine for you, you must first have a goal. I will outline the three most common goals below: to look good naked, to be healthy, and to be jacked.

**I want to look good naked!**

I wish more people would follow through with this goal. To look good naked you only need to perform three to five interval cardio circuits lasting 15 to 25 minutes each week.

Throw out the old notion that “more is better.”

&gt;SPRINT training for 60 minutes a week burns the same amount of body fat in men as jogging for seven hours a week, Sydney scientists report.

High intensity interval circuits(HIIT) are exercises where you bring your heart rate above 85% of your maximal rate for 30-90 seconds and then rest for 30-60 seconds before performing another set. These circuits have several benefits for those wanting to look good naked:

* HIIT promotes optimal hormone signaling – causing your body to release more testosterone and growth hormone.
* HIIT increases insulin sensitivity.
* HIIT burns calories at a much higher rate than traditional “steady-state” cardio. The study linked above shows that performing four sprint workouts for 15 minutes each burns as much visceral fat in men as those who ran for six to seven hours at a steady pace.
* HIIT promotes much greater muscular hypertrophy than steady-state cardio- you’ll gain more muscle, everywhere.

There is really no reason for you to do steady-state cardio unless you’re training for a specific endurance event. Even if you are an endurance athlete HIIT workouts combined with long-distance endurance workouts create the optimal endurance athlete.

Steady-state cardio also has drawbacks that you won’t see with HIIT:

* Long periods of steady-state training promotes high levels of cortisol in the body- this leads to muscle catabolism, suppressed immune function, and adrenal fatigue and burnout.
* Steady-state training depletes glucose stores – leaving you hungry and craving sugar, which will then spike your insulin and cause all of the problems we talked about earlier.
* TIME. Why spend seven hours working out each week when you can get BETTER results in only one hour?

**My recommended workout regime for someone who wants to look good naked:**

* Two full-body strength training workouts in the gym each week- focusing on heavy compound lifts: squat, deadlift, bench-press, pullups, rows, dips, military press. These workouts should be short and intense. Work in the 4-6 rep range for 3-6 working sets(warmups don’t count as a working set) per exercise and finish your workout in 45 minutes or less.
* Two to four HIIT training sessions per week. A simple HIIT workout is to sprint for 30 seconds, walk for 15 to 45 seconds depending on your level of fitness, and repeat for ten minutes. [I have a list of great high intensity interval circuits here.](http://www.thehealthygamer.com/2013/01/24/cardio-that-doesnt-suck/)
* Perform two HIIT sessions per week on days that you aren’t lifting. Keep it short and simple. 25 minutes max.
* Don’t perform a HIIT session the day before a lifting session.
* Each HIIT session should all be less than 15 minutes long if you perform more than two HIIT sessions per week.

**The key is progression in the gym. You can add progression by decreasing your rest times, increasing your weight/reps performed, and working opposing muscle groups back to back- for example doing five reps of deadlifts and then immediately performing five reps of bench press and repeating that process until you puke, cry, or die.**

**I just want to be healthy**

You don't need a sixpack. You don't need 18"" biceps. You just want to feel good and have life-long health.

Many of the same concepts that apply to those who want to look good naked still apply to you. You will still benefit greatly from HIIT workouts. You won't need any gym-based strength training workouts(unless you want to hit the gym). And you can get away with 1-2 hours of total exercise per week and still reach your goals.

&gt; “Let food be thy medicine and medicine be thy food” ― Hippocrates

Nutrition, nutrition, nutrition. Health is 90% nutrition and 10% exercise. All the exercise in the world won't save you from a diet of trans fats, processed carbohydrates, and toxic chemicals. There are people living today whose only form of exercise is a leisurely walk in the morning- yet they are more healthy and more vital than many ""gym rats"" who kill themselves with hours of intense exercise. Because the former eat a nourishing and revitalizing diet while the latter punish their bodies with processed poison.

I'm going to assume that you have no desire to perform intense exercise. If you don't mind doing some sprints and hitting the gym you'll be better served by following the ""I want to look good naked"" advice. As someone who has a relatively lower level of physical activity you will need to limit your carbohydrate intake. Remember that any excess glucose that can't be stored in the liver or muscles is stored as fat. Since you have a low activity level your liver and muscle glycogen levels will remain full throughout the week- thus your dietary carbohydrate intake must be consciously reduced. The reason more than one third of Americans are obese is because they live a sedentary lifestyle yet consume more carbohydrates than even a triathlete can use. What a crazy world.

**Your workout:**

* Walk for at least half an hour four times a week. If you can walk for half an hour every-day, that's great! If you have the time to go even longer, fantastic. There really isn't a point where you can walk ""too much.""
* Incorporating bodyweight exercises is still recommended. You won't need to ramp up the intensity but three sets of pushups, situps, pullups, and squats two times a week will build a base of strength that will keep you strong and limber as you age. These also promote beneficial hormone releases in the form of testosterone and growth hormone, both of which help slow the aging process and keep you vital.
* There is absolutely nothing wrong with strength training or HIIT circuits for your healthy life goals. I recommend them to everyone. But you don't need to do them if your goal is to simply lose weight and be healthy.

**I want to be JACKED**

Strength training in the gym is the most efficient way to ""get jacked."" Bodyweight exercises are great and can give you a fantastic base of muscle, but from a pure efficiency standpoint nothing beats barbell strength-training.

Imagine that your max pushups is 50 without stopping. To increase the stress load on your muscles in future workouts you must either- do more than 50 pushups without stopping, do pushups faster, or do more sets of pushups. Once you reach a certain level of fitness it becomes very time-consuming and mentally demanding to increase your progression. Who has the time to do 500+ pushups in a workout?

This problem is very easily solved with barbell weights. Once you've progressed with a certain weight just throw on five more pounds and you have progressed.

Cardio should not be avoided on your quest to get huge. Cardio is too often demonized by the lifting community as being harmful to your gains. Uninformed individuals throw around the idea that cardio will burn your precious muscle. False. With proper nutrition cardio(and especially high intensity interval cardio) works synergistically with your strength-training workouts to promote the most muscle growth while keeping your fat gain to a minimum.

**Your workout routine:**

* I recommend beginners and intermediate lifters follow 5x5. If you're an advanced lifter you don't need me to tell you what to do, but I like switching between 5x5 and 5x3x1 every few months for advanced lifters. 
* Supplement your lifts with two to three high intensity circuit cardio workouts each week. The circuits should focus on hypertrophy of muscle groups as well as pure cardio. I really like incorporating sets of pullups, pushups, and bodyweight squats into my circuit training to get that extra hypertrophy for my back, biceps, chest, triceps, shoulders, glutes, hams, and quads. Keep the interval training under 20 minutes per session.
* Remember, more is not always better. You should strive to work your muscles as hard as you can- as recovered as you can. I follow a very simple rule when I go to the gym. If after three warmup sets I feel tired/lethargic/unmotivated I will cut my workout short. If my program calls for me to squat 350x5 that day maybe I'll only squat 275 for a few sets and call it good- skipping cardio and auxiliary work completely. Pushing past plateaus should be a sporadic endeavor attempted only when you feel refreshed and energized. Here's a video of me doing 102 reps of squats with 225lbs. I felt fresh and motivated that day. For the next two weeks I did ZERO leg work because I was drained by the squats. Trying to push past that exhaustion would have lead to injuries and burnout.
* Pace yourself. Rest. Relax. The gym will still be there tomorrow. You really will make more gains if you take a moderate approach to the gym. Please take this advice if you take nothing else from this post.

I have been asked again and again, ""Morgan, what is your secret?""
All of you know as well as I do, there is no secret. I lost weight the only real way you can.

I learned about portion sizes. I counted calories (consumed less than i used ). I exercised and, I developed self discipline. 

I used My Fitness Pal religiously. I have logged every day since August 12th with no exceptions. I am going to keep logging for a while so I can really get an idea of how to maintain. I think my actual goal is 145 lbs, but at this point I am focusing more on exercise than deficit.

Exercise was difficult at first. I really wanted to jump right into the deep end. I wanted to run a 5K and hike mountains. But, well I couldn't. I was obese and terribly out of shape. So I started with long walks with my dog. I tell you what he was all about our new health journey. I would walk him an hour before work, and an hour before bed.
About a month in I would walk faster, and try to go the length of a 5k.
another month or two, I added small chunks of jogging. Then we started hiking. It was all step by step.
I am happy to say my 5k time is about 27mins now! And last week I kayaked 10 miles! I honestly love exercise now. It never feels like a chore. It is what I wanted to do! 

My background is probably a little different than other people here.  I haven't always been big. In high school I was varsity cross country. But in college I started getting sick. I had headaches all the time. I got physically ill more and more often. I also started having seizures. The doctor's put me on epilepsy meds and I was passed from doctor to doctor for 10 years. Meanwhile, I felt worse and worse and my depression was getting out of hand. I was gaining weight quickly.
In October of 2011 I landed myself in the hospital with a high fever, infections in my spine, bladder and kidney and I had passed out from vomiting. It wasn't a good time. But at the hospital the doctors found I had severe Celiac's disease. I wasn't absorbing nutrients and it was all going into storage.

Celiac's is a pretty easy fix. No gluten. At all. Ever. I can barely walk into a bakery.

After being completely gluten free for a year and a half I felt well enough to care about myself again. In August of last year I went to my high school reunion. For my name tag I had to wear my senior year photo. Wearing a badge of myself 10 years younger and 100 lbs lighter was a reality punch in the face.

I am happy to say I am healthier than I have ever been. I still face a lot of complications from Celiac going untreated for as long as it did, such as various autoimmune issues. But I feel so much stronger and happier. I honestly feel like I can do just about anything.



Quick tips that really helped me:

* keep a water bottle with you. I have a 24 oz water bottle with me all the time at work. It makes sure you stay hydrated. 


*make your own food. you have control over what you are eating.


*stay away from prepackaged food. Your goal is to get healthy, all those chemicals in prepackaged foods are generally not the health food they advertise themselves to be.


*take a walk. take the stairs. park in the last row. move as much as you can.


Thank you so much r/loseit. You are all an inspiration.

Ever since I was a child, I have been made fun of and picked on as ""the fat girl"".  I have heard every insult you can possibly imagine, including your Forrest Gump reference.  While you were sitting in your black sports car, driving down the road on this lovely day, you thought it would be funny to yell ""run fatty run"" at me.  I am sure you did not expect me to yell ""fuck you!"" back, which is why you came around for a second yell, which I ignored.

It might be hard for you to see, but I now weigh 160 pounds.  I have lost over 30 pounds in 7 months, and gained more confidence than I can measure.  While your childish methods of picking on someone may be the only outlet for you to find joy in life, I find my satisfaction in bettering myself as a human being, not making others feel like less of one.  Your hateful words, while they hurt at first, gave me more motivation to run an additional half mile today, which allowed me to run 1.5 miles non-stop - something that I have never done.

So please, continue to make fun of me.  I will be running that same route every other day, huffing and puffing my ass until it becomes as easy as normal breathing.  One day, you will be driving by and see me in shorts and a tank top, running with ease and a perfect stride.  And I hope you remember my face, when you feel inclined to whistle at me (you seem the type).  I will probably ignore you, but I hear your slander, and use it to push myself and achieve distances I never thought possible.  I certainly won't yell ""run fatty run"" when I'm cheering you on from the sidelines of your 5k, but I will sleep better knowing that I beat you to the finish line.

EDIT: I guess my post needs more detail so here's the comment:

It's been a wild ride so far! I was a [fat kid](http://i.imgur.com/nJfeP.jpg) (that's me on the right), then I developed anorexia at age 14 which nearly killed me (the only pictures I have left of this time are NSFW, sorry). Age 17 I went into recovery, gained weight and was happy and healthy by age 18. Then a myriad of social, academic, and medical issues caused me to start seeking solace in too much alcohol and even more food. I gained a shit ton of weight, became severely depressed, lost all interest in everything and felt awful all the time.

Then one day something clicked and it seems silly to say but I owe it all to [this video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3NFWgG4_6NI). I was just mesmerized by the way that girl moves and how lithe her body is. I watched 20 seconds of that video, looked down at my own body and said ""To hell with this!"" and haven't looked back. I don't have a rigid workout schedule or a diet plan, I just go with what feels right. Nothing is totally off-limits. If I want a glass of wine or a pack of Skittles, I'm gonna have it! As for exercise, I do Zumba and yoga, I love hula-hooping and I recently found a belly-dancing sarong I bought in Taiwan a few years back so I'd love to get into that! Also, I used to throw myself into either starving myself or gorging myself to deal with stress: now I throw myself into working out!

I started looking at /r/loseit back in August for inspiration. I remember looking at everyone's progress pictures and wishing I could just fast-forward through the hard part and be looking at my own progress pictures. Well, the hard part is half the fun, isn't it? If we were able to skip the shitty parts, none of us would feel half as proud of ourselves as we are.

Not wanting to go to the gym because you are overweight is like not wanting to go to hospital because you are sick.,2178,619,302,http://www.reddit.com/r/loseit/comments/1aswcy/dear_everyone_the_only_person_in_the_gym_who/,"Seriously, nobody cares what you look like. In fact, when I'm at the gym and see a larger person going for it, I think two things:

* GOOD FOR YOU BUDDY. You are increasing your quality of life in the ways that cannot be quantified. You are no longer indifferent to your health, unquestionably the most valuable thing you own.
* Damn, that guy's really grafting. I'm not sweating like that, I should up my game like his.

It's totally normal to feel more sensitive to people judging you in a new environment. I imagine it must be even more acute if you've frequently suffered people making derogatory comments about your appearance.

But think about it. The gym is the one place where you are *immune* from such comments. ""Hey fatty, get down the gy...er nevermind."" See? Even assholes who taunted you would be left with nothing to say. In the gym, people just can't make such comments. And they don't. Young, old, black, white, obese, skinny - everyone's there for one reason only: to get healthier.

You want to lose weight, but your anxiousness won't let you, and you're not changing your habbits, right? So what about the times when you're at the supermarket, loading your stuff onto the belt? What about the times when you get into work and get a coffee and a chocolate muffin on the way to your desk?

You think the people watching your sorry ass standing next to that mountain of shitty food at the cash register aren't judging you? You think your colleagues watching you eat cake for breakfast every morning aren't judging you? And yet you're worried what people might think about you in the *gym*?

People are always forming passing judgements on other people - both positive and negative ones. I'm not necessarily endorsing it, it's just what we do. You do it too.

The gym is your personal oasis away from all the crappy judgements you have ever endured, and a key part of a lifestyle which will give you the body/fitness you want - and free you from ever having to hear such comments again.

Why aren't you there?

(**Edit**: several people have mentioned comments from those who clearly do care about someone's appearance in the gym, and have made unreasonable comments to them with that in mind. No doubt that they are unpleasant, but the point of my post is that they are utterly flawed and should be completely disregarded. Telling an overweight person that they have no place in a gym is, per the title, like telling a sick person that they don't belong in hospital, and you should treat such comments with the respect they deserve: none whatsoever. Furthermore, whatever gym equipment you have paid to use, you have EVERY RIGHT to use it as other paid members. If they have a problem with that, its their problem, not yours. You've started giving a fuck about yourself - good, but it's not going to amount to anything if you still give a fuck about what other people think of you.)",,False,,t5_2rz8w,1363986275.0,,35lbs,True,t3_1aswcy,http://www.reddit.com/r/loseit/comments/1aswcy/dear_everyone_the_only_person_in_the_gym_who/,

The competition was all based around fitness tests - vertical leaps, sprints, pressups and all manner of other body weight exercises. On a whim I decided to enter and... well, It was tough. Round after round of heats ... but after beating 10 competitors, I actually won! and was crowned one of the 'fuel kings' of the evening. 

It sounds silly... (after all, it's no olympic medal) but winning reduced me to tears. you see - I used to weigh over 252lbs. I used to struggle to climb stairs, and was forced to make my own clothes because no store stocked my size... I was miserable. but In the past year that's all changed. 

In the past year I've lost over 80lbs+ of Fat ... using nothing but hard work and discipline.and standing there with people cheering for my physical achievement, I realised that for the first time in my life I physically competed against other people. not only that, but I actually won a competition based on fitness...and although I'm nowhere near the levels of a 'professional athlete', it feels amazing to succeed at something I used to believe was beyond my ability. 

So to all of my fellow Redditors who are trying to achieve something: keep going. The pain, hardships, low moments and failures are all worth it. Oh and the prize? £500 worth of Nike gear (including new trainers &amp; a fuel band) ;-)

[Edit] As requested, here is an my **abridged workout/diet regime**  

* This whole process began with a whimsical decision to try vegetarianism - it was a simply 'can I do it for 30 days challenge', devoid of any health/religious motivations. 
* after 1 week I'd lost 7 lbs so I started walking every few days. (I was too fat to jog/run). over the next 2 months I worked up to the point where I was jogging every other day (less then 2k). 
* With over 25lbs gone, I decided to see if I could push harder. So I hit the books, hard. researching physical fitness, calorie deficits, diets, body hacks… the works (I basically became a physical trainer over night haha). 

* I designed a plan based around High-protein, low-carbs and calorie counting, one that used intermittent fasting to help me address my relationship with food, and gave me all the fuel I needed.
* I kept my intake around 1800kcals and cycled in carbs every few days so that I had the energy to workout. I ate 6 meals a day, and have rarely ever felt hungry (although I have fallen asleep due to low-blood sugar lots of times). 
* As I couldn't afford gyms, I jogged/ran daily and used whatever I could find in parks to work out (jungle gyms, body weight exercises, the works!). 
* The more weight I lost, the easier it was...
* After 6ish months, I went and had another DEXA scan - my body fat had dropped from 38% to 14%. My plan was a little extreme, but is incredibly simple (and got me the results!). 

[Edit] I am humbled by the response this post has received - I never knew so many wonderful people existed, and your comments and kind words have really made this an amazing experience. And for that, I thank you each and every one of you :-)

As requested, I'm going to write up the plan that got me from where I was, to where I am. (but i can't do it right now as i'm at work) As soon as it's done, I'll post it here free for all to see and share so that hopefully others can use it to achieve their fitness goals.

Last night my wife came into my office and told me that she was tired of me being cranky lately about being plateaued in my weight loss.  It's been a few weeks since I've seen any weight loss, I've actually been bouncing up and down between 302 and 305.  She then told me to stand up and close my eyes.  

I did and she handed me a pair of jeans. She told me to put them on without opening my eyes.  I started laughing and asked if she was serious.  She just said ""Keep 'em closed and get changing.""

So trying not to fall over I finally got them on and buttoned up without opening my eyes.  It's actually harder than it seems.  The pants fit well, a little snug, but well.  She then told me to take off my shirt and put on the one she was handing me.  That was a lot easier to do.

Finally she took my left hand in hers and told me to open my eyes. I did and looked down at what I was now wearing.  The black shirt and new jeans looked good on me, not baggy and saggy like all the clothes I've been wearing since I started losing weight.  (I hate  buying clothes and keep worrying I'm just going to gain weight back again so I haven't.)

She looked me in the eye and told me ""When you told me you were going to lose weight you were wearing a 3XL or 4XL shirts.  Your suit pants are a 50 waist and your jeans were 48's.  Right now you're wearing a 2XL shirt and a pair of 42 waist jeans.  You're freaking out about the scale without recognizing what your accomplishments are.  You gotta stop that honey.  Okay?""

I'll admit I suddenly felt all kinds of embarassed and awkward so I just nodded.  She smiled and gave me a kiss before telling me to get back to my game. When she was about four steps down the hall she stopped and looked back at me over her shoulder.  She called back, ""Hey honey?  You know now that you're wearing pants that aren't all baggy and saggy your butt looks damn sexy.  You should come show me that a bit more....""

Damn I love that woman.

I'm 5'10.

Each picture has a description which will answer some of the questions people may have.

The basics: The first part of my loss came from life changes and just putting my foot down. My initial 30 pound loss came from cutting down what I ate. At the time, I was having seconds and often thirds when it came to meals, in addition to a multitude of snacks. I cut my intake down to just one helping of a meal and lost around 30 pounds in a year just from that.

The second big amount of loss came from moving to Vancouver. My main mode of transportation was walking, and I did it a lot. I'd walk around town to clear my head, to get away, because I was bored, etc. I looked for any excuse. By then I had lost another 67 pounds.

Another life change caused me to move back home and I gained 40 of the 67 I had lost back, mainly because I was no longer exercising. In 2011 I made my first actual attempt at losing weight. Before then, it had just happened accidentally because of life changes, but this was my first time wanting to do it. I made my 2011 Resolution to get down to 250, which was a few pounds less than what I was when I began to gain again.

I started January 1st. My main exercise was a stationary bike, with walking outside in the summer. I gradually increased the mileage on the stationary bike until I was eventually biking 20 miles/day. That, coupled with no longer overeating, I lost just over 102 pounds for the year, far exceeding my resolution.

I had intended to just do it until I hit my resolution, but realized very quickly, that that just wouldn't cut it. I realized that if you're trying to lose weight, you have to choose an exercise that you like doing; something that you can do for the rest of your life. If you go in thinking, ""I'll just do this until I lose the weight,"" you'll relapse for sure. I finished my 2011 resolution four months in and said screw it, and decided to go for the rest of the year. I realized then, that it's not something you can start and stop. It's a lifestyle change, and if you're not in it for life, you'll gain everything back.



Because of Holiday eating, coupled with getting a bad virus which lasted for much longer than I'd have liked, I've packed on a bit due to eating more than usual and not feeling up to even getting out of bed, let alone exercising again. I'm finally feeling up to going at it again, with yesterday being the first time I'd done anything in a long while.

It sucks, but I know since I got there once, it's only a matter of time until I get back down there. I aim to reach my goal weight of 170 by the summer.

I still bike the 20 miles, only every other day now, as I started getting a bit bored of it again. I'm also giving C25K a shot on the days I'm not on the bike, with a day of rest at the end of the week.

How did I lose the weight?
Doing all the things all of you recommend! Add vegetables, avoid simple carbs, exercise, and treat my body with respect. I am a work in progress, and will continue to be a work in progress - to stop working on myself, is when the problems really start. 

At first it was hard, I ate VOLUMES of food. So I replaced the 30 wings with a mountain of vegetables, I ate till I was miserable on Brussel Sprouts! LOL. I slowly cut the portion sizes back to normal portion sizes. I eat 5-6 times a day, and try to never go hungry. I have a hard and fast belief that I can find Meat, Fat, &amp; Simple Carbs easily -- its vegetables &amp; fruit that are harder to locate (re: restaurant menu) so I seek fruits and vegetables. I try and fill up on the good things and leave little room for the other things (which I still enjoy - I love beer, and bread, and baloney -- just way smaller portions!).

Jeremiah's highest weight was 260 pounds. He slimmed down to about 210 for our wedding by cutting out sodas, counting calories and eating more vegetables. In June of 2012 he began following a ketogenic diet. As much bulletproof coffee as he wants, kale shakes for lunch and low/carb free dinner! He used a standing desk at his office for 40+ hours a week as well as doing body squats. He's down to 168 pounds and still losing. 

My highest weight was 312 pounds and I'm now at 145. I cut out carbs and sugars. upped my protein and limited my calorie intake. I followed C25K to start myself into exercise. I joined my husband on a ketogenic diet although much more loosely. He aims for 25g of carbs while I float below 100g. 

We have been a great positive influence on each other. We exchanged kettlebells for Christmas and are excited to continue on our path of health!

The front ""before"" picture was taken on 2/18/10 and the ""after"" picture on 5/20/12 and the side ""before"" picture was also taken on 2/18/10 and the ""after"" side picture was taken on 2/24/12

I weighed in at 347 lbs (I am 6'3"") on 2/18/2010 after avoiding a scale for over a year. I was 20 years old and had allowed myself to become, genuinely, morbidly obese. I am 22 and now weigh between 195-205 depending on the day. In the comparison photos I weighed 198 in the front shot comparison and ~205 in the side shot comparison. 

Now, I guess it's for what will hopefully be a succinct version of ""my story.""

The same day I weighed in at 347 I began my diet and exercise regiment. I cut out all fast food, all soda/drinks that had calories aside from skim milk and I started off my cardiovascular exercise on the stationary bike my dad owned, which was being used as a secondary coat rack at the time. The first time I got on the bike I lasted a whole 5 minutes before I felt like my lungs were going to explode. The diet I began was, what I now realize, FAR too strict of a diet. I was only eating only about 1400-1600 calories a day. I kept on riding the exercise bike before and after work for 5-7 minutes (which was as long as I could last) until I eventually was riding it for 20 minutes a session before and after work. Once the bicycling seemed ""too easy"" I began walking to and from work (1.5 miles each way) and riding the exercise bike in the evening. Then I moved down to San Diego away from home. By the time I had moved I had already lost 80 lbs and was down to ~270. Once I was in SD I began using the elliptical machines for cardio at the 24 hour fitness I went to in Point Loma. I would do 30 minutes a day along with my weight lifting, which I did 5-6 days a week. Once I dropped down to 240 lbs I began to run on the treadmill. I had weighed 240 through most of high school and played football at that weight so I told myself If I could run at 240 in high school I could do it now. I kept on using running as my main means of cardio ever since. I had never once passed ""the mile"" test in high school (I believe the cut off point was 16 minutes) I fell in love with running. I only assume that I enjoyed it so much because, unlike weight lifting, I had previously never been able to do it very well. 

The lowest I dropped down to was 193 lbs but I looked like a skeleton and began a 2 month ""phase"" in which I ate at maintenance (~3200 calories a day) and I tried to let my body adjust to living at that weight. After my ""adjustment phase"" I upped my calorie intake to 4000 calories a day and cut my cardio back to twice a week runs for my first attempt at a bulking phase. I have to say, Losing weight is easy! I have gotten it down by now, but trying to wrap my mind around purposefully trying to gain weight was the hardest thing I have done. I was loving my gains in the gym and put on some decent size for the 3 month span I was ""bulking"" but, god, I was a wreck mentally. I constantly felt bloated and ""fat"" but I guess those are just the hang ups I will have to continue to work through. I have since ""cut"" back down from 215 (what I weighed after my first attempt at a bulk) and now my diet now has me consuming around 3000 calories a day to ""maintain"" my weight.

A few ""key"" things I have learned over the past 2 years:
- Count calories. Do it, Calories in vs Calories out = weight loss. 
- Diet should be your main focus. Cardio helps to burn extra calories, of course, but your diet will make or break your weight loss. Also, everyone should weight lift as well (extra burned calories from the act of weight lifting and adding on muscle mass will lead to you naturally burning more calories)
- Personally, I lived by a high protein, medium carbs, medium fat intake on a daily basis. I generally kept my carbs around 150 grams a day and my fats around 100-125 grams a day. Protein intake would be anywhere from 200-300 grams. That is a very general look at it but, it's pretty much what my macro nutrient intake looks like.
- Don't go for any diet that excludes an entire food group. Please, don't. Eat a wide variety of foods in moderation. If I have a craving for some Ben and Jerry's you better believe I will have some. I will just make sure I skip out on something else earlier in the day to be able to enjoy it without as much guilt.

I can easily go into more detail, and will if anyone is actually interested in what I have to say. Everything I posted here is just what I have learned from my own experiences and what worked for me.

Edit #2:

The response to this has been overwhelming! I was only expecting a few ""good jobs"". Definitely didn't see myself getting so many upvotes for this!

Here's a quick FAQ on me:



How old am I?

-21


How tall am I?

-5'10''



What did I do to lose all that weight?

-I worked hard. That's really all there is to it. You want something? You gotta work hard to get it. But most importantly, you gotta never give up. There were days, even weeks, where I would cheat on my diet or even skip the gym because i didn't feel like doing it anymore. But what made the difference is that I picked myself up shortly afterwards and kept on going.



Did I plateau?

-Yes. Many times. And let me tell you, they are very disheartening. The key to beating them is to just stop weighing yourself for 3 to 4 weeks and just keep doing what you're doing. Eventually your body will give up trying to hold on to the fat and just start burning it again. The most persistent ones where when I hit 270 and 230. It took me over a month to get over those, but once I did, my body just started shedding like 2+ pounds a week.



Do I lift weights?

-Not really. I kinda did at first for the first 3 months or so but I realized that cardio burns way more fat and calories than weight training (this is my opinion. if you don't agree, that is 100% okay. ""to each their own."") so I took the time I used in weight training and just did double the cardio. I do however do pull/chin ups every now and then though. I think they are fun.



What cardio machines did you use?

-90% elliptical. 5% treadmill. 5% bicycle.



How often do I go to the gym?

-Everyday. I personally don't believe in rest days.



Did I follow a certain exercise program or diet program?

-No. I kinda just did what felt right. At the gym I did what really got my heart beat going and made me workout the most. As for a diet, I just eat healthy in general. Avoid soda/juices, dont eat junk/fast food more than once a month, etc.



What's the best advise that I can give to someone who is trying to lose a lot of weight?

-Do not give up. No matter what. You miss one day at the gym? Or eat unhealthy one day? pick yourself right back up the next day and punish yourself at the gym the next day. Also, don't weigh yourself every single day. Your weigh fluctuates too much each day. Weigh yourself once a week. I weighed myself every Sunday right after I woke up. Try not to look in the mirror too often either. You won't see changes for a bit. Also, just remember, 1 year of hard work = a lifetime of benefits.



When did I start seeing results?

-Within 2 months. They were small, but I could see them.

First off, I thank God for giving me the strength to continue on for this long, it has been exhausting to say the least. Also, I would like to thank everyone for the support, because I could never have done this without all of the encouragement that I received to keep going.

There have been thousands of people who have done what I have done (as seen on this sub-reddit) and all you ever really hear about his how they dieted and how they exercised and I will happily provide you all with that information in my instance, but for me, and I honestly feel like, for anyone it is 90% mental and the 10% pain you feel is only the pain that makes you stronger. Anyways, quote time: “No food tastes as good as being healthy”. Find your motivation.

***I didn’t any lifting to begin with, but current maxes are BP – 250, DL – 300, and Squat 250 (I’m really shooting for the 1000 pound club)***

My Diet:
For the most part I did calorie counting, on occasion I would read an article that would sound super convincing and I would try something different, I think I tried intermittent fasting and keto, and they both worked, but for me calories in versus calories out is the easiest thing to do and it worked best with my schedule. Along with that I focused on not eating late, mostly drinking water, hitting my protein goals, managing my sweet tooth, limiting carbs, and staying away from processed foods. A few aspects of this were easier for me, because I am too poor to eat out, I have never regular drank soda (and I don’t believe that crap about diet soda), and I don’t drink, so all of that juts came naturally. The hardest part was definitely the calorie counting itself. For most of the past two years I tried to stay under 1500 calories a day (occasionally 1200 if I was in a rush to meet a mini-goal) and sometimes 2200-2500 if I was trying to put on muscles or reach lifting goals. So to say the least portion control was my major struggle.

My Exercises:
I stayed pretty consistent for the entire two years with my splits. I would do cardio every day, sometimes twice a day. My lifting splits were back and bi, chest and tri, legs, shoulders and traps, and abs roughly five times a week. I seem to be extremely injury prone so I made adjustments accordingly. 

Supplements:
 Protein (whey and casein), Omega 3, Thermogenics, CLA, and BCAAs

What I did wrong:
My progress has been pretty slow; it’s amazing seeing some of you lose 140 pounds in a year and stuff like that. I lost 30 pounds my first month and despite already being weak I had gotten significantly weaker so I decided to bulk and cut at the same time. It is doable, but I would advise against it. It involves way too much time, because you are doing a lot of cardio and weights simultaneously and it slows the progress of both considering they are opposite goals. The only good part I would see about it is that I don’t have lose skin, I have gained roughly 20 pounds of muscles (estimate) and once I am done, because I don’t have to bulk just finish burning the fat around what is already there. So, I guess I could weigh less now, but the super skinny look is not what I am going for.

Despite the progress, my journey has just begun and this summer will be dedicated to in part to eating clean and getting lean, haha. 

Anyways, thanks for the read, good luck on YOUR goals and stay DISCIPLINED!

Fast forward a couple months after these pics are taken, and I meet a girl online. We hit it off instantly and talk for a few months, but then feelings are admitted, and she insists on meeting. I refused over and over because of how I looked, naturally... it didn`t help that she was smokin' hot and clearly out of my league. 

Anywho, I tell her the whole story and how bad I look and that there's no chance anything can happen, but she says she`s willing to wait for me to be comfortable with myself before we meet. It took me about 5 months, but I lost 55 pounds, bringing me to a grand total of 185. These are pictures taken shortly after we got together:

First, a mug shot. The face was definitely the most drastic change for me.

Second, a full body shot:

We've been together ever since we met, and I love her more than the world :)

As for how I did it, it was diet. Only diet. I didn't really exercise (I know I should have). I just limited my diet to 1350 calories per day. I was pretty strict with it, and the pounds just steadily kept coming off. 

I'm not done yet, but I've lost a little steam... I'm at 185 of my 180 goal and I was considering working out and putting on a little muscle. With the new semester starting, I'll probably start going to the school gym. Wish me luck!

EDIT: This response is overwhelming! I'm at work right now but ill be home in two or so hours to respond to questions. Thank you all so much!


EDIT2: I'll say it again... overwhelming! I really didn't expect so much positive feedback. I can't thank you all enough. For someone who has felt fat and fugly his whole life, I really don't know how to react to this. I was very worried about posting it at all, thinking others have done so much more than I have and that I'd be called out on it. No regrets now :)

If you're trying to lose weight, don't you dare stop. Feeling like you successfully changed your life for the better is a feeling that's incredibly worth it. Keep at it and make it happen, and link me to **your** post when you're done!

FINAL EDIT: Well, it looks like this thread is finally coming to a close. I'm going to be starting back on the diet to lose my final few pounds and then I'm going to be hitting the gym a bit to see what I can accomplish. Maybe my next post will be on fittit.

By 1998 I was 300 pounds, and I was 400 pounds by 2001. I was 400 pounds from 2001-2008. I ate cheeseburgers and fast food 2-3 meals a day. I didn't exercise. I had horrible diabetes that was out of control. 

In 2008 I started cutting out a cheeseburger a day and eating breakfast at home (usually oatmeal or cereal) and then after a few months I started eating dinner at home (usually junk food I heat up in the oven), and then I started eating healthier dinners, like chicken breasts and rice and veggies, really simple stuff I could cook on the stove or in the microwave. I stopped eating cheeseburgers at lunch and started buying chicken and salads. By 2011 I was 360 pounds, having lost 40 just from changing my food little by little. In 2011 I got a nicer kitchen and started getting into cooking (and I moved in with my family and had people to cook for) and I started cooking whole and organic foods and I stopped buying most processed foods (except pasta and dairy) and I started watching my calories using software and by October 2012 I was 300 pounds. 

Once I got to 300 pounds I started exercising, and in October of 2012 I started swimming twice a week at the local pool, maybe 10 laps, it would take me about half an hour. Then I started swimming 3 days a week, I started consuming 1200-1400 calories a day, then I increased myself to 15 laps, then 20, and I have lost another 50 pounds since October, and now I swim 5 days a week, 20-40 laps each time (7-9 km a week), and today I hit 250 pounds. I have lost 150 pounds in 5 years, I have completely changed my life, and I did it really slowly and gradually and I was able to completely change in incremental ways and it all adds up. I have 50 pounds more to go (I am 5'9"" and have a very large frame so my doctor has set my goal at 200), and I hope to have it done within the next 12 months. I am already having a lot of hanging skin, so I am going to get the skin surgeries after I hit goal and maintain it for 6 months. 

Here I am at 400 pounds, 2002:

Let me know if you have any questions, I'll answer anything. I'm so proud of my success. It is sometimes easy, sometimes really hard and I just keep myself motivated and I keep myself positive and I know that I will hit goal very soon and I will be at the same weight I was when I was 15. It blows my mind, and I can't believe I've finally lost 150 pounds. I've been struggling these last couple of months and my loss slowed down and it feels really good to finally hit that milestone.

ETA: My diabetes is in complete remission and I have been insulin free for 6 months. My PCOS has also improved. I had doctors try to force me to have gastric bypass and I refused, saying that I would do it if I made it to 40 and still was 400 lbs. I actually had a doctor refuse to treat me anymore because I refused gastric bypass surgery.

Also, about 4 months ago my hair started falling out and I've lost about 50%. Between googling and talking to my doctor, this is apparently common and takes about 6 months to reverse itself. I hope I don't go bald by the time it happens! 

ETA Again: I also wanted to share one more thing that I think is really important. I give myself a guilt-free 10 pound buffer. As long as I stay within 10 pounds of my lowest weight at any given time, I just move on and continue with my life knowing that it will come back down. So it really helps with the hard feelings and the emotions, and by not being upset with myself if I stay within the 10 pound buffer, it makes things a lot more positive and easier to cope with. And in the last 12 months, I only went over my buffer once (that was after I made a 1300 mile road trip and it was around Christmas).",,False,,t5_2rz8w,1371404788.0,,150lbs,True,t3_1gfjf8,http://www.reddit.com/r/loseit/comments/1gfjf8/as_of_today_i_have_lost_150_pounds_i_am_34_of_the/,

Hi Reddit! I try to post an update each time I hit a milestone, and today is one of those days. I am a 5'10"" 48 year old male, and have been on this diet since September of last year (about a week shy of 10 months ago).

I am on the MediFast diet, which I follow strictly. I am also on an exercise program of 0 minutes per day. Ok ... that's a bad thing ... I really need to start exercising. But to be honest, I'm doing so much more than I could a year ago that to me it's almost exercise ;)

Last July walking from my front door to my driveway and getting in my truck was followed by about 30 seconds of catching my breath. I would avoid any activity that I could, because I dreaded the panting that was sure to follow. These days I do a lot more walking as part of regular activities. Instead of sending the kids to the shed to get me something, I'll go myself ... and when I get back into the house I'm still amazed that I don't have to sit down and catch my breath.

I have posted a couple pictures before, but I'm going out to buy some new pants this afternoon, and after that I'll take a new one. The pants I have now are way too big (again ... man I do a lot of clothes shopping).

For honesty's sake, it's not all good losing this much weight. I'm having a very bad problem with my neck and shoulder, which seems to be due to my posture changing from the loss. That is making it hard to work (I'm a software developer, so I keep my arms in a typing position most of the day, which causes horrible pain. I am waiting for insurance to approve my MRI so I can find out of there's anything that can be done.

I'm also starting to worry about the excess skin that will need to be removed. Originally I planned to lose 330 lbs (530-200), but now I'm thinking that will be 300 even, since the skin will almost certainly cover the other 30 lbs. However, not many things scare me more than surgery, so I'm not looking forward to that. Once I hit 200 post-surgery, I'll decide if that's a good place to stay.

Anyway, as always I will answer ANY and EVERY question people ask. You can ask me about life at 530 lbs, you can ask me about the diet, and you can ask me about my current life at 300 lbs and falling.

I have posted a couple of pics before, but here are the last 2 again: [Start at 530 lbs](http://i.imgur.com/yCh4sT7.jpg) and [after 150 lost at 380 lbs](http://i.imgur.com/0WrnJMA.jpg) After I get the new pants I'll post another new one.

So...just leave her out of this, I'm referring more to the people being dicks, the people with constructive words I do appreciate it honestly. 

And I just want to say also that gastric bypass is in no way the easy way out...I've had to work my ass off to get to that point, and had to struggle with it since.

I'm not doing this for karma...I'm doing this because I hope someone will see this and be inspired on their journey that anyone can do this.

So proud of my sister for graduating and going off to college this fall 

My story:

Gained a ton of weight because of laziness and overeating, and huge into emotional eating. 10/11/11 I logged into my fitness pal and started counting calories like it was my job. By 4/11/12 I'd lost 100 pounds by calorie counting alone, and on that day I had gastric bypass. Fast forward to today, I'm down about 300 pounds by straight up just watching what I eat, using the surgery to my advantage. I, hopefully, soon will begin implementing a exercise routine to help break the plateau and hopefully even get through my depression.
As always if you have any questions or if there is anything you wanna know, leave a comment, send a pm, I'll try to get back to you as soon as I can. My mfp is swarlos37 add it up if you want!.

I've actually lost a little bit more fat and put on some muscle, and now I finally have official progress pictures.

**Official Before/Afters from the beginning**
---&gt; http://imgur.com/a/TiGdH#0

A week ago, my co-workers and I were informed all of the departments (we work in a casino) are allowed an encouraged to dress in formal wear on New Year's Eve. When I was told, I was excited because it meant I didn't have to spend money on a dress, as I had a bridesmaid dress I had worn exactly a year ago rotting in my closet. Color me surprised, though, when I put the dress on and it literally slips to my feet. I've lost 72 pounds in a year and a half- which I am proud of- but I was already 45 pounds into my journey when this wedding took place. I figured my weight loss since then was pretty minimal, as I was pretty close to a healthy weight then. I've been feeling pretty down about how it's taken me a whole year to basically lose 27 pounds, and that my progress was barely noticeable, but I guess I was wrong! I *have* made progress. 27 pounds doesn't really seem like a lot, but I'm suddenly recalling that old adage about paper towels: when you take sheets from a full roll, you barely notice it's gone; the closer to the cardboard, though, the more you notice every towel missing.

**The dresses and my one year progress**
---&gt;http://i.imgur.com/JG5So.jpg

I feel great now, and it made me really reassess my progress. I thought I had grown complacent, but in reality, I've made a lot of progress in great time. I went from obese to chubby yet with disordered eating habits in half a year (in the black dress), and in this whole year, I lost a lot of fat, gained a lot of muscle, and learned more about healthy food, nutrition, and body image. So I went out and took actual progress pictures. 

To those who don't feel like snooping my post history to find out my information, I am 24, 5'3, and 125 pounds. I don't know my body fat percentage, but feel free to guess that one (I don't know how to gauge women). I started out 197, but was 152 in the left picture. I've been on my journey for about a year and a half, although about 4-5 months ago, I started eating more and lifting weights instead of focusing on the scale number (so I've stalled at 125-127, at least weight-wise). I eat about 60% protein/20% fat/20% carbs, and sit between 1200-1700 calories, depending on varying factors. I lost my weight through calorie counting, primarily, and didn't start keeping track of macro-nutrients until half a year ago. I primarily did cardio for the bulk of my weight loss, but transitioned to weightlifting when I realized a lack of muscle meant I had to lose more weight, and that's way too tedious. :P

I think I'm mostly done with the weight department, or at least in the sense that I quit caring about numbers on the scale. I've stayed almost the same weight for four months now, yet my measurements are shrinking and my clothes fit differently. Losing the remaining vanity fat and gaining more muscle is the only goal I have for this new year. :D

I started out April 2012 and there have been many ups and downs. The weight came off really fast at first but it is so true that the last 20 or 30 it starts to slow down. I started tracking every calorie with MFP and set a goal of about 1500 - 1600. (This is still my calorie goal but I will be upping it soon sue to heavy weight training). I had a cheat day every weekend where I would not go out of control, but allowed myself treats or a nice meal out, or a night of drinking sensibly. At first, I just started going an short walks, then slowly increasing times and distances. In January, I found C25K and developed my new passion for running. Now I weight train 3 times a week, and run 3 times a week for exercise. My lifestyle is much more active now and I am feeling so much better about myself. Of course I had days (sometimes a few in a row) where I would fall off track, but the number one thing to remember is to never give up. Ever.      To me now, it is much less about the scale number (I am going down to weighing only once a month), and more about overall fitness, progress pics, and inches. The scale can either be a huge help or a hindrance. Don't ever let it rule your life and obsess over it.

Edit: 
I didn't know there were rules :/ I didn't see them next to the submit button (so I'm trying to abide by the rules now)


Story:
At 15, I was 5'4, 260lbs. I don't have a pics since I wasnt on computers then, but Im trying to scrounge up one for 3 years ago at 200.

At my heaviest, I remember coming home from Lagoon and developing pictures, and there was a pic of me and my best friend riding a carousel. I had rolls for days. My skin was red, blotchy, pimply. Hair:over processed, frizzy. Belly protruding. Shirt was a red Napolean Dynamite shirt witha Llama on it that said ""Tina, you fat lard""...it was SUPER ironic. And I remember shredding everyone of those pics. I wouldnt let my mother put them in the album. I was horrified.


She does have some pics from a vacation when I was about 245, but they are in a photo album.


Anyways here's what I could find on FB

I gained weight after moving a year ago (15 lbs), but these last 4 months, I'm trying to get back down:)




In any case:
I'm now 150 at 5'8. 20 lbs to go, and so close!

There is no secret here: 8 years of slow smart changes (no fast food, no soda) and some exercise thrown in. Did the master cleanse once(40 days), tried being vegan for a year.. these are not sustainable for me personally, but it helped me lose weight the year I did video updates. 

Every time I would lose about 30-40 pounds in this process, I'd usually gain back about 15, then lose again. I have no idea why. But it has taken me A REALLY LONG TIME to lose this weight.

now I eat 1200 cals a day, and am starting the paleo thing

doing my fitness pal, eating less carbs, more protein, no sweets, less fruit, more veg.


**Why the gap is important to me:** It is significant, because as a heavy person, my thighs used to rub. I'd get blisters on stretch marks, sweat, I'd literally burn through pants in the thigh area from the rubbing. It is just a visual way that I can see my body changing; because like most people, I don't look very different to me when I look in a mirror.

That is all. I'm just sharing my happiness.

Fuck!,1762,521,569,http://www.reddit.com/r/loseit/comments/1hz3kc/well_thaaaaat_was_a_fucking_wake_up_call_fuck/,"This is clearly a throwaway because this is absolutely, positively MORTifying to the point that I can't tell anyone else, so I thought I'd toss it out into the sea of r/loseit and hope that it makes me feel better.
As best I can 'long and short it' - My boyfriend and I have been together for nearly a decade and we love the shit out of each other. We're best friends, we fuck like wildcats, and we make each other laugh harder than anybody else can. So what's the trouble? Weeeeelll as I'm sure you can imagine, ONE of us **cough**me**cough** is fat. I've got a good 45 lbs to lose on a 5'5"" frame and (and this part is important) I've been needing to lose it for at least 4 years. 
He on the other hand, has a wonderful body. No six-pack abs or anything, but he looks damn good and doesn't really have to worry about what he eats. (the bastard!) 

Anyway (and dear god if anyone is still reading THANK YOU and I'll try to zip this up real quick like) we had some weird fight just moments ago and during said fight he started to say ""I've just been really angry and upset for a long time..."" and then stopped dead. I immediately knew that i had to get it out of him, whatever it was that he was about to say. It took a good 10 minutes of prodding and then it came out.

He's been upset and angry for years and years that I haven't done anything to try and lose the weight. He doesn't want to be with someone that might die early, he wants me to be healthy and he's been really REALLY frustrated that I've made these 'grand proclamations' so many times (and yes, I admit it- I have made those claims) and then it just falls through and I go back to my old ways.

This crushed me to hear. It crushed me. I'm starting to cry again just thinking about it. BUT. But I'm glad he said it. It was hard for him to say because he knew it was going to hurt my feelings, and it did.... but it only hurt my feelings because it's SO FUCKING TRUE. And it's soooooooooooOOOOOOooooo embarrassing... I'm letting him down, I'm letting myself down, and I don't know why it's taken me so long... but I'm thinking that this was my wake-up call... I read people on r/loseit having wake up calls and changing 'for good' and I kept saying ""I wonder if I have to have one of those"" and I'm REALLY hoping that this is mine. I don't want to lose him, and he told me over and over again (in between apologizing over and over) that he loves me and he wants to be with me for the long haul... so what the FUCK am I waiting for?

Anyway. If even one single person read this far I really really really appreciate it. Thank you so much. I just feel alone right now because I can't exactly call up any of my friends and say ""So Frank (not his real name, obv) just told me that he's been upset and angry with me for X # of years  for being a fatty and not doing anything about it""... 

*sigh* Alright r/loseit .... it's my time to fucking dive in and do this shit. Sorry for the wall!

**TL;DR** My boyfriend of nearly a decade just divulged that despite loving me more than anything he's been angry/upset with me for *years* because I need to lose a significant amount of weight and have only made a bunch of empty proclamations and false starts. 

[**Edit** To add a few things: 1.) You guys, each and every one of you, are fucking amazing and I am *so* thankful for r/loseit. I'm sitting here reading through these posts and welling up with tears, THANK YOU SO MUCH. 
2.) A few folks have (understandably) questioned my SO's level of support and I think I fucked that up in how I wrote parts of the above post. He's SUPER supportive and has been for years- every time I've mentioned losing weight, etc he's been right there cheering me on, offering to go grocery shopping and go on walks- which is a part of why he's so frustrated that I never take him up on it. I know I used the word 'angry' but I probably should have said ""extremely frustrated and upset"" instead. I apologize for giving some people the wrong idea. 3.) I really want to respond to everyone that's being so nice as to comment, but I might fall asleep half way through. NOT like this is some fancy AMA or anything- I just really appreciate people writing stuff and I would love to write back.
4.) (FUCK this is a long edit- sorry!) I may have been put into action by his statements tonight, but I mainly want to lose the weight for me first. I've wanted to for years and years but just fell into that cycle of ""Feel like shit so I eat, which makes me feel like shit, so I..."" and so on.

THANK YOU AGAIN!]

http://imgur.com/hFo2Hzg,ZtMNltd#1

So how? I started really basic, just cut out the obvious crap I KNEW I shouldn't be eating but always found excuses for. I started drinking nothing but water and took my dog for walks everyday. After a few weeks I was already seeing results so the motivation just kept snowballing. I discovered the loseit Reddit which led me to myfitnesspal.com and I started calorie counting. I consumed around 1200 calories a day. I didn't cut any food groups from my diet. I believe in everything in moderation (This includes cupcakes). 
 I have never been to a gym but I lived a sedentary life before and now I walk as much as possible, I go for hikes on weekends. It's really simple but all you need to really do is eat less/better and move more. 

Loosing this weight and changing my lifestyle was the best thing I have ever done for myself. I feel so much healthier. My energy levels have dramatically improved, I breathe easier, I move easier, everyday tasks don't feel like a struggle anymore. But by far the biggest change has been mental. My self-esteem was so low before and I didn't even realize at the time. I hated myself, I didn't feel worthy of love, friendship or attention. I didn't think I mattered. Since loosing my weight I finally got the courage to move forward in my career and asked for a promotion (I got it). My relationship with my partner greatly improved. He has been my greatest support through all this and I'm happy to say we got engaged last month. I can't wait to look and feel beautiful in my wedding dress.

Last week, I officially hit my goal. 6'0"", 372-200 lbs, story and pics included.",1490,261,241,http://www.reddit.com/r/loseit/comments/14v14j/11_months_and_almost_175_pounds_ago_i_decided_i/,"Hi, everybody. I've posted my progress a couple of times, but they've been pretty straightforward and matter-of-fact. Now that I've hit my goal, I'll attempt to tell my story, which might be a bit shoddy and long-winded, so just bear with me.


Anyway, for starters, all my life, I've been [a big ol' boy.](http://imgur.com/602uc) I mean...no, seriously, [I was huge,](http://imgur.com/PgYVE) to the point where it - *points at username* - quite literally defined who I was. It's not like there was any secret to why I was so big; when I'd stroll into Buffalo Wild Wings and casually down 25 wings, half a cup of ranch dressing, a large order of potato wedges smothered in shredded cheese, and six 20-ounce servings of Coke (about 6,000 Calories in a single sitting, for those who weren't counting), what else was I going to be *but* massive? 


I knew what I was, but for the most part, I didn't really care. I'd found my niche - the ""fat guy"" of the group, the one who always kept the rest of the guys entertained. That sort of role comes with a price, though. More often than not, I'd find that I wasn't producing smiling faces with any sort of wit or personality. I was simply the butt of everybody's jokes. I tried to pretend that it never fazed me, but [I found myself quite unhappy,](http://imgur.com/EEvuh) oftentimes [visibly so.](http://imgur.com/dsX1B)


Despite my situation, however, any attempts I made to change were halfhearted at best. I still don't know if I'd fallen into a submissive state of acceptance with my state of being or was just too lazy to get off my ass and make a difference, but for the longest time, nothing changed. I let myself spiral farther and farther out of control until I crept dangerously close to the 400-pound mark.


I'm still a little ashamed that it took as long as it did for something in my head to finally click, but at that point, it finally did. As much as it scared me to see the dial on the scale turn and land on the big ol' 372 (no digital numbers staring at me; those would error out), I think what really drove it home was all the small aspects of being morbidly obese adding up and staring me in the face. I mean...you can only wake up so many mornings with a painfully sore throat from snoring the night away, walk up so many flights of stairs and find yourself hopelessly winded, break so many pieces of furniture, be laughed off of so many roller coasters after the restraints won't fit, listen to the awkward silence and look into your friends' eyes after a lighthearted jeer about your weight and feel the air of seriousness and legitimate concern hiding ever-so-conspicuously behind that harmless little joke, and - this one probably hurts the most - spend so many nights lying in bed alone, knowing that it'll be all you'll ever know because nobody wants any business romantically with a slob with no drive or ambition before you finally force an ultimatum upon yourself.


At least that's what I did. I left myself with a choice: change now and dig myself out of the early grave I was sitting in or just give up on actually living a wholesome life. Instead of sitting around and wallowing in my misery like I'd done so many years before, I made some...compromises, so to speak. 5-10 thousand calories a day? Yeah, that had to go. I took it a little overboard at first. I mean...I had the right idea, at least, by cutting out all of my liquid calories and sweets and adopting whole grains, lean meats, and veggies like it was a new religion, but I was limiting myself to about 1,000 calories a day, and that shit wasn't working very well. I still felt drained and awful like I did before, but it was a different kind of drained and awful; I didn't feel gross and huge, just...starved. Anyway, I increased my intake to a happy 1500-1800 calories per day, and that seemed to hold me over pretty well.


With the dietary front covered, I moved onto exercise. I knew that I stood no chance of gaining muscle with the caloric deficit I was running, so I wrote that off as a lost cause for the time being and decided I'd run a strict regimen of cardio. I tried to start off with running, but after a mere 30 seconds out on the track in a pair of massive jeans, a completely worn-out pair of tennis shoes, and a 370-plus-pound frame to haul around, I learned pretty quick that I passed square one somewhere along the way. So I went back to the drawing board to figure out what the hell I could do. Being too poor for a treadmill, an exercycle, or even a gym membership, I decided that I'd start things off locked away in my bedroom doing nothing but jumping jacks and crunches. At first, just a single set of 25 jumping jacks and 50 crunches had me wanting to die, but for the next month and a half, I grinded away, listened to my skin flap and smack and smack and flap...until jumping jacks were relatively simple.


Alright, cool, phase one was through. Now maybe I could give running another shot, I thought. Well, I was...kind of right. I donned a pair of athletic shorts and a pair of tennis shoes in somewhat better shape and gave it another go. After almost two months of preparation for this big moment, about how long was I able to run before becoming too winded to continue? About...


50 seconds.


Well, shit. Yeah, it was gonna take a bit of practice to whip myself into legitimate running shape, and practice I did. The progress was slow as all get-out, working my way from 50-second heats to a minute, to a minute and a half, to two, then getting ambitious and trying five, only to gas out and puke all over the place, then working back in 30-second increments until I actually *reached* five-minute heats, then a mile, then a 5K, until after about 9 months of busting total ass, I ran my first 10K. Actually conquering my sense of sloth and becoming a physically active person was something I'd written off in the past as impossible, but after a ton of work, I'd done it.


As for the weight loss itself? The numbers shed off in droves at first; losing 20 pounds in a month was easy for the first four, but it slowed down eventually. As for the cosmetic effect? Yeah, [it also came along.](http://imgur.com/GbkVD) Slowly at first, then [a little bit more,](http://imgur.com/Qhkl0) then [more](http://imgur.com/pyck6) and [more](http://imgur.com/XfI23) until I reached the point where for the first time, the change was so drastic that [I barely even recognized myself in a photo.](http://imgur.com/kQpVi)


Anyway, I fought and fought, slipped, stumbled, fell, picked myself back up again, made small victories and passed huge milestones time and time again, and other-miscellaneous-verbed it up until [I finally reached the goal](http://imgur.com/zbTL7) I'd set myself all those months ago. The actual stats are as follows:


**Height:** 6'0"" (about 183 cm)

**Starting weight:** 372 lbs (168.7 kg)

**Current weight:** 199.6 lbs (90.54 kg)

**Shirt size:** Down from 4XL to M

**Pant size:** Down from 48"" waist to 32""


I feel like I'd actually accomplished this a long time ago, but now that the numbers officially show it, I can say with absolute certainty that after letting my weight completely control me, I've finally broken free, and my life is finally my own. There's no greater feeling in the world than knowing that. As a final note, here are a couple more before/after pics.

My name is Noah, I'm 27 and I currently reside in Oregon. I'd like to tell you a little story about my weight loss Journey.
I've been a big guy all my life, teased from the day I entered Kindergarten all the way through Highschool. About two years ago I started having health issues, My feet were swelling, family was starting to get worried about me having a stroke or heart-attack. I'd be out of breath just going up a single flight of stairs. So I decided to do something about it. I ended up joining Jenny Craig, Thinking ""Hell, I'll be on this for about a month or so."" but that month turned into two, which turned into 6 which then turned into a routine and true lifestyle change. When I started dieting I did very light exercise. I would walk a half mile down and up the road I live on. exhausted, covered in sweat. taking multiple breaks and barely breathing by the time I was finished.
as time passed and weight began to drop I found myself not-so-fatigued by the half mile walk. so I decided to start jogging. and well, long story short..Now I have a gym membership, do 45 minutes minimum of cardio 5 days a week, see a personal trainer 3 days a week for resistance and weight training take whey-bolic proteins and supplements and have energy through the roof. I'm doing the damn' thing.~ It's always fun to walk by someone I haven't seen in a few years and have them not even notice me. I've added a few links to before...before/after...after pictures for you to checkout. If anyone has any questions feel free to ask. I'm just excited to share the current results. 

From what I've seen by reading posts you guys are all kickin' butt. keep up the good work.

-Noah.

I didn't want to submit to /r/loseit until I was 125 and bikini ready, but I seem to be reverting back to some old habits--no calorie counting! no exercising! oh my!--and I thought posting some of my most embarrassing and most accomplished photos would motivate me to finish my last lap, so to speak. I hope you don't mind all the photos or text! Each picture has become a bit of a powerful testimonial for me, and, alas, I don't know how to make a long story short.

I was a slender lady until I became pregnant with my amazing and awesome son in 2008 while a junior in college. I gained about 25 lbs once the dust settled--from 125 to 150. I had gained a very attractive turkey neck, to boot. And then my life took a bit of a turn shortly after. Among the hole of personal problems I fell into, we became homeless;  then my significant other joined the military as a last resort, spiriting us across the country once time in boot camp and school was done. I had a really, really hard time adjusting to being a young mom and wife, alone and out of an academic atmosphere, and so, when I became pregnant with my fantastic daughter in 2010, I ballooned. My house was a mess, my self control was a mess, my relationship with my husband and myself was a mess. I think my misery and dissatisfaction with myself and my life is pretty evident in any pictures of me at the time. 

When my husband deployed to Iraq in the spring of 2011, shortly after our daughter was born, I spent some time out of the doldrums and despair of Army life with my family across country. It wasn't until then that I realized how much weight I had gained, and how much emotional baggage and how many bad habits I was lugging around. I had finally gotten some much needed time to regroup after a few years of total chaos, and the impact it had on my self esteem and weight loss was tremendous. I'm sure many of you can speak to having phases of weight loss, and at this point in my life, I was pumped to lose weight, but I didn't have the self discipline yet. I was simmering.

So my husband gets back in the summer of 2012, and not long afterward, I have a slew of mystery symptoms. I'm in and out of the ER and the office of specialists, and I start worrying myself to death. I can't eat, I can't sleep. I realized I had lost a little bit of weight and asked for treatment for anxiety around the same time, and I think that hot mess, compounded with the anti-depressant, was what truly galvanized my weight loss. There was this pivotal moment where I was at the park with my kids after the specialist told me it was likely I had both MS and Chron's disease (neither of which I have, I was just suffering from a sensitive vasovagal response), and my kids were hopping around giggling, and something dead in me just came to life, and I climbed up the jungle gym and hung from the monkey bars and balanced on the railroad ties with them and knew that I wanted to hang on to that fearless joy and wear it like a shield. And the secret to my weight loss was that I kept rediscovering it in the small accomplishments of weight loss. 

I just kind of slipped into healthy habits, although I did do it cold turkey. Once I severed my emotional ties to comfort eating and defiantly sitting on the couch, and started finding enjoyment in squats and plain yogurt (I'm being flippant, of course), the road paved itself. 

I stopped drinking pop--I was a several Dr. Peppers a day kind of gal--and started guzzling water. I stopped eating my two bowls of ice cream a night and started eating my veggies. Really, my road to weight loss was very textbook; I just had to get through all the starts and stops of it to finally arrive. I took my kids for a walk each day and hit up my pretty piss poor neighborhood gym while my kids frolicked in the play room. Also, bodyweight exercises at home and Wii Just Dance (I am by no means a good dancer and would melt into an embarrassed puddle if anyone saw me dancing--but I can attribute a good chunk of my weight loss to flopping around to 'Party Rock'). I found that I love to eat nutritiously--the look on my husband's face when I brought home kale and then promptly inhaled it with lip-smacking relish-- and my body made it easier by seeming to crave it once I started exercising. I lost my taste for soda pop and sweets and snacked on small meals throughout the day (emphasis on veggies, whole grains, and protein). Small portions and stopping when I felt a little full, even if it means I'm in the kitchen again in half an hour, tremendously helped shrink my top heavy, bloated apple shape. Now I pout if I can't manage to fit in some exercise into my day, even if it is just doing lunges down the hall flailing my arms for a few minutes a day while my kids scream and run away in mock terror.  

TL; DR I found the self control and self esteem I so badly needed through nutritious eating and exercise. Or vice versa.

p.s. Oh! I lost ten inches off my waist and bust and went from a 40H to a 32DD! I don't want to dissolve into a fit of tears when I'm trying on clothes! And I poop regularly! Yay!

How? Diet, almost entirely. And some retraining. I was sick and fixed my problems with food... which is better than, say, drugs, alcohol, sex, shopping, gambling, etc... but if you fix them with food all you get is fat. If you fix them with shopping you might end up with a new macbook. Sigh. 


Whenever I was tempted, I reminded myself that every little thing counts. That made it easier to stay focused. I count calories and reign in carbs, sticking to things like sweet potatoes and beans, rather than rice or pastas. I walk alot when it's warm enough for me to do so. I guess now I have to start exercising in earnest. Lifting weights! Doing squats! Eating oats! Lawyer Up! Quit Facebook! Join a gym! (wait, wait, too far! Abort! Stop at the oats!).

**Edit**

Thanks for all the kind words!  I wanted to add a few details about what we are doing, sorry for missing that guideline originally, had meant for a quick motivational post but wanted to answer the questions in one place...

**Nutrition**

We have had the most success with eating Paleo and generally following the principals in the Whole 30 (this book is an absolute must have IMHO).  We eat real food (meat, nuts, fruits, veggies, and oils) and rarely deviate much from that eating plan.  We sill have treat meals but feel so crappy afterwards it's usually not worth it.  Also, when you eat this way, after a while weighing food really doesn't matter because you become highly sensitive to what your body actually needs.  We also prep food for the week which really helps (added a picture above)
    

**Fitness**

My wife lost most of her weight without a strict workout plan...eating right did the trick for her, fat just melted off, it was crazy.  She has now started crossfit with me which is awesome!  I have been crossfitting for almost 2 years now, but I didn't see great results physique-wise until I cleaned up my diet.  I also have to eat Zoned meals to keep up with the intensity of the workouts, but I only eye ball the portions.  


Let me know if you guys/gals have any other questions, or feel free to pm me! ",,False,,t5_2rz8w,1363636488.0,,100lbs,True,t3_1aj2on,http://www.reddit.com/r/loseit/comments/1aj2on/pics_family_photos_look_better_without_the_extra/,
1355770645.0,1161,self.loseit,15081q,Top 10 fat loss foods for me.,1421,260,305,http://www.reddit.com/r/loseit/comments/15081q/top_10_fat_loss_foods_for_me/,"What's up winners, today is the day I am 148 pounds. I was 198 pounds on exactly October 3rd of this year. (M 5'9"" , 18 years old). It feels good, and what's helped me if seeing all these progress pics on r/loseit and r/keto. So, I have to return the favor by bringing you a list of food and reasons why they helped me lose a lot of weight.

**DISCLAIMER:** I'm a firm believer of a high fat, moderate protein, low*ish* carbohydrate diet. Be prepared.

1. **Eggs**
     
     This is seriously a miracle food. I have had eggs almost everyday for breakfast. Some people say to throw out the yolk, but in my honest opinion that is one of the worst mistakes you can make while dieting. They are so dense in micro nutrients and keep you so full you're not even hungry when it's lunch time! They're so easy to make, just boil em' mash em' or stick em' in a stew. And if you think dietary fat and cholesterol contributes to heart disease...well, you're on reddit and you're informed so you won't think like that. Don't believe me? That's good, it makes you skeptical. I like that. [Here's](http://www.sott.net/article/242516-Heart-Surgeon-Speaks-Out-On-What-Really-Causes-Heart-Disease) an article that a doctor wrote on how he basically said he was wrong for years.

2. **Apples** (with peanut/almond butter)

     Even though I was on a ketogenic diet, I had apples before a weight lifting session. They're on the low glycemic spectrum, and even lower if you add fat with it. If you want a good snack, add some peanut or almond butter (almond butter is healthier, better monounsaturated fat to polyunsaturated fat ratio) to lower your insulin and blood sugar levels and stabilize them. If they're stable, so is your appetite.

3. **Walnuts**

     Possibly the best nut out there. ([This article is self-explanatory](http://www.lisajohnsonfitness.com/walnuts-proclaimed-the-healthiest-nut/)) Just go easy on the portion sizes, have no more than one ounce at a time. But they are very filling so you shouldn't worry too much about that.

4. **Salmon** and other fatty fish, like Mackerel.

     Everyone's heard the big buzz about fish oil and omega-3 supplementation, but if you eat salmon a few times a week, you'll get great results. If you're not a fish person, you're missing out! But still, fish oil supplementation will do the trick...I guess. I eat Salmon right before bed it gives me a nice warm feeling, it's truly great.

5. **Ground beef** 

     I make burgers (minus the bun), cook chilli (minus the beans), and a nice stir fry with onions, peppers, and carrots with a good amount of beef in there. There are studies out there showing the fat in beef may raise testosterone levels, and that's good, even if you're a woman.

6. **Turkey Bacon**

    I would eat regular bacon, but my parents are Muslim, so that's a no-no. It's a low calorie food (70 calories in two slices) and is decently filling. It has the perfect 1:1 protein to fat ratio, it's great!

7. **Chicken Breast**

    A cheap protein source when your protein that day is low but you don't have much room for calories. I put olive oil in a pan and but it on low. Put a lid on it, come back 20 minutes later, and it's a nice, tender, juicy chicken breast steak. If you grill your chicken breast on medium, or even high heat *gasp*, you're asking for dry chicken.

8. **Whey Protein** You can go on and on about the amino acid profile in this, but the way I look at it is that it's a cheap protein source. At [bodybuilding.com](http://www.bodybuilding.com) it's very cheap compared to GNC or Vitamin Shoppe. I like Optimum Nutrition Gold Standard 100% whey protein. It's just convenient. Do the calculations for the cost/gm per protein and you'll notice it's cheaper than chicken breast. Whoa, right.

9. **Spinach and Kale**

    Seriously, I cook this with everything. Put it in eggs for breakfast, throw in a cup of it in a salad, do whatever! It's high in electrolytes (potassium), and this is important when dieting to prevent you from being light headed all of the time and prevent muscle cramps at night. Kale is the most micronutrient dense green vegetable out there. One cup has 10% Calcium, 170% Vitamin A, and a lot of Vitamin C which makes eating fruit obsolete. 

10. **Yams**

    Even though I'm a low-carb guy, I still have sweet potato fries or a boiled yam before a heavy workout to keep me lifting my weights. Before I dieted my bench press was 210, now it's 180. I know for a fact if I didn't eat properly my bench would've been at 135 lbs. And I would've been mad, and I should be mad. Lots of vitamins in this stuff and more filling than potatoes (potatoes = sugar).

Hope this helped, take care, and good luck!

I put on a lot of weight whilst I was at university. Just the lifestyle of sleeping in late, eating rubbish and just generally being unhappy with how things were. I had depression which would lead to choosing to stay in bed late rather than getting out there and looking after myself. I'm 174cm, 5'8"", and ended up at 115kg, 250lb.
A year ago I realised that I was wasting my life, abusing my body and not owning up to my potential, so I joined a new gym with a personal trainer, started watching my diet, aiming for around 1200-1500 calories a day, and talked to my doctor. After getting a clean bill of health and being told to consider lap band surgery I thought I would give this one really big effort, get my shit together and stop making excuses. Ive found excuses are the biggest pitfall. Thinking I didnt have time to exercise, my appetite was too big to diet, or this is just the way I am meant to be was holding me back.
My motto is to take care with the small decisions, they all pile up. Choosing water over a bottle of coke, choosing to work out rather than lay in bed. The easy choice may feel good at the time but ultimately I ended up feeling rubbish and getting down about not putting my health first.
A year later I am 30kg lighter, 85kg or 184lb. I still want to lose another 10kg, and I still say yes to chocolate far too much, but I have developed good habits, and changed my mentality to putting my health above the easy and bad choice.

So I'm out for my afternoon walk, just listening to music, having a good time, when suddenly I hear a faint ""Fatass"" shouted from the window of your truck as it passed. My music was pretty loud so I wasn't completely sure I heard you right, but I didn't really care either way so I just kept on walking. Apparently you wanted to make sure I heard your important message, because a few minutes later you graciously took the time out of your day to turn around, drive past me again slowly, and have your passenger open his door and lean out so that I would be sure to hear him shout ""You're fucking fat!"" before you sped off.

First of all, no shit Sherlock. You think it's news to me that I'm fat? You think maybe I didn't know, that I needed to be warned so I could do something about it? A blind person could see that I'm fat. People have been telling me that I was fat since grade school, and many of them found much more inventive and hurtful ways to say it than you. You weren't even original, despite having a fair amount of time to think of something interesting to say. Next time you could at least think of something creative.

But the real reason I wanted to write was because you got me thinking. What is it that offends you so much? Is it really my unsightly girth that bothers you? If so, why would you want to try to discourage me from exercising? I could see shouting insults at me if I were say, eating ice cream. It would still be unproductive and childish, but at least there would be some logic to it. But why shout at me for walking? If you really hate fat people I would think you would be cheering me on, trying to encourage me to lose that weight so there would be one less whale in the world to bother you.

Instead, you chose to make a rather lame attempt at shaming and upsetting me. You seem to want me to be so upset by the fear of criticism and perhaps even physical violence that I will give up on exercising and go drown my sorrows in ice cream. It seems counter-productive to say the least.

Which is why I've come to realize, it's not my weight that really bothers you, it's seeing me taking active steps to lose it. I don't usually hear this while going about my normal day, only while exercising. Only while exercising have I gotten rude comments, honked horns, and trash thrown at my head. It doesn't seem to be my fat that makes people turn into assholes, only my attempts at losing it. So why is it that seeing a fat person trying to be healthier causes you such rage?

Perhaps you secretly have a thing for fat women, and you're so terrified of your brosephs finding out that you feel the need to mask your true desires with hate, while at the same time lamenting the fact that women as hot as me are trying to lose the weight. Or perhaps you just need to be able to feel superior to fat people in order to feel good about yourself, and a fat person actually taking control of their lives and their bodies makes it harder for you to see us as less than human.

Whatever your reasoning, it doesn't matter. I am not discouraged. I am not afraid. I've suffered plenty of pain and humiliation in my life, they don't scare me any more. You don't scare me. Not even death scares me. The only thing that scares me is living one more second of my life by anybody else's rules. I'm done with that. It's my life, and I will live it the way I want to live it. If I want to go for a walk, I will go for a walk. If I want to eat cake, I will eat cake. If I want to stuff my fat ass into a bikini and parade it around the beach, then by god that's what I'm going to do and you can deal with it or go to hell.

Today, I worked a full day at a job I love, taught lessons to my homeschooled step-son, cooked a tasty and nutritious meal for my family, washed and folded 4 loads of laundry, did a load of dishes, tried a new ab-buster workout video, walked 4 miles, and wrote this essay, all on less than 1400 calories. Today I lived the life I want to live. What did you do today? Oh yeah, that's right, you went out of your way to provide me with more inspiration for the book that I'm writing. Thank you for that.

Love,
Fatass

Edit : So I got asked about my diet and routine. So here it is.

Well all I did was count my calories.  I was doing about 1200-1400 a day with the occasional cheat day. I basically stopped drinking except for going out once a month with friends. I didn't eat any fast food. I can count on one hand how many times I have eaten at a fast food joint (excluding subway) since January.  Oh and I would have a protein shake every workout day. I ate tons of protein and cut back on carbs (not cut them out, eff that carbs are awesome).

My exercise routine was 5 days a week. Every day I did heavy cardio. Stair climber at fast speeds, high resistances on the elliptical, and running on the track. Usually about 30-45 minutes a day of that.  I judged my workout intensity by listening to my body, so basically I was **DRENCHED** with sweat for that 30-45 minutes.  After that I would do weights. 
Monday - Arms
Tuesday - Straight cardio so about an hour of that
Wednesday - Core exercises
Thursday - Chest and Back (yeah its weird to super set with them)
Friday - Legs. 

I am big fan of doing body weight exercises because to me that is straight strength. Being able to move your body like that is awesome. So lots of chin ups, pull ups, push ups, sit ups, squats. I also do free weights and cable machines but more free weights. Cable machines help with a lot of back stuff.

Edit: So, I need to tell how I did this.
I had the Gastric Sleeve surgery a little over 3 months ago. I began this round of weight loss a little over a year ago.
I am on a strict low calorie, high protein diet.I don't like to discuss my surgery with people because I have had a lot of negative responses especially from family. I've been told I'm ""cheating"" and that I was just lazy.

So, here's my exercise routine:
Monday through Friday:
I arrive at work 1 1/2 hours early and walk 3+ miles on my treadmill desk at 3.5 to 4 mph at an 8% incline.
At lunch I walk my dog (yup, I get to bring my dog to work) for another 3 miles through the city (weather permitting. If I can't do it due to weather, I do the treadmill again).
M, W, F:
I run in the evening when I get home. About 1/2 hour. I am doing the Couch to 5k program and am almost done. I generally do about 2.5 miles and am getting a little further every time.
Weekends:
I play basketball with the kids, hike and generally avoid the couch.
Soon I will be adding strength training.

At my last check in with my doctor about 2 weeks ago, I was told that where I am currently is what they would expect for somebody at 1 year post surgery. Again,  I am at 3 months.
So, while I did have the surgery, I have been working my butt off (pun intended) to lose and improve my health. I like to tell people that I haven't cheated, I've just crammed all the suffering into a much shorter period.

The first picture was taken around 265 lbs in September 2011. The new one was taken today at 167.2 lbs.

I lost the first 60 lbs on my own, cutting out junk food, fried food, and soda, and reducing portion size. It took about 10 months (Dec 2011-Oct 2011.) I then plateued and even started to gain through January. 

At the end of January I started the weight management program at my doctor's office called HMR. It's a very strict high protein, low carb diet with shakes, oatmeals, soups, puddings, snack bars, and microwave entrees. Since then, I've lost another 35 lbs. I've also been exercising fairly regularly and have walk/jogged three 5K races!

Just wanted to say thanks and to share my story to encourage others! Reading all of the success stories on here really made a difference!

About 9 months ago, I was 310 pounds, unhealthy, and unhappy. I was getting delivery multiple times a week, didn't care about my well-being, and was letting myself slip even worse than normal. I have always been a bigger kid, but this was different. I stepped on the scale for the first time in a while, and was shocked at what I saw. I never thought I would be the kid over 300 pounds.

So I decided something had to be done. While at college, I started counting calories only on the weekdays (1,500 a day). The first few weeks were brutal! My stomach was killing me! I kept through it and ended up losing 45 pounds in that last semester.

Once summer hit, I decided that I would count calories everyday and make eating healthily a lifestyle (1,200-1,500 a day). I also started running, swimming, and lifting weights with a friend in my garage. I went to Goodwill and bought weights for real cheap, along with the decently priced CytoSport protein powder from Costco. Through the summer, I lost another 45 pounds, reaching my original goal of being 220 pounds.

Now, I'm back at school for my last year and have been continuing eating right while working the college life back into my routine. My goal ended up changing. This morning I weighed myself and I was at 199.8 pounds! I can't even begin to tell you what was going through my mind 9 months ago. WHY DIDN'T I DO THIS SOONER?!?!? WHAT WAS I THINKING?!?!? I'm loving life and will continue to shape my body at my desired goal weight of 190.

For all of you discouraged on how long it's going to take, DON'T BE! Yeah, it might take a while, but you're going to let THAT stop you? Like the change! Embrace it! Feed on it! Your life is about to start! You are strong! Prove to yourself that you can do anything! I would love to answer questions for those that want to know more or want encouragement. No judgements! I would also enjoy hearing what has worked for you and maybe your tips on tightening up skin. 

Thank you, r/Loseit, for all of your support. Your stories inspired me and I hope mine inspires you. Go out and live for the first time!

Now:  170.2 bw, M or L shirts depending on the brand, 32"" pants.

I've posted a few times along the way but I slacked off for a while.  I hit a plateau some time around june and started tracking my calories with myfitnesspal (hadn't done that for the first year) and was able to kick start things again.  For the last month few weeks I've been down to 1200 calories per day and, a month or two prior to that was around 1400.  Yesterday, 16 months and 9 days after I started on the Paleo diet (and Crossfit two weeks later), I have lost over 50% of my bodyweight.  I went from barely being able to walk a half mile without losing my breath to high 7/low 8 minute miles, multiple unassisted dead hang pullups, 37.5"" box jump, 435 pound dead lifts, 325 pound squats, 200 pound cleans and I am in the best shape of my life.  

I was overweight my entire life (for as long as I can remember) and, several years ago whenever my (soon to be ex) wife and I were living with her parents and I had a bit more income I, with the help of a personal trainer, lost ~118 pounds.  I stopped there and, for various reasons including loss of motivation, personal issues and my mom developing pancreatic cancer which resulted in 6-8 months of fast food and restaurant food while were in and out of hospitals, I gained 119 pounds.  I went from 339.X to 222.x to my highest of 340.8.  

A few months before June of last year I'd been talking to a friend in the USPSA (competition pistol) community about the paleo diet and crossfit.  I did a good bit of research and found a crossfit gym near my home so I gave myself a goal.  If I was able to eat clean for two weeks I'd go and join.  Well, I did.  

It's been a long, rocky journey that has changed my life more than I ever thought possible.  I finally have confidence, courage, drive, determination, etc.  

As far as the ""how,"" I think most of it was already answered but I was on about 85-90% paleo for most of it (still using the occasional protein shake, protein bars, etc).  I go to Crossfit 4-5 days per week and follow my box's programming.  

Anyway, I think I've talked enough.  Here are some before pictures and some fairly recent ones.

Edit: I am reading each and every one of your comments and it makes me feel so good to know that I've been an inspiration to some of you and that I have a great community behind me wishing me well in my journey. You guys are awesome!

EDIT EDIT: My post was removed because I did not include in my post information about how I am achieving this weight loss. I would be happy to share with you all my routine! Four months ago I was completely sedentary and binged on junk food daily. I ballooned almost 40 pounds over the summer. At the beginning of August I finally got to a point where I was disgusted with myself and decided I need to make a change. I started out small by getting a gym membership and visiting a couple times a week. You can guess that my weight didn't change much during that month because I was still binging often. Around mid September, I stumbled on the Body Transformation Fitness Challenge and decided to enter the competition. That began on September 12th 2012 and I weighed in at 260 pounds. Here is the link to my introduction post: http://www.reddit.com/r/BTFC/comments/znq95/introduction_19f51260_advanced_start_september/ 

Since beginning the challenge in September I have changed my diet completely. What used to consist of one meal a day, eating junk and sugary crap, has now turned into a relatively balanced diet. For breakfast I typically eat cereal, either Kashi Go Lean or Cracklin' Oat Bran with skim milk. For lunch I typically eat turkey sandwiches on wheat bread along with apples or baked chips. For dinner I typically eat grilled chicken or turkey burgers with salad or carrots or some type of vegetables (that I force myself to eat because I don't enjoy them). For snacking I eat a lot of either fruits and veggies and granola bars. I have gone from drinking almost no water to usually 5 to 7 bottles a day (or refills of my water bottle anyway). I have not given up my one vice, Diet Soda. I'm not saying that it has helped my weight loss, of course it hasn't, but I've been able to lose while keeping the Diet Coke as a part of my options. I did cut back on the amount I drank though. Before I drank probably three a day and now I only drink one.

Okay on to exercise. This has been my biggest change. I used to sit at home and watch tv all night. In September I joined a the YMCA in my town and have been going almost everyday since. I work out almost every day without fail. I start my gym routine by using this machine: http://www.precor.com/en-us/home/products/amt/amt-835-with-open-stride-adaptive-motion-trainer at it's highest resistance, 20, for an hour. On top of that I typically run/walk on the treadmill for 20-30 mins. Recently I have started adding in a little bit of weight training, just simple 5 pound dumbbells. I have pretty much kept this up for the entire three months, the only changes I've made is to increase the speed and length at which I run for. 

I hope this is enough information to help some of you in your own weight loss journeys :)",,True,,t5_2rz8w,1354696472.0,,40lbs,True,t3_149jag,http://www.reddit.com/r/loseit/comments/149jag/another_20_pounds_down_and_it_took_another_set_of/,

Hey all,  just wanted to give a shout out to say you CAN not only lose more than half of your weight, but you can also KEEP IT OFF.

This was not my first rodeo.  I lost over 100 lbs in my 20s and gained it all back plus almost 100 more.  :-/  This time I was DETERMINED from the beginning not to have to do this again, so I made a deep commitment to learn everything I could about maintenance before I reached goal.

Here's how I got it off:

- I ate a LOT of protein (100-150g minimum) and very little starchy carbs or fats. 
- For much of the first year when I lost 160 I ate between 1000-1200 calories per day.  (In hindsight I don't recommend this, as my hair grew kind of thin.)
- I tracked my weight at [physicsdiet.com](http://physicsdiet.com/) because I liked the moving average weight tracker.  Eventually I moved to my own Google spreadsheet based on the same [Hacker's Diet](http://www.fourmilab.ch/hackdiet/) principles.
- I kept a [spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0Au5Li0CuTA4qcklULV9DZEJaMnRVZU1VeFE3VEctMUE#gid=0) where I recorded little milestones.  I gave myself a [non-food reward](http://www.planetbuff.com/shop-buffs.html) every time I removed another 5% of my weight.
- I [weighed EVERYTHING I ate](http://www.sparkpeople.com/mypage_public_journal_individual.asp?blog_id=2588275).
- I started by just walking around the block after dinner.  Once I had about 40 lbs off I added water aerobics.  Once I had 70 off I switched to spinning.
- I did a LOT of cardio (spin) and bodypump classes.  (usually at least one per day)  I have arthritis in one knee (from an injury when I was a teenager) so no running or high impact stuff for me.

Here's how I'm keeping it off:

- I eat [roughly equal proportions of my calories in protein, fat, and non-starchy carbs](http://www.fatsecret.com/diets/member-diet/Default.aspx?dietid=4355344).
- I still track everything I eat.  I use [LoseIt](http://loseit.com).
- I try to get about 400 calories burned per day on my HR monitor - some days are more, some are less, and some are rest days, but in general that's the amount I shoot for.
- I do a mixture of cardio (cycling, XC skiing, [white water kayaking](http://www.sparkpeople.com/mypage_photo_gallery_enlarge.asp?id=3583414), extreme sea kayaking, horseback riding), lifting ([NROL4W](http://www.amazon.com/New-Rules-Lifting-Women-Goddess/dp/1583333398) at the moment), and yoga to hit endurance, strength, and flexibility
- I [reward myself](http://www.planetbuff.com/shop-buffs.html) every month that I am within +/- 3% of my central goal weight (150).
- I stay as active as I can with the [group of maintainers at SparkPeople.com](http://teams.sparkpeople.com/maintaining), [wekeepitoff.com](http://wekeepitoff.com), and recently [r/maintenance](http://www.reddit.com/r/maintenance/) to help keep my eyes on the prize and my head in the game.  I underestimated the importance of the mental and emotional aspects of maintenance the first time around.  Now I'm throwing everything I've got at it.

More about maintenance:

- My favorite definition of maintenance is to [stay within +/- 3% of a target goal weight](http://www.sparkpeople.com/mypage_public_journal_individual.asp?blog_id=4924102).
- In practice I actually have [three nested definitions I use](http://www.sparkpeople.com/mypage_public_journal_individual.asp?blog_id=4996985), because I'm still working on getting this maintenance thing right.
- My personal philosophy is that as long as someone has a [BMI between 18 and 30 and is working on body composition](http://www.sparkpeople.com/mypage_public_journal_individual.asp?blog_id=4969568), all is good.
- I've come up with some [creative ways to try and track body composition](http://www.sparkpeople.com/mypage_public_journal_individual.asp?blog_id=4790344).  There are difficulties due to the inaccuracy of the methods I'm using, but I think it might be the best option I've got, since I don't have a DXA machine handy.
- There is now a [Maintenance Hall of Fame](http://www.reddit.com/r/maintenance/wiki/hof) just for the reddit community.  Come check it out.

The general stats on maintenance are terrible.  80% - 95% typically regain depending on the study you read and I believe the regain rates are so bad chiefly due to a lack of information, resources and preparation for folks who get to goal weight.
With better tools and coaching and a willingness to work at it, I believe we can change the odds of success.  I believe it's a [learned skill](http://www.sparkpeople.com/mypage_public_journal_individual.asp?blog_id=4996986).  I'm all about trying to [find and create resources and a community](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1AkUBsUACT7rZ5GsdF7jT9YcD1Xa80VFGiJ5JeUkur8A/pub) for myself and everyone else who wants to keep the weight off for good.

Come see me and the other maintainers at [r/maintenance](http://www.reddit.com/r/maintenance/) or the [SparkPeople.com maintenance team](http://teams.sparkpeople.com/maintaining) or at [wekeepitoff.com](http://wekeepitoff.com) if you have questions or want help!  

It's never too early to start thinking about [how you'll maintain your weight](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1AkUBsUACT7rZ5GsdF7jT9YcD1Xa80VFGiJ5JeUkur8A/pub).

(F/5'4""; 220lbs -&gt; 135lbs; progress pics) [x-post from r/keto]",1318,270,199,http://www.reddit.com/r/loseit/comments/w2l3s/365_days_85_pounds_2ish_pieces_of_advice_f54/,"First, [the progress pictures over the last year](http://imgur.com/a/ZzM0r#0).

Well folks, it’s been exactly one year since I took a good, hard look at myself and decided to reclaim my health. My combination Keto/Paleo diet has honestly been 99% of the reason for my success (as I’ve done virtually zero intentional exercise in the last year), and I cannot thank this subreddit enough for its wisdom and support (in addition to /r/keto and /r/progresspics). Now, if I may be so bold, I’d love to give back:

(The following is advice that I’ve admittedly repeated a few times on reddit, but I’m such a fervent believer of this ideology that I don’t think it can be restated enough. That said, I can only speak for what’s worked for me, so take all this with a grain of salt.)

When you're first starting your journey to better health through fat loss, the thought of losing weight can be extremely daunting. Thinking about how many pounds/kilos you need to lose, or how much time it's going to take to reach your goal weight, or how hard exercising is going to be, can seem really overwhelming (if not almost impossible). It’s easy to get discouraged, easier to just feel like giving up, and, on some days, really fucking hard to get motivated to do anything at all.

If this sounds all too familiar, I recommend something a little unorthodox: Don't make your weight loss journey JUST about reaching a final goal. Before you click ‘send’ on that hatemail, I am not saying that goals are bad. Goals are great and completely necessary. But without actionable, concrete behaviors to support them, goals can be very hard to visualize. If you're anything like me, it's easy to get so caught up in how much farther you have to go, you lose sight of how far you've already gone.

**Part A: Take your weight loss one day at a time.** Trust me, I recognize how stupid and cliché this sounds. But instead of dwelling on how difficult your entire journey is going to be, focus on making it through Today. This is the only thing you have to worry about, ever.

**Part B: Establish daily healthy habits.** Daily habits are tangible things that you can check off of a list. “Lose 85 pounds” is a good goal, but lacks direction on its own. “Drink 1400ml of water a day”, “Eat at or under 1400 calories” and “Complete 20 pushups” are observable, verifiable, reproducible habits.

Armed with these two halves to the ideological whole, I encourage you to take back Today. Today, you are in complete control. Today, you are choosing to stick to pre-defined healthy habits. Not lose X pounds, not fit into size X pants. You are choosing to eat within or under your caloric limit, drink plenty of water, and maybe exercise a little. That's it. No matter how bad you fucked up yesterday or what the scale says after that particularly shameful McDonald’s run, it doesn't matter.

That's right. It doesn't matter what the scale says. You gained a pound since yesterday? No big deal. Your body is a dynamic and surprisingly resilient organism that fluctuates and changes all the time for a variety of reasons. As long as you dedicate yourself to eating within your caloric allotment and staying even just mildly active, the pounds will eventually come off. Yes, your weight might fluctuate from day to day for any number of reasons, but as long as you stick to your habits, the overall trend will be a loss in pounds. Now, if your habits leave you plateauing for a significant amount of time, it’s time to adapt and reevaluate. Learn from your mistakes, don’t dwell on them. 

Maybe it’s just me, but I’m always intrigued by how quickly time goes by. Regardless of whether I ate 3000 calories over my limit or exercised my ass off and ate like a mouse, the world still turns, the sun still rises and sets, and another day gets ticked off the calendar. The hours are going to pass whether I like it or not, and it’s up to me to make the most out of all 24 of them. Every minute is an opportunity to do something great, and every minute you don’t act is an opportunity squandered. 

You are more than just a number on a scale. You are greater than the sum of your cravings. You are a complex and amazing human being, and no matter what you might think, you are in control of your weight loss. Because shit, you can do anything for 24 hours. So why not start now?

Seriously, if I hadn't had stubbled upon this subreddit 9 months ago I have no idea where I would be right now :)


In high school I was a track athlete until my senior year when I completely wrecked my knee. I had to have three surgeries on it and I was pretty much not allowed to put much weight on it for 2.5 years. Within that time I ballooned from a very athletic 160 to 350. Even when my doctors cleared me to start exercising I didn't do it. I would eat crap all the time, even though I knew in the back of my mind it wasn't healthy. 


Flash forward to this past March. I had just gotten back from the doctors and weighed in at 382. It finally hit me: I was less than 20lbs from being a 400lb female. I knew I finally had to get my shit together and get healthier. I was never comfortable in my clothes even though Ive always had confidence, and I was becoming depressed.


So I completely changed my diet. Out was sweets, most sugars, carbs and red meat. I didn't track calories, but thats because I had done it during high school and still knew roughly how many calories were in eggs/4oz of chicken/turkey/veggies. MFP became my lifeline for tracking my weight and getting motivation to keep going. I will admit during the past 9 months I was diagnosed with Crohn's Disease, so it has helped staying away from certain bad foods. Juicing works for me, as either a one/two a day meal replacement (in conjunction with a full meal) or snack, and I have gone through stages of intermittent fasting. As for exercising, I work out 3-5 days a week depending on my school schedule by hitting up the treadmill for 20-40 minutes and weight training. 




**TL:DR - Got super fat after high school, decided to change my life this past March** 


I still have a long way to go, but I will get to my GW of 190.

[42/F/5'2""]",1235,194,100,http://www.reddit.com/r/loseit/comments/1fyadh/progress_pics_10_months_nearly_70_pounds_down/,"[The obligatory progress pic!](http://i.imgur.com/pFXnnJj.jpg)

I started trying to lose in June of 2012, but had little to no luck with the standard low-calorie, low-fat diet.  Luckily, someone turned me on to the Keto way of life, and I began that lifestyle change around August of 2012.  Since then, I have lost nearly seventy pounds, and have gone from a size 26 jeans to between a size 16/18, and from a 3X top to an XL (sometimes a large, especially at Old Navy!)  My boobs did lose a lot as well, and I went from a 46DD to a 40C so far.

For those interested, I do not exercise other than my normal daily routine, due to a severe defect in my left hip that gives me considerable pain.  One of the reasons I am trying to lose weight through diet is so that I can ease the strain on that hip, and hopefully prolong the need for a hip replacement (which the docs have been yelling at my about for the past five years!)

I do not count calories, but I am an avid carb counter, and try to keep my daily carbs below 30g, preferably under 25 grams.  I also watch my portion sizes very carefully.

I'm a very short gal, so seeing the weight loss has taken some time, but I can honestly say that I am finally becoming happy with my body -- something that I haven't been able to say for about 15 years.  I'm now nearly the same size as I was as a senior in high school.

I am no longer pre-diabetic, and I have been off my high blood pressure meds for months.  My blood work is normal, and my cholesterol is in the normal/preferred range.  I have noticed a considerable change in my energy level, plus the headaches I used to have on a weekly basis are no longer an issue.

My goal is more of a size than a weight.  I would like to be around a size 10-12 jeans, and a size medium top.  I really really REALLY just want to be able to fit into the cute clothes outside of the plus size section at Forever 21!!!  :)",,False,,t5_2rz8w,False,,65lbs,True,t3_1fyadh,http://www.reddit.com/r/loseit/comments/1fyadh/progress_pics_10_months_nearly_70_pounds_down/,

_______________________________________________
**How'd I do it?**

* 1. Acquire Motivation

At the start, mine came in the form of furious anger when my girlfriend at the time decided to run over my heart with an 18-wheeler. [How could she say no to this?](http://i.imgur.com/SqDefzn.jpg) I was able to find even more motivation through /r/GetMotivated and my fellow losers at /r/loseit. Seriously, you guys have no idea how much of an impact looking at your transformations helped me! Eventually the anger subsided (after about 3 months) and I was left with new habits breed out of rigorous routine. 

* 2. Fix Your Diet!

When I first began, I thought I could just eat whatever I wanted and go to the gym more. Unfortunately, this is not the case. This is taken straight from the [FAQ](http://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/wiki/faq) on /r/Fitness...
&gt;""Fixing your diet"" means being conscious of what you eat, and how much you eat. The best way to do this is to track your calories for a few weeks - using a calorie tracking application or pen and paper. After you get a handle on what you are eating, it's time to figure out how much you should be eating. To do this, we need to figure out your Total Daily Energy Expenditure, or TDEE (see [here](http://www.freedieting.com/tools/calorie_calculator.htm)), and adjust it based on whether or not your goal is to gain muscle or lose fat. If you wish to gain muscle, eat over your TDEE. If you want to lose fat, eat under your TDEE. The more you go over or under (within reason), the faster you will see results. It is, however, a better idea to remain conservative and stay within 500 calories above or below.

&gt;Remember: it took you a long time to get in the state you're in; it will take a long time to get out of it. Don't rush it.

&gt;In terms of what foods you should and should not eat, calories matter more than specific foods.

Understanding how important fixing your diet is was **monumental** in helping me lose the weight. I immediately began by cutting out all drinks (mainly sodas) except water, milk, and juice I juiced in my juicer. I cooked all of my meals myself and never ate out. Ever. (So much money saved!) For 3 months I ate primarily meats, veggies, fruits, and nuts. I also supplemented with fish oil, flaxseed oil, multivitamins, and whey protein.

* 3. Do You Even Lift?

Now that my diet was solid, I got serious about going to the gym. I wanted to build muscle so I started watching [TwinMuscleWorkout](http://www.youtube.com/user/twinmuscleworkout) on youtube so I could, ""make alllllllll kinds of gains!"" I lifted weights every other day and downloaded the /r/C25K  app to my iphone. When I first began I could only run continuously for about 5 mins tops. I finished my first ever 5k on [November 11, 2012](http://i.imgur.com/VktHH0N.jpg?1).

* 4. ???
* 5. PROFIT!!!

I'm continuing on my journey and hope to lose another 30 - 40 pounds to get under 200. Just remember to stay positive and keep on going!

I posted a few months ago, but I wanted to post again because I know that searching through loseit and finding other women with my weight and height really inspired me to keep going on. This reddit is an amazing resource, and I have gained a lot of insight from reading everyone's posts. I intend on continuing to use it as I have to maintain this weight for...you know, the rest of my life.

I started by counting calories (Which I still do to maintain) and have recently starting running and lifting weights. I think the greatest part about losing 65 lbs is how I'm learning my body is capable of so much more. I never really felt overweight when I was heavier...but now that I weigh less I can really notice a difference. It's incredible!

I've done most of this with a ketogenic diet but recently, my diet has kind of evolved its self into a paleo-ish ketogenic diet on a leangains style intermittent fasting feeding schedule of 16/8. I lift weights 4 times a week using Jim Wendler's 5/3/1. My ultimate goal is to be swole. Not butter troll swole but rather fitness-freak swole.

Here are some other stats:

 I also Walk at least 1 hour everyday, better if more. 

BackStory: the First 5 years of my life were great, just your average happy canadian family. until my father got a job flying to different countries where he would find an addiction to alcohol and cheating on my mother, which in turn destroyed her. when my father left, my mother had to take care of me and work multiple jobs for stability ,also being depressed she didn't think much about our health. we ended up eating extremely unhealthy I started gaining lots of weight past kindergarten and it never stopped.  every day at school was a nightmare because i would get beat up or harassed for being Overweight, which just drove me to eat more and more.

 over the years it got worst and worst including my new found anxiety towards people. i hated people, they drove me mad and no matter how hard i tried to reason it always felt like they were always against me because of my weight (it truly is hard being the only fat kid in your district.), so i took to gaming for my complete get away. i would skip school almost everyday. I sat at home most of the time just playing Xbox or WoW to get through the day. at one point i completely dropped out of School, so the pounds just started to rack up even faster.

The journey started around June 2011. i was around 500+ pounds, I literally sat in my basement everyday waiting to die, i knew i was going to a die sad and lonely and it really didn't bother me. I knew i was destined to get diabetes or something worse, it was a miracle i didn't.  around this time i started to take WoW seriously for a 16 year old at least so i would watch pvp videos and stuff alike until one day i found Swifty and his IRL channel. i would watch every day them talking about going to the gym and exercising and how much fun they had. for once in my life i was excited to change.
 first i tried just walking and small exercises in my basement. then i noticed it felt good. so i walked more. i even tried running a little bit. then i decided to put my attention on playing Dance Central for Kinect just walking and playing this was enough exercise for me to lose like CRAZY! i dropped all sugar from my diet and started eating healthy, i couldn't believe what was going on. it was like magic. my whole life media taught me that weight loss was extremely difficult and soul draining but i found it the opposite. I was happy. 

eventually i would start going to a gym where i met one of the biggest helps in my life, my personal trainer Tim. i would go atleast 3 day a week and walk for 30-60 minutes a day. i went from 380-280 training with him. then I eventually took a break. but eventually came back ronin style to lose the rest. I now spend most of my time learning all about fitness. I try to go every day or every other day and i also make sure to walk for a minimum of an hour a day sometimes 2-3. I cant Stress enough how important walking is for losing weight, if you want to lose weight, just Walk!


 i still have more to go  and even if i was a perfect weight i would never stop, but i feel like now is the perfect time to share. just two years ago i never thought I would be here today like this.  hell, i never thought i would ever have a girlfriend. and i just got over a relationship. kinda the motivating push to post this. i believed i would either still be huge or dead, pick one. not a Highly motivated 220 pound 19 year old kid. i want to so badly write more, but this page is just gonna turn into a huge Wall of Text. so i'll leave it at this.


TL;DR: I was an Extremely overweight Fat kid growing up then decided to change my life around at 17.

At 5'6 I have never weighed more than 140, when I weighed myself that year I was tipping the scales at around [163lbs] (http://i.imgur.com/7FEtoQ7.jpg). 

[My weight] (http://i.imgur.com/kvUytC4.jpg) seemed to creep up on me slowly, so I never realised that I was buying clothes 1 size then 2 sizes larger. I was at university so walking everywhere, and leading what I believed to be a healthy lifestyle. It was only after I saw that photo that I began to not recognise myself anymore.

After university I decided things had to change. I made small changes to my diet. I cut out sugar that I added to tea, packed in as many fruit and veg as I could, and what I think has made the biggest difference was cutting alcohol, almost completely. 

I started running just 1 mile a day [and I slowly saw my body begin to change] (http://i.imgur.com/6X0Cb.jpg?1). I didn't enjoy it though, it isn't the sport for me.

I decided to try a few different workout DVDs, I found the 30 Day Shred the most enjoyable, but eventually became bored with the same routine everyday. That was when I found my Zumba class, I love it to pieces, it's the high speed cardio I was looking for, and no one takes it too seriously (even our instructor forgets the moves!)

This past week I decided to give 30DS another go, and I was stunned at how easy I found it; I thought back to the first time I tried it, having to stop to catch my breath, and really forcing myself to continue, and here I was barely breaking a sweat! 

Having hit a plateau I decided to step things up a notch; this week I have completed Week1 of the Insanity workout. I have never sweat or ached so much in my life (I had to barrel roll out of bed because my abs were too sore to sit up)! but I am feeling better than ever.

I came across an old picture and realized how far I've come in the past few years. I'm 23 years old, 5'6"" and at my heaviest I weighed 210 lbs (left).  I weighed 150 in the picture on the right.  I lost the weight over the course of a few years, starting out by riding my bike to work and drinking more water.  I eventually began to eat healthier, opting for a high-fiber low-fat diet lots of fruit, veggies, yogurt, whole grains, lean meat, etc.  
 
I've gained weight recently (it tends to fluctuate, I gain some then lose it then gain it again :/ ) but I'm determined to reach my goal of 135.  I jog for 30 minutes 5x a week and do pilates.  Maybe once I get rid of my stomach fat I'll post a body pic but I'm too self-conscious to right now.  Until then hopefully this inspires someone, seeing that old picture definitely inspired me to go even further :)

1. Soda. Don't drink it. Just don't. Don't drink your calories. Soda has so many carbs to it's crazy.  I drank 3 sodas a day and now I'm drinking zero. I cut out 450 calories just like that!

2. Eat clean. That means no mcdonalds, no burgerking. None of that. What I did, because I am 15, was have my dad buy bulk meat when they went on sale. Mostly chicken really. I just ate lean meats and fresh or frozen veggies.

3. Exercise. Yea yea yea, I know. Everyone says this. But it's true.  I don't care if all you can do is jog for 10 minutes. Do it. It's so much more beneficial then sitting there watching t.v.

At 46 I had wasted way to much of my life being overweight. I had children I needed to set an example for. I haven't looked back...with the exception of choosing some pictures to show you of the before me.
I have lost this weight by way of calorie counting and exercise. I substituted a lot to keep the meals from becoming boring. I have come to love spaghetti squash and mock mashed potatoes. I have my last bite of the day at least 4 hours before bed. Between the diet and exercise I probably average a net deficit of 750 to 1000 calories a day.  
I am at the gym at least 4 times a week. About 45 minutes of cardio then 45 minutes of weights and finishing with 15 more minutes of cardio. I am also doing a little extra running on the street a couple times a week....trading for a 5K in May. 
My goal weight is 199lbs. Would like to be there by June 13th of this year. (My 47th birthday).

(NSFW),1243,237,138,http://www.reddit.com/r/loseit/comments/1hqiqv/i_never_thought_the_number_on_the_scale_wouldnt/,"For years, I've been obsessed with the idea of losing weight. I never wanted to put the work in to it, but I wanted it pretty badly. I posted once before about a large amount of weight that I had lost when my ex cheated on me. That started a huge change for me. I did lose a lot of weight in a very unhealthy way, and I kept it off for a long time. It started coming back on, very slowly. I weighed myself every day and saw the number starting to creep back up. I had originally lost about 80 pounds, and gained about 30 back. Two months ago, I decided that I wasn't letting that happen. A very close friend of mine is a fitness instructor and goes to the gym regularly. I told him that I needed him to give me the push and make me stick with it. I started eating VERY clean, nothing processed, mostly produce and chicken. I went to the gym and lifted weights with him about every other day for two weeks, and then got a gym membership of my own. I decided I wanted to do cardio because why build muscle if there is so much fat over it? I made it a personal goal to 'run' two miles every day in the beginning. That proved to be quite the challenge, as I don't run. So, I ran a tiny bit, walked until I didn't feel like I was dying, ran a bit, and so on. First day it took me 32 minutes to go my two miles. Over time, I was improving and then finally I told my friend I wanted him to run with me. I didn't want to run in front of him at first because I was so terrible and couldn't even run a mile without having to walk. We now run together and though he always says to not compare myself to him, as he's an in shape boy that is used to physical activity and I'm just starting out, he gives me the encouragement to push myself to my limits. I ran my fastest mile with him on Tuesday at 9 minutes. We still lift a few times a week and I attend the classes he teaches. Our first leg day, I squatted the bar-45lbs. I was so bad at it, my form was awful, and I was so sore after I couldn't walk comfortably for four days. Tonight, I squatted 100 pounds. I'm seeing muscles in my arms I've never seen. Same with my legs. I still have some chub on my belly, but I'm even starting to feel muscles there too. Though my scale is at the lowest number it's ever been at, just under 120 pounds, I find myself constantly looking at my triceps and shoulders to see the transformation that is happening there and it's the coolest thing. It's more than just seeing the scale change. It's seeing veins in my hands I've never seen, and seeing collarbones I've never seen. Being able to squat more than twice what I could just two months ago is mind blowing.

1327781284.0,987,self.loseit,p0t27,I've lost 360+lbs on my own and I would love to answer any questions people have.,1318,331,270,http://www.reddit.com/r/loseit/comments/p0t27/ive_lost_360lbs_on_my_own_and_i_would_love_to/,"My friend Hailz who frequents this page told me about it and told me that people have many questions about how I lost so much weight. I told her would be more than happy to share the knowledge I gained through my experience. So, let the sharing begin.

Background:
I grew up morbidly obese from about age 5. I was always tall and heavy for my age which meant in preschool I was the size of my teacher--granted she was quite a small lady. I grew up and out fast, horrible eating habits and very little physical activity. 
People often ask ""how could you let yourself get so big?!"" but that kind of question is only a luxury of hindsight. While in the present, in life, everything was normal to me. It was normal to ALWAYS be the biggest person in the room. It was normal for people to make comments about me being a ""big guy"". 
I was into my late teens when my thoughts about who I am and my future changed. My friend asked me one day ""What age do you see yourself dying?"" He meant it as a joke and for some reason, completely unwillingly I blurted out ""33"". The small chuckles faded as we both looked at each other and realized that at my current state dying at that age is a real possibility.

At age 20 is when I peaked in weight at about 600lbs. After avoiding cameras, mirrors, scales, or anything that would somehow force me to face what I had done to myself I did it to myself. I broke down one night, looked deep into a reflection of myself and made a promise with myself to change.

How I did it:
1. Get rid of eating just to eat. For me this meant getting out and away from the house.
-Walking everyday. Of course at 600 pounds I wasn't going very far at first. I started off walking to a local park and sitting on the swings for 15 minutes to catch my breath then walk home--yes, the industrial swing set bent noticeably when I sat on it. This 1.2 mile round trip took me over an hour to do at first. I made that same walk for about a month until I changed the distance. I walked everyday of the summer of 2008 for at least 2 hours, towards the end I was up to 6+ miles of just walking. I never missed a single day, rain or shine. I counted up to 155 days then lost track. 

-Take up a hobby/interest that requires being active even if it's just a little. For me, it was drumming (spawned from a little video game called rock band). If you do something you truly enjoy then time goes by faster and you don't have time to be bored and eat out of boredom. If you can achieve this while doing something active you're all the better for it.
-Every time I would look in the cupboard or fridge out of boredom I would tell myself that if I have enough free time on my hands to just leisurely look for food out of boredom then I have enough free time to walk around the neighborhood or the block. This kind of training kept me from going to the fridge and looking for no reason pretty well.

How I changed my eating:
I can tell you what I did and my thoughts on it. I had a VERY distorted view on what a normal serving size was and what a normal meal was so in order to combat that I essentially tried to reboot my brain. For the first 2 weeks I ate very little; apple, mustard on one slice of turkey with one slice of bread, pickle, multivitamin and little more. I was keeping myself so busy that this little bit of food was enough to keep me satisfied throughout the day. What this did was bring me back to normality. After eating such small amounts of food normal serving sizes, normal meals, were now satisfying and plentiful. My mom use to joke that I went from meals of 5+ packages of top ramen to eating like a humming bird, coming in to grab a small bite then right back out again.
Naturally I dropped soda and all sugary foods. I dropped fast food and often my daily walks would take place while my friends were out eating which helped deter social eating, another very hard hurdle to overcome.

When I started my goal was to be under 440lbs--the weight my scale at the time went up to. The days I hit 399, 350, 299 and 250 were some of the most energizing of my life. 
I tired to better my knowledge on nutrition every step of the way and continued pushing my body and setting new goals. I'm 210 pounds now at 6'3"", down from 600. There is no voodoo or magic and I didn't reinvent the wheel. Looking back at everything I would say the single most important factor is determination and drive. Cutting junk food out and going for walks is all easy in the grand picture of things, it just takes determination.

If you have questions, please ask.

Edit: 
I started out just by counting calories and just gradually got a little stricter on what I ate. I was way too lazy for a gym so I bought wii fit instead. Once I realized that sweating wouldn't kill me I got a membership and it was crazy how much I liked it. I was too intimidated by the machines so I did all the classes like zumba and such and eventually worked my way up to the elliptical machine and only for the last few months or so I started running. It look about two years to get to 150 and another 9 months or so to get down to this.

Basically I just stuck to fruits and veggies and a lot of soy products for protein and learned that exercise was not Satan.  
I am actually training for my first ever little triathlon thing, I would have never in my wildest dreams thought I could ever finish one.

Still, something happened to me yesterday that I could not help but share..(For backround, I am 5'5"" and have lost 130 lbs. I am now 145.)

So yesterday the BF and I were at Walmart doing our grocery shopping. We had spoken several times in the past about my issue with still feeling really big even though I wasn't actually big anymore. Anyway, the store was PACKED. We were both getting irritated at the large number of people who would just park their cart in the middle of the isle, with no regard for the flow of traffic. 

There was one woman in particular that we kept getting stuck behind. She looked to be about mid 40's, very big, and she had three boys with her, looking to be about the ages of 6, 8 and 10.  Her kids were running around like lunatics and knocking things around, and generally being annoying. 

Finally, towards the end of our shopping, we found ourselves stuck behind this woman again, parked in the middle of the isle, looking at the beans, and taking forever. I could not pass her because there was a steady stream of traffic coming the opposite way I was going. If she would just put her cart against the isle wall I would have been able to pass. I coughed a few times, hoping she would notice me, before saying ""Excuse me"" several times. She kept ignoring me. Finally, there was a gap in the oncoming traffic, so i pulled out to pass her and one of her kids darted right in front of my cart. I had to yank it back very hard to stop it from hitting him. The kid yelled ""You almost hit me!"" 

To this, the mom's hearing miraculously comes back and she turns around and sneers at me ""Watch where you are going you skinny bitch!"" I stood there, blinked for a second, and then started laughing my ass off, much to the confused look on the mom's face. I turned to my boyfriend behind me and said ""Did you hear that? She called me a skinny bitch! She says I'm a skinny bitch!""I walked on with my boyfriend, grinning from ear to ear, and the mom just looked bewildered and confused as we walked out of the isle.

After that post, things got worse before they got better.  I gained weight over the fall and winter and got up to 190 pounds by the start of the year.

A couple things happened at that point.  First, I started freaking out about nearing 200 lbs on the scale again.  My clothes were starting to not fit again, I went up from a size 10 to a size 14.  I started thinking, am I really going to do this to myself again?  Around the same time, I got engaged, and decided that I REFUSED to be a fat bride.  I didn't want to have any reason to be disappointed looking back at my wedding pictures and didn't want to spend my wedding day worrying about whether people were commenting on my weight gain.

Also around the same time (sort of a perfect storm happened really), Weight Watchers put in a store right across from my work.  I had tried their online subscription a few years back but never attended meetings.  I felt like I had been dieting so long on my own and it was obviously no longer working, that I needed help.  I needed some support and definitely some accountability.

I joined at the end of January, my first weigh in being 192 lbs.  I just reached lifetime last week and am currently 142 lbs, down from an all time high of 295.  While WW might not work for everyone, if you are having problems with keeping yourself accountable I highly recommend it.  I even feel like the actual food plan could be something completely different and I'd still lose weight just because weighing in every week puts what I'm eating in the forefront of my mind.

Now that I'm lifetime and don't have to pay anymore, there's no reason for me not to keep going to meetings and weighing in weekly.  Because I still have problems with self control and likely always will, I plan on keeping up with it.  If there's one thing I've learned over the past few years it's to embrace and plan for my weaknesses.

Now to preface this, I'm a 6'3"", 197lb (down from 360) guy, never once felt uncomfortable walking home this late due to my size and the fact that it's a generally nice area.  Well I had my headphones in and was happily strolling home to the thought of my fiance and warm bed.

I was walking down a street of closed shops with glass fronts and then I saw it.  Caught a reflection of a guy walking immediately behind me, way too close to have any other reason than to steal or harm.  I immediately spun ready to absolutely tear into my would be assailant but I'm greeted by a completely empty street.

I was then stuck with a sense of stupidity, I saw my own reflection walking and freaked out because my mind no longer recognizes what I truly look like out of the corner of my eye due to the amount of weight I lost. 

I chuckled to myself and thought at least my would be mugger is dead sexy and headed on home.

Sooo, how'd I lose? Easy, eat fewer calories than I burn! Okay, more specifically I eat at or under 1200 Cals a day and run occasionally.

I'm a lazy dieter. I just  eyeball measurements for myfitnesspal and try to stop eating when the number hits zero. Having busy schedule helps a lot as I get in trouble home alone with the fridge (that cookie dough is still in the drawer...).

 The BIGGEST step for me in losing it was realizing how calorically dense some foods are.  Thinking of how much I used to eat just makes me want to vomit. Potato+egg for breakfast, two potatoes+cheese for lunch, three cups buttered noodles smothered in parmesan for dinner. Disgusting. 

Now a typical day is greek yogurt+small amount of fruit for breakfast, homemade chili or soup+lotsa broccoli for lunch, whatever my boyfriend made for dinner, and a drink or some kind of small sweet for dessert (though I've sucked at the ""just one"" thing lately).

[http://imgur.com/a/X4azB#0!](http://imgur.com/a/X4azB#0)

I woke up two days before from a super nasty little apnea and my heart wouldn't stop freaking out.  Blood pressure was super high (190/120), I couldn't breathe, and I was making deals with any deity that would hear my case.  Once I could breathe again and had my blood pressure not in a scary spot they released me.  Two days later, I had what they later thought could have been a mini stroke.  Left side of my body went totally numb and I couldn't squeeze as hard with both hands. That's when I demanded the picture be taken of me.  This was my come-to-Jesus moment. Being 28 years old and sharing a hotel room with a guy about to have a triple bypass woke me up right away.  

I had been eating drive-thru, fast food, or pizza 2-4 times a day. I did the thing where I'd get a few things at Taco Bell, then drive down the block to get the burger I wanted, but the drink giant drink I needed was a little further down the way.  So I'd get all three.  Or I'd pick up Taco Bell before the bar, and then hit it up again afterwards and get more.  Or lie in line and, when ordering a lot of stuff, say '...and she'll have' or 'and he wants'. Or when I'd budget over 400 dollars from a check to food 'for work' like ordering pizza to my desk (sidenote: over 150 Papas Points in less than 2 years). 

I took action.  For the first 3 months, I refused nearly anything that involved me going through a drive thru (with the exception of Pita Pit since I could almost justify it due to the sheer amount of vegetables I'd put on it).  I thought I was getting the DTs from a rehab at that point since I had the absolute worst heartburn and burps during that time.  I was also put on a beta-blocker for my anxiety and blood pressure. I ate healthy choice soups and bread as my meals for a few months.  Instead of having to eat every 3-5 hours, I was now doing once every 6-8 (and much smaller meals too!).  Plan: no big sugary drinks or snacks and if I was going to have pizza I was going to make it myself (no pepperoni, since that gives me terrible heartburn now for some reason). 

I lost over 50 pounds those first few months without exercising, which I learned was the dumbest thing I could have done (other than going back to all drive-thru all the time).  I lost a bunch of muscle-mass in my back and, in February, the muscles in my back couldn't stay put and collapsed.  I spent the next 6 months lying down at work or in bed at home.  Unable to sit in a chair for any real length of time or drive my car.  It did help with the keeping me away from drive-through foods, but it also limited me far more than I would have ever imagined.  

Physical therapy and lifting weights have brought me mostly back to normal.  I can't explain just how happy I was to see 299.8 on my scale.  A hundred and ten pounds.  My fiance', friends, and family have been super supportive and my confidence has never been higher.  

Favorite moments:

-When my fiance' could hug me and touch her fingers (and now completely clasp them)

-When the delivery driver for Papa Johns came by my office and said 'jesus, you've lost weight! (ordered pizza for my assistants at work)'

-The psoriasis on my face has cleared up drastically

-It's harder to carry things under my arm since there's less man-titty for it to press up against

-Seeing my primary doctor at the same gym I go to and seeing him nod and smile when I'm working out.  

-Sleep apnea is no longer an issue at all. I can sleep through the night without a single issue every night

-Went to Taco Bell a few months back out of absolute necessity (needed to eat SOMETHING with my pill) and had a few tacos.  All I tasted was salt.  Nothing but salt.  Like Fry when he eats the saltiest thing he's ever had (and he once ate a heaping pile of salt).  Totally disgusting.  

-2x shirts!  Shopping like a normal human being!  Oh my god the joy of not being upset when you're shopping because 'they don't make it in my size!' 

-I look dead sexy in a sports coat now :-)

-I've got a baby on the way in January.  My numbers were absolutely abysmal before losing weight and, a few months after I lost weight, we were able to get a tadpole cooking and he should be keeping us up in a few months!

Sorry.  Really wanted to share with the community that has given me so much inspiration and strength during nights that were very long and the neon sign from McDonalds was so bright.  Here's the more clothed version of my journey:

Just putting this out there because the scale is BS.  Act healthy, eat healthy, and be healthy!

edit because the MAN got all up in my GRILL about posting progress pics.

So here's my story:  I'm currently 27 years old, 5'8"" tall.  Last july i became interested in getting serious about working out.  I had suffered from back problems probably not totally unrelated to the beer gut you see in the before picture.  I was freshly out of a long term relationship and, for the first time in my adult life, free to do as I pleased.  I decided to learn about strength training and I reasoned that given my naturally stocky build I probably would not ever look like Usain Bolt, but I could probably gain a good bit of muscle and power.  I read Starting Strength and Stronglifts, Madcow, smolov, and similar programs and developed a consistent weightlifting routine 3x a week, steadily increasing weight as I went on.  I have experimented with a number of supplements and currently do a 3x daily ECA stack, mainly for appetite control and energy.  I also take creatine, fish oil, D-3 and multivitamin daily.  I've also been experimenting with beta alanine, L-Tyrosine, Taurine, and 1,3DMAA and I have noticed positive effects from them.  I have also played with L-carnitine, L-arginine, and a number of other amino acids but I've dismissed most of them as broscience for now.  Currently my workout routine is MWF or MWS of the following lifts:

*  5x5 upright row or pendlay row
*  5x5 overhead press
*  5x5 heavy low-bar back squat
*  5x5 lat pulldowns
*  5x6 weighted dips
*  5x7 barbell curls
*  5x10 pushups

naturally this will vary from time to time, I may do bench press, deadlifts, farmers walk, or axe chops depending on how I'm feeling but it's basically the above sequence, just with a little more weight each week.

For most of my progress I ate around 1800-2000 calories a day in a cyclic ketogenic diet with carb-up weekends.  I probably drink too much for optimum health but lately I've cut that out of the week and isolated it to weekends only.  My waist has gone from 42 inches to 36 inches, my biceps from 13.5 to 15.5, my 3-lift powerlifting total is around 850lb, inching toward that magical 1000lb barrier.  I no longer get headaches or back pain and my perception among my peers has gone from being the fat guy to being the fitness guy.  I still have a long way to go, my goal is to eventually be around 170lb with roughly the same lean body mass I have now and I figure that I should be there around next august.  Thanks for all your support!

Final edit:  During keto my weight got as low as 185lb but mostly hovered around 188-190.  I am currently off-keto and on a moderate-carbohydrate whole-foods diet at around 2500-3000 calories a day.  I'm going to try to gain as much muscle mass as I can until the end of august then just maintain as I go back into keto.",,False,,t5_2rz8w,1345733539.0,,50lbs,True,t3_ynplf,http://www.reddit.com/r/loseit/comments/ynplf/200lb200lb_what_0_pounds_lost_looks_like/,

**When?**
Since mid June of 2011, I started at around 440 and am now into my 230s. My target is about 210, but who knows, if that's easy to maintain, as low as 190 or so. 


**Why?**
**I was absolutely miserable.** This post summarizes my fat(ter) state: 


&gt;I had a shit load of medical issues, all of which were complications of my diet and undiagnosed. I would get winded after going up stairs and it took no less than ten minutes to recover. I got shin splints after walking for more than a half mile. My vision was often blurry in the morning after I eat my bagel, cereal and margarine (a sign of diabetes and abnormal blood sugar). I was constantly tired and experienced daily crashes after meals which left me irritable and unable to focus. My skin was dry and flakey. I often developed heat rash in the lower extremities during the summer. Speaking of summer, I could not operate in temperatures over 80 F for very long before become miserable or fatigued. I avoided going to some places because I couldn’t fit physically. My painful activities with the opposite sex were often restricted to the dreaded friendzone. I had tooth decay. My heart would often chug violently and one time I even called an ambulance because I thought I was having a heart attack. Constant heartburn and indigestion. Stomach ulcers. Headaches and withdrawal symptoms whenever I went extended periods without certain foods. My flexibility was horrible – I could not raise my legs very far without experiencing horrible pain and stiffness. I actually could not sleep on my back at one point, as the weight put a lot of pressure on my lower back and made me toss and turn all night. The list goes on and on.

&gt;It was for these symptoms, not for my size (which I had trouble perceiving) that I first tried to lose weight.

So I told myself that I wasn't going to post any progress pics until I lost 100 lbs but last night after I got back from the gym I walked by my new full length mirror (never wanted one before!) and realized that I'm not the same person anymore! I still have a long way to go but it is amazing to finally see the difference. Two people close to me have been moved to tears after seeing me this week which is ah-mazing (but also slightly embarrassing). I have been morbidly obese since I was six years old and I am proportionately smaller now than I have ever been and people just aren't use to seeing me as they have NEVER seen me before. The entire experience has been amplified by the ability to share in the excitement with those closest to me which is why I am here today, /r/loseit. None of this would have ever been possible without you. Your support and inspiration has kept me going and made the most difficult task in my life to finally become manageable. I can only hope to inspire others who are contemplating the same life choices.

Oh yeah, how am I doing you ask? Classic diet change and exercise. I started on 1/14/13 and consume about 1200-1400 calories a day, being sure to log everything in MFP. I have been working out at the gym three times a week and yes bro, I lift now. By the way, if you live in the east US, check to see if there is a [Workout Anytime](http://workoutanytime.com/) near you. It's $15/month for a solo membership or for $25/mo you can bring a buddy with you as well as unlimited tanning and hydromassage visits (neither of which I really use but you might).  

Good luck, losers... much love for you all!

[/r/pics](/r/pics) is getting out of hand with what they consider to be acceptable, [/r/funny](/r/funny) is even worse, what should be a place for funny things now has something like 20 related subreddits and all of them are complaining that nobody knows where to post. OF COURSE NOBODY KNOWS WERE TO POST, every single subreddit is saying ""you can't post that here anymore"". 

I was really proud of my progress. I wanted to post a before/after comparison. I came here to do so and found out that it's no longer acceptable to do so, so the entire point of this part of the website has been banned for me. I posted to [/r/progresspics](/r/progresspics) because for now anyways, they still allow people to post progress pics. Pretty soon it's probably going to fracture into [/r/beforepics](/r/beforepics) and [/r/afterpics](/r/afterpics) anyways. 

Oh yeah, and to meet the new ""posting guidelines"": [Here's my picture.](http://i.imgur.com/kETeW.jpg) I did it by eating less and exercising more. My future goals are to lose more weight and read about other people doing so. Hopefully I'll find the appropriate subreddit for that soon enough.

This is my fiancé Ashley who has struggled with weight loss her entire life. We have known each other since middle school, and we were both considered ""fat kids"". Almost a year ago, she was hired by the USPS as a city carrier. When she got the job, her mom bought her a fitbit, which tracks her walking distance. At her job she's walking around 12-14 miles everyday, and soon after this started the weight began falling off of her. Still, though, she has the self-image of being ""fat"". I couldn't be more proud of her and her massive achievement, and try to tell her that everyday that I can. However, sometimes it's the opinions of strangers that mean the most, and that's why I wanted to post her awesome weight loss on here. She has lost over 90 lbs since starting her job, and she earned every bit of it.

Again, I apologize if this goes against any rules of this subreddit. I just wanted someone to see how amazing her progress has been, and hopefully get some feedback that will make her day. :)

UPDATE: Wow, thank you so much for your support! Just wanted to let everyone know that she has read every comment and will be keeping up with the post. I tried to convince her to post on here but she's a little shy. Her and I are eternally grateful for all of your kind words, and you all definitely made her day/week/year. Thank you! :)

UPDATE 2: Well, I think it's safe to say that this was successful in helping her self-image. Not only was she refreshing this page constantly last night, but the first thing she did this morning (even before coffee!) was check this page. She's been smiling ear to ear since and loving your comments. Honestly I haven't seen her smile like this in a long while, especially first thing in the morning, so thank you again.

I know I have a very long road ahead of me but losing all the weight has reaffirmed that I am capable of anything. I have been wanting to post in this subreddit for so long, I have just been scared. I posted my progress pics on facebook the other day and I got a lot more positive feedback than I expected, so it gave me the courage to share my progress with the reddit community. I can go into much more detail about anything that anyone is interested in. My wife also got into great shape with me, losing ~60lbs. We are both working hard to keep improving and we are setting our sights on doing something in the fitness industry. The ""after"" picture is still a little chunky in my opinion but I have turned my attention to bulking now because I feel it would be a waste of my time to try to cut further knowing that I will have to cut again after I bulk up some. Last week was my first week on a calorie surplus and let me tell you, it was amazing. I have never been so strong in the gym, I can't wait till a few months into the bulk. Also, keep in mind, my bulk is completely clean, and it is actually becoming more strict than my diet when I was losing weight. If anyone has any questions, ask away. I'm headed to the gym now, but I will be around tonight.

I wasn't going to post pictures until I had a year under my belt, but I got a haircut today and figured what better time?? I moved to Chicago with my boyfriend last year where it seemed that everyone was more active and attractive so I decided to conform. By selling our cars, becoming commuters, and shopping at farmers markets our lifestyle started to shift but it wasn't the drastic change I wanted so I went on a hunt for a gym. That is when my entire life changed; I found Downsize Fitness which is a gym that caters strictly to overweight clients and the amazing people that I owe everything too, my new family! I started working out 5-6 days a week for 60-90mins, focusing on strength training/Crossfit with the bulk of my cardio coming from boxing, zumba, and interval classes. I began calorie counting with MFP with 1800-2000cals, I make a huge effort to eat as least processed foods as possible, not focusing too harshly on macros, but I still enjoy my hot cheetos, pb cookies, and crap in my goals, just less frequently. I see so many people with extremely rigid rules and that is NOT for me, I enjoy challenging myself at times but I am a firm believer in moderation.


My main reasoning for wanting to write this is to reach out to people who are struggling! I have had so many slip ups and binge episodes in the last 9 months but I have still managed to lose 108lbs, PLEASE do not let a bad day or weekend stop you!!! I have had multiple days in a row with zero regard to my diet and come home 12lbs up but you accept it and trudge along! I had a massive (not exaggerating) binge less than a month ago, they are getting better and less frequent but it’s SO much more important to get over it and start where you left off. I used to panic before holidays and parties but you will learn what really matters and how to navigate them better.  I want to help people through this and have become so passionate about fun healthy cooking and exercise that I am studying to become a certified PT and am leading my first (supervised) group boot camp tomorrow! My wonderful redditor boyfriend has been extremely supportive (with some exceptions haha) and lost 50lbs himself and I am lucky enough to have some of my beautiful best friends in this struggle with me and constantly inspiring me. I cannot wait to help people experience their weight loss journey; being able to have pride in your food choices, push yourself physically in ways you never thought possible, annnnnnd of course where cute clothes :) I'm always open for questions or to lend an ear!

Edit- **THANK YOU ALL SO MUCH FOR THE COMMENTS!!** I should've mentioned this in the original post, but here's what we did to get healthy!

We stopped eating fast food. COMPLETELY. 
We started eating WAY better foods (cut down on greasy, fatty, salty foods). 
We try to eat at least 4-5 times a day, smaller portions. 
She stopped drinking soda, I have not. 
I just quit smoking cigarettes, she quit months ago. 
We don't put sugar in our coffee. 
We both joined a gym together, and we workout as often as we possibly can. 
We motivate each other by any means possible.

Like anybody I had times where I fell off the the exercise/diet wagon, even for a few months XD at one point(thank you, depression...), but somehow got my ass back into gear.

However, I always came here looking for the inspiration I needed to shed the pounds. Over the course of the past eleven months, this subreddit has gotten me past every challenge. All I want to say is this: THANK YOU!!!!! 

Here's the story: 

I was always on the thick side. I was still considered a healthy weight though, except by my peers. Bullying led me to binge eat. Food was tasty. Food was kind. It would never betray you...until you were struggling to climb some stairs. [MFW](http://25.media.tumblr.com/41b34a74f90884907864f2acc507a10c/tumblr_mjihflIOS51rokolpo1_250.gif) I realized I needed to lose weight. I cut through my fatlogic and saw myself for the hammy I was. I had an appointment scheduled to visit a nutritionist. I was incredibly nervous and thought that I would be fatshamed for letting myself fall off the deep end. [MFW](http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_mdnl8eRfb91rrxhj7.gif) the scale said 244.8 lbs. It was [like being crushed by a giant boulder](http://25.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_m9cqegRdKD1qm6sfao1_500.gif). My epic nutritionist got me past the shock, and we went through my diet. I never grasped how much food I would gobble up each day. A box of wheat thins, a gallon of soda, four or five slices of pizza, etc. [I WAS ALWAYS EATING](http://24.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_lztvxud4eE1rn95k2o1_500.gif). Together, we cut out the constant snacks, the giant portions, and all the junk. My diet would mainly consist of tofu, greek yogurt, vegetables, fruits, beans, lentils, etc. I didn't actually count calories  much. I was just conscientious of what I put in my mouth. If the calories were not worth the protein and nutrition, I wouldn't eat it. Also, no desserts. After dinner I would have some fruit. 
I did this for the next month until I met my nutritionist again. [HFW](http://25.media.tumblr.com/9939d80aafd7f1217af815bd1f7ab42b/tumblr_mjw1xxXQ6T1s14h9co1_500.gif) she saw I had lost 16 pounds. We talked about what I had done (I literally followed the diet plan and went for half hour walks or bike rides), and the future. She gave me some new recipes and wished me luck. I cheated a couple times (Christmas, Easter, birthday, some other times), but stuck with the plan. I was only able to do this by sitting at the computer to scroll through r/progresspics+loseit+fatpeoplestories. I did meet up with my nutritionist when I had lost 70 pounds, basically got more recipes like before. Now, less than a year later, I stood on the scale. [MRW](http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_lysmpzvwuB1r2t5bk.gif) it said 142 lbs. I feel like an entirely new person. I can go up four flights of stairs without gasping for air! I can sleep on my back without drowning in my own fat rolls! I can do anything! And so can you! 

For the future:
Next week, I go to see my nutritionist. How do you think she'll react? My goal for the summer is to tone my muscles and learn to maintain a healthy weight. 

With any luck, this post will help some of you complete your journey. Best of wishes to you all! 

EDIT: Thanks for all the incredible support. [I'm getting the feels, guys.](http://i33.photobucket.com/albums/d74/QueenAquaBubbles/Vincentcrys.gif) Since it's been requested, I shall be posting a more thorough explanation of my diet in the next few days. Towards the end of summer, I shall post more pictures after I kick off the rest of the weight and build some muscle. 

I also added a No-Face gif. You guys like the lols, so I try to deliver.

I am the girl in the white shirt next to my sister in the navy and then me by myself that I took a week ago. I went from 277 to 187. I am now trying to lose 30 more pounds to reach my goal of 160. It was been rough dealing with being obese throughout my teenage years then I moved out when I turned 18 and I have been losing weight ever since. When I got started i was just eating a lot healthier and then my portion sizes were smaller and then I exercised around the neighborhood I was living in. I am sure that if i cut out junk food and exercised more i would be at 160 by now...but it is not very realistic to cut out everything that isn't healthy for you. 

My diet was high protein low cal and it's still high protein low calorie. The place I was renting from when I left and began my weight loss always had healthy snacks in the cabinets and provided healthy meals, I just ate what was provided in the beginning then I started to see the lbs melt off me and I got really motivated. Went from a 24 to an 18 and now I am in between a 12 and 16!   

I had a lot of ups and downs with this weight loss but I am definitely heading to my goal of 160!

The same thing happens in your pelvis.

My parents were both working full-time to make ends meet, and from the age of 10 on I went home to an empty house after school, filled with all sorts of delicious, unhealthy food. There were some other emotional issues going on like a bad, mentally abusive relationship with my dad, and all my teenage years had me at various stages of fat. Here's some examples: http://imgur.com/a/QSJXN

Redhead/blonde. I wasn't happy the way I was; I was mocked by family members and people at school alike. I remember one particularly embarrassing incident where my class was on a school trip in a mall. Boys and girls alike walked past an underwear store, and the boys started making fun of how I'd look in a thong. I had absolutely no confidence and was trying my best to be invisible.

When I was 19 or 20 (don't remember exact age), I was so, so tired of all the ridicule. I was completely done with it and wanted to regain some control over my life. Over the course of about a year or two, I changed. I exercised portion control, started walking a LOT (I later turned into a gymrat) and started learning about nutrition. This was the end result: http://imgur.com/a/AttMY

I am now 26 and have maintained the same weight for more than 5 years. I'm still a carbivore too. No keto for me. 

My environment at home never changed (though my dad and I get along a lot better since I moved out and got my life started), but I just went out and did it. If you have the determination and the toolset (ie internet for recipes and nutritional information), you can reinvent yourself. Once you get over the initial hump of ""I don't like these foods!"" ""I'm hungry!"" and ""I hate exercise!"", you'll actually start to like all of them. Exercise will become a way to challenge yourself over and over again, hunger will become a tool that makes you fill up on less food over time, and healthy foods will start tasting great. I actually cringe at most processed foods now.

There was no magic formula for me. I moved more and ate less. Regardless of all calorie science debates, it works. You're the master of your life, never let anything stand in your way. 

Oh, and don't go on a diet. Change your life. Keep the good habits forever.

In February of 2012 I moved into a new building that had its own gym. 

On March 1st 2012 I decided I would give it a try and went for the first time. I started off at 314lbs and went a few times a week doing easier things like the elliptical and exercise bikes and walking on the treadmills. 

A year has now passed and as of yesterday morning I was down to 174lbs. I go to the gym every night (with rare exceptions) and tend to focus mainly on running. I used to hate it, but now I'm happy to run for an hour straight as long as I've got good music. If I miss out on running one night, I feel off.

Other than the direct weight loss, my health and endurance another big change I've noticed. When I started on the treadmill I'd have to stop after 2 minutes or so and would be extremely out of breath. Tonight I ran 5km in 27 minutes, and have run 10km in around an hour in the past as well.

In addition to the exercise, I began watching what I ate using the LoseIt iPhone app. The two combined have worked well, and looking back at past pictures for this before and after I didn't even recognize myself.

",1168,282,154,http://www.reddit.com/r/loseit/comments/v0ymn/hey_reddit_its_cakeday_so_i_figured_id_share_my/,"Well, Reddit, I’ve lost 180 pounds now over the last 1.5 years. Basic stats: male, 23, about 6’1”.  Here’s my (unfinished) story, in the hopes that someone out there finds it useful or motivational and is able to make changes in their own life. If I can do it, I’m sure anyone can. **PICS ARE AT THE VERY END, IF YOU HATE READING.**

I’ve always been obese. I remember buying adult male XL size shirts going into 5th grade. By the time I was 13, I was up to 350ish. I don’t have a lot of pictures from then, but yeah I was pretty huge. I eventually started a super strict diet and exercise routine, and was down to ~225 about 2 years later, which was the lowest I had ever been at the time (other than as a super-obese young child). Unfortunately, that is exactly when I started high school, and I quickly gave up my diet/exercise routine for several reasons, mostly the fact that I was a typical stressed, hormonal teen who didn’t know what they wanted and just kind of did whatever. Food was always something that cheered me up, and being skinny in high school was kind of terrifying as a pretty antisocial person. It was a lot easier just to accept myself as the fat kid and not worry about attention from people. 

4 years later, I graduated high school somewhere between 290-300 pounds. I remember having my senior picture taken when I was 280-285, and I was totally disgusted. That didn’t motivate me to change my habits though.

It was about this time I started playing a lot of videogames (well, a lot MORE video games than I already was). Fast forward a few years, and I’m well over 300. I don’t know my exact weight at my heaviest, but it was in the 380-400 range. Looking back on what I would eat back then is pretty shocking. Example: one “medium size” meal: 6 hot dogs, each wrapped in a tortilla with tons of cheese in it, and then tons of sauce on the side. Easily 2500+ right there depending on the brand of sausages and the amount of cheese. I never used to care about portions, and just as made as much food as I thought I could eat. 

Around spring of 2010 I started “dieting” and doing very moderate exercise. I would make sure that I went on a walk around the area once per day, and started reducing my portions. This was a very weak attempt to lose weight though. I didn’t weigh myself ever, and I didn’t change my diet hardly at all. Example: Instead of walking 2 blocks to jack in the box and getting 4 hamburgers and a large curly fries, I would walk there and get 2 hamburgers and a chicken sandwich and a medium curly fries. *Great* dieting plan right there. 

I think I lost a little weight during 2010, but definitely not much. I was still pretty big at the end of that year. At the end of December 2010, my roommate convinced me to come to the gym with him. I went to the locker room, weighed myself, and saw 372. I consider this my starting weight. I was completely disgusted. I tried jogging and ended up bursting blood vessels in my left eye. This was a wake up call; I couldn’t even slowly run in circles on a track without hurting myself. I decided that this had gotten way out of control and I needed to fix it.


The first 3 months (January, February, March) I lost 22 pounds, going from 372 to 350. I didn't really do anything THAT drastic. I was going to the gym about once or twice per week and just doing 35 min of cardio and then leaving. I hated going to the gym at that weight because of how self conscious I was, but I forced myself to go SOMETIMES at the very least. I wasn't that careful about food at this point, but I started only eating at meals and cut out all snacks. I was eating 2 eggs, 2 pieces of bread, cheese, salsa, and coffee for breakfast, then a sandwich for lunch (2 pieces of bread, about 7 slices of turkey, some cheese, some horseradish/mustard, and lots of onion/pickles/lettuce), and then either another sandwich (exactly the same) or a tuna salad or a tuna sandwich for dinner (with more coffee!). One of the hardest things for me at this point was trying to cut out ""extra carbs."" I used to eat tons of bread/tortillas/rice, etc, and I tried to be careful about it and reduce it to as little carbs as I could. I was also completely broke at this point, so there definitely were a few weeks where my meals were eggs for breakfast, rice for lunch, and rice for dinner (not healthy, but like I said, I had no money at this point lol).

The next 3 months (April, May, June) I lost about 25 pounds. The 3 month increments are just because that is the length of the school quarter, and that is how I measured my progress. I had a similar routine as I had the first 3 months, but I started going to the gym 2-3 times per week instead of 1-2 and at this point I started doing very moderate weight lifting. After my 35 min of cardio, I would do 2 or 3 weight machines and then leave. Once again, I was really uncomfortable at the gym and didn't like feeling like a huge fatass in front of all the smaller people. I did not count calories, I just tried to eat ""healthier"" and less. It was a very vague diet plan, but in general I was just trying to reduce the amount I ate, and it was working, so I didn't think too much about it. I should mention I also ate a lot of chili/rice/beans because it is tasty and delicious. I would, though, only eat half the can of chili. Which was REALLY hard for my fat brain to handle, but I got used to it. Half a can of chili + a moderate amount of rice was another one of my go-to dinners. At this point I started actually feeling a little smaller. I had to switch to from 4XL/3XL shirts (depending on the brand) to 3XL/2XL shirts (depending on the brand).

Over the course of the summer (July, August, September) I went from about 325 to about 295. I decided to try and go to the gym at least 3 days per week, and I increased my weight lifting dramatically. Instead of spending 10 minutes lifting weights, I upped it to 30-35 minutes. I was feeling smaller and was less self-conscious about my size. At this point I discovered Reddit, and eventually found /r/loseit. At this point I started being a lot more careful about calories and actually trying to know the number of calories I had eaten so far that day. I am actually surprised I lost as much weight over the summer as I did, because I drank a LOT of beer. It was common for me to drink 8-12 beers multiple nights a week (4-6 nights per week lol...). I'm not an alcoholic, but it was summer and it was the last time I was living with my friends before they left for China for a few years. I was more active in general at this point. My roommates and I went on a lot of hikes and went swimming often.

When the fall started, I moved into a different apartment by myself. Being alone a lot more gave me a lot of free time. So at this point I went into sort of “beast mode”. I started keeping a food journal ( I still keep a food journal) where I write down everything I eat every day (and caloric estimates). It's a nice tool to help you get used to calorie counting. I still do it because it still helps me. For the next 3 months (October / November/December) I was going to the gym minimum 6 days a week, often every day. I was tired all the time, but I was seeing huge losses. There were a lot of weeks I saw 5 or 6 pound weight loss. For the record, ""going to the gym"" for me is a 40 minute walk, then I actually work out, then a 40 min walk home. So this ""beast mode"" mentality took a LOT of time, but I saw excellent results. At this point I stopped eating sandwiches (boo carbs) and pretty much started eating lots and lots and lots of vegetables and chicken. My main dinner of choice at this point was a bag of stir fry veggies (170 cal for the whole bag) plus a chicken breast and some teriyaki and sriracha sauce. And coffee of course. Right before Christmas I was 250. So I lost about 45 pounds in that 3 month span. (At this point I am down 120 pounds)

Over christmas break I gained about 7 pounds. Some of that was water weight, but a lot was not. I kind of pigged out. But such is life, and I moved forward.
Losing weight after 250 pounds was a lot harder than before. I had to adjust my calories to a lot lower levels, because I didn't have enough time to exercise 6 days per week. At this point I started going to the gym about 3 days per week . My diet was more or less: 2 eggs with toast, cheese, salsa, and coffee for breakfast, then some peanut butter for lunch, and then a big salad with chicken breast, or frozen veggies with chicken breast for dinner). At the end of march I was approximately 215 pounds (157 pounds lost, 35 of which were in this 3-month period).My diet at this point was about 1400-1500 cal/day, which is what I have had success with for the last ~6 months. It was about this time I adopted an intermittent-fasting type program, where I would eat ~500 calories for breakfast, ~100 cal snack during the day, and ~800 calorie dinner later at night close-ish to bed time. For me, I find the best way to restrict my calories is to just not LET myself eat unless it is “late enough”, at which point I (usually) have better self control about snacks. 

April/May/June was a really stressful period for me. I had a lot of stuff on my mind, and didn’t manage to exercise as much as I would like. At this point it was about 1 times per week average. I still kept strict overall about my calories though. At this point I ditched the toast in the mornings in favor of veggies, and tried to be as low carb overall as I could. I ate a lot of Nutella, though, lol. For some reason it is just AMAZING when I am stressing about school. :/ Not quite halfway through June, I am 192 pounds. So I have lost 180 pounds from my starting weight. I honestly never thought, when I started, I could even be below 200 pounds, and it’s really shocking for me to be so small now. 

For the future, my goal is 180 pounds. When I get to 186 I will be a healthy BMI and I will weigh 50% of my starting weight, which is a huge milestone. I hope to hit 186 in the next month or month and a half, and 180 by the end of the summer. At that point, I would like to get used to maintenance calories, then work on bulking up a bit. I don’t have access to a gym until September, unfortunately, so I am trying to start a C25K type program, but I’ve been really lazy lately. Up until last week, the only thing on my mind was finals. My weight loss has been a lot slower lately, since I’ve been below 200 pounds. I know I’m going to get to 180 eventually, and I’m just not willing to worry THAT much about enjoying my summer and eating a little more than I have been over the past year. 

Overall, one of the biggest changes I’ve made is just the fact that I really do like the taste of veggies now. You can eat SO MANY VEGGIES for so little calories, and if you cook them creatively you will be totally satisfied. I try to think about food as fuel for my body, and my body runs better with a healthy diet based around veggies and meats, than it does when fueled with sugars and breads. I still eat some carbs, but I am a lot pickier, and when I eat sugary stuff I really try to savor it. 

So yeah, Reddit, that’s my story. If you look at the pictures, you will see I have a lot of loose skin. It sucks, but at the same time, I feel a lot better, and I feel a lot more badass than I did when I weighed almost 400, even if my skin looks weird as fuck. I have some pictures from my heaviest time frame, but none that are very good. For some reason (cough) I hated having my pictures taken. So I’m sorry there aren’t any decent pics until I was already 80 pounds down, but oh well. I’m not sure if people really want to see tons of pics of a hairy guy lose a ton of weight, but I figure there’s gotta be one person out there at least who might relate to me and want to see that losing weight is totally possible. 

[Here are the pics. NSFW I guess. They start out with me at my heaviest, and show progress interval-pics up until my current weight, and then I have a few ‘tl;dr before after’ type pics. I’m sorry the editing is terrible, but I didn’t want to post full face pics, but I did want to show my chin as clearly as I could, because it definitely changed a lot lol. Sorry for poor quality, I don’t have a real camera.](http://imgur.com/a/9NuwU#0)

It was the biggest I had ever been and I knew I had a lot of work to do. 

I started tracking calories on my fitness pal, cutting out all the junk food and sodas, drinking tons of water and overall just making better food choices. About 3 months ago I started paleo, but I haven't been super strict with it. I love dairy, and I have my days where I mess up. 

Exercise wise, I do what I can. I walk on my treadmill every now and then, a have an exercise ball, I do squats and things while I'm cooking and try to move as much as I can while doing housework. I'm sure me breastfeeding has helped a ton too in the burning calories department. 

I weighed in today at 212 and would like to lose another 30-50 pounds. I'm hoping to join a gym soon and start toning up.

Where to start? I was always heavy, always. From elementary school forward, I was the ""fat kid"". By the time I graduated high school, I was over 350lbs. At age 34, I was over 550lbs. Worse yet, I led an extremely sedentary lifestyle.  
A vast combination of things finally led me to take control of my life and get serious about my health. With the help of my AWESOME wife, I found the courage to get over my fear of the Doctor's office and had all the cards laid out on the table.  
Luckily, I only had three medical issues: Hypertension, Sleep Apnea and Venous Insufficiency of the Legs. Not bad, considering. So I put together a plan. Initially it was just a reduced calorie diet. I worked hard to stay under 1500 calories a day. Eventually winter gave way to spring and my AWESOME wife got me outside and walking almost daily.  
By April I was down to 400lbs. Things just kept getting better and better. More energy, looser clothes, renewed confidence. My waist line went from 74 inches to 54 inches. I even have a frickin' Gym membership and personal trainer!  
Sorry for the rambling, I'm just really excited for what the future holds for the first time, in what seems like forever. This community has been a great source of support for me over the past few months and I just wanted to share my success.  
So what now? Next year I PLAN to have lost enough weight to accomplish the following: Buy season passes to Cedar Point for our family and ride all the rides with my Son. Something I had just assumed I would never be able to do is now within my grasp!  
Oh yeah, and my AWESOME wife? She's lost 70lbs and is training for Roller Derby.  How cool is that?  
   
**EDIT:**  
My AWESOME wife wanted me to point this out. The time between the pictures is close to two years. She believes I was actually heavier than 550lbs in the before photo. I can't be sure, because before I started losing weight, I hadn't really weighed myself in years.  
   
Also, I promised to provide some detailed answers to some questions. So here it goes:  
What kinds of meals did you eat?  
At first I didn't really know what I was doing. So I ate mostly vegetables and chicken. As my AWESOME wife and myself got more involved with researching foods, we kind of branched out a bit. Main staples are lean protiens and vegetables. Although my Doctor didn't reccomedn low carb, he also wasn't against it. I don't monitor my carbs, but I make a concious effort to keep them low. The main meals I prepare at home are salads, wraps or protein with vegetables. I absolutely love the 50cal whole wheat wraps from LaTortilla. They are fantastic. We cook our food for the week in a couple batches. So I'll dice up a ton of vegetables and cook up a mess of chicken/turkey/pork. That way we can make salads a wraps very easily during the week. For a while I stayed away from going out to eat and fast food. But for the last few months I've integrated them back into my life. I keep a list of the items at fast food joints I can eat and only order from those. (I have a kid and a really busy life, so fast food is not going away. But like everything, you just have to be smart about it.) At restaraunts I just had to learn how to be a pest and ask for substitutions. And use my smart phone to look up nutritional information, which rocks. I've cut out sugared drinks completely from my diet. I also no longer eat foods like chips, doritos or cheetos like a hoover switched to full power. If I have them at all, it's small amount for a special treat. I've just started eating desserts again recently, but I'm very cautious. I only eat them when I plan it in advance, never at the drop of a hat. Basically, I still don't really trust myself and am very vigilent to make sure I don't return to old habits. A cookie is a sometimes food bitches.  
How did you get started with exercise?  
Man, my AWESOME wife tried for the longest time before I started losing weight to get me more physically active. I was so resistant to it. But after I had lost like 50lbs, she just out of the blue asked if I wanted to go for a walk. I said, ""sure, why not."" She looked at me like I had just laid a golden egg on the carpet. We have a nice walking path near our house and it all started there. At first I could only do 1 or 2 laps (0.4 mile track) and I was out of breath and sore all over. I would walk a few times a week. Well we had a vacation planned to San Diego and I was determined that I was going to get fit enough to take my son to Disneyland and walk all day long. So I started hitting the path everyday until I could walk 5 laps without having to stop. (2.0 miles) Well I was down to 400lbs by vacation and I walked the SHIT out of Disneyland. I even was small enough to fit on some of the rides. Well that experience made me realize just how great my life was getting. Soon I was doing a 5K once a week and 2 miles on the rest of them. I pushed myself to get my times down and tried jogging for small portions. Eventually I got tired of the weather affecting my excercise and we joined a gym. Best decision ever. We workout almost daily and have been exposed to some really great routines that have pushed me to the next level. Currently I'm doing intervals on a treadmill with hand weights, stregthening muscles with free weights and increasing my flexibilty with stretching. Fantastic stuff, all of it.  
How long until you started feeling more energy?  
I would say I didn't really notice until I started excercising regularly. When I pushed myself to get ready for Disneyland I noticed a definite change. I also contribute a portion of this to the fact that I started using a BiPAP machine to treat my sleep apnea at this time. My oxygen levels levels were horrible during sleep and after a couples weeks of using the machine, I would literally spring out of bed in the morning. For the first time in years, I was rested after sleeping. IF YOU SNORE, GET A SLEEP STUDY. SLEEP APNEA IS BAD.  
What was the hardest thing?  
Going to the Doctor's office like a thousand times for countless tests to make sure I had all my health issues properly diagnosed. I hated going to the Doctor. Mostly because I was afraid of facing my own mortality. Iused to think I was afraid of death. But now I realize I was really afraid of early death. And as long as the Doctor didn't tell me I was going to die, I could ignore it. Which wasn't healthy at all. GO TO THE DOCTOR. THAT BASTARD WANTS TO HELP YOU.  
Do you feel like an alcoholic, do you feel like your old habits are just a couple of bad choices away?  
Oh my god, yes! A couple months ago I had a cupcake. And I was freaking out about this extra 300 or so calories for like two days afterwards. I still don't trust myself and worry about going back to my old ways all the time. But I'm getting better. I keep track of my calories and have accepted that in order to stick to my diet, I have to allow myself some flexiblity. If I cut everything out completely, I'll fail. But I have developed this weird alternative to diet cheating. I watch shows like ""Diners, Drive-ins and Dives"", ""Unique Sweets"", ""Eat Street"" and ""The Best Thing I've Ever Eaten"". It's like Pornography to me. I get all, ""Man, I would east the shit out of that."" And then I tear ass into some cucumbers and salsa. It's like I bait and switch my food cravings. It's bizzare, but it works for me.  
Do you have issues with extra skin?  
You mean this huge bag I now having hanging hanging from my midsection? I did a calculation once, and I figured I've lost around 25 gallons of body volume. So suffice it to say, I have skin issues. But I've kind of put that out of my mind for right now. I don't like the idea of surgery, so I hoping it will just shrink back up. But my Doctor says the chance of that isn't too good. So a couple years after I stop losing weight I guess I'll have to decide what to do about it.  
Was there some kind of mental shift? A tipping point?  
Yes, there was. A lot of my older relatives who were not nearly as overweight as I was were having tons of health problems. And then I got really sick for like a week with the flu and it took my out, completely. I laid in bed so long I compressed my Ulnar nerve. I had never felt pain like this before and was convinced I was having a some sort of heart trouble. I freaked out and went to the ER. They were extremely nice to me and told me I wasn't having a heart attack, I was just sore from laying in bed too much.  Well I decided enough was enough. I broke down in tears to my AWESOME wife and told I her I needed to get everything checked out and deal with all my medical issues. That I couldn't do this anymore. I couldn't live like this. So we made plan and have never looked back.  
How hard was the first day? Week? Month?  
The first day was horrible, only because it involed a visit to the Doctor's office that was going to be EPIC. The first week was better. I had a basic idea of what my health issues were and the plan was starting to come together. The first month sucked only because I was getting used to my new diet and trying to rearrange my life. Two months in I had done most of the hard things I had never wanted to do and I kind of had a rythym going. By April, I was in the zone.

This is my first progress post on here, and I just wanted to share a little bit about my journey (so far) to go along with my picture!

Age: 18

Height: 5' 7""

SW: 264

CW: 215.5

UGW: around 140 (or when I'm happy ;)

Background: Okay, so I've struggled with my weight my entire life.  I may not be that old, but my entire teen years were me being obese. November of 2012, around my 18th birthday, I was diagnosed with depression and anxiety (along with binge eating disorder).  In the same month, I was put on anti-depressants. 
Since then, my life has done a complete 180.  I no longer use food to cope with stress/my depression, and have lost 48.5 pounds since January 9, 2013! While I'm not quite halfway to my goal yet, I thought these pictures show a little bit of a difference!

How I'm Doing It!:
Like the majority of people on here, I'm eating less and moving more! But we all know it's not as easy as that ;).  I subscribe to Weight Watchers online and use that along with My Fitness Pal to get a general calorie intake of 1,150 Calories per day.  I try to shy away from cheat days since they can trigger my binge eating, and that would NOT be good (obviously).

Exercise:
I went from being one of those people who would find ANY excuse to not move all day to someone who is IN LOVE with working out.  My main choice for working out is the recumbent bike.  My dad built a gym in my basement with all of the cardio and strength equipment you can imagine, so I do mix it up occasionally.  I do around an hour on the bike everyday, as well as about 40 mins of calisthenics (jumping jacks, push-ups, jump rope).  Other days, I do workout videos like TurboFire and Blogilates (check her out on YouTube-love her!).  Every other day I also incorporate strength training on the Soloflex (yep, the one with the huge rubber bands instead of the weights...I LOVE IT). On there, I do mostly military press-esque lifting to hit my triceps.

Overall:
Weight loss DOES become easier. It really has to be a lifestyle change rather than a temporary ""diet.""  Work hard and you can do anything! YAY!

Okay, so I only have a face shot for now.  This is from 12/25/2012 to 3/31/2013.  Still have the same stupid crooked smile, don't have about fifty pounds: http://imgur.com/lPmkMLc

I have been working out/eating low calories each day for around 2 years now, and I was astonished at how different I look. I just I recently even began running each day (I'm still not great at it, but I'll get there). Now, at 23, I weigh in at 296, and I am still losing. I just felt like sharing my progress, and also thanking this subreddit for being inspiring to me (I only discovered it recently, but it really gives me an extra oomph when working out :P).

My mom was the kindest you could think of, she had no limits though. I abused that and got a coke + chips bag everyday and i started gaining weight. We had contact with the social services and i hated them. My mom hated them too. They had said that if i didn't start going to school and fix my problems i would be moved to a foster family. I called bullshit. I didn't believe them. 2 Years later they had called a foster family and asked them if they wanted me there. 4 Months later the social services got an answer and they accepted me. I knew nothing until 27th of August 2012 16:12PM when mom came home crying. I sat by her side and asked what she was crying about. She said ""The social services called today..."" I asked her ""What did they say that you are crying about?"". ""They said you will be moved to a foster family tomorrow at 9:00AM Victor..."" I bursted out crying as i ran into my room and just lied down on my bed and couldn't stop crying. After 2 hours of constant crying me and my mom accepted the situation. We knew everything was going to get better. We said to ourselves it will be good and we will keep contact. We started packing as i went to sleep later that day. I couldn't sleep all night.


28th of August 2012 7:30AM I woke up and ate breakfast as we already had packed. I spent the rest of the time with my mom watching TV and talking. The clock hit 9:05AM and they had still not arrived. My mom was getting angry because she thought that if it is such a big deal it is about they should be on time. 9:10AM They arrived. We heard the car they did not even have to come to the door and knock. I put on my shoes and jacket, took my bag and went out. My mom followed me slowly. I was greeted by two social services workers. I hated one of them so i did not respond to them when they said Hi to me. I put my bag in the car and sat down in the car, put on the seatbelt as i was crying. I heard one of the social services person say ""Goodbye."" And my mom answered with a light voice ""Bye..."" She waved at me and i waved at her we then took off. I was crying the whole ride to the foster family. When we arrived i was greeted by an older couple. They both hugged me as they saw that i was crying and that i was really sad about the situation. They invited us in and gave us something to drink and something to eat on. I didn't eat or drink. I was just crying. They were asking me simple Yes or No questions as i was crying. When i was a bit happier with the situation they showed me around and i was pretty excited by this point. They showed me photos of all the children that lived in the foster family. The foster family saw no problem with me going to school. They only saw problems in my lifestyle and my weight.


The first week there we started my excersice. We started by slow and short walks. We started with 1km (0.6 Miles) walks. We then increased it to 3km (1.8 Miles) as i lost more and more weight. We added some pushups and other workouts on the nights before i went to sleep. Halfway through i had lost 32pounds and i bought my first real clothes again. I skipped the candy in weekdays and only drank Juice mixed with Sparkling Water on the weekends. I ate normal portions of food, no diet. I ate special candy with lower calories and sugar so it did not affect my weight loss. My weigh-in day was Sundays. I was more and more happy for every little pound i lost. Now when i have lost 62pounds i bought my first 30-32"" Pants! Before i only wore 40-42"" And iam so happy i can finally wear 30-32"" Pants! I was so happy i started crying while trying them on. I still have some pounds to lose but that is not so much left :).

The smaller picture was around 2009 (weight loss didn't start until late 2010/early 2011), bigger picture is Dec 2011 [photo](http://i.imgur.com/QglDG.png)  

How it started: I got hardcore dumped and lost about 15 pounds from the initial depression. That little bit of weight gone made me feel a little better, so I started doing light exercise (as much as a depressed person can muster), all the while analyzing the things I was eating and why I at them. During my ""down time"" I finally realized that I was not only an emotional eater, but a comfort, boredom, ""I'll eat it cause it's there"" eater. For at least 5 months, I didn't touch sugar and barely bready foods. The less depressed I became, the harder I worked out until I was at -60lbs. When I got back to school (after leaving for a semester because of the depression), I hit the gym hard. I think by that time my metabolism had ""reset"" so the rest of the weight was easy to lose. I rarely eat when I'm not hungry and I started doing the Insanity workout (I'm in the 2nd week of the 2nd month).  

**TL;DR** Depression pushed me into body enlightenment and changed how I ate and thought. Started working out. Lost butt ton of weight from Jan 2011 to Dec 2011. Started Insanity in January.  

**Edit!!** Hey everyone! Thank you so much for your complements and encouragement! I'm super flattered :) I wanted to clear something up really quickly though. Some people did their homework (good job Reddit lol) and found that[ I posted this](http://www.reddit.com/r/happy/comments/pcpki/after_a_year_and_some_months_of_separation_hes/) about my ex coming back around. Yes, this is true. He did come back, even took me on a few dates, and has put it out in the open that he would like to try again. BUT WAIT before you start throwing tomatoes, the post was put up the day of the first date. He was my first love (first everything really), and what can I say, I'm a hopeless romantic. But he really has some growing to do on his own. He knows that and I know that as well. So, for the moment, no I have not taken him back. Still as single as the day I got dumped lol.

I don't have much to say as to how I lost it, I'm a firm believer that my way is **not** your way.  Basically I watched my calories and I started running (which is a big milestone for me, considering I needed help getting off of the couch!)

Height: 5'9""

Before: 335lbs 

16.25"" gone from my waist

13.5"" gone from my hips

More than 5"" gone from my neck (I started measuring it after I lost a lot""

30% of my starting weight is gone.

-My Bridesmaid dress this summer was about 6 sizes smaller than my wedding dress from 2008.

My calf is now about the same size as my neck :)

Before I needed hoisting off the couch if I laid down on it, and help with my socks. Now I go running for fun, and I can run for longer than my fit husband :)

Lost almost a whole shoe size

I sleep much better at night and my back problems/knee problems are mostly gone

Battled a dirty eating disorder (binge eating) that should have hospitalized me last fall. I had several deficiencies, heart problems and my muscles starting cramping up so badly I could barely move for days sometimes.  I could write a whole story on that all on it's own!!

In the future I'd like to go to around 140lbs, I don't plan on doing anything different with my diet, just lowering my calories as needed.  Yes, there are skin issues and when I'm smaller I hope to have surgery on my arms and well.. my whole torso including breasts.

EDIT: While I'm still at the top of the loseit page there is something I'd like to address.  If you think you have an eating disorder (Yes, compulsive eating and binge eating are eating disorders!!) then get them checked out by a professional!!  Just because you don't have anorexia or bulimia doesn't mean it's not serious.  Just because you're not stick thin doesn't mean you don't have an eating disorder.

I turned 30. My starting weight in March of 2010 was 538 pounds. The month after I started my weight loss mission, my wife and I decided I should do monthly progress pictures and measurements. I've been keeping track of everything since. [I have 21 progress pictures on my blog now.](http://foodisforfuel.com/progress-pics/)

I weighed in this morning at 269 pounds, which is exactly one half of what I weighed when I started. In a year and a half, I've cleaved myself in two. 

* My waist is 26 inches smaller. 
* My hips are 25.5 inches smaller.
* My chest is 19.25 inches smaller.

I get asked often how I was able to do it. The answer is inception. Through communities like these, an idea got planted in my brain that wouldn't have been planted otherwise. The idea was that I could be great; that I could take control of myself and become not just a functioning human being but an athlete and become better than I'd ever been. I spent years in a dark room, lit only by my monitor. Blue sky hurt my eyes. But then through the same Internet that helped me destroy my life, I found the foundation to rebuild.

* [SomethingAwful's Ultimate Transformation Thread](http://forums.somethingawful.com/showthread.php?threadid=3334499) is similar to [LoseIt's Hall of Fame](http://www.flickr.com/photos/loseit/sets/72157626414086985/show/http://www.flickr.com/photos/loseit/sets/72157626414086985/show/) and it hit me like a ton of bricks. I scrolled down seeing people changing everything about themselves. Picture after picture of people on the Internet who took control.

After years of self loathing and depression, I saw a tiny dot of light. It's easy to let yourself die when you think you have nothing to live for -- no purpose or reason to exist. But that tiny dot of light became everything to me.

* I picked a diet. [Ketogenic low carb](http://josepharcita.blogspot.com/2011/03/guide-to-ketosis.html) fit my needs the best.
* I took my fitness seriously but also took it slow.

I knew that I'd quit if I tried to push myself too hard, which was a conclusion that I made from a large sample size -- a life spent quitting everything. I started off doing simple body weight exercises and used some lame 20 lb dumb bells to do presses and flys.

I dynamically assigned myself workout routines based on the adaptation of my body to its new size as I got smaller. As I became more fit, I pushed myself more. I eventually felt good enough to start lifting heavier weights. 

* I got a weight bench because I knew I was too ashamed to work out in front of people and if I tried to force myself to do it, I'd quit.
* I studied different lifting programs and ended up using [sean10mm's Modified Starting Strength](http://goonlifter.wikispaces.com/sean10mm's+Modified+Starting+Strength) program.

Last year around this time, I still weighed 424 pounds. I'd lost 114 pounds but I was still super morbidly obese. This is what I think back to when people now ask me how I kept going -- how I found the will power to keep pushing forward.

* [This is what I looked like on my birthday last year.](http://foodisforfuel.com/wp-content/gallery/progress/424-11-03-10.jpg)

The reason I kept going is because when I looked in the mirror, I didn't see that face or body. I saw what I would be today, and today, I see what I'm going to be in 6 months. In 6 months, I'll see what I'm going to be in a year.

I was able to lose so much weight because I never thought about how flawed I was. I only thought about how I could become who I wanted to be and when that was the only thought flooding my mind, my imperfections became irrelevant because ultimately, they were temporary.

Now I'm using [Jim Wendler's 5/3/1 weight training system](http://www.amazon.com/Simplest-Effective-Training-Increase-Strength/dp/0557248299/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1320247531&amp;sr=8-1), which is more advanced, but works well with my goals and my declining strength as I cut weight. I modified it to include more volume as I felt able to do more.

Yesterday, I did 59 deadlift reps. I did 125 curl reps. I did 53 push ups. I did 57 overhead barbell squats. I lift weights 4 days a week. I play basketball -- just shooting by myself -- for something like 5 hours a week. I didn't have a cake because I no longer arbitrarily attach food to celebrations or holidays. I discovered that food is for fuel and that real joy needs to come from life experiences. The joy of mobility trumps the ever-living-hell out of the joy of icing.

I can do that now because I didn't kill myself in a gym or on a treadmill a year ago. I didn't tempt myself to quit so I could push through it and become a ""better person"" for it. I didn't get a personal trainer's raging spittle all over my grill. I paced myself and my fitness evolved with my body. You don't have to render yourself breathless to be able to truly appreciate the air you breathe. You just have to keep breathing.

* [Here's a video of my fitness evolution.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBBU-Cuosfg&amp;feature=channel_video_title) I did my first dips with good depth last week.

So happy birthday to me. Next year, I'm going to be even better. My life still isn't what I want it to be but I don't give a shit what it is now. I'm interested in what it can be tomorrow, or the next week, or the next month, or the next year. And next year, I'll be focusing on who I'll be the year after that.

I'm half the man I used to be but I'm nowhere near the man I'm going to be.

A little about me:
	I’m 25 and married with no kids. When I started making changes last fall I was unemployed and finishing my last semester of school. Throughout the past year I have been able to spend all of my time focusing on weight loss and running. I only recently got a part time job (about 20 hrs a week). Having no major responsibilities has made this a fairly easy process.

How’d I lose the weight?

* Counting calories over at MyFitnessPal
* Changed the quality and quantity of the food I was eating
* Exercising consistently. I began with the goal of 30 minutes a day,every day. I started running as a way to challenge myself and ended up falling in love with it immediately. 
* I quit smoking. They say you are more likely to gain weight whenyou quit, but it actually made me want to exercise more.

My favorite weight loss tools: 
1. MyFitnessPal
2. Food scale
3. Polar ft4 heart rate monitor

What I’m doing now:
     I've still got about 20 more lbs I’d like to lose. It’s coming off slowly, but I’m okay with that. I’ve been losing the same 4-8 lbs for a month now, but I’m losing inches like crazy because of consistent exercising (half-marathon training). I’m still counting my calories and eating well. I’m running a 10k on Thanksgiving, a 5k on Dec. 1, and another half on Dec. 16. After that run, I plan on picking up a consistent weight lifting routine and giving my running legs a bit of a rest. I have yet to do any consistent lifting, unless you count carrying groceries in the house a couple times a week. 

Thanks for reading!

I am not sure what to say about this.  I didn't use any tricks to lose the weight.  I eat SOOOOO much better and I started working out.  I would be very happy to answer any questions you have, feel free to ask. I am just not sure what people will want to read about.

I still want to lose another 40 pounds or so, but I am going to start trying to build more muscle, so I will see how the extra weight lose goes.

Thanks for looking :)

My Story: when I started at 317 pounds I only was walking 1 to 2 miles a day. Over time I was able to increase it up to 8 Miles. However it is too hot now in Arizona to go outside I'm using a machine at home.  I go to the gym and lift every other day but I've been particularly careful to make sure I stuck with it for the last 2 months.  as for calories I originally just started by cutting back on everything. Now I make sure I am only eating 1400 to 1500 calories a day.


Details:

Diet:  

I first started out by strictly reducing what I was eating.  I also broke up my 3 meals a day and terrible snacks into smaller, smarter meals every two hours.  It really helped with the cravings during the day.  I discovered how much I liked fruits and veggies.  this was a HUGE help.  Once I got the ball rolling, I started to count my calories after I had the 20 pound, 1st moth drop..  Since then, I have been working to add more and more protein into my diet and have been hovering between 1400-1500 calories a day.  What I have not done is cut out ANYTHING for my diet entirely.  I still enjoy some junk, but I no longer eat large pieces of cake or entire candy bars.  Everything gets halved, at least.  I don't eat them every day either.

Cardio Workouts:

I started out with just walking 2 miles a day, but that built up pretty quickly.  There is a mall a mile away from where I live, so I would walk there every day.  Then I decided the target that was a litter further down the road as not so far, so I added that on every day.  By the time I had added on extra distance, my ""short walk"" was 6 miles.  Right before it had gotten hot outside again, I was doing 7-8 miles a day.  Now that it is hot, I am using a gazelle for cardio every day.  I am also starting to run a little, but I can not push it too hard since I had a fractured ankle years ago.  I would love to build up a tolerance though.

Lifting workouts:

In December I started hitting the gym, but I was only doing some light stuff to try to reduce hanging skin.  By the end of December,, I body building who lives in my building kinda took me under his wing for a few weeks and really showed me the right way to do free weights.  Over the course of 3 months I kinda just stuck with the things I liked and enjoyed and have been increasing the weights.

Its 25lbs down! Right now this means so much to me. That first pic was after a 12 min mile run and it was 1 mile. That second was after a 10 min mile run of 2 miles.

Slowly but surely I'm getting there!

Fixed. . . I did not run 10 mph.

And because the mods took down my images and are not as happy about the weight loss as myself and y'all, here's how I did it (as per their request). I cut calories down with the assistance of MyFitnessPal. They automatically calculate it down, but I'm down to 1200 cal a day, but it really varies between 1200-1500cal. I work out a lot, with focus on arm, glute, and back weight lifting. Overall I try to keep the weight lifting even. I completed c25k and have (as stated above) improved my mile, my distance, and my capability to run without stopping or getting too winded. I also use Fitocracy and get at least 100 points a day. This is enhanced my productivity in body weight work outs.

My life was great. At the time I had lost about 100lbs, I had a loving husband whom I had been with for 7 years and then boom, bomb dropped. He cheated on me with two women at the same time, both who were much larger than me. My self esteem dropped to the lowest that it's ever been and I've been 330lbs. I kept to my gym schedule but thought in my head I'll never find better. I mean hell, he loved me at my biggest so that means something right?
WRONG. I finally pulled the plug and my self esteem has never been higher. My continuing weight loss and support from my amazing gym family gave me the solid ground to allow myself to say no more and it feels amazing.

**20 year old female
Starting weight 230
5'9''**

So I am scared out of my wits to post this picture, but I am really proud of myself! I've been working extremely hard in the last couple months to become healthier.

Before puberty, I was extremely skinny. Around that time, my best friend killed herself and I lost a lot of family members. I started anti depressants, which totally messed with my weight right as I was starting to develop. **In two years, I gained 60 pounds. Since then, I've always been the fat friend.**In middle school and high school I ballooned up to 240 pounds at my heaviest.**I doubled my damn weight.**


 Everyone knows me as the artsy fat girl. I'm so fucking done with that, it's not even funny.



**I've always been physically active**, even at my peak weight. I'm professionally trained in Kung Fu and multiple weapons. I am also an award winning archer  (and began training for the junior Olympics, but has to quit the sport because I shattered my wrist while playing soccer) and I was on the basketball team in high school. Working out has never been something too difficult for me. I just started eating more and more to comfort myself whenever I felt fat and disgusting. 


 I've been battling depression and crippling anxiety for years now. I've cut, attempted suicide, been in and out of the hospital, developed a drinking and drug problem, and many other terrible things. **I saw a picture of myself with my boyfriend last year, and that was the turning point for me. I felt shameful at how much I've let myself go.**

So, I've quit all the nasty and harmful habits. My depression and anxiety are still as bad, but I am now seeing someone for it so I hope that goes away. 

So, thank you to whoever reads the whole thing. Your support in this means the world to me. 

**In the picture, I am at my starting weight of 230  (on the left) and on the right, I am 30 pounds down.** I don't see much of a difference, but I know that as I get smaller I will see it more. http://i.imgur.com/UYyqO3Q.jpg

ANOTHER EDIT**** post was taken down for not including details to what my weight loss regimen is: so, copied and pasted from the comments, it's now up here. 


The first thing I did was cut out soda completely. I absolutely love root beer so that was tough. Then I started eating breakfast, instead of skipping it and eating a massive dinner. I figured when I eat breakfast it keeps me full throughout the day, and at night I am not as hungry. I haven't been counting calories, but I've certainly been more careful about what I eat. It's easy to overeat when someone at work brings cookies, a friend wants to go get frozen yogurt, another friend wants pizza, etc. I suggest healthier outtings and don't partake in eating just because it's there anymore. Also, every time I have a negative impulse, like I want to drink or cut or do anything harmful to myself, I make myself do some kind of exercise. Small or little, doesn't matter. Just anything.

I started at 290 lbs and was obese pretty much all my life.  I never knew what it was like to be a normal weight.  Even now, as I can start to see/feel cheek and hip bones, it's a bit weird, because that's just never, ever happened before.


Right now, I'm down to 185 and am roughly 20 lbs away from not being overweight!  

As for how it happened, I lost 90 lbs in college by cutting calories and going to the gym.  But, regrettably, I hadn't seen the changes I made as permanent, because I'd still binge often enough, my weight would yo-yo during the semesters, and ultimately, in grad school, I got back up to 250 lbs.


BUT I decided that wasn't for me.  Last year, I bought a mini home elliptical and starting using it several times per week.  I started regulating my calorie intake (I eat about 1800 per day) and cutting down drinking to a couple times per week.  I started buying loads of fresh produce, cooking tons, and had the fortune of starting a new job where I can walk 1.5 miles to work every day.

More recently, I've taken up something that the heavy me would have never, ever have dreamed of doing:  dancing!  I've started salsa lessons and now take a Zumba class every week.  And it feels so amazing!  


Other things that have helped me on the way:  

*  calorie counting (it was mundane at first, and now it's just a super easy routine).  I use the Calorie Count app on my phone

*  spaghetti squash

*  Vitamuffins (mmm, 100 calories of fudgy chocolate) 

*  lean protein (including low fat Greek yogurt!).  I try for 100g of protein every day.

*  veggies in all the things

*  stevia instead of sugar (at least for me)

*  drinking hot tea at work

*  setting non-food rewards for weight loss (my dress in the Salsa pics was my 100 lbs reward :) )

*  slow cooking tasty meals (see http://rainydaygal.com/2009/11/17/crock-pot-gyros/ and try it with your own tzaziki sauce!)

*  plain oatmeal with all sorts of awesome thrown in  (I like peanut butter, cocoa powder, sugar free maple syrup, almonds, baked apples, cinnamon, bananas, yogurt--not all of those at once, but pick and choose a few, and they're delicious!)

*  high protein, low cal pitas and tortillas (I like Joseph's)

*  having maintenance days (2000-2050 calories) every 7-10 days

*  having a cheat day (3,000-3500 calories) once per month or so

*  slightly reducing (but not cutting out) carbs.  Getting rid of nearly all simple carbs.

As for how I feel--I mean, part of it is disbelief.  I couldn't imagine walking around with 105 more pounds on me!  I used to hate moving in any capacity, and now I LOVE to walk and dance!  I have so much more energy, too!  

I still have body issue stuff to work out (dear butt, y u no slim down?!), but things are getting better the longer I go.  And now that I have maintenance and cheat days as outlets, I find myself not bingeing anymore, for the first time in forever!

Been saving up for this. These aren't the best pictures. My hair is kind of a mess in all of them haha. I don't have many of just me.

I started trying in January 2011. The first thing I did was cut out soda and I lost 10 pounds without doing anything else. I then started to slowly eat better, try new foods, eat more salad. 

I lost about 35 pounds the first 8 months or so and then stopped trying for the next 8 months. Didn't gain any weight during that time thankfully. I started up again and at this point, I still wasn't doing any exercise. I started using myfitnesspal last summer. It ended up becoming much easier later on. I wasn't that hungry any more. I added in some cardio starting last summer, but that's been on and off. It's mostly just been about the eating. 

I feel awesome! I've changed my calorie limit to just sustaining my weight now, but I usually come under my limit and slowly still losing weight. I'm going to try working out more this summer to build muscle and get in shape.

So I started a low carb diet and began exercising.


**Exercise:**
The first 3 months or so I would go on a 5km walk every day, then when summer rolled around I started going on 12-30km bike rides every day, then in September I joined a gym and started going 6 days a week, the past month I've started weight training and in the new year I'm switching gyms and want to begin MMA classes.

**Diet:**
As I already said, low carb paleo diet and try to not go over 1200 calories a day. I mostly just eat ""smart"" now, avoiding really unhealthy stuff, although I have a cheat meal every so often so I don't lose my mind.

**General Info:**
I'm male, 5'9, and am 25 years old.

My goal weight is somewhere around the 160-170lbs range.

I've posted here before so this might provoke some deja-vu. I use my TRX (www.trxtraining.com) at least 5 times/week, though when I first started I committed to every 2 days at least. I eat a lot more fruits and vegetables, and a lot less junk. (Though, I still allow myself to eat what I want, just in smaller portions than I used to). I don't count calories, but I eat less and move more. I like to walk long distances and bike when I have somewhere to get to, but my exercise routine is mainly strength building with my TRX.

I hope to inspire someone with this - all this change took was one small year (like, seriously, it went by so fast), and a commitment to getting fitter by working out 3-4 times/week.

**TL:DR I stopped sucking at life.**

*Note: I've told my transformation story here before, but haven't in awhile, and every time I do, I get feedback a few months later from someone that used my story to inspire themselves. That's my life's purpose these days, so please excuse the repetition.*

I got a raise.

A big one. It was my first ever, in fact. I didn’t ask for it, nor did I whine about money until my superiors felt guilty enough to throw me a bone; I simply worked hard, remained patient, and got recognized for it. Given my history, it was one of the best feelings I’ve ever experienced.

In 2010, I weighed 538 pounds and I was battling with severe agoraphobia. I had only left my house a handful of times in the previous decade. I was 28 years old in 2010, debt was piling up on my wife and I, and my life was crumbling around me.

From age 15, suicide was a daily thought and the idea of non-existence permeated my fantasies. I eventually dropped out in the 8th grade because I never did well in school, I was about to be held back for the third time in my life, and my school career was just going to end one way or another. I sank into the Internet.

I was in a top 50 World of Warcraft raiding guild and spending 18 hours a day playing. Before World of Warcraft, it was EverQuest, and before EverQuest, I played role-playing games (MUDs) from a dialup BSDi shell. An exquisite ability to pretend to be anyone but myself was a talent that I spent nearly 20 years practicing.

In March of 2010 – after discovering the ketogenic diet – I was finally convinced that I wasn’t an inherently broken human being; I discovered that, in fact, it was entirely the food I was eating that was breaking me.
I transformed. 

As the weight rapidly came off, my confidence improved, and I was more capable of venturing out of my house. I was still in the 400s and it was a terribly uncomfortable experience, but I went to see Inception with my wife and brother. I worked my way up to a Carolina Panthers game in September of 2011 when I weighed 330 pounds.

During my transformation, I intensely studied fitness and nutrition. Before 2010, I never realized to what degree the human body could be manipulated and bent to the will of its owner. I spent a lot of my teens in the hacking and phreaking culture of the early and mid 1990’s; when I realized in 2010 that the human body could be hacked too, it was game on.

I dove into research, read every blog I could find, and studied human anatomy. I was so passionate about it that I quit playing video games all together. I didn’t have anything against them but I just didn’t care about anything else anymore.

In November of 2011, I was introduced to Dr. Jeffrey Galvin after I had reached out to a local gym. I was looking for janitorial work because I just wanted to be around fitness and possibly shadow their personal trainers. I knew I wanted a career in fitness. Dr. Galvin had just opened a branch of his business, Vitality Medical Wellness Institute, on the second floor of the gym. The head personal trainer introduced us after reading my e-mail.

Vitality was a wellness clinic. Weight loss, bioidentical hormone replacement therapy, and fitness optimization were his practice’s specialties. I talked Dr. Galvin into allowing me to volunteer my time to handle the office’s IT needs. My initial title was Systems Administrator and I didn’t have a car or a license (lost them when I became too fat to utilize them), so I had my Mom take me to the office most days.


I enjoyed the IT work and I excelled at it. I volunteered for about a month before they decided to pay me. It was the first job I’d had in over a decade. My interest was purely working with people to help them lose weight. I was in the perfect place for that but at the same time, any patient interaction was conducted under the umbrella of Dr. Galvin’s license. I wouldn’t have trusted me with patients if I were in his position.

However, in December of 2011, a woman named Alisha struggled up the steps after her personal trainer had recommended Dr. Galvin. She had gone from 220 pounds to 160, but she had Lupus and it was just getting worse; inflammation and joint pain wrecked her quality of life. Alisha was driven from her career as an ER nurse to working with physically and sexually abused children because the ER was too demanding of her body.

She came to Dr. Galvin because she was stalled at 160 and her Lupus flares were getting worse. Her new job with the kids kept her late at work and the only appointment she could keep was 5:30 PM. Our office closed at 5:00 PM but I volunteered to stay later so that I could relay instructions from Dr. Galvin.

Something magical happened. Put me in a crowd of people and I freeze. Place me in a position to perform or speak in front of people and I freeze. I spent my life avoiding social interaction and as a result, I spent my life observing instead. Coupled with codependency and my weight loss insight, I stepped into a role that I was perfectly suited for. As it turns out, I very accurately read people's emotions.

As Alisha and I talked, I felt worth for the first time ever. I felt like I brought something to the table. She felt trapped inside of her body just as I had. As she spoke, I felt as though I could see right through her, and she recognized it too. After a month, Alisha’s Lupus flares were completely gone. She was doing CrossFit and losing weight again.

She was doing so well that Dr. Galvin started to trust me a little more and allowed me to meet with some of his other patients. I earned the title Health &amp; Wellness Advocate and those patients also did very well.

I kept up with my Systems Administrator duties, learned how to design websites, and learned graphic design; I wanted to save the practice money, so I just decided to do the marketing materials. Multiple times, Dr. Galvin walked in on me still at the office past 12AM. I worked so hard that my family began to accuse the Galvins of taking advantage of me (they weren’t).

I got my license back, got a car, and started dressing in slacks with tucked in button-downs and dress shoes. I was undergoing another transformation; people walking into the practice for the first time often mistake me for a physician.

To date, [I’ve had a hand in helping all of the people who have testimonials on our website](http://vitalitymwi.com/transformations/), including Alisha’s husband Dave. He was the first patient that Dr. Galvin okayed to use a nutrition protocol that I designed for fat loss. The protocol is designed to allow for fat loss while retaining or building lean mass.

* [This is Dave’s most recent DEXA scan.](http://vitalitymwi.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/newdexa.png)

*Note: All credit to Dave for his transformation. This dude is one of the most determined and focused people I've ever met. The last 3 months between his DEXA scans were with a torn rotator cuff. He put on 8 pounds of muscle one-armed.*

Anyway, I got a raise and I wanted to share what lead to that raise. It would have been very easy to quit, or even to never send that e-mail to the gym. It would have been easy to resign myself to the fact that an 8th grade education doesn’t land many people in good jobs. I could have gone home at 5:00 PM with everyone else and left Alisha without a place to go. I could have listened to the people telling me to not work until 9PM for free.

The transformation of my body is eye catching, but the transformation of my soul is what I’m the most proud of. I haven't had a suicidal thought in almost 2 years. Investing in my future became much less of a burden when the idea of a new dawn stopped being such a shitty thought.",,False,,t5_2rz8w,False,,250lbs,True,t3_1anp2w,http://www.reddit.com/r/loseit/comments/1anp2w/nsv_i_got_a_raise/,

I say 350+ because my scale actually would not go any higher than 350, it would just say error. I had a few days at my heaviest where I would step on the scale and it would just say error, then a few days later it would say 349 again. 

My moment of ""I can finally do this"" weight loss came while watching an episode of the Random show with Kevin Rose and Tim Ferriss and Tim mentioning his new book The Four Hour Body. I heard Tim talk about the diet and it finally clicked that this was a diet I could follow, and follow well. 
After losing about 10lbs over 6months (350-340) I started the Four Hour Body on January 4th 2010, and last month in February I finally hit 200lbs and I could not feel better.
Also in the last couple months I have been hitting the gym ad starting to build up with weights. Hopefully that will be another post next year.

I was overweight my entire life until I started dieting when I woke up one day and realized I'll be unhappy and single forever if I continue being a WoW addicted hambeast. I lost the first 50 pounds (22.7 kg) over the course of five months by walking 2 miles (3.3 km) a day, and eating &lt;20 carbs of bacon, eggs, cheese, steak, hamburger, seafood, and butter. I plateaued for about a month, slowly worked my way up to jogging 5 miles (8 km) a day, changed my diet to 100g protein from lean sources such as chicken breast, egg whites, fish, and low-fat cheese, and lost 100 pounds (45.5 kg) more over the next five months.

It took a crazy amount of discipline, willpower, and commitment to get to where I'm at, and it will forever blow my mind that I was strong enough to change my lifestyle and ultimately transform into an athletic babe at optimal health in under a year. And next week I'm sealing the deal with a tummy tuck. I'll have to get a better camera and take some bomb before/after shots.

I take the issue of offering help with weight loss pretty seriously, so it is hard for me to know where to start. I know how it feels when you are over weight and you see no relief in sight. You have the billion dollar weight loss industry constantly shoving mis-information about what could help you lose weight, in efforts to sell a book/gym membership/iphone app.

I don't know where to start with my story, so I will start at the end of my life as an obese human being. 

I was alone, with tears in my face, and I was headed upstairs to hang my self. 

I had thoughts of suicide since I was 10 or so. I was an overweight kid from the age of 8 + and that fact did not go unnoticed by plenty of people. At any sign of something negative in my life the words, ""ahh just kill your self"" would be happy to flash into my head. 

As the years went on the words would flash more often and even in times when I should have been happy. I then started a new flash of words in my head, ""Shut up."". The two flashes did battle for years. 

I was always blessed with some great friends though so I was able to find happiness in my life with that. Until one day I received a job offer in WA, I took the job and moved away from all my friends and family. 

This brings us back to climbing the stairs. I was living in WA for 6+ months and the rainy season couldn't have been helping. I no longer could bring my self to shut out the constant drum in my head that I should just kill my self. 

I had decided to use a wider rope so my neck wouldn't snap, I wanted to die by the weight of my own body. A punishment of sorts, I hated my self. I had tried for years to lose weight. I spent a year plus with a personal trainer and I was back to my original weight before him(removed 30 or so). I hated my failure. 

Every step was harder than the last. I was trying to look for an excuse to not do it and was coming up short. I made it half way up the steps and dropped to my knees. I knew if I went any further, that was it. 

That was it, I wouldn't go up further and I wouldn't retreat. I was at the lowest point in my life. Everything I grasped for to stop my self seemed empty and powerless. 

Maybe it takes being to that point, but the image of my self changed. I realized, I hadn't done everything I could do, I would constantly cheat on eating food, or workouts. You must lose your pride and face hard truths.

I also realized, that means I had a chance. I was going to take that chance but I also wanted go about it the right way. I then used sites like digg(hey it was a few years ago, shh) and reddit(yay). 

I would constantly find articles about how the human body would process food or how adrenaline boosts metabolism for hours. I found articles on why we are addicted to food. It was no longer information that some asshole was trying to sell me in a book or diet. 

I armed my self with data. I only trusted papers with valid sources and within 6 months I had done something I didn't think possible, I dropped below 300 pounds for the first time since high school. 

The reason I decided to post here in loseit is their faq has a real solid mentality that I respect highly. Control that diet and exercise. 

Friends ask me for advice and I always start with 2 things. Don't eat like an American and change your life style.

Don't eat like an American: 

I hate diets. I hate the term diet. It is drawn too parallel with the idea of a temporary thing. If you change the way you eat forever, you will forever be changed.

I spent some time in Japan and Australia(worst plane rides ever when fat). Every time I would come back, I would notice something. I could not eat even half of what was given to me in a meal. Any where I went, there was too much food to eat. Within a few days that was not an issue and I was shoving that stuff down again no problem. This was the basis of what changed me I think. 

I was able to think on a time when I ate less and still felt just as full. Even now people will state that I eat like a bird, I like to think that I eat like a human. :P Eat slowly and let your brain realize you are full.

The even bigger part about the not eating like an American, High Fructose Corn Syrup. This is the single thing I refuse to eat. I attribute this study / video to one of the most important I have ever come across.

Change your life style:

I spent multiple years in the gym. I would work out for 1-2 hours a day at the start of this. I have found, if you change your self to being a more active person by nature, it will come off naturally. I rarely go to the gym and the most rapid weight loss times I experienced have come from just day to day living. I walk every day. I walk everywhere. If there are stairs, I walk up those bitches 2 at a time. I take every opportunity I have to get up and do something. If you are hoping to be different, you need to be different.(sounds lame but true!)

Me now:

It has been 4+ years since obese me died. I rarely weigh in as I don't find it as helpful, but I last weighed in at 202 and im pretty sure I broke under 200 as my clothes keep getting more baggy, I was 410 at my worst. I still worry and have to watch my steps, this will probably be for the rest of my life. I can promise you this though, even if you talk to me now on one of my worst days, it is still one of the best days of my life.

I spent most of last year just doing your standard keto diet without any exercise, but I got stuck in a plateau around September, so I started going to the gym and doing a 5x5 program (not very well) around October. In January I got a trainer, who has been having me doing all sorts of different types of exercises. I'm thinking of starting back up on a lifting program (probably Starting Strength) for Saturday, Tuesday, and Thursday, in addition to doing cardio on Monday and Friday and seeing my trainer on Wednesday, but I'm not sure yet. I'd like to try to start building up some muscle because I know I'm going to have to deal with a lot of loose skin (which I'm already starting to have some problems with) when I get to where I want to be.


When all is said and done, I'd like to lose at least another hundred pounds.

I'm really proud of myself for doing this, and I hope I keep it up.

When I went to the doctor two weeks ago, I weighed 273 lbs. For a 5 feet 2 inches tall woman, that's a lot. I've been overweight all of my life and have gained ~100 lbs. since graduating high school in 2008. I tried to work out and diet a lot in college, but kept getting discouraged or busy with school work and working. Now that I'm graduated from college, working and ready to finally get all of this weight off. I just turned 23 and there's no time like right now. I'm sick of my weight. This ends here.

It took a lot of building myself up to walk into the gym. Looking back, I feel so stupid for putzing around my apartment getting dressed in workout clothes, and then for nearly crying in the car because I was so embarrassed. Up until recently, I've always had a false idea that I was significantly smaller than I am. My recent realization has really kicked me into going.

I walked into the gym and the guy at the counter was so friendly. He helped me get started and offered me a killer deal on signing up. He showed me the equipment, told me about the classes they offered and said that if I had any questions that all I needed to do was ask. He was friendly and didn't seem to be judging me for my weight. In fact, nobody there really seemed to be judging me. Everyone was kind of minding their own business, maybe working out with a workout buddy. It was cool.

Actually working out was a little difficult. I did a mile on the elliptical and 15 minutes/5 miles on the bike, and then stretched. I struggled with keeping a good pace, but I challenged myself It's a small start but compared to sitting on my butt all night, it's a difference. It feels really good to be this sore.

I'm signing up for The Color Run in October, so I have a training goal that will help keep me focused during the times that the scale isn't being friendly.

I'm really excited though and proud of myself. I just wanted to share my story because I feel really good. And if anyone reading this is nervous about going to the gym, JUST DO IT. I promise that it'll be worth it. I can't wait to put flair next to my username!

Thanks for listening, LoseIt!

Calorie counting has been the biggest influence though. In terms of macronutrients, I try to stay under 150g of carbs per day - no bread/pasta/rice/potatoes - all of which comes from vegetables or fruits.

Well, exercise and portion control, eating a sensible amount of food made a huge difference.
Epecially rice and pasta.
She also got me into running, which is something I'd never done before.

**Backstory**

A lot of info is in the album, but I thought I'd add some other stuff. I'm 6'1 and 20 years old. When I hit my peak weight at 270lbs (122.5kg for my friends outside the US) I had been severely depressed for the past 2 years and absolutely no fun to be around. One of the factors of my depression was my weight itself. This lead me to eat, and the viscous cycle continued. After my girlfriend of 5 years broke things off because she felt ""I couldn't keep up with her image"" I went into fuck everything mode and fell from the valedictorian of my class to a guy who found himself kicked out of high school. I began laying around, calling off of work, and being a grade A asshole to my friends. Luckily for me, they were better people than I was at the time and no matter how much I frustrated them, they never left. As I neared the 270lb mark, I considered suicide and decided it would be better to be dead, fat, and miserable than alive, fat, and miserable. I was ready for the end. Luckily, that night I got a call. My grandfather called to let me know my grandmother (who was very sick with cancer) would probably pass away that night and if I wanted to say anything, now would be the time. My memories of the years before and during this time are clouded by a ""depression haze."" One thing, however, remains clear. My grandmother's last words to me were, ""Kevin, everything is going to be alright."" I'm not sure what switch in my brain flicked on, but she was definitely the one who hit it. It was at this point I decided to change everything about my life. I enrolled in Cyber school to finish the credits I needed, and I began trying to actively feel better about myself and life in general. When I finally got down to 235lbs (106.5kg), I saw my old girlfriend in the store. She selfishly assumed that the weight loss had been to impress her and congratulated herself for it. She then proceeded to tell me that no matter how much weight I lose, I wouldn't be able to ever attract a woman (what a bitch). This was the point at which I stopped for a month and gained 5 pounds. It took a few old acquaintances and some kind words to reenergize my mind for the long haul. For New Years, I made a decision to be at 180lbs (81.5kg) before the end of the year and I began losing weight again. Flash-forward to now. I have my high school diploma, I haven't been depressed for months, I'm happy both about myself and the world around me, and my friends can't tell me enough how different I look and act. When I was 270lbs I used to make the comment that ""fat guys don't run"" and that was the exact way I felt. I knew I could still run, but had absolutely no want to. Since I've lost 85lbs however, when I go outside I want to run, play a game, just do something. When you are that overwieght you forget the little things you used to do, like just sprinting from your car to your house for no reason, or running to catch up with people instead of making them walk slower to catch up. I love this, all of it. It's amazing having so much more energy to do things. I'm a heck of a lot less self-conscious than I was before. I can go out into public and not think, ""I wonder if those girls are making fun of me."" While this was an irrational fear, it was very real, but has since disappeared. If anything, I'm more likely to wonder, ""Should I strike up a conversation with them?""

*TL;DR* I'm a 20 year old, 6'1 male. At 270lbs, I was depressed and life kinda sucked. It took a loss and a break-up for me to realize I wanted to do something about my weight and life outlook. I began last summer, lost 30lbs, realized how much of a bitch my Ex was and stopped over December. In January I started back up and have lost 55lbs since, making it 85lbs total.

**How I did it**

* The first months of my weight loss were strictly done by eating less calories. I used the LoseIt app on my phone and simply counted everything I ate, while honestly tracking my weight fluctuations. I completely recommend this if you are new to weight loss. LoseIt comes with cool little achievements you can earn, which can help to excite and motivate you in the weight loss. It sets up your caloric intake based on your weight, height, gender, and how much you want to lose. It might be hard at first to keep track every day. I struggled at first to count everything because ""one little cookie won't matter,"" but when you do really get into it and track every little thing, you'll be amazed at how quickly the weight comes off. Seriously. I lost 30 pounds in 5 months by just eating less, you CAN do this.

* The second round of weight loss (starting in January) I found it difficult to lose the amount of weight I wanted simply by watching calories. I began researching what the best way was. I came to the decision that I'd try some HIIT (High Intensity Interval Training) in the form of the Insanity work out. This, combined with better eating habits, LoseIt, and a little weight lifting (squats mostly) helped me lose another 30 pounds in three months. After that I hit a bit of a plateau. I searched everywhere to figure out how to get over it and pretty much found that there is no fool proof way to get past one. I happened upon a post on r/keto at this point and decided to loosely try some of the users suggestions out. What worked for me was skipping breakfast and waiting until after 1 pm to eat lunch, having only water until then. Some people don't think this works for weight loss, but I'm telling you for me it got me out of the slump. I've been using it since May (not religiously but pretty consistently) and I've been able to lose around 1-2 pounds each week. However, you still have to keep in mind those calories. One thing that also worked for me was lowering the amount I could have per day once the weight started to come off more slowly. (I wouldn't suggest going below 1500 though.)

**Things I've learned**

* If you are at all considering losing weight, but haven't found the right motivation yet, I just want to tell you that you have to do it for yourself. I thought at some points I was doing it for the girls I wanted to be with or for the looks I wanted to get, but I've realized that I actually wanted to do it to know the feeling of self peace. I can finally look at myself and not get pissed off at the fact that I hate the person looking back. 

* This brings me to my next thought, if you have a friend who is depressed, stick with them. It may be REALLY hard and stressful at points, trust me, I've been there, but even in a depressed state, they are still glad as hell to have you, even if they don't say it. Without the love and support of my few close friends, I may not even be here to write this.

* Lastly I want to say that no matter how heavy you are, you are fucking awesome. Don't let people put their own twisted, shitty view of social norms on you. They simply exist to counteract the awesome in you. Don't give them the pleasure of destroying the person underneath. There are people out there that could give a flying fuck about how heavy you are, myself being one. I understand that being overweight isn't healthy, but you have to make sure your mind is heathy before you can begin to work on the rest of your health.

For those of you who read this, thank you. I know it was long and I apologize.

I'm here to share my weight loss journey so far! I'm surprised I have the courage to do this. :D

**Background:**
I've been overweight for most of my life. I remember looking at baby pictures from when I was little and getting extrememly mad at my mom for allowing her 6 year old to be overweight. I was never considered ""skinny"" during my whole entire life. Even though I was overweight I was always an athlete, a good one at that, regardless of my weight. (Obviously I could have performed better if I was in better shape). Anyway, my diet had always been poor due to the fact I was raised by my Italian grandma (mom worked a lot) who loved to feed her grandchildren :P SO MUCH PASTA NOM NOM NOM. So that's where my poor diet began as a kid and continued on until I decided I needed to get healthy. 

**What caused me to change my lifestyle?**
The constant hatred I had for myself. I couldn't look into mirrors without feeling disgusted by my appearance. It's honestly a shame that a 12 year old began to have body image problems. I had little to no confidence. 

So here are some **before pictures:**

**200 Pounds:** 5'4

http://imgur.com/O6ISh

**Diet:**
In the beginning (around June) I started slow. I slowly cut out junk food and processed food. I began to eat whole grains and lots of fruits and vegetables. The only problem was that I was still eating too much of all of this so a few months later (about December) is when I began to cut down portion size and count calories. My diet as of today consists of lots of vegetables, fruit (not as much as the vegetables), lean meat, healthy fats, lots of fish, and some grains. I follow a more paleo type lifestyle so I typically don't eat many carbs, unless I feel like my body needs more carbs. 


**Exercise:**
As I said in the beginning I was an athlete so I started out at a higher fitness level than most overweight people. I began to run 20 minutes everyday for most of summer. I realized that was not going to cut it so I got a gym membership in November and that's when I really began to see results. A typical workout for me today includes a 45 minute run 5x a week and strength training about 3-4x a week. 

If you have any more in-depth questions to ask about my diet/exercise/anything, go right ahead! :)

I'm strength training now to gain more muscle and get a more ""toned"" appearance.

**LADIES DO NOT BE AFRAID OF STRENGTH TRAINING. IT HAS DONE WONDERS SO FAR.**

I thought i'd jump on the bandwagon and post a few pictures of my journey.

**Edit:** I wasn't expecting such a reaction, especially as I had only made this post on a whim. 
A lot of people are asking me about my height and what I had changed to achieve the weight loss. 

First of all, I am 6'4. Quite tall, but that comes with a whole bunch of back problems that I wont divulge into right now haha. 

Secondly and most importantly, I changed my diet. It's as simple as that. I used to binge on a lot of greasy take out food and I never got the right nutrition's that I needed. I cut all of that out. I stopped drinking soft drink.   

My daily meals now consist of  


Breakfast: Muesli and yoghurt  
Lunch: Chicken wrap  
Dinner: Chicken or fish with some greens.   

Don't over eat! If you're hungry in between meals, eat an apple, orange, banana etc. 

When I first started exercising, I would go for walks. I would finds hills to walk up and keep a steady pace. 
Just make sure you keep your heart rate up and break a sweat. 
Nowadays I am into my weight training and am working towards toning my body up and building muscle, Which i go to the gym for..

Hopefully i've offered some insight.. It takes time and dedication.. Just don't give up. The results are definitely worth it.

I had always been the ""fat guy"" through high school. Never really fit in or was given the time of day by anyone, and it really screwed up my self esteem. So one day, a switch flipped. I didn't really ""diet"". I feel like what I did was an oversimplified method, but hey, it worked like a charm. I just ate normal and stuck with a 10 minute daily calisthenics routine. Slowly but surely, I got healthier and healthier.  Even though I'm proud of how much I've changed, I still feel and act like that same fat kid. Being non-religious in the South cuts down the number of potential interested women as it is, being scared to approach women at all just puts the nail in the coffin for me.  :(

[This was my original loseit submission.](http://a7.sphotos.ak.fbcdn.net/hphotos-ak-ash4/379528_10150659514134852_514479851_12155377_2014136793_n.jpg). I was at 275 at that point and happy with my progress but not the end result. So I kept going with it, with a goal of 200 that I revised to 190.

Here's [an overall timeline, going from 320 to 196](http://i.imgur.com/2UKDP.jpg). So not quite all of it. 

Here's two final pics to finish it, both at the 190 mark (which I hit late last week). One [on the ice after the Norfolk Admirals won the Calder Cup](http://a6.sphotos.ak.fbcdn.net/hphotos-ak-snc7/s720x720/318054_10151196370119852_890189735_n.jpg) (I cover the team they beat), and [one random one from today](http://i.imgur.com/XfROO.jpg).

As for how I got to this point - 1200-1500 calories a day, low carb (nothing against carbs, I just found it easier to keep calories low without them). I also have the beauty of having a nearby tennis court with a hockey net, so I tend to shoot around some hockey balls or kick around a soccer ball for half an hour every day. Getting into the habit of hopping on my bike for 15-20km almost daily too.

Going to start hitting the gym next. Since I did this so rapidly (started in late October), loose skin and such is definitely a problem. 

Anyway, I gotta thank all of you for the inspiration. Keeping up to date with loseit was the bulk of the reason I managed to keep going with everything. And probably the biggest reason why I pulled it off without a single cheat day! I'm forever grateful.

So I've been at it since February 2013, but sort of half assed it until March. I'm not counting calories exactly but just limiting my portions and being aware of how often I eat. Less alcohol and less eating out has surely helped. I do go to the gym at least 3-5 times a week and do 45 minutes of fast-paced walking at a 15 incline and some light weight lifting. I sort of hate the gym still but I'm excellent and shaming myself into it. I don't have a goal weight set in stone, but I think I'd be happy around 140. I've never been below 155 that I can remember so anything less than that would be pretty awesome. I know it's not a huge difference but my clothes feel looser and it feels nice.

I'm also a huge MMA fan, and was always really fascinated by the athlete's training/weight cutting methods. In the near future I plan on taking MMA classes as well, not to begin fighting or anything, but just to get into the best shape possible.

**Exercise:** The first 3 months or so I would go on a 5km walk every day, then when summer rolled around I started going on 12-30km bike rides every day, then in September I joined a gym and started going 6 days a week, combination of cardio and starting strength sets. Now I'm swimming A LOT, 6 days a week I do 35-40 25 meter lanes. Alternate between swimming and the gym still.

**Diet:**  Low carb paleo diet and try to not go over 1800 calories a day. I mostly just eat ""smart"" now, avoiding really unhealthy stuff, although I have a cheat meal every so often so I don't lose my mind.

(lost -255) I am going in for a check up tomorrow and to see about scheduling skin reduction surgeries. I updated my flair and noticed there is nothing after -250. We need some more! Up to -300 I would say.

Anywho, just wanted to bring that to everyone attention, and i guess maybe brag a bit. I have not been this ""small"" in over 16 years. So long, I do not even remember what it feels like. It is all ""new"" to me. 

Thanks for listening to me ramble. It has not been easy and people who say the surgery is an opt-out it is not, sometimes it is all you have left to get your brain and body jump-started to be healthy. It is not easy, especially if you are bi-polar T2 and some other mental illnesses. Everyday is a challenge, but I WILL get down to 250. Then set a new goal. 

EDIT: The surgery was Gastric Bypass surgery. I had to lose 50 on my own before they would operate and even then at the size i was they were worried. I had an amazing surgeon named Dr. Whoglemouth (sp) and he works out of Sentera Heart Hospital in Norfolk, VA where he does an avg. of 3 surgeries a day. It was laparoscopic meaning they went in with robotic arms to do the procedure. It takes about 3 hours or less depending on your weight. There is not much pain at all, and what pain you experience if you opt to have the surgery is the aire they pump in to your stomach to give them room to operate. That air, even though they suck it out, does not all escape. If you have back pain before the surgery you will wake up in pain, but they will give you liquid painkillers and a button to ease it. Any pain i had was gone in hours. I stayed 3 days in the hospital. I was up and doing laps the same day they operated.

If anyone has any more questions i will edit this part again. This first edit was at an opts request. I think this meets the criteria now.

I too have recently completed an endeavor. I used to be 300 pounds, I never hated it, I loved myself regardless. I was a huge hockey fan so I decided to start playing hockey, once i saw how out of shape I was I started working out to get better at hockey. Things kind of snowballed and I Started working out regularly. I loved feeling the way I did and it was improving my game. I fell off my diet and working out for months at a time which is why it took me so long to lose the weight I did. But i was not in a rush. I was always completely content with myself. I always had a girlfriend, confidence, great family, what more could you ask for. Well I've gone from a XXL shirt to a M and a 46-48 Waist to a 36. I was 225 2 months ago and was going through a bad breakup. I decided to do the Insanity workout. I followed it to a T. I did exactly as it said for 60 days besides eating it's EXACT meals. I ate extremely healthy and lean and worked out everyday. Nothing was more important to me than my workout. I lost 30 pounds because of my dedication alone and shaped my body tremendously. 

I'm still going to workout a few times a week and continue to play on a few hockey teams but for now i'm content. 

For anyone looking for inspiration. Stop reading this. Get up. and just do it. Go for it. Dedicate yourself, say no to tempting bad foods and continue to workout everyday. it's hard but its THAT easy.

I was 325lbs/148kg in the first pic (down from 366lbs/166kg) and now I'm 128kg. My neck shrunk, I have no fat roll behind my head, my face is less round, my gut is smaller, and hopefully the fat in my organs (especially in my pancreas... causing diabetes) is going down.

**Victories**

* 84lbs/37kg total lost

* I reversed my fatty liver disease. Now cured.

* Asthma is much better.

* I can jog on a treadmill for a few minutes at a time. I feel like Chuck Norris!

* A few people have mentioned I've lost weight. It's starting to show.

* I fit into my old (volunteer) coast guard uniform today which used to be very tight, and now it is loose! Awesome!


I'll try to find the pic of me at my heaviest and make a comparison GIF to show the true difference.

Thanks for all the inspiration. Time for this lurker to give some back, even if it is only minor.

Edited for formatting and a typo.

**EDIT**
Wow, thanks so much for all the amazing responses! A few people have asked for details, so here they are:

Height: 6'1""/185cm.
Starting weight: 366lbs/166.6kg (BMI: 48)
Current weight: 281.6lbs/128kg (BMI: 37) - lost about 80lbs/37kg
Goal weight: 187lbs/85kg (BMI: 25) - still need to lose about 100lbs/43kg

**Motivation:**

* Reverse my type 2 diabetes

* Be fit and able. It might sound funny, but this is what will make me feel more masculine.

* Look good, be able to dress nicely

* Find Miss Right and make her Mrs Right

* Be healthy enough to start and raise a healthy family (after the previous step).


**Method:**

* If I fall off the ""wagon"", I get back on.

* Ketogenic diet - meal replacement shakes 3x per day, vegetables and a small amount of lean meat for dinner. Snack: sugar-free Jello/Jelly. Drink: water, sugar-free soda/soft drink (not too much). Occasional coffee, no sugar. Want to start drinking tea (hibiscus, etc.) I'm currently on an experimental diet (the 600 calorie one in the Diabetalogica scientific journal) for another 6 weeks. 

* Exercise: not doing much currently because of the very low calorie diet. Otherwise, riding my mountain bike with my brother, and walking the dog. Cancelled the gym membership because it was too far to drive and exercising outdoors is much more pleasant. Also doing the 100 push up programs online.

* Support: an awesome doctor. I'm in the driver's seat - he just helps steer sometimes, and helps keep me going.

* Motivation: use music, videos and images to remind me daily of what I want. If I'm hungry and not due to eat, I almost chant inside my mind: ""I'm burning away my diabetes"" and I associate the hunger pain with good things.

* Focus on moving forward, not on deadlines. If I follow the plan (eat right, do some exercise), I'll get there. When doesn't matter.

**Future plans**

* Finish my 600 calorie/day diet in 6 weeks, get re-checked for diabetes. Hopefully I've killed it.

* Finish 100 push ups program

* Re-enrol in Krav Maga class I couldn't complete because I was too unfit.

* Move to a rural area. Build a vegetable garden. Eat WAY more vegetables. Make them a way of life so I never get this way again

* Have a family. I will not let myself get this way again if others depend on me.

* Limit ""cheat"" food to lunch and dinner on Sundays with family and friends.


My best secret at the moment is that little chant inside my mind to accept the hunger pains as a good thing: ""I'm burning away my diabetes"". I imagine the fat inside my pancreas and other parts of my body melting away. What was a bad pain before is now a good pain.

**Thanks so much for all the love!** Seriously, I'm as stoic as they come. I don't even cry at funerals, but I almost cried reading the nice comments you all gave.

 I got here by deciding to make a major change a little over a year ago. I was around 190 lbs, which was not my top weight, and decided I was done feeling like shit. I've been overweight my entire life and just couldn't stand it anymore. I started weight watchers and C25K, had a physical job and the pounds just finally came off. I've kept it off for a year and I want to lose another 30 lbs by the end of this year. 

I've been on loseit for a long time, but never made a photo comparison post before. I thought it would be a great way to motivate myself to start working on those next 30lbs. I've come this far, why not reach my goal right?

[Here](http://i.imgur.com/D2qRp.jpg) is my most recent before and after.

Quick backstory:
I had gastric bypass 5/16/11. Prior to surgery I had to lose 50lbs in order to have a healthy and safe surgery bringing my surgery weight to about 296-ish. It fluctuated between 292-298 the week before while on the liquid diet.

My surgery was a complete lifestyle change and I am forever grateful for it. I am 9lbs from my surgeons goal and about 13lbs from my goal of 146lbs, which will put my total weight loss at 200lbs. I plan on going in for plastic surgery to have the extra skin removed which according to my doc is estimated at around 20-30lbs of skin (full body).

I run 20-25miles a week now and I'm at the gym 3-4 days a week strength training. My future goals include a HM, marathon, warrior dash and becoming a bariatric nutritionist to aid in the success of other WLS patients.


**TL;DR**- Had gastric bypass. dropped a total of 187lbs. Pictures. ",,False,,t5_2rz8w,False,,150lbs,True,t3_v9ywn,http://www.reddit.com/r/loseit/comments/v9ywn/svnsv_i_cried24f/,

I didn't hate exercise, I loved lifting weights and playing sports.  By the time I graduated high school I had accept that is who I was and kept getting bigger.  I have no idea what my weight was most of the time.  In high school when I would go get a physical I wouldn't look at the scale.  After that I didn't go to the doctor.  

In 2008, my sister and brother in law went to his high school reunion.  I knew mine was coming up and no chance I was going.  Very early in 2008, I was feeling miserable, physically and mentally.  I knew it was never going to get any better.  Then all of a sudden, I feel off.  Something was wrong and it got bad enough that I finally went to the doctor.  

I was worried about what was wrong with me then I realized I had to go step on the scales.  I went into a full blown panic, forgetting why I was even there.  I wasn't going to look at the scales and I didn't.  For some reason the nurse said my weight, I've never heard a nurse do that.  

Right then it was like switch inside my head was flipped, I didn't get mad like I would have.  I just said, ""I'm going to do something about this.""  Turns out I was ok, just an infection, took some antibiotics and I was fine.  

The first year I had no idea what to do.  I grabbed my iPod and walked on the treadmill, the first one I did was 1 mile in 23 minutes.  I didn't have a scale, I had no idea if I was losing anything and I didn't pay attention to my clothes.  It wasn't until early 2009 when I went out with my friends and my sister snapped a picture of me and my clothes were hanging off of me that I realized that I had lost some weight.  

I started eating better that year, walking more, and started working out with some exercise programs.  I figured out yoga wasn't a bunch of BS and I actually like it a lot.  By July 4th I was down 100lbs.  

I kept working harder and and went diving in October.  I had a little bit of weight and was fighting to stay up.  I never had done that, I used to dive with 25+ extra pounds and still fight to stay down.  That November I did P90X for the first time, I dropped about 40 pounds doing that.  Did it again the following February, I was down to about 210 pounds when I started it.  

I probably hadn't been under 200lbs since elementary school I'm guessing.  I worked and worked and worked and one day I stepped on the scale and it said 198.4lbs.  I'm not an emotional person, but I lost it that day.  

I figured that summer I'd go ahead and go to my reunion.  I walked in and it was one of the greatest moments.  I saw a friend of mine, we went to school together from K-12 said, ""Hey"" to him.  He give me a look like who are you?  Then he jumped and ran across the bar when he realized who I was.  

I wish I had some secret to share that would help, I see people all the time say they want to lose weight and they don't do anything about it.  I was one of those people.  When it got stuck in my head it consumed me.  I still don't have any answers after all the reading I have done, still confused.  Stretch before you workout, don't stretch before you workout.  

What I do know though is that as someone who hated to run, can't get enough of it.  I've done several half marathons and am actually doing 4 this year already.  I get a good mix of cardio and weight lifting.  And it doesn't really hurt and if it does it hurts so good.  It's worth every second of misery and joy, just stick with it.

384lbs(that's what I know some pictures look bigger)

Now

I did get down to 184, but I've put a lot of muscle on from that time.

How did I lose the weight?
Doing all the things all of you recommend! Add vegetables, avoid simple carbs, exercise, and treat my body with respect. I am a work in progress, and will continue to be a work in progress - to stop working on myself, is when the problems really start. 

At first it was hard, I ate VOLUMES of food. So I replaced the 30 wings with a mountain of vegetables, I ate till I was miserable on Brussel Sprouts! LOL. I slowly cut the portion sizes back to normal portion sizes. I eat 5-6 times a day, and try to never go hungry. I have a hard and fast belief that I can find Meat, Fat, &amp; Simple Carbs easily -- its vegetables &amp; fruit that are harder to locate (re: restaurant menu) so I seek fruits and vegetables. I try and fill up on the good things and leave little room for the other things (which I still enjoy - I love beer, and bread, and baloney -- just way smaller portions!).

**The details or who/what/how:**
I'm a 6'3"" 36 year old male.  
Started off at 425lbs but I've been 370+ for 11 years or more prior.  
My goal is currently weight goal is 210 (prior to loose skin removal.)  
  

I've been working out since the start of December 2010. Dieting since February of 2011. Exercise is done daily, without exception. I walk several miles every day on my treadmill and have started building upper body strength with free weight exercise every other day. Diet wise I limit myself to 1200(ish) calories a day. I started off using MyFitnessPal but recently fell off using it daily. I've started back up again for the final push. (losingme11 if you want to add me!) My diet is pure calorie counting. I tend to eat Subway, frozen meals or canned soup with various snack sized chips and low calorie snacks thrown in. It's certainly not something a nutritionist would suggest but it's worked well for me.

**Some NSV's I've experienced since my last update:**  

* I walked from my front door, to my parent's front door 12.5 miles away from me. Surprisingly I kept a 3.5mph pace nearly the entire way. More surprisingly I wasn't tired when I got there. Such a thing was previously unimaginable and honestly I wasn't sure I could do it even as I did it.  
* I'm down from a 5XL shirt to wearing a Large. I'm not sure I'll ever fit into a medium but I certainly don't mind.   
* My stretch waisted size 54 pants have been replaced by size 36 pants.  
* Restaurant booths and wicker chairs still concern me momentarily but my brain is finally starting to reprogram itself.

So I'm nearing my end goal. Any advice from those that have lost a lot and successfully transitioned to a reasonable diet without regaining? Honestly the closer I get the more I worry that I'll just regain a huge chunk if I don't keep eating the way I am now. I'm not likely going to be anorexic or anything but having lived this diet and gained so much by losing so much..I don't want to slide even an inch backwards. Advice would be great.

**EDIT 2 **

Some information:

My names Daniel, I am 25, from Toronto. I am 5'7. My journey started at 240 pounds.

I started my weight loss journey in mid/late September after ending a toxic relationship. I cut out all unhealthy foods (sugars, processed garbage, snacks, fast food) and replaced it with healthy food. I track everything on MFP (www.myfitnesspal.com) now and in the last 6 months I have lost over 50 pounds.

I eat anywhere from 1400-1800 calories per day, comprised mainly of LEAN PROTEIN (chicken breast mainly, salmon, turkey etc), complex / slow digesting carbohydrates, and healthy fats (natural peanut butter, egg yolks, avocado).

In the first 4 months of my transition.. It was entirely done with nutrition. I completely changed my lifestyle and the weight started falling off.

In January I started working out at the gym on top (4-5 times a week).. Doing a basic split and about 20 mins of cardio per workout.

After working out and eating healthy at the gym for nearly 2 months, I was stuck at 190 pounds.

I decided to start intermittent fasting, and work out fasted as well in the mornings now, and since then I have lost about 7-8 pounds and am now at the lowest ive been in about 3 years, 182'ish.

If anyone has any questions, I am happy to answer.

Also, please see my other post for my full detailed story.

Edit: Wow, I'm overwhelmed with how much support this has gotten. Thank you so much! Especially to those of you who've said this has given you motivation.

For those who've asked how/what I've been doing, it's fairly basic. I joined MyFitnessPal and I attribute the majority of my success to it. I replaced junk and fast food with fresh veggies, fruit and lean meats. I've also limited my intake of grains and carbs. 

As far as exercise goes, I started with walking because I had never worked out in my life and it was all that I could do at 320 pounds. After losing the first 40 pounds, I started doing various forms of cardio, including the Jillian Michaels workouts. My focus now is with strength however, I'm still doing cardio to continue lowering my bodyfat.

I haven't had any loose skin thus far but considering that I still have a really long way until my goal, I know that it's bound to happen. If it does, I'll gladly take that over being 300+ pounds again.

Exactly 1 year ago i made a decision to lose weight. 

I'd been in denial about my size, and had developed a crippling social phobia which saw me miss my own mums wedding, my uncle's wedding, and my friend's funeral. I was bad, my body was bad...times were bad.

[Here's me at my heaviest](http://imgur.com/HMPZb) For obvious reasons, i don't have many pics of me from last year.

Anyway, i saw the 'Ben Does Life' video and felt inspired. I resolved to sort my shit out, and set about it. I joined the uni gym, took advice from a friend who runs a sports nutrition company, and got to it.

I ate properly, and supplemented where i needed to. I used the elliptical, the bike, and ran. I did all of these things to the point of failure, and came back the next day to better the results.

Unfortunately, i fell in April whilst out running and shattered my clavicle, so that hindered my training for a good while, but once i was OK'd by the doc, i got back out running and shifted a bit more.

[Ambulance](http://imgur.com/RDpQZ) - [The result :(](http://imgur.com/cF2Hs)

For a long while, i ate right, and drank properly, and watched the weight come off. Things were great. When my body weight decreased, so did the rapid loss. I would check myself every day, and would be constantly demotivated by my weight remaing the same for days at a time. I began to eat less and less, and my calorie intake got to something akin to 600 calories per day. I was starving. I would eventually binge, and then i'd see +1lb on the scale and i would be in bits, and begin to eat less again.

Someone on LoseIt had faced a similar problem and recommended MyFitnessPal. I stuck it on my phone, told it what i wanted to lose, and started eating 1700 calories a day and stopped weighing myself. Sure enough, one month later i'd lost 10lbs.

It's scary, but i was extremely close to an eating disorder. I would just ask you all to be mindful of daily weigh-ins, and to remain positive if there is little to no loss for days at a time. Plateaus do occur.

[Well, here i am today, taken about 30 minutes ago after a 4.6m run.](http://imgur.com/tQ6NU)

My next goal is 13st, and i'll take it from there. Overall though, i'm happy with the results, and apart from the muffin top, i'm pleased with my new appearance. 

&gt; Can't believe i forgot to add stats:
* Starting weight: 23st 3lb / 323lb
* Waist: 44""

I'm down 61.2 pounds since about August of 2012. I've been having a hard time seeing it so I decided to take some progress pics and put them side by side. I'd say it shows.

I've posted a couple times on here but I'll go over what I do anyways because someone new might be lurking (I see you). I was going to the gym 4-6 times a week for 6 months or so, but that tapered down to walking a few times a week around town. I recently started a job that is graveyard so my exercise is lacking, my food intake is lacking. I don't count calories, I just make more healthy choices like no caffeine, fast food only 3 times a week instead of every meal every day, fruits and veggies don't in fact cause a bad reaction, but a good one.

I still have 26 pounds to lose before I reach the ""normal"" BMI category.  I am calling 140 lbs my 'high maintenance' weight.  I am not sure how low I want to go weight-wise.  I do know that I would like to get down to a size 6 (currently a size 10, down from a 26/28W), although I am pretty muscular so that may not be possible.



Here are a plethora of  pics:

From starving ourselves to killing ourselves at the gym, nothing helped us achieve LONG term success. We were feeling hopeless and out of control in regards to our health and weight.  
 
After seeing a friend's success on Facebook with Take Shape for Life, my wife skeptically gave it a try. I joined the program a week later.

The weight loss portion of the plan worked well for us. But it's a diet. And diets never worked long term for us. What was different about this plan was we got a free health coach who supported us with a phone call each week. Our coach led us through a book and workbook (called the Habits of Health) that really helped us identify the habits in our life that were leading to disease and obesity.
 
It took about 4.5 months for me to lose 50 pounds and 7 months for my wife to lose 100 pounds. (Results will vary. Typical weight loss is 2-5 lbs for the first two weeks and 1-2 lbs per week thereafter.) http://imgur.com/rhmQmgm

We have been maintaining a healthy weight for almost 2 years now. We knew if we wanted a change in our lives we needed to CHANGE our lifestyle. The plan taught us exactly how to have good nutrition, incorporate exercise, learning to get enough sleep and reducing our stress. There is no magic formula. It's all common sense.
 
Every day we wake up feeling truly blessed and grateful for finally being in this place of fitness and health. We have now become health coaches and it’s our desire to help others move from a place of feeling hopeless and helpless, to a place of optimal health.

Wow, wasn't expecting all of this. Thank you all so much! I've been getting a lot of ""how""s in the comments, so I thought I'd share. But beware, it's extremely simple. 

Basically during my high school career I was heavily involved in Cinematic activities (I went to an art school), so I was always on my feet during the day, so in a way I viewed this as my exercise/ the reason I didn't snack all day. Anyway, before I'd go to school I would eat Muesli, which is just rolled oats, dried fruit, nuts, and some yogurt mixed together. I would have about a cup and a half of this for breakfast. Not sure how many calories but probably a decent amount considering the ingredients in it, but nonetheless healthy and didn't get you hungry for a while. For lunch, I would eat my biggest meal. It would be anything (healthy) I wanted, and I would STOP when I got full, which was a hard thing for me to do at the time. Eating your biggest meal at lunch is a lot healthier for you digestive track. Then, I would either have an egg or an apple or both at precisely 4 in the afternoon, and I would stop eating after that. To be honest I didn't do much exercise, other than riding my bike around leisurely around my neighborhood for maybe 30 minutes. The hardest thing was not snacking at night. I've always been one to come home and pop in a movie and start the snacking craze. It was very hard to adjust, but I pushed through it and so can you!

I started dieting on October 1st, 2010. My method? I used the eat less/move more method. Lots of Weight Watcher frozen meals. I was WAY into exercise videos. Yes, I enjoyed Richard Simmons. My absolute favorite workout was the New York City Ballet workout. This led to me getting back into theatre. Right now I'm in a local production of RENT which keeps me dancing 4 nights a week.

I'd love input from people who plateaued during major weight loss for long periods of time. I'm proud of where I've gotten but I'm still a LONG ways from where I want to be. I've tried eating more/less and I just can't seem to get the scale to move at all anymore. This is nice in that I am not gaining but...you know.

I have been waiting to actually finish something that feels like a real accomplishment.  Well, with my weigh-in today, I am no longer considered obese.

The stats: I am 6'4'', 22 years old, and started at 285 lbs about six months ago.  As of today, I am 245 lbs.  Basically it is a half way point to the top end of my healthy weight range at 205 lbs.

The how: Six days a week I keep myself to a fairly strict calorie restriction.  However, it's also about what kind of fuel I have been giving my body.  Far more protein and healthy fats in my diet, as well as careful consideration for vitamins, minerals, and fiber.  Also, tons of water.  One day a week I eat the foods I crave the most in a ""cheat day"" format.  Otherwise I would have gone utterly insane without pizza or a waffle now and again.  

In addition, I have been working out at least 3 days a week.  It started with WiiFit, which simply got me moving.  I then added swimming to the mix when my schedule permitted (grad school = almost no time).  Nowadays I am using Jillian Michael's training videos.  Yep, I'll admit it... she scares me.  But they are great workouts and I am trying to build up to the point of an even tougher workout like P90X or Insanity.

The why:  I started this diet because I saw myself approaching a place I told myself I would never hit: 300 lbs.  Also, my back was killing me and I was tired all the time.  I was being lazy and dangerous in regards to my health.  I decided I wanted to live past 50 and not be fat my whole life.  The ultimate kicker was when I started having difficulties fitting in seats at a movie theatre.  How embarrassing!  So I decided to make the change.  With the support of a beautiful girlfriend, I am finally making strides toward a healthier life.

But you probably just came for the pics!  Well, I honestly don't have great ones for showing off the weight loss.  Too freaking cold around here these days and I'm not the type of person who carries a camera around all the time.  I am, of course, the awkwardly tall dude.

*""I began dieting and exercising last week and started couch-to-5k for the first time ever but I gained weight this week! What am I doing wrong?""*

Usually the community answers focus on their caloric intake, which is understandable as many people get this wrong on their first go. But there's also something else at play here.

When most people decide to lose, they often start their diet (which promotes weight loss) and their exercise routine (which doesn't at first...more on this in a moment) at the same time. What most people don't realize is that starting up a new exercise program can often result in temporary weight gain.

Here are the two reasons why:

**Reason One:**
 
Somebody taking up a new strength-training program usually experiences a phenomenon called DOMS - Delayed Onset Muscle Soreness. This soreness is caused by a variety of factors but primarily is the result of microscopic tears in your muscle tissue caused by your work-out. These tears attract inflammation to the area to help protect and heal the muscle fibers. This process requires extra water. So your body will retain water as necessary until the muscles are repaired. This can result in a 3-4 lb weight gain, which can be discouraging to people just starting out.

**Reason Two:**

As somebody starts an aerobic exercise program, like Couch-to-5k, their muscles get better and better at storing glycogen. Glycogen is muscle fuel, and more exercise means they need more of it.

For each gram of additional glycogen stored in the muscles, your body needs 3 grams of water to store it in. So when your muscles initially adapt to your new routine, your glycogen stores increase, and thus your water retention.

What's great about this is the more glycogen you store, the less likely you are to make fat. 

What's not awesome about this is that you're almost guaranteed to see the number on the scale go up when you start a new workout routine due to the water retention caused by DOMS and glycogen storage.

**The Takeaway:**

* If you start a diet and workout regime at the same time, realize that the water retention from your workout could be cancelling out the weight loss and water loss occurring because of your diet. The scale might not go down as quickly as you hoped. 
* This doesn't mean dramatic transformations aren't happening under your skin. This is one of the reasons it's great to track measurements in addition to weight.
* This water retention phenomenon usually lasts 2-3 weeks while your muscles get accustomed to the new routine.
* If psychologically, you feel like you need to see the number on the scale go down to get some momentum, start with just diet, and add in exercise later. Or add in your exercise program *extremely gently* to minimize the impact to your muscles.
* Eating low-carb/keto is one way to 'cheat' this initial gain because low-carb forces your body to flush water from other systems which balances out your muscular water retention. But the phenomenon is still happening under the covers.

1329121986.0,737,self.loseit,pn9fu,Last year I weighed 300lbs.  ,942,205,266,http://www.reddit.com/r/loseit/comments/pn9fu/last_year_i_weighed_300lbs/,"I'm a brand new Redditor, but wanted to stop by here, say ""Hi"" and tell a little bit of my story.

I have never been a fit person before. I have never been on a sports team, have rarely done anything overtly physical and have been overweight for most of my adult life. At age 28, I was well over 300lbs and living a very sedentary lifestyle.

In October of 2010, I went camping with my father near Crater Lake, Oregon. We decided to hike the trail to the highest point in the park, Mt. Scott. The trail is 5.2 miles long, with an elevation reaching 8,926 feet. My sixty five year old father beat me to the summit that day, and something inside me began to simmer. 

Over the next several months, I began to audit my physical self. I had never really made a connection between what I ate and how I felt. I had never believed that I had the power to control my weight.

Around the beginning of 2011, I began to manage what I ate. I was still living a sedentary life, but over the course of a few months moved my diet from standard American fat to a nearly vegan plan.

By mid summer I had shed about 100lbs. I started hitting up the elliptical machine at a gym, and then transitioned to road running. I was still fairly undeveloped muscularly. I had never trained with weights, and lost a large amount of my muscle mass during my rapid weight loss.

I am now lifting weights three times a week.  I do Yoga twice weekly, and do a spin class on Thursdays.  I run a minimum of 150 miles a month, with my long runs well over 20 miles.  My current best time for a marathon distance is 3:15:00.

Here is a quick link to a before and after.  About thirteen months have passed since the before picture.

Thanks for reading and have a great week!

EDIT: A lot of people have asked what I did with loose abdominal skin.  Excess skin is a pain in the ass.  The simple truth is that a large part of it is genetics.  That aside, you can REALLY help your problem by dropping your body fat percentage down to the single digits (as a guy) and bulking up your core.  Doing a lot of crunches and sittups is great, but doing a smaller amount of them with a heavy weight is what is going to make your abdominal muscles grow larger and replace the volume that your fat used to take up.

Your wonderful support has encouraged me to post an underwear shot that is a bit higher quality than the other pictures :)

I myself am maybe in the 10-15% body fat range, but started out somewhere in the low 20's. Today, in between my sets when your mind kind of spaces out for a minute, I started to subconsciously watch this very large gentleman do weighted lunges and push it really, really hard. I was drawn to how hard he was working, and how absolutely determined he was to get through whatever regiment he was doing, and I realized, I really, really admired him.

You heard me right, I had so much respect for this man, who's attire and technique made it pretty obvious this was his first or second time in the gym, and I'll tell you why. There was a point in this man's recent past where he looked at his current lifestyle, realized it was unhealthy and thought, ""fuck this, I'm going to change this."" Meanwhile, I'm here bitching and moaning about how difficult it is to get into the single digits of body fat. Also, while I feel like shit when I gain an unwanted pound or two, this man decides not to just say, ""fuck it, it's too late"" and instead, skydive out of his comfort zone for the sake of his health. 

Anyway, he noticed me watching him and I could see the self consciousness envelope his facial expression. He put down his weights, and in a really weak voice exclaims, ""what??"". My heart dropped as I was caught by surprise, and I absolutely do not want to be the reason for why he gives up on this incredible long but rewarding endeavor. So I pick myself up, and said in the straightest face I think I've ever made in my life, ""that was a kickass set. Keep it up, man."" He looked a little embarrassed, but as I was leaving, I did notice him do his next set with a little more confidence.

Anyway, I just want you guys to know that at the gym, if anyone is watching you, chances are they aren't judging you. I'm hoping /r/loseit will back me up when I say they are more likely to be genuinely interested or even admiring you in a completely non-condescending way. SO DON'T BE AFRAID OF THE GYM!

A lot has happened since then.

First off, I said I was 350, and I later found out that I was 420. I went to the chiropractor and got myself weighed there, and the scale said 420. I think that is the reason I'm still at it. Because I realized then that something was wrong.

After I went to the Chiropractor, my Mom bought me a Kinect (Literally the same day), and I've only started using it recently (almost 2 weeks ago).

I went to the store and rented Dance Central 2. Never in my life have I had so much fun working out. After I rented it, I brought it back, then went to the store and bought it.

I also emailed Harmonix and told them about my weight loss and how I plan to use their game for exercise, and they sent me a bunch of free stuff! They gave me a bunch of codes for DLC, and a code for a downloadable copy of Dance Central 2, and they're currently in the process of mailing me a package in the mail with Dance Central 1 included. Seriously guys, Harmonix is now one of my favorite gaming companies.

Anyways, I've had lots of fun playing Dance Central and I still play it today. I usually set up about 20 minutes worth of songs in a playlist, and just go for it. Then my heart rate stays up and I sweat more.

Since playing that, I've noticed that I'm getting more physically fit. Obviously I'm not superman, but I am noticing a difference.



I also made and account on MyFitnessPal, and I've been getting a lot of support on there as well! A lot of you guys are over there, and are being very supportive. You can add me by clicking [here](http://www.myfitnesspal.com/tlasan)

I also started a YouTube channel, and if any of you could help me out by giving me support over there, I'd like that very much!

It's also a great way to communicate and show my progress to other people like me, once you get past the trolls that is ;D

My new YouTube account can be found [here](http://www.youtube.com/user/DeflatingWhale)

Any support on there is GREATLY appreciated!

Anyways, now onto my measurements and weight! (almost forgot lol)


So I started off like so:

Weight: 420

Chest: 62""

Waist: 66""

Upper Arm: 19.5""

Thigh: 33.5""

Calf: 22""

Neck: 19""


and I am currently at this:

Weight: 402

Chest: 61""

Waist: 63""

Upper Arm: 19""

Thigh: 31""

Calf: 21.75""

Neck:18.5""

I took some before and after shots for you guys, and now that it's been a month, I want to show them. I can't really see any difference, but really I find that the biggest difference I'm noticing is my stomach becoming more flabby rather than hard (not that is was that hard before).

I'm here now to encourage you to get off the cardio bandwagon (especially you ladies) and really incorporate strength training and compound lifts into your routine. I originally ran / did cardio 5 days out of the week until I fell in love with the way my body took to strength training. I'm on my way to my very first NPC bikini competition on June 29th--something I thought I could NEVER in my lifetime do.

**How I Did It:**
If you'd like something a bit more detailed, then e-mail me at ilyssagetsfit@gmail.com. You can follow my progress on instagram @ohilyssa. I'm on MyFitnessPal as ""FanofPawl"". Or, you can [follow my blog here](http://ilyssagetsfit.blogspot.com/).

Basically: I ate 1450 calories a day for 110 days. 140 g of which were protein. I never once cheated, gave up, or slacked. Most of what I ate consisted of eggs, yogurt, ground turkey, chicken, quinoa, sweet potatoes, whey protein powder, milk, protein bars, apples, pears, grapes, ground beef, lean cuisines, broccoli, asparagus, and carrots.

I worked out 6 days a week. For the first two months it was purely cardio. After Thanksgiving (Day 62) I started compound lifting with only 1-2 days of cardio. I absolutely love powerlifting. I can explain this more in depth if there is interest, but in terms of gains...I've seen a lot of them. Deadlift has gone from 65lbs--&gt;205lbs, for example. 


Once I stopped cutting on January 10th of this year, and started bulking (eating 2400 cal on lifting days, 2100 on non-lifting) I saw the majority of my strength increases.

I pay for my plan from my coach and trainer, so I cannot share these things in specifics. However, I am on a plan similar to 5/3/1. I lift heavy in a particular compound lift, and then follow that up with accessory work. 

In short: I eat clean, and I lift heavy. Even though I'm 6 weeks into bulking, I try to eat as clean as possible (lots of chicken, brown rice, brussel sprouts, oats, and peanutbutter :P) I'm less than 17 weeks out from the San Jose Fit Expo, and so I begin my competition prep really soon.

Some detail to appease the moderation: M/22/5'11''. Starting weight was 285 in May of 2012. I achieved my weight loss primarily dieting but also exercise. I started out with very strict calorie counting and abandoned all fast food and soda. I still do not eat fast food but do enjoy soda from time to time. I do not count calories anymore as I have found I can subconsciously control portions. Biggest advice for anyone trying to lose weight is to realize that the only person responsible for your weight and appearance is yourself. Some people don't like the blatant truth, but the fact of the matter is no one is forcing that extra slice of pizza into your mouth. I came to terms with this and constantly reminding my self of where I used to be and how I got there keeps me on the straight and narrow. 

Edit: Holy crap this took off more than I could have imagined. Thank you all so much for the incredible compliments. As a guy who has been big his whole life I can't express what it means to see such kind words. Again I owe a lot to this community, seeing others success assured me that I too could reach my goals. I hope for those of you just beginning and waging on that my small success can come as a small token of support and encouragement. I wish you all the best of luck and thank you again!

I believe that if there's something in this world that you find worth fighting for, in your heart and in your mind, you will find a way to make it a reality. This video embodies nearly 3 years of hard work and dedication: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZrasQOojFyo

Through my entire journey from 340 to 161 pounds, I've been all natural. I am against using any kind of diet pills, and the like, that ""aid"" in weight loss. There were a couple of main methods I tried when losing weight. I tried a variety of diets and lifestyles in the past two years with varying success. All my methods had a few things in common. I drank lots of water; having between two to four liters each day. I also supplemented fish-oil and a multivitamin on a daily basis. The only supplements that I use on a near daily basis are organic vitamins/minerals, fish oils, and whey protein.

When I first started, I did a low-fat, high carbohydrate diet accompanied with lean meat. The diet was complimented with lots of cardio through walking and daily elliptical machine use, and over a period of 6-months, I lost 40 pounds. During this time, I was also set on limiting my caloric intake and eating six small meals. In January of 2011, my brother introduced me to the Paleo Diet. In the process, I began eating food high in saturated fat, protein, and low in carbohydrates. During those months, I began weight training for the first time. Toward the end of 2011, I reached a plateau at 210 pounds. It was one that lasted an entire year, but it didn't break me. From August 2011 to August 2012, I also gained 20 pounds. Back at 230, I was unsure if I would ever get under 200. 

From August 2012 onward, I changed my weight loss methods to pure strength training, zero cardio, and an intermittent fasting protocol that is specific to LeanGains via Martin Berkhan. All the methods I've tried have had their merits, but that one alone has helped me break past my plateau, gain strength, and lose body fat beyond I ever thought possible. Along with intermittent fasting and strength training, I'm a firm practitioner of macronutrient cycling. I cycle between high-carb/low-fat meals on my training days, and high-fat/low-carb meals on my rest days while keeping protein high at +1g/+1lb of body weight on both days.

I just want you guys here to hopefully see what I see.  So many people use ""shaming"" themselves to lose weight. It's not healthy!  I've taken this from my blog post and I wanted to share it here with you guys(I have a lot of women readers that's why I talk so much about women and daughters):


Usually I don't post on Sundays because I get the lowest amount of readers on Sundays.  But I've noticed a trend going around on Facebook, Pinterest and other social media sites and sometimes I just can't keep my mouth shut.  It's a disturbing 'shaming' trend and I want to tell my readers that this way of thinking is not an okay way to think or to go about dieting.


[This image was taken from the Reddit front page today.](http://imgur.com/McVM4v2)


I'm sure some of you have seen images like this around, especially on Pinterest but I've seen them everywhere.  This is a fantastic example of bad inspiration.  What does a picture like this evoke in you?  Lets say you're sitting at your computer right now, you haven't worked out and  you're eating.  So right now you might be feeling: Shame that you indeed are eating.  Or Worthlessness because you haven't worked out all week.  Or Failure because your diets always fail.  Maybe you feel inspired and you toss away the food and decide to head out to the gym immediately.


The disturbing this is that so many people (women especially) don't find anything wrong with this.  They say, ""hey, I have weak willpower and if this gets me going then why not? I don't take it that seriously."" I want to slam my face on my desk when I hear that.


Shaming is a big part of what keeps an eating disorder running.  If you say, ""I only look at this when I shouldn't eat junk food.""  How is that any different than having an eating disorder?  When you have an eating disorder your eating habits are defined by shame.


Would you let your daughter use this for inspiration if she was a bit chubby?  No?  Then why is it okay for you?  What kind of message are you sending to your children?  That it's okay to hate yourself, but only for a few minutes so you don't eat that brownie?


I really hope I'm getting my point across.  You do not need this for inspiration in any way shape or form.  Great inspiration comes from two sources.  1.Yourself.  When you love yourself and what you can accomplish, you can drive yourself to do anything. 2. People you can relate to.  If you find a book about a woman who battles the same battles as you, and managed to lose 40 lbs, and have a happy attitude you're going to see her as an inspiration.


It's not easy relating to the model in the picture above.  In fact a good part of her could be photoshopped.  She might not have any idea what it's like to battle binge eating disorder, or to lose 100+lbs.  In fact we have no idea who she is or what she's like.  How can she be an inspiration?  Because she's skinny? Is that all she's about?


When I have a bad day there are several things I do to remind me of where I've been and what I can accomplish.  One really great way to get inspiration is to look for people who are like you, who have the same struggles as you.  People who can cheer you on and lift you up.  When I'm feeling down I look at [Katie at Runs for cookies](http://www.runsforcookies.com).  She has lots over 100lbs, still battles with binge eating, and is a runner.  She put in the hard work and has such grace. Who better to be an inspiration?  Or how about [Holly at 300 Pounds down.](http://www.300poundsdown.com)  She has lost over 217lbs and battles with a sugar addiction.  She went from not being able to go out into public, to raising her children on her own.  Or [Anele at Success along the weigh.](http://successalongtheweigh.blogspot.ca)  I love her blog because it's so real.  Right now she's just getting over an injury and working her butt off to try to lead a healthy lifestyle.  She's crafty, and aaallll woman.  Just reading her blog you know that she has been through rough patches to get where she has.


Talk about inspiration!  These women have lived the tough life.  Most who lose weight have battled an eating disorder of one kind or another.  They work hard every damn day to lead a happy and healthy life.  Now I ask again, who do you want to be an inspiration for you and your children?

I want to add, that Reddit you guys are smart, really smart.  You don't need fluff like this for inspiration!  And of course, sorry if I offend anyone, that's obviously the last thing I want to do.

EDIT 2: I should add... In my ""blogosphere"" I interact with daily with women who most are admittedly precariously close to having an ED or have an ED. Binge eating and Compulsive eating are not uncommon.  This is who this post was originally directed at.  

EDIT3: Okay I get it. I regret posting this, please just stop inboxing me telling me how much of an idiot I am and I'm not a Psychologist.  There *is* a difference between not wanting to be you at your heaviest and perpetuating self-hatred.  I think some of you are confusing them as the same thing.  In NO WAY do I want to be 115lbs heavier.  I don't like who I was, I hated myself, ate too much and didn't care.  I told myself a lot of lies.  Nobody wants to be that way and I remind myself that I will not be that way again.  But there is a difference between that and perpetuating self-hatred.  For instance if you catch yourself eating those chips and saying to yourself, ""You're a big fat ugly idiot, no wonder you have no life, no friends.  You're ugly, that's all you'll ever be.""  To me that sounds unhealthy and completely different than not wanting to be the person you where.

Progress pics http://imgur.com/a/CmDMx 

I have been a bigger girl since I was in middle school. I was a military brat so moving about every year or two was normal. For that reason and because I've always been a shy reserved person it was hard for me to make friends. I kept to myself and books and Twix cookie bars were my only solace. 

This trend continued on until I was about 20, when I finally started to realize that I was overweight and it was making me unhappy. I wanted to date and have fun, and I hated that I was the token ""big girl"" in my group of friends. This was when I realized I wanted to change, but did I change anything? NO. I just became more miserable and more aware of how overweight I was. 

Fast forward to about 4 months ago. I was 257 lbs, and very unhappy that my size 18 jeans were getting tight and I would probably need to get size 20's soon.  For a long time I had wanted to enlist in the national guard, but at my height I would have to weigh a maximum of 177 OR be under 32% BF. The momentous amount of weight I would have to lose always made it seem so unattainable, but after a breakup I decided that enough was ENOUGH. I was tired of feeling fat, and letting my fatness keep me from doing the things I wanted.

I started out with a calorie goal of 1500 a day with and 3 times a week forced myself to the gym to do 30 minutes on the elliptical. Since then I've cut my calories to 1400 daily and upped my time at the gym from 30 min to 50 min and the weight has been steadily coming off. 

I love that I'm starting to like what I see in the mirror again, but I think my favorite part of this journey is physically feeling my body getting stronger.

For years I was 190lbs-202lbs. I could never make it budge, I could never lose it, and worst of all, I'd tell people I was an identical twin and they would not believe I was even related to my sister. There were some people who would ask me, ""What is it like being the ugly one?""

Proof:[link]http://i.imgur.com/Pm5bi.jpg[/link] I'm on the right, my twin is on the left.

Needless to say, I was anti-social and turned to anti social activities (I.e. video games, hiding in my room, refusing to hang out with friends, not living life).

One video game I was always fascinated with was Dance Dance Revolution (DDR). It is a game with four arrows on a big metal pad. You watch the screen and step on the arrow when it hits the top of the screen. It has many different settings for beginners to master experts.

To me it was a game that people did to make fools of themselves OR to look ridiculously talented at the arcade. I would have never wanted to step foot on it, but I had two friends somehow force me to get on the pad and try an easy level.

I was hooked. It was a challenge, but it was also something fun. I couldn't wait to try again. From that day on if I knew someone wanted to go to the arcade I would tag along and try out the dancing game. I soon found that there was one particular song that I wanted to master, and I worked hard at it and moved on. It was like getting rewarded for doing something fun. I never thought this device could be used as an exercise tool.

Fast forward to Christmas (three years ago) and my parents got my twin and I the DDR game for the Wii as well as a dance pad. We took turns all night playing it, and every once in a while after that I'd play around with it. I was still pretty sedentary.

It wasn't until a year ago that I heard I was going to get a chance to go visit Ireland. (This was in July 2010). So I decided right then and there I was NOT going to be the stereotypical American in Ireland. I had 10 months to get into shape (I was 202lbs and I wanted to get to at least 125) and I was going to do whatever it took to get there in a healthy way.

I started research on eating right, but I couldn't find anything that seemed easy without doing pills or something like P90x. I would have to make my own meal plans. Exercising was something I really didn't want to do, but I knew I would reach my goal faster if I did. That's when I thought about DDR. Whenever I danced I always worked up a sweat. I knew that at least a little heart pumping would do a little damage to the weight so why not?

My Wii DDR game had an exercise mode that calculated the calories you burned. For my first day I tried to burn at least 400. It was tough but I made it happen.

EVERY DAY I added 10 more calories to burn. So day 2 was 410 calories. Day 3 was 420. In all that was ONLY adding one extra song every day.

I also had to work on food intake. Embarrassingly my nutrition usually consisted of an entire box of macaroni and cheese, tv dinners constantly (sometimes 2 or three for a meal), sugar, candy, doughnuts, chocolate. I never ever felt hungry and I wasn't comfortable unless I was full. So my diet was something I would have to change.

I discovered that some vegetables have negative calories, meaning when you eat them they DO have calories, but your body works so hard to digest them that digestion burns more calories than eating them. So vegetables were going to be a number one diet thing. Forget the food pyramid!

I then looked up things for my height. I am 5'2 and my healthy body weight should be between 110lbs and 125. I then looked up calorie counters and discovered the amount of calories I should eat in a day. I was probably eating around 4000 or more a day, and I'd have to reduce that to 1500.

So I came up with this table and I stuck to it.

Month 1: 350-400 calories PER MEAL. 4 meals a day. ~1400-1600 per day.

Month 2: 340-390 calories PER MEAL. 4 meals a day. ~1360-1560 per day.

Month 3: 330-380 calories PER MEAL. 4 meals a day ~1320-1520 per day.

Month 4: 320-370 calories PER MEAL. 4 meals a day ~1280-1480 per day.

Every month I would take off 10 calories per meal. I dropped 10 pounds my first month, and second month and third month. Every month I would lose about 10 pounds. I used this system for 9 months, taking off 10 calories. I couldn't believe it was working!

I did my DDR every day and I made sure to watch what I ate. I was soon so good at knowing how many calories were in what that I could go out to eat and just KNOW how many calories were in each spoonful.

EDIT 2: I still play DDR every Friday, Saturday and Sunday for about 1.5-2 hours every 'session.' It still doesn't feel like a workout. Plus, you can constantly improve.

TL/DR: I lost 90 pounds by playing DDR everyday for 9 months.

And I was in the Army! I couldn't do them in basic training, but I got through all of them today!! 

Edit: The HOW! I was so excited that I forgot to include the full, who/what/when/where/how!!

So I had had gastric bypass in 2010 due to an injury I sustained in the Army in 2005. 
I recently joined an outdoor obstacle course fitness facility. The owner promised me that if I followed his advice and trained with him, I'd be able to run a full 5k obstacle course. I was, of course, skeptical, but I joined. 

Three weeks in I have been working my ass off like this:


Mon: CrossFit style work out (with a HIGHLY trained coach who has background in physical therapy and strength and conditioning)

Wednesday: My LEAST fave day, long run day... to be honest, I think I've skipped one or two of these.

Friday: Obstacle course day!! I LOVE this workout. Not only is it FUN, but I feel SO accomplished when I'm done. The obstacles include, A-frame, Over/under logs, 6, 8, and 15 foot walls, horizontal rope, balance beam, climbing rope, monkey bars, and a few other obstacles I can't name off the top of my head.

If you get a chance, DO THIS! Obstacle courses are a way to have fun, stay in shape, and compete! I, honestly, could not have done the walls without the AMAZING women I saw go before me!!!

My wife, who's also very heavy, started working out as well, but she didn't want to work out with me. She said it was to hard to see me make progress when she was slow to lose weight.  This saddened me greatly, but I acquiesced. 

I've noticed, though, that her face seemed to be getting thinner, but every time I brought it up she told me just to give her some time.  This continued until this weekend during my birthday party on Saturday.  She told me that she had a surprise for me. 

In front of a group of our friends she told me ""Honey I never wanted to talk about my weight with you.  I was so embarrassed that I couldn't even talk about it.  I know you were embarrassed at your own weight as well but you kept at it.  You worked out every day and always told me how much fun you were having. You didn't pry, but you always said that you hoped I was having fun working out as well.  You kept buying better and better groceries and trying out new recopies to get us to eat better while making it fun for me.  And more than anything you kept believing in and encouraging me even though I kept you at arms length on this for the past two months.  Because of that I've kept up with my own workouts and have lost 10lbs.  I've only kept up with it because of you.  So let's eat some cake and on Monday I start working out with you.""

At this point I was pretty close to bawling.  

Then she showed me the cake they made for my birthday, but to celebrate OUR lifestyle change.  (Yes I understand the irony of a cake to celebrate weight loss and a lifestyle change, but it's my 40th B-day so bugger off... :-P).

She even included the tattoo that she designed for me:  http://imgur.com/a/8RxKS#0

Update:  Working out with her today was amazeballs.  I even liked the part where she kept laughing because i was trying to use an agility ball for the first time.  Granted my making walrus noises at the same time probably didn't help... :-P

When I first started losing weight, I was thrilled to find that clothes at regular stores (instead of fat guy stores) were fitting again, and I'd go every week or two to pick out new things. But then, something bittersweet happened: those new clothes became baggy as I continued to lose weight, and had to be replaced with more new clothes. This can add up quick, and I personally just can't justify spending $25+ on a shirt I'll only get to wear for a month or two. And that's how I first found myself at Goodwill, finding mint condition buttondowns for $3 a pop. 

But there's more to it than just savings. To find shirts that fit you, you're going to wind up trying on loads of them, because different brands and styles are sized very differently. And you're going to find beautiful, mint condition, awesome looking shirts that don't fit, but would fit PERFECTLY if you'd just lose ten more pounds. And most people would simply curse the shirt and return it to the rack, **but you're going to buy that shirt**, because it's freaking $3, and it's going to hang in your closet for a month or six weeks or however long it takes, trying it on every weekend, hoping it fits, until it **DOES fit**. My closet always has three sizes hanging in it: shirts that fit, shirts that will fit, and shirts that used to fit and need to be re-donated.

Lunch: Two slices of brown bread no butter with one slice of wafer thin ham and half a tomato


Dinner: This varies alot but mostly one chicken fillet 3 boiled potatoes and some carrots/peas. Some days I would have pasta or whatever my family was having but I would always keep the portions reasonable enough. And loads of water:D

Hope this helps! Thanks""

[The pictures](http://imgur.com/a/RYyXN)

I am really nervous to post pictures. So, here I am being brave. I told myself I would update my progress on my birthday, so I did!

I have a long way to go, but one thing that has really made this all feel so much more attainable is that little steps count. I have been tracking everything on MyFitnessPal and keeping myself accountable. I haven't done anything crazy. I have been eating smaller portions and more real food. I'm making more food at home and snacking to fill hunger, not boredom. 

One thing that I realized was how mindlessly I was eating before. There would be pizza and I wouldn't be starving, but I would keep eating. Or think, ""I guess this fast food sounds alright"" and just make the easy decision. It's crazy to me now. I was putting terrible things into my body and it wasn't even because I loved it! It was because I was totally complacent. Now, I will occasionally have a treat, but it's because I really want it. I budgeted my calories this week to have birthday cake today and not feel guilty! 

Honestly, the diet is the biggest thing. Exercise is fantastic and important, but you don't have to jump in and be a pro. I started slowly with riding a stationary bike and swimming occasionally. I now swim twice a week and I dance a couple of times a week as well. These are things that I love doing and make me feel great. 

The other thing that I've learned is how to love myself in this process. I don't do this for ""future me"" and because I hate how I am anymore. I do this because I love myself and I want to treat my body better. Just because you're not to your ""after"" doesn't mean you should feel shame. This attitude has made a huge difference for me. Remember, talk to yourself like you're a friend. You wouldn't say to your friend, ""You stupid loser. Don't be such a lazy sack of crap."" You would encourage them. Thinking with that mindset really turns things around for me. Believe in yourself and you'll prove yourself right!

These are just my experiences so far. They have all come as ""ah-ha"" moments that have really shaped how I feel. I know I have a long way to go, but I'm going to keep at it because I feel so much better every step of the way. 

r/loseit is a HUGE inspiration for me. You guys are amazing people and I love seeing your stories. I hope mine will one day be helpful to someone else as well.

I just started counting calories yesterday and had a real eye-opening experience just now. Before preparing my standard breakfast (a veggie omelet, yogurt parfait, and toast), I decided to put everything into my [SparkPeople](http://www.sparkpeople.com) nutrition counter and was shocked at what I saw. I had been consuming over 1000 calories in JUST ONE MEAL! Ugh. 

But it was a beautiful thing. I was able to look at where I was spending those calories and where I could cut back. No EVOO, but olive oil spray. Saved 120 calories. A sprinkle of cheese instead of a handful. Saved 140 calories. No toast. Saved 200 calories. And it didn't stop there. It's amazing how quickly it all adds up when I genuinely thought I was doing myself a favor by eating a well-rounded meal. 

I just finished my new breakfast with reasonable portions and I'm just as satisfied, but I only ate 410 calories! 

My advice (and I know this isn't a new concept), put in what you plan on preparing into SparkPeople and see where you can modify to get the most bang for your buck. It was well worth it :-)

EDIT: 3 hours later and I'm still full! These are the positive life lessons I love to experience. I didn't restrict anything that I'm missing.

I feel like a lot of people start dieting by throwing out every starch in their house and stocking up on carrots and celery. That’s great!...if you like carrots and celery. If not, your diet will feel like a total chore all the time and you’ll probably “fall off the wagon” pretty quickly. I've never been a “garden salad, dressing on the side” type, so I thought I'd share some of my favourite low cal foods:

a.	**Pickles** – pickles have a ton of flavour and are under 5 calories each. They’re pretty salty, so if you have problems with sodium, I’d steer clear or at least keep in moderation. 

b.	**Turkey bacon** – I actually prefer the taste of turkey bacon and it’s only 70 calories for two pieces. 

c.	**Berries**– much less sugar than other fruits and they make an easy snack

d.	**Salsa**– I put it on chicken, baked potatoes, rice, anything really.

e.	**Light cream cheese**– I spread it on crackers, use it in sauces, have it with jam on crackers to make a tiny cheesecake-like dessert. It’s quite rich and creamy so a little goes a long way and I can’t really tell the difference between it and regular cream cheese. 

f.	**Pellegrino** (or any sparkling water) – I get really bored of just drinking water, but a cold Pellegrino with a twist of lime is delicious and refreshing, and makes me feel like I’m having a something fancy

g.	**Skim milk lattes** – I don’t usually have an appetite in the morning, so I’ll often have a skim latte for breakfast. Not only do I get my coffee but the protein in the milk is enough to keep me full until later in the morning. 

h.	**Balsamic vinegar**– really low in calories but flavourful. I use it to marinate chicken or pour over a caprese salad

i.	**Eggs** – I don’t even worry about removing the yolk or anything. A poached egg on a piece of whole wheat toast with a slice of turkey bacon and some raspberries leaves me full for several hours. 

j.	**Salmon**– tastes great with just a squeeze of lemon and has a ton of protein

I lost a little over 100 pounds in the first six months of losing weight.  My weight loss slowed as I put more of an emphasis on weight lifting, but my appearance improved, so I didn't care rely as much on what the scale was telling me -- I looked to my mirror instead.  It took about a 15 months to lose a total of 134 pounds.


I understand there are a many loyalists to all kinds of fads and diet/lifestyle ""programs.""  It's cool if you're into one of those, but they're just not for me. I still enjoy eating normal foods like cheeseburgers, Chinese, BBQ, Mexican, sweet tea, soda, hot wings, etc.  I don't have a list of foods I have to eat, nor do I have list of foods I can't eat.  I try to eat higher in calorie foods and drinks in moderation.  


As far as burning calories, I like to stay relatively active by hitting the gym 4-5 days week for about 45 minutes a day and being physical outside of the gym.  I like to burn calories by playing the Kinect, shooting hoops, jumping on our trampoline (I'm 27 and just bought one, don't judge).

That's it.  It's simple and sustainable, which is how I've been able to keep the weight off for a few years as of this January.  I had never lost any amount of weight prior to this 135-pound weight loss.

For the last couple of weeks, I noticed that my bras were getting enormous, and my pants were literally falling off. I ended up donating all of my clothes that didn't fit, which ended up being...ALL my clothes. The only things I kept were sleep pants, t-shirts, stretchy tank tops and yoga pants...so, basically just sleep clothes. I've been saving up a small amount of money to buy some pants, and a new bra, and finally made the plunge today.

My original bra size was a snug 38E, now I'm a 34D. 

My original pant size was a very snug 10/12 (I was in denial :P), and today I fit perfectly into a size 4! 

My weight when I first started changing my lifestyle on November 14th, 2011 was 180-ish. Now, as of this morning, I'm 132.2.

Sorry for the crappy picture. My camera phone is awful

Edit: I'm currently away from my computer and on my phone so when I get home ill answer all your questions, and post better pictures! ETA is about an hour :)

Edit 2: I didn't realize this thread was going to blow up. Thanks everyone for the wonderful comments!

How I did it:
In the beginning I decided to limit my intake to 1200, and watch my carbs and make sure I stay under 100g, with a goal of staying under 50g. I always also tried to keep my protein above 50g, and ultimately shot for 100g or above. I started in November of last year, and added in lifting weights in January, every other day.

Here's an example of what I do on my lifting days:

**Arm day:**

* Bench press
* Lat pull down
* upright barbell row
* shrugs
* curls with ez bar 
* 3 sets of 10 push ups 
* assisted pull ups
* Bent leg raises (3 sets of 20)

**Leg day:**

* Squats or Deadlifts (Alternating days)
* Leg extension machine
* Leg curls
* calf raises
* Leg press machine

**Main every day staples of my diet:**

* Eggs (with yolks)
* tuna
* bacon
* Chicken
* Turkey
* Nuts (about a handful a day as they're calorie dense)
* Veggies (Broccoli, cucumbers, Avocados, cauliflower, celery, lettuce, spinach, carrots)

I've recently added running as I did an Obstacle Race (30+ obstacles, 11 miles up the tallest mountain in Jersey..multiple times. It was awesome.) and had to train for it. I usually run 2 miles every day that I'm not lifting, and run 4-6 on a Saturday. Make sure to take one day off a week from working out. Weight lifting is my priority, so if I skip out on running, that's okay.

An example of food on a typical day:

**Breakfast:**

Skipped (I'm usually not hungry. Skipping breakfast doesn't affect your metabolism, contrary to popular belief. Don't be afraid to do this. It will not harm you.)
If I DO eat breakfast, it's either a protein shake (Optimum Nutrition has the best flavors), 2 eggs with some cheese and some bacon. 

**Lunch:**

* 1 serving of tuna with 2 tablespoons of mayo, 1 minced celery stalk, one grated carrot, 1/4 chopped onion, salt, and pepper to taste. (Pro tip: Before you add the mayo, add in everything else. The flavors of the salt, pepper and veggies will get a chance to soak into the tuna and make it more flavorful)
* 1/2 cucumber-sliced (I put the tun on the cucumber slices. This is my favorite lunch)
* 200g greek yogurt with a tablespoon of unsweetened cocoa powder, and sweetener of choice. I use EZ Sweets.

**Dinner:**

* 4-5oz steak, chicken, or turkey (I've started to love meatloaf)
* Steamed veggies, be it broccoli with a bit of cheese, cauliflower with some seasonings (Or [Mashed Cauliflower](http://www.ibreatheimhungry.com/2012/01/better-than-potatoes-cheesy-cauliflower.html) with cheese. yum!)

**Dessert:**

* Breyers carb smart icecream (It tastes exactly the same as regular ice cream. It's just sweetened with splenda. 90 cals per 1/2 cup, and 4g net carbs)

26 years old, 5'11"".

On left is August 2008, at my largest. Well over 300 pounds, honestly have no idea what I weighed in at. Getting in shape was not even a thought until over a year after this was taken; January 2010 was when it officially began. I started by just eating healthier. No calorie counting involved. As far as exercise, I would walk on my treadmill three miles a day, on an incline. I gradually increased the incline. I also lifted weights randomly through the week; no special routines, just went to a friend's house and did whatever he was doing.

Before I knew it, I had lost over 60 pounds in three months. Eventually, walking was not doing it for me. I tried running... but was still too big. I screwed up my left knee, and still have problems running to this day. So, I bought a stationary bike... and that is when I had this stroke of genius:

[You can play video games all day long and lose weight doing it.](http://i.imgur.com/Go4w9.jpg) My brother and some of my friends also do this now. They tell me it was a stroke of genius, but really, it just came naturally. I got more into lifting, and with the bike, started dropping weight like crazy. My dad also got me a rowing machine as a Xmas gift, and I added that to the mix.

**EDIT:** [Link to the same model bike, since so many have asked.](http://www.amazon.com/Marcy-ME709-Recumbent-Mag-Cycle/dp/B002KV1MJU/ref=sr_1_16?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1356722284&amp;sr=8-16&amp;keywords=recumbent+magnetic+bike) Props to /u/geshikhte for finding it.

I lost about 110 pounds in a year. Over the next 8 months, it was a struggle to cut off the rest of it. Mostly, I was putting on muscle and losing fat at the same time. I switched up my routine a little, and also changed the diet a few times as well. All in all, I lost 135 pounds in 18 months.

Middle pic is at 180 pounds, in June 2011. I decided I was too skinny and wanted to bulk up. Plus, bodybuilding is a great way to stay in shape...

Right is me now. About a year of intense training and super strict dieting later, I am 220 pounds of meat. Going to try and cut off about 10 pounds soon.

This was all done through diet and exercise. No magic pills or surgery, no doctors or trainers. I have never set foot inside of a gym; I have everything I need at home. One day, I hope to re-create this picture. Except the one on the right will be lacking a shirt.

I also, around week 4 or so, started C25K. That's the only exercise I've done so far.

I've been meaning to make one of these posts for a long time because /r/loseit helped me so much, and came across the first photo in the album there and decided to finally post. 

So I was always fat.  Early last year I was 250 lbs, looked at myself in the mirror and thought ""Moosethumbs, you have said your whole life that you don't want to be fat.  And here you are at 28 and 250lbs.  This time next year you can either still be fat, or not.""  So I decided that I would not be fat any more.  One quote that really helped me focus was ""The best time to plant a tree is 20 years ago.  The second best time is now.""  

When I first started I was probably eating north of 3000 cals a day.  Here's a day that wasn't super common but definitely not unusual for me before I started losing: Breakfast: Cracker Barrel chicken fried chicken, biscuits, gravy, fried apples, grits, hashbrowns, few bites of pancakes the kids didn't eat. Lunch: Five Guys double cheeseburger, most of the fries.  Snack: Cookies.  Dinner: 15+ buffalo wings, most of a large potato wedges.  Dessert: Large Blizzard.

Now that wasn't every day of course but on like a weekend day where we were out a lot it was not at all unusual to eat out every meal.  I can almost guarantee that very day happened at some point.  Just looking at that list makes me queasy now... geeze...

So anyway, when I first started I was 250.  I started counting calories like a fiend.  I started with the goal of 2200 a day.  It freaking sucked at first.  The first couple of weeks I was constantly hungry, grumpy about it all the time, just generally pissed off.  After a while I got used to that, started learning just how many calories really are in things, and moved my goals down to 2000 cals, then 1800 cals.  I started by changing the kinds of things I ate, then eventually cutting out snacks altogether, then cutting out sides like fries when I ate out.  I weighed in twice a day, at morning at night, and kept a chart right next to my sink.  It really helped me understand how my body worked and also kept everything in perspective.  I tried hard not to think about how much I had to lose and focused on every small loss as a win.

I went from 250-220 in like 3 or 4 months and then kind of got depressed and gave up.  Thanksgiving time I started back up again, starting off at 225.  By January I was 217 and started running.  In Feb I was 213, and on March 21 I weighed in at 199.7 lbs. That was the first time I was under 200 in my adult life, basically.  By May I was 192, and on June 3 I weighed in at 183.9 marking the first time probably ever that I was a normal BMI.  That was my ultimate goal, to be able to say I'm not medically fat any more.  I'm normal.  I've hovered around there ever since, and right now I'm 178.  

Now I eat so completely differently than I used to.  I still eat out more than I should but I opt for the ""healthier"" things, and usually skip the sides altogether.  I still eat sweets sometimes, but it's not a twix bar once or twice every day like before.  During all of this my marriage pretty much fell apart, and one of my biggest personal victories is that through that I didn't give up and turn back to food for comfort.  

So that's pretty much that.  I cut calories.  I changed what I ate and how I ate.  I ran some.  I read /r/loseit all the time for help and inspiration.  I did the occasional bodyweight exercises.  Pull ups I like a lot, I went from 0 to now I can do 10ish.  I still feel like a fat person some times but when I look back on all I accomplished I feel really proud of myself.  /r/loseit has been super helpful to me, so I hope my story is able to help someone else out too.",,False,,t5_2rz8w,False,,70lbs,True,t3_10xqel,http://www.reddit.com/r/loseit/comments/10xqel/250_to_178_found_an_old_photo_that_made_me_go_whoa/,

I posted a month ago, and I'm only 5 pounds lower than my last post, but I measure out smaller and I look more in shape.*I feel like my exercise has been leading to the slowed pace of actual weight loss, because I'm really building muscle in spots that were just fat.* 



I'd love to get your honest opinions as to what my finishing weight goal should be. I don't want to become skinny, ever. I like having curves and meat on my bones, and I don't ever want to parade in a bikini, regardless of my size .**I'm just wondering if you all wonderful people could guide me with your thoughts of how much more I should lose. I'm thinking somewhere in the 15-20 pound range? I just realllly don't want to end up overdoing it in some weird body-image problem.** I'm not going by a BMI calculator- I find that method flawed in so many ways and I refuse to follow it. 


As for my continued regimen- I've been taking lots of vitamins, and a gracious member of the /r/loseit community actually went out of his way to send me a couple pieces of exercise equipment as a gift, because I was using soup cans as dumbbells. With his jaw droppingly sweet gift, I have been able to strengthen my core and my stamina. He sent me a 10 pound kettlebell and a jump rope, along with some other really sweet goodies. I enjoy using the two both very much and it's helped immensely. (He works for a wonderful health  company called **Onnit**. Not advertising, but just giving credit where it's due!

In terms of food, I actually eat a breakfast which usually consists of a combination of- oatmeal with a spoon of honey, greek yogurt with some granola, a hard boiled egg, or a cliff bar. This keeps me full throughout my difficult physically exhausting shifts at work and I usually eat a protein filled dinner. I enjoy grilled chicken a lot, and I've come up with a recipe that is absolutely freaking delicious and it very easy, and healthy!**So I grill chicken ahead of time, and that way I can cut it up and put a couple pieces in a bag and have that as a great, protein filled snack.** 

I've cut down on carbs a lot, too. And instead of using boxed pasta if I want carbs with my meal, I use more natural grains, like quinoa and barley. I love making lentils, too, and those are great for you, really move your system along, and are EXTREMELY filling!

Back story first, I wasn't always fat, I can recall sometimes in high school going past the 200 mark, I wanna say junior year (so that was 2000-2001). I was active during this time, I would roller blade a lot.  But I would just go more up senior year then after high school. I would work at a movie theater for 6 years, so getting money and eating free food all day, I would balloon and eventually pass the 300 mark. Looking at old pictures would kinda depress me, worst feeling was one time I went to six flags and tried to go on a roller coaster but wouldn't be let on due to me being too big.

Anyways, onto how I did it, now I never made a true effort to lose weight before this, oh I would do a few things here and there like make turkey burgers, but im sure I made up for it in other ways.
I used to always eat hot pockets, soda, iced tea, lean cuisines, pizza, candy and many other things.
Also I was around 320 pounds, XXL shirts (even tho some would fit tight!) and size 44 or 46 pants.
So January 27th, 2012 I decided, lets try this for real, whats the worse that could happen? And I only thought about it the night before! So I weighed myself, and I would weigh myself everyday from here on out! The first day it said 319 lbs. So I knew from the get go I would try to only drink water, no more soda, iced tea, juices or any of that! Also I would eat something with dinner I rarely had.....vegetables!
Also exercise, I would take a walk, but also for once try to jog, even if it was only a spurt for a few seconds.
After a few days I would start doing my route that I still do to this day. 3.5 miles. Also for breakfast I would only eat oatmeal or bran flakes. Lunch would be 2 pieces of whole wheat stone ground bread, with light turkey lunch meat, and a chobani yogurt. That's it and dinner would be chicken (with bread crumbs) apple sauce (unsweetened) and a side of vegetables.

First week I lost 13 pounds, I would never lose this much in 1 week again, probably water weight.
Feb 10th I would be 300 pounds, in 2 weeks I would achieve what seemed so hard to me at first, my goal was now 250. Hell I wanted to just be XL and be 40 waist, that would be cool, just not o be at the end of the sizes in the stores.

Now I realize what I ate was probably under 1,000 calories, hell possibly 800 or less, but it worked.
March 30th, I would reach 250 lbs, 2 months and 2 days it took me.
Now I would move to a number goal that I thought of, but thought it was silly and impossible to think of....200 lbs. By now I was jogging more and more, I don't know if I was verging on running yet but I know either way I would always be pushing myself. Interestingly I would do this 3 days then take a day break, just a walk. Also I was lucky this winter it didn't really snow, but then again that didn't stop me this winter (more on that later). My next goal in my head would be 219 since that was 100 pounds. I would see the doctor for a physical, he said he would like to see me at 180, which I agreed with, cause I thought to myself if I reach 200 might as well go under!

I wouldn't treat myself this whole time, I was just so focused on losing weight. I would add a banana at some point to my breakfast.
June 1st I would be 199 pounds. 5 months and somehow the first number of my weight went from 3 to 1. Now I was more running, also I said it was 3.5 miles, well first 0.5 mile is just walking then the 2.5 miles would be jogging/running, obv with some little walking breaks.
last 0.5 mile would be just a cool down walk, this wouldn't last.
July 8th, it would happen, the scale would say 180 pounds. 
5 months, 10 days it would take to go from 319 to 180 pounds.
But would I just settle on that? Nope.
And I finally did treat myself again, had a hoagie, in fact Ive had one once a week (sometimes twice) and have kept off the weight!
I have only drank water, have yet to have a drop of soda, in fact I'm never even tempted to have it.
Exercise still, running more and more oh yea when I began It would take about an hour, 10 minutes, my fastest time I have done it is 38 minutes, usually around 40 minutes.
And I run outside all the time, never joined a gym or a club or any of that! And I have ran in 90-100 degree weather, and even in 20 degree, hell wind chill in the single digits weather! Even with snow on the ground! I do it no matter what usually. (well unless its down pouring all day).

I would keep on going down (albeit slower now since I wasn't meaning to) and now have been around 165 for the past few months, and love it!
Ill have a slice of cheese with my sandwich, I've had different cereals (frosted mini wheat, raisin bran, honey nut cheerios) I eat more fruit now even.
Now some may say I lost it too quick, I say I was just really determined, if Im gonna do something I go full throttle, someone saw me, EARLY ON and said I looked sick lol. I feel great though. Of course though I must show a picture! I took the after ones today!

Greetings from an norwegian sexylubben (sexychubby) man that got on keto two years ago, it has been alot on and of, but it has steady been going downhill on the weight, i was 286lb at the most and now i am down to 220lb. It feels so great and i can finally play football with my friends and other activities and not feel stupid becouse im sutch a fatty, i think we all know what i mean :p  my goal is 176lb and there i think i will be pretty happy with my self. All i did was beginning to eat keto style with good ingredients, i am training two times a week, off course i can train mutch more, but as long the weight goes down and i feel comfortable that two times a week is enough, the only way to loose weight is that you need to find a way that you can deal with and works perfect with yourself,  and training two times a week is perfect for me :) So i hope to see more of all your great achievements, and hopefully i will allso join you in more before and after pictures and great stories.

I posted progress pictures in February after a vacation to Hawaii. I'm going to be lazy and copy and paste what I've been doing, so apologies if anyone has deja vu reading it. 

I started my health-kick in June (a few months after my before pics were taken). I wasn't too unhappy with my size, but I was noticeably out of shape after I had stopped kickboxing regularly. This was really affecting my mood, and I was having issues with anxiety as well. When I had taken kickboxing, I was introduced to the TRX (www.trxtraining.com) for strength cross-training. I tried it once, and I was hooked. I've never had such a difficult workout! So I managed to buy a TRX on sale (thankfully, as they are pricey), and a door anchor so I could work out from home (this meant no excuses not to do it). I began by working out (30-40 mins) every 2 days, and now I probably exercise between 5-7 days per week. As the exercise increased and improved, so did my diet. I find that once I get into an exercise routine, my body just begins craving more fruits and vegetables, and I have also been consciously focusing on not snacking too much. (I cave every so often, I have a sweet tooth like you wouldn't imagine). I don't count calories; I personally find it stressful to track everything (though I totally understand and support those who do, this is just my own choice!), but I do eat much less. Portion sizes have been reduced, and vegetable/fruit intake has greatly increased. Now that it's warm out, I bike/walk most places, getting additional exercise on my commute.

",883,189,342,http://www.reddit.com/r/loseit/comments/rl30l/things_i_do_because_im_fat_a_list_i_made_when_i/,"Almost two years ago I was 340 pounds.  I've went up and down on the scale and I am now at 287 pounds.  I'm not out of the woods yet, but I'm getting there.  

In June of 2010 I was sitting in the locker room after going to the gym and I was attempting to put my shoes back on.  If any of you have been as obese as I have been then you know how challenging this can be.  You can't reach your foot, you have to pull your leg up to you by using your pants leg, your belly is crushing your diaphragm while you bend over and you get extremely short of breath.  As I was going through this struggle in the locker room that day I remember putting my head up against the locker as the tears began to well up in my eyes.  I couldn't cry, because other men would have been weirded out by the blubbering fat guy in the locker room, but I came close.

Instead, that day I got out my phone and opened up the notepad and began making a list.  I made a list of things that I did specifically because I was fat. I wanted to make this list because I knew that within a couple of years or so I wasn't going to be fat any more.  I wanted to be able to look back on this list and be proud of how far I had come and the things that I didn't do any more. 

Here are a few of the things that I put on my list.  I'll cross through the things I've already beaten: 
1.	~~I get short of breath when I’m trying to tie my shoes.~~
2.	~~Use the pants leg of my jeans to pull my foot closer to me.~~
3.	~~Pick things up with my feet really well to avoid bending over.~~
4.	~~Avoid stairs like the plague.~~ (challenge accepted)
5.	~~Avoid physical activity in groups if at all possible.~~
6.	~~Avoid scales at all costs.~~
7.	Jiggle when I brush my teeth.  
8.	~~Avoid normal stores because they don’t sell my clothing size.~~
9.	Sweat…constantly.
10.	~~Get extra food at the drive-thru to eat on the way home, in addition to food that I will eat when I get home.~~
11.	Create a crater in my mattress.
12.	~~Try to sit in chairs that have high arms on them because I am able to sink into them and FEEL small.~~
13.	Never ever take a normal photograph if I can help it.
14.	~~Get upset when everyone else at the table orders water because I wanted a soda but I’m not going to order one because I would be the only one.~~
15.	~~Make a joke about my weight.~~
16.	Cover my belly when I am at someone’s house with a pillow while sitting on their couch because I think that my size will be less noticeable.
17.	~~Constantly pull and tug at the bottoms of my shirts to make sure they aren’t hugging my rolls or riding up and showing anything off.~~
18.	~~Pull my pants up constantly because I lack a waistline and so that people can’t see my butt when I bend over.~~

Please remember, I made this list almost 2 years ago and my outlook has changed a lot.  I realize that obesity is nothing to laugh at and that making jokes about my weight was actually a defense mechanism I would use to stave off depression.  

If you would like to continue reading the rest of the list and some of my thoughts on it, please go check out my health journal at moveyourbuttjosh.blogspot.com

I am VERY proud to say that many of the things on this list are things that I do not do any more.  I'm curious to hear some of your successes? What are things that you don't have to do any more as a result of losing weight?

Not just ""eating less is hard!"", (which is valid and true!), but rather a discussion for those of us that have experienced a persisting, negative effect of weight loss. As a result, this post might be triggering to some. 

I don't want to discourage anyone from losing weight, I think it's great. But everyone is always talking about progress, and we rarely stop to check in on what we cannot see. This is to open up dialogue for anyone on this subreddit that's felt like they've gained or lost a little more than they bargained for. 

My story? In short: Without realising, over a year, I slipped from healthy weight loss into an ED (please don't shut the thread because of this). Then I gained up to (and a little bit above) a healthy weight. This story I could write volumes on, but I won't go into detail here. It's taken a long time to get close to recovery, and I won't say I'm there yet. In learning how to eat properly again (something I'm still doing), I realised that ED thoughts are just a level up from the diet mentality. 

I began to wonder, who else is experiencing these thoughts without realising? By these thoughts, I mean obsessive thoughts about food, body image, weight, exercise, etc. Who else is just rationalising these thoughts as acceptable because they're overweight?

A lot of the time, it's not just willpower. It's physiological and psychological. 

I don't want to classify people as having ED. I don't want to make any huge stances or proclamations about the way people should lose weight. I just want to remind everyone to check in with the way that they're feeling. Let's recognise that and continue to burn, baby, burn (that fat)!

Weight loss shouldn't be miserable. It should't take over your thoughts. You should be celebrating your milestones, not commiserating each step of the way. Weight loss can be one step forward, two steps back, but it shouldn't be a constant cycle. 

*So in losing weight, have you experienced what I have? Or have you had to let go of any other mental baggage?*

I started dieting back in February of last year. I began with weight watchers' points system, and then decided about 4 months later that it wasn't going fast enough for me, and I wanted a bit more... substance out of my food. I'd lost 20 pounds by May/June when I started keto.

The first picture above is of my (now) wife and I at Christmas 2011. She also began dieting with me in February, and she managed to lose approximately another 60 pounds after this. She's currently pregnant and stagnating with the weight loss, understandably. She started keto before I did and converted me to her cause, so I have a lot to thank her for.

Here's a picture of us on our wedding day in June, with me weighing in at approximately 210-220: http://i.imgur.com/ERYkQAZ.jpg

I continued on keto for quite some time, and am still on the diet. I simply love the way it makes me feel. I'm also currently on a polyphasic sleep schedule and have found that a ketogenic diet GREATLY reduces the amount of time that you spend in light, useless sleep, freeing me up for more healthy, restful sleep in the 4 hours a day that I get it.

You can say there's a multitude of reasons for it;  food addiction, mental issues, terrible lifestyle, depression... take your pick.  Bottom line though, I've struggled with my weight for as long as I can remember.

I turned 38 in july of 2012 and I realized that at my weight (561) I wasnt going to live much longer the way I was going.  Since I was planning on asking my fiance to marry me, I realized it was now or never.

Thanks to the good folks over at /r/keto I've found a diet that is compatible with all of my issues and actually works for me.  Best part is, Its a diet I can stick with.  After 3 months on the diet (I lost my first 18 pounds through calorie restriction and still getting lots of carbs), I'm feeling and looking better.

I don't have very many good photos of myself.  I wish I'd been documenting from the start.  However, I'm a youtuber and I make 2-3 videos a week.  Here are two screenshots taken 6 months apart, roughly.  See if you can spot the differences.

This is the first time in 10 years I've gone without soda. I've been averaging 4 cans of Coke a day. I decided, fuck that.

I had my last one late Monday night. I've limited myself to one strongly caffeinated cup of tea in the morning and the rest of the time, only water.

I passed out yesterday after class. Woke up with the shakes. Later that night I had the worst stomach pains ever experienced and then the worst diarrhea I've had in a long time.

I've been using the Sleep Cycle app for the past 13 days. The peaks are when Im awake. If I wake up I make a note of the time to check the apps accuracy and it works surprisingly well.

Here is what my average night looks like:
http://i.imgur.com/8IMDDeQ.png

Here is how my sleep pattern was last night, 24 hours with no soda:
http://i.imgur.com/JgONTBc.png

The giant peak in that one was because I started it two hours before I actually went to bed so it got me walking around the house and what not.

Anyways- I started off at 220lbs in the fall. Monday I was 198 and today Im 196. Most of the weight loss is due to switching antidepressants.

Now if only I could get rid of this headache...


Edit: wow this got a lot of attention. Ill be sure to post another edit tomorrow with a graph of how sleeping goes tonight. 

My head still hurts, I'm a little dizzy, and I'm starving...but it's too late now. I've felt so shitty these last two days that there's no way I'm going back. Must. Pull. Through!

Edit 2: because people are asking-I'm female, 5'2"", 21 years old. I was on generic Celexa for about a year and went from 165lbs to 220 very quickly. I switched to welbutrin and its been helping a lot. It feels like a fog has lifted from my head.

Antidepressants are not a cure all. It can be helpful but won't do shit if you perpetuate negative thought patterns. For some, they will be a short term thing just to get you on your feet. For others, like me, it's a long term thing.

My experience has been like a truck getting stuck in mud. CBT would spin the wheels of the truck but it was the meds that gave me the strong push to gain traction.


Edit 3: as promised, here's what the app had To show for last night. Back to somewhat normal sleep. Headache isn't nearly as bad anymore.

Today is my 24th birthday. The past year has been a pretty crazy one for me. Since I started living healthier in January, I've lost over 50 lbs, completely changed how and what I eat, and found a form of exercise that I truly enjoy.

If you had told me a year ago that I had done all of this, I would have laughed and wondered exactly how drunk/high you were. I've tried losing weight before and failed miserably each time, I've tried different kinds of exercise and also failed miserably, and I tried eating healthier, and again failed miserably.

But this time was different. Not only was I in the right mindset to do all of these things, but I found a community that I liked and one that accepted me.

I've read a lot of success stories where people had a certain ""breaking point"", where they just had enough of how miserable they felt or how much food they just ate, etc. But for me, I didn't really have such a breaking point (at least, not that I can recall). I had already resolved to eat better once I moved out of my parents' place, as I would be able to control what I bought at the grocery store, but it wasn't until I read Ben Davis' blog that something in my head just clicked. And so I decided that on Monday, January 23 I would start living healthier and like Ben would update my progress on a blog, as accountability in my opinion is a big factor in weight loss.

One of my goals when I started my blog was to get to 220 lbs by my 24th birthday. As of this morning I weighed 221.6 lbs. While I did not reach my goal, the fact that I've stuck with it for 8 months and am that close is good enough for me. This is the thinnest I have been in nearly a decade and while I still have more to lose, I know I can continue doing what I've been doing.

And for those who are curious how I did it... I started with Weight Watchers but two months ago switched over to MyFitnessPal. I also have a fairly active job so that helped with the steady weight loss. I started exercising regularly in February but didn't start running until late July. My starting weight was 273 lbs, and I'm around 221 lbs right now. My heaviest weight though, back in 2007-2008 was 295 lbs.

For the past few years, I have hated who I am. I don't have any friends and I haven't had a girlfriend in almost a decade. The time for excuses is over. My starting weight is now my background at work, and at home.

I am comprising a list of ""goals"" for myself. I have been tracking my food regularly on MFP, but haven't changed any habits up until this point. But, it's time to start. I simply cannot keep living this way.

My goal is to get under 200lbs. At 5'7"", my ""target"" weight should be about 150. I'm not trying to be some ripped guy who lives at the gym. I just don't want to be 400lbs when I turn 30. I'm 28 now, and everything after high school has been a blur, socially.

I'm now the proud owner of a defined set of knuckles on each hand, rather than just a blob of a fist :) 

So I decided to lose weight in December 2011. At 155cm, I was 82kg at my heaviest. It's taken me a while because I haven't been super strict with my diet. I've generally tried to stick to keto where I can, with some intermittent fasting thrown in - at least one day a week, usually two. I wasn't super strict with keto. I found I was still comfortably in ketosis while eating about 25-30g net carbs a day. I usually ate some berries and nuts, and drank a fair bit of full cream milk. I also drank, but just made sure to get a vodka and diet coke. 

From January to August 2012, I saw a personal trainer once a week and worked out about 3 nights a week. I was working an office job at the time, and this was leading up to a backpacking trip in Europe. 

While abroad, I ate whatever the hell I wanted. I was fully anticipating stacking nearly all my weight back on - at that stage, I was about 72kg - but surprisingly, considering I spent most of my time in Germany, I only put 2.5kg back on. 

When I came back, I got a new job in a bar. Didn't pay as well, so I had to forfeit my PT and gym membership, but considering each shift is up to six hours of running around hauling slabs and buckets of ice up and down stairs would go a fair way to keeping my exercise up. 

I have PCOS, and I take Metformin for it, so no doubt it's helped me along the way. But even though I knew from the start I wanted to lose nearly 30kg, I've also only ever viewed it in 5kg increments. I have no deadline; I'll reach my goal weight when I reach it. 

Anyway, thanks for reading, and thanks for the support :)

My boyfriend had bought me clothes for Christmas that were embarrassingly tight (I couldn't get the shirt all the way up my arms and trying to squeeze into them with him watching was humiliating. Even more so was the ""Don't worry, I'm sure they have bigger sizes - we can exchange them."" conversation I had afterward). Now I can finally fit into them - and well! - and I was ecstatic to be able to share my victory with the [/r/loseit](/r/loseit)  community. My NSV was deleted (actually DELETED) from this subreddit, the only comment being that we can't post NSVs unless they are MAJOR. Who decides if they're major victories? That WAS a major victory for me, the first I've had since starting this journey besides the losing of 25lbs. Now I see people posting their NSVs about how they were able to run next to an attractive woman without feeling bad about themselves, or that they've finally noticed the weightloss - or that their husband noticed it (don't get me wrong, I love all of these things and I love seeing them on the front page I'm just wondering what separates the major from the minor). 

I have to admit, after seeing my victory deleted I was upset, it shouldn't matter to me that no one gets to see my victory on Reddit but it does. I don't have many people who I can brag to in daily life and I'm sure my boyfriend is tired of hearing me talk about how I've lost the weight of an average 2 year old. The main motivator I have, that many people have, is support. I just needed to post this ""slight"" rant because I felt myself holding a grudge and I don't want to lose the excitement of going to [/r/loseit](/r/loseit) and seeing all of these wonderful people and their personal NSVs. So there.

Thank you all for taking the time to listen (I know many people are reluctant to click on 'rant' posts lol) and for supporting my victory and sharing your own.

Edit 3: thanks guys! As for how I did it, well, it took a lot of hard work. The time span was about a year (from april to april), with me losing 20 lbs during the summer and 30 lbs during the school year. Mind you, I had been an over-eater my whole life, and so it was pretty easy to lose weight by cutting portion sizes. During the summer, I kept mostly my old eating habits, but ran 5k every day and did 45 mins on the Stairmaster. During the fall/winter, I played lots of sports to keep active, but really paid attention to what I was eating. Why was I snacking? Did I need to eat that granola bar? I realized that I was bored, and not really hungry. So in the end, diet and exercise both contribute to weight loss, but if you do not alter your diet, it will be harder to lose weight.

I took refuge in the gym, finding it was a great place for me to release stress and ease my emotions. With that came more running and eating healthier. I totally eliminated fast food from my diet and very seldom drink soda. Needless to say I am 10x happier than I once was although I still struggle with confidence I know it will come with time.

------------------------------------------------


Wow, time flies. It's been 12 months since I started my lifestyle change. I honestly thought I would have made more progress than I have, and I'm slightly disappointed at that, but to be fair I did set the bar extremely high for myself, so I'm proud of how much I've accomplished. I told myself that no matter how much progress I made, I would post my progress after one year, so here I am. 



In July of 2011, I was at my heaviest. I avoided a scale for a long time, because I knew I was gaining weight, but I just didn't know how much. After growing some balls, I weighed myself and almost had a heart attack - I was around 285 pounds. This would be acceptable if I was 7 feet tall, but unfortunately I am only 6'0, so I had to accept the fact that I was morbidly obese. That was a wake up call for me, I started my lifestyle change immediately. There were no ""Oh okay, let me have gorge myself today, and then start tomorrow"" days, as there were in the past. I was in so much shock and disgust at how much I had let myself go that it was easy. I could make excuses to why I became morbidly obese, but the simple truth is that food is delicious and I was a glutton. I ate way too much, and extremely unhealthy. I didn't exercise at all, and occasionally I would eat more calories in **one day** than I do now in an entire week. 



I immediately started counting calories (MyFitnessPal made this easy), and hitting the gym. I started at 2,400 calories, worked myself down to 2,000 and eventually 1,750. I just recently started a split where I eat 2,200 on workout days and 1,800 on rest days (3 workout days, 4 rest days). As far as workout goes, I pushed myself extremely hard in the beginning. I used to almost push myself to the point of over training. There were days where I would go to the gym in the morning to lift weights, do cardio in the afternoon, and then go workout a different muscle group at night. I started with a 6 day split, and eventually worked my way down to a 3 day split. I do Chest/Triceps on Monday, Back/Biceps/Core on Wednesday, and Shoulders/Legs on Friday. 


I'm now down to 170 pounds, and a little unsure of my future. I want to bulk up a bit, but at the same time I want to keep losing weight, because my ultimate goal is single digit body fat. I don't want to get to get to single digit body fat and look scrawny, due to not having a large amount of muscle mass. So I think I'm going to slowly bulk to about 185, and then lose 20-25 pounds slowly, to end up looking better than I would with the amount of muscle I have now. Either way, it sure as hell beats how I looked before, I'll admit that much. 



I don't really know what else to write. I guess if anyone has any questions or comments, fire away. One thing I can say though, is that if you're thinking about losing weight, or have already begun your lifestyle change (Honestly, it's a lifestyle change, NOT a diet. I promise you won't go back to the way you were before), I have to tell you.. It is **COMPLETELY** worth it. Honestly, I can't tell you how much better my life is now that I've lost this weight. I look and feel a million times better than I did before. Literally every single aspect of my life has improved, without a doubt. I know it's extremely hard at times - I won't lie to you and say it's easy - but hell .. it's worth every single drop of sweat, and then some. 


I also want to thank everyone on this subreddit. I don't really ever post here (mostly because by the time I log in and type up a comment, my mind goes ""Screw it, your opinion isn't *that* important), but I lurk a lot, and I can say this subreddit and /r/progresspics are both very motivational and extremely helpful. 


Cheers :)


Edit: **HOLY CRAP** wow, thanks for the overwhelmingly positive replies guys, definitely didn't expect to get home from work and see this many comments, that's crazy.

He is naturally skinny, can run for miles, can eat whatever he wants, you know the deal. So it sucked to feel be so much bigger than him. My self-esteem tanked. 

We have always been really happy relationship-wise and when I am happy I eat. He is also an amazing cook so we would eat amazing food all the time.

I'm 5'11'' /180cm/1.8m tall and my current weight is somewhere in between 202.8 - 205lb (92/93kg). 

I still have 12 kilos to lose (26.45lb), my goal weight is 81kg (178.5lb)

I've changed my routine, I hit the gym everyday, no seriously everyday (Sunday - Sunday). I do 40 minutes of cardio. I hate the treadmill, therefore I only do stair-master, elliptical and stationary bike (not all in one day), although sometimes I mix two exercise. 
I do some weight training as well (6 times a week Mon-Sat). 

There are no mystery about my diet. I cut all fast food, sugary food. I don't eat fast food anymore. I do still drink 1 can of coke zero at night. 

Breakfast: two bananas, oat and diet yogurt

I've been getting a whole lot of comments lately, and putting these pictures together, I can see why. It's so easy to forget how far you've come in your progress. I'm 5'10, and I don't know how much weight I've lost, but I've lost 7 inches from my bust and hips, and 6 from my waist between these two pictures. 

What I do: I use my TRX (it's a suspension trainer, if you're unfamiliar) at least every 2 days, sometimes every day, depending on DOMS. I eat a lot more fruits and veggies, and a lot less junk and crap. I don't really count calories, but I don't eat if I'm not hungry and I have cut down on portion size drastically (amazingly, it works!). If I've had a bad day for overeating, I sometimes will throw in a semi-fasting day, where I'll only eat veggies for lunch, and then eat a normal dinner. 

Hope this motivates someone! Loseit has been the best motivator for me, and I'd love to pay some of that forward. ",,True,,t5_2rz8w,False,,,True,t3_s6ct5,http://www.reddit.com/r/loseit/comments/s6ct5/7_months_progress_nsfw/,

I have always been a big guy, overweight most of my life. I always put off losing weight, saying, ""I'll do it next year,"" or ""Ill start eventually"", etc. 

At 27 years old, I realized my life was slipping away. The one issue that was holding be back from truly being happy was my weight. 99% of my problems came down to that as the cause. 

So I decided I had wasted enough time. It was time to change. 

I started counting calories and running. Completed C25K and kept going. I added miles 1 by 1 and am now up to a half marathon (+/-), 5 days a week. 

Getting started was the hardest part. The first 2 weeks or so sucked serious balls. After that, it was easy. Eating healthy became the norm. It was my default.

I'm Justin and I'm in DFW.  I started back in mid-April 2012 and I'm down 113 lbs so far.  My starting point was 498; I'm currently at 385 and my goal (at present) is ~220... that may change when I get to that point, I just don't know.  

I think the best advice I could give someone who's starting to seriously change their life is:  mistakes happen.  Don't compound it by not getting back up and dusting yourself off.  I fall off the wagon fairly regularly, though it's getting less and less, but the trick is to get up, dust off and chase the wagon down so you can get back on.  

I had a Weight Watchers leader once (long ago) who told me two things that have stayed with me.

#1- ""If you were holding a dozen eggs, and you dropped one, you wouldn't say 'oh well,' and drop the rest, would you?""

#2- ""A stick of butter weighs 1/4lb... every pound you loose is 4 sticks of butter.""  Take a second and think about that... When I have a poor showing on the scale, I think 'all that matters is: the general direction the needle is going is down.'

Anyhow, I'm excited to find this subreddit!  Good luck to everyone on their journeys!

I've been getting compliments on my weight loss for the past 12 months, everybody keeps telling me that I'm [looking slimmer and slimmer](http://dl.dropbox.com/u/18264/beforeafter3.jpg), even people who've only met me a few months ago. Yesterday my best friend, someone I've known since the early 90s, asked me if I was wearing an XL.

And yet, by going from 445 to 315 lbs, I've only gone from superextraobese to just normally obese. I still wear a 3XL, my pants are still a 44 and I have a bunch of trouble finding ones that will fit my rather large legs (obesity + squatting + cycling). It's not that I'm far from slim, it's that I need to lose 60lb to be *overweight*. Half the people on here posting success stories started at a lower weight/BMI than I am at right now.

So it's a little weird, this transitional space between fat and fit. More than halfway there, but still a ways to go. Not asking for input or advice, just wanted to share.

Update 1: This one seems to keep coming up, so I just want to put it out there: I'm not worried, discouraged, complaining or anything like that, I just wanted to share some thoughts that have been knocking around in my head.

So, I was just turning 30, around 310lbs with back problems, and knee pains, and feeling in poor condition overall.  I was nursing my mother back form back surgery, and it was a nightmare process for us both.  At that point, I decided to do what was in my power to help avoid those type things down the line for myself.

I had already been cycling for about year, and even at 310 lbs, I had completed my first ""Century"" ride (100 miles).  So I knew I had to address the diet.  First thing i did was cut soda.  Then for lunch every day at work, (at the local Cuban restaurant) I stopped ordering full meals (meat, rice, beans, plantains, etc) and opted for a bowl of beans.  Black, red, garbanzo, etc.  All delicious, filling, and lower in calories then the previous (much cheaper, too).  As time went by, and i started losing some weight, I got more into it.  I started eating oatmeal in the morning, rather than donuts, or pastries.  When I went out to dinner, I'd order an appetizer (fish dip, 10 chicken wings) or a salad, or a piece of chicken with veggies, whatever - I just tried to be smarter and mitigate the damages of the outing.  At home I turned to veggies, egg whites, chicken, tuna, and, most importantly, smaller portions overall.
  
And I kept riding, riding, riding.  I went from 40 miles a week upto near 200 miles a week.  I have broken 2 frames so far under my weight and torque, but I just get a new one and keep going.

Now im about 225-230 lbs, about 15% body fat, and while I would like to see about 10-15 lbs lower, I am plenty happy with where I am.  I feel strong and healthy.  I no longer ever feel intimidated by physical activities or exertions.  Im not lazy anymore - not just physically but in other aspects of my life.  Also, the extra looks I get from time to time dont feel too bad either :P

Anyway, here I am, over 2 years into my weightloss journey, and I can say that I am happier, and relieved I dont live the way I used to.  ",,False,,t5_2rz8w,False,,,True,t3_wvf8y,http://www.reddit.com/r/loseit/comments/wvf8y/my_weightloss_process_lots_of_pics/,

Amazing to think that the time sink that is reddit, so responsible for me sitting on my backside in front of a computer day in day out, is also directly responsible for me finding a way to lose weight consistently, change my lifestyle and spend more time exercising than ever before!   
  
I decided to change my diet just over a year ago and restrict carbohydrates heavily based on a lot of helpful, motivating and inspiring content I found in this sub and other weight loss subs, I settled on eating about 1600kcal per day and for the first 9 months at least, didn't really change anything else in terms of exercise, I was walking about 3 miles a day to and from work but that was about it. 

More recently, I've been trying to be more active. I am now in week 9 (the final week!) of /r/c25k and can run consistently for 3 miles in 30 minutes, three times a week- absolutely insane considering this time last year I was suffering shin splints just walking downhill for half a mile!

I have just invested in and am awaiting delivery of a power rack, bench, 7ft Olympic bar, 145kg of weights, a couple of dumbbells and a few other lifting accessories and now really hope to focus on improving strength and toning up!

**And if you're interested about my story:**

You know, I am that guy. The gamer. In pretty much all my life, I've been sitting infront of the computer nearly every day, doing nothing else. I used to spend about 8hours average a day playing computer, and on weekends I sat even longer, dwelling into the night and sleeping long on the mornings.

And that's not only it, I also drank alot of coke. My average was 3 cans of coke per weekday, and the weekends about 4. (1 can 33cl). Chips and candy were also bought nearly every day. It wasn't looking to well, no exercise with alot of bad stuff. I also rarely ate 'real food', just this junk infront of the computer. It all got to the point where I could feel my heart bumping a few extra times and I got signs of diabetes. 

One day I just lost it. I got so damn depressed and started thinking suicidal and those things. 'Why am I such a looser' etc etc. Then I came to my senses, and thought to myself. 'Okay, so why the hell am I sitting here whining when there are people that got it so much worse than me. I need to-shape-up. I don't want to live this life. Life is too precious to not be living. Im doing this.'

So I ran. I ran. Everyday I went out to run. 1km went into 3km. 3km went into 5km and soon I was able to run 10 kilometers. I felt alive.

After 16 weeks I'd gone down from 96kg to 80kg, reaching my goal. Nowadays, I am exercising on a regular basis. I havn't felt anything wrong since I started exercising with my heart or body, and I can finally manage to do things without being lazy. I've stopped drinking coke, which have saved me a lot of money.

Even if my weight loss wasnt as spectacular as some other people in this subreddit I feel I made a major change in my life. Stopping eating unhealthy stuff and focusing on real food my life has gotten so much better, I can feel it so well. My self-confidence has grown so much, I've gotten more extrovert and I can more easily socialize with people, and girls ;) (Which can be very hard for people with no experience)

I would like to give a message to all people who are thinking about loosing weight, (specially gamers since that my 'genre'), DO IT. Change your life, be a new person. I know a lot of people may be saying this, but it's true. It will surely hurt, but it's always worth it in the end.

EDIT: I am 19 years old and 187 cm.

**The best tip I can give to other gamers losing weight;**

When you feel hungry, and you just have this sugar demand that it's fucking crazy - Go game. Whenever I started to get hungry after school and I didn't got to eat before dinner I'd take a bottle of water and just game the shit out of something. If you continously drink the water it will dampen the hunger and the game will keep you focused on something else than the hunger. I'd even go watch some game of thrones or death note, anything works.

EDIT2: **My eating guidelines**

* No soda, candy or that stuff.
* 3 meals a day - breakfast, lunch and dinner 
* Prioritize protein before carbohydrates (try to get full on the fish and not the mashed potatoes, for example.) 
* I watch the portions I eat and I make sure not to eat more than I actually need, if I get full, I stop eating. 
* If I get hungry - I'd drink water and play games. (May be hard at work/school but I try to get focused on something else than the hunger) 
* If the above doesn't work, I make sure to smash the shit out of an egg/banana and absolutely kill it.

EDIT3: Wow, I didn't think it would get this popular, but this means so much to me! Thank you everyone for your kind words.

In my very last edit that im going to do here I just want to say this: Remember, everyone can go down in weight, with or without exercising, it's just that exercising makes it so much easier. Some like running, some like biking and some like walking. You just have to find what suits you best.
**GOOD LUCK EVERYONE!**

To me, this accomplishment might be bigger than losing the weight itself and I had to share. It has not been easy, nor a straight line.

Don't get me wrong, shedding more than 200 pounds and going from a body fat percentage of 60+% to 14.5%, learning to live in the center of my equation for the first time ever, sharing my story for the world to see, and loving and accepting myself along the way – those are incredible, incredible accomplishments for which I am forever grateful and extremely proud! Nothing can ever change that.

But this last year of learning to maintain my healthy weight and lifestyle, while keeping myself in the center of the equation, is even more incredible to me. And, perhaps even more rewarding – if that’s  possible! 

When I was in fat/weight loss mode, I was focused like a laser beam on getting to goal. Quitting was not an option and it took all I had to get there. So, I didn’t think about “what next?”. I didn’t dwell on how to maintain my weight and live in this new body and new life once I reached goal. Perhaps part of me thought when I got “there” I would look and feel so great that I would simply be blessed with the willpower to maintain my weight no matter what. That it would be easy.

The truth is, it is not about willpower and it is absolutely not easy. All the same challenges I’ve had with food and work my whole life are still there and my primary coping mechanism of turning to food in times of high emotion, stress and for comfort – is gone. It is replaced by exercise and fitness, time with friends, and my coaching work. Maintaining a healthy lifestyle, takes constant awareness, diligence and focus. It is a indeed a new way of living. There are ups and downs. It is difficult. And, it is awesome!

Thanks to everyone here for your support of the new lifestyle. My first post here was early on in the maintenance journey and I received lots of help and support from others on the path. I am grateful.

**About Me:**I grew up always the bigger kid. In High School I was 6'3"" and always used my height as an excuse to explain my weight. I was lying to myself daily. From 2004 to 2008 I played a ridiculous amount of video games. I normally spent about 12-16 hours per day playing World of Warcraft or other games. The addiction grew as I started college. I hit my final height of 6'6"" and just kept gaming away eating anything and everything from whole pizzas and bags of chips to sometimes two 2 liters of soda in a night.

**Breaking Point:**In July 2010 I lost my grandfather to a long fight of poor health due to complications with diabetes. It was a shock to the system as my parents always warned me about diabetes but this time it really hit home.
I bought a scale that didn't read ""error"" and I had ballooned to **375lb**

**How I Lost it:**My mom bought me a gym membership as a way to motivate me to lose weight in August 2010. The gym was open 24 hours a day, which was great for me. I was so big that I was embarrassed to work out. My first day in the gym, my T-shirt looked like it was dipped in water from all the sweat. I would start on the treadmill and move to the weights and finish with the bike. I would go from about 1 a.m. to 3 a.m. and go home and sleep before my classes later in the day. It became a nice little routine.

Another big change I made was my diet. I never actually counted calories, but I took all the knowledge about food I could find from school, from TV and from websites to find meals that were deemed ""healthy"" and suited my tastes. I threw soda out the window from the start. I ate six meals a day with healthy snacks and lots of water. I carried a gallon jug of water with me everywhere I went. My lunch every day consisted of a grilled chicken salad, and I started eating dinner with my mom at home rather than ordering fast food or pizza.


The weight started to come off slowly. I saw it first in my face and then in the rest of my body. Every week I took a progress picture. It just gave me more and more encouragement to keep going. Clothes were starting to fit again, and every new piece of clothing I bought was one step closer to better health. I went from a size 56 waist all the way down to a 36. I couldn't even believe they made 36x38 jeans!

Accountability was a great motivator to keep me at the gym. My mom was there to make sure I kept on track, and even my online gamer friends knew about it. I would post updates on a forum or blog and reap in the encouragement they gave me. I also started my own blog, and my family, friends and other weight-loss bloggers keep up with me daily. It keeps my mind focused on my goals knowing that people read about what I do on a daily basis.

Then I found a new love in my life that I never thought would happen: running! Running is my favorite workout; I could go out and hit the pavement and leave all worries at home. I joined the Kent State Running Club at school. I ran a 5K and then a 10K, and then a sprint triathlon, two half-marathons and now 2 full marathons (Disney and Ottawa)

Over this past year I joined the University of Maryland Terps Triathlon team, a long journey from gamer to athlete had been completed. I competed in this past season and just this last week on November 18th, 2012 I completed Ironman Arizona. After a year of training specifically for that race and a little over 2 years from the beginning of my journey I had pushed my body beyond what I ever thought possible. 2.4 mile swim 112 mile bike and a 26.2 mile marathon. As I crossed the finish line I could call myself happy for the first time in a long time.

I am sharing this all with you to hopefully help inspire and to tell everyone to never give up on your dreams, even if it's not endurance sports, work hard and keep working away at your goals and you will get there. Two years ago I couldn't run up the stairs without panting. Today I am an Ironman.

Lowest Weight: **235lb** I gained about 10lb in muscle training for the race. A total Loss of about 140lb from August 2010 until April 2012


Weight Today: **245lb**

**edit: thought I would answer a few questions I got** Things that have changed noticeably since the weight loss other than my body:

1) I fit in chairs (movie theaters, airplanes etc) I am reminded by this every day in every day situations. It is a great feeling to not break those fold-able metal chairs anymore.

2) Love Life

3) Confidence (see #2)

4) I'm now a certified firefighter/EMT in MD

5) My major has changed in school from Computers to Kineseology and trying to help others. The biggest part is I love being around people now where as before I wanted to be a loner and hide from the world.

6) I'm considerably colder in the Winter now and can't just sport the shorts and t-shirt thing. My hands and feet in particular.

7) I still game a little bit as old habits die hard. Add me on xbox live: Uzi507

My weight has always fluctuated, from big to kinda big. So I decided to make a change and stay healthy.

For my Diet I started doing a 1,200 calorie diet. Cutting out some of my favorite foods such as; ""Cheese doodles"" and Chinese food.  I got a bunch of those healthy 100 calorie  snacks and  granola bars.

 I would go to the gym depending on how many times a week I could go. In the summer of last year I went at least 3 times a week. lately I've been going a few times a month. I do workout tapes. Denise Austin is my favorite.  Also just walking to and from work.

Sometimes it's tough, I don't seem to see a change when I look at myself in the mirror, but when I look back at the picture it's all right in front of me and it gets me motivated again.

Now I am at a plateau. I haven't lost any weight since the beginning of April. any hints on what I should do to shed the last 20lbs??

Hi again, R/loseit!

I posted a little over a month ago with some of my progress shots from the beginning of my diet. I am 20 years old, 5'9, female, and my start weight was 230. I'm now at 190. I've got my goal weight set at 160, but I may stop before then. I began my diet last December. 

**You guys were all so supportive and wonderful to me, and many of you asked for me to keep the forum posted**. So, I've taken more progress shots and edited together some great side-by-side comparisons. 

Here's another quick little autobio: 

I began losing weight when I saw a photo of myself and was utterly disgusted at how I looked. I've been battling terrible depression and anxiety since the beginning of my adolescence. I grew up in an abusive home with terrifying parents. **When I began taking anti depressants, I was 13 or so, and just hitting puberty, and my weight ballooned.** 

Ever since, I've been the artsy fat friend. I'm done with that label. It's not who I am, and it's not who I want to be. 

I've always been very physical, even through obesity. I studied kung fu for 7 years, did basketball in high school, and was training to be a junior olympic archer. (I'm also a putz, and hurt my legs in sports and then broke both my wrists, so no more archery.. womp womp.) I just couldn't lose the weight. I have a love for cooking and for soda.. that made everything very difficult. **I'm also a very emotional eater.. when I'm depressed or whatever, I binge to make myself feel better.**


Last August, my family and I had a terrible fight. Our relationship is hostile and essentially nonextistent and I have been on my own since. I can't afford school, so I work full time. In a sense, this has helped me because I was suicidal when I was arround them. 

So, my first diet routine was to cut out soda. I lost 5 pounds right off the bat. 

I limited myself to only one serving of foods, and cut out unnecessary snacking. I didn't count calories, but I know what I should and shouldn't be eating so that was helpful. 

**In terms of exercise, I ride my bike, I take walks, and I love to hike. Because in the chesticle department, I am well endowed, I can't run. It's painful as hell. I do a lot of core work- push ups, situps, squats, small free weights. I desperately want a gym membership, but I can't afford one, so I make do with using cans of soup as weights along with other things I find around my apartment.**

I'm really proud of myself for doing this alone. I'm very excited to see what I will look like when I've finished.

It was a question that I could never really wrap my head around. I guess I just didn't really notice. That concept seemed absurd though. How could i not notice that I was rapidly approaching 500lbs? 

It wasn't until I started to really lose some weight, and no one else noticed, that it clicked for me.

Once you reach a certain size...you are just fat. I don't think id be viewed any different if i had reached 650 lbs... I'm still just a fat guy.

I guess its a matter of perspective. If you are 120lbs and you gain 5 pounds, you notice.  If you are 450 and you gain 5lbs you dont have a clue.  Thats why it's so easy to get out of control like i was, and also why it's so hard to maintain the motivation to do something about it.

Its kind of frustrating when you have to tell people that you've been working out. You tell them that you've lost almost 100lbs and they say ""Really?!?!?"" before they catch themselves, and follow up with an obligatory ""Oh yeah, I can tell. You look good!"" 

Even though I see the number on the scale dropping along with the number of Xs on my shirt tag, I still at times doubt that I have actually changed as much as I know i have.  Since I avoided pictures at all cost, I really had nothing to compare to until today when I found my passport...

I'm 5'10, 23 years old, and I started off at 225 pounds. Last time I managed to weigh myself, last month, I was 175, but I've lost inches since then, so it's likely I've lost a bit more weight too. My starting measurements were 46-36-46, and now I'm down to 38-29.5-39, so I've basically lost at least 7 inches in my circumference this year!

I started lurking on loseit last year, and seeing people just like me achieving such great things really kick started my journey. I decided to make working out a priority, and committed to doing it every 2 days at least. I use the TRX (suspension training), which basically uses your body weight for strength training. I use it at home, which means no excuses not to do it; it's really helped me keep it up. I took the advice ""eat less, move more"" to heart, and while I don't count calories, I do eat significantly smaller portions, and less junk food overall. 

I've still got a bit more to lose, probably around 10-15 pounds, but these are more vanity pounds off my stomach and thighs than anything. I'm basically at a healthy BMI (1-2 pounds over last time I checked), and I'm starting to feel good about my body. 

I hope this manages to inspire someone.

I downloaded myfitnesspal, and set it to 1200 calories a day. I tried to stick around that number, but if I went over because I went out to dinner or something I wouldn't really sweat it.

Even though I still have ten pounds to lose, and can pinch a good layer of chub on my tummy, it has lost that pregnant/beer gut protruding look.

I never really thought about where on/in my body I carried and stored my fat before this process.  For some reason, I felt like I was a skinny person inside a layer of blubber.  I now realize that while some of the fat was directly under my skin, there was also a lot of intramuscular fat as well as fat in my core and organs.

I feel that I have now lost most of that core/organ fat. Despite the floppy/jiggly bits that remain, my stomach has a more toned/defined look and feel to it.  This has really become noticeable to me over the past month.

And then it hit me. I HAD PACKED MY INTERNAL ORGANS FULL OF FAT.  and I was like 'holy shit, that is BAD news"".  I never had body image issues before I started losing weight.  And, I was always healthy (low BP, cholesterol, etc).  But wow, I was not being kind to my body.  And now that all of that excess weight is gone, my body is so much happier and so am I.

I found this thought terrifying.  Like the difference between wearing a fat suit that you can simply shed versus having the fat invade every cell in your body.  I always felt like the former, but now I realize that I was wrong.  I never want to do that to my insides ever again.

Maybe some of you realize this already.  I feel like this entire process is like emerging from a very dark room into the sunlight and my eyes are slowly adjusting to the scene, little glimpses at a time.  I was always slightly curious about how some people (men especially) got that ""beer gut"" look.  They didn't seem exceptionally jiggly or blubbery and now I think I realize that they are probably storing much of their fat and excess weight in their core and around their organs.  For whatever reason, that thought is just horrifying to me from a health perspective.

I'm Simon, a 23 year old from Portland OR. 

As a young kid I was always very active, but around 4th grade I just stopped moving. 
I'm not sure why it happened, but no amount of encouragement from my family got me interested in exercise. I started sneaking food and finding excuses to stay home instead of going out with friends. 
Through middle and high school I was frequently picked on by my peers for my weight. Even more disheartening was that as I grew towards adulthood my close friends didn't seem to respect me the way they did my fellow peers. 

I feel that a lot of the perceived slights are projections of my own insecurities, but the loneliness and depression were co-morbid with my overeating and sloth. 
About 10 months ago I decided I needed a change. 
I'd quick smoking on January 10, 2011 (the second best decision of my life) and my lungs were clearing up nicely. 

On August 2, 2011 I bought a bike and stopped driving to work. 
My commute was 2.5 miles downhill to work. For anyone familiar with bikes, this is barely a warmup. For my first two weeks riding, it nearly broke me.
At my heaviest I weighed 320lbs. 

I now weigh 184-188 depending on time of day and how much water I consume. 
I'm not adjusted to being a normal size but I LOVE looking at myself in full length mirrors. 
I want to let anyone who is struggling with weight know that your weight is not a battle, or a war.
It's a part of who you are. 

When I stick to an 1800 calorie diet filled with fruits and veggies and lean meats and egg whites and nuts and cottage cheese and brown rice (my main foods) I'm *not* sacrificing.

**I did not count calories or use any specific diet method. 
For me losing weight is about changing one's life from passive to active.**

**tl;dr - Used to weigh 320. Started exercising &amp; eating better; lost 130**

**EDIT: 4.18.2012 3:50PM**

Thanks for the congrats and support reddit! 

@Mattmouth &amp; MommaJo: Do it! When I started I hated running, felt fat and slow! So I took up cycling until my heart and lungs were in better shape. Find the activity that makes you feel awesome and center your life around it for the next few months! 

Whatever physical activity makes your endorphines will be your best friend. If you mix in body weight &amp; resistance training your gains will be much greater! Muscle size affects metabolism in a big way. More muscle = more energy burned at rest = less restrictive diet &amp; more energy!

**EDIT 6:35PM**

I truly didn't realize how important sharing my success could be! Thanks to everyone for the karma and kind words!

I've gotten quite a few message asking for exercise and diet details. I'm planning on replying to each and every message, but wanted to share with everyone.

Details:
I find time to do some activity literally every day. Even on the two days I was sick this winter I went for some walks in our fine Portland rain. This **doesn't** mean I work out every day. I've adjusted my mental approach to exercise, and now believe that getting my heart rate elevated for at least 10-15 minutes in the morning is key to my happiness.

From August through October I rode my bike 6-12 miles per day and did some basic weight training with dumbells and body weight resistance. I changed my approach to food, looking at it purely as fuel for my future. I took pictures of what I ate and read ingredient lists like a hawk. I didn't count calories, but tried to be very aware of what kind of calories I was consuming. If I needed a sugar rush I'd walk a few miles to the store and back and buy a cookie. 

From November through February I was living further from work, aproximately 6.5 miles. The ride became increasingly tough during the wet winter months, but again the positives of exercise will always win out once your body gets moving. **Inertia and Momentum are properties of weight loss in more than a physical sense! Once you start exercising it's hard to stop!**

I now live and work in a different location, but still bike or run every day. I eat very well with a heavy emphasis on lean proteins. My breakfast is often a 25G protein shake with a non-fat low-sugar yogurt and granola. *High fibre, high protein, low fat, low carb will always be successful* Lunch is a whole grains and veggies and meat. Dinner is more of the same. I eat lots of snacks, generally almonds or low sugar granola bars.

My story:
I have been losing weight for over a year. It all started with a competition at the office to see who could lose the most weight. The two top ""losers"" received $100 each and the first team of ""losers"" received a free vacation day. Holla! It was so much fun to be able to see what people were going to do to lose weight. The beginning of the competition I was at 240 and by the time it was over I was 215. The competition lasted for 3 months. I did not start off by going on a strict diet. I changed what I ate. I watched closely on what I was putting in my mouth. I stopped eating out so much(which saved me a lot of money) and started cooking more and eating more veggies and fruits and less chocolate(i love chocolate!) I ended up being the second ""biggest loser"" and my team came in first place with ""losing"" It was such a great experience! I recommend a competition for anyone who works with a bunch of people who are trying to lose weight. 


Afterwards, I started to plateau. So, I began walking my dog each night for a mile. After a week I started walking him and then walking without him one more mile and then 2 miles(I walk quicker without him) I lost about 15 more pounds just by walking and eating healthier. Then I started counting calories and my walking turned into jogging. Once I started counting calories I ate VERY differently. I eat a LOT of eggs and chicken. I find this is the most filling food for me. I also eat tons of fruit and veggies. I try and stay away from starchy food and if I do eat pasta, potatoes, bread etc. I only eat in moderation (of course).

Losing weight has been a struggle and it has of course been rewarding. I have never been one to be outgoing and confident. But since my weight loss I have noticed myself doing things I normal would not have done (like going to a water park) and standing up for myself in situations I normally wouldn’t have. I have also found it harder to ""give up"" on something that I have started (such as going back to school.if i can lose weight I can finish some courses) I am a more determined person and more of a go getter. 



Anyway, here are some pics of me…

edit:
thank you all for the super positive response! i don't have much to offer as advice or wisdom, and hate to be preachy anyway, but i will say this:

1) it is mind-blowing to me that what i've done here is actually inspiring to other people. well, i know that you are all committed to losing as well, and i want you to really know that when you have reached your goal you will be inspiring to others. having a clear vision in your head of the person you are going to become - the best version of yourself

2) give a shit! really care about yourself and be doing this for you, and how you'll feel physically and emotionally. this is more important than a trainer or strict diet. your attitude will dictate your decisions, portions, etc.

3) consistency is the most important thing ever. you don't have to be dripping sweat at the gym or getting ripped - just show up. show up every day. make it a habit and make it something you need to do to feel happy that day. even if you're just redditing on your phone on a cardio machine, BE THERE FOR YOURSELF! same goes for dieting/eating healthily in general. the more days in a row you are ON, the more your results and metabolism will kick ass.

Wall of text:
I never thought I was really overweight in high school. At 5'8'' I weighed between 160-165 for most of high school. I danced regularly and was generally active. I went to college and of course packed on the freshman pounds... Found myself around 185 when I graduated. Following a messy breakup at the end of college coupled with a job I worked around the clock I had become sedentary so here comes August of 2011 and I'm 23 years old and close to 200 lbs. I got a new job and moved to Boston, joined a gym and my free trainer appointment revealed that I was just over 200lbs and my BMI had me at obese. F THAT! I started working out and lost about 10lbs, but that stagnated. Then January 2012 rolls around and I find you lovely people and all I hear is COUNT CALORIES, its 80% diet, its so simple. So I begrudgingly start entering things on MFP and what do you know... I LOST WEIGHT! 

For the last 8 months I have tried to keep my calories around 1200/day, and I do a variety of yoga, pilates, strength conditioning, zumba, and step classes to a point where I work out in some form about 8 hours a week. I have come to LOVE the gym because my classes are just downright fun and while I initially planned to get to 165 again, once I hit it I decided to keep on trucking. I went from a size 12 in high school, to a size 14 at my worst, to current... I am a size 4! YEP a 4!!! So I have hit my goal and would like to work on fitness goals and lose about 10 more (I'm fighting with that stubborn stomach fat!) and the best part is everything in my life is better. My boyfriend and I are as happy and strong as we have ever been, and for once I'm really happy with myself. 

TL:DR Diet and exercise, who knew?

EDIT: Thank you all so much for your support and kind words. For those telling me this inspired them, I am both deeply happy and humbled by that. It was this community that gave me the courage to dive in seeing that normal people CAN DO THIS! Seriously, you guys change lives.

I am 25 years old 5'9 Male, When I first started this transformation I was 300 pounds and right now I am at 180 about 19% bf
When i first started this journey I was your normal WoW addicted nerd. I would eat a Hot and Ready pizza in one sitting etc.. Then my place of employment installed a small gym with a couple treadmills and an elliptical and a decent amount of free weights.

Finally one day I had enough.. Everyday I worked I would go to the gym for lunch and get 45 minutes of elliptical in and I would stick to eating around 1200 cal's a day. nothing special just oatmeal and chicken some other things but tried to keep a routine. 6 months later and I was down close to 100 pounds. 
right now I just keep my food consistent try and get good amount of protein and just listen to my body. I play Indoor soccer, run a good amount since I have been trying to get a half marathon done for awhile.. Lift weights when I can. Still need to lose about 15 pounds but not sweating it just living life.

Its still a struggle everyday I am not going to lie I have issues with controlling my food intake but I work on it day by day.

6 pack of rolls that is! 

25 Male, started on March 1st 2012, was 512/13 pounds(scale at the recycling center only went in 1lb increments), am currently 412!!! Here is my MS Paint crop of the first photo I took(crappy resolution), and one from yesterday!

I never could tell the difference on how the way I look everyone tells me but I just couldn't see it, but now looking at these two pictures I instantly noticed that my bottom rolls were smaller than the older picture. Definitely a good boost in confidence! Still kicking ass, have been slacking in the gym the past 2 weeks though because I started a new job, still eating healthy and everything of course. Just missing out on the gym.

The job is my first job ever and it is ""killing me"" phsyically to stand all day long, I needed a job and took the first one I could get. I would really enjoy a computer related job so I can use my degree but for now am working at Wal-Mart as an overnight Binner(stocks the backrooms with merchandise/overstock).

I am goin out to hang out with some friends, if this kicks off at all I will ask any questions that people may have when I get back. I can't stay up too late tonight because I am having a cheat day/huge fucking party tomorrow to celebrate 100 pounds lost!!! Cheat day as in just alcohol, I will eat healthy still just extra calories from alcohol(liquor not beer of course!!!!).

Edit2: Sorry I didn't get on and post replies last night like I said, I was tired when I got home and had to get rest for today's 100 pound celebration!

Edit3: A lot of people are asking me what all I did, here is a reply to a comment I made explaining everything I can think of. I joined a gym on March 1st, and have been going there on average 3-4 days a week. Last 2 weeks only a couple of times due to getting a new job and the job draining my stamina by standing all day on concrete. But when my body gets use to it and it will, I will be back in the gym 4 days a week along with work. My diet is roughly 1500 calories a day sometimes around 1300. I don't just eat something to hit 1500 each day.

I also have cheat days once a month which are fun and I look forward to everytime! Sometimes I goto Pittsburgh and hit up southside for a night as my cheat day. I don't consume much alcohol anymore like I use too. When I did it was 5000+ calories every Friday/Saturday, mainly because of mix drinks and my tolerance being through the roof on top of Sheetz/Denny's runs after the bar. Cheat days are the shit!

Edit4: I was gonna wait to post and make my comment, finally hit the weight I was at in 7th grade(402) but I figured the 100 pound was badass in itself so I just went ahead and started it up.

Most important EDIT: Thank you all for your comments and love! It really does help me motivate myself more to kick some more ass I really do appreciate it! Not use to strangers being nice to me, just use to them staring and laughing. But this is just badass makes me tear up thinking about it. Because my self confidence is non existing and before I started doing this I always accepted that I was dead before 40 and just not gave a shit and did whatever the fuck I wanted and ate whatever. But here I am after some motivation from two key friends that kept getting on me about getting to the gym, here I am kicking ass and taking names! And I wanted to thank everyone for all the love, I also didn't think upvoting all these comments would take so long haha but I am trying!

1. First thing in the morning drink some water. Then for  the rest the day lots of water. AND NO SODA!!!
2. At least 2 protein shakes a day. Especially one within 30min after a workout. 
3. 1hr of cardio usually 45min when I get there and 15min before I go. With about 30min of weight lifting in between.  I did this 6 days a week for the most weight loss. now down to 3 or 4 days a week. 
4. When not at the gym stay active. Find some hobbies that require you to move. I play disc golf all the time. It is free at most courses and the people are usually really cool.
5. Portion control is a must. It sucks at first, but over time I swear my stomach has got smaller. I can't eat nearly as much as I used to without being in pain. Just have to make the lifestyle change.
6. Have a free day once a week where you don't workout and eat what you want just don't overeat everything. 
7. Don't give up. Even when you slip up you just have to keep going. It's not going to be easy, but it is definitely worth the sacrifice. ",,False,,t5_2rz8w,True,,,True,t3_ilbh0,http://www.reddit.com/r/loseit/comments/ilbh0/this_is_me_about_9_years_ago_at_about_320_pounds/,

Anyway, fair is fair. People have been posting progress pictures and showing their faces to the world so I feel it is my turn.

**Before:** http://imgur.com/Nq1vs

**After:** http://imgur.com/Vnnnq

The long story for those who are curious or like to read:

The before picture was taken roughly a year ago, I am 5'11"" and I was at about 250 pounds. Then around Thanksgiving I told myself it was time to lose weight.

I started eating better and while I saw some results, the progress was slow and a bit frustrating. This guy who never exercised before had to start moving more.

Unfortunately I have a bad joint that prevents me from running without excruciating pain (I'm being seen for that) but I can walk just fine. And walking is easy, and free, there are no gym memberships. Besides, I live in Florida so this means I can walk year around if I don't mind putting up with some heat in the summer.

So I started going to a local park near my house that has a path about a mile long. I started walking two laps 3-4 times a week. It would take me 20-25 minutes per mile. Eventually I increased the frequency of my visits, the distance and speed. I currently average 10 miles a day at about 13.5 minutes a mile, every day of the week.

My weight started coming off at about 1-2 pounds a week, and in 8 months (late July/early August) I had lost 70 pounds. I am now down 75 pounds, I have a normal BMI, I no longer snore at night and my blood pressure is textbook perfect.

Since I am at the same park every day, people have started knowing me and it has given me a new outlook on the general public but specially the homeless. There are a lot of homeless people who hang out at that park during the day. Some just wave hello to me and others stop me and want to chat.

The common thread I noticed is that a lot of the homeless people simply want to be acknowledged and treated like fellow human beings. So many people walk by them as if they were invisible. The other day this homeless man ended our conversation with ""thank you so much for talking to me"" and it broke my heart.

I am now looking at volunteer opportunities so that I can do something to help even if it is only in some small way.

Walking and meeting new people is now one of my favorite things to do  and it has shown me that each and everyone of us is fighting some kind of battle.

**TL;DR** I lost 75 lbs walking and we should all be nicer to each other.


**EDIT -** Thank you everyone for the kind words! It's up to each of us to make a difference not just in our lives but in the lives of others. Whether you volunteer, or help someone in need while out and about, or give good advice on LoseIt, you are making the world a little bit better, and just like our weight loss, it adds up to a lot over time.

**EDIT 2 -** Thanks again, I do not know what to say. My apologies for saying ""in the way"" as opposed to ""on the way"".  I'm not a native English speaker and I do make grammatical mistakes from time to time. I realized what I had typed as soon as I submitted the post. As for those who cannot do a lot of exercise due to health issues, injuries or the cost of a gym membership, listen to your body, talk to a doctor, and if given the all clear go walk! That is all it takes. You will burn a similar amount of calories as running, the trade-off is that it takes longer. And yes, a lot of you have guessed where I walk.

I watched my weight grow steadily for the past 7 years (~210 to 300). In September of last year, my brother asked me to be his best man at his wedding.  Over christmas, my brother casually mentioned to me that I should lose a few pounds before the event.  That was the closest anyone in my family has ever come to calling me fat.

When I got home, I decided to dust off the old scale and step on it... 300 pounds!  I managed to gain 20 pounds since March of 2011.  That was December 29th, 2011.  I hopped on reddit, found /r/loseit and started with the FAQ.  I filled up my disused water pitcher and emptied out the 6 2 liters of regular coke in my fridge.  I started counting calories with my fitness pal, but quickly went to keeping a mental log.  My original goal was 50 pounds, with a stretch of 75 pounds by the wedding (September 2012).

My primary mode of exercise was walking to and from work (4 miles round-trip) every day.  On weekends, I'd pick a direction and start walking.  I'd usually put in between 6 and 8 miles walking around various neighborhoods.  If I wanted a loaf of bread, I had to walk 3 miles (up hill, both ways) to the bakery to get it.  I kept to a roughly 1200-1500 calorie diet.  Most of my cheat days were spent in the bar drinking hard liquor instead of beer.

Various non-scale victories:
- People do a double take when they look at my license when checking my id.
- I no longer have to worry about fitting into booths at restaurants.  (I actually had to move once because my gut just wouldn't fit.)
- I'm no longer confused with another overweight (former) co-worker.
- I used to consume 1000 calories to ""recharge"" after exerting myself physically.  Now I just have a glass of water.
- Clothes fit.
- The energy.
 
I'm currently at 189.2 pounds with a new goal of 175 pounds.  I know I should start lifting weights, but I'm lacking motivation.  Maybe another family member will see this and point out what a weakling I am.

Edit: Thanks for all the nice words and advice.  A guy couldn't ask for a nicer group of strangers on the internet.

A little while ago [I posted](http://www.reddit.com/r/loseit/comments/1a7hbf/so_i_lost_100lb_and_it_made_a_slight_difference/) after I had a sudden realisation about the change to my face after losing 100lb (45kg). The response was pretty crazy and I promised I’d do a follow up post once I hit my next goal as people had questions! Apologies in advance for the wall of text … I’m happy to answer any other questions if you’ve got ‘em, too. 
  
  
So, first things first – [**current face and body progress pictures**](http://imgur.com/bBnVMIt). The before photos are from late 2009/early 2010, and the ‘during’ (not after!) photos are current. 
  
**Weight stats:**

*Mid 2009* – 272.9lb / 123.8kg (this was the highest weight I ever saw on a scale, but it could easily have been higher at some point after this)

*September 2010* – 242.7lb / 110.1kg (at this point I made the decision to lose weight and actively started making changes)

*January 2011* – 215.4lb / 97.7kg (for the next two years I kept losing, but stopped paying as much attention as I had been)

*January 1, 2013* – 187.2lb / 84.9kg (resolution time!)

*May 20, 2013* – 161.2lb / 73.1kg
  
**My story:**

My family have always had terrible eating habits (fatty food and lots of them) and were never very physically active. I was a fat baby, a skinny pre-schooler and then a fat child and teenager. I competed in a low-impact sport for years but kept piling on the weight as the amount of food I was eating was incredible and most of it wasn’t healthy. My favourite lunch was four large pieces of white bread, all slathered with butter, plus a big can of spaghetti and meatballs, with about a third of a block of cheese on top. I would eat that in addition to breakfast, dinner and snacks… crazy. We ate a fair bit of KFC and stuff like that; everything was upsized and full-fat. I always hated the way I looked and knew I was huge, but honestly thought I was too far gone to do anything about it. Needing to lose so much weight just to be in the healthy weight range seemed pretty hopeless and I had pretty much resigned myself to being fat forever.      

When I moved out of home into my own place, a natural change took place as I started shopping for myself and had less money to spend on crap. After about a year I realised I had lost weight (about 30lb / 13kg) and resolved to try and lose more. My strategy involved calorie counting and a bit more physical activity (I was hopelessly unfit). I lost another 37lb / 13kg in about four months and weighed 215.4lb / 97.7kg, and then kind of tapered off.

Over the next two years I made sure it kept going down, albeit a lot less vigilantly than I had initially. I met my partner (he’s reading this now!) and as he lives a fairly healthy, mostly vegetarian lifestyle, it worked well even though I was paying less attention to my weight. I ended up at 187.2lb / 84.9kg on New Year’s Day this year, when I made a resolution to get down to 143.3lb / 65kg.    

This year, I’ve been back to counting calories properly and have been doing a lot more research into the kinds of foods I’m eating. I LOVE food and still have a pretty healthy appetite, so it’s hard, since I want to clear my plate, have dessert and generally eat stuff that tastes good. I’ve been experimenting with intermittent fasting, drinking more water and eating more protein-rich foods and it seems to be working. I’m also enjoying finding ‘skinny’ versions of recipes to try out. I definitely give myself a day or weekend off every now and again, but I find that even then, I don’t go too crazy in terms of portion size or the kinds of foods I choose, so that’s positive. My partner and I also both now eat gluten-free as we’re intolerant, and that’s also helped as it’s harder to choose carb-rich foods, especially when eating out.    

I started the Couch to 5K program about two months ago and, as of today, finished Week 6, Day 2. I’m super proud that I’m not only giving this a go, but sticking to it … I nearly died trying to finish Week 1, Day 1 and totally failed it, so it’s a testament to the program that I can now run 20 minutes without stopping. I’d also like to get into some bodyweight and dumbbell exercises – not sure where to start though. If anyone has suggestions, I’m all ears. Something structured like the C25K program (starts off easy) would work really well for me, if anyone knows of anything like that.    

**FAQ:**     

*What foods have been life changing?* Definitely vegetables. I never ate them much before and didn’t know how ridiculously tasty they could be even when cooked healthily. Also, using Stevia in my coffee and baking has been amazing. 


*Do you have loose skin/stretch marks?* Yeah, I’ve got both. I’m still quite flabby all over, just smaller. I think I look way bigger than what my weight suggests I should look like. My arms, thighs and butt are all a bit droopy in terms of skin but I’m hoping as I build muscle and time goes by that they’ll firm up a bit.


**In summary:**


I guess the point of me writing all this out is to hopefully help someone else who might think they’re ‘too far gone’ to realise that it’s so not true. I love looking at progress photos and reading people’s stories here and it’s definitely helped me along the way this year … hopefully this does the same for you. I’m under no illusions that I’m thin or pretty, but the thing I want to get across is that I feel SO MUCH better about myself because I’m healthier. I have more confidence, don’t want to cry when I look in the mirror, and I’m committed to achieving my goals, which is really exciting and motivates me each day. It also makes it a lot easier to get back on the horse when I fall off occasionally. I definitely reward myself (non-food rewards!) when I hit goals … for example, I just got a second little tattoo as my prize for hitting the 50kg loss. Surrounding yourself with people who will cheer you on is also critical … my partner is so encouraging and supportive, which is amazing. My family are superficially supportive (“You look great!”) but follow that up with piling unhealthy food on my plate even when I’ve specifically asked for small amounts, pooh-poohing things like the gluten-free diet and Stevia, and saying things like “Don’t get too skinny!” when I’m clearly still so far away from that. 


My ultimate goal is to get to 143.3lb / 65kg by the time my partner and I move to London for 12 months in November this year … and then maintain it while we’re away. 


**TL;DR:** Fat girl is getting less fat and more fit. Also, likes herself now. Yay!

I finally hit my goal weight last week so I thought I would post my progress pictures. This is how far keto has taken me with no exercise.

I stayed mostly the same until December of last year when I moved across the country to Seattle.

To go: ~50 more lbs.

I'm 6'6"" so I believe my destined weight is around 260, we'll see. At least it's what I'm aiming for right now.

My loss so far is mainly through low impact cardio, walking on a treadmill mainly, and also doing day hikes around Seattle. I've really curbed my diet, it's still my biggest struggle as I still indulge too much.

I've begun doing basic weights and am hoping to start doing SS in the not too distant future.

Now the rant: They don't really want to know, and neither do some redditors on r/loseit.  Weight loss isn't complicated, but that doesn't mean it's easy.  Burn more than you eat.  Eat less, move more.  Pay attention to what you're putting in your mouth.  It all *sounds* good, but many people seem incredibly resistant to putting it into practice.

My wife has started ""using"" MFP.  I use that term loosely, because she doesn't measure her portions, and at the end of the day when she logs her calories she simply leaves off anything that puts her over her allotted calories for the day.

My buddy called me and asked how I managed my first, rather rapid, weight loss.  I told him it was pretty simple - I cut out sugar, I never ate seconds, I switched from beer to club soda, and I walked 27 holes of golf every week.  ""Well, you know, *wife* does the cooking, so I eat what she serves, and my job is pretty stressful, so I like a few beers to unwind at the end of the day, and I don't play golf...""

A neighbor mentioned that he saw me coming in from my runs every morning as he was getting his paper.  He'd like to run, he said, how did I get into it?  I told him it wasn't complicated, I laced up my shoes, went out my front door, and started running.  ""Oh I can't do that, I couldn't even run a mile.  I've got bad knees.""

Summarizing a spate of recent posts to r/loseit: ""How do you guys lose weight? I'm married/in school and I have a kid/job with weird hours/gig playing mouth harp in a klezmer band.  I have to eat fast food for my job, and by the time I study/take my kid to school, work/go to school and practice/fix dinner, I barely have time to watch 2 hours of tv/play 2 hours of video games/spend 6 hours on reddit.  I'd like to get healthy, but I just don't have the time!""

Here's the bottom line folks:

1) There are no points for good intentions.  The only cheating in weight loss is cheating yourself.  Not logging the calories doesn't make them go away.  Yes it's hard. No, it's not complicated.

2) Of course you have reasons for doing what you're doing right now. We all have reasons for everything we do.  But there is no situation where nothing changes except your weight.  You change first, then your weight changes, not the other way around.

3) If you want to do what we do, you have to do what we did.  There is no magic bullet.  When you act like you think there's some way to lose weight and get healthy other than diet and exercise, it's like you think I'm stupid for doing it the hard way.  There is no hard way, there is no easy way, there is just ""the way"".

4) If you don't want to change anything about your life, why do you want to change your weight?  Whatever your weight is, it's obviously not an impediment to the life you're leading.  If you don't want a different life, you don't need a different you.

I'm sure I'll get downvoted to oblivion for this, but I had to get it off my chest.  I worked my ass off (literally) to be in the shape I'm in, and I know that I have to work even harder to be in the shape I want to be in, and that even when I am I'll have to continue to work to maintain it.  I'm getting a little miffed at the folks that don't want to do any of the things it takes to get in shape, so they keep giving reasons why they can't and asking for ways to lose weight without doing anything, like I'm holding out.  Like if they ask me enough times I'm going to say ""Yeah I was just shitting you with all that diet and exercise stuff. Here's the magic word, say it three times tonight before you go to bed and in the morning you'll have lost 20 pounds.""

TL;DR - It's not enough to want to get in shape, and you're not a bad person if you don't want to do what's required, but there are no shortcuts and I'm not holding out on you so I'd appreciate it if you'd stop devaluing my hard work by acting like there has to be an easier way.",,False,,t5_2rz8w,False,,50lbs,True,t3_19itmy,http://www.reddit.com/r/loseit/comments/19itmy/nsv_and_rant_if_you_keep_doing_what_youve_been/,

[Progress Photo](http://i.imgur.com/nzVJ6)

I inherited [Osteogenesis Imperfecta](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Osteogenesis_imperfecta) from my mother; it is a genetic disease that affects bone metabolism, which results in low-bone density and has lead to many, many fractures over the course of my life. Growing up with brittle bones, I was discouraged from participating in contact sports by physicians and became weary of being very active after having suffered so many breaks. Nevertheless I was a happy child, and found healthy enrichment in music and drama, and not-so-healthy comfort in food.

I learned to be more careful, and had fewer and fewer fractures as I reached early adulthood. My love and studies of music continued, and I planned to pursue music professionally as a singer; exercise was part of the picture. Opera singers have long had a popular reputation for being on the large side, and it has never seemed to dim the careers of exceptionally gifted singers. I was confident in my musicianship and paid no regard to my physical health, beyond avoiding fractures.

[Spring 2009](http://i.imgur.com/WjIpV)

I began my graduate studies in the fall of 2009, and my technique and music making were rapidly humbled. My eyes to the professional world of opera were violently opened, and I became increasingly self-conscious of my vocal faults, and more so my weight. I began to have doubts about my future, which were compounded by a growing unhappiness regarding the quality of the work with my voice teacher at the time. 

By the spring of 2010, I was a very unhappy person. I had a painful sense that I was actively working to place myself further, rather than closer, to my career goals; and I was taking out loans to do so. On top of that, I weighed in at around 250lbs at a height of 5’9”. At the end of the semester I had my final vocal examinations for the year, known as Juries. They were a disaster. I was in a terrible place emotionally, and had no confidence in my waning technique; I received the lowest marks I’d ever been assigned in my musical studies, ever. I was defeated and didn’t know where to turn.

I knew that if I wanted to ever reach my goals, enormous change was needed. I reflected on conversations I had had with peers about voice teachers, and resolved to leave my instructor’s studio. The relationship between student and voice teacher is immensely personal, and is [often not easy to end for either party](http://www.claudiafriedlander.com/the-liberated-voice/2012/06/possessive-teachers.html); I didn’t know where I would go, but I knew I had to start moving.

And move I did; the date is clear in my mind: May 11, 2010, the day after Juries. 

Early in the morning, I turned to the internet for direction on how to finally become happy about my body. I read up about dieting, and decided on a [low-carbohydrate diet](http://code.reddit.com/wiki/help/faqs/keto); the Atkins diet is a popular variant. I committed to do low-carb right there.


I read that High-Intensity Interval Training (HIIT) was an effective means of weight loss, and created a running playlist for intervals of 25-seconds “On” (sprinting) and 90-seconds “Off” (walking). It consisted of the [20th-Century Fox theme](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LTgRm6Qgscc)  over and over, and [verses of Bach chorales and motets](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbHjmvp0ei0). Now I always regarded them as some sort of joke, but I owned a great pair of Brooks running shoes. For reasons which also seemed unknown to me, I owned a pair of running shorts that fit and had an iPod armband.


So I ran; all 250-odd pounds of me. I *sprinted*, huffing and puffing around the campus near my apartment. I ran every day, and I didn’t eat carbs. I got shin splints, and felt horrible pain in my legs. So I read more. I learned that maybe I was being a little too zealous with my exercise, after I had given myself a few days rest, I transitioned to the [Couch-to-5k program.](http://www.c25k.com/)


I spent the summer working as an Area Director for [Johnsonburg Presbyterian Center](http://www.campjburg.org/), pulling 18-hour days, running, walking, wrangling children, swimming, singing, praying, and not eating a carb. By the end of that summer I had lost 48 pounds, discovered a new satisfaction in healthy living, and rediscovered my happiness.

[Fall 2010](http://i.imgur.com/EXz9p)

My journey continued. I [revised my diet](http://examine.com/leangains-faq/) as I reached different short term goals.  I began [running further](http://www.njtrailseries.com/) and [lifting weights](http://startingstrength.wikia.com/wiki/Starting_Strength_Wiki). And just as importantly, I sought out and found a  [wonderful vocal instructor](http://www.claudiafriedlander.com/); I became happy with my direction and music making once more, and continue to work and progress with her today.

As far as numbers go, I’d estimate my highest bodyweight being in the low 250s, and this past summer, I weighed in at my lowest weight of 138.7.


[Here I am at 148](http://i.imgur.com/xvQ8m)

So how does one make changes to their life? 

There are always the general lessons or wisdoms I followed: *It’s never too late to change. Start with small, attainable goals. Don’t sweat the small stuff. Don’t let one small deviation from your plans derail your entire routine. Fitness and health are marathons, not sprints.* We’ve heard many of these so much that we almost forget their significance. 

But there are a couple of other lessons I think have been instrumental in successful personal change.

* Making significant changes to your lifestyle will mean that you give some things up, possibly for good; even some things that you currently find happiness in and maybe even love. **This does not mean have to or you will.** When you give things up like favorite foods, you will eventually find new, healthier favorites. Your palate and preferences will adjust to new habits and you just may become even happier than before. 

* Don’t be too stubborn. Diet and exercise become a religion for some folks, and like religion, there are no points for blind faith. Allow yourself to think critically about your eating, exercise, and time management habits and make changes where you feel it would better suit your goals and progress. At the same time, there are diminishing returns to obsessive scrutiny over your routines.

* [Buy a food scale](http://amzn.com/B005OSUIYG) and [know how to cook](http://amzn.com/0764578650). Any changes you wish to make to your body whether fat loss or muscle gain, are done first in the kitchen and only augmented by exercise. It’s up to you to decide how closely you want to track your food intake, but it is essential that you are at least cognisant of what you are putting in yourself on a week-to-week basis.

Sorry that there are no body pictures from my highest weight. I was quite embarrassed and camera shy and wouldn't allow pictures to be taken of me...just believe me, it wasn't pretty. 


I've been following this /r/ for quite some while now but have never commented or posted. I've finally gotten the courage to share my progress! 
Since I was 12 I've struggled with my weight and had major body image issues. I was always unhappy with how I looked even if I would pretend that I didn't care at times. My highest weight was the summer after I finished the 10th grade. I was around 190 and so unhappy with myself.
I finally had enough so I started to eat healthier and I introduced myself to kickboxing and pilates.
I've had a slow but steady weightloss taking around 2 years (and counting), but I'm happy to say that at around 145lbs, I can finally notice the changes its had on my esteem and overall happiness. 
I'm still not at my ultimate goal weight, which is around 130-135, but I can feel that I'm so close now! It's been hard to work out as much as I'd like to because I've just started college but I've been trying to watch my diet and am continuing to eat healthily. I'll update again when I'm at my ultimate goal weight!

If I can do it, I know you all can!
Thank you /r/ for inspiring me and for keeping me motivated!!

The TLDR of how I did it:

* Cut out all the garbage food I knew I shouldn't be eating. That included fast food, sodas/pops, and processed items

* Replaced the above with complex carbohydrates, lean protein, healthy fats and LOTS AND LOTS OF WATER. *I actually also began cooking and making my own food.. This helped A LOT.*

* Calculated my BMR/TDEE, and tracked calories with My Fitness Pal and weighed my food ACCURATELY.

* Introduced exercise into my life. Whether it's going on a walk a few times a week, lifting, HIIT, sports, running.. Whatever it is.. Do anything.

* Took progress pictures. This was imperative and paramount to my success. **THIS ALLOWED ME TO SEE WHAT MY MIND WOULDN'T LET ME SEE, KEPT ME MOTIVATED AND KEPT ME ON TRACK**

* Didn't give up when I fucked up. And I fucked up lots. It's okay to have a cheat meal or a cheat day and enjoy yourself from time to time. This has to be about a LONG TERM  and SUSTAINABLE lifestyle. This isn't a quick fix. Otherwise, you will gain it all back. 

* This is not about perfection. This is about changing your LIFESTYLE for the future for the better.

If anyone has any questions, comments, or needs help to get on the right track.. PLEASEEEE MESSAGE ME.

**I IMPLORE YOU TO MESSAGE ME. I WILL HELP YOU ACHIEVE YOUR GOALS. I PROMISE.**

**Edit - I should also add that I would be absolutely nowhere without the constant support and amazing friendships I have made through Loseit and MyFitnessPal.

Life is so different now, and better.  Everyone in my life has been super supportive.  Until I got my new job.

My coworkers eat out every day, are obese, and berate me about my choice of lifestyle.  There is one who is pretty vocal.  We'll call her L.  L has told me that the BMI scale is a straight-up lie.  That I am silly for counting calories.  I honestly think she believes that I have an eating disorder.

So today L guesses my weight.  She says I look like I'm 180 pounds.  I'm 164 in actuality.  She is surprised, and says she guessed so high because I have a big ass/thighs.  I told her I used to weigh 260, she says ""that's not that big.""  I show her pictures and she says she doesn't see much a difference between me then and now, and that I looked fine before.  Then she turns to our co-worker, who is at least 220 (more than likely closer to 240), and says she must be 180.  Whaaat.

I've long thought that I didn't look as small as others who are my weight/height.  I look at mybodygallery.com and wonder why I am a size 14 at 164 and 5'7"" while others are a 12, a 10, etc.  I know, I know, I'm a pear, and it will come off as it will.  But when I hear things like what L tells me, it does sit in my head.

**Who am I:**  Female/35/5'6"" current weight=168.8 lbs (76 kilos), starting weight 193 lbs (87 kilos), goal weight 143 lbs (64 kilos). 25 lbs and 23 inches lost since May 30th 2012.  Was a US size 18, now wearing a US 12-14.  body fat = 28% (down from 33%) and   muscle = 36%.  BMI = 27 (down from 30).

**How did I get this way?**  I was always very muscular and fit growing up.  We ate okay in my family, not too much junk food and I never really drank soda.  In high school I was active with running, sports, dance, etc and I weighed in the 130s and was probably a US size 6.  I managed to avoid the freshman 15 after I entered college, but then I started dating my (now) husband and went on birth control pills.  I think when I graduated I was probably around 150 lbs and a US size 10.  Over the next six years, I put on right around 5 lbs a year.  These years were filled with tons of normal life transitions (getting married, buying a house, going to grad school) and although I knew I was getting bigger, it also sort of crept up on me.  We were still really active, lots of hiking and biking and gardening, and for the most part, my food choices only improved over that time period, but I now realize that I was eating too much, even if it was ""healthier"" foods like goat cheese and whole wheat bread.  I weighed 180 lbs about ten years ago when I got pregnant for the first time.  I have spent the better part of the last decade having and raising children.  I lead an active life and eat well.  During this time, my weight has ranged between about 195lbs (weight after having a baby) and 178lbs (after losing all the baby weight).  My vitals have always been great, things like blood pressure, heart rate, etc have always been very healthy.  I could run and play with my kids without feeling fatigued.  My husband has always been very loving and affectionate.  Add to this the fact that I have a very positive view of myself physically and I had *zero* motivation to take any additional steps to lose weight.

**Why did I decide to make a change?** In May of this year my weight was hovering in the 190lb-195lb range.  For my height, this put me just into the obese category for BMI.  In the past, this has always been my ""get serious"" weight.  If I hit this weight, I would tighten up the eating habits and exercise a bit more until I got back into the 180s, but nothing really more than that.  This time was different.  My sister had visited for Memorial Day and she had also recently lost some weight and looked fabulous.  We are the same height and in pictures, it was just so awful.  She is probably in the 120-130 lb range.  I still see myself as that active, fit girl from college, but I lost her in a layer of fat.  I am done having kids, so no more thoughts about losing the weight just to put it right back on keeping me stagnant.  At that same time, my husband had been taking some steps to increase his physical activity and downloaded the Jeff Galloway C25K program.  The evening after my sister left, I went out for a two mile walk.  When I got back in, I posted an ""epic"" status on FB.  I told everyone my current weight and size and stated that I was making a change.  I know that this tends to have an inverse effect on achieving your goals, but I needed some public accountability.

**What have I been doing?**   A friend told my about myfitnesspal.com, and I signed up immediately.  That first day, I ate foods I would normally eat (we live on a farm and eat a lot of fresh veggies and our own meat), just within my caloric allotment, which was 1680 kcal/daily.  It went fine, and I realized I had been eating probably 2500-300 calories more days then not.  I had to remember that I was no longer pregnant or nursing a newborn and I didn't need that many calories a day.  Since that time, I have been steadily shifting to a lower-carb, higher-protein ""diet"".  I try to keep carbs around 100g/day and not go over 150g.  The VAST majority of them are from veggies and fruit, and I have pretty much eliminated refined carbs.  I am trying to get my protein in the 125g range, but am solidly eating 100g of protein/day.  Right now my calories are at 1550 kcal/day and that is just fine with me.  Every day I tell myself that I am NOT on a diet.  I am a healthy person who knows how much to eat for a woman my age and size and that is what I will do every day for the rest of my life.  For the past two weeks, I have not been actively tracking on MFP as a bit of an experiment.  I have worked out some really basic eating habits, go-to meals that I know keep me within my calories.  I have lost 4 lbs over the past two weeks, so it seems okay.  If I start to plateau, I will go back to diligent measuring and tracking.  Fall is just a super busy time for me, and I needed to make something easier in my life.  For exercise, I run for 30 minutes, 3 days/week and then come in and do 30 minutes of yoga, stretches, crunches, etc.  I will run in my first 5K since HS this month.  I am still nursing my youngest.  I have young kids and a farm, so my life is pretty active.  My goal was to lose 1lb/week, and I have slightly surpassed this over the summer.  My big goal was to be at 170 lbs by Labor Day and that morning I weighed in at 169.6, so there you go.  Another big goal was to weigh less than my husband.  When I started he was at 176 lbs, but since he has also been running and we have been eating better in general, he has lost 12 lbs himself and is at 166 lbs and he is 5'9"".  I will probably pass him in the next month, which will be a HUGE NSV for me, since it has been over a decade since I have weighed less than he has.  

**What have I learned?**  I was healthy and happy before losing the weight.  I am MUCH healthier and happier now that I am getting smaller.  It is funny that it really took something ""shallow"" to motivate me (wanting to look better).  I now realize that wanting to look better is not shallow at all.  I love this subreddit and reading everyone's stories and seeing the pictures.  I am just about half-way to my goal and I know I can do this.  You can, too.

I am going out to hike with my kids for a while today, but if anyone has questions, I am more than happy to answer them.  I especially want to reach out to all of the other moms out there.  You can DO THIS.

**TL;DR**-Fat mom is getting skinny by eating less and exercising. I LOVE YOU GUYS!!!!!!!!!!!

The story so far.",739,116,160,http://www.reddit.com/r/loseit/comments/vyiuk/down_166lbs_160_more_to_go_the_story_so_far/,"In January of 2010, I weighed 576 pounds. I was 27 years old on a path to being dead before 40, probably before 35. I had spent the majority of the past 6 years eating myself to death. I had no hopes, no ambitions. I wanted to make enough money to pay my bills and continue living in my parent's basement in NJ forever. Then I bought a scale and realized the extent to which I had allowed myself to fall. One of the things about being massively overweight is that, despite how unimaginable this might be to others who observe us, you don't actually realize how fat you are. From the inside looking out you are still just you, probably because it is such a gradual change, happening over months and years.

Getting the scale lead me to look into low impact exercises I could do, and one of the ones listed that I had loved as a kid was bicycling. Looking back, I wish I had never stopped, but every teenager can't wait to ditch the bike and get a car. I wonder if things would have been any different if I hadn't. Anyway, here is a picture of me when I first got my bike, a tank of a thing from [Worksman Cycles](http://www.worksman.com/):

[At my worst, but on the verge of something better](http://goatbert.com/images/02-24-2010.jpg)

That was taken sometime in late February, or maybe early March of 2010. Right around this time I went to an orientation meeting with Dr. Marc Neff regarding Bariatric surgery. I spent the next 5 months or so dropping 70 lbs and seeing every specialist you can think of to make sure I could survive the surgery I had elected to have, [Vertical Sleeve Gastrectomy](http://www.obesityhelp.com/forums/vsg/about_vertical_sleeve_gastrectomy.html). During this time I went to PAX East 2010 and had a friend take a (blurry) picture of me with Tycho from Penny-Arcade, who I met in the hall randomly outside the BYOC area. I remember being excited to have the picture taken and then very disappointed when I saw how awful it was. I really hope this next PAX East I'll be able to get that picture taken again somehow, but a lot closer to 200 than I will be to 500.

[Meeting Tycho at PAX East 2010](http://goatbert.com/images/JeffandTycho-PAXEast2010.jpeg)

On August 31st, 2010, thanks to the incredible insurance my public school job provided me, I was wheeled into the operating room. The mortality rate for VSG is actually very low - much lower than I remember being told (it is apparently 0.1% at ""Centers of Excellence,"" which I think the hospital I went to was). Regardless, I was terrified of surgery - I had never had so much as an incision before. I wrote letters to all the people I cared about saying all the things I never said. Obviously, things went fine. Over the next 9 months I would go on to lose another 105 lbs. Here is a picture comparing me in May of 2010 to May of 2011, 105lbs down:

[Side By Side: May 2010 to May 2011](http://goatbert.com/images/LosingJeff-5-31-10-to-5-27-11.jpg)

It was a pretty incredible transformation.

In November of 2010, 3 months after the surgery, I was offered a job in Northern Virginia working for a company a friend of mine worked at. He had submitted the resume I had sent him to proof read. In a 2 week period I uprooted my entire life from NJ to VA. Things continued going well as far as weight loss for a while, eventually getting to my (current) low of 372 lbs in November of last year. Then the holidays and winter happened. Holidays are a tough thing because it sends me right back into that enabling environment where the problems started. I love my family, and they would do anything to support me - except stop buying junk food. And I should certainly be able to resist the temptation. The problem for me is the temptation is coupled with an overwhelming feeling of inevitability - I start to feel like I'm just lying to myself and I'll never escape that fate, that I'll end up fat and alone in a basement in a nowhere town again.

So then I made my way (slowly) back up to where I was a few weeks ago, 428 lbs. Then I decided I was tired of missing out on things. Not being able to ride a roller coaster in 10 years. Relationships that never coalesced. Fitting into a plane seat but not well enough to not be anxious the whole time. Little things I'm sure I'm forgetting but that pile up year after year. Just life in general. I wasted what some say is supposed to be the best decade of my life by being fat, sad, and lonely for 6+ years of it. No more.

So as of last Wednesday I joined a Crossfit gym - Monday, Thursdays, and Saturdays I'll be doing that. I'll also be trying to bike every single day. As long as it isn't raining or snowing, I'll be out on that bike. I want to beat my personal record for miles in a month (which I set last month, 92.6 miles). In fact, I don't just want to beat it - I want to destroy it. We'll see how I do. I've set some short term goals (410, which I hit this morning, now 399, then 375, then 350, etc. etc.) as well as a long term goal. As I write this, it is 263 days until the rumored date for PAX East (3/22/13, 263 days from when I'm writing this). I am going to stick a countdown clock on my wall, and I have a Perl script outputting the countdown to my desktop on my Mac and a gadget on my Windows 7 desktops doing the same thing. In 263 days I will see the friends I only get to see in person once a year, but whom I game with everyday. I want to walk up to them and see the look on their face as they try to figure out who the hell I am. In terms of actual numbers, for now I'm just saying ""under 300."" As I get closer, we'll figure out if I can get even further.

As far as diet goes, I've found the most success with keto, so I will be doing it again. It is only when I start to forget myself and say things like, oh I can have one cookie, one slice of pizza won't hurt me, that keto goes down the drain for me. I think the steps I am taking to constantly remind myself of my goals will help me avoid that this time. I've also been having great success with intermittent fasting - trying 16/8 or 20/4. I think it is easier for me because my hunger is already reduced as a result of the surgery. Non-fasting days I start with a 48g protein shake (ON Extreme Milk Chocolate Flavor) and a few supplements - iron-free multivitamin, calcium, magnesium, 2 teaspoons of Fish Oil. Sometimes I do eggs and bacon instead of the shake, depending on what I feel like, and move the shake later. Lunch is usually cheese and deli meat rolled up, or a burger (no bun, with mayo/mustard/bacon/jalapeños). Dinner is often home made tacos minus the shells, with avocado chunks, sour cream, and cheese. I try to avoid snacking, but if I must, it is usually more lunchmeat/cheese rolls or tuna/mayo/sriracha mixed up.

I'm going to try to use reddit as the place I post updates and for community support. I have a blog, [Losing Jeff](http://losingjeff.com) where I post updates sometimes, but I'm really looking for somewhere I can get community feedback. It seems like reddit is the place - if I spend hours reading about the success stories of others, maybe others can find some inspiration from mine as well, and maybe the people here can help keep me accountable. I post updates from [RunKeeper](http://runkeeper.com/user/LosingJeff/profile) (and my Withings scale once I get back under its 396lb limit) to my twitter account as well [LosingJeff](http://twitter.com/losingjeff).

I've been thinking about posting this for a long time, I'm glad I'm finally doing it.

I'm sure I've got a bit of the ol' fat-guy-camera-angle thing going on, but still, that's night and day.

I had a gastric bypass on June 27th of this year, and in the 6 months since, I've lost over 150lbs. The eating restrictions and the lifestyle change is both the hardest and best thing that I've ever done, and I cannot be happier with the results so far. My goal weight is around 220-240lbs, so I'd have to lose another 150-ish to get there. At the rate things are going, it'll happen before the one-year mark rolls around, as I've not really even started on exercise routines. I've a friend from high school who is a personal trainer locally who's offered to give me a discount if I get some sessions with her, so I'm saving that for a bit further into the new year, but I've got the money set aside for that.

If I have one piece of advice to give people looking at this and thinking about getting a gastric bypass, it's this: DO YOUR RESEARCH. It is absolutely NOT a walk in the park, it's not easy, it's not quick, it's not easy, it's not without risk, it's not easy, there's recovery time, it's not easy, there will be things that you cannot eat anymore, it's NOT easy, there will be things you can't DO anymore, it's not EASY, there will be severe consequences if you stray from the lifestyle changes that you need to make, and **IT'S. NOT. EASY.**

I can't:
* Eat until 30 minutes after I've taken my last sip of liquid
* drink until 30 minutes after I've taken my last bite of food
* eat more than half a cup of food in one sitting
* eat any kind of beef, ever, because the fibers won't break down enough and will clog my new stomach
* eat faster than taking one bite every 5-8 minutes
* eat fried potatoes of any kind, ever
* drink anything carbonated, ever

I have to:
* take a sip of water at least once every 5 minutes, to stave off dehydration
* take 2 TUMS Ultra every day for the rest of my life
* take a chewable multi-vitamin every day for the rest of my life
* take an iron supplement every day for the rest of my life
* take a b complex vitamin every day for the rest of my life
* take a b-12 sublingual tablet every 2 weeks for the rest of my life
* get 100-120g of protein every day for the rest of my life.

There's also a fun little thing that people who have the surgery can get if they eat sugar, called ""Dumping Syndrome,"" that's not nearly as pleasant as it sounds. I'm incredibly lucky that I am not affected by this.

Again, if you're thinking of getting a gastric bypass, do the research. It's not a be-all end-all for obesity. It is not a ""get out of being fat free!"" card. It is a TOOL to HELP you lose weight. It will not do the work for you.

I’m 33 and up until june 25th, I weighted 390 pounds. Yep. A lot of me. I was very sedentary and ate like shit. Mostly Ps. No, not peas, that’s green and good for you. I mean pizza, pasta, poutine and a lot of pepsi, more than 2L a day. Oh boy. 

Like most overweight people, I always thought of doing something about it, but never actually tried. « It’s too hard » I would tell myself. « I’m happy anyway » I would lie. Truth is it wasn't ok. Small physical activities were way harder than they should have been. Going out became a chore. Shopping for food implied going to a few places as to avoid the humiliation of putting so much shit on the counter at once. Anyway, I could go on, but you get the picture.

Last month I finally got tired of it. 
I don’t like anything organic except for a few things. Texture is a big issue. So smoothies are (literally) a life saver. So is MyFitnessPal. Holy shit is that thing useful. I’m finally using my treadmill as I should and I’m proud to say that after a month of building up the muscles in my legs I've been walking/fast walking/slowly running a 5k everyday for the last three days! I lost a little over 20 pounds in the last month and I’m just getting started. 

So really, what the fuck was I thinking? That it was going to be too hard. That people would make fun of me. That I wouldn't be able to change my nutrition. Well, I stopped drinking pepsi cold turkey and didn't have a sip in a month. No more chocolate bars, no more chips. My blender is my new best friend. And the other people? All smiles and encouragement. 

This isn't (just) a bragging post. I’m trying to say that it’s much easier than I thought it would be. The stories posted around here helped me realize that and I wanted to add mine to the pile. I still have a long, long way to go, but I’m starting to love myself again.

And you can too.

60 pounds down. 235 to 175.

I don't have a real set weight goal anymore. I just absolutely love working out. I used to hate it but now it's my favorite thing to do. I get bummed out if I can't go for whatever reason.

My advice to others: Make it something you love doing.

Edit because apparently it's not up to standards:

Diet: When I started, I counted calories. I dropped from eating around 2500 to eating 1700. I drank a lot of coffee to keep my appetite under control. But for the past few months I've switched to just eating a proper controlled diet. I learned what is healthy and what is unhealthy. I cook all of my meals, I avoid all things fried, I never use flour or anything similar. I eat a lot of protein and only eat carbs in the form of a fruit or veggie.
It's okay to splurge every once in a while. There's this place that's close to me that serves a sloppy joe / mac and cheese pizza. I had a few slices of that last week and wouldn't ya know it, I didn't gain 60 pounds.
Workout: Run as as long as you can, and then run some more. Cardio is the quickest way to burn calories, period. I started running every single day. I've since dropped it to about ever other day (give or take) and started lifting weights. I've only been doing strength for about 3-4 months.

This is a pretty large milestone for me because it's such a common part of my life now. I'm no longer trying to lose it, I'm just staying healthy.",,False,,t5_2rz8w,1368561785.0,,60lbs,True,t3_1easp8,http://www.reddit.com/r/loseit/comments/1easp8/from_shaving_abs_in_my_belly_hair_to_real_visible/,

EDIT #2 I know I said this in the comments section, but here it is for your convenience: I'm 5'6"" and have always had a bigger build, so according to my doctor 145 is a good place for me. And as for how I did it, I started running a lot, which at first seemed somewhat torturous but I actually grew to really like it! I started out a mixture of walking and jogging for 20 minutes 3 times a week, and as I got in better shape I started to eliminate the walking and going for longer distances. I also added in a weight lifting and core work routine. I live in a dorm that has a gym attached, but when I don't have access to machines I like to do crunches, lunges and planks. (I usually do 3 sets of 30 crunches, 3 sets of 20 lunges, and 2 30 second planks.) it doesn't take very long but it's a good way to keep myself in shape! As for eating, I used to eat a lot of red meat and I really cut down on that. I also have a major sweet tooth and love baking, so I started seeking out healthier desserts to make. I know I cited it in another comment, but [this girl's blog](http://chocolatecoveredkatie.com/) has some amazing recipes!

Granted that's not a full-body shot, but I haven't gotten the photos back yet, this is just a teaser.  But still.  A year ago, my face wasn't defined at all, and I think it looks pretty good here.

I started at about 200 lbs, got down to around 151-153 before I left for the wedding.  Here's there the not-so-good part comes in: I have DEFINITELY gained a significant amount of weight back.  I've been gone for 2 weeks, and during that 2 weeks I ate, ate, ate.  I currently don't know what I weigh, because I want to give it a month of getting back on track before I step on the scale again.  I don't want to get mad at myself because you know what?  It was MY WEDDING (and honeymoon).  Yes, I over-indulged.  Quite a bit.  But I'm not going to be mad at myself about it because it's ok.  I felt beautiful, I had an amazing time, and I let myself eat food I normally don't.  If not then, when, right?

So today is yet another Day 1 - back on the weight loss track after the wedding.  Don't know what my starting weight is, and don't care.  My goal is that by the end of August, I'm back around where I was before the wedding.  My ultimate goal weight is between 130-135.  I would like to hit that by Christmas.

The way I lost the first 48ish pounds was by calorie counting and exercise, mostly cardio.  I love walking, ellipticalling at the gym, riding my bike, and hiking.  Getting back into it I plan on doing HIIT and slowly incorporating more strength training.  Right now I'm around 29% body fat, and after I hit my goal weight I want to start focusing on getting down to around 18-20%.  

Sorry for the long post!  I haven't posted in forever and I feel like I needed to purge it all out a little bit.

I went to a community gym and started walking on the treadmill and doing a little weights, followed by swimming in the pool for 15 minutes. I made sure I did this 5 times a week, taking no more than one day off a row. I limited my calorie intake to 2300 calories, then the next month to 2000 calories. I started increasing resistance in weights, and speeding up my walking to 3:3minute intervals of jogging and walking.

After I lost 50 lbs, I dropped it down to about 1500-1800 calories a day, and integrated super sets into my weight routine. I also joined a yoga class, then a pilates class.

DIET- I drink water, diet soda, and almond milk. Juice has too much sugar, so I just eat fruit and drink water if I have a craving. I still eat chocolate, pizza, ect. I just don't eat as much or as often. I measure EVERYTHING and count calories. My favorite tip is make alot of food in one day (pasta keeps well for a week, or dry salads) and put them in little containers in the fridge, so you can just grab and go.

Hope this pushes anyone who is down. GOODLUCK!

- walking, to the store, to a nearby shopping centre, stuff like that

- when possible (and it's not too hot outside) I use the stairs instead of the elevator

- I use the bicycle whenever possible (in the morning to work, in the evening from work, during the weekends)

- I eat more small things during the day: just an example for a typical day-&gt; a small sandwich as breakfast around 7-8am, some apple or other fruit around 10am, a salad with some form of protein for lunch, again something small - might be another sandwich - around 3pm, and again something I like to eat for dinner - I avoid too much sugar and fat - sorry keto, but I'm afraid of fat ;-)  

- drumming and having fun in general

- lots of water, some tea without sugar

- watermelon, I LOVE watermelon!

**BACKGROUND:** Me and my (now) wife were never fat growing up. We were pretty skinny into our early to mid 20s and could pretty much eat whatever we want. Unfortunately age started to catch up to us and in our mid 20s we continued to eat terrible food, only now it went straight to our guts. By the time we neared 30, I was 260lbs (5'11"") and she was about 210 (5'10"".) A year and half ago we got engaged and decided we wanted to do a destination wedding on the beach. 10 months ago we both realized we didn't want to be a couple of fatties on the beach so we decided to do something about it.

10 months later, on March 27th of this year, I reached my goal of losing 80lbs my wife has lost about 50lbs. She is still working on losing her last 20lbs to reach her goal (I really feel sorry for you ladies. It's so much harder for you than it is for us!)

**TIPS:** 

- Set a specific goal for yourself. Don't just say ""I want to be skinny"" or ""I want to lose some weight,"" set a number and go for it. I found this really helped me as the months went by as there was always an end to my weight loss journey that I could look forward to and work towards.
- Track your calories. Weight loss is at least 80% diet so you need to keep track of exactly what you're eating. Use a site like [MyFitnessPal](http://www.myfitnesspal.com/) or [LoseIt](http://loseit.com/) to track EVERYTHING you eat. Don't just say to yourself ""I'm going to eat healthier!"" because you'll be surprised just how many calories some foods are, even some that you think are healthy. These sites will also set a daily calorie limit for you based on your starting weight, goal weight and plan. Stay under your daily calorie limit and you will start to see results in no time.

- Avoid cheat days for at least a month or two. This one may not apply to everyone but I'm going to put it out there anyways. I had tried unsuccessfully in the past to lose weight by eating healthier 6 days a week and then cheating on Sunday. The problem I found was that after a cheat day, the first day of getting back into my routine was always very difficult. Soon I would start cheating a little on Monday too, which turned into me cheating on Tuesday, which turned into me cheating on Wednesday... Try to go at least a month without cheating once and I assure you it will get easier to both maintain your plan and cheat without falling into a downward spiral.

- When you do cheat, don't blow your whole week's calories. Halfway through my weight loss I hit a plateau. Trying to break through it, I began closing analyzing my calories. I realized that while I was staying under my limit during the week, creating a calorie deficit of about 600 to 800 calories, I was going over my limit by anywhere from 1000 to 1500 calories on my cheat days. I was basically erasing all the hard work I had done all week in a single day of cheating.

- Ease yourself into it. Don't try to do everything all at once as you will quickly burn out and give up. In my previous failed attempts to lose weight I always started off thinking I was going to completely change my life overnight. I would stop eating everything I enjoyed, stopped drinking all alcohol and would start trying to work out everyday. This time around I focused only on staying under my calories each day and I didn't even start working out until 4 months later after I had already lost over 40 lbs. When I began, I was eating 2200 calories a day (my limit set automatically by loseit.com.) I was still drinking 1 beer a day after work, still putting sugar and cream in my coffee and still eating things like rice and pasta. Over time as I lost weight, loseit.com would automatically adjust my calories. When this happened I was also forced to start cutting things out but I did it at a much more gradual pace. First I switched my coffee from 2 cream/2 sugar to only 2 milk. Then I stopped drinking the beer. Eventually I was down to about 1400 calories a day but I wasn't struggling to maintain it.

- Expect to be hungry for a little while but embrace the hunger. For the first 4 to 6 weeks, I was pretty hungry for most of the day. Instead of getting mad or upset about it, I told myself it was my body trying to trick me into eating. My body was now eating itself instead and it was angry. Every time I got hungry, I just pictured the pounds falling off of me. It might seem stupid but it really helped me get through the first month, which I can assure you will be the toughest. Also, try to eat on a regular schedule. This will train your body to know when to expect food and help prevent you from getting hungry in between meals.


Something I learned having lost the weight is that it was a lot harder and took a lot more time to actually put it on. 10 months of a little discipline and hard work changed my life and if I can do it (a super lazy guy who loved fried fatty foods and sweets,) then anyone can do it.

Currently 203 lbs and 13.9% bf

First I would like to say thank you to this Sub for always providing motivation and stories about great progress. Keep it up everyone!

My story goes like this, I have always been a big kid and last Feb, 2011, I decided to do something about it. It started with the second picture above. I was at a new years party to ring in 2011 and a couple of days later the pictures were posted online. I could not believe how big I looked. I knew that something had to change. It took awhile to get started, but by the beginning of February, I was going strong.

I played football in high school, and I was also on the track and field team, so I have never been a stranger to the weight room. I had been lifting off and on throughout college, but had never stuck to a strict program. January 2011 I started a strict lifting program. However, after that first month I knew it would not be enough. I had to start doing cardio.

Cardio was not my friend at first, I hated it. I knew if I was going to lose the weight I would have to do it. After starting to do an hour of cardio every other day in Feb 2011, I slowly started to see results. By the end of that Feb I had lost 10 lbs.

Next was Diet. After the initial 10 lbs I knew that I was still eating too much. I did a bunch of research online and came to the conclusion that the only thing I needed to focus on was eating less than my BMR, while continuing to work out. Over time this has morphed into different types of diets, as I started to get healthier. I was on keto for a long time, and currently I am doing paleo.

In the first semester I lost just over 40 lbs. That was just over 3 months. Since then I have slowly lost more and more. There have been times that I have gained weight, but I have always gotten back on the horse. 

It has taken a long time but this has only proved to me that anything is possible with enough perseverance and effort. 

I started running distance when I was around 240, and since starting I have done 4 10Ks and a 9 mile run. I am going to be running my first half marathon in November, so I am currently training for that. 

I still strength train 4-5 days a week and run every other day. My goals now are to finish my half marathon in November under 2:10 or under a 10min/mile pace, and to try and get below 10% bf. 

Edit: So after looking around in /r/fitness, /r/leangains, and some time on google, I am definitely not 14% bf.

Da basics: I'm 22 years old and stand just a smidge over 5' tall, which makes any weight gain/loss pretty dramatic. Throughout the past 4.5 years in university, I've fluctuated between 110-150lbs: and on both ends of the spectrum felt discouraged. I cyclicly tried cleanses and fasts, looking for an easy way out, and was left feeling either: 
*thin but physically exhausted, or,
*fat and unmotivated

Not a great tactic, that's for sure. The past 6 months have been healthier, as I've incorporate skateboarding and riding my bike into my day-to-day schedule, and building meals around a vegetable/legume instead of simple carbs! This perspective completely refashioned my diet; as a vegetarian it's waaay too easy for me to overload on carbohydrates and dairy rather than protein and mono-saturated fats (lezbehonest, bread and cheese/tortillas and cheese/any carb with cheese= bomb). And since I live in California with the luxury of year-round local produce, there's no excuse to not have fresh fruits/veg on hand when hunger strikes!! 

Stats:
starting weight: 145 lbs 

at present: 121 lbs

working towards: the abs of a (victorias secret) angel! haha, really though, I'm aiming for more muscle definition on my petite frame, and whatever weight goes along with it.

Whenever I see a post on Reddit making fun of fat people, there will be the usual immature comments. Then someone will say something like, ""Hey we're doing them a favor! Maybe if we show them how disgusting they are they'll actually do something about it!"" and others will agree.

No. That's not how it works. You should know that. Every time I'm made fun of, I'm crushed. My self-esteem is destroyed. I think, what's the point? They never just say ""fat"". They say gross, disgusting, or even ugly. So I assume I'm all of those things. I eat a gallon of ice cream or a whole pizza and take some sleeping pills.

It was only when I realized that I'M A GOD DAMN PERSON WORTHY OF RESPECT that I decided to respect myself. With that respect came wanting to lose the weight. Down from 300 to 260, and still working.

So get over your bullshit justifications. If there's a fat person alive who this actually helps, then I'm glad. But I will never, ever stand by the belief that mocking someone inspires them. You are a person, fat or not. Don't let others mistreat you under the guise of concern.

My entire life, weight was never an issue. I was always active &amp; never had to be worried about anything - I was petite &amp; a rail for so long....and then I became an adult. I'm not sure anything could have prepared me for the reality that is adulthood - learning how to cook and what to cook and when going out to eat (which I was doing a TON of) is not always a good thing, and that drinking two beers with a meal isn't a healthy choice....I mean, just DUH kind of stuff.

After I got married my weight really grew (sorry hubs) and I let myself get to a higher weight that I ever had before. So of course, I hit my breaking point &amp; I went looking for the answer - the weight loss holy grail, if you will. 

I joined a gym, and I got on diet pills, and I got shots, and I did ALL of it - which did nothing. I was essentially starving myself because the pills gave me no appetite which my body didn't like so I just sat in this weird 5-10 pound rage for about a year. 

Then I heard about a study at our local university - and I decided to sign up - essentially its a 16 week program where you have contact with 3 different types of doctors for different things - a nutritionist, a psychologist, and a CPT (she also had some form of special degree in this but I cannot remember her credentials) To participate you must  have a high BMI, want to lose weight, &amp; be able to attend 1 meeting a week.

So I qualified. And I went and they took all these measurements &amp; I filled out a questionare and all of this was just amazing and kind of motivating...but then, I had to wait. The program didn't start for another 2 months. And they said ""Don't do anything different, we don't want to have to re-do your starting numbers...""

So that was hard, waiting for this program to start but I made it! And we began. And you guys, this program was the most amazing thing I have ever done. Sure, it was hard to show up to a room full of strangers &amp; discuss why we were all fat &amp; what our bad habits were - but as the meetings went on, I learned to love them. We learned all about positive thinking, and social triggers. We learned how to eat out smart, and how to say no! We learned that working out didn't have to mean pumping iron for hours on end - it could just mean adding 10 more minutes of walking in our day. 

**We basically learned that being healthy doesn't happen over night. There are no quick fixes. Your effort = your results.**

So I know that was long &amp; somewhat silly to read - but as simple as my class sounds - it changed my life. And if ANYONE has ANY questions or would like to learn about ANY of the things we learned - I would be happy to share with everyone!

Also, before I get to my weight loss details - I just really would like the stress how important it is for any young person to get their health under control. Being in an open study, I was surrounded by all sorts of people - but I was the youngest. And it scared the hell out of me listening to everyone talk about their health problems c/o their weight. And yes, at the end of the 16 weeks a lot had good reports of lower blood pressure etc  - but I just still hope that someone hears me, get it under control when you are young, if you can! Tomorrow isn't always going to be the best time to start, now is!

My eating habits have changed so much, it is insane.
I eat clean now, no processed food. I cook almost every night - and if I don't have time then I boil an egg, slice a tomato, and throw it over some greens....I've also learned that if you fail to prepare - prepare to fail. Literally. No groceries = crappy eating. You just HAVE to do it &amp; you HAVE to be wise. Shop AROUND the store - you don't need a damn thing in those aisles - except maybe coffee :) - just try it one time, you'll be surprised! Oh, and quit drinking soda. Just do it, those things really were holding me back!

As for my working out - I began small - 30 minutes of treadmill maybe - and now it is not uncommon for me to be at the gym for 1.5-2 hours - I love being there, I love sweating, I just love knowing I am changing myself, one step at a time! 

I started at 188
And I now sit around 163-167 depending on what I've been up to the day before.

I'd like to drop another 25 pounds just to get my BMI to a zone I know my body needs to be as healthy as possible.

Anyways, thanks for reading. I know this is longwinded but I am so happy to share &amp; I look forward to chatting with you guys or answering any questions at all! Happy Monday!

To my surprise the scale read 293. I was as close as I had ever been to 300. Quite scary actually. 

I completely changed my diet. I went from having a breakfast burrito for breakfast, carls jr for lunch, an after work meal, dinner, and lots of soda &amp; snacks throughout the day. To having salads and much less fatty and sugary foods/snacks. I've also completely cut out all beer and liquor. 

I've dieted before, lost 10-15 pounds, only to regain them and then some over time. 

I've been playing softball once a week for a few years now. Running has always been my nemesis. It was hard to run to first without sucking wind like a fish out of water. My goal wasn't so much a set amount of pounds. My goal was to be able to run around the bases without feeling like I needed an oxygen tank at every base. 

After the first 20 pounds I felt better, more energy, running around the outfield with much greater ease and less fatigue. I joined two additional softball teams, and started using my dusty gym membership I'd been paying for for about 2 years (and hardly using). I went from needing to call a pinch runner, to being one of the people that gets called to pinch run. 

I've been steady at 226 for the past couple of weeks. The # isn't my goal. I feel better than I've felt in quite a long time. I weigh less than I have since probably just after high school (12 years ago)

I didn't take a before picture. But I did find a picture on my moms camera from Christmas 2011. I'm not sure how much I weighed in this picture. Given it was smack in the middle of the holiday season, I could very well have been at 300 or more.

I'd say the only thing it's missing is perhaps a few diagrams for the more awkward or complicated exercises, but for those of you who either don't have access to a gym, weights, or simply don't like the gym, these exercises are a great way to mix things up and get those muscles moving. Cardio is always #1 with weight loss*, but once you start losing, it's good to firm up those muscles that'll you'll be able to flaunt soon!

As with anything, be careful and don't strain yourself. Not everyone will be able to do all the exercises on this list, so if you can't now, revisit the link when you're feeling stronger and lighter!

To our health!

My highest weight of around 160 was around when I graduated college ([http://imgur.com/a/KuKdh#qO25PL9](http://imgur.com/a/KuKdh#qO25PL9)). Health was the farthest thing from my mind. I NEVER exercised, and I used food to reward myself for pretty much anything. 2AM Jack in the Box trips were pretty normal, and energy drinks seemed like a reasonable substitute for sleep. I was tired all the time, struggled to keep up in my classes, and I had awful anxiety, yet I told myself that spending all of my time studying would be the answer. I was only fooling myself...I had zero self confidence in any aspect of my life, and I used being fat as an excuse to be sad all the time and hide away from the world.


Blahhh sob story over! My formerly-obese sister came home from college and lost about 20 pounds to eating healthy and hot yoga. I found a studio and gave it a shot, going to 20 classes over 30 days, and I loved it. It was hard work, but that post-yoga feeling, that relief after putting in 90 minutes of hard sweat, was magical. 


However, I still wasn’t paying attention to the food I ate, and this rather unfortunate photo was taken of me:

[http://imgur.com/a/KuKdh#wBKpJOf](http://imgur.com/a/KuKdh#wBKpJOf)

I stepped it up a notch and started running three miles a day on top of the yoga. I felt great, but still wasn’t seeing results ([http://imgur.com/a/KuKdh#vTKm1om](http://imgur.com/a/KuKdh#vTKm1om)) so I started using Myfitnesspal to track calories, which suggested 1200 calories a day for fastest weight loss. That photograph made quite an impression on me, so I figured, why not? And that’s what made all the difference. I was seriously limiting myself from my previous eating habits, so I had to make a conscious decision about everything I ate. 200 calories can leave you full and satisfied, or still hungry, your choice. It really helped me internalize that food is for fuel. “Calorie” is a unit of energy! Healthy eating made so much more sense once that clicked. Two months of that lead me here: [http://imgur.com/a/KuKdh#rJzPgRf](http://imgur.com/a/KuKdh#rJzPgRf)


Then I got a job that uses free food to keep its employees happy, which includes cookies, cake, bagels, chips, pasta, energy drinks, DELICIOUSFOOD galore, but also a pretty extensive salad bar for lunch. Not trying to hate on free food or anything...and I guess I should thank them for giving my willpower such a great workout every day. I never really *enjoyed* vegetables, but I figured that it was a good time to start. It was a slow process, but I finally learned to separate my emotions from food. I stopped being so strict about my diet and indulged when I felt like it, but always got back on track. That consistency was key. I wasn’t really losing weight anymore, but I wasn’t gaining it either, and reminding myself of that helped me stay motivated long enough to build good habits, in the big picture at least. Here’s the end of this phase: 
[http://imgur.com/a/KuKdh#4mOi1rj](http://imgur.com/a/KuKdh#4mOi1rj)


Finally, I discovered the world of health and fitness Instagram accounts about six months ago, which has made the biggest difference in my life and mindset so far. So much motivation and information at my fingertips! I’ve introduced interval and strength training (that is to say, VARIETY!) into my exercise regime. I even completed a round of Insanity, which completely restructured my body. My diet now focuses on clean eating and macronutrient ratios rather than calorie count. I try to eat mostly vegetables, sticking to natural, whole foods whenever possible, and I’m working to cut out sugar, wheat, dairy, and processed foods. I try to drink a gallon of water a day, and have five or six cups of green tea. Most importantly, I listen to my body. If I *need* a cookie, I’ll have it, but I recognize when cravings are emotional and when my body is telling me it needs energy.

What you came for NSFW: [Before 235lbs ish](http://imgur.com/rdNS38r) [Most recent 180lbs ish](http://i.imgur.com/YhnNIYQh.jpg) and [trousers that I wore in Jan](http://imgur.com/yaYWnFv)

Details: I am 5’9” (175cm) female and I started at 235lbs (106kg) in January this year. My current weight is 177lbs (80kg) I originally wanted to get down to 165lbs (75kg) but I have since decided that I would like to see what I look like at 147lbs (66.5kg) (because it is my favourite number and supposedly my ideal BMI)  and hopefully be able to maintain at 150-155lbs (68-70kg)

How I am doing it: I have cut down on carbs and have been counting calories with MFP (my username on there is Nueth if you would like to add me!) I started jogging and then found out about zombies, run! and have been working my way through the 5k app they have. I also found that one of my co-workers used to be a personal trainer and he took me to the gym in our office and gave me a weightlifting routine which I try to do twice a week. I also have been doing ceroc on Thursdays and I avoided chocolate and sweets for lent and from Jan- shrove Tuesday.
The one thing that has changed my life the most though is my fitbit. I love it, nothing else encourages me to keep going more than knowing exactly how many steps I have done and how close I am to my goal. Also the competition against other members of my family who have a fitbit is brilliant!

Problems: I switched scales about a month ago and my weight has consistently been 5lbs higher on the new scales (an aria that syncs with fitbit.com) compared to my old ones. 

What I suggest: Keep setting mini-goals! I aim to be able to wear shorts in August and not have my thighs rubbing, and for July I aim to be able to jog the full length of my usual route, and to have over half of my 5 mile weekend route as a jog/run. Reward yourself with non-food items (I love shopping and will be getting a new jewellery box soon, though I wish I had rewarded myself with a cleaner for my house) and keep reading r/loseit. Seriously you guys are amazing! 

Finally, I am looking for a workout buddy in North/North-East London, or someone who is willing to whatsapp or text with me daily to compare workouts and to reach our goals. If there is a someone in London who is willing to join me for a workout I am currently jogging (pathetically) and I would love to do squats, walking lunges etc.etc. with someone who can tell me how far off my form is. If you would be willing to whatsapp with me just let me know and I will add you!

Exactly 1 year ago today I was tipping the scale at an unbelievable 305 lbs. I could not wrap my mind around the idea of how I had let my weight get this bad. Enough was enough. It was now time for a change.

My first day I decided to go on a hike with a buddy of mine, whoa that was a mistake. After only a quarter mile, I was exhausted and felt that I was going to have a heart attack. I realized this was going to be a long road and that I'd have to take my time and slowly progress towards my goal. My first step was to start cutting back on junk food. In those first 30 days I lost about 12 lbs. 

Around this time I learned that my police department was going to begin hiring detention officers. In my mind I thought this would be awesome if I could you use that as motivation to continue to lose weight. Naturally I applied and decided to step up my efforts. That's when I came across My Fitness Pal. I began to track my calories and start walking in the afternoons. Right away I noticed a steady decline in my weight, but I was still feeling hungry a lot of the time. After looking more closely at my diet I realized how much carbs I was eating compared to protein. That's when I was introduced into r/keto. 

Man!! The idea of eating fatty foods for weight loss seemed too good to be true, but it worked. I found myself feeling full throughout the day. Hell, there were even times when I felt I was eating too much and struggled to meet my caloric needs. That lead me to stumbling onto fasting. I decided to give that a try. This lead to the realization that you don't have to eat simply because you normally eat at a certain time. While starting a weekly 24hr fast I taught myself that it was okay to feel hungry. Many times our minds just tricks us into feeling that way. I would drink a glass of water and feel completely fine.

Fast forward a couple months and I had lost an additional 20lbs. I was feeling more comfortable with my weight so I decided to hit that trail again. My buddy I had went with previously was surprised I was able to complete the trail and was so motivated to want to continue on a daily basis. Soon I was lifting weights daily and hiking every other day. I continued this up until around January of 2013. 

By this time I had already had two oral boards for the detention officer position I had applied for and was now down to 213 lbs.One of the Sgts was thoroughly impressed with my progression so he recommended I meet with our departments fitness expert. After explaining to him what I had been doing for the past 8 months he could not believe it. He administered some test and found my cardio was shit, so he told me to start running. So I gave up weightlifting and started doing more cardio. (I didn't want to over train since I was not replacing my calories burned in MFP). 2 months later I met with him, weighing 25 lbs lighter. Once again he was floored by my progress. He admitted he didn't believe I could progress as quickly I did and told me he could not recall the last time he knew someone with so much passion to want to improve their fitness. This is when it hit me, ""Wow I'm actually doing this"".

Since then I've been sticking to regular routine of running and tracking my calories. Unfortunately the academy class I was scheduled to be a part of has been postponed until January 2014. However I'm  not fretting over that. As of today I have lost 130+lbs am scheduled to test for 2 different agencies to become a police officer recruit. I still have a ways to go. My next goal is to cut to 160 using intermittent fasting and taking up weight lifting again along with running.

Also just to note I would have an occasional cheat day about every 2 or 3 weeks. However after each one I felt like shit, and would just follow it by a 24 hour fast. 
Some recommended supplements BCAAs, Fish oil, multi vitamins, CLA and caffeine.
Another tip set yourself a goal and just constantly remind of yourself of ""WHY?"" you're doing it

 I started mid August just really counting calories and limiting carbs. This week marks my 20th week. I aim to eat 1200 calories a day, and some days I go over. I've learned through this process though that going over sometimes is ok, and to not give up. I now do some basic easy cardio, although a big thing for me is I've recently jogged a 1/2 mile straight! That's huge for me, I've been overweight since I was around 5 years old and I've certainly never been athletic.
 Probably the best part about this whole process is that I've motivated others unintentionally, including my mother. I work with a lot of overweight people and they've become more conscious of their daily food choices and lifestyle. I'm ultimately doing this for me, but it's nice to think my discipline can positively influence others!

One year ago, my husband was weighing in at 180ish lbs at 5'9"".  He was coaching our son's soccer team and having a hard time keeping up with the kids on the field.  He downloaded the Jeff Galloway C25K program for his iPhone.  He told me he wanted to start running.

At the time I was 5'6"" and 193lbs.  We have both always been very active (hiking, farming, generally active lives) and have eaten well.  We just ate *too much* and didn't exercise enough (you can read more about my backstory [here in a previous post](http://www.reddit.com/r/loseit/comments/ze1vj/fat_mom_got_smaller_over_the_summer_pics_included/).

We started eating much less (typical day for me is greek yogurt for breakfast, cheese stick/almonds as a snack, salad for lunch, another snack, salad for dinner, popcorn, water and coffee to drink) and exercising much more (C25K plus yoga/body weight exercises).  As of this morning he weighs 152lbs (about 25lbs lost) and I weigh 148lbs (45lbs lost).  He is now fully in maintenance mode and still running, but eating his full TDEE.  I counted calories rigidly for the first three months (summer 2012) but have found that eating in a fairly regimented way has worked for me and I have continued to lose all year long.  I eat about 1600/kcal during the week and am a bit more relaxed on the weekends, but compensate with increased workouts if I go significantly over.  I would like to lose maybe 5-10lbs more but I am just going to continue to eat the way I have been eating and exercising.  I will get there eventually.

**Here is what I have learned:**

1.  Doing this together has been amazing but also hard.  Before this I had been eating the same amount of food as my husband.  Since I am shorter than he is and a woman (thus less muscle mass) I can't do that if I want to be smaller than he is.  Realizing this was huge.  No more ""splitting"".  We now break things in half, he takes a bite of mine, and we are both happier ;)  I have weighed more than he has for a very long time and now I don't and it feels incredible.  The weight fell off of him and it took much more effort for me.  Oh well.  Such is life.  I had to let go of any negative feelings about that very quickly.  It is harder for most women to lose weight than for most men.  But, you can totally do it.  Don't let that be an excuse.

2.  We were thankfully both very healthy and happy before.  Now we are HEALTHIER and HAPPIER.  It is so worth it.

3. The sex is UH-MAAAAZ-ING.  People talk about why they decide to lose weight.  For me it was to look better.  For him it was to be able to run around with the kids.  For some it is about getting healthier.  I swear, they should just market it about the incredibly improved sex you will be having.  I think that is the best selling point of all and may even be the key to lasting success.  We are stronger, leaner, and have better stamina.  What could be better than that?

4. The easiest way for me to lose the weight was to cut way down on the carbs.  But, I think the KEY is finding something that works FOR YOU that you can maintain FOREVER and go with that.  Everyone has a different body and a different life and what worked for me might not work for someone else.  I think knowing that this is a life change and not just a ""diet"" is very important.  You have to find a way to eat and exercise that you can see do for the long haul.

Long story short: fully changed diet to keto-style concoction of my own design back in April 2012 and started running back in October. As of yesterday, I've lost 100 lbs, 12 pant sizes, and 4 shirt sizes.

There's still a lot of work to be done to get firm and lose the loose skin, but I feel fucking amazing, found a great girl, and basically changed my life. I did it thanks in large part to /r/loseit. Thanks to everyone here for the support: you're all funking awesome.

Edit: Thanks for the love, guys! Here's some of the other details to answer common questions:

DIET

I started by simply counting calories with MyFitnessPal. I then learned about keto / slow carb, and I started that, slowly adapting my own diet style.

My diet has been and is now effectively the slow carb diet. Only proteins, cruciferous vegetables, and beans. Breakfast every morning is 2 whole, organic eggs and about 100g of turkey kilbassa with cayenne pepper for my 30g+ of protein. Sashimi has become my main ""treat"" during the week. I don't eat any starches (potatoes, pasta, bread, etc.) or sugars, I drink no calories, and I don't drink alcohol. I allow myself 1 cheat day a week where I can do any of that as much as I want.

Right now, I'm doing slow carb with a daily limit of 1450 cals, 6 days a week. That's it.

EXERCISE

Very little in terms of serious working out. Running on a track or around the city / stair climbing in my apartment for 30 -60 minutes at least three times a week plus lots of walking wherever and whenever I could.

I started this journey on Feb 9 at 372. My first 6 weeks I did a regular low fat diet with 4 days cardio(walking) and 4 days weights. I always have 1 complete off day. The next 4.5 months were spent doing Keto with a weekly refeed(anything I want). Training remained the same with some jogging. Standard split in the weight room with no squats and lightly deadlifting once every 3 weeks. Nine months in I started a modified SL routine. Diet turned to TKD. I'd take in 25g carbs before workout and 50g after. I did cardio on the 3 off days in the morning. On Thanksgiving I switched to a standard diet again to see what the carbs can do for me. When I started I wore a size 50 pants. Now Im at a size 34. Routine now is a standard bodybuilding split 4 days a week. Two 5 mile runs a week and one long run upping 1 mile each week till I hit marathon distance. 12 miles this week. I take in app. 3kCals a day and make sure I get 300g of protein a day. Around March 1, I was at 191 and felt weak and looked sickly. Couldn't stand it. Enter more calories and a higher intensity in the gym and I got to 212. Personally look and feel so much better.

The fact is: when you're very overweight, getting started with exercise is difficult. I'm not talking about walking, but jogging, running, weights, even cardio like yoga or pilates which is my main activity.

It seems a lot of people get discouraged because they'll take a beginner class and find it's too hard. Or they don't understand why they just aren't picking things up really fast. And then they quit, because they think they're a failure, or just not good enough to be able to get into fitness.

It's taken me the entirety of the 6months of my journey so far for me to be able to complete a 35 minute yoga/pilates class at my gym on a regular basis. I do this activity because of a back injury which occurred 6 months ago, leaving me with sciatica. That sounds pathetic, but for me it's wonderful - I can really see how my back's strength, and my flexibility have improved. 

I recently did a life fit test for VO2 - and got a rating that was extremely poor - even after losing 40lbs. A bit sad, but I know that 6 months ago it was even worse, and that I have improved.

The way I described it in a different thread was that being very overweight, when coming to fitness, makes you a ""pre-beginner"". Beginner classes assume you are generally healthy. Of course you probably won't complete the beginner class when you're starting out with a BMI of 30-35+


So basically, for pre-beginners to fitness: it's not just you! It's so normal it's not even funny. You just have to keep with it, and make sure you keep track of the small improvements in your body's physical abilities. Don't expect to be personal-trainer fit in a year's time. Just do your best, and know that your best is good enough. As long as you keep doing your best, you'll find that your best does in fact get better with time, patience, and hard work

1358736015.0,591,self.loseit,16yr4l,Update: 1.5 weeks since getting 12lbs of excess skin removed on my arms and stomach. [NSFW],739,148,115,http://www.reddit.com/r/loseit/comments/16yr4l/update_15_weeks_since_getting_12lbs_of_excess/,"I got a lot of PMs and comments about my last post and people were thanking me for being so honest and open about this extra skin issue. It seems like a lot of people may have to get skin removed on their arms or stomach in the future and they are really nervous or just curious about what it's like so I figured I'd give an update again.

It was really frustrating losing all that weight and *still* feeling and looking fat. My abdominal wall had been stretched and loosened from when I was nearly 450lbs and I had a ridiculous amount of loose, hanging skin. I kind of lost my motivation after that. I couldn't work out because I was getting bad skin infections in the folds and I didn't even want to work out because it was like, ""What the fuck is the point?"" Everything jiggled and I had extra bulk under my clothes that I hid with loose clothes.

Well, it's been 11 days since my surgeries and I can say that I've gotten my motivation back. This is how it's looking [now](http://imgur.com/eaDwVra) and without the compression garment on [NSFW] [here](http://imgur.com//GtB0Tga). Swelling will go down fully in about 5 more weeks.

EDIT: I've gotten some PMs already from women asking about my boobs and the weight loss. Even at 450lbs, I only had C cups and throughout all this, they've only deflated maybe a half cup size. I got really lucky that I didn't have a huge chest to begin with so they've held up rather well. It'll always vary person to person but I imagine if I'd had big boobs initially, a breast lift or augmentation might've been needed.

From [before](http://i.imgur.com/UGntj.jpg), also [this](http://imgur.com/bodWOGj).

And when I was [SUPER FAT](http://imgur.com/B6MErRT).

**EDIT AGAIN**: Here are my arms today, Jan. 22. Healing is getting better, finally! [picture](http://imgur.com/9oH7EJv) compared to the first day after surgery [here](http://i.imgur.com/5pA26.jpg).

I can't wait until I'm healed (about 6 more weeks) and I can start slowly working out again without worrying about nasty skin infections or jiggling a crazy amount.

***If*** *you think you might need to have one or a few of these corrective procedures done in the future, you might be interested in this stuff:*

Recovery wise, I stopped taking the pain pills 4 days after surgery. I was able to drive and make very small errand runs at a week out. I moved really slow and walked hunched over but every day I see improvement. My abdominal wall has been tightened and it will be a few more weeks before I can take really deep breaths again. For now I still get winded walking up the driveway, walking through Walgreens or even taking a shower and putting on clothes.

I could shower, completely dry my incisions off with a blow dryer, put my compression garments on and dress myself by 4 days out. My mom had to help with the blow dryer and getting my clothes on for the first few days since I couldn't bend or twist much.

I had my two drains removed a week after my surgery. Apparently this isn't too common. The doctor said most patients get their drains out after two weeks (if you ever need an abdominoplasty/tummy tuck/corset trunkplasty, that's good to keep in mind).

I still cannot bend over and pick something up off the ground but I can squat down a bit and grab things on low tables or chairs that way (I am kind of tall though).

I can't sleep on my side yet. Sleeping on my back is really getting annoying. I have new back pain for now but I know once I heal, it'll get better.

Because the brachioplasty incisions go from my elbow to my lower armpit, it's definitely the most annoying part of healing overall. It's hard to keep them constantly dry and my arm incision rubs against the armpit incision so they are really painful and sore. I can't stretch my arms too far in any outward direction still either but it's only a week and a half post op and my doctor said it's the hardest part to heal because of the location. I use a blow dryer on cool to dry them and apply antibiotic ointment and iodine swabs for now. It helps for a very short amount of time but it's really been the most painful and frustrating part of this whole thing.

The scars going down the middle of my torso and across my pubic line from hip to hip are healing great and they aren't a problem at all.

When it comes to sneezing and coughing, I won't do it. I sneezed 3 days out and I nearly passed out from the pain. If you get an abdominoplasty, tummy tuck or corset trunkplasty, they will tighten your abdominal wall. You can literally feel the stitches when you move, cough, sneeze, twist/turn too far, etc. It gets better every day but I imagine it'll be at least 3 more weeks before I can fully cough or sneeze and not want to die.

**That's it so far.** The procedures are serious business but it hasn't been so unbearable that I was in chronic agony the first few days and seriously, every day gets a little bit easier.

As you can see, I really like to show off my new guns. 

What I've done: food-wise - mindful eating. Smaller portions, more fruits and veggies, less junk food. I don't count calories, but I watch what I eat and make a conscious effort to eat either healthier, or in much smaller quantities. It was difficult at first, but it isn't really a problem anymore. My stomach gets very full very easily now that I've shrunk it down substantially. 

Exercise-wise: I love my TRX. I know there's a few of you TRX-ers out there, and it's my main exercise. I love how much muscle I've put on. I also love going for long (at least 8km) walks, and riding my bike when the weather cooperates. 

I'd like to lose a bit more weight, maybe another 10 pounds, but I'm finally feeling good about the skin I'm in.

The double chin, the deer in the headlights look, the nervous pulling of the finger that means ""hurry up and take the gd photo!"".

That was 4 years ago.  I stayed at that weight for 3 more years before moving to Los Angeles.  It wasn't the culture shock of LA that caused my weight gain - it was stress.  I started a job that I was not a good fit for, moved to a noisy, scary neighborhood and had no friends to go out for meals with.  The weight came off slowly until I noticed and then realized ""Hey! I CAN lose weight"".

Since January I have been maintaining a 1200 calorie diet, running 3 miles a day 4 times a week and otherwise reaping the rewards of my success.  I'm 158 now, 2 pounds lower than my initial goal weight. I've decided to stop trying for weight loss now and to shift my focus to building fitness and let the weight find it's own level.  I have a 10K in April and am hoping (praying, willing) to be able to run a half marathon by the end of the year.

**Edit** - 

Didn't follow any fad diets just ate healthy.


Morning - Oatmeal


Lunch - Soup + Apple + Snack a Jacks (a nice flavoured rice cake)


Mid Afternoon - Fruit + Go ahead bar and a nice cup of tea =)


Dinner - Meat and veg then natural yoghurt with some strawberries/raspberries or other sweeter fruits.

Friday evening is my treat night and I have a treat. Nothing to big but a treat like my favourite bowl of cereal (that's quite high in everything) or anything that's not really bad for you, but enough so that it's still a treat. And once a month I have a takeaway as a treat. Obviously I allow for specials occasions where I eat anything I want like birthdays or Christmas etc.Really it's just a case of learning to be able to have a treat, then stop. It's not easy but get's easier.


And in terms of exercise all I did was really treadmill workout. I'd start off at a slow pace (9) and slowly increase my speed 0.1 every minute until I got to 10. When I first started I could barley run for more than four minutes. Now depending on speed I can probably run for about an hour if I really wanted to but I just stick to about 3-5miles. Now I like to add some strength and condition. I do pull-ups and crunches/planks/seals and sometimes a bit of rowing but people like different exercises so it's a bit personal preference.

I am officially out of the ""Overweight"" category for my height. For the first time in my entire life I am not obese or overweight, and I've never been so excited!

How I did it:

I started on November 14th, 2011, and decided to curb my calories to 1200, and have been eating around there ever since. I try to eat under 50g carbs a day, but ultimately I try to stay under 100g. I cut out most sugar, but sometimes I want kettlecorn or pie, and this diet wouldn't be sustainable if I cut everything I enjoyed out of my life. I eat as much protein as possible, as it keeps me really full, and if I feel hungry (especially if I just ate maybe an hour or so ago) I have a big cup of tea of coffee. 

In January I added a 25 pound kettlebell, and started swinging that around, and once that got easy I moved up to a 35 pound KB, and have been using that ever since. I've gone from 3 ""girly"" knees on the floor push ups, to 42 real ones. And I've gone from a size 12 to a size 4-6!

Lately I've been tired of just lifting 35 pounds, and joined a gym yesterday, and found out that I can squat 115, bench 75, and ALMOST do a pull up, and for the first time EVER someone called me ""fit"".

During this entire time, I have done ZERO cardio. 

Unfortunately I have a shitty camera, so a lot of these pics are not very good, but they got everything across just fine, I think. 

My ultimate end goal is 125-130 lbs, and the ability to do at least 5 pull ups.

Started by evaluating my diet very closely and systematically formulated my route to success through much trial and error. 
Caloric deficit of about 500-600 calories a day was used for the fat loss while cycling carbohydrate intake to maximize the speed of losing. Usual daily intake was around 1800 calories a day but sometimes dipped as low as 1400 on some non-training days.

Workouts were Resitance training on a 4 day split with one day of rest after each 4 day split, 60 min HIIT cardio on off days, 40 min HIIT cardio on training days, and 20-30 min of HIIT cardio on leg days.

I absolutely never thought I would lose weight. I used to look at pictures of thin, pretty girls on Tumblr and think ""I could never take a picture like that."" I used to think I'd always get sweaty from trying to pull on my jeans right after a shower. I thought I'd always be wasting 30-50 dollars a week on my binging habit. I thought the only way I could lose weight was succumbing to the pro-anorexia online community, but even that was beyond my lacking willpower.

But I can run a mile, I can run an entire damn mile. In ten minutes. And I can wear size medium tee shirts. I can count calories mentally, and without feeling like it's taking over my life. I can cook healthy meals. I don't mind talking to people about my weight, because it's just a variable in my life, a number, not an embarrassing state.

I'm 5'1, started at 200, am now 148.6. My goal is 105-125 (I want to do some serious muscle building so it's more of a look than a specific weight).

A frequent question people ask is how often you weigh in.  Most people suggest once a week because of ups and downs.  I weigh myself every morning when I wake up, in my skivvies, after the morning BM.  And I've been recording it in a spreadsheet since November (Nov 15-28th I did not, but after that, every day). 

[The Graph](http://imgur.com/HrB6kVx)

I wanted to share this so you can see what weight loss looks like, literally.  Every few days I go up, then down, then up then down.  I even labeled the reasons why for some of the bigger slip-ups.  I hope that this inspires some of you not to worry too much about the day-to-day weight but to keep focused on the long run.

How I did it: Literally I track everything I eat.  At the start it was calorie deficits only.  But now I go to the gym every single day (or almost every day) for cardio and weight lifting.  But mostly it's the food. On a typical day I have a 1000 calorie deficit or there-abouts.  I try to eat between 900-1500 each day (I'm 5'1"" so I would not recommend under 1200 for the taller redditors out there).  I've pretty much given up carbs in favor of meat and veggies.  Bacon and eggs have been my go-to meal - they're (surprisingly) low calorie and very filling. Carbs, I find, are too easy to eat too many so I've been avoiding them as best I can. 

At the gym I try to do an hour of cardio each day.  Weight lifting is mostly upper body strength oriented with the weight machines (no free weights yet).

What I really like about tracking the weight loss day to day is that I can see the immediate result of the day prior.  It keeps me honest.  I can't pretend I've had a 1000 calorie deficit every day if the weight just isn't budging.  And it makes me immediately accountable for the day prior.",,False,,t5_2rz8w,1369181933.0,,60lbs,True,t3_1eqaaw,http://www.reddit.com/r/loseit/comments/1eqaaw/my_progress_so_far_a_graph_on_what_weight_loss/,

Once I was committed, I made promises to myself to not eat fast food, ever. I've never enjoyed sodas, my guilty pleasure was, and still is, my sweet tooth. I was a poor college student living away from home during this, so cutting down on the amount of food was somewhat easy, it was harder to make sure I was still eating healthy. I started playing full court basketball 5 days a week, and along with my healthy diet, I was able to lose those last 50 pounds.

It isn't working - she simply eats too many calories. 

She tells me I should tell her when to stop eating. I tried a couple of times, but then she gets that really sad look and is really hurt, and I feel like a dick that just told her that she's too fat and shouldn't eat.

It isn't helping either that I'm currently trying to gain muscle and eating at a surplus. It feels even more shitty to tell her to stop eating while I make myself another PBJ Sandwich to get my calories.

We go to the gym 3 times a week together and that works really well. I think her problem is simply too much food. Not even junk food, we buy, cook and and eat rather healthy, she just eats a lot of volume  and is miserable when she's hungry.

I'm rather skinny myself and have little experience with weight loss. Do you have any tips how I could support the woman I love to reach her goals?


EDIT: Ok, so this got way more response that I anticipated, thanks for all the helpfull comments! It's just too many to answer each one. 

Summary what I took away:

- Telling her to stop eating is a bad idea even if she asks me to do it.
- We are now both using MyFitnessPal to track calories better. It will help both of us achieving our (different) weight goals. 
- I will try to make sure there's always low calorie food at home that she likes. 
- I will try to eat my calorie dense food out of her sight.
- I will propose only cooking as much as we will eat. It's a little bit inconveniant because of no leftovers, but she will have no temptation for seconds
- in the end she needs to learn to control herself and there's little I can do to help her do that except stay supportive.",,False,,t5_2rz8w,1366193445.0,,,True,t3_1cgk4s,http://www.reddit.com/r/loseit/comments/1cgk4s/how_can_i_support_my_gf_with_losing_weight/,

Growing up I was bigger than every kid and kept getting fatter year by year.  After finishing my first year of college I noticed i had put on 20 lbs and was up to a total weight of 325 lbs.  I started my diet the July 2, 2010 and by February of 2011 i was down to 205.  It truly was one of the most difficult things I have done.  I told myself I would not grow to be an obese old man and made it my goal to lose 50 lbs.  Once I hit 50 i realized I had transformed my lifestyle completely and continued to lose weight by sticking to my new eating habits and activity level. I was working out 6 days a week for at least 2 hours.  I started by lifting weights only since I was to big to even run a quarter mile.  After a few months a was able to run a mile and continued to build off of that.  My drastic change in what I ate and how much I ate was the key to my success.  I would eat three times a day and never ate past 9 in the evening.  I was only eating vegetables, fruit, chicken, lean beef, eggs, and a few carbs for extra energy during workouts.  
    
I currently weigh around 215, after putting on some muscle mass in hopes to have a beach body for the first time in my life!  I go on a 5 to 6 mile run twice a week as well as 3 days of weight lifting.  I hope this helps some of you trying to get motivated to lose some weight.  One thing that helped me was thinking about my personal well being, I did not do it for anyone else, I did it so i could live a longer healthier life.  One thing that helps is trying to avoid the scale.  Getting on the scale can be very demotivating when you notice your weight has not gone down in a few day.  Lastly, make it a lifestyle and tell yourself you have to do it.  I hope this helps and good luck to everyone!!!!!!

Six months of exercise and calorie counting.,693,116,118,http://www.reddit.com/r/loseit/comments/1h4jy2/down_86_pounds_since_january_six_months_of/,"I realized in January of this year that I was way too fat. So I decided to do something about it. I started out at 274 lbs (6'2). It's no miracle diet or anything, just exercise, eating right, and dedication. My meals mainly consist of chicken salads, and generally very low in carbs. Not sure what else to put here, so here's an [imgur album for those interested!](http://imgur.com/a/zi520#0)


Initially I didn't really do any exercising. After losing 30 lbs strictly from dieting I decided to start exercise. I own a stair stepper, so that's what I used constantly. Basically I started out with the stairstepper 3 days a week for 20 minutes. Then began slowly stepping it up, until getting to the point where I'd do it regularly 6 days a week for 45 minutes.
I recently picked up running and began biking as well. So now I run 5-ish miles a day 5 or 6 days a week. Sometimes running is replaced with biking 20 or 30 miles. And when I have time for neither it's back to the good ol stair-stepper. Seriously, I owe that thing my life considering I've lost 50 or 60 pounds on it.

Food wise I buy tons of lettuce, cheese (I love feta), spinach, peppers (sweet peppers), various types of lite/fat free dressing, croutons, and bacon shavings (not bacon bits, fuck that shit).
Basically I'll throw any mixture of that stuff in a bowl, put some dressing on, and eat it. And that's my salad. Obviously you use logical portions. Not like an entire head of lettuce. Maybe an entire romaine stalk (is it a stalk?). If it's small/medium. And not tons of dressing. Maybe 2 tablespoons. Sometimes I'll just eat one big salad at lunch, and nothing else. Other times I'll have 2 or 3 small salads throughout the day.


For a portion of my losing, the first 30 or 40 pounds, I had done a modified slimfast diet. That really helped actually. I would do a shake for breakfast, a big salad for lunch, and a shake for dinner. No matter how hungry I got I would not eat anything extra. It's a pain, and it sucks, but it's worth it. You're getting more than enough calories out of those three things, so you've had enough for the day. If you can do that for a month, then you can probably do anything I've mentioned.

I owe much of my motivation throughout the cutting process to fitness and this subreddit, so I hope by posting here, I'd help motivate some fellow Loseits.**


First off with the stats: I'm 23 M, roughly 5'10.5, 5'11 on a good day. Although I was always active and lifted, I never really watched my weight. I was always that ""fat kid"". I used to be one of those nay sayers that thought I could never lose weight because it was genetics wah wah wah. Then I told myself ""C_Terror you could cry and be a little bitch, or you could man up and do something about it.""

I found /r/loseit and /r/fitness and basically got started from there. (Seriously, fittit's FAQ is beastly). I ate at a caloric deficit + ate protein at roughly my weight in grams. Myfitnesspal was a godsend.

First the Pictures:

[Before, in June, 215 pounds] (http://imgur.com/vceeJ)

[After, December, 178 pounds] (http://imgur.com/CiAov)

I went from 215 to roughly 178, and my body fat % dropped from 26% to ~13% (used with calipers).

My big three lifts (have herniated my spine twice) 

Bench: ~225 to 325
Deadlifts: ~135 to 365
Squats: ~95 to 275

My Summer routine consisted of:

Monday: 5K run

Tuesday: Back + Biceps
- Deadlifts
- Pullups/Assisted Pullups
- Bent over Rows
- Dumb bell rows
- Hammer Curls
- Preacher Curls
- Ab rollers

Wednesday: 5K run 

Thursday: Chest + Triceps
- Flat barbell bench
- Inclined dumb bell bench
- Dips/Assisted Dips
- Cable crosses
- Tricep pull downs
- Weighted Ab pull downs

Friday: 5K run

Saturday: Rest day

Sunday: Legs + Shoulders
- Squats
- Leg Extensions
- Leg Curls 
- Calf Raises
- OHP
- Clean + Jerk 
- Shrugs
- Sitting Dumbbell Raises
- Ab rollers

Now that it's winter, I go to the gym Sunday - Thursday and spread my workout through 5 days instead of 3 (stopped cardio).

My next steps are to cut down to ~10% BF at 170, and to hit that 1K on the big three lifts. Once I get those, I want to learn how to do muscle ups, human flag, and to dunk. Oh how I'm looking forward to dunking a basketball. 

**EDIT** Many people were asking about my Bench numbers because it seemed unbelievable, here's a copy and paste from one of my comments below:

""My original 1RM on the Bench was 325+ a couple years ago, before I got injured and stopped lifting. The 225 was what my 1RM when I first started cutting.
I kept most of my LBM during my cut (It was a very clean protein heavy cut), so I think it was my muscles getting back to what I was before.
Wasn't too much programming, just kept pushing myself and kept pumping myself up with every new 1RM. Every bench workout is pure total hypertrophy until I can barely bench the bar and I feel like I'm puking. I'm not too sure how much bro science I'm spitting, but that's what worked for me.""

**EDIT v2** Many people are also asking about examples of diet. 

I was extremely strict with my diet in the first month; a typical day was:

Breakfast: 1 cup of Kashi grain cereal (~70 calories), 1 cup of coffee

Lunch: 1 chicken breast seasoned with montreal steak spice + srirarcha and handful of arugula and baby spinach

Mid Afternoon: 2 scoops of protein shake with cold water

Dinner: 10 oz steak with 3 eggs

I'd average ~8-10 cups of water a day.

However, I still live with my parents, and cooking my own food at dinner time, especially in an Asian household wouldn't last. I slowly regressed to eating whatever my mom made (generally pretty healthy) while cutting off the rice. I'd make rough estimations on how much calories each dish was, and in my mind proportion them accordingly. Luckily, my parents were very understanding and didn't give me too much shit for not eating rice. I cook my own food at lunch when I'm at work (also saves a lot of money from going out to buy).

Slowly, my diet regressed to eating whatever the fuck I want as long as I stick to two rules: Meet my Calorie limit + eat my protein (180 grams). I've had a week where I had Mc Gangbangs for lunch for 3 days but still lost  a pound. 

If I'm really craving something (i.e. Fries) I learned a littly trick from /r/loseit, where I would have a couple fries, then eat a fuck ton of vegetables/drink a lot of water, then top it off with a couple more fries. Got my fix, tricked my body into thinking I ate a lot of fries, and caloric damage was negligible. 

**EDIT V3**

Hey, I'd just like to thank you guys for the encouraging comments; Hopefully, if I motivated some of you a tiny fraction of what this subreddit and loseit has done for me, I'm happy.

Well, I guess when you have something to compare, everything gets really obvious. 

So yesterday I went through my wardrobe. I was able take a lot of clothes from the ""too small"" section and put them in the ""can actually wear"" section. As I'm writing, I'm wearing a heavy metal band t-shirt I used to wear in 2005!

Also, I took some clothes from my ""archives - way too large to wear"" section and took some pictures. My head asploded when I saw these.

Extra fact : That orange shirt, I was able to fit my roommate in it with me, and button the top button!

How I got there you ask?

I started with water cardio (aquafit, aquabike, aquajogging) on July 1st 2012. In October, I started an intense HIIT program, twice a week. Added to that, I take a spinning class on Saturdays, and I run 2-3 times a week. Also I eat much better. 

So yeah, all of this is possible in 8 months, just takes some unbreakable motivation.
And support! People on MFP are just the best supporters ever. They mean the world to me.

Now, I want to reach the 100lbs mark. I'll just keep on trucking, since all I do actually work!
This summer I'll be doing 3 runs : Color Run, Color Me Rad, 10km Montreal Marathon.

I apologize for what was likely a strange sight for you this morning. You see, today was the start of Week 4 in my [Couch to 5k](http://www.nhs.uk/Tools/Pages/couch-5K-running-plan.aspx) podcast series, and I nailed it. I've been keeping this podcast thing on the downlow, not wanting to share with friends in case it failed miserably. But over the last 3 weeks I've seen my stamina and skills grow without a thought. I think in the past I've pushed too hard, overthought things and burnt out quickly because of it- giving up before it even got to the point where it actually started to get hard. 

Not today. Today was the first in my life what I exercised for 2 miles, and most of it was jogging instead of walking. I never thought I could do it, because of my sports-related asthma as a kid, the embarrassment of gym class where the mile long fitness run test resulted in only a 3/4 mile and took me 35 minutes. Then smoking and ennui as a college kid, I didn't even think about working out during that time. I didn't even think I could do it last year, when I was walking a mile a day. It just seemed impossible to get over that distance with the shin splints, coupled with back spasms from hours spent waitressing. Then, I quit entirely as life got complicated with 2 moves and 3 jobs within a year. But today I did something I never thought I could. And it wasn't even hard.

I don't pretend to have all answers to fitness or weight loss. but feel free to hit me up with any questions, any time.  Thanks again.  


1st time posting here, someone suggested you might be interested....

Here's me at 210lb's in Oct 2008. http://imgur.com/U9ej2 Overall I was in pretty bad health. Big drinker/smoker, high blood pressure, couldn't run a city block.
Here's me at 152lb's after finishing IRONMAN Arizona http://imgur.com/oo3Bn

The last 4 years were in no way linear and Ironman was never the goal (until last year). This was my progress...

    Jan 2009 Weight loss competition. Diet: Modified 4hr body. Routine:mostly cardio with some machine work. I was working out in a clubhouse gym, so options were limited. Went from 210-180lb in 3 months. Quit smoking

    June 2009 Join a 24hr gym. More resistance training, but a pretty BS routine. Had some strength gains, but also some weight gain as I was still drinking beer daily (8+ easily). Switched from eliptical to treadmill running.

    Feb 2010 First 5k. 33min

    March 2010: Join Lifetime Fitness. Start Spinning 2-3 times/week. Lifting 6 days week.

    Feb 2011 1st 1/2 Marathon 2:0X:XX

    May 2011 Find Fittit. Stop BS'ing in the gym and start lifting. Dropped the curls, calf raises...etc.., added squats, deadlifts, pullups...all the good stuff fittit has taught me.

    Nov 2011 Sign up for IMAZ 2012. Stop drinking during the week.

    Dec 2011 Bought road bike

    Feb 2012 First Marathon 3:5X:XX

    April 2012 First triathlon. 1/2 Ironman 5:3X:XX

    Nov 2012 Ironman Arizona 11:1X:XX

    Advice (for what it's worth)

    Find a diet with food you like. I still eat chicken, eggs, and black beans every day.

    Start doing the big compound lifts

    Interval training works

    You can be an Endurance Athlete on a low carb diet. I did 75% of my IM training on less than 120 carbs/day.

    Stopping drinking really takes off the pounds.

A sincere thanks to you Fittit. Couldn't have done it without you.

1346993062.0,568,self.loseit,zhpb0,"F/32/5'4"" (290 lbs - 175 lbs) Progress.  Pics are X-Posted from r/progresspics",688,120,228,http://www.reddit.com/r/loseit/comments/zhpb0/f3254_290_lbs_175_lbs_progress_pics_are_xposted/,"From a pretty young age, I was a moderately fat kid.  In college, I got *really* lazy (all trees and pizza and no exercise make college kid something, something), and depressed, and broke, and partied too hard, and suddenly, I was a really, *really* fat kid.  I didn't realize how fat until I got on a scale at the doctor and it said 288 pounds.  288 pounds!  Yikes!  At this point I was wearing about size 26/28.  

  Around 2006 I was freaked out enough that I finally met with a nutritionist and started working out and eating much better.  At the time, I was following something akin to weight watchers.  Throughout the next year or so, I lost about 75 pounds and was starting to feel pretty good.  But, lots of aspects of my life got hectic then and I got distracted from my disciplined lifestyle so I hovered around 215 or so for quite a while. 

  Then, a whole lot of things changed in my life very suddenly.   As 2008 neared its end I got divorced, closed a business into which I had put absolutely everything, lost my home, pets, relationship, life savings, purpose, and mind. For a while there, I wasn't doing at all well.  

  Riding the winds of change and lacking a better plan, I ended up halfway across the country in that inevitable post-divorce-bad-idea relationship, flat broke, head still spinning.  By mid 2009 I had regained about 35 pounds.  Most of that was pasta.  Pasta is cheap.

  Eventually, life slowly started improving, as I attended school (again) to forge a new career path, left the stupid relationship, and started the uphill climb.  I made the decision at that time to become a vegetarian for environmental and ethical reasons.  A few pounds trickled off but I wasn't trying very hard and I was often falling prey to the ""carbs and cheese"" vegetarian lifestyle.  I stuck where I was for a while, slowly pulling all the pieces of my life back together, regaining some stability and figuring out who the hell I was now.   

  Over the next year and a half or so, I enjoyed growing success with my new professional direction, and really started feeling like things were going to be just fine, finally.  I started really finding myself.  My new self.  I ditched the dumbass, moved to an awesome city, and found a positively wonderful job.  Things were looking up!  

  In November 2011, inspired by what I was seeing on r/loseit, feeling ready to focus, I committed to finishing what I started and hit the gym again and got my nutrition in order.  

  Still vegetarian, I tried a few variations on diets including calorie counting and vegetarian keto, and tracked absolutely everything on MyFitnessPal.  I read everything I could about health and nutrition and keto and weight loss.  Not only did I start shedding pounds, but my previously symptomatic PCOS basically vanished, my mood stabilized, my energy shot through the roof, and people started noticing.

  Realizing then that I was capable of making major dietary restrictions and sticking to them, I took the plunge in April of 2012 and went fully vegan and mostly organic; something I've wanted to do for several years.  I still work hard to keep carbs, particularly refined carbs, and sugars at a minimum, and to get plenty of vegetable protein.  Vegan high-protein meal replacements and soy products are life savers, and the rest is just about eating whole, nutritious, *real* food.  I feel better than I ever have; I know this is a decision that I'll stick to for life.  

  And here I am now.  As of the date of this post I weigh about 175 pounds and I am a size 12/14.  I would like to lose an additional 45 pounds or so, but I'm no longer in a hurry to do it.  My new lifestyle and the way that my relationship with food has just entirely changed means that I no longer have to see losing weight as a chore.  It just happens, gradually, while I'm enjoying my life and doing what I do.  I go out and have fun and eat some kind of junky stuff sometimes, but I always go back to my same healthful routines and my body continues to feel great and shed pounds.  

  Just a few of the wonderful things that have resulted from this change:

 - I AM FREE!  I no longer feel like I'm trapped inside of a body that hinders me.   

 - My relationship with food is healthy and sustainable and makes my body feel great, but also gives me greater respect for myself because  know that the way I buy and eat food is in alignment with my ethics, and I've just decreased my odds of developing cancer, heart disease, and all kinds of other conditions.   

 - I have a sense of accomplishment that has taught me that I really can do anything to which I commit.  

 - I can shop wherever I want.  I totally love my new wardrobe.  In fact, just today, a random guy on the street said to me ""I love your style!  You're beautiful!""  That would NEVER have happened before.  

 - I get more respect.  I hate how true this is, but it's shocking.  People treat me completely differently.  I just had no idea how much difference there would be in how I was received.  

 - I feel more outgoing and shiny and brave.  

 - I can go caving all day and slither through tiny underground tunnels.  

 - I am no longer ""She of the eternally Friend-Zoned.""  Cute boys have expressed interest!  Eeeeee!

  ...And on, and on, and on.  

Thank you so, so much r/loseit, for all of the information, inspiration, and constant reminders that the best way is simply to work hard at it and DO it.  There is no try.  You guys are proof that most people who feel defeated are themselves the only thing in the way of success and that with the right information and support system, just about anyone can free their inner skinny kid.

I moved out to Los Angeles to train in visual effects in 2009.  You HAVE to get your act together here.  I soon realized I was going to have a really tough time with relationships and work, since people treat you differently when you're fat.

Long time lurker, first time poster. I've read so many inspirational stories and I've never really felt like mine was worth sharing, but...today I decided it was! Warning, cathartic wall of text!

I've always been big. I topped 100 pounds in third grade (I wasn't tall either) and spent most of high school at around 185 (5'7"" female). Even though I liked recreational activities like biking, walking, or marching band, I also really loved sitting and reading and eating. I was never teased or in any way made to feel less than beautiful because of my weight, but it didn't stop me from feeling awkward and uncomfortable in my skin. I was scared to try running or going to the gym or even making an obvious effort to eat healthy for fear of somehow looking like the stereotypical ""big girl"" or worse, trying and failing. I was diagnosed with Hashimoto's Thyroiditis during my senior year of high school, and although that took off some weight, it wasn't a significant amount. 

When I started college 4 years ago, I made some cursory attempts to start a workout routine and managed to actually lose a few pounds, but I was pretty well resigned to being a bigger girl for the rest of my life. Then, a year and a half ago, I met my wonderful now fiancé! That was really the turning point for me. From the moment we met, he made me feel pretty and sexy and supported and happy. Somehow, having the reassurance that I was beautiful the way that I was gave me the courage and the incentive to try being the healthiest, happiest me I knew I could be. Slowly, I started going to the gym, cutting down on sugar, doing pushups during commercial breaks, and other little changes that added up. In about 16 months, I’ve lost 24 pounds and over the past 4 years I’ve gone from 185 to 138. I spend about 45 minutes on an elliptical machine 4-5 times a week and do resistance training with my own body weight or small hand weights. After wearing a size 14 in high school, I just bought the size 8 wedding dress of my dreams!! It’s not as dramatic or rapid a transformation as a lot of people on here, but today I realized how hard I’ve worked and how proud I am – finally- of myself

Tl;dr – Size 14/16 in high school, just bought a size 8 wedding dress after losing almost 50 pounds over 4 years

Edit: Wow! Thank you all so much for your kind words!! My fiancé is also a redditor, so I can't post pics of the dress yet, but cross my heart, I'll put pics up the day after the wedding :) Good luck to all the other girls in the same situation! You can do it!

I'm not long winded but I'll give a bit of back story.  About 6 years ago I was in a better spot financially and was able to afford a personal trainer.  My starting weight was 339.8 pounds.  I paid $100-120 per week for 3 sessions with a personal trainer.  Basically did 5 days per week of weight training and cardio.  My diet was a traditional low-carb diet but allowed for things such as wheat breat, wheat pasta, brown rice, etc.  The majority of what I ate consisted of grilled chicken, salmon, veggies, brown rice or wheat bread.  My diet was very low fat (didn't each much high fat meats).  In 10 months I lost 110 pounds and ended up losing a total of 118.  

At some point through a series of random incidents, including but not limited to diet issues, money issues, my mom developing cancer and eventually dying (which included 6 months in the hospital, eating mostly fast food and restaurant food) I gained all of the weight that I lost back.  I stayed fairly unhappy and sedentary for a year or two and, through advice of some friends, had been researching Crossfit as well as the Paleo diet.  

Last June I weighed in at 340.8 pounds (if you're paying attention, that's one more than I started at last time).  I made a commitment to myself after finding an affordable Crossfit gym in my town that if I could stay on a decent diet for two weeks I would go sign up.  Well, I did and I did.  Fast forward 10 months and ~20 days I have lost a total of 141.2 pounds, down from 340.8 to 199.6.  I've gone from 4X shirts and 48"" pants to L/XL shirts and 36"" pants.  I am literally in the best shape of my entire life and couldn't be happier.  My current diet consists traditional Paleo diet.  I eat a lot of meat (chicken, steak, pork (and LOTS of BACON), eggs, sweet potatoes, fruit, spinach, etc).  

A few words of advice:  Find a program that you enjoy and you WILL stick with it.  Conversely, if you hate it then you won't.  Your exercise and ""diet"" should become part of your life.  If it isn't then you will abandon it.  Sustainability is key.  A lot of people hate on Crossfit due to it's high cost in relativity to a conventional gym but when you take into account the benefits, it blows the latter away.  Pre-programmed workouts, personal trainers at every session, motivation, accountability, etc etc, all rolled into one.  I absolutely love going to Crossfit and I hate not being able to go.  I go 4-6 times per week, mostly 5.  Also, the Paleo diet has been amazing for me.  It's so simple even a...well, nevermind.  

Anyway, here are a few pictures.  I have posted in here before but this is the most significant milestone that I have ever passed.

I have posted a comparison picture that takes you from my heaviest weight (fall semester of my freshman year of college) to 11 months into my weight loss journey (fall semester of my sophomore year of college) to a current photo (winter break of my junior year of college). 

I have posted before, but to keep you from digging, here's my story again. I decided, in my freshman year, that I was tired of being defined as 'the fat girl'. I was tired of being called 'pretty for my size'. I was tired of what I saw in the mirror. I've always been overweight my whole life, minus maybe to age 3. I was the oddball of my family. Every single person in my family (at my age) was at a healthy weight (granted their current weights are not...well, healthy...) I hated that I got the shit end of the stick. So I made changes. Slow, but sure changes. 

Through trying things in the past, I knew what worked for me and what didn't. Diets didn't work. Quitting cold turkey didn't work. This is what has worked so far. I started out by stopping eating past 07:30pm. After I had that under control, I stopped snacking. I then began replacing pop with water (though I didn't eliminate it completely because I knew if I did, it wouldn't last). I started working out more regularly. I subbed in healthier options over less healthy options. 

Losing the weight has been slow going. It has taken me 23 months to lose 80 pounds. But that's a HUGE number! The big goal I set for myself when I first started was to lose 100 pounds. Ultimately though, I would like to get down to 135, which gives me 30 more to go.

I've always been fat. I constantly got made fun of for it when I was a child, I was always the fat friend, and if I started to try to lose weight, my friends would get jealous (as THEY didn't want to be the fat friend) and make me feel bad about it, so it'd stop. 

A few years ago, I was in a severely abusive relationship. Not physically, but mentally and emotionally. That lasted for over 2 years (because I was convinced I was the crazy one, and thought I deserved nothing else. How wrong I was.). I became depressed, and started eating everything in sight. My highest weight was 190. 

During one week in 2010, I believe, I had to put my dog down, that abusive boyfriend burned my house down, then proceeded to break up with me for a newly 16 year old girl (he was 21 at the time), and I got fired from my job (for calling out because my house burned down. wtf). That was in one. single. week......I stopped eating. I was so stressed, that I couldn't keep down any food. I'd eat nibbles here and there because I didn't want to *die*, but in the span of one month, I lost about 40 pounds. It was awful, unhealthy, and I felt disgusting. 

Eventually I started eating again, met someone new who I'm currently with (nearly 3 years now), and my weight ballooned up to 180. On November 14th of last year, my boyfriend and I decided that we no longer wanted to be unhealthy, and we both changed our lives for the better. Since November 14, 2011, I've lost a little over 30 pounds by lifting weights, and eating right (about 1200-1300 calories a day. Clean eating)

I feel absolutely amazing. I feel strong. I feel awesome. I have a kick ass job as a fashion designer/ in house artist/ free lance illustrator (I designed the undies I'm wearing in my progress pics, below :P), I have a boyfriend who doesn't treat me like shit, and I'm bettering my self! I haven't yet reached my goal weight of 130 yet, but I'm closer than I've ever been. In fact, I don't think I've been in the 140s since middle school! 

I feel like I've over come a lot, but I've come out stronger, both physically and mentally. 


**TL;DR: Got really fat, bad shit happened to me and it sucked and I stopped eating, shit got better and I got fat again. Didn't want to be fat any more so I stopped.**

I started off at 36.5% body fat /216 lbs last April, and in 10 months, I have dwindled down to 23.4% body fat and a lean 157 lbs.  I have lost 59lbs on the scale, but I believe due to strength training that number would probably be around 70 had I not gained muscle.

What I did:  

Step 1.  Gave up fast food for Lent last year.  
Step 2.  Limited one meal per day for 6 months (work at lunch was one  apple and a lean cuisine meal anywhere from 220-380 calories) while limiting myself to 1500 calories a day. 

Step 3. Walking three days per week for 6 months for at least 1 hour a day.  This started off being 2 -3 miles but as I gained strength and speed, I ended up walking 4 miles each time.  Now I walk a brisk pace of 5 miles per hour when at my max. 

Step 4.  Joined a gym:  Paid $99 for a 3 session workout with a personal trainer.  He taught me many forms of calisthetics, weight lifting, and stretching techniques I continued to use and still use today. He also keeps up with me on a monthly to bimonthly basis (reweighs/measures me) to make sure I'm still on track. 

Step 5.  Yoga/Pilates/Zumba classes two to three days per week.  I did this as my main workout for a long time. Now I only do Zumba two days per week as my high end cardio to offset my current strength training routine. 

Step 6.  Increased my calories to 2000/day. Changed diet slightly by adding lots of Protein, and cutting out certain Carbs to an occasional basis like bread and pasta, and keeping my grams of fat between 50-68grams per day.  

Step 7.  Begin 12 week strength training program that I found on /r/fitness's  FAQ  Entitled the [Female Fitness Bible](http://www.bodybuilding.com/fun/womans_lean_sexy_bible.htm)  I follow this almost completely.  I use a different form of protein powder though.  Ask me if you want to know.  Currently in week 8 of this program.  

If you want me to be specific on what I ate, I will answer those questions in a message, or reply here and I'll be more specific.  A friend said what I sounded like I was doing diet wise was pretty much the South Beach Diet.  I looked it up, and pretty much that's what I was doing, without even knowing it.  

Anyone need questions/advice, let me know.  I think I've figured this crap out!

I come from big family of really big women, even at 155 lbs (my weight a year ago)  I was still, by far, the smallest of all the ladies over 18. My mom has struggled with her weight for years and was recently diagnosed with an under active thyroid, as have several of her sisters and some of my cousins so I thought it was going to be unavoidable.   
I was 105 when my husband and I started dating, something that I don't know if I even want to see again. I was on steroids for joint problems a few times and my weight ballooned, it seemed like nothing I did mattered, like it permanently broke my metabolism. I was 123 starting grad school when I bought my scale. I wanted to get to about 115 then but all I did was gain weight, grad school isn't conducive to ""dieting."". Every time I've weighed myself since 2009, that 123 in the corner has been staring at me. Then I had a baby almost a year and a half ago and I was really sick for most of it, I went up to about 175. I'm 5'0"" and even pregnant that was a scary number. After he was born, the weight just seemed stuck on.  
In August I had to wear my maternity bathing suit to my son's first birthday party and that's when something snapped and I said ""enough."" I've been really strict about portion control for everything, I've been drinking a lot more water, and I don't strictly calorie count every bit all day but i try to at least be aware of the calories in meals. I have 2 eggs with cheese and one small carb side for breakfast, a lunch that I try t to keep in the 300-400 calorie range, a sensible, balanced dinner (maybe around 500 calories give or take? - hard to tell with home-cooking). I get two 100 calorie snacks a day (e.g. 23 whale crackers or a skinny cow chocolate treat) and one mini can of soda. If I'm hungry at night I'll have some cereal or a babybel cheese or something. I don't feel hungry or deprived at all and it's working!  I weigh myself first thing every single morning so that my day-to-day numbers are comparable, and I don't let myself get upset by minor fluctuations.    
Some people dislike daily weight checks butiI need it. It's too easy to let things get out of control by not paying attention. Pre-baby, I hadn't weighed myself for awhile and went from about 127 to 140 without even realizing it. My clothes were tighter but I didn't expect that, y'know? 
I wish physical activity was easier here. It's winter in Michigan, we live in a small town with no amenities, just off of a very busy 4-lane road with no sidewalks anwhere close. This town is not walking-friendly at all unless I drive somewhere. My joint problems kinda make that hard too.   
The best part is knowing that the holidays are behind us and I didn't gain weight. :-) maybe my original, impossible goal of 115 is not so impossible. :-)

*I'm all for being proactive, and this by no means is something that affects me personally, but I hate it when people say ""well just don't eat the food!!!"" when someone mentions it being hard because of what their parents buy.*

*Not everyone is 20+ or living away from home. Not all teenagers or young people have jobs or are able to pay for their own food. When your parents are buying shit food instead of buying good foods, it's not reasonable to say ""oh just suck it up and don't eat, then!"" because for some people, their parents are their only source of nutrition. In this respect, the parents need to take responsibility for their kids' ability to eat healthier.*

*It's not fair to tell someone to just stop eating junk food if that's all that's available to them. Especially when their family isn't supportive.*

*The worst is that you just know it's skinny people who say it. Like it's just that easy. Or people who are independent. Sorry that some people don't have money to buy their own food.*

*Anyway, rant.*

**final edit:**  I made it clear this wasn't something I was personally dealing with. Please stop making **harassing comments about how I personally am making excuses and should just unsubscribe and go see a doctor because i am too lazy to actually try.**

Because so many of you think I am making a personal arguement against responsibility, I will post here and leave it at that.

My personal opinion is specific. If a child grows up in an environment where their parents do not provide them with adequate nutrition - From the ages of 0-16 - then it should not be ""on them"". It is not their fault that they are overweight. They grow up with bad habits because their families are irresponsible, or do not feel that weight is or should be an issue. 

HOWEVER, I never implied or said that a person should not take responsibility for themselves or take action to help themselves. I only said that it was the responsibility of the parent to provide adequate nutritional care, and that a failure of the parent to do so should not result in ""victim blaming"" of the overweight child.

Having said this, I believe that a person, once knowledge or means becomes available, should do anything within the power to help themselves, as long as it is healthy.

Some of you have suggested simple calorific deficit is good enough. I beg to differ in this case. You will never find a nutritionist that says it's okay for children and young adults who are still developing to maintain a diet which is deficient simply because the calorific intake is restricted. 

That is all I really have to say.

I'd appreciate those of you who have been giving me ""personal advice"" to stop. It is not only hurtful, but shows that you didn't bother to read the first line of my post.

...He has lost his smoking addiction too!

**His method:** (Nothing out of the blue here, just lots of small steps that lead to really big changes)

**Nutrition:**

* Replaced sugary drinks with diet drinks

* Replaced really dense junk food with smaller amounts of junk. If he had a craving for junk, he would eat a small bag of crisps/potato chips worth 100kcal instead of the 300kcal+ bags he was eating before.

* Veg. Chicken. Tuna. – High protein, low fat, moderate amounts of carbohydrates #.

**Exercise:**

* Months of uphill treadmill walking

* Exercise Bike

* He only started running in 9-10 months into the process once he was light enough. It has now become a 30 mile per week hobby... 

* He has been lifting on and off since about June... Compound barbell movements i.e Bench/Deadlift/Squat, however he hasn't focused too much on these just yet..

So when 2011 started, I was somewhere between 406 and 392 pounds and already almost a year into my transformation, which began at 538 pounds. I had started with fairly big mental hurdles to overcome, including depression and agoraphobia. However, at the beginning of 2011, I was beginning to overcome them. As my body was improving and I was taking more pride in myself, everything around me was getting a lot better.

In 2011, I went to my first NFL game (favorite sport) ever in September to see the Carolina Panthers lose to the Greenbay Packers in a nailbiter. I went to Carowinds (amusement park) and fit comfortably on all of the rides. I slid into restaurant booths effortlessly for the first time. I got my license back after a decade and easily fit into my wife's smallish Mitsubishi Lancer. I went bowling, I played a ton of basketball, and I lifted weights 4 times a week without injury. 2011 was an amazing year for me.

I live in Kannapolis, NC but used to live in Virginia, where my best friend of 15 years still lives. Because traveling was incredibly difficult for me for obvious reasons and him for different reasons, we only saw each other once a year after I moved. My wife and I had made it tradition visit on New Years. I started my transformation in March of 2010, so that New Years had already passed. However, by the time I got to 2011 and hadn't told him I'd took an interest in fitness yet, I thought it'd be pretty awesome if I skipped the 2011 trip and waited until 2012 to see him again.

I underestimated how hard it'd be to keep the secret because as time went on, I became more and more obsessed with fitness and nutrition. It monopolized my time and left me with little else to talk about. I couldn't talk to him about it though because I was hiding a giant secret.

A few days ago, I finally got to stop hiding the secret. I had my wife drive around the block while I ninja'd my way up to his door with small camcorder and when he opened the door, [this was the look he gave me](http://i.imgur.com/XKnE8.jpg).

A lot of our communication, even when we lived 15 minutes apart, was over the phone and Internet. Because of that, I knew he'd recognize my voice, so I just stood there like a creeper holding a phone in his face. He shot me death glare as you would a threat to your family. In that moment, I was a complete and utter stranger to the person who knew me best of anyone else in the world aside from my wife.

I got the very distinct impression he was about to punch me so I blurted out ""JESSE!"" which is my name. After a few moments of doe-eyed reflection, [this was the next face I saw](http://i.imgur.com/WQGkL.jpg).

So for me, 2011 was about reintroducing myself to the outside world and the moment my best friend opened the door, it marked the end of phase 1 of my transformation. I've been working to prepare my body and mind for a little more abuse because I'm chasing perfection. I'm not going to be happy just being a pudgy every-man. I'm working hard towards becoming a freak of the exact opposite nature I felt I was before. Phase 1 was about uncovering my athletic spirit and preparing myself for abuse and Phase 2 is about uncovering my athletic body and knocking out life goals, like a stable career in fitness and nutrition.

So that was my 2011 and here's to a badass 2012, hopefully full of motivation from the transformations of other [/r/loseit](/r/loseit) denizens looking to put on the body recomping gloves and fight to make their dreams real.

P.S. I'll post the video when I'm done editing it together with his brother's reaction, which I didn't catch completely on video because I was blitzed out of my mind, but got the audio.

Whenever I'd go to my parents house to visit and do laundry I had been tossing my oversized clothes Rubbermaid bin I was storing in their basement.  I didn't give much thought to this, but in the back of my head I was probably keeping them ""just in case"".

This past weekend my Dad noticed the bin and asked why I was bothering to keep the clothes. It caught me off guard and I immediately felt embarrassed. Before I could answer he said ""You know, when Cortés reached the new world from Spain in the 1500's he ordered his men to burn the ships"" To which I promptly replied ""LOL STFU Dad! You heard Sean Connery say that in Hunt for the Red October!"" and we both had a good laugh.

Despite the fact Cortés actually sank the ships (and eventually killed thousands of indigenous Aztec people) my Dad was right. We dragged the bin to my car and drove it to the nearest Salvation Army drop off.  

My Dad helped me unload and empty the bin. When we were done he said he was proud of me. I joked that the bin wasn't THAT heavy and this WAS a tax deductible write-off so it wasn't a selfless act. He rolled his eyes, put his hand on my shoulder, and reiterated. 

He said he knew what I was doing is hard and he thought it was important I knew how proud he was of me for doing it. 

He had caught me off guard for the second time that day, but instead of feeling embarrassed, I felt like I was going to cry. I choked it back, thanked him, and we hugged. 

My old man isn't usually a hugger. I guess it seems sort of odd to share an emotional father son moment while waiting for the toothless Salvation Army clerk to write a donation receipt as you awkwardly stand in the parking lot between Stop &amp; Shop and a Joanne Fabrics, but... 

...this was the single most encouraging and profound NSV I've had since starting this ""project of self improvement"". It was a small gesture that meant more to me than he'll probably ever know.  

Listen to my Dad.
Burn the ships. Don't look back. Be proud of yourself and know other people are proud of you too.

I posted in [r/progress](http://www.reddit.com/r/progresspics/) pics as well, but I wanted to do something more detailed.

**Here are the pictures, since those are always fun.**

[Face](http://i.imgur.com/bPL1z.jpg)

[Body](http://i.imgur.com/YE0T5.jpg)

&gt; What I do:

*Food* - Count calories (1700/day, 2100 on workout days). Lowish carb (I was stricter about it [under 50g/day], bringing it back up, cap it around 100g/day, 150g on heavy work out days). I eat every 2-3 hours.

I still drink alcohol, I still have treats every so often. I recognize this is how I need to eat **forever**, depriving myself of things I really like wasn't going to work out. I'm able, however, to just have ONE of something. I had to teach myself this, but it's possible. Just one cookie is way better than just one pan of cookies.

*Exercise* - Strong Lifts 5x5, 3 times a week along with 3-5 mile runs on those days. I started with c25k, and would recommend it to anyone who wants to get into it. I LOVE running, you might not. **Do what you love.** On off lifting days, I either bike 8-10 miles or swim for 45 minutes (unless I am sore, then I take a rest day). I also walk everywhere, as I have the luxury of living in a big city. I have become WORLDS more active and healthier. I look forward to my workouts, especially running.

Currently 225lbs, 5'10. I do not have a goal weight set, nor time period of getting there. I don't weigh-in frequently, I think the scale is such a small, and often unreliable part of the whole picture. I go by how I feel, how clothes fit (was a US size 28 and 3X, now US 16 and L) and my measurements.

This is [literally](http://26.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_llaxf2IGQ01qayczvo1_400.jpg) the best shape I have ever been in, in my entire life. I feel like I tapped into some hidden athlete and have fully embraced it as my lifestyle.

Whether you have 5 or 250lbs to lose - just know you are totally capable of it and no one is standing in your way but you.

I read your stories every day. You are all so inspiring!

I started at 325lbs, and now I'm hovering around 215-220lbs.  I certainly have some more distance to go, and I'm hoping there can be a mutually beneficial relationship between myself and /r/loseit, as I've hit a bit of a wall, and the pace is very slow-going now.

To get to where I've come, I moved from my hometown of Dallas/Ft. Worth to Austin, which is notoriously big on the ""natural"" binge.  So I decided to 180 my diet, for my health, and not so much for weight loss (even though I knew it'd be a nice perk).  Only drinking water and unsweet tea, and only eating things I cook, it didn't take long for me to see some drastic results.  I cooked all my meals or ate raw, absolutely nothing out of a box, and certainly nothing out of a microwave for a year.  I've become more lax on that rule since my life has become quite a bit more time-intensive, but I'm still watching closely what I eat, and albeit slow, I'm still making progress.

I want to lose about 30 pounds. 190 is a very comfortable weight for me. 180 would be better. 

I eat well and I run from time to time, but I also to spend lots of time standing still, or sitting still, while playing video games. Then I decided to change that. I didn't want to give up video games, but I wanted to exercise more often. So! I combined them into [this!](http://i.imgur.com/cR36s.jpg)

I do not think I have ever made a better decision in my life, ever! Now I walk 2mph while I play my games. I am clocking in at over 21 miles a week and every day I feel better about myself. I am losing weight slowly and at a safe pace. This is something all gamers should play on, all the time.

The primary components clock in at under $350 ([desk](http://www.ikeafans.com/home/modular-desks-ikeas-jerker-is-undisputed-king/) and [treadmill](http://www.ebay.com/itm/CONFIDENCE-FITNESS-NEW-ELECTRIC-FOLDING-TREADMILL-W-PRO-TRACK-MOTORIZED-BELT-/330723563855?pt=US_Cardio_Treadmills&amp;hash=item4d00a9194f)) and it is very easy to do. It does not effect your ability to play games or use a PC if you walk the proper speed. I have found that somewhere between 1 and 2.5 MPH is perfect, depending on the task.


Edit: I have stared a new diet also. I am not neglecting that part of weight loss. This is also not my only form of exercise. I run a few (3+) time a week and am doing other things like using the dumbbells you see. Push ups, sit ups, and and using a total gym. This is just a way to turn the gaming part of my life into part of a total fitness and weight loss program instead of it being counter to my over all goals.

Edit: It is not hard to play like this. I do not run. I walk. I use a mouse, it is easy. Doesn't mess with your game at all. Keep it around 2 mph and using a computer doesn't change.

For the past 8 years now I have been 100% miserable by how I look. I hate everything about everything about how I look. I'm coming up for 340lbs now. I'm a 6'1 guy, so I carry it ""okay"", but I'm still a massively unappealing dude.

I am constantly trying to put into place changes to my eating and exercise to combat this weight, but I feel like I'm two people, and I really mean that.

I feel like the first guy is me, who is writing this, who knows how much of life he has missed out on, how beneficial to my career it would be (not something I can go into I'm afraid) and how much happier I would be thin.

Then, I feel like the second guy. He doesn't give a shit. After a hard day at work, miserable with his station in life, he treats himself. He deserves to enjoy food. Exercise? Fuck that. We've been working all day while our friends have been sitting on their ass. We're going to have a pizza and some soda, fuck that shit. We're going to waste more of your precious money, which even though you have no bills you KNOW goes directly on comfort food, to make you feel better.

And I can't stop it.  I've tried. This has been going on for so long. Like, so long.

A little background, if needed. I grew up in an incredibly abusive childhood. Nothing I feel appropriate going into (I don't want sympathy upvotes) but it fucked me up a good deal, so much so that my crippling hatred of my body lead to me staying indoors for a solid 3-5 years. Now, I'm working and am a lot better, but I can't beat that second guy.

It's like a waveform diagram. Sometimes I am almost MANIC with my want to lose weight, and then it dips into not giving a fuck, treating myself to delicious foods because I feel I deserve it for putting up with horseshit all day, and then back to the high again where I feel almighty guilt for being a fat tard.

You are on a path of suffering the likes of which you can never describe. But you are here. You are still. Fucking. Here.

Let me tell you a secret. They are afraid of you. They are afraid of you because you are the man, you are the woman, that cannot be finished. Broken, yes, broken into razor-sharp sand, but never finished. You are the mass of meat that lies on the ground, getting beaten around the clock, that will just not die. 

Somewhere inside you is something that wants out. It's something no husband can slap away. No loved one can take with them when they die. No corporation can claim when they take your job and your dignity with it. As long as you draw breath it is there, and it's what makes them afraid of you. 

They have it. We all have it. The difference between you and them is that they don't need it, don't use it. It is a pleasant thing in them, a nice little cherry on top of the sundae that is their life. In you? It is a snarling beast. It has been beaten down by the world only for the sake of being beaten, it has been mocked and discounted and cast aside on virtue of being unworthy. 

You are not weak. Fucking say it out loud. Not. Weak. It isn't weakness to break. Even diamonds become dust when you pound on them long enough. Food is comfort, is control. It is where people go when they are thrown into a crucible so unbearable that the only comforts afforded them are small trivialities. You give the man your money and he gives you a carton of calories and comfort. Some days, most days, it is the only good thing your life has to offer, a healing potion of high fructose corn syrup and sodium bromide. 

Then, one day, you stand. ""You have to hit rock bottom before you can stand."" What kind of shit is that? You know who says that? People that have never seen rock bottom. There IS no rock bottom. There's just more falling. Rock bottom is a place we tell ourselves exists because every day is worse, and the light at the end of the tunnel is the place where it can't get any worse. But it can always get worse, until the day you stand.

You buy sweatpants and a bandana. You tie it around your head and you walk a mile and sweat like a pig. It takes you ten times the effort to do a tenth of what they do. You want to give it up. Maybe you do, for a bit. Then you come back and try again.

You feel the dopamine tingle that comes with seeing the numbers on the scale going in the other direction for a change. Now you're on the path. They're fucking scared, and you see it first in the faces of other fat people that are less fat than you. You were the guy or girl they would look at and say, ""At least I'm not that fat."" Only now, at some point, that stopped being true. You slipped past them without anyone realizing what was happening. 

This is part of why they fear you. The world forgot about you a long time ago. Someone wrote you off as the girl with the huge tits - thanks, donuts - who could be hot if she'd just lose weight. Someone wrote you off as the brilliant, kind man with the 50 inch waistline... which means you aren't anyone at all, brilliant and kind and all. They didn't forget about you. They dismissed you, THEN they forgot about you. 

Only now here you are.

Here you are going from walking a mile to walking two. Now three. Now five. Now you run half of it. Now you run all of it. Now you lift. Ten pounds. Twenty. Fifty. Ninety. In the heat, in the rain, when you're sick, when you're hungry. Always hungry. God, but you are so fucking hungry, sometimes. 

You were a soul beaten down and forgotten. Life and all its cruelty saw fit to grind you into paste. Only now... here you are again. Your gut is shrinking. You look in the mirror one day and... is that a two pack? You can see your abs. You didn't even know you had abs. Just the world's biggest bully button.

The fear on their faces is a mix of awe and wonder. You can come roaring back. Even after all of it, you can make the choice to stand and come back together. You aren't finished. Even after all you have been through, even after life tried to handicap you, you can come back and surpass them. All of them. That's why they fear you. They fear what you're capable of. 

They should be afraid. You're unstoppable.

Hey everyone! My name is Chelsea. I did [Tough Mudder](http://toughmudder.com/) in October of last year. I was over 200 at the time. Although I did some weight lifting, I did not do cardio or regulate my diet. Tough Mudder was supposed to be my motivation to get fit, but I didn't really crack down. It was very hard, but I completed all 12 miles with help from my dad, husband, and three amazing friends! I didn't feel huge at the time. Thennnn we got our event photos back. WHAT?! I LOOK LIKE THAT?! Wow, now that was motivation. Particularly the photo I posted above in the before/after link. So, I started weight watchers at 204.8 in January. I didn't do any form of exercise for the first three months and lost 25 pounds. I made [my first loseit post](http://www.reddit.com/r/loseit/comments/1bff0d/i_wont_be_eating_cake_on_my_cake_day/) on my cake day and shortly after, incorporated running. I lost a few more pounds, and made [my second reddit post](http://www.reddit.com/r/loseit/comments/1ca1or/went_for_my_first_scantily_clad_run_in_my_life/) when I went for my first sports bra only run of my life!

Now I have just reached the 6 week anniversary of adding incorporating weight lifting back into my routine. I am down 43.6 pounds and [finally looking a little ""fit""](http://i.imgur.com/AFAxF16.jpg)! I stopped weight watchers about 2 weeks ago and started counting calories instead because I wasn't eating enough with weight watchers and the intensity of the training I am now doing. I use My Fitness Pal to track calories and have next to no friends on there, so if you want to add me and motivate each other my username is chelseacknutson.

I've been a heavy person my entire life. A lot of people say that, and it's true for a lot of people, but I really have never been thin for a moment. I was born big and in the 20 years following I made a single attempt at not being the fat guy. When I was 14 I started going to the gym and it actually worked out pretty well for me. I've never really been one for scales, so I didn't know my numbers, but I would guess that I got to around 220 and I'd already about gotten to my current height of 5'11"". I lost motivation for the gym and started just hanging out with friends, which actually wasn't so bad for me. I don't think I gained much weight if any as we did a lot of walking and biking around town.  
  
I got a job, license and a car at 16. This was the start of terrible things. I worked at a pizza place and brought home pizza multiple times a week. I worked a bunch so I didn't have time to do a lot of the activities with friends anymore. I had a car so I didn't want to walk/bike anymore. Over the next four years I became exceedingly proficient in making poor choices day in/day out. There were days I had multiple fast food meals. I was eating out almost every day of the week during certain stretches of that time. I knew my friends were worried about me, some of them even made obvious attempts to try to help me, but I was not having it.  
  
There were two events that finally really opened my eyes. In January or February of 2012 my mother (who I lived with) was diagnosed with acute myeloid leukemia. I spent most of the first 6-week round of chemo with her in the hospital. I was too big for the chair and it was extremely uncomfortable. Then in May my long-time girlfriend and I made plans to go with another couple to Vegas in November. I was practically pretrified by the thought of either having to ask for a seatbelt extender or being asked to pay for a second seat, or worse yet being held back from the flight because there was no second seat for me to buy. I couldn't imagine the shame.  
  
But now, mid-May, I was ready.  
  
We had a bathroom scale that I finally stepped on for the first time. Error. Not surprised. I didn't care though. I had basically no knowledge of fitness or healthy diet, but I started with everything I could muster. I was too embarrassed to run during the day but every night for the first two weeks I ran miles around my neighborhood (Basically as much jogging as I could possibly stand before falling over then walking, repeat). It was awful, but it felt so good to know that I was doing something good for myself. I was pumped up. I got a gym membership after I got shin splints (which I attributed to working too hard too fast on too hard a surface). I went every day I had the opportunity.  
  
I got myfitnesspal on my phone and ignored their allotted calories, and resided myself to no more than 1500/day. This was a little bit difficult at first, just because I wasn't used to paying attention to whether or not I was actually hungry or watching calories at all. I drank almost exclusively water, but having previously been a heavy soda drinker, I also had (and still ahve) a diet soda when I really want one (not very often anymore - mostly when out at a restaurant). I also limited myself to eating out no more than once every two weeks, which more than paid for the gym membership.  
  
I can't remember how long it took, exactly, but within a month or two I stepped on the scale and actually got a reading: 340 pounds. That was a mix of emotions. On the one hand, I didn't think I could weigh that much. On the other, I knew I had to weigh that much and I was ecstatic that I now had a reading! I decided that my starting weight had to be somewhere around 370.  
  
Since that moment not much has changed in my routine. As my mom's condition got worse my workouts got more spaced out, but I did a decent job at trying not to eat emotionally or out of boredom. Around Christmastime I did indulge in all the Christmas baked goods and honestly only felt a little bad about it. I jumped back into my routine and busted the weight right back off and then some.  
  
My mom continued to get worse and just recently passed in March. It's been very tough for me since then I've made a lot of excuses in the past two months to eat and skip workouts and make poor choices, but I'm trying very hard to get out of that rut. I just got back from a long workout doing 45 minutes lifting and 45 minutes cardio. I actually just had my best mile today at 8:38. I know that's not a spectacular number, but it's my personal best and I can't wait to do even better than that.  
  
My current workout routine consists of at least 3 days at the gym per week.  
Day 1: 30 mins (or more if not sweating yet) of various strength exercises targeting arms and upper body. Next 30 mins spent between any mix of bike, treadmill, elliptical, Jacob's Ladder, and stairmaster - but always ending with running at least 10 mins on treadmill. I recently started HIIT on the treadmill.  
Day 2: Same but with focus on legs for strength training.  
Day 3: All cardio! I hate day 3, but it's a good rest from weights.  
  
So what am I down to now? Well, as I said I've been having a rough couple months, but the lowest I've hit is 219, and the highest I've caught myself at was 231, which was the push to getting back on track. Right now I'm about 225. My goal is 190, then I'd like to really focus on weights as I enjoy that the most.

Anyway, if you've read all this, thanks a lot! I intend to continue and finding motivation in myself. I strive to be better in every way since I've started my weight loss, and in the last year I think I've taken great strides to do so.

I posted a before and after of my current weight loss, however, didn't show my before and after. The picture above is from 3 years beforehand, I started in May 2009 and this is a picture of August 2011. I had a personal trainer for 9 months of this which became very much my best friend during that time. In that 9 months I went from 320lb to 185lb and I lost the next 15lb over 6 more months. Just so you do know, I ate the same thing for 9 months, 90 minutes of cardio and 45 weight lifting. Went from 80lb bench press to 280 and at the time of the photo could see my 2nd set of abs (some days). 

Here's too inspiration for you, if you've have weight that you have that you want to lose, remember, ""don't think, just do"" if you have that mentality, although, difficult you can accomplish anything, get anywhere and reach and exceed any goal. Good luck everyone!

A year ago, I realized that I was bored and unhappy with my life. I looked for a gym around my apartment, and couldn’t find anything. I signed up to take a zumba class once a week at the local community centre. Although I didn’t have any immediate health concerns, I would come home afterwards and lay on my couch feeling absolutely beat. I don’t think I realized how limited my lifestyle was. But the instructor was so nice and supportive that I always had fun and felt good about myself afterwards – this was a totally new experience in my life.

As I became more active and starting doing zumba more often, I also started paying more attention to the food fueling my body. I tried to do keto, but felt crappy all of the time.  I increased the amount of carbs that I eat and immediately felt better, so I now eat between 1200-1600 calories a day of what essentially amounts to a non-strict version of paleo.

After 6 months of zumba, I was beginning to look for a new challenge. A friend recommended New Rules of Lifting for Women, and I tried and loved it. I also started doing C25K with a friend.  In May, I started taking a Powerlifting course at the local Y to improve some issues I was having with my lifts, and have since been doing Starting Strength 3x week. I hope to compete next summer and meanwhile, I am training to run my first 5K in the fall.  

Last night, I took some progress shots of how I’ve changed over the year. Here is [the before.](http://i.imgur.com/f2cZj.jpg). Here I am [after a year.](http://i.imgur.com/6jY02.jpg)

 I thought I was going to be disappointed  because 60lbs lost seems like such a small number and when I look in the mirror I still see the same person that I've seen my entire life. Instead I feel a little bit shocked at how much progress I’ve made. I’m glad that all the small things that I’ve done consistently have added up and produced measurable results, and I’m reassured that I will continue down the right path – because I still have a long way to go. I feel much like a much more competent human being, not because I lost weight but because I proved to myself that I have the dedication and commitment to invest in something worthwhile (myself).

If you are reading this and unsure how to change, know that it is possible, but only you can do it for yourself, and only you can decide if it’s worth doing. Take it one day at a time because you’ve got your body for life, so if you don’t get it right today, tomorrow is a whole new day. :)

So how do you lose 100#?  Diet, exercise, and dedication.  You have to work on all three.  Skimp on any one of the three and it won’t work. I started out 2011 knowing that I had gained weight. I had lost about 30# from 2009 to 2010, but it had all came back.  My size 18W jeans were getting tight and I had a reality check when I ran out of conference clothes that really fit well that I thought I looked good in. This was in March 2011, and by April 2011 I had a reality check – I was not happy, and wanted to change my life.

I started small, just cutting out fast food and buying more fruits and vegetables. Then I added in strength training. I honestly didn’t do any cardio for the first few months.  I just focused on retraining my tastebuds to crave healthy foods and slowly working on Pilates and strength training I could do in my home. And it worked.  I lost the first 50 pounds in six months.

Then I joined SparkPeople.com for continued motivation. I know most of Reddit likes myfitnesspal.com, but I personally like the Spark community (PM me if you’re on there!). Basically any website you can use to track your food and fitness is a good choice. SparkPeople.com helped me to recognize the importance of calorie counting and portion sizes, and the benefits of cardio. I realized that after losing the first 50# I had to religiously stick to my calorie ranges and work out to see results. For the first time I planned out my meals and used measuring cups and a food scale to ensure I wasn’t overeating. Most weeks I would work out five to six days a week, with cardio on at least three days. Over time I’ve had to increase both time and then intensity to keep up with my increasing fitness level.  When I started out, I started small – 10 crunches… 50 crunches… now I do over 2000 in different positions—but it takes awhile.  Don’t think you can get there overnight or expect results immediately.  I’ve taken a year and a half and I’m not done yet.

During this time I also was on a restricted diet for kidney stones, have gone almost completely dairy-free (I still haven’t found a good non-dairy ice cream), and eat a reduced gluten diet.  As a result I cured myself of kidney stones, migraines, irritable bowel syndrome, and allergies.  I can’t even begin to tell you how much better I feel now both physically and mentally.

2012 has been less about losing weight and more about toning.  I’m 5’10” so I honestly don’t think I’ll lose that much more. Instead I’m switching into more muscle building and more intense strength training. I am not one of the lucky ones whose skin magically rebounded. I had a brachioplasty three weeks ago to remove upper arm skin (4” on each arm!), so my goals now are mostly focused on getting some killer guns in the near future. 

I just want everyone to know they can do this. Thanks r/loseit for continued motivation. Sometimes if I’m feeling crabby about my body/weight or feel like a binge – I come on here to check out all of your success stories (both SV and NSV).

My journey started in Nov. of 2011. Basically, I was in and out of the ER with various health issues (gout, back problems, high blood pressure). The Doc took some blood tests, and came back to me with some news that changed my life. He told me that I was very quickly on my way towards diabetes, high blood pressure, hypertension...what have you. Now keep in mind, at that time I was 28. I had to make some life altering decisions. And boy am I glad that I did. From there on, I refocused my life into an active one. I started working out 5-6 times a week...each day I had to get in cardio...and on mon, wed and fri i weight trained. At the end of November, after 2 weeks of working out, I stepped on the scale and I was at 404 lbs. Now I'm pretty sure that at my biggest, I was pushing 420 (yes I have pics to show). After that first weigh in, I set my goal to hit 299 lbs before the end of 2012. Today, I am excited to tell you that a couple days ago I weighed myself and was at 308. I have 9 more lbs til i hit goal and then I will  be, yet again, re-focusing and setting a new goal for 250. I'm still a big fatty, but I'm so much healthier than where I was..and am full of momentum to get me to new levels of better living/better health. If you are out there and are currently at the point where I was when I started, feel free to reach out. I'm more than willing to give you some insight on what helped me and what to expect, but mainly just to encourage and support you, and have you know that you can do this and you are not alone. I wish you well in your journey.

Story: This past 4th of July I went to my friends pop's house to blow shit up and go swimming. The very next day I saw some pictures of me in my underoos swimming in the river and realized that I had lost control. So, that was July 5th, 2012. I had to shop around to find a scale that would weigh me, another eye opener, but finally found one. 389lbs. Sweet merciful baby Jesus. How had I let it come to this? That was it. Change or die. So I cleaned up my diet. Went with MFP and keep myself around 1500 cal/ day. Didn't really start working out until November. November 1st I quit smoking, and started C25k. Let me say, the program is amazing. My fat ass runs 3 miles every other day now, and I couldn't feel better. Today being January 5th is 6 months after when I started this journey, so I decided to break my every-other-week weigh in and hop on the scale this morning. 
288lbs. Glory glory hallelujah! Just over 100lbs shed in 6 months. I'd never have thought I was capable of this. 

If I can answer any questions for anyone please let me know, I'll do my best. I know I've got a long way to go, but as the song says, ""damn it feels good to be a gangster"".

Hit 186 this morning. Waist has gone from 40"" to 34"". I've averaged about 4.5 lbs per week (incredible) via a very structured plan called ""Take Shape For Life."" It provides 800-1,000 calories per day via the Medifast 5+1 meal plan. The ""5"" refers to Medifast Meals and the ""1"" is a ""real"" meal lean protein / green vegetable meal. Also, healthy fats are required each day (the gallbladder likes that).

The 5 meals (about 100 calories each) are nutritionally complete and very high in protein. My daily protein intake is 72g or more. Carbs are limited to 80-85g or so. And everything's low glycemic. My 1 meal is a lean protein (chicken, fish, lean beef or veggie) and lower-carb green vegetables. Lots of good recipes online so I get good variety and still have some fun in the kitchen. 

It's been easy to stay on because 1) I'm not hungry throughout the day (explanation below) and 2) the rewards come so fast it's VERY motivating. 

Because I'm eating low calorie, low glycemic index ""meals"" throughout the day, I don't get big blood sugar spikes followed by insulin spikes (as I would by eating a bagel at 8am, a candy bar at 10, piece of pizza at noon, etc.). Picture it as ""rolling waves"" instead of big spikes. That moderates the carb-fueled crash-and-crave cycle that's a typical part of the American diet. When I reach my goal (160 lbs), the plan transitions me to fewer Medifast meals and more real food -- but the underpinnings of the plan (frequent eating, carb control, high protein) stay in place.

Lost via diet &amp; exercise after a lifetime of obesity.
It can be done!

I lost my weight on a medically supervised program via a certified Bariatrician (not surgery) which included protein 6x day, fats &amp; veg. and maintain following a lower carb/optimal protein diet.

edit to add more info:
total weight lost: 110 lbs in 8 1/2 months over 4 years ago. This lead me into the field of bariatric *medicine* (not surgery).  I am a member of the American Society of Bariatric Physicians (ASBP) and the Chairperson for the ASBP Pediatric Task Force.

Starting weight: 278 lbs
Ending weight: 168 lbs
Height: 5'11""

Obesity is, for most people, a metabolic dysfunction.  I was diagnosed with Hyperinsulinemia &amp; Reactive Hypoglycemia and was on the road to diabetes.  Carbs are not my friends.  I never have them for breakfast, and never by themselves (I link them with a bit of fat &amp; protein to blunt the effect on my blood sugar).  I no longer have GERD (for which I was on medication, required an EGD, and was in constant pain) and I no longer suffer from a Fatty Liver.  I know when I've had too many carbs when my hunger comes roaring back.  It is at that point, I back up from carbs which will help to control it.  I exercise for what it does for my mood (as weight loss is about 90% diet/ 10% exercise).  I hope this update give some more info. Please let me know if I can share anything else with you.

So two months ago I decided I wanted to change. I heard about this subreddit and was inspired by all the success stories, motivational posts and before &amp;amp; afters. I weighed myself towards the end of august, and saw I was 187lb, which at my age and height is not exactly idea. 

Here's what I looked like that day:
[NSFW, chubby chick in underwear](http://25.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_m8exilbBzt1rdr933o1_500.jpg)

So I joined a gym and threw out all the sugary and unhealthy stuff I had in my kitchen, shopped for fresh foods, and decided to change my lifestyle. I've been weighing myself weekly, and just last night I hit the 20lb mark, and I was very proud of myself. I took another picture and noticed a slight change in my figure, so I thought I'd show you guys

Here's me at 167lb

So, let me know what you think! I've been getting compliments from friends recently saying they'd noticed not only the way I look but how much happier I feel. 

My overall goal weight is still a while away, but this is a start! 

(Also this is an account I don't use, my friends know of my main account and I'm a bit embarrassed for them to see this)

EDIT: oh my god! Just came back from work to see this incredible response from everyone. I am so overwhelmed right now, the compliments and motivational comments are making my day so hard right now.

Definitely inspired me to not necessarily keep losing weight, but to continue to be healthy and healthier throughout the year. Its amazing to know that there is such a large support group out there.

As for my story, we shall start at 340 lbs. me. I was always a big kid and had a good amount of weight because I did the whole sports business in high school, football lineman to name just one. So obviously we were encouraged to be of large stature. Back then it was a mixture of muscle and fat. Then mono hit me and well, it got ugly. Gained 25 pounds over the course of 2 months and went on to play college ball for a whole 3 days before being injured. From there it spiraled out of control and I finally topped the chart junior year of college at 340.

Fast forward to the year after I graduated from school in 2010 and finally fed up with my ginormous self. Determined to finally lose the weight, I decided on South Beach, which motivated my dad to do it along side me. He was my main motivation as well, always helping each other with workouts and meal preparations and whatnot. Through cutting down on carbs and working my ass off at the gym, I went from 340 in October of 2010 down to 220 in May of 2011. If anybody out there needs advice or more importantly, support, let me know. Because as hard as you try to go at this endeavor alone, it's so much better physically and emotionally with somebody at your back.

Edit: Sorry everybody, went to bed last night. Didn't realize I'd have anything would happen so I'll have to get back to the comments after work. Thanks for everything though! I really appreciate it!

I gradually lost the weight.  It took about two years.  I'm down from almost 300 lbs.  I weigh around 175 lbs now.  There are no words to describe how good I feel, both physically and emotionally.

I am a Type 1 Diabetic of almost 20 years.  Changing my lifestyle to help stabilize my diabetes and weight was challenging, but I made my diet and activity changes slowly enough that I wasn't completely overwhelmed.  

I've never really participated much in this subreddit, but today felt like a good time to share my progress with you all.  I'm open to answer any questions you may have. 

Edit:  The post was removed, due to me not following the guidelines appropriately.  I am updating to include more information.

My exercise is mainly being more active (walking my dog, taking the stairs, walking instead of driving, etc.). I've never enjoyed going ""balls-to-the-wall"" when exercising.

My change in diet was the difficult part. I started cooking at home and taking my lunch to work/school. I was able to cut out most snacking. I started eating mostly whole foods (none of that processed, boxed food, although this does happen occasionally). I drink a lot of water, and avoid most carbonated beverages. I love coffee, and I will never give that shit up.

It was a lot of small changes that let to the big changes. One thing at a time. 

Once my blood sugars were regulated (since I got an insulin pump), the weight loos has been much easier.  When my blood sugars were out of whack, I have a very difficult time losing weight.  

All these thing included were very beneficial in my weight loss.  ",,False,,t5_2rz8w,1376427216.0,,120lbs,True,t3_1k9z4k,http://www.reddit.com/r/loseit/comments/1k9z4k/im_feeling_proud_and_a_little_tearful_today_down/,

I'm still pushing along, I know that it takes time, and I know there's a lot of trial and error with diet and exercise. I'm not giving up. 
So, tonight I'm at the gym with the boyfriend, and we're finishing up. There's a woman at the gym who I really look up to because she is INTENSE. Always pushing harder, always taking the regular workout to the next level. She taps me on the shoulder while I'm wiping the lake of swear from my face and says ""I just wanted to let you know you're doing an awesome job, you've made so much progress. When you first started coming here you were hesitant and looked lost. Now you're killing it on the treadmill and you come in with a mission and a drive. It's really awesome to see.""

1357758516.0,526,self.loseit,169hw5,I'm finally ready to share my story. How I got the body of a Greek God.,878,352,88,http://www.reddit.com/r/loseit/comments/169hw5/im_finally_ready_to_share_my_story_how_i_got_the/,"So, I think I am finally ready to share my weight loss journey with the world. For my whole life, I considered myself overweight. From as far back as I can remember, I was always the fat kid. The funny guy that nobody really took seriously. My diet consisted of a Mcdonald's trip every week and fried foods and sweets every other day. My mother always cooked this way, and I knew no other way. I thought it was the norm. I was also an athlete at the time, but the way I ate counteracted all of my physical exercise I was doing, so there was no body change. I also am a huge Theatre geek and knew that's what I wanted to do in my life. However, I was type casted as the comic relief. I knew I would never be the leading guy in anything unless it was a slapstick. In high school, I developed disordered eating which consisted of binging and purging that would be accompanied by bulimia. I wasn't happy to do it, but it made me feel better. This continued all the way through high school and my first two years of college. By my third year of college, I was 5' 10"" and weighed 240 lbs. I was eating whole pizzas like they were nothing, and throwing up Mcdoubles on a weekly basis. By Christmas of 2011, I was at my heaviest of 245 pounds. But Christmas day was when I had my ""waking up"" moment. 

A man came over to the house that was a family friend and said something to me that I will never forget. He was always a morbidly obese guy as far back as I can remember, and not the smartest tool in the box. But he came over for Christmas and said, ""Hey there, getting a little chunky there. You're starting to look me."" I thought, no fucking way. And that was the moment I decided to change the way I looked. Over the next few months, I took baby steps limiting myself on soda and completely eliminating fast food from my diet. (saved a crapload of money!) By March, I had lost about 10 pounds, and felt pretty good about it, but knew I could do a lot better. I began to browse the weight loss subreddits and came across r/keto and r/loseit. (some redditor told me to go to r/keto. They have bacon!) I would read people's success stories and used them for motivation. Unfortunately that's all I did was have motivation and never did anything with it. But at least I was exposed to this kind of lifestyle and that was important for me. But onto the story, I will come back to reddit later on.

My sister always nagged me about my weight, and it would go in one ear and out the other. I would dismiss it and always made myself believe I had everything under control. So I went to her for help, and she was more than willing to oblige. She told me about BMR and certain formulas that showed how to calculate calorie intake to help with weight loss. I decided to give it a try, and it helped tremendously! But on my 21st birthday, my family took me to Las Vegas, and as I was partying in clubs with my sister, I would see all of these beautiful women and they would just dismiss me. They saw me as an overweight guy and would not give me the time of day. It was a kick in the face to me, and I knew that I had a long ways to go. Throughout the next months and into the summer, I took in 200 calories less than I needed, and it helped me lose about 1 pound a week. By the middle of the summer I broke the 200 pound mark, and I was as happy as I could be. I was going on hikes and feeling great. But I wasn't completely satisfied with how I looked, and I was ready to go to the next step. 

In my fourth year of college, I got into an acting program at a college in Illinois, and knew I had to start taking my career seriously. Keep in mind all this time, I've been talking to my sister about my progress and what I needed to be doing. She kept harking on me about a paleo diet. She talked about it all summer, and I was not really on board with it too much. It sounded too extreme and hard for me. But the school I was at announced a play in which there was the part of Poseidon. I wanted it. More than anything I've ever wanted in my life before. I knew that it would take something extreme to get the body I needed for the show. So I got a hold of my sister and told her I think I am ready to try a paleolithic type of diet. This was in August of 2012. Between her and an ex-MMA fighter at school, I was given a diet plan. I would eat 6 meals a day. An omlette and grapefruit for breakfast, a spoonful of coconut butter for a snack, meat and veggies for lunch accompanied by a handful of almonds, coconut butter for another snack, meat and veggies for dinner, and a spoonful of coconut butter before I went to bed. I also incorporated workouts this time. My workouts before were just lifting weights and running long distances. I abandoned weights completely, and did strictly body weight exercises. Pushups and Situps mostly. I incorporated pullups when I was strong enough to do them. I stopped running long distances and stuck only with sprints. This was where I saw the most weight loss. I went from 205 to 189 in those months (August-November) doing just what I listed. I felt great and looked great. It was where I always dreamed to be. But it wasn't Greek God worthy. Not yet anyways.

The paleo way was great for what it was, and I would recommend it to anybody. But I just needed that little extra push, and the primal way of eating did it for me. My sister referred me to Mark's Daily Apple, which was a terrific site. I started keeping track of my Macronutrients and she set me up with a diet program where if I followed it to a tee, then I would get the best results and be in the best shape of my life. She also taught me how to incorporate deadlifts, bench press, and squats in my workouts. I also carb cycled and ate between the hours of 1PM and 9PM. I did what the urbanprimalist did and dropped my weight to 173. And well... why don't you guys see for yourself what it has done for me.

I am a 5 foot 6, 21 year old female. I started at 155 lbs and now have reached my goal of 130 lbs. I went from a size 10-12 to my current size 4.


At the beginning of the summer my boyfriend of 3 years cheated on me. To relieve some stress and spend less time crying I started running every other day. In July I completed my first 5k.


I reduced my calories to 1200 everyday and consumed mostly marinated chicken breasts, broccoli, smoothies and lean cuisines.

After I reached my goal in September I noticed that it was difficult to eat more calories each day. I don't focus as much on calories anymore, I just stop eating when I'm no longer hungry. I take a pink gloves boxing course 3 times a week and that has really made my arms stronger.

Overall I am very happy with the results. Clothes fit better, I am more confident and I sleep better at night.

25 lbs wasn't that much to lose, but it made a pretty big difference on my body. Let me know if you have any questions!

I have been heavy since I was in middle school, I played sports which kept me active but I was always big.  When I stopped playing sports Junior year of high school I started to gain serious weight.  I never weighed myself because I told myself I didn't care what I looked like.  That went on until one year ago today.  I was recently out of a bad relationship and after seeing a friend was on a weight loss plan it just hit me like a ton of bricks.  ""Why can't I do it?""  I threw on a pair of shorts and went and ran on the elliptical for 12 min, that's all I could handle haha.  I weighed myself the next week to see my start weight and the scale read 299.8 lbs.  After a couple days I decided that a round number of 100 lbs sounded like a good goal.  Some people (including my parents) thought this too ambitious and to set an easier goal.  That only pushed me harder.  I downloaded MyFitnessPal (Chard43) and started counting calories.  I ran on the elliptical to start because I had flat feet and wore orthotics in my shoes and couldn't take the pounding of regular running.  I eventually moved onto P90X and continued the elliptical.  I used that program to get me down to about 240-250.  I started to notice I had some real strength so I decided to move on.  I started running outside and doing the workout program Insanity, and realized I needed new running shoes.  When I went out and got a pair I bought ones with proper support in the shoe (Brooks GTS 12's, I love them).  I started running and working out without orthotics!!  This was huge for me, as I'd been wearing them since the beginning of high school and found even walking without them uncomfortable, but I had since rebuilt the muscle in my feet and legs that I no longer needed them.  For a 6'1'' male severely obese is 302lbs, which is basically where I started.  When I dropped below 225 I moved out of Obese.  And to no longer be Overweight, it says I need to be under 190, so that's my new goal.  I still do Insanity and run outside with my new wonderful, beautiful, amazing girlfriend!!

I have been looking forward to sharing this moment with you. Now, 20 pounds is not a lot of weight compared to a lot of people on here but I am pretty damn happy with the progress I have made. This can also be another message to girls who are scared of lifting weights. Lifting weights will not make you bulky!!! So, here is my story: I gained over 20 pounds last summer, drank a few too many beers and ate a few too many McDonald’s burgers. One day in October I just sat down and thought “this needs to change”.


I have a very active family and I have been going to the gym since I was 16, so getting back into the gym was not a challenge at all. I started with doing about 30 minutes of cardio (running, biking, etc) and a little weight lifting. I went to the gym about 3-4 times a week. During the first couple of months I lost about 6 pounds. I found it a little discouraging that it wasn’t losing weight faster so I decided to change up my diet. I had been lurking around r/keto for awhile so it gave me the idea to cut down on carbs in January. Between January and now I have been seeing so much progress with my body. I ended up losing 10 pounds and I really believe it was because I changed my diet. Now I am working on toning my body (lots of weights) but I am still doing 15-20 mins of cardio about 3 times a week. I still eat low carb but I'm not as intense as those on r/keto.


If you have any questions about what I eat or what my workouts are, I will answer in the comments! I didn’t want to make a novel on here.


Now, here are my progress pics...

When i was 9 The doctors told me i had a thyroid problem. They gave me a prescription of Levothyroxine. I need to take a daily dose to regulate my energy and metabolism. If i don't take my pill i can gain weight easily. I didn't understand and didn't care to take my pill, I mean i was just a kid. 
The years went by and the pounds kept stacking on. In December 2011 i went for a check up and to get my thyroid medicine prescribed again.The doctor told me i was ""not only obese, but mortally obese"" 
(i weighed 290) She told me it would take 5 years to be ""normal."" That thought that feeling... it made me cry then and there. I cried for days and that's when i knew i needed to change.

  I started 2012 weighing 290 which was my highest point ever. Only 16 years old 5'5, I was depressed, lost and needed a change.

 I took things slow. At the beginning of the year i still ate some ''junk'' food and didn't eat as healthy as i  could have, but i did try to change my eating habits. on January 16th, 2012 i saw some videos on animal cruelty. i love animals and those videos disgusted me. They made me give up meat. Giving meat up encouraged me to eat healthier foods. Don't get me wrong, meat is actually good for you but for me what worked,  was having no meat. The no meat thing made me not want fast food; hamburgers, pizza, Tacos ext.. I started eating salads, i never really liked salads. Then i added croutons and some cheese and OHH MYY GUSHH Yummy ..lol salad became my new best friend. As for breakfast and snacks i would eat things like apples, grapefruits, rice cakes, light yogurts,  granola bars and silk milk. My lunches and dinners were usually  Salads of course and things like boiled broccoli, coli flour, beans, and vegetable soups. 
Then as I started eating healthier i started drinking lots and lots of water. after a meal I would drink  like 2 cups of water. I usually  drank water, but once in a while drank things like vitamin water and Gatorade but not to often.

 When i felt hungry and wanted more food i would stop.. Think and ask myself ""is it really worth it?"" 
That thought applied as well when i wanted to eat junk food."" is eating 5 pounds back on really worth all my sacrifices?""

 OK, so once I got the whole better eating thing down, I started exercising. I was really fat so It was hard to do many  things but I started easy, 30 min walks 3-4 times a week  i gradually moved on to jogging/walking faster for an hour 5 times a week.
 As the year moved along i decided to try p90x (around April)  the first 2 weeks were great i felt good, but that didn't last i gave up on p90x the people were so fit and i felt so unmotivated. I felt I would never be like them and be able to do what they do. I Quit p90x and continued with my jogging and eating healthier. Then around  late May i started Insanity I did the whole 1st month i lost about 10-15 pounds. (can't remember how much I weighed then)  I started month 2 of insanity and yeah it killed me.. I couldn't keep up and I felt discouraged. I gave up on insanity. In July I started going to the gym 3-4 times a week for at least an hour. I still kept eating healthy and drinking water like crazy. I really pushed myself all of July, August, and September specially since my b-day was in September.
 I  kept going to the gym, until my membership expired in late September. In October i gave up I weighed 240 and around that time I was really depressed. I Ate my pain away. On Halloween I finished my whole bag of candy in one day. I felt sick for a couple days.  I of course gained 5 pounds back to 245 and only 2 months left of the year.
 I knew i had to push myself once again. in November i started Hardcore exercising I joined a Zumba class at my local gym. the class was an hour long. I would go to the gym from 3:30-7:00 pm (i had nothing better to do anyways) I lost 11 pounds which put me down at 234 that month. So finally December came I knew i wanted to end my year strong and start my new year strong as well. i pushed myself beyond my limits and lost 13 pounds.

 My end of the year weight was 221 i felt like it wasn't much until last night i was looking at some pictures and realized how much change my body has gone through.  I gained some confidence, and I'm proud of what I've accomplished. I have a long road ahead of me. 2013 is going to be THE YEAR. I'm going to push myself harder and lose another 69-75 lbs. I'm Going to try not to give up and reach my goal of 150. This year will be the year I look back on in the future. I'm 17 5'5 and i have a long road ahead of me.

Hello, I am Nordicaaron. I enjoy long walks on the beach and bacon by moonlig.... wrong subreddit. I am reposting this because I screwed up the first one. I am a Kentucky boy with a lot of anger and a drive to get what I want. My grandfather said before he died, ""If NA wants something he's going to get it, if not then to hell with it."" It's, to this day, the truest thing ever said about me. This post is about a hitting the 150 milestone of my 400 pound goal. [This is my Original Post](http://www.reddit.com/r/loseit/comments/y4pje/nordicaaron_100_and_keto_the_rest_is_on_the_inside/)

**How I am Doing It**

*All Night Long!* I am doing a modified Keto diet with a base set of carbs at 30 per day. I give myself an extra 10 for a veggie heavy day and an additional 10 for days that I do maxes in the gym. I work out 2-3 times a day for 2.5 hours. It's alot, but it fits my scheduel and is crazy fun. I normally do upper body lifting, run/walk a mile, and then do sprints in the pool OR play basketball/volleyball in the pool.


**Future Goals**

I am going to hit my 400 mark of 266. It's not a goal, it's a valid prophecy!

Thanks for the vote of confidence guys! [I guess you want to see the goods? Yes?](http://imgur.com/a/tHIuo#0)

(5'9""/F/19) Pictures inside!",614,88,123,http://www.reddit.com/r/loseit/comments/1drh5p/lost_72lbs_since_january_59f19_pictures_inside/,"Who is ready for a whole lot of reading?  Jump to the bottom if you don't want the giant back story :)

I've always been a ""big"" girl.  I had horrifically shitty eating habits and turned to food when I was feeling any emotional extreme.  I don't know when I started emotional eating, I just know that I did it a lot over the years.  I've always been pretty shy and insecure, and gaining weight never helped.  But when I was feeling especially insecure, food was there to make me feel better - you can't disappoint a bag of chips, you know?

I started to play basketball competitively in the 3rd grade, already outweighing all of the other girls playing.  I played every year until my junior year of high school where I didn't try out because the coach had nearly ruined the sport for me the previous year.  It didn't matter that I was running around and being an active little kid because after practice, I would go home to a dinner and snacks of pizza, chips, and popcorn all washed down with a soda or two.  For years, that was what I was eating (although the soda consumption went up to quite a bit more than one or two a day).  I started playing volleyball in jr. high and played all through high school.  Not much makes a 7th grade girl feel worse than playing volleyball in short spandex with girls half her size, but I did it because I loved the game and I wasn't bad at it either.  

My weight kept going up and I tried multiple crash diets and diet supplements to try to lose it.  I was trying appetite suppressants before I even made it to high school.  I went on nutrisystem before I got my driver's license.  I was about 250lbs, probably a little more, at the start of my junior year volleyball season when I started nutrisystem.  By the time I quit doing it three months later, I'd lost 30lbs. The problem with nutrisystem is that it doesn't really make you change your real eating habits.  As soon as I quit eating their premeasured cardboard food, I gained it all back, and then some, as that was the year I quit basketball.  My senior year, I was almost cut from my volleyball team by the new coach.  I slipped into the last remaining spot and spent all season trying to prove myself to a woman who'd hated me from the start.  That season sucked and I suspect that I went through a pretty awful depression and was very nearly suicidal at times.  I finished it though and went on to coach the jr. high team that year.  I graduated and went to college where I continued gaining weight, hitting 300lbs two months into my freshman year.  That should have been my wake up call, but it wasn't.  I don't know what my highest weight got up to be, but I know it had to be over 300.  

Cut to late December 2012.  I'd fallen deeply in love with the actors from The Boondock Saints (especially Norman Reedus... hot damn!) and was reading through Sean Patrick Flanery's blogs.  He runs a BJJ studio and is really passionate about health.  In his blogs, he talks about how most people who need to make a change in their lives for their health don't do it and had some rather harsh phrasing.  At first, I was offended and thought he was kind of being a dick, but I realized that I couldn't refute any of the claims he was making.  Those blogs kicked me in the ass and made me figure my shit out (as did this subreddit!).  I got myfitnesspal and began eating as closely to their recommended calorie amounts as I could as well as working out daily.

The weight dropped fast at first because I went from 4-5 cans of soda a day to only drinking water.  I started picking the least evil options from the dining hall, cut out having dessert every night, ate more veggies, and just ate a lot less in general.  I lost 27lbs in the first two weeks.  At this point in time, I was also buying my tickets to go meet The Boondock Saints (and Michael Rooker) in Portland in February.  I wanted to talk to Sean in person and tell him the impact he'd had on my life.

So I kept at it.  I lost around 35lbs from January 8th-February 23rd and I told Sean, thanking him profusely.  He was genuinely proud and excited for me and spoke with me throughout the weekend about it.  That first night, someone at a Q&amp;A asked him what a highlight of his weekend was and he pointed to me and said that hearing about the changes I was making in my life was the best part of his weekend.

He followed me on twitter (shameless plug: @CeraLynAK if anyone wants to follow me... I'm pretty boring) and I started going harder at the gym.  I was planning to see him again in April and I wanted to impress him again.  I lost another 32lbs before I saw him again.  When he saw me, he recognized me immediately and asked how I was doing.  He is the absolute tits, if you were wondering.

And now, a few weeks later, I've officially surpassed my first halfway point!  **I'm down *72lbs* since January because I've completely overhauled my eating habits and work out daily** (cardio 7 days a week and I'm adding in 30-60 minutes of strength training on top of that 3-4 days a week).  I've gone from a jean size 24 to (as of today!) a size 16.  For shirts, I've gone from a 3x down to a 1x (and a unisex large!).  I got hit on in a bar where a guy bought my drinks and tried to get me to come up to his hotel room for the first time in my entire life.  I feel good about myself and you better fucking believe I'm not going to stop until I get to where I want to be.

SW: 300lbs+
CW: 228lbs
GW: 160 and then reevaluate 

[Here's an album with progress pictures](http://imgur.com/a/4cm0D).  I wish I had some from right when I started, but I got upset and deleted them a few weeks in because I couldn't see the difference.  I'm still struggling to see it most days, but I know I have to look different considering I've lost 72lbs.  If you go through the entire thing, you'll get bonus pictures of me meeting Sean, Norman, Rocco, and Michael!

My weight loss story is a very long one, but I'll simplify it a lot and you guys can ask for more details if you want. Between the ages of 16 and 19 I went from 210 to 130lbs, and my life changed dramatically because of it. I bounced around the 130s between ages 19 and 22, occasionally getting down to about 127 before fluctuating back up into the 130s again, and for a while that was ok. After a while I stopped working out and started eating pretty badly again, and I stopped weighing myself and taking measurements. I guess I was just naively hoping that I wouldn't gain any weight back.

About a month ago I went to Italy (second photo from the bottom in my album), and at that point I had gotten back up to 140 for the first time in years, and went from a size 6 to a size 9, probably because I stopped working out and started eating a lot of fatty foods. Well, during my trip this asshole guy called me fat, and although I knew I wasn't fat, that experience made me face the fact that I was gaining weight again. 

Now, here I am roughly 5 weeks later and back down to 130. I've been eating as healthily as possible and working out 6 days a week with *way* more strength training than I was doing before. I feel excellent, and I'm really happy with the way my body looks and feels at the moment. I'd like to get down to 120 and tone up *a lot*, but at the end of the day, the weight doesn't matter much to me. I just want to look fit and feel good!

**Note:** About 6 years passed between my first photo and the last photo, which was taken about a week ago. So, both my weight loss and my gradual aging account for the difference in my appearance.

Not much to say. No rigorous training regimens, no strict diet. I just stopped drinking soda, stopped eating huge meals for the sake of finishing my plate, and decided to bike to work instead of drive everywhere. The only downside is not fitting into any clothes, but that's just an opportunity to reconsider your wardrobe!


The real challenge is now seeing if the lifestyle changes will stick once I start making real money again!

What a perfect form of birth control, no one will want to have sex with you. Haha! :b

In less than a month I went from 168 lbs to 200 lbs. Hence the ridiculous stretch marks. Thankfully they are now fading.  Once I stepped on the scale at the doctors office in Sept and saw where I was, I almost had a heart attack. So, I decided I would do what I had to do to get back in shape. 

I started counting calories (between 1000 to 1200) primarily. That helped me drop off the first few pounds. Afterwards I started working out more. I have always worked out, but not as hard as I do now. In the mornings I do P90x and in the evenings I do the 30-day shred. In between or late at night I will throw in a 30+ minute walk or run/jog. 

I finally hit 175 and wanted to show some progress, I can see it a little, but overall not a lot.

Good luck everyone with your weight loss goals!

*ALSO, I DO NOT EVER RECOMMEND THIS SHOT FOR ANYONE.*

Edit: Was not expecting so much feedback. Also Several people were posting about me posting a nude photo for attention. I would like to tackle those comments here. I posted nude for 2 main reasons. The first reason was because you can see the best overall progress when you show your full body and the second being that I want other people to see that I am by no means perfect, I am working to lose weight but I am still expressing confidence in my body. I want everyone to realize, regardless of how skinny you are or how much excess skin or stretch marks you have, you should e confident in you. I hope I inspired a few people to be more confident if nothing else, dealing with a few bashers was worth it if I helped anyone at all. Also, I'm relatively sure most of us in this thread know what gender specific assets looks like, I have no idea why nudity would be a big deal.

I am sorry if I didn't reply to some of your posts, I have been trying to keep up with every ones but a few have slipped through the cracks. I want to thank everyone for their encouragement and I hope we can continue to inspire each other. If anyone has any questions or suggestions they can feel free to post here or message me. c:",,True,,t5_2rz8w,1355385124.0,,25lbs,True,t3_14on38,http://www.reddit.com/r/loseit/comments/14on38/f2252_down_from_200_lbs_to_175_lbs_nudity/,

NSFW,627,107,65,http://www.reddit.com/r/loseit/comments/1jmmns/f21_and_longtime_lurker_with_my_first_post_at_day/,"Throughout my teenage years I had a very unhealthy relationship with food, exercise and my body image. I always kind of just powered through any teasing or negative thoughts surrounding how I look and ignored the fact that I was making myself more unhealthy every day. Whenever I thought about the necessity to start taking care of myself, there were the two conflicting narratives in my head of 'you need to be more healthy!' and 'I'll begin down this road tomorrow...'. 

Since joining reddit a little while ago I found this subreddit and was just in awe of all your amazing stories; seeing other people be so strong and determined is so bloody inspiring! 


So 60 days ago I finally thought enough is enough. I was at 253lbs when I began (my heaviest weight yet) and started by joining a gym. Once I'd paid for the gym my mentality was there is no turning back - as a student, the money leaving my account for good was inspiration enough! My boyfriend left for Bangladesh 69 days ago (for just over 3 months) and another big inspiration was that without him seeing me every day, I wanted to get my health back on track enough that he might notice when he gets back, haha! 
But ultimately, this is for me and my future :D 


So I began at 253lbs (115kg) and 60 days later I am at 220lbs (100kg) and I get a bit overwhelmed at my progress as I never *ever* thought I could do this. 
I go to the gym 3/4 days a week for a bit of cardio (only about 40 minutes a session); brisk walking uphill, rowing, elliptical trainer and various bikes. 
I have pretty much cut out any sugary soft drinks (or any higher calorie drinks like juices), any junk food, chocolate, crisps, cheese, sweets, chips etc - all the regular culprits. I do give myself treats but I'd like to think I'm quite sensible about things; low cal crisps like Walkers baked, I do treat myself to chocolate (often Kitkats), when I fancy something with cheese etc I will use low fat versions, extra light mayo, oil spray when cooking etc. One of my biggest weaknesses is Mexican food so I replace anything tortilla based with the huge lettuce leaves to wrap my food in/scoop up - maybe a bit odd haha, but it works for me! Where I would have huge amounts of rice/pasta/etc I make a layer of salad on the plate first and just have a small amount of rice etc... It still feels like I'm having a good hearty meal without the large amounts of calories I just don't need. 
But the most amazing thing I've found is I actually **love** this new exercise regime and lighter food lifestyle; I'm really enjoying this journey, I still have a lot of my favourite foods, just in more inventive, lighter ways and it's a fun challenge.

It is difficult at times, I will not lie. Making myself get up and go to the gym some mornings/evenings when I'm tired from work... Seeing food I want to eat but know I shouldn't... BUT comparing my pictures from when I started 60 days ago with the ones I just took today make it all worth it. 

So here we are; 253 to 220 in pictures. I know it's not a lot and I have a long way to go but I thought I'd post them anyway :)

My method was calorie counting and working out.  I trained pretty hardcore 4-5 days a week last summer for the Chicago Triathlon, and continued working out 2-3 days a week over the winter. I stopped counting calories over the winter and plateaued for the most part with small losses here and there.  I got back on track this spring with training for the triathlon but was then sidelined due to an injury.

Earlier in the summer I was playing softball several times a week, working out 3 days a week, training for a triathlon and an obstacle course mud run.  Unfortunately at the end of June I tore my meniscus and partially tore my ACL, meaning I just had to get knee surgery a week ago.  It's been frustrating being laid up, but after plateauing for most of the past winter and spring, it has actually caused me to focus on my diet and eating a lot more, as well as my upper body and core.

My advice to people just beginning their journey would be to make sure to include weight lifting in your routine, and women, please, lift heavy! Don't worry about getting bulky because it's not very possible without the use of steroids. I literally, until I took today's progress pictures and measurements, had no idea of the hourglass figure I was developing. Largely thanks to lifting heavy at the gym, with about 20-30 minutes of cardio at the end of my workouts.

Aside from the physical changes, socially I've made a lot of changes too. I still have wavering self-confidence and am shy, but I joined OKCupid about 8 months ago and have had some success dating through the site, so I recommend that to anyone looking to get back out into the dating world as well!

Sometimes I'm over, sometimes I'm under, but I'm usually close. Other than that, I've stuck to portion control, trying to cut out processed food, and I started walking on my breaks at lunch.

I have been walking at a 12% incline at a 4.0 mph speed. Recently, I've upped those to 13.5% and 4.5, respectively. Starting this week, I began doing a little weight training. Nothing major, but it has major effects.

I've been reading about the FA movement for a while now, and the more I read into it the more I start becoming frustrated with what they say. It's very true that fat people shouldn't be discriminated against unless there's an obvious reason to do it (ie not letting fat people onto a professional sports team). But so many FA organizations veer off into complete denial that being fat is usually not a good thing. They trash the medical community for labeling obesity as an epidemic and having a negative attitude towards it. They trash the research community for supposedly ""unfairly"" associating obesity with health problems. A lot of them even trash any mention of diet and exercise, saying that it solves a ""disease that doesn't exist"".

I know that it's difficult to be overweight in today's society, since I was fat once too (and still kind of am). But while I won't discriminate against the obese, I'm having trouble understanding how they don't see that there are legitimate health problems with it - and that this is an epidemic that we should be fighting.

In highschool my friends and I would have sleepovers where we ate pizza and chips, and I gained more. I got up to 137lbs in grade 12, which was a lot on my 5'1"" frame.

In my first year of university, I joined the rugby team and went down to 130lbs, but I quickly gained that back when the season was over. I spent the rest of the year unhappy with my weight, especially because my boyfriend had a six-pack and was in perfect shape.

Second year university, I joined the rugby team again, and like last year, I lost 7lbs. However, this year, I decided to keep it off. I started counting calories with loseit.com on November 18th and since then I've lost another 13lbs.

**My Diet:**

I've always loved to cook, so I started making the effort to cook with healthier ingredients. I eat much of the same food as before, but I pay attention to portion sizes and I rarely go back for seconds.

For Breakfast, I typically eat greek yogurt and kashi cereal, but sometimes I have oatmeal.

For Lunch I have either Campbell's Garden Tomato Soup (and I add my own frozen corn) with celery and carrots, or 2 veggie hotdogs with celery and carrots.

Dinner I eat whatever me and my boyfriend (Gus) want, keeping in mind portion size. In the past week I've had Macaroni and Cheese, Quesadillas, Chili,  Chicken Souvlaki and Pesto Pasta. I always make lower calorie versions of these foods, but keep the taste the same.

For Snacks, I typically eat Bananas, Oranges, Jello or Celery with Soy Butter.

Recently, I hit my second Plateau and I decided to try Intermittent Fasting. My plateau broke in two days. 

**Exercise**

I've been slacking a bit with exercise lately, but typically I go to the gym 4 times a week. I run for 20 minutes and then do 40 minutes to 1 hour of weights, alternating between ""upper-body"" ""abs"" and ""legs"" days. I do all the [/r/fitness](/r/fitness) approved exercises like squats. 


So, without further ado, here are the pictures:

I've gotten here by hard work, determination, stubbornness and a drive to get to my goals that I didn't even know was inside of myself until recently. 

My story is like many others. I have been overweight for a large portion of my life. In high school I weighed 200lbs and from there it continued to creep up over the years. In college my weight skyrocketed to 300lbs after I began medication after medication for my generalized anxiety disorder, panic attacks and depression. The medicine turned me into a zombie and an eating, lazy, couch bum.  (I have learned to cope with my anxiety on my own through breathing techniques and relaxation because I can't stand what the meds do to me) 

Go ahead to just 3 years ago and I was 310lbs and I got pregnant. I was excited but shit, I was 310lbs!  My doctor made me ""high risk"" automatically because of my weight and at every appt he almost expected me to get gestational diabetes or have some complication but I never did. I had a completely normal pregnancy, but I maxed out at 340lbs.  After having my daughter and losing the baby weight I hovered between 315-320. 

Then, on September 24, 2012, I was at work and I started getting this weird tingling sensation in my chest. I didn't think much of it at first but then it intensified. I finally went to a urgent treatment center and one ambulance ride later to the hospital and who knows how many tests later I was NOT having a heart attack, but I got one big fucking WAKE UP CALL! 

Sometimes I get mad with myself that it wasn't having a kid or getting over 300lbs that made me get off my ass but thinking that at 32 I was having a heart attack that did, but I'm glad something did. I guess for me I needed something big to scare me into action. Literally. 

I track my calories religiously. Whether I am over or not. And if I go over, oh well. Next meal will be better. I went through the Couch to 5k program starting in Oct 2012 and finished in January 2013. It was slow at first but it was a huge accomplishment to be able to run 5k. I've been running since then and doing DDP Yoga, but recently began the Insanity workout program which I told myself I would do when I hit 250lbs. 

Also, I couldn't have gotten this far without the amazing support and inspiration from you all here on r/loseit and MFP. Thank you!

Here's to the next 71lbs and to reaching my GW of 175lbs!

My worst fear is being recognized in this post, but whatever. Here I am. It's my 23rd birthday, and I'm proud of my hard work!

Devout Weight Watcher for 4 years but recently transitioned into low carb, high fat/protein vegetarian eating combined with HIIT pilates 4 days/week and I am so happy. I am not at my goal yet (18% body fat), but I find myself happier and peacefully content knowing that I am moving in the right direction and that I am stronger this week than I was the week before. I am about to introduce lifting through Starting Strength to maximize muscle building. Any advice for a beginner is welcome!


I've battled food addiction, emotional eating, and a lifetime of the ""I deserve this"" attitude. It took four years to reprogram my brain towards healthy, clean eating, and I still battle it. Perhaps I always will. But I can control today and tomorrow as best I can, and that gives me peace.

Started 246. Now 171 (and falling). Feel free to ask questions!

Well, I'm not quite at my weight loss goals yet but I wanted to post this given all the New Year's Resolution folks who are kicking off their journey. First: you can do it. Second: **you have to choose things that you will do for the rest of your life.** If you are thinking, ""I'll just do Diet X until I lose the weight"" you will gain it back. Trust me: I know.

I'm a 24 year old (about 5' 11.5"") who works in the web which means sitting at my desk most of the day. Some days I work from home which only means I move even less. My weight started creeping up on me in high school (around 190), took its toll in college (around 235), and then once the real world hit me, I was at 246.6 pounds. I don't even think that was my heaviest, thats just when I decided to start tracking.

I tried a *ton* of diets (slow carb, no carb, I won't name names) and none of them really worked for me. They were far too restrictive which meant I couldn't keep up with them. I travel for work which means, a lot of times, I'm stuck eating airport food. I needed a way to make healthy choices on the go and at home.

My wife actually introduced me to [""The Best Life Diet""](http://www.amazon.com/Best-Life-Diet-Revised-Updated/dp/B002PJ4I52/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1325511829&amp;sr=8-1) which changed my life. This isn't so much as a diet as it is a set of simple rules and phases to eeeaassee you into a healthier diet. The tips and tricks are essentially what Reddit has been saying for quiet some time but I think one of the biggest tips is **make small changes that you can keep but then add onto those changes as you**. You won't be successful if you try to deprive yourself of EVERYTHING you once loved.

The book eases you in through three phases. I followed Phase 1 exactly, Phase 2 I added a ""no high fructose corn syrup"" rule. In Phase 3, I started counting my calories using [LoseIt](http://www.loseit.com). Counting calories doesn't work for everyone but I found it absolutely crucial for me. You can't lie to the numbers. It also makes troubleshooting both foods and your exercise through raw numbers.

I only dieted for about three months before I got into running. At first, I couldn't really run. I'd run for like... 30 seconds and then want to kill myself. Another tip I learned: **walk run is a perfectly acceptable starting point**. Its all about getting your heart rate up. When you are out of shape, your heart rate will go up to the needed levels while walking fast where, nowadays, I need to run at a pretty fast clip (for me) to get my heart where it used to be. I know cardio isn't for everyone but I loved running because it gave me goals that were personal: my race times I was competing against myself. I've since run a half marathon and am looking to run 3 or 4 more half marathons this year and a full in October. *But let me be clear:* I run that much because I actually enjoy running. For weight loss, you don't need to do the amount of running I do (30+ miles per week).

Most recently, I started adding in a few strength routines. I know /r/fitness preaches Starting Strength but I can't get myself to do that on my own. I just know, for me, its something I'm uncomfortable starting without being taught. I've done a few simple routines on my own (and given by my running coach) but recently found [DailyBurn](http://www.dailyburn.com). I love their routines and found them great for me. Another great site is [BodyRockTV](http://www.bodyrock.tv/). There are tons of options for you to start, but again, you have to pick something that you want to do! I've tried a few of the P90X (and etc) programs and for me, I don't get really excited about it. They seem like sooo much work for the goal of ""GETTING RIPPPPEED"". Do I want to look hot on the beach? Hell yes. But I need something that I'm not going to scoff to do every day. YMMV.

Now, to be clear, I think what the folks in /r/fitness say makes a lot of sense. But I think when you're just starting to lose weight **don't overcomplicate things**. You need to eat a little less, burn a little more, and more lifestyle choices.

I have about 8 lbs left to go (give or take) before reaching my original ""racing weight"" goal for running. That'll likely go just a little lower to get my body fat under control. I don't have all the answers, I just know what worked best of me. Total disclosure: I'm sort of at a plateau right now so I'm posting this both for you and me. A little motivation to kick it up a few more notches to get the last few lbs off.

tl;dr.

* Choose a healthy diet that you can do for the rest of your life. Lean meats, lots of veggies, some fruit, whole grains. Boom, done.
* Pick a physical activity you enjoy and just kill it. For me: Running. For you: pick something you're excited about.
* Augment your ""chosen"" physical activity with its compliment. (Mainly weights: add a little cardio. Mainly cardio: add a little weights.)",,False,,t5_2rz8w,False,,75lbs,True,t3_nzrlx,http://www.reddit.com/r/loseit/comments/nzrlx/i_lost_75_pounds_and_got_way_healthier_photoshow/,

The pictures from before were taken in the summer of 2010. The after pictures are from last weekend.

In October 2010 I hit 120KG (265lb) for the first time. That was the moment I decided to change. I had already subscribed to some of the weight loss and sports subreddits, but for some reason never thought I could do it too. Then I came accross this post and decided to finally give it a try:
http://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/d02dq/how_to_lose_fat_a_beginners_guide/

I started counting calories, stopped going everywhere by car and started walking, a lot. I averaged about 10 KM (6 miles) a day. I also switched to water only and began eating healthier. Six months later I had lost about 20KG (44lb) and bought a mountainbike. I got addicted to sports and soon after started swimming and running.

I reached my initial weight goal of 85KG (187lb) almost exactly a year later, in October 2011. Since then I continued swimming/biking/running and just finished my first triathlon in 1:15:54 (400m/18K/4.2K). At the moment I am at about 80KG (176lb).

It's been a while since I posted on here, so here's an update.  I've been cycling to work almost everyday, and it makes me feel great.  I switched to a faster bike, and now I want to help support a good cause.  If my story can inspire even one person, I'll have felt accomplished.  

This is my page, with my story:
http://main.diabetes.org/goto/dominathan

&gt;I have been overweight my entire life.  

&gt;My entire family was above the overweight line, and most of us were well into the obese category.  At my worst, I weighed over 290lbs, way over the obese body fat percentage.  My maternal grandfather and one of my great-grandmothers were also diagnosed, but they passed before I was born.  Both of my grandmothers were diagnosed with Type 2 diabetes, both of whom I watched suffer until they both passed away from unrelated causes. I knew diabetes was a possibility for me, and honestly, I was sick of being limited to what I could do because of my size.

&gt;One of the biggest epiphanies for me was watching the documentary, ""King Corn"".  When I saw high fructose corn syrup, and seeing all the corn in our diet, it really made me want to change.  I started eating foods without HFCS, and I stopped drinking soda, but I wanted to do more.  I have always hated running, but I knew I needed to do it.  I started a RunKeeper account to track my progress, and little by little, I watched those times get faster.  I made it a challenge to myself, to beat yesterday's time.  I learned that if you want something enough, you'll do everything you can.  I was doing it for me, which I learned was the most motivating.  I learned to face the pain of discipline, or face the pain of regret.  If I failed, I failed myself.  I made my goal for 80lbs, to be 200lbs.  I was really busy with my last semester of University, but I made time to do it.  A lot of my runs happened after 2am, 4 times a week.  As the cold Indiana winter kicked in, it was under 10F when I would run, and I just couldn't do it anymore.  I stopped in December, when all of my Senior projects were due, and I had even more on my plate.  Then I graduated, and moved out here, to California.  I tried to restart my running, but I felt like I had even less time to do it, plus I didn't have a good path like I used to.  I made excuses, and the move was really hitting me.  I started to use this time to really work on my diet.  I was able to focus on higher quality foods, and I really worked on Portion Control.  

&gt;This was my third attempt at losing the weight.  The first two times, I did exercise and stuck to a lot of greens.  Both times I lost weight, but I gained it all back plus more each time.  I love to eat everything, so if I wanted to have it, I had to learn to portion.  I knew if this was going to stick, I'd have to have a lifestyle change.  By May, I was 225lbs.

&gt;I first started walking around the path behind my work, and mid May, I started running around it twice a week.  It was perfect, 1.5 miles.  In August, it was going to be one year since I started doing it, and I wanted to meet my goal.  I had 2 months to loose 20lbs, so I had to ramp up my efforts.  I knew I lived fairly close to work, so I decided to start biking to work.  

&gt;I bought a used hybrid bike online the last weekend of June, and on my test run on Sunday, I flew over my handlebars.  I had a huge bruise on my left thigh, but otherwise I was fine.  I didn't bike that Monday, but I did the rest of that week.  I biked almost every single day, tracking my progress just like my runs.  Everyday I pushed myself harder, and I saw my route times get shorter, and my top speeds get faster.  Then, in the first week of August, I weighed myself.  Words can't describe the feeling of happiness when I saw the first digit to be a ""1"".  I did it!  I met my goal, but I didn't want to stop.  The lowest I had been since puberty was 177, when I first lost weight.  I had no idea how low I could go.  I made a new goal of 180lbs, putting me at losing an even 100lbs.  By mid-September, I passed that goal.  I realized I couldn't base it off my weight, so I said I'm ""finished"" with losing weight when I could see a 6-pack. As I looked at myself in the mirror, however, I really started to notice the change.

&gt;I couldn't recognize myself at all.  In my head, I was still my larger self.  Overcoming the change in appearance was one of the hardest aspects for me, mentally.  As I continued to loose more weight, I felt more agile, quick, and responsive.  I had no idea what my body was capable of. 

&gt;By December, I had gotten scraped up, bruised, sprained, hit by a car, hit by another bike, and had my friend's bike break in two right under me.  Even with all of this, I kept going, but as the holidays kicked in, I took some rest from everything, and just enjoyed myself.  I wasn't biking, but I started introducing a strength workout of push-ups, pull-ups, cruches, and leg lifts.  I did as many reps as I could, and if I felt like I could do more, I did.  I didn't want to let myself down, so I always pushed myself.  

&gt;As the new year started, I resumed my biking with my first road bike.  When I rode to work on this bike, I was much faster than my hybrid.  I currently weigh 165lbs, and now that I finally feel like I'm done losing weight, I want to push myself to see what I'm capable of.  I've never done anything of this magnitude my entire life, but if I even help one person, I will feel complete.  I want to help people, inspire them, let them know they really do have the power to change anything.  If there was one thing I learned throughout this journey, it was that if you really do put your mind to it, you can accomplish anything.  Now I was to see what I can accomplish, and knowing that I will help people will make it all the more worthwhile.

EDIT2:  I've read a lot of comments from LoseIt (in general) that losing weight is 80% diet, 20% exercise.  When I worked on my eating habits, I had to cut a lot, but I still wanted to enjoy great food.  The first step was eliminating **high fructose corn syrup**.  It's EVERYWHERE, seriously.  Bread, peanut butter, you name it!  This, however, made most of my shopping more expensive.  Honestly, the fact that I was able to reduce my weight so much by just spending more money on food really made me think about the garbage companies put in their foods to make them so cheap (almost conspiracy-level).  I switched to a lot of organic foods, too.  This also eliminated most fast food, though, higher end fast food was ok once in a while (on cheat days), which is In-n-Out, chik-fil-a (not fried!).  While I was pushing really hard for weight loss, I ate 3 meals a day, but I'd have a moderate breakfast, a smaller lunch (sometimes a salad or a wrap, or sometimes I would stagger 2 cliff bars around 12pm and 3pm (usually because I missed lunch at work, or I left my wallet at home)), and a moderate dinner.  The fact that I would always eat an hour or 2 before biking somewhere helped control how much I ate as well.  Btw, Cliff bars are awesome for nutrients and emergency food.

First of all, I'd just like to say how amazing y'all are.  I discovered Reddit &amp; r/loseit shortly after I started my weight loss journey, and this community has been nothing but motivational, inspirational, and supportive.  Thank you from the bottom of my heart.


I've been hesitant to show you guys progress pictures because I wanted to be 100% ""done"" with my transformation before I did.  I am close to my goal weight, but I've realized that my body transformation may never really be ""done"".  I want to make my body as awesome as it can be and push my physical limits, and that might take me the rest of my life.  Both my friend and I have been struggling a little lately keeping up with our new healthy lifestyle, so she put these two pictures next to each other last night and it made me realize how far we both have come.  So, I had to share!  :)



[HERE](http://i.imgur.com/cDRiD.jpg) is our progress!  The first picture was taken two years ago on my birthday (I am on the left in both pictures).  The second picture was taken this past weekend.

**Our stats:**  I am 5'4"" and 23 years old; I started at 170(ish) lbs and am now 128(ish) lbs.  My ultimate goal weight range is 118-120 lbs and/or to have a flat tummy.  She is 5'2"" and 24 years old; she started at 210 lbs and is now 155 lbs.  I'm not sure what her ultimate goal is, but she is focusing on losing another 20 lbs right now.

**How we did it:**  I started Weight Watchers last August on a whim because I had seen some of my friends on Facebook have success with it, and WW were having a promotional deal.  My friend started shortly after I did.  I quit WW after the three months I paid for expired and started counting calories with MyFitnessPal.  My friend is still doing WW, but is also counting calories.  We both have not been consistent with exercise for the duration of our weight loss, but I have been consistently lifting (Starting Strength) for about a month now and love it.

I'll be happy to answer any other questions, but I will be out of the office for most of the day and may not get to them until this evening. My friend is not a redditor, but I am pretty familiar with her journey as well as my own (I asked permission to post this, don't worry).

Love you guys--keep up the awesome work!

Sure, it was a bit *diety,* but all in all pretty damn good for the calorie count it *claims* to have. 

This all seemed a bit too good to be true, so I went to Google to do a bit more research. Turns out at least two of the flavors (Vanilla Maple and Chocolate Peanut Butter) have more calories than they claim - 46% and 68% respectively. This was proven in tests performed by EMSL Analytical, Inc. after NBC did an investigation. It has caused two class action law suits to be filed against the company - http://www.topclassactions.com/lawsuit-settlements/lawsuit-news/2477-second-arctic-zero-class-action-lawsuit-filed-over-calorie-count-

Now even with the elevated calorie counts, Arctic Zero still falls below other ice cream brands in terms of calorie count, but I thought I'd spread the good word just in case any of you are sitting down to a pint each day thinking you're eating 150 calories when in fact you're eating 252 (an extra 714 calories uncounted for each week - totaling a full pound every 5 weeks.)

Nearly a year ago, I started on a journey to lose weight. I had gained 100 lbs in the past 9 years, and I was tired of being fat. Looking at the math, it was like I gained 1 lb every month for 9 years. It's funny how it can sneak up on you with something as simple as 1 lb per month.

My real inspiration was my daughter. She was about to be 7-months-old, and I didn't want her growing up with a fat dad. And I didn't want to be a fat dad. And having once been 225 lbs, I could tell that my overall spirit had diminished over the years. I wasn't happy. It's depressing to be fat.

I started working out on April 25, 2011. I was 316 lbs. My end goal was 225 lbs, but I really wanted to lose 80 lbs by my daughter's 1st birthday, which was only 6 months away. It meant that I needed to lose 2.5-3 lbs a week, which seemed impossible...yet somehow doable.

I started working out. I completely changed my diet. I was relentless about working out and eating right. It was a complete life change. The toughest part was the diet. I was addicted to sweet drinks. But all the hard work paid off and I hit my goal of losing 80 lbs in 6 months.

Since then, I have lost another 15 lbs or so. But I'm not really trying to lose weight any more. I am at my target weight, and I feel comfortable  with my body. It's a great feeling, and I wanted to share my story.

Last night I was out with a couple female friends of mine and a big group of their friends.  I got up to go to the bathroom and grab another drink, and when I returned, a very cute girl was talking to them; apparently she was an acquaintance of theirs.  After she left, one of my girls says to me, ""She only came over to ask who you were.  She said you were really cute.""  So I started running a little game on her and got the digits.

I usually do okay with women, but my success to this point has been all interaction/personality based.  It felt awesome to have a hot girl just notice me like, ""Ooo, who's that guy?..."" without me even having to open my mouth.

Hopefully that's a sign of things to come.  I could live with more of that.  :)

I am 5'10"", 27 years old, and after going through a big gym phase when I was 18-21 years old (weighed 190 lbs and looked pretty damn good), I let myself go, and by 25 I was 260 pounds.  I've been using the LoseIt! app to count calories and I've picked up running as a hobby.  I actually just ran my first half marathon a few days ago!  Occasionally, if I plateau for more than a few weeks, I will switch over to the Slow Carb Diet, from ""The 4 Hour Body"" (Tim Ferriss), for a couple weeks to jumpstart the loss again.

My biggest hurdles are late-night junk eating.  I've almost completely kicked the habit, and the binge sessions are few and far between, but occasionally the Taco Bueno and Braum's Ice Cream demons will get to me.  But I just look at it as one bad meal in a sea of lots and lots of healthy meals.  I just get right back on the horse in the morning.

This is my first post here, so yeah... here how it goes:

Im that kind of person that i eat and i dont really care how people look at me. Im a happy, jolly fellow that has a 42"" waist and 250lbs. Didnt do any sports and just stayed home and played with my console games.

So... my [mum](http://i.imgur.com/2QChGBJ.jpg) being a health buff, retired and a constant gym goer at the age of 54, started a bet. She said for every pound i lose she'll give me money... so that kinda inspired me... but not really. I went together with her on the gym. Got my weight fluctuate with a couple of pounds or two, but i still eat really sinful food... til i went for Wendy's for a postworkout meal.

As it turned out, i ate a tinted burger. That was friday when i had food poisoning. I was living inside my toilet for two days. i was vomiting and flushing all my intake. Until Monday came, i lost 20lbs, dehydrated. Went for a checkup and the doctor said it was lucky i was still alive... and dont you know it, i got sexier! lol

I still go for workouts now and then after that. I still dont have a strict diet and I still kept on eating donuts and cake. Until a new physical trainer started to work in the gym. She's a marathoner too. So i had this crush and she invited me to a couple of [runs](http://i.imgur.com/gDF6Faq.jpg). I decided to follow her even i had asthma. After that heart-broken but I still decided to continue running even i ate a bucket of ice-cream.

I dont tend to watch my weight. I dont care how i look, I dont care if im developing muscles, i dont care... All i know was im enjoying this lifestyle and thats all. I met new friends while running plus while in the gym. Nothing changed... im still happy, jolly. Til my usual checkup need to know my weight. My doctor was surprised too with all the change i made... She said I lost 80lbs since the food poisoning incident...

...80lbs... wait... my mum made a wager! and i forgot.

End story, i didnt get my money coz she said the praises are good enough...(yeah, right). Still running marathons, usual runs in the morning. As for diet, i dont do it. its like Die with a +. I dont intake protein shakes, or any supplement. Just my normal multivitamins and thats all. I still eat like a Filipino, or any other asian... lots of rice. It stresses me out to keep track at everything i eat. I still pig out, hence the cake... now im with the British Dragonboat team here in Singapore coz i feel i want some new sport not involving buying another set of shoes.

Oh, yeah. only downside: If i didnt manage to do any physical activity, i get sick the next day... like droopy, flu-y, stuck in bed - sick.

I dont want to be a preacher like my those physical trainers in the gym who'll want to get you moving and try to make you have a strict diet... I hate those people.

They feature a comedian named Debbie. She eats healthy food, exercises, but remains overweight. She thinks she has slow metabolism, but measuring her CO2 output shows her metabolism is normal. So they have her keep a video food diary for 4 days, and a written diary for 5 days. They also have her drink something called [doubly labeled water](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doubly_labeled_water) throughout the day, and they take urine samples which measure exactly how many calories she's been eating and how many she has burned, because of the labeled water.

At the end of the period, they compared what she thought she was eating with the actual caloric measurements - she was eating 3,000 calories, but with the video diary she thought she was only eating 1,100! With the written diary she wrote down that she was eating 1,700 calories, when she was actually eating 3,000.

I celebrated by buying myself a leather hole punch from Michael's and putting two more notches on my belt. 


I started along this path at 320lbs and this was what prompted my decision to get back into shape. 


My birthday is close to Valentines day and I was excited to A) have a significant other to share my birthday with and B) finally to not be single on Valentines day. My ex and I got into a fight the weekend before my birthday, and when she gets angry she tends to say mean and very hurtful things. 


These things were along the lines of 

""You will always be a fat loser""

""No one will date a disgusting fat ass like you"" 

""You will die alone you fat fuck"" 


Now I've been called names in the past and it has never bothered me until now, but this situation was different, we had been in a year long relationship and I thought we were genuinely in love and to hear those terrible words coming out of her mouth absolutely devastated me. We ended up breaking up, I spent my birthday and valentines day alone. 


February 1st I decided that it was time to show her how wrong she was and exactly what she lost. I signed up at a gym close to my work and I walk there from work every day (approx 4 blocks) and I'm there for at least one hour a day with 30 minutes of that time doing as much cardio as I can physically handle. 


When I started on the stationary bike, I could not go 5 minutes without being absolutely winded. I slowly worked my way up to 10 minutes, then 20 minutes and now I'm at 30 minutes doing 75-85RPM @ Level 12 on the stationary bike, which equates to around 600cal/hour.

**tl;dr** Ex told me I'll always be fat and die alone. In February alone I've lost 21lbs and counting.

**EDIT://** Thank you all for your great words of wisdom and support. Now that I have hit my first goal I do realize that this is a journey that I must do for myself and no one else.

I hated them for that decision, it came like a surprise. They called mom one day and said ""Tomorrow 8:30AM your son will be moved to a foster family"". Without a warning i also got to know it so we broke down and started packing for me, we just took it as it was. We knew it was coming. So when i arrived to this family they noticed that i was really sad and overweight. (I weighted 242lbs at the moment). So the ""father"" of the family told me that we were going to start training. And i was like ""nope... never i can't do it, i can't even walk up a stair without getting sweaty."". That father never gave up though and now has made me loose 50lbs.

EDIT 1: NOTE ----&gt; Iam 14 Years Old atm. 15 in 3 months! &lt;----

EDIT 2: Thanks for all of the nice comments, it makes me get motivation and i can keep on to loose weight with this motivation. For anyone wondering what i have been doing to lose weight here it comes. I have lost weight because i started taking promenades 4 or 5 times a week with the foster family father. after 2 weeks of promenades we started going 7 days a week. I walked monday and tuesday in school instead of being in the gymnastics lessons. I also didn't eat all candy and all the sweet stuff, i kept myself back on those. I eat normal food tho, i eat every food that get served to the table, but in smaller portions. I have now started to run a little when i took promenades and iam now in the Gymnastics Lessons, especially on the workout parts. I do some pushups and situps every night before i go to sleep now also. Which has helped me a lot. I have started to be more active and iam also ice skating 1 time a week. It is not an hard ""routine"" at all. But i have really been fighting to lose 50 pounds in 4 months which is quite a goal for me.

I never danced. I lost all my self-confidence to do things like that in front of others that I had as a kid when I started packing on the pounds in adolescence. I didn't dance at weddings, not even my sister's wedding. I didn't dance at dances at school, I avoided going to clubs if I could weasel my way out of it. If I couldn't, I'd sit at a table or in a corner, and sort of tap my feet to the beat, but that was it. I couldn't bring myself to be the fat girl on the dance floor with her skinny friends, or the fat girl all alone with no guy, or the fat girl at the party pushing others out of her way. The potential shame and embarrassment was too great.

And as people who have lost weight know, even after losing 40 pounds, and getting in better shape, I still have a lot of those ""fat girl feelings"". And because I never considered dancing, and now I don't know WTF the do on a dance floor, I figured why start now.

But last night, the department I work for had their holiday party. And it's a lot of young people, and the dance floor was hopping, the DJ was good. And I said F**K IT. I got up and danced. For two hours. TWO HOURS. It was magical. I was sweating, but I wasn't breathing hard. It was an electrifying feeling. I even went so far as MAKING an ass of myself: I did Opa Gangnam Style (damn well, too), and some other silly things, in addition to some two-step and salsa, and general get-your-boogie-on. 

I went home to my boyfriend and I cried, because I finally got up and danced. 

Tl;DR Former chubby finally lost her fat girl feelers and got her groove back.

EDIT: front page! To people who want to dance, it's taken me almost two decades to get back on the dance floor, so I know it's easier said than done to ""just dance"".

In 2009 I was 16 going on 17 and I was at my maximum weight of 497 pounds.

I say moderation, because enjoying yourself is still important.

I went from size 60 pants to a 38.

I'd love to know what you think. If you're wondering about exercise, I started out just walking a mile every day.

I started losing grips on my diet first, eating worse food, but still trying to work out. My bad diet led to me not being able to keep up with rigorous workouts anymore. I half assed workouts for a few days in a row, gave up and tried again until I lost all control. For the first month weight gain was minimal. Then it spiraled out of control. I now weigh 200 pounds and even though it's far below my previous 250, I'm ready to finish what I started a year and a half ago.

It can be very easy to get comfortable after a big transformation and think that taking a little time off wont hurt, or you owe it to yourself to have a reward, or saying ""as long as I'm not where I was."" Don't do it. DONT. Eating bad fucking sucks, its caused me constant stomach aches, headaches, shortness of breath, reduced stamina, the whole nine yards, and starting today, I'm getting back on track.

sometimes I eat bad but I stick my my caloric goals.

Cardio at gym 6 days a week, need to get into weights though.

I am going to start Keto tomorrow so a bit nervous about that.

and I have gone 118kg down to 105kg which is around 10% of my  starting weight. In 7 weeks

Advice? if you were severely overweight like me, JUST DO IT. get MFP work out you calories and slash them. Gym is great but for me its more of a motivational thing, I think if I stop going I will fall of the tracks.

More than the workouts we had done up to that point so we decided that we would start running. Picked up the Couch to 5K program and went from there. After successfully completing our first 5k in May 2011 we decided to keep it going and progressed to 10k and a half marathon in 2012.

In 2012 I decided to leave the gym and go fully in to running. Joined a local club and started to make massive leaps in to improvements on speed and distance. My gym buddy at that time went more in to weight training. However we both agreed to try and complete a marathon. I had applied for the lottery that is London but my buddy had missed to cut off so we decided to look else where. Rome was the marathon we ended up agreeing on and on 17th March 2013 we both very proudly completed that marathon. Today I weigh in at 208 lbs.

The weight loss hasn't been easy though. There were cheat days that turned in to weeks / months. There were times when I felt like giving up and just admitting I was a failure. But those days always passed as the thought of going back to that hill and being in the same situation that started this whole journey was enough to snap me out of whatever state of mind I was in.

Here is the before and after pic:

Key things that helped me get here:

* Having set goals
* Changed my diet big style
* Don't worry about about bad days, they are going to happen
* Have some one to work towards your goals with (this has been the biggest motivator for me)

Verrry Large.
10 Months ago my friends/coworkers(gym rats) convinced me to give it a go at the gym.
Before I started all of this, I was the laziest piece of crap ever. I would get winded walking around my store that I work at, and I would make some of the dumbest excuses to not have to do something if i knew that it would take some energy to do so. I was taking pain killers on a daily basis because my knees were so torn up and could stand the pressure that my fat ass was putting on them.
I Would go to the gym with my buddies as a social thing trying to give the false image that i was trying, but nothing was actually happening, we would go play Top Golf afterwards and I would take in 2 times the calories in food and beer than I would have if i just stayed at home on the couch. It was getting bad and I was out of control. 

[This is me at my heaviest.

[A month or 2 before the image above](http://i.imgur.com/iJtv2.jpg)
 - Halloween, I went as a bounty hunter, There really aren't that many costumes that a person my size can do....

So when my coworkers and friends finally convinced me to give it a try at the gym, I was trying to just go through the motions and get it over with and perhaps i would get an attaboy from them for going and giving it a little effort. I found that I was looking for excuses as to why i couldn't do something rather than just doing it, weather i blamed my Knees hurting or just didn't fit on the machine so i guess i just cant do that lift.
I would be proud of my self for going once a week, saying to myself each time, ""hell I went on Monday, I'm set for the rest of the week, I might as well have another 'off day.'""
Persistence form my friends finally beat my persistence of laziness and they won.
If they were going, they would bug me until I said fine lets go. One day a week turned into 2 and then 3 and then 4, and after about a month of them beating on me to get to the gym, something just snapped and I had become full blown addicted to the gym, buggin them go with me so that I had someone to work out with.

Fast forward to now, I am 100 lbs down and still going strong.
I have built up a nice amount of muscle, I love lifting now, it is my way of De-stressing after a long day of work.
People seem to think that just because you are a large person, that you are as strong as Hulk.
When I first started it out I was rather self conscious about lifting, thinking that I should be much stronger than where I realistically was at. 

Here are some of my improvements.

Flat bench barbel - 135 starting 285 current

Lat Pull (on hammer strength) - 85 lbs per arm starting  165 per arm current.

Seated Row - 120 starting 300 Current

Skull Crushers - 40 lb starting 100 current

Bicep Curls (cam machine) 45 Starting 110 Current.

I am still a little too large to run without breaking things ( treadmill and knees...) I generally walk at a 3mph pace for at least an hour, and do so at a 2.5 incline, generally burn at least 1000 calories just doing my cardio. I will run here and there but I have to brace my self on the arms of treadmill to make sure that I don't further damage my knees (torn cartridge in both from different accidents).

Thanks to Reddit (especially the Fitness, LoseIt, FitMeals &amp; Bodybuilding communities) I found the motivation and information needed to start working out and eating healthy. 

I'm still at the beginning of my journey but it's pretty mind-blowing for me to see what 6 weeks of working out and eating right has done for my body.

For those interested in what I've done so far, these are the top 5 behaviors I've changed:

- I began tracking everything I eat and drink in MyFitnessPal (added a few friends of mine on there too to show accountability).
- I started drinking a lot of water (12-15 cups daily, before I barely drank a couple glasses).
- Weightlifting! I found an example weightlifting routine on Reddit and each week focus on increasing weights and my strength. I now go 5-6 days a week.  
- I ask a lot of questions and I research a lot to better understand the science behind nutrition and working out. 
- I've made friends at the gym that give great advice and really help motivate me.

**EDIT:** I've received quite a few messages from Redditors wanting to learn more about my measurements, my exact routine and what's next. Here ya go:

* *Stats:* 31 / F / 5'6"", SW: 180lbs, CW (6 weeks later): 175lbs
* *Before pics:* http://imgur.com/UtZPwTC
* *Nutrition:* Week 1 started at 1300 calories but now that I've been lifting I've increased my calories to 1700 calories at Week 4. My macro breakdown is 40% Carbs / 35% Protein / 25% Fat (I track what I eat on MyFitnessPal). I drink about ~12 cups of water every day. I take a Multivitamin, BCAAs, Fish Oil and use Whey Protein Isolate for my protein shakes and my morning oatmeal. 
* *Workout:* I go to the gym 5-6x a week and am using a routine I found on Reddit (http://redd.it/1ik9os). I do a Pull/Push/Legs split Monday thru Saturday and take Sunday as my rest day. I try to increase my weights every week. I spend no more than an hour at the gym each day and try to stay focused on getting through my workout in that time. I alternate doing HIIT cardio called Tabata on a stationary bike (about 5 minutes of HIIT and another 10-15mins of regular cardio on the bike)
* *My motivation:* Tired of being overweight, having low energy and not feeling healthy.
* *What's next:* My biggest goal is to continue eating right and hitting the gym longer than 6 months and turning this routine into a lifestyle. I just hit the 42 day mark (so I still have quite a bit to go). Reddit has helped a lot with keeping up my motivation - so thank you!
 
* *Important to note:* I had no idea how to get started but each week kept researching, learning more and asking questions. All of the information above is knowledge I accumulated, not something I just knew. There's still a lot more to learn.

I started this in May when I graduated from college. I decided I didn't want to be that way anymore and took a giant lifestyle change. 4-5 days a week at the gym, mostly ellipitical early on, with a 1500 calorie plan using myfitnesspal. I'm not close to being done, but I feel so much better.

Feel free to ask questions, I would love to answer them.

P.S. Cheat days happen all the time, it's deciding to go back the next day that's the difference.

I cannot stress enough -- **counting calories really worked for me**. I had attempted so many vague weight loss efforts before, cutting down on carbs, eating unsaturated fats like olive oil over butter, going to all sorts of classes at the gym, but all failed. When I first cut to 1200 calories a day, I still felt hungry sometimes, especially at night, but honestly, within a week, my appetite had shrunk to 2/3 or a half of what it had been. It got much, much, much easier. Felt like magic. If you have tried several things to no luck, I really recommend giving it a try!

I counted calories using [LoseIt](http://www.loseit.com/) for the first couple of months, then quit for a while due to a cross country move + grad school, and have recently started up again. Even though I wasn't tracking food when I first started grad school, I still lost weight, although at a slower pace, I think because I was biking every day and sometimes got really busy and did things like only eat almonds for lunch. I also ate a bunch of bread :( but the calorie balance must have been in the negative. I walk a fair amount and bike, though less so now that it has gotten cold, but I haven't stuck with any regular exercise for its own sake. 

I haven't followed any particular diet, although with staying under a caloric limit I obviously have to plan more. For example, this week I've eaten burritos, fajitas, roasted vegetables like kale and broccoli, soup, meatballs, salads, pizza, scrambled eggs. With watching my portions and having a calorie plan, I can pretty much eat anything, although it's much harder to work in something like pasta and feel full enough. I don't eat breakfast because I am never hungry in the morning. I actually have a [vendetta against breakfast](http://nutritiondiva.quickanddirtytips.com/is-skipping-breakfast-bad-for-you.aspx), at least for myself personally, but that's neither here nor there. The hardest thing has been alcohol in any larger quantities than a drink or two. 

My original goal was 145lbs because it put me in the normal BMI range. Now that I've reached that goal, I see that I still have farther to go. I'd like to work in more (non-gym) strength training like bodyweight exercises and free weights at home. 

I think a big part of my success this time has been getting rid of some negative thought patterns I had. I used to eat more because I was worried about getting hungry later. I would eat mindlessly, or overeat because something tasted good. I worried about feeling deprived. The thing is, as I practiced my new eating habits, they became more and more automatic, and I learned that I could wait the negative thoughts out, maybe go to bed a little hungry, but wake up feeling fine in the morning.

I started late November at 245 (my highest recorded, I stopped weighing myself after seeing that number). Slowly but surely through changing my diet alone I'm now at a much more respectable 197.4 pounds!

I used to be the guy who would literally eat chips everyday, go out to eat multiple times a day, and was known as the fat one in school (I made fun of myself, so I wasn't really picked on but I still wasn't happy).

I plan on getting to 175 pounds and start muscle training from there!

What I'm basically saying is that if I can do it, literally anyone can! So don't worry how lazy, unmotivated, or big you are: you can do it!

EDIT: Some seem interested, so here's what I did:

First and foremost, I downloaded the MyFitnessPal App for my smartphone. Using that, I counted my calories religiously. I found out what my BMR was (google it) and ate 1200 calories less than that everyday. I scan every barcode possible of foods I eat. I also measured all my food on a quality scale so I knew exactly how many calories I was eating.

I cut out all pop (what we Michiganders call soda) from my diet and currently only drink diet pop or zero calorie liquids including plenty of water. No point in drinking your calories when you could be eating them.

I ate chips literally everyday. I would buy the $4 bags and eat those in 1-2 days then go get more. I completely 100% cut chips out of my life. Not just chips either. All fast food has also been cut out completely.

I would only eat out at restaurants when I was with lady friends.

I never allowed myself a ""cheat day"" or ""cheat meal."" I think those are bullshit. What I do is eat what I want, just limit it within my caloric limits. If I overate one day, you bet I would eat less the next day.

I mainly ate foods with protein and good fats while significantly decreasing carbs. It's not exactly keto, but it's similar.

I found that I have a high tolerance to hunger pangs, so I decided to fast and not eat anything while drinking only water until around 7 PM. This allows me to have one big meal and go to sleep full. I don't do this everyday, but most days are like that.

While not exercising religiously, I started walking places instead of driving. I also play sports with my friends whenever possible. These usually include basketball, football, hockey, tennis, and racquetball.

If you are anything like I was when I was obese, I wasn't shy, but had very low confidence. Now, during my senior year, all that has changed. I'm very confident and happy with who I am (even though I have more weight to lose). The first key to success is confidence that you can succeed.

IMPORTANT: I am getting all my essential vitamins and nutrients. I know how important those are so I make sure I get them.

For motivation: 

* It seems tough to keep motivated when it seems like the scale tells you that your weight is lower while you feel like you look the same. I unfortunately did not take pictures, but one should! Take them once a week and SEE the changes for yourself!

* I find not eating unhealthy food very easy. I realized that willpower doesn't exist.

What I did to lose the weight:
Completely eliminated every soft drink. Used to drink coke + various other sodas almost every day. Now I just drink water, lots of it.

No more fast food. Again, used to live off this stuff but I've completely eliminated it.

Junk food, still eat icecream, candy, chips, cookies etc from time to time but not nearly as much as before. Was a daily thing before now I actually eat them as treats from time to time.

Besides cutting out the obvious junk, I haven't really stuck to any strict calorie # diet. I have reduced my portion sizes and I just try to be more aware of what I'm consuming. Replaced a lot of the junk with vegetables and fruits.

Exercising:
Probably the effective thing I've done was to purchase an exercising bike. I was too embarrassed to go to the gym so I bought a bike and started using it for 20mins, 3 times a week. Currently I'm doing 1 hour sessions every other day.

At first it was difficult, there were many times where I thought, ""This is enough! I'm going to lose weight!"", then I'd make an attempt at it and fail. The turning point for me I think was buying the  bike and committing to actually exercising. Once I started seeing results, 2, 3, 4 lbs lost it kinda just had a snow ball effect from there and I haven't looked back. Not to mention putting in all that effort on the bike really motivated me to not eat anymore garbage because I did not want to waste that time I spent on it.

I also try to be much more active, have a dog so I spend about 45mins daily walking. I try to do physical activities, for example, just went kayaking. Gets in some exercise and is a lot more fun than sitting on a bike for an hour!

My goal is to reach 180lbs and then I'll see if I want to go lower from there.

 I would consider my saggyness to be above average in severity. I lost the weight in about 1 year, which was too fast. The Doctor says it should shrink back a great deal (it already has) but that I will need surgery to correct it entirely.


If anyone has concerns about loose skin, all I can really tell you is that being fit and healthy with a little loose skin feels millions of times better than being overweight and lethargic.

If anyone has any questions, feel free to ask. There are progress pics in my comment history if you want to see where I started to compare yourself against. I have severe gynomastia, so hopefully you guys are luckier in that regard, because my manboobies just kind of deflated.

EDIT: I also wear a compression bodysuit during the day to make clothes fit better. Here is a pic of the effects of the undershirt. I think it's a great tool to use even during weight loss, because it's an instant boost to self-esteem.

After lurking here for a while and seeing all the amazing and inspiring progress posts, I thought I’d share my weight loss adventure with you. I started my weight loss journey on December 1st 2006, I was 20 years old at the time. I weighed myself that morning and weighed 245 lbs. I knew I was headed in a bad direction and I needed to take charge of my life and make significant lifestyle changes. I didn’t know what to do other then what I do best, as a science nerd: I researched that shit. I read and bought so many books about how to lose weight, it was ridiculous. And it paid off.


**My stats from December 2006 to my 21st Birthday in June 2007:**


* Height: 5’11”
* Weight: 245 to 135 / 140 lbs
* Woman’s pant size: 18 to 4
* Shirt Size: Large to Small


Progress photos from 2006 to today: [Before and After photos here](http://imgur.com/a/JIb5O)


**What I did:** I counted calories; so, so many calories counted. I didn’t have access to anything helpful on the internet, like myfitnesspal.com, so I wrote everything down on post-its and in a weekly / daily organizer. I told myself that I needed to be honest with myself, so I made sure I accounted for everything. And honestly, lying to myself had only got me into size 18 pants.  After I had lost about 30 lbs I felt more comfortable going to the gym. I would go for about an hour and a half, four to five days a week, doing mostly cardio, treadmill and elliptical, and a lot of squats and sit-ups. I drank water constantly, filled up on veggies, chicken, eggs and salads. 

Over the past year I have gained back 35 lbs. It is difficult knowing that I put so much effort into loosing 105 lbs to have gained some of it back but, I understand that my body will have its ups and downs. That is why I’m back here, to get the support I need to get back to a size 6 pant and a weight goal of 140 lbs.

After embarking on my weight loss journey at the beginning of this year, I lost my 130th pound today, so I figured I'd celebrate by sharing it with you guys. First, stats:


**Height:** 6'0"" (about 183 cm)

**Starting weight:** 372 lbs (168.7 kg)

**Current weight:** 242 lbs (109.8 kg)

**Goal weight:** 200 lbs (90.7 kg)

**Shirt size:** Down from 4XL to XL

**Pant size:** Down from 48"" waist to 38""


All this was done through simply restricting calories and lots of running. When I began, I took the calorie restriction to a bit of an extreme; I was only taking in about 1,000 calories daily, but after educating myself on just how dangerous that can be (especially with all the running I've been doing), I slowly upped my daily intake to 1,500-1,800 calories. I still shed about two to three pounds a week, and I'm not practically starving myself anymore, so all's well. As for specifics on what I eat... I'm not too terribly picky. I avoid basically all sweets like the plague due to their calorie density and being generally unhealthy, and I haven't eaten a burger since late January for no reason other than proving the extent of my restraint, but apart from that, all other foods are fair game. I still eat fast food three or four times a week, but as long as I remain conscious about how much I'm eating, there's never any guilt involved.


As for exercise... running, running, running. When I started out in late February, I was absolutely awful at it; 50-second jogs followed by two-minute rests were all my out-of-shape ass could handle, but nowadays I can run a 5K with relative comfort. My progress in running has come in leaps and bounds, and now that I'm decent at it, I can't get enough of it. It feels wonderful to be physically active after being the epitome of the complete opposite for my entire life. I've recently started adopting various body weight workouts - mainly upper body, as I'd love to be able to do a pull-up some day - so hopefully I can gain some muscle to fill the void that loose skin is bound to occupy when I reach my goal weight.


Now, pics. Sorry about the absolutely ridiculous before pic; I hated cameras when I was at my heaviest, so photos of me at that point are quite rare.

You, MFP, some very supportive friends, my awesome dad, and my wonderful boyfriend have helped me immensely! I still have a few more pounds to go, but I wanted to give back to the community now.

Here are my [progress pictures](http://imgur.com/a/rxop3#0), everyone’s favorite! 

Backstory, if you care to read it:
Through high school, I was just a little bigger than my friends, but liked my body enough that I didn’t care enough to lose the extra twenty pounds I was carrying around. Then I gained several different freshmen’s fifteen pounds during college and the start of grad school. I wasn’t thrilled with how I looked, but wasn’t bothered enough to do much either.

Then I was in a car accident on Christmas Day 2011 (not my fault, at least). My collarbone and wrist got broken, I was bruised and scraped up, and couch-bound after leaving the hospital. The first couple of days sucked, but then things started healing (although my collarbone still gives me trouble sometimes). It was amazing how quickly my body started healing, despite the terrible health I had been keeping it in. I felt bad. If I could heal this well while being obese, what could I and my body do if I got myself in shape? 

My boyfriend introduced me to reddit while I was stuck on the couch, and r/loseit happened to show up. I was inspired, finally educating myself on eating better and seeing that programs like C25K exist. I’ve been a loser since then! I’m still working on the last 5-10, but I feel fabulous and look much better. 

My Diet: I use MFP. I set myself to sedentary and to lose 1 pound a week, adjusting my calories every 10 pounds. I also eat back a lot of my exercise calories, keeps me from getting too cranky.  I cut out sugared soda and drinks, stopped buying Oreos, and started measuring my food on a scale. I eat a lot of fruit, veggies, chicken, and whole grains. I get a ton of healthy recipes online, so I’m never bored! 

Exercise: I work out for 30-60 minutes four to five times a week on average. I started with c25k a couple of months in, and have been running ever since! I picked up biking over the summer, and next summer I’ll be doing RAGBRAI with my dad and his bike club! I’ll start lifting when I’m not in a rural area and live within 25 miles of a gym. I use workout videos as well. Finally, I use a Polar FT4 heart rate monitor, so I can more accurately guess how many calories I burn working out. 

TL;DR: I eat less, move more, and feel great. 

Edit: it's http://sizes.darkgreener.com/ for the measurement thingie.

I've cut most red meat out of my diet and eat a lot of veggies. I used to be one of those guys who would get a fast food combo and an extra burger! Now I try to stay under 1,800 to 2,000 calories/day.

More importantly, my blood pressure and cholesterol are way down. My doc took me off my cholesterol meds, said I didn't need them anymore and that my change in blood pressure (it was borderline high) was ""amazing"" :) I have a history of heart disease in my family and that's a big relief.

Like a lot of people, I haven't really been able to ""see"" the changes in the mirror, but the weight is coming off and I feel better than I have in years. 

I just wanted to post this to encourage more of our middle-aged members that it's never too late to start bettering yourself. I still have a ways to go, haven't settled on a goal weight, but 185-190 would be nice. 

I don't have any full-body pics to compare, but here's a side by side face pic:

EDIT: In case anyone is wondering if you need an expensive bike to do this on, nope. I bought a Schwinn Ridge Aluminum hybrid bike for about $200. I put some Geax Streetrunner tires on it (ride mostly paved) and a padded seat. [my cheap ride](http://i.imgur.com/7Nhlq.jpg). You don't need a fancy $2000 bike to get in shape. I wanted to make sure I was gonna stick with it before spending a lot. I am thinking about upgrading to a nicer bike now that I'm into it.

I started losing weight in June 2011 and weighed 225 lbs (102 kg). My weight is currently around 163 lbs (74 kg). My main motivation was a messy end to a 5-year relationship. After losing about 15 lbs (6.8 kg), my motivation was focused on myself and no longer on spite. [Progress pictures can be seen here.](http://imgur.com/a/QKIab)

When I started losing weight, I began counting my calories, and like lots of girls, tried to keep my intake around the 1200-1300 range. I joined a gym and started doing the elliptical and treadmill for 20-30 minutes and randomly using the weight machines, with no real plan in mind. After losing about 10 lbs (4.5 kg), I started the Couch to 5k program on the treadmill at the gym. I continued to throw in sporadic and random use of the weight machines, doing high reps with low weights.
I lost about 2 lbs/week (~1 kg/week)for a while and in November 2011, I was down to about 180 lbs (82 kg) and felt pretty good about myself. I kept doing 30-45 minute jogs on the treadmill, trying to do intervals of sprinting, but without any real rhyme or reason. During the holidays, my eating was not the best, and I just maintained my weight until January, when I decided to put a concerted effort into losing more weight. At this point, I started obsessively tracking calories again and started losing weight again. Around 165 lbs (75 kg), my weight loss slowed, and I foolishly started to drop my calories lower and lower in order to keep losing. I got to where I was eating ~500 calories a day, and got my weight down to 155 lbs (70 kg). My workouts predictably suffered, as I barely had the energy to complete them. My brother, who is very into weight training, realized how little I was eating and made me start eating a healthy amount again. When I began eating 1300-1500 calories, I gained back about 15 lbs (6.8 kg). He then told me that I needed to start lifting weights. He turned me onto Starting Strength about 4 months ago, and I have been working on that 3 days a week since then. I was doing lots of cardio, but I have recently cut back on that. 

My weight now fluctuates between 161-165 lbs (73-75 kg) and has been in that range for the last 3 months. 

About a month ago, my brother sent me to Reddit's fitness subreddits, and I have started the LeanGains/Intermittent Fasting regimen. I really, REALLY like the intermittent fasting part of it. I eat from 12pm-10pm. I am having a little bit of trouble keeping up with my macros and have lost some motivation to track my calories. I am really kind of looking for some added accountability/friends in r/loseit so that I can regain some of my previous determination. I'm focusing on strength now, but I'd also still like to lose about 15 lbs (6.8 kg).

Anyway, I thought I would post this because I looked at a LOT of progress posts when I was first starting out on my lifestyle change and they were so motivating.

You're all amazing and inspiring!

Hi all! In 2011 I was almost 400lbs, had high blood pressure, beginning stages of left ventricular hypotrophy, not to mention constant back pain and unable to walk a flight of steps without getting winded. My mother passed away about ten years ago at 47 so I also knew there was medical history. Something this time scared me to death, and I slowly started walking. Soon after I found Couch to 5K... from there it snowballed... 10K, 1/2 marathon, marathon, and then triathlons. This past November I obtained the title of Ironman. 

The pic on the left is me at fire department training (over 50% of firefighter fatalities are cardiac related!) and the one on the right is me completeing the Memorial Day Murph Crossfit exercise.

A little over a week ago another redditor posted their weight loss progress and it was shockingly similar to my own so I thought I would take my chance to share! 

First off, how about the basics? I am a 22 year old female. I'm 5'10"" tall. 

April 2011 - 210 lbs, 16 in pants, XL sometimes L in shirts

January 2012 - 171.0, 10 in pants, M sometimes L in shirts

Starting goal was 165. Current goal is 150. 

**Measurements -**
July 9th (38-33-42.5)
December 22nd (37-32.5-39.5)
January 23 (36-31-39)

If you stick around there are pictures at the end!


**Health background:** It feels as if all my life I was was always bigger, other than being taller than everyone. I remember not ever wanting to wear jeans until late middle school because I didn't like how tight they were on my waist. Throughout high school I really struggled that I had trouble fitting into popular clothes like Abercrombie and Fitch or Hollister. I wanted to fit in with the pretty preppy girls. When I was 16-17 I started to notice that I was constantly gaining weight, no matter what I ate. I noticed other things that I didn't even think to link together such as hair growth on my chin and stomach, huge pimples that would happen on my chin line, and I was always depressed. It wasn't until I was 18 that I was diagnosed with [Polycystic Ovary Syndrome.](http://www.womenshealth.gov/publications/our-publications/fact-sheet/polycystic-ovary-syndrome.cfm#d) Which causes insulin resistance issues and leading to excessive weight gain or obesity especially in the waist area. My doctor prescribed me the diabetic medication Metformin to help level my insulin and hopefully stop the weight gain. Staying on Metformin was really hard for me to do my senior year of high school and into college, it caused a lot of stomach issues and I was terrible at taking pills everyday. It leveled out the weight gain but I couldn't seem to lose any of it.


It was finally in April 2011 when I moved into my first apartment that I decided I needed to take control of my weight starting with buying better food for myself, monitor how much I eat and take Metformin regularly, so I did. I rejoined my gym and made it a point to try to go once if not twice a week. I had been hired as a full time nanny for the summer and into fall and made sure that I was going for walks, bike riding, running around with (and for) the kids. One of my biggest influences and support systems throughout my weight journey is my boyfriend. Before we started dating he lost 70 lbs and gave me great advice and support. I probably couldn't have done it without him.


**Eating:** First off I installed the MyFitnessPal on my phone to keep track of my calories. As being hired as a full time nanny I could pretty much eat whatever and whenever I wanted. It was hard in the beginning to not snack with the kids whenever I was making them something, but I got into 3 meals a day and 1 snack later in the afternoon. I bought oatmeal packets and special K bars. I mainly keep my breakfast around 200 calories. At the beginning of the week I would buy the Healthy Choice or Lean Cuisine frozen meals for lunch, also keeping those in the 300-400 calorie range. Around 4:30 when the kids would have a snack I would munch on carrots or cucumbers. When it came to dinner I didn't pay too close attention to the calories, but obviously wouldn't be eating pizza or obviously bad food. 


**Exercise:** My main concern is usually cardio to get my heart rate up, so I would run on the elliptical or be on the bike. I would do some weight machines but nothing too crazy, I didn't want to gain muscle before losing the weight. Exercise is usually pretty hard for me because of a heart condition I have, basically low blood pressure. If I get my heart rate too high, I pass out. I usually go for about a mile and then take a break for a little while so I don't face plant in the middle of the gym. 


Other than those things I just really tried to remain active, taking hikes with my boyfriend, taking his puppy for walks, buying a bike, and mostly sticking to my meal plans and medication. 


I know there are lots of women out there with PCOS and hopefully this could be some inspiration for some of them, that you can in fact lose the obnoxious weight. Thanks for reading!


**Pictures:** I don't have any pictures from the beginning in April, partly because I didn't believe that I would actually lose the weight. August was the first time I decided I should start tracking it.

[Before](http://i.imgur.com/cHhfK.jpg)

[After](http://i.imgur.com/v4uoS.jpg)


So, in my first picture I was about 16/17 (~2008). I'm not sure my exact age since I don't have a date on the pic, but I can guesstimate my age based on my weight. I was just ending my sophomore year in high school, with a weight approaching 200 lbs (90.7 kg) at a height of 5'7"" (170.18 cm). I was a SAP (socially awkward penguin) and really never had a girlfriend through High School.

I'm not sure what was going through my head at this point. I would look in the mirror and see a fat kid, but wouldn't think to do anything about it. My daily diet would consist of at least one sugary 20 oz soda, tons of carbs from cereals and breads, a miniscule amount of protein and almost no fruits or veggies. I would eat fast food about once a week. It was sad.

What would it take for me to get my fat ass in gear? Would I have to wait for diabetes to hit? Heart disease? I was headed down this road, and I was seemingly oblivious to it.

One day during the summer after my sophomore year in HS, my Mom came home with a card. She walked into my room and gave it to me. It was one of those motivational cards that you give someone who might be sick fighting a disease, and looking back on that moment, the card was eerily appropriate for my situation. I was fighting a self-inflicted disease.

The card also had a key fob in it. It turns out my Mother went and signed me up to the YMCA gym about 5 minutes from my house. This was all the motivation I needed.

I went to that gym 3-4 days a week. I would perform an effective mixture of weight training and cardio, and the weight just fell off. I changed my diet; I cut out sodas altogether, stopped eating out, bought fat free milk for my new cereals, ate more vegetables and fruits (bananas and spinach salad mostly). This all proved very effective. 

I was down to 170 lbs in about 10 months and felt AMAZING. Seriously, it sounds so cliché, but anyone who has lost weight knows this feeling. I was at a plateau though, and I knew I couldn't let myself lose any of my motivation.

I began to step up my cardio (running, mostly) and eventually bought a road bike in April of 2011 (senior year of HS). I was probably around 165 at this point. I rode the hell outta that bike, 1500 miles in the first year I had it. In March of 2012 I rode the Solvang Metric Century (~70 miles) with two close family members. When I finished this, I knew I had taken a complete 180-degree turn for the better.

Currently, I'm at a healthy weight of 158 (71.67 kg) lbs at a height of 5'10"" (177.8 cm). I run 4-5 miles 3 days a week, and weight train at least 2 days a week. I don't eat out anymore (it's just not appealing), I've cut out most drinks other than coffee/water/skim milk and when I *do* cheat, it's that much more amazing :D I'm still a bit of a SAP. I'm shy, but I'm forcing myself to do things outside of my comfort zone socially.

LoseIt has helped me so much to keep the weight off. Though I didn't join until about 6 months ago, even in this short time LoseIt has helped me to improve in areas that I didn't think I needed to! /r/Fitness deserves some credit too ;)

**Pic:** http://minus.com/muIVQkFKd#

**Backstory**: I was in fairly good shape when I was young, and used to lift a lot in high school. When I was 18 I got into a car accident (nothing major), but did damage to both of my knees which forced me to stop a lot of what I was doing. Unfortunately I changed my workout habits without changing my diet, and gained a bunch of weight from 18 to 21, during which I'd started working really long hours. I hit my peak of 415 about 2 years ago, and really kicked off my journey to get back in shape about 18 months ago.


**415-&gt;370:** This was mostly just really basic changes in daily eating and activity habits. Parking further away, taking the stairs instead of the elevator, diet was still bad (fast food, frozen food, but less quantity)


**370-&gt;340:** Greater diet changes,  started pre-cooking and portioning all of my food on the weekends so I would be prepped for the week, started doing some light lifting at a gym


**340-&gt;275:** Started Paleo, (still cooking in bulk), started working out with a trainer (mostly kickboxing), 2 days a week, and 2-3 days on my own doing other cardio activities (I'm picking up cycling now and do 60-120 minute rides a couple of times a week)

I currently do some type of activity about 3-5 days per week, (trainingand am averaging 9-12lbs per month of weight loss. I eat about 90% paleo, with the exception being work-related.


I plan on maintaining the diet and slowly adding more physical activity, particularly in my leisure time, trying to find activities that are good hobbies. My end goal is to be around 220-230 (I have a large frame), at 10-12% bodyfat.


I work a lot currently so it's very challenging to find time for healthy activity, but like anything else in life if you want it you'll make time for it.

I went through high school sitting at about 200 (not that scary of a number for 6ft tall but still overweight. 

After graduation I packed on a ton of weight, started working in a restaurant and ended up being the heaviest I have ever been .... 240lbs. I began to notice my health was declining, my mood swings were out of control, my digestion problems were inhibiting me from actually enjoying food. When I was 17 they diagnosed me with a stomach ulcer, saying that's why I was having stomach problems. These problems continued and at the end of 2011 everything came to a head and I fell very ill, all of my body systems were just out of whack and not functioning properly. Turns out I don't have an ulcer, I was diagnosed with a gluten allergy. After cutting gluten out of my diet completely (in January of this year) it was like I did a 180 turn. EVERYTHING got better, weight began melting off, I was not longer feeling depressed, the brick constantly sitting behind my belly button was gone! 

I went through a bit of a plateau so I upped my activity level, began doing yoga everyday, elliptical training and lifting weights. After 5 months it has turned into a lifestyle change for the better! I am not the person I was at the beginning of this year, I am happier, healthier and 10000000X more confident! I sit at about 190lbs now with a BMI of 25, from my 240lbs and BMI of 32.5. I'm heading into that ""last ten pounds"" phase and tackling my first year out of my teens feeling like a new woman!

I was always the fat kid, when I was 12 we moved to a pretty rough area. I was bullied ruthlessly in school for my skin color and weight. This translated into me hiding out in my room eating food and feeling sorry for myself, thus gaining more weight. Three years ago I weighed 457 pounds, fired from my job, I was incredibly lonely and I was starting to think maybe I should give up on life. I had a pretty common routine in my life, I would get depressed late at night, tell myself I will wake up tomorrow and change my life, but I never did. One night an old UFC fight was on and I saw Lyoto Machida win the UFC light heavy weight title. During his post fight interview he screamed into the microphone ""People! If you have a dream in your life, go ahead! It's possible! If I can do that, It's possible!"" For what ever reason, this clicked in my brain and made something so simple so clear to me.. if I really wanted to change my life, only I could do it. I googled mixed martial arts gyms in my area, I found one. It was run by a legendary MMA fighter. I sent this man an email, a cry for help.

His response was this, it was the beginning of my new life. ""Thanks for the email. It appears that you are really trying to help yourself. I am all about helping people that are trying to help themselves. If your goal is to lose 100+ lbs then it is our goal to help you to lose 100+ lbs. Nobody looks stupid coming into my academy. If you can respond back with your number and the best time to call, we can get started right away and start fitting you into your new body.""

He never charged me a dime. He said ""You are welcome here under these conditions, you show up and try your best. If you give up, I will give up on you as well"". I've not only lost 250 pounds but I have become a serious martial artist and a serious athlete in the process.

I was 215 and in pretty good shape years ago ( http://i.imgur.com/IAxHy.jpg ). I lifted every day, ate chicken and fish and broccoli day in and day out. Then I got married...and it all went down hill from there. Not because of my wife, she's great. Amazing even.  But because I got lazy..gave up on being fit and became OK with being overweight. 6 years later I'm 290lbs no more muscle and all fat. Here I am in Germany enjoying the local fare..a bit too much..as usual. http://i.imgur.com/Smyrn.jpg 

Jump ahead a few years and I feel like crud, and so does my wife. We've put on weight together and neither one of us is happy about. So it's time to change. And we do. We take up eating better and both join a gym together.

It's not easy at first but it starts to work. We fall in love with the Les Mills line of classes, BODYPUMP, BODYSTEP, BODYATTACK, and BODYCOMBAT become regular activities for us and they start to really make the change happen. Eventually I am down to 230lb but the bigger thing than lbs is I'm down from a snug fitting size 40 pants to a loose fitting size 36, so although I've only lost 60lbs at this point, I've put on a decent amount of muscle, and shed inches of fat. I take up teaching BODYCOMBAT at this point as I'm feeling decent in my fitness, but I am not done with my own transformation. A year later I start teaching BODYPUMP and I'm still working on my body, I'm better but not there. 

Here's me at 230lbs doing my first Warrior Dash http://i.imgur.com/EI0Rh.jpg (yeah flames)

So now I've gone another year and another 35lbs down and I feel amazingly better. I can do so much more. I've completed a half marathon, numerous 5ks with increasingly better times. It's amazing. I still get to eat a lot of great foods in moderation of course, but my life isn't confined to just chicken and broccoli, although I do eat a lot of chicken...

Here is me now, from our most recent release of BODYPUMP 83, in a size large tight fit shirt... something I would never have worm a year ago, and still not comfortable with now, but I'm working on it.

**
Diet info:** 

When I was packing on the weight, I ate anything everything including but not limited to Totinos' Party Pizza, Hamburger Helper, Tuna Helper, and a lot of other disgusting stuff. Really, what the heck was I thinking with that food. 

When I went to lose weight, I went with a minimal ingredient approach, tried to buy as many things as I could that I could understand what was in the food. So no Monohydrosulfaglutamakemefatassacus in it....I started with just including more veggies and more protein. This combined with the new workouts was enough to drop the 60lbs. I still ate Ice Cream, Cake, Cookies and more..Pizza..for sure Pizza..because I WILL NOT give up Pizza. 

I didn't have a huge soda habit or anything but I did start to include a lot more water, you wouldn't believe how many times you think you are hungry and really just need water. That alone can be a HUGE change in your diet.


For my final surge of 30lbs in the last 6-8 months it's been a lot of chicken constantly throughout the day. I ate 7-8 times a day about 3-4oz of chicken, just grilled chicken or slow cooked chicken, and I would eat some whole wheat pasta with black pepper and Siracha on it (Siracha makes anything delicious..well almost)

I utilized the crap out of MyFitnessPal.com for calorie counting during this time too. This was to do a major calorie check and make sure I was only eating what I really needed to eat. I teach or take class two times a day some days so I used my fitness pal to log calories burned and calories taken in to make sure I wasn't putting my body into a state of shock from burning 1200 calories that day exercising plus the 2000 calories I naturally burn with BMR. It's important to fuel the body or it starts to eat muscle and causes a lot of not so great results.

Right now for maintenance I eat typically 4 meals a day, with Chicken still being the staple protein (chicken is an over achiever when it comes to protein to calorie ratio). 

My daily intake look like this right now:

* Breakfast:
Blueberry &amp; Strawberry Protein Smoothie with Vanilla Soy Milk (I toss in a handful of frozen strawberries and half a cup of blueberries and about 1.5 cups of Soy Mil and one scoop of whey protein)

* Lunch 1: Chicken 4oz

* Lunch 2: Chicken 4oz &amp; Carbs of some sort (Rice {typically brown}, Whole Wheat Pasta

* Dinner: Varies greatly... Steak, Chicken, Soups, Seafood, You name it. Dinner is not a meal I watch that heavily, but I am still careful for the most part. It's the one meal I get to enjoy with my wife in the day so we don't really put a huge limit on what we eat for dinner, we try and keep it simple with protein and a veggie source but other days it's Pizza delivery, or out for Sushi, or out for Wings and Beer. Depends on the day.







*Additional info: My wife is doing great on her fitness journey as well. She's done three half marathons..to my one..she's an overachiever.. She just recently certified to teach BODYCOMBAT as well and she is feeling and looking great. It's been an awesome journey together. I don't know her total weight loss though. *

I'm proud because I did this! It took me years, but now it's completely sustainable. For the last six months I went 'off-diet' and didn't count, just ate what I want- and I stayed the same weight. I have every faith in my ability to stay at whatever weight I settle on in the future.

So, how did I do it? Calorie counting! That's all. I also started exercising but I do that for health reasons, and to be awesome. I just started C25k, and I do yoga and dancing a few times a week. Mostly I would say to people trying to lose weight, you CAN DO IT! Just check everything you eat, count it, don't delude yourself. I used to be the queen of self-delusion. If I wear big cardigans, people can't tell I'm so fat. I don't look that fat, really...I was completely miserable and in denial. But you can take charge of your life, you can control what you eat, and you can get to the weight you want.

I've lost over 10 inches on my waist, I was wearing size 68 pants and now my 56's are starting to fall off me.  I've dropped from bursting out of 4XL, to baggy in a brand new 3XL, and I have a closet full of old 2XL's left over from before I got that big.

I feel lighter, smaller, but everything is a bit jiggly as it all loosens up.  It's a strange feeling.  I'm becoming comfortable in my own skin again.  For the past few years I've been *that guy* who always hides from cameras when I don't have total control over what happens with the image, but I've found myself jumping into photos at social events and what not *without the aid of alcohol*.  This may seem small, but for me it's a huge step.

Looking forward to when I feel good enough to start running, or at least pull my old BMX out of the pile of crap on the porch and putting it back together to go for a ride.  


Any who, sorry about the long post.  I know it may not be much of an achievement, losing weight when you're backed into a corner to do so but I'm pretty proud of myself, at least at the moment.

1341939904.0,466,self.loseit,wc3mq,NSV: I went clothes shopping for the first time since dropping 60 lbs. I kissed Kohls' Misses Plus section goodbye forever!! Best shopping trip ever.,566,100,80,http://www.reddit.com/r/loseit/comments/wc3mq/nsv_i_went_clothes_shopping_for_the_first_time/,"Yesterday, I received my first paycheck from a new job. I decided it was FINALLY time to buy some new clothes for my smaller frame. I have avoided trying on clothes because I didn't want to face any disappointment of not seeing any change in my size. I have always hated shopping, and Kohls was especially self esteem-killing, as their Plus section was microscopic, and everything was more fit for Spongebob Squarepants than a young woman in her mid 20s.

I'm a 5'5 25-year-old woman, and I have gone from 261 to 203 since last Thanksgiving. I used to wear size 1x or 2x shirt, and size 24 pants. Well, because I was so broke and so afraid of clothes shopping, I was STILL wearing those 1x and 2x shirts, even now!! The shirt I wore to Kohls yesterday was humongous on me (as was the bra, which I've needed to replace for some time).

Once I got to Kohls, I wanted to ease into trying on clothes, so I tried on some 1x shirts from the Misses Plus section.... TOO BIG! I was secretly beaming. I waved goodbye to the big lady section, and traipsed on over to the other Women's section. This has been a milestone I've been anticipating for so, so long. I can't believe it's finally happened :)

All told, I tried on about 15 shirts, and 15 bras. I spent THREE HOURS in Kohls. It was sooooo overwhelming (in a good way :D). Everything was so cute and colorful. It took everything I had to not start bawling while I was walking around. Things for smaller women actually FIT ME!!! I couldn't believe how far I've come.

I got 3 beautiful XL shirts, and one LARGE! shirt. A freaking Large! I couldn't believe it. I also got 2 bras, which fit me soooo much better than the ones I've been wearing.

**Edit** Today, I bought a pair of pants that is a size 16. I had been wearing 18s, but this 16 fits me much more nicely. 

I even tried on this size 16 dress--more for laughs than anything else. I thought to myself, ""Yeah right!"" when I picked it up, not expecting to be able to get it over my head or up over my hips. [Everything went better than expected!](http://i.imgur.com/KycDJ.jpg). The dress was snug, but I was just proud that I got it on without splitting it, hah.

I am so, so pleased with how my shopping trip went. I can safely say that this was my best shopping trip ever. I felt great about myself... sexy and everything. 
YAY!

I was immediately drawn to this forum due to my life-long struggle with weight loss. I feel that I have wisdom to give, and I also can completely relate to finding encouragement through other people's progress (I still do!). I hope that I can inspire at least one person through sharing.

Before I get to the rest of my post, I put together a collage showing my current transformation (visuals have always inspired me to keep going). My highest weight was 250 lbs (113 kg). I am currently down to 187 lbs (85 kg). My final goal is between 150-160 (68-72 kg). EDIT: people were asking, my height is 5'6"", and it took me approximately 1.5 to 2 years to lose this much weight so far, thanks for the questions! And sorry for removing pix, had some harassment/had to report some people. I just wanted to help encourage everyone, not get trouble! ;p hopefully the tips can still help someone.

Now to let you know how I got there and how I've made changes. Don't get me wrong, I'm not a professional or anything, but I do believe that transforming the outside has to start with a bigger change. You have to WANT to do it for yourself and no one else. To be healthy or at least to love yourself more. For me, my troubles finally max'd out mid twenties from a culmination of undiagnosed ADD, Anxiety Disorder and of course plain misuse of food. I would eat to cope with my life, as many people do, but one day I just realized that I was in charge of my own happiness and my own health—that I wasn't stuck.

How did I do it specifically? I started slow. I had bad experiences in high school of trying to always find the “next big diet” hoping it would work for me, and I didn't want to go down that road anymore. It may be cliché, but it truly is about finding a healthier lifestyle, plain and simple, and sticking to it. The easy first steps that I followed: 

1. **Buy healthy groceries and cook at home!** - Everyone has different eating preferences (+ I am not a nutritionist). But in my opinion, the best thing to remember is to eat lots of vegetables, healthy lean meats, some fruits and avoid too many complex carbs (like pastas, breads, etc). I personally chose to also cut out wheat (I use alternative flours when necessary) and I do not take in sugary foods/drinks. An example of a meal I would eat for dinner would be baked fish (or a lettuce wrapped lean turkey burger) with a large serving of vegetables and a quarter cup wild organic rice. I usually eat smaller meals and 2 snacks per day, keeping them about 3 hours apart to have my metabolism always running strong.

2. **Move!** - Let me be the first to tell you...I don't like exercising. At all. Lol. Some people say it gets better or that they start to love it, but I was not blessed with that epiphany (it's all self-discipline). I played sports in high school and would love to do volleyball or basketball again, but in my current life it is harder to find those resources and fit them in. It is ALWAYS the hardest getting started. The important thing is to just force yourself to do so. For me, in the beginning, I just made myself walk the treadmill at my house(or walk your block if you don't have one). I just walked at a decent pace for a mere 15 minutes a day when I started. That is not much at all, but eventually I was able to jog at an incline for 45 minutes, and as months went by I started adding in weights and calisthenics! It just takes time and perseverance. My advice is start with whatever you can, even if you can't afford a gym. Just....move! ;p

**Special Tip**: The dreaded “cheat days”. Having the idea of cheating is a poor mindset for your health. You are building a lifestyle, not going to prison (if it feels like that you're probably going too extreme on yourself too fast). Just look at those unhealthy foods as something you can enjoy on special occasions, while out socializing with friends and don't feel guilty about it. It's all about moderation and not letting your old lifestyle creep back in. I find it helpful to order something to split with someone if you're out at a restaurant, or if you have a party at your house, give the leftovers away to someone or throw them out after. There is no such thing as messing up your whole diet, you just eat healthy/exercise or you don't. Just always keep on moving, if you eat bad, fix it for the rest of the day. Forgive yourself ;p Health is forever not just about whether you screw up or not. Besides, healthy foods can be good too.

Bonus Recipe: This is one of my favorites that I created. You can sub in any veggies you want!

**Low sodium veggie turkey stir-fry** (this makes *at least* 3-4 servings. Choose wisely according to your personal eating plan)

- 1 whole zucchini (sliced or chopped)
- 1 cup sliced mushrooms
- 1 can bamboo shoots (drained/rinsed and sliced)
- 1 small package of extra lean ground turkey
- 1 cup chopped red peppers (can sub with green peppers if desired)
- spices (pepper, parsley, garlic powder, onion flakes, red pepper flakes if you like spicy etc)
- light virgin olive oil (or cooking spray) to prep the pans

Start by washing and cutting up all your vegetables. You will need two pans typically, unless you have an awesome giant wok to use. Once your vegetables are chopped up you will want to start the fire for your turkey breast (*lightly* oil the pan so it doesn't stick) and let the meat simmer over a medium fire, stirring occasionally to be sure you get all the pink cooked out of it. I usually add spices to the meat while it is simmering. Once you have the meat cooking, once again *lightly* oil the pan for the vegetables (some healthy fats are important, but never go overboard). Add your vegetables over a medium fire and start spicing things up (I choose to add spices to both the veggies and meat so that they marinate in them separately over time instead of blanketing spice on afterward). The low sodium part of this recipe is about choosing natural spices that do not include salt :) I find they taste just as delicious without it, but if you feel you need something like salt, please choose a more natural route like sea salt and be sparing with it. Drain the meat when it is done cooking. When both are at your desired consistency (usually the veggies are soft enough to eat but still have a slight crisp, and the meat has no pink), you will combine them together. Stir them, then warm over lowest heat until serving. Total cooking time should roughly be around 30 minutes (10 min prep/20 min cooking). Tip: when using natural spices sometimes it needs more spice than you first thought to give it enough flavor, don't be shy with the shaker (my favorite is garlic!) ;p Add to taste.

I hope you can find something encouraging here, whether it is my general story, photos or tips. Never give up (I'm still working at it too!) Good luck all!

At first I was somewhat hurt by your childish remarks, but hey  I'm 185lbs, I'm fit as fuck despite the extra baggage, and just because I didn't respond to you doesn't mean I'm a ""dumb bitch"". It means I'm smart enough to not to start an altercation while cruising down a busy street. 

Apparently I'm a whore because I wore shorts, and a tank top. Its 80 degrees outside, so why the hell not? I'm confident with my body, I will wear whatever the heck I please.

",537,76,71,http://www.reddit.com/r/loseit/comments/ub2xl/nsv_today_almost_10_years_after_being_diagnosed/,"A little over a year ago I was sitting my car having just gotten back from a doctors exam. I had had type 2 diabetes for about 5 years at that point, I was 22. My doctor kept telling me that I needed to loose weight. At this particular appointment he said that I really needed to look into gastric bypass surgery. 

There is just something about being so depressed, being called fat and unhealthy every fucking time I saw the doctor. I didn't want to be this way, but I didn't know what else to do. I finally broke down, I couldn't hold back the anger and frustration burning inside of me. I started crying, looking at myself in the rear-view mirror then looking at the gastric bypass pamphlet sitting on the seat next to me. I fucking hated myself. 

At about that same time I had just discovered Reddit, I didn't know much about it but I had discovered the fitness thread and this is when they regularly had before/after posts talking about weight loss. The results were amazing, one that really stood out to me is [this one](http://www.reddit.com/r/loseit/comments/hociu/21_months_and_over_125_lbs_lost/0). The thing that really stuck with me is that these people were not being paid, they were not selling anything and they had nothing to gain (other than karma). They were just everyday average people that proved that it could in fact be done. This was more inspiration than anything I had ever seen. 

So I started the South Beach diet and left that doctor who wanted me to get surgery. I also joined a gym and threw out all the bad food I had in my house. The transformation took a long time, but I would get on Reddit everyday for inspiration. It really helped seeing other people struggled with the exact same things as me. 

About 6 months ago I had lost 40 lbs and my doctor took me off my high blood pressure medication. And last week my doctor said my lab results were incredible, I have lost 90lbs so far. He said depending on the next set of tests it might be time to get off my medication. I got that call today saying I had effectively reversed my diabetes. I'm glad I was alone when I got the call because I broke down crying again. But this time it felt amazing. It's almost impossible to describe just how monumentally big this day is for me. It honestly feels like a re-birth, a new time in my life. It may sound corny but this directly happened because of this community and because of Reddit. A community forum set up by anonymous people I don't know helped save my life. 


This is something that I have struggled with and tried to understand for the past decade. Fighting for better health is something that doesn't come easily and the results are not instant, at least not for me. But I stuck with it and holy hell was it worth it. If you are struggling like I was, trying to figure out what to do please don't give up. You are strong enough to do it, I know for a fact you can.

BUT I'M SO EXCITED!!!  I went into a casual male XL today because I needed to get a pair of pants because my clothes have been HEAVILY belted on to me lately and they were starting to look a bit ridiculous.  So I'm thinking I went down a couple of sizes, I was a 56 at my starting weight (330 5'11"").  So I'm down to like 288-290 ish depending on the day.  So anyway, I go in there and I grab a 52, nope way too big, nice.  So I try a 50, still WAYYY too big, sweet.  So I glance over at the far end of the rack, a place I've not dared go before, and I grab a 48, and I say to myself, I say ""Self, you might fit into these pants.""  So with a little ""squeeee"" of joy I go bouncing into the fitting room and put them on.  MOTHER OF GOD THEY'RE TOO BIG!!!!  I was dumbfounded.  So that's that, casual male XL (at least where I live) doesn't have anything smaller than a 48.  So I pop into the car and drive across town to a store for the normal people.  I tentatively skulk my way to the men's section and start looking around.  I grab some 46's and some 44's.  I tried the 44's first, because, well, I was excited.  AND THE BASTARDS FIT!  Admittedly they fit pretty tightly, but they still fit.  I wound up buying two pairs of 46's because they were just more comfortable, and one pair of 44's JUST BECAUSE I CAN!!! 

This minor little surprise victory couldn't have come at a better time either, I've been having a really really hard time with keeping on track.  It's taken me almost 8 weeks to go from 298 to 288 and I've been getting pretty upset and discouraged because for the last few weeks I was going from 291 to 295 on a day to day basis and every time the weight went up it was fucking soul crushing.  I honestly was about a week away from saying ""fuck it"" but this was just the encouragement I needed.

I am only 10 lbs away from my original goal of 155 lbs as of right now!!



How I did it:  I started with low cal/low fat diet change when I first started, then my hubby introduced me to a Keto diet. I was a little apprehensive at first because I absolutely LOVE carbs. It did work and I saw the weight come off.  While doing Keto diet, I started going to gym a few times a week.  Started taking a 1 hour Dance Fit class once a week helped the pounds melt away, along w/a couple of 30 to 40 min cardio sessions a week.  I would do a little bit of weight training with my husband so that I could try to tighten and tone as I was losing, but I hated every second of it.  Then in September of 2011, after losing abt 45 to 50 lbs, I fell off of the wagon so to speak.  Life got in the way. Had Kids that were in football and cheerleading so I never could find the time to get to the gym. Let's face it, I didn't even try to find the time.  I had an excuse to not have to go.  I went back to eating exactly the same as before and from September to December, ended up gaining 15lbs back. I know that doesn't seem like a lot, and I was a little surprised to find that it was only 15 lbs considering all that i had been eating.  The first week of January 2012 I decided I have to get back in there and get back to work.  Started off a little slow back in the gym, going to one class (Dance Fit) a week and still a little cardio.  By the 3rd week of January, I decided to see how far I could run on the treadmill and ended up doing a 5k in 43 min.  That was all it took for me to become hooked on running.  I would run a 5K abt twice a week, trying to acheive a PR every time I stepped on the treadmill.  Then I discovered running outside. I was really hooked then. I am now currently training for a marathon with a running group that I joined in April.  It is scheduled for November and my goal is to just finish it, but hoping to atleast finish in less than 5.5 hrs.

I have also discovered a love for heavy weightlifting.  My husband and I are now in the gym 6 days a week in some form or fashion 
By the way, here are my current weights for lifting
Squats : 225lbs
Deadlifts: 240lbs
Bench: 135lbs

I don't know which I love more, running or weightlifting. Hopefully I will never have to make a choice :)

As far as my diet goes since getting back in the gym, I am pretty much on a 1600 calorie a day diet , low cal/low fat/moderate carb/high protein.  I did go back on Keto diet for a couple of weeks but again, I LOVE carbs and I am not a happy person w/o them.  

TL;DR- I love lifting. I love running. I love carbs. Lost 65 pounds. Thanks Lose-It.

I had fast food twice by the time I was 15.  I played sports and went out as much as the other kids up until 13 or so.  Then I got way too into video games and that slowed me down quite a bit.  I think by senior year of high school I finally said ""fuck it"" and figured if I'm gonna be fat either way I'm going to eat what I want and be a real fatty. [Senior prom](http://i.imgur.com/ufbSMpY.jpg?1).

At my heaviest I was 365.  Possibly a bit more.  At this point my self loathing was pretty substantial. [This is one of the pictures I have where you can see how big I was](http://i.imgur.com/zt9aj.jpg) I was 20 at this time. 8 months ago I started eating non-fat Fage yogurt with mixed berries, granola, local honey, and almonds for breakfast everyday.  Over 2 months I think I lost 15-20 pounds.  This is without doing any real exercise.  I didn't really notice myself losing weight.  It wasn't until I was weighed at the doctors that I realized I'd lost weight.  

This was a pretty substantial moment for me.  I can't EVER remember stepping on the scale and having it go down that much from the last time I weighed myself.  This was a pretty big motivator for me.  I bought myself a pair of walking shoes and started doing between a mile or two a day.  Occasionally jogging once it became easier.  I started drinking a gallon of water a day and paying more attention to how much I was eating.  I still allowed myself to eat what I wanted.  Just in civilized portions and not after 9 pm.   

I started to see the weight come off.  Slowly but surely.  Don't get me wrong, I'm still fat.  But I feel a shit load better than before.  One of the most accomplished feelings I had was this summer.  It was my first time going to Europe.  While in Barcelona I walked from our cruise ship to Park Güell and back.  This was a round trip of about 7 miles.  [You can sort of see my cruise ship in the distance of this picture](http://i.imgur.com/dddjwq7.jpg?1).  Seeing the ship was such an incredible feeling because I KNOW I could not have done it just a few months prior. I was down 60 pounds at this time.  [Myself in venice with my parents](http://i.imgur.com/K4vBrUp.jpg?1).

Fast forward a bit, I'm 22 and I was down to 270.  I'm back up to 280 since I turned into a depraved animal during Christmas time.  I'm getting myself back on track though.  I think posting this might be my way of forcing myself to get my shit together again. 

 My favorite thing about this weight loss is the clothes.  It is SUCH A GOOD FEELING to be able to purchase clothes for *normal* stores.  I used to be a 3XL and a 44 waist.  Currently I'm a L/XL and a 38 waist.  I could never just walk in and find clothes before.  I have so many more options now and I love it.  The only issue I still have is running into clothing too short for me (I'm 6'5).  [This is me on Christmas](http://i.imgur.com/CUaKK.jpg). 

If you actually took the time to read this long ass post I thank you.  I apologize for any typos or anything that doesn't make sense. I'm semi rushing this since I want to get to sleep for work in the morning.  Just wanted to get it out there before I forgot.  My goal weight is somewhere between 220-240.  Lifting seems like the next logical step for me.  I want to stay big, just not *big*. I feel better than I ever have and my confidence is the highest it's been in years. I know people always say this... but if I can do it, anyone can.  I'm the laziest fuck in the world.  It really isn't that hard when you apply yourself just a little bit more.  Thanks for reading.

TL;DR: I was fat, now I'm less fat, soon I won't be fat.  

EDIT: I would just like to say thank you to everyone for your kind words and encouragement.  You have no idea how great you've made me feel about my progress so far.  I've subscribed to this subreddit and will be around here and there in the future.  I'll post a new thread once I reach my goals. Let me say again if I can do this so can you.

1374768393.0,459,self.loseit,1j18wf,I'm 26 Year Old Male and I'm 420 lbs. Someone PLEASE Help Me. I'm Really Afraid.,551,92,201,http://www.reddit.com/r/loseit/comments/1j18wf/im_26_year_old_male_and_im_420_lbs_someone_please/,"I don't really know where to start. I'll just give a basic overview of why I've come here seeking help. I have always been big. I never really felt there was any problem with my eating habit or exercise regimen (or lack there of.) I played football so I was okay with being big. Now that I've been out of high school roughly 10 years I've packed on so much weight. I finally decided a couple years ago that It was time to do something about my weight for a couple reasons. I found out I was having a baby and I was finally able to find a scale that could weigh me and I tipped the scales at 450 lbs. 

I started a smattering of diets and exercises. First I just got my calorie intake down to 2000 daily. I started logging my calories and realized I was taking in 5-6 THOUSAND calories DAILY! So I dropped down to 2000 and dropped roughly 30 lbs. When I plateaued from that, I started Nutrisystem. It wasn't the greatest thing in the world, but it really taught me how to balance a plate and how much portion control was crucial to weight loss. From that I lost another 30 or so lbs. after losing those 60lbs I started going to the gym. I had a simple regimen that consisted of upper body and cardio, off day, lower body and cardio, off day, cardio, off day, off day. from that and keeping my diet below 2k cals I lost another 35 lbs. I was down 95 lbs and feeling great. I went to the doctor and he was telling me that I was doing well but if I wanted to lose more I had to burn more calories than I was taking in. so I set a goal for myself to take in only 1500 calories a day and burn 2000. I also changed my diet to clean eating, no red meat, no white rice, bread, or pasta. taking in my 8-8oz glasses or more of water per day. I was good. but then it happened. 

The same thing that has always happened any time I said I was going to try to lose some weight. I just turned off. I don't know if I got bored or what, but something mentally just shut off. I started skipping the gym here and there. I would eat fast food every once in a while. then it went to gym 1 day a week and fast food every couple days until eventually no gym and all fast food. I'm now back up to 420 lbs. I know I make excuses about time being a factor and I have friends who are trainers who say there is no excuse. But for me, I wake up at 4am every day, commute 1.5 hours to work, work my 9 hours, then commute another 1.5 hours home. by the time I get home I don't want to go grocery shopping or go to the gym. I just want to sit and enjoy time with my family. I want to ""vedge out"" so there is a break in the monotony so I don't go crazy. I want to be there to put my daughter to bed at night. And I want to spend some 1 on 1 time with my wife. I'm assuming those things make it easier for me to turn the switch off. 

I need someone who can relate to me. someone who has been in my shoes and still lost weight. I'm not a loser. I try to be active. I play softball every Sunday and I try not to sit around but I seem to have ZERO will power when it comes to eating. I don't know what's wrong with me. I feel like such a failure. Every day that I look in the mirror the thought of surgery seems so easy. I want to take the easy way out but my mother in law had surgery and she died. not directly from the surgery, but indirectly. She never got over her eating disorder, so when she physically couldn't eat any more, she started drinking heavily. the drinking caused her pain so she started taking tons of pain meds and one day she took the wrong pain med with alcohol and her heart stopped. I don't want that for me and my life. I want the satisfaction of knowing that I did it myself and that I did it with hard work and diet and exercise but mentally I just can't do it. 

I don't know why I'm writing all this. I don't know what I want or how I expect reddit to help, but I've heard some pretty amazing things come out of Reddit, and I'm at my wits end. Is there anybody out there who wants to help me? will you take me on as your own personal task to help me lose my goal weight of 140 more lbs. I think if there was someone who helped me every step of the way with diet, exercise, praising, friendship, mentoring, etc. maybe I can do it. Am I asking too much? 

Thank you for reading. 

EDIT: When I say 1 on 1 time I just mean time with my wife. talking and such. not NECESSARILY sex ;)

This subreddit is amazing and I'm really inspired to keep going on my journey, I thought I would share my journey so far with you all.

My journey started many years ago, growing up I was always a bit bigger than other kids, I'm not very tall, only 5 foot 9 but I always had a wee bit of a belly. I got the usual bit of bullying here and there, nothing too major.

The worst thing I ever did was leave school a year earlier than all my friends and get an apprenticeship, I felt cut off from my friends and I stopped going out, I spent all my time online playing games. The weight piled on and then I dropped out of work, and then dropped out of college and I kept playing games. I would only venture outside to pick up benefits (social security I guess to Americans) and get Chinese Food, Pizza or other fast food. 

I eventually got a job and I've been employed ever since, but my habits were forever changed. I tried many things to lose weight but eventually I would always give up because it was too difficult or I missed eating the things I wanted to eat.
/
I tried kettlebells. Slim Fast. Hiring a personal trainer. Scottish Slimmers. Weight Watchers. Calorie counting. I read Steve Jobs biography and tried eating nothing but carrots and apples for a week.

Back in May a friend told me about her experience with Slimming World. I admit, I was skeptical. I'd tried the slimming group thing before and I didn't think it would work, then she told me about the plan and it started to sound a bit of alright. I woke up on Tuesday the 29th of May and said ""this is it."" I was mentally ready for the challenge of losing weight. It was my time to shine.

And I went to group and met my amazing consultant, I got weighed (27 stones 0.5 lbs), and everyone was so supportive and friendly, I felt like I actually fit in. I got the plan, studied it intensely, and applied it starting on Wednesday morning. I went in to group that week with a loss of 12.5 lbs my first week. From that point on I was hooked, it's been 28 weeks since, I've maintained, gained, but mostly I've lost. I've lost 103.5 lbs (7 stones 5.5 lbs) in 28 weeks and I'm just about halfway to where I want to be (12 stones) and I know it's with Slimming World I'm going to get there.
I'm not at 19 stones and 9 lbs and I haven't been this weight since I was 18 years old. And I tell you what, I feel like I'm 18 years old, I feel like I've been asleep for years and I'm now just waking up! 

So here is my journey so far in picture form below, I hope you guys keep sharing as it's been awesome to lurk here this past while :)

Most of it has been calorie cutting (eating much better) and some level of activity (stationary biking and oh so much rock climbing!). I have not been running though. Running has always been difficult for me for some reason, I would always be at the back of the herd in High School and Middle School athletics. It wasn't until I joined the swim team at my HS for the last 2 and a half years that I could keep up with some of the runners for a short amount of time, but it has always been very difficult. 

Today I decided to go running so that this summer, when my girlfriend and I live in the same area, we can go running together and I can keep up. Well I started running...then I kept running some more....then more and more. By the time it got difficult I was so close to 3 miles that I just decided to finish it. I probably could have gone more if I pushed myself. It felt amazing and I'm still feeling the effects of the adrenaline! It is amazing to not have the 25-40 lbs of fat weighing me down and I can absolutely feel the difference!

""lifestyle changers"" - don't burn me, /loseit!) get so caught up in the feeling that we're DONE being fat! and we're DONE eating crappily! and we want results NOW! that we tend to lose sight of the bigger picture. I know that, personally, I've struggled with this mentality many a time over the years. I feel like I've been eating so great and working so hard and yet I'm still just this fatass who should be fit and muscular and sexy by now because I've been doing this for so long and I'm tired of not being as fit as I feel inside. This then tends to lead to discouragement or depression along with just a general feeling of the fuck-its that leads me on a slow climb back up the scale, rather than down farther. 

So, a friendly word of advice to all who have felt the same way: You have likely been a fatass for quite a long while. I know I had/have been. Please don't expect to win this battle overnight. Even if you don't achieve your sexy six-pack in time for this summer's beach trip, don't get discouraged and revert to old habits. Up your resolve and continue on in the faith that you'll be there (or getting that much closer) by next summer and then every summer for the rest of your life. 

This may seem like a slow, almost pointless battle now. We may feel like we're going nowhere. But we are. Every day that we choose not to eat the entire refrigerator and instead go on a walk or head to the gym is another victory and is one day closer to our ultimate goals. Rejoice in the small victories. Let yourself be ecstatic when you push yourself for that extra quarter-mile. Don't get too caught up with the future. The future will drive you crazy. Live here; live now. Live healthy each and every day for the rest of your life.

*Edit:*

I used to believe I was living the dream but a few years ago everything I had worked for and loved disappeared before my eyes. In 2009 I weighed 440lbs... I was morbidly obese and my life was crashing down around me. I claimed bankruptcy, gave up my house, my car and my wife demanded a divorce.
I was lost and alone yearning for a life I was not living. Last month, after losing over 200lbs, I finished the Honolulu Marathon and hiked round trip 22 miles along the Napali Coast. Today, life is good and I am on the path to something awesome.

Losing the weight was not an easy task.  I started by walking ten minutes a day and reducing my calorie and carb intake. Eventually, I walked farther and farther and started lifting weights a few days a week.  I was on my own and I knew I had to figure out the best way to do it.  I lost weight but would hit plateaus.  During one of those times where my weight loss slowed down, I decided that I wanted to set a goal to run a marathon and so I downloaded a marathon running plan and started following it.  I continued to eat right and exercise.  I made lots of mistakes and learned lots of lessons along the way.  I used a little bit from lots of different sources.  No one diet or workout plan works for everyone.  I kept a journal and paid attention to what worked.  I kept doing the things that worked and quit the things that didn't.  It has been a long journey and there are lots more to come.

My starting weight was 160 lbs and my weight now is around 139 lbs.

I can't say I was overweight my whole life, but just after University (and a little help from the pill) I gained about 20 lbs extra weight (in what seemed) overnight. I felt uncomfortable and bloated - I stuck to wearing the baggy clothes and just felt generally miserable with my appearance. 

Lucky for me, realisation hit! If I'm unhappy with the way I look - why not change it. It was all through counting calories (MFP), going to the gym ALOT &amp; never eating, or drinking, over 1200 calories per day.

For me, the gym was perfect; I LOVE food - so burning those extra 400 calories at the gym allowed me to eat more, it ended up not really feeling like a diet.

I still put my food into MFP - mostly so I don't regain! I have to admit I haven't gone to the gym in about a month but I use MFP religiously during the week, it's helped educate me on high calorie foods.

I asked my SO to take the first set of pictures (as I've been following this sub) and not show me the results. Losing 10 lbs and seeing the picture difference gave me a really proud feeling.

I'm not sure why I look like a GIANT in the last picture of my back, I think the angle was a bit off!

So kids or parents of big kids. Take a look at this pic. I'm 13 on the left and weigh 230 at 5'6"". The right is me yesterday after weighing in at 230 for the first time since then. This is down from 315 and I'm now 6'1"". My life is good. The outcast kid from then has lots of friends now.

1364705236.0,451,self.loseit,1bce3r,SV - Stepped on the scale today and there was a number instead of an error message,515,64,19,http://www.reddit.com/r/loseit/comments/1bce3r/sv_stepped_on_the_scale_today_and_there_was_a/,"It's a bitter sweet feeling. I've avoided the thing for the last couple years because I knew I was getting bigger, but I didn't want to see a number. Back in January I finally decided it was time to change my life for the better. I installed Lose It! on my phone after seeing all the recommendations in here. During the initial setup I had to enter my starting weight, so I hopped on the dreaded scale; it said ""ERR."" It must be broken I told myself. So I set my starting weight to 400lbs since the last time I weighed myself I was around 380lbs. 

Some background info: I'm a 6'5"" 28 year old male. I have always been on the heavy side. Yet growing up I was always active in sports. Soccer (later football) in the Fall, basketball in the Winter, baseball in the Spring, and swimming in the Summer. That came to an abrupt end when I graduated HS.  I was used to eating high cal meals for so long to support my active lifestyle, that when my activity levels changed I didn't know how to change my diet.

Fast forward to my 21st birthday and now alcohol is an easy access item that I find I can’t live without. Long story short, I have developed a serious problem with the stuff. I’d easily drink 2000+ cals a night of booze day after day, year after year. The next morning I’d find myself eating greasy shit because it seemed to help the hangover best. 

I became a real grumpy asshole. I never had energy to do anything. I was either intoxicated or hungover. I didn’t have the confidence to go chasing girls. I hated myself. 

January 2013 rolls around and now I have the flu. I was sicker than I had ever been before, and it lasted several weeks. During the peak two weeks I ate no more than a bowl of soup a day, if that. I dropped a belt hole size during that time. When I got better, I decided it was time I change my life and get back in shape. 

Diet: firstly I eliminated all soda except for the occasional diet something.  Desserts, also gone. Milk, that’s gone too; I used to drink tons of the stuff. I’m a tea and coffee drinker. Thankfully I’ve been a fan of unsweetened tea for years, so that wasn’t an issue. Coffee though was a bit different. I was used to sugar and cream in it every morning. It took a little time, but now I enjoy my coffee sugarless and black. Caffeine!!

I used to eat pizza 2 or 3 times a week for lunch; or more. I’ve pretty much eliminated all meals that are carb focused. Protein and veggies are the name of the game now. Salads with steak or chicken have become my go to lunch. Dinner usually is a meat, veggies, and a small amount of a starch. 

Two meals a day. I’ve never had the stomach to eat anything in the morning. A previous night’s drinking session or not. 

I think the biggest change has come from my elimination of alcohol during the week. I can’t yet break from the habit of drinking on the weekends, but I’ve been able to avoid the stuff all together 5 nights a week. No beer no matter when. My favorite whiskey on Friday and Saturday night only. 

I started lifting weights again too. I really missed the feeling!!! Right now I can only focus on upper body since my knees still get too sore for lower exercises. Overall I’m feeling better than I can remember. 

 So back to that scale. As of this morning, I’m back on the graph. 398lbs. The number is higher than I’d like, but all my clothes look too big. I'm currently 3 belts hole sizes down! :D

Edit: I've been fairly consistent at keeping the cals to around 1600 a day. Occasional hunger pangs, but nothing I can't think myself out of. Tons more energy throughout the day and I've been noticeably happier.

It was easily the hardest, but proudest achievement of my life, and I feel like I can do anything now.

FAQ:

How old am I?

-22

How tall am I?

-5'10''

What did I do to lose all that weight?

-I worked hard. That's really all there is to it. You want something? You gotta work hard to get it. But most importantly, you gotta never give up. There were days, even weeks, where I would cheat on my diet or even skip the gym because i didn't feel like doing it anymore. But what made the difference is that I picked myself up shortly afterwards and kept on going.

Did I plateau?

-Yes. Many times. And let me tell you, they are very disheartening. The key to beating them is to just stop weighing yourself for 3 to 4 weeks and just keep doing what you're doing. Eventually your body will give up trying to hold on to the fat and just start burning it again. The most persistent ones where when I hit 270, 230, and 185. It took me over a month to get over those, but once I did, my body just started shedding like 2+ pounds a week.

Do I lift weights?

-Yes. I work all muscle groups doing random weight training exercises everyday.

What cardio machines did I use?

-90% elliptical. 5% treadmill. 5% bicycle.

How often did I go to the gym?

-Everyday. I personally don't believe in rest days.

Did I follow a certain exercise program or diet program?

-No. I kinda just did what felt right. At the gym I did what really got my heart beat going and made me workout the most. As for a diet, I just eat healthy in general. Avoid soda/juices, don't eat junk/fast food more than once a month, etc. There's no need to follow a strict diet and eat the same stuff every time. Just eat healthy.

What's the best advise that I can give to someone who is trying to lose a lot of weight?

-Do not give up. No matter what. You miss one day at the gym? Or eat unhealthy one day? pick yourself right back up the next day and punish yourself at the gym. Also, don't weigh yourself every single day. Your weigh fluctuates too much each day. Weigh yourself once a week. I weighed myself every Sunday right after I woke up. Try not to look in the mirror too often either. You won't see changes for a bit. Also, just remember, 1 year of hard work = a lifetime of benefits.

When did I start seeing results?

-Within 2 months. They were small, but I could see them.",,False,,t5_2rz8w,True,,140lbs,True,t3_t6rkp,http://www.reddit.com/r/loseit/comments/t6rkp/update_for_i_lost_over_120_pounds_in_1_year_post/,

This was after a particular horrid shopping trip where I ended up buying jeans that were much too small on me because I didn't want to get a bigger size especially since my youngest sister commented that those jeans were the biggest she ever seen. 

Well I showed those jeans. Not only did I eventually fit in to them, they are now too big on me and have been donated. And I didn't murder my little sister. So it was a win-win all around. 

When I stepped on the scale that first night and saw 273, I cried and wanted ice cream. I suppressed my cravings and signed up for weight watchers online instead. 

Now a lot of people I talked to told me that WW online was just setting myself up for failure, that it was a lot harder when only my computer/phone was holding me accountable. But that twenty dollars I spend every month is holding me accountable much better than any team leader. I lost eight pounds my first week and have been losing steadily ever since. 

The first major diet change was giving up diet Pepsi. I lived on that sweet nectar of the gods. I started that for Lent and have kept it up, drinking only water now or orange juice for a morning treat. 
I also cut back drastically on my carb intake and my beloved potatoes. I still enjoy them, just once a week, not once a meal. 
I learned portion control, which was tough for me. Coming from a large family, I learned to cook for large groups. Seriously. I make mashed potatoes by the five pound bags. And my soups can feed a small army. This was the toughest part. Learning to cook and down size for one. I had to cut what I learned from my mother into 1/12 of the size. 

I did rely on frozen smart ones meals and healthy choice the first month or so in order to help me better identify portion sizes. It really helped rewire my brain. Now I typically hit 35 points a day for WW but when I started my point allowance was 42. I love losing points. It makes me feel so accomplished. 

When it comes to exercise, I work two jobs that keep me fairly active. I'm on my feet all day and constantly lifting things and running around. I also do jogging/walking exercises four days a week for about an hour. I didn't start the jogging/walking however until about a month ago when my semester ending. Can't wait until I build up to stamina to run! I plan on starting to lift weights for definition soon. My younger brother is a wrestler and he has a weight set. Just waiting for him to come home from vacation so he can help me. I don't want to hurt myself. 

Overall, I am so happy that I'm halfway to my goal. I do have some advice to offer. Don't  worry when you fail or cheat. Admit that it happened and move on. Don't downward spiral. Don't feel guilty. It's ok. Mistakes happen. Don't let it consume you. Losing weight was so much easier once I realized this and stopped beating myself up for a small mistake.

I was at the gym yesterday doing my back and triceps routine. I was very tired at the end of it and I thought ""eh screw it, tomorrow is my off day so I'll come in and do cardio and abs."" Right as I was taking off my gloves and getting ready to leave, a thought hit me like a train:

No matter how little you want to do you cardio during your workout, or how much you think ""eh I'll eat less today/I'll do it tomorrow/I'll do more tomorrow,"" when you are at the beach in 3 months, you'll be thinking ""I should have done more cardio.""

I've been lurking around here since I've been on reddit, but honestly have been way too ashamed of myself to post anything. But today, I feel really good.

I started out at 280. It was the heaviest that I've ever been in my entire life. I got out of a really bad relationship and ate my feelings for a year, and exploded. I've always been heavy, but one morning I woke up and looked at myself in the mirror and decided that this shit was unacceptable. I had to do something. 

Diets never worked for me. There was always too much pressure. I would lose 20 pounds, then someone's birthday or the holidays would come around or I would just lose faith in myself and get impatient then I would gain 5 or 10 pounds and give up. I'm almost 27 years old and I finally reached a point where I felt like it was do or die time.

I really changed my daily eating habits. I eat pretty much nothing but fresh fruit and veg, tuna fish, and whole wheat pasta. Chicken every once in a while, but I haven't had red meat or pork in months. I stopped drinking soda altogether, even though I made the switch to strictly diet a long time ago, I knew that I needed to drink more water. I really miss cheesesteaks and ice cream and chinese food, and honestly sometimes I indulge in those things. But they have become an indulgence, instead of daily fare. And I'm pretty sure that is what has made the most difference. Now that I'm not so painfully heavy, I am able to walk up stairs without having to pause to catch my breath. I am able to actually exercise! I started walking. I probably don't exercise as much as I should, but I try to take a walk for at least a mile 3 days a week. It doesn't always happen, but I'm certainly much more consistent with it than I have been in the past.

This was me at 280, size 28. http://imgur.com/6664s

Until today. This is me now. 230 pounds, size 24. http://imgur.com/wYvdt

I'm not done. I still want to lose another 30 to 40 pounds. But for the first time in years, I feel sexy today. For the first time in years, I feel like the outside of me is starting to match the inside. I stopped putting pressure on myself. I don't need to follow strict rules for a diet, I don't need to count calories or points, I don't need to deprive myself of the things that I loved. I just recognized that my love affair with food is toxic, and it was killing me, body and soul.

So here I am, loseit. I wish all of you success and happiness for the new year!

I was always overweight, always bullied for it at school. I'm 24 now and last year in December I decided I had to lose it and couldn't let it control me anymore. My goal was July 1st. Either reach my goal or make significant steps towards it. I lost about 50lbs by then so I counted it as a win and kept going. Breaking the 100kg mark was almost painful. 3 weeks it took, there were days I'd step on the scale and it would read 100.0kg. Just 0.1 off! Argh! During this year I've been dumped, I've been far away from my friends, and I've had to fight depression from coming back. But my weight loss kept my strong. Through all the shit I had this was a constant beacon of light. 

I did a lot of cardio during Summer(Dec, Jan, Feb) and it died down during the rest of the year but kept the low carb diet up. I tried keeping my calories around 1300-1500 but I never really counted, just the carbs. I went from XXXXXXL pants(God, typing that! That's 48"") to a size 36"" waist. My XXL t-shirts are now L. My belt has been taken in more times that I can remember.

I also wanted to thank each and every one of you that helped give me the motivation, the courage, and the will to do this. Seeing people just like me having lost it and more make me know I could do it too. I still have a lot of work on building muscle, tightening up and ahem, getting a tan. But this is the first time I can say that I did it. The fat is gone. Forever.

This is an update to my progress, that I wanted to share with every one, in hopes that It will keep people motivated, like every one here has help motivate me.

 Its hard to think, but when I first started looking through Loseit, I was reading peoples call for help, to get motivated again, after they had lost a lot of weight. I thought to my self, they look so good, they have lost all that weight. What on earth, could bring down their motivation.

 I finally realize that lack of motivation, even after losing the weight. For me, it started with cheat meals, I would give my self one a week, then it turned into 3, then 5.. I have slowly reverted, in a matter of 3 weeks, back to how I was eating before I started my weight loss journey.

*Update*  People have been asking, and I should have put this to begin with, but a quick snapshot of what my diet was like, and my work out routine.

I was strict, with a 1200 Cal/day + 1 hour cardio nearly every day. I ate very clean, grilled chicken, tuna, and lots of almonds. Salad and vegies of course. Hardly ever ate any carbs, other than wild rice.
Drank nothing but water.

Work out routine

I am going at least 4 times a week, and mainly working cardio. today, I did 20 min jog on the treadmill, then cooled down with a half mile walk 3.5mph at 10 incline. I then went and worked my arms, and abs for 20 mins, then did a 20 min run on the exercise bike set at 7 resistance. Finished up my cardio on an elliptical for 20 mins. I will normally do arm/chest/abs in between each cardio.

Finally, after seven months, I made the big jump to the -200 Club. 

How I did it:

I used multiple methods. At first, I did a modified Weight Watchers plan where I cut out the rewards points counted fruits against the daily points allowance. I lost 50 pounds using this method. 

Then I transitioned to strict calorie counting with My Fitness Pal. This was good for the next 120 pounds. 

The last 30 pounds has been fairly difficult-- mainly because I've been taking off fat and putting on muscle, which skews the scale. I switched to IIFYM and four days of week of strength training bookended by two cardio days. 

I just want you all to remember: you're so much more than a number on a scale. You're more than your waistline or the size shirt you wear. You are capable of *so much*-- more than you'd *ever* believe.

(Just too lazy to take a picture at 4 in the morning)

So where do I even start? Well... I suppose the start, if y'all don't mind stories. 

One of my first memories as a child was me in our tiny little bathroom looking in the mirror, I was around 6 or 7 at this time, with my shirt pulled half way up my torso. I was holding my belly fat. Lifting it up, and pulling it against me so it looked like I was thin. I remember my sister walking in and giving me a strange look. I told her that I wished I didn't have all ""this skin"" on my stomach, and that I would look so much better without it. I don't remember her reply, but the thing that sticks out in my memory is the fact that as a child the thing I was looking at when I looked in the mirror was my fat and how I wished it wasn't there. I even used to wear those stretchy, nude, bandage things that people wrap around a sprained ankle around my stomach so it looked like I was more thin. Shapewear for a seven year old. 

Being the chubby kid in school was really hard for me. I grew up with my single mother and older sister in a trailer park where money was very scarce. Well that combined with being overweight caused a lot of teasing. I remember one year of school my mother had bought me a new shirt, and I wore it to school. This was a huge deal because all my clothing was hand-me-downs, and I had picked out the hot pink piece myself. When we all went out to recess one boy came up to me and asked if I was pregnant because I looked so fat. Ever since that moment my confidence was broken, and is still not all there today. 

In third grade we moved in with my mothers boyfriend and he was super strict with food. There was no soda, no junk food, we never went out to eat, and all the snacks in the house were locked up in a cupboard away from us kids. We always ate lots of veggies, or else we went hungry. I very quickly lost all the weight and was even considered a normal size even though I thought I was still fat.

Eventually their relationship ended and we moved in with another guy. All my sugary vices were at my disposal again. I ate lots of junk food, and only drank soda. I was surprised when I didn't gain weight, but I think it was because I was very active at that time. I danced, and my friend lived an hour walk away, so everyday I got at least two hours of walking in. It wasn't until high school came around that things changed. 

I decided to go to a different high school than everyone I knew that was on the other side of town, so I was a major outcast. I've always been very socially awkward and shy, so I didn't make any new friends. At this point I was alone, so I didn't do any sort of exercise to keep the pounds off.

I gained some weight, but only 10 or so pounds. I was always too busy playing World of Warcraft to really eat anything. I started gaining weight when I started intentionally missing school. My mom had decided to become a truck driver, and she left me home alone with her boyfriend, and my sister had moved out, so I left very abandoned. I was skipping to get someone's attention. Well, I only saw her for two days once a month, so she really didn't know, or pay attention. 

I started channeling my emotions into food. I would eat and eat and eat because I felt lonely. My mother's boyfriend would pick me up breakfast from Tim Hortons, and then we would always eat fast food. I developed quite the taste for mushroom swiss burgers actually. 

Things ended up getting worse when that man abused me. After that my weight sky rocketed. I didn't even notice either. I didn't really care much anyways. I became depressed, and developed social anxiety, so I couldn't, and didn't want to go anywhere. 

So skip forward to 2012. Starting around July I had really noticed the fact I had gained some serious weight. I wanted to change, but my boyfriend at the time always said he didn't care, and that he thought I was fine, so I never really acted on it. Eventually in August we broke up.

I spent a lot of time moping around. Because I was alone I felt really unattractive, and I was disappointed that I had let myself get to where I was. In October I decided to make a change.

I started off small at first. I cut out soda cold turkey, and I tried to start reducing my portion sizes. Just from that I noticed my clothing fitting a lot better. I started to count calories as well. That really made the weight come off. My jacket before had been almost too small, and around early December I noticed it was starting to get roomy!

I wish I could provide a before weight.... but we didn't have a scale at the time, so I don't know. However, In February we finally got a scale and I weighed myself. I was at 175, even though I had already lost a good bit. 

Right now I'm 132, and I couldn't be happier, I'd like to lose a little more weight, but either way I'm very proud of myself. I never thought I'd be able to do this. To lose the weight from 175 I cut out almost all red meat except for a treat every now and again. I eat small meals through out the day. I take multi-vitamins. I eat lots of salads, and yogurt. I keep my calories to 1200 a day, and I find it's more than enough to satisfy me. Exercise wise I don't really do much. I walk my dogs for about an hour each day if that counts. I also sometimes squeeze my butt muscles while I'm watching TV, but I don't really think that does anything, it just makes me feel more productive... 

Overall I feel like a brand new person, and it's an amazing feeling.

I was never a skinny guy by any means, but I was fairly active growing up; I was one of the bigger guys on the football team (o-line) but I wasn't in terrible shape. I went in to my first year of university (2009/2010) at around 250lbs with no intention of gaining weight, like anyone else. Cue the freshman 15, and the sophomore 20. I hit around 285 the summer after my third year (2011) and decided to try and lose a little weight. 

I decided to start working out that summer and dropped about 25lbs. Cue my third year of university, and the toughest year of my life. I won't go into details, but suffice it to say I lost my grandmother, to whom I was incredibly close, as well as a good childhood friend. I totally let myself go; I put on 42 lbs in 6-8 months and essentially didn't emerge from my room. 

7 months ago at the end of March 2012, I hit my highest weight, at 302lbs (http://imgur.com/O0Gxi). In the following weeks, I decided to actually try and make a lifestyle change, deciding enough was really enough.

I started a hard program involving 3 days of high intensity interval training/body weight circuit training and 2 days of DC strength each week, in addition to using MyFitnessPal to track calories. Since April, I've dropped 62lbs, and I'm feeling great (http://imgur.com/w5n71). I'm by no means finished yet, but this is the first time I've actually felt confident with the results and willing to post them.

Here's to progress :)

I startet on October 2011 with 235lbs. I did the following things to reach this: 

In October 2011 I started counting calories. I only ate around 1500kcal per day. I also started doing some sport. For the first few weeks I rode my stationary bike for 30 minutes, soon 40 minutes and ended up with 50 minutes. I did this until summer spring 2012. Then I began to ride my bike outside. Summer '12 was so hot that I stopped bicycling and I gained again some weight.

In November 2012 a friend of mine invited me to his gym. I liked it because it was something different. Riding a bike gets boring after a time and I also wanted to gain some muscles. Well and this is how I lost very fast weight - by weightlifting. At the beginning I didn't really know what to do so I just trained every part of my body and went every day to the gym. I gained some muscles and felt that I became stronger. Then I started to organize myself. I started a split-programe and now I go 3 times a week to the gym for weightlifting. One day I just run for 45 minutes on the treadmill. It's really amazing how my body changed. At the beginning I couldn't run for 10 minutes, now I can run like forever. Seriously I don't have to stop, my stamina became awesome and I can run faster and jump higher like most of the people I know. 

Anyways, here are some pictures and I even found the post when I started this thing. Kind of cringey but hey, bananas. Awesome that I could reach my goals and I even went further. (Notice: ""this train goes to: 175 lbs!"")
Also I want to know: Am I ugly? I know this isn't the right subreddit but yeah.

I remember being that weight freshman year in high school, which was when I felt most comfortable with how I looked. 2012 was the first time I didn't make that resolution because I finally had given up and was tired of being disappointed. Up until then, I'd done P90X, P90X Lean, and Insanity all the way through while only losing 15 pounds TOTAL thanks to a PCOS diagnosis the year before, which is so goddamn defeating, man.

At the end of 2011, I started seeing a nutritionist to learn how to manipulate my body chemistry to overcome all the hurdles present when trying to lose weight with PCOS. She taught me the importance of pairing any carbs I eat with a protein or fat so I could overcome the insulin resistance and helped me plan out a one-week juice fast to get over that initial hump. I watched Fat, Sick, and Nearly Dead to get pumped about juicing and dove right in. The weight has been falling off ever since, though not without what feels like a herculean amount of effort.

I meticulously count my calories. I lift heavy weights 4-5x a week, run 3-4x a week (with a reward trail run on Saturday mornings with my dogs if I run MWF), box with my heavy bag 3x a week, and do as much yoga as possible (usually 3x a week). I'm blessed to work a job that gives me a paid hour daily to work out, so that gives me the chance to go 1.5-2 hours a day without cutting into personal time too much.

Maintenance is easy for me, and I'm completely aware of how lucky that makes me. Since I'm so active, I can eat until I'm stuffed on a regular basis without gaining. I'm starting to transition into eating at least maintenance calories so my lifts will start going up again because I need the strength gains for training.

I fell in love with fitness while on this journey. I thought for awhile that I wanted to be a personal trainer, but I realized this summer that it was time to make my dream of firefighting a reality and I'll be applying to my city's fire department in the spring. If you'd talked to the fat version of me from last year and told her that she'd be able to drag a 165lb sled around the gym for 10 minutes, she would've laughed. But now I'm all over that shit and can't wait to show it off at my CPAT next year.

My original goal was 175 lbs. Now I'm there and it's still easy enough to lose that I think I may have a 165 or even a 160 in me. We'll see. Anyway, here are the pictures.

I was nearly 42 years old and feeling gross I was 5' 4 1/2"" and 184 pounds with a 35"" waist. Eating a mostly vegan/pescatarian diet for the previous three years wasn't doing me any favors. 

I went low-carb and used myfitnesspal to track my calories and exercise (which consisted of biking to work.) But then a month later, I found the paleo/primal diet. I read Robb Wolf's book, The Paleo Solution and Mark Sisson's book The Primal Blueprint and changed up my diet even more. I stopped eating grains, vegetable oils, legumes, and sugars. I started eating meat, eggs, full fat dairy, and even more vegetables than I was eating before. I stopped tracking my calories and started focusing on high quality real food.

I cook my of my meals at home and try to stay paleo when I eat out but I do indulge in cheat/treats without feeling guilt. Paleo is not a religion for me so there is no sin in having an occasional chocolate chip cookie or more-than-occasional ice cream. 

Now, over a year later, I am 127 lbs (still 5' 4 1/2""!) with a 27"" waist. I've started lifting weights and doing pilates. I hope to update at r/fitness with that progress in a year.

I started at 550+ and am now down to 470.  These are the things I’ve been doing to create a change in my lifestyle that would promote a healthy weight so it’s not a ‘diet’. I’m just changing my habits. 

The number one tip I can give is to make small, realistic, achievable changes in your life that you can stick to without suffering.  
My first step was to give up fast food.  I started by picking 2 restaurants I’d no longer frequent.  So I tried to keep myself from eating fast food in general, but specifically I’d never go to McDonalds or KFC.  After a month, I added another 2 to the list, and so on.  Now I don’t crave any fast food whatsoever.  It just doesn’t really occur to me to eat it any more.  

Next I wanted to tackle my snacking.  I ate out of boredom, and I was a frequent snacker.  I picked one snack food to ween myself off of: potato chips, and when I got accustomed to that, I phased out other snacks.   At the same time I was trying to get myself to eat fruits and raw vegetables more frequently.  So I’d make myself eat at least ONE piece of fruit or serving of raw veggies a day, whatever and however I wanted.  Those healthy snacks started to replace the bad ones, and the frequency of my snacks diminished as well. 

Next was Diet cola.  I drank 2 liters of diet soda daily, EASILY.  I started by only letting myself have it with meals, and replacing the other times diet teas, and then ice water with lemon.   Now I’m down to only a glass or two a week.  
Basically it comes down to this.  You start small, and you pick small things to phase out of your life, and it all ends up adding together to big long term changes.  So far I’m down over 70 pounds, and I’m much healthier.  At no point was it difficult because I wasn’t doing anything drastic.  

Now I’m working on exercise.  I found a personal trainer I meet with once a week. He’s helping me to build up lean muscle and increase my range of motion, as well as teaching me how and what to work out for maximum calorie burning.  Now that I’ve gotten used to that, I’m thinking about going for a short walk every morning before work, but I’m going to start with making sure that I go at least ONE day a week and working my way up from there.

You don’t have to throw your entire way of being upside down to lose weight.  You can make small changes, and in time you WILL see improvement.

After topping out at around 250lb last year I knew something needed to change. I was nearly 18 stone, unfit, and lacked motivation. 

I've always been a big guy at 6'4. And I played rugby in my final year of my under-graduate degree and built myself up to a decent level of fitness. Then piled all the weight back on during my post-grad course.

One day I made the decision to download an iOS app called Interval Run, which is an interval-based 5k training program. So I just went out and start running, going further and further each time. But from doing this I didn't really see any weightloss.

After a few months of running the dark nights came in and I decided to join the gym to carry on. The only problem with my gym is that it's a small community gym with hardly any equipment (two treadmills + the rest) and when it gets busy there's a 15 minute limit. So I started to do some weights.

I got in touch with an old friend of mine who had gone into personal training and he said he would develop a workout program for me. After 4 months I was starting to really notice the weight come off.

Through a combination of upper and lower body days with some cardio included the weight fell off, and after reaching 35lb lost I decided to take him up on his offer of a nutrition plan.

The initial plan involved 'alkalising' my body, and getting it adjusted over a six week period before going into carb-backloading.

After an initial 9 days of ultra-low carbs to reprogram myself I'm now on a program of backloading on training days and eating low carbs when I'm not training. It can be tough on some days but I'm so pleased I've made the change and have adjusted to this - the comments and support from friends and family make it all totally worth it.

So I'm now down to 205lb (204.8 to be precise), and I'm now working on building muscle rather than lose weight to fill out. So here's to the next 8 months!

Why is 42lb a milestone? If you're from the UK you may know it's 3 stone. So I've gone from 17 stone 8 to 14 stone 8.

Edit: I've gone from an XL to a L (M in some cases), 38"" to a 36"" waist and an 18"" collar to a 16.5"" too!

Thanks again for the inspiring stories and personal encouragement.  I'm doing calorie counting on loseit.com and I'm now down 25 lbs since mid march. 

I'm starting to fit into shirts that I haven't fit for many years.  Also in 2005 I had cancer and chemotherapy where I lost about 25 lbs but gained it back after I got better.  Now I've lost it again, but for all the right reasons this time!

My goals have to do with math--ten percent loss, halfway to my goal weight, etc...
Getting under 200 lbs is a big one.  I haven't been there since my mid teens.  I'm 41 right now.  

I'm starting to see a difference in the mirror.  This is a bit freaky, because I'm not sure if I'm fooling myself or actually seeing a change.  A big part of being overweight is fooling yourself.  I'm sure many of you know what I mean.

I [F/27] reached my highest scale number ever last year at 140 lbs at 5'1. I was active for pretty much my entire life. I did swimming from the time I was 9 to about 15. Between 16 and 22, I went to the gym regularly and was always in good shape. During that time I was between 110 and 120 lbs. I'm not a naturally skinny person... I would describe myself as curvy with decent muscle definition (think Beyonce). I'm also a very obvious pear-shape. 

After I graduated from college, I was on and off about exercising. And finally between 24 and 26 yo, I simply was not exercising at all. 
Last year, I realized I was overweight. Plain and simple. I had let myself go way too far, so I decided to lose 20 lbs. 

**THE PLAN**

** Start date: April 2012**
This is how I looked like at the beginning (February, 2012):
http://imgur.com/KQSrIBj
http://imgur.com/KcGjHic

My first target was to reduce portion size. I was eating more than most of my male co-workers at lunch time (and I hadn't noticed until they told me lol). I'm a very petite girl, and there is no reason for me to munch on more than the average sized male. 

Step 1 was to download the LoseIt! app and trying to stick to 1200 cals daily. [Side note: I kept at it for about 6 months, which was enough to 'teach' me how to eat. I stopped because I hit a plateau and wanted to see what happened if I simply tried to eat healthy. At that time I also upped the exercise.]

As far as exercise, I was in BAD shape. I started by walking for 30 min every morning. I also recruited a personal trainer who helped me once a week. I did this routine of walking/1x trainer session for about 3-4 months. During this time I lost about 8 lbs. 

This is what I looked like at -8 lbs (August, 2012):

http://imgur.com/K8QPUmk

**Time to get Serious: September, 2012**
Around this time, I was pretty clueless about what to do. I wasn't losing weight as fast as I did initially. I stopped counting calories because I was tricking myself. It was like ""Ohhh, I still have 300 cals left tonight... let me eat and extra portion of lasagna"". I comitted myself to eating as healthy as I could, and to work out more. 

I talked to my trainer, who had been working on conditioning me for the previous months. He happens to be an MMA fighter. I asked him to teach me kickboxing, and to train me for 3-4 times a week. He agreed. I stopped walking in the mornings, I needed the extra sleep LOL. 

At some point in time, I came across the Insanity vids. I resolved to do Insanity on at least 2 of my days off. Thanks to my training, I managed to survive the vids and wasn't scared off to death the first time I tried them. I was getting definitely stronger. 

By January, 2013 I had reached the 120 lbs:

http://imgur.com/OYTBExf

http://imgur.com/EdspGq3

**What happened after I reached my goal?**

Since January, I have lost an additional 3 lbs. I ditched the Insanity, and have picked up new disciplines/sports. I made a return to yoga after a 4 year hiatus (I had practiced for 2 yrs before). I have found my practice to be sooooo different now. I'm bolder and more confident.  I'm able to achieve poses I thought impossible before. 

This is my new party trick:
http://imgur.com/GV0uKYZ

I also joined a running club. I run 5km once or twice a week at nights. I thought I wasn't going to be able to keep up with them, but so far I'm doing good. I'm still not able to run/jog all the way through, but my walking time is minimal. I'm working on limiting that as time goes by and I get used to running. I have never been a runner in my entire life. I'm surprised that I actually like it... the experience of running with a group is amazing :)

This is what I look like right now at 117 lbs [April, 2013]:
http://imgur.com/FXao8Dt

The current workout routine is basically kickboxing 3-4 times a week (he is bumping it up and teaching me some brazilian jijuitsu now), running 5k 1-2 times per week, and yoga 1-2 times per week. 
I eat pretty much whatever I want but obviously, in decent sized portions. I eat clean 80% of the time (minimal flours, some grains, plenty of protein and veggies/fruits). I also snack between meals (mostly raw almonds, fruit or granola bars). I ditched sodas unless I have a special occassion. I do have desserts about once a week. 
I honestly don't feel limited about the way I eat :)

**Future Goals**

I don't have a scale number in mind that I want to reach anymore. I want to avoid going over 120 lbs, that's for sure. 
The way I'm going exercise/diet wise, I think it's possible I'll lose more weight. If I get to 110 lbs, great but I don't want to really go anywhere beyond 105 lbs (the lowest range BMI wise). 

My goals are more fitness related. For example, being a better runner, continuing to improve my yoga practice, learning even more MMA. Being stronger, more focused. 

**Closing Comments/Advice**

1) If you want to lose weight, pick a day to start and make a plan for your life beginning that day. If you pick tomorrow, figure out EVERYTHING you will do starting tomorrow. Make an exercise schedule for the week, make a meal plan for the week, etc. 

2) Exercise-wise, don't burn yourself out from day 1. If you are aware you are not in the greatest shape, don't go crazy with it. Start S-L-O-W. Take a walk once a day... don't go to the gym 5 days a week, try 3 for the first month or 2. As time goes by, bump it up. And once you feel you can go at it, train HARD. Make that 1 hr of your day you are working out worth it. Feel your heart pumping, sweat it. You know what I'm talking about. 

3) Food is KEY. If you work out like a crazy person but eat badly, you won't see the results of your hard work. Do small changes that make a big impact. Cut soda out, use skim or 1% milk instead of whole, eat smaller meals, fill up with low cal foods (eat a salad with every meal for example). Count calories if you feel you need to learn about portion size. 

4) Don't let plateaus scare you. They happen to everyone. Switch it up, exercise-wise. You've been doing weights twice a week? Try 3. Instead of running, try swimming. The possibilities are endless and you can keep switching until something works. 

5) Don't be prey to the routine. If you eat the same things every day, you'll get bored. If you make a meal plan, switch it every 2 months or so. Same with your workouts. Look up different ways to work your different body parts. 

6) No gym? No problem. The internet and exercise vids are your friends. There's Insanity, P90X, Jillian Michaels... sooo many options. I also really like sites like www.blogilates.com (if you want something low impact, this is NOT a walk in the park). 
Also, you can try outdoor activities. My point is, there are MANY ways you can work out regardless of lack of equipment. 

7) Make exercise a part of your daily schedule. Pick a non-negotiable time of the day to do it. If you can only work out at night, do it BEFORE dinner (have a snack beforehand if needed). It's amazing to work your ass off and then have a nice meal.

8) Every single bit of exercise counts. You don't have 1 full hour at lunch time? It's fine, do 30 min of cardio. You can do the other 30 min of weights at night. The point is, you can split your exercise time if your agenda works better that way. 

9) Celebrate your NSV's!!!! Managed to run 20 min on the treadmill without fainting??? Be happy about that. Be happy about being able to do anything you couldn't do before. Be grateful to your body. 

10) Beware of alcohol empty cals. Seriously, going out a couple times a week was making it harder for me to lose weight. Have a couple of drinks, but drink some mineral water in between each drink (or plain water). Also, dance. You'll burn some of that alcohol off that way. 

11) Get a support group and ignore the haters. The LoseIt community has helped me inmensely. Seeing your pix and knowing there's people out there with the same struggles, is priceless. Also, there will be critics so be prepared. There will be people who say you are eating too little, or exercising too much even if what you are doing is perfectly healthy. Don't get sucked in. Don't go under any of the recommended guidelines for daily caloric intake though!!!!

12) Love and work what you have. I have hated my pear shape for as long as I remember. The fitter I've gotten, the more proportionate I look. I have noticed that no matter your body shape (boys and girls), fit people ALWAYS look better. Plus, you will never know you are awesome at something until you try it. Always wanted to try rowing? Give it a shot... you might surprise yourself ;)

That's it, guys. Hope I can help someone reading this :)

**TL/DR:** Made it to my -20lbs goal with diet and exercise. If you want to know the story, you'll have to read :P

**Edit:** Thank you SO much for all your compliments! :) It has meant a lot to me and definitely encourages me to continue my journey. Good luck to all of those wanting to start your own journey or in the middle of it. I'm here if you ever need anything ;)

Today I am at my half way mark, and expect it will be some time before I reach my overall goal but as we all should learn to love and accept, this is one of those never ending journey type things, and I'm pretty okay with that.

To lose weight I've been using the ""loseit"" app to track calories and macronutrients. I'm not doing any strict keto/atkins type thing, however I do try to eat less than 30 precent carbs because that is what works best for me (IE: keeps me energized and full).
For those of you who are curious, my starting weight was 296(size 3x, 22 pants), my current weight is 226 (Size xl, 14 pants).

There are days I don't see a difference, there are days I beat myself up, but for the most part this entire battle is against yourself so I just try and push the negativity aside. I try and remember what it felt like to have all my clothes fit so tightly. To get winded doing household chores. I try and focus on how much more I can do VS how much better I look because I know myself well enough to know no matter what weight loss I accomplish, growing up as the fat kid has impacted the way I see myself indefinitely, sure that will mold and change as time goes but there's always gonna be one of those days.

In the beginning of my weight loss, I would come to this sub to see threads about how people were achieving their goals, pictures of their progress, and comments and support around those achievements. As someone just starting to lose weight, this had a great mental impact on me.


I understand the Moderator's concerns for the amount of NSV threads and Progress Picture threads, but honestly, to me, this is what loseit is about. People should be proud of what they do. They should be able to get positive feedback from people on it.


I know you can find it in the weekly threads now, which until now I haven't even looked at it. I typically sort by what's hot (like I'm sure a lot of others do to), and I don't end up seeing the NSV or Progress Pictures threads. Even after finding it in the side bar today and looking at it, it's full of great NSVs that aren't seen. They either are sitting at 1 upvote or 2, and have no comments.


To me, the positive comments and reinforcement from the community on things even as simple as NSVs are extremely helpful in motivating me further.


I feel like I've seen hardly any progress pictures recently. It seems like a few months ago these would be everywhere. Again, maybe this is just the lack of people posting them, or maybe the moderators.
Another thing that slightly bothers me is the lack of links. Maybe this is why I perceive there being less progress pictures, since I can't identify them immediately. I know Karma is an imaginary thing, but clearly it makes people happy. And anything that lifts someone's spirits should be encouraged, in this subreddit of all places. There was a great post a few months ago that someone posted here along the lines of, ""If anyone deserves the right to post a link for karma, it's people posting progress pics for all the hard work you've done.""


Regardless, I feel like letting people post their own threads are what loseit is about. There is an upvote/downvote system for a reason. If people like what they will see, they will send it up to the top. If not, it will get a few comments, a few upvotes, and be left alone. But even those few comments can change someone's thought about their success and give them the strength to keep going, as opposed to not receiving comments in the weekly thread and thinking, ""Well, I guess it wasn't a big deal.""

I started around December, 2011 with the initial goal of 200lbs.  I told myself if I got to that weight and wanted to maintain it, I could.  Currently, my goal is the same, but I expect at 200lbs, I'll re-asses down to 180.

What do I do? Calorie Count, and occasionally StepMania.  I religiously weigh (every day), and if it goes in my mouth, it goes in my calorie counter.  I started with 1800 calories (I think), then dropped it down to 1500.  Then around last spring I dropped it to 1200, and last summer/fall I dropped my limit to 1000.  It's been there since.

I'm an active reader of this sub and have been the whole way, and I don't think I could have done it without all of you.  Your progress pics reminded me where I could be, and also reassured me that even when the going got slow or rough, that didn't mean the progress I made didn't happen.

I started in late 2010, with a medical supervised diet. Watching what I was eating, and calorie reduction. But in 2011 I started an exercise regiment (walking, and bicycling) as well as completing surgery for Vertical Gastrectomy.  (see my old posts on it [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/loseit/comments/kbq3i/bariatric_patient_68_lbs_so_far/), [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/loseit/comments/l5tag/lost_bariatric_patient_update_100lbs_lost_so_far/), and [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/loseit/comments/qnbqv/my_journey_from_518_to_334_photos/)) 

In addition to my surgery, I was granted access to the hospital owned fitness center for free for a year. But after having to wait for machines and fitness classes taking over 1/2 of the center I haven't returned in sometime. I found it easier to walk, or ride my bicycle around my neighborhood. I was thinking about signing up with YMCA or different private gym one that has a pool because I love to swim. 

My friends, family, and coworkers have been enormously supportive. Which has contributed greatly to my success. I know I have a long way to go before I'm medically ""healthy"" but I believe in another short year I will have lost another 100 pounds.

Better shot of my face from two weeks ago: http://imgur.com/fbfE81c

Pic on the left is from my friend's graduation in May of 2012. I remember wearing that dress, which was a little too short for my comfort. I spent most of the ceremony self consciously wondering if people were grossed out by my legs and arms as much as I was. My friend snapped this picture, and I begged her not to put it on Facebook. I'm glad she did, since I avoided having my photo taken at all costs. I was so ashamed of my body. Depressed because I weighed so much, ate because I was depressed. Caught in the vicious cycle.

But here I am, 85 pounds lighter than I was a year ago. Most of my weight loss was the result of my diet and willpower. I cook for a living, so food is always readily available. It's like having a buffet line in front of you for 11 hours a day! I had to learn that food shouldn't be a supplement for boredom during the workday!

I really didn't start exercising, I mean REALLY getting to the gym until about two months ago. I would go maybe once or twice a week, always making excuses to why I couldn't go more. I loathed working out in all honesty... But now I've made exercise part of my daily routine. I get up early every morning and do 30-60 minutes of cardio at the gym, and then 30 minutes of toning at home. I love Denise Austin's body sculpting videos from the 80's because they are low impact, and I work 11-14 hours, 5 days a week, so I don't want to be exhausted before I even begin my shift. There are some days that I don't get to the gym, and that's okay! I don't want to over do it!

I think that diet and exercise were both extremely important factors on my road to where I am now... But being able to find happiness and self purpose in life has allowed me to come this far. It is very difficult to be depressed, knowing that you want to make a change, to better yourself, but not have any drive to get there. It brought me down farther each time I would fail, and I would always find comfort in food. 

I am not where I want to be, but I am definitely closer to my weight and fitness goals than I have ever been. One day at a time!

I still have some weight to lose, but I hope someone will see my own progress and realize that it is very possible to do.  

To give some back story, I was an incredibly lazy, unmotivated, compassionless blob.  At 6'2 363 pounds, I was fairly gargantuan in stature.  However, I was as tepid as a field mouse inside.  I hated every bit of myself.  I hated that I was so big and ate so much, I hated that I was too shy to talk to anyone, I hated that I spent 95% of my time away from work at my computer desk, playing online games where I could make friends because I felt safe that nobody could see me.  My turning point was a combination of 2 events: Christmas 2010, I was with my family and someone told a joke that everyone laughed at.  As I was laughing, I turned my head to one of my distant relatives whom I rarely ever see or speak to..  And I see her point at me, laugh more, and exclaim, ""He looks like a little Pekingese!!"".  I was immensely hurt.  She was referring to the fact that when I smiled, my cheeks pushed up and covered up most of my eyes.  But.. I pushed it aside and moved on.  A few days later, back home in Baton Rouge, I was getting home from work and walking upstairs to get to my apartment on the 2nd floor of the complex.  I went up one flight of stairs and was completely winded.  To the point that I had to lean on the railing and catch my breath once I got to the top.  At that moment, something clicked.  I realized it had to stop.. something had to change.  I was slowly killing myself.  A week later I threw out all of the food I had and went grocery shopping - Atkins style.  I lost tons of weight on Atkins and was on it for about 9 or 10 months, then I decided to make the switch to a paleo-esque diet and started working out and have done this lifestyle for about a year.  I'm not the most dedicated gymgoer, but in a typical month I probably see the gym between 8-12 times, and I walk on off days at least 2-3 times a week.

I've gone from a 4XL shirt to an XL, and from a 50 pant size to a 38.  I've experience a lot more of my life in the last year than I had the previous 23 before it.  I had never had sex before, I was a virgin at 23 years old, and had never even kissed anyone before.  I've met many new friends and faces, and am not afraid to be myself anymore.  In fact, I love myself most of the time.  I know that I am a great person, inside and out.  Of course, I have moments where some of those old negative thoughts come back.. losing weight is as much of a mental struggle as it is a physical one and as time goes on, I know I will overcome the mental blocks that show up.  As I said in another thread, there is no internal growth without adversity.  Rise up and destroy adversity and grow.  It's what life is all about.

What changes have YOU seen so far?",553,137,213,http://www.reddit.com/r/loseit/comments/oei6e/lost_after_100_pounds_lost_life_is_different_than/,"Forgive me if I overstep by posting this - I read the posting FAQ, I THINK this post is ok. 

My weight loss journey started 2 years ago - I was 330 pounds, depressed, horrified at how I'd let myself go (I'm 5'11"" and ""wear my weight well"" but there is a limit, and it isn't anywhere NEAR 330). Through better food choices and becoming more active, I have slowly lost over 100 pounds now. I still have about 40 pounds to where I'd love to start my maintenance, but reading through threads today I realized that there are many things that I've already been able to enjoy even though I haven't made it through the finish line.

* I can now fit in airplane seats.
* I spend less money on food overall (more on groceries slightly, but significantly less on eating out and fast food!) 
* I was able to hike over 1000 miles on the Appalachian Trail this summer - I'd never even camped overnight before, but I've always wanted to be ""outdoorsy"" so I threw myself right into it! There were times I thought I might die, but I did really well, and was much stronger by the end of my hike!
* Less people assume I am stupid and/or lazy. What a terrible and usually untrue stereotype for very obese people. 
* People meet my eyes when they talk to me. I still struggle with doing the same.
* I can fit into (the high end of) off-rack normal-sized clothing for the first time since I was in high school (I'm 32). 
* I can workout like a boss and enjoy the endorphins I get from it.
* I have finished two 5k races and look forward to the weather warming up so I can do some more
* People just treat me differently now. I never realized how biased people can be when you're very overweight until I had something to compare it to.
* I have actually had guys offer to buy me drinks. That's a first.
* I can fit on amusement park rides!
* People don't look mad if I try to sit next to them on airplanes or transportation.
* Friends don't automatically assume I have to sit in the front seat of a car anymore when we carpool to places.
* I can wear shirt that show off my back tattoo without worrying about my back fat.
* I CAN CROSS MY LEGS COMFORTABLY WHILE SITTING!!!! LIKE A LADY!

Looking back (there are more, but this post is already a book!) at the changes, I wonder what things will be like when I hit goal weight.  A lot of the changes need to be mental and emotional for me as I near my goal weight - I know enough to realize that there is no magical unicorn waiting to rush me away from all of my worries in life once the scale hits a certain number. But things are better, and it's motivation to see this journey through to the end.

I can't wait until I'm able to post my before/after pics - they're already pretty great, I think, but I want to celebrate a final success when I get there. :) Thank you for reading this long post, and please share the changes YOU'VE seen! I'd love to read them for even more motivation... and if you're just starting out or have a long way to go, that's ok - I'd love to hear what changes you're looking forward to as well!

I am 5'10"" and I started my journey to weight loss in [August of 2009](http://i.imgur.com/U1MPf.jpg) when I tipped the scales at just over 300 lbs. Currently I weigh in at 172 lbs. and still have a bit more work to do [May 2011](http://i.imgur.com/Fqr4z.jpg), or me shirtless in [March 2011](http://i.imgur.com/JRfez.jpg). I will say though, that none of it would have been possible if I didn't have the support of my then girlfriend, now fiancée, who needs to do her own post :P

In my first year of weight loss is when I got the most weight off (100lbs.) and I have a seen a steady decline from then as I stopped burning everything off and started adding more lean muscle. My routine/diet are fairly simple:
6:00 am - Get to the gym (more on routine in a bit)
8:00 am - Home, 40g of whey protein, shower and head to class/lab/work
10:00 am - Snack consisting of some fruit
12:00 pm - Sandwich or wrap with lots of veggies
2:00 pm - Snack on some more fruit
5:00 pm - High protein, moderate carb, low fat dinner
8:00 pm - 25g of casein

At the gym I have two types of days, lifting and non lifting days, with core work done each day whether I am at the gym or not. For non lifting days I do about 45 minuets of cardio (30/15 split on the elliptical and stationary bike). There are three different lifting days upperbody 1, upperbody 2, and legs, and I do about 30 minuets of cardio (all on the elliptical). Upperbody 1 consists of back and shoulder exercises and upper body 2 is arms and chest.

I also included my graph, because I'm a visual person and actually seeing the consistent loss is motivation for me. Hopefully I can help motivate others here as many before have done for me.

I lost about 40lbs by doing light cardio and lowering my intake. I plateaued around 220lbs and so switched to a ketogenic diet (thanks to /r/keto) and the last 20-ish pounds just fell off.

Something had to change. 

I made a New Year's resolution which lasted two weeks before I fell back into bad eating habits. Fast forward to April 1, 2013. I'm at work on Monday, and even though I was not actively doing anything to lose weight, I had been tracking my weight each week since October 2012. I weighed 380, and as I wrote down my weight, I looked at the other entries, and realized how far I could have come if I would have just lost 1-2 lbs a week, not to mention how fast all that time had flown by. 

I then decided to try again, but this time I didn't look at where I needed to be. Instead I challenged myself to commit for two months, and see where it got me. I lost 36 lbs in those first two months just by changing my diet, but that's not what I came here to say. This isn't about how much weight I lost, or how I did it. This is about taking the first step by not worrying about how far it is to the finish line. 

When I had wanted to start, I felt the journey that lay before me was too difficult, why bother, surely I would fail again, but when I completed those two months I didn't want to stop. The number on the scale is a powerful thing, and once you see it begin to fall, you'll only wish you had started sooner. 

I just wanted to share for those who, like me, struggle to realize that you don't need to look at the finish line to take the first step.

I am ashamed of what I once was, and I'm still pretty self-conscious / don't like to show a lot of skin on a daily basis. Anyhow, this is me in 2010 two months after I had my daughter. I ballooned when I was pregnant because I was in a really bad relationship and suffered from severe postpartum depression. Basically, I was eating my feelings. 

Most people who know me have no idea that I was ever this big--I've even lied about my weight gain to some, and for that I feel bad.:/ After having my daughter, I became reclusive until I lost a substantial amount of the weight. The after photo is a year after hitting my goal of 120 pounds. I am still there (bouncing between 115-120) and going strong! :) I probably would have never posted this, but today my daughter saw the photo on the left and asked, ""who is that, mommy?"". I was speechless. I hadn't realized how much of a transformation I had made until that very moment. My own child didn't even recognize me. My body image was still so distorted until that moment, but today I can safely say for the first time that I am proud of myself and astonished at what I've accomplished. If I can do it, you can do it, too. :)

The only measurements I have to share are my waist and hips. My waist was 33.5 inches and is now 25.5 and my hips were 42 inches and now they're measuring in at 35 inches!

Oh pics! http://i.imgur.com/j0JD9d2.jpg

Also, the marks around my navel are stretch marks. I had four piercings in that area (top, bottom, left, right) before I became pregnant and pregnancy did not do them any favors. haha They scars have faded a lot though. You can barely see them now. :) Also, on the right it is not cellulite on my legs. I am a fencer, and those are bruises from a night of getting my butt kicked at practice!

Okay, time for me to take a deep breath and hit submit. Eek!

Diet:
Sticking to around 1500 cals a day of healthy food. 1-2 salads a day, chicken, quinoa, brown rice, fruit. If I eat any type of pasta or bread it is 100% whole wheat and I eat small portions. No potato, no white rice. I drink no calories (with the exception of 1 light beer a week). I love seltzer water with a squirt of lemon or lime. Drink about a gallon a day. I tend to let loose a tiny bit on Saturdays to keep myself sane, but generally do not go over 2500 cals.

Exercise:
I will admit that I am slow starting out, but I'm getting around 3-4 times a week on my recumbent bike for about 30mins/6-7 miles. Since it is winter and I live in the north, I put the snow blower away and shovel my drive. That's good for 45 mins of sweat.

Whee! I posted before, when I hit 60. I'm down another 15 pounds and have really started to tell a difference in the last month. Before, when I looked in the mirror it was just me. But thinner. I couldn't really stand to look. Now I've gotten to the point where small changes are really noticeable, and I really don't recognize myself anymore. It's so peculiar, but I love having my photo taken now! 

How did I achieve this turnaround? No freaking clue. What's that joke about how to eat an elephant? I floundered around with weightloss plans, never really finding any that worked for more than 20 pounds, plateauing for months. Low cal, low carb, strict keto. Working out. Not working out. Trying to kill the depression eating. Once I got that under control (and the depression), I started ratting out food sensitivities. I learned to listen to my body. Once that happened the weight just flew off. Also, on a few occasions, my pants. Luckily my neighbors didn't notice the pantsless girl up on a ladder trying not to spill paint as she frantically hobbled down. 

I'm not a fan of vegetables (the texture! ugh..) so I've been digging a lot of vegtable soups as a way to force myself into 2-3 servings of vegetables a day. Today I decided with certainty that if I eat any more butternut squash soup I'm. just. going. to. lose. my. mind. Broccoli soup is cool though.

[Christmas 2010:](http://i.imgur.com/HPyBg.jpg) I am obviously the one on the far right, this is unfortunately the best before pic I have, It was taken about one month before I started dieting when I weighted an estimated 445 at age 27. 

[Christmas 2010 to Christmas 2011 Comparison:](http://i.imgur.com/9PxNd.jpg) This is me during my past two Christmases. I weighed 246 the day the 'after' side was taken.

[At the 1 year mark:](http://i.imgur.com/oenh3.jpg) This is me this past weekend, exactly at the one year mark. Since I was off my diet for this weekend my weight fluctuated wildly, but I would estimate I was at about 234 when this picture was taken.

[Bonus before and after:](http://i.imgur.com/bI4Au.jpg) Obviously no explanation is required.

**Story:** At the end of January 2011 I had a rather interesting weekend where I did not eat much, so last minute I decided ""Why start eating now?"" My diet started at about 1500Kcal a day tracked only in my head. Over a few months it evolved to where I was eating a solid 1200Kcal a day, but every calorie is tracked on MyFitnessPal. I stay consistent by fasting until 5:00PM every day and eating the same set meals repeatedly. It really seems to work for me.

Since I have a bad back my workouts started off slow with light walking and resistance bands. As the year progressed my workouts gained complexity. Now I am the point where I spend 6-8 hours a week lifting, and 60-90 minutes doing cardio.

**Goals:** Over the next few months I want to get down to 200lbs and start on Cheat Mode. It will be nice to be able to eat more and build some muscle.

I am sure there is a lot I have left out, so feel free to ask. Otherwise you can stalk me here:

I've been browsing this subreddit for almost a year, and never felt confident enough to ever post anything. I've kept /r/loseit in my browser tabs while at work, mainly to remind myself and be motivated to maintain my goal. I want to thank you guys for what you do here, and for being so supportive of all the individuals who contribute. Weight-loss isn't easy at first, but it was definitely a journey and an adventure for me. I almost feel sort of sad that I've lost weight now that I'm at a healthy range--being fat was like a challenge, almost like a game to me to see how much I can be capable of losing. And I won. I just hope I can keep up my winning streak. ;)



I was at my worst at 200, maybe 210-ish. I was depressed, in an abusive relationship, and usually turned to food for comfort. It also doesn't help that I'm short. I was constantly making excuses, spent a lot of time whining about my problems to the Internet (where, sadly, people seemed to be more tolerable of me than they are in person due to what I believed was my appearance). My appearance and weight made me so bitter, and fearful of approaching people and making friends. I was socially awkward and I always felt like my body was in the way of people, blocking their path or being an eye sore. At school, it felt pretty painful to be thought of as a living example of a ""fat Asian girl""... which, from my understanding, isn't very common--at least outside of the United States. I've seen very few.

I was always stationary. I didn't exercise and was usually too depressed to. My ex at the time treated me like I was a ghost when we lived together for a year. I was miserable, and only felt that the reason I was kept around in the apartment was to clean up after him and cook. I eventually became fed up with the situation, and with the little friends I had (who provided me so much support and encouragement), I tried to find ways to be happier.

I started exercising, eating healthy, and focusing on my goal. I felt ugly all the time, and it didn't help that my ex was secretly talking to women online while I was alone in bed crying. I wanted to be better, but I didn't do it because of my ex. I wanted a better life for myself and to be treated with fairness and respect, and the first thing I had to do was respect and take care of myself. I was self-deprecating at the time, but now I'm growing more and more in love with myself and the person I'm becoming.

I visited the gym almost 5-6 days a week, each day for about an hour to two hours. My diet consisted mainly lots of water, whole grains, no sweets/starches/anything made with flour/anything really salty. I ate lots of veggies and fruits, particularly apples, cucumbers, broccoli, and spinach. 

I visited the gym way too much. My coworkers noticed and expressed concern. I really wanted to work hard, but I also didn't want to go home to my ex at the time. I tried to find ways to stay away from him and from going home, and the gym was like a second one for me. Going home depressed me, and I would always try my best to avoid the mess of a relationship that waits for me there.  I did various activities and exercises and read closely to whatever posts or information I could scour on /loseit and /fitness. I did this for about two months until my visits were less regular--probably about three times a week now. Why?

I lost weight. People seemed to check me out more. I became more and more confident and social. Eventually, I became very happy. I'd write some more, but I'm very tired. Here's a photo:

In late december of last year, I finally decided I'd had enough of feeling so poorly about myself. I was sick to death of being overweight (which I had been my entire life). I gradually started changing my habits, started working out frequently and started changing my eating habits. I was forgiving about eating the occasional bad thing every now and then, but as time went by, the want for unhealthy food went away.

In January of this year I weighed in at around 270lbs, give or take a few. As of this morning I weighed in at 183lbs. I'm finally light enough and strong enough that I can lift my own weight (for the first time ever), I plan to start rock climbing soon :)

I also focussed on renewing my social life this year. I had fallen out of touch with a lot of my close friends over the years since high school. I had a job and a gf that engulfed the majority of my time. Both of those things have come and gone and I'm happy to say I've both established new social circles, and reconnected with old ones.

I have a new job and a supportive new girlfriend. I've never been more happy and comfortable to be in my own skin, I'm constantly stunned every time I look in the mirror. All my dedication is finally paying off.

I think my highest weight was around 340lbs (possibly more... none of the scales I got on before going to the gym went higher than 300), which happened sometime in 2007/2008 at the tender age of 22. Looking back, I think that at least 70 lbs of the weight was attributable to an undesirable side-effect of SSRIs, but I didn't know that at the time. 

I decided that I was done with being overweight. I constantly had back problems, walking was a chore, going up stairs was a feat, and sitting in any defined chair space (like at the movies, in an airplane, at school) was impossible and embarrassing. As a kid I was pudgy, as a teenager I became obese, and once I was out on my own and able to buy my own food, things got out of hand. 

Livestrong's MyPlate quickly became my best friend. I found a personal trainer who kicked my ass 2 or 3 times a week for almost 4 years, and started to have a shape other than ""blob."" I did keto for awhile, but I just love fruit too damn much. 

When my mom passed away, I ate away my feelings for a few months and gained almost 20lbs back, but once things cleared up, it was back to the routine. Ups and downs, plateaus... it's been tough, I'll say that much. 

I just made a pretty big jump from 1600 kcal/day down to about 1250 kcal/day, and it's getting pretty rough, particularly when lady hormones start taking grasp. Also, whenever I go to the gym, I get incredibly hungry even though I drink a protein shake right after. But we just gotta keep on keepin', right?

I am no scientist, but I have lost a ton of weight and beat a mean sweet tooth. I think this can work for you, and if you are struggling, I would highly recommend it!

The more sugar we eat, the more we want. Your taste buds get used to it - de-sensitized. I used to have a sweet tooth bigger than Texas. I mean I could sit and eat half a jar of frosting by the spoonful, without blinking. I could eat spoonfuls of straight sugar. I would crave sweet things with a desire that was impossible to ignore. But with a diabetic mother (Type II), being severely obese, and being Native American (high risk), I knew I had to get off the habit. This was about five years ago. So I tested something out. 

I decided to go for **7 days without any sugar.** No honey in my tea, no baked goods, no candies, nothing that had added sugar in it, NO ARTIFICIAL SWEETENER, and not too much fruit. It was pretty difficult. I would get antsy and come as close as having a cookie on my lips, before I would throw it away and walk out of the house in desperation to stick to my goal. I lived in a house that always had unhealthy food around - making it even more difficult. I kept a small bag of raisins around, of which I would allow myself 3-4 once or twice a day to calm my cravings. Then by about the 4th or 5th day, the cravings had subsided. By the 7th day, I decided to go on 3 more days, and went 10 days without any sugar. And it worked! My cravings were so dull, and sugar tasted so much sweeter. That's when I started losing weight again.

After that, sugar tasted sweeter to me. I notice more the effect it has on my mood and energy levels, and too much makes me uncomfortable. When people say ""ooooh this is too sweet"" I ACTUALLY agree with them, instead of pretending to agree with them to not sound like a fatty. I admit, my sweet tooth has reared it's ugly head a few times in the last 5 years. Like around my birthday, or the holidays, when I let myself go or I am surrounded by sweets. Then, I'll just do the process again: 7 days without sugars. And voila!

So at the end of freshman year, I weighed in at 301, with a size 26 pants. I had a bum heart that I'd used as an excuse for years, but after treatment, I had enough. I started walking every day. First three miles, then four, then eventually seven miles a day. I would stroll outside because I was too embarrassed to go to the gym. I also started making little changes in my diet. I didn't try the fad diets or pills or even As-Seen-On-TV equipment because I knew they would be short term, and I wanted a lifestyle change. So first I cut out the soda and juices. Then the bread came next. (I still eat my sandwiches with lettuce instead of bread.) And the rest was a balancing act. 
Walking was good, but after about four months, I wanted to run. Or jog. Slowly. So I would jog for the duration of a song, then walk until I could catch my breath. The weight melted off. I hit a plateau for a couple of months, but then I changed it up. When I got down to about a size 14, I feared the loose skin, so I heard weight training would help with that. I did Body Pump 3x a week (an hour of light weights, lotta reps). And I took up pole dancing. Mixing it up made it a lot of fun, and also helped me tone up and slim down to a 6/8.

Pics or it didn't happen: http://imgur.com/x8T4gCJ

My highest weight was 210 lbs -- and thanks to an adolescence spent comfort eating and indulging in self-pity, I got to that weight at a dangerously young age.

My doctor and parents tried their best to get me to stop gaining weight, but I was a latch-key kid -- I got home before my parents and would sneak food incessantly, even if I couldn't understand why I felt the need to eat when I wasn't hungry.

My turning point came when I was 17. I fell down the basement stairs, fracturing a rib and spraining my ankle. I was home alone at the time and there was no phone in the basement, so I needed to climb the stairs in order to call someone for help. But I couldn't support my weight with just my arms -- I was too heavy. 

For my entire life, I had accepted the fact that I was supposed to be overweight, constantly feeling out of breath and incredibly limited. But I was stuck on that basement floor for almost seven hours; long enough to figure out that this couldn't continue. I couldn't spend my life feeling trapped by my own body. 

My weight loss was slow and steady -- it's taken me almost five years to reach my goal of loosing 90 lbs. My routine has stayed pretty constant:

1. Walking 30 minutes, five times a week. When I was heavier, running was out of the question -- too hard on my knees. And I think that in order to be a runner, you need to have the correct footwear, training schedule and technique in order to avoid injury and I was way too clueless to attempt that at the time. So walking seemed like simple, inexpensive and low-stress cardio. It also gave me time to clear my head.

2. Drink water. I never payed attention to the quantity of water I drank, but I gave up drinking anything besides water (except on special occasions). Liquid calories have always been wasted on me and I noticed that articifically sweetened drinks just made my sweet tooth worse.

3. Eat what you want -- but stop eating when you're full. This was the BIGGEST problem for me; my family loves to eat simply for the sake of eating and I definitely inherited that tendency. But I try to remind myself that nothing is off limits as long as I just have a small amount -- once you get to that point of diminishing returns, try and stop eating or switch to something like fruit or veggies. At the same time, there are certain foods I won't really ever eat (like deep fried oreos or dinner at the Cheesecake factory) because I do think some foods are just insanely bad for you -- my rule is, if I wouldn't feed it to my future child, I probably have no business eating it myself.

And the last piece of advice -- just take it one day at a time. Yes, your body will change and it's very exciting, but this weight loss definitely had other great benefits. It really helped me to figure out who I am, what I want and exactly what I am capable of achieving.

I'm really fortunate to work where I do, for so many reasons, but among them is the culture of fitness the company fosters. It sucks when people bring in candy or donuts, so it was super awesome to see this in the break room this morning.

Also, a couple of NSVs: Went up to 40lb dumbbells yesterday for bicep curls, and completed W1D2 of the C25K we started. I have so far to go but I'm feeling really good about the path I'm on.

If I didn't have you guys to share these sorts of things with, it would be so much harder. I love you, Loseit. I really do. I can't really talk to any other group about piddly little stuff like ""W1D2 down! Yay!"" or similar, and it really helps me to feel the sense of community we have. So often when you share things that are small in the grand scheme of things, but important to you, you're met with a cynical ""Oh nobody cares shut the fuck up,"" especially on the internet. Here in Loseit, we always seem to be positive and encouraging, and we tend to understand that while for many going for a walk around the block is nothing, for someone trying it's a *huge* step in the direction, and we get that and have kind words for them.

I have always had issues with weight, so this is not a new battle lol. I got married back in 2009 and got fat again. I was up to about 275 when i finally was able to turn the tide again. I have had a steady weight lifting routine since 2008, but was doing no cardio (while justifying eating good shit with my lifting lol). I initially started losing weight again by starting a low carb diet (getting into ketosis and monitoring via ketostix) that i was off an on for a year or so. The ketosis helped me drop down to about 255 (plateau) relatively quick. I then picked back up my running routine and start running 3miles about 3 or 4 days a week. Once i got down to 235 (plateau) i added swimming and changed from the ketosis diet to a much more green leafy veggie, fruit, and chicken/fish diet, which let me get down to 225. At 225(plateau) i totally re-evaluated my workouts and started a much more intense routine. Since then i have been doing the following (with some deviations as needed) :

*Mon: 1hr Weight training
*Tues: 1 hr Weight training, 1/2-3/4 mile swim
*Weds: 4-5 mile run
*Thurs: 1hr weight training, 1/2-3/4 mile swim
*Fri:  4-5 mile run
*Sat: nothing really, maybe some dog walks or volleyball at the pool
*Sun: 6-7 mile run

I am hoping to get down into the 190s sometime soon, but i have been fucking around and eating a bunch of crap lately, so i have to get shit locked back in and get back on track. Things that have helped along the way have been: setting realistic short term goals (run a mile longer than the week before on the long run, focus on building up strength to do pull ups, just getting out of bed every day you have something planned), having a good workout buddy (for lifting), have an event to work up to (tough mudder in dec, i need to get my run up to 12miles by then)

EDIT: This is the ""amazing sister"". I was told that I needed to get on here and properly share my story. I always had a weight problem. I love using past tense. I had progressively gotten more and more overweight as I grew up. Granted I have a ways to go, but not nearly as far as this time last year. A year ago, I was miserable. I was morbidly obese. My body could have given out on me at any moment. I was depressed. I lived my life vicariously through others, because I didn't have the energy or strength to do what they were doing. I lied to myself that it wasn't ""that bad"".  I got more stretching done just by trying to tie my shoes. I got winded walking up the 15 steps to leave my house each morning. I ate whatever I wanted, whenever I wanted. I ate to celebrate good things. I ate to comfort myself during the bad times. I wasn't feeding myself, I was feeding my emotions. I spent 8 hours sitting at a desk at work and then came home and sat in front of the TV/computer for another 6 hours before I would go to bed.

I was never able to get control on my weight and it just got progressively out of control the older I got. More weight meant less activities. More weight meant bigger clothes. Bigger clothes meant shopping in the old ladies section. Old ladies section meant Erin was not looking good. Seriously.

I made peace with myself. I made peace that I would never be healthy, never be skinny, and that I just needed to make due with what life had given me. How sad. Being overweight was going to be my challenge. It was what I had to deal with. I would rather be overweight then have x problem or x problem. 

Then 2005 rolled around. I was at the highest weight I had every been, 350 lbs. (who can ever say they're happy at 350lbs). My grandma found a doctor who specialized in Bariatric surgery, specifically the Lap-Band. I talked it over with my parents, went in for a consultation, and because I was un-insured i.e. no red tape, the surgery was done 2 weeks later. It was the best/worst 6 months of my life. I lost 50lbs like that. I had more energy. I was losing weight, despite what I ate. I started going to the gym. But I hadn't made any mental/emotional progress. I found out soon enough that Ben &amp; Jerry's goes through that smaller stomach super nice. And if I wanted to eat more, all it took was another glass of water. Soon enough I had gained back the 50 lbs and an additional 25, just for kicks.

A year ago I had had enough. Something finally clicked. I had to do something, I had to do now, and I had to do it for me. I was just about ready to turn 30 and tipped the scales at 378, the largest I had ever every been. I told myself there was no way I would get to 400. 

I called one of the local gyms and talked to one of the membership people. I told her my story, my struggle with my weight, how I needed to work with someone who would keep me accountable, challenge me, but not kill me. I made an appointment to meet with them 20 minutes later. I walked in, got a tour of the facility, set up my membership and signed up with a personal trainer. 

For the first 9 months I worked out with a trainer twice a week. The other days I would rotate between cardio and strength training. Six days a week (sometimes 7) I would be at the gym for at least 90 minutes. I had to. It made me feel better. It made me happier and gave me more energy. It still does. 

I went in to see my doctor in May. Complete clean bill of health. She took me off my anti depressant medication and was so thrilled for me. I ran my first 5K in May. I volunteered for Spartan Race in June (so I can see what I'm getting myself into when I sign up to run it next year). I was on the injured list for 2 months while dealing with some tendonitis. It stopped me from running, but I was still able to use the elliptical and strength train. 

I now meet with my trainer once every other week (they get expensive, but totally worth it). I've added boot camp and body pump to my training scheduled along with the regular strength training and cardio days. 

I'm still working on my eating habits. I definitely notice the difference my body feels when I'm eating healthier. It kind of goes in shock whenever I over do it on the sugar. If I could still get my sweet tooth under control things would be a lot better! When I'm really doing what I need to do, I track my calories using myfitnesspal.com. I follow their guidelines, but have the percentages set up 50% carbohydrates, 35% protein, and 15% fat. I started at 60%/25%/15% respectively and have adjusted as I have lost weight and gained more control over my eating. It's definitely not perfect, but it's better than the fast food, ice cream, pizza phase I was in for so long.

 This journey has definitely been more than just a physical one. I have grown mentally, emotionally and have overcome more obstacles that I personally had set up for myself. I still have a ways to go, but it's definitely worth it and it's definitely attainable. Thanks for reading my story.

My diet: Learning to eat food

 
Based on my past experiences I knew that this time I couldn't just do a fad diet, I had to change my lifestyle. Months 1-7 I cut out the following, and NEVER cheated:

Sugar, Alcohol, and Fast-Food.

This was my food plan:

Breakfast-Fiber One Cereal or Oatmeal with dried fruit, Skim Milk, Black Coffee

Lunch-Salad (different types each day), or 6"" Subway Club with all veggies and water
Work Snack-Unsalted Trail Mix with dried fruit OR boiled egg OR cheese OR No Butter Popcorn AND Fruit

Dinner-Seasoned and Baked Meat, Cooked Vegetable

Dessert-Fruit OR Skinny Cow Frozen Treat (only if I ran that morning and planned to run the next morning)

If I ate out at restaurants I used it as an opportunity to try a different salad, I'd order water in bars, and I avoided fast food places like the plague.

 
My battle with weight
 

At the age of 15 I weighed in at 200lbs, our family doctor suggested my father and I follow the Atkins Diet and start working out. My dad, a former marine, took his advice and signed us up for a gym in Cleveland, Ohio. My trainer was John Black a known powerlifter who broke records in the 80's, and his gym catered to police officers and fireman looking to bulk up, I was often the only female but the other patrons looked after me as a daughter and the atmosphere was supportive. At 17 I started to eat normally again, I was tired of barely eating because of the restrictions of the Atkins Diet. From the age of 17 to 21 my eating worsened, I stopped working out consistently, and I found myself heavier than ever at the age of 21, weighing in at 220lbs. In 2009 I graduated from graduate school and started full-time work, my poor eating habits continued and I often visited Wendy's drive-thru for lunch. I would start work out routines but they never stuck. I felt helpless and even though I recently graduated with a Master's Degree, I felt unsuccessful in life. Moving to New York City didn't solve my problem, I had to find the solution on my own.  Today I can say that I’ve successfully made a lifestyle change, I choose not to eat certain foods, I work out, and I can confidently say this change will follow me no matter where I go.
 

Now what?
 

In November 2011 I started a blog (nowwhatjessica.wordpress.com) to document my weight loss after people started writing me on Facebook for tips on how to lose weight. I want to continue to work out and eventually tone up my problem areas (arms and stomach).  I also plan to become a Certified Personal Trainer to help others with their fitness goals!

 
The new me…

 
Have others out there had trouble living in their new skin? I was often known as ""the funny fat girl"", I felt more sure of my identity when I was heavier, and I find that many people criticize my healthy eating now.

I felt normal, happy about it, and me. However, my cholesterol was in the 260s, I couldn't climb 3 flights of stairs, and my health was crazy everywhere.

I did one simple thing: **CUT OUT SODAS!** &lt;-- Please, everyone do this.

Sugar started tasting way too sweet very fast, and the rest of my healthy eating habits started to emerge on their own. I had never been able to find a workout that worked for me long term, but I started jumping rope, playing at jungle gyms, and doing yoga when I couldn't fall asleep. Bam, by the end of the summer I was down some 30 lbs and I looked completely different.

I weigh 115 now, and while I'm not entirely sure the weight loss was me (it's still dropping, I stopped working out in... december?), I would never have kicked my bad habits, and I might have died much earlier. 

Unfortunately, due to things that were already occurring before the weight loss, I don't have any friends to share this with. My family was weird, constantly inquiring about drug use, watching my eating/sleeping patterns, and stopping everyone from getting dinner at xmas to announce it (My grandma, maybe worst moment ever, no one commented, just looked at their plates). I'm still very proud of my body and health, and sometimes I run just to feel the power I have now, and boost my spirits. 

I'm working on improving my spirits about the rest of the world, and I'm still sticking to health, despite the fact that I look FREAKING FANTASTIC. It's a bummer that I went from a 38DD to a 32C, but I also went from a size 16 to a size 4, and I finally have the face for the pixie cut I always wanted.

I'm still pretty self-conscious, so created a throw-away to post up.

I'm 6 months into my journey, and I'm 70 pounds down! I started at a pathetic 320 pounds, and am now at 250 (with a lot left to do). I've been doing simple calorie-counting, and started taking Krav Maga classes a couple of times a week (just recently received my Level 1 certification!). I'm also starting to do some jogging once or twice a week, and am amazed to find that it's actually a little fun. 

I decided last night that it was time to stack up the old against the new and get a good visual for myself, and I was blown away by the changes that I hadn't even recognized yet. It motivated me to keep going and get to an even more healthy spot. At the onset of my journey my doctor said that, given my height and frame size, 250 is a healthy weight for me. But now that I've hit that, I can see there are still some areas and improvements that can be made, so will be targeting some specifics going forward.

So, r/loseit, I present to you...[my first ever progress pic!](http://i.imgur.com/ZIs6n.jpg)

I've been taking a picture of my face once a month to see the progress that I've made.  The one I took today at 4 months made me excited, so I decided to show off a little bit.

As far as how I've been losing weight, I haven't been on any particular diet, and I haven't been on a strict workout regiment.  I just cut out the junk and replaced it with reasonable portions of good food.  I also got a FitBit, which tracks your activity level throughout the day.  Compared to the high octane crap and complete lack of activity from before, this method has been successful and not terribly difficult to maintain.  Eating right and maintaining a reasonable activity level has made me feel like a new person.

My goal is to get under 200 lbs, and then put on muscle up to about 210-220.  I know the journey is far from over, but I wanted to share!

One day in summer of 2011, I was ill at the ER and of course, they check the basics- weight, vital signs, etc. I knew I was overweight and unhappy with myself but stepping on the scale worsens those feelings. Well, the nurse called out my weight at the time- ""270 lbs. Is that a loss or a gain?"" I said ""that's very much a gain."" One would think that would be a wake-up call but months later, after Christmas, I decided what I was gonna do with the new year.

Come January 2012, I had my last cheat meal at Hardee's and from there, I started an active and healthy life. Over a year later, I weigh in at 171 lbs. making me nearly 100 lbs. lighter and have never felt better. These results cost me next to nothing, just an investment in a decent pair of running shoes! There was no fad fitness or diets. I relied on random exercise videos such as those by Denise Austin, walked at distances I found to be challenging before eventually moving up to running. As for my diet, I started consuming more water and eating lighter. For now, I have upped on protein and whole grain foods. Soon, I will attempt to start fitness training to get toned and lean.

I've been on a diet for a month and a half now and I've lost 10 kilograms (20 lbs), from my SW of 302 lbs/137 kg (I'm 5""5/173 cm 22F). I think I need to start working out, going to the gym, and that's the plan - I'm signing up for it soon; but frankly, I'm a little terrified.

I've always had people look down on me, often heard mean or insulting remarks at school, etc. Some of it may be my own paranoia/self-loathing, but the remarks surely are not. I wanted to start swimming two years ago, but I've had a group of teenagers point at me and laugh; I never went back again (I wish I hadn't given up so easily). Now, I'm scared how people will react to me and my very overweight body at the gym.

I already went to my local gym to ask around and the receptionist said that they ""do have overweight clients, not every day but often enough"" which means I wouldn't be the only one, probably, but it's a small gym so chances are I would be the biggest one out there. I'm scared of how people will look at me, what they will think and so on. 

For all of you that do work out, and are/have been overweight: what were the reactions like? Any funny looks, comments, anything like that? I don't need encouragement, as I will go anyway, but I want to be prepared for what I'm about to face. Also, what kind of exercise did you start with to build up your stamina? My stamina at the moment really, *really* sucks so I'm scared of making a total fool of myself by completely failing at exercising...

Thank you, my dear friends of /r/loseit, you really keep me encouraged and motivated :) 

**Edit:** WOW. Just wow. Thank you *so* much for the encouragement, I've never expected such a gigantic response. I'm signing up for my gym tomorrow, no second guessing.

EDIT: Sorry I did not read the guidelines before posting this I will get this post up to scratch when I finish work :)

EDIT2: OK sorry guys for not reading the guidelines before posting this, I will go through the last 2 months.

It started at the local pub some drunk angry guy punched me in the face and I was receiving threats from him because he got banned from the pub, he was a big 30something year old rugby player and I was only 19. After going to the local police about the assault and the threats they didn't really do much they said they couldn't get a hold of him (whatever). So i wanted to be able to defend myself if he came at me again and joined the gym. 

I also went down to the local chemist and signed up for tony ferguson weight loss shakes, I was having 100g of protein a day + 2 shakes + unlimited veggies and only drink water and that kick started my diet really well, I lost 11lb in 7 days. I cut all alcohol and caffeine out of my diet I feel this helped the most

I proceeded with the shakes for a few more weeks and added more protein as I was going to the gym a lot doing 45 minutes cardio a day, running and bike sometimes rowing but pretty much just running.

After a few weeks I went down to 1 shake a day and added in wholegrain bread for fiber.
At the moment I'm on about 200g of protein a day and lots veggies and various things I see at the supermarket that give me fiber.

I feel like the most important part of my diet was portion control. After I stopped the shakes ( I still have one now and then when there is nothing else in the house) I didn't really stick to a strict diet I just made sure I ate plenty of veggies and whenever I would eat something ask myself ""Will this be beneficial to my weight loss plan."" If the answer was yes I would eat it, if not I wouldnt. 

Few days ago I have started doing push ups I can only do about 10 a night right now but I'm working to 100. I'm also going to take some form of martial art class soon just trying to find one I like.

In my 20s, ive always been in the 160-170 range but I started gaining weight and went up to 195 in 2010/2011 after learning to enjoy beer and new medication. So I started my adventure in February 2012 after listening to a coworker of mine who is well versed in everything nutrition. I really didn't think I would last more than a week since I'm extremely lazy and get bored with things quickly. 


I used the lose it app in the beginning and my calories were cut down to 1350. I didn't really change anything in my diet, just ate less of it. I definitely didn't do any exercising either but the pounds came off.


At about 6 weeks in, i was stuck in the high 170s. I decided to try the keto diet. For the next 2 months learned a lot about food. I loved it but it was hard to do it alone. I slowly came off of keto and but I still eat less carbs than I did before. 


That was in June and i have been sitting here at 160 for almost 3 months. I wanted to wait until my goal to post my progress pictures but I'm starting back on track and thought this would be a good motivation! 30 more pounds to go :)

But it's just dawned on me that perhaps I have no right to say these jokes anymore. They certainly occur less and less, and I've probably confused people who have only known me since I've lost weight.

I was always athletic in high school. I was a cheerleader, I played softball, and I had weights class year round. After I graduated I thought I could still eat whatever I wanted without gaining weight. The only problem was, I wasn't doing anything to burn off those calories anymore. (I'm sure we all know how well that worked out.)

Anyways, 10 years and 2 kids later, my body is in sad shape and I am ready to take my life back! I've started out slow...counting calories has helped me drop 10 lbs alone. Just last week I decided to start exercising  with walking and running. Well today when I got to the track, there was this older lady absolutely kicking butt and taking names. I got it in my head that I couldn't let her show me up completely, so I just pushed it, and surprise! I made it no problem. I probably could have run further, but I didn't want to push it too far.

I started ""eating healthier"" around the end of April. I'm guessing I was 310+ at that point. After poking around /r/loseit, I found a link to /r/keto and decided to give that a try (start date: May 2). I went home from college about a week into May, finally got my scale on May 11 and officially weighed in at 301.6. Today's weigh-in: 251.2!

I don't really go out of my way to exercise, mainly because I'm too lazy and am still nervous about being the fat guy at the gym :P

I do, however, walk quite a bit (since I'm on a college campus) and I had an internship over the summer where I was on my feet for a large part of the day and consistently registered around 10k steps a day (according to my fitbit). 

For my diet, I stick mainly keto, though I don't limit myself from a dessert or drink here or there and try to stick to around 1500-1600 kcal a day. I've been averaging about .44 lbs/day lost, so I think it's working for me :)

To make a long story short I ended up with a kid on the way by age 17. Two weeks after my 18th birthday I got married, life was hitting me fast and watching my weight didn't seem like a priority at the time. 
Throughout the years I watched my weight change, every 10 pounds I would say that I was going to lose it and then some. It just never ended up happening until I went from being 150 to 210 pounds. I started developing health problems and started drifting into depression.     I wanted to lose the weight for my family, for my wife, and for myself. So I researched into the vegan diet. Now I live it! Its only been 6 months, but I work out daily. I jog 3 miles a day, and hit the gym for an hour. Eat balanced meals, and kicked the soft drinks and beer. I feel full of energy! Get to play with my kids more (yes I have two now). My wife is on the same diet and we both are looking like teenagers again! Here is a pic of me over the last 9 years.

I am **8 LBS** from being a healthy weight for the first time since I was 3!!!! (At ages 4-5, I was already 100 lbs...) I have been morbidly obese nearly my entire life.

[AFTER:  174 lbs...warning, eating candy. :) ](http://i.imgur.com/BbqFE.jpg)





**My Routine:**

No food is off the table, though some I don't keep in the house, as they trigger binges. These are things like chips, candy bars, cookies, peanut butter (but I do use PB2!), nutella, brownies, pastries, cake, etc. I still have them, but always outside the home.


I eat 1800 calories a day most days (not net), do Zumba 3x per week, walk 3 miles or more pretty much every day (how I commute!), and have just started weight training in the past month and a half. 
WEIGHT TRAINING IS AWESOME. OMG, I have muscles! If you are losing weight, male or female, don't be afraid to pump some iron! Plus, it's helping with any loose skin issues.


**TIPS:**

*  Count calories, and be honest. Measure everything you can.

*  Make small changes. I eat tons and tons of veggies, but that didn't happen over night. For me, slowly incorporating healthier habits has made this all a much more sustainable lifestyle change--instead of a quick (and likely temporary) fix.

*  Enjoy life, but know thyself. If going to your favorite cafe means you WILL eat three brownies, maybe consider making coffee at home. If you need an ""appointment"" to go to the gym, consider taking classes like Zumba or spinning. At the same time, remember that one night of wine and sushi and candy (as pictured above) will not ruin you! I still have a cheat day once per month, and maintenance days every week or so.

*  Be your own chef. I eat 90% homemade meals I cook, and I know exactly what goes into them. Like Thai? Pick up some red curry paste, veggies, and coconut milk and look up some recipes online. Eating healthy doesn't mean eating bland foods, by any means. Food is nourishing--it can be tasty, too! (r/fitmeals is a great resource)

*  Protein is very filling.

*  Whole grains over white. 

*  Veggies in ALL the things!  Also, I'm currently addicted to apples.  I love eating one in the afternoon before hitting the gym.

*  Find replacements that work for you. PB2 is very tasty, and I don't binge on it, whereas I do with peanut butter. Deep Chocolate Vitamuffins provide a great chocolate fix, and are actually filling (egg whites and whole grains!). I also use Stevia, which may not be for all, but has been a great help to me.

*  Avoid drinking calories as much as you can. If drinking alcohol, avoid sugary mixed drinks. Making your own mojitos, however, can be a very low calorie endeavor with some mint and rum and limes and stevia. :)

*  Don't be afraid of lifting weights--especially if you're a girl. You're not going to turn into the Hulk. You will, however, get awesome leg muscles and be able to carry heavy things like they're nothing. :)

*  Had a bad day?  Don't beat yourself up!  Just log the calories and don't use it as an excuse to binge tomorrow.

*  Don't feel it's impossible.  I used to have NO ENERGY to go to the gym.  It's sort of a catch 22 that losing weight and working out gives me more energy!  Even 60 lbs ago, I was exhausted at 5pm, and just wanted a glass of wine after work.  Now, I look forward to my 5:30 Zumba class. :)


And for anyone who is wondering, I went from a size 24 (pushing 26) to a size 8 up top, and 12 on bottom (12s are getting a bit loose, though.)

1347895617.0,389,self.loseit,100xo6,To the obese lurkers out there who want to do it but you just can't seem to start. (Warning: This is a long post),479,90,97,http://www.reddit.com/r/loseit/comments/100xo6/to_the_obese_lurkers_out_there_who_want_to_do_it/,"I hope this doesn't turn into a jumbled ramble where my point gets lost but I wanted to get this out there and hope it reached someone.  The message I hope to get through boils down to this:  Even if you are obese you can do it, and it's hard and it's completely worth it, so stop waiting for something to get you going.

My story is pretty typical, and far from done.  I was a chubby kid, but heavy into sports so never really more than chubby.  In college the sports went by the way side, school took up my time and my eating habits got not better.  As life went on I got bigger and bigger topping out at 371lbs.  About 5 years ago I started to lose the weight and in the next 1 1/2 year I lost 150lbs.  Then life got complicated and I let back in old habits and put all the weight, and possibly more, back on in 1 1/2 years.  So last October I decided it was time to do it again and do it permanently.

I just remember, for years and years, thinking to myself, how low I felt about my weight, how much I liked myself and my life but hated how I looked. I have stood in the mirror looking at myself with utter disgust; I have avoided swimming, playing and enjoying my life with kids because I was too embarrassed to do it, or just couldn't keep up.  I've cried in the shower because of my weight, and even though I would never have done it I even fantasized about how if I was in an accident or stabbed I could ask them to take the fat out and it would give me a head start on the weight loss.

That's all I needed right, a head start.  Something to make the initial steps easy, so that I was just maintaining the weight, I could do that right?  In reality, I couldn't have.  I would just put it back on because of the way I looked at eating and food.    I think about myself and I think I was waiting for a wakeup call, something to let me know how far I had fallen.  The Ironic thing about losing weight and gaining weight is your mind tricks you.  As my weight crept up and up I could look at myself in the mirror and think, I'm no worse than I was 10lbs ago, 30lbs ago, 50lbs ago.  Sure I hated my own reflection, but as I got bigger and bigger I didn't hate it any more than I was used to.  Excuses upon excuse and lying to myself about just how big I was and how I actually looked.  I would lie to myself all the time to justify my size but now that I'm about 1/2 way done my weight loss I sometimes have days (like the last week or so) where I feel HUGE!  I swear I feel like I look the same as I did when I was 371+, but to do a side by side it's like night and day.   I’ve come to realise that I think I was waiting for a heart attack.  That would be serious enough to wake me up and realise I needed to do something.  Right?  I mean I couldn’t make excuses for myself after having a heart attack..could I?  I would have survived a heart attack, dying from it, that couldn’t happen to me...could it?

One of the things about losing weight, something no one ever told me and that even after the fact I never really thought about.  It doesn’t need to start with a bang, or a monumental life changing event.  There doesn’t have to be a single moment in your life that makes you go ‘My god, I need to change now!’.  It can start with a walk.  It can start with learning about food and proper weight loss.  It continues when you choose to walk again, and teach yourself what a proper portion size is.  When you take a few minutes to look at what you are actually putting in your body.  There probably isn’t going to be a thunderous moment when you realise your life has changed, but eventually you’ll look back and see all the small changes that have made things so different for you now.
If you are waiting, struggling, contemplating and wondering how to lose weight, if you are obese and you desire to be more of you in less of you, if you’ve lurked on /r/loseit and wondered how these people have done it, how you wish you could be one of those people, how you wish you had the willpower to do it, and wondered what sort of drastic, inspirational thing happened to them that could happened to you; well then it’s time to start.
Start reading and learning about eating properly, go for a walk, and start.  Just start, now.  Not tomorrow, not next week because someone is having a birthday on Friday, or because you need to get new groceries.  It’s time to dive into it.
My life is considerably better already, and I’m only ½ way there.  Technically I’m still obese but I can jog for ½ hour, swim for an hour, I went to a water park with my kids and went down the slides with them.  I have muscles.
It’s hard, it’s going to be a life long struggle, I’ve stumbled and you will to, but keep going .  It is hard and it’s so completely and utterly worth it.  It really, truly is.

Initial goal complete.",484,89,80,http://www.reddit.com/r/loseit/comments/teouc/what_a_difference_a_year_makes_19m_90lbs_dropped/,"12 Months ago today I made a decision that was going to change my life, here's my story.



**About me:**
I was overweight all through school and never really tried or had thought about losing weight.
I was the token fat guy in class and honestly didn’t mind. 




[Here is me at 16 2008](http://i.imgur.com/cNsfB.jpg)



Slowly I crept away from friends and lost motivation to do anything but play video games all day every day. 




[This was me at the end of 2010](http://imgur.com/WeUbn.jpg)



Just hit 18 and instead of partying/socializing, I was raiding in two hardcore WoW guilds 5 days a week. It’s all I was good at, I couldn’t do sports without getting chest pains and had zero motivation to lose weight.



I started having pretty bad health problems, my knees weren’t supporting my weight and I was going to the doctors every other week for different reasons, chest and back pains, headaches ect.
Even after the hints from my doctor to lose weight, I never listened and continued the way I was.



My sister finally gave me that motivation I needed to start. She went on a diet 8 months before me, watching her lose weight while I stayed fat was getting to me. Going out and watching everyone she knows comment on how well she was doing, and me standing by, still obese, just thinking ""one day I wish somebody would say that to me”. It finally gave me the motivation to start. (she ended up losing 55lbs)




[Here is me at my peak of 230lbs, one year ago](http://imgur.com/xfAkA.jpg)



I woke up that day, again with chest pains and thought.. screw it,  time to change.




**My progress.**



**April 2011**: 230 - 200lbs    40 - 35.4 waist



Didn’t do any exercise in the first month, focused on cutting out the fatty foods and the coke. Got rid of the deep fryer and replaced it with a George Foreman grill. Honestly a god send, watching how much fat drips out of the food you used to eat 3 or 4 times a week was eye opening, best $40 I've spent. 




**May/June 2011**: 200 - 180lbs   35.4  - 33.7 waist



Still watching my diet I started cardio, first few weeks I struggled but eventually I got into it, I was dropping the weight, moving away from the computer games and started socializing. I bought an exercise bike and set it up in front of the computer. It’s amazing how many miles you can do while watching a movie without realizing, even a slow pedal I was doing 2 - 3 miles during a 20 minute show.




**July 2011**: 180 - 170lbs    33.7 - 33



July was my favorite month during my journey, It was the first time someone outside of the family commented on my weight loss. It was also the month I decided to get rid of my long hair that I had grown for nearly 8 years.




[Photo of me before and after the hair cut](http://i.imgur.com/gvzE1.jpg)



Starting to get to the point where I enjoyed exercising more than playing the computer and knew I had finally hit that stride I needed.



I fell in love with salad/veggies and had completely moved away from fast food. I ate as much steak/chicken as a could. I could no longer eat fish though, I loved fish all my life but couldn't stomach it anymore, gave me horrid chest pains and I had to stop eating it. I can still take fish oil tablets though so anyone know whats up?



**August - November**: 170 - 140lbs    33 - 29.3



I finally hit my goal weight of 150lbs in October.




[Me on my birthday/goal weight complete](http://i.imgur.com/bJ5ZZ.jpg)




Here is where I went wrong, during my weight loss I didn’t do heavy lifting during my workouts. It was 100% cardio, after I hit my goal weight I kept losing weight, by the end of November I was 140 and started having people tell me I was too skinny.



In 8 Months I went from people telling me I was overweight to telling me I was too skinny.  So I set a new goal weight of 165.




[Christmas back to 150](http://i.imgur.com/WoffF.jpg)



[Feb up to 154](http://i.imgur.com/mKndx.jpg)



[Last month, two tattoos finished, my new addiction](http://i.imgur.com/zTkp5.jpg)



[Me now sitting at 158](http://imgur.com/a/xyZEJ)




I’m still doing my heavy workouts 5/7 days week and on a good protein diet slowly bulking up. I still play computer games but only casually and my life no longer revolves around them.



In the past year I’ve only been to the gym once, all my exercise has been done at home. Skipping rope/exercise mat/exercise bike/2 10lbs dumbbells and a few cheap exercise machines is what I ended up buying during the loss. ~$200 on equipment. (live too far away from the gym so did it at home) When I wanted to bulk up I invested into a good weight set for ~$120 or so.




My only regrets are I didn’t take enough before photos, I always hid from the camera as I was always embarrassed. I didn’t tell anyone but my sister/parents about my diet at the start , I thought I was bound to fail and didn’t want the embarrassment.



Also regret not lifting during the weight loss, it’s been a lot harder for me to put on the last 18 pounds than it has been losing the 90. If you plan on losing weight, lift!




Sites I used for inspiration:
http://www.bodybuilding.com/guides/     



Awesome free plans, heaps of guides on exercises/diets and eventually bought supplements from them.




http://www.youtube.com/user/sixpackshortcuts  



When I started off exercising I had no idea where to start or how, watched all of his videos and improvised on what I needed to do.




and of course http://www.reddit.com/r/loseit/



My sister gave me the initial motivation to start. But you guys, you magnificent bastards kept me going. I found loseit a month after starting. All the progress pics, the stories, the tips! You guys are the best inspiration, thank you for helping me change my life and hopefully I’ve given you a bit of motivation.  



I’ve gone from a neck-beard wow nerd with no self esteem to enjoying exercise, enjoying the company of others and most of all enjoying my life.



Thanks for your time r/loseit, my next journey starts over at r/fitness =) &lt;3

Hi! I am a Special Education Teacher in Arkansas. In late May 2011, I was at the doctor's office and weighed in at 300 pounds. My highest weight EVER! I have struggled with my weight since puberty! Seeing that number on the scale caused something to snap inside and I thought - ENOUGH! 

I started to change my life in June 2011. I joined a gym. It was slow going at first. I really could physically do no more than three days a week for 30 minutes. I started out just going to the gym three days a week for 30 minutes on the treadmill or elliptical. Gradually, I got stronger and increased my endurance levels. I was really strict about my caloric intake and recorded my meals in a journal.

I hit my goal weight of 145 pounds in November of 2012. I am currently 135 pounds. I am not looking to necessarily lose anymore, but I would really like to get my body contoured. It’s not as bad as it could be but I do have some excess skin on my stomach and thighs. My poor boobs have gone from a DD to a B so I’d really like to get that fixed too! It’s just a matter of saving money. Teachers in Arkansas aren’t that highly paid.

I started getting into jogging in June 2012 and presently I have done twelve 5Ks and two Half-marathons.  I started trying to work up to a 5K that summer of 2012. Jogging my first mile was a killer and took about a month to work up to it. Then the rest came pretty easily in the scheme of things.

I completely changed my eating habits August 2012. I measure everything and really try to get the most for my calories.

Well, that’s my story for the last two years! Exercise and healthy eating has made me into a new woman! If I can do it anyone can!

This is the first time I've been under 190 in EIGHT EFFING YEARS! Two months ago I was at 216. When I jumped on this site last week I was 196. Today I am at 189. I just want to celebrate the hell out of this small victory. While my clothes don't seem to fit that much differently, my jewelry certainly does. I have a claddagh ring my grandmother gave me which slips right off now. I look forward to being able to wear my mothers jewelry soon! 

*Edited to include diet and exercise:
I walk an hour every night. On the weekends I started being more active with my kids, I have a zoo membership and I have taken them there and trek them all over the place. I know I am definitely burning the calories carrying my two year old around! I also started some light lifting and sporadic aerobics (and by aerobics I dance like a crazy woman around the house with my kids). I realized how lazy I had become as a parent and I don't want to teach my kids my bad habits so instead of staying inside and watching movies with the kids all the time I go out and run amuck.

As for the diet, that's a bit tougher. To be honest I have just ended a very turbulent relationship with someone I loved very dearly. Ending the relationship wasn't exactly my idea. So, needless to say I have had no desire to eat. I have been forcing my self to eat, but my portions sizes are dramatically smaller. I decided not to ""drink my calories"" anymore and just drink water, black coffee, or green tea (the kind you make with tea bags, calorie free). I started actually eating breakfast, usually just a little vanilla yogurt and I put some fresh berries in it. Lunch is usually a tuna sandwich, salad, or cup-o-noodles. For dinner I usually try to stick to a protein and veggie. Chicken and steamed broccoli are my favorites. But I do a lot of whole grain pasta stuff too. I love noodles, but to try to get away from carbs I get the whole grain stuff. I do cheat on occasion, but I no longer feel guilty about it or shun myself for it. I just move on and continue doing what I need to do.

It was probably one of the worst, most unexpected and awful arguments in my life. She basically said all the things she's been keeping inside as long as she's known me. Awful. Anyways, usually shit like this sends me into an ice cream abyss like nothing else. But not yesterday. I decided that my response to the situation would be to live well and use the anger to fuel my mission to hotness. Lol. I came home, cried, of course, then measured out one cup of ice cream and that was it. No self pity or hate eating. I'm such an emotional eater and for the first time in a long time my emotions didn't ruin my diet. Yay for me!! 

Edit: I was NOT alone with her! She, I, my husband and his younger sister had gone shopping to buy his sister some awesome Eid presents (my idea, no less!!) and she started the fight in the car on the way home!! So déclassé!!

PS:  you all are amazing. Thank you for the support. The reason this thing is an issue for her is because in our cultures (Indian &amp; Pakistani) the wife changes her middle name to her husbands first name and then takes his last name.

Never been one to join in on the conversation that goes on around Reddit, but I figured I'd make a contribution to /r/loseit. 

I started the semester at ~212, but was 217 at my heaviest (over winter break). When I got back to school, I decided to cut the crap out of my diet, watch what I ate and establish a regular schedule for going to the gym. At first, I did a mixture of weights and cardio and found some pretty great success in that. I tend to stick to a low-carb diet. I dropped below 200lbs for the first time since high school sometime in early March. Lately, I've been focusing a lot on cardio, but once I hit my goal weight (~175), I'll begin lifting again.

Here's the last two and a half months by the statistics:

* Height: 6'1""

* Weight: 217lbs ---&gt; 188 lbs

* Pant size: 36-38in. in the waist ---&gt; 33in. in the waist.

* Shirt size: XL ---&gt; L 

I started off wearing a 36x34 in jeans and now wear a 33x34, which is starting to get noticeably looser (also, first time in recent memory that my legs have been longer than my waist measures around)!

A few things that I found helpful:

* Buy a water bottle! I have a 1L Nalgene bottle with me at all times. I try to drink at least 3-4L of water/day. It'll keep you feeling fuller.

* Cut soda and sweet tea out. I didn't have much of a problem with this before, but I make an effort to drink water, milk, or hot (unsweet) tea with every meal.

* Count calories, especially if you're just starting out. I don't write down what I eat anymore because I've gained a general understanding of how much/what I should eat during a given meal. However, at the beginning, I used MyFitnessPal to count calories and be certain that I was at a deficit.

* Don't ""eat back"" calories. Just because the treadmill told you that you just burned 300 calories doesn't mean that you should eat those back throughout the day. In fact, you're likely to eat more than you burned due to the inaccuracies of those machines. Set a calorie intake goal and stick to your guns.

* Sweets are a treat, not something to be consumed after every meal. Personally, I cut out all sweets for 40 days in observance of lent. I found that by the end, not only did I feel more energized, but I didn't really have the cravings for sweets anymore. You grow the appetites you feed and starve the ones you ignore. 

* Find a workout buddy. Running/lifting alone is (for me, at least) a bummer. Most people I talk to find that having someone to work out with keeps them motivated, consistent, and focused on the goal.

That's pretty much it. No special supplements. No magazine-heralded ""lose 8 pounds in 3 days!"" plans. No fad diets or fasting or purges. Just smart choices, consistency in working out, and support from my awesome friends!

It's really great seeing everyone else's progress pictures and success stories so I decided to post my own.

Here is the album of my progress: http://imgur.com/a/U9VXS

I've been overweight for most of my life, and was obese for most of grade school and college. I hit my highest weight in high school at 250lbs, but lost about 30lbs after starting college. I lost about 20lbs. in the last couple years through some digestive problems (had to part with my gallbladder..), and through becoming more active in the summer and fall of last year. I went through a difficult time in August/September and ended up losing another 25-30lbs within a couple months. Since then, I've joined a gym and been very conscious of the calories of food and what I eat. I've given up soda and diet soda (phenylalanine does not agree with my stomach for some reason), and I've stopped eating fast food entirely. I do cardio and weight machines at the gym, although the cardio is a struggle some days. 

For me, losing weight has been an mental journey for me. I wasn't aware of what I was doing to my body and I was eating excessively to comfort myself. I can't say I've had a happy weight loss journey either. The bouts of weight loss I experienced before were always precipitated by some emotional turmoil or negative event. My parents got divorced and I started going to a big university when I lost the first 30lbs, and the last 30 or so this past fall came off after my closest friend at the time lied to and tried to use me in some convoluted threesome with her on-the-side friend-with-benefits. It's not that I felt particularly victimized or anything after these events, or anything like that. They really just hurt my self-esteem and made my opinion of myself even lower.

I've been trying to get away from that mindset though, despite it being a constant, 24/7 battle. I've been going to the gym a lot more, and I do enjoy the post-workout mental resolution. And reading all the stories on here helps me feel less alone. Knowing that so many of you have had similar or worse struggles, and have persevered, helps me keep some perspective.

Now I am ready to kick start/ restart my weight loss journey.

A little bit of background: My daughter was born in May 2011. Before her, I had always been within a ""normal"" weight range, and I had never even really considered watching what I eat. I've been a runner since I was 11 years old, so I didn't watch my diet much -- if I gained a bit of weight, I just ran more. I was never *super skinny* either, but weight certainly wasn't on my mind. But when I was pregnant with my daughter, I gained a TON of weight. The combination of stopping running during pregnancy, plus eating more, caused me to be left in the ""obese"" category for my height after her birth. After 9 months of attempting to lose weight without watching my diet, I stumbled upon /r/loseit, and I came to learn that diet was more important than exercise when it came to weight loss!

So I got really strict about a 1200-net calorie diet, and I started to see results immediately. I still ate ""back"" my exercise calories, which some people don't recommend, but I found that on days when I went for a run, I preferred to keep my energy up by taking in more calories. I didn't pay much attention to carbs, etc... I ate what I wanted, just in moderation and tried to eliminate really ""bad"" foods like fast food and candy. In approximately 4 months of just counting calories and with the help of /r/loseit, I lost 30 lbs. I was still 10 lbs over my goal weight, and then I got pregnant again!

I decided that I would take a ""break"" from my diet while pregnant again. I knew I would see some amount of setback, but I was prepared for that. Despite this, I tried to make healthier choices while pregnant while still giving in to cravings occasionally.

My son was born on 3/28 and weighed 8 lbs 3 oz, so I lost nearly 10 lbs in the birthing process. But I am currently back to where I was after giving birth to my daughter. The difference is I now know where my journey will take me -- back to counting calories and, as soon as I get the free and clear from the doctor, back to running!

This isn't so much a ""hey I'm starting"" announcement as it is a ""hey, I'm back in the game and excited about it!"" announcement. I have done it before and I know I can do it again. My goal is to lose approximately 50 lbs, although I only have to lose about 40 to be within a ""normal"" weight range.

Hi Loseit.  I started my weight loss process almost three years ago.  Since I have kept the weight off for almost two years, I'm considering myself successful enough to make a post about it.  

I hope this post helps somebody else.  My weight loss and lifestyle changes really helped to bring me out of a negative time in my life, and made me realize that nothing tastes as good as being healthier feels.

The most important thing I learned about weight loss?  The process to lose weight is not unique in most people, but the motivation is, and must be unlocked.  

I was 26 years old, teaching full time, brand new baby, and new house.  I was on a strict diet of everything in excess.  I like to eat a lot at a time, and love sweets of all kind.  I also worked the majority of the waking day to ensure that my program was successful.  I saw fast food and the wrong foods as the only option with my busy schedule.  And that is how I became over 250lbs.  

My motivation came from a few places:


   * I was 26 years old, and I could barely play with my daughter without getting winded.  I wanted to be that young dad that could chase his kids around the yard.
   * I was at a size 38 pant, and they were getting stretched.  My shirt size was XXL, and I was only comfortable as long as I was completely covered in multiple layers of dark clothing.  I wanted to be a guy that could wear whatever he wanted.
   * I started shopping for vitamins and personal care products on a health site.  I wanted to share this with people, but no one took me seriously, as I was not the image of what I was sharing.  I wanted to walk the walk.
   * A custodian at my school came to me on a Monday, and reminded me that kids weren't supposed to be eating in my classroom.  I told her they weren't.  She told me that she found McDonald's bags in the garbaged can.  I told her they were mine from today.  She laughed, and said that there was no way possible that all of those bags came from one person.  I then lied, and said I would talk to the kids about it.  
   * I hated how I looked, and wouldn't even look in the mirror in the morning.  I wanted this feeling to go away.


I started a few days before my 27th birthday.  My process came from a variety of sources, including some that are popular and some that are not so popular.  My sources worked for me.  If you disagree with them, that's fine, but here's some tough love.  I was reading an article written by financial expert Dave Ramsey on reducing debt.  Dave's strategy is to snowball debt by paying off the lowest balance first, and then then using the monthly payment from the paid off bill to add to the monthly payment of the second highest bill, and so on.  I remember Dave's quote going something like this: ""Now you might be thinking that the better way to go about this is to pay off the highest interest loan first in order to save money.  And I'll say this - if you were so good with numbers, you wouldn't be reading my article.""   Not trying to be a jerk, but that hit home.

Feeling like I had no motivation and no place to get help with my problem, I did my daily routine of working, and then browsing some sites until bed.  I found a post on either Lifehacker.com or gizmodo.com about the Slow Carb Diet by Tim Ferriss (I know Ferriss is kind of a polarizing figure - just stay with me for a bit).  

I read the article, and decided that I would try this out, as it would be better than the nothing that I was currently doing.  However, I decided to only take parts of it.  In short, I did a lower carb diet with a cheat day that turned into a low carb diet with cheat meals on a cheat day.  I have always been able to lose 10-15 lbs on a low carb diet, but didn't have the discipline to stick with it.  I felt that a planned ""cheat day"" would help.  I also ate high fat to feel full longer.  I'm sure it's been said to death, but eating fat doesn't make you fat.  And my cholesterol numbers improved, so that worked in my favor as well.

I also felt that I had four options:


  1. Do nothing, get no results.
  2. Eat better, and get some results.
  3. Exercise, and get some results.
  4. Eat better, and exercise, and get great results.

I choice option two.  I realized that eating better is a huge change, and exercise is also a huge change.  I was only prepared to take on one, and eating was something I'd have to do every day anyhow.

In more detail, here is how I started:

Phase 1:


   * Starting weight of 250 lbs.  I downloaded the Loseit App (I love how it gave me badges/""achievements"" like it was a game).  Logged everything I ate.
   * Tuesday-Sunday I ate 100 grams of carbs or less.  I didn't count calories, sodium, fiber, anything.  Just carbs.  This allowed me certain fast food items.  Every morning I had a Big and Toasty sandwich from Dunkin' Donuts, or I had a couple of servings of some cereal.  Tried to eat within an hour of waking.  
   * Switched to drinking only water, coffee, and diet soda.  *Note - the diet soda eventually went out of hand.  16 Diet cokes in one day?  Not so good for you or anyone.  Eventually dropped soda in all forms.
   * Monday was my ""cheat day.""  I picked Monday because I felt it was my most stressful.  I eventually moved to Wednesdays (my longest day) and finally settled on Saturdays due to social allowances. 

Under 100 carbs a day helped me to lose 25lbs with visible results in about two months.  I was feeling better, dropped a pant size, and my face was thinner looking based on reactions from others.  I felt that this process was working, so I decided to enter into the next phase.

Phase 2:


   * Current weight was 225lbs.  I kept going with Loseit.  Had my 25lb badge, and internet strangers giving my virtual high fives.
   * Sunday-Friday I ate 70 carbs or less.  Still didn't count anything else.  This still allowed plenty of wiggle room, but I had to make sure that I was a little stricter with making sure that food items stayed within my count.
   * Cheat days were Saturday.  In this phase, I noticed I wasn't looking forward to them as much.  I even tried to skip them, but would ultimately end up cheating on a Monday or Tuesday.  I'd get right back on track, though, and wouldn't allow another one until six consecutive days passed.

Under 70 carbs a day helped me to lose 20 pounds in almost two months.  Sitting at 205lbs, I had a huge surge of energy, drive and motivation to get rid of the 2 in front of my number.  This leads to…

Phase 3


   * Current weight was 205.  Loseit was still very helpful with logging food.
   * I switched to 50 carbs or less every day, but often would stay around 30-40.  
   * Completely took soda of all forms out of my diet.  I only drank coffee, green tea, or water.  I peed every 20 minutes, but learned the pattern of the tiles behind the urinal perfectly.
   * Cheat days continued, but I started getting headaches from the insane amount of sugar intake on them.  A coke would actually give me a huge surge in energy, as opposed to 250lb me getting no effect from it.  Sunday mornings did not feel good, and I had no desire to see junk food after a cheat day.

Under 50 carbs a day: pant size was now a 34 if I sucked it in really well.  Weight was sitting at 190.  My goal was 180lbs (my high school weight).  I felt so good now, but I had to reach that goal.  

Phase 4


   * current weight was 190.  I still used Loseit, but started fooling around with MyFitnessPal.  I really enjoyed the scanning input of foods.
   * I reduced carb intake to less than 35 carbs a day.  I could still do a sandwich if I wanted to, or even some small junk food.  Unfortunately, junk food often sends me into a whirlwind of eating everything in sight, so I tried to avoid it all together.  
   * Cheat days continued, but in varied forms.  I love to eat a lot at once - I started having just one or two larger cheat meals on a cheat day, taking in around 2, 3, 400 carbs.  Felt terrible after them.  Still kept on track.


Under 35 carbs a day: I could squeeze into a 32 (my high school pant size).  Finally got down to my first goal of 180 within a month and a half.  This was the hardest phase so far, but I started to really love how I looked and presented myself.  It was completely worth it at this point (and before).

I kept going at it, staying around 30-40 carbs a day, and made it to my second goal of 170.  My lowest was 165, but I had exercise slightly to get there (I took hour long walks every day…nothing too major).  I now currently sit at 170-175, and try to stay here.  My danger weight is 180, and I avoid ever going above that.  Certain brands I can fit into a 30 pant size (down from 38), and my average shirt size is medium, although some smalls fit me.  

If you've made it through the novel above, keep going - here are some thoughts, reflections and suggestions on how I made it work.



   * Persistence, insistence, and consistence will help success.
   * Work for small changes.  Losing even one pound is worth it, and should be taken as a big deal.  Everyone can do it, but not everyone does.  
   * My work schedule was still hectic for a while, as I took over a new program.  I tried to cook a lot, but also kept a list of approved fast food items.  All burgers, no bun.  Jimmy John's Unwiches (get a card; after you purchase so many, you get one free).  Wendy's chicken salads were a staple of mine, and Culver's burgers, with cheese, no bun, extra mayo.  I want one now.  At home, all meats, all vegetables, cheese (stayed away from milk).
   * We all know how to lose weight.  Most of us are not more special or unique in that science and body chemistry does not apply to us.  
   * Log ALL food.
   * Buy a Brita Bottle or Brita pitcher.  Never pass up a bathroom.
   * Don't tell people you're losing weight.  Just don't do it.  Trust me.  
   * Don't tell people how you're trying to lose weight unless you want puzzled looks, unwanted advice, and frustration.
   * Don't use special events as an excuse to eat junk.  I skipped cake on my birthday, and waited until my cheat day.  My brother used to be on a diet called the ""S Diet.""  It was no Sweets or Seconds except on Special occasions or days of the week that start with S.  The problem?  You can make a special event out of anything.  ANYTHING.  Monday?  Bob's birthday.  Gotta have cake.  Tuesday?  mom and dad are in town.  Let's go out.  Wednesday?  kid in my class brought me cupcakes they baked.  Can't let them go to waste.  Thursday?  Faculty is going out.  Bob bought appetizers.  Friday?  National Holiday in some other country.  Better celebrate.  (I'm not even trying to be funny about this - some of you know how we can make our selves think that we need to participate in these ""special events"" with food.)
   * Scales are not an enemy, but make sure that you are measuring progress in at least two ways.  For me, I used scales, measuring arms, legs, waist, etc.
   * Eating healthier or real food might seem like it costs more money, but imagine how much you'll be saving on medical bills.
   * Water, tea, or coffee.  Get rid of the soda ASAP.  I also stayed away from juice, except for V8.
   * I associated the word ""snack"" with pre-school or elementary school, and avoided eating them as a practice of discipline.  I ate when I was hungry, but also realized that as an adult, I should have the willpower or discipline to hold off on eating if I was a little ""uncomfortable.""  This took a bit to get used to.  If you do what I did, it's ok to eat larger meals as long as you are staying within your counts.  
   * Too much fiber is a bad thing.  Trust me on this one as well.
   * Stare at yourself in the mirror, and get to know every single centimeter of yourself so you can compare changes.  On days that I felt I didn't have much progress, it was nice to see that a hip bone was starting to present itself slightly.  
   * Don't expect an athletic body without doing some work, but expect some weight loss if you are just focusing on diet.  

For anyone doubting that they can do it, please know that you can.  Although my story is probably not the most successful story on here, it's important to me, and I want all of you to have your own positive story.  Let me know how I can help.

TL;DR - I found my bones.

First picture is a costume party, so don't mind the silly get-up. The second picture was taken yesterday.

I had always been a chubby/overweight girl. I was never terribly happy about it, but I was still comfortable with myself. I started lurking on /r/loseit and after some reading decided that I could do this. My highest weight ever was 180lb. I usually stayed around 170-175lb. My previous adult low was about 150-155lb right before college.

**FOOD**: One particular ""tip"" that actually made me do this was actually a comment someone made here on /r/loseit which was to plan out calories for the day. I had tried calorie counting before, but recording after-the-fact made it too difficult to control my eating because I didn't know how many calories were in something until I had already eaten it. I didn't care about macros or anything except the calories. I had always eaten fairly well (lots of veggies and homecooking, not much fast-food or chips, etc.) but I always ate too much and too often (often out of boredom). Planning helped me mentally control my intake and it was surprisingly easy for me.

I started calorie-counting at the end of April 2011 using Fat Secret. I will be the first to admit that I'm not a huge fan of its interface but by the time I had figured that out I was used to it, plus it had all of my previous data that I didn't want to lose by switching. I originally started out with a 1500 limit. Pretty early on I tried to keep it closer to 1200 and usually averaged 1200-1350/day, according to my monthly history. It really wasn't difficult once I got in the habit of planning everything I was eating.

**EXERCISE**: In May I started the Couch to 5k program and made it through by June. I kept with the running through mid-July before I stopped. I just didn't find it fun. In early September I got a bike and started riding to/from work (~5 miles) 3-4 times a week. I stopped in October when the rainy season hit. In December I started group fitness classes and have been doing that ever since. It started out with just Zumba 2-4 times a week, then in mid-January I started BodyPump 1-2 times a week (upped it to 2-3 times a week about 3 weeks ago). Every so often I take some different classes here-and-there (cycling, step, etc.) but Zumba and BodyPump are the only two I've been consistent about.

**WEIGHT LOSS**: My weight loss was remarkably consistent. I recorded daily using the Hacker's Diet tracking program. For 175-&gt;145 I was losing a consistent 5lb/month. It slowed down for 145-&gt;135, and 135-&gt;125 took from November to February. It was NOT affected by exercise, surprisingly enough. The slope of the line doesn't change for the months I didn't exercise, it was all diet. My initial goal was 135lb but the closer I got to it the more I realized that I wouldn't be satisfied with that, which is when I changed my goal to 125lb. I'm not 100% satisfied yet but I'm changing my focus more toward fitness goals and body re-composition than strict weight-loss. Because I focused mostly on diet I did end up skinny-fat.

**FOR THE LADIES**: I changed my birth control from NuvaRing to Mirena (IUD) in June 2011. I did not notice a change in weight-loss. Also, through my weightloss I did lose some boobage. I went from a 36-DD/DDD to a 32-D/DD. My boobs had increased a bit with Nuvaring so I don't know if it was just the weightloss or also switching BC that made my boobs shrink. It's a bit sad because they don't just look smaller; they also look more deflated:( It's totally worth it, though. I promise.

There were some bumps along the way but overall I found that losing weight doesn't have to be difficult. In fact I'm much more worried about moving over to fitness because I already know how to lose weight, but now I have to learn something completely new!",,False,,t5_2rz8w,True,,50lbs,True,t3_q8t3v,http://www.reddit.com/r/loseit/comments/q8t3v/lost_50_pounds_23f56175lb125lb/,

I won't say after because I haven't quite gotten down to where I'd like to be.  

Weight loss started with portion control and teaching myself how to recognize when I was actually hungry and when I was sufficiently full.  I then slowly started to incorporate exercise like walking, jogging, yoga and pilates.  

In August 2012 I joined a CrossFit box and showed up for classes sporadically, maybe two or three times a week and then take a week or two off due to work or being lazy.  At that point I was still eating whatever I wanted and just trying to watch portion size.  I didn't really make it in for a class at all in November and December due to traveling, the holidays, family functions, and work.  

I decided in January to make a real commitment to my health and well being and began a paleo diet and consistent training 6 times a week.  

I'm far from perfect on the diet but I'm still seeing great results.  My end goal is to get my body fat % back into the normal range and to just generally be fit and able to do any fun physical activity that may pop up.

So what I've been doing? Honestly, mostly calorie counting. I naturally reduced my carb intake over time and I haven't eaten bread on months now, but most of it is pure, basic calorie counting. I'm nowhere near keto, I'm not even low carb, I'm just lower carb than I used to be.

As for how many calories, I started out at 2200 for a week or so, dropped it to 2000 and then to 1800 soon after. After a while, I further dropped it to 1600 and that's my upper limit now. Practically speaking, I usually hang around 1400 these days, mostly because I don't have the appetite for more.

During the warmer days, I also ran (hilly terrain, so not really jogging), but I haven't been very active during the winter, other than some minor weight lifting. Now that it's finally getting warmer again, I plan to up my activity by a lot and lose the last few pounds I need in the first half of this year.

As for the numbers, I started out at around 440 lbs and I'm at 210 now. I'm 185cm tall (don't feel like finding a calculator now, but that's about 6.1 I think), so I should probably lose 10-20 lbs still, depending on how much muscle I plan to put on (and I do plan to put on muscle). I've been losing 20+ a month when I started and this has been steadily dropping. Now I lose about 6-8 lbs a month, and it's not as linear as it used to be, but I have yet to experience a plateau longer than 2 and a half weeks.

Other than that, my health has been great. I got basically cured of hypertensia, though I'm still getting off the pills (slowly reducing the dosage), my hormones got rebalanced and my heart is now in the nice 50-70 bpm range (it used to be 110-130). Everything is just great.

If you have more questions, feel free to ask. LoseIt helped me a lot, so I'd like to return the favor.

Here's me right around my biggest: http://imgur.com/Od5F2 and here's me a few days ago (never mind that I look pissed, it was early in the AM): http://i.imgur.com/tOtwE.jpg .  I would love to do another 10 pounds or so, but I'm gonna take it easier.  Here's how I did it: Gym 5 days a week, sunday through thursday.  No exceptions, ever.  I had to become very strict, but once I got in the habit it was pretty easy.  I would do 3 days of strictly cardio, and 2 days cardio and weights.  As far as diet goes, I didn't watch what I ate, just how much of it.  I cut my calories to about 1200 a day, which isn't much, but I tried to fill it with protein filled food.  I don't really know what else to write, but I feel awesome! 

EDIT: Ok, I'm back to answer a few of the questions you guys had.  
First, what kept me motivated?  For the first ten pounds or so, it was seeing pictures of myself.  I was sick of being the tubby guy.  After the first 10 pounds it became increasingly easier, as I did not want to undo the progress I have made.  ""I've worked hard to lose xx lbs, if I eat that donut it'll start to undo it.  
Second, what exactly did you do at the gym?  Pulled from an answer below, 3 days a week I would do elliptical (increasing level every week) for 25 minutes and then jog. I completed couch to 5k and continued with it, adding more every week. On lifting days I would start with the elliptical just like cardio days, then just kind of do random weights for a while, and then bike for 20 minutes, increasing the difficulty every week.  I spent anywhere from an hour to 90 minutes at the gym.  
Finally, why do you look so pissed in your second picture?  Again pulled from an answer below, I was leaving for work, dressed normally for work as any other day, and my mom was home. She decided she wanted to take my picture because she just got a new phone. She took about 5 before this one in different locations but wasnt happy with them. I just wanted to go to work. By this point I was grumpy!

Been over weight my whole life,I was picked on and bullied. I went away to college and became more confident.  last year I quit smoking for my new years resolution and this year I promised myself I would lose weight. Working in a kitchen, lifting and standing all day, helped and I lost 20lbs last summer. I also stopped drinking soda. But, when I went back to finish school I stopped losing weight. I graduated in December 2011 and I got a gym membership for christmas. I sort of just dicked around not doing much with it until March. I started going to the gym religiously, for the first 2 months I went everyday. I got a trainer to show me the ropes so I didn't hurt myself. Then I cut back only going 3-4 times a week. I ate healthier too. I never cut things out of my diet because I would end up just craving the things more.  I just ate in moderation and with better choices. I did cut back heavily on carbs and sugar. Since march I lost the last 80lbs. Now my goal is to put on some muscle which I regret not doing during the weight loss. I did cardio for the most part, i ran and swam, adding some HIIT and lifting every now and then. I lift more these days with still a lot of cardio.

You guys are one of the supportive, helpful bunches of people in the world, not just the interwebs.  And because I am so fond of this place, I wanted to address a couple things that I feel like we've been seeing more than usual lately.

**1. Read the FAQ.**

Yes, I know it's long.  I know there's a lot to digest.  But almost every question relating to diet or weight loss is in there.  If you don't have the patience to read the FAQ and you try to lose a bunch of weight, you're gonna have a bad time.  Everything about this requires patience.

**2. Starvation Mode**

I swear by MyFitnessPal- for the most part.  However, the emphasis they put on 'starvation mode' from one day to the next is, as near as I can gather, just there to prevent them from getting sued.  Starvation mode takes more than a few days to get into, and frankly, if you were getting all of the other vitamins, nutrients, and minerals you need, it would take even longer.  The posts about ""I only ate 1000 calories today, am I in starvation mode?"" make me sad.  And there are a lot of them.  You're breaking my heart, guys.

**3. Weight Training**

And girls, I'm talking mostly to you here.  STOP BEING AFRAID OF WEIGHTS.  You're not going to Hulk Up overnight, that's simply not how it works!  And yes, you probably WILL gain a few pounds- but pounds of muscle- healthy, sexy, awesome muscle!  

**4. I Can't....**

Nope, not with that attitude you can't.  86 the negativity.  It's almost as bad for you as fried Oreos.  A bad attitude, a negative attitude, a defeatist attitude will creep into everything you do.  But then again, so will a positive one.  Don't be afraid to leave your comfort zone.  If you spend your whole life thinking about all the things you can't or won't do, you will never know what you are truly capable of.

**5. Motivation**

I'm gonna leave this one in the hands of a professional.  These are the truest words I have ever read, brought to you by our favorite astrophysicist, Dr. Neil DeGrasse Tyson:

‎""The problem, often not discovered until late in life, is that when you look for things like love, meaning, motivation, it implies they are sitting behind a tree or under a rock. The most successful people recognize, that in life they create their own love, they manufacture their own meaning, they generate their own motivation.

For me, I am driven by two main philosophies, know more today about the world than I knew yesterday. And along the way, lessen the suffering of others. You'd be surprised how far that gets you.""

**TL;DR**  You guys fucking rock, whether you're just getting your toes in the water, or if you're close to the finish line.  Don't ever sell yourselves short.  What we do here is amazing, and we have the ability to be better EVERY SINGLE DAY than we were yesterday. &lt;3

[Before and After](http://imgur.com/5v1Ye)

I think that it's safe to say that I've been overweight almost all of my life, but, during my first semester of college, things just got way out of control. I went from being around 270 lbs in January 2011 to 310 lbs in May of 2011. I still remember that morning in May when I got on that scale and saw ""310.2"" on the scale; I mean, I knew I was overweight, but this really cut to the core. I felt so disgusting, and It made my already low self esteem plummet even further. So then began my journey to lose the weight


Height: 6' 1''

STARTING WEIGHT: 310.2 LBS
ENDING WEIGHT: 176.0 LBS

Pant Size: 40"" (Barely fitting into them)

Background

In 2008, I made a new-years resolution to get fit and enjoy life more. After 6 months of extreme dieting and working out at the gym I think I probably lost around 60-70 LBS. After all the motivation I got from my Family and friends I continued on and am now in the best shape of my life!

I had recently become super obsessed with my calorie intake / scale number and had been so hard on myself when it wasn't moving. I know that this isn't ""safe"" behavior so I've been really trying to just breathe and let it flow. As of today I have reached an all-time low (other than middle school) so I thought it would be a great time to see some progress pictures.

Okay so.. How did I do it?! I started off by just walking and ""watching what I ate"" that got me from 260lbs to around 235lbs. Starting last summer I began a keto-based diet. It did wonders for me and I will never bash the diet. I found that the more I lost the more I became obsessed with carbs to the point that I would forgo all social events, I wouldn't trust anything basically. I knew it wasn't healthy.

At around 180lbs I started to just count calories, ""eat clean"" (well, minus my Starbucks and frozen yogurt addiction), and just exercise. I am now 166lbs! I go to the gym 5 times a week and do all different classes. Hip-Hop, Zumba, Pure Strength (I hate it so much, it's so hard!), Ultimate Stretch, etc. I have fun in those classes and it doesn't seem like exercise at all.

Overall I've lost 94lbs, and really just want to tone it up and get rid of the rest of the flab!

I was did lose weight, but I soon came to my senses and realized that was not the way to do it. I remember seeing something in the 170's, but then, before I knew it, I was in the 200's. 

After a few more failed attempts at losing weight since then, I finally hit my highest weight of 224. This summer, my eyes were opened to the astounding number of weight-loss communities found all over the internet. I look back and notice I was missing support and direction all those years. I've also realized that many people, including myself, make the concept of losing weight far more complicated than it needs to be.

I have a before and current down below, sorry they aren't the best though.

I started out dating my wife about 10 years ago, and weighing in at around 150. I was working in a warehouse at the time, on my feet all day. I soon after got a desk job, in which I carried over the same metabolism, devouring fast food every day. Fast forward a few years, I was clocking in at around 245. I started last year, just cutting down on soda, stopped eating fast food, and tried to keep my bigger meals to earlier in the day (breakfast/lunch). Beyond that, I didn't do too much for the first while, and eventually started exercising more, mainly cardio. My wife and I started trail running, but in Minnesota, that season didn't last long. We have become more active outdoors however, and this looks like it will continue into the winter months with us more than likely purchasing snowshoes soon.

My wife has been a huge influence in this, she's been wanting to lose weight as well, and she's dropped a few pounds, and still going. My nephew in-law last christmas asked me why I was fat (he's a little kid, and yes I was rather large still at the time), and that kicked me into gear as well. Fast forward to now, and I'm down to about 190. I've got another 20 to 30 pounds to go, but the end is in sight.

Today is my 6 year anniversary with my wife, and after we were hot and heavy in the bedroom she said that she could feel that I've gotten bigger. I know I can tell I'm a little bit, but hearing that from her gave me a huge boost in confidence and more motivation to lose more and get to my goal weight.

And the last bit of motivation? My awesome wife bought us tickets to Puerto Rico for Valentine's Day! I guess it's time to shed that last bit of weight, this should be a challenging holiday season, but I know I can do it.

Thanks Loseit for providing me that extra motivation as well!

I love him and he is a great person and part of my motivation for losing it. All things considered though i deserve more. 

So today i won a pat on the back becuase i used to eat when i was upset but instead i walked and did errands and cleaned.

Today i won because i respected myself and ended something unhealthy and i didnt hurt myself by eating something i should not have or overeating.

For starters, I'm a 27 yr old female, 5'7"", and have struggled with my weight all my life. Between bad eating habits, warped body image from mom (""You could be so pretty if you lost weight!"" and other such crap encouragement) and a sedentary lifestyle I was resolved that my big body was just my lot in life and that's the way it would always be. It wasn't until I broke 200lbs that I knew I had to do something, and I didn't do anything until I was over 210 and finally found the motivation to change EVERYTHING about how I eat and exercise. Eat less, move more became my moto. 

First of all, I knew I had to make this change for myself. I didn't tell anyone, not even my husband, about my goals or my progress for the first few months. My husband caught on pretty quickly though, since I was turning my nose up to McDonald's runs and choosing salads over chicken strips. I took it one meal at a time, and tried not to get too down on myself if I slipped up. I successfully weened myself off soda, candy and fast food, which used to be my biggest vices. That alone helped with my first goal of getting under 200lbs. I kept setting myself 10lb goals, with no big time lines to meet them, and just kept surprising myself every time I stepped on that scale. 

I successfully weened myself off of World of Warcraft as well, and replaced my need for video games with a Kinect and Dance Central for the Xbox. I knew the only way I could get myself to work out is if I could do it in ideal conditions: my living room, pajamas, haven't washed my hair in days. I literally have no excuses not to work out anymore, and I've replaced my go-to game with Your Shape Fitness Evolved 2012 which helped me step up my work out and really motivates me to keep going. This last month I've been counting calories and keeping it around 1200 calories a day (down from 800 calories a meal!) 

This all started with a New Years resolution, and 8 months later I've actually surpassed my original dream goal and just hit 150lbs. For the first time in my life my BMI isn't considered overweight and I weight less than I did in middle school, and that was before I got boobs! 

I have such a new outlook on food and nutrition that it seems second nature now and I see no problem with continuing this trend and getting even fitter. Next up is some Kickboxing lessons and to get myself running more. Also, more yoga!

[This](http://i.imgur.com/PaEkI.jpg) is me, derping along at the ripe young age of 16, in 1999.  I loved to play pool, and it's about the most exercise I ever got.  I was a typical fat kid... got picked on, low self esteem, and very few friends. I'll share you the sob story, and just say that I was very unhappy, and the only thing that kept me from offing myself was the fear of death.  

Skip ahead a few years.  This wasn't the digital age, so I just don't have many photos, although I'm sure my mom does somewhere.  [Here](http://i.imgur.com/8l9wj.jpg) I am about a year out of high school. 305lbs.  I drank A LOT, I smoked a lot of weed, I did other various drugs, but not to an extreme.  I was unhappy, and I was always felt alone.  

I didn't have many friends in high school, but I had met a guy that I had always liked in 10th grade.  We didn't hang out outside of class, but we just made each other laugh. After we graduated, he left town for a year or so, and I somehow bumped into him somewhere when he moved back, we hung out, got wasted together a few times, and fell right back into like we were in high school.  This guy would turn out to be a life saver, and to this day I am closer to him than I am my own brother.  Through all the bad days, all the times when I felt worthless, all the rejections from chicks, and just the load of emotions that one can imagine I might have been dealing with, he was always there to talk to, and he never treated me any different than he treated other people.  I never felt like he put anyone higher than me in a hierarchy simply because of my physical appearance.  He was a fitness type of dude too.  I'm talking 6'5''ish, 225lbs, built like a brick shithouse, but the dude made me feel human.  For once I hung out with someone and felt like I was their equal, and this created some type of unbreakable bond.  I am not ashamed to say that I love [this](http://i.imgur.com/TCAik.jpg) man. lol

One day he asked me if I wanted to start working out.  HELL YEA I DO. We started lifting weights, and over the course of a year I didn't make any noticeable progress I'm sure, but I felt better.  I didn't change my diet, and I was still drinking heavily.  But I didn't care about that, I had a new friend, who was a real friend.  He mentioned martial arts... I had always been interested, but lets be real, what teenage boy isn't.  Here comes the life saving part, I couldn't afford to go to this martial arts gym.  It was an hour away, and gym dues, which I was already paying at the YMCA.  My objection didn't fly, because he immediately just said he would always drive, and he would pay for me to go. This blew my fucking mind, and kind of made me uncomfortable, but we did it.  We stuck with it, and for a few years we went, almost every day, monday through friday, and took Muay Thai and Brazilian Jui jitsu.  I quit lifting weights, though During this time, I put forth a lot of effort when it came to martial arts.  I didn't eat right, but in class, I always felt like I had to prove myself.  I always felt like people needed to know that I deserved to be there, even though I was fat.  When I was in class, I was fucking working, and I always looked like I had just gotten out of the swimming pool when I was done.

Over the first few years I slowly lost about fifty pounds.  I still tried to stay away from cameras, and I still basically had low self esteem, but I started realizing that I moved better.  I WAS ACTUALLY GETTING GOOD!!! This made me want to fight.  I was around 250 [here](http://i.imgur.com/LzrIY.jpg), but I decided that wasn't going to last long.  I started eating better, but still not nearly good enough, and I started training more, and harder.  Then I picked up one of [these](http://i.imgur.com/C8weX.jpg).  Holy shit if this is not one of the best things every.  I lost about 20 lbs in two weeks by doing [swings](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0_XjJjLc7NE).  This lit a fire under my ass, and I wanted to fight bad.  I scheduled an MMA fight, didn't have to worry about weight because I was heavyweight, 205 - 265, and I was definitely in that range.  I did fight training for an hour and a half a day, six days a week, and added basic kettlebell stuff.  I got pretty fit, and the day before the fight I was about 220, but sadly, the show was cancelled that.  I had just spent nine weeks in pain, working hard for nothing, and this kind of crushed my resolve, so I took a short break. Back to about 240 :( 

When I saw the scale a month later, I realized that I couldn't quit, so I just got back after it.  I spent the next couple of years training, but not at a fighting pace, and sticking with kettlebells.  2005ish, I looked like [this](http://i.imgur.com/vVZuI.jpg). Stayed around 220 or 230.  I ran some, but running has always hurt my knees, so I would basically just run/walk a mile or so.  This is where I truly started to be happy.  I could do things that I could never do, like a pull up.  It was only one, but it was my first one, and that feeling was amazing. 

So I hear that a bar in town is going to have some boxing matches, and decide I want to fight in it.  I am not a boxer, and you wouldn't believe how much different it can be from muay thai/kickboxing.  This didn't stop me, I took to my friends garage, (by this time I only traveled to the gym like once a month, life happens) and worked on boxing, I changed my diet, and I dropped about 25 pounds, ended up fighting at 201.  I won, but it was not pretty.  Watching the video made me want to work even harder.  I was better than what I saw in the video of the fight, and it made me more determined than ever. [Here] is me, just after the fight. 201 lbs.

After this, I quit eating right, but I kept working out, just not as hard, so I just stayed at around 205.  I felt skinny, and to be honest I didn't think I could lose much more weight.  By this time I was better at kickboxing than my big friend, and others at the gym that I had thought would always be better than me.  Everybody at the gym was always motivational, so they gave me the confidence I needed to just keep going.  I decided to fight again, and I didn't pay attention to my weight much, but I needed to be at 205, so I really just had to not gain any.  My workout was still mostly Marital Art and Kettlebell based.  You can see the fight [here](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s2tiAvgBwyk&amp;list=UUiXhuzOPf7zkXr_QTWHsFoQ&amp;index=4&amp;feature=plcp). 

This is where I did a change up.  I wanted to try and fight at 185.  I felt a little slow, and after watching my fat jiggle around in that fight, I was pretty sure that I could lose more weight.  I started running more, and RINGS! I love gymnast rings.  I started eating about 90% paleo, drink 100grams of protein a day, and I was always hungry.  I dropped my fight training for this to about 20 minutes a day.  4 rounds hitting thai pads, 3 minutes per round, 1 minute break, but you're going balls to the wall for that three minutes.  [example:me hitting pads a few months ago](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=juzkSy0aLMc&amp;list=UUiXhuzOPf7zkXr_QTWHsFoQ&amp;index=9&amp;feature=plcp).  I also started lifting free weights at the Y again, and continued using Kettlebells even more.  I concentrated on core strength, and speed.
End result, I got down to 183, and fought in [Indianapolis](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wUhzuOMZQmY&amp;list=UUiXhuzOPf7zkXr_QTWHsFoQ&amp;index=1&amp;feature=plcp).  I felt like I was in the matrix.  

After this fight, I kept doing all the same things, except I made my diet pretty habitual.  I lost weight between then and the next fight without even trying.  My diet is as follows.

Wake up, drink a cup of coffee, eat a banana or a kiwi.
Thirty minutes of light cardio
Two hours or so later I usually eat again, another piece of fruit and nuts or sunflower seeds.  
Two hours later a protein drink, maybe some yogurt. 
I lift weights in the middle of the day.
After is a random food. I'm always hungry after the gym.  Usually eat about three hundred calories or so.  Sometimes its fruit, sometimes it's nuts, sometimes it's protein shake or bar.  
Cardio for about 30 minutes
Dinner- Usually consists of plenty of meat and vegetables.  Very few starches.  I almost never eat baked potatoes or corn anymore.  Sweet potatoes and Avocados are almost daily.
Anywhere from two to four hours after that I usually eat a bowl of cereal and go to bed.  

And yes, I eat pretty much the same crap every day.  Learn the following phrase and the future you will be much happier:
""FOOD IS ENERGY, NOT ENTERTAINMENT"" 
 

I lost weight on accident, and ended up fighting light.  I was 175, he was 185.  I am extremely proud of this fight, because this guy is a Muay Thai instructor, and I weighed ten pounds less than him.  The beating that occurred can be seen [here](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cXgqF-2_QMY&amp;list=UUiXhuzOPf7zkXr_QTWHsFoQ&amp;index=7&amp;feature=plcp).  

That's pretty much my story.  I plan on fighting agian, but I'm nursing through a shoulder injury that I had before the last fight, in which I made it a lot worse.  It's almost back to normal, and I still train, just don't throw punches with my right hand very much.  

[Here](http://i.imgur.com/HHRTP.jpg) is the ultimate panorama.
And [here](http://i.imgur.com/Jmap6.jpg) is a nice shot of my turtle shell after working out, for the ladies of Reddit. :)

This is kind of embarrassing but here is what I learned...

* I was eating about 3000 calories a day broken into two large meals.
* Of my ~3000 calories a day about ~800 of them were from drinks (soda, juice, milk, ect.)
* I did not prepare anything I ate, i.e fast food, restaurants, frozen pizza, ect.
* About half my meals were eaten in my car.

I'm really glad I did this because, before I started tracking what I ate, I had no idea how to get started. It all seemed so overwhelming but now I have some concrete rules I can stick to. 

1. No more meals in the car.
1. Only drink water and the occasional diet soda.
1. Eat more frequently. I have suspicion the reason my meals were so large is because I was letting myself get crazy with hunger.
1. Try to prepare as much of the food I eat as possible.

So now I have a plan and hopefully following these rules along with a strict 1700 calorie limit and a little exercise this attempt will finally be the time I lose weight.

When I was around 15/16, my father bought my mom sessions with a personal trainer for Christmas. Instead of being offended, my mother (a woman who had done fad diets since I was a small child) took it as a sign she was doing something wrong. That was when she decided to begin working out with a personal trainer and focus on making herself healthy so that she could live a long and fulfilled life.

It's been 8 years since my mom got that present from my dad. She was 42 at the time. In December of 2011, she celebrated her 50th birthday. That's 80 lbs later. She went from a size 22 to a size 8. Of course, she's still losing. When asked, my mother stated that she was once during this journey a size 6 and felt really comfortable there. She hopes to go back. Still though....a size 8 to 6 doesn't seem nearly as drastic as size 22 to 8. 

- Why is her weight loss different from others?
I was browsing r/loseit before posting this and I saw a lot of young adults/teenagers posting. I commend so many of yours' transformations and I am so proud of you. I've never been extremely heavy. I had my high school chunk that I got rid of via exercise, but nothing too extreme - so I can't fathom how wonderful you feel. BUT many of you are young. Young bodies can actually get fit faster, but older bodies? It's not as easy. Let's face it, a 21 year old is not built like a 42 year old. A 46 year old can't look at a 30 year old and say 'I want those results'...because your bodies aren't the same. My mom wasn't young when she started this. She was 42. Her young bouncy body? It was gone. To lose as much weight as she did at her age makes me feel like this is inspirational to those who aren't 30-25 and younger. If she can do it (and no, she's not a stick thin woman - she has curves), then you can too, right?

-The Result?
My mom's happy. She's happier than she was. Almost every picture of her since her weight loss is her smiling a big healthy smile. This didn't just change her attitude either. Inspired by her personal trainer and her newfound love for working out, my mother actually went back to school (online courses) to be a personal trainer. She now works as one, with certifications in Sports Nutrition as well as Senior Fitness Training. The trainee becomes the trainer. A fairytale gym story!



I hope my mom's story inspires some of you as much as she inspires me on a daily basis. I love her so much and am incredible proud of her!


(Found some grammar errors. As an ex-journalism major, they bugged me. They have now been fixed :D)


**OP NOTE: I showed my mom all of your comments and my mom is so grateful for all the positive feedback, even the MILF jokes. She's so happy to inspire so many and hopes you all continue to live healthy lives. She says she couldn't have done it without a supportive family, her trainer, and the best gym ever - Fitness 19. Yeah, she's plugging her work a bit, but Fitness 19 is where she started this journey as well.

Junk food, lack of exercise, poor sleeping habits, and bit too much alcohol intake had caused me to balloon up to 270lbs on my 6'5"" frame. Here is what I did:

-I changed my diet to one with lots of fruit and vegetables with a serving of meat less than four times a week. I (mostly) avoid all junk food, never drink pop, juice, sports drinks, or most anything other than water, black coffee, unsweetened almond milk and pure coconut water. Desserts are now an occasional treat instead of a nightly occurrence.

-I sleep 6-8 hours a night, always between 11pm-7am.

-I now only drink alcohol on special occasions, and never to excess.

-I run. A lot. It started off as a cheap and quick way to burn calories and has become my favourite hobby. I've started with zero endurance and now I've finished a 10k, 2 half marathons, and just two weeks ago came in 3rd (for Men 20-29) at a 10 mile race. I'm running a 30km trail race next month and a full marathon next spring.

-When traveling around my city, I drive less and bicycle more.

As of this spring I weigh 185lbs, what I feel is a healthy and maintainable weight. I've never counted calories or adopted a strict diet. I've never seen a personal trainer or had a gym membership. Other than running and cycling, all my other exercises can be done at home with minimal equipment (planks, push-ups, chin-ups). I've only made small changes that are sustainable for life.

For everyone out there, you can lose it, and keep it off for life!

How I did it?, counting calories and eating pretty much about everything I used to eat before, just smaller portions. I didnt stop drinking soda (even tho I try to drink diet ones), I didnt stop eating bread, cake whenever there is a bday or special ocassion, didnt stop eating mexican food which I love, didnt stop eating chocolate..
Diets **DO NOT** work, you gain all the weight back once you are done with them. The point here is LEARNING how to eat.
I drink lots of water, and workout at least 6 days a week.. Id do anything cardio, long walks ( I started walking slow for 20 minutes a day, now I walk 4-5 miles an hour), zumba, taebo, 30DS, Tiffany Rothe workouts, and im looking forward P90X.
I feel happy.. and my confidence is in the sky now.

------------

LONG, I'm SORRY! haha. I figured I'd post this here too, since I like looking at both keto AND loseit for inspiration and motivation. God, I wish I had known about reddit before 2 months ago. My keto meals would have been much more exciting!

ANYWAY The main post is the same as on r/keto, but I'm just going to add in my answers to a few questions that could have been addressed in the main post: 

So my husband and I have been together for about 4 1/2 years now. We just got married last Christmas because he's in the Navy. We would have liked to wait, but I wouldn't have been able to get any benefits and move around when he did (which is a lot!), so we did a quick courthouse thing. 

He's 6' and I'm 5'5 for reference.

This is the summer after our senior year of highschool. I think we were both in the 280-lb range. [2009](http://i.imgur.com/HRoRHPH.jpg)

This is us when he hit 300, and I had gotten to (at least) 310. [Summer2010](http://i.imgur.com/uXehse7.jpg)

And this is from fall, where he was at 185 and I was somewhere around 218. [October2012](http://i.imgur.com/xVOo5oe.jpg)

I believe he's the same right now, he's putting on more muscle.... and today I clocked in at 199!!!! I haven't seen 190-anything since middle school. I'll have to get an updated pic of the two of us. We've both been big our whole lives.

We had to spend some time apart during college, and he had started keto back in fall-winter of 2010. He told me about it, but I didn't think it would do anything for me. He kept losing weight and in January he joined the Navy. By the time he graduated from basic he was down to 185. I think he only lost 10 lbs during bootcamp.

The weekend he graduated, (In Sept 2011) I went home and started p90x (which before, I had failed to complete several times) and he guided me in how to change my eating. I never worried about keto-sticks and I had a lot of slip ups with eating early on. I can't believe my cheating didn't hinder me as much as it should have.

So I eased into keto, since he originally just wanted me to go low carb.

I'd say we've been super strict with absolutely no bad stuff for about a year now.

It kind of blows my mind that so far we've lost so much weight that you could ""make"" a third person that's a little heavier than either of us. And I'm still going!

Here's a small ""headless fat person"" pic of me before I started. For some reason. It's really hard to find any full body pics. I had trashed my original before pictures because I thought I would never lose anything. What a shame. [me, oh god](http://i.imgur.com/hc7GthI.jpg)

and here's a new pic from just the other day. [yesss](http://i.imgur.com/v6XxCVj.jpg)

And I talked him into letting me post [HIS](http://i.imgur.com/wuynxXR.jpg) progress. This image I believe he posted to /fit. 

****questions I answered:

I aim for 1700 calories a day but I'm not very strict about it. I don't think he counts calories. 

I've been doing p90x since I started in September of 2011. I just started my 5th round Jan 2nd, and he decided to join me for this round! 6 days a week a mix of cardio and weights and one rest day. I only took a month off between round 1 and 2, and then a month between 2 and 3, while these last two rounds I didn't take time off between.

He was doing body-weight exercises and a bit of running when he first started, and then he began [starting strength](http://startingstrength.com/index.php/site/about). He'd rather be doing lifting than p90x but with his crazy schedule he can't get to a gym.

The biggest improvements (other than self esteem boosts): *I used to suffer from intense migraine headaches... Ever since I was 12 year old, and like emergency room bad, up to several times a month. I have no hard evidence it was one of these but ever since --

A) Cutting sugar and carbs B) Taking a mulitvitamin and C) Exercising, I haven't had a migraine in over a YEAR!

Knee problems run in my family (even in non-overweight members) and I used to have really bad back, knee and foot pain just working retail. 111 lbs less and I have hardly any pain. I figured p90x would be bad for my knees, but since focusing on proper squat and jumping form I haven't had any issues.

The increase in energy level for the both of us is incredible, and no sugar= less to no mood swings/blood sugar crashing for either of us.

Fixing keto meals at home is really saving us a lot of money, even though a lot of people think it's expensive, I just get a whole bunch of meat and veggies and make five different meals from one kind of meat. We can dine out, but for what you get when you ask for ""no bread/rice/sauce/etc"" I would just rather spend the amount of money and get twice as much food.... and no tips. But when we do eat out, we can almost anywhere and not feel limited.

Cheat days? We used to treat ourselves with our favorite Biggby (coffee chain from michigan) blended carmel-coffee drinks, but then we would end up going multiple times in the week. It was like crack. We figured in the end, the blood sugar spike wasn't worth it, and every.single.food we cheated with, was SO not worth it. The internet is a great tool for finding keto snacks and replacements that I swear feel like cheating, but aren't! My weakness is ice cream, so when I feel like a treat, I make protein ice cream with heavy cream. We really enjoy the food we eat. A Domino's pizza just doesn't hold up to our Meat-za. ----both of us agreed we will probably never go back to eating un-keto. Especially after watching documentaries like ""Fathead"" and doing research... and just seeing the results. Even our dog eats grain-free high-fat food. lol.

I used to worry a lot (even before I lost anything) about loose skin. I figured that I would look like a flying squirrel or have to go in for surgery... but it seems that with time (and being in my 20's still) I don't mind waiting a year or two for the skin to catch up. Even now- my arms are kind of floppy, and my stomach.... and my boobs are a little deflated, but I can see them actually shrinking, not just staying loose. I'm sure lifting weights is really helping with that. Anyway, I'd rather have loose skin that can be held in with some Spanx than the 111 lbs back on me and look ""fuller.""

My husband has maintained his weight for a year now, and any loose skin that seemed to be there has disappeared/tightened up. And he went from 300 to 180. It's a fact that what most people call ""loose skin"" is actually lose fat.

---

When I started I didn't have anyone to look to that was over 300lbs, and a female. (I just found all the different subreddits less than 2 months ago. I wish I had found them before!)

This is seriously the thing that made me get p90x and start working out... and eating better. I should probably tell him he was the reason I figured I would try it out. [Tommy Mygrant's](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEjw4km3KKE) p90x testimony

""I couldn't do 20% of what they were doing. But Tony said do your best and forget the rest, and whatever my best was that day, even if it was 8 pushups on my knees and taking the last 30 seconds off, that's what I did. I can struggle as much as I want in my living room. No one's watching.""

I'm just thinking that maybe there's someone out there that will see me or my husband and say ""hey, he/she's been overweight her whole life and her before picture looks just like my body type... maybe I'll try keto or p90x...""

I started off at 286 lbs (130 kgs), and am around 237 lbs (108 kgs) as of this morning. 19 year old female, 5'7"" (1.73 m). I have been feeling a bit unsure about my weightloss and whether I'm doing it right, but looking at my [progress pics](http://imgur.com/a/46kCu) (Bra and panties, NSFW! Terrible pics anyway, but w/e) made me realise I've actually lost quite a bit in the last couple of months! The before pics were taken around the 15th of August this year, and I took the during pics this afternoon. Just wanted to share. :)

Like I said, I started around the 15th of August. I had been thinking about wanting to lose weight for a loooong time, but hadn't really done much more than looking up information and educating myself on the subject (and then rewarding myself for my ""efforts""...). Looking back I'm glad I took a bit of time to prepare myself, because if I didn't I probably would've given up after a week or something.

But anyway, how I did it:

* Month 1: This is going to sound so lame, but it's really just this simple: I started walking instead of taking the bus, lowered my calorie intake to 1500/day and started logging everything. Did this for about a month, lost around 17 lbs. It was hard, but really doable. 

* Month 2: Started doing C25K on top of the walking. Felt like I was going to die after the first day, but it got better so incredibly quickly. Did week 1 for a month or so, because I was afraid I would fail week 2... Shouldn't have worried about that, but oh well. Lowered my cal intake to 1200/day.

* Month 3: Cal intake around 1300-1400/day, because 1200/day just wasn't sustainable. Started feeling like shit way too often. Upped my calories and felt better almost immediately. Started going to the gym. I now prefer doing my C25K routine on the treadmill, because fuck, I'm constantly cold now! People always laugh when I say this, but on a really cold day I actually miss those extra lbs... At least they kept me warm!

A regular day for me, food-wise:

* Breakfast: Three slices of wholewheat bread, 2x low fat cheese and 1x sandwich spread or something. This Dutchie can't live without her bread and cheese! Three glasses of water, about 0.75L. I'll make a double serving of this on Saturday and Sunday, to eat at work (chambermaid at a hotel). Pretty physically exhausting job, so I really need to eat something when it's lunchtime!

* Lunch: Usually a salad with a bit of grilled chicken. Salad mostly consists of a diced tomato, 2 pickles, some cucumber and a bit of low fat dressing or mayo. Again: water. One or two glasses. Sometimes when I don't have time to prepare a salad or when I don't feel like it, I'll have some bread or a piece of fruit like a banana. 

* Dinner: Anything! Really depends on my mood. Sometimes pasta with chicken and peas, other times rice with steamed vegetables, and occasionally just potatoes, a bit of meat and fresh veggies. I'm not a great cook... Again: water. 3 glasses.

* Snack: Usually a bit of yoghurt with fruit. Kiwi, grapes, banana, plums... Whatever.

So... This was my story! Loseit is an awesome community with great people who are all equally freakin' badass, I love hanging out here. Hope I can inspire someone with my story, and please don't hesitate to ask me anything about how I did it or anything. :)

EDIT Woops, forgot to mention my goal weight! I'm aiming for around 143 lbs (65 kgs). I'm really not sure what I'll look like at that weight, so I'll just have to see what's best. I've asked my parents and friends to tell me when they think I'm pushing it too far.
