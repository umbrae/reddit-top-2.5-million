1367200231.0,814,self.Dallas,1db5iv,Did anyone see me get jumped on Pacific Ave outside of Le Vu around 2 am Saturday morning?,985,171,518,http://www.reddit.com/r/Dallas/comments/1db5iv/did_anyone_see_me_get_jumped_on_pacific_ave/,"Last I remember I walked into Le Vu on Pacific Ave in West Deep Ellum (first time ever at this bar) and ordered a round of drinks for my two friends and I.  Next thing I know I wake up in the ER at Baylor looking like this at around 7 am on Saturday April 27.  http://imgur.com/a/4fgsj#0  (I had a class 3 concussion so I don't remember anything after buying the first round of drinks)
A detective came by today and gave me a few details from the police report.  Witness reported that I was outside the bar (waiting for a cab most likely) and two men were in a car parked outside as well.  Some sort of a verbal argument happen between myself and the driver.  The driver jumped out and knocked me out and then the passenger walked around and kicked me in the face repeatedly.  They then got back in their car and drove away.  No one got the plates and I'm not yet sure of the car make and model.  I arrived at Baylors ER by 2:51.


Talked to my friends yesterday morning and they said a little after 1:30 am on the 27th they asked me if I wanted to leave and I said I wanted to wait until it closed (they said I may have been talking to a girl I met).  So they left and weren't there when it happen.

Damage:

*6-7 stitches on my right cheek.

*6-7 stitches above my left eye.

*class 3 concussion

*fractured forehead and sinus cavity

*because of fractured sinus cavity, there is an air bubble on my brain and some sinus bacteria may have leaked out as well

*left cheek is caved in

*nose is severely broken

*left eye swollen shut (it's starting to go down now though)

*horizontal gash on the bridge of the nose

*Several scrapes and cuts on the right side of my face from the concrete

*several bruises and cuts on my neck and body from concrete impact and kicks that missed my head


I am meeting with a plastic surgeon tomorrow to assess the damage tomorrow, but I definitely need reconstructive surgery.  I have to pay for surgery, the ambulance ride, and 3 days (so far) in the hospital.  I need help to find these people who did this, any information would be greatly appreciated.

Edit: fixed formatting. 


Edit: I passed out from my pain meds after posting this. Holy shit guys, thanks for the input. I am def going to look into the Texas Victum Crime Reimbursement thing. Thanks guys, its going to take some time to read through all these!


Edit 3: Apparently it was Jenna Jamesons birthday party at that bar that night.

My brother is on the way to pick her up, and all is well.  Not sure what to from this point onward, but at least she is stationary, hydrated, and safe.


It's been a long night for me.  I live in Mississippi but this is what I've been able to piece together:

She was discharged from University Behavioral Health Center in Denton about 24 hours ago.  She attempted to drive north to Bonham but somehow got lost and ended up at an abandoned Jack in The Box in Dallas.  The meds have left her moderately delusions.  She's improved but when the withdrawals hit, she'll be loopy again.  Her truck was stolen, which has all of her money and belongings in it.  My brother tried to find her last night but could not.  Going to try again after some sleep.

Got her to promise to stay here until help comes:

EDIT: Proper address:  Physical address: 10304 Forest﻿ Lane, Dallas, TX

EDIT:  Some pictures would probably help:  http://imgur.com/pcVbu,L1tNY,TighK,sLrcE,Htq8p

Just asking that if some of you are bored or have a few dollars to spare to stop by, find her, and give her some water or food or something.  Just water mostly.  Keep from having a heat stroke until my brother shows up.

I did call the cops, they've been by twice and didn't see the need to bring her in.

Also, I've asked my YouTube followers to help out.  Just trying to crowd source something I'm unable to do at the moment.  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D94I40RR3w4

Here is the airport's response which I thought went above and beyond:
 
The aircraft you experienced was an F18 that entered the Metroplex airspace from the southwest.  It was cleared to cross over DFW for a landing at Dallas Love Airport (DAL).  It crossed over your neighborhood at about 4,000' above ground level, traveling the same corridor used by commercial aircraft destined for DAL that arrive from the southwest during south flow (when the winds are from the south).  In terms of the technological progress made over the last 40 years in quieting commercial aircraft, your F18 provides an excellent comparison.  Military aircraft are not subject to the quieting requirements placed on commercial aircraft.  Though a military jet and a commercial jet may share basically the same engine, the commercial jet is much quieter.

1370186522.0,125,self.Dallas,1fism6,Just want to say thank you to whoever found my wallet yesterday outside Office Depot and left it with the store manager so I could get it back. You are an awesome person and it meant a lot more than you know.,158,33,10,http://www.reddit.com/r/Dallas/comments/1fism6/just_want_to_say_thank_you_to_whoever_found_my/,"First off, thanks a ton. And even though you'll probably never read this, here’s my long stupid story of how you made my weekend.  


So, I've been pretty down on myself for a quite a while and unsure of how or if I could remedy it.  I've done the whole antidepressant regimen a few times with a few different kinds but they just made me feel nothing. No emotion, ever.  So I don’t take them and instead just kind of live life in a semi depressed mood.  Occasionally though, I’ll wake up and feel like I can take on the world.    
    
Yesterday, for some unbeknownst reason, was one of those days. I was in a great mood.  It was a beautiful day, I had the windows down and top down on my jeep, and I just felt upbeat and optimistic.  Hell, I was even convinced I looked good.     

So it's a sunny Saturday and I'm cruising with some good beats, just jamming having a good time, when it just sort of dawns on me why I I'm always feeling so down. My life is a disorganized mess, and I'm terrified to take any steps, even baby steps, to push myself along in the right direction.    

Why do I struggle to do that?  Well, since I'm so disorganized I lack any real schedule, which makes me lazy.  But then I had this epiphany, so I went home, went on craigslist, and bought myself a filing cabinet to start getting literally organizing my life.  I mean, I pay bills on time and whatnot, but all of my important stuff I should have filed away is in various piles strewn about my apartment.  

Anyway I got a good deal on this two drawer filing cabinet, brought it home, rearranged my whole room so I could start fresh, then headed to office depot to grab the hanging sleeves and folders for it.  I was pumped to start being an adult.    
 
So I bought the office supply stuff and start heading home.  I decide to pick up some a chicken and some salad stuff from Tom Thumb for dinner later.  Go up to pay, reach in my pockets and my stomach just drops.  I'm wearing mesh basketball shorts with just 2 pockets.  My wallet is actually just a little folded leather sleeve , kind of like a money clip, but with room for a few cards, some cash inside, then i wrap a rubber band around it. But regardless it's not there. 

Phone:yes. Keys:yes. Nothing else.  I tell the cashier I think I left my wallet in my car and will be back.  I go look everywhere with no luck.  So I shamefully walk back inside and tell the lady I lost my wallet.  They were nice though and didn't make  put back all the food whilst hiding my face and being laughed at by everyone behind my back.  

Got in the car and called the Office Depot hoping for a miracle.    I was there only 20 minutes ago, but I just felt awful.  I once lost a backpack from the backseat when I took a corner too fast in the jeep with the doors off and it flew out in the middle of the road.  I went back mere minutes later when I realized but it was long gone.   I had little hope for my poor little wallet.

But I had to call to be sure. There was always a chance. 

 
And so I called.  And they had no idea what I was talking about and said no one was in buying filing folders earlier.  Talk about disheartening and dejecting. Not only was the wallet gone but I they couldn't even recall me from 20 minutes ago, and I talked with like 4 people.  

Turns out I'm a moron I called the wrong store.  There were 2 stores displayed on google maps on my phone and I chose wrong. 

So I rang the other store.  And just as soon as I  brought up the situation and mentioned I there minutes earlier looking for filing folders, the goddess on the other end of the line finished my sentence for me, asking if I was looking for my wallet because someone turned one in. 

 **Holy shit.**  

That feeling of relief was glorious.  It was like being physically and emotionally cleansed of all your sins ever in one of those private jacuzzi bathtubs that rich people have but never use. The ones with the jets and water suction pump that can suck your hair in and try to drown you, and you're sharing with none other than Jesus himself, who blessed the bathwater too so you know it's gotta be pretty holy. Only greater. 


I'm talking relief like when you've been running errands all day with an upset stomach, and, finally, just as you pull into the driveway, bitching to your girlfriend about how it's *not* cute to be herded around IKEA by those stupid fucking arrows like a rat when suddenly your stomach turns on you. **FUCK.** Next thing you know doors are flying open and you're barreling from the car, to the house, and into the bathroom as fast as humanly possible, all the while trying to simultaneously focus on unclasping your belt and keeping your asshole clenched, and before your pants can even slide down to your knees-before your cheeks even touch the seat, your bowels violently evacuate. And as you're flushed out completely head in hands and sweat beading at your hairline, you fucking made it kind of relief. 

So yeah, from sheer dread to ecstasy in like 8 words. Maybe less, maybe more. We'll say 6-10 give or take.

And thus, with my positive outlook renewed, I returned to whence I came, eager to be reunited with my only black friend. The doors parted like magic as I walked in - Oh was it heavenly.  I was greeted with open arms and cheering from some guy looking for printer ink.

 Yeah yeah, so cheering is exaggerating, and maybe the open arms too.  Basically the lady manager I talked with on the phone basically just handed me my baby looking at me like *yeah, this shit happens, you lucked out.* But enough about her, more about me. I was ecstatic. Everything still there.  Like 60 bucks, 2 credit cards, debit card, license, fucking everything. All there.  

Apparently a customer had seen me drop it or saw it on the ground in the parking lot and without giving it a second thought brought it straight to the store manager.  They probably yelled to me but I play my music too loud because that's how I like it so they're desperate cries of *please come back......please* never made it to my ears.

Honestly though I can't thank whoever found it and turned it in enough.  If you had caught up with me I would have offered to buy you a beer or lunch or something.

As I mentioned at the beginning, I've been pretty down on myself, and it tends to have a pessimistic effect on how I see not only myself, but others too.  Though you didn't know I was in the middle of trying to get my life together, if you hadn't come along who knows what the hell could have happened.  Just took a good person in the right place in the right time and my weekend was made.

**tl;dr:** Wallet returner - you're alright in my book.  Yesterday you provided me immense instantaneous relief, much akin to that of Orajel or a close call with explosive diarrhea.  Now I can be an adult!

I've grown up here, lived abroad and around other parts of the states and I have to say I've just never seen anything like it. Even in China, a place famous for its 'no rules' driving etiquette, has shown me more courtesy on major roads. We seem to have, in the past 4 years, received an influx of really pissed off spiteful car owners. 

Any time I'm switching lanes on 635 the turnsignal, which was once a bastion of roadway notification, now means ""please speed past me as fast as you can and disregard my exit coming up"". 

I can take a little abuse on the roads but lately, especially with 635 construction drivers have resorted to giving zero fucks about other drivers. I cannot tell you how many near fatal/pileup events I've seen within the past 60 days. The other night on 635 at around 6:00PM I saw a honda civic (with a spoiler for bonus speed) cut off around 5 cars, switch in the left lane and as an 18 wheeler was slowly (and curteously) switching lanes into the left to enter 35 the honda driver had the gall to speed up, effectively cutting off the 18 wheeler and putting himself and everyone around him in danger. The worst of this epidemic is the classic ""spiteful"" driver. The guy who sits in your blind spot knowing you are trying to switch over or the guy who is in the 35 lane and slams on the accelerator to get on 635 at the last moment.  

So...what gives? does anyone else notice how bad people have been lately? Also whats up with all the boy racers on the tollway at 8:00 AM in the morning?",,False,self,t5_2qnkr,False,,,True,t3_182jfm,http://www.reddit.com/r/Dallas/comments/182jfm/alright_dallas_we_gotta_talk_youre_driving_is/,

I have a special story I just want to share. I don't really have anyone special to share it with... so I think you will appreciate it.

I am a 22[F] and I move to Dallas from Houston 3 years ago after losing my home in a Hurricane Ike. About 2 weeks after I moved here, I was raped. I called the police, but they couldn't catch him. 10 months later, the same man raped another woman. And then the month after that, another. (I later came to find out he went to Detroit in between time) There were 3 KNOWN victims total, including myself.

After 3 years of waiting and waiting, we finally started the trial last Monday. It lasted until today, when he was finally sentenced. He was sentenced to 62 years, so he will essentially spend the rest of his life in prison.

At first, I wasn't satisfied. I kind of hardened myself, which I was proud of, because when i took the stand to testify, I was so strong and gave one of county's toughest defense lawyers a run for his money. When they read the verdict, I knew that it meant he'd spend the rest of his life in jail but for some reason I just couldn't find it in myself to celebrate like the other victims and their families. I just kind of stayed quiet and people would hug me and I'd hug back but inside I was just wishing everyone would leave me alone and stop touching and talking to me so I could process this and figure out why I was so unsatisfied. After a while, we were on our way out and this sex crimes detective came up to me while I was standing alone in lobby and hugged me. Then I just kind of broke down. After a few minutes of crying on her shoulder (this was the first tear I had shed the entire time in court), we left and my mom and I started to head down 75 to my house but I was still just upset and again, I couldn't figure out or even explain why.

My mom kept asking me where I wanted to go and what I wanted to do and I just didn't even know. I was speechless and couldn't even think, decision making was beyond my capabilities at this time. So I just told her to keep driving and she did. I broke down again once we got to about 635 and was really struggling because I didn't know why I felt this way. I had desensitized myself to this long before it came time for trial and I was more than ready to take the stand against him. I was not afraid. It had been a long time since I had had a crying spell over this and here I was, balling, an unable to grasp the reason why. It was over! So I just stared out of my window, tears rolling down my face.

Then, the funniest thing happened.

This young guy (probably mid-late 20's) with a dark beard and dark hair drove by in a new, white Silverado and smiled really big at me, waved, and then sped off.

And I swear to God, it changed everything. I couldn't stop laughing and smiling, it was just so funny.

And now, I'm fine. I'm happy, I'm satisfied with what happened. I can't quite put my finger on why I felt the way that I did, but this guy just completely turned this dark emotion in me around and brightened up my day. 

I couldn't stop laughing and was so thankful that this random guy did something so little but something so big for me that I drew a big ""Thank you :)"" on note book paper and held it up to my window when we drove past him, then it was our turn to speed off.

This is another in a series of posts about severe weather impacting the North Dallas area. I hope it's informative and timely, but please comment to add information or ask questions. I'll be updating throughout the day.

----

**tl;dr**

Cold front moving in and triggering widespread storms, starting near the Red River and moving South and East as storms develop along the frontal boundary. 

MODERATE RISK for severe storms. Damaging wind, large hail, tornadoes, and lightning are the most likely hazards through midnight Tuesday. 

Specific threats:

* Tornado: 10% or greater probability of tornado event in and around the DFW area, with some areas at risk for EF2 - EF5 tornadoes (see [**tornado map**](http://www.spc.noaa.gov/products/outlook/day1probotlk_1300_torn.gif), hatched region has risk for larger tornadoes)
* Hail: 30-45% probability of hail one inch in diameter, with some areas at risk for hail in excess of 2 inches in diameter (see [**hail map**](http://www.spc.noaa.gov/products/outlook/day1probotlk_1300_hail.gif), hatched region has risk for larger hail)

**Maps**

* Multimedia briefing from NWS: **http://www.spc.noaa.gov/products/outlook/pwo.mp4**
* [**Hail Map**](http://www.spc.noaa.gov/products/outlook/day1probotlk_1300_hail.gif). Probability of one inch diameter hail or larger within 25 miles of a point. Hatched Area: 10% or greater probability of two inch diameter hail or larger within 25 miles of a point.
* [**Tornado Map**](http://www.spc.noaa.gov/products/outlook/day1probotlk_1300_torn.gif). Probability of a tornado within 25 miles of a point. Hatched Area: 10% or greater probability of EF2 - EF5 tornadoes within 25 miles of a point.
* [**Wind Map**](http://www.spc.noaa.gov/products/outlook/day1probotlk_1300_wind.gif). Probability of damaging thunderstorm winds or wind gusts 50 knots or greater (~57 mph).

If you want to read the latest forecast from NWS, which is thoroughly *not* tl;dr, see the SPC's [**Public Severe Weather Outlook**](http://www.spc.noaa.gov/products/outlook/pwo.html) (PWO) and the current [**NWS Hazardous Weather Outlook**](http://forecast.weather.gov/product.php?site=FWD&amp;product=HWO&amp;issuedby=FWD&amp;version=1&amp;format=CI&amp;glossary=1) discussion. 

----

**Stay Informed**

Reminder: the main NWS page is a great place to go for up-to-date watch and warning information. They even have a [twitter account](https://twitter.com/#!/FTWmet) that you can follow to get quick alerts. You should *also* [follow the hashtags #txwx and #dfwwx](https://twitter.com/search?q=%23txwx%20OR%20%23dfwwx) on Twitter for lots of different discussions about severe weather today. You don't have to be on twitter to click the link and read posts.

**Get ready!**

Severe weather does not discriminate, and is not something to take lightly. Being prepared ahead of time is the best thing for you, your family, and pets. At the very least, have a plan. 

Check out these pages now (if you're on Reddit, you're already not working. Take 10 minutes right now to review these pages):

**UPDATES**

* *@10:49*: **TORNADO WATCH** issued for 49 counties in North Central Texas, including all of DFW area. More info: **http://inws.wrh.noaa.gov/weather/alertinfo/10490124**

* *@12:57*: Many schools around the DFW metroplex are opting for early release. WFAA is keeping a list of closings here: **http://www.wfaa.com/weather/closings/**

* *@14:15*: Sorry for the slow update; we've activated our EOC and I had to move all of my stuff to another room. Back now.

* *@14:19*: **SEVERE THUNDERSTORM WARNING** has been issued for all/part of Denton, Dallas, Collin, Fannin, and Tarrant Counties. Hail and damaging winds are the primary threats. 

* *@14:42*: Primary reports for big four DFW counties have been heavy rain and high wind gusts (60-75 mph around Denton). As storms develop further East, supercell thunderstorm activity may increase.

* *@14:55*: **AERIAL FLOOD ADVISORY** issued for Dallas County. High water on major roadways, such as I-35E, will create hazards for motorists. Do not drive into standing water of unknown depth.

* *@15:27*: Over 11,000 customers without power in the DFW area. Crews already working to restore.

* *@15:32*: Tornado Watch canceled for western counties. Here's where the watch was canceled: http://inws.wrh.noaa.gov/weather/alertinfo/10502104

* *@16:04*: Primary threat in main DFW area is now traffic and flooding in low-lying areas. Drive safely going home. Storm threats continue to our East.

* *@16:05*: Storms near Waco and Commerce (distinct areas) are continuing to develop. Residents of McLennan, Bosque, Bell, and Hunt counties should keep monitoring local news and weather reports.

* *@16:10*: [NOT DFW] Tornado Warnings and tornadoes on the ground in CT and NY. Same line of storms, extending all the way up to Massachusetts. 

* *@16:34*: We're standing down, so I'm going to pack up. Good trial-run for everyone in DFW again, thankfully didn't produce anything major. With the past 10 days of storms in Texas &amp; Oklahoma, you can't be too sure. Stay safe out there, and I'll make a new post this storm season if anything's imminent.

We tried for about a month to buy a (used) car there and it was a horrible experience. Sales people not returning phone calls, being put on indefinite hold when calling the main number, etc. At one point they tried to sell us a car that had some sort of mold problem and smelled HORRIBLE. They tried and tried to sell it to us and insisted the smell would go away. We refused and a week later when we went back they admitted that it still smelled terrible.

Obviously we should have stayed away. Unfortunately, they had the exact car we were looking for (for our business) at a good price and we needed to get it done. So we finally just walked in one day and forced them to sell it to us. 

That's where things went from bad service to, I think, fraudulent. We took a finance letter from our bank to the dealer with us. The finance manager tried to have us sign some blank documents, but we insisted that they fill them out and include our bank name. He did, we signed and drove away. Then a week later we get a call from another bank telling us they had our auto loan. When I called the dealer (after being put on indefinite hold twice, the third time insisting they find me a live person right away) the guy was belligerent, told me that they could finance with whoever they wanted, etc. When I told him my contact specifically named my bank, he didn't believe me and told me to come in and show him the paperwork. Unbelievable. Finally, he told me he would have to do some research and would call me back in 20 minutes. Would anyone like to guess if I got that call back? Ha ha.

Go to Nissan of McKinney at your own risk. If you can fight through the horrible service, they can't be trusted to honor a signed contract.",,False,self,t5_2qnkr,False,,,True,t3_1516pl,http://www.reddit.com/r/Dallas/comments/1516pl/nissan_of_mckinney_stay_away/,

I'm a sucker for unlimited grilled meats.

First off, the place was dirty.  The vinyl chairs had years of other people's sweat accumulated into a dark crust.  WTF, we're adventurous, so we didn't let that scare us away.  We headed to the (very limited) salad bar, only to find browned lettuce, floppy broccoli, old tomatoes, old cucumbers, some bleh pasta salad, instant mashed potatoes, black beans with pieces of unused meat in it, and some white sticky rice.  We were starting to get quite disappointed, but I was still giddy about the unlimited grilled meats.

So, we sit down and flip our cards to the green side, to signal that we were ready for the meats.  First guy brings over some beef, and offers it to us, ""Either of you care for medium-well sirloin steak?""

Medium-well?  Well, not really...but since he was the first to come by, we each got a small piece.  It was not even close to medium-well.  The well done pieces of meat turned into particle board, as they sat on our plates.  Next guy brings around some bacon-wrapped chicken.  NOW WE'RE TALKING!!!  

Nope.  The bacon was only cooked on two opposing sides, while the chicken was very over cooked.  Worse though, it all tasted like it had been soaking in a brine, overnight.  Over salted and seasoned to hell.  Even the bacon flavor was killed by the amount of seasonings they put on it.

They bring more bullshit by, but none of it was anywhere close to what I can serve up (drunk off my ass) from my own grill.  It was all overcooked, bad pieces of meat, and seasoned horribly.  The sausage tasted like licorice, and the BBQ they glazed the pork loin in was more like jelly, and definitely not a taste you want in your mouth.  Incredibly disappointing experience.  In fact, the only thing that my wife and I could agree was good, was the little pieces of grilling cheese that they served like it was bread.

So now I'm back at work, contemplating purging my stomach contents.  I'm really not a food snob, but that place should be avoided, at all costs.  I feel violated.  If they offered me a rib eye, for free, I'd turn it down.

**Edited to add:** I forgot to mention that after we ordered drinks, the waiter informed me that internet coupons are only good during dinner.  So, if you still want to try this place, I'll gladly give you my Groupon, good for $30 in dinner, there.",,False,self,t5_2qnkr,1337976578.0,,,True,t3_u4wjx,http://www.reddit.com/r/Dallas/comments/u4wjx/brazilian_cowboy_i_ate_there_so_you_dont_have_to/,

Walked into Liberty Tax and asked for a price up front. Was told they are unable to give me a price until they looked over my W-2. Handed the lady my W-2, was asked 4 or 5 questions, and in 5 minutes she had my simple form ready. She then told me it will be $209.00. I was shocked they wanted to charge me this much. Told her I had gone to other tax places for a lot less during my previous years. Told the lady no. She said wait just a minute, let me get my manager and see if she can bring the price down. She brings over her manager and one other person. So I had three people standing in front of me asking why I don't want to pay $209.00. Was told that if I can't afford the $209.00, they can subtract it from my refund check. Said no. They then tell me that if I walk out right now, it will be an additional $50.00 ($259.00 total) if I decide to come back or go to one of their other location. Still said no. They tried to make me feel guilty for taking up their time to prepare my taxes, which was only 5 minutes. Later that day, I went to a different location thinking the location I just went to was just bad business with bad employees. Even the 2nd Liberty Tax location did the exact same thing as well as quoted me the same price of $209.00.

He found out he has pancreatic cancer and flew to Florida a couple weeks ago to check a few things off his bucket list.  On his way back to San Diego he had some medical issues and is now in the hospital in Dallas and probably wont make it home.  I have no idea what part of Dallas he is in, (they are supposed to move him to a different hospital tonight) and I'm using the last of my money to get there, so if you guys have any suggestions on cheap rental cars, cheap places to eat, or even cheap flowers to buy I would really appreciate it.  I am basically doing this blind, in the hopes of seeing my dad before he passes so if anyone in Dallas has any hookups it could mean the world to me and my dad.  Thank you guys in advance! :)

[Here is a picture of my dad.](https://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/MNgqW5DkoOc1ia0sDMXp-5VZ80Gfkwn3kh806C9ioAw?feat=directlink)  He was a Marine F-4 Phantom fighter pilot.  He is also the greatest man I know.

**MY SCHEDULE (so far)**

* Flight 1846 - Depart SAN DIEGO CA (SAN) at 1:30 PM / Arrive in AUSTIN TX (AUS) at 6:15 PM
* Flight 2988 - Change planes in AUSTIN TX (AUS) at 7:40 PM / Arrive in DALLAS LOVE FIELD (DAL) at 8:40 PM
* Being picked up at the airport by **utahz**, gonna grab a burger then head to the hospice.
* I think Im also meeting **Synamin** at the airport too.
* I flew home on Saturday with my mom and my dad.

**UPDATE:** I just got a text from my mom.  They are moving him to a hospice at 2425 Texas drive in Irving, TX. 75062.  I am sorry if this isnt near Dallas, all I know is that my mom and dad had these problems begin at the Dallas airport during a layover so this is the first place I thought to ask.

**UPDATE 2:** I should be landing at Dallas Love Field at about 8:30pm on the 15th.  According to Google Maps I shouldnt be more than 12 miles away from where hes at so I can probably just walk since I will only be bringing a backpack.

**UPDATE 3:** I fly in on flight 2988 which is a connecting flight from flight 1846.  My info is BrandenK(at)gmail.com and my google phone number is 858-877-3577.  I didnt want to give this away initially but I could really care less at this point.

**UPDATE 4:** I am absolutely blown away by the responses I am getting and if you contacted me I apologize but I will get back to you soon.  I have been overwhelmed with responses and I have a lot to deal with but I assure you no gesture is going unnoticed.  I have shared this thread with my dad and mom and according to my mom, my dad keeps breaking out in tears because of all your support.  Keep being awesome reddit, its making my dad happier than I have seen him in weeks.  Honestly all he cares about is knowing that my mom and I are supported, with all these responses he has no choice but to realize he is leaving us in good hands.

**UPDATE 5:** Rough night but I did get some sleep.  Im just getting dog sitters lined up and getting the house clean to keep my mind off things.  One project left to do but I wont get it done in time so maybe one of you guys can help me?  http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/kejmp/i_know_its_random_but_can_any_of_you_make_an/

**UPDATE 6:** Im in Austin waiting on my layover.  I was told to try some Amy's Ice Cream so thats where I am headed next.  I may not get a chance to update once I get to Dallas but I will check in with you guys by tomorrow.  THANK YOU again to everyone from the bottom of my heart.

My attorney asked for time served in lieu of the court costs of $74 and the judge refused that as well. My attorney and I will be appealing this to the county court now based on principle alone. We will subpoena the city manager as well as others on the city council.    
         
I refuse to lay down and just take what the city is doling out. I do not think they had any right to evict us from the park and I will fight it to the end.

EDIT:  For any and all who are interested, my attorney is Daniel Sullivan and his office number is 469-547-1168.

The first gentleman was on his way home from a shift at NTTA. He blocked traffic with his own personal vehicle and put on a roadway vest to make sure we were visible, and tried to help us get out of our car. He stayed with us until the firefighters and police arrived. Another gentleman witnessed the accident and in true Texas fashion, proceeded to chase the individual who caused the accident down three exits, and forced him to return to the scene. I am truly thankful for these two individuals, and many of the others who stopped and asked if we were okay.

-----

Hi /r/dallas folks.

I work in the emergency management office for a county in the area, and I wanted to share the email I sent to our office (and is being sent to all county employees soon) concerning weather this afternoon/evening.

**TL,DR: Take it seriously, and watch the news**

Here's the email:

&gt;Hi folks,

&gt;After speaking with [local ham/weather guy] about today’s weather, he would like me to relay that everyone should **take the weather situation today seriously**. The National Weather Service (NWS) has moderately-high confidence that the area will see very severe storms with the possibility for one or more tornados in addition to very large hail and damaging winds. [The area] is currently under a Tornado Watch until 10:00pm.

&gt;There’s not enough information yet to forecast the situation for our particular area in North Texas, but the NWS has posted **severe weather safety tips** on its main forecast product page. This, alone, should highlight the importance of keeping vigilant and keeping eyes to the skies tonight.

&gt;Main weather watches and warnings are here: http://www.srh.noaa.gov/fwd/

&gt;A graphic warning page is here (my preferred page): http://www.srh.noaa.gov/fwd/gwarn/data.php?file=nwswarning

&gt;We will be having our Personal Disaster Preparedness (PDP) training tomorrow afternoon for the office, but tonight would be the perfect night to make sure your emergency documents are ready and you and your family have an emergency plan. I’ve also ~~attached~~ [reddit: [tips are here (PDF)](http://www.srh.noaa.gov/images/fwd/pdf/safety_rules_lists.pdf)] the severe weather safety tips PDF that the NWS has posted.

&gt;I’ll forward more iNWS products throughout the night as well, and will be monitoring the situation on the inevitable ham radio weather net (probably on 147.18, for those with a radio).

Stay safe!

IronRectangle

P.s. any WX hams on /r/dallas?

----

**EDIT 1 [@1620]** Weather Channel twitter is providing some updates on Oklahoma tornados: http://twitter.com/#!/TWCBreaking

**EDIT 2 [1942]** Storms moving into the area right now have history of **SOFTBALL-SIZED HAIL** and damaging winds. Tornado production is still possible and moderately likely. IF YOU ARE OUTSIDE, SEEK SOLID SHELTER SOON.

**EDIT 3 [1959]** Thanks to the mods for putting this on the front page of /r/dallas. We should maybe make this a habit.

**EDIT 4 [2007]** TORNADO WARNING issued for Collin County. Tornados spotted in Denton county and cloud lowering/tornado spotted near Frisco. **SEEK SHELTER IMMEDIATELY**

**EDIT 5 [2015]** Tornado spotted on the ground in [Bedford](http://maps.google.com/maps?q=bedford,+tx&amp;amp;amp;um=1&amp;amp;amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;amp;amp;hq=&amp;amp;amp;hnear=0x864e7fa7086a3063:0x4144003e8e64d247,Bedford,+TX&amp;amp;amp;gl=us&amp;amp;amp;ei=XljcTZmwEI2cgQeb78AG&amp;amp;amp;sa=X&amp;amp;amp;oi=geocode_result&amp;amp;amp;ct=image&amp;amp;amp;resnum=1&amp;amp;amp;ved=0CCsQ8gEwAA), moving east at 40mph.

**EDIT 6 [2016]** Sirens going off in Plano/Allen. FYI to everyone: sirens are meant to say ""get inside and turn on a TV,"" so it's okay if you can't hear them from inside your house. Continue to monitor a local TV or radio station.

**EDIT 7 [2021]** For anyone interested, you can listen to local police radio (usually main dispact channel) online here: [Collin County](http://www.radioreference.com/apps/audio/?ctid=2565) and [Dallas County](http://www.radioreference.com/apps/audio/?ctid=2579)

**EDIT 8 [2039]** Additional lowering wall clouds and rotation spotted near Frisco moving East. Cell arriving at US-75 within 15 minutes.

**EDIT 9 [2056]** Collin County Tornado Warning has expired, but warnings are still active for Tarrant and Dallas counties. All cells should still be considered dangerous until dissipated. 

**EDIT 10 [2142]** Additional warnings being issued for counties in the region following the rapid development of a line of storms, running SW--&gt;NE from Weatherford up to Oklahoma. Dallas Tornado Warning just reissued until 2230. Storm moving into Collin county soon, expecting more hail and lots of wind at least.

**FINAL EDIT [2306]** Alright, time for bed for me. Thanks everyone for sharing your photos, stories and video. Hopefully everyone is okay and there was minimal damage to our region, but I know Oklahoma was not so lucky. We'll get the full recap on tomorrow's news.

I have a Wii that I never play. It's black, in great condition (been played maybe twice) and comes with 2 wiimotes, nunchucks and some games. I still have the box and even the receipt.

Would love to give it to a family in need for the holidays rather than sell it on CL or back to Gamestop.

If you're interested please send me a PM with some info. Not trying to make this a contest or anything but would really like some background on why I should give the Wii to you, I don't want to give it to some troll pretending to be needy so they can get a free Wii out of it.

Thanks.


EDIT:

Ok. So this has become a Wii-Drive! We have 2 more Wiis to give away to needy families. I already found mine a happy new home. 

If you have a Wii you would like to donate or would like to request a Wii, please PM me and I will get you in touch with the right person. 

I'm currently at work and have a hard time updating this from my phone but i'll be responding asap. 

This is awesome.

WE HAVE 1 Wii LEFT!

She found a car she liked and drove it around, saw a few minor problems and told the dealership. They ""fixed"" the problems and a few days later she bought the car.

The car was just over $5,000 along with the nearly $2,000 warranty (offered by the dealership, but it's a cars.com warranty). About a week later the check engine light came on, she contacted the dealership and was told the only place that the warranty covered repairs at was a shady mechanic named ""Martin"". This guy was completely unprofessional and after a few hours told us that some filters needed to be replaced along with a few leak repairs or something and that it wasn't covered by the warranty. The cost was $300 and my mother paid it.

Two weeks after that (a few days ago) the check engine light came on again along with some weird engine noises. This time my mother took it to a trusted mechanic that found a slew of major problems with for grand total of over $1,000 in repairs needed.

These repairs also aren't covered by the warranty, and the dealership won't help even though a quick search finds many people who have also bought cars from them only to have them break down. (See [dealerrater](http://www.dealerrater.com/dealer/International-Motor-Productions-review-23187/) (IMP's old address is listed), [cardealercheck](http://www.cardealercheck.com/dealer/40785.html), [yelp](http://www.yelp.com/biz/international-motor-productions-carrollton), [kudzu](http://www.kudzu.com/m/International-Motor-Productions-20659937) and [this article](http://consumerist.com/2008/11/international-motor-productions-screws-reader-over-500-deposit-on-misrepresented-wrecked-bmw.html).) I wish my mother would have checked out this fraudulent company before buying from them!

1366041827.0,68,self.Dallas,1ce8u5,My roommates daughter was suspended from school for being too quiet...,79,11,43,http://www.reddit.com/r/Dallas/comments/1ce8u5/my_roommates_daughter_was_suspended_from_school/,"So this is a crazy sounding situation. My roommate has a five year old daughter that attends a private elementary school in north dallas. She's a pretty shy kid. I've only interacted with her a handful of times, and she is a still a bit timid around me. Not as bad as the first time I met her though. She lives with his mother as he works two jobs, but we don't live far away. He takes care of all her expenses and still sees her often.

Here's where it gets weird. She was suspended from school for being too quiet. My roommate told me the school cited some sort of safety issue that was outlined in some handbook. I've asked him to bring me a copy and find out exactly what they are referring to. 
From what he told me about his meeting with the principal, she is so quiet they wouldn't be able to tell if she is hurt. 

He told me she has friends that she talks about when she comes home from school. So it isn't like she doesn't speak to anyone, she is just quiet. And she is learning just as well as the other kids, so being shy hasn't affected her education. 

I am of the opinion that her teachers get frustrated with her shyness and quiet nature, and she takes that negatively. I'm still trying to gather more information on the situation, but to me it seems like the teachers haven't made an effort to try and earn her trust. 

Now what I'm interested in is, can a school do that? Suspend a kid for being too quiet/shy? He's pulled her out of school already. This incident happened last week, so it has been a few days. He is going over to where his daughter lives tomorrow and I will update with more information as I get it. I just don't understand the school's reasoning on suspending a kid that is too quiet. Can anyone offer any insight or help on this?

TL;DR
Roommate's daughter got suspended from school for being too quiet/shy. School cites some handbook, safety nonsense. She's a normal kid with friends and has no learning disabilities. More info coming as I get it, anyone have any thoughts?

Edit: Took off where she goes to school. Trying to protect his identity because he didn't ask me to do this.

Edit 2: So after talking about all this with him and his mother, he's decided to just move on from the situation. He'd rather not bring any unnecessary attention to his kid and doesn't find it to be ""that big of a deal"". He did tell me she was suspended for be ""defiant and rude"", but also said she doesn't talk much to the other kids, but plays just fine. He's in the process of getting her enrolled in another school. He was shocked so many people would be concerned though so thank you guys for the help and support.

With storm season starting up, I will be posting more regularly on upcoming weather in our area. This is another in a series of posts about severe weather impacting the North Dallas area.

----

**tl;dr (preemptive)**

* Flooding, hail, and wind damage remain most likely hazards through midnight Monday. 10% chance of isolated tornado event in and around the DFW area (see [tornado map](http://www.spc.noaa.gov/products/outlook/day1probotlk_1300_torn.gif) and [hail map](http://www.spc.noaa.gov/products/outlook/day1probotlk_1300_hail.gif)).
* Monday afternoon/evening: frontal boundary moving in from the West, rather slowly. Two rounds of severe storms are anticipated for our area. 
* After Midnight &amp; all day Tuesday: excessive rainfall, with peak areas of flash flooding receiving 6"" or more. A [flash flood watch](http://forecast.weather.gov/wwamap/wwatxtget.php?cwa=fwd&amp;wwa=flash%20flood%20watch) is in effect. 

**Maps**

* Multimedia briefing from NWS: http://www.srh.noaa.gov/media/fwd/20120319/player.html
* [Hail Map](http://i.imgur.com/TXUkT.png). Probability of one inch diameter hail or larger within 25 miles of a point. Hatched Area: 10% or greater probability of two inch diameter hail or larger within 25 miles of a point.
* [Tornado Map](http://i.imgur.com/y0mSh.png). Probability of a tornado within 25 miles of a point. Hatched Area: 10% or greater probability of EF2 - EF5 tornadoes within 25 miles of a point.
* [Rain Map](http://www.srh.noaa.gov/images/fxc/fwd/graphicast/image_full2.gif). 

If you want to read the latest forecast from NWS, which is thoroughly *not* tl;dr, see the SPC's [Public Severe Weather Outlook](http://www.spc.noaa.gov/products/outlook/pwo.html) (PWO) and the current [NWS Hazardous Weather Outlook](http://forecast.weather.gov/product.php?site=FWD&amp;product=HWO&amp;issuedby=FWD&amp;version=1&amp;format=CI&amp;glossary=1) discussion. 

**Stay Informed**

Reminder: the main NWS page is a great place to go for up-to-date watch and warning information. They even have a [twitter account](https://twitter.com/#!/FTWmet) that you can follow to get quick alerts. You should *also* [follow the hashtag #txwx](https://twitter.com/#!/search/%23txwx) for lots of different discussions about severe weather today.

----

**Finally, get ready!** Severe weather does not discriminate, and is not something to take lightly. Being prepared ahead of time is the best thing for you, your family, and pets. At the very least, have a plan.

1318885023.0,60,self.Dallas,lfj45,"[Dallas] Cold front coming in tonight (Monday). Some chance of severe weather, much higher chance of cooler temps (more inside)",71,11,34,http://www.reddit.com/r/Dallas/comments/lfj45/dallas_cold_front_coming_in_tonight_monday_some/,"[*somehow got the whole post doubled on itself...fixed now*]

I've posted on here a handful of times about weather coming our way, and I thought I'd make it a regular occurrence. I'll update this post if conditions warrant it.

----

**Short Term**: Monday night, around 19:00 (depending on your location) we'll start feeling a cold front come in from the Northwest. National Weather Service (NWS) is predicting rain at least, with the potential for strong to marginally severe thunderstorms. This risk increases North of I-20. The ""real"" rain/thunderstorm chances will come a few hours later (currently predicted to start around 23:00).

The risk for severe thunderstorms extends into the early morning hours of Tuesday. After that, the area will see strong winds persisting for about 36 hours (winds of ~15-20 mph, possible gusts over 30 mph). No foretasted precipitation after Tuesday morning.

**Hazards**: Potential for large hail, some thunderstorms may produce winds in excess of 60 mph.

**Storm spotters**: Trained NWS Storm Spotter activation may occur tonight, particularly in areas north of Interstate 20.

**Resources**: Keep these sites up in your browser whenever weather is in the area:

* National Weather Service, DFW (main page): http://www.srh.noaa.gov/fwd/
* NWS Composite Radar for DFW (loop, about 90 minutes of historical data): http://radar.weather.gov/ridge/radar.php?product=NCR&amp;rid=FWS&amp;loop=yes
* Static radar, plus watch and warning polygons overlaid (NWS and NCTCOG). Click ""Dynamic Map"" underneath the map for a better view: http://www.srh.noaa.gov/fwd/gwarn/data.php?file=nwswarning
* I've always liked this nice, concise graphical hazard planner: http://www.srh.noaa.gov/fwd/hazard/haz.php?loc=nort&amp;dow=TODAY

----

If you've got any questions let me know, and I'll update this as forecasts change. I'm going to have an eye on the entire four-county DFW region, but focusing on Collin County a bit more (my home jurisdiction).

**EDIT 1@ 20:22**: *Significant Weather Advisory* issued for Wise and Denton Counties ([polygon and text here](http://forecast.weather.gov/showsigwx.php?warnzone=TXZ103&amp;warncounty=TXC121&amp;firewxzone=TXZ103&amp;local_place1=5+Miles+NNW+Krum+TX&amp;product1=Special+Weather+Statement)). This is about a step lower than ""severe"" and is sometimes a precursor to a Severe Thunderstorm *Watch* or *Warning*. Looks okay now, though.


**EDIT 2@ 20:47**: *Severe Thunderstorm Warning* [issued for Denton Co](http://www.srh.noaa.gov/fwd/gwarn/data.php?file=warnprofile&amp;msgid=KFWD.SV.0527_2011&amp;t=74414)., expiring 21:30. Timing (from advisory):

    * SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS WILL BE NEAR... FLOWER MOUND AND CORINTH AROUND
    835 PM... LEWISVILLE AND LAKE DALLAS AROUND 840 PM... PILOT POINT AND LAKE
    LEWISVILLE AROUND 845 PM... PRECAUTIONARY/PREPAREDNESS ACTIONS...
    FOR YOUR PROTECTION MOVE TO A STURDY SHELTER UNTIL THE STORM HAS PASSED.

**EDIT 3@ 20:55**: NWS activated spotters in Collin County, no advisories issued yet. Weather service advising that storm moving from Denton are travelling East at 45 mph, now expected to produce pea-sized hail and wind gusts up to 55 mph. Losing a bit of their ""punch"" as they put it.

**EDIT 4@ 21:16**: *Severe Thunderstorm Warning* [issued for Dallas County and West Tarrant Counties](http://www.srh.noaa.gov/fwd/gwarn/data.php?file=warnprofile&amp;msgid=KFWD.SV.0528_2011&amp;t=76346). Advisory states:

    * At 908 PM CDT... National Weather Service Meteorologists Detected A Line Of Severe
    Thunderstorms Capable Of Producing Damaging Winds In Excess Of 60 Mph. These Storms
    Were Located Along A Line Extending From Farmers Branch To Near Lake Arlington To 7 Miles
    West Of Crowley... And Moving East At 50 Mph.  

**EDIT 5@ 21:22**: Tons of lightning, rain and wind here at my fixed location, but nothing severe within reporting criteria. About 250 lightning strikes (in-cloud and cloud-to-ground) within about 10 miles of my location. So, lots.

**EDIT 6@ 21:29**: Single report of hail (&gt;0.75 in.) lasting at least 5 minutes in ~~Northern~~ Southern Collin County. No other reports within criteria right now. Anyone else want to report something? Leave it below with your location.

**EDIT 7@ 21:34**: Just South of Denton (City), there's a cell developing a bit. Not sure how long it'll last, but we'll watch it.

**EDIT 8@ 21:43**: NWS monitoring Denton cell and more cells developing to the Northwest, checking with forecasters to see if they could be severe. *ninjaedit:* Denton cell looks benign, just rain/lightning. Checking on Dallas forecast.

**EDIT 9@ 12:54**: Spotters in Collin deactivated for the time being (pending more weather inbound). Dallas &amp; Tarrant *Severe Thunderstorm Warning* still in effect, line a little more than halfway through Dallas now. Updates to polygons and advisories, with overlaid radar, here: http://www.srh.noaa.gov/fwd/gwarn/data.php?file=nwswarning

**EDIT 10@ 22:26**: All has been quiet for a bit, but a new cell/line is developing to the Northwest of the DFW region. This, as before, could pose a hail threat. See NWS main page for radar and polygon warnings (the map below the black one): http://www.srh.noaa.gov/fwd/

**EDIT 11@ 22:49**: I'm about to go to bed, barring being woken up by the weather alert noise in a bit. There's a cell coming through the DFW area right now, but NWS hasn't put out any advisories, watches, or warnings associated with it. Check this link for updates to that at any point in the future: http://www.srh.noaa.gov/fwd/gwarn/data.php?file=nwswarning

Radar looks like this will be the last of the major stuff for the evening, maybe more rain through 0300-0400 but we'll see.

My girlfriend and I found them on the 28th in the park by the rec center in Cedar Hill.  Posters are up, but we fear the owners dumped them there.  We adore them, but have never really been interested in keeping dogs.  In any case, we could not leave them... they followed us close by every inch of the way back home :)

We took them to Petmobile for inoculations and a checkup and got them lots of treats and chews.  We are ~~hoping~~ insisting someone will adopt them together as a pair; they have spent their lives together so far and rely on each other for guidance and support.  Hopefully whomever adopts them  can help us with what we've spent on them so far, as we have dipped into savings and have 3 cats to provide for who we love dearly.  The cats are braving the living room to observe them from close by, but we would like to put them in another loving home before all 7 of us become too dearly attached to each other.

** update: Three boys claiming to be the owners of the dogs we found came by, but had never taken the dogs to the vet, had no plans to ever, and no comprehension of what illnesses dogs can get. We told them that was unacceptable and they got testy. Cops were called.

Along the way he saw a homeless man that is well known in the community asking for change for food. This man does not drink, and normally works for what money he has. My husband decided to go ahead and get a burger for him, and just as he was handing it over a police officer pulled up. He told my husband, ""It's now illegal to feed the homeless since it promotes loitering, panhandling, and other petty crimes. If I catch you trying to feed them again, I can give you a $150 ticket for each person you fed and a minimum of 24 hrs in jail."". 

My husband tried to give him the burger anyway, ticket be damned, and the homeless man refused. He didn't want my husband to get in trouble on his behalf. This is a self post, so no Karma whoring for me. I just would like for this to get some exposure so we can make some changes. It's understandable for it to be illegal to set up an unlicensed food kitchen, but being threatened over one thing for one person is deplorable.

I am heart broken I can't keep him but he needs a home where he can be watched over more closely. I work about 12 hours a day and can't take care of him like I should. He cried when I left today. :( 


ETA: Not my dog. Just wanted to save him and take care of his medical bills. I will foster him until I find a forever home. Will NOT leave him at a shelter. Not an option. I will love him until a better pet parent can care for him.

Please, if anyone lives in dallas, and will open their hearts and home to this sweet timid baby, please PM me.


UPDATE: He is feeling better. Limping now, but is mobile. He is resting nicely, and we are watching him as much as we can. Pic: http://imgur.com/KMVzGzz


Thank you to all who care so much about animals. After witnessing people honk at us for stopping to help him, our faith in humanity is restored!! Thank you.



UPDATE 3/28/13: He is doing much better!! He is limping around and is getting around nicely with less pain. I guess he has really bonded to us and doesn't want to be away from us. He is our little satellite.

For those asking about size weight breed etc. I think he is a beagle mix, he is a medium small dog (size of a beagle, larger than a chihuahua, smaller than most dogs), he must weigh under 30 pounds by my estimate.

My SO is stuck in Lubbock, Texas for work and until she can fulfill her duties here, she's homesick in a very bad way. Her birthday was coming up, so I decided to treat her to dinner from her favorite restaurant, [Venezia](http://www.veneziaitaliancafe.us/). BTW, try it some time, it's the shit. Audelia and Centennial in Richardson.

I went for a very long shot and posted [a request on this sub](http://www.reddit.com/r/Dallas/comments/19iblq/anyone_in_dfw_especially_richardson_want_to_help/). Unbelievably, more than one person answered saying they would help out! I replied to a few just to be sure I had a backup plan (and a backup backup plan), but in the end [this guy](http://www.reddit.com/user/chavalin) sounded most committed and had the least distance to travel.

A few emails and quick decisions later, I had [this](http://i.imgur.com/bW5nUaS.jpg) sitting on my counter - overnight shipped in dry ice in a mini cooler. It was in REALLY good shape, considering how it got to me. In fact, it was still very cold to the touch and had an ice crystal or two in the center.

I did have to re-heat (for those curious, I ordered her the tortellini pomodoro and the tortellini modo mio, both delicious) via a saute pan and a little cream (for the cream sauce) and a little purified water (for the tomato sauce). I slowly re heated the bread as well (their bread is the shit) at 250 for about fifteen minutes and it came out crispy and wonderful.

Sadly, I have no photos of my SO's reaction. She works as a critical care nurse and, as you might imagine, they are a little touchy about photos.

So, yeah, this whole thread is here basically to say /r/dallas is a really cool community and [this dude](http://imgur.com/wi6eb4s) in particular is awesome. If we were in prison, I would totally protect everyone on /r/dallas in the showers.

**UPDATE 1:** At this point we are saying our final goodbyes and getting things ready for the trip back to San Diego.  I think we have things pretty well taken care of but I think the whole family could use a change of pace.  There are about 8 of us and we are going to go out to dinner tonight, any suggestions?  I think we want to make up for this bad Texas adventure so I think we need some good BBQ.

**UPDATE 2:** Someone suggested Hard 8?  Anyone have any feedback on that place?

**FINAL UPDATE:** My father just passed at 5:02pm.  We had the last family member arrive just 30 minutes before his last breath.  Because of whats going on I am not sure we will make it to dinner tonight.  Dallas thank you again for all the help!  For being stuck in a city other than my own, I cannot thank the people of Dallas enough for their hospitality and compassion, especially the nurses at the hospice.

We are headed to Hard 8 for a quick dinner.  If anyone buys a drink tonight please buy or have a black label johnnie walker in his honor.  I would like to thank MaverickTTT for the extra cash so I can do the same for him tonight.

I know this isn't your typical post, but I figured it's worth a shot. I'm over here on the east coast, but I'm trying to help a friend leave her abusive husband before he gets home from work today. She has no access to money, no car, and no where to go. I'm helping her look up shelters, but everywhere is full. So far we've tried the Genesis Shelter, Denton County Friends of Family, Hope's Door, Brighter Tomorrows, and a few others. Her phone died but she going to call the ones on the sidebar at r/DomesticViolence too.

Any advice? She's fucking terrified. Thanks for reading.

Super ninja edit! The emotional abuse is unbearable for her. She's terrified that he's going to start beating her. ""You can hear it in his voice."" He's also threatened to kill her and the cops let the guy go with his gun. And now, a lot of these places are turning her down because she isn't getting beaten. Again, any advice is welcome.

Suffice it to say that Dallas does not have streets overflowing with delicious barbacoa meat. I've been in Dallas for a few years now and am just now finding great places to find great tacos, and spreading the taco love is always a good thing!

If you've found any good taco stands/trucks/restaurants, please share with us. Good tacos are something that makes 45 minute drives worth it!

1. Chito's - Plano - http://www.yelp.com/biz/chitos-plano
2. El Grande Burrito - Allen - http://www.yelp.com/biz/el-grande-burrito-allen
3. Unnamed (in Jamal's Convinience Store) - Plano - http://www.yelp.com/biz/jamals-convenience-store-plano

What makes a good taco stand? There's usually a few good rules:

1. Accepts only cash
2. Lots of brown skin
3. Does not call itself 'tex-mex'

Chito's and Grande Burrito take credit, but hits the other two rules. Delicious food! 

I know about the Fuel City tacos but haven't been yet. On my next drive to Houston I'll be sure to make a detour.

Many of us are shocked and saddened by the death of Kidd Kraddick. To those of us who grew up here in Dallas, he was a friend. To anyone who listened to his show and knew about his charity, Kidd's Kids, he was a great and generous person. The best way I could think of to show my thanks to Kidd for the many memories and laughs was to donate to the cause that he was so passionate about. I set up a campaign on Fundly so that /r/Dallas as a community can give back to this man that had such a big heart.


The end date of the campaign is 8/10, as I didn't want to draw it out too long. Minimum donation was required to be $10. Obviously 100% of the donations will go directly to Kidd's Kids. I will submit proof promptly after the campaign is over. I know everyone can donate to Kidd's Kids online, and that's wonderful. I just thought that since we're a tight little group, we could do something collectively to show our love and support.

To all involved, especially Ohmega, THANK YOU SO MUCH for making this year such a success. To you guys that stayed overnight and helped to clean up this morning, you absolutely made my day. I expected to do a lot of work in the morning and you guys really put in an effort. 

Surprisingly, the marina didnt even have anything bad to say about us. They werent even aware of the ambulance or the police presence. 

So again, thanks to everyone who helped, donated and showed up. This was one for the books. 

Btw, I do have some lost and found items. I have 3 camp chairs, 3 pair of sunglasses and a microphone.

In addition to the free admission for 6, I get a free VIP booth (normally $200/hr) and a $50 bar tab (although it's BYOB, so that's for mixers) and ice and some other stuff.

Anyway, I just moved down here from Minneapolis shortly before the new year and don't know tons of people, so if any of you guys or gals want to join us you're more than welcome, as long as you meet these requirements:

* Be at least 21

* Have your own transportation

* Don't puke on things/start fights/pee on things.  Don't drink more than you can.  Don't get me wrong...I'll be getting wasted, but I don't start fights or puke or things like that.

It'd be nice if you liked strip clubs and getting dances...I'd like to let the club get *some* money...I just don't want much of it to be mine.  ;)

You can bring booze/beer if you want, but I have about 18 Leinenkugel's (Wisconsin beer) and some bottles, so you can just drink that if you want.

We'll be heading out there around midnight (they're open til 6 am).

For the second year in a row I am participating in a Stair Climb in Dallas at Fountain Place Building known as the [Big D Climb](http://llswa.convio.net/site/TR/Events/DallasBigClimb?team_id=47964&amp;pg=team&amp;fr_id=1270) or AKA...

**""*Why* would you do that to yourself??""**

Well... because a business I worked with asked me to be the point of contact for their partnership with the Leukemia &amp; Lymphoma Society. I happily obliged, and even offered to join in on the Climb on behalf of the business. 

I did so happily because my Step-Father, Mike (always hated that term as he is **very** much my parent) had Hairy Cell Leukemia roughly 15 years ago. He is a hard-working, caring, and earnest man and I want to honor him. 

I am overjoyed to report that he is in fine health now. However, Hairy Cell has a 93% mortality rate - if he'd had it 10 years earlier he most likely wouldn't have survived. The L&amp;LS makes a **huge** difference. Thousands of kids with leukemia are survivors today because of the research made possible by donations to L&amp;LS. 

Mike told my Mama that the worst part of his treatment was not the bone-marrow biopsies or incredible sickness after chemotherapy or the fear that he would soon die but that it was seeing the kids with leukemia in the waiting rooms. 

He said a parents face in that state was a terrible thing to behold.

I am on a mission to remove that look &amp; *I need your help.*

Last year I participated in the climb and built a small team to climb with me. I am ashamed to admit I did not raise any money further than my entrance fee. But this year will be different. This year my Mama and I are climbing together. This year I will make a difference in the fight against Blood Disease.

I will come down from my podium now and humbly ask:

Will you donate to my Leukemia &amp; Lymphoma Society fundraising team?

Any amount is acceptable &amp; all donors will be thanked personally.




**TL/DR: I am raising money for the advancement towards a cure of Blood Disease.

Thank you for updating your stock email response in regards to Dublin Dr Pepper! We'd like to welcome you to our 2 week occupation of your Facebook wall! As this is your first official acknowledgment of our very legitimate complaint with what your company has done to Dublin Dr Pepper, it's refreshing for us, as a community of your former customers, to know that the lack of our dollars over the past 14 days has put you on the defensive. We sincerely look forward to what the lack of those dollars will cause you to do over the coming days, weeks, and months.

Now, you're presenting us here with some very specific information. Information that you want us to have, that is painting you in a very positive light, and your 121 year predecessor in a rather negative light. You want us to believe, on faith, mostly, that Dublin Dr Pepper was in violation of an agreement in their practice of distributing outside of a certain six county area. But you know, we don't have access to a copy of that agreement, do we? We don't know that Dublin was bound to that area. All we know is that that area was Dublin's, and it appears that you really wanted it. Why would we, a group of consumers you've already lost, believe information we've already shown disagreement with, just because you decide to email it to us instead of serving it up in a legal complaint, as you did with Mr. Kloster. So please, go ahead and provide us that agreement. We'd love to see that language binding Dublin Dr Pepper to those six counties. We'll be here anyway, so we'll wait.

Now, we understand that Dublin Bottling Works will continue to make its fine, cane sugar products, including another Texas tradition based out of Waco, Big Red. And we've also been informed that you would co-opt Dublin Dr Pepper's consumer base by continuing production of cane sugar Dr Pepper from the Temple bottling plant. It will be called Heritage, and will keep the same sweetener. But the cane sugar wasn't what we were buying. And it wasn't what was keeping that small town of 3,800 thriving, or those 14 people in jobs. It was 121 years of history, tradition, and family-owned charm. It was a story. It was a legend, something you heard by word of mouth from a friend of a friend. At a party. From your college roommate, a new co-worker, or a family friend who has made the discovery before you. It was something special, that you couldn't purchase or obtain through legal action or settlement. It was a discovery, an experience, a treasure. It wasn't cane sugar, or Heritage. It was ours, and it was a community, as we're sure you are recognizing.

And the thing is, it still is a community. And here we are, 2 weeks later. Your stocks have fallen, and Dublin still hasn't had its history restored. You've changed your stock email, and Dublin still hasn't had its tradition restored. You have vowed to continue supporting Dr Pepper Days, and Dublin still cannot be shared with friends, family, or the otherwise uninitiated. And yet, here we are. We still aren't buying your products, we're still telling friends, family, and the otherwise uninitiated about what you've done, why you've done it, and we're still confused as to why you haven't apologized and made it right.

Here we are, Dr Pepper Snapple Group.

2 weeks is nothing, when compared to 121 years.

Sincerely,
A Former Pepper",,False,self,t5_2qnkr,False,,,True,t3_ovrxg,http://www.reddit.com/r/Dallas/comments/ovrxg/an_open_letter_to_dr_pepper_snapple/,

I'll be moving to the far North Dallas area at the end of July. I have epilepsy and I'm not able to drive. I noticed there are several bus stops around the area and I was wondering how the DART system is. I've never ridden on a bus system before and I was wondering how dependable it is as well as how far you can travel.

For example, I'll be living in far North Dallas but I may be getting a job in Carrollton or Garland. Would I be able to take the bus this far? Should I plan on a pretty long travel everyday?

Sorry for such a basic question, but I'm clueless when it comes to transit systems.
