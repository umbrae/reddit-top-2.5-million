Talent has nothing to do with it. Looks have nothing to do with it. Being local has nothing to do it with it. Being from LA has nothing to do with it. Finally, it is really unfair to blame the director for not casting you when the truth of the matter is, you may not be living up to what a director is really looking for.

So here I go, telling every aspiring lead actor why you are most likely getting past up when you are talented, have the right look and feel you can handle the role. This is how I and a number of independent directors I have been acquainted with all cast our movies. Much more of this comes from directors I have interviewed or worked with then my own experiences. But I have certainly incorporated this into how I cast my last movie.

1. Your experience matters more than talent

Let me say that again. Experience matters - more than talent. If I am shooting a feature, it is much more than the weekend bootcamp short films are. That may be a 100 meter dash, but a feature is a marathon that has broken the hearts of many stalwart wannbe’s when they realize it isn’t all fun and excitement.. It is common for people cast as leads to drop out when they get sick of sixteen hour days of what is mostly shear boredom followed by short burst of extreme energy. Not everyone can handle it. And if I am going to invest in a lead actor, I had better be sure as hell that person knows what they are getting into. You won’t sleep well, rather when you can. You’ll miss your kids/ girlfriend / husband / everyone. You’ll be pissed at someone on the set for some dumb reason, mostly because everyone is under stress and gets on everyone’s nerves. And you’ll have to be professional. So unless you have a few roles where you have come close, don’t expect being cast as a lead. Talent is easy to find. Talent that can hack the experience - that’s rare.

Solution - get more on set experience. Do a few small roles, then secondary roles. Most actors with few exceptions follow this route. Perform in a play that has a rigorous rehearsal and performance schedule. Then see if being a lead is what you really want.

2. You are about the glamour and fame of acting, not the craft

In short, you want to be famous, not a good actor. Everyone wants to be on the red carpet, to be rich and well known. Few really want to be great actors. You want to see yourself on the big screen, but not put in the endless hours to be outstanding as a performer. Great actors are not born, they spend years becoming great. They take classes, work with coaches and constantly improve. They gain new skills as actors of which there are countless. And the dirty secret of Hollywood is that even well know really famous actors have coaches (they can afford them). Actors will spend thousands on headshots to look super hot, but neglect taking a good scene study class. A pretty face tells me nothing about your skill. A good demo reel will give me a more complete picture. Too many actors are motivated by a need to validate their lives with the ego bump that comes with being the center of attention. Too few are motivated by the need to be recognized for their outstanding skill.

Solution - Take a class. Learn new skills. Make it your goal to constantly improve. Try being the best actor you can be, not the prettiest, the hottest, the coolest, the most glamorous.

3. You are virtually invisible online, in real life

You may have a Facebook Page, even a website with headshot and a resume. And of course, you may even have an IMDB page. But what have you done otherwise? If I am scoping an actor for a major role, I want to know they are going to be a solid acting asset which means, they will be a constant promotion machine for the movie I put them in. I want to see that they did an interview on the last movie they did. I want to know they talked with even local reporters. I want to see that they engaged blogs, fan sights and reviewers for better or for worse. I want to see an actor who goes to conventions, festivals and other screenings to hype their movies and sell autographed posters and DVDs. I want actors who love and admire their fans as much as they love themselves. In short, if I am going to invest in an actor for a lead, I expect they will invest back in my project in the form of publicity, social media and engaging appearances.

Solution - Make your voice about the current projects you are on. Make directors want you because you are more of an asset to the movie then just an actor - you are an engaging piece of walking advertisement that draws people in. That’s star power even on a small scale.

4. You lack personal branding

There are plenty of generic actors out there. There are plenty of pretty faces. Being hot, sexy, attractive is not a selling point to any serious director except the desperately lonely ones. And a true professional will only cast on that criteria when it suit’s the production. A better brand would be knowing and emphasizing your strengths. Are you funny, brand yourself as a comedic actor. Are you a hopeless romantic? Try for the romantic roles. And my personal favorite - the horror hipsters who love horror and make it their life’s work. Why is this important? If I am casting a comedy, I want actors who are going to appeal to the comedy going crowd. In a horror movie, there are plenty of overly specialized scream queens and horror monsters who cater to the fans of low budget blood and guts. If you can find what it is that you are perfect for, it is much easier to sell yourself. Don’t worry about being typecast - if you are worried, you are not a true actor. Real actors are happy to be working in any capacity and not tripped up by being labeled.

Solution - Be good at something. Find your type. Sell it. Feel free to challenge it, but if you don’t have a type to begin with, there’s nothing to challenge.

5. You are self serving and fail to serve the greater community

You talk about yourself constantly. Anytime you talk about anything else, it’s in the context of you and how it effects you. Worse, you whine about how everyone is ignoring you and how great you are. You just sent me a huge red flag that you feel your ego is bigger than our project and that’s the last thing I need. Perhaps if I thought your name was big enough for me to put up with you because you will pack theatres across the nation, I might think about investing time and money on you. I need team players. I need people who get that the movie isn’t about them even if they are in a lead role. And moreover, I want people that will get that they are in a strongly interrelated movie community that needs promotion from within and from the outside. So if you have no colleagues, friends, no other peoples work you can talk about or get excited about, you lost me. If you love movies, you love more than just your own.

Solution - Talk about, hype, post about, blog about - everyone other than yourself. If you worked with another great person, talk about them. Talk about your fellow actors, directors, crew. Build them up. If a colleagues movies is coming up, hype that too. Attend their movies, take an interest in their projects. Go to industry mixers, events and seminars. It’s not about you, it’s about the industry and how we are all doing collectively. If you want to talk about yourself, someone will ask - “So what are you working on?” You usually don’t have to wait very long for that question to pop up.

6. Your audition isn’t the only thing you will be chosen for.

The audition is a like a job interview. You could nail it. It could be the most awesome performance of your life. The decision doesn’t hinge on just that. Directors will look at your resume, just like any person who is deciding to employ someone. And just like in this modern world, expect that your potential director is going to Google your name and see what you are up to. Expect them to hunt for Youtube videos you are tagged in and possibly find you on social media. They will certainly look on IMDB and check out your website if you got one. If it’s public information, they can and will find it. Just like employers do now, they want to know everything about you when they cast you. So if you have some photos on Facebook of you doing stupid things or posts ranting about conspiracy theories, you might not get cast because your public image reflects right back onto the movie you are cast in. The absolute worst thing you can do, it bad mouth other people you worked with. If you did it in the past, chances are you will do it again and that just makes my team seem unprofessional and disorganized. Remember what I said about being a brand? If your brand is a liability, expect to be treated like one.

Solution - Know your privacy settings. Be aware that if it’s online, it’s public knowledge. If you have some embarrassing photos, take them down. Your political views can and do hurt your job prospects when they are extreme. Obsession with certain celebrities that are borderline stalking is also a big red flag. Trash talking others you worked with is unprofessional even when you feel wronged or that the other person deserves it.

So please do not blame directors for going out of town to get talent. It’s a business where the competition for roles is high and all of the above give a slight advantage over the next guy, who is most likely just as talented as you are. There may be a need for some big shot names from LA to plaster on the front of the DVD to insure sales, but there is also lots of room for the local actor who makes themselves an asset to the production above merely showing up and running lines.

**Few starting words**

So, you are a big movie/TV series fan and would like to be the part of it? Or you are more interested in theatre acting? Then my friend, you are on the right place and your journey starts here. Just one thing. I'm not a professional actor. I'm learning new things everyday and I don't know everything. *Don't worry, this post will be updated regularly!*


**But I don't have any talent at all!**


The first thing you must understand is that this won't happen overnight. **Acting is a craft!** What does it mean? It means that acting requires skill. In order to gain skill you must work everyday. There are few actors that were born with the supernatural talent, everyone else was in this position like you now.

**I'm too old!**

Are you 18/25/30/35/50 years old? 

*Yes, I'm too old for anything! Everybody started acting at primary school or high school.* 

Once again, nope. It's never too old to start with acting. Let's switch to real life example. Did you hear about actor named [Ken Jeong](http://reddit.com)?  Not? He is that guy from Community (Senior Chang) and Hangover (Leslie Chow, that Chinese gangster). What's his story? He got his medicine degree and started doing stand up comedy after that. The whole detailed story is on the Wikipedia page, so please read. 

There are more examples like Alan Rickman, Hugh Jackman and many, many more. Don't  be afraid about how old are you! Maybe you are the next Godfather or Gandalf. There are many parts for older people too, so please, don't quit.

**Take a class/workshop**

As I mentioned before, you need to work everyday. The best thing is to take a class. The problem here is that we live everywhere. Most of the redditors here are from USA or Canada so I'll more focus on that area. *I'm not from this area, so please if you have any suggestions post them in the comments!*

*But there's no acting classes in my area. I live in a small village with 20 people. What should I do?*

Well my friend, there are two options for you. First one, is to think about moving to a larger city. I know it's a big thing, but go slow. Try to save some money. Your first TO-DO is to find place to stay and a job. Try to get familiar with your new job and new way of life before attending acting classes. Your second option is to work alone at home. I recommend this only while you are working and saving some money to move to a larger city. Read plays, act, record yourself and review it. Make a play, call your family and friends.

**Read a book!**

**Your next step**

1. I would suggest reading the post [How to Get Started](http://www.reddit.com/r/acting/comments/wih7k/how_to_get_started/) by [fictionalsleep](http://www.reddit.com/user/fictionalsleep). He explains more advanced things like monologues, auditions, the business... See other links on sidebar too.

2. Most important thing is not to forget about your health. If you feel tired, you won't be able to do anything. Get enough sleep, go to the gym and drop junk food. Don't forget to wash your teeth after every meal!

3. If you are working/going to college, don't quit/drop just yet. Take it easy, go step by step. Let acting become your hobby, then think about going professional.

4. Want to act in your own house? Choose a monologue and record yourself. After that, review your acting. Don't be too harsh or easy to yourself, try to be in the middle. Ask some friends to watch and review you.

5. Are you a shy person? Having big stage fright? Don't worry, we all have it. What stage fright means? It means that you are prepared and your body sends messages to let you know that you'll be the best.

6. Don't forget to watch movies, TV series and plays as they can give you more motivation, inspiration and also teach you something.

That's all for now. Remember to have fun. If you fail, don't quit, it will only make you better.

*This post is my viewing of things. If they change, I'll change this post. Also, as I learn new things, this post will be updated.*

*Thanks to [iknowyouright](http://www.reddit.com/user/iknowyouright) for books suggestion. Please if you have any advice, share them in the comments and I'll update the post. If you see any grammar mistakes, I beg you to be grammar nazi and report them. Thanks!*

This is a common question here, so I'd like to compile a list of tips and resources for people asking it.  If you're new here, this doesn't necessarily mean you shouldn't ask the question; everyone's situation is a little different.  But check this out first, and if you have questions beyond what's contained here fire away.  We don't bite.  Also, this will be very US-centric, because I've only acted in the US.

Acting is a thing learned by doing.  It's a craft.  It's improved over time, by trial and error.  By all means read everything you can (see the sidebar), and watch all the videos you can, but at some point you just have to get up and do it.  So...

**1.** Take a class.  Based on everyone who's asked about this so far, you're probably in high school or college.  Chances are very high that your school has acting classes.  Take one.  Don't be scared.  Any decent introductory class isn't going to throw you on stage the first day and make you do a monologue or tell some horrendously personal story.  They'll ease you into it.  It's actually a lot of fun.  And if you're already majoring in something else, you don't have to change your major.  In fact it might be a good idea to major in something OTHER than theatre/acting.  Good actors are well-rounded people.  Good actors also take a lot of classes.  They study, they spend time doing this.  You have to log in the hours to get better.

**2.** There are no classes nearby?  Really?  That's a shame.  Check out any sort of community theatre in your area.  Find out how to get involved with them.  Try auditioning, even.  Maybe you'll get lucky.  You can learn a LOT from being in a show, though ideally you want the environment of a class to try things out without worrying about falling flat on your face.  Those falls can be the most instructive things you'll experience.  No theatres in your area?  Try to find like-minded people and work together.  Film yourselves, give feedback, work on an acting book together, book-club style.  And eventually if you really want to do this you're going to have to relocate to an area with classes/theatres/film schools/etc.

**3.** This is a marathon, not a sprint.  If you've never acted before, there's no magic technique that's going to make you fantastic in four months.  You may even have a lot of innate talent, but you'll have to learn how to focus it.  It's a long process of learning about yourself and what works best for you, and exposing yourself to new techniques and new teachers, or rediscovering some old technique that did nothing for you two years ago but suddenly opened up a wellspring of emotion.

Honestly, in terms of ""getting into acting,"" I don't know what to say beyond that.  You just have to do it, and you have to have someone watching you do it because you can't watch yourself.  Even on film, you'll need an outside eye to help you out.  But this would be a pretty lame post if I left it here, so let's dive a little deeper.

**Monologues:** you'll need them at first.  Everyone coming here wants them.  There are no shortcuts.  Ideally you want monologues from plays.  Film could work, but bear in mind that the medium doesn't lend itself to monologues, typically, and you're setting the bar VERY high if you're forcing the auditor to compare you to Jack Nicholson in A Few Good Men.  So just do monologues from plays.  You're going to have to read a lot of plays.  The library is your friend.  Thus far I haven't found any incredible online resources for monologues, because a lot of the sites have standalone ""original"" monologues with zero context, and the authors haven't exactly proven themselves.  There are a ton of monologue books.  They're not a bad starting place.  The chances of a monologue being overdone increase dramatically once it's anthologized, but that's not always a dealbreaker.  In the very least it's a good way to introduce yourself to a variety of writers.  Do your absolute very best to read the whole script from which the monologue came.  It'll make your job easier, and you won't look dumb if someone asks you about your character.  Oh, and did I mention we have a few sidebar items to get you started on plays?  And if you start taking classes, you're going to encounter a lot of monologues.  Pay attention to what other people are performing.  Grab the ones you like.  Keep a folder of them.

**Scenes:** again, no shortcuts.  Hard to find online.  You can also find scene books.  Scenes are usually only for class, so ""overdone"" isn't something to worry about.  Though again, film/TV can be a problem if you're really familiar with the original performance.  It'll be hard to do your own thing without imitating, especially if you're starting out.  So, read a lot.  

**Auditions:** Reliable sites include [Actors Access](http://actorsaccess.com), [Mandy](http://mandy.com), [Casting Networks](http://home.castingnetworks.com), [Backstage](http://backstage.com)(an excellent resource in general), [ActorsPages](http://actorspages.org), [NowCasting](http://nowcasting.com), even Craigslist, though the standard Craigslist warnings apply.  Don't do anything you're uncomfortable with (i.e. nudity, risque situations), and don't audition at a private residence.  But if you're just starting out it's not a bad place to get some experience.  Most of those sites cost at least a little money to use, so it helps to at least have some training and good headshots before spending the cash on them.  And they aren't scam-free; as iknowyouright wisely said in [another post](http://www.reddit.com/r/acting/comments/w4qru/which_of_the_big_actorcasting_databases_are/c5a7qxx), they're only as reliable as the person posting the call, though they do their best to remove shady casting calls.

**Headshots:** something you'll need eventually, of course, for any audition.  Make sure they look like you on a good day (no glamour shots, not heavy on the makeup/hair styling unless you typically walk around like that).  Focus should be on your face, eyes looking at the camera, something going on behind those eyes.  Background shouldn't be too distracting.  In America headshots are generally color now, though apparently that's not quite as widespread in the UK.

**The Business:** don't worry about it if you're just starting out.  Don't worry about getting an agent, or moving to LA or NY or whatever.  Don't worry about joining the unions.  Educate yourself about all these things, don't ignore them if they present themselves, but don't worry about pursuing them just yet.  Just worry about figuring out how to act, and act well.  Work on yourself and learn what works for you.  Don't be dogmatic.  Don't sneer at The Method, and don't say it's the only way to act truthfully.  Don't get too hung up on your type.  It's a good thing to be familiar with, but in many high school and college acting scenes there's a limited talent pool so people play against type all the time out of necessity.  My first onstage role was at age 19 playing someone's aging father, because I had the deepest voice.  Your type becomes important when you're in big ponds competing professionally, because you want to play to your strengths.

**Scams:** don't give people money up front.  Agents make their money after you book auditions that they lined up for you.  They usually only take 10%.  Beware of strangers referring you to headshot photographers; oftentimes they're just getting a kickback from that photographer.  Beware of people in malls telling you they can get you on a Disney show.  Beware of directors who want to cast you but need a little money from you to get the project off the ground.

TL;DR at bottom. 

I had zero experience acting. I always enjoyed plays and the arts in high school and college but I was a jock and always afraid to put myself out there like that. I love movies and think I am somewhat creative and want to be part of a writing team and help develop some products. My major in college was biology and I always thought I was suppose to graduate and take my MCAT then go to med school. But I wasn't passionate about it and decided to do what makes me happy. So because of some connections I have at different colleges, I have some opportunities to get my grad school paid for. But every school I looked at trying to get into for MFA programs wanted letters of recommendation, resumes, lists of roles you have had and an audition; none of which I had done before. 

So I found r/acting and read how to get started. I decided to do some local theater and auditioned for a play. While the role I got was very small with limited lines, I enjoyed it. Learning lines came easy to me (probably do to memorizing random medical stuff from college years) and any time an actor missed a rehearsal (guy or girl), I jumped at the chance to get on the stage and act to try to better myself. So on opening night of my show another director was in the audience because he just had an actor drop out of his summer show. Even though the actor was contracted, the director was reasonable and let the guy go do theater in NYC for a gig he didn't think he would land. Anyway, he saw me and liked my look and had me in for an audition. Last night he called back and offered me the part of Kenickie in Grease. So now I get to work with other very fine actors, some of whom have been on film and TV. I have head shots later this week! So here's to hoping its one of many parts I land. I still have a long way to go and a ton to learn but stories from this sub gave me the courage I needed to try it. 

**TL;DR:** had zero experience acting 3 months ago. Auditioned for community theater and got a small part.

Whether you were a fan of Glee or not, stories like this are incredibly sad. As actors we are often expected to put on a constantly happy, upbeat face in public and keep our problems to ourselves so it doesn't reflect badly on whatever project we're involved with. Don't hesistate to reach out to a fellow cast member just because their ""vibes"" might mess with your ""process"" or some other such tripe. At the end of the day, we're all just human.

1375290752.0,41,self.acting,1jfknj,Scams: educate yourself,45,4,12,http://www.reddit.com/r/acting/comments/1jfknj/scams_educate_yourself/,"**This is something I think may be helpful to have in the sidebar, so please let me know if I've left anything out or I'm just plain wrong on something and I'll make the necessary changes.**

Knowledge is the enemy of the scam.  Scammers are counting on the fact that you're new and ignorant to how things normally work in the entertainment industry.  So, the best way to avoid being scammed is to learn as much as you can.  Here's a list of red flags:

**Money up front:** agents get paid when you get paid, and it should be 10%.  It shouldn't cost anything to get listed on any sort of database with them, and anyway if they know what they're doing they're actively submitting you, not letting your headshot sit on a server somewhere waiting to be found by a casting director.  And casting directors are paid by the production company for which they're doing casting.  Per [u/crogers2009](http://www.reddit.com/r/acting/comments/1jfknj/scams_educate_yourself/cbe6qrq), in smaller markets you may see some variation on rates, and they may charge a SMALL fee to keep you listed on their database.  Try to check with your peers there to make sure everything's on the up and up.

**They reached out to you:** in case you haven't noticed, our industry is hugely bloated on the supply side.  There are way more actors than there are jobs.  So, there's no real need for agents or casting directors to make cold calls to actors they've never met, because they're flooded with submissions constantly, and they rely on referrals and good work they've seen to connect them to clients.  I have gotten some traction from cold mailings to agents, but of course I keep track of who I mail to and if they get back to me I know who they are.

**They're making big claims and promises:** if they say they have a ton of success stories, find out some names.  Look them up on IMDb and see if those people have any credits.  Verify stories like this.  Also, understand that if thus far you've only done a few plays in college, you're not going to audition for the next big young adult franchise.  Unless you're drop-dead gorgeous and your dad's best friend is an agent at William Morris Endeavor.  In which case can I send you my headshot?

**They focus on youth:** Have you ever been to the performing arts section of Yahoo! Answers?  It's flooded with 13-year-old girls trying to get cast in Disney shows.  Scammers know this, and they'll take advantage of it.  Don't listen to anyone who walks up to you in a mall in Orlando telling you you could be a star.  You could be, but not if you give that guy any money.

**Your gut:** I can't recall a time that someone came here asking if a company was a scam and the answer was no.  If you're asking the question it's because something, somewhere doesn't sit right with you.  Trust that instinct and do some research.  IMDb Pro and the Backstage forums are good places to check, as well as here.

**Here's more info that will help you spot scam companies.**

Actor-&gt;Agent-&gt;Casting Director-&gt;Those responsible for making the project (director, writer, producers, etc)

That's the normal chain you have to follow to get cast in a paying, recognizable gig.  You have an agent, and they submit you for a specific part that a casting director needs to hold auditions for.  The casting director likes your look for the part, so they bring you in to audition.  They like your audition, so they bring you back (or send your tape) so the director, producers et al. can decide if they want to use you.  Managers can play a role too, early in the chain around the Agent link.  [See below](http://www.reddit.com/r/acting/comments/1jfknj/scams_educate_yourself/cbe7o4k) for some discussion on that.

At no point in this process have you spent any money.  Production pays the casting director, and your agent gets paid 10% if you get cast.

So, something to look for: is the company you're not sure about definitely one of the above entities?  Can you find references to them online, with specifics about who works there and what they've done in the past?  If the answer to any of this is no, then you've got a red flag.  

Several of the companies people have asked about here do not fit into that chain.  They outright state on their site that they aren't talent agents or casting directors.  So, what are they?  They might say they're talent consultants or a talent listing service, or talent marketing company.  The vaguer they are they better for their cause.  Technically, they're not doing anything illegal, because they promise nothing.  Sometimes it's a stretch to even call them a scam, though most likely they're well aware of the fact that they're taking the money of actors without any chance of a return on that investment.  They're trying to insert themselves into that chain up there.  As I mentioned, any sort of passive casting database isn't going to get you anywhere due to the glut of actors throwing themselves at the gatekeepers.  For example, I'm registered with One on One in NYC.  It's one of those pay-to-meet places.  They keep a list of all their actors that casting can browse, and I've only ever gotten messages from Columbia students because they seem to have some sort of deal with One on One.  I welcome those messages, but no one casting any sort of paying gig has ever reached out to me in the few years I've been on there.

At this point you may be saying ""what the heck can I do for myself then, if I have to have an agent to get anywhere?""  Well, plenty.  Student films, webseries, low-budget features or short films, Off-Off-Broadway, local theatre, black box theatre, etc.  This is how you build a resume, get better, and get the attention of those who can help you go further.  You can find stuff like this on sites we've talked about on the subreddit before, such as Actor's Access, Playbill, Casting Networks, Backstage, and Mandy.  Craigslist is an option, though you'll need to use extreme caution and sort through a lot of garbage.  You will not find any network/studio-level stuff there, so if they say otherwise--scam.  And if you want to work as an extra, find out who does the background casting in your area and then find out how they want to be contacted.  Some of those offices may charge a small, one-time fee for registration.  As I mentioned in another post, Central Casting in NYC charged $25 when I signed up there.  Just make sure they're a reputable company before forking anything over.  Find out specifically what they're casting for, and what they've cast previously.

If you have a monologue you like, post it in the comments.

Their idea was this- first, we post Monologues on a Monday. By midnight that day, we should stop any additional monologue posts. Then, after reading every monologue, only up vote the one you like best. One upvote, one monologue. Then, starting Tuesday, we'll all record that one monologue. Throughout the week, we will be sifting through comments and giving each other advice/criticism.

/u/zutigufu was thinking of calling it MonoMonday, but any of this is open to suggestions.

This is great because we can practice on our OWN TIME, be able to get feedback.

LET'S DO THIS!

**Cavale – COWBOY MOUTH by Sam Shepherd**

You’re so neat. You’re such a neat guy. I wish I woulda known you when I was little. Not real little. But at the age when you start finding out stuff. When I was cracking rocks apart and looking at their sparkles inside. I bet you would’ve protected me. People were always giving me crap. Ya know what? Once I was in a play. I was real glad I was in a play cause I thought they were just for pretty people and I had my dumb eyepatch and those metal plate shoes to correct my duck foot. It was “The Ugly Duckling” and I really dug that cause of the happy ending. And I got to be the ugly duckling and I had to wear some old tattered black cloth and get crap flung at me but I didn’t mind cause the end I’d be that pretty swan and all. But you know what they did? At the end of the play I had to kneel on the stage and cover my head with a black shawl and this real pretty blonde haired girl dressed in a white ballet dress rose up behind me as the swan. It was really crappy, man. I never got to be the swan. I paid all the dues and up rose ballerina Cathy like the North Star. And afterwards all the parents could talk about was how pretty she looked. Boy, I ran to my hideout and cried and cried. The lousy jerks. I wish you were around then. I bet you would’ve protected me.

**General Order No. 9**

After four years of arduous service marked by unsurpassed courage and fortitude, the Army of Northern Virginia has been compelled to yield to overwhelming numbers and resources.
I need not tell the survivors of so many hard fought battles, who have remained steadfast to the last, that I have consented to the result from no distrust of them.
But feeling that valour and devotion could accomplish nothing that could compensate for the loss that must have attended the continuance of the contest, I have determined to avoid the useless sacrifice of those whose past services have endeared them to their countrymen.
By the terms of the agreement, officers and men can return to their homes and remain until exchanged. You will take with you the satisfaction that proceeds from the consciousness of duty faithfully performed, and I earnestly pray that a merciful God will extend to you his blessing and protection.
With an unceasing admiration of your constancy and devotion to your Country, and a grateful remembrance of your kind and generous consideration for myself, I bid you an affectionate farewell.

— R. E. Lee, General, General Order No. 9[1]

Some actors and actresses were discussing our project and our casting location very negatively. They will not be getting the part.

I don't want to sound fear-mongering or intimidating, but you never really know who is listening, which is true for most interviews for work, but especially for auditions. How someone acts before and after an audition can influence the decision whether or not to cast them.

Edit #1: I wanted to get this up and going as soon as possible, but thought I'd give myself a bit better of an introduction. I've worked in casting for the last 6 years, beginning in theater (Broadway), and that segued into work in film and television, which is the majority of work I've done. I was working in New York City for 5 years, and because of some family stuff had to move back home. It is a smaller local market, but there is still casting to be done! So I've been casting in my local market for a year. 

Just FYI I have never worked in or even been in LA, so any advice I give on that front is going to be from the East Coast POV

I'd like to be an honest and up front with you all as I can. I come from an acting background myself, and I know the struggle. My hope is that through this we can all explore both sides of the audition and the best ways to make it a non-vomit-inducing experience.

I am going to refrain from naming specific projects I've worked on. I might cite movies or shows, but that does not mean I worked on them. Hollywood is a small town and I'd hate for something to be misconstrued and in turn reflect poorly on a project, myself, or the team I worked with, which I'm sure you all understand :)

Edit #2: Taking a break, but please feel free to ask more questions, I'll definitely take the time to answer them (as evident in my previous AMA, I'm a bit of an over-explainer...)

1373254276.0,31,self.acting,1hub6i,To everyone asking for advice on headshots,34,3,7,http://www.reddit.com/r/acting/comments/1hub6i/to_everyone_asking_for_advice_on_headshots/,"A lot of the head-shots shown on here haven't been right- some are good, but, most are not.

You have to do your research before you go out and pay a photographer hundreds of dollars!

I had the great pleasure of having coffee with Jason Siner of ProAct Marketing in LA when he came to my country and I picked his brain on head-shots. Here is some invaluable advice courtesy of his blog:

Marketing Yourself Like A Pro - The Headshot (part 1)
As an actor, the headshot is your calling card. It is the first, and often only, presentation of your physical qualities to whoever is making the casting decisions. Before acting ability or experience, it's simply what you look like that gets you considered long enough for the other factors to come into play. If your photo isn't working for you, it most likely won't matter how good everything else is.

Recently, I used the AT2 site to search for actors to be considered by a management company I am scouting for. Whenever I scan through headshots, I'm never surprised to see quite a few photos that are rather amateur . However, I'm still amazed when I see actors who make terrible ""creative"" choices like wearing sun glasses or a hat that partially obscures their face. The headshot is about showing what you look like. Save the creative choice for your Facebook profile. You also don't get any extra points for going green by lighting only half your face.

Beyond these easily avoidable mistakes, a more subtle faux pas is using the ""neutral shot"". For the photo where you are smiling, most commonly your commercial shot, the neutral shot is the ""half-smile"". Always choose a photo where the smile is at its apex, where your energy is at its fullest. Being sort of enthusiastic or kind of happy about something is not a good sales strategy. This doesn't mean you should have ""jazz hands"" or the ""screaming face"" either. You want to appear charismatically enthusiastic, not characteristically insane.

For the dramatic shot, I find that an actor will simply choose not to smile and leave it at that. This creates a very lifeless photo, devoid of whatever personality and intelligence you might possess. Hopefully, in person, you are not flat and two-dimensional. In order to create interest in you, you must show that you can be interesting, that you can communicate without words. Good film acting is about conveying your thoughts to the audience, so show that you can do that in even a single frame. Make the person looking at your headshot want to see in person how you'll use your unique qualities to bring a character alive. If you do that, you'll get the audition.



Marketing Yourself Like A Pro - The Headshot (part 2)
In part 1 (which you should read first), I discussed some of the common mistakes I see in actor headshots. Now, I want to share some tips to help you take your shots to a whole new level and not only help you get noticed, but may even give you a leg up on being cast.

Whether you are getting headshots for the first time, updating them due to changes in your age or appearance, or simply want better shots to improve you chances of getting called in, you need to first choose the right photographer. I'm always a little hesitant to recommend a particular one, and won't in this article, because one photographer does not work for everyone anyway. However, there are some simple steps to take to give yourself the best chance of finding someone who will take the dynamic shots you're looking for.

First, do your research. If you see an actor with headshots that have that special something, then that should be a photographer to consider. Remember though, that it's not just about having an attractive shot of the actor, especially if that person is just naturally photogenic. Make sure that the photographer captured the personality of the person. Look up the photographer's website and look at their other shots. Are they consistently taking headshots that bring out the actors' personalities? Are their photos interesting and properly lit? Are you drawn in to the actor's eyes in the photo?

Talk to the photographer before you decide. Meeting with them in person is even better. Make sure you feel comfortable with them, that you feel you can just be yourself. Tell them that you want to avoid the ""portrait"" shots, that it's important for you to bring out your personality. Ask how long the session will take. Avoid any photographer that avoids questions or says their session typically takes less than an hour. Also look for a photographer that uses interesting backgrounds or natural settings. You don't want these backgrounds to be distracting from you and they should usually be out of focus. The plain studio backgrounds, especially white and black should be avoided and taken as a warning that this photographer isn't going to give you what you need. take your time and make sure you find the right person. It's not about cost (There are some bad expensive photographers out there) but about finding that connection with the photographer that just feels right.

Okay, so you found the right photographer and you're ready to take your shots. Don't just show up physically or you're back to square one and the ""neutral shot"". Prepare for your shoot just as you would for a film shoot. Have you changes of clothes picked out in advance and know what kind of look you want to achieve, what kind of characters you want to hint at. Remember, no costumes of flashy clothing/accessories. Don't wear anything that distracts from you or is too specific. Save the toga for the party. 

Also, relax before the shoot. Clear the day if necessary. Prepare mentally and keep that thinking going in the session. If you shut down and just sit there, that's what your end results will show. Communicate with the camera. Don't show it or push it out there, just remain active. One of the thoughts I like to use is ""I have a secret that you want to know"". You may find this works or something else will, but actively think it, just as you would mentally stay active for a film shoot if you were listening to another character speaking and the camera is on you. In your headshot session, treat the camera as the other person. Again, don't try to show it on your face. If you think the thought, the camera will catch it. It will be ever so subtle, but it will bring that quality to your photo that will make it so much more interesting than the others.

You can also talk to the photographer. A good photographer (which you've found through your research) will chat with you and put you at ease, make you laugh, or help you bring out the qualities in you that make you special. It's these qualities that take the black text on the white page of a script and turn them into the colorful living character that the audience live through. It's these qualities that make you the actor we want to cast in the role.

When you have free time, it should be spent refining your craft or at least being involved in some way.

Probably the easiest way to stay involved in the theatre world is to read plays. And not just the classics, but new plays. If you want to be a stage actor, you need to be staying up-to-date with all the newly written plays, as they are the foundation upon which theatre is built.

Quite frankly, based on some of the most common types of threads I see in this subreddit, I can tell that many of you are not reading plays on your own accord. If you were, then I would not see 5 new ""Hey, how's my audition piece? I'm doing..."" or ""ACK I need help, what monologue should I use?"" threads every day.

See, what's great about constantly reading plays, is that you should constantly be finding new and exciting monologues. This way, you should NEVER need to ask us, the thespians of /r/acting, what to perform for a monologue, because you will be able to remember and reference the plays that you have read, and where good, usable monologues are. This way, you'll also be performing more than what casting directors have heard millions of times because every auditioner uses the same, overdone monologues from the same monologue books.

It's not a dangerous system of acting, it's not willy nilly and unrepeatable, it's not made specifically for film. It's derived primarily from the work of Stanislavski, Eugene Vahktangov, and Meyerhold, and I use it every day with no trips to the mental hospital.

If you have any questions on what Method is, I'll try my best to answer them. I spent years training at the Lee Strasberg Institute in NYC with some of the last teachers to not only study with Lee, but perform with him and under him. In addition, I've watched all of his recorded lectures (they have a video archive at the institute) and read all his books. I'm not an expert, but I studied with some of the last experts on Method alive. So please, I beg you, ask away.

And on an unrelated note, if anyone says Adler is better than Method or Meisner is better than Adler or something similar, please know that person dosen't know what they're talking about. Meisner, Adler, and Strasberg focused on different aspects of Stanislavski, but if you actually read Stanislavski, you'll find all three are not only saying the same thing, but compliment each other and can be used in tandem.
EX: Sending rays --&gt; Meisner Repetition. Sense memory/relaxation of the muscles --&gt; Strasberg. Using the imagination to enliven the circumstances ---&gt; Adler (really, everyone, but most people associate this with Adler more than anyone)

**EDIT 1- Imagination**: I think here would be a good place to talk about imagination, and why Strasberg's theories are actually very much in support of imagination. First off, he NEVER expected you to have, let alone be able to use, a literal experience for a scene. It's almost impossible given how extraordinary the average character's life is in a play. What he said was to use an *analogous* situation, something that has the essence of the scene in it, in a way you can understand, but where you have to use your imagination to expand upon. Let's say your scene calls for a reluctant murder. You've obviously never killed anyone, let alone hesitated while doing it. But you *know* what that's like because you've killed insects. You've maybe even killed mice and felt bad about it. Or you just imagined having done it. Or you're just the type of person who respects human life too much. All of these are analogous to the event, just a paralel, and something to work from to understand the scene. **ALL** imagination work is like this, because that's how imagination works in the brain. I challenge anyone in the world, every famous artist ever born or will be born into this universe, to draw me an animal they have never seen in life. After they've done that, I want them to take it to a biologist and ask them what it looks like. 100% guarantee that they'll find multiple paralels to different animals. You **CAN'T** imagine something you haven't experienced at least 1% of. That's why when you dream, it may be fantastic and extraordinary and you may think you've never seen anything like it, but if you analyze what you dreamed, it's just bits and pieces of what you know or think about rearranged in a new way to create something new. And that's a big part of the method and using your life. Bits and pieces of unrelated material patched together to create a new reality you believe in that's analogous to the character's life, so you're making the circumstance of the character real for **you** so that **you** can believe in them. Same circumstances, same objective, same everything as the character, but in a way that you innately understand. 

**EDIT 2- Addendums to being in the sidebar**: First off, thank you mods for putting this onto the side bar! I'm glad people will get a chance to see this in the future, and more importantly, be able to ask more questions. I do have to add a few addendums to this though: 1) **I am not an expert.** I am a very devoted actor who continues to study, but I'm still just an actor trying to figure it all out. **When my understanding changes, this post will change.** I couldn't live with myself if I looked back and realized I was feeding you horse shit, so check back and see if one of your questions has been answered in another way! 2) **I have barely scratched the surface of explaining the Method**, and I doubt I could ever do it without a 500 page book. **These explanations of the exercises are horrendously incomplete.** For example: I did not explain you do relaxation with a chair, and specifically with a chair. There are good reasons for it too! So please, please, please, *please* ask more questions. Get curious. There's so much to say that unless I have something specific to latch onto, I feel like I'm trying to fit the ocean in a shot glass and I get lost. 3) Y'all are cool.  

**EDIT 3- Action = Behavior**: Looking at this, I need to clarify that Strasberg primarily worked with the term behavior, not the term action. These may sound interchangable, but they're different. Think of when you normally analyze the script, and you're looking for what you're doing to your partner to get what you want. You call those actions, and they are. However, there's more levels that just that, as you all know, and Strasberg lumped all of those levels and the actions in trying to get your objective as Behavior. Think about when you have an argument in life, for example. You're doing all these verbal actions to make the other person shut the fuck up, or take your side, or just to hurt them, but you're also doing a million other things, probably subconsciously. You never fight with this person, and you love them a lot. Let's say you're not very confrontational, and you deal with that by stroking your hair or playing with your nails and clothes the whole damn fight, just to get through it. Or the opposite choice, you're not very confrontational by nature, but this straw broke the camel's back and you're acting wildly unhabitually. Are you moving more just to cope and cover and finally get all that shit out there? Are you picking things up and fucking around with them left and right to avoid punching the other person? These kinds of physical actions are responses to inner needs from your character, and that's part of behavior. Or, it's a different kind of scene. You've just been beaten the fuck up, and you need to deal with it while negotiating a business deal to save your ass. The negotiation is the most important part, obviously, but you have all the needs of your body SCREAMING to be taken care of at the same time. So maybe you fucking down shots one after the other to start numbing things. Maybe you smoke some pot to relax. Maybe you start square breathing during the negotiation to control the pain. All of this is behavior as well, and one feeds the other. What you do to get your objective will be affected by other behavior, and vis versa. External or internal circumstances affect your **Behavior, which is just everything you're doing on stage.** All those performances you've seen when the actors are just talking at each other? Those actors forgot what life looks like, they forgot about behavior.

**EDIT 4- Instigating Circumstances**: Circumstances and how you deal with them are the basis of acting, really. It's what we work on outside of the actions we need to achieve our objective, and they inform our actions and objective. As a simple example, if you're in your house, you'll behave differently than if you're doing the exact same thing in your grandmother's house. There's one type of circumstance that is the basis of the scene, and everything in that scene is happening because of it. this circumstance caused the scene to happen, and engenders the event of the scene (the ""what"" of the scene, the basic reality of the scene that is the main conflict).That's called the Instigating Circumstance (or that was what I was taught, at least). Plays have them, scenes have them, beats have them, moments have them. **Whatever event (this time meaning occurrence) transpired that caused the play/scene to happen, that's the instigating circumstance.** There can be several interpretations, as long as they fit the logic of the play and the intention of the playwright. Sometimes it's plot related, like the Instigating Circumstance of Hamlet being the death of the king (a possible interpretation, but definitely **not** *the* interpretation). Sometimes, it's more human and simple, like your husband/wife having not talked to you in 3 days. The instigating circumstance informs the objectives of both characters, and the main basic human reality/conflict of the scene. Strasberg knew you had to filter that Instigating Circumstance into something that was personally motivating for **you**. You have to rephrase it in some way that it created a visceral reaction in **you**, and thus would add the power of personal investment to everything you're doing. When it's personal for you, belief and emotion come by themselves.",,False,self,t5_2qyft,1344228762.0,,,True,t3_wpa4m,http://www.reddit.com/r/acting/comments/wpa4m/would_anyone_like_some_myths_about_method_acting/,

I don't post here much. Maybe you don't either, but let's face it: this subreddit is lacking action. Rich rich action. 

Other parts of reddit come here often to get advice on certain things, like help with public speaking or stand-up. We need to whip this place into shape for these people! They have thoughts and feelings and think to themselves ""I will go to a great resource... reddit! I bet there is all kinds of deep crazy insightful artistic stuff at /r/acting.""
And IMO, we underwhelm.

Let's make this FAQ! A lot of the people that come here will click that, get some basic insight that will help their posts and *our* posts as well.

We, then, can begin posting things about technique, philosophy, news, encouragement, critique, advice, ratings, art, plays, the process, teaching, directing, problems, acting related off-my-chests, acting related memes. 

Do we even have a must read list? I don't know a damn thing about setting up an FAQ or sideba, but building these things would go a long way for the future of this subreddit, but more importantly, for the betterment of us who are actors, spectators, artists, actor-moms/dads, teachers, audience members, and people with questions
Let's get an FAQ made for starters and go from there. It'll be great... I just don't know how to do it... I imagine it's collaborative in some fashion... so, comment, reply, PM me, explain it to me, do we PM a mod or something?


**TL;DR: Party has started**


EDIT: Seems we just make the FAQ ourselves and then submit to mods. 

**FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS (LIST ONLY)** *inspired by [lemonpbj](http://www.reddit.com/user/lemonpbj)*


Submit questions here that you think should be on the FAQ for /r/acting, and also ideas for [sidebar content](http://www.reddit.com/r/malefashionadvice). Also, anything else you want to say about the state of this subreddit. Remember questions should be ones that are asked here frequently. I honestly haven't spent a lot of time here so you guys would know better than me. Though, I have taken the privilege of adding my thoughts about the questions underneath them.

**1. How do I get started acting?** *indirectly submitted by [lemonpbj](http://www.reddit.com/user/lemonpjb)*

**2. What are the best books on acting?** *submitted by [GoldenEye008](http://www.reddit.com/user/goldeneye008)* 

**3. Where is a good place to find monologues?** *submitted by [fictionalsleep](http://www.reddit.com/user/fictionalsleep)* 
Maybe this is one that should stay very general on the sidebar. I am not a fan monologues that aren't from plays or film/tv, also not a fan of books that are '1000000 male monologues' where you can't read the context. I think this should go into 'posting advice' where we can say if you are looking for a monologue/scene, give us your stats in the post, deadlines, length etc. etc.

**4. Where can I find auditions?** *submitted by [fictionalsleep](http://www.reddit.com/user/fictionalsleep)*

**5. What is the process of a callback and how should I prepare?** *submitted by [star2fruit](http://www.reddit.com/user/star2fruit)*

**6. How do I get an agent? (including information regarding scams)** *submitted by [SamredditSam](http://www.reddit.com/user/SamredditSam)*

**7. What should my headshot look like? (mentioning how an experienced photographer and not a friend is primary)** *submitted by [SamredditSam](http://www.reddit.com/user/SamredditSam)*

**8. How do I balance work and acting?** *submitted by [Lo_Rez](http://www.reddit.com/user/Lo_Rez)*

Honestly, I think you should just post this one. I don't think it is a frequent question as much as a frequent struggle among actors. Posting stuff like this on it's own is good content where we can relate to each other and share interesting stories.

**9. What's the difference between acting for film/tv vs. acting for theater?** *submitted by [GoldenEye008](http://www.reddit.com/user/goldeneye008)* 

**10. What is this subreddit? (explaining the point of r/acting, what can I find here, etc.)** *submitted by [appleseiter15](http://www.reddit.com/user/appleseiter15)*

We need to probably figure this out. In another thread maybe? Get theoretical? I think it's up to us to define... 

**11. Who are the members of this subreddit? (explaining who is this subreddit for and not for)** *submitted by [appleseiter15](http://www.reddit.com/user/appleseiter15)*

See 10. Also, there might be a way to combine 10 and 11. 'A community based upon the art of acting' is what we have on the front page side bar right now. So, our foundation is the artistic craft of acting, where upon a community is built. A respect for acting exists here. That's awesome! The artistic craft is our foundation then the community of support, discussion, humor, pics, articles, etc. is built upon that. Thoughts?

But seriously boss username he has right? Straight up... NBABASKETBALL. 
That has nothing to do with acting at all.

Ok, let's keep rollin'... and remember to give thoughts about these questions as they come along. Do they deserve to be on a FAQ? How would you word it? What would you like to see more of on this subreddit?

1364483399.0,27,self.acting,1b6hwm,It just hit me: my very first performance is TONIGHT.,32,5,10,http://www.reddit.com/r/acting/comments/1b6hwm/it_just_hit_me_my_very_first_performance_is/,"First, a little bit of back story--I'm usually a pretty quiet guy who keeps to himself, and unless you were one of my closest friends you'd probably rarely hear me talk (my one buddy goes so far as to say I'm the Silent Bob to his Jay). But I've always had a love of movies and I've always been fascinated with acting. So toward the end of last semester I decided to put an end to me being boring, quiet, shy, and I would put myself out there for once: I audition for the spring semester's theater productions.

And I was shocked when I picked to play Matt in [Dog Sees God](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dog_Sees_God:_Confessions_of_a_Teenage_Blockhead)! The play is sorta like Dazed &amp; Confused but using the Peanuts kids, and I was a germophobic, homophobic Pig-Pen. I mean, on the one hand I was ecstatic I even got a part (merely having the guts to audition would've been enough for me), but when I realized who I was playing I had mixed emotions to say the least. At first, I couldn't find any common ground between my character and I. Rehearsals were almost painful: being Matt meant dry humping people, spitting homophobic slurs like it was my job, being a general dick to everyone in the room, physically abusing half the cast and all of my props...saying it was a challenge for me was an understatement. 

But over the last three months I realized something about Matt--I was writing him off, just like everyone would in the world of the play. He was a jock and a bully, and so no one would ever bother to think he has real emotions. On top of that, this was my first production as an actor, and me being a pretty self-conscious guy in the first place made it hard to do a job where doing it right meant people hating you. That made me realize he's actually a victim (Pig-Pen was made fun of in the original Peanuts comic strips for being dirty all the time), and suddenly Matt made sense to me: he does what he does out of fear, and panics when the normal-ness of his life is taken apart. In time, rehearsals (though I never felt quite 100% at home in my character) became less of a chore and I actually began looking forward to them. 

Fast-forward to this week: tech-day was hell; dress rehearsals were a little rough but seeing the show with the lights, music, and set was amazing; getting to see the hard work and enthusiasm of the designers and crew was really inspiring; AND HOLY SHIT WE OPEN IN ABOUT NINE HOURS.

I'm so excited and nervous, and this whole experience has been crazy, exhausting at times, but it's been a blast. I've been both humbled and inspired by the talent and enthusiasm I've been surrounded by doing this show. It's finally hitting me--this is really happening. I'm also pretty behind on school work (I have so much respect for theater people in college...I don't know how y'all stay on top of everything) so I'm honestly looking forward to *not* having 4-5 rehearsals a week.

4. Be bold with your choices. Not a classical actor? Try out Shakespeare. Want to try out a monologue with an accent you haven't trained in yet? Do it. The more risk you take, the more you learn and the more you challenge yourself.

Please let me know what you think, additions, deletions, etc.

In addition to what's listed below, read plays.  Always.  Especially if you're just starting out.  You have a lot of catching up to do.  Familiarize yourself with the classic playwrights, new playwrights, everything.  It'll make you a better actor, and you need to start looking for monologues.  To do that, you just have to read plays.

**EDIT: Is this getting cumbersome?  If so, any ideas?**

**Technique:**

Wanna learn how to act?  Take a class or just jump in and audition (but really, take a class).  This is a hard thing to learn from books alone, but it's a good idea to familiarize yourself with the major approaches and it could help you narrow down where you'd like to study.  And remember, all that matters is if a particular technique works for you.  You don't have to adhere wholeheartedly to any one system.

Konstantin Stanislavski is the granddaddy of modern Western acting.  Not a bad place to start.  His system was initially put forth in three different books ([An Actor Prepares](http://www.amazon.com/An-Actor-Prepares-Constantin-Stanislavski/dp/0878309837/), [Building a Character](http://www.amazon.com/Building-A-Character-Constantin-Stanislavski/dp/0878309829/), and [Creating a Role](http://www.amazon.com/Creating-A-Role-Constantin-Stanislavski/dp/0878309810/)), but SolarTsunami tells us that work has been much better translated into [An Actor's Work](http://www.amazon.com/An-Actors-Work-Students-Diary/dp/041555120X/).

[My Life in Art](http://www.amazon.com/My-Life-Art-Constantin-Stanislavski/dp/0878305505/) (for further reading, if interested)

Richard Boleslavsky was one of Stanislavski's students/actors, and came to America to perform.  He wrote his own take on the approach.

[Acting: The First Six Lessons](http://www.amazon.com/Acting-First-Lessons-Theatre-Arts/dp/0878300007/)

Lee Strasberg saw Stanislavski's troupe perform, and asked Richard Boleslavsky to stick around and teach him and some of his friends.  Strasberg used what he learned to create the Method.  It should be noted that Method acting has very little to do with most of the anecdotes you hear tossed around today.

[Strasberg at the Actors Studio](http://www.amazon.com/Strasberg-Actors-Studio-Tape-Recorded-Sessions/dp/1559360224/)

[The Lee Strasberg Notes](http://www.amazon.com/The-Strasberg-Notes-Lola-Cohen/dp/0415551862/)

Robert Lewis made an effort to dispel some of the rumors &amp; misinformation regarding Method acting in his book.

[Method--Or Madness?](http://www.amazon.com/Method-Madness-Robert-Lewis/dp/0573690332/)

[Advice to the Players](http://www.amazon.com/Advice-Players-Robert-Lewis/dp/1559360038/)

Sanford Meisner was another actor informed by Stanislavski's approach, whose interpretation differed from his friend Strasberg.

[Sanford Meisner On Acting](http://www.amazon.com/Sanford-Meisner-Acting/dp/0394750594/)

William Esper is one of the best teachers in NYC right now, and has his own book on the Meisner technique:

[The Actor's Art &amp; Craft](http://www.amazon.com/The-Actors-Art-Craft-Technique/dp/030727926X/)

Stella Adler was another actress who was taught by Stanislavski's actors, and had an approach based on that which differed from Strasberg's.  Later in life she went to Paris and studied directly under Stanislavski, who had further refined his system since it came to America.

[The Art of Acting](http://www.amazon.com/The-Art-Acting-Stella-Adler/dp/1557833737/)

[The Technique of Acting](http://www.amazon.com/The-Technique-Acting-Stella-Adler/dp/0553349325/)

Michael Chekhov studied under Stanislavski and is known for his development of the ""psychological gesture,"" among other things.

[To the Actor](http://www.amazon.com/To-Actor-Michael-Chekhov/dp/0415258766/)

Uta Hagen is another highly regarded acting teacher from mid-20th Century.

[Respect for Acting](http://www.amazon.com/Respect-Acting-Uta-Hagen/dp/0470228482/)

[A Challenge for the Actor](http://www.amazon.com/A-Challenge-For-The-Actor/dp/B002DMJUK4/)

Richard Brestoff wrote a good practical handbook with exercises to utilize Stanislavski's system.

[Acting Under the Circumstances](http://www.amazon.com/Acting-Under-Circumstances-Stanislavski-Step-By-Step/dp/1575251876/)

Michael Caine wrote a good book on acting for film, which is also a [YouTube video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Njs6ZNSoFC0).

[Acting in Film](http://www.amazon.com/Michael-Caine-Applause-Revised-Expanded/dp/1557832773/)

Tony Barr also has a good book on acting for the camera.

[Acting for the Camera](http://www.amazon.com/Acting-Camera-Revised-Tony-Barr/dp/0060928190/)

Also suggested by Katrabbit, this book fits here as well as any other category.  It'll help you nail down exactly what you're trying to do in a scene.

[Actions: The Actor's Thesaurus](http://www.amazon.com/Actions-Actors-Thesaurus-Marina-Caldarone/dp/0896762521/)

Anne Bogart is a respected theatre artist whose book applies to both actors and directors.

[And Then, You Act](http://www.amazon.com/And-Then-You-Act-Unpredictable/dp/0415411424/)

[Viola Spolin](http://www.amazon.com/s/ref=nb_sb_noss_1?url=search-alias%3Daps&amp;field-keywords=viola+spolin) has written a few books, often related to ""games"" for theatre, some of which you'll surely end up doing in class.  Good ideas for rehearsals, too.


**Period Acting**

Does anyone know a good book on acting Shakespeare?  Turns out Katrabbit does:

[Secrets of Acting Shakespeare](http://www.amazon.com/Secrets-Acting-Shakespeare-Original-Approach/dp/0878301488)

There's also a video series from the Royal Shakespeare Company, Playing Shakespeare, some of which can be seen on [YouTube](http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=playing+shakespeare&amp;oq=playing+shakespeare&amp;aq=f&amp;aqi=g9&amp;aql=&amp;gs_l=youtube.3..0l9.7385.10937.0.11063.23.15.2.6.6.0.165.1168.13j2.15.0...0.0.lrHqIbBS-qs).  You can also get the DVD &amp; book by John Barton.

[Acting in Restoration Comedy](http://www.amazon.com/Acting-Restoration-Comedy-Applause-Series/dp/155783119X/)

**Movement &amp; Voice**

The Alexander Technique is taught in a lot of acting schools.  It deals with getting your body to a free, natural state so whatever's going on inside you can come out more easily.  It also ties in closely to good voice work.

[A New Approach to the Alexander Technique](http://www.amazon.com/New-Approach-Alexander-Technique-Expression/dp/0895949180/)

Jerzy Grotowski did a lot to explore physical acting in the 60s.  See the ""theory"" section for his book.  His student Stephen Wangh wrote a book more directly for actors.

[An Acrobat of the Heart](http://www.amazon.com/An-Acrobat-Heart-Physical-Grotowski/dp/0375706720/)

Kristin Linklater's work is one of the standards for vocal work for actors.

[Freeing the Natural Voice](http://www.amazon.com/Freeing-Natural-Voice-Kristin-Linklater/dp/B001EJS2BU/)

**Audition**

Michael Shurtleff's book *Audition* was standard for a long time.  It's dated now, and gives straight up bad advice in some areas (thanks SolarTsunami), but be aware that a teacher may at some point want you to read it.  I recommend Margie Haber's book.  It's very hands-on, step by step, and more modern.

[How to Get the Part without Falling Apart](http://www.amazon.com/How-Part-Without-Falling-Apart/dp/1580650147/)

**Comedy**

Charna Halpern's book is required reading for anyone studying at Upright Citizen's Brigade, one of the top comedy schools in both NY and LA.

[Truth in Comedy](http://www.amazon.com/Truth-Comedy-The-Manual-Improvisation/dp/1566080037/)

**Business** I'm weak on books in this area, welcome any suggestions at all.  Also be aware that books of this nature become dated VERY QUICKLY.

Yesterday I had my first audition. I had 40 minutes sleep, left my home at 5am to leave Ireland and get to London for the day, I was tired, very scared and considered leaving the theatre 3 times and just quitting. We had to perform in front of all the other auditionees, which i'd never done before, I was by far the most uneducated in the Art form with the least experience and clearly the most nervous. But I got through all 3 rounds with my 2 monologues, my contemporary i taught myself and my shakespeare i had help with from my new acting teacher. Long story short, I got accepted today and am moving to London for the next few years in September.

I was consistently praised and awarded because in a competitive undergraduate acting program, there is a huge stigma against ""playing yourself"" and ""doing the same thing with every role"". Along the way, however, I've definitely overlooked who I am as a person and how that translates into who I am as an actor. As a result, I have a very underdeveloped starting point or neutral. 

Since graduation, I've made it my mission to define what good acting is. I've even spoken to actors after shows in NY to see what they were like offstage vs. onstage. What I've discovered is that good acting is not necessarily transformational, but rather an elimination of all unconscious elements of performance. 

Because I have a good training background, I don't have any detrimental problems, but what I've noticed is that when I act:

1. My breathing changes. I don't hold my breath, but something about my breathing is less natural and more conscious that it would be in a real life situation.

2. My voice is slightly different. I don't have a fake, actor voice, but my voice has less ease than it does in real life.

3. My movements are more limited than they would be in real life unless I have very specific blocking that I can do unconsciously.

I'm wondering if any of you have ever gone through a similar rebuilding process. Does anyone have any recommendations on how to eliminate these differences and solve these problems?

 Helena from A Midsummer Night's Dream by William Shakespeare.

Context: Helena is lovesick. Demetrius was once engaged to Helena but abandoned her after he met her best friend Hermia. Hermia's father has promised her in marriage to Demetrius, but she is in love with another boy named Lysander. Hermia and Lysander plan to run away and marry each other, but Demetrius continues to chase after Hermia. Helena cannot seem to win back Demetrius' attention, and conjures up a plan to change his mind.

How happy some o'er other some can be!
Through Athens I am thought as fair as she.
But what of that? Demetrius thinks not so;
He will not know what all but he do know:
And as he errs, doting on Hermia's eyes,
So I, admiring of his qualities:
Things base and vile, folding no quantity,
Love can transpose to form and dignity:
Love looks not with the eyes, but with the mind;
And therefore is wing'd Cupid painted blind:
Nor hath Love's mind of any judgement taste;
Wings and no eyes figure unheedy haste:
And therefore is Love said to be a child,
Because in choice he is so oft beguiled.
As waggish boys in game themselves forswear,
So the boy Love is perjured every where:
For ere Demetrius look'd on Hermia's eyne,
He hail'd down oaths that he was only mine;
And when this hail some heat from Hermia felt,
So he dissolved, and showers of oaths did melt.
I will go tell him of fair Hermia's flight:
Then to the wood will he to-morrow night
Pursue her; and for this intelligence
If I have thanks, it is a dear expense:
But herein mean I to enrich my pain,
To have his sight thither and back again.

You may never get another opportunity like this one. Just because you hate it - what gives you the right to punish me, to take this away from me?
I mean, come on! Do you think anyone would have produced the show you wrote? It was so...gooey. Sappy, sentimental, cheesy, corny, and Hallmark. Lifetime-made-for-TV-movie, Bridges-of-Madison-County, Oprah-book-of-the-month-club gooey!
[Kim collects her belongings and starts to leave. Shane panics.]
Kim. Wait, don't go. Please? You're holding all the cards here, okay? You've got me right where you want me - desperate, okay? So, I will listen to whatever you have to say. And I won't be hostile. I promise. Just, please... Sit back down, have a drink with me, and tell me what I have to do to work this out.
Kim, come on. This is my one shot to actually use my ridiculously expensive Theatre degree. I really don't want to end up teaching high school drama and English. Don't you see how badly I need this? Can't you at least sit down and talk to me? Please?

The whole point is to help aspiring acting talent (from where they live versus moving to LA, NY, etc.) by letting them upload videos of them reading sides, monologues, auditions, etc.  

There are two beta contests right now:

[Beta Contests](https://beta.youarehollywood.com/contests?utm_source=reddit&amp;utm_medium=acting_subreddit&amp;utm_content=textlink&amp;utm_campaign=end_of_may_reddit_acting)

These contests will last for 4 weeks and I'm offering real money for the prizes.  There are no ads at this time and all content must be in the form of a YouTube link.  Use your iPhone or Android or whatever you have to showcase your acting chops then drop the link in your YouAreHollywood.com account.

The official launch contest will be called the Hollywood Experience and offers a trip out to LA to meet with some casting directors, talent agents, a little fun in the sun, and a shot at a part in an indie film.  This will launch later in the summer.

This is a beta, so something might change or break.  Pour on the feedback please: beta [AT] youarehollywood [DOT] com

Thank you!
Ted

Throughout my not-that-long career of acting I have found myself getting book recommendation from teachers/directors/colleagues by the bundle.

I do know some actors are very much against the theory and more about practicality, but some books have the ability to blow your mind, or you read a book and 5 years later the penny drops about something you read there and you're like ""I've been doing this all wrong"". Well, that's me, at least.


I'd love to get recommendations from you guys.

Okay, so at 14 she just decides she wants to be an actress. Her parents up and move from Kentucky to to go to New York so she can find an agent. But wait, agents don't simply take anyone on as you're all well aware, so how on earth does she just get one?

Then it'll suddenly be ""She started out her acting career in the TBS comedy The Bill Engvall Show."" and from there, the cumulative advantage takes effect and they get more and more roles. But how? How did they suddenly skip past the part where no agent will take them without a good acting education and experience to this in the first place? It's bizarre.

Doug from Gruesome Playground Injuries by Rajiv Joseph.

You know what, Kayleen? Jesus Christ, you know, I came to your house last year and your dad was there, and I know he hates my guts, he always has, and he's like She is where she is. I don't know where the girl is.
He said he didn't care and didn't care to know. And I was about to just leave, but I didn't. I didn't and I said to that son of a bitch...
(he turns to the funeral home and shouts at it)
You remember, asshole? You dead piece of shit!? You remember what I said to you!?
I said to him, you are fucking worthless.
You have a daughter and she is a gift from God. She is the most perfect being to ever walk this earth and you don't even know it. And she loves your because you're her stupid father. But you've never loved her back, you've just damaged her and fucked her u, and never bothered to notice she's this angel.
So fuck you, cocksucker.
(beat) And then I told him I hoped he'd die alone.
Which he did.

**FEMALE**

Amy from And Turning, Stay by Kellie Powell

Don't you dare walk away from me! And don't tell me you're sorry! And don't tell me to forget it, and don't you dare tell me to ""let it go."" God knows, I'd like to. I wish I could, but I can't! I can't forget that we had something, and you're running away. You're running away! Don't you see, Mark? You're running from what I've searched for all my life! Why, because you're scared? Well, I'm scared too, but you and I - we have something worth fighting for. We could make it work, I'm not saying it would be easy, but I care about you. And I know deep down, under this (Spitting out the word.) bravado, you care about me. And that's what it's all about, Mark, don't you get it? It's the human experience. You can pretend all you want, but you're only lying to yourself. You're denying the simple and wonderful fact that you are emotional, and vulnerable, and alive.
Can you honestly stand there and tell me that I mean nothing to you? That everything that happened that night was a lie? That you feel nothing? I feel sorry for you, Mark. I'll move on. I'll find someone else. I'll be all right, because I will know that I tried. That I did everything I could. But someday you will look back, and you will realize what you threw away. And you will regret it always.

“I will take my rightful place on stage
and I will be myself.
I am not a cosmic orphan.
I have no reason to be timid.
I will respond as I feel;
awkwardly, vulgarly,
but respond.

I will have my throat open,
I will have my heart open,
I will be vulnerable.
I may have anything or everything
the world has to offer, but the thing
I need most, and want most,
is to be myself.

I will admit rejection, admit pain,
admit frustration, admit even pettiness,
admit shame, admit outrage,
admit anything and everything
that happens to me.

The best and most human parts of
me are those I have inhabited
and hidden from the world.
I will work on it.
I will raise my voice.
I will be heard.”

MUST HAVE A REEL. Even if it's a badly-shot YouTube video, please have something to show us, otherwise it will be really hard to get back to you. Not particular on type, but you must be willing to go over the top ridiculous, be funny, able to do physical comedy and improvise on the spot. Bonus points for being able to look awkward or slightly strange. Inspiration for the shoot is the iconic Office Space scene: https://vimeo.com/56886652

PAYING EXTRA if you have your own cosplay costume that is unique (i.e., not based on any real character from an existing game. Anything medieval (wizard, sorceress, knight) will work. Also, please note if you're willing to do drag, as in a male dressing up in a female skimpy sorceress outfit.

So, instead of sitting here despairing, I thought I could use my experience to educate you.  I made a throwaway because I'm going into details here that I don't want associated with my normal account.

I got my MFA from a school in NYC in 2007.  At the time, I had borrowed a total of $102,861 to get through school.  School itself was around $30k/year, and I had a very small scholarship.  I didn't have time to work, so I need to take out loans to pay for living expenses, which of course is not cheap in NYC. 

As of today, I owe $126,722.  I've been making regular (but very low) monthly payments on one set of loans, and using every deferment and forbearance I could scavenge on the other set, but the hammer's about to drop and my monthly payments are going to be around $900.  I have 23 years left of that before I'm clear.  My repayment plan is basically to book a national commercial, which of course isn't easy.

I just want to point out one potential future for people who go through grad school.  No one really walked me through what this was going to be like, financially, and I was quite ignorant when I signed up.  Of course I looked at the amount I was asking for and thought it was high, but the nuts and bolts of dealing with this are hard to imagine at that point.  As you all know, it doesn't make a whole lot of sense to go through that sort of training and just get a 9-5 career-type job, but at this point I'm not really sure what else to do to make these payments.

I'm 25... Living at home... With an audio engineering (associates) degree that has allowed me to work in radio but getting no where  but with invaluable network connections. 
My last semester (fall of 12) in school....I only had to take one last class so  I decided I was going to take an acting class as well. I'd always wanted to act and I had time to take extra classes for shits and giggles, the good thing of living at home... I guess... 
There's a lot in between but it could take a long time...
Through a regional theatre competition I was given the chance of being selected to go to (I got the central character role in an original play and was selected amongst a cast of about 30) there were professional auditions for colleges and for work. I got an immediate call back from a university. Which is great and all... But I'm done with college... Shit 7 years I've been at it? No thanks. My professor said it was a very good sign that I got a call back at my first professional audition after my first performance ever. Even the fact that I was selected was a good sign. 
A couple of weeks later I get an email from an acting school in LA... A good one... Telling me about a summer program.... 

A door has opened and I'm taking it...
I'm jumping into the abyss and hoping to learn to fly on the way down. I'm leaving my small job.... My secure home for the tough streets in LA.... Tough not in the physical sense but rather in the psycho-emotional level. A place that can make you or break you... I have little experience... But I've been told by experts and professional actors that I am good, very good. I haven't let it get to my head I just need experience ... I know I have a lot to learn... But I'm so scared of failing. For it has always (secretly) been my dream to be an actor... I was always scared for some reason.... But now that I have I cannot get enough of it... It's the most incredible feeling in the world to immerse yourself into a world not of your own playing a part that isn't you... Or is it you? Manifested under the guise of a character... There's always a part of you that bleeds into the character... And oh the character that I am...

... I'm scared... Lonely.... Vulnerable... But I am going to follow my dream... 

Thanks for reading... I feel better

Currently there is no way of knowing whose advice is good advice for people who are new to the world and they might not whose advice is valuable. I think that adding flair based on people's training would be a really good way to distinguish posts of more value from posts of less value. 

For example, I am about to complete my BFA in Acting, I could provide some proof of this to you and you could put a little piece of flair that says ACTING BFA next to my username. Someone with an MFA could provide proof and you could put ACTING MFA next to their name. Perhaps someone with lots of professional experience in classical plays for example could have something like CLASSICALLY TRAINED ACTOR next to their name or a consistently working film actor (lots of proof needed for this one) could have CONSISTENTLY WORKING FILM ACTOR next to their name.

The dialogue is about a Dying Man, on his death bed, declaring his atheism to a Priest who considers his life a gratuitous mistake. It is a fairly short dialogue, neither written strictly as a novel or as a stage play but rather as a straight body of text. Below is a link to a site that will give you a translation of the text;

When arriving back in London, in 2012 I have carried on with 2 artistic residencies and 2 shows in Central London receiving 5 and 4 star reviews. Me and my company consistently work on varied art projects as well as collaborating with other companies and working on side projects.

Here is my side project. As an enthusiast for Marquis de Sade, I have admired 'A Dialogue Between...' for a long time for its beautifully written argument for atheistic mindsets, with clear, witty and intelligent writing that is surprisingly modern considering it was written well over 200 years ago! I am collaborating with award winning Director/ Camera Operator and Editor- Hazeleigh Prebble- on this project as I am extremely impressed with his keen and artistic eye for camera work as well as his impressive achievements in his field. Below is a link to his work (please check out his appearances tab in the bottom right hand corner where more work can be found)

http://vimeo.com/hazeleighprebble

This project is going to be a tasteful handling of the on-going debate against religion and for reason, without the unnecessary cult-bashing of religious groups but rather a more levelled playing field where the reasons are laid out on the table for a world more concerned with consideration for others and science, but also this project will be an exploration of such personalities who adopt such opposing lifestyles.
I will be performing as the Dying Man, he is a modern day man who lives as much as what one life can be considered as wholesome if more on the side of enjoying himself even with inevitable death starring over his shoulder. The Priest is a woman who is a caring and considerate individual, can be seen as slightly young to be indoctrinated into Priesthood, she cares for others but feels out of touch with the wider community and is slightly unfulfilled but shares a relationship with the dying man who she sees as someone she needs to save yet she discovers she may be the one who needs saving. It is this character I need to cast.

Why am I turning to Reddit to cast an actress?

Well, with Reddit being a fairly open-minded community, who seems to be a witty and humorous one but as well as a group who is interested in progressive sciences and seems to have a strong atheistic following, it seems to best place to find someone new. This project is purely a passion-project, I must stress this. This film doesn't require an Acting School trained actress or someone who has always wanted to be on the silver screen but someone who is passionate about Progressive Art, someone who wants to test waters and push boundaries and someone who cares strongly about the state of the world and it's relationship to religion. Another important note is that this is purely non-profit and not paid. On completion the film will be released online for free after it has been through relevant film festivals and all physical reproductions will be done on a cost-covering basis. Regardless of all the shows myself and my company have done, it is art before money, and money making seems to get in the way of the artistic side.

Character Profile-
Gender- Female 
Playing Age- 21-28 
Ethnicity- Any 
Height- 5'5”-5'11” 
Build- Any

Requirements- 
Live in the London area and be willing to travel 
An Actress who enjoys working intensely with a focus on methodic acting 
Open-minded, intelligent and creative. 
Flexible working hours. The shoot shouldn't take more than a week in total and the rehearsal period will be an intensive working period of a few weeks to a month. 
No professional training needed, just a natural intuition. 
Someone who really wants to make this project work

I like to build up a friendship with the actress to effectively build up a convincing onscreen relationship and I need to have an intellectual connection to get the best result for honouring de Sades work. I want this to be a modern day adaption of his work and it will be filmed with a focus on a personal relationship with such a wide view of the world, with stunning cinematography and refeshing filming techniques.

Are you interested?

If you or anyone you know would be interested in performing in this piece, please email me with your reasons why you are interested, a small bit about yourself and a headshot or similar style picture. Most importantly,

SPREAD THE WORD!

I have turned to Reddit because of the amazing ability to reach a lot of people with similar interests and with /r/atheism having over 1,500,000 members I am hoping I can find one person.

Thank you for taking the time to read this, it would mean a lot to me if you could spread this.

With many more thanks, Jamie Noel Duddy.

Apparently, 9 months ago, someone had a brilliant idea and created a subreddit for monologues. The posting structure is great, because the title of each post includes Gender, Genre, Age, and Era. If in need of a monologue, you can easily scroll through and find one that is relevant to your needs without any serious hassle.
Then, as a service to others, maybe you post a monologue or two that you've found helpful for others to find.
Nowhere is there another service like this. Free, diverse, well organized, (hopefully) creative monologues for the sharing.

**What makes a good headshot?**

* Your headshot should look like you, don't try to hide things that you find undesirable, you may have something that people want.
* Headshots should be updated every 5 years minimum or after a major physical change (weight loss/ gain, hair changes, etc)
* Your headshot needs to capture attention and tell us something about you. Make sure you consider what qualities you are looking to show off.
* Look natural, these are not a fashion shoot.
* Keep it simple.
* Your headshot should be geared towards the kind of work you want to get Film/ theatre/ commercial/ industrial.
* No logos or slogans
* Nothing garish
* No black, white, or noisy patterns
* Relax
* Always 8X10 prints
* Color is the current acceptable, professional standard

**Females**

Three Sisters, by Anton Chekhov. This is Irina.

Tell me, why is it I'm so happy today? As if I were sailing, with the wide, blue sky above me, and great white birds soaring in the wind. Why is it? Why? I woke up this morning, I got up, I washed--and suddenly I felt everything in this world was clear to me--I felt I knew how life had to be lived. Dear Ivan Romanich, I can see it all. A human being has to labour, whoever he happens to be, he has to toil in the sweat of his face; that's the only way he can find the sense and purpose of his life, his happiness, his delight. How fine to be a working man who rises at first light and breaks stones on the road, or a shepherd, or a teacher, or an engine driver on the railway...Lord, never mind being human even--better to be an ox, better to be a simple horse, just so long as you work--anything rather than a young lady who rises at noon, then drinks her coffee in bed, then takes two hours to dress...that's terrible! In hot weather sometimes you long to drink the way I began longing to work. And if I don't start getting up early and working, then shut your heart against me, Ivan Romanich.

**Males**

""I Hate Hamlet"" Comedic, male, Age is irrelevant - But I guess young 20's.

Last night, right from the start, I knew I was bombing. I sounded big and phony, real thee and thou, y’know? Just completely fake. And then I started rushing through it. I just couldn’t connect. I couldn’t get ahold of it…and while I’m….babbling, I look out and there’s this guy in the 2nd row, a kid, obviously dragged there by his parents. And he’s yawning, and he’s kicking his legs, and playing with his phone. Completely oblivious. And I just wanted to shout out “hey kid, I’m right there with you! I can’t stand this either!” But I couldn’t do that, so I just keep feeling worse and worse, just completely drowning up on stage.
And I thought “what have I gotten myself into?” I’m not Hamlet. I’m no actor. What am I even doing here? And then I get to the soliloquy, the big job, I’m right in the headlights, and I just thought, oh Christ, to heck with it!
“To be or not to be, that is the question Whether ‘tis nobler in the mind to suffer The slings and arrows of outrageous fortune, And by opposing, end them”
And I kept going, I finished the speech, and I look out, and there’s that kid. And he’s listening. The whole audience, complete silence, total focus. And I was hamlet. And it lasted about 10 more seconds, and then everything went back to normal. But for that one little bit, for that 1 speech, I got it. I had it. I was hamlet. And then I realized, I had 8000 more lines to go.

this is where things get difficult and frustrating for me. i picked my current school largely based on its professional level facilities and the fact the teachers both acted as a career before teaching. what i found was different. the only kids casted for large roles had gotten them before, and to join this special club you have to be lucky. for example, one girl who never acted before in her life was told she was a natural after being used as a replacement when one lead dropped out, and is now in the inner circle. and i want so bad to tell the directors that this isnt fair to me as a three year veteran but i dont want to risk embarrassing myself.

well that was alot to get off my chest but you get the idea. so, tell me, am i not the lead because of dumb luck? old school was so small i never saw how average i was? 

TL;DR: old school theater very small, i was the lead all the time, new school theater big, only an inner circle that requires you go through the god damnedest biggest hoops you ever saw as a requirement is the lead. why am i not a lead?

Share Your Stories, Drama With Fellow Actors",12,1,9,http://www.reddit.com/r/acting/comments/1comn8/have_something_on_your_chest_share_your_stories/,"I think we can learn from each other by sharing some negative experiences with our fellow actors. Please feel free to share what happened and how you have dealt with it. I'll start:

I'm (25f) going through a situation right now in one of my classes where these 2 sisters (around early 20s, younger one might be 18 ish) HATE me. Like really hate me, and there is nothing I can do about it. I've tried apologizing and it made her freak out even more. It's been about 3 weeks since the incident, when I discovered that they hate me. Basically our class is structured with a lot of student feedback, the teacher welcomes everyone's feedback to everything regarding scene performances and questions asked in class. The younger sister asked a question on how to cry, and my contribution was ""therapy"" and I was going to explain exactly what I meant (that acting classes have been like therapy--or what I think is like therapy since I've never been--to me because it has helped me bring down walls and get in touch with my emotions), but she completely freaked out and accused me of saying that *she* needed to get therapy, basically taking it personally. After seeing how she got so offended, I really felt bad and wanted to clear it up with her, as it was a complete misunderstanding IMO, and went over to her to apologize and let her know that I didn't mean it that way at all. Unfortunately, I made the mistake of calling her by sister's name and she just exploded at me. I was shocked. Her sister came over and made violent threats at me and said that this isn't the first time I've done this and that I have been interrupting her sister in previous classes. I was shocked, I had no idea that I was doing this or that they had a problem with me. Well it's been 3 weeks since that happened and one of the teachers, who wasn't there when this happened, wanted to clear the air and mediate. Well they said that since they first met me I had an ""attitude"" and that I was very rude and ""nationalistic"" because I ""pretended to not hear/understand"" when she said her name (they have accents, younger sister has a stronger accent). So basically they really want to believe that I'm deliberately being mean and malicious. Again, I apologized sincerely during the mediation, but the sister said she didn't want to hear it. Sad, but that's just how it turned out. She doesn't want to be near me or talk to me or make any eye contact. 

I appreciated the mediation attempt by my teacher, now I know it's not me at all, negative people breed negativity in their minds. If anyone is going through this with other actors or just people in your life, I just want to say that if you have good intentions and other people misinterpret it then that is on them. It's not you at all. And there is nothing you can do. The teachers and others in the class basically sympathize with me and understand now that the sisters are volatile, so they know that I am not malicious at all, and I'm not worried at all. Actually I'm using this experience the best way I can... there are many bumps on the journey of an actor/actress, you will butt heads with others and not everyone will like you. How you deal with these experiences will set the pace of your journey.

I've seen some seriously mediocre performances improve exponentially, simply by using two or three exercises outlined in this book after gaining a more thorough knowledge of where breath comes from and how to harness it to make one's speech more powerful.

The acting world is tough to get into, so I decided to learn editing at school as a back-up. I want to do some acting outside of school to work on my acting. I have acted in eight student films, one commercial, and an independent film in the last year. The directors of these productions tell me I'm a good actor to which I reply thanks. It is a nice confidence boost, but I don't indulge in their compliments. I have seen myself act. I know that I need lots of work. So I was wondering about some recommendations. 

My college only offers one film acting class, which I have taken already. The rest of the acting classes are only for theater. I am allowed to take them, but they only teach acting for the stage and not for film and television. There is nothing wrong with theater, it just happens to not be a preference of mine. Anyway, I can't really afford to get an acting coach, or at least a consistent one. I could probably pay for an hour or two once in a while, but that's it. Then, with taking classes outside of my school, I know I can't afford that.

I'm auditioning for a show written by Colleen Murphy called ""The December Man"" which is a one act play about the Montreal Massacre on December 6, 1989, where a man went to a university and started killing people. He sent about 45 men out of an engineering class, and kept the 9 women. He killed them all, killed maybe 3 more on other floors, then turned the gun on himself.
I'd be playing the role of one of them men that was sent out of the room, and ran away, and how everything has haunted him, and how he feels the women still follow him. After this tragedy he has become a very gaunt, thin, emotional man.

Christian Bale is a perfect example of the extremes someone's body can reach when becoming a character.

1341235724.0,12,self.acting,vx8b8,"Hey, I'm a hobbyist filmmaker looking for a voice actor for my short movie. Is this the right place to ask?",14,2,15,http://www.reddit.com/r/acting/comments/vx8b8/hey_im_a_hobbyist_filmmaker_looking_for_a_voice/,"If you know of a more appropriate subreddit feel free to point that to me.

Alright, the idea is that in our 3-6 minutes long short movie the main character lives in a post-apocalyptic world, think Fallout game series. Instead of him acting all gloomy since he's the only survivor and everything is destroyed, he embraces it and pours street (ruin?) wisdom through his inner monologue he keeps having all while wandering around the ruins of a place that used to be a massive city.

The character sounds like a stereotypical redneck to give the impression of a stupid person but compensates for that via his character and drive. He's the kind of a person you would want to hang around with in a world like that, he's just casually existing as if laying on a hammock on a sunny day with no useless worries.

If you're interested, try this piece of monologue line: 
&gt;”What keeps me going is the thought that all this won’t stay like this forever. All the previous extinctions haven’t stopped life from emerging again and again, and it’s quite likely that it won’t be any different this time. Sure it sounds impossible when you look at how things are now, but the impossible has happened before. Like how hydrogen with given enough time, ended up thinking about itself.""

You're free to change some minor words if you feel it'd be more appropriate for the character. Don't make it too serious, the man is kind of there wandering, relaxed, thinking in redneck voice. The character shouldn't feel like he's telling a story of any sort, he's just kind of there as if thinking out loud. Meaning that no specific emphasizing of words you would normally do when trying to say something important because to him its just casual blabbering. Imagine what the guy would sound like when at a ranch talking to another redneck brother ""Look at dem horses running wild."" and that's how it should show in his affect.

The movie has already been shot but I'd like to edit it to match the monologue length. To give you little visual guide, I've previously [created this image](http://fc04.deviantart.net/fs70/i/2011/363/1/d/a_man_with_his_rifle_in_another_destroyed_city_by_knightari-d4klwq6.png) while imagining a similar theme of a post-apocalyptic world. And this is a concept [still shot](http://i.imgur.com/1xytb.jpg) from the short movie itself.

It's going to be a visually driven movie with contradicting atmosphere. Stupid sounding guy giving smart monologue while not taking it all too seriously. A character who has every reason to be pessimistic but is content and keeps on travelling forward, not really knowing where but it doesn't matter to him since everything is absurd anyway.

Tell me if you're interested. If you've got a good mic and feel like recording something, you could post it on this thread so you can simultaneously show off your voice to others, message me or email larry.knight [at] wippies.com. I was thinking that by 11th day I would have found somebody to do the voiceover.

I'll probably keep updating this thread with stills or brief vids of the short movie to keep you interested although I'd rather edit it according to the monologue. 

The short movie is something we're making for recreation with no budget but it will end up most likely circulating some festivals and such.

**EDIT:** I've been found it's been hard to communicate what the character is about.

I have always been shy and introverted; never had many friends, only a few close ones; didn't play outside much; pretty wimpy and got bullied, spent most of my time reading. I'm sure you understand the type I'm talking about.

All of my life, I've both had a lot of respect for actors, and I was deeply scared of them. 

While I appreciated the way they could change their personas and look just like real persons on the stage and on film, I was also scared by it. I have extreme stage fright, and going on stage and becoming another person infront of an audience was just scary and embarassing to me. I was constantly afraid of doing anything infront of an audience, even in an informal setting infront of a close friend(s)

A friend of mine then told me that mostly introverted people became actors, since they could get a release from their own identities by slipping into another identity, in which they could do things they normally couldn't.

Also, he told me that if I could keep imitating someone else who was confident, I could get rid of a lot of my social fears' become another person as it were.

So my question to you guys is : is what my friend said true? Are some actors inroverted and thus become better actors? And can trying to become another character help me in any way?

So, I decided to go to university and get a degree in a completely unrelated discipline.  But I couldn't let go of acting either.  While I was studying I did some amateur things and recently managed to get my first agent.  Well, I have just graduated from university with a decent degree, and I don't know what to do.  I have been applying for jobs in banking (even have an interview lined up) because I know it is the smart choice financially.  But if I actually get a 9-5 office job and my agent calls with an audition, how will I go to it?  Auditions tend to be during office hours.  Even if I somehow did get to an audition and got offered the part, I'd have to quit my office job before I could accept it.

I understand that getting a part in professional projects is extraordinarily difficult even for beautiful, experienced actresses so I'm looking to doing it as a hobby, not professionally. The threads in this subreddit seem to point to student films as opportunities for ""résumé fillers"" so I assumed that I might have a chance of being cast in them.

1. Is my deduction about student films correct (that I have a decent chance of being cast in one even though I don't have an extensive acting background)?
2. If no, then where should I look instead, if anywhere?
3. If yes, then do I have to be concerned about moving to a particular city or cities to find them, or are there plenty of student film projects in any big city?
4. As a ""hobby"" actress, am I expected to have professional headshots (or headshots at all), prepared monologues, a résumé, and/or a demo reel for my applications/auditions?

This fall I will begin my last year in college. I'll have graduated from a four-year university with a degree in Theatre &amp; Interpretation with an acting concentration. Almost immediately after I graduate next May, I'll be moving out to LA to pursue a career in film and TV.

I've read an infinite amount of articles with actors telling their stories of waiting tables and the like to scrape by in LA until bigger things come their way. HOWEVER-- these articles almost never address how much harder things are if student loan repayment is also on the table (as I'm assuming many actors wisely forgo the ridiculously expensive four-year university route and move directly to LA and take classes there).

I am absolutely committed to following my passion for acting, and I am unquestionably moving to LA to pursue the art. That being said, can someone who perhaps has experienced this dilemma provide some insight as to what to expect financially (other than the obvious fact that I'm going to be inexplicably broke)? I know it is already hard enough to keep afloat as a beginning actor there; I want to know whether it is a death sentence for me to pursue acting so fully while I have approximately $20K in student loans to repay 6 months post-graduation.

I am currently 17 years old (18 in August). I've had my whole life figured out. I've been playing soccer since I was 5 years old and since then I've wanted to go to college to play soccer and recently decided to become a Psychologist while in college. I had a passion for soccer, I knew I would be able to go somewhere some day and I had the talent for it. I've even been invited by numerous colleges to play with them this summer.

There's just one problem.

In these past two weeks I discovered that I really, really, REALLY want to go into acting to be in films and maybe even TV series. No, it's not to be 'famous' or to be 'well known,' I want to do it because I feel I can act and have loads of fun with it. I know two weeks isn't that much, but I've never felt this way for anything before. I have more than just a passion for it. I want this to be my life.

To help, yes I've thought about this since I was 10 but really never got into detail about it or thought as much as I have these two weeks about what I want to do. Even growing up I always chose different personalities to 'play' around with my friends and make them laugh and I had so much fun doing it.

I know it's a huge turn from what I previously wanted to do and it's extremely stupid to change at the last moment, but I have never felt this way my whole life.

It is a semi-satirical over the top rock and roll band meant to embrace all the familiar trappings that rock and roll stands for, and to do that, I created a character.

The alter ego I came up with is named Truck Thunders, and he is a kind of hybrid of Lemmy Kilmister from Motorhead and Jesse Hughes from Eagles of Death Metal. Hard livin', skirt chasin', whiskey guzzlin'. You get the picture. I can play the role just fine on stage, but I'd like to remain in character in interactions with people throughout the whole night of a show, but I have no acting experience and don't know what to draw from.

I usually avoid these sort of things and try to set up auditions from more legitimate websites. But at his insistence I sent in my head shot and résumé.

A few days later I receive a text message saying I'm being considered among a group of people for a speaking role on another USA show, Burn Notice. They want to set up a conference call, which I agree to. However, I can't seem to get the name of who they're supposed to be representing, either a casting company or production company. 

I call in for the conference call and we talk to someone who is supposedly setting up the deal. There are several people who apparently applied through Craigslist. The guy gave his name and I took careful notes, so I could try and find out if this was for real or not later on. Everyone talked a little about their experience and if they had representation or not. The guy told us there would be a process of determining who would be right to appear on the show and if we were chosen they would fly us out to Miami where the show is shot.

He never mentioned anything about fees or having to pay for something, which is always a red flag, but it struck me as odd that though he identified himself by name, he never said he never gave a name for a company he represented. I stayed on the line afterwards and asked him who he worked with and he said something about an ""Actor's Resource."" Afterwards I didn't hear back from them again.

1372616418.0,8,self.acting,1hdjja,Acting is a passion of mine. But I can't decide where I should be if I want to grow. I need advice.,11,3,13,http://www.reddit.com/r/acting/comments/1hdjja/acting_is_a_passion_of_mine_but_i_cant_decide/,"A little bit of background about me: I'm 24, nearly 25. I went to a university in Washington State, graduated in 2011 with a BA in Theatre Arts. I was originally going to move up to Seattle but I had a girlfriend and decided to follow her elsewhere. That ended up being a terrible mistake, and I moved back to my parents' house in the Twin Cities a little over year ago. Since then, I have tried to keep busy. I have a day job as a barista, and in the meantime I've been in a couple plays and a short film, I've done a lot of improv, and I've taken a decent number of classes in both acting and improv. 

I want to move out of my parents' house soon. I have to spend a lot of time and gas driving between the metro area and the house in the north 'burbs, and that's made me feel very inert and distant from the action. The problem is, I'm feeling torn about where I should move.

Here are the options I'm choosing between:

1. Seattle. I actually made a point of telling my friends that I was planning to move there, but lately I've been having second thoughts. I have several fellow theatre majors from my school who have moved up there, and some of them are quite successful. The arts community there is a pretty decent size, I'm drawn to having such a large network of theatre folks there that I could immediately tap into. Unfortunately, my housing situation has been tenuous, and that's created some discouragement for me. Seattle can be a very expensive city to live in, and the housing market can be cutthroat; I worry that I will spend a large part of my time just trying to find a place to live and a job before I can dedicate more of my energy to being involved in the theatre community.

2. Minneapolis. This would be the easiest transition to make. The Twin Cities acting community is comparable to--and even a little bigger than--Seattle's. It's a bit more affordable to live here. I have a big interest in improv, and the community here is really growing. Also, though my network is still smaller than the one I have in Seattle, it's starting to mature a bit. The problem with this option, as well as Seattle, is that they're not...

3. LA/NY. I have a couple of connections in each of these places, and they are *typically* the cities to be in if you're an actor. But I worry that housing and affordability might be an even bigger nightmare than Seattle and Minneapolis combined. I know there are many, many people who face these challenges and can still pull it off, but regardless, it intimidates me.

I know that one day I would like to be a unionized actor. I'm just not sure when and how I'm going to get to that goal. I feel like I'm still quite inexperienced. I just can't decide if I should be accruing experience in a relatively smaller market like Seattle or Minneapolis, or if I should be bolder and cut straight to jumping in to New York or Los Angeles.

To get to the point, I don't know if it's just answers or personal experience I'm looking for with this post. I guess I'm also wondering, what are the right *questions* I should be asking myself?

I've been an actress for about two years, high school plays only. I've always dismissed the thought of continuing acting after school because I just didn't see it as sustainable, but recently it has been on my mind a lot and it's something I definitely don't want to give up.

Now, my plan for the future originally was to get a bachelor's and master's degree in computer sciences, but I've been taking into consideration studying acting (particularly musical) instead.

I've tried weighing the pros and cons, and the most prominent are probably the long-term job security on the one hand and doing what I really enjoy on the other hand. Even if I do study computer sciences, I will still continue doing acting as a hobby (acting workshops, semi-professional theatre groups/plays, maybe singing lessons), though.

Is it possible to get started with an acting career without a degree? It's just nice to know that even if it doesn't work out in the business, I still have a back-up plan (and it will probably greatly relieve my parents). But seeing as acting is what I actually want to do in my life, it just seems kind of like a waste to me to study something else entirely instead, if that makes sense.

I'm really torn between these two options, some opinions would be nice :)

Let me preface my question before I ask it. I just recently moved to Los Angeles with my family. The move wasn't for acting, but being in an area where acting is so prevalent was a bonus. Being with such a large pool of talent is such a double-edged sword for me, and forces the question that I am now asking you. As you may have already guessed, I'm young. I've been acting for a while, but this recent move has exposed me to how many people want the same thing as me, and how many are much better at it than me. Acting is my life, but it is now challenged by the problems I face (e.g. transitioning from stage to film, getting experience, worrying that I may not be good enough).

Through doing agent/manager nights in my acting class I was able to actually scoop up a manager and they've been getting me some actually pretty cool auditions since early February. Anywhoozle, they set me up for this audition of a music video. Had no idea who it was, just knew it was $500 a day for 2 days of work which, compared to my shitty counter restaurant job, sounded marvelous. 

So I'm waiting by the door of the audition room after having waited in a room with 15 other people for 45  minutes (while my car was being ticketed for $95 on a nearby Hollywood street...Weeoooh LA parking tickets!) and I hear the girl before me talking about what she had done in her career so far - guest spots on Revenge, Pretty Little Liars, One Tree Hill...etc. I'm basically thinking I'm fucked but nonetheless go in the room with a positive attitude and try to be as much like myself as possible in such a nerve-wracking situation. I tell them what I'd done and that I'm currently in a play and just basically shoot the shit. I told them an amusing story about how I had to do a makeout scene in my boxers while I had a raging boner and my grandma watching. They enjoyed my story and we shared some chuckles.

Fast forward a couple days, the director calls me and tells me he thinks I'm right for the job and I'm shocked as hell but excited. I meet him at his place and we talk a little and he confirms that he wants me for it. Anyway, it ends up being the greatest experience I've had so far on a shoot. Great costar, amazing food (since it was big budget...homies cooked STEAKS and there was so much amazing food that was always accessible) I felt like a prince for 48 hours. 

I later asked the director's assisstant (not sure what her actual title was) why I ended up getting it, they said I was one of more normal ones they saw and there were a surprising number of actors that just seemed a bit crazy. You always hear that people just wanna work with people they think they'll get along with for the duration of the shoot and this was such a prime example. She told me they also wanted a mixed couple, so the girl that auditioned before me just didn't end up getting it because she was white. Another example of the uncontrollable elements of casting that proves we should try our best to not get caught up in reasons why we didn't get a call back. 

So to all my acting homies here, let this maybe be a reminder to limit the amount of fretting, and when in doubt be yourself! Yes this will be tested in the future in so many ways and it's so easy to fall back on old patterns but maybe this can help. So yeah, that be my spiel.

I'm speaking on behalf of The Mix, a new theatre company based out of NYC, but with plans for performing across the US and Europe.

Our inaugural production of As You Like It is in its developmental stages and we're pretty proud of it. It's a brand new take on the play that we are sure has never been done, so we want to share it with the cool and attractive people of /r/theatre, /r/shakespeare, and /r/acting to see what they think about it.

The plan is simple: We'd like to perform As You Like It as you like it. That means we'll have three versions of the play ready to go and will perform one of them each night as chosen by the audience. Fun, right?

We hope a shameless plug for our Kickstarter wouldn't be out of line, so here's that: http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/themixtheatreco/the-mix-as-you-like-it?ref=live

If it was out of line, please disregard it and check out our website instead: www.themixtheatrecompany.com

If you have any questions about the show or our company, we'll try and keep up with this thread as best we can.

Love,

I'll preface with the answers to some questions I've seen in the past and a bit of back story...

The difference between the two Los Angeles Stella Adler schools is an important one, but often difficult to get to the root of due to ongoing litigation. Stella Adler, in her lifetime, founded two unaffiliated schools: one in New York, and one in Los Angeles (the one I attend, Stella Adler Academy of Acting). After her death, the board of directors in the New York campus wanted to join forces with the Los Angeles campus, and our board of directors in Los Angeles resisted for a number of reasons. The New York campus sought to remove the LA campus' Not For Profit status, which the present board of directors believed would be against Stella's wishes. Secondly, the New York school incorporates other techniques while Los Angeles is strictly Adler technique. It is for these reasons I chose the Stella Alder LA campus. In response, the New York campus erected a new Stella Adler campus in Los Angeles, the Stella Adler Art of Acting Studio, which I do not attend and will not be commenting on here. It is my understanding that there is ongoing litigation as the Academy of Acting is suing the Art of Acting studio regarding using Stella's name.

It is my third term at Adler, meaning I have been here for four months of the two year program. In this time, I have taken Technique I, II, and III (Stella Adler technique), Voice I, II, and III (based on Linklater approach), Movement I and II (based on Faye Simpson's guide for Physical Actors, ""The Lucid Body), Alexander Technique, Script Analysis, and Theatre History.

I have a feeling I'm being very spoiled here, however. That's why I chose to stick with the play. I'm not going to lie and say that I'm happy with my situation.

1. Be one you like and are comfortable doing.

2. Be no more than 2 min. in length. You will be given a time frame but it is always better to be under time than over, also they will be able to tell pretty quick if you have what they are looking for.

3. Make sure the text is appropriate for your age.

4. Be geared for the play/ character you are auditioning for.

5. Allow you freedom to move and make choices

6. Have a clear, identifiable, and specific objective.

7. Have a clear identifiable arc (beginning, middle, end)

8. Never mirror any emotional situation you are going through with the audition.

9. Always be active, make the monologues about your acting partner. Story monologues are hard to make about anyone but yourself.

10. Be found in in a variety of sources but avoid anything that has been a major release in the past 5 years, including currently running show. 

11. Be introduced with character, play, and author.

12. Never be given a synopsis. If you need one it is not a strong piece

13. Be chosen with consideration for who you will be auditioning for.

14. Allow you to show a part of who you are. 

15. Be played in an honest truthful way without the need to force emotion. 

16. Never cut one character out of a scene and force the audience to imagine the other character for the whole piece

17. Not need to rely on props or costumes

18. Have language and actions of consequence. Make sure it's worth doing.

19. Be well prepared, never ""winged"". Should be rehearsed 100 times.
 
20. Never use the person auditioning you as your acting partner. 

21. Not be self-written if you can't write dramatically.

22. Not require preparation in the room

23. Not be self-indulgent.

24. Every good rule is meant to be broken, just make sure you have a good reason to break it.

 I hear from a lot of them that drama school isn't for everyone. 

The general processes of a drama school, from what I hear (and obviously every drama school is different), is they brake you down as an actor, almost stripped bare to then be built back up. This works incredibly well for some actors, but others might have (without undermining the fundamental need to work at your craft) been more successful/a 'better' actor had the gone straight into industry and learned from experience be it tv/film work or with a rep/theatre company, such as the RSC (as again I have other friends for which this is also proved fruitful).

I know that a part of this is that I haven't studied as many of the physical acting disciplines as I need to (like Alexander technique and Suzuki), but I've known that it's been a bit bigger of a problem than that for a while now.

But I think I've had a major personal breakthrough in my understanding of developing a character which will help my movement, and I wanted to share it all with you in case it was helpful to anyone else and to get critical feedback.

What's holding me back as an actor is I'm over-complicating and underplaying my characters. I understand objective and tactic easily - they are such familiar concepts to me that I could read this into scripts well before I had begun acting and before I had words for these concepts. So naturally, I assumed that objective and tactic must be so obvious to the audience that I didn't want to bore them by overplaying it. Instead, I tried to develop interesting and unexpected tactics that a person might not immediately see in the script, and I focused on complex facets of my character's life and found hints in the language about what those complexities were and used the delivery of that language to bring that out. I think I'm good at creating a character that has depth, but I struggle with creating an *interesting* character, which I feel is a very different thing.

In my daily life, intentional, clear, meaningful language is almost always the vessel of my ""tactic"" - accurate and subtle language is how I get what I want. I rarely exaggerate or overplay my language and actions, preferring a stoic quiet attitude so that the subtle meaning of my words isn't overshadowed. So this is my natural direction when I'm acting - I try not to overplay the words, I try to let them speak for themselves, and I limit my body movements in order to highlight the language. This is why I table-read very fucking well but when I start blocking rehearsals I really struggle.

But on the other hand, if I play tactic and objective obviously in a very overhanded manner then I *would* be talking down to the audience.

My solution, then, is to find interesting ways to portray and to implement these objectives and tactics. Instead of focusing on *what* the Objectives and Tactics are - which is just wasting my energy because I understand all that stuff really quickly anyway - I need to focus all my energy on depicting the Objective and Tactic in fresh, insightful, interesting, unexpected, and real ways.

I might be clear and intentional with my language, but my character probably isn't. What things do they have a hard time saying? When they say, ""I don't want a dog,"" what are they not saying? Maybe, ""Because I don't expect us to be living together much longer."" In what ways is their language NOT what they mean to say? When language is failing, how do they use their body to communicate meaning? How do they get what they want when the stakes are high? Do they emotionally manipulate? Do they dominate and intimidate? How are they using their own emotion to illicit an interaction from another person? How are they asking too much from their scene partners? How are they betraying them? How are they betraying themselves?

How are they not like me at all.

When I write it out, it seems so basic that it's almost laughable, but I think that I'm letting my own personality and my assumptions about how people *should* use language influence the way that my character actually *does* use language.",,False,self,t5_2qyft,False,,,True,t3_1ikxpp,http://www.reddit.com/r/acting/comments/1ikxpp/theory_i_just_had_a_huge_aha_moment_and_possible/,

Plainly, my question is: what should I look for when trying to find an acting studio? I tried one on Saturday night, but I'm not sure it was how an acting studio should be. Let me lay it out for you.

First, the class was free, because all first classes are free, then it's $265 a month to use the studio + weekly classes from 7-11pm. 

However, some things I noticed..

1. The instructor gabbed a lot about life in general and a lot of things not really related to acting. She spoke about her son getting into trouble at school, how her husband has an eye for color, and various other things related to her home. This took up, I'd say about an hour of the class.

2. I recited a monologue, then acted in a scene with 3 others. However, I received no feedback whatsoever on what to improve on, what was terrible, what was good, etc. We did the scene, she said ""okay, good"" and then moved on to some theater ""games."" 

The only thing I ""learned"" was putting actions and beats into monologues, finding internal things and not so much focusing on myself only. For example, she spoke about how the internal goal of the scene would be to ""make you feel bad for hurting me"" instead of a goal of ""Your character is hurt."" That's about all I learned in 4 hours.

For those of you more experienced in this, what should I look for in an acting studio, because I don't think this is how a more professional studio operates. If I'm paying over $250 a month, I want the instruction tailored to my needs as much as possible.

I am 17 and I'm performing in my school's production of Hairspray!. If you don't know about Hairspray!, the moral is accepting people who are different no matter their size or race.

I got one of the lead roles, Seaweed. Seaweed's romantic interest is Penny. For some reason that our directors won't explain, they cast two different girls on the show to perform to alternate shows. They both act, sing, and dance differently but very well.

One of them is one of my close friends and she and I have more stage-chemistry because we've played husband and wife in our last two shows. She and I are able to add more provocative humor in the way that we interact and say our lines and it's been pointed out by many people that it looks better that way. 

The other Penny is only 14 and we have performed together once in completely unrelated roles. She doesn't like any of the ways that I act with the first Penny and doesn't have the same chemistry. Our directors have the view of ""I'll give you the blocking and you can do whatever you want"" approach so they don't say anything about it.

Should I just learn perform differently each night? Any advice?

So I just had an audition for a rep company today, doing both musicals and straight plays.  And they asked me to come to their dance call.  This will be the first time I've been asked to a dance call in my career

Now, musicals are what I want to do, and I do have some moderate ability in dance (I'm a big guy, but I can move!).  That said, in previous shows, I usually learn dances pretty slowly.  I do ultimately learn them fairly well, but its a longer process for me.  

So, I'm wondering if anyone has tips on ways to get through the call without completely making a fool of myself.

He is from Texas, however he is pretending to be from New York.

I want to feel confident with this character - any tips for developing him? So far, I have written in a notebook which had all the information we learn of him from the play and the book so I have an idea of the background and intentions of the character, as well as going through my lines dozens of times and finding what actions and tone of voice fit the character best. I've also looked at Andrew Scott in Sherlock and I have watched Citizen Kane for influences, however I don't feel entirely confident yet.

I have some friends who are not professional actors doing the job. Other members of the cast are professional actors. But there is one in particular that is not very fond of the proyect. For a bunch of reasons, I can't replace him. But he is not doing a good job, he delivers his lines as if they were stupid, like it was a cheap drama, not believable at all.

He is not a bad actor, but he is giving me a hard time. 

Other members of the cast may not be that good but they are trying and doing a somewhat satisfying job.

How do actors (and non actors) like to be approached? How can I inspire him?

Just need some advice. Thank you.",,False,self,t5_2qyft,False,,,True,t3_160fxw,http://www.reddit.com/r/acting/comments/160fxw/on_directing_nonprofessional_actors/,

I am 25 years old, male and living in Germany right now, but I thought that if I wanted to fish, I might as well fish in the big pond and move to London in a few months.

So far I acted in a few local plays and worked as an extra here and there, and most recently got my hands on a tiny little role in an indie feature film, so I have a little experience with film sets.

I've always considered my English pretty decent, but I'd like to immerse myself in the language and then start auditioning for roles.

Do you think this is a smart move to make? As an EU-resident, I think I have pretty much the same rights as British citizens, but I'm not too sure of that.

Of course I'd need to sustain myself by working on the side or even full-time, until I can make a living off of acting. Maybe I'd even apply to RADA and the other big schools, I don't know yet.

Do you have any advice for me? Is it possible to make a living in London without having a degree at all? 

A friend from Liverpool told me that people pay well for language tutoring, which I already do on the side for fun. He was talking about 1500£ in the two weeks leading up to exams and half of that on a steady basis. 

Do you think this is realistic? Anything else I'd want to consider?

I've never told anyone about it, never have tried it, and I've never verbally acted anything in my lonesome. It's just something that I've always thought was an awesome career and seemed interesting to me.  



Anyways, just some personal stuff in brief. I'm currently on my second year of attending college and I've been doing the absolute WORST I've ever done in my academic history. I'm a smart kid, I know I am, but a mix of depression and anxiety has been holding me back from reaching my potential. I've talked to friends and a counselor who have been in the same situation I'm in and they've all recommended taking a semester to a year off. That's what I'm going to do.  


That being said, I need something other than my mediocre job to fill my time. I've played sports and I'm an avid guitar player, but I wanna get out of my comfort zone a bit. I wanna treat this year off as a time of self-discovery and trying new things to broaden my perspective. So I thought, hell, why not give acting a shot. However I'm still skeptical. I ""suffer"" from social anxiety. There have been times in the past where I've failed a class completely just because I was too afraid to give an oral presentation in front of my class. I'm not really an awkward person, but I can't stand being in the spotlight and *luckily* for me that's what acting is all about, being put front and center.  



A few questions I have:

1. Do you think it's not even worth giving it a shot taking into consideration my social anxiety? Will it help alleviate my anxiety?

2. I'm a decent/young looking 20 year old that lives about an 1.5hr from LA. Any places you would recommend I check out? (I'm not really swimming in the dough.)

3. How do I even get started? What do I do? This is really just a shot in the dark for me.

I brought in a scene from Rumors by Neil Simon a few weeks ago, the Glenn and Cassie argument scene. Well, today in class he said ""Hey, I looked over that scene (he had never read the play before) and I don't think you should do it, since it's about two married adults."" I brought up that I thought he was okay with that since a lot of the final scenes from Acting I last semester (taught by him) were like that, and he replied with ""Yeah, but you're definitely more of a younger type actor. You need to take advantage of that, it's a good thing.""

As far as schools go what should I look for? Does it make a difference if I go for a bfa, mfa, or if I just take a conservatory program? The conservatory had almost all of the same classes with a few different ones that are focused on stage acting, only it doesn't involve getting a degree in the end. If I'm getting the same experience does it matter? (I only ask because the bfa and mfa classes are usually in LA)

I'm dying.,8,0,17,http://www.reddit.com/r/acting/comments/11yuck/im_having_trouble_working_with_a_girl_who/,"     I am working in a group with her and one other girl. She is constantly overacting, and I cannot handle it any more. She's new to our program while the rest of us have been in it for a year. I think she's just trying really hard to be a good actress and fit in with the rest of us. This time last year, I was doing pretty much exactly what she is now. I really want to help her get better, but I fear it will come off as preachy or angry. I tried giving subtle hints like ""Yo, stop saying exactly what you feel with ridiculous hand gestures. It ain't needed bro."" She never really caught on. 
     I want to approach her about her performance skills because I think she can do much better, and she is just putting on a show. I need advice on how to do this without blowing one of my gaskets slash being preachy. Even whether it's my place to approach her, or if I should just let the teacher deal with it. I'm confident our teacher will eventually crack down on her because she got all of the rest of us in order, but it wasn't pleasant. There may or may not have been some tears shed. I'm looking to spare this girl from that pain. 
     Just for some background, I'm in a highschool theatre program. It's fairly serious: ideally, we end up working in theatre for the rest of our lives. This is one project, so I'm not too worried about whether it's fantastic or not but I'm at a breaking point with her, and she's affecting my performance. 

     When I say 'overacting' I mean she's very, very exaggerated. That's great for certain styles, but right now we're focused on realism. In person, she's fairly reserved, quite calm. Sometimes she gets excited but she's not got an over-the-top personality. When she acts, for any character at all, they all feel like caricatures because she's got her hands moving all over the place, she's very loud, she states exactly what she feels all the time. It's very boring, and a little irritating.",,False,self,t5_2qyft,False,,,True,t3_11yuck,http://www.reddit.com/r/acting/comments/11yuck/im_having_trouble_working_with_a_girl_who/,

It started in pre production when I went against everyones casting advice and cast in my mothers friends daughter, because her life was very similar to the character I had written.

At the time I just thought she was really quirky and perfect because I wanted someone who was genuinely strange. I thought it would add authenticity to the role. Well she acted the part beautifully, but over the weeks became really distant and hard to talk to. I can almost pinpoint when it was in the middle of a scene she kind of just wandered away and got really non responsive, and she was never the same after that.

To get to the chase, we still had a couple weeks to go, and she starts being totally oblivious. She'd start acting then just walk off set and begin poking me then start punching me. Or she would start to shout nonsense and throw things. I thought we could roll with it and it almost became like a joke all the things she did on camera, and we all thought it was just fun and games. Now I realize I was exploiting her. 

The last day we filmed she started breaking down, throwing things and pretending she was her character and accusing me of all kinds of crap. So I decided to call it a day and that she needed a break. I dropped her off at her parents house and promised I would make it up to her, but after that she disappeared.

When I say she disappeared, she disappeared. We had no clue where she was and her parents didnt either. I cancelled the whole movie and destroyed the footage because I felt ashamed about what I did. I did not give her the support she needed. I did not do a good job letting her separate reality from make believe and I feel responsible for contributing to her breakdown. It was like I kept pushing and pushing her and she didnt want to go there, but I gave her no choice. 

Well that was last year. Today I heard from my mom that she has been in an institution and on medication, and is moving back in with her parents soon. She apparently has multiple personality disorder and schizophrenia. So I really hope that she is not permanently scarred from what I did to her. I was thinking of reaching out and apologizing but I decided I do not want to bring back any memories of what we did on that shoot for fear of hurting her any further.",,False,self,t5_2qyft,1373954027.0,,,True,t3_1ie9h8,http://www.reddit.com/r/acting/comments/1ie9h8/a_horror_story_with_my_actress/,

Background: I did some acting in high school plays and things like that and would like to get back into it. I've been in heaps of performances with the glee club at my university so I have performing experience, but not much acting experience. I've been in a music video and a commercial as an extra, and I'm currently taking acting lessons. I'm Chinese, early 20s, female and live in New Zealand.

My main focus now is getting as much experience as possible. I'm going to start auditioning for community theatre and I'm doing a short film festival next month. My goal is speaking roles on tv and films though. 

So far, all the agencies I've been to are really keen on signing me as a talent (tv ads, etc) because I have the ""look"" that is really popular for ads (I have bright red hair and pretty much look like a hipster). I'm not sure if this is the right way to go though as they may not want to take me seriously when I want to progress into serious acting. Should I take more classes, get more acting experience and try to get signed as an actor instead?

Also I'm not sure if it's better to go for a big agency with lots of connections, or a small agency where you're more likely to get noticed. For example, there's a big agency who represent about 4000 people (the population of NZ is 4.4 million so that's a LOT) and are really well known for representing Asians. There's also a very small new agency who are interested in me, where I'd be the only Asian person. 

Also, I know I should change up my appearance to a more ""natural"" look. Is the stereotypical Asian look more advantageous? I really don't suit black hair and my overall appearance and style isn't very Asian. Would this be a problem?

I've been researching all night but so far, I'm extremely overwhelmed. I've always been a musicals/singer type of gal and have been to numerous auditions for roles of that sort (no agent - just open auditions) - but I was truly inspired by some of the films that came out this past year and I really think that this is something I want to pursue.

Currently, I attend school for illustration in Rochester, New York; however, my home is New York City (which I know, it's weird that I went so far away for art haha) so I'm always here when not at school. Traveling home is not a problem for me. However, no one in my family know's anything about acting or the arts. I'm pretty much the only one interested in this sort of lifestyle (as in, the no-guarantee where I'll end up next sort of thing).

I guess, I'm just looking for some ""where to go first"" sort of direction with this. I read all the posts, I got the jist of one needs acting classes, headshots, demo reel, things of that sort. Because my school is very into film production and us art majors like to help each other out, this isn't a problem for me. But the agent thing - that's a whole new world for me and something I don't quite understand.

I tried looking up agent directories/reviews/etc. but sometimes, there's no contact information or it seems like they're the place where they find you, you don't go looking for them. See, for me, that's not ideal because of my look: 20 yr old, caucasion/middle eastern female that's too short to model, too tall to be of notice/completely average in particular and doesn't stand out in a crowd in NYC. So how do I go about getting an agent? Where do I go first for this thing? And as a starving artist, is there anywhere I can look that will help me out with this for very little money?

I know I'm probably getting way ahead of myself, but I get really passionate about things and I like to have a plan or a direction of where to go first. 



Also... one of my very best friend's father (he lives out in California) was a supporting lead in a very popular 80's movie and had many 90's hit classics. Currently, he does a lot of guest starring on tv shows. However, he lives out in California now and whenever he comes to visit, it's always to spend time with his son. I don't want to feel like I'm intruding on his life so I wanted to know if it would be rude if I asked him a little about how he got started and where he suggested I go first? Should I email him about this? (I'm friends with him on facebook lol) or ask his son for me or... something of that sort? I know people always say connections in this industry are good to have but I don't want him to think I'm taking advantage of him.


Thanks for any and all advice you can give me, r/acting. It's more than appreciated (:

I'm currently in an amdram production of 'Gormenghast', one of the weirdest plays I've ever heard of.

The play follows the life of my character, Titus Groan, as he rebels against the traditions he's been born into as the 77th earl of Gormenghast. This means I have to play the character at various stages of his life, from 7, to 14, to a slightly older teen, to a young man.

So far rehearsals have gone well, but my director keeps asking me for more arrogance in my performance. My problem is, I'm struggling to find a way of showing this that doesn't just come across as the stereotypical angst ridden teenager.

  So, I'm a 17 y/o actor with a non-profit theater company for youth who stutter (think The King's Speech, Porky Pig, etc.). We do a lot of different things during the year, but it all orbits around acting. We've put out some [awesome things](http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_detailpage&amp;v=ZUSOzY2YB00)  (I'm the kid in the fedora   who is intimidated by the love interest girl), and I've directed TV/theater actors in a theater performance, and I've all around had the acting mindset. I love it, I love playing dark, broken, and cold characters. I'm fascinated to see just how low someone can go. Acting isn't my chief love (I'm a photography major), but it moves me for sure. 

Problem is, I have a *wicked* stutter. I cannot say a sentence without stuttering severely 99% of time, literally. And it isn't a cute b-b-butterfly stutter either. It's like [this](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sfLHojgVYtk); I don't do the movements anymore, but on a bad day I can be this disfluent (I swear that's a word), and even worse (if I absolutely cannot change a word, I can be stuck for 30 seconds). I can control it when I need to, but not when I'm in character. Speaking Loud + Stuttering = Fucking Shit. 

Could I ever act? I wouldn't mind being the typecast ""stutterer"" forever, could that work? I can hardly say ""hmm.. Put a stutter right..H-HERE."" I know that acting with a bunch of fellow stutterers is not the same as acting with a cast of otherwise fluent actors. Heck, I'd even do silent films, if those are a thing anywhere. I would prefer to talk, though. 

**TL;dr** I have a very, very severe stutter. Are there roles where I could still act?

This is the description the website has for him.

HARRY ROAT, JR.: Very creepy man. Think Javier Bardem in “No Country For Old Men”. He lived through the beatnik era and never emerged. Only interested in himself and will do anything to further his lust for drugs and money. He plays himself and two other characters in this play. His real name is not Harry Roat. He plays Harry Roat Jr and Senior as part of the con. We know that he is capable of murder. We should be afraid of him but also surprised by him.


I've been trying to add in laughter in his lines. I've been making weird facial gestures. I swing from emotion to emotion (Happy, Sad, Angry). I act comforting when the lines are threatening. I mouth words in between lines and my jaw hangs open sometimes. 

Are there any other steps any of you would suggest for someone attempting this part? I'm really thinking along the lines of The Joker from ""The Dark Knight"".

Edit: Don't know who will see this. I put down that I wanted Roat as a specific role and the director never gave me a chance to act as him. I also did not make call backs. I talked to the director after and she said she would give me a shot at reading as Roat on callbacks.

I've got a dilemma I could use some advice for.

- I really don't have any recorded material, having come from a sparse theater background.

Instincts question:

- A 'casting director' who I submitted to on Mandy was asking me for a reel and I admitted freely that I don't yet have one, but my schedule is wide open for auditions. The director's reply was that they could offer to shoot a reel for me for a fee as a favour. I did some Google snooping &amp; didn't find the results/quality promising, so I'm turning down the offer.

I'm going into high school as a Freshman this coming year, and I've decided I'm dead-set on becoming an actor when I get out. 
Yes, I know. I know.
I've heard it all.
""Show-business is VERY hard to get in to!""
""There's probably a million other kids just like you who want the same thing, and where are they now?""
etc, etc...

But, as of now, I'm willing to do everything in my power to get me to where every single one of those kids failed to get to.

Here's what I've done so far, acting-wise:

4th grade musical: Ebeneezer Scrooge in ""A Christmas Carol""

5th grade musical: Brown-Beard in ""Pirates! The Musical""

6th grade musical: Cogsworth in ""Beauty &amp; the Beast JR.""

7th grade musical (combined with high-school): Enjolras in ""Les Miserables""

8th grade musical (Also combined with high-school, and is my most recent): Albert Peterson in ""Bye Bye Birdie""


Honestly, right now I don't care if it's on-screen or theatre, because either seems like it'd be amazing (Although, I guess another option is Opera, because my singing teacher, whom I started with in December, is an opera singer, and the moment she heard me sing in my operatic style [which I used for Les Mis], she stopped me and said I have ""A God-given gift"" and I ""need to use it"").

Anyways, I'm looking to everyone out there who can help me with this (e.g. Give me practices I could do daily to help develop my skills; Suggest different acting-related activities for me to get involved in; Give me advice, etc., etc.).

But when the topic came to acting and ""making it"" in the business, he claimed a few things were true about the business side of acting in LA:

1. You need to drink. An order of a 7&amp;7 or a Jack &amp; Coke is considered respectable. Apparently, many meetings (with agents, managers, casting directors, and directors, I'm assuming) are over a beer. I'm not sure if smoking is part of the deal, but I hope it's not.

2. The supposed myth that Hollywood is run by Jews is apparently not a myth. If you're not Jewish, your chances of making it in Hollywood are diminished greatly. I asked him if it was because the Jewish community knows each other or whether they would just hire you on account of you being Jewish, and he claimed it's both. He said an alternative to not being Jewish would be to do a lot of kissing up.

3. You need to have a stage name that rolls off the tongue. (Is that even true, though? I mean, we have people these days like Jake Gyllenhaal who are incredibly successful.)

I don't drink or smoke in real life (I'll simulate drinking on film, but not smoking). I'm like Clint Eastwood in that regard. So I ask of you, LA/NY seasoned actors/people in the business, based on everything that my friend said, how much would you say is true?

I am going to be portraying the character of Marius in Les Misérables in a couple of weeks. I've been in love with the show for a half a year, so this is a dream come true.

A bit of background on myself, I got involved in theatre about a year ago in an original musical written by a friend. I started listening to shows and singing along, developing my abilities to sing in the style of a certain character. About 6 months after that, I took an acting class. Like, 8 classes once a week. Since then I've been a part of three musicals (all of which I've played leads for), and a few dinner theatre shows.  

Other than those short weeks of acting classes, I have no other training experience. Just in the shows I've been in, and reading stuff online.  

So I was wondering if there was any advice you could give me as far as analyzing my script and/or character. Right now, the singing is all great and very in-character, but when I'm not singing and I'm in a scene (most of the time except my solo) I don't know what to do (cafe scenes for instance). I don't know how to *become* Marius to make him more believable, which I really want to do (like I said, dream come true. I want to be proud of my work).  

Again, I have two weeks to work on this. Any advice, reading suggestions, exercises, whatever you have will be really appreciated.

If you don't already know, this business is based heavily on networking and friendships. But if your a new or baby actor, how do you do this?! 

Well, I have found that one of the best ways to get on a casting directors good side, is to offer to be their reader for auditioning actors. Now, if you've just finished auditioning for them, I wouldn't offer your services then, but send an email offering yourself as a reader for any future auditions. This way, when you are in the room, you can develop a relationship with them that isn't based on you trying to get them to cast you in something. The pressure is off.

I did this, and because of it while I was reading with someone, the Casting Assistant asked me to audition for a series regular part in a t.v show. BOOM, I'm in, or you're in.

However don't go into every reading trying to get the part, this isn't a guaranteed way to get auditions, just something that could always have the potential to help you out down the line.

Sadly there is no right answer. While there is a safer route, there is also the preferred route. When people scoff at our field, they don't understand the amount of work that goes into doing it properly. When family says you should reconsider your job, they are only doing so with your interest in mind. One cannot fault people for the way that they see things. That being said, remember that there is no easy way to this field, other than through perseverance. Doubts are normal, but it's the vision in the end that should suppress your doubt. If this is truly your calling, don't forget it. Don't let others tell you otherwise. If you see for yourself that this is not the route for you, then options will present themselves to you later on. However like anything else, you won't know unless you truly give it a shot. I know this is sort of a rant, however after constantly talking to people that look down on my choice, I felt the need to tell others in the same boat that there is no reason to feel bad or regret your decision. Be proud of your decisions, and remember that this is our craft, and like any craft, the only way to get better is to work at it.

I know studying anywhere, be it a university or a studio in New York, will cost a lot of money and leave me with a bit of debt, but I feel like studying at a studio in New York where I can completely focus on my acting (and in the meantime audition for real world work) will cost a lot less money than spending three more years at a state university studying acting *plus* tons of academics I don't really need.  I feel like it is also more practical.  

But then there is my boyfriend, and I really love him and don't want to leave him.  

Also, please don't give me the speech about how academics at universities are ""something you just have to work through/just get it over with"".  I have heard that way too much.

So, here's where I am so far. I've performed in high school plays (the lead in two of them) been an internet dj, done a shit ton of public speaking, and these past few months, finally got to do some Amateur Dramatics that was professionally produced.

The play was a two parter, and I got quite a lot of praise for my performance from audience members (One woman came back to the second performance specifically because of me, apparently) so I really don't feel like I'm wasting my time with acting.

But here's the thing. I watch 'Inside The Actor's Studio' and I feel like a sham. Here are these people doing three years studying in the best school in the US, and here I am thinking I'm an actor just because I did a tiny play in a tiny theatre in London.

I'm 25 year old guy, and my original plan was to travel back to Toronto. I lived there last year for a year, and made some quite interesting contacts that I feel semi confident might be able to get me further towards getting representation, portfolio pieces etc. 

But should that be my focus? Should I instead stay in the UK, and spend years trying to get into a drama school here? I had this idea that studying on my own, in classes when I can afford it, and actually ACTING either on stage or on camera, would be an appropriate equivilant, but after watching Actor's Studio, I'm not so sure.

Ultimately, what do you guys recommend as my next step? I'm poor, but desperate to improve my craft, become a professional actor, and earn a living as an actor.

Recently, I have found myself growing frustrated with the progression of my career. Im about a year and a half out of school, and have been very fortunate with what I have been able to do since graduation. The lead in a fringe show, getting EMC status, and credits at two of the top tier theaters in my regional market. 

However, recently things seem to have not been going as well. Every audition that I have gone on, I have been getting called back for, and yet I haven't booked anything in nearly 2 months. I find myself frustrated with the infrequency of auditions and the seemingly highly politicized casting process (Casting 27-32 year olds in Spring Awakening because they have decent resumes, but couldn't pass for high schoolers if their life depended on it) here. 

So I have been thinking more and more about NYC, as I want to focus on stage primarily. However, is 4-6 regional credits and EMC status enough to get people to pay attention to you? I have tried to do a number of open calls, and it seems that many of them are formalities at this point, as the regular cast is almost always under contract before they even take place. Obviously, representation is the way to break the cycle, but do I have a realistic shot at someone taking an interest without investing 5+ years in the regional markets before that happens? Is it possible to build a credible resume in NYC without full union status or an agent? How does one continue to climb the ladder when work is scarce? 

Any stories or experiences that you guys could share would be really appreciated. If you want to see examples of my work or a headshot or something I can also provide that.

I'm a senior in high school at the time of this writing, applying to CMU in the fall. I would like to ask if any of our 2000 member community is an alumni / applying to a college / would like help in general. I'll outline everything I've been preparing / bring to the table in this post: 

DISCLAIMER: I don't have headshots. The photography studio for my senior pictures have taken them, but I'm waiting for them to become available to me. I'll get them up ASAP. 

BIGGER DISCLAIMER: I'm not bragging in any way shape or form. I'm simply putting all I have on the table. Please forgive anything that sounds snobby. 

Experience: I've done 4 high school musicals, 8 straight plays ( including 2 shakespeare ) , and I sing on a semi-professional level ( not bragging, but to really stress my vocal skill, which is my focal point. I've taken lessons for 4 years now, have an award for being a male vocalist in Kiss Me Kate, and I've been told by judges, professional singers, and even a current broadway performer that I have an outstanding voice ) I have absolutely no  dance experience, but I am reasonably flexible, so as of tomorrow, I will be taking weekly private dance lessons. I've also done two shows, one a featured role, the other a lead with a professional theatre company.

Special skills: I have 3 years of piano lessons behind me, and I've played on my own by ear 5 years after that. I'd say my skill on a piano is on a high basic / intermediate level. I also know basic accordian and extremely basic gutair. I am learning to juggle, and at the moment, I can volley 3 balls about 20 times. I also have 3 years of tri-athlete training, so I'm in good shape, and have decent endurance. 

Academics: I believe for Carnegie Mellon theatre department, academics and talent are mutually exclusive, but regardless, I am 9th in my class of 3-4 hundred. I have taken 4 AP courses, taking 2 more, and run a 1900 SAT score, which hopefully will be brought up to a 2150 by october. I am eligible for an national AP award, and am a member of National honor society, and french honor society. I hold 3 varsity pins for swimming. Besides drama I am a member of ecology club and an exchange student acclimation program. Community service is bolstered with free concerts I provide for retirement homes, and whatever happens in ecology club ( picking up trash ) I also was awarded ( but never received ) the HOBY award in my school for 2011.  

Preparataion for the audition: 

I've been doing alot of thinking as to what I can do for my audition...it requires 2 songs, one up beat, one ballad, monologues, and do a pick up dance routine. 

The song's I've been thinking of are 

Hello Little Girl ( from into the Woods ) and either If I Can't Love Her (Beauty and the Beast) or Santa Fe (Newsies). I've been practicing the former 2 for a while prior to my writing, and have recently picked up Santa Fe. 

As for the monologues, I've been at a complete loss. I've always had several Petruchio monologues stached, as well as Edmund's ""stand up for the bastards "" speech tucked away, as well as a Sam Shepard monologue I've been learning, but I feel I need something more, upbeat. I'm not really sure. 

So again, I hope I don't sound like I'm bragging, I'm sincerely terrified and want to know what I should be doing, or any additional advice. Thank you in advance, reddit :)

1346665292.0,6,self.acting,z9vii,at a crossroads:,7,1,14,http://www.reddit.com/r/acting/comments/z9vii/at_a_crossroads/,"this could get a bit lengthy:  

i am in my late twenties, a couple weeks from getting married in fact, and i have an opportunity to take a job that would pay well (i imagine 70k to 80k), but command a great deal of my time - essentially 9 to 5, five days a week.  

i'm trying to decide if i should bail on theater, and move up in my company, or retain my position, night audit shift, and keep plugging away.  

to be fair, i'm not the best at going to large casting calls, because i'm non-equity, and i've wasted many a day hanging around to only not be seen after 6 or so hours.  i do have emc status, but as you likely well know, this only ensures me a spot in front of the non-union types.

i have been working for the past year or so with an off off bway company, and am a member of their resident acting company.  i have endeared myself enough to the AD that i'm sure if they're looking for a character that fits my type (and even is willing to cast me grossly against my type at my own suggestion (playing a 60 y/o woman this june)) i'm at the top of their list.  

so far, my experiences with theater in nyc have not conflicted with anyone working a 9 to 5.  i thought by working overnight my schedule would be a strength - essentially i'm free all day and night until 11pm or so... in fact i find that due to the majority of other folks working 9 to 5 i tend to be the problematic actor in the room regarding scheduling.  i only mention this because it wouldn't restrict me from continuing my relationship with this particular theater group, and i wouldn't be completely bereft of theater in my life, and in fact if a bigger show, or production came along through this company, we'd be working around whatever my work schedule would be.  so there's that.  

however, the new position would certainly restrict my openness to pursue other projects, and my ability to do so without abandon.  

due to financial needs, i'm not really able to travel for theater work - and new york city is a fine community to which to be bound - so i'm used to only having nyc as a place for prospective work.  

i have, in my mind, resolved to try and take a few more classes with casting directors in the coming months, post honeymoon, and a few other upcoming conflicts, to try and get in front of a camera.  i worked on a film a year ago that ought to be close to finished, but i have no current reel, and that's my next objective.  i don't sing or dance, so musicals aren't really my bag - kudos to you if you've the knack/discipline, it wasn't something i was exposed to, and so i don't pursue it.  

bear in mind: i'm not an idiot, i knew this was going to be an uphill battle - i didn't get into acting to become famous - in fact i'd love to work regionally, and i think a successful actor, is self sufficient, doesn't need to work a money job and might make 50k in a good year.  however, as i'm not generating any income currently, maybe i could use four or more years in an office to build up a savings, pay off my debts, and then give things another go while working with smaller companies on the side.  while i'm not sure that i'd be completely comfortable with the idea of bailing on a company that took a risk on a dude with a bfa in acting, especially since i may have a kid to worry about by that time, but it's an option - when am i really going to have an opportunity to move up again? 

essentially i'm trying to give all of you an idea of my experiences, which are budding, in regards to theater work, and virtually non-existent on film - but we're working to recitify that - and give you the opportunity to weigh the decision against the comforts attached to a larger paycheck, better job title, and executive experience in a successful nyc hotel.  

tl;dr 
do i stop pursuing theater full time to devote myself to taking a stable position with good pay, or keep on slogging away at my night job hoping for some kind of a break on the theater end?

When I turned 19 I moved out to Irvine CA with some friends to get closer to LA. I'd wanted to do acting since I could remember. I've done lots of theater in my hometown and was ecstatic at the chance to get down to SOCAL.  

Fast forward a year and I've gotten into LA, a small apartment in North Hollywood working at a Tech Support company to pay the bills. I was working about 10 hours a day with weekends off and (at the time) Wasn't able to get my schedule worked around to do auditions, not to mention I had no idea how to get into anything in the first place. 

I had an aunt at the time, who was already in the business on daytime television (Read: Soap Operas). She was able to get me a few extra spots on a soap and it was incredible. But that's when everything died off. I lost my job and apartment and ended up living in my car for a while. My ""aunt"" was no longer my aunt due to a divorce in the family and things were rough. 

Eventually I got into a great situation. Pretty much a perfect situation. All of my bills paid for and extra spending money to boot, with nothing but free time. And I squandered it. I ended up learning how to produce music instead of following my original dream. 

Fast forward again and I'm back in central California, modesto /stockton area. I've got a wife and a child and a steady job working at a video game store. But the dream is still there, always in the back of my mind.

Every time I see a great movie, play a video game with really solid voice acting, it hits me like a ton of bricks. I end up getting depressed and just revisiting the mistakes I made. I always tell myself, that ship has sailed, but there is still a tiny shred of the dream left that I don't think will ever leave. Especially when I see old acquaintances on TV. That's the real killer for me.


Which brings me into my question. There isn't really a great scene for acting where I live. The only notable thing to come out of my town is George Lucas. From what I remember, the best bet is to get into an acting hub. Unfortunately, up and relocating my family like that is going to be damned near impossible. Is there something I can do ? Am I out of luck ? I've started talking with some friends out here about doing some youtube shorts, but in the long run is that really going to get me what I'm looking for ?

TL;DR I'm stuck in the middle of central california with no easy way to relocate. Am I SOL ? ",,False,self,t5_2qyft,False,,,True,t3_r7xlv,http://www.reddit.com/r/acting/comments/r7xlv/i_still_hold_the_dream_of_acting_but_im_nowhere/,

I'm an actor, stand-up comedian and writer desperately clawing at an acting career in New York City. 

I've recently launched an Indiegogo campaign for a webseries I've written (with a producer attached!) called ""An Actor Unprepared"" that I'd love to tell you about-or just watch the video @:

http://www.indiegogo.com/projects/an-actor-unprepared/x/3924967  

Depending on which side of the table you're on, An Actor Unprepared is an unfortunately hilarious drama or a midly depressing comedy from the unprepared mind of Gianmarco Soresi.

I know what you're thinking...

Another web-series from an embittered 20-something about how screwed up his niche industry is?

Yes.

But this one's funny, I swear.

An Actor Unprepared takes an honest look at the disasterious, glorious, incestuous, magical business of show business, which there's no business like. That was an Annie Get Your Gun reference, yes. From auditioning, to bringer shows, to agents, to pay to plays, to headshots, to branding, to exercise, to worthless BFA's, to potential homelessness, to inconvenient funerals, to unssuportive grandmothers, to existential crisises bolstered by the constant need to remind everyone of your existence and so on...we're covering the whole gamut.

If I can reach my goal, Rainsworth Productions will match what I make and we will film the pilot and several shorts. 

Please if you can donate or share the link around and let's get this thing made!!

To me, this is a bit of an odd question - if you wanted to be a footballer, what would you do? Play football. So if you want to be an actor, act. Join a local theatre, or youth group, or amateur group and learn the basics of the trade. Get some experience under your belt, learn some stage craft, watch others and learn from their success and mistakes. Unfortunately, as a director and producer I know that, despite popular myth, it is very unlikely you will be 'spotted' walking through a shopping centre, and even more unlikely to be picked from a pile of resumes if your experience is nothing. Acting isn't easy, otherwise everybody would do it. You have to learn your craft, same as any other business. Also, I cannot emphasise enough - read. Everything and anything - plays, scripts, reviews, books, just read. The more you read the more you know. If you needed an operation, which doctor would you pick - the one that says 'I haven't actually done this before, and haven't read any medical books, but I really like surgery and think i would be awesome at it', or the one who says, 'I've done more reading than you can possibly imagine about this situation, and not only that, i have performed different procedures in a number of different theatres.

1374830011.0,6,self.acting,1j3612,Monologues - To Revisit or Not to Revisit?,6,0,3,http://www.reddit.com/r/acting/comments/1j3612/monologues_to_revisit_or_not_to_revisit/,"Hello, all.  I recently had my first audition in a while for a play called Band Fags about some gay boys growing up and discovering their sexuality.  For my audition, I chose a Joe monologue from Millennium Approaches.  I was nervous about choosing it because I feared that it would be overdone - this company does almost exclusively ""gay plays"" so I was particularly worried here.  It's also been a back pocket monologue for about 6 years.  I decided on it because I'd found a new dramatic life to the piece and because it was just too applicable to the play, but I was worried.  It was ultimately validated; when I finished my monologue at the audition, the first comment was from the director, who said it was a perfect choice, and then they gave me a callback before I left the building.

This, however, led me to think that I've now used that monologue with them, so I might need to get some fresh material for the next go around at that company, even if this monologue would serve well for whatever play may loom in the future.  I then figured that I could probably pull one from the show I'm auditioning for, especially if I get cast, which led to more questions.  So here we go, a few questions to discuss:

1. When is it time to retire a monologue?  In undergrad, the suggestion was to never overuse a monologue - a thin balance between having a swath of diverse monologues on call versus running the risk of becoming stale.

2. How forbidden is it to audition at the same company for multiple shows with the same monologue?  Does this show laziness or lower your perceived versatility?

3. How does it look when you're performing a monologue from a show listed on your resume versus one which is presumably of your own making?  I got the impression during undergrad that pulling a monologue from a show you've done is advised against, since the choices and circumstances may not be applicable in the audition and such.  I personally have a bit of a ""well that's just lazy"" reaction when I see someone do a monologue I know they pulled from a show they've done.  However, I fear this may be unfair.

This is where I need help. I have no experience acting, and I'm afraid that I don't even know remotely where to start.

I am currently working full time, and my job does not allow me to take any classes that are offered locally. I am not going through any auditions as this is all very much 'lets shoot in the backyard for practice'.

so how do I start? are there any get started books that are geared towards acting on camera? are plays still recommended even if I won't be doing traditional theater acting? are there any other online resources that can simulate the knowledge I'd gain from a class?

I have done the acting thing my whole life. I finally moved to LA two years ago for nothing acting-related but figured since I was here, I might as well try. 

I got headshots, I exercised -- but now I suddenly have nearly crippling anxiety that it's hard to express. The only way I can think is that I went from being a big fish in a small pond to a big fish in a big pond (college)...and now I'm a piece of krill in the Pacific. I fear I'm not young enough, pretty enough, thin enough, talented enough, etc. I might overthink things but I'm never sure anymore. I gained quite a bit of weight at one point and that led to a lot of rejection. I'm thin again, and even though I know that rejection stemmed from something I fixed, I still feel inadequate overall.

Despite it all, I have at least managed to talk to people online in the industry. Someone who is actually very well connected and done things that I know and respect has taken an interest in me, surprisingly. Now, I realize I have to get my shit in order. I have no demo reel, and my professional headshots are a year old -- my hair color and length are completely different now. He's asked me to send him whatever I've got and I feel like I have nothing. I've thought about just doing something on my webcam or putting together my theatrical stuff, and asking someone to take some decent photos of me that I can touch up (I'm pretty good with photoshop, actually); or is that just silly?

When I used to do drama, my friends said I was very good and I was given a lead role in every one of our little plays.

I attend a performing arts school called 11th session which I feel would be a good start for me. I'm mainly a musician and I play the drums but there is a huge acting and drama group there that I've been thinking about joining, I'd be the first boy, but I'm confident so it should go down fine at first. I don' mind where I start as long as I get the chance to actually take the talent somewhere, if ever in my life I made it to TV, that would be awesome!

I'm more of an ""up front"" person when it comes to acting, I love to move around and be loud and be my own person or character. I've been in 4 productions in my primary school. I have a very slight but still recognizable lisp that has slowly got better with age. Some people get lisps as a child and they go when they get older, plus if I put an accent on the lisp seems to become almost insignificant.

I have an aspiration to become some sort of actor. I love movies and TV of all kinds but mainly action/adventure style films. Some series' that I love are Breaking Bad, Game Of Thrones, The Office (US and UK) and The Walking Dead. I really love any kind of movies but my favorites are things like The Lord Of The Rings (including The Hobbit) and anything that DC or Marvel brings out. I don't think I'll ever end up anywhere near that scale of acting but I would like to start somewhere and at least try to see where I get. 

To summarize, and sorry for the wall of text, I would just like to ask how I could further my aspiration. I was thinking of maybe doing some kind of series on youtube with friends that I could refer to if I ever look for an agent, to show at least a bit of experience.

Mine is not very marketable. I've been trying to think of stage names, but I'm afraid that my years of fantasy-world-building have made me partial to unnatural sounding names. 

I have a very, very common name. My last name is a common word, though not a common surname. It does not have a catchy ring to it and can be difficult to pronounce in some situations. 

Ah, heck. My name is Emily Fellows (this is a throwaway). Type it on facebook/google and there thousands of us. What can I do to dress up my name? 

I thought about incorporating some of my ancestors' names: 

-LaChapelle (surname)

-Jean

-Evelyn 

-Anne

-Kateri 


Outwardly, I am very feminine. However, I do not have the stereotypical feminine behaviors. I think a name (especially for acting) should reflect the type of behavior/personality you're most comfortable portraying. I am not classically beautiful. I am the type of actress they'd cast as the evil step sister or the quirky girl. You know? Someday I'll be the evil witch or extra terrestrial. Shit like that.

I'm going to start to go to these improv classes, would i list that down on my acting resume?

I currently reside in BC, Canada near Vancouver and I am aware that the film industry is getting big here. I would like to audition for movies and/or tv series but I don't know how to. Would i need an agent? Does anyone know where and how i can get auditions? Because it seems to be that the only way to find these auditions is to get an agent and have them get you auditions. 

I would like to do commercials to, I think it would be a good way to start. Would anyone know where to look for commercial auditions in Vancouver?  

I have a bit of theater experience and no on camera film experience. Would anyone have any tips on how to get started in the film industry, because I would much prefer it rather than theater.

First of all, let me say how awesome it is to find a community like this on reddit! Like you, I too love the excitement and freedom that acting gives us.  I am currently doing a performance course at University where it predominantly focuses on acting in 'theatre performance'.  As you know, there is a somewhat large gap between the world of theatre and film, and I am uncertain whether i should stick to theatre (as it is my background), jump over to film, or have a certain balance between the two.  

It's hard to decide, as I have done professional work in both forms.  I'm only quite a young actor, so i'm yet to be molded into either discipline.  There is enough acting work in both to earn a living, but it's difficult to pinpoint if I want to diverge with performance in theatre or film in the future.  

Even though I don't have as much experience as others, what I find is that if you want a career in the industry, starting out in theatre is always the better option.  I find that many people, the same age as me (20) go straight to agencies that will cast them in film or television.  Sure they may get a few jobs at first, but soon fizzle out into nothingness.  **(Warning; Dramaturgy Imminent!)** Understanding the *theory* behind acting, exploring character, and using shifts of actions to create a scene is far more important, especially to young people.  With theatre, you have more time to do these things; play around with scenes a lot more, discover new options etc.

Having said that, everyone has their own way of acting and getting into the industry.  My opinion is that if you want to become a knowledgeable actor, then take theory classes, research important people, plays, and patience. There are plenty of opportunities for everyone.  That is what's so cool about it! 

I want to know your opinion! 

**TL;DR** Do you reckon it's better to start out in theatre or film?

I went to this Agencies open call and I talked to them about the business and did a reading, and I got called back to read again. I went to the call-back and they gave me some advice to work on and said they liked me but wanted me to come back in about a months time after i've practiced and felt like i've gotten more confident. I'm going to meet with them this week for hopefully my final reading. Do you have any advice for a young actor? What can I do to wow them, or make them see a change and like me? I am 16 years old, and this agency seems pretty legitimate. I've looked into it, and read about scam agencies, and this one truly seems right. It has also gotten very great reviews.

Another question: When signing with an agency, how long before you start heading out for auditions? If you hear about a movie being cast, can you talk to your agent about getting you an audition for that certain project? Or do they only have an exclusive range of projects? Thank you!

UPDATE: I am meeting with this agency on Friday. Again, i'd love some advice. Thank you! Wish me luck

I am super excited and nervous. Rehearsals have started and its going good so far. But I feel sometimes I have no idea what I'm doing, since I've never had a role this big before. I am very inexperienced. Fellow actors, I need some advice. Anything that you think would help me I'd greatly appreciate it.
