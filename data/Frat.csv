1356565709.0,84,self.Frat,15honl,Why the fuck didn't I join my fraternity earlier in college? ,107,23,47,http://www.reddit.com/r/Frat/comments/15honl/why_the_fuck_didnt_i_join_my_fraternity_earlier/,"Looking back, I don't know what the fuck I was doing the first three years of college. I don't have many memorable experiences, never went on any trips, only made a handful of new friends, and didn't really achieve anything of real value. 

I pledged this last semester to a large fraternity at a large university down south. I was the oldest pledge at 21, which made some parts of pledgeship a bit awkward as I was older than 1/2 the actives, but whatever. In ONE semester of being apart of Greek life for just 13 weeks (10 pledge, 3 active) I've done more than I have in my entire college career put together. 

*I've made God knows how many friends this semester. And not just friends that say they're my friend because we're brothers, I mean ACTUAL friends. Friends that go out of their way to hang out with me, go out of their way to see how I'm doing, and just all around treat me like they've known me their whole life. 

*I've slept with three girls...IN ONE FUCKING SEMESTER! That's a 200% increase over my first three years of college put together. Fraternity life in general, even while being a pledge, made me 1,000% more outgoing when it comes to girls. I can't explain what it is, but I somehow gained confidence I've never had before and girls (and guys) noticed. 

*I've gone places and done things that I never imagined I would. Gone on trips and adventures with my pledge brothers I thought only happened in 1980's style fraternity movies. I made so many memories in just one short semester, I can't wait to see what happens the coming year. 

And all of this happened because I decide to take a chance and do something outside of my comfort zone. No it wasn't easy, but God fucking damnit was it one of the best decisions I've ever made. My only regret is not doing this earlier in my college career. But at least I have the next three semesters to live up what I missed. 

I really needed to get that off my chest and I figured this would be the best place. ",,False,,t5_2s0mx,False,,,True,t3_15honl,http://www.reddit.com/r/Frat/comments/15honl/why_the_fuck_didnt_i_join_my_fraternity_earlier/,

I believe that it is necessary to maintain the highest quality of brotherhood. I was hazed and I do not hold anything against the brothers who were dishing it out. It made my pledge class close and we all came out stronger. Nothing can create the bond that we share better then a little pain and fear. Although there is a clear line with some fraternities taking hazing as a rite of passage and turning it into who can beat the pledges the worst. I like to think of it as constructive learning, where we were punished for things we would mess up but the line was never crossed. It is all about self control. Overall I believe it is a positive thing as long as there are limits and the brothers know when to stop.

Update: A quote from a past chapter president that speaks volumes,""that I hope you are all pushed to the edge, put under stress and out of your comfort zones, if you are not then we are not doing our job as a brotherhood. I want each of you to feel like quitting at least once while pledging.

",46,15,42,http://www.reddit.com/r/Frat/comments/16yjpd/hola_from_wwwgreekdropcom_a_startup_exclusively/,"Whatsup /r/Frat , my name is Mike Eidlin and I'm a third year Delta Sig (ΔΣΦ) at UC Davis studying Econ. I've been in the game since freshman year and obviously loved every moment of it. I'm here to ask for your help, support, and feedback. 

I am working on a startup called www.greekdrop.com, which connects our greek life demographic to various brands and companies through discounts, product samples, and potential internship and job offers. Think of it as a specialized Groupon for us, except its going to feature products we want, and help us find jobs. 

We are still in development as we do not have the store up yet, but I have programmers building the catalog right now. **This is where I need your help.** I am currently talking to various companies, and it helps with negotiations if I can show them that I have a lot of students interested. *If you guys could sign up with your full name, .edu e-mail, and house on the homepage, it would help bring us better brands. You will gain access to the Beta launch  which is essentially just the first week of discounts, and a lot other quirks.* Also liking us on Facebook, Twitter, or Instagram will definitely keep you updated as we get more brands, and that is also a plus with our negotiations too. 

Twitter and Instagram: @greekdrop
www.facebook.com/greekdrop

So far in our first week, we have talked to:  

1. www.solebicycles.com, Retail: $380, Greekdrop: $299.     
2. www.solewood.com, still in negotiations
3. www.hydracup.com, still in negotiations
4. www.12society.com is in once we have 5,000 users ""opted-in"" 
5. www.getsomejerky.com, buy a 10 pack, save 30% ($45.00 shipped for 30 oz. of BOMB jerky)

And we are definitely planning on talking to many, many more. 

How are other ways you can use greekdrop? 
1. Get discounts on hotel rooms, 40% off if you book 20 rooms (perfect for formals)
2. Find internship and job opportunities specialized for the greek life community, so you're competing with a smaller pool of applicants
3. Redeem FREE product samples, for example get a box of 100 energy drink cans shipped to your house.
4. Discounts on clothes, accessories, electronics.


Let me know if you have any questions, comments, feedback, or suggestions. I would love, and need suggestions on what brands to contact. If you have something you want to buy, suggest it to us, and we'll try to get that company to give us a discount! We are thinking of implementing a campus ambassador program If you want to get involved, send me a pm, and we can talk. 

Thank you for reading this long post in advance. 
Frat hard.

We're actually doing *okay* in terms of our interactions with sororities.  
  
One thing I think we need to work on is how to deal with mixers we have with ""higher"" sororities. Obviously, Greek life is incredibly competitive, for sororities as well as fraternities. So, when we do manage to set up mixers with better sororities, the girls they send are often freshmen with no say in the matter - girls who have to go, and have poor preconceptions of what the night is going to be like.  
  
We have the usual - beer pong, knockout, flipcup, bar area, dance floor - but it's hard to get girls involved at first. They're a little aloof and disinterested, and at first they'll kind of clump together. This makes it tough for *us* to be interested. However, brothers *do* have to stay tenacious and keep working at them, because all sororities are going to be like this for awhile. Once girls open up a little they have a good time, but occasionally we'll have mixers that are a complete bust because we can't really get things going. Contrary to the message of this post, the brothers really are socially competent people, but for some people (especially freshmen), they've never had to deal with breaking into large groups of somewhat difficult girls.

I'm not concerned about hooking up - it happens often enough - I'm just way way more preoccupied with making sure the sorority as a whole has a good time, so that we can get a good reputation and keep mixing with them (and more successfully) in the future.
  
**Basically, any tips on how to get girls interested and involved quickly? How do we break up the insular groups of girls on their phones so that we can show them a good time?**",,False,,t5_2s0mx,False,,,True,t3_1dawbv,http://www.reddit.com/r/Frat/comments/1dawbv/how_can_we_make_our_mixers_with_higher_tier/,

We are pretty large and backed by multi-million and billion corporations. ( just giving some background, not bragging ). But, we are an agricultural based fraternity, if you aren't an Ag-Major you usually do not get in, unless you have significant Ag background. With this being said, most of our sponsors hire us. That is why i joined. Brotherhood, Networking and Shenanigans. For my first two years thats what it was. I had brothers pick me up from the hospital, call me when relatives died, we ate together hung out together, hell there was brothers I hated, but at the end of the day, id still do anything for that asshole. We were respected, had friends in every other fraternity, we were solid. But then, it crumbled. In a transition to a new house, we lost a whole lot of older brothers from graduation. Now its raging alcoholics, seclusion, and house rats, no new girls ever. No brotherhood events, our philanthropy is a joke and girls dont want to come around. So my question is what do you do when your now the older guy about to graduate, how do you turn this around when you have exhausted all options? Thanks in advance for any help.

At the end of the year we were supposed to have a ""rush meeting"" to discuss rush for the upcoming year. During the meeting our chapter adviser was there along with two high up guys who managed our region. The rush meeting was just a trick. They informed us that because we had been under-performing for the past five years and we did not meet the national average for member size(40 members), every active member will be put on alumni status. They told us that we have 48 hours to leave the house and we cannot have anything to do with the fraternity for an entire year. We argued with these assholes for an hour with no avail. This was the first time I had heard of the 40 member minimum and that we had been under-performing. I had never felt so betrayed in my life. We were just names on a page to them.

I'm drained and dragging ass walking around our house as the Latino asks questions and I'm wearily talking to him as I go to drop something off on the top floor of the house. 

I stop on the stairs and stare at this pink cotton-candy looking stuff. 

""Alejandro,"" I lowly ask, ""what's this.""

Alejandro points up to the ceiling where there's man-sized hole with more of the pink insulation around it which I'm standing right under.

A handful of other brothers got into the attic, which wasn't uncommon, and were drinking. Being in the attic isn't dangerous unless you step off the supports, which one guy stepped through it on his own and another guy got shoved and slipped through but caught his arms on the support to keep from falling.

Another few feet over and had he not caught the support beams would've fallen a compete story down into the bottom floor hallway.

We've managed to stay afloat for twenty years without any attachment to the school and have recently become recognized on campus about two years ago.

We are the only house in the city due to a grandfather clause but we are struggling to grow. About 4-5 pledges are admitted every semester. Part of the reason for the low numbers is that the actives number between 10-15 and moral is low. The other cause of our slow growth is the reputation the fraternity has accumulated on campus.

The scandal mentioned above was over an alleged rape that occurred about 20 years ago. In the end no one got arrested and all charges were dropped. Story from the alumni goes that one of the girls that routinely partied with us got mad over something and cried rape. I dont know the real story but thats besides the point. 20 years later the house is unkept and struggling to pay the mortgage and utility. On campus the freshman and non greek students are told that going to our house WILL get you raped and that our members are drug addicts. We make efforts to break this stereotype but many people have it set in there minds of the character of our members. Our parties have been said to be the best by our patrons seeing how ours is the only actual house. 

I'm writing this to hear yalls feedback on the situation. Maybe some of yall have been in a similar circumstance and can offer assistance. For instance a good way to flip the perception is to highlight the perils of gossip as an incentive to be open minded towards our fraternity.

So I'm pledging Phi Kappa Psi here as a sophomore pocket pledge. I didn't get to pledge my freshman year because of my grades and they weren't quite there this semester, I would have been official next year after this semester though cause they'd be up finally. I decided to come back to try and pledge this year because a lot of brothers fought for me to pledge last year even though it didn't happen, and despite not being able to I made a lot of strong friendships here regardless. Now, as we're a bit over half way (a couple to several weeks left apparently depending on us) and I've finalized my decision to transfer, to a school without a phi psi, I'm not really sure what I should do. On one hand, I have all my friends and brothers from my pledge class that I feel I should finish this for, and having come this far I figure why not. But on the other hand I want to enjoy the last 7 weeks I'll be here and I want it to go smoothly and with as little stress as possible. It would be so nice to be done with all the rules and stressful shit that goes along with pledging. If it was going to be done like next week or even the week after I'd be perfectly fine with it, but I'm not entirely sure that that'll be the case, I really just don't know. I wanna try to find out but I think that's doubtful, though we'll see. But regardless, I just don't know what I should do. I feel like I'm not in this for any personal gain of my own, just out of respect to finish this for my pledge brothers and the guys in the house, and my motivation/enthusiasm is minimal because of my situation. 

Has anyone been in a similar situation? Have any advice? Anyone have any advice they can give from a brother's standpoint?

She seemed pretty certain that this was a thing, so I have two questions for you guys:

1) Is this true?

2) How the heck are they going to enforce this? I dunno about you guys, but I'm pretty sure every party in the fall is a rush party by definition until rush is over... how do you possibly tell every sorority girl she can't go to any parties for about 3-5 weeks (depending on your school)???

I remember once where our fraternity was competing against Sig Ep in a game of Capture the Flag for some sorority philanthropy event. I witnessed one of their members chase another one of their members on their own side until the chased member turned around and said ""I'm Sig Ep, I'm Sig Ep!""

Sig Ep is the biggest fraternity on our campus and wins numerous awards from our university administration every year for their GPA and general good behavior. They also dominate intramural sports, have a nice house, and probably the lowest dues on campus. Yet I wouldn't trade the bonds I have with my brothers for any of that. I remember when I got my own pair of letters after completing the pledging process, and it was a moment I was quite proud of.

The university is only about 40 years old and my fraternity has been on campus for about 17 years.
The university has about 6 fraternities and 6 sororities actively on campus and the sizes vary widely. We are the largest greek organization on campus with around 70 members, and have a goal to reach 100 in the fall. Greek life is taking off so quickly here and we consistently see larger pledge classes and more organizations getting affiliated. No houses, yet, but most organizations have started taking steps to getting there (some more concrete than others).


There is a big problem, though. The university is notorious for being against greeklife. In the last 4 years, about 3 fraternities have been kicked off campus for hazing and party related incidents. Just 5 years ago, we were nearly kicked off campus and had to expel half the chapter for a party related incident. To make the situation worse, local police are harsh, know where all the parties are and are constantly busting them and making arrests.

We are hearing rumors about an increased focus from the university to keep fraternities in line, and they are doing this in conjunction with the local police and some student housing around the area. Our names have been listed as being in the crosshairs. We need to be even more careful about what we are doing to make sure we stay on campus, especially in the fall.

What do you all do for your parties not to get busted and keep people out of trouble? Furthermore, how do you reduce your liability in these situations?
When i went to round up, I talked to a lot of guys who helped throw together the parties and it seems like they usually are doing the same things: Hiring security, carding people at doors, making it seem that minors arent drinking. Do you all have any experience implementing things like these? I want to start doing things like this, but am wondering what other things you all do to stay out of trouble.

(My fraternity) is bashing my face into a brick wall, over and over again, forever.
It is climbing uphill, but never reaching a summit—constantly fighting for every single step upward, but never going anywhere. I feel like a man buried alive in stupidity, clawing my way to Light, but hopelessly trapped in a dark and unknowing pit of ignorance. I’m clawing at the walls to draw passion from the passionless, but the ears of the unknowing are clogged with their vices. The “brotherhood” around me is usually my biggest adversary in every project.  It represents everything I despise: apathy, arrogance, entitlement, and pointlessness.  I have less faith in my brothers to come to my aid than I do a random stranger in the street.  

Every single day, I fight to bring in new members who will take the fraternity in a positive direction, but every minute I face a member of exec blocking my way.  When I find a path I can take, I have to withstand my brothers talking behind my back, ostracizing me and mocking me because I have passion.  I care about what I’m doing, and I act intentionally.  (my fraternity) is hypocrisy and cowardice and the institutional imperative—mindless mirrors of men reflecting shadows of a flawed system.  It is degradation, humiliation, and a bullet point on my resume which makes me less attractive to employers.  (My fraternity) is daddy’s money and a C average stirred together in an effort to never grow up.

What is it we try to achieve as a group? What is our purpose? To strengthen one another and fight for what we believe is good? To be a collective force for what is right? To support one another like brothers would support brothers? I see none of this.  As individuals, perhaps, but as a group our actions would tell another story of our purpose.  If we were judged by our actions alone (not our words or intentions), I believe our fraternity would stand for…nothing because action is a prerequisite of standing.  We don’t stand for shit because we don’t have passion.

My house just got put on disciplinary probation because during fall rush we had two incidents in a two-week time span. We had two freshman girls go back to the dorms really drunk and say they were at our house.

So basically if our chapter has one more incident between now and the end of February we will almost certainly be put on social probation.

In light of our current situation our current risk manager is not allowing any freshman girls in our house, at any time. While this isn't a huge issue now, it will become one in the spring for rush.

Our house really needs a successful spring rush, but I'm betting it won't be successful if we're not allowing freshman girls in.

Are there any risk managers who have any tips for me? I want my house to have a successful spring rush, but I refuse to be responsible for getting my house put on social probo.

Last year our tailgates were mainly informal drinking in our back parking lot and grilling burgers and dogs.

I have a few ideas for this year.

-Large canopy for sun protection, maybe a bar under the canopy so people congregate under

-Old turf under the canopy. No one likes a hot asphalt parking lot, so the turf will make us feel like we're on grass.

-Beer bongs from 2nd story window.

-Multiple TVs for CFB watching.

-Better food, some sandwich plates, maybe buy a BBQ smoker for some legit ribs and BBQ.

-Live band?

-Spiked watermelon, why the hell not.


Anyone have any other ideas to make tailgates more fun this fall?

My fraternity, it seems, is over-the-hill. No one has heard of us anymore, our inactive chapters more than quadruple the still active ones, and finding another active brother in the US is a game of Where's Waldo. It makes me sad because we used to be great in years past but in a couple of years we're going to end up having to merge.

Anyway, to the problem. Our chapter, though as large TKE and Pike on campus, is virtually unknown to people at my college. Parties are hard to come by, and we're very insular. On top of that, we've recently been suspended for 2 years for hospital visits during pledging, though we're appealing it. By the time we're back, most of our fraternity will be gone, leaving one or two pledge classes in addition to mine.

I want people to know our chapter again on campus. We need to continue recruiting, but I'm not sure if underground pledging is worth it. I need ways to attract non-weird, motivated, well-connected individuals to our fraternity. I also want to start doing parties for the fraternity, but I need a place of my own first. I've been thinking of trying to rent out a brother's first floor of the house for the night or something, but I'm not sure if it would work. Also, befriending other fraternities may be an option for parties.

Any other ideas to get people talking about our fraternity is also appreciated. Thanks.

I have not decided on a specific one because of the varying requirements of individual orgs and the fact that I plan on seriously committing to this, which makes pinpointing the perfect GLO a bit difficult.

I know I must find good men, 15-30 of them, and must work hard for around 2 years from what I've gathered so far. Not worried about doing that for the cause of bringing a respectable fraternity onto my campus.

My question is, what fraternity(ies) is: large enough to be well-respected, connected, and coveted, but at the same time charging a modest overall amount for full chapter integration into the national organization?

For example two I recently looked into were Sigma Chi and Kappa Sigma, and the first had varying charges here and there for initial colony recognition (dues and application fees are expected, although theres were a bit high from others that i know of), with a 5,000 dollar fee for pledge paraphernalia and some other costs, is this a normal and expected amount? The latter only provided contact info on their site, but no numbers.

Im going to be a junior, physics major, and I know at least 7 smart guys (all of us well social to expand to more) with good majors and GPAs who are similarly interested in Greek life but not willing to go with any of the existing Frats on campus (our campus is not huge, it is a Cali State Univ, and Latino and Black orgs run it, nothing against them but they are too limited for our taste).

1) How do I convince my parents?

Background: I know that at some point, there is nothing I can do. I've brought up the idea to them, and they don't seem keen on it. I need their support though, seeing as how it's not only costly to rush, but to pledge and stay active.

Everyone who is Greek answers differently, but I wanted to pick your brain on it. Really just out of curiosity. Not that I want to do one, but they're kind of peculiar.

I'm in a sorority, and we buy and make paddles for more than just our bigs, but for our close sisters as well.

I've got moderate social anxiety, so basically I just come across as a really shy guy, and I'm not sure I'd fit in with other members of the fraternity, and I'm not even sure I'd get a bid anywhere if I did rush. Greek life is huge at my school, and it sort of just comes across as this elite group of people that I'm not good enough for. 

Now other than being shy, I feel like I'd be perfect for Greek life. I work out, I'm fairly athletic, I love to party, I've got decent grades, and I'm into southern style/""frattire"" which is huge at my school. 

Basically my question to you guys is, how much of a barrier is being shy to joining Greek life? Once I get to know people I'm not shy at all, it's just that I tend to be awkward before that. Do I pretty much have no chance of getting a bid anywhere, or should I just rush for the hell of it, be myself, and hope that I get a bid? I feel like joining a fraternity would be a great way for me to force myself to be social, it's just that I can't help but think I won't get into one. 

Also, I'm not sure how it works at other schools but we've got informal rush in the fall (and only upperclassmen can rush) and formal rush during the spring, when anyone can rush, but it's mostly first years. Would you guys recommend doing formal or informal?

I posted a topic a month ago: http://www.reddit.com/r/Frat/comments/jm1ub/rushing_for_a_social_fraternity/ about rushing for an Asian Interest Social Fraternity. When rush week came I attended 4 rush events(3 mixers and a Poker Night with brothers) with my good friend(roommate). I was confident, I had fun and felt that I did everything a good rush would do by being social and talking to everybody(including alumnus of the Fraternity and other rushes), dancing, beer pong, and etc. Let's say i was pretty confident and felt that I was sure I was gonna get a bid (didn't say that or have the attitude like that). Shockingly, when bid day arrived, I didn't get a call, pretty much felt like shit for that entire day. My question is should I phone one of the newly crossed brothers that I talked to a lot about the situation? I already asked him about it and he said he wasn't there when they made the decisions so he'd ask for me, he also asked if I felt disappointed.

So /r/frat, what do you think? Should I rush again? I have a great feeling that all the friends I met during rush will cross and would vouch for me if I did for Spring 2012. 

Other things to note: I only rushed for one fraternity. I talked to a lot, and I mean A LOT of the alumnus from various chapters, but I didn't talk to the actives as much.

This gets a bit whiny in places as I'm a touch bitter.

I am a brother in ΦMA Sinfonia, which holds the unique and sometimes troublesome position of being a social fraternity focused on music.  We aren't a professional fraternity, we just seek to create the bounds of fraternity through the power of music.  Nationally we're relatively sizable, with somewhere around 6,500 actives and 246 chapters.  On campus (in our small college in Iowa), we're the oldest (72 years in June) existing social on campus and also the largest.

This is all well and good.  The problem lies in that the other Greek organizations on campus don't *recognize* us as Greek, regardless of our chapter and fraternity history, as we are not on the Greek council here--they consider us an ""academic"" fraternity due to the music thing.  The council itself doesn't want us on it because, as recently as 2010, they were concerned about further upsetting the balance between men's and women's organizations on the council (currently at 2-1).  We don't necessarily want to be on the Greek council either, because Sinfonia and the other socials on campus (ΔΣΦ, Acacia, and ΑΟΠ) have somewhat different goals in life and some of my brothers feel that membership on the Greek council would restrict us too much.  

All that said, we generally get along on a personal level well with the other fraternities.  There are many Acacians in music ensembles and those Acacians are largely treated as being in association with Sinfonia anyway (as one of our goals is brotherhood amongst musical students in general).  ΔΣΦ and Sinfonia have always been on good terms, having for many decades shared the same floor in one of our dorm buildings (as off-campus Greek housing isn't allowed here).  Even so, it causes some bitterness when, for example, the Sigs go around billing themselves as the oldest Greek organization on campus when we have them beat by 15 years, or Acacia tells its recruits that it's the largest on campus when we consistently out recruit them.

tl;dr:  How does one go about gaining recognition as Greek with an uncooperative Greek council?

We have asked our readers what they would be more interested in reading/seeing on the blog, but only a few responses are trickling in. 

I'm hoping some of you guys can give me some of your input or critiques about it. What sucks and what's good? What are some things you guys think we should be posting about? I'm open to any ideas you guys might have.

I used to think greek types where shallow, drunkards, but have met quite a few awesome people.
They do allot of charity work and are usually well rounded people.

A few of us had some similar ideas all based around greeklife so we decided we could make something out of them. Facebook really doesn't cut it. It's way to public and too difficult to manage people in groups that you aren't part of (e.g. you can't make use of a sorority Facebook group).

Problems we saw:

* Its difficult to get the word out to the people you want and only them
* Frats are terrible at keeping their brothers on track with the social schedule
* Finding dates to formals or date-parties is really annoying unless you plan on taking your friend in another sorority
* Getting set up by friends is awkward
* There is no forum for two houses (one frat and one sorority) to discuss their activity
* Organizing a Formal out of town is very time consuming and expensive including busses, hotels, and venues

We aim to solve these problems.

[Here](http://vimeo.com/44292496) is a link to our pitch deck (I'm not in the video).

What I need from y'all:

* What is difficult for you as a brother?
* What is difficult for the social chair?
* How could a service improve the quality of greek life?
* Would you use such a service?
* Have you heard of innergreek? Do you use it?

As a freshman at a private university, I rushed and joined a fraternity my first semester and loved it. However, I could not afford this university as this was around when the economy turned sour in 09. As a result, I transferred to a community college and studied my sophomore year there. This year, my junior year, I transferred to a large state school on scholarship. However, the university does not have my fraternity.

Here's what I've decided as far as the obvious goes:

-Starting my frat here: Thought about it, but it's too much work with school and policy debate (which is what I am on scholly for). Also I wouldn't even begin to see the fruits of my labor until after graduating. 

-The pledge process 2: I believe as strongly as anyone that the pledge process is the best time you never want to have again, but it seems to me like I need to go through this again if I want to have a kickin social life. Seriously, it's almost impossible to find a party here if you're not in a fraternity. 

-Dropping my old frat: Not quite sure how to do this. If anyone has pointers or if they've done it before, your advice would be awesome.

Overall just trying to gauge if this is a good idea or not. I loved the guys in my old frat, but there is absolutely no chance of me going back there and instead of doting on past experiences I'd rather have new ones. Let me know what you think.

I really regret not joining freshman year but back then I was really clueless about all this and before I knew it, rush was over. I'm not really looking to pledge JUST for the social life, since I have a pretty fun one already. Mostly, I wanna join because I wanna have a steady group of friends. In college, I had friends in classes first semester, who I never saw anymore in the second semester. I'm pretty sure I won't see my dorm friends much next fall either. I really hate making friends based on who's around me at the time and most of who I don't see anymore after a semester/year but want to have a steady group who I can count on.Anyway, these are my questions:

1. Will being foreign hurt my chances of getting a bid in any way? I've noticed that most of the fraternities on campus have very few foreigners in them,if any, and are very ""white"" ( I'm light brown).

2. I have some friends in 2 houses that I am quite interested in. Should I focus my energy on those 2 houses and get to know the brother there or should I go to as many houses as possible?

Any other tips or suggestions are welcome!




P.S- In case, anyone is wondering, I am pretty social person, in good shape, played ""soccer"" in high school and come from a pretty wealthy background(not trying to be arrogant).

I'll start.

1. Don't wear cargos
2. Don't wear AE/Abercrombie/Aeropostale
3. Don't be creepy
4. If you don't handle alcohol well or you turn into a douche/creep/whatever when you're drunk, don't get too drunk at rush parties
5. Rush around. Don't just rush one fraternity and because they we're super nice you feel like you can't go to another.
6. Take fraternities/sororities talking about other fraternities/sororities with a grain of salt. Sometimes it's true, sometimes it's not. You have to figure that shit out for your self.
7. Don't tryhard. Just because you we're on TFM for most of your senior year high school classes doesn't mean you need to start wearing Ralph Lauren/VV/Brooks Brothers/Southern Tide/Croakies/Chubbies. Props if this is what you grew up wearing though.
8. Don't be creepy.
9. Don't talk about all the shit you did in highschool, at least not in a douchey way. Mention that you played sports/did whatever clubs but don't go on about how you were third string quarterback and your team made it to division C quarterfinals once.
10. While partying is a rather large part of greek life in most areas, don't fucking say ""i'm here to party"". Mention that you love alcohol/women/music but don't come off as a retard.
11. Don't just show up to the rush parties. Go to other events too. It shows again that you just aren't looking for a fraternity to party.
12. Don't try to be someone you're not. Just because you aren't ""fratty"" and you want to join the upper middle tier ""fratty"" fraternity doesn't mean you should change how you are(unless you're a solid guy but you need to break out of your shell/be more of a gentlemen/shit that can benefit you in life)
13. This one is iffy, but it comes from personal experience. Usually rush parties have a shitton of alcohol all free to all who come. Enjoy it, but possibly for the last rush party bring a bottle of something decent or nice and share it with a brother you didn't really get to speak too. He'll most likely respect it a shitton and pass the word on to other brothers.
14. Don't brag/seem to be a overconfident douchebag(unless you can back it up in intramural sports). Dad owns a company worth $50 mil and you have 4 houses? Keep it to your self unless you show up in a 911 and the brothers ask about it. Wealthy people that are classy and don't flaunt their wealth obnoxiously are much better company and brothers.
15. Try to dress better if you don't already. 
16. Don't act like you're in the fraternity already no matter how much the brothers seem to like you/lead on you getting a bid. Unless they directly tell you something like that, be modest.
17. Have a dope drinking skill? Show it. I got my nickname from a rush party for beating all the brothers in chugging. Just makes you stand out a little.
18. Try to make relationships(sexual or just friends, whatever) with the girls the fraternities hang out with. Always helps to have them like you.
19. Going off of 18, don't hit on a brothers girl. Ever. Always ask a brother if the girl you're trying to bag is taken.

Please comment and add shit to this list, maybe mods can compile it to one post. It's not that we have an abundance of ""omg im rushin all da frats at my school what do i do"" posts but I feel overall it could be beneficial.

I have to give a *lot* of details so try to bare with me.

I go to a large state school in MO *wink wink*, and I'm probably more frat than half of the guys actually in the greek system. I didn't join the greek community for a few reasons:

1. Grades. I'm a smart guy trying to get into law school, and I thought being in a fraternity would be a hindrance. I was half-right, half-wrong.

2. I'm super liberal and I think most fraternity guys are super not liberal..

3. Douches. I KNOW. Geeds and what not are just slandering your good name. But the fact is a lot of douches ARE attracted to the benefits of a fraternity. It's like the difference between a single crazy racist and the KKK. (not saying fraternities are equal to the KKK haha) Obviously one if going to get more attention.

4. I'm gay. I realized I couldn't really be out and be in a ""good"" fraternity so I didn't want to try to rush something that would hate who I was. And I figured I could find more guys outside of it.

Cue reality. I'm a masculine gay guy, and I quickly find out 99.9% of all the other masculine gay guys are closeted and in fraternities.. I've grown tried of messing around with guys who try to treat me like a slampiece, or having to be so discrete no one knows, or banging guys who have girlfriends of 3 years. I thought the whole concept of being in a fraternity was about brotherhood? Doesn't it cheapen it all to not let in a out gay guy but let in 10 closet cases who are too afraid to tell their brothers?

Do any of you guys have experiences with closet cases? What is your opinion on it all? And why do you think such a homophobic community on the surface attracts so many closeted gay guys?",,False,,t5_2s0mx,False,,,True,t3_xg9f3,http://www.reddit.com/r/Frat/comments/xg9f3/how_do_you_feel_about_all_the_closeted_guys_in/,

Lemme get your opinion,3,4,12,http://www.reddit.com/r/Frat/comments/r82it/alright_bros_lemme_get_your_opinion/,"So this girl I went to high school with also attends my university. When she found out we were both greek as freshman, she asked me if I would take her little as my little and when I took a little, that she would be his big sister.

Well around this time last year, she took her first little and immediately came to me for me to be the big brother, I kept my word and said I would. This is where it all gets messy, because the day these girls had their big little reveal night, she texted me asking if it was alright if she found a different big brother for her little. Normally I would not open my bag of fucks and hand one to her, but I already bought, for what I thought would be my little sister, a few containers of certain beverages, a sweatshirt with her letters, a blanket with her name and letters, a VIP pass to a local club for her and her friends, had a paddle made, and for some big little bonding time, tickets for the season opener for a Detroit Tigers game (kept those obviously and raged face with my bros)

Needless to say I wasn't exactly happy. And I made that very clear to this sorostitute. I gave the gifts to her new big bro to pass along anyways because they would be no good for me to hang on to. 

Now it gets to the point where even I can't be tftc. This girl that originally wanted me to take her little has put me in the dog house with her sisters and caused the biggest seen on fratville on St. Pattys day because I took a little brother this semester and chose a girl from a sorority we were paired up with for greek week to be his big sister. She screamed that we had an agreement she would be the big sister and when I told her that was off when she switched me out for her little, she went to her sisters and told them how bad of a guy I am and that I tell girls what they want to hear and even went as far to say that I have the herps, which I don't. 

So now the university is getting involved because of her illegal claim and I'm the reason girls in her house and a few others hate my house. 

So my questions are:

Am I totally in the wrong for not making her my little's big?

What can I do to stop the bad blood?

Thanks for reading. I hate drama, and I hate even more that I'm the cause of it. 

TL;DR: Girl I went to high school with wanted us to be our little's bigs. She backed out last minute, so when I took a little, I chose a different girl to be the big, which caused a PR mess that I can't seem to get out of.
