Please help us, and help your own organization by putting a notice on your main page, the homepage of millions upon millions of people.

5:57pm MST: I'm blown away at the response about this. Great job! Here is another template revision by [nox_venator](http://reddit.com/user/nox_venator/): 

""Hello Google,

The idea, as brought forth on the website http://www.reddit.com, is that Google can make an even greater push for an open internet as the fight against SOPA mounts. I, [real_name], would hereby like to suggest that Google, Inc. displays a notice about the effects SOPA will have on the free flow of information on its homepage. Google is the homepage for millions of Americans and is visited by many millions more every single day. It is my impression that most Americans are unaware of the threat to the internet they know and love - by making a mention, Google can raise awareness about this devastating bill in a tremendous way. [1]

It isn't just American citizens that SOPA will effect as this SOPA bill as it currently stands will effectively filter, censor and take down any part of the internet that the SOPA-backers don't wish to see remain.

Google has in the past, pulled out of China for the very same reason [2]: that the government was blocking sites it deemed unsuitable for public viewing. Please display a similar level of visible action with regards to this simple idea.

SOPA works against the UN's report that Internet Access is a basic human right [3], so please consider this suggestion as we fight back against the suppression of every man, woman and child's right to free knowledge.

With hopeful expectation, [real_name]

&gt;[GoDaddy CEO] Adelman couldn’t commit to changing its position on the record in Congress when asked about that, but said “I’ll take that back to our legislative guys, but I agree that’s an important step.” But when pressed, he said “We’re going to step back and let others take leadership roles.” He felt that the public statement removing their support would be sufficient for now, though further steps would be considered.

So, GoDaddy hasn't gone on the record to *oppose* SOPA, and now they've made it clear they're still officially *supporting* it. In my opinion, the ""we no longer support SOPA"" statement released yesterday seems to be just a calculated PR move.

Make it so every newsroom producer has NO choice but to make mention of the evil **Sopa** would bring. Flood their communication channels so bad, that the fact it's happening becomes the story! State your case in your message and give them something to work with. First and foremost news needs a story to be told. Assignment editors and News directors will send reporters to localize stories. 
(ex.WHY INTERNET ENTHUSIASTS EVERYWHERE WANT TO WASH CLEAN THE SOPA)

Here are just a few links to get started with- that WILL get noticed. Most anchors and reporters you see on tv do have facebook and twitter and they DO find and write stories themselves. Also, should anyone contact Alison Kosik or Robin Meade, tell them I personally would like to say I love you.

* EDIT
My tech savvy friend just informed me that he sadly knew nothing about SOPA and has been uninformed. However, he has assured me he had seen Lindsay Lohan's boobs. Preash to you sir!




*EDIT 2


I am by no means an authority on how a newsroom works.
I will say that I have NEVER once seen corporate influence in the journalist efforts in the pursuit of a story.
I cannot speak for the inner workings of The FOX News Network. 
I will say it is common for a Newsroom to have regulations and procedures on certain content that hits the air.
(Ex. Said newsroom may decide not to cover deadly shootings or dead bodies. Some may decide that crime stories take precedence over human interest and consumer fraud.)
 This all falls into the stations marketing strategy of how they want to appeal to their audience (often 25-54yr olds)

Bottom line, car commercials keep the lights on in your local TV station. Good journalism and interesting stories are going to keep you watching. If it's good enough it gets filtered up to the big boys.
 If you think for a minute that a some suit and tie executive could walk up to Brian Williams and tell him not to cover a story of importance because it doesn't align with their company's agenda than you are crazy.
  These journalists are of the highest caliber. Your local weatherman might have a cocaine addiction (cough cough... Charlotte) But when you play with the big boys you better know your shit. Stories with the most interest on a stations website will only fuel our need to do more with it. 
Headlines sell... Interest sells... We investigate fraud and corruption and seek out the truth but if it doesn't sell than Lindsay Lohan's boobs will. Keep pressing your media outlets. You would be so surprised how a bull-shit story in dumbfuck Okahoma can be a headline the next day. Love and kisses!!!!

Much love to [@mpetricone](http://twitter.com/mpetricone), [@mrcjdawson](http://twitter.com/mrcjdawson), [@thinktankhero](http://twitter.com/thinktankhero), [@micahsch](http://twitter.com/micahsch), and [@leahbel](http://twitter.com/leahbel).

It was a day full of intimate, frank discussions that put faces &amp; stories (ours) behind why this legislation would be so awful. I told my story, and how in a ProtectIP world it simply couldn't have happened. We all want to stop the bad guys, but doing *this* would obliterate one of the few growing sectors of our economy (one that we're also out-innovating the rest of the world in) and ruin the beautiful meritocracy that is the world wide web.

I hope I did you all justice and though I didn't sleep much last night, you all were instrumental in helping craft what I'd say and how I'd say it. Thank you.

Our schedule:

 * Michael Daum, Senator Maria Cantwell (D-WA)
 * Neeta Bidwai, Senator Mark Warner (D-VA)

([I missed the first two because I was doing a livechat with Mashable](http://mashable.com/2011/11/16/alexis-ohanian-live-chat-announce/))
 
 * Rob Seidman, Senator Kelly Ayotte (R-NH)
 * Jack Smedile, Senator Roy Blunt (R-MO)
 * Josh Finestone, Senator Dean Heller (R-NV)
 * Mark Colwell, Senator Jerry Moran (R-KS)
 * Congressman Jason Chaffettz (R-UT)

And here's a great bit of progress that came out this evening:

Senator Morin, who we met today, came out with a statement against Protect IP, saying he (and Rand Paul [R] &amp; Maria Cantwell [D]) will put a hold on it. Now we've got solid bipartisan concerns voiced in both houses of Congress. But there's still lots more work to be done!

http://www.techdirt.com/articles/20111117/15492016808/senators-rand-paul-jerry-moran-maria-cantwell-all-warn-that-protect-ip-will-kill-jobs.shtml


The major two points I'm hitting are (1) how *awful* it is for the tech industry (e.g., my own entrepreneurial story of reddit wouldn't have happened), which continues to be one of the few strong parts of our economy and [~~(2) it's censorship~~](http://www.reddit.com/r/technology/comments/meg8w/im_hoping_to_testify_before_congress_on_thursday/c308qy0) (leaving this argument to my cohorts who are actually experts and not just angry people like me).

I'll use as little humor as possible and will be wearing a suit, basically trying to come close to this [awesomeness from Mike Rowe](http://dsc.discovery.com/fansites/dirtyjobs/mike-rowe-senate-testimony.html). Suggestions?

It passed the Senate Judiciary Committee unanimously, and was only stopped from going to a vote because Senator Ron Wyden put a hold on it. SOPA was introduced in October as an attempt to introduce the same ""anti-piracy"" legislation via the House. It has of course met with high profile opposition, so the supporters of this draconian legislation have turned their attention back to the PROTECT IP Act.

[Senator Harry Reid is seeking a cloture to override Senator Wyden's hold](http://www.techdirt.com/articles/20111217/22470217117/senator-harry-reid-moves-to-approve-protect-ip-begin-censoring-internet.shtml). **They will vote at 2:15pm on Tuesday, January 24, 2012.** The supporters already have 40 senators. They have a month in which to convince another 20 to vote yes. If this happens, the act will be sent to the House to vote on (there it only needs a majority).

That means we have a month in which to lobby Senators to oppose the bill. We're up against giant corporations, and I think it will require as many Redditors as possible to take part.  

**[Here is a list of those people/corporations supporting/opposing the PROTECT IP Act](http://www.opencongress.org/bill/112-s968/money).** 

Remember, if the PROTECT IP Act is passed, SOPA won't even be needed any more. SOPA is thankfully getting a lot of attention, but the danger is that it's distracting people from the PROTECT IP Act, which has already passed further through congress.

**Edit** Someone mentioned Nintendo, which is legit. Nintendo also supports SOPA. Obviously Nintendo is a much better company than the pile of shit that is EA, but sometimes our favorites are lead astray, and turning a blind eye to them doesn't help anybody. We can all get by with not buying Nintendo products for a few months. Again, we need to make sacrifices, and if we cant do that, then we don't deserve this free internet. 

And I disagree with pcx's comment, that we need to focus only on GoDaddy so it can feel a lot of pain. Most of us don't have GoDaddy accounts, and can't boycott it.
