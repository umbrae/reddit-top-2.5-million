1346716209.0,187,self.Spanish,zb2ng,Using the Internet to learn Spanish- A Guide,213,26,39,http://www.reddit.com/r/Spanish/comments/zb2ng/using_the_internet_to_learn_spanish_a_guide/,"Often times, people will feel like they don't have enough resources to adequately learn Spanish. If you are reading this right now, that means that you have access to enough material to become a master of the language! Many people often overlook the internet as a serious source of material, or they don't fully realize how much is at their disposal. This guide will act as a reference for using the Internet to learn Spanish.

 I will break this resources down into three main groups: Introduction Materials, Absorption Materials, and  Synthesis Materials. Introduction Materials are just that- they introduce you to a concept, so that you are familiar with it if you later run across it. Absorption Materials are resources that help you absorb Spanish to the point where you are conversational. Theses can include TV Shows, Movies, Radio Programs, Newspapers, etc. The final category is Synthesis Materials, which are resources that have you actually use the language. Anything from penpal sites to translation sites can fall into this category.

It is important to note that this guide does not provide any order for you to use the resources in. If you are so inclined, you can skip the Introduction materials and go right into Synthesis, or any combination thereof. This just acts as a handy reference for these materials. Also be aware that many of these fields overlap. In such cases I have simply put them under the category that I feel best represents them.

### Introduction Materials

[**StudySpanish.com**](http://www.studyspanish.com/) - One of the most used resources for introducing a topic, this website had a ton of great, free lessons. You can also quiz yourself on their free quizzes to see how well you know a topic. There is also a paid version, but the free version suffices.

[**Duolingo.com**](http://duolingo.com/) - A fantastic site that gives you lessons and then quizzes you on the topic. It tracks your progress and awards you points based on how many activities you do. You're also helping to translate webpages at the same time, so it's a win-win! Check out the great subreddit /r/duolingo for more information.

[**Cervantes Institute**](http://www.cervantes.es/default.htm) - The leading institution for the promotion of Spanish language and culture around the world. They offer some free lessons on the site, as well as providing information for finding Spanish classes in your area. This site is definitely worth checking out, as they also have links to some great news sites.

[**FSI Introduction Materials**](http://fsi-language-courses.org/Content.php) - This site contains many of the textbooks and audio programs used by the US government to teach Spanish to its employees. It can be a bit hard to navigate, but there is good material there.

[**Real Academia Española Dictionary**](http://www.rae.es/rae.html) - One of the most expansive dictionaries in the Spanish language, entirely online!

[**SpanishDict**](http://www.spanishdict.com/) - A Spanish-English, English-Spanish dictionary that contains great examples for the context words are used in. It also has a good conjugation device.

[**Anki**](http://ankisrs.net/) - A great flashcard program that quizzes you on vocab. It come with tons of premade decks, and it even has an Android app.

[**BBC Languages**](http://www.bbc.co.uk/languages/) - A BBC site that has the News in many different languages, as well as some lessons and videos to teach you the basics. It is good for a beginner.

[**Memrise**](http://www.memrise.com) - A flashcard website with a very nice interface and helpful suggestions for remembering words. It also has a nice reminder and review system set up, so you aren't constantly reviewing the same words.

---
###Absorption Materials

[**rtve.es**](http://www.rtve.es/)- A Spanish news site that contains TONS of good stuff. You can find things ranging from news articles to TV shows to Radio programs to Podcasts. These types of sites are your best friend, and you should use them frequently.

[**Notes In Spanish**](http://www.notesinspanish.com/) - A free podcast that goes from a beginner to advanced level. It helps one learn to listen to Spanish, and to be able to keep up in conversation.

[**Polyglot Project**](http://www.polyglotproject.com/) - A site where you can read many classics in their original language, including Spanish. The great thing about this site is that you can highlight words or sentences that you don't know, and it will translate them. This is helps to not break your concentration.

[**A List of Films in Spanish**](http://www.ateneo21.com/Films-Argentina.html) - This page contains some good Spanish language films. It unfortunately does not have them for download, but I am sure one could find them somewhere. The linked page is the page for Argentinian Films, but there are other countries there as well.

[**Spanish Wikipedia**](http://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Portada) - This is an often overlooked resource. Next time you are looking something up on Wikipedia, see if you can read the Spanish article instead. Another idea is to help translate pages to and from Spanish and your native language. Even if the translation has errors, there are native speakers who can clean it up afterwards.

[**Radio Lingua Podcasts**](http://radiolingua.com/) - A website that has quite a few good Spanish language podcasts. It is worth checking out if you like audio programs.

[**Mitele.es**](http://www.mitele.es/programas-tv/) - A good site that has a lot of TV programs aside from the news. If you are getting bored with some of the programs in sites listed above, try this one out! Note that is seems you have to pay for some, if not all, of the programs. It could still be worth it if you are looking for something to entertain you for a night.

[**Spanish Elementary Textbooks**](http://apoyo-primaria.blogspot.com/2011/09/libros-de-lecturas-por-grado.html) - Here are some textbooks in Spanish that range from a 1st to 6th grade level. The thumbnails are broken, but the links work fine.

---
###Synthesis Materials

[**Interpals**](http://www.interpals.net/) - Meet people from Spanish Speaking countries and talk or write with them. It is a great way to actually get some use of the language in, as well as meeting some cool people!

[**Verbling**](http://www.verbling.com/) - A site similar in concept to Omegle, but dedicated to language learning. You get connected with a Spanish speaker who is trying to learn English, and spend 5 minutes speaking Spanish and 5 minutes speaking English. At the end, you rate each other's ability and move on. It does require a camera and microphone, however.

[**LiveMocha**](http://livemocha.com/) - A site that offers lessons and Rosetta Stone style programs for many languages, including Spanish. It does have a fee, but it is mentioned often enough to warrant being put on this list.

**IRC Chat** - While there is no specific link here, there are many Spanish or Language learning chatrooms that you can connect to. One that I frequent is ##/lang/ at irc.freenode.net, but I am sure there are many others as well.

[**Lang-8**](http://lang-8.com/) - A site where you can correct English learner's writings, while they do the same with yours. It is very active and a good place to practice.

This list is subject to change and expand, but for now this is a great starting point for those of you who may have had trouble finding resources in the past. If anyone has other resources, go ahead and post them in the comments and I might add them to the guide. I hope this has helped someone, and look forward to making more in the future!

1353514643.0,93,self.Spanish,13kkf9,"As of today I have lived in Spain for one year. Over that time, I have compiled a list of the most useful daily idiomatic Spanish expressions I've found.",97,4,41,http://www.reddit.com/r/Spanish/comments/13kkf9/as_of_today_i_have_lived_in_spain_for_one_year/,"I've always been disappointed by the Spanish ""slang"" lists found in books and online because I found that too many of them focused on over-the-top phrases that were not actually used. From the day I moved here, I started compiling a list of sentence fillers and more language characteristics that I noticed only Spanish natives used. 

Keep in mind that this specifically refers to the Castillian Spanish spoken in Spain. Many of these are not well known outside of Spain, but if you plan to live here or learn this dialect of Spanish, they are incredibly useful. I would honestly recommend learning these words before you even learn how to introduce yourself or say where you're from. Inserting them into your speech will give you a measure of authenticity unmatched by increasing your vocabulary and will make you sound more native.

* **""alvolear tongue click""** - It's very common in Spain to click your tongue before saying something that has an emotional tint to it. If you listen for it, you'll notice it a lot. This is used up to once a minute depending on the person. Strangely enough, I have asked /r/linguistics about this and not one person could point me to any research on it, although nearly everyone does it.
* **chungo/a** - adjective for something that is bad
* **coño! joder! hostia!** - like hombre, more interjections used at the start of the sentence to indicate surprise at something bad.
* **crack** - To be phenomenal at something (like a sport). ""Es un crack, este tío!"" Una **pasada** is another way to express the same, but can also be applied to more abstract things and not just people.
* **cutre** - in the same vein as chungo, but more like ""sketchy, shabby, a dive"". You'd say this about a run-down bar.
* **guay** - cool
* **hombre!** - Used as an interjection indicating surprise or to emphasize a statement. *(Hombre, no!)*
* **me la suda** - ""I don't give a crap.""
* **molar** - verb, meaning ""to rock"" or to be cool. *(Eso mola!)*
* **o sea** - a classic filler used to introduce another thought or clarify the current thought. This is not specific to Castillian Spanish, but is used quite a bit in Spain. [Example from Spanish television](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6QmDgDg9WAE).
* **tío/tía** - dude/guy. Used in exactly the same way. Can either be used as an interjection *(Tio, te digo...)* or to refer to a specific person *(Conozco un tío...)*. Macho is also used as an interjection, but is less common.
* **vale** - ""OK"". Used at least once in every sentence. 
* **vaya!** - Has a couple different meanings when used at the start of a sentence: ""Well!"", ""My!"", ""Oh no!"" However, when combined with a noun/adjective, translates to ""What a...."". Example: **vaya lio** - ""what a mess!""
* **venga** - another interjection, usually used when you're leaving a conversation or saying goodbye to someone. Doesn't mean anything. 
* **venga va!** - ""Come on! Let's go!""
* **pues nada** - yet another interjection/muletilla. Literally means ""well, nothing"", and from that meaning you can probably guess the actual worth of it in a sentence (nothing). 
* **ya está** - there it goes/there it is/there you are. Used when an action is completed. For example, you'd say it after closing a car trunk after packing for a voyage.
* **que te cagas** - a superlative of something, implying greatness. ""Una canción que te cagas"" - ""A hell of a song""
* **en plan X** - ""like (in an X way/manner)"". Example: ""Lo dije en plan broma, sabes?"" ""I meant it as a joke, you know?"" 
* **sí o no?** - question used to fish for agreement after saying something particularly witty. Maybe the best equivalent would be ""know what I mean?"", although that can also be translated as ""Sabes lo que te digo?""
* **eh** - tag question used to either ask for opinion agreement or mark emphasis. ""Te lo juro. Te mato, eh?"". ""Que calor, eh?""
* **que va!/Que dices?** - No way/yeah right!",,False,,t5_2qtt1,1353573317.0,,,True,t3_13kkf9,http://www.reddit.com/r/Spanish/comments/13kkf9/as_of_today_i_have_lived_in_spain_for_one_year/,

As you can see in the sidebar, we recently reached the 2,000 subscriber benchmark. I figured this would be the perfect time to review the state of the subreddit, and have some discussion about what features you guys want.

First and foremost let's talk about the moderators here, me and /u/morphine12. We try to keep the subreddit spam free and the post quality up to certain standards, but we are both aware of the fact that we may be falling short on a few cases. In your opinion, is our moderating adequate for the subreddit, or would you like to see another moderator added to improve things around here. Please answer honestly, as we are truly looking to improve.

Right now, we really only remove things that are clearly spam, and we try to respons to messages promptly. Of course, this is not always possible but up until now I personally think we have done a fine job. We typically don't interfere with other non-spam posts, but are there any types of posts you all would like to see be more heavily moderated (e.g. the ""Can you translate this?"" posts etc). This is the time to voice your complaints and concerns!

Moving on, the appearance subreddit has stayed essentially the same since I initially joined the mod team. I think the Red and Gold layout works just fine, but I would not be opposed to trying out other styles! Perhaps we could have some sort of 'competition' where the CSS folk here submit their design? On the topic of CSS, I initially had plans to add some type of flair for the users of the subreddit, but I scrapped that idea. Now of course, I am open to doing it again. If we were to have flair on the subreddit, what would you like to see. The two main ideas I have are either something like /r/french has (First language, 2nd language, etc) OR some type of flair indicating what country you are from. Instead of the countries, we could also just have which dialect of Spanish you speak, since this information is somewhat relevant for when you answer questions. I am open to other suggestions.

I would also like to take this time to encourage people to point out any CSS problems they have encountered on the subreddit so I can fix them! I just recently sorted out the icon problem that some of you may have noticed, and have been sweeping for other problems.

All in all, thanks for being such a great bunch, and keep being so helpful!

**Summary**

* Please voice any problems you have with the mods at this time, as well as discuss whether or not another mod is needed.

* Are there any types of posts that you would like to see banned or more heavily moderated? Also, have we been doing a good job of keeping the sub spam free?

* Are there any design changes that you would like to see? If we were to have user flair, what would you like it to be?

* Please tell me about any CSS problems you have noticed.

* Keep being awesome!  ",,False,,t5_2qtt1,False,,,True,t3_15utct,http://www.reddit.com/r/Spanish/comments/15utct/metamod_post_2000_subscribers_and_a_quick_review/,moderator
1348353256.0,53,self.Spanish,10bezz,Spanish Direct Object Pronouns - A Guide,55,2,14,http://www.reddit.com/r/Spanish/comments/10bezz/spanish_direct_object_pronouns_a_guide/,"One of the topics that can cause some trouble or confusion for new Spanish learners is the usage of direct and indirect pronouns. The usage of pronouns can make your writing and speech much less repetitive and more varied. Hopefully this guide will clear up some of the confusion!

____
###Direct Object Pronouns
##English

Direct object pronouns are usually the first ones to be introduced, so I will cover them first as well. First, let's establish what a Direct Object (DO) pronoun does in English. Consider the following sentences:

    I saw a nice looking shirt. I bought it.

The word ""It"" is the DO pronoun in this sentences, so let's look at what it is doing in that sentence.

| Subject   | Verb  | Object    |
|:---------:|:-------:|:------------:|
|      I        | bought |       it.          |

As we can see, ""it"" is neither the subject nor the verb, so it falls into the object of the sentence. What is it doing there? If you think about it, you can tell that ""it"" is actually *receiving the action of the verb*. So, we can say that DO pronouns receive the action of the verb. Similarly, ""shirt"" was the DO of the first sentence, although it is important to note that it was not a pronoun. A way to check to see if something is the Direct Object is to see if it answers the questions ""Who?"" or ""What?"". For example, ""I saw what?"" could be answered with ""a nice looking shirt"". Thus, ""a nice looking shirt"" is the DO of the first sentence. The same is true of the second sentence. ""I bought what?"" ""It.""

If you are using a DO pronoun, the pronoun must refer back to something that has already been mentioned. Consider the following sentence:

    I put it on the table.

Just by itself, this sentence is very unclear. What did I put on the table? Dinner? The newspaper? You can't tell by the given information. Consider these sentences, though:

    Where is the book?
    I put it on the table.

Now we know that ""it"" refers to ""the book"". The word or phrase that the DO pronoun refers to is called the *antecedent*. ""Book"" is the antecedent of ""it"" in the previous example. You will surely be familiar with English DO pronouns.

|Person        | Singular  | Plural  |
|:----------:|:---------:|:-------:|
|**First**    |      me     |      us    |
|**Second**|      you    |    you    |
|**Third**   | him, her, it |    them  |

##Spanish
Enough with the English lesson! You came here to learn Spanish! 

Spanish DOs serve the same function as in English, to *receive the action of the verb*. The Spanish DO pronouns are presented in the following chart.

|Person        |          Singular      |        Plural         |
|:----------:|:-----------------:|:----------------:|
| **First**   |            me          |           nos         |
|**Second**|  te (fam.), lo, la   | os(fam.), los, las |            
|**Third**   |           lo, la        |         los, las      |

While similar in function to English, the placement of DO pronouns is different in Spanish. There are two places where one can put DO pronouns in a Spanish sentence.

**1. Before a conjugated verb.**

**2. Attached to a non-conjugated verb.**

These cannot be switched- you cannot attach one to a conjugated verb, nor can you place one before an infinitive. Let's look at a few examples.

    Yo compré un regalo. 
    Yo compré el regalo en la tienda.

These sentences are very repetitive, so it would sound better if we were to replace ""el regalo"" with the DO pronoun. Which should we use though? Well, it is important to know that DO pronouns  *must agree in number and gender with the antecedent that they are replacing*. So, let's look at the antecedent- ""un regalo"". This is a third person singular, masculine noun. Looking at our chart, we can see that the appropriate pronoun in this case is ""lo"". Now, where do we place it? Looking at the sentence, we  have only a conjugated verb, so we should place the DO pronoun in front of that.

    Yo compré un regalo. 
    Yo lo compré en la tienda.

Just to get a sense of what this would mean in English, here is a quick translation. 

| Spanish  | English |
|:---------:|:-------:
|     Yo compré un regalo.      | I bought a present.
|    Yo lo compré en la tienda. | I bought it in the store.

It is common for those who have just learned about DOs to keep translating sentences word by word, leading to some confusion with DO pronouns. For example, translated word by word, the sentence ""Yo lo comprí en la tienda"" is ""I it bought in the store"". Not being used to a different word order, this throws many off. It is really beneficial to stop attempting to translate in your head and begin to try to think in the language. This can be hard though, so it is reasonable that you may continue head-translations. To avoid the above confusion, it can be helpful to translate phrase by phrase, not word by word. Let's break that sentence down into phrases to translate:

|                 |Phrase 1| Phrase 2|    Phrase 3   |  
|------------|:-------:|:-------:|:-----------:|
|**Spanish**|   Yo    | lo compré | en la tienda.|
|**English** |     I     | bought it | at the store.|

Let's examine some other examples.

    Tengo tarea. Voy a hacer la tarea mañana.

We want to replace ""tarea"" in the second sentence with the appropriate pronoun. Let's run through the checklist. The noun we are replacing is singular third person, and feminine. Thus, the pronoun we want to use is 'la'.  Furthermore, we have both an infinitive in this sentence AND a conjugated verb, so we have some options for placement. Let's see what we can do:

     Tengo tarea. Voy a hacer la tarea mañana.
     Tengo tarea. La voy a hacer mañana.
     Tengo tarea. Voy a hacerla mañana.

Some English translations, just to make sure you understand the meanings of these sentences. 
    
| Spanish  | English |
|:---------:|:-------:
|     Voy a hacer la tarea mañana.      |     I am going to do the homework tomorrow.
|    La voy a hacer mañana.              |     I am going to do it tomorrow. 
|    Voy a hacerla mañana.                |    I am going to do it tomorrow.

Notice how the placement of the pronoun does not change the meaning of the sentence- they mean exactly the same thing. A few more examples. Perhaps you are meeting a friend at a bar, but don't see him. You call him and ask:

     ¿Dónde estás?

He tell you that he is by the bathrooms. Looking there, you see he. You want to say ""I see you"". How would you do this? Well, in this sentence ""you"" satisfies the question ""whom?"" or what?"", so it is the direct object. So we want to pick the second person, familiar pronoun ""te"". Our sentence will now be:

    Te veo.

What would it be if you saw a group of friends? Depending on where you are, it could be two things. In Spain, the second person familiar, plural pronoun is ""os"", while almost everywhere else it is ""los"" (or ""las"", if the group is all female). Thus, if you are speaking to  a group, your sentence will now be:

    Os veo. (In Spain)
    Los/Las veo. (Everywhere else)

Our next example will be another where the object is a person. Your friend asks you if you know Maria.

    ¿Conoces a María?

Yo do know Maria, so you want to say ""Yes, I know her."" Maria is a third person singular, feminine pronoun. Thus, we are to use ""la"". Our sentence is thus:

    La conozco. 

What if you want to ask someone if they recognize you? Specifically, you want to ask them ""Do you recognize me?"" Here, the pronoun you will want to use is the first person singular, or ""me"". This gives us:

    ¿Me reconoces?

And they answer that they do.

##Summary

DO are nouns that receive the action of the verb. DO pronouns take the place of a DO in order to vary writing and speaking.

The noun that a DO replaces is referred to as the antecedent.

The Spanish DO pronouns are as follows:

|Person        |          Singular      |        Plural         |
|:----------:|:-----------------:|:----------------:|
| **First**   |            me          |           nos         |
|**Second**|  te (fam.), lo, la   | os(fam.), los, las |            
|**Third**   |           lo, la        |         los, las      |

DO pronouns must agree in number and gender with the antecedent that they are replacing. 

You can place DO pronouns in two places: Before a conjugated verb, or attached to the end of an infinitive.

Hopefully this guide has helped, or at the least cleared some things up. If you have any questions whatsoever, please post them in the comments and we will try to help! If you would like clarification on any point I would be happy to go over stuff. Also, does anyone have requests for the next guide? As of now, I am think of a guide on Indirect Object pronouns, but if there is demand for something else, I will do that.

Have a good day!

A few months ago I made a Mod Post asking for suggestions and throwing the idea of user flair out there. Everyone seemed to like the idea, but I never got around to implementing it (real life got in the way). Well, I finally had some free time, and I went ahead and threw something together.

I decided to go with flair indicating if Spanish is the user's native or second language, an approach very similar to what is used in /r/french (I may have even copied the color scheme... shhh don't tell them). You can go over to the side bar to see what it looks like, or just click [here](http://i.imgur.com/AKLpbU3.png). A green background indicates that the user speaks Spanish natively, while a light blue indicates that Spanish is their non-native language.

Since Spanish has many different dialects, I have made it so that the user can edit what their flair says. This should be used to indicate what dialect of Spanish they speak, are accustomed to, or where they learned Spanish. For instance, if I learned Spanish while living in Madrid, I might make my flair ""Castillian"" while picking the blue background. **Note that this user flair is self-assigned. Therefore, it is possible that the information in it is not entirely accurate. I would hope no one here lies about their experience, but I felt a warning was necessary. Also, even if you know Spanish extremely well, if it is not your first language please do NOT pick the green background.**

There is also a third user flair for those users who have degrees in Spanish or Spanish education, or really anything Spanish related. [This flair](http://i.imgur.com/aqj3xoA.png)* must be requested, and proof of said education must be sent to the mods. **Since it must be mod-verified, the level of experience of a Gold flaired user should be trusted.**

That's about it. If anyone has suggestions or concerns regarding flair, feel free to comment or send one of the mods a PM.

Thanks!

[**This is the link for our Google Hangout.**](https://plus.google.com/hangouts/_/dd8b6d7c6f5c6421859c9bc34161cd8baf502079)

Here's the deal.  Google Hangout is a video chat room.  All you need to enter is the link, and a Google account.

You can do so much in a hangout room (other than the obvious video/audio chat).  There are a maximum of 10 video participants.  Also, when I teach (English), I can link to my Google Documents for worksheets, etc.  You can also install a screen sharing app that allows you to show your screen (to display something you are doing - a game, instruction, etc.), or control the screen of others (to check their work on an exercise, etc.).

Now - how the heck do we use this thing?  Who knows?  It would be awesome if a couple of people take the lead with this part.  Basically, the hangout is available 24/7, so you can just check in whenever.  BUT, I think it would be great to have some designated times for Redditors to come in and chat with each other.  Again - it is an open room, so it is available whenever you want it.

A few etiquette items:

* When in the room, be mindful of your noise level.  If you are in a noisy place, click the mute button until you want to say something.  Keep it quiet for others!
* Spanish, please!  There are a MULTITUDE of places to speak English/other languages.  Lets keep this room at &gt;90% Spanish, please.
* Native Spanish speakers are welcome, but not required.  Even if you are a beginner - please jump right in and join in the chat!

Some housekeeping:

* Thanks to the mods for supporting this project (and thanks for maintaining this sub!)  ~~They will link to the room on the sidebar.~~ They HAVE linked to it on the sidebar.  THANKS!

* If this goes well, and there is a need for hangouts with different language levels, then I will create those.  But, just to test the waters, I am just making one room.

This is OUR project.  If you have any ideas, or projects, PLEASE post them, or send me a PM.

Ok!  Let's make this happen!  Post your ideas for times, uses, etc. in this thread!

PS:  Here is the actual link, listed out in all it's glory:

I'm looking ideally for something FROM an actual Spanish speaking country, not something say, American produced that airs in California or Texas. My hope is that if it comes from an actual Spanish country, it will teach me proper Spanish.

Right now I can read Spanish fairly well, but I really can't keep up with normal TV shows/movies/news in Spanish. I'm hoping that kids shows will be slow enough for me to follow and help put things in better context (plus show me how some of the words are spelled)

1356211563.0,22,self.Spanish,15aog1,Spanish Indirect Object Pronouns - A Guide,26,4,12,http://www.reddit.com/r/Spanish/comments/15aog1/spanish_indirect_object_pronouns_a_guide/,"[**Read the Direct Object pronoun guide first!**](http://www.reddit.com/r/Spanish/comments/10bezz/spanish_direct_object_pronouns_a_guide/)

Along with Direct Object pronouns (DOs), Indirect Object pronouns (IDOs) can cause some confusion for speakers of all skill levels. Mastering their usage allows one to vary his or her speech, and greatly increases reading comprehension. Hopefully this guide gets you on the right track!

_____
###Indirect Object Pronouns
##English

As we learned from the previous pronoun guide, Direct Objects receive the action of the verb. They *directly* are affected by the action being done, so to speak. Thinking of it this way, Indirect Objects can be said to receive the DOs. They *indirectly* are affected by the action being done. But what does that actually mean? Let's look at an example in an attempt to clear things up:

    I bought a shirt. I bought it for you.

In the second sentence above, ""you"" is the IDO. Let's take apart this sentence to see what each part is doing. 

|   Subject   |    Verb   |      Object       |
|:----------:|:-------:|:--------------:|
|       I        |  bought  |      it for you.   |

We can see that ""I"" is the subject and ""bought"" is the verb, which places the rest in the object of the sentence. What is ""you"" doing there? Let us further pick apart the object.

| Direct Object |  Prepositional Phrase |
|:------------:|:-------------------:|
|       it          |           for you.        |

We know that ""it"" is the DO (if you can't see why, please review the [Direct Object guide](http://www.reddit.com/r/Spanish/comments/10bezz/spanish_direct_object_pronouns_a_guide/)). That leaves us the prepositional phrase ""for you"". What meaning does this add to the sentence? Well, without this phrase, we would not know for whom the shirt was bought. Adding ""for you"" indicates that ""you"" receive the ""it"" of the sentence. That is, you receive the shirt that was bought, since it was bought for you. Thus, we can say that the IDO ""receives"" the DO. Alternatively, the IDO *indirectly*  receives the action in the sentence; it receives it  by means of the DO. 

A good way to check if something is the IDO of the sentence is to see if it answers the question ""For Whom?"" or ""To whom"" the action is being done. For example, ""I bought it for whom?"" can be answered with ""you"". Thus, ""you"" is the IDO of the sentence. Something interesting to note is that the first sentence does not have an IDO. There is no indication in that sentence for whom the shirt was bought. Not every sentence HAS to have an IDO, and in reality many won't have them. They are much less common to see than DOs are, but that is not to say they are rare. 

Also note that the IDO need not be a pronoun, though it often is. The example sentence previously used could just as easily be ""I bought it for Bill"". ""Bill"" is still the IDO in this sentence (he answers the question ""for whom was the shirt bought?), but ""Bill"" is not a pronoun. If you use a pronoun for the IDO, however, it must refer back to something, known as the antecedent. This concept is very similar to the antecedent used with DO pronouns - in fact, it is almost identical. Let's look at some example sentences.

    I bought it for him.

Alone, this sentence is very unclear. If we add some context, it will become clearer.

     I saw a shirt that Bill would like.
     I bought it for him.

Now we know that ""him"" refers to Bill, and ""it"" refers to ""shirt"". You will recognize English IDOs as something you use every day:

|  Person   |   Singular   |    Plural    |
|:--------:|:----------:|:---------:|
| **First**   |       Me      |      Us      |
|**Second**|       You     |    You      |
| **Third**  |  Him, Her, It|     Them   |

##Spanish

That was a long English section! Hopefully you now know what an IDO does, and this will help you learn how to use them in Spanish. Just as in English, the IDO is the *person or thing for whom the action is being done*. In Spanish, the IDOs are as follows:

|  Person   |   Singular   |    Plural    |
|:--------:|:----------:|:---------:|
| **First**   |       Me      |      Nos             |
|**Second**|       Te(fam.), Le |    Os(fam.), Les   |
| **Third**  |        Le     |           Les         |

The placement of IDO pronouns is very similar to the placement of DO pronouns. They can go in two locations:

**1. Before a conjugated verb.**

**2. Attached to a non-conjugated verb.**

Again, these cannot be reversed. You can't attach them to the end of a conjugated verb, nor can you place them before an infinitive. Time for more examples!

    Yo envié una carta a Juan.

This sentence sounds alright as it is, but what if we didn't want that ""para ti"" at the end? We could replace it with an IDO pronoun, since ""ti"" in this case is the IDO! How do we choose which one to use? Well, an IDO must agree in number and person with their antecedent. ""Juan"" is third person singular, so ""le"" is the appropriate pronoun to use here. Thus, our new sentence is:

    Yo envié una carta a Juan.
    Yo le envié una carta.

Hold on a moment though, does this mean that ""Le"" can stand for him, her, it, AND you? Yes, it does! Often times, what a pronoun refers to can be ambiguous, even with context. Consider the sentence:

    Yo le compré un regalo.

This could mean a few things:

    I bought her a gift.
    I bought him a gift.
    I bought it a gift.
    I bought you a gift.

In order to avoid situations like this, you will often see sentences with BOTH the pronoun and antecedent in the same sentence. This is to avoid ambiguous cases like the one above. One way to fix the sentence would be to say:

    Yo le compré un regalo a Juan.

This may seem strange, since English never does this. It is however necessary, so don't shy away from using it. This redundancy does make word-for-word translations difficult, since a word for word translation of the above sentence would be something like:

|                   |    Phrase 1    |     Phrase 2      |    Phrase 3  | Phrase 4| 
|:-----------:|:------------:|:--------------:|:------------:|:-------:|
| **Spanish**|      Yo          |     le compré    |     un regalo |   a Juan.|
| **English** |        I          |       bought him |       a gift    |  for Juan.|

It sounds strange in English, but I assure you that this is normal for Spanish.

In other cases, you would choose the right IDO in a similar way to how you chose the correct DO; make sure it agrees, and make sure the placement is right. What happens if you have BOTH a DO and an IDO? In some cases, it's just a matter of knowing that Indirect Object pronouns ALWAYS come before the Direct Object pronouns. In other cases, it can be a bit tricky. Let's look at an example.

     Yo preparo la comida para ti.

What if we wanted to replace BOTH ""la comida"" and ""para ti""? Well, we must first find the appropriate pronouns for each. For ""la comida"", the pronoun we would want to use is ""la"", while for ""ti"" it is te. We only have a conjugated verb in this sentence, so both must go before the verb. Furthermore, we know IDOs come before DOs, so te is going to come first. Thus, our new sentence is:

    Yo te la preparo.

If we had a sentence with an infinitive, the process would be the same, but the placement would be slightly different.

    Yo voy a preparar la comida para tí.

Becomes

    Yo voy a preparártela.

Notice that there is now an accent on ""preparar"". This is because we want to keep the stress on the first syllable, and without the accent it would fall on the ""te"". This too is an important rule; whenever you have two attached pronouns, there will be an accent on the third to last syllable.

That is simple enough, but as I said, it can sometimes be a bit trickier. Imagine we have a similar sentence as before, but the IDO is different.

    Yo doy el dinero a Juan.

If we were to replace both of these with the appropriate pronouns, our new sentence would be:

    Yo le lo doy.

This doesn't sound quite right, now does it? The two sounds of ""le lo"" or ""les lo"" are never found together. In this case, you change the IDO to ""se"". Thus, the correct sentence would be:

    Yo se lo doy.

This is true whenever this sound combination occurs, regardless of if the original IDO was le or les. Using our example where we attach to the end of the infinitive, our sentence changes as such:

    Yo voy a dar el dinero a Juan.
    Yo voy a dárselo.

That is about as tricky as it will get.

##Summary

IDOs indirectly receive the action of the verb through the direct object. Not every sentence has to have a indirect object.

The word that the IDO pronoun replaces is known as the antecedent.

The Spanish IDO pronouns are as follows:

|  Person   |   Singular   |    Plural    |
|:--------:|:----------:|:---------:|
| **First**   |       Me      |      Nos             |
|**Second**|       Te(fam.), Le |    Os(fam.), Les   |
| **Third**  |        Le     |           Les         |

IDOs agree in number and person with their antecedent.

They can be placed before a conjugated verb, or attached to the end of the infinitive. When attached to an infinitive, the stress falls on the third to last syllable.

To avoid ambiguity, it is sometimes necessary to use both the pronoun and antecedent in the same sentence.

When using a DO and IDO pronoun in the same sentence, the IDO pronoun always comes first. Sometimes it is necessary to replace ""le"" or ""les"" with ""se"".
_____

That's it folks! Hopefully this guide helped you somewhat. I ended up doing less examples in this one, because there was a lot more to explain, and I felt as though much of the examples would be the same as in the DO guide. Also, I did fewer direct translations due to the fact that they get more difficult at to do word for word at this point, and that you should begin to steer away from that. For the next guide, I was thinking of something on preterit versus imperfect, or perhaps the subjunctive. We shall see!

I have quite a few friends from Spanish-speaking countries, namely Argentina, Costa Rica, and Spain.

When I was in Spain with a travel group, I stayed with a local family in Cataluña for three days. The experience was probably the highlight of my three-week trip, and I'd learned so much about the Spanish culture that I had only previously had the opportunity to read about.

When I was there, I was extremely surprised at the level of proficiency I had gained without realizing it. At first, I was speaking basic Spanish... and then all of a sudden I was (albeit, not well, but... functionally) explaining the US political system, our current economy, and our dilemma with clean energy. 

I don't always know whether I'm saying things correctly, but the best advice I think my teacher gave me this past year, when I really began to gain proficiency with talking, was to stop thinking and just talk. Sure, I might slip up every now and then but that's not la problema (.... ;) fue una broma).

After getting past these obstacles ((speaking and certain phrases, namely things I hadn't learned in school (pensaba/estaba/sería/será/ tomaré/etc.)) I realized the rest way ~~easy~~ less difficult than I had made it out to be.

**TL;DR:** For me, the point at which I suddenly began to understand things I'd never heard before or recognize verbal patterns to understand what was being said or written was immediately after I began communicating in Spanish, both through my phone and in real life. Through speaking alone, I've learned many phrases, prepositions, pronunciations, and verbs I wouldn't have otherwise learned.

At one time, I was pretty good at it, but the one thing I never really intuitively understood was reflexive and object pronouns. Like I said, I'm not even sure if those are two different things. I'm pretty sure they are not, but I can never tell when to use one or the other. I've been relearning Spanish after 3 or 4 years off, and I just got the the Object Pronouns lesson on Duolingo. It is predictably infuriating. Aside from not really intuitively understanding in general, here are a few specific questions:  
  
-How do I know when to use ""le"" or ""les"" and when to use ""lo"" or ""los?""  As an example, in this Duolingo lesson, I was supposed to mark correct translations of ""I respect them."" I knew ""Yo las respeto a ellas"" was right, but I assumed that given that, the masculine equivalent would have to be ""Yo los respeto a ellos."" But ""Yo les respeto a ellos"" was also considered a correct answer. Why not los? Or would los also be correct? Could ""le"" or ""les"" refer to feminine nouns?
-Is a sentence like ""Tú nos quieres a nosotros"" as clunky and unnecessary as it sounds to me, or is there a reason to add the extra words at the end? It is also possible that that sentence is just wrong, since I made it up just now and I don't understand how pronouns work.  
-Where does ""se"" fit in? Is it the same as ""le,"" or does it mean something different? Or is it only used in specific situations?  
  

Anyway, any resources would be useful, or if you can just explain these things to me in a reply, that would be great too. Duolingo is great, but I can eventually blunder through the pronoun lessons without ever understanding the underlying concepts. Thanks for your help.

Sorry I forgot the link 

Rosetta Stone offers this free service of speaking and playing games with native speakers of your target language. 

I'm assuming the service is free because most of their market is in the US. Part of their package includes being able to speak with native speakers so they've opened it up to everyone.

The downside is that there are still not a lot of users (I'm going to re-post in a couple of more language learning subreddits because I think many can profit from this tool). However, for Spanish, there's usually always an opportunity to find a native speaker learning English.

The way the games work is that you do the first 4-6min session (or for however long you want to chat) in one language, then the other one in Spanish or the target language. 

The site recommends you be at conversation level and won't let you check ""beginner"" for you language level (I'm guessing this is so they can get you to buy their product and learn) but as long as you're comfortable holding a simple conversation or talk about a simple topic prompted by the program, you will be fine. 

Also, you can speak with other users learning your target language.

I have a couple that have helped me; I picked them up from native-speaking friends and from around the Internet. And please, by all means, if you're a native speaker and you see a mistake in one of these rules definitely do correct it.

a) You cannot use the imperfect of ""estar"" + gerund (like ""estaba leyendo"") to describe a past action unless you also include another verb in the sentence
	
-BAD: Yo estaba leyendo.

-GOOD: Yo leía.

-GOOD: Yo estaba leyendo cuando Bender me llamó.

b) You can only use the present simple tense of a verb to describe a future action if you include a time signifier in the sentence, such as ""in 20 minutes"" or ""next week"". 

-BAD: Comemos (en 2 horas) (Understood as ""We eat"" or ""We're  eating,"" which is not what you want if you talking about something in the future)

-GOOD: Comemos en 2 horas 

-GOOD: Vamos para Hawaii la semana que viene

-Etc.

c) You cannot use the present simple tense of ""hacer"" to describe future actions
	
-BAD: Yo hago ejercicios esta tarde

-GOOD: Voy a hacer ejercicios esta tarde (""I'm going to exercise this 
afternoon"")

-GOOD: Esta tarde hare ejercicios (I'll exercise this afternoon)

d) There is one exception to using ""estar"" when describing the location of something. It is when you're talking about the location of an EVENT
	
-BAD: La fiesta estará en la casa de Professor Farnsworth

-GOOD: La fiesta será en la case de Professor Farnsworth

e) When you're talking about authorship: Use ""por"" when describing about the authored work with a verb in past tense. Use ""de"" when not
	
-BAD: Tengo un libro POR Heinlein
 
-GOOD: Tengo un libro DE Heinlein

-BAD: Este libro fue escrito DE Leela

-GOOD: Este libro fue escrito POR Leela

f) I'm not sure about this one. Here's the situation. a) You're describing a past event and b) using the verb ""estar"" like ""estuve estudiando"" and c) using ""durante""…all in the same sentence. There is a difference in meaning depending on whether you say ""estuve estudiando"" or ""estudié"".

If you are a 1st or 2nd year Spanish student and need help getting through your class in the coming term, I'd like to help.

Learning languages is definitely an interest of mine, but it's become more of a hobby rather than career choice. I've tutored 1st/2nd year students before and I've found that I enjoyed it quite a bit. I will not be charging for this, as I'm just planning on building up more ""resume"" experience, but I would still give students all necessary attention. This coming term, I'm hoping to find one or two students to tutor on a regular basis.

First off, I am going to apologize in advance if this seems naive, too broad or if this has been asked already, But I would really like to continue learning Spanish, but Spanish from Spain specifically. No offense to any other country that speaks Spanish, I just like how it sounds from Spain (the use of Vosotros, the use of a th sound instead of a z or c). And when I say learn, I mean I want to speak like one, use the vernacular etc. I have already taken two years of Spanish so I know some Spanish already, and I was taught all of the conjugations for Vosotros. I use Duolingo for Italian mainly, but I have tried the Spanish and it seems to focus on more latin american Spanish. I also have used a little of verbling and I also have used Memrise but couldn't find a specific course for what I am looking for. ¡Ayudame por favor! I'm not sure if this matters, but my native language is English (American).

A few months ago I was feeling that I wasn't really getting enough Spanish reading practice. Whenever I started reading paragraphs of Spanish stuff, the words blend together and it starts to seem like a great mess of text. I've no problem reading English since it's my first language, but Spanish? ehh...

I found that I could use manga to practice. It's fun to read and since the dialogue is presented in pieces, it doesn't feel over whelming. 

Basically, Batoto.net has translations of tons of different manga so there is always an English version and sometimes a version translated to a different language (I'm terrible at explaining stuff, I know).

Regularization of the following irregular verb conjugations:

* Radical stem changes: quiero becomes **quero**, this is clearly an archaism still kept. In fact this feature still remains in some parts of the northwest of Spain such as Asturias and Galicia.

* Irregular present indicative 1st person singular: salgo becomes **salo**, vengo becomes **veno**.

* Irregular subjunctive: subjunctive present of haber becomes **haiga** (esp. est. haya).

* haber as an auxiliary verb: ""nosotros **hamos** comido"" instead of ""nosotros hemos comido"", ""yo ha comido"" instead of ""yo he comido"".

As well as some [phonetic realizations](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Mexican_Spanish#Phonetic_variation) mentioned on the article:

* Abuelo -&gt; [aˈɣʷwe.lo]
* Ella -&gt; [ˈe.a]
* me fui -&gt; [meˈwi]

Anyway I've been somewhat spoiled by it, because now trying to read Spanish articles without being able to do the same is driving me insane. I can't find anything similar though browsing online, does nobody here use anything similar?

How do you decide which form of lo to use in different expressions?

For example, do you always say lo mismo or lo menos when talking about something or does it depend on the gender/number?

Also do you ever say ""el mismo"" or is the phrase always ""lo mismo""?

Of course, learning to read it also important!
With so many options (dictionaries, grammar-books, quiz-books, mini-stories) there are a lot of options to choose.  When starting out, I think that it could be quite daunting to see 25 options of grammar books - which to choose?

As someone who is a Spanish student myself, I thought i'd share a book that I thought was really interesting that could help many people.  I liked it because it is written in a funny comedic way, and is not at all set up like a typical ""textbook"".  What is also interesting is the author is an American who has learned Spanish over 10 years, so he talks in the point of view of someone who has ""been there done that"" - he knows where the typical English person gets confused on words as the literal translation in Spanish could be funky.

The book is called **Breaking Out of Beginners Spanish** - albeit I think it is suited for more of an intermediate learner - it still holds value at the beginner's level.

This book also helps to curse - how cool is that? :)

I am currently studying Spanish in my spare time. Considering I started last week, I believe I have a decent hold on grammar so far. I am putting off learning vocabulary and irregular verbs until later.

To give some background, I am an Arab. I speak Arabic and English, and was a bit of an Arabic grammar nerd in High School. I studied English through all my school years yet never really understood anything. As in, I could form basic sentences and form simple requests but this is it.

One summer I decided I wanted to master English, I got the Harry Potter series (which has relatively simple language in the beginning) and a local Electronic English-Arabic-English dictionary [(like this one)](http://www.translatorsbuyingguide.com/select_model.php?id=279). By the time I finished the book I was able too pretty much read anything else. I then developed my speech by watching movies with subtitles. I mastered English within a year, but I digress.

I am planning a similar process with Spanish. I am trying all the basic grammar I can, which I got with a Collins Grammar book, in addition to basic sentences in the form of a phrase book.

The problem is that I want something like the aforementioned dictionary but for the iPhone, mainly because it is A) cheaper B) I already have the iPhone with me. The dictionary was great help because I could search any word with any conjugation and it would take me to the appropriate page, *and* list any idioms the word is used in.

I have looked at the different Dictionary apps from Collins and Oxford but they're expensive, and I am not willing to commit money before knowing it will suit me. I tried some of the free apps (SpanishDict) but it couldn't find, for example, ""voy"". (Maybe not particularly voy, but I tried a couple of things and they didn't work.)

There aren't Spanish books or resources where I live (Saudi), except for phrasebooks and dictionaries. But I can find plenty of those online, Not to mention that I might go to Spain within the next couple of months. If you have any particular easy books to suggest I am all ears. Is Don Quixote beginner-friendly, for example?

One more thing, I sometimes have questions or specific queries that are not in the dictionary. This wasn't a problem when my whole family spoke English, but with Spanish the market is less tight. Is there a place where I can shoot questions and get immediate, or almost immediate answers, other than this subreddit? Making a whole post to ask whether the correct translation for ""Call me"" is ""Llama me"" or ""Me llama"" seems too little a question for the huge overhead of reddit. (I learned later it is ""Llamame"" .. so there. Or is it ""Llamame usted""?)

---

Edit: **TL;DR:** I am looking for:

* Quality iPhone dictionaries with idioms
* Books suggestions suitable for beginners 
* A place where I can ask minor questions informally without the reddit overhead. Even if simply a Whatsapp contact or a twitter account.",,False,,t5_2qtt1,1355212688.0,,second,True,t3_14nmox,http://www.reddit.com/r/Spanish/comments/14nmox/iphone_apps_to_learn_spanish_elementary_books/,

So I am working ahead of my Spanish II class.  I've introduced myself to the verb tenses that haven't been covered (preterit, imperfect, future, conditional, subjunctive, perfect tenses) and can read them if I'm given a moment.  The issue is that I am completely unable to hear them in speech.  I have been trying the music/movies/games in Spanish approach, and I don't really think it is making much of a difference because all of those media incorporate all of tenses at once.  It is simply too much to take on in one fell swoop, and I don't think my mind is making much sense of any of it.  However, I can easily understand the present tense (assuming I know the words being said) without translating, probably just from listening to it in class.

I am looking for a good program that builds listening comprehension in steps, so that I am not forced to listen for and make sense of 6+ verb tenses at once.  Like a system that starts with present tense, adds the preterit, then the imperfect and builds on itself until everything is incorporated.  I am going to keep listening to music/movies etc., because I think it is helping to some extent, but I think anybody will agree that it is more effective to tackle each tense one at a time, rather than all at once.

My spanish class moves far to slow for me to ever develop an ear for any other tense before college.  I am willing to spend money on a product, as long as it isn't something excessively expensive (like Rosetta Stone, which I hear isn't that good anyway).  Also, I would like for there to be a method to test myself, rather than just listening to recording after recording without any questions.

Yo he estado leyendo un libro que se llama “Fundamentos de fonología y fonética española para hablantes de inglés”, por Eva Núñez Méndez. La información que contiene mi ensayo viene solamente de este libro y yo la considero como opinión en gran parte. Claro que la naturaleza del lenguaje es un tema muy complejo y un ensayo muy cortito no pueda ser completo. 

Que es el lenguaje? Este ensayo corto busca contestar, muy brevemente, la pregunta: Como se diferencia el lenguaje humano del animal?

Hay unas calidades específicas que diferencia el lenguaje humano del animal. El primer es el aprendizaje y la transmisión cultural. Cuando nacen los animales, ya tienen un conocimiento de comunicarse tras los sonidos en mensajes muy simples. Los humanos, al contrario, tienen que aprender el lenguaje de su entorno. Los humanos nacen con la capacidad de aprender y entender.

La segunda propiedad es la dualidad. Es decir que el lenguaje humano se organizan en dos capas: los sonidos individuos, y las combinaciones posibles que resultan por la unión de los sonidos. Esta dualidad hace mucho más versátil y flexible el lenguaje humano que el animal. 

La propiedad de dualidad cuadra bien con el carácter discreto o combinatorio del lenguaje humano. Las combinaciones posibles siguen reglas bien definidas por cada idioma. Estas reglas definan más que los sonidos, también se llaman fonemas; también dice cómo formar oraciones aceptables al nivel sintáctico. Todos los elementos de un lenguaje mantienen una serie de colocaciones especificas dentro del sistema. El lenguaje humano necesita tener este carácter discreto para ser tan expresivo, flexible, y creativo. 

El carácter expresivo del lenguaje humano implica la cuarta diferencia distinta: el desplazamiento. El lenguaje humano puede expresar dos temas de que el lenguaje animal no tiene concepto: puede describirse  referirse, y puede hablar del futuro, el pasado, y lo ajeno. El lenguaje animal puede hablar solamente de situaciones y condiciones en el presente, y no tiene conocimiento del forma del lenguaje o los mensajes. En contraste, el lenguaje humano puede describir las palabras usadas por varios métodos en una función metalingüística. Cuando se habla de los adverbios, los verbos, y la gramática, se usa un conocimiento de usar un lenguaje. También,  se puede discutir temas ajenos al entorno entre el emisor y el receptor.


Claro, hay muchas diferencias más entre el lenguaje humano y el animal, pero este ensayo corto serviría comenzar el proceso de pensar en la lingüística y la naturaleza del lenguaje humano.

Yesterday I found a little boy who was scared and lost (couldn't find his mom), and I was really upset with myself that I couldn't talk to him.

- Where is your grown-up?  
- Where is your teacher?
- I don't know.
- I can help you.

- Don't worry.
- This is my friend _______.  _______ is going to help us find your adult.

I've only studied Spanish for about 5 months or so and am not taking the AP class.  That being said, I feel like I've made loads of progress in such a short period of time and feel pretty ready for the test (which is known to be extremely challenging).  One of the components is a synthesis essay of at least 200 words, where 2 written sources and 1 audio source are given, and the student synthesizes the information to write the essay.  The prompt was to comment on the continued existence of the bullfight in Spain.  The sources have to be sited (which I have done) and your own opinion needs to be given as well (which I think I have lacked)

(Side note: I'm not trying to insult a culture here by saying the bullfight should be done away with.  I see both sides of the argument, but with the information I was given, it was much easier to make a case for the side that I did.  It doesn't really accurately represent my real opinion, which is fine.)

I am typing the essay as written in 30 minutes without any aids (dictionaries or translators.  I took it as if it were the real test).

La corrida de toros ha sido una costumbre muy importante durante la historia de españa.  Aun así, hoy en día, la corrida de toros se ve como inhumana y demasiada violenta.  Como la corrida está siendo reemplazada por otros deportes, otros países quieren que se paren, y la gente está dándose cuenta de que es violenta, creo que la corrida debe ser dejada en el pasado.

Primero, la corrida está en peligro de ser reemplazada por fútbol.  Todas las fuentes se están de acuerdo con esto.  Fuente 1 dice que la corrida ahora sólo es para turísticas, y que la gente de españa suele ver fútbol en vez de la corrida.  La mujer de Madrid en fuente 3 dijo que ella nunca asiste a las corridas, y que preferiría que fútbol la reemplazara.  Por fin, fuente 2 dice que los jovenes de españa ven a los jugadores de fútbol como sus héroes, y ya no se ven así los matadores.  Por eso, pronto, esta generación va a ser los adultos de españa, y la corrida será puesta en el pasado.

Segundo, otros países quieren que la gente pare las corridas.  En fuente 2, se dice que el Reino Unido quería que las corridas ya no pasaran antes de que españa pudiera ser parte del Mercado Común por su violencia.  Aunque españa se permitió reunir de todos modos, es obvio del heco que el Reino Unido entabló la negociación con españa que al primer mundo le gustaría si los corridas se pararan.

Por fin, aun la gente de españa se da cuenta de que las corridas no necesitan quedarse en su cultura.  La ciudad de Cataluña votó por retirar las corridas, según fuente 2.  De todos modos las raices de la corrida no se encuentran en españa.  Según los hechos de fuente 1, comenzó en las islas de Creta y Grecia, cuentos de la Biblia explican el uso de toros como sacrifico, y que de hecho Julio César inició las corridas como entretenamiento.  Indubitablemente la corrida es una parte imprescindible de la historia de españa, pero como dijo la mujer en fuente 3: es el tiempo para terminarla.

En todo, la corrida se necesita dejar en el pasado.  Su valor ya no existe, y hoy en día se ve como horrible y detestable.  La gente no debe ignorar su pasado, pero algunas tradiciones no caben en una época moderna.

El mayo pasado, viajé a Ecuador con una clase de ecología para estudiar el bosque nublado. Mi tiempo en Ecuador era muy interesante e inolvidable. Comencé mi viaje con un vuelo de avión a la ciudad capital de Quito. Quito era una ciudad vieja, y era rodeaba de volcanes. Mientras en Quito, yo comí muchas comidas locales. Me comí la comida tradicional cuy. Cuy era muy rico, pero no tenía mucha carne. En Quito, yo compré cada día. Pasé muchas horas paseando por la ciudad y mirando los edificios viejos. Había muchas iglesias católicas. Entonces, tuve la oportunidad caminar en la línea del ecuador, o “la mitad del mundo”.
      
   Después yo fui en Quito, viajé a una ciudad se llama Cosanga. Cosanga era una ciudad muy pobre, y muchas personas indígenas vivían allí. De Cosanga, viajamos cinco kilómetros en la selva a una estación de investigación se llama Yanayacu. El bosque que rodeaba Yanayacu tenía la mayoría de los tipos de plantas y animales del mundo! Estuve en Yanayacu por 14 días. Pasé el tiempo caminando en la selva y buscando insectos. Vi muchas tarántulas, mariposas y pájaros. La cosa más inolvidable que encontré fue un gusano de 6 pies! Mientras en Consanga, hice buenos amigos. Todavía hablo con mis amigos de Cosanga en Internet. Me divertí mientras yo estuve en Yanayacu.
     
 Mi tiempo en Ecuador me inspiró para aprender a español. Me gustaría vivir y trabajar allí uno día para ayudar la gente local. Recomiendo que todo el mundo viaja a Ecuador si tienen la oportunidad.

A little background: I chose the topic because one of the best ways I learn Spanish so far, especially Spanish grammar, is by talking (in English--I'm only taking Spanish for the first time ever this semester) to native Spanish speakers (mainly my SO and his family) whose English is ""conversational"" or fluent but self-taught. I find the mistakes they make in English really useful for learning grammar rules and sentence structure and whatnot. But what also pops up from time to time is an idiomatic phrase translated directly to English that either makes no sense in English or makes sense but is something I've never heard before. The best example I can think of is when my SO told me he had ""stomach hands"" when it came to headphones. To have stomach hands (""tener manos de estomago"") means that you destroy everything you touch, basically, so it makes sense intuitively, but I have never heard of it being used in English anywhere. Another phrase I learned from him was ""amarrar navajas"" when he jokingly asked me ""Why are you tying knives to my words?"" The term ""to tie razor blades"" means adding unkind connotations to someone's words when repeating them to another person in order to create conflict and drama. Again, it makes total sense, but I'd never heard the term before; I had thought he was just being dramatic, because he often has somewhat flowery speech. When learning another language, I think phrases like these are extremely important, because it often isn't clear what the meaning is if you've never heard it before, like if someone just says ""no me amarres navajas"" and your context clues are limited. I kinda treat them like vocabulary words.

So anyway, the reason I'm asking for help is that I don't currently have a lot of these phrases to use in my presentation, and I was hoping that some of you might have heard similar types of things from people whose first language is Spanish (especially if they learned Spanish in Mexico, since my presentation is specific to Mexico). Idioms that you have learned in other ways, such as from coming across them online/in a book, would also be useful, especially if they are very common, and haven't fallen out of use. My presentation is meant to be useful for learning and speaking Spanish, so while older idioms are interesting, they don't quite fit with what I'm trying to do.

**TL;DR:** Seeking idioms used in Mexican Spanish that haven't fallen out of common use, especially if you learned them directly from a native speaker.

Oh, and it's alright if the idioms are a little vulgar, because this is for a university class, not, like, jr high (and also because I love colorful vulgarity).",,False,,t5_2qtt1,False,,,True,t3_12zjo3,http://www.reddit.com/r/Spanish/comments/12zjo3/seeking_some_help_with_spanish_class_project/,

Mi instituto tiene muchas buenas instalaciones por ejemplo hay una piscina, muchos pizarras interactivas y un campo muy grande.

Sin embargo muchas alumnos abusan los instalaciones por ejemplo algunos de los ordenadores están roto y esto no beneficia a nadie.  (76 words)

En mi instituto estudio muchas asignaturas como el español, las ingles y las tres ciencias la química, la biología y la física. A mi modo de pensar la química es mejor asignatura porque la química me ayuda para comprender el mudo que te rodea por ejemplo por que las hojas cambian sus colores en el otoño. También mi profesor de química tiene un estilo de enseñanza diferente que es muy excéntrica. (71 words)

En mi instituto hay muchos normas y pienso que la mayoría de ellos son muy absurdos y tontos. Por ejemplo el teléfono móvil está prohibido en el instituto. Esta norma es arma de doble filo porque por un lado los alumnos no se distraigan en clase pero por otro lado lo puede ser peligroso en caso de emergencia. En mi opinión los benéficos pesan más que los desventajas y pienso que el teléfono móvil se debe permitir especialmente cuando podría salvar las vidas de los personas.  (86 words)

La educación es más importante para mi futuro y los problemas en mi colegio pueden  afectar mi futuro mucho. El mayor problema en mi colegio es el frasco escolar y la razón principal es el estrés de los examines que es un problema serio. Reconozco que no es fácil para todo el mundo sacar buenas notas pero si preparas para los examines  tendrás éxito. (64 words)

En el bachillerato desearía estudiar las matemáticas, la química, la biología, la física y el español.

1360181290.0,6,self.Spanish,180nag,A suggestion for students: collective nouns instead of (male) neutral ones.,16,10,12,http://www.reddit.com/r/Spanish/comments/180nag/a_suggestion_for_students_collective_nouns/,"All of you know most Spanish nouns have a gender. You also know the neutral form of the nouns and articles are, for the most part, the same as the masculine form. For example, if you have only male employees in your company, you say *los empleados*; but if you have both male and female employees, you still say *los empleados*. Even if 9 out of 10 employees are women, it's still *los empleados*.

While grammatically and etymologically correct (Roman culture wasn't exactly egalitarian after all), you can see this use of the language kind of makes women and girls invisible, and for some of us it doesn't feel right to do that.

Now, you may or may not be concerned about this. If you are, there's an easy way out: collective nouns. Following the previous example, *los empleados* becomes *la plantilla* or *el personal*. It's not going to be possible in all cases, but when it can be done it's a really easy, painless change; and this way you're using a truly generic term which doesn't look like either the male or the female corresponding, individual noun, so our Spanish becomes a bit more equitable. That's a good thing, isn't it? :)

For those still reading, here's a short list of suggestions off the top of my head (contributions would be great!):

*Los alumnos* → (just one class) *La clase*; (the whole school) *el alumnado*.  
*Los soldados* → *Las tropas*; *el contingente*  
*Los votantes* → *El electorado*  
*Los ciudadanos* → *La ciudadanía*  
*Los políticos* → *La clase política*  
*Todos* → *Toda persona*; *todo el mundo*  
*Muchos desempleados* → *Mucha gente desempleada*  
*Los vecinos* → *El vecindario*; *la comunidad*

¿Cómo estás?   Espero que usted y su familia están bien y estamos mirando adelante a encuentros esta temporada de vacaciones con la familia y muchos amigos.

Pensamos a menudo, y su historia continúa inspirando a muchos pacientes que vienen a verme después de períodos de frustración prolongada con fracaso del tratamiento convencional.

(hija), (hijo) y (hija) estarán casa con nosotros para la Navidad.  

(hija), nuestro más antiguo, fue casado en agosto de este año.  Actualmente está terminando su doctorado en terapia física y listo para mudarse a Chicago para unirse a su marido (hombre), quien también es un terapeuta físico. Ambos corredores avid y han hecho maratones juntos.

(hijo) sigue creciendo como músico en la ciudad de Nueva York.  Es música y tocando en una banda llamada Luna Hooch.  Tienen un nuevo agente de negocios y están haciendo varias giras este año.  (hijo) es pasar las 3 semanas entre nuestra celebración de acción de gracias y Navidad en India, donde va a estudiar Tabla drumming (un instrumento tradicional indio).

(hija) está trabajando duramente en OSU y está haciendo bien en química, matemáticas y biología, haber hecho la transición desde un enfoque de arte cuando empezó el colegio.  Ella es ahora una antropología principal en una trayectoria de 5 años pre-medicina.

(esposa) está trabajando en su próximo espectáculo ""Aqua Vita"" y activo en conferencias.  Usted puede siempre encontrar ella en el internet en (website) mi práctica y la investigación va muy bien.  Estamos publicando varios documentos importantes este año y ampliar el foco de nuestro trabajo para incluir la regeneración de hueso y cartílago.  Hemos sido bendecidos con algunos muy buenos estudiantes.

He tenido un golpe en mi viaje de internationaI el año pasado.  Estuvimos en Viena para dar una charla en la reunión anual de la sociedad internacional para la ingeniería de tejidos y medicina regenerativa (TERMIS).

I recently hit that point, and now I'm studying like crazy. I finished the Duolingo course, started a blog on Lang-8, and am about to take my first official Spanish class at College, even though it's probably too basic for me.

Obviously the first two groups are bilingual, but there aren't many bilingual people who started in English.

All you fluent speakers and those with high degrees, is there anything I should do (short of immersion, which isn't possible quite yet) to really improve my Spanish? There's a conversation group that I'm going to join, but that only meets once a month!

El Impacto de las Nuevas Tecnologías en el Arte
	
Los humanos. Somos un violento, ilógico tipo de seres. Con las guerras, la violencia, y la discriminación podemos decir que sólo somos animales. Pero hay arte. El arte puede crear discusión, puede motivar personas de cambiar el mundo. Este es exactamente lo que el arte puede hacer. Así cuando algo, como la tecnología, cambia fundamentalmente el arte, muchas personas son afectados. Nuevas tecnologías han fervorosamente impactado los artistas, los museos, y las personas de arte. 
El artista es alguien que quiere comunicar un mensaje a todos, que quiere impactar la sociedad. Con computadoras nuevas, solo pocos efectos especiales pueden crear una experiencia mucha más interactiva y magnifica para el espectador. Este inmersión total en la arte es exactamente lo que va a comunicar un mensaje fuerte. También, el internet es el lugar perfecto para compartir ideas de las artes y letras con otros artistas, y para disfrutar en el asombroso poder del conocimiento. Finalmente, nueves artistas pueden ser descubierto con la internet. Museos y agentes pueden buscar para artistas y arte más interesante y moderna, la democratización del mundo del arte. 
Para comunicar su mensaje a la publicidad, artistas necesitan un museo donde cualquier persona puede estudiar su arte. Con la internet, todas los artistas pueden comunicar al museo, pueden convencer al museo de adoptar su arte. Y con nuevas tecnologías, la exhibición de los artes es más barato, interesante, y interactivo para todos. Ahora, más gente va a los museos para ver al arte porque es mucho más conectado socialmente, así con sitios web como Facebook y Twitter ellos pueden compartir sus ideas del arte. Los museos reciben más beneficios, y los artistas pueden mostrar más arte al espectador. Ambas partes se benefician.
Pero, las visitantes, los patrones de arte, son el corazón del mundo del arte. Ahora, no es necesario pagar un museo para ver arte fantástico, sola necesitas un coneccion al internet.  Por esta razón, más personas se han interesado en el arte. Con la internet, la artista puede explicar directamente al espectador exactamente cuál es la significa del arte. También, los espectadores pueden conectar uno con el otro para discutir el arte. O con las guias electronicas en los museos de la misma hazaña se puede realizar. Una revolución artística está pasando, y dentro de su propia casa. 
Arte derriba barreras. Es verdaderamente la idioma universal, la humanidad de la humanidad. Así las nuevas tecnologías no solamente han cambiado el mundo del arte, pero el mundo. Con efectos sobre los artistas, los museos, y las personas de arte, las nuevas tecnologías han cambiado mucho.

Spanish seems to have fewer truly phrasal verbs (meaning a verb and a preposition etc. when used together, have a different meaning than their separate meanings) as many of ours have one word translations in Spanish. Though some people think Spanish has no phrasal verbs, this website claims to have found some: http://spanish-phrasal-verbs.blogspot.com/ 

My question is, can any of those phrasal verbs, or other phrasal verbs in Spanish be used int he same way English uses some, with the object of the sentence in between the two parts of the verb like: turn _____ on or will it always mean something different or be ungrammatical when separated. 

So... bilingual English Spanish Speakers.... What do you think? Can you think of any examples that allow for the phrasal verb to be separated and mean the same thing?

*Las autoridades *niegan* que *haya* un accidente aquí.* (The authorities deny that there's an accident here.)

*Las autoridades *negaron* que *hubiera* un accidente aquí.* (The authorities denied that there was an accident here)

In the above examples, ""haya"" was used because ""niegan"" is in the present tense, while ""huberia"" was used because ""negaron"" was in a past tense.

So my question (which my Spanish teacher was sure how to answer) is, how would this sentence be said in Spanish?

*The authorities deny that there was an accident here.*

It seems to be a choice between the two:

*Las autoridades niegan que hubiera un accidente aquí.* (defying sequence of tenses but expressing the action in the past)

*Las autoridades niegan que haya un accidente aquí.*  (not distinct from *The authorities deny there is an accident here.*)

And this question extends to other examples, like how one might say

As a native Spanish-speaker, I've noticed that tech neologisms and loanwords are everyday more common in Spanish.

Moreover, I've noticed that these words can be totally different depending on what Spanish-speaking region you are in (I would include the US here).

It would be amusing (and useful!) to see which terms and expressions we, Spanish-speakers and foreign learners, use for technology and communication in each country/region.

For instance, in **Spain** we use the following:

* Cell/mobile phone = teléfono móvil (n.)
* Smartphone = smartphone (n.)
* Computer = ordenador (n., we almost never use *computadora*)
* Tablet = tableta (v.)
* E-book reader = ebook (n., more frequent), libro electrónico (n.)
* Video game console = consola, videoconsola (n.)
* Video game = videojuego (n.)
* Video Arcade = recreativas (n.)
* Signal = cobertura (n.)
* Battery died = se ha descargado, no tiene batería
* To tweet = twittear, tuitear (v.)
* a tweet = un tuit (n.)
* Blogger = bloguero (n.)
* To chat (in an online chat room) = chatear (v., *chatear* is more common)
* To download = descargar, bajar (v.)
* To upload = subir (v.)
* To hack = hackear (v.)
* To google sth. = googlear (v., pronounced /gugle̞äɾ/)
* To print = imprimir (v.)
* To scan = escanear (v.)
* To text = mandar un mensaje, mandar un SMS
* To link = enlazar (v., formal), linkear (v., slang)
* To log in/sign in = identificarse (v., reflexive, formal), loggearse (v., slang), iniciar sesión (v., technical)
* To post = publicar (formal), postear (v., slang)
* To be down (as in ""Reddit is down"") = ""Reddit está ha caído"", ""se ha caído Reddit"" (literally, Reddit has fallen down)


**Mexico**:

* To link - Vincular
* To log in/sign in - Iniciar sesión (only a few use loggearse)
* Cell/mobile phone - Celular
* Computer - Computadora
* Arcade video games - maquinitas 
* Video game consoles - consolas",,False,,t5_2qtt1,1355661409.0,,,True,t3_14w62d,http://www.reddit.com/r/Spanish/comments/14w62d/computer_technology_vocabulary_across/,

No tengo nadie que pueda corregir mi tarea porque estoy trabajando sola. Si me pueda ayudar, me daría muchas gracias. Hace dos años que yo estudiaba en clase…. Necesito practicar. Estas cuestiones tienen que ver con la lingüística. No me interesa mucho si las respuestas son correctas (pero sí  son, yo sé), lo que me importa es la gramática. Quizás los lectores aprenderán algo interesante también. 


1.	Defina qué  es la lingüística. 

 a.	La lingüística trata de analizar el lenguaje por una manera sistemática. Contesta las preguntas como, qué es el lenguaje? Cómo  se diferencia el lenguaje humano del animal? Etc.


2.	Explique como difiere la lingüística de la gramática tradicional. 

 a.	La lingüística tiene un carácter descriptivo. Los lingüistas describen, no prescriben, el lenguaje y sus reglas.


3.	Que tiene mas importancia para un lingüista: el lenguaje oral o el escrito? Explique.

 a.	Los lingüistas valúa mas lo escrito, porque los lingüistas quieren describir el lenguaje humano como parece y cómo  está usado. La gramática del lenguaje escrito, por lo general, no cambia. Los lingüistas son interesados con los cambios que ocurren en el lenguaje hablado.


4.	Que campos abarca la lingüística?

 a.	El campo de la lingüística incluye la fonología, la sintaxis, y la semántica. 


5.	Que estudian la fonología, la sintaxis, y la semántica?

 a.	La fonología estudia cómo funcionan juntos los sonidos.

 b.	La sintaxis estudia las palabras formulan las oraciones.

 c.	La semántica analiza el significado del léxico.

6.	Aclare la diferencia entre lingüística sincrónica y diacrónica.

 a.	La lingüística sincrónica estudia el lenguaje sin pensar en la historia total, sino solamente en un momento específico.

 b.	La lingüística diacrónica es el estudio del lenguaje tras la historia y que cambios ocurren.

I grew up in mexico and learned English and Spanish simultaneously from age 2 - 10. Unfortunately, since then I've not spoken it frequently. I can still understand spoken language perfectly without translating in my head (it's weird how the meaning just sort of happens.) And I can read, albeit more slowly than in English.

The problem comes when I try to speak -- my vocabulary is rusty. I sound like a 5 year old with the limited vocabulary I have. I have an instinctual understanding of conversational grammar, but I have a hard time finding the words. 

So, I'm looking for some media in Spanish (at any level of complexity) in the form of documentaries. I tend to watch a lot of them in English, so I thought I'd try them in Spanish. I figure hearing more of the vocabulary will jump start my cob web filled brain, while I enjoy some sweet facts.

Any recommendations?

The program is open to folks with any level of Spanish, but to take classes taught in Spanish (like math or business), you must test into “300 level” courses. 

Here’s my problem: I learned Spanish while traveling a few years ago, and have kept up/improved quite a bit. I wouldn’t say I’m fluent by any means, but I can very easily have a conversation well beyond the superficial level. I can also watch movies without subtitles, and read [a](http://eltamiz.com/) / [couple](http://hazmeelchingadofavor.com/) / [blogs](http://cuentosdeterrorcortos.blogspot.com/) (incase anyone wants recommendations) in Spanish, as well as a few Spanish-language newspapers (Via Kiosko.net). However, I really have no idea how good/bad my written and spoken grammar is. But I understand pretty much anything I watch or read, and have received quite a few compliments from native speakers. All this is to say I’m fairly certain that, although it would be challenging at first, I could survive in courses taught in Spanish.

So, is there anyone out there who can give me an idea of what grammar is covered in second year? I really have no clue what is expected of students who have completed these courses, or if I’m anywhere near it...

I know this is really a question for the University, but the professor I need to talk to is out of the office until the 21^st, and I’m hoping to get as far as I can in the meantime.

Anything ya’ll could do to help would be great.

Bueno, aquí voy a intentar de traducir. Quizás alguien me pueda corregir. Por lo menos sirve para mostrar mi nivel, ¿no?

Soy estudiante en los Estados Unidos, y voy a tomar un semestre en México esta primavera. El programa está abierto a personas con cualquier nivel de español. Pero, para tomar clases que son *enseñados en Español*, tiene que estar por lo menos en el nivel “300”. (Para los que no conocen nuestro sistema de niveles, es más o menos el tercer año de estudios). Siento que debo tomar las clases en español para aprovecharlas lo más que puedo, y sería genial también porque conocería más nativos...

Mi problema es así: Yo aprendí el Español cuando viajé hace unos años. No deje de estudiar la idioma, y sí aun estoy mejorando. No diría que hablo perfectamente, pero puedo conversar fácilmente en temas complejas (aunque mis palabras probablemente parecen raras!). Entiendo películas sin subtítulos, sigo algunos blogs, y leo algunos periódicos en Español. Pues, nunca he estudiado formalmente, aparte de un mes de clases en Guatemala. Entonces, no sé que tal con mi gramática, o si mi escritura es bien feo y raro, o si ando bien... (“*Eso es decir que*”?) estoy más o menos seguro que, aunque será difícil, podría tomar las clases en Español. Especialmente si estudio mucho hasta enero.

Tambien, admito que puede ser un caso del efecto [Dunning-Kruger](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dunning–Kruger_effect)...

Entonces, hay alguien que ha tomado clases de ESP200/211/cualquiera que me podría decir lo que enseñan en esas clases? La realidad es que no tengo ni idea lo que esperan de “nivel 300” y si estoy cerca.

Bueno, ya sé que esa una pregunta pa la uní, pero el profesor que necesito está de vacaciones y no estará en su oficina hasta el 21. Y, si tengo tanto para aprender y voy a dar esfuerzo, debo empezar hoy mismo…

I guess the two versions aren’t literal translations, I rambled a bit in the spanish one and couldn’t figure out how to directly translate some things…

Oye mi amor, dime por qué tu te vas

Dime mi amor, por qué ya no estás aquí

Oye mi amor, dime adonde te fuiste

Dime por favor, porqué estoy tan triste *(sounds a little cheesy to me, maybe its the rhyme? Any synonyms for triste, maybe that rhyme with aquí?)*




Cada mañana que yo despierto

y veo que no estás a mi lado

Tan pena siento en mi corazón

No sé por qué te has ido



Ningun camino ni tren ni avión *tal vez distancia en lugar de camino?*

puede separarnos

Por qué el amor que tengo por ti 

Nunca va a dejar *tal vez salir en lugar de dejar*

Y sabes que no otro puede amarte como yo
y vas a volver, verás

*tal vez repitiré el verso ""ningun camino...""*



Oye mi amor

dime mi amor

oye mi amor

dime por favor

1A. I have noticed that some Spanish speakers pronounce the ""c"" in certain words as a th (for example, they would say ""hacienda"" as ""hath-ee-enda"" as opposed to ""ha-see-enda""). Is this a regional dialect thing or is one more proper than the other?

1B. similarly, I know that v's can be pronounced as b's (vamos as ""bomb-a-nose"" rather than ""vom-a-nose""), but I have heard vamanos pronounced both ways. Is it incorrect to pronounce v's as v and not b? like if you go to certain areas would they be confused? I would think probably not since 90% of the word is said the same. But would I be corrected?

I find these two a bit tricky in listening to speakers from different sources. Personally the c as th throws me alot worse because it makes the word sound noticably different.

2A. verb question

I can't remember what site I found this on anymore, but it had a verb conjugation table of the most common verbs, and I noticed that for both ir and ser, the past tense (was/went) is exactly the same, ie ""I was"" and ""I went"" would both be ""fui"". Is the chart wrong, or is this actually accurate? that two different verbs, meaning two different things, conjugate to the same spellings in the past tense? I get that you have to pay attention to context to know which is meant, but that just seems unnecessarily confusing.

ir by itself is a strange/confusing verb, in my humble opinion.

Te robaste mi corazón
Cuando me dejaste solo en aquella estación
Princesa y a mi me dolió un montón
Ver que te alejabas sin resignación

Tanto tiempo en ti había soñado
A la salida del baile por ti había esperado
Esa noche era el momento indicado
Para decirte cuanto te había amado
Pero vos no querías escuchar
Solo querías divertirte y bailar
Querías presumir querías alardear
Pero no me querías amar

La vida esta hecha de momentos
Momentos malos momentos buenos
Pero no perdimos el tiempo
Por que cuando nos amamos fue un amor eterno
Ahora me queda el recuerdo
Y una frase escrita en el cuaderno
Un amor verdadero y sincero
No termina mas nunca es pasajero

Basically a friend of mine from Japan is looking for an online practice partner for Spanish. I googled around for tutors and there are a ton of results, which only makes it harder since I can't differentiate the genuine programs from the schemes. Would that websites alone were a fair representation of quality, but sometimes it's quite the opposite.

Anyway, my friend's Spanish is at C1 or C2 level. She studied in Spain for around a year, so she's not looking for a teacher so much as someone who she can just talk to and maintain the language before she starts to forget it. Unsurprisingly, high proficiency Spanish speakers are hard to come by in Japan.

So, anyone know of a good, reliable online tutor program? I know of programs like LiveMocha, but while it's easy to find someone willing to speak Spanish with you in exchange for you speaking English, it's harder for a Japanese speaker.

As I'm getting better at Spanish, I've tried to improve my reading speed.

However, I wasn't sure if it was better to translate the reading to English in my head as I'm going or to simply try to keep the words in Spanish and think of them that way?

Which way is more effective or simply better in the long run?

I'm sure it is best to read the Spanish words and keep thinking about them in Spanish and understand them inherently rather than flipping back and forth between languages, but I was curious of the subreddit's opinions.

The AP Exam is this Tuesday and I was wondering if any past students have some last minute tips for me?

My biggest weakness through doing practice throughout the year is probably the reading comprehension. Some can be very difficult for me.

Writing is my biggest strength and generally I'm good at the listening sections.

Did any particular studying methods work well for you all? Did anything on the test really throw you for a loop?

1.When we watch reality TV, we are a spectator. We create an idealised image of ourself in order to escape our own lives.  

We don't know the barriers between the public and the private sphere due to our spectator culture, so we create an illusory reality in our minds.  

Reality is distorted by the fictional imaginary life we create when we watch others on reality TV, also enhanced by consumer culture.  

Therefore, we enjoy and relish our omniscience as we watch ourselves become a god-like figure.  

It is necessary that we tell the difference between real life and fiction otherwise we run the risk of becoming disillusioned when we realise we have our own lives and reality.

2.) I was hoping that someone could give me a rundown of when to use preterite or imperfect, aside from the general uses I already know (listed below). Basically, outside of these uses for each, are there any others that a student in intermediate Spanish should be aware of? 

Preterite
1.	Moves the action along. 
2.	Relates to the plot; tells what happened. 
3.	Describes completed past actions


Imperfect

1.	Sets the scene
a.	Establishes the time of the action
b.	Describes the weather 
c.	Describes the age of the participants

2.	Describes the background
a.	Describes appearances of people, places, and things
b.	Describes a state of mind
c.	Describes emotions

3.	Describes completed or continuing actions in the past
a.	Describes what was going on 
b.	Describes what used to happen

4.	Describes something that you were planning to do
a.	Ir (in the imperfect) a + infinitive

Para bien destruirme, se destruye;

sus leyes naturales en mí vence.

I say is as follow:  
""When itches, itches, itches, when scratches, scratches, scratches. It's lice!""  
because:  

* I omit the first two 'it' because the jingle doesn't says what it itches, it just says that itches in general.
* ""it's louse"" refers to a single louce, not the plural as the original jingle.
*  ""they're lice"" is a statement of what they are, but in the original jingle ""¡son piojos!"" is more an exclamation of the situation than the fact of what they are.
* ""it's lice"" does sounds weird but i find it to be the more suitable.

(1200 palabras),2,0,1,http://www.reddit.com/r/Spanish/comments/1a5f4g/escribí_una_historia_qué_opinaís_1200_palabras/,"Maialen había cumplido dieciocho años el mes que tuvo que irse de su casa familiar, y el pueblo donde había vivido siempre. El día llegado, copos de nieve acompañaban las lagrimas de su madre que miraba a su única hija irse para la primera vez. No podía ocultar la tristeza que yacía en sus ojos. Aunque sus ojos quedaron clavadas al paisaje durante todo el viaje, Maialen solo veía la cara de su madre, sucia y preocupada. No pudo olvidar que estaba dejando a su madre sola, con sus recuerdos y lamentas. Era la primera vez que su madre iba a quedar sola  Sabia que su madre se echaba la culpa a sí misma para haber dejado a su hermano Otaño irse con los etarras. No habían recibido noticias de su paradero desde meses. Sabían que Otaño lo tenia muy claro: quería defender a su pueblo, pero eso no aliviaba el terror que permanecían en los corazones de su madre y su hermanita. Las dos estaban muy alarmada pero reconocían que Maialen no tenia mas remedio que irse porque su madre necesitaba la ayuda financiera que obtendría de su nuevo trabajo.  Llevó una hora y media en el autobús para llegar a la ciudad desde su pueblo nativo. Esta flor rural temblaba mientras subían los inmuebles de la ciudad encima de su cabeza. Sabia que el momento de despedirse de su pasado había llegado. Un mes antes había recibido una carta de la familia Echabarria Ricalde diciéndole que aceptaban su oferta de trabajar como niñera para sus dos hijos, Iker e Ignacio, de siete y dos años. 

“- Necesitaremos tu ayuda después de las fiestas de Navidades. Ven lo cuanto antes. Hasta pronto, Filipa y Álvaro Echabarria Ricalde.”

Ahora bajaba del autobús y miraba alrededor para ver si conocía algún rostro dentro de la multitud de personas que parecía extenderse indefinidamente por la niebla que había bajado sobre la ciudad. Ninguno de las caras esperando ahí le inspiraban una sensación de seguridad. De repente, vio una mano agitarse. 
		
“- ¡Chica! ¡Eh! ¡Por ahí! ¡Ven por ahí, niña!”

Avanzó a ciegas, sin saber por dónde mirar. Una señora colosal la cogió en brazos como si fuera un bebe, y al cerrarla la levantó del suelo. 

“- ¿Qué tal mi niña? ¿Cómo fue el viaje?
- Pues bien...
- Ven, vamos a casa, ya te contaré lo de los chavales.”

Los Echabarria Ricalde vivían en el centro de la ciudad, encima de un cerrajero. Las obligaciones de Maialen se resumían a cuidar del “pequeñín Nacho” como le llamaba su madre, llevar a Iker al cole por la mañana y a la tarde después de la comida. Tras unos fracasos miserables intentando hacer la comida para los niños, Maialen tenia que admitir que incluso tortillas con patatas eran un misterio para ella. Debido a esta situación, Maialen empezó a ponerse nerviosa cada vez que tenia que cocinar algo. Filipa reconoció que no podían seguir así. Dijo a la niña que veía que era una maestra cocinera, y que no podía dejarla cocinar para sus hijos. Era demasiado buena. Su ingenuidad sacando lo mejor de ella, Maialen se puso de acuerdo y no volvió a cocinar. 

Maialen iba cogiendo un ritmo de vida no muy diferente a la de una hormiga. Levantaba a los peques, dejaba a Iker en el cole, y le recogía horas después. Nunca iba mas lejos que el cole, a diez minutos del apartamento donde vivían. Pasaba mucho de su tiempo andando en estas calles, y termino por conocer estas calles como la palma de su mano. Veía siempre los mismos tipos cruzarla en la calle, y al rato, empezó a perder atención en su entorno. 

En el aniversario de sus tres meses trabajando para ellos, volviendo del cole por la mañana, vio una espalda muy familiar cruzar la carretera y doblar la esquina de la manzana de en frente. Siguió caminando, pensando en lo que le recordaba esta espalda. ¿De quien era? No pudo llegar a una conclusión y dejo esta consideración atrás. Llegada en el portal del piso se detuvo en seco. La persona era Otaño. Estaba seguro de ello. Empezó a correr en la dirección de la calle donde le había visto, pero pronto supo que era demasiado tarde. Hubiera podido ir en cualquier rumbo. Era inútil intentar volver sobre sus pasos. Volvió al piso sollozando silenciosamente. Al entrar a la cocina, Filipa la interrogó Filipa la preguntó si alguna vez había ido en las montañas a ver las hadas que residían en sus rincones y grietas. 

“- Estas historias son tonterías, y usted lo sabe, señora. 
- Mi niña, no te estoy contanto bobadas. Hay unas hadas que viven ahí en las montañas, que protegen a la naturaleza vasca. ¿Tu sabes lo frágil que es nuestro país, no?
 - Pues claro, pero yo no creo en la magia. Lo que sostiene el espíritu de nuestro pueblo es la esperanza, el coraje y la perseverancia. 
- Aún así, te recomiendo que vayas a caminar en el bosque, que es tan bonito. Te has quedado tanto en la ciudad que casi te has convertido en una estatua. Venga, este fin de semana te llevo allí al parque de Gorbeia para que veas tu mismo que la magia todavía existe.”

Filipa dejó a Maialen en un rincón de la selva bien marcada, con un camino claro y fácil de seguir. Diciéndole que le recogería tres horas mas tarde en Areatza, se fue. Maialen se detuvo un momento, respirando el aire limpio y claro de las montañas. Aunque era mas sola que nunca, se sentía en seguridad. Empezó a andar. Al rato, para entretenerse, empezó vocalizar sus pensamientos. 

“- Qué tonta es esa tía. ¡Se cree que existen adas! ¡Dios mio, sé que Euskadi es anciano y algo sagrado pero no significa que realiza los sueños de cualquiera!”

Había andado durante dos horas cuando decidió detenerse, pero quería alejarse del camino. Se retiro dentro de la selva, y encontró una ronda de piedras. 

“- ¡Qué raro! ¡Igual pertenecía a los druidas que vivían aquí mismo hace siglos!”

Esa idea la convenzo que quedarse era la mejor idea. Se sentó en una de estas piedras y dejo sus sueños llevarla a un mundo diferente de lo suyo. Soñaba en magos, batallas sangrantes y heridos de guerra que yacían en la hierba, cubiertos de sangre. 

“-¡Socorro! ¡Que venga a ayudarme! ¡Me muero!”

Esta voz la hizo ponerse de pie. ¿De donde había venido? Soltó una carcajada ruidosamente cuando se dio cuenta que lo había imaginado. 

“-¡Ayuda! ¡Estoy herido!”

Aún lo oía. Caminó lentamente hacia la voz. Encontró el origen de los gritos pisando a su mano, ya que era cubierto de tierra y no lo veía, a parte de sus ojos. 

“-Chica, ayudame, tienes que... ¿Maialen? ¿Eres tu de verdad? No lo creo, no puede ser. 

Se desmayo inmediatamente, justo cuando Maialen se dió cuenta de quien era. Tuvo que sentarse a su lado cuando las palabras cruzaron su mente: 

“- ¡Es Otaño! ¡Mi hermano, por fin, lo he encontrado!”

Se quedó un rato llorando, intentando despertarle. Cuando llegó a conciencia, lloraron juntos. Ella sabía que tenía que acompañarle a casa. La familia necesitaba estar juntos para la primera vez en lo que parecía, para ellos, una eternidad.

In Spanish, I want to say 'Fabio Restrepo was murdered' so would I say 'Fabio Restrepo estaba matado'? Because that doesn't seem right to me.

I just need help translating this script into English with an emphasis on the imperative tense, if you could help me out it would be greatly appreciated!

A,B &amp; C: Welcome to the rag-tag bootleg cooking show where we show you how to make the best tasting snack food around!

A: That's right!

B: Today we'll be making our very own homemade beef burrito with a simple and delicious rocket salad!

C: For the burrito, you'll need one tortilla, one avocado, a can of refried beans, a slab of steak (cheaper cuts work well here), a tomato, an onion, some habañero peppers, some cheese.

A: Great, now we'll start by searing the steak on high heat, make sure your pan is pre-heated so the steak's done bloody. Add a general dose of black pepper and salt to taste - cut the steak into thin strips.

B: Cut the avocado in half, remove the seed/core and dice it, feel free to mix it with a little cream cheese depending on preference. While you're at it, pop the can of refried beans and heat it up!

C: Grab your tomato and dice it, be careful not make it too smushy so add a little salt as you cut. Repeat with the onion and the habañero pepper, once done, get your tortilla ready by heating it over an open flame.

A: Now that your tortilla is ready and so are all the other ingredients, all you have to do is put the thing together! Lay down a good layer of refried beans, add the avocado, put on the steak, add the onions, tomatoes and peppers and the finally, add the cheese sauce (american jack)! Wrap it up and there you have it!

B: Now for the salad! Simple and refreshing, all you'll need for this is some of that left over tomato and onion with some lettuce/cabbage and arugula (rocket). You'll need some red wine vinegar, extra virgin olive oil, spanish basil and some pepper and salt to taste.

C: The vinaigrette is easy, to every 2 parts olive oil, add 1 part red wine vinegar - add salt and pepper at the end to tighten the joint up.

A: Toss the salads together and then simply drizzle and enjoy!

A, B &amp; C: Thanks for watching and enjoy your meal!",,False,,t5_2qtt1,False,,,True,t3_17svkj,http://www.reddit.com/r/Spanish/comments/17svkj/can_anyone_translate_this_for_me_por_favor/,

I was hoping someone a little more fluent could look over the format below and point out that is incorrect or otherwise.  Please keep in mind that it is an intro class so the sentences are very simplistic in nature  and I am not trying to make them any more difficult.  

I will both ask and respond to the following questions in a formal register.


**Pregunta:** ¿Cómo está usted?

**Respuesta:** Bien, Bastante Bien, etc



**Pregunta:** ¿De què nacionalidad es usted?

**Respuesta:** Soy español, estadounidense, etc



**Pregunta:** ¿Que le gusta hacer?

**Respuesta:** A mi me gusta bailar y cantar y cocinar pero no me gusta navegar por Internet o pintar.



**Pregunta:** ¿Cómo es usted?

**Respuesta:** Soy bajo y guapo también soy activo y serio. 



**Pregunta:** ¿Cuántos años tiene?

**Respuesta:** Tengo 30 años. 



**Pregunta:** ¿Cuando es su cumpleaños?

**Respuesta:** Mi cumpleaños es el 9 de agosto.



I think most of this is spot on the only thing I am unsure of is:

I recently had to read ""Hernán Cortés"" by Carlos Fuentes. I did all the questions pretty easily... except one. The question is ""Por que dice Fuentes que Cortes fue ""derrotado por la corona española?"" Here is the excerpt of the part this question is addressing:

Hay un tema final que quisiera tocar. Hernán Cortés era un ""hombre nuevo"", un producto de la naciente civilización urbana post-feudal de España. Ignoro si era portador de ese impulso democratizador que fue brutalmente arrestado en Villalar en 1521. No deja de ser llamativo que ese mismo año, 1521. Cortés conquista la capital del imperio azteca y Carlos V derrota a las comunidades de Castilla. ¿Perdieron las burguesías post-medievales españolas en Villalar y ganaron en México? Si así fue, si el hijo de molinero de Medellín y pasajero alumno de Salamanca, venció con su genio político y militar al imperio del Gran Tlatoani Moctezuma, no cabe duda de que, también. Cortés fue derrotado por la corona española. Cualquier veleidad democrática o independentista en estos hombres de Andalucía y Extremadura que le dieron al Habsburgo el dominio del mundo sin necesidad de que se desplazara de Flandes y de Castilla fue rápidamente aplastada por el poder real. Cortés mismo no puede consolidar poder alguno en México. Los emisarios del Rey lo acusan, lo humillan, lo desplazan y lo condenan a un melancólico ocaso.

I read this section over and over and translated it continuously, trying to figure out the answer... But I can't, and I must be missing something. Maybe this is a problem of my analysis rather than my Spanish, because I can't seem to figure out why Fuentes would say he was destroyed by the crown because he was a miller's son who came to America and conquered the Aztec Empire.

Any redditors that are proficient in spanish grammar that could help me edit this would be awesome. Here it is:
Cuando llegó la mañana no hubo nada ni nadie en la calle. Hacia cinco días que Ramón no había visto alguna de las criaturas pero siempre sentía como si estuviera siendo observado. Se había sido tapiada en la casa por unas semanas y ahora la comida se estaba agotando. Odiaba siempre el tener que ir a buscar más suministros por qué siempre hay la posibilidad que nunca se regresara. Al salir a la calle, siempre él llevaba consigo dos pistolas, la escopeta que se le dio su abuelo años atrás, munición extra, un hacha y un machete en caso de que uno de ellos se presentó. Lo ha visto muchas veces alguna otra persona desesperada dejar su protección en búsqueda de lo que necesitaba solo ser capturado por esos demonios. Por lo general, suelen salir de noche, pero son inteligentes y ponen trampas para atrapar sus presas durante el día para mantenerlos hasta que puedan venir a recoger su premio. Ramón ha intentado salvar a los que se han sido atrapados y logró ayudar a uno escapar la trampa pero casi costó su propia vida. Justo después de soltar a la chica, ella se volvió loca y empezó a correr sin pensar. Él corrió detrás ella pero se entró en un edificio donde él sabía que las criaturas estaban esperando. Ramón entró el edificio y empezó a buscar la chica. Él vio que era una tienda grande con joyas y maquillaje y todo tipo de ropa. La luz del día penetró por las ventanas grandes del frente de la tienda pero se acabó no más que algunos metros adelante y después había una oscuridad total. Caminó un poco mas adelante, hasta que llegó a uno de las grandes exhibiciones de la joyería y allí se agachó y escuchó atentamente para ver si podía oír a la chica o a cualquier cosa que estaba cerca. No había nada, excepto un leve golpe débil que parecía estar en algún lugar a su izquierda. Con la escopeta en mano se dirigió hacia el sonido lentamente con mucha precaución. El sonido se hizo más fuerte a medida que se acercaba a la fuente. Cuando llegó al sonido se encontró una pequeña cadena que colgaba de la puerta de seguridad, que se cerró la mitad, y parecía estar meciéndose por el viento o algo que pasó por ella con rapidez. No había viento que Ramón podía sentir y de repente empezaba a sentir como si estaba siendo observado. Se volvió rápidamente y empezó a correr hacia la puerta por la cual entró. Alcanzó unos pasos cuando algo le agarró y le lanzó contra un caso de joyería. Sintió un liquido caliente empiezan a correr por su brazo y sintió una gran herida en la parte posterior del hombro. Escuchó un ruido fuerte de la parte más trasera de la tienda, como si fuera un grito de un animal. Él se levantó y empezó a correr hacia la salida de vuelta cuando le agarró de nuevo por el brazo. Giró su machete hacia la mano o pata que le mantenía y lo cortó saltándose de su agarre. Escuchó un grito tremendo de la criatura que le había agarrado y más gritos fuertes que se estaban acercando del fondo de la tienda. Él agarró a su escopeta y salió a toda prisa la puerta de nuevo en la seguridad de la luz del sol. Oyó un grito final más fuerte y más furioso que sonó desde el interior de la tienda y luego silencio. Desde entonces se volvió mucho más cauteloso y cuidadoso. A menudo pensaba en la chica y lo difícil era para olvidarse de ella. Eso fue hace unas semanas pero todavía se sentía como fuera ayer. Sin embargo, tenía que ir en busca de alimento. Salió a la calle y empezó a caminar hacia el supermercado abandonado donde solía recoger la comida. Durante todo el tiempo sintiendo como si alguien le observaba caminaba un par de cuadras. Se detuvo cuando le pareció oír un grito familiar como el de la tienda de antes. Al superar el miedo comenzó a caminar de nuevo cuando de repente sintió que algo envoltura alrededor del tobillo y apoderarse de los pies por debajo de él mientras golpeando la cabeza contra la acera. Cuando se despertó, Ramón estaba boca abajo flotando en el aire.

&gt;cubre las sementeras,

&gt;y las arañas tienden

&gt;el paisaje contempla.

The Meetings of a Snail Adventurer

&gt;There is infant sweetness

&gt;in the quiet morning.

&gt;The trees extend

&gt;their arms to the earth.

&gt;A trembling mist

&gt;covers the sown lands,

&gt;and the spiders tend

&gt;their silk roads

&gt;—scratches on crystal

&gt;of Nature

&gt;gave him courage and faith,

&gt;and forgetting the pains

&gt;of his home wanted

Una manzana perfecta

Manzanas – con mucha cultivación y cuidado, fertilización y poda delicada – pueden ser producidas en manojos deliciosos y abundantes, cada manzana muy diferente, deseable y nutritiva. Sin el cuidado adecuado, sus esfuerzos rendirán nada para usted, nada más que un huerto, vacío, de fracasos.

Si usted, como algunas, tenga éxito, una oportunidad se presentará para compartir los frutos de la mano de obra, la oportunidad para nutrir la comunidad que le ha nutrido a usted – difundir sus éxitos, dispersar la jugosa, crujiente dulzura de un premio hermoso – un regalo que perdura. Las manzanas, tan simple como parecen, no pueden ser cultivadas sólo.

Ella se convirtió en la primera bailarina en Nueva York en 1943 (mil novecientos cuarenta y tres). Este fue un gran honor. Ella comenzó el Ballet Nacional de Cuba con el dinero de Fidel Castro.

**En el trabajo:**

    * Bájate del autobús o del metro una parada antes y camina hasta la oficina
    * En vez de tomarte un café durante el descanso, date un paseo de 10 minutos. También le puedes preguntar a un compañero tuyo si quiere ir contigo.
    * Apúntate a un gimnasio que esté cerca de tu oficina.
    * Apúntate al equipo de fútbol de tu trabajo.

I have assessed your son’s reading skills last week. Your son absolutely needs to spend as much time as possible reading. He is very far behind for his age group. In order for him to begin receiving better results in his classes, he must first and foremost, above all, learn to read fluently. The only way to achieve this goal is to make sure he reads every single day, even during the weekend. 

I will assign Jose a reading for every day. I require that he reads 20 minutes a day, every day. After he reads, he must write 5 sentences explaining what he has read about. This work must be overseen by an adult and then signed by the parent.

I am studying for an exam on Wednesday and I am getting tripped up on days and times.  Below are some example questions along with my questions.

Question: Say that you are taking an exam at 1330 in the computer center.

Answer: El martes a la una y media de la tarde tomo el examen de informática en el centro de computación.

My question: I understand this to translate to On Tuesday at 130 in the afternoon I am taking the computer science exam in the computer center. But if I wanted to say that I go to class in the computer center on Tuesdays would it be: Los martes a la una y media de la tarde voy al clase en el centro de computación?

Question: Está en la clase de química.

Answer: Son las tres menos cuarto de la tarde. 

My question: I more or less get this.  Basically I have come up with that if I am just being asked the time something is going on I respond with 'Son las' or 'Es la' but if I want to say I do something on a certain day at a certain time I use 'a las' or 'a la'

I was impressed that the program had abundant clinical training in both obstetrics and gynecology. But most of all that the people I met were very kind.
I would like to also emphasize that I am an excellent student and hard worker, but also an easygoing person who gets along with patients, cowkerers, staff, and faculty. I also have a strong desire to work with the spanish speaking population.

Es una historia  de amor moderna basada en hechos y experiencias reales las cuales traerán risa y llanto al lector; unas partes  le llenaran el cuerpo de escalofrío; otras le alarmaran y le harán temblar; pero al final  de la historia, el lector encontrara gozo, paz  y felicidad y un sentido de alivio y regocijo de haber vivido por medio de esta lectura,  la experiencia de varios seres humanos,  luchando  por encontrar;  eso; que todos como humanos, buscamos con desesperación… la  felicidad.

 La obra esta basada en hechos de la vida real, los nombres de los personajes son ficticios  y muchos de los acontecimientos son fantasía acompañados por bastante imaginación.

Dicha historia empieza en una aldea  cerca de Madrid España.  Sunita Franco viene de una familia ejemplar y lleva una vida pacifica y feliz.  

Acaba de terminar sus estudios de Universidad y se esta preparando para empezar a trabajar.

Su padre la sorprende con un trabajo muy especial que él le ha encontrado en California por medio de uno de sus colegas. Viajar a Los Estados Unidos ha sido el sueño de su vida. La compañía le ha dado  unos meses para prepararse y mejorar su lenguaje del Ingles; así que vuelve a la Universidad de Madrid para estudiarlo.  Allí Sunita, sin querer, encuentra a su Príncipe Azul llamado Ronnie Waddell.  Arquitecto de profesión;  nacido en Chicago. Ronnie esta haciendo una maestría temporal en Madrid. 

Ellos se enamoran locamente pero al final Sunita sabe que no puede cambiar el rumbo de su destino y se ve obligada a cumplir con su promesa de trabajo en California, así que con mucho dolor se  separa de Ronnie y viaja a Los Ángeles para empezar una nueva vida con su nueva profesión.

Años mas tarde y por increíble casualidad y circunstancias el destino los une otra vez.  El amor y la pasión siguen tan viva y caliente como muchos años atrás. Juntos luchan con todas sus fuerzas para no separarse nunca más pero  el destino los separa otra vez. Ella en desesperación y sin saber que ha pasado con Ronnie, encuentra consuelo escribiendo su vida con él. Sunita escribe su historia, recordatorios, pasiones, gozos, tristezas y desesperación en un libro, el cual por medio de la ayuda de un vecino la hacen rica y famosa.  

Mientras... Ronnie ha vivido una vida de silencio y olvido en Chicago, tratando de superar su estado.  Un día llevado por curiosidad  encuentra información de Sunita. Ronie devora la lectura. Cada palabra que lee es como una flecha clavándose en  su corazón y como un rayo de luz aclarando su mente. Con cada palabra que lee,  su memoria se abre y le entierra en el dolor.

Ronnie la busca con desesperación, pero cuando finalmente la encuentra las circunstancias de Sunita son muy diferentes…..este encuentro fue brutal e inesperado, muy difícil para  sus  frágiles emociones ya destrozadas por el tiempo y las cuales no sabia como manejar.
Ayudada por amigas, familia y bastante asistencia profesional Sunita recibe la fuerza necesaria para olvidar, superar y confrontar la situación.

Cuando se siente lista para recuperar su pasado y empezar su nuevo futuro, Sunita se prepara para ese re-encuentro, especialmente porque esta vez le tiene que presentar una sorpresa increíble.

Este re-encuentro con Ronnie fue sensacional. La manera en que Sunita le comunico y presento la sorpresa fue increíble y conmovedora. La energía que este capitulo trae es poderosa recargando el corazón.  Esta es la conquista del amor sobre toda la fatalidad. El lector no podrá más que sentir  la emoción y alegría que este capitulo trae al ser humano. 

El final tiene algunas reacciones inesperadas.  Es fantástico, increíble, emocionante.

La lección es que la perseverancia  y la ilusión ayudan a la sobrevivencia del amor.
El lector sentirá una diferencia en su vida, pues realizará que la felicidad sí existe y  que con un poquito de ayuda ¡sí se puede encontrar!

I am a middle school French teacher who had a gap in my schedule and am now going to be teaching a ""Latin American Studies"" class. 

Do you guys know of any helpful subreddits or other resources with mostly cultural info on Latin American countries. This includes Mexico, Central and South America.

At my time of highest proficiency I would occasionally find myself thinking in spanish, and could travel in spanish speaking countries (with minimal difficulty).  I would love to get back there.

Are there any tv shows, or films I should be watching to help myself get conversational again?  I think that it probably has to be a show I would find good/entertaining for it to work as a way to refresh my spanish.

Some english language examples of my tastes are:

Law and Order (the original, not SVU and definitely not Criminal Intent)

The Shield

Breaking Bad

The Departed

Zombieland

Moon

District 9

Zoolander

Platoon

I realize my taste can tend to be on the ""heavy"" side, so it may not be the best place for me to reheat my spanish skills, so I'm open to other suggestions too...  English language stuff that I could get dubbed in spanish would also be fine with me...",,False,,t5_2qtt1,False,,,True,t3_1ju80t,http://www.reddit.com/r/Spanish/comments/1ju80t/spanish_language_tv_and_movies/,
