1347412764.0,82,self.kettlebell,zqpvb,New To Kettlebells? Start Here!,96,14,39,http://www.reddit.com/r/kettlebell/comments/zqpvb/new_to_kettlebells_start_here/,"The world of Kettlebells can seem daunting to the uninitiated. But don't worry! It turns out that much of the beauty of kettlebells lies in their simplicity. Here are a few tips to get you started.  

In 14 words, the answers to your questions are:  
1) [CFF](http://www.christiansfitnessfactory.com/index.php/Kettle-bells/View-all-products) or [First Place](http://www.performbetter.com/webapp/wcs/stores/servlet/Product2_10151_10751_1005565_-1_1000420_1000156_1000156_ProductDisplayErrorView0)  
2) 35 lbs (guy) or 20 lbs (girl)  
3) [Enter The Kettlebell](http://www.amazon.com/Kettlebell-Strength-Secret-Soviet-Supermen/dp/0938045695)  
  
But, I assume you'd like a little more explanation than that, so here goes.

**What Brand of Kettlebell Should I Buy?**  
Two great choices would be [Christian's Fitness Factory](http://www.christiansfitnessfactory.com/index.php/Kettle-bells/View-all-products) and [First Place Competition Kettlebells](http://www.performbetter.com/webapp/wcs/stores/servlet/Product2_10151_10751_1005565_-1_1000420_1000156_1000156_ProductDisplayErrorView0) sold by Perform Better.   

(The CFF kettlebells are cast-iron 'Russian-style' kettlebells; the First Place ones are steel 'Competition-style' kettlebells. Some people have a clear preference of one over the other, but both of the ones above are excellent choices for a first kettlebell you will not regret buying.)  

Of course, there are many other excellent brands out there! If you're interested, M4ntr1d has collected the community's experiences with many of them in the Great And Ongoing Kettlebell Review Thread **[here](http://www.reddit.com/r/kettlebell/comments/igosn/the_great_and_ongoing_kettlebell_review/)**. Check it out!    
  
  
**What is the best weight to start with?**  
The general recommendation is to start with **35 lbs (16 kg)** if you are a guy, and **20 lbs (8-9 kg)** if you are a girl.   

Unscientifically, I'd guess that these weights are appropriate for 90% of the population. *If you have not been seriously weight training for 6 months or more, and you are in good enough shape to walk up a few flights of stairs and/or crank out a push-up or two without getting too winded, stop reading here; the above weights are for you!* :)  
 
Even if you've been weight training seriously for a while, the weights above may be ideal for you to learn the movements on, and will likely stay useful for quite some time. However, if you have access to a gym or store with kettlebells, you may want to test a few different weights, with basic movements like the two-handed swing and the overhead press. One metric is to choose the heaviest kettlebell you can comfortably overhead press for reps.
 
In the interest of completeness, here are some links that discuss this issue: [One](http://physicalliving.com/downloads/the_definitive_guide_for_buying_kettlebells.pdf), [Two](http://www.mikemahler.com/store/kettlebell-buyer-guide.html), [Three](http://powercore-fitness.com/2011/06/read-this-before-buying-a-new-kettlebell/), [Four](http://www.bodybuilding.com/fun/henkin6gggg.htm), [Five](http://www.livestrong.com/article/231757-what-weight-kettlebell-should-i-get/), [Six](http://pfsbody.com/fitness/what-kettlebell-weight-should-i-start-with/).  
   
   
**What is the best routine for someone new to Kettlebells?**  
The most commonly recommended routine for beginners is the 'Program Minimum' from [Enter The Kettlebell](http://www.amazon.com/Kettlebell-Strength-Secret-Soviet-Supermen/dp/0938045695) by Pavel Tsatsouline: Twice a week, 12 minutes of swings, taking breaks as needed. Twice a week, 5 minutes of continuous Turkish Get-Ups, alternating hands each rep.   

The book is absolutely worth purchasing, as it goes into great detail on how to safely and correctly perform the basic kettlebell movements. A great companion to this volume is the [Enter The Kettlebell Workbook](http://www.google.com/search?&amp;q=enter+the+kettlebell+workbook) by Anthony DiLuglio. [These instructional videos](http://allaboutkettlebells.com/category/learn-the-basic-exercises/) from Delaine Ross, RKC; and [this thorough video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w2m6a-pSdxM) (broken into chapters [here](http://worldkettlebellclub.com/intro-to-kettlebells/)) by Valery Fedorenko, are also a great place to start.

There are many other great videos, books and programs out there as well -- several are listed in this thread, the [FAQ](http://r-kettlebell.wikispaces.com/Reddit+Kettlebell+FAQ) and the [FAQ thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/kettlebell/comments/pyein/the_rkettlebell_faq_suggestiondiscussion_thread/).
The [FAQ](http://r-kettlebell.wikispaces.com/Reddit+Kettlebell+FAQ) and [FAQ thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/kettlebell/comments/pyein/the_rkettlebell_faq_suggestiondiscussion_thread/), are two great places to find answers to your other questions.

1371135365.0,47,self.kettlebell,1g9r1m,"So, I manipulated my dad...",50,3,7,http://www.reddit.com/r/kettlebell/comments/1g9r1m/so_i_manipulated_my_dad/,"Before my summer vacation, my dad called me and said he'd take me to the golf course every now and then when I visited so I could learn a ""gentleman sport"", instead of ""just pumping iron"". He's always been hassling me jokingly since I started lifting that I shouldn't strive for bodybuilding (""you won't be taken seriously""), I shouldn't strive for strongman/powerlifting (""you'll get fat""), and so on... I don't mind golf, but I figured I'd return the favour, so to speak. 

My dad recently had a pretty bad lung infection that he's more or less been treated for now, but needless to say his physical condition is a little degraded. He usually goes for a run around the neighbourhood every now and then, but his training stops there; it's simply for enjoyment and ""staying in shape"". Somehow infected by my stepmother, he focuses very much on supplements to ""stay healthy""... I wanted to help.

So, since I've been flirting with kettlebells the last months, I googled around and found a dedicated kettlebell gym situated right between my dad's and my summer locations. They do intro classes for a bearable fee every other weekend, so I called them and signed myself and my dad up for the first they had this summer. They told me they had a summer offer, in which if you participated on the intro course, you could get two months' membership if you tossed in something like the cost of three beers out on the town; I told them that we would decide on that after we were done with the course, but as my dad is a salesman, I knew he would not, could not turn down such a good offer if it was in his interest.

So I called him and broke the news to him, and he instantly sounded somewhat nervous; he questioned my judgement for signing him up for ""something crazy like that"", but grudgingly agreed to show up. On the day itself, he picked me up already dressed up for training, visibly nervous. He kept asking me if he could stop if he felt tired, if he would be the only man there approaching 50, and so on; I just smiled and told him to relax, ""It's just an intro course.""

And it was; both the instructor and a couple of guys in the class were about my dad's age. We did a thorough joint warmup, went through all the basic movements, mixed some up, did some juggling, practiced getups. We were constantly moving, but technique was in focus and we didn't get very tired until the very end, when we did a short workout. All in all it lasted about two hours.

I had to piss right after the show ended, but when I came back to the reception I was pleased to find my dad already in discussion with the instructor/owner. The instant the instructor mentioned the summer offer, my dad perked up and asked me if we should go for it; ""Hey, up to you, dad."" He signed us both up. 

We've only been to one class after that, whereafter we were both positively dripping sweat, but after catching his breath my dad went right up to the instructor and asked when the next class for our level was. I can tell he's excited; probably because it is a chance to see each other regularly (if only to exchange thumb-ups between sets), but also because he genuinely finds kettlebell training fun. I'll restrain him if needs be...

My stepmother has already stated her scepticism more than once (""Don't tell me you're going to start pumping as well?""), but she's a lady who thinks of golf as a good workout and who attempted to push me over to Herbalife (""That intermittinent fasting is going to give you diabetes!""), so yeah, whatever.

The next level of this, when summer approaches its end? I'm gonna buy him a 16kg kettlebell and get him some literature. Arise, comrade dad!

tl;dr: I pulled some strings and made my dad train with kettlebells, and my stepmother is a hater.",,False,,t5_2rpqv,False,,,True,t3_1g9r1m,http://www.reddit.com/r/kettlebell/comments/1g9r1m/so_i_manipulated_my_dad/,

I pretty much just stick to the basics: swings, snatches, cleans &amp; presses and TGUs as barbell training is my main emphasis.

However, today I did the 10min snatch test for the first with a 24kg and got 136 reps without ever putting the bell down. It's not stellar as I've done 100 in 5mins before, but I paced myself with a 2 breath fixation on each rep and those second 5 mins were still mentally taxing and I'm wiped out. 

Love it. Can't wait to keep trying and get that 200 score.

I am posting this for other who may have been in my situation, meaning they are recovering from a herniated disk.  My rational for such a program is that i was unable to use barbells to squat and could not get in position to deadlift; my body was physically stopping me.  I am 5’9” 200lbs 30% bf, I gained weight from being unable to work out and getting depressed from being unable to and developed shitty eating patterns.

**Prior to this program I was unable to:**

* Squat any weight to full depth and past 80lbs without sciatica

* I was physically unable to get into deadlift position

* Also I was unable do pull ups without pain in my thoracic spine

*Note: prior to this program I did a ton Stuart McGill's big 3, the idea is the add volume not time to movements such as the bird dog, McGill sit up and side bridge 5x8 seconds all sets.  I also walked a lot, roughly 3 mi every other day.*


What was stopping me you may ask from doing a deadlift and what caused me pain while squatting, well after seeing a chiropractor who is [sfma ceritifed](http://www.sfma.com/site/).  He suggested I use kettlebells for awhile because they require your core muscles to actively resist the weight because the weight is for off unilateral and second the weight is held behind the wrist not over.  My issues seem to be stability in my core and right hip, meaning my right hip would descend ever so slightly faster than my left when I squatted.  Also because of my stability issue I was unable to reach full depth in my squat.My program was as follows foam roll (I used a PVC pipe) then I followed it by a brief mobility circuit then I would start my work out. I closed this by static stretching.

**Foam Roll:** I would first roll my quads, IT bands, back of my calf then side calf.  This was followed by rolling a tennis ball against the sole of my foot, I would then roll my glutes and lastly my hip flexors.  

**Mobility Circuit, ten reps all sides:** ankles each direction, knee wall touches to stretch my Achilles tendon and calf.  Rolling thoracic spine was next, then high knees, followed by pull back butt kicks, lunges would be done next then last I would do a combination squat to stand and squat prye, squatting down I would prye my knees open and raise my hips high to stretch my hamstrings.

**Work out:** Started at 20lbs then added 2.5lbs a work out, capping out at 50lbs
1x5 Turkish Get Ups (high bridge) – this movement of all movements was the most important; it got my muscles all fire properly.  It reinforced how to squeeze glute to bridge, the hip hinge pattern then lock out while pressing up from my lunge.
1x10 Single Snatches – These really got my heart rate up, I learned the form was a pull up, then back and punch through.  My right side was better then my left at punching through.
1x10 Presses –  By focusing on keeping my shoulder packed, I really found this movement to work my whole shoulder and arm as one.
1x10 Plank Row - Assuming push up position, I would then pull one arm to my chest like a row.  This really forced me to keep my core tight and keep a neutral spine.
1x10 swings – Helped reinforced my hip hinge movement pattern
1x10 135lb deadlift – This helped build endurance in my posterior chain, I never added weight as I needed endurance not strength

**Cool down static stretches:**  Calf stretch, pull back leg to stretch my quad, warrior lunge for my hip flexor, then I would stretch my glute by doing a figure four off of a short bench.

**Results:**

* My shoulders/lats became massive, I don’t have before or after pictures but I heard comments from my family and friends. (ie: got called hulky more)

* I can move so much better, I can squat now with a barbell to full low bar depth. (I use an 11” box to judge my depth, before I barely hit 14”)  I am also pain free while doing so.

* I can deadlift fine now, I straight leg DL as the hinge pattern is now second nature.

* Pull Ups are perfect, the swing really taught me not to over extend my spine which was causing my pain

* Best part this workout was always completed in 30 minutes, every other day.

I am now following a modified stronglifts program with a mixture of barbells and kettlebells, my warm up is the same roll then mobility then workout.  Basically I squat and DL with a bar, but I’ve kept TGU to start things off.  But how I modified it is that I now row, press and bench with my kettlebells.  I hope this helps out those who are looking to transition back into weight training, kettlebells are fun (I love the TGU!) but barbells are really my thing.

I've made really good (IMHO) progress with KBs.  I've been doing them as part of a class for roughly 3 months now.  The class is called Art of Strength, and it seems to be pretty damn good, AFAIK, based on the intensity of the workouts.

I started really light: a 12 kg swing seemed like it would kill me.  I read ETK and studied form videos to make sure I perfected everything.  I'm one of the ""heavy researcher"" types.  I dive head first into everything, but ONLY AFTER mounds of research.

As of today, I can now do virtually any KB exercise with a 24kg, and today the instructor used me to illustrate, in his words ""Perfect dead snatch form.""  I was absolutely floored.  Dead snatches petrify me due to some nerve damage suffered in my hand as a child.  This results in a less than spectacular grip.  Perhaps this fear makes me concentrate on keeping good form.

So here I was, a pretty fat, still out of shape guy, showing really ""fit"" and ""trim"" gym-goers how to do a ""perfect dead snatch"" with a 24kg KB.  I would think I blushed, but I was too hot/sweaty/flushed to really notice.

Isn't that a good thing?,18,3,34,http://www.reddit.com/r/kettlebell/comments/10p0r0/hard_style_is_less_efficient_than_soft_style_isnt/,"I've read a lot of material on the web that almost condemns the way that Pavel teaches kettlebell techniques. Steve Cotter almost sounds like he's insulting the hard style by saying it's a marketing technique only intended for entry level enthusiasts: http://personal-trainerbrighton.blogspot.com/2010/06/steve-cotter-interview.html

&gt; Hardstyle is a brand name. From a technical perspective it is a good entry level system, fine for those who are beginners or have no aspiration of achieving a high level of KB competancy. To compare hardstyle to GS is like comparing sandlot baseball to Major League baseball. They use the same tools but the level of expertise is clearly different.

What I don't understand is why so many people advocate a style of exercise that is designed to be more efficient. From a fat-loss perspective, shouldn't exercise be inefficient so that you burn more calories and work out less? From a muscle building perspective, shouldn't you being doing an exercise with explosive form that you can only complete a small number of reps? Maybe I'm missing something, but if you have no intention to compete in Girevoy Sport, why would you practice soft style over Pavel's hard style?

To compare this to running, it sounds like a comparison between sprinters and marathoners. Sprinters will not last as long, but they look great and they have a functional strength they can apply to real sports and real life events (like running away from a threat). Professional marathoners look frail and are specialized for a type of activity that human beings don't normally do (running in a straight line for 26 miles, when would we ever do that in a sport or in real life?).

In all the articles and books I have read about weight training, professional coaches never teach a ""loose"" or ""efficient"" technique, it's always about activating as many muscles as possible and producing powerful contractions. 

Maybe I'm missing something, but the instructors who advocate the soft style haven't been doing a very good job of marketing the advantages of their method over Pavel's. If the rationale is to max out reps in a 10 minute period, the mainstream consumer reply will be: ""Who cares? I want to lose chubs and get jacked... and in the least amount of time!"".

[This article](http://chroniclesofstrength.com/1/post/2010/10/some-news-and-why-are-people-hating-on-hardstyle.html) sums up my impression of the whole hard style vs GS discussion:

&gt; GS and hardstyle are completely different! GS is a sport, and hardstyle is a system! GS as a fitness program alone is not something I would ever recommend, it's actually pretty unbalanced. But as a sport, and for the athletes that compete in it, it is incredible! Hardtyle however, is a system of training, and never has been a sport. Hardstyle is about inefficiency(intentional inefficiency), where as GS is about efficiency. Hardstyle is about maximum tension/strength and power, where GS is about endurance. They are simply two completely different beasts, and the people who talk trash on the others are too ignorant to be of any sort of value being in the fitness community. I train and teach both hardstyle and GS, and I make sure that those I teach it too understand the differences and the benefits of both.

I apologize if I turned anyone off with this question, I'm sure there will be plenty of downvotes. Would love to hear what Valery Fedorenko thinks, who frequents this subreddit. Would really love to hear what people think as I have an open mind to this topic. 

**TLDR**: GS style sounds like a good idea if you want to compete, but isn't hard style a better method for general fitness conditioning since the movements are less efficient?

The trash would be filled to the top with food scraps/containers/etc. I noticed the motion i had to use to pull the bag out and swing it into the trash, would work the muscles through out my torso and midsection.

So, i went to my gym and tried to emulate this motion any way i could, the best way I found was using kettlebells.

I have been lifting weights for ten years and just now started using these bad boys, and I gotta say....there my new favorite.

And I wanna get on the right track! This is my first post and was looking for a bit of help on a routine with only what I've got.

I've trained and done a bench press competition before and I absolutely loved the way I looked then. My routine at that time was Mon, Wed, Fri - deadlift, curls, leg presses (I'm not sure if that's what their called?), situps, and benchpress. I did this for about an hour.

That was three or four years ago, and now I'm tired of being unhealthy. Now I want to get back into feeling great and living clean!

So, here's where I'm at now: I'm 5'3 and 158lbs. Back then I was 125lbs and benching 115. I looked great and want to get back to that!

But... I don't have a gym membership, but I do have a membership with a self defense class that's based off of Jeet Kune Do, and they do some BJJ. That I can go to 3 times a week (Mon, Tues, Thurs, or Sat) and do for an hour or two (depending if I'm able to stay for open mat). There's no lifting, but a lot of time we do spar (mainly ground fighting, so you're pushing at the other person's weight).

At home, I have two 5 pound dumbbells, a 25 pound kettlebell, a 35 pound kettlebell, jump rope, a pull up bar (that I'm not so great at, at the moment! Haha!), and some great running shoes.

I did the swings with a 22kg bell, as that's what I had, so to make it even more challenging, I gave myself 5,000 pushups to do as well.

I gave myself one day's headstart on August and finished today. So that's an average of 312.5 swings and 156.25 pushups a day.

Of course, some days were better than others, and I had quite a few pushups to do in the last week or so!

Here's a graph of my [progress](http://i.imgur.com/g0OSh.jpg) during the month.

Needless to say, it was pretty mentally trying. Make sure if you're going to attempt something like this you leave it to a month you aren't too busy. You are going to need plenty of good food and rest. 

The benefits were definitely worth it, my chest, triceps, and hamstrings have all exploded in size, and my endurance for these two exercises is obviously quite good now. 

Would I do it again? I'm thinking of trying it again sometime with different exercises, but I certainly wouldn't train like this all the time. Too much focus on one thing will create imbalances in the body.

This completely changed my attitude towards training, as you have to do the required number per day or else suffer for it a few days later. I am now much more positive towards kettlebells, as I only used to do a few hundred swings a week, and am now comfortable with well over a thousand per week - a very satisfying workout!

I had less than a month to do it in because of holiday commitments, so ended up taking 26 days, with an average kettlebell mass of 19.7kg (I started off using a 12 and 16kg then quickly moved onto a 20).

I just thought to get this subreddit a little more active we could have doable challenges.  Things the more advanced guys could do for fun, and things the newbies could try.

how does this sound?  

Like for November, we could do 200 swings a day! Doesnt have to be at the same time, but you could work up to it. More advanced people could try e.g. heavier kb, single handed, double kb's.

Edit: Great Ideas so far, thank you.  For beginners: single kb double handed swing. Intermediate: single kb, single hand swing.  Single kb (heaviest you got), double hand swing.  Advanced: single kb (heaviest you got), single hand swing. You could also juggle the kb.

For people on other programs that want to have fun with this.  Try 200 on your off days (*this has a chance of hindering your strength gains.  but will increase work capacity).

This is a grand total of 6000 swings in a month of 30 days.  1500 swings a week.  not to shabby.  It is something that is doable but can be a challenge to do everyday.

(All my work out are done every other day)

First back story:

I'm currently 6' 215lbs (I started my fitness craze well over 300lbs), I've been riding a bike, and doing bodyweight excercises (leg lifts/push ups/planks) and using resistance bands to perform rows and odd types of flies. 

This went on for awhile, and got me to my current weight; during winter I had to change up my routine, and went with 100 squats/100 seated rows, 40 leg lifts, five minutes of planks, and 40 push ups.

So NOW, Enter The Kettlebell, right? Yeah, I grabbed Pavel's video and skimmed (don't bash me) the booklet, since I was bumming it from a friend. I also read a lot online to try and find something to worked ""perfectly"" for me.

SO this is what I ended up with, it's apparently a HIIT workout, with 20 second sets. So originally I was going to do this day one.

2 arm swings

rest

Snatch right 

rest

Snatch left

rest

2 arm swings

Rince and repeat, for twenty minutes. I ran into two big problems:

During the first snatch (Also my first attempt at one) I bruised the hell out of my right forearm (Yes, I was supposed to do cleans first, wasn't I? figured that out.) During the second snatch, I hurt my left wrist, and sent a zinger through it; so it felt like I sprained it, but really it just stung for a few minutes.

The second issue, was there was no way in hell I was going to make it to twenty minutes of this; I honestly only got to about seven minutes, hell six.

SO I spend yesterday and most of the day today thinking about how I could improvise it to work more for me, yet again; so this is what I did today:

2 arm swing

rest

right arm swing

rest

left arm swing

rest

2 arm swing..

Rince and repeat; this time I only aimed for ten minutes, and I actually was able to do it for around eleven, the only concern I really had during this workout was my form; which I have been watching tons of videos and was trying to see what I could do; still not sure on the form. (Trying for hardstyle)

SO, I tried reading the faq here and...had a hard time finding it, then had a hard time getting anything out of it......

Last night I did 100 one handed swings with each arm in sets of 20 with a few seconds rest in between each set. First time I managed a 100, couldn't make another swing if I wanted to. My back, arms and legs felt amazing afterwards.

Today? Not a bit of soreness. I'm not complaining really, I just always learned that muscle ache is your muscles repairing them self better and stronger. My exercises never give me any pain the next day, mostly they just make me feel great, everything feels nice and tight, energetic.

Since I also lift weights, I want some great posterior chain accessory work as much as possible for squats and DLs and everyone knows the swing is one of the best posterior chain exercises there is. The fact that it gets you in great shape is a nice side effect.

**The Test**

* A kettlebell that you normally use for Manmakers (12 mins all-out swings)
* 20 two handed swings every minute at the beginning of the minute for as long as you can.
* Using two handed swings is the key, because it forces you to use as many muscles as possible. 
* Timers are extremely helpful here.

For example, today I managed 400 swings in 20 minutes with a 20kg bell (44llbs) and the limiting factor was not my conditioning, but muscle fatigue in my lower back. Although I suspect my grip had only another 10 mins in me as well. My cadence usually leaves me with ~:27-:29 rest, so the work to rest ratio is basically 1:1.

**The Goal**

You know you've successfully completed the The Kettlebell Swing Test when you can do this for 60 mins and pop out 1200 swings in that time. That's my goal.  Basically a swing marathon.  Not only will it drive conditioning, but get your posterior chain and grip to man (or woman) of steel status...

I spoke with the person responsible for group classes at my local gym, and she wants me to hold a trial group class next week. Basically it is too see if I fit the instructor role.

I have been going to their kettlebell classes now for some time, and I feel that they are mostly focused on cardio and high reps, not so much strength and technique progression involved.

We had a chat and she (the ""boss"") agreed that it would be nice to have more than one kettlebell class each week, and having different focus in the different classes.

This got me thinking, if the other instructor can hold the more cardio/endurance focused session, I will go for more of a technique/strength class. 

Apart from mixing things up and providing variety, I believe it could help encourage people doing some kettlebell routines on their own in the gym, which ""the boss"" agreed would be a good thing.

Basically, I have no idea what kind of people that will show up for the trial class, and (provided I get the job) eventually in my class. Mostly I believe it would attract new people.

Given these circumstances I am trying to set up a 45 minute session, for my trial class. It should be focusing on technique/strength, although with some cardio involved, but this is not the main focus. 

I am thinking of keeping it simple, yet fun, to encourage people to return. Thus, I am considering to include swings, cleans, squats,  presses and turkish get ups, of course depending on the level of the attendees and how well the class is progressing.

How I am thinking of doing these exercises is first to hold 15 minutes of showing the points of the swing then clean, having the attendees swinging&amp;cleaning and go around correcting technique.

After these 15 minutes, there would be 2 or 3 interval/AMRAP-style circuits with squats, swings, presses etc. mixed with various body weight exercises (pushups, lunges etc.). If I feel the group is up to it, I will include turkish get ups as well in theses circuits.

I know that I probably won't be able to perform all my planned circuits, considering it is my first class. Anyway, I have planned for the full 45 minutes if all goes very well, and I'm not being overly optimistic for the time required for each exercise.

But I've come to notice, however, that so called professionals in videos and websites all over the internet seem to fail at the basic point to the swing...the legs.  Even youtube links posted in this very subreddit offer an instructor performing the swing with absolutely no leg bend/squat.  From my training with an RKC instructor in the past, and reading all the Pavel material, I see so many people cheat themselves when performing this basic exercise.  

So, I submit to you Reddit: Which is the right way, which is the way you perform, and what are the benefits?

To me, if you do a swing and don't squat with your hamstring (top of the leg) to be between 45% and parallel with the floor, you're doing it wrong.  I see videos all the time of people who have no visible bend in their knees.  They do a ""hip-snap"" and look like their muscling the kb with their shoulders/arms and most importantly their back, and just relying on the momentum of the weight to carry them through the exercise.  

Correct me if I'm wrong...

Different styles, weight classes, coatings and covers versus none, handle sizes are all different factors to think about.  

To help alleviate some of the stress involved in finding the write bell for you, I've collected info from all across the internet and from our very own comrades in an effort to make choosing the bell for you less a chore than it need be.  Bear in mind there are about ten bazillion kettlebell brands out there, so I likely won't get to them all.

Bear in mind, this is an ongoing thread, so I'll be doing what I can to update it whenever I get info on a new brand.  Also, I am an American, so getting info and price suggestions for foreign kettlebell brands is tough for me.  If you have any info on brands from the UK, Australia, Japanese, or Iceland, please PM me with details so I can add them.

**A note on ""fad"" kettlebells**

Kb purists all agree on one very important fact: If the kettlebell you're interested in isn't round with a flat bottom and a good handle, all cast as one piece, then don't buy it.  

* Welded handles can break and create a dangerous situation.  Stay away.  
* We're also iffy on the subject of plastic sand filled kettlebells.  Better to spring for a solid iron kettlebell that will stand more abuse.

* Adjustable kettlebells are a waste and more expensive than need be.  Don't do it.

* The aforementioned also means getting handle thingy for your existing weights is silly, and (more importantly) dangerous.  If it breaks, you'll have weights flying all over creation.

* Handles are important!  Too thick and you won't have a good grip on your bell.  Too small and you'll hurt your hand and wrist.  Too rough and you'll hurt your hands and rip your calluses off.  Too smooth and you risk losing your grip on your bell.  Too little handle room and your hand (if it's bigger) will be uncomfortable.  To wide, and you might hurt your knee.

**Important!**

[This is a dumb kettlebell.  Don't buy it.](http://store.gofit.net/Contour-Kettlebell-s/44.htm)

[This is a decent bell, but too expensive.  Don't buy it.](http://store.gofit.net/product-p/gf-kbell40.htm)  Mine is five pounds heavier and was half the price from Academy Sports when I bought one a long time ago.

**The People Who Know It Best**

The absolute best place to start for everyone is at Dragon Door with Enter The Kettlebell.  Pavel has a long list of dvd's for kettlebells, stretching, and loads more.  This is the guy that brought kettlebells to the USA and made them popular for us, far before the Jillian Micheals of the world bastardized them.  Also look for Viking Warrior Conditioning from Kenneth Jay.  It'll break even the toughest of lifters down.  

Steve Cotter is also a good resource for kettlebells with his Encyclopedia of Kettlebell Lifting series, which covers nearly every lift you can do with a kettlebell.  He's also got a series for bodyweight workouts that's fantastic.  I like this more because he demonstrates every single lift he covers for you.  In his kettlebell dvd, he covers every lift from head to toe (literally), then does his workout on the last dvd, which was after a week of doing everything else.  Fantastic, yes?

I don't know much about Steve Maxwell, but he seems to be popular amongst kettlebell purists and knows his stuff well.  [Here's his youtube page, with tons of demonstrations for kettlebell workouts and a lot more.](http://www.youtube.com/user/MaxwellStrengthCond)

**The Great Review**

[**Dragon Door**](http://www.dragondoor.com/p10b/) are the gold standard in kettlebells, workout vids from Pavel Tsatsouline (and many others), and generally all things Kettlebell related.  

* They offer several weight classes, from small to friggin' huge.  All are measured in kilograms.  
* Handles are a decent size for everyone, and the bell is a good, round size and shape for sitting on your arm at the ""rest"" position.  Bottoms are flat and smooth with  no rubber pads.
* All DD kettlebells are coated in ""e coating"", and stand the test of time.  However, the e coating is known to be slightly slick, so chalking up the handle might be necessary.   [Here's a video from Laurel Blackburn showing the difference between Dragon Door and other brands after heavy use.](http://youtu.be/uI70SpXil8Y)
* For price, Dragon Doors are more expensive than you'll find in a lot of places (over $2 per pound).  Remember, you're buying quality on this one.  

[**CFF Kettlebells**](http://www.christiansfitnessfactory.com/index.php/Kettle-bells/CFF-24-kg-/-53-lb-Kettlebell-1.5-pood)  are another favorite among our comrades here at /r/kettlebell.  CFF also offers several other brands, as well as a wide range of fitness products.

* Weight classes are offered in kilograms from 4kg to 48kg, while other brands at CFF's website are offered in pounds.  
* Handles on the 24kg are 40mm thick and are 5.4"" between handles, which seems to be right on the money for nearly everyone.  Bells are decently round with a flat side showing weight on the front.  Bottoms are flat and smooth with no rubber pads.  
*  CFF kettlebells are coated in black enamel, which can potentially chip.  
*  CFF bells are priced $80.39 per bell for the 24kg after shipping (24kg is $55.44 before).  Most of their bells are a little above $1 per pound.  **NOTE** According to their site, they only ship to the lower 48 states, Hawaii, Alaska, and Canada.  Sorry Europeans/Asians/others.

[**LifeLine USA**](http://www.lifelineusa.com/products/allproducts/kettlebells.html) makes a decent kettlebell, but are a bit more expensive than CFF.  

* All weights are measured in kilograms, measuring from 4kg to 44kg.  
* Handles are a bit thicker and bigger on LL's than DD's, and the coating is less slick on the LL's.  The Dragon Door coating is tougher than Lifelines.  Bells are decently round with a pad on the front showing weight and a good bottom.  
* Lifeline bells are more expensive than CFF, but are cheaper than Dragon Door.  The 24kg bell is $79.99, which is about $1.50 per pound.  Shipping for the 24kg is about $23.95 for me in the lower 48.

[**Ader Kettlebells**](http://store.kettlebellinc.com/SearchResults.asp?Cat=20) are another popular variety of bells here at /r/kettlebell.  Priced around the same as  LifeLine, they're another popular brand.  

*  Weights are measured in kilograms, with what appears to be less weight selection than others.
*  Handles are a decent size and are easy on the hands, too.  The bell itself is a nice size with a spot naming the weight on the front and a nice sized pad on the bottom (no rubber).
* As mentioned, price is similar to Lifeline, BUT shipping is $29.00 a bell.  

[**MuscleDriver**](http://www.muscledriverusa.com/Kettlebell-Styles_c_472.html) are sweet for the money, and especially if you get one from the Wal Mart online store (for those of us on a tight budget).

* Weights are measured in kilograms but not as many weights are available and styles come in black series, gray series, and two others you won't need.  Gray series comes with a gray enamel coating that chips easy.
*  The handle is decent, albeit a bit too smooth.  Getting a good grip is easy, but keep your hands dry.  No immediate threat of it flying out of your hand, though.  The bell itself is a good shape and fits snug on your arms in the ""rest"" position.  Rubber plate on the bottom with an bolt holding it in can take some abuse.  
*  Price on these is pretty good for what you're buying.  Mine was under $80 for the bell and ground shipping, and it arrived in about a week.  

[CAP](http://www.amazon.com/CAP-Barbell-45--Pounds-Kettlebell/dp/B003J9M6I8/) are another cheaper brand that's good for the money you spend and easier on the budget. They're another good brand available at Wal Mart online stores for home shipping.  

*  Weights are measured in pounds from what I've seen online.  Most weight sizes are available, so no one gets left out until you're lifting super heavy weights.
* Handles are reported to be a decent size with an okay grip, though it's a bit smooth for some people's taste.  The bell is round and sits comfy on your arm with a smooth bottom.
* Price, as mentioned, is pretty good for the money and shipping doesn't hurt too much either on average.  Just remember that this and Muscle Driver are popular ""budget"" brands, so you will be sacrificing quality to a small extent.  

**Other brands to think about**

* [**Perform Better**](http://www.performbetter.com/detail.aspx_Q_ID_E_4711_A_CategoryID_E_420) offers a good kettlebell for the same $80 mark per 24kg bell as Lifeline and CFF and turn in decent reviews from everywhere.

* [**Apollo**](http://worldsstrongestlibrarian.com/7240/apollo-kettlebell/) makes a kettlebell, but the reviews I've found elsewhere are not very promising.  

* [**Kettlebells USA**](http://www.kettlebellsusa.com/) makes a good kettlebell that's another one for those on a budget.  However, the sacrifice here seems to be quality.  Some people have complained about small defects in the bells that make the bottom not quite as flat as it should be.  Other than that, they're basic line up is decent with a wide range of weights.  

* [**Wolverson**](http://www.wolverson-fitness.co.uk/Single-Kettlebells_B2369P.aspx) has Steve Cotter on one side suggesting they're his go to brand for kettlebells.  That's a good thing, I suppose.  

* [**Troy**](http://www.amazon.com/USA-Sports-Troy-Barbell-Kettlebell/dp/B002MVA0K0/ref=sr_1_6?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1309822441&amp;sr=8-6) makes a decent kettlebell that seems to be measured in pounds.  This is a way better price than I've seen elsewhere.

We have access to 20kg, 24kg, 32kg, 40kg and 48kg kettlebells.

I've therefore chosen to practice for the RKC snatch test, as in my opinion it is one of the more taxing kettlebell routines, including cardio, technique and of course, strength.

For those of you who don't know what the (RKC) snatch test is, it is to do 100 snatches in 5 minutes with a 24 kg bell, unlimitedhand switches.

After reading up a fair bit on the subject, one of the more popular ways to do it is to divide the exercises into three ""branches"".

**Strength**

To strengthen my core and give a good strength foundation I think I'll be doing some heavy deadlifts.

Also heavy routines like clean and jerk with heavy bells. I'll complete these jerks together with TGU's to improve my shoulder stability.

Pullups and chin-ups for the pulling motion that is required in the snatch technique.

**Cardio and endurance**

Swings and kettlebell complexes for that ""lifting endurance"".

Do intervals of heavy snatches, like 20/40 and then decrease rest period to 30 seconds, then down to 25 seconds, etc.

I also regularly run structured training schedules for some races, so the cardio I believe I got covered.

**Current status**

I'm up to 120 snatches in 5 minutes with a 16 kg bell as of yesterday. Still got a bit to go towards that 24 kg bell, but once I get my routine going I would estimate that is doable within a 6 month period, or..?

It's been a sore spot for me for a long time.  I have several problems.  One is I always bang my wrist and feel my elbow get jarred pretty badly when I lock out.  The second is the kettlebell always yanks me off balance on the way back down.  I'm not flipped the bell wide over my head on lockout.  I'm almost afraid I'm punching through too hard, causing the kettlebell to whiplash into my wrist.  And on the way back down, I worry I'm trying too hard to throw the kettlebell in front of me making it too hard to tame the descent.

So I was watching [this video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n__B-fzyiiQ).  And the first thing that jumps out at me is that he is splitting the difference of the kettlebell's arc with his torso.  Which is to say, to keep the kettlebell on a straighter more controlled line coming up and down, he moves his torso backward and forward to counterbalance.

So my question is, is this typical?  Is that an aspect of the form I should aspire to, or an unhealthy shortcut that could lead to injury?",,False,,t5_2rpqv,False,,,True,t3_opalb,http://www.reddit.com/r/kettlebell/comments/opalb/advice_on_the_snatch/,

Work it like a circuit and do a few rounds or Work things in combination with each other, or just do things in single sets.  Your choice.  If there is just a number you can break it up into sets.  there are two workouts, A and B.  A: is more grind movements and B: is more ballistic movements. We usually do a week of A,B,A,B,A rest B,A,B,A,B rest. have fun.  I hope this helps, or people enjoy it.  

A: more grinds;
100 swings,
5x10 push-ups,
5x5 pull-ups,
5x5 clean and jerks,
5x5 snatches,
5x5 front squats,

I have to knock out about 225 swings both today and tomorrow. I wanted today to be a relatively fast workout, yet still relatively heavy and challenging. Here's what I came up with . . .

TGU:

* 2L/2R x 70#/32kg
* 2L/2R x 88#/40kg

* 50 x 53#/24kg flips (25 forward/25 backward)
* 50 x 62#/28kg hand-to-hand swings
* 50 x 70#/32kg single-arm high pull swings (25L/25R)
* 50 x 88#/40kg two-hand swings
* 25 x 106#/48kg two-hand power swings

I knocked out all of the swings as quickly as possible -- breaking up each group into manageable sets.

In retrospect I would probably put that last set of power swings at the top of the workout to stimulate my nervous system. I do this often with a couple of sets of high-weight/low-rep barbell dead lifts.

Once in a while, I will have to go a week without working out (head cold, work, whatever). This last time, I noticed a pattern:

* Day 1: Feel awesome. Flawless on Snatches. Feel/know I have good form. Good grip. Catching snatches like a boss.
* Day 2: Still feel awesome. But, on the very first rep, the meaty part of my palm catches the handle just right and it pinches.

One pinch I can handle. However, from that point on, I can't seem to catch it ""just right"" (hook fingers; not tight grip, etc.) and I keep pinching.

The only thing that I do I switch to just swings for a few days and then go back to snatches later on.

My question to you, comrades, is, ""What are your shortterm hacks and cheats to over the pinching and the calluses for the Snatch?""

Linear motion in a straight line is known a Rectilinear Motion.  Motion along a curved path (such as in a swing) is known as Curvilinear Motion.""

Hello! I made a post in r/fitness the other day regarding strength training and Sanshou (Chinese style of kickboxing). Pretty much everyone said a 5x5 version of Starting Strength was the way to go. However, I've been increasingly interested in Kettlebells since I go discovered Enter the Kettlebell. I asked about kettlebells but no one seemed to mention anything about them. I noticed you have experience with both kettlebells and barbell compound lifts. In your opinion, would one be better than the other for this martial art? Ideally, I would like to incorporate kettlebells and barbells together. I just wouldn't know where to begin in terms of designing a program. I gave up on that a while ago. I decided if I was going to something I would pick an established program. Enough babbling. Any advice is appreciated.

**My Reply**

&gt; I'm not an expert in designing programs for martial arts, so just take my advice in to consideration and apply your knowledge.
Kettlebells are great at training for MA because of the loose to tight and back to loose component of it. Especially the swing. KBs will definitely do better for conditioning too, but nothing will get you stronger than using a barbell. So I guess, ask yourself, how strong do you need to be?

&gt; I basically do only most of the major lifts and then accessorize with KB work, but I'm not training for anything specific other than to get stronger and in better shape.

I'm a pretty strong guy (details below) who's recently been a member of a Crossfit box in my native Norway, but who's moving to California for a year. Crossfit in the US is ridiculously expensive, so I've opted to instead do a ""feasibility analysis"" on combining barbell training with kettlebell training, as it's quite simply way cheaper to buy a set of kettlebells than to do CF here (a set of three kb in different sizes cost me the same as about two months of membership at the box, fuck that shit). Who knows, I might be a kettlebell convert for life.

What I picture actually doing is reserving university gym time spent doing back squats, deadlifts and possibly some Olympic lifting and occasional pressing, while following ETK's Rite of Passage (seems like a combination of strength/coordination/conditioning) and ""graduating"" into other kettlebell workouts. 

I have a few days now where I've access to kettlebells up to 32kg, and until I leave for California in mid-August up to 20kg. I've figured I could spend this time doing the ETK Program Minimum and decide on what set to buy when I get to California. If all goes well this summer, I'm probably looking at the 20-24-32kg set Pavel sets for the ""stronger than average"" dude. The only issue then is how/when to implement double kettlebell exercises. I've experienced that especially double kettlebell front squats are gruelling. Pressing 24kg hasn't been much of a problem.

So basically what I'm asking is how you would suggest combining barbell training with kettlebell training, and how to gauge my future choice of kettlebells in August using what I have now (I'm going to start the Program Minimum with 16kg since I have no stamina). I'm looking forward to what you have to say, and not least getting my ass kicked by a cannonball with handle.

To the point, by squatting and standing up during my swing (as i had interpreted the motion was supposed to be, for whatever reason) my lower back was being contorted in ways a spine certainly should not be. By completely maintaining a slightly bent knee during the swing and allowing my explosiveness to shoot from the hip, so to speak, I've completely overcome this pretty basic yet scary issue.

On the **first day** he taught us the movements in the correct order (according to himself, of course(but I find it logical as almost each movement leads to the next)) and what to do if people are unable to perform them with good form.

The order was:

Swing

Clean

Press

Goblet Squat

Goblet Lunge

Kettlebell Row

Windmill

Reverse Get-Up

Snatch

The Reverse Get-Up is basically the same as a TGU but he found that it was safer to have people switch between hands in the standing position so that they wouldn't drop the weight on themselves if the kettlebell was slippery etc. 

On the **second day** he taught us the snatch and after that the tests started. We had to train a stranger who had never touched a kettlebell before. We got 40 min to teach our client the correct technique in the exercises we wanted and then put them through a 20 min workout.

I got a 155cm girl who could barely press a 6 kg bell, which really made me have to approach the techniques from a new angle as I am 193 cm and 112 kgs. 

After the training session, Maxwell spoke to the client and asked them what they thought of us as trainers. 

As a **final test** we had to demonstrate perfect form in all of the above exercises. He told me I had to fix my RGU a little bit but it was not enough to fail me so I passed! Wahoooo!

**If you have any questions about form ask away.**

I got a thyroid cancer diagnosis in January '13 and all exercise was halted till April-ish. I had a complete thyroidectomy and right neck dissection in February and radioactive iodine treatment in March - all of which was a helluva recovery for me. The major nerve that runs along with the trap muscle was necessarily severed during surgery. 

8 weeks ago, I got the medical clearance to start lifting again but started kettlebells instead (Michael Skogg). I thought I would never have full mobility of my right (dominant) neck and shoulder again but I have been proven wrong.

This week I was able to take off my mostly longer sleeved business casual shirts without being in pain since surgery. (Oh, the things we take for granted!) I believe I have regained 95% mobility in my neck and I feel a lot stronger and more mobile...and I owe it to kettlebells. Today after my workout I decided I wanted to repeat his program with a heavier bell, I got such good results in a relatively short amount of time. I'm ""fine"" now. I lost a lot of feeling in my right ear lobe/lower face/side of head and 90% of that has returned within 4 months of surgery and the standard (if any is regained) is around the 10 month mark, my ENT told me.

I have been kettlebelling for over a year and feel like i've got a good understanding of the techniques etc. 

My problem is that i have a copper iud. ( non hormonal, side effect of making periods heavier and longer :()

Since having the iud fitted in Feb 12, i notice that doing swings can become uncomfortable. Sometimes during the swing, sometimes after. For example on Friday, i had a great early morning kb session comprising mainly of swing sets. No discomfort during, just tired and sweaty. 

The next day i wake up feeling achey in inner thigh muscle, to be expected, and some low level periodlike cramps. I'm right at the end of the period so was not that concerned. 

I wake up this morning planning to do another workout and my entire loser pelvis is do painful, it hurts to walk. The pain is similar to a very extreme period pain. I ended up spending all day in bed with a hot water bottle and painkillers.

Has anyone else experienced this? I wonder if as the swing is driven by the hips, this could affect uterus muscles? Maybe causing the pain but then i know people such as Lauren Brooks have used kbells throughout pregnancy with no issue. 

I need my iud, only birth control i can use but i want to get back into kbell training. Advice, ideas anyone? 

( Quick note: i have had a number of sessions with a certified kbell instructor so i am fairly confident that my form is good)

With bells this heavy the handle is big enough that even wrapping my fingers around the bell there is still lots of contact with the edge of my palm.

When the bell comes down the fatty part of my palm at the base of my fingers is pulled until the center of my palm tears.  With a 24 I can do many more before I tear and 20 is small and light enough that it poses no problem.

I need to find a good 16kg/35 lb kettlebell that's not too costly (not a cheapo one but not the premium ones like dragon door). Just wondering if anyone else lives in the Toronto area and if you know where the best place to get one is? I've heard Treadmill Factory is good, and their price is just a smidge over $1/lb (plus I could pick it up instead of paying shipping). I'll look through the reviews list but any suggestions are welcome too. TreadmillFactory one: http://www.treadmillfactory.ca/p-510-c-105-35lbs-vinyl-kettlebell.html

I also found a program tracking site that I'll give a try: http://tracker.dailyburn.com/workout_programs/166004-Enter-the-Kettlebell-Program-Minimum

A pretty convoluted site with too much fluff, but I'm just going to use the exercise/program tracker portion.

Monday-MMA for 1 hour, Kettlebell workout

Tuesday- BJJ for 1 hour, kettlebell workout

Wednesday- BJJ for 1 hour, 1 hour rest, 1 hour of MMA

Thursday - rest day

Friday- 1 hour BJJ then immediately 1 hour MMA

Saturday - Kettlebell workout

Sunday- Rest day

The Kettlebell workout is a 5 round circuit of

15 2 handed KB swings

10 2 KB clean + press

12 2 handed KB squats (just sorta rest em on my shoulders and squat)

10 figure eights 

then rest for 1-2 minutes.

I'll admit it, I'm a KB newbie and this is sort of an amalgamation of workouts I've seen online.  I get a lot of ab-work done in MMA and BJJ so I don't really feel like anymore in the KB workout but I also might throw in a few sets of ab work in the sunday.

I've read countless articles about their ability to build functional strength, seen them in my local gym, and lurked here for a few months. I recently re-joined my local gym and about 10 days worth of workouts in finally tackled some kettlebells.

I didn't even try the popular lifts espoused here. Instead, I incorporated them into my normal routine as replacements for certain lifts. For starters, after seeing that the squat racks were full, I gave the kettlebell squat-and-curl a go. Holding a 30 lb bell close to my chest, I squatted down, curled the weight down and up, and drove my legs up. ""No sweat,"" I thought. 

About 2 sets in, however, I realized the genius of this lift. It kept me in the down position longer than I was used to, made me stabilize in a way I wasn't used to, and added another element to an already complex movement. By the end of my last set, I was pooped. 

Next, instead of dumbbell military press, I grabbed two 20 lb kettlebells and tried out the farmer's walk for the first time. I walked up the steps of my gym onto the 1/10th mile track upstairs and walked two laps with one break in between. By the time I walked back downstairs and racked the weights, my traps were absolutely shot. I gained a new respect for the strongmen you see doing the farmer's walk on TV with ungodly weights. I also threw in some kettlebell calf raises for good measure at the end.

Once I got home, I decided I had to get my hands on a kettlebell for my apartment. I immediately ran to this subreddit with the intention of figuring out what to buy. I ended up buying one 30 lb CAP kettlebell (mostly because of the price and the free two-day shipping I get via Amazon Prime).

I plan on incorporating a basic kettlebell routine for my off-days and days I can't make it to the gym. I look forward to tackling the Turkish getup, barbell swings, and all the crazy other movements you Soviets do regularly in here. 

Any comments or suggestions would be greatly appreciated.

A year ago, I got some kettlebells and began swinging myself into a lower-back injury!

This time around I'm much smarter, have studied more, and have been conditioning my core and teaching myself how to fully lock my spine during the hip-hinge movement.

The only problem I have is though is that my tail-bone region, AKA my sacrum, tends to move a bit during the hip-hinge. Visual evidence shows that my spine is completely locked, as well as touch (I can reach behind myself and touch my back as I hip-hinge and feel no movement from my lumbar to thoracic regions).

When I place my hand right above my buttocks, over my tail-bone region, I feel the bony region ""push"" backwards as I lower into the hinge, and pull back forward when I rise up and squeeze my glutes.

It's nearly impossible for me to prevent this movement.

Does anyone else experience this? It's pretty subtle and I can only detect it via touch. If it's not normal, I might forgo kettlebell training unless I find a solution.

Note that this bell is available from amazon with free super saver shipping (at least in the US) which makes it a great value.

The kettlebell is satisfyingly ""cannonball"" shaped, very round with a thick handle.  the surface is not perfectly smooth, as if it was cast or machined somewhat irregularly, but it's not an issue for use.

I just did one workout with it, mostly swings, cleans, and snatches.  Overall the CAP is great, however the handle is narrower than on my other kettlebells (cheapie vinyl ones shown below from Ocean State Job Lot, unsure of the brand)... this makes two handed swings sort of difficult as I feel my pinkie fingers are cramped on the handle.  However, for cleans or snatches, it is actually sort of nicer to have a narrower handle as it's a little easier to control.  I wear a men's medium glove (i think glove size 9?) so if you have large hands, I think the handle will be narrow for a 2 handed grip.  

Overall I think these are a great value, especially considering the free shipping.  I have never owned/used a high dollar (dragon door, etc) kettlebell, so maybe I don't know what I am missing... but if you can comfortably hold the handle then I think you will be happy with the CAP at half the price.

Picture of the CAP in between 2 of the Job Lot kb's, note the handle is thicker yet narrower.

I've watched a number of videos, but the differences don't seem all that different.  It almost looks like three of these are just variants on each other. 

This is what I'm talking about for a [romanian deadlift](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lBwiVywRB4s&amp;feature=player_detailpage#t=103s).  Yes?  No real bend in the legs, back essentially staying straight as you bend at the hips.  This one seems the easiest for me to differentiate.

I found this version of a [deadlift](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zF5CGQmNxyI&amp;feature=player_detailpage#t=32s), which kind of looks more like what I think a true deadlift might be.  Not only hinging at the hips while keeping the back straight (but not upright), but also squatting some until the kettlebell reaches the floor.   

I also found this version of a ['regular' deadlift](http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_detailpage&amp;v=fXG24rPx19s#t=93s), but it almost looks more like a squat to me.  Feet angled outwards, chest/back kept vertical.  Squat, yes?   
Now this one is actually labeled as a [squat](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJF8yU_9RCk&amp;feature=related), but looks the same to me as the previous deadlift.  Both squats?

And then the only real difference I see in a [sumo deadlift](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dDZmUpGF_dQ&amp;feature=player_detailpage#t=27s) is that the feet are further apart and definitely angled.

I have never been a serious weight-lifter; having only dabbled with machines in the gym.

My instructor is an RCK-II and he is very competent.  However there is something about the RKC hard style I just cannot grasp.  I am hoping someone here can offer me a different point of view that I might be able to grasp better.

I understand you are supposed to contract your muscles at the apex of a swing or a snatch, but I have two problems I cannot seem to solve:

1.  Just how hard should the hard style be?  What thing could I do in my home to create the same sort of tension or contraction I should be making at the end of each rep?  It seems that if I were trying to go super tight like in a game of tug-of-war that this takes too long and the bell is already falling before I get that level of tension.  If someone just says ""hard"" or ""tight"" I worry that what I mean by those words, and what they mean are different.

2.  Could someone offer some descriptions of the process of creating this tension?  I notice that often the tension starts in my legs and passes up me in a wave.  I find it difficult to tense my entire body at once.  If someone who is able to create this tension correctly could describe how it happens in their musculature then I think that might help me get more out of practice.

Update:

Christian,

Kettlebell manufacturing - especially kettlebells that have an e-coat finish - can be compared to snowflakes. It's almost impossible to have two kettlebells that are the exact same, especially if they are manufactured at different times, just because of the nature of the manufacturing. However, I can certainly guarantee you a finish that will be smoother and more to your liking.

There's no way that I can guarantee that it will be exactly like the one that you currently have.

From the look of the kettlebell on the left in the photo you provided, without actually feeling it, it looks like you might have a powder coated finished kettlebell, which we no longer use on the kettlebells. Powder coat finishes are smoother to the touch, but actually cause more hand injuries, because powder coat does not slide easily in your hand and instead catches and grabs at the skin. So we switched a while back to our original e-coat finish, which the majority of our customers agree is the best finish we've ever used (we've experimented with e-coating, powder coating and epoxy coatings over the years since we released our kettlebells).

However, the one on the right in the picture doesn't look like a kettlebell that should have passed our quality control inspection, and certainly doesn't look ""right.""

We'll ship you the replacement kettlebell and assuming it meets with your standards, you can use the box that it is shipped out to you in and have UPS pick that up when it's ready to be picked up. I'll see if we can delay the UPS Call Tag until after your replacement is sent and received.

Best,

Seeing as it was my birthday just recently, figured the weights would be a wiser choice as a gift than the latest video game.

£89.50 in total with delivery for paired 16kg competition style, normal style a little cheaper; can't remember where I read about the competition style, seems a better choice in the long run I guess.

I started ETK in November of 2011 then had to take a 2 month break in October 2012 for a variety of reasons...

In any case, I'm starting back up with the 44 lbs. at a very low level of reps (will build back up to 5x5 ladders) and want to make sure I'm not ignoring my legs and ending up like one these dudes:

http://savemisc.com/threads/images/f42782b624f9833de71d2162766a2cad.jpg

So here's my current routine:

Mondays:
3x3 Clean and Press ladders with a 44 lbs. KB
Roll Dice and do snatches for that many minutes with a 35 lbs. KB

Wednesdays 
3x3 Clean and Press ladders with a 44 lbs. KB
Roll Dice and do swings for that many minutes with a 35 lbs. KB

Thursdays
5 TGU (each side) with a 44 lbs. KB
(and whatever else I feel like)

Saturday
3x3 Clean and Press ladders with a 44 lbs. KB
Roll Dice and do swings for that many minutes with a 35 lbs. KB

I also walk my dog about 2 miles four times a week.

So here's my question:

Is this amount of snatches, swings and cleans (before my presses) enough of a lower body workout to 'even' out any upper body gains I make?

If not, can anyone recommend one or two simple routines and frequencies that I can do at home with KBs only? (I like to keep my workouts as simple as possible).

For instance: If I add 10 44 lbs. deadlifts to each workout, would that suffice?

 I'll jump right to it: I've been constructing a workout that I've been doing for the last two weeks. I also recently went from 12kg to 16kg. It looks like this:
(set x rep) I repeat this two times on each arm.

* **Turkish Get-ups** 4x6 
* **High Pulls / High Swings** 4x12
* **Snatches** 4x12
- Change arm here
* **Clean and presses** 4x12
* **Overhead squats/Front squats** 4x25
* **Renegade rows** 4x12
* **Burpees (diamond shaped push-ups)** 4x25

My question is: would it be more effective if I were to run through this twice instead of four times and just be switching between both arms on each exercise instead? The workout would look something like this instead:

**1 set = both arms**

* **Turkish Get-ups** 2x6 
* **High Pulls / High Swings** 2x12
* **Snatches** 2x12
* **Clean and presses** 2x12
* **Overhead squats/Front squats** 2x25
* **Renegade rows** 2x12
* **Burpees (diamond shaped push-ups)** 2x25

 I am quite new to kettlebells and shorter workouts so I am a bit confused.**I plan on doing this four times a week or should I ramp it up to five?**
 I should point out that my goal is strength, muscle mass and intensity firstly; but I don't want to skimp down on the conditioning part too much.

Thanks in advance, and yes, I am aware of that this post may seem noobish to some of you. And that is why I ask.

For a woman, what is a good starting weight? I've never lifted anything more than a fork in my life (I'm not fit at all) and I've read I should start anywhere from 6 lbs to 12.

Is there a good kettlebell DVD workout that is suitable for female beginners? I'm particularly concerned with learning proper form. It doesn't have to be a female instructor, but something I could follow.

There are some cheaper weights targeted towards women that use sand. Should I avoid these, or does it not matter? 

Should I incorporate other exercises into my routine? Rather, is it safe to just do kettlebells, or is muscle fatigue a serious issue?

I looked into it and found that my symptoms fit perfectly, line for line. And, now that I look back, my bouts coincide with when I bought my kettlebell at wallmart, down to the fact that when I started working out again this spring, I got sick again.

Disclaimer: I never got tested for cadmium poisoning because I only thought of it long after I had gotten sick and then better. Plus I don't have insurance anymore so I don't think it's worth the cost.

Oh, I should include the symptoms... Fever, fatigue, muscle soreness, feeling out of it. I was usually down for a little under a week at a time.

1308711446.0,4,self.kettlebell,i5um2,Clean &amp; Jerk Long Cycle,7,3,6,http://www.reddit.com/r/kettlebell/comments/i5um2/clean_jerk_long_cycle/,"**What is it?**

A competitive long cycle set is ten minutes of two consecutive, continuous movements: the clean and the jerk. Men compete with two bells, women with one. The lifter cleans the bell to the rack position, then jerks the bell(s) overhead and fixates the arm into a lockout. This is one rep. The bell is dropped down to the rack position, then dropped again into a swing, cleaned, jerked, so on and so forth. There is one hand switch, at the lifter's discretion.

**ONE ARM:**

*Clean:* [Valery Fedorenko](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kxtId59f7y8&amp;#t=48s)

1. The elbow remains tucked toward the body for the entirety of the lift.

2. Though VF doesn't do it, briefly raising onto your toes at the top of the clean (just before inserting your hand) can give you a bit more momentum. 

3. You can also rock back on to your heel for the backswing, then up onto the ball of your foot at the initiation of the upswing to give yourself a bit more momentum.

4. In my experience lifters will either aim their thumbs backward or forward, whereas VF is almost neutral between the two. It's your choice. Thumbs back with give you a longer arc, which leads to more distance and therefore more momentum, but is also a bit more work. Thumbs forward will shorten the arc, which can be useful when you need to get more reps in. Then again, a more neutral position between the two might be better for you. Do what works.


*Jerk:* [Emily Janes](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMxcXyziXdU) (I haven't heard her name before but she has spectacular form.)

1. You'll note that her best reps are accompanied by a loud smack of the heels on the jerk. This isn't a coincidence. :)

2. When you are dropping from the lockout position, coming up on the heels to meet the bell and then allowing yourself to dip with the weight helps absorb the shock. 

*Long Cycle:* [Lorna Kleidman and Maya Garcia](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZmXH_qGSayo)

1. The two women closest to the camera achieve master of sport (MS) with these sets. You can tell by the brief rests toward the beginning of each arm that they have exact repetition goals per minute. Lorna (foreground) needs 126, and she does 13/13/12/14/11 (left arm), whereas Maya (background) needs 110, and does 11/12/10/11/10 (left arm).

**TWO ARM:**

*Clean:* [Valery Fedorenko](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M4tvYedDZF8#t=38s)
 
1. Unlike the one arm clean, you don't have any torso rotation, so you lose out on that source of momentum.

2. Be very mindful of your fingers. You can see that VF cleans slightly out toward the shoulders, with his fingers curled, and *then* brings the bells together. 

*Jerk:* [Denis Vasiliev](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRGqBpA0o_U#t=16s)

*Long Cycle:* [Denis Vasiliev](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adJCFSFXhWo#t=41s)

1. Do you hear his heels? He is super consistent with this (and everything else, really.)

**BREATHING/PACING:**

[Sergey Rudnev](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y8fIDtDRgIU) in competition.

[Jason Dolby](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSNRY1xsdWI) in a workshop.

The major factor determining how many reps you get (beyond technique and strength, obviously) is how many breaths you take during the rack and the lockout. You can't do much about the time during your swing, nor the time it takes to move from rack to lockout. I have found that three breaths in the rack and one at top is ~6 repetitions a minute for me. The maximum you could get is probably somewhere around 16 or 17, and your technique is not going to be good. You'll wear out quickly and it's very likely that you will have a lot of ""bad reps"" that are not counted, since you would have difficulty locking out overhead. 

As an example, in the IKFF I am in the ""72KG+"" category for women. In order to get MS ranking with a 20kg bell, I would need 61 reps per hand, for a total of 122. My pace goal would therefore be an average of 12/minute with a set of 13. It really isn't that complicated, math-wise, to figure out a pace. The main thing is to experiment and see how many reps you get with a varying number of breaths in the rack and in the lockout. 

Other great lifters not mentioned above (a lot of Sergeys...)
Sergey Rudnev, Sergey Rachinskiy, Sergey Mishin, Sergey Merkulin, Ivan Denisov, Fedor Fuglev, and many many many more.

Stretching.

For GPP its been recommended to do KB specific variations of olympic squats, olympic deadlifts, and circuits of bodyweight exercises like pullups, pushups, situps, v-ups, sprints.

I'm 23, have a job from 9 am to 6 pm. I get up at 5 am. I like to get up early and do a lot of self improvement stuff in the morning (workout, meditate, learn specialized knowledge for my job). For 4-5 weeks now I've been doing yoga (DDP Yoga) 3 times a week and pushups, pullups, body weight squats, neck bridges in the days between.

I'm 6'4 and weigh 185 with visible abs, which sounds pretty good, but I carry more fat in my ass and legs. My flexed bicep is only 13 inches. I've been eating according to the recommendations of the Warrior Diet for the past 3 weeks.


**My goals are:**

* Become stronger in general and keep getting stronger
*  Improve my graciousness and freedom of movement (I spent all day walking on my feet, never sitting). I want to be relaxed and breathe freely.
*  Get a hot body. As much functional muscles as I can grow, super low body fat.
*  I want to improve my physical stats for Brazillian Ju Jitsu. More explosiveness, better coordination, better flexibility, better ability to endure intense physical exertion for a prolonged time. Also improve my grip strength and make my neck much stronger.


**Currently I'm planning to...**
Monday, Wednesday, Friday - keep doing yoga on those days
Tuesday, Thursday, Saturday/Sunday - do alternating A and B workouts with body weights and a kettlebell. Now i own 35lbs one, but I'll be getting a 53lbs and 70lbs ones shortly.

Right now I can do 14 chinups with my own weight, I also tried was able to pull myself up fully seveeral times a with a 35 pounds kettlebell hanging from my feet. I can do 35 pushups, 65 squats, 12 neck back bridges. I also tested lifting the 35 pounder over my head like a dumbell, without momentum, was able to do it 14 times.

You start by determining your max workload of snatches in a minute. For me this was 28 reps. You then determine your rep range for the next phase. For me this was 7.

The next phase is sets of 7 snatches done in 15 second blocks. You then take a 15 second break, switch hands and do 7 snatches in 15 seconds, rest, switch, work, rest, switch, work. You slowly work your way up from say 20 sets (10 minutes all in all) up to 80 sets (40 minutes all in all).

The next phase has you working for longer and breaking for longer....I seem to remember. I haven't gotten there yet!

Now my question is this: You are supposed to do snatches until ""feel a drop in intensity"". It's extremely vaguely written, so how would you interpret this?

You can keep making your 7 reps in time, even after you have peaked. Do you stop when you peak (""this feels easy!"")? Or do you stop when you can't make your 7 reps in time (""I am wasted and I only did 6 reps"")?

I can see the reasoning for stopping right after you peak: You are able to do more work the next day, since you haven't taxed the CNS as much. This is also in line with Pavel's ""greasing the groove"" technique. You do 20 sets of easy snatches and do it again the next day and the next and the next.

The open hand clean and press is one of the basic KB juggling moves.  It  changes the C&amp;P quite a bit though.  The first part of the movement, the palm clean, is pretty easy to do, but if you overpower your cleans, you can do some damage pretty quickly.  The part that gets interesting is the palm press.  This part of the movement brings out a lot of wrist flexibility issues with me at least.  While usually during my presses I tend to focus on solid grip and pushing the bell up with my fist, you can't do that with the palm version.  Trying to do that will end up making you dump the bell on your foot.  Having to focus on keeping the bell balanced while pushing it up adds some nice variety to the press.

As for the catch part, try it outside on soft ground.  Don't be afraid to bail out on it.  If you have done any ""catch one handed alternating swings"" it helps get the feel for how this part is supposed to work.  Once you get the catch down and the groove down it becomes really smooth.

I realize the price is not great, and the non-spherical-like design would mean it will get the shit kicked out of its corners, but are these the only reasons? Is it sandfilled or something?


So price aside, if it is solid iron, with a decent handle, does the shape affect something more than wear and tear? Would it affect the way in which you swing? If everything else about them is ok, is it the 'ergonic' design that makes it dumb? Does smashing the kb into your forearm benefit you in some way?

What about doing something like ETK with a lower number of reps, but finishing each rep slowly (for example: in a snatch going normal speed up, but trying to slow down the KB on the way back down)?

I'd like to start another AOS ETK cycle, starting at week 5 (3x3 ladders) and working up to 12 again.


My questions are:


* Should I take a week off from training before starting another cycle?
* If it turns out I can press the 24kg at least once, should I try using that instead of the 20?
* If the general consensus is to take a week off, should I continue lighter exercise (eg, going back to the upper echelons of the ROP for a week) or just relax?

Long version:

Hi all, 

I've been working out with kettlebells for a few years now. I did the ETK Rite of Passage program, the Art of Strength Providence DVD, and also did the Viking Warrior Conditioning snatch protocol. Over this time I noticed that my cardio conditioning was going through the roof, but my shoulder strength wasn't really improving. 

Skip ahead to two months ago, foolish me decided to do a high volume snatch workout without much of a warmup. BTW: I've always been religious about doing proper warmups, but for whatever reason that day I was rushed and thought I would just get into the core workout. Surprise surprise, the next day my right shoulder is extremely sore. The day after that it's in pain, like I can't lift up my arm. After a week of this my wife convinces me to go the doctor. I get xrays and an arthrogram and the doctor tells me that I have an inflamed shoulder joint, the result of early stage degenerative arthritis (aka osteo-arthritis). 

Basically the cartilage in my shoulders is getting worn down and there's pretty much shit all they can do about it, apart from some steroid shots to ease the pain. Eventually if it gets really bad they may need to operate and/or replace the joint. 

I asked the doctors about kettlebell workouts and they didn't have a clue. What they told me was exercise was good, but decrease intensity and frequency so that you don't aggravate the joint, but they didn't know anything about kettlebells in particular. 

So my question, for someone that may have some experience/knowledge of these types of things - should I continue with kettlebell workouts to build strength around the shoulder joint or will kettlebell workouts just make the issue worse? Any feedback/comments/direction would be appreciated.

I recently heard about kettlebells and have done some research the past few days. It seems promising, and I've read a lot of great things about ETK and other such programs. I have also seen people saying that they are a waste of time or that they don't really do much. I just wanted some honest advice, since I am looking to potentially start with kettlebells, but can't afford to throw money around.

So:

Assume kettlebell workouts are the primary (or solitary) method of strength training, and that I start and stick to the program. Perhaps AoS as a standard.

a) How well do kettlebells work? I've heard mixed reviews.

b) What kind of results should I expect if/when I start with them (assume PM from ETK)

c) How fast would results be apparent? Both visible results and noticeablyincreased strength. (I'm 170, 6'1"", but not muscular, kinda twiggy I suppose)

d) In conjunction with d, what kind of visible affects would I see on my body over a longer period of time? (Say at the end of PM to the middle of RoP)

In my search for how to do them I came across this classic exercise from the original RKC.  [The High Windmill](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6651sjanpxI) *cotter video*.

You start by putting the KB overhead and kind of kick out your hip.  If you are starting on the right side, kick the hip out to the right and keep the leg straight.  Then look up at the bell, keep your chest out and bend down and touch the ground.  When you are as low as you are going to go, tense the glutes and follow the same path back up.

When I do this I am feeling a stretch in my hamstrings and a burn in my obliques.

So since everybody wants to eventually get good at a two handed anyhow (right?!) and the bent press is one of the more popular ways to get up big weights, this exercise can certainly help your progress.  If you are one of those weirdos who don't like flailing around with a couple mismatched weights this exercise is still fantastic for your back, core *shudder*, and the upper body in general.  So enjoy it!

They were great except for the way they coated the handle. They must have dipped it or something because there was quite a bit of excess at the bottom of the handle due to gravity. So I tried sanding it down a little bit and found that even though I had what felt perfectly smooth, when I chalk up my hands the tiny un-seeable crevices hold a lot of chalk and make the grip too rough. I then sanded the handle more until I got a very consistent feel, used a few grades of sand paper and very fine steel wool, and finally painted it with Rustoleum black gloss spray paint. My question: Has anyone else done this before? If so, how long did you have to wait for the paint to dry enough that you could do snatches and cleans without worrying about the paint getting damaged? How many coats did you do, and was there anything special about painting technique that helped avoid drip marks?

Just started on Kettlebells a few weeks ago. Doing ETK. Have a few q's:

1) When I switch from two-handed to one-handed Kettlebells, do I do the required ETK reps (eg, 20) for each side, or do I split the reps between sides?

2) To confirm, I should be keeping my shoulders down and back and in their sockets at all times, right?

3) In the Art of Strength Kettlebell workbook, it says to begin practicing the snatch/c&amp;p drills prior to the warmup on week 3. Why prior to the warmup (wouldn't post-warmup be better?), and what drills is the author referencing? Am I simply supposed to practice the movements?

I'm a big guy, 6'4"" 218 lbs., and fairly well trained with weights, but new to kettlebells.

I have read a bit about kettlebells and watched a few instructional videos and feel ready to take the plunge. I just don't want to drop $50+ on a kettlebell only to find out that it is way to small or way to big for me where I am just now. 

I've done a few sets of 2 handed swings with a 35 pound KB at the gym at my work. No one there has any information to share on KB selection. The 35 pound seemed pretty light to me. I mean, it got my blood pumping after a couple sets of 20, but I didn't think of it as strenuous. 

So, I open myself to the wisdom of the group. What would you recommend for me? Go big or go home and start with a 50 or 55 pounder? Hit a sweet spot at 45 and work that for a while? Anyone else start off with one weight and then rapidly realize their mistake?

Edit: The consensus opinion is to go ahead and start with a 35lb/16kg bell since many/most of the exercises will be too challenging with the larger bells. Some have opined it is useful to acquire a larger 53lb/24kg at the same time to have something for the less challenging exercise to start and to have something to move up to when well conditioned with the 35lb bell.

With this in mind, I am now looking for a good deal on KB. I'm a frugal guy, so I don't want to lay out a bunch of money for this. I'm looking at CAP KBs through Walmart as they have a 35lb bell for $48 shipped.

So the wife and I have been running and eating a much healthier diet (less than 1500 calories for sure, less 1000 on some days, super low sugar and low carbs as well) and are looking to introduce some strength training to the mix. 

After a lot of reading and like 4 past life gym memberships (i was in so much better shape when all i did was work, drink, workout, hook up, work, drink, hookup, workout... the past 5 years of togetherness has slowed me down) i'm thinkin kettlebells are the way to go for the both of us (if it were just me i'd probably go more traditional with ""lifting"" and free weights in addition to running and b-ball)

And here's the part where i'm think you guys might want to make fun of me. I found a ""workout system"" called Kettle Worx. its 20 minutes a day, 6 days a week, and i can gett he dvd's plus a bell from around 60 (10 lb bell)to 80 (20 lb bell) bones at Sports Authority.

Is this stupid? or shoudl i just buy some various bells and try to do workouts i can find on here? I'm thinking the fact that its a 20 minute program witha  DVD we'd watch and do together, that it might help us out more. 

Part of my issue is unfamilarity with these kettlebell/crossfit/bodyweight exercises. I mean i can help scrutanize a proper 3 and 5 step drop for a Quarterback, how to pitch from the wind up vs the stretch, and how to bang with you ass then pivot and get a good look at the backboard in the post. but when it comes to this kettlebell stuff, i'm a total fish out of water. My primary goal is to keep my wife and i motivated and participating. We both need to lose at least 30 to 50 lbs of fat and also build strength. I'd like to build more stregth than her, she'd like to lose a greater porportion of fat than I (i of course have more total lbs to lose, but as a man, they are easier to shed, already dropped 10 in week 1)

So anyway, other things to consider i guess would be that we run at least 1 mile ata  time, sometimes run 2. will be looking to move to 1.5 and a 3 mile ""long run"" soon. like within a week.  and we're running/doing burpees 6 days a week, using day 7 for stretch and rest. and yes this everyday thing is working great for us. we're enjoying it very much. so thats why i'm excited but cautous. i dont want to burn us out, so think the 20 minutes of kettlebells might be justt eh trick. she has flat out refused to even entertaint he idea of p90x for 60 mins a day 6 days a week. she said she's open to 20 mins a day for strength training though.

so yeah, any advice is much appreciated. thanks in advance. ",,False,,t5_2rpqv,False,,,True,t3_gl4o6,http://www.reddit.com/r/kettlebell/comments/gl4o6/kettlebells_for_beginers/,

Supposedly, it is used as a final test of physical and mental endurance for prospective Secret Service agents.

Equipment needed:

- A kettlebell, 24kg at the absolute minimum. If you can't get your hands on one, 55lbs is acceptable.

- A stopwatch.

- A bucket.

Rules:

- Set the stopwatch to ten minutes.

- Start the timer.

- Snatch for ten minutes.

You may switch hands as often as you like. You can put the bell down and rest if you want. Keep whatever pace works for you. You could even just use one arm for the whole ten minutes if you're physically capable. The only thing that matters is the total number of reps completed. 200 is considered a passing score, or one every three seconds.

I've been working out with kettlebells for 4-5 months now.   I love them.  I'm on military deployment and am thinking of blowing my tax-free savings on a full set when I get home.  Between my wife, teenage son, two more growing boys, and fellow Marines I think I can get a lot of use out of a full set.  Any pros/cons on the following?

Metrixx set has 9 iron kettlebells: 8kg - 40kg in 4kg increments.

Paradigm Pro set has 8 steel kettlebells: 8 - 36kg (no 40).

Any problems with only having one of each?  Should I double up on a few of the weights I use most often (20, 24kg)?

I've never used a pro design, but the handles look a lot narrower than the standard/common iron kettlebells.  Is this a problem for anything like 2-handed swings?

Anyone know much about either brand?

Should I splurge on the steel set if I plan to get many years of use out of them?  Or, should I go with the iron set since I'll need the 88 pounder to train for my RKC...eventually.

I always thought it was just generic trauma from repeated impact when I started out.  My form has improved drastically since I started, and I don't bash my forearms any more.

I was doing 36kg snatches a couple days ago, and something in my right wrist popped, and I had severe pain all the way to my shoulder.  I couldn't even do a press or have anything touch my forearm, it was so tender.  

I went to the doctor yesterday.  Lo and Behold.....tendonitis.  He said it likely was instigated early on by my bad form causing inflammation and trauma.  The inflamed tendons then were more susceptible to RSI from cleans, snatches, presses, etc.  What would have been a simple rest, ice, and ibuprofin for a couple days to let swelling go down caused by the impacts has no exacerbated to 3 weeks of no arm work :(

Lesson learned.  The spirit is willing, but the flesh is spongy and bruised...lol  Do not worth through pain unless it's merely DOMS.  You can set yourself back a few weeks by thinking you are more of a badass than you really are.

However its been hurting for over 3 months and I've had to quit my kickboxing classes to let it heal.

It only hurts when I twist my body and I was wondering if anyone has experienced this or know what I've done to my back.

Here is where the pain is at and when I inhale deeply i feel pain as well as when i twist my back. Somedays it hurts a lot, somedays it feels like its nearly better (it could to do with how I'm sleeping which is preventing it from healing fully since I sleep on my side).

Is it a torn muscle or just a really badly strained one? I've never been injured for this long (I'm 21).",,False,,t5_2rpqv,False,,,True,t3_1axtpi,http://www.reddit.com/r/kettlebell/comments/1axtpi/injured_my_back_doing_clean_and_press_one_handed/,

I was quite an enthusiast for a while then ultimately faded in my dedication..

So after watching them collect dust on my floor for the last year I decided to undertake a challenge over the next 90 days to do 90 snatches a day, 45 per arm with one of my 20 kg bells.

* Day 1 was brutal, I stopped several times to catch my breath, ultimately finished in 6 minutes and 36 seconds. 

* Day 2 I knocked the time down to 5 minute and 47 seconds, and promptly vomited.

* Today was the 3rd day, I was full of trepidation and was putting off doing it, I ultimately re-affirmed my commitment to myself and CRUSHED my time from the previous attempts.  4 minutes and 33 seconds to complete all 90 snatches.

Now I'm left wondering how low I can go for times, safely of course. 

I'm feeling sub 4 minutes is entirely possible.

I now do a five min snatch interval at the end (15 sec on/15 off) and then return to the jump snatch for another ten mins.  

Both are still difficult, but my breathing/heart drops so much quicker when resting from the regular snatch.  I hardly recover with the jumps.

[Here](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ii3RdPFRys) it is.  I don't incorporate my arms until the momentum from the legs dies (this guy brings in his arms too soon, IMHO).  Yes, you still feel it in your arms/back AND you can use a heavier weight, putting more intensity on your upper body.

I've spent hours watching YouTube videos improving my form and hundreds of dollars buying equipment.  So far I have seen moderate muscle growth / fat reduction and was excited about my progress.  However, I'm at a stand still due to kettlebell scarcity, price, etc.  I like using kettlebells, but I feel they are over glorified for what they are.  Here are some issues I've ran into with kettlebells I think curious people should know about:

* Lower priced kettlebells that lure you in are junk, primarily CAP.  If you seriously get into working out with them (i.e. double clean, double swing), the paint comes off extremely easily which leads to rust since they are iron.  The paint stays on about as well as an egg's shell after being boiled.

* Professional kettlebells a.k.a. steele kettlebells are too expensive to justify anything.  I know of no store that carries steele kettlebells let a lone iron above 35 lbs.  You will pay shipping prices you never knew existed to acquire them and they're more awkard to use than smaller iron kettlebells.  I know Dick's carries iron kettlebells above 35 lbs though you'll pay the same price as ordering online w/ shipping.

* Dumbells trump kettlebells in everyway: price, range of motion, availability.  Many kettlebell excersizes can be emulated with dumbells.

* Kettlebell specific excersizes are overrated.  Swing, I find myself doing walking lunges and dead lifts instead and get better results.  Snatch, not too different from a dumbbell snatch and twice as dangerous. Clean / Press / Jerk, should be obvious something close to it can be performed by dumbbells.

* It is near impossible to progress without higher weight and that means lots of $$$ with kettlebells.  For the price I paid in kettlebells so far I could have purchased a pair of adjustable dumbbells, a nice bench with decent workout clothing.",,False,,t5_2rpqv,False,,,True,t3_1it2oy,http://www.reddit.com/r/kettlebell/comments/1it2oy/my_issue_with_kettlebells/,

As a Sophomore in college, gym equipment is unfortunately lower than say food or gas on my budget. I made this using ten dollars worth of plumbing supplies and some cheapo weights. It is just 3/4 inch galvanized piping, a floor flange, and a 3/4 inch T-Handle. Put it all together and loc-tight it into place with some 1 inch hole weights, and you have a perfect Kettlebell. All finished, it ran me about 50 dollars.  

What are you guys' suggestions for improvements?
