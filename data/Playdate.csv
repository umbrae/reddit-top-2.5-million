This way, redditors can play the multiplayer modes of their favorite games without having to worry about having too few players. 

**Here is how this subreddit works. Moderators will post an ""Official Playdate voting post"" each week. In these posts, community members will comment with a game name, and these comments will be upvoted based on interest. The top voted games will receive playdates during that week and will be posted on the sidebar for the whole subreddit to see. Once these playdates are published, a new voting post will appear and voting for the next week of games will begin.
You can also schedule your own playdates by making your own post with the system, game title, date, and time you wish to play the game. The more obscure the title, the later you should schedule the playdate to ensure you have enough players.**

Teams wear appropriate colours for their civilization and the fight just continues going for days.

I've had a person tell me directly that a suggestion I made wasn't appropriate to the subreddit on the grounds that it has popularity (World of Tanks).

I've seen someone comment that Alien Swarm was inappropriate to the subreddit on the grounds that while hundreds of people may be playing, it's only 4 to a group and therefore doesn't qualify as a ""swarm"".

I just want to say this now:  **THERE IS NO SUCH THING AS A GAME THAT IS INAPPROPRIATE TO R/PLAYDATE**

While I agree that we should put our primary focus on the less popular titles, I do not think it's a good idea to exclude any game for any reason.  The swarm wants to have a TF2 night and blow each other up?  Have at it.  MW2 night?  Let's go booster hunting!

If we want to limit the play on popular games that's fine, but to automatically exclude games because ""it's too popular"" or ""too many people play that"" will just turn us into 9,000+ game hipsters.

It is sometimes referred to as an FPS+Z game, because of the emphasis on freedom of movement. 

There was also a fateful bug: you were allowed to slide down slopes at high speeds by pressing space bar really, really fast. This came to be scripted, then officially supported. Rolling landscapes were the norm: you skiied down hills (picking up speed), jetted from the bottom of the hill high into the air, spotted a far-away hill, timed your jetting so as to land on that downward slope, and gained even more speed. 

The main gametype was capture the flag. Since there was no speed cap, people could go very, very fast, and a lot of strategic depth resulted. Tribes 2 was released in 2001 and unfortunately arrived somewhat broken, in terms of game crashes, physics, random dead-stops on invisible seams, overpowered vehicles and a general feeling that you were moving in molasses. After a few years, the community had modded it into a brilliant state. 

Eventually master server support was lost, but the game was revived in ~2009 when the people at [TribesNext](http://www.tribesnext.com/) reprogrammed server support. Fortunately for this subreddit, that means that the game is also completely free, since the company that released it no longer exists. Considering the game's age, I find the graphics to be elegantly done. But that could just be nostalgia speaking. Anyone's computer should be able to run it.

The only ""problem"" is that Tribes 2 still has a small but thriving community. There is still at least one full server a night. If it's not obscure enough, we could take a collective step back and play Tribes 1 instead :)

**I'm editing this post to toss in a couple videos, since many of you guys have probably never seen the game before.** 

[This](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AB-mEvbj404) is what I am hoping to get out of our swarm, and probably the best video to watch for someone who has never played the game. Don't be confused by the fact that the first ~25 seconds are from Quake and other games. It's just a quick intro. [This](http://youtu.be/obGSbyhYFeM?hd=1) is how you actually play the damn thing -- watch it for extra credit, and only after deciding that you want to install Tribes. [This](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2wgwwpbh91Q&amp;feature=youtu.be) is a video of good players showing off. [This](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igjM6KOm8ZE) is what competitive play looks like. I am not sure if the last video would be too confusing for someone who's never played the game, but it was a very exciting match regardless (not that I played in it. They're all much better than me).

NS is a mod for HL where two factions (Marines and Aliens) fight. It's a cross FPS/RTS.

Players in the Alien team collect resources which anybody can use to evolve, or the Builders can use to create structures (which can heal allies or attack enemies). Several evolutions are available: A fast scout that can climb walls and enter small passageways, a flying-shooting attacker, a building drone, a huge mammoth, and others I've forgotten.

Players in the Human team fight to obtain the same resources, but only one person is in charge of the building. He decides where to place turrets, ammo, and so on, and the other marines can help speed up the build process, or simply shoot at aliens.

Alien Swarm is constantly used as a great example of what PlayDate is meant for.

The problem is this:

Alien Swarm worked because it's a great game, but more and more of the suggestions in this subreddit are - to be perfectly honest - shitty games that no one wants to play, let alone buy for only a couple hours of playtime. Case in point: today I have noticed Wave Racer 64 as a suggestion. I know this is only one example, but really, who the hell wants to play Wave Racer 64??

Yeah, you and your two friends are nostalgic for it, I get it. I feel that way about shitty games I used to play as well. But you can't expect a PlayDate event to surface around this, and even if it did, how many people do you honestly expect to show up? When no one wants to play your shitty game, it's not fair to then say that this community is falling apart. There are only so many older games that we can stand to play anymore.

So, what's my solution? (Wouldn't be fair to complain without suggesting an alternative.)

It seems like the general mindset around here is that once we've played a game, like Alien Swarm, that it's off ""the list"" and we need to schedule an infinite number of different games, each exponentially less enjoyable than the last. ""Monday Night Combat Mondays"" was a great idea. One game that we all miss playing every week. Why don't we do that with all the games? Have ""Alien Swarm Sunday"" or something similar, leaving Tuesday or Thursday for ""Shitty Game That Only 17 Redditors Own"" days?

1312904514.0,80,self.Playdate,jdkc3,Playdate FAQ,88,8,33,http://www.reddit.com/r/Playdate/comments/jdkc3/playdate_faq/,"**Q: Why was this subreddit created?**

A: Reddit User Schnevets was tired of fun games with dead communities. He posted this rage comic to /r/gaming and the response was huge. /r/Playdate was created by anr0b, and now you’re reading this FAQ. Schnevets is now one of the moderators of this community, and is helping guide it towards his idea.

**Q: So who decides what games get played? Is it Santa?**

A: You do! Thanks to /r/Playdate user (and now moderator) rooftoptile's voting system, every week there’s a thread, that will be linked to in the sidebar. Everyone votes for their top choices, or submits a new idea. From the top submissions, the games for the week will be chosen. Often, there will be some category of game that are required for the week, and the top that fits that requirement will be picked. Examples of these categories are “Free on Friday” or “Multi platform on Monday.”

**Q: So, we’ll be playing TF2 and CODBLOPS everyday then, right? Those are the most popular...**

A: First of all, any given game has a 2 month grace period once it has been selected for a playdate. That means, even though it is possible for TF2 to come up as an official playdate, it can’t be chosen every week, and it won’t gum up the dates so there’s room for games with less followers to get a chance too. Also, this community was created from a group of like-minded redditors, who all want to see less popular games get their day in the light. Hopefully, with the categories of the week and the limit on repeats, it will be enough to let the community pick the games they want, without spending all our days teabagging 13 year olds on COD.

**Q: I think Obscurotron 2000: Nostalgia Factor X would be a perfect game, and no one plays it anymore! I can never get enough upvotes in the voting thread!**

A: Just because there’s an official playdate game, doesn’t mean you can’t schedule your own in the subreddit itself. Organize your own alternate playdate by submitting a new thread! Pick a date, maybe one that has an official game very different from the one you want to do. Think of it this way, The official dates are here to pick the OFFICIAL game of the day, and the other threads are for organizing unofficial playdates. The Mods will NEVER shut down an alternate playdate, and even encourage it! Instead of posting “We should play Game X someday” post “Alternate Playdate: Game X on Tuesday!” We only ask, that since this community is new, try and have a little patience. I bet we’ll get to your game as an official date soon!

**Q: Popular Shooter: Day of WWII Zombies is picked for Monday! That’s bullshit, it should totally be Obscurotron**

A: Yes, Popular Shooter was picked. And Yes, the community was created to help revive Obscurotron. But who decides that Popular Shooter is just too damn popular? Who says, “NO! That game is FORBIDDEN!” Making that kind of decision would be more controversial than just letting Popular Shooter have its day, and setting up the community so that the other 59 out of 60 days are more in line with the communities expectations. May we suggest, on that day, if you are upset by Popular Shooter getting all up in your playdate business, you read a nice book, play one of the 4000 games you have on steam you never played, or even organize an alternate playdate for that day with a game you’d like to see.

**Q: Alright, I’m on board. I want to play today’s game. How do I find other redditors?** A: In the sidebar we’ll have a game discussion thread for today’s game. Players can post server info there. Also, we have a steam group, created by /r/Playdate user (now moderator) Douchebag_Alphamale, where you can participate in the group chat to organize games (Steam Group LINK) and an IRC channel for non-steam games. Don’t forget there’s also in game server browsers. Put {R} in front of your handle/steam name, and if you host a server, put {R} in front of it.

**Q: You guy’s know I’m poor right?**

A: Every week, at least one free game will be played. We can’t do only free games, or lots of really great options would be eliminated. No one is going to be able to play every game, and it’s not expected. The community is organized around players reviving a game the love for a day. If you want to buy an older game you’ve never played before to join in the fun, awesome! But at a game a day, and at least one free game, there will be pleanty of options as long as you’re patient.

**Q: Why are we playing some games twice in a week? I thought there was a 2 month limit?**

A: The most well attended two game of the past week are played again at the end of the week before the next round. That means successfully revived games don’t have to wait 2 months for more action, and unsuccessfully revived games will have to wait for a while before they get to be tried again.

**Q: This is mostly good, but that one rule about the one thing is totally bullshit and is going to kill this community. I can’t believe your doing that.**

A: Everyone is going to have their opinion on how this should work, and want only their favorite games to be picked. As of writing this, the community is four days old. Let’s give us a chance to try these ideas out, and see what works, and what needs tweaking. With these rules, we’re trying to be as inclusive as possible, while maintaining the original goal, without being overly authoritative. It’s a tough plate to balance. And of course, we want to know what you think would help make the community better. Send us a moderator mail, or open a thread with your suggestion. None of this is written in stone, but we want to try this system out first before we make radical changes.

**Q: Considering I live half-way across the world and my internet is routed through a kangaroo pouch, gaming with you guys would be untimely and the ping would be unfathomable. How do I play?**

A: Luckily for you Aussies and Eurasian Gamers, we have set up two different versions of /R/Playdate. PlaydateEU can be found [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/playdateEU), while PlaydateAUS has been set up for you lovely Playdate Mates. It can be found [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/playdateAus).

Certain games, like Magicka, Left 4 Dead and our kickoff Alien Swarm, are focused on working well with a small amount of players. Mass-playing these games doesn't make sense, since you usually can scrape up three people to play with any time.

What we should be doing is focusing on games that are designed for more players, but that aren't popular. Examples include Plain Sight, Lead and Gold, various Sourcemods, Dogfighter, etc. etc. You get the idea.

See, these ""bigger"" games aren't really fun with few players, since they're not designed for them.

A great example is Battlefield 1942. Great game with a massive scale, but the community is scarce and everyone sticks to their private servers. A Playdate server with max players on both teams would make for a hell of an experience.

Instead, what we have now is hundreds, perhaps even thousands of players who clump together in small, separate groups to play the same game, while not actually playing the *same* game.

Our little PlayDateEU subreddit is coming along nicely.  Of course, we don't quite have the player-base that you guys have - but we've got a great group of regular, core gamers that participate often and I can only see that gradually growing.  I know in the past there has been discussion as to *why the hell have a separate sub-reddit just for the EU*, but it actually makes a lot of sense when deciding *when* and *where* to play, and who plays from both a time and latency   perspective.  This is not what this post is about.

I thought it would be cool if, at a point in the not to distance future, we pick an FPS, or other game (by popular vote), and have an EU vs US match.  To keep things fair, we can do half of it on a US server (East coast preferably), and the other half of it on an EU server (which I can provide, as I've been hosting stuff for EU players regularly).

I think this would be immense fun.  In the interests of keeping this cheap, I've had a look at *insurgency* (from an FPS perspective) which looks like it fits the bill appropriately.  Obviously, for the course of the event, we can change our tags to {R/EU}.

All game suggestions should be submitted in here. Avoid reposting the game you want, to maximize its chance of winning. The top 6 games will be selected for official playdates. You may be thinking, ""But anr0b, can't you count?! We're voting for 8 days not 6!"" This is because I'm implementing a new idea thought up by your fellow gamer, stennett. **The most successful 2 playdates during the week, as decided by your votes, will each get one more official playdate during the last Saturday and Sunday.** You will vote for which game gets replayed by having ONE post in this thread, I don't care who posts it, just make sure there's just one, that looks like this: **REPLAY:(GameNameHere)**.


One more thing. We're going to have **categories of the week** now, which means regardless of which 6 games get voted to the top, the mods are going to make sure that the top voted game of a certain category(multiplatform games, free games, sourcemods, games that could run on your grandmother's pentium III) gets an official playdate. That's a lot to take in, and I hope you all aren't confused.


This week's categories are **free games** (reserved for friday), and **multi-platform games**(reserved for monday)
Free game friday. Multi-platform monday. See what I did there?**


Keep in mind **you can still submit any game, and any game can win the vote, regardless of categories.**


**TL;DR** Start submitting and voting. You can have multiple submissions, but make them separate posts to avoid confusion. Please **do not downvote**. I know you guys have your ways. Voting ends Saturday August 13th, 2011.


P.S. On a side note, I'm glad all my work isn't going to waste, you guys are a great community of gamers. I really enjoy these playdates, and it really pains me sometimes to see I can't be a part of some of them because I'm a poor college student.

How would we feel about encouraging Hamachi as a tool for r/Playdate? It's a small program that lets you create a virtual LAN network for 16 people, eliminating hosting problems or port forwarding issues. A large problem for us right now is the lack of servers, and lack of people who can host servers. Tuckerism and Tevoul both run great servers, but they need to switch games nearly every day to keep up with the official playdate.  
  
  
I'm not suggesting we replace them, but we can use Hamachi to run servers for previous playdates or alternative front page playdates, without having to rely on someone to host a local server or dedicated server. If someone suggests a game, finds some people who are interested that have Hamachi, then they can set a time and date without concerning themselves over how the server is going to be run.

Yikes.

Essentially, those of us who want to participate for each playdate have to shell out quite a bit. *""Well, don't play every day!""* Of course I won't, but that's not really fair to miss out on a total of *five* playdates (see: Sun - Thurs this week) if we can't pay for it.

Thus, I'd like to propose 2 solutions:

1. We limit the paid games to three times a week instead of the five like this week. That way, at least **the majority of the week can include EVERYONE**, and not just those who have the money for it.

2. We have an **official alternative FREE playdate** ([see this thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/Playdate/comments/ja78u/is_there_any_way_we_could_have_an_alternative/)) for those of us who can't pay for the main one. I mean, [there's tons of free quality multiplayer games out there and we could rotate ones we really like](http://www.reddit.com/r/Playdate/comments/jabft/list_of_1845_free_games_pc/). This *only* has to be done three times a week since four of the week would be free.

I think this is fair because A) literally everyone (if a newcomer subscribes to this subreddit and wants to check it out but they have to immediately shell out $20 it could discourage them but wait, there's a free one that night? Cool!) and doesn't exclude *anyone* on the fun and 2) those who do want to pay for their games can join the main playdate.

1.

Apparently, event notifications interrupt or even crash games for some people, and that's not okay! From now on, we'll be limiting event notifications to focus time related matters and urgent matters.

2. We'll cut down on the announcement notifications where we can. Giveaway announcements will not be going away, but if two giveaways are created at the same time, we may compile them both into one announcement. Stuff like that.

We think by taking these two steps we can continue to bring important information to our users without it being too much. We'd like to remind you, however, that Playdate has a busy schedule. Each week there's voting threads, gotw threads, focus time announcements, etc. Our point is, don't expect a *major* change in the number of notifications, but we'll do what we can.

So guys, what I was thinking would be nice, is if we had a nice big in-house, on-line, game-fight near the start of January, with possibly some prizes, you know, a gaming tournament.

But honestly, I don't know what game to pick to play, which is obviously a problem, so, I request from you, my loyal community members, what games would interest you for the tourney?

Just a couple of quick guidelines for the games you suggest:

* 1v1.
* Spectatable.
* Savable replays.

Server IP: **176.9.138.202** or **rts.minecraft-wars.com**

The server has been completely rebuilt from the ground up with many player suggested features and optizmations included. The server features a fresh, fully generated world to explore and wage war over.  May the best faction win!

We will be launching on *3/23/2012* at 1:00PM UTC-7 / 4:00PM UTC-4 / 8:00PM UTC+0 / 9:00PM UTC+1

-----------

Minecraft Wars is the idea of playing minecraft with a strategic mindset. Through the use of a plugin called Factions, players can group up to form city-states and compete for dominance over a vast world and multiverse.  A Faction can be destroyed if their leader's power is dropped to the minimum (*-20*) at your hands!  Once the leader is out of power, the faction is disbanded and all territory controlled, is removed.  You lose 4 power on each death and power will regenerate over time.

Factions gain power for each player added. The amount of power added to the faction decreases the more players the faction has.  A faction can be sieged with TNT cannons only when it's members are online, the explosion protection turns on after the last member is offline for at least 9 minutes.

Factions can form strategic alliances with one and another. Leaders are able to customize how other factions, and members of their own faction interact with their territory for ultimate control.  

Over time, we will be rolling out various specialize PvP maps, available via special multiverse portals for special competitions of PvP skill for rewards and resources.


There are many plugins installed on the server to offer a varied style of gameplay. Some other noteable plguins include: 

* mcMMO -Offers a Role Playing like skill system to the game.
* CreativeGates -Make portals for instant travel between any two locations on the server.
* Multiverse -Many worlds to explore and conquer.
* iConomy -Player Wallets and economy system.
* Jobs -Players can join a job to earn money by mining, farming and crafting.
* ChestShop -Factions can create shops at spawn to trade valuable materials.
* HeroBounty -Place bounties on other players, or hunt targets for cubecoins.
* TopPVP -Keeps track of the number deaths and kills each player has.
* Falsebook -Create redstone circuits with Intergrated Circuits for more compact and complex designs.
* LavaFurnace -Power furnaces with lava and utilize production chests for advanced smelting.
* Spout -Server and Client software that adds some nifty features to Factions and mcMMO.
* and many, many more!

Come join us for the grand relaunch of our server which spawned from a suggestion by a [r/playdate](http://www.reddit.com/r/Playdate/) member many months ago. This is our 6th launch, so we have really refined the formula! The battles rages 24/7 for control of The End and it's many hidden riches.

I'm the one who originally suggested Eternal Silence around the time when r/Playdate was first started. It turned out to be the most popular playdate of its time, and I stupidly missed it because we were still getting ourselves organized. I would like to make this a fun and memorable playdate this weekend, so I thought I'd get a thread started now. 

Eternal Silence is a class based space combat game that also includes infantry combat. The ships fly and handle similarly to the ones in Battlefront II, and the infantry combat is reminiscent of Battlefield 2142 Titan Mode. 

Each team starts with a capital ship and three Corvettes (defensive ships that fire high powered lasers and are lined with many turrets). You will spawn on foot inside of the capital ship and have your choice of a multitude of different ships. 

There are two parts to every round. In the beginning, teams battle to take out each other's Corvettes, lowering their defenses. The bomber will do this the quickest, but it is quite vulnerable and needs an escort. Whoever loses their three corvettes first then goes into defensive mode, and we now proceed to part 2: capturing the defending team's capital ship. This is all seamless, and if the defending team prefers to fight in space, they can. However, the attacking team will now be able to land inside the defender's capital ship and begin to capture it piece by piece by holding 3 or 4 control points inside the ship. Once captured, the attackers score, all corvettes respawn, and the round goes back to part 1. 

This game is very innovative and is by far the most original and enjoyable source mod I've played yet. Best of all, it's free! So, if you have a compatible source game, you have no reason not to download it! If you don't have a source game yet, go buy Portal 2, it's only $15 today!

**Since this game is basically dead, I would like for us to plan to play on the focus time. It is unlikely that you will find any players until that time. We will be playing on Saturday at 8:00PM EDT.**

*Let's MUD!*

**what is Let's MUD!?**:

let's MUD is an effort to create a little community interested in trying out MUD's together, hooking up both in-game and through IRC to talk about the currently featured MUD we are playing. 

**MUD?** *Wait! - what is a MUD!?*

MUD stands for Multi User Dungeon and in a nutshell are *mostly* text-based MMO type games featuring massive worlds and deep multiplayer gameplay. 

**Why is Let's MUD for you?**

You have always been interested in MUDs but didnt know anyone to play with.

You want to take the plunge but the idea of getting used to a mostly text-based interface has been putting you off

You love the thought of deep and vast MMORPG-type games that can be played / accessed on almost any rig anywhere. 

You want to hang out and have fun with fellow redditors (hey what other reason do you really need?)

It isn't for you. Hey that's cool too!

It predates Starcraft 1 and its still played today because its so good.  It's now referred to as continuum but its the same game.

Trench wars is the most popular 'zone'/game type still around.

This would be good for /r/playdate because of low system reqs, low learning curve, and small download.

** Edit ** 
Some additional info:
Trench Wars is basically a game of capture (and hold) the flag.  There's 2 teams, and 1 base with the flag room, and they both try to capture and hold it.  There's I think 8 different types of space ships to play, each with their own playstyle and strengths and weaknesses.  You can actually create your own team (the default is 2), they are called frequencies.  so we could create a reddit team and fight the 2 default teams for dominance!  We can also have our own chat channel

I'm looking for a dedicated gamer friend who isn't shy on trying new games or discussing playing games together. Such as diablo 3, binary domain, guild wars 2, star wars the old republic. Where we wait for each other, experience the game together, and maybe perhaps share our lives with each other in a friendly way.

I believe that experiencing a game with friends is much more enjoyable then a single player experience. However, i do acknowledge games such as Kingdoms of Amalur, Skyrim and a few others are much more enjoyable alone. So, I won't butt into their ""single player"" game time too much as i myself have not complete KoA. 

I'm an only child. So I rarely have anybody to play with. I've met a few people online. However, many of them already have their respective groups and as such, i do not want to butt into their cliques as it is not very nice. 

Most of my real life friends aren't really gamers and as such, I do only casual games with them. 

I've been searching for such a friend/group for a long time and one of my good online friends introduced me to this sub-reddit and after a lot of consideration, decided to take my chances here.

I do hope I could meet someone/a group that is willing to take me in and be buddies. 

My last point is that, i'm from asia. Singapore to be more specific. I do not mind latency issues if i can find a dedicated gamer group and am willing to compromise time zones and stuff.

It is a very simple game, from the moddb page:

There are two teams. You either play as an overweight WW2 pilot in the survivor team or as a suicider disguised as a pot plant in the suicider team.

&gt;The goal for the survivors is to stay alive and to spot the suiciders. They have a couple of throw-able copies of the book: “Gardening for Beginners – by Barbara Bush” as a self-defense weapon.

&gt;The goal for suiciders is to sneak up close enough to the survivors in order to blow themselves up. Because each map is full of shrubberies its very hard to spot a real suicidal pot plant among the many fake ones. If a shrubbery isn’t moving, you can’t tell if he is being controlled by another player or not.

&gt;Currently the game doesn’t have any other goal then being simple team deathmatch. However it still is a lot of fun and you should definitely try it out with a few friends.

Description:

Eternal Silence is a fast-paced tactical multiplayer space shooter! There are five ship classes to choose from: The Fighter, Heavy Fighter, Bomber, Interceptor, and Dropship. Each ship has strengths and weaknesses, and the different classes rely heavily on teamwork to operate effectively. Gameplay in Eternal Silence is highly reminiscent of the space battle levels from Battlefront 2 -- two capital ships and several other smaller ships with a mix of fighters thrown in. The objective is to capture the enemy's ship by boarding and holding a control point. The weapons are pretty standard, a space shooter assault rifle and pistol. The assault rifle has the unique ability to be mounted as a sentry and fired remotely.

All things considered, Eternal Silence is an interesting shooter that manages to keep an identity of its own while drawing from other popular games.

Description:

Probably one of the most interesting shooters out on the market due to the creativity of its gameplay, Shattered Horizon is multiplayer, space, zero gravity rolled into a first person shooter. Your suit has the ability to create an artificial gravity on any surface you fly to... but you will probably be spending a lot of time getting disoriented -- in a fun way -- flying around the maps. It's disorienting due to being able to spin in space while not on a surface, sometimes intentionally, sometimes not. 

Shattered Horizon is quite creative and you'll find a bunch of cool details the developers put into it. For instance since you can't hear gunshots and sounds in space, the suit actually simulates those sounds. But if you turn your suit's power off or it gets disabled, you hear nothing but the breathing of your character. Go check it out, it's cheap, fun and creative!

Description:

Frozen Synapse is a simultaneous turn-based strategy game focused on squad-based combat. You play out tactical situations in various scenarios, including VIP Escort, hostage rescue, extermination, secure, etc. Each turn, players give orders to their squad, and after submitting their turn the game engine plays the outcome. Think chess on steroids.

Frozen Synapse has an immersive single-player campaign, instant matchmaking for multi-player, randomly generated maps; Facebook, Twitter, and YouTube integration (replays can be submitted straight to Youtube).

It should be noted that Frozen Synapse can be played as slow as chess-by-mail. You can play many matches simultaneously at your own pace. You can submit your turn, go to work, then come home and make another move. This is a great game for people whose work schedule isn't 9-5 and can't make it to most scheduled matches.

[AirBuccaneers](http://ludocraft.oulu.fi/airbuccaneers/) is a total conversion mod for Unreal Tournament 2004, containing ""intense and strategic hot air balloon fights,"" with ""airships, cannons, air-mines and various other antiquated gadgets."" The gameplay is ""a combination of graceful air ballet (with explosions), fierce pirate-like action (such as sword fights and ship-to-ship grappling/boarding) and 3D tactical maneuvering.""

The games journalism website [Rock Paper Shotgun has had success organizing days](http://www.rockpapershotgun.com/2009/06/17/so-lets-play-some-air-buccaneers/) when their readers played this mod together, a few times over the years.  Jim Rossignol of RPS gives a compelling description of the game:

.
&gt;""You can get involved in gigantic balloon battles in beautifully bleak places. ...
&gt;I’d forgotten how ludicrously characterful the game is. The strange tale of abandoned tribes and mushroom gods, and a war fought via hot air-balloon. It’s filled with entertaining ideas: aerial mines that are fired by rocket, only to hang in the sky, waiting for a victim. Or the rocket propelled glider that takes you up the critical central 'battleship' balloon, that is often the focus of any single battle.
&gt;
&gt;The game itself is an interesting tension between slow-moving aircraft, and the fast paced melee/explosives combat. Watching people leap from one balloon to another, only to miss, grapple the underside of the ship, fight on deck, fall again, and up in a sword battle dangling from the bottom of an airship, really is quite something to behold. i was watching one battle where one of our pilots was fighting two enemies, hanging from the bottom of the ship on a grapple, as we bombarded the ship with cannons. He killed one, died, and then the battleship went down in flames. *Heroic*.
&gt;
&gt;Not to mention plunging to your death is always amusing punctuation between the slow maneuvering of the balloons. The wind, it seems, is a jerk. Surviving a fall and getting back to the safety of your base without getting eaten by a mushroom is also a rather unique gaming experience.""

One of the best Source mods. I played the shit out of this years ago. Can we get a play date?

There's usually around 10-15 people playing at any given time, lower late at night.

As for a server, I guess we could go on any one there is. I usually go to the Old Timers server when I play with my friends, but they don't allow swearing, which I imagine a lot of you like to do, but any empty server would be good.

So what do you all say?


**EDIT:** For those just getting here to read this...

I am probably going to rent a server. I will make a new post once I have paid for it, and we can set a date. I'm thinking of buying it soon, and it will last for a month, so y'all will get your own personal Reddit Playdate server for a month!

Unfortunately, though, we couldn't make a server for as many people who might be interested in playing, most servers are 9 or 10 people and anything close to 16 is a bad time for the Hidden. I wouldn't want to rent a second server, but, hey, if there's demand for it, I will. Over two would be out of my budget. There are plenty of empty servers if you're real desperate to play. ;P

As for location, I was thinking New York, but I wouldn't know how good that would be for non-NA Redditors. A good option would be one server for NA, one for Europe.

Two servers seems like a good idea, so... Hell, I'll just rent them. I shall make a post tomorrow about this.",,False,,t5_2spg8,True,,,True,t3_j9bho,http://www.reddit.com/r/Playdate/comments/j9bho/the_hidden_source/,

http://youtu.be/bkBYVNrjjIs

* **What?** Thanks to the magic of the PC modding community, the Nintendo 64 classic is being recreated on the source engine. According to Moddb, [Goldeneye: Source](http://www.moddb.com/mods/goldeneye-source) ""is a total conversion modification of Half-Life 2. It is a fan made artistic recreation, released for free, with only one goal in mind;  to bring the memories and experiences from the original GoldenEye64 back to life using Source' Orange Box Technology."" 

It seems that they've just left a long beta, which should mean a great, polished, entirely community-driven experience.

* **How?** It'll cost you nothing to install the game [**here**](http://www.moddb.com/mods/goldeneye-source/downloads/ges-v41-full-install-exe) as long as you own at least one Source game already. Watch HD video of gameplay [here](http://youtu.be/swhFBPDGZXc?hd=1&amp;t=21s) and [here](http://youtu.be/gA05z_f3rHs?hd=1).

* **When?** Wednesday, August 24, 2011.

[Screenshots](http://www.moddb.com/mods/goldeneye-source/images)

*It continues to be massively helpful for people to supplement these informational snapshots with your own information. Player strategies, server quirks, magazine reviews, demo information (pertinent question: can we take the demo version online for a test drive?), and even pretty pictures would contribute something. Either post your information in reply to these threads or message this account ahead of time and we will do our best to incorporate them.*

Pro Tip: Goldeneye incorporates a brief player [invulnerability](http://youtu.be/Tl0LZsyi_tA?hd=1) after each registered hit. Spraying people with bullets does surprisingly little damage as a result. Instead of spraying and praying, use individual shots and burst fire to take down enemies.

**Cautionary note: A common bug in Source mods is an empty server list. We've come up with two workarounds, though no lasting solutions.** 

Both involve joining servers directly from Steam. One workaround is to go here:

http://steamcommunity.com/groups/redditpd/members

Find a Redditor playing the game, right click, and join from browser.

The other very related workaround is to pull up the Steam browser list. In Steam, go view -&gt; Servers (brings up a huge list of servers) then narrow it down by clicking Change Filters -&gt; Game -&gt; GoldenEye: Source.

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=huwhGH6A1s4


(Ok so this is a bit of an interest check/builder before posting into the official events section)

http://fsmod.com/

This is one of those mods  in need of a revival, especially for the fact how epic it is. There is already a strong but small community around it which keeps playing in spite of the fact we hardly fill the servers on normal days.

There was  a campaign recently that attracted around 30+ ish to the server on sunday evenings(Afternoon US). However it hasn't quite caught people into playing often.

I had also (not affiliated with FS in any way) tried posting the campaign battles on reddit to hopefully drum up interest with varying success. I thought after seeing multiple OMG I WANT A STAR WARS BATTLEFIELD upvote frenzy and ZOMG WANT BATTLEFIELD 3, that it may have been more appealing. Heres the threads if anyone is interested:

http://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/j8wm7/first_strike_star_wars_mod_for_bf2142s_campaign/

http://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/imaln/hokey_religions_and_ancient_weapons_are_no_match/

http://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/hsro4/stay_on_target_were_too_close_stay_on_target/

Imo it is much more fun than battlefront 1+2, although it is much more like the galactic conquest mod for bf1942 which I'm sure many have played except being more tactical. 

This comes from squad leaders being able to lay spawn points, a bit like project reality. The only way to do this is also in an officer kit, which also has an area scan a deployable gun a bacta canister and binoculars. There are also the large troop carriers which act like moveable bases. If anyone cares to watch the first thread I linked to there is also a video of one of the cap ship space battles, which when played with large numbers are very tactical and you have to line up your ships concentrate fire and ressuply with a vunerable barge.

I know reddit hates it but bf2142 is on origin http://store.origin.com/store/eaemea/en_US/DisplayProductDetailsPage/ThemeID.850300/productID.85062100 it isn't exactly a bomb of a price and bf2142 is also a good game too.

Part of the reason imo that first strike hasn't at the moment got a larger player base is a lot to do with the absoloutly and utterly retarded system they had with the 1.51 update. To this point there is still an incorrect 1.51 version on the EA forums which is labeled 'final version'. However on the First strike forums there are lots of set up guides. http://forums.fsmod.com/viewtopic.php?id=9938

We had all hoped and prayed it would get onto steam after bazzas announcement which migh have got rid of the version problems but alas that seemed to fail. http://i.imgur.com/iczR5.png

I haven't used the origin service but this might update correctly automatically.

**TL;DR If you like star wars then you are missing out by not playing this. If you like slightly more tactical experiences this might be your flavour too. This mod really deserves a breath of life as the developers still continue to play what they created even with a little less numbers.**

We've opted to take a break this week and not select any official games nor focus times. This is due in part to not receiving any nominations throughout the week and therefore being unable to hold a vote. Looking at a steady decline of nominations over the past few weeks we think that this may be a reflection of problems with the new nominating/voting system and as such, we plan to take the time off to work on improving the system. More on that to come.

Additionally, we expect many users to begin school or class this week, or be headed in that direction, and general participation of games and focus times will likely drop. We hope that by providing a week off those users will be able to better focus on their transition and come back next week ready to game.

That said, we are sure that some users are interested in gaming *now*, so we've been contemplating the possibility of a special Saturday night gaming session. How does... TF2 Mann vs Machine sound? The ideal date for this would be Saturday, August 25 beginning at 8:00 PM EDT. Let us know if you're interested so we can determine if there'll be enough in numbers.

Finally, although no games are being played officially, please do not hesitate to start up an unofficial playdate for your favorite game. Just create a thread! Then, ask if people are interested in playing with you, or take the initiative and schedule a game time/server for people to play.

Also, please consider [nominating a game.](http://redd.it/wnv0b) Recently two nominations were provided. Just two more nominations is all that's necessary to hold a vote. Remember, nominating will stay open until the end of Friday, August 24. If we get enough nominations, voting will begin Saturday, August 25 and we'll select games on Monday, August 27.

Thanks for reading and have an awesome week!

I'm a gamer in US-CST with kids looking for other easy-going, casual gamers (with working microphones) to beef up my Steam friends list.  I mention the kids because it typically means I:

* Usually play late (10pm-1am CST normally)
* Typically cannot guarantee that I'll be online in advance, which means no definite schedules

I'm up for most anything on my [games list](http://steamcommunity.com/id/JackTorrents/games
), but especially the following games:

* Borderlands
  * I've put only 7 hours into this so far.  Because of my erratic schedule I can't commit to a dedicated co-op group, but would love one off games here or there.  My current character is level 11, as I recall.
* Portal 2
  * I've played most of the stock co-op levels, but it was on the Xbox 360 and I've forgotten most of them.  Would love to play this on my new gaming PC with someone.
* Left 4 Dead 2
  * New to this too... I've only played 2 scenarios so far, but I love it.
* PAYDAY: The Heist
  * I've played 3 of the scenarios in this, and only won the bank level.  Would love to play it some more.
* Team Fortress 2
  * I'm a casual pubber at this game... I have extensive Quake and UT experience, so I'm not new to competitive shooters, but I am to team-based games, and TF2's metagame and memes bewilder me sometimes.  I think it'd be a lot of fun to team up with a buddy and see what a couple of players who cooperate can accomplish.
* Saints Row: The Third
  * 11 hours in, so I haven't finished the game yet, but I am curious how it plays co-op.
* Tribes: Ascend
  * I'm not a hard core tribes person, but I do enjoy this game, although I suck.  I've played it with a buddy via Mumble before, and the game is 10 times more enjoyable that way to me...

I'm looking for gamer friends with working microphones only.  I prefer Mumble and have a server available, but am willing to use other software if necessary, but I don't get much out of co-op pay without microphones.

2. The three primary games will be **played all week, concurrently.**

3. There will be dedicated **focus times for each game** during the week, to be advertised after voting is finished.

4. If a game is lacking participation, the mods will **switch it with an alternate.** 

As a reminder, we'd like to discourage the community from repeating primary games, but the alternates are encouraged to be recommended again.

Details haven't been fully revealed, but you do get money for killing the robots and you can upgrade your abilities and weapons in between waves. More information can be found at the official [Mann vs. Machine website](http://www.teamfortress.com/mvm/).  

Hopefully this thread will be used to set up a lot of full groups so we all get an opportunity to experience the glorious 6-player robot exploding goodness!

I wanted to take a minute and apologize for the frequent notifications in the Steam group. I understand that this is annoying a lot of you, and possibly causing many of you to leave the group.

Obviously that's not good for any of us, so I'm trying to come up with some methods that will allow us to post important information without being *too* annoying. In the meantime, I ask that you recognize that Playdate is an active group. Each week we're voting on games, choosing games, playing focus times, holding giveaways, etc. Thus, there's a lot of information to list.

I hope you can understand our dilemma. If you have any suggestions, please let us know! Even if you decide to leave the Steam group, please consider sticking with the subreddit.

Thanks for your time, and have a great weekend.

I usually idle in ""The Galaxy"" server in Chicago. Careful though, there are two called The Galaxy. My name is C^10 on there...

I'll be on steam chat too, name C^10.


EDIT1: We are taking over the less populated of the two ""The Galaxy"" servers from Chicago!

EDIT2: Things we found out so far...

1) Everyone should use the same connection type. We used Excellent with good results in 2-4 player Mario Kart.

2 Everyone should use the same game client and the same video plugin. We had best results with Jabo's Direct3D8 1.6, but there are two identical ones in the dropdown selection menu. Use the bottom one.

3) Go to options &gt; settings &gt; options tab. Uncheck 'pause emulation when window not active'. Then, ***important*** change N64 4mb expansion pack to 'not plugged in'. OK to save changes.

4) Go to Options &gt; Configure Controller Plugin &gt; Make sure ""none"" is selected for plugin and then click Assign Keys to setup your 360 or playstation controller buttons.

5) We had trouble with 4 player Goldeneye as well as 4 player mario kart. It seems if there are 4 people in mario kart on race mode, the game speeds up to about 140% of it's regular speed *but only during races*. We played 4 player battle mode just fine.

Remember those popular games back in the day that involved Worms? You know, the ones that had a huge arsenal of weapons to blow each other up with. Well, Hedgewars is a modern day ""clone"" of Worms, but the player takes control of little hedgehogs.

It's basically a free multiplayer turn-based game where players fight against each other in deathmatch or team deathmatch type game-modes. Each player gets their turn to plan out how they are going to kill their opponent's Hedgehogs, whether it be strategic or creative, or just blowing the map up (maps are destructible). A huge list of weapons and items are in this game, from grenades to remote-control fighter planes; countless of ways to have fun. Players can also customize their lineup of hedgehogs with a wide variety of skins (such as Ryu from Street Fighter or Sonic from Sonic the Hedgehog).

Company of Heroes is a Real Time Strategy (RTS) game based on the European Campaign of World War 2. It is a historical match up of Axis versus Allies, with you in command. Use thoughtful strategies and cunning tactics to acquire more territory, more resources, and build a larger force to overthrow your enemy.

Notable Highlights:

* Uses a 'cover system' for units, basically another layer of strategy (simply leading your troops into a battle will be disastrous)
* Includes map making software
* WW2 theme
* The multiplayer is really fun, but watch out for smurfs and laggers!

Weapons and gameplay elements are taken from Half-Life 2. In HL2: DM, you can shoot toilets (!) and other props at enemy players, or just shoot them with standard weapons. Best of all, you can probably get it for free because of a graphics card promotion on Steam (see above).

Everything you see is usable. The site uses Steam OpenID, a secure way to log in (more info in Wikipedia or Google). It just send to the web your SteamID so it can be sure that you are who you pretend to be so we can avoid impersonators.
More in the making:

* User control panel (some parts in internal testing).
* Ability to delete posts (can be done manually if you ask me). DONE!
* Ability to search. PARTLY DONE.

1. **Suggest a game; upvote the ones you'd like to play.** 

2. We will be selecting **three games** and **three alternates.**

2. The three primary games will be **played all week, concurrently.**

3. There will be dedicated **focus times for each game** during the week, to be advertised after voting is finished.

4. If a game is lacking participation, the mods will **switch it with an alternate.** 

As a reminder, we'd like to discourage the community from repeating primary games, but the alternates are encouraged to be recommended again.


**SUPER IMPORTANT NOTE:** We realllllllly need sidebar icons for the games. Feel free to respond to game suggestions with an icon that we can use if the game wins!

Remember, there's still about an hour left in the Steam sales so if you didn't win, you still have a short amount of time to pick these games up on the cheap. Thanks so much everyone for making this an awesome experience. Hope everyone has a great 2012!

**Edit**: Dejobaan Games have pitched in a few keys for their title [Aaaaa! for the Awesome](http://store.steampowered.com/app/15560/) as well! The game goes for 75% off through tomorrow morning, and there is now an added giveaway thread in the comments below, thanks to the awesome folks at Dejobaan!

**Original**: Hello everyone. I'm with Arcen Games, and we've been celebrating our involvement in Steam's Holiday Sale and Gift Pile Treasure Hunt by stopping by some notable gaming subreddits to run a few giveaways of our games. It's going on through Monday morning and we still have a few keys still to give out, so read on if you're interested in entering for a chance to win a copy of one of our titles.

What we're giving away, and where you can get it (on the cheap) if you don't win it:

**Steam Titles**

You can grab our deep space strategy title [AI War](http://store.steampowered.com/app/40400) and any/all of its DLC for 75% off through December 31st (even more savings if you go with the Alien Bundle which is everything together.) Not only that but it has a featured achievement Steam users can unlock to earn and win more stuff through the current [The Great Gift Pile treasure hunt event](http://store.steampowered.com/holidaysale) running in conjunction with the huge sale.

Our unique puzzler [Tidalis](http://store.steampowered.com/app/40420/) is 80% off on Steam as well. If you're into deep block-based puzzling (note: not match-3) for $2 instead of $10, make sure to take advantage of the hefty discount.

All Steam sales end January 2, at around 10 AM Pacific time.

**Non-Steam Titles**

Our in-development sprawling 2D sidescroller [A Valley Without Wind](http://www.arcengames.com/w/index.php/avww-buy) is available for pre-order now through our site at 50% off the launch price (at the moment it's $10 as opposed to $20.)  You can also grab it on MacGamesStore, Impulse, and GamersGate. Currently in public beta the game is not yet available on Steam, but if/when it does arrive the licence key you'll receive will work to activate the game on Valve's client.


If you'd like to try any of these games you can find the AI War demo [here](http://www.arcengames.com/w/index.php/aiwar-downloads), Tidalis demo [here](http://www.arcengames.com/w/index.php/tidalis-downloads), and AVWW demo [here](http://www.arcengames.com/w/index.php/avww-downloads). The AI War and Tidalis demos are also available through Steam, though I believe that those are just the PC versions.

How you can participate in the giveaway:


Per request I'll be giving out the keys by asking in the comments for a number between such and such, so I can use a RNG to pick a winner. If the winning number has been selected by more than one person than I'll renumber those who picked right and roll again. If no one picked the number that comes up, I'll find the number closet to--and you can go over (not PiR rules.) The threads are open until I edit the original post saying differently. I'll close them sometime in the next day or so, figure out the winners, and deliver the licence keys to their inboxes.


We'll be adding extra keys to the drawing as we reach various milestones in upvotes, points, and participants to add some incentive for those participating to upvote and get everyone here involved. Basically, as this post accumulates more points and entries, I'll add in extra keys and draw additional winners for them accordingly.


If you do end up picking up [AI War](http://reddit.com/r/aiwar) or [A Valley Without Wind](http://reddit.com/r/avww) during the sale/giveaway, consider checking out their respective subreddits for regular updates and discussion.


Thanks everyone and best of luck. Happy new year as well!

Love,

[Arcen Games](http://twitter.com/arcengames)

**Edit**: An amendment to the rules above as wisely suggested by Reddit user cyantist. The reasoning is good enough for me:

*I want to encourage you to run the random number generator until you get a hit, rather than find the closest number submission. Shouldn't everyone get an equal chance? If 3 people choose 13, 14, 15 for a chance to win AI War, why then should 14 get a 1/81 chance of winning and 13 and 15 have more than that?*

*Why should people who post later get better chances? (Due to the fact that they can choose numbers relative to those who have already posted.)*",,False,,t5_2spg8,True,,,True,t3_nyh9p,http://www.reddit.com/r/Playdate/comments/nyh9p/happy_new_year_rplaydate_we_have_a_few_leftover/,

Bitfighter is a free, open source, 2D top down shooter. You pilot a small triangular ship and can blast away enemies using several different weapons and modules. Matches are played on a variety of different game modes including Retrieve, Rabbit, and Capture the Flag... oh, and there's even a Soccer mode!

What makes Bitfighter special are the custom levels. Bitfighter only comes with a handful of stock levels, and the majority of games are played on user-created content. Levels are formatted as a simple text file so sharing is easy, and downloading levels take &lt;10 seconds (possibly longer depending on your connection). As a result, gameplay is kept fresh and exciting.

Bitfighter features eight game modes, five weapons, seven modules, and numerous gameplay objects. There's even a built-in level editor!

1341949836.0,24,self.Playdate,wcejh,[ANNOUNCEMENT] New Voting Method!,28,4,4,http://www.reddit.com/r/Playdate/comments/wcejh/announcement_new_voting_method/,"**Introduction**

---

Here at Playdate we strive to provide the best services to our users and are always looking for new ways to innovate and impress. [continue obligatory and super cheesy political speak.]

... Alright! So here's the deal. Over the past several months we have been tweaking our voting system and it has finally culminated in a major system change. We have detailed the process below, but first, here are the benefits of this new system:

1. *Plenty of time to nominate or vote.* You may now nominate Wednesday - Friday, and vote Saturday - Sunday. We'll take care of transferring the nominations to the voting thread for you.
2. *Voting couldn't be easier.* Just upvote the games you want to play! Also, you only need to vote once.
3. *No more confusion!* Each component (nominating &amp; voting) is now separate, and each has its own thread. Not sure where to go? The active thread will be easily accessible via a link in the sidebar.

[**Check out this image before reading for a visual timeline!**](http://i.imgur.com/46cEo.jpg)

---

**Here's how NOMINATING works.**

---

- With the new method you are able to nominate for a much longer time than previous iterations of the nominating process. Nominating typically begins sometime on Wednesday and closes early Saturday morning*.
- The nominating phase is now separated from the voting phase. A new nominating thread is posted weekly and there will always be a button in the sidebar directing users to the active thread
- Simply post your game suggestion in the nomination thread! You can post up to three suggestions. There are a couple of minimal rules when nominating, but they shouldn't take you more than a minute to follow. :) These rules can be found in the nominating thread.
- When the nominating phase ends and the voting phase begins, /u/PlaydateBot will copy/paste all nominations from the nomination thread to the voting thread simultaneously. The reason we're using a bot account is to ensure that no one mod will get high amounts of comment karma -- hey, some people care about that stuff! ;)
- If the nominator wishes to edit or remove their nomination after it's been posted in the voting thread, they should send a [message via modmail.](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2FPlaydate)

---

**Here's how VOTING works.**

---

- You will have approximately 36 hours to vote, with voting opening at 11:00 AM EST on Saturday and closing at 11:00 PM EST on Sunday. These times are not exact, but we will post a [Steam group notification](http://steamcommunity.com/groups/redditpd#announcements) when voting begins or you can check later in the day.
- To vote, simply visit the voting thread and upvote the games you want to play. You will only need to visit the voting thread once! Also, be sure to add comments if you have thoughts on a game. Negative comments are allowed if posted respectfully.
- After voting ends on Sunday, votes will be tallied and used to help pick the selection. Games are typically announced Monday or Tuesday evening. Remember, nominating opens soon after games are announced so if your entry wasn't chosen then, nominate it again! :)

---

**The fine print.**

---

For ease of explanation there are a few things I purposely left out.

- *Nominating closes right before voting begins, which is usually around 11:00 AM EST on Saturday morning. I'm not perfect though, so this time could vary by a few hours. Therefore, I think the best way to handle these inconsistencies is to encourage users to submit their nominations before 6:00 AM EST on Saturday, as I definitely won't close nominating/open voting before then! ... I probably won't even be awake before then. ;)
- The Steam notification for the nomination thread won't be posted until a day or so after it's posted in the subreddit -- think Thursday evening. The point of this is to encourage users to nominate on their own without needing to be notified, as the Steam notification serves as a reminder. Eventually it'd be nice if we could get a healthy amount of nominations each week without needing Steam notifications. (Note that there will be a Steam notification as soon as voting begins since the time window for that is much smaller.)

---

**TL;DR**

---

If you're confused, check out the tl;dr below!

- Nominating opens Wednesday - Friday for nominating and Saturday - Sunday for voting. There will be a big bold banner at the top of each nomination thread that states if nominating is open or closed (and the same for voting). Pay attention to it and you'll be fine!
- If you'd like to nominate a game, there will be a link in the sidebar. Click it and post your nomination in that thread. Make sure it follows all of the rules (listed in the thread) or it will be removed. At the end of the week, nominations will be transferred via bot into the voting thread.
- To vote, simply check the sidebar on Saturday at around 11:00 AM EST and look for a link. Then, upvote the games you'd like to play and add comments to help support your choices. The voting period will end Sunday at 11:00 PM EST or so unless stated otherwise. Votes will then be tallied and games will be announced on Monday or Tuesday evening.

We've had a League of Legends tournament before in the past [which was great fun!] and we'd love to have another one! So here's the information for our brand new, shiny tournament officially sponsored by Riot!

/r/Playdate is now hosting its second League of Legends tournament, this time with Riot prizes!

The tournament format is reverse draft, in which your team drafts champions for the other team and vice versa. Tournament format is double elimination, in which each team must lose twice in order to be kicked out of the tournament.

The tournament is held on the NA servers! For those of you playing in other regions, feel free to join us on a smurf account! We accept summoners of all levels in this tournament.

Registration begins on May 1st, 2012 and ends on May 26th. The tournament begins on Saturday, June 2nd and will run for one week, ending on Sunday, June 10th.

**PRIZES**

* 1st place: $15 RP + Triumphant Ryze + Champion Skin Bundle (whatever the next release will be) per player

* 2nd place: $15 RP

* 3rd place: $10 RP

* 4th place: $5 RP per player

**TIME INFORMATION**

Teams will be informed of their opponents each day via e-mail and Reddit PMs. Team captains are required to coordinate with one another to schedule matches.

* Round One will be played on June 2nd, 2012 EST. Teams will coordinate with one another with the help of a moderator if needed. Results must be submitted by 11:59 PM EST.

* Losers of Round One will compete in the loser’s bracket. Loser’s Round One, along with Winner’s Round Two will occur on June 3rd, 2012 EST. [This is a double elimination bracket if you're confused!](http://www.printyourbrackets.com/thumbs/8-Team-Double-Elimination.gif)

* Each round will be played at a subsequent date, depending on the number of teams signed up.

Remember, each team will play at least twice, so make sure your team is available!

**RULES**

The bracket will be monitored and run by me on BinaryBeast.com.

I will provide team captains with the opposing team's pool at least an hour before the scheduled match. I will also provide a list of the free champions that week.

1.  Bans and picks are done in champion select.
2. A team captain from each side will announce bans and picks. Blue team always bans first.
3. Each team is allowed 3 bans in a 1-1-1-1-1-1 format.
4. Upon finishing bans, team captains will pick a champion pool of 5 characters for the other team. Character pools MUST be submitted during team registration.
5. Pool selections will be done in a 1-2-2-2-2-1 format.
6. Teams may only play out of their given champion pool. They may swap champions within their their team as much as they please. If in accordance to [this comment](http://www.reddit.com/r/Playdate/comments/t2jer/announcement_riotsponsored_league_of_legends/c4jbwr6) one of your team members does not have a champion, then the opposing team is required to replace and reselect a champion. Teams must reselect as many champions as necessary until you have a viable pool for the opposing team.
7. The matches will be best of 1 until quarter/semi finals and the final round.
8. Results must be submitted to TourneyModFlaxx@gmail.com or to TourneyModFlaxx in game before we can update your BinaryBeast bracket standings. You can submit through an http://imgur.com screenshot of the end game statistics screen or by a League of Legends replay file. If results are not submitted by the end of the playing period, both teams are forfeit and disqualified from the tournament.

**SIGN UP**

* Sign up at [this spreadsheet here!](https://spreadsheets.google.com/spreadsheet/viewform?formkey=dERhTVNiOVd4ajNLZkl2UlZ1djVCUlE6MQ)

* Don't have a team? E-mail me your summoner name, Reddit username and e-mail and I can try to fit you on a team somewhere!

* All level players are allowed, however, each player must have a **minimum of 16 champions, including free champions.** Teams consist of 5 main players and 2 optional subs. 

* The form requires you to submit your team's summoner names, levels, and a method of contact. Your information will remain private and will only be used as a form of communication.

* In addition, champion pools of all your team members is required, including subs. The best way to do this is to play a ranked game and take 1-2 screenshots of your champion pool when your opponent team is banning. You may also have each of your members screenshot their champions or type them out in a list. Submit lists and screenshots to the appropriate section of the application form OR by e-mailing them to TourneyModFlaxx@gmail.com.

* **You may submit either ALL champions you own or 25 champions of your choice.**

Schedules and brackets will be revealed on May 30th. All team captains will be e-mailed and messaged on Reddit as a reminder.

Sorry for not putting up game info earlier this week. I will be out of town this weekend so I haven't really been sure what to do about Playdate. My internet connection will be spotty so even if I put up games I couldn't run nominating, voting, or manage focus times.

Therefore, I think the easiest and most foolproof thing to do would be to just push everything back a week. Meaning, games will be announced this Monday/Tuesday (2/11-12) and will be played next weekend (2/15-17). Hope this isn't too much of an inconvenience for everyone.

• There are seven days in a week, yet nine days of play-time per week. That will mean that the upcoming ""weeks"" will be staggered. So the next set of Playdates will begin on Monday and last through Tuesday. Which is fine, but it's a little weird, so I'm curious if I misunderstood the process.

It is in beta version right now and you have to pay a grand total of zero dollars and zero cents for online multiplayer. 

Download Page [Link (350 MB ish)](http://www.spocean.net/download/).

There are 3 classes, medic, engineer, and captain.

Engineer fixes holes, medic revives folks while the captain maneuvers the ship.

You fire different types of rounds (slow - damage, or fast - small damage) at the enemy ship in order to incapacitate some of their crew and their ship. Then once you disable the enemy ship, you board it and go face to face combat until they all drops dead.

*We are posting the voting thread early to give plenty of time for games to be nominated. However, the week does not reset until Monday, and thus the games of the week will remain the same until Monday.

**IT'S T-T-T-TIME TO VOTE!**

How it works:

* Nominate a game by posting in this thread, and/or upvote the games you'd like to play.
* Games will be selected based primarily on the amount of points they receive.
* We will be selecting three primary games and three alternates.
* The three primary games will be played all week, simultaneously.
* If a game is lacking activity, the mods will switch it with an alternate.
* There will be three dedicated focus times (one for each game), to be announced later in the week.

*As a reminder, the community is discouraged from nominating games that have been selected in recent weeks.*

**If you're nominating a game, please consider including the following in your nomination post:**

* Description of the game
* A link to the game's website or download page
* Supported platforms (Mac/Windows/Linux)
* Price (free or not)

Doing this is optional, but the more information you include in your nomination post the better chance of your nomination being upvoted.

Tonight's tournament was a very good attempt, even though it did not quite work. Some new ideas were tried and we ran into some unexpected problems. Fortunately, there's still a Bitfighter focus time tomorrow (7:00 PM - 12:00 AM EDT), and the sixth Big Bitfighter Battle!

---

What are the **Big Bitfighter Battles** (BBB)? These epic events are hosted by _k every two months, and usually result in at least 20 players. With Reddit participation, I think we can bring that number up to 30 at least!

**What**: An exciting night of blasting enemies! We'll play on dozens of maps across all game modes. 

**When**: Tomorrow. Friday, September 9, from 8:00 PM - 12:00 AM EDT. See table below for determining times.

**Where**: An official BBB server will be set up.

**Who**: Anybody can participate, and registration is not needed. EDIT: You are not required to stay the full duration.

**Prizes**: The person with the most team wins will get to choose a prize. On a team-based map, multiple people will get a win added to their score, and on a ffa-based map, only one person will get a win.

To view full rules and see a list of prizes, go to the link below:

**[OFFICIAL RULES](http://bitfighter.org/forums/viewtopic.php?f=20&amp;t=848)**

The games will be recorded and put on YouTube, and statistics will be posted when the winner is announced. Should you win, you will need a Bitfighter forums account to PM _k prize selection, although you may be able to [PM _k on Reddit](http://www.reddit.com/user/karamazovapy).

My brief summary of it's multiplayer mode.
&gt;""Online is pretty awesome, you essentially use your pilot for both single player and multiplayer which means you keep your ship, inventory and rank wherever you go. The servers are independently hosted but need to be authorized by the developer so there is only high quality reliable servers in the master server list. They are persistent worlds and clans can fight each other or do missions for favour in sectors for control of the sector which gives monetary gains. It's all very polished.""

Altitude is a fierce contest of ace vs ace, battling for supremacy of the skies in a fast paced combat that is way more fun than a flight simulator. It is a game of steely nerves, hair-trigger reflexes and brilliant tactical thinking. With five unique planes to choose from and an online community that will provide you with hours of entertainment, the game will stretch you to the limit from the upper reaches of the stratosphere and the relics of a long forgotten city, to within the deepest hollows of underground caverns. The sirens have sounded, bogies are coming in hot… jump into the fast and agile Loopy and drop your enemies from the sky with a tactical EMP blast - but get out of the way before your Biplane support tears them to pieces with 20mm cannons blazing! Barrel roll through the enemy minefield and arm your nuke as you enter the drop zone. There it is - the enemy base - but two Mirandas just warped in with lasers hot, and an Explodet is lumbering into position over its hangar deck — will you carry your team to victory?

Seeing a few people ask about it, it is a really fun game. I've played CS, Enemy Territory, TF2, BF1942, SOF2 and some others, so I'm not new to the FPS genre. This game focuses around completing objectives, such as steal some data, hack this, repair this. Each map has multiple objectives, accomplished by different classes. It's really focused around team work. If you enjoyed Enemy Territory, you will enjoy this game. Since it's only free this weekend, and it seems only Sunday is left open for voting, vote for it!

So I conjured up various events that can make Playdate become more active:

**Restart Playdate D&amp;D**

We had this idea a long time ago in Playdate and we actually managed to form a D&amp;D group, but after our practice run our DM bailed on us and since we didn’t know what we were doing... we couldn’t continue playing.  D&amp;D always interested me so I wanted to try and create another Playdate for it.  The main issue I see with this is getting a DM and what program we can use to play D&amp;D with, but the last thread had suggested a few we can choose from.

Old Thread - (http://www.reddit.com/r/Playdate/comments/kds7l/playdate_dd/)

**Unofficial CS Playdate**

Counterstrike: Source is a game that is always on sale and most people own it on steam, also the last Playdate we did on it was very successful and went on for a good while.  The Playdate will be held on Saturday at 3 PM EST.

**Bring back Dota 2 Mondays**

Since Dota 2 is getting really popular and there are many individuals who are new to this game I wanted to bring back Dota 2 Mondays.  Most of the users in TS3 usually play Dota 2 religiously so they can help the new peeps out and give them various tips about the game.  Like always I want to try to make this rage free and friendly as possible. Join us every Monday at 7 PM EST.

~~In the Playdate chat there have been many people who have been playing Awesomenauts so I thought about creating a tournament for it, however I need to figure out the amount of people interested in an Awesomenauts tournament, rules for one, what the prize will be, if Jom will approve of it, etc. etc.  Don’t get your hopes up too high for this one.~~

Anyone want to join me tonight in Battlefield 2142 and blow up a few Titans?

I'll be online around 7pm PST, and last night when I played (for 10 minutes for the first time in years) there was only one server called 'Titan Mayhem' or something along those lines.

Patch 1.51:
http://www.blackintel.org/firststrike/downloads


Feel free to recommend a server and I'll update this topic with the name. At least a 32 player map is appropriate.

While patch 1.51 downloads I'll be playing 1.5 on Titan Mayhem server. See you 1.51ers later on.

EDIT:
Not to leave you all in suspence my Lappy has BSODed twice tonight out of nowhere (hopefully just a corrupt stick of RAM), twice interupting my patch download, then my computer froze again just now right when I died playing patch 1.5. My audio got caught in a loop which just happened to be that bass-heavy 'your dead' heartbeat over and over and over again...

so that's 3 attempts at a 1.3gb patch, I'll give it a go again but I'll probably be on pretty late tonight.

On **Saturday, July 14** we will be playing the **Killing Floor** focus time, to be held at **8:00 PM Eastern (EDT)**. If you don't live on the US East Coast, check out the focus time section in the [Games Overview](http://redd.it/wb1ch) to determine when the focus time is in your area.

Neotokyo Start: 9pm GMT - 4pm EST. Neotokyo runs off the source engine so (I think you only need a source game to run it) There is a regular community Friday play so we may have to move to another server if it gets full. I think how we are going to do it is start off in a separate server just to see how many show up and if there is only a few we will move over to the community game. The way we will tell who is who is by adding a [r] or {r} tag in front of our names (It is on the old source engine so you don't need to change your steam name just your name in-game)

The event reminder will be in our steam group and we also have another reminder for [/r/Playdate](/r/Playdate)s event later too as age of chivalry is another great mod. If anyone is interested it is [here](http://steamcommunity.com/groups/rgamemods)

Description:
Neotokyo is a mod which is set in the near future heavily influenced by Ghost in the Shell both in some of the weapons and objectives (The ghost) but also the dystopian art style. The game could be comparable to css in its reliance on teamplay however the 3 different classes and the meticulous map design creates a much more tense and strategic environment.

I hope to see some of you there, it is good that there are two mod events on one day!

Note:

 *btw I realise this might be a bit early for some but as we are only small we try to get it so that there is a chance for both Euro + American timezones can play together, we will deffinately play past 5 and most work finishings. (It works better at the weekend but this event tonight ties in with the regular community game)*

Happy holidays! One of the challenges with scheduling events for a large community is that everybody has varying amounts of stress on various days. And we can't really do much about that without screwing over other people.

However, there is one area in the year in which stress levels are high for almost everyone -- the holiday season, which is set to begin very soon (or has already begun). Christmas/Hanukkah/Kwanzaa, New Year's, and festive parties may result in the next couple of weeks being slow in activity here in /r/Playdate. Or maybe it won't!

That's what we want to know. We want responses from you guys!

* How busy are the next two weeks looking for you?
* Will there be more, less, or no time to play games with us?
* Is there an abundance of real life activities or little/no change?
* Is the stress of real life events going to make playing games undesirable or desirable?
* What Steam game would you put on a wishlist for Santa?

Those are just some loose questions to get the ball rolling. Feel free to explain your situation by answering some or none of those questions!

The moderators are actively discussing creative workarounds to make the next couple of weeks fun and not stressful. This information will help us figure out what to do.

*Voting for next week, which usually begins today, is postponed and may be cancelled depending on what is decided. Please be patient -- we'll let you know.

Since our last [community bulletin posting](http://redd.it/14d61x) seemed to be a hit, we've decided to try it again. Playdate does not normally condone advertising, so this is a way for users to have their subreddits promoted in a method that we approve of. Let us know what you think about these posts and we might make it a regular thing!

In Community Bulletin, we briefly highlight a few neat subreddits that share our passion for well-connected communities. While these subreddits may not be directly related to our goals of organizing Redditor gaming sessions, they do have similar traits as us.

**/r/SoSE** is a gaming community that aims to coordinate frequent Sins of a Solar Empire matches. They have two upcoming sessions: Saturday 12/29 at 11:30 PM EST and Sunday 12/30 at 9:00 PM EST, and you can view more info/sign-up [in this thread.](http://redd.it/15i1tw)

Blast from the past! The subreddits below were developed and advertised on Playdate during our early days.

**/r/MinecraftWars** is an active Minecraft community that pits Redditor vs Redditor in glorious RTS-style combat.

**/r/GameMods** is a subreddit for discussing and organizing Redditor matches in modded games.

Players are assigned roles (captain, engineer, and a medic),  you need to load and fire cannons, repair damaged subsystems, all that shebang, while the captain is giving orders and steering the ship. When you finally manage to damage the enemy ship to the point it cannot run away from you, you need to fire grappling hooks at it and board it to kill their crew. 

We already played the game in a little 2v2 manner, and it was heaps fun. Ideally we'd like to play it in 6v6 setting. Even thought it's in beta, it is really playable and doesn't have any game-stopping bugs.

###IT'S T-T-TIME TO VOTE!

Planned Timeline FYI:

* Focus times for OpenRA and Section 8: Prejudice on Saturday and Sunday, respectively
* Voting closes 9 PM EST Sunday
* Games for the upcoming week announced late Sunday, server planning thread goes up
* GotW guide, focus time overview, individual discussion threads, and weekly wrap-up posted on Monday

*Read on if you'd like to know...*

##HOW THIS WORKS

* Nominate the game you'd like to play by posting in this thread (see rules below), and/or upvote the games you'd like to play!
* We will be selecting three games to play. Games will be selected based primarily on the amount of points they receive, but also on the response they receive (comments/discussion) and other factors.
* The three selected games will be played all next week, simultaneously.
* During the week, the mods may swap a game with an alternate game, chosen from this thread of nominations. Reasons for this to happen are little to no activity, or if another game is better suited for this week (ex. free-to-play weekend). Generally when this happens we will ask for approval from the community.
* There will be three dedicated ""focus times"" (one for each game) to help increase activity in the selected games. Focus Times are specific times set aside to play the chosen games. By playing just a couple of hours during a focus time, we can ensure that each game receives at least a little exposure and game time. Focus times are usually scheduled for 8:00 PM EST on Friday, Saturday, and Sunday. [See this post](http://www.reddit.com/r/Playdate/comments/mugsv/focus_times_overview_dec_24/c34g2j7?context=1) for more information on how focus times work.

##NOMINATE A GAME

**Please read and follow the rules below or your nomination WILL be considered invalid.** Failure to follow these rules will result in your nomination being revoked. Should this happen, you may re-submit your nomination in a new post that follows the proper rules.

**Nomination Qualifications:**

* The nominated game must have multiplayer capability and must be compatible with the computer.
* The nominated game cannot be one of the games that was played the previous week (these are: Tremulous, OpenRA, Section 8: Prejudice).
* There should be only one nomination per post.

**The following MUST be included in your nomination post for it to be considered valid!**

* A link to the game's website or download page
* List of supported platforms (specifically Mac/Windows/Linux)
* Price (specifically free or not free)
* A short description of the game (optional but encouraged, it doesn't need to be long).

*We require users to list a few game specifications for their nominations to be considered valid. The reason for this is for the convenience of our users and mods. If you want us to play your game, then you need to have the courtesy to list these specifications. Taking an extra minute to write a short description would also be helpful, but is not required.*

1312580821.0,20,self.Playdate,ja9jg,"Multi Theft Auto (PC, GTA:SA Multiplayer mod)",25,5,6,http://www.reddit.com/r/Playdate/comments/ja9jg/multi_theft_auto_pc_gtasa_multiplayer_mod/,"I'd like to ""nominate"" the excellent, but somewhat underutilized and misrepresented, open source multiplayer mod for Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas.

San Andreas is, by now, a slightly old game, but many people are still playing it - and the two online mods have, without a doubt, had much to do with that fact.

**What is MTA:SA?**

MTA:SA is an *open source* modification that aims to implement a full-blown multiplayer experience to the well-known game GTA:SA (and succeeds remarkably well), in which no such functionality originally exists. In addition to simply allowing players to play together in the same world, MTA provides an extremely rich scripting engine both server-side and client-side, allowing astounding amounts of gameplay variety. As a fun fact, I can also mention that MTA doesn't modify any game data, all modding happens ""live"" using memory modification.

**What can be done in it?**

Almost anything. Favorite gamemodes include pure deathmatch, team-based DM, role-play (up to so-called ""real life"" servers), racing, freeroaming, etc., but these don't really do justice to the scripting system. The possibilities are (and I say this knowing fully that it sounds like a cliché) nearly endless.

Setting up an MTA server is actually pretty easy, provided that you have somewhere to host it. The server runs under Unix and Windows, of course. Scripting follows a logical, relatively simple, and well-documented pattern.

**What's wrong with it?**

MTA's player base is, let's put it mildly, unimpressive at the moment. There's been a long-standing rivalry between this mod and a competitor, and due to certain... differences in opinion, the principial developer of the other one has a grudge towards MTA. The competition between the mods has never really been fair, and so one ended up with the sizeable community, while MTA got the short straw in that respect. 

At the moment, a lot of the player base is unable to communicate very well in English. Very large amounts of players seem to be based in Eastern Europe, Latin-America and Asia, and the communication is often hampered by language barriers. The English-speaking population seems mostly to be concentrated around role-playing, but... role playing isn't for everyone.

In addition to the lack of communication, there is also not as much variety in servers as there could be. This is something that I hope will solve itself, once more players and ""new blood"" enter the player base.

**What do I wish to accomplish?**

I've followed the GTA multiplayer scene for a while. I originally started with the previously mentioned competitor, but found my way to MTA soon enough, (although it wasn't easy\*) and was reeled in by its improved synchronization, gameplay and scripting features. After that, I spent some time playing and scripting, and I even ran my own fairly successful server at one point.

Since MTA has such incredible potential in the right hands, it's always pained me to see it go relatively unnoticed. That is why I want to bring this mod to Reddit's attention. I hope I can inspire people to at least give the mod a try. Maybe I'm even lucky enough to help revitalize or at least augment the player base a bit.

**Questions?**

Ask them in the comments. While I haven't been too active in MTA lately, I still think I will be able to answer most questions.

****TL;DR?****

MTA is a cool mod, bro. You should get GTA: San Andreas if you don't have it already, and [check it out](http://mtasa.com).

/u/srsbsnsman has graciously provided us with two license keys for [Payday: The Heist](http://store.steampowered.com/app/24240/) to give out. Please only participate in this giveaway if (a) you can ensure a successful install of the game (meaning no mac users, sorry!) and (b) plan to attend the focus time on Sunday, December 2nd at 8:00 PM EST.

I am thinking of a number between 0-500. It can be 0 or 500, and it is a whole number. (Therefore, only 501 possibilities exist.) **You are allowed one guess.** Simply post below!

The two individuals with the closest numbers will receive license keys. In case of a tie, [random.org](http://www.random.org/) will be used to determine the winner by simply tagging each affected person with a number and drawing from those numbers.

Cheating via duplicate entries or another method is uncool and grounds for disqualification. We reserve the right to disqualify users or cancel the giveaway should we suspect foul play.

You have until **Sunday, December 2nd at 11:00 AM EST** to enter the giveaway. Winners will be notified immediately afterward via Reddit PM. If you don't check your Reddit account often and would like to receive notification via an alternate method (ex. e-mail, steam), put that in your entry or [send us a modmail message.](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2FPlaydate) We cannot guarantee speedy notification through a method other than Reddit PM, but we will do our best.

Hi all,

While Thanksgiving will technically fall on a Thursday, the celebration is likely to carry into the weekend. We wouldn't be surprised to see a decline in activity due to family obligations... or, y'know, the Steam Thanksgiving/Black Friday sale. Last year's sale lasted five days and encompassed hundreds of sweet deals.

So instead of sticking to the normal routine, we've decided to leave this weekend open. You can play the games you buy, hang out with family, or just take a break. We'll be back on our normal schedule the week of Monday, November 26.

When the sale begins, we encourage you to use this thread to discuss participating games, post recommendations, and plan unofficial focus times. You can also talk about general Thanksgiving gaming.

Note that nominating games for the week of Monday, November 26 will take place in [this thread,](http://www.reddit.com/r/Playdate/comments/1385cz/nominate_what_do_you_want_to_play_for_the_week_of/) and it will remain open until Saturday, November 24 at ~11:00 AM EDT. Voting will begin immediately afterwards. This would be a great opportunity to nominate a game on sale -- especially considering we only have two entries right now! We will put a reminder when the deadline gets closer.

EDIT/UPDATE: Since there is some interest, we need to come up with a specific date to play. Best times are weeknights (although i'm a student so it's not ideal) or weekends during the day. Or we can just play whenever. here's my [Steam ID](http://steamcommunity.com/id/thezachster) to add me so we can organize these games.

##FOCUS TIME INFORMATION:

On **Friday, March 16** we will be playing the **Tribes: Ascend** focus time, to be held at **8:00 PM Eastern (EDT)**. If you don't live on the US East Coast, check out the focus time section in the [Games Overview](http://redd.it/qwko9) to determine when the focus time is in your area. Alternatively, view the [countdown](http://timeanddate.com/counters/customcounter.html?msg=Tribes+Ascend+Focus+Time&amp;month=03&amp;day=16&amp;year=2012&amp;hour=20&amp;min=00&amp;sec=00&amp;p0=179) to the focus time.

When 8:00 PM EDT on Friday rolls around, hop on our Steam chat ([direct link here](steam://friends/joinchat/103582791432297280))! If nobody's playing Tribes: Ascend, take the initiative and ask if anybody's up for a game.

* Tribes: Ascend does not apparently have dedicated servers, so instead just join the Steam chat during the focus time and you'll get divided up. :)

##HOW THIS WORKS

* Nominate the game you'd like to play by posting in this thread (see rules below), and/or upvote the games you'd like to play!
* We will be selecting three games to play. Games will be selected based primarily on the amount of points they receive, but also on the response they receive (comments/discussion) and other factors. What do we look for? Popularity in terms of points/comments/discussion, cross-platform compatibility, low pricing and easy to buy, variety of genres, whether it's been selected recently, etc.
* The three selected games will be played all next week, simultaneously.
* During the week, the mods may swap a game with an alternate game, chosen from this thread of nominations. Reasons for this to happen are little to no activity, or if another game is better suited for this week (ex. free-to-play weekend). Generally when this happens we will ask for approval from the community.
* There will be three dedicated ""focus times"" (one for each game) to help increase activity in the selected games. Focus Times are specific times set aside to play the chosen games. By playing just a couple of hours during a focus time, we can ensure that each game receives at least a little exposure and game time. Focus times are usually scheduled for 8:00 PM EST on Friday, Saturday, and Sunday. [See this post](http://www.reddit.com/r/Playdate/comments/mugsv/focus_times_overview_dec_24/c34g2j7?context=1) for more information on how focus times work.

**SAUERBRATEN'S FOCUS TIME WILL BE HELD SATURDAY (11/19) AT 8:00 PM EST. [DISCUSS FOCUS TIME HERE!](http://redd.it/mfel3)**

Utilizing the Cube engine, Sauerbraten is fast moving and quite simple to play. Even if you fail at FPS games, the element of speed allows you to run up, take the flag, and score without ever firing a shot -- although there will probably be some angry enemies chasing you. :)

One of the major differences I've noticed with other shooters is how Sauerbraten maps are like a massive jungle gym. I've never played an FPS where you can literally climb onto the buildings and fight on top of them... it's so much fun to see how high up you can get.

Features:

* Several unique and competitive game modes
* A variety of weapons, which you can use to propel yourself (think rocket jump from TF2)
* Numerous maps, most of which are simply gorgeous; you can actually climb onto and jump around on map structures as demonstrated in [this video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_3vWy9rbX4) 
* Fast-paced movement, supporting both casual and competitive players
* Simple UI and quick (!) loading times

**BLOODLINE CHAMPIONS'S FOCUS TIME WILL BE HELD SUNDAY (11/20) AT 8:00 PM EST. [DISCUSS FOCUS TIME HERE!](http://redd.it/mfeli)**

Bloodline Champions is a MOBA (Multiplayer Online Battle Arena) that is very unlike the more popular MOBAs, like Dota, LoL and HoN. The gameplay is reminiscent of classic arena maps out of StarCraft and Warcraft 3, and has most similarities with the World of Warcraft Arena. You have a champion with special abilities, but are not limited by Mana, but merely by cooldowns of each ability. Each champion available in the game is balanced with teamplay in mind, and thus teamplay is very important throughout the game.

Typically a match is a ""best of 5"" round, with each round lasting up to two minutes. This allows to casually play a match or two if you have some free time, and check out new champions without being stuck for 40 minutes in a match you might or might not win.

The game has a matchmaking system that *mostly* works when you want to battle against players of your own skill level, and the current daily champion rotation allows for players to check out new champions on a daily basis before settling down on one.

It is very fun once it gets going, though unforgivable very early on. The community is most of the time very helpful towards newcomers, so that shouldn't be a problem. We also have a 'reddit' channel ingame, where you can meet up with other redditors and play together.

Quake Live is available for *Mac, Windows, and Linux*. According to the Wikipedia entry, the supported browsers are: *Safari, Firefox, and Internet Explorer*. You must download a small plugin to play. The one downside to Quake Live is that it does not support third-party dedicated servers. Fortunately, there is a workaround: We can ""Friend"" each other, then invite everybody to a specific server.

Quake Live includes multiple game modes, mostly just classics like *Capture the Flag and Team Deathmatch*. Similar to previous Quake games, a variety of weapons and powerups are also available.

Description:

Solder is a free first/third person shooter with a wide variety of weapons and vehicles (land, sea and air) of all types that plays in a similar style as the Battlefield games.
Originally released a few years ago, this anticipated game was a mess of bugs and single player was marked with repetitive missions and hilariously bad AI. Since that time, through both official patches and community patches the multiplayer end of this game has been polished and is fun to play.
One of the key features of this game though is destruction of buildings and terrain. Oh, you want to barricade the front of your bass? Blow a hole in the ground with a tank or explosives. There's an enemy approaching the barricade... should he simple try and drive through it or does he decide to knock down some nearby trees for a makeshift bridge?
There are multiple modes in the game including Deathmatch, Conquest (control point capture), Capture the Flag, Capture the Vehicle and more set in a variety of maps.

Given that a lot of people may not be aware of what a mod is and how to take advantage of it, it may be to the community's advantage to have some content on the subreddit dedicated to guiding these people towards the awesome, free world of Source mods.

A Source mod is a collection of textures, models, sounds, scripts and code that runs on the Half-Life 2 engine. That engine's name is, appropriately, the Source engine. To allow the installation of a Source mod you must install the Source SDK. You can find it on your Steam client by following the following steps:

* Open the Steam window.
* Go to the Library.
* Change the list to Tools.
* Find and double-click on the Source SDK item.
* Read over the dialog box and click Download and Install / Next to continue
* The Source SDK will then be downloaded to your computer via Steam. 
* ([Link to Valve's How-to](http://developer.valvesoftware.com/wiki/SDK_Installation))

Most of the bigger Source mods out there are available on Steam under the Mod category, but there are other mods out there that you need to download directly from the developer's website. In those cases, if the dev team is worth their salt, there are usually instructions on the website.

Generally, you can run the mods as long as they do not mount content from a game you don't own. For example, if all you own is TF2, all you can play are total overhaul mods. If you buy a source game though, you get the source SDK base which includes models &amp; textures from Half-Life 2, but likely not maps or sounds.

It should be noted that an easy way to get the HL2 textures and models is by having an ATI video card. [Here's the details on this Steam offer](http://steampowered.com/ati_offer1a/). Suffice to say, free HL2:DM for people with ATI video cards.

[Here is a list of Source engine mods.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Source_engine_mods) (Incomplete, obviously.)

If anyone has issues with the installation or use of Source mods, I suggest using this thread as a centralized location for seeking help.

Cross-platform compatibility, low pricing and easiness to purchase, a fresh genre, whether it's been selected recently, etc. We always try to pick at least one cross-platform game and at least one free game (or one game that shares both elements).
* We encourage you to comment on a nomination if you have thoughts on that game. Negative comments are fine as long as they're not offensive. Commenting gives us a better perspective on why X game should or shouldn't be selected.

I would put it here but frankly this OP is long as it is.**

A disclaimer first, given the nature of this game(AKA, if you don't like trying games you won't fall in love with with 100% certainty, this will give you an idea of the problems you might face):
--
|=====|

Do not attempt to play it if your computer is underspecced, particularly your CPU and ram(under 4g and your dead in the water). If you aren't using a 64 bit Windows 7 you may also run into a problem with your computer not allowing use of your 4 gigs(there are ways around this, but some people don't like troubleshooting). [This is a decent place to find out if your fit for it.](http://www.systemrequirementslab.com/cyri/intro.aspx)


You might have the best gaming PC there is out there, but some people simply have issues. I luckily got rid of most of my performance issues simply by 'ending task' the VIVOX process every time i start the game(in game voice, is a joke due to a volume problem and no one uses it). This seems to be a good fix if your having performance issues and you feel your computer should be handling it.


This game is free to play but is generally not ""pay to win"". Closest thing to pay to win is you almost need premium if you play for less than 2 hours a week(premium gives much higher money rewards, so you can buy new weapons/ammo/cars/etc). That said all the best guns can be unlocked without ANY real world money, not to mention the starter gun is pretty kick ass. If you think you would play this game for 2-4 hours a week at least, you'll easily start moving up to different weapons and cars without spending a cent.

Learning curve is steep. Of the dozen or so people I've introduced to this game only one was more than useless for the first few hours of play. I will help, but you have to be willing to learn. I didn't have much help when I started out and It took me MONTHS to learn little tips that instantly made me a better player.

Community is often venomous. Avoid large clans, or at least ask me about them. I've come to learn a lot of the larger clans will get you plenty of teammates but make you feel crappy about it. That said I pug(pickup group) often and usually end up finding at least one other player that is fun to play with pretty quickly. Plus I'll be around! Think a mix of really awesome mature gamers mixed in with a decent amount of XBLA players-guess who is easier to see. If you look, you will find those awesome gamers.


Hacking is a problem, but people calling hacks is more common. The number of times a long term decent player is called out on hacking is usually in the dozens. There's also many situations where you might do something that seems impossible from the other end of the gun barrel, learning how it happened will make you a better player whereas claiming hacks immediately will make you a bad one.

|=====|

APB:Reloaded is a double edged sword of a game. At times I've had some of the best gaming experiences I've ever had playing it, at other times close to the worse. The key is to keep it fun and focus more on improvement than winning(sometimes you get dealt a baaaaad hand by the game). This is a good game for competitive people that can keep a cool head when they lose, even when it was out of their hands.

Its an awesome game for driving around, especially with/against others.

The gun mechanics, though strange at first, feels a little refreshing compared to most shooters. I personally love them now that I understand them fully.

It is a TPS, third person shooter. Some tactics and mechanics will sometimes feel very foreign to you if you only play FPS' like I did. Your probably going to feel your starter stuff is under powered when it is actually very up to par.

Heres a very good explanation of how a mission plays out, though note no car play happens in this mission. If you really like driving in games like this just keep in mind sometimes its not going to happen all the time.

I play on the US West(Colby) server. Note you cannot transfer characters between servers, but you have a choice regardless of your location. I know that many people in Europe that play on the US East server(or vice versa), which is much large a gap than playing on the West server if your somewhere on the east coast. I am also an Enforcer(AKA a vigilante). The major difference between criminals and enforcers is the criminals can 'ram raid'(an all but dead mechanic) while enforcers can use stun guns to arrest(a severely underpowered but fun mechanic). Other than that there are a couple faction-specific vehicles. If you want to play with me, make an Enforcer!

**For the upcoming week, we'll be reverting back to the normal schedule of choosing three games.**

##Planned Timeline:

* Focus time for King Arthur's Gold on Saturday at 8 PM EST
* **Voting closes Sunday at 9 PM EST**
* Games for the upcoming week announced late Sunday. Server planning thread, focus time overview, individual discussion threads, and weekly wrap-up go up late Sunday as well.
* Games-of-the-week guide goes up later in the week. I try to have this up on Monday, but class often gets in the way.

*Read on if you'd like to know...*

##HOW THIS WORKS

* Nominate the game you'd like to play by posting in this thread (see rules below), and/or upvote the games you'd like to play!
* We will be selecting three games to play. Games will be selected based primarily on the amount of points they receive, but also on the response they receive (comments/discussion) and other factors. What do we look for? Popularity in terms of points/comments/discussion, cross-platform compatibility, low pricing and easy to buy, variety of genres, whether it's been selected recently, etc.
* The three selected games will be played all next week, simultaneously.
* During the week, the mods may swap a game with an alternate game, chosen from this thread of nominations. Reasons for this to happen are little to no activity, or if another game is better suited for this week (ex. free-to-play weekend). Generally when this happens we will ask for approval from the community.
* There will be three dedicated ""focus times"" (one for each game) to help increase activity in the selected games. Focus Times are specific times set aside to play the chosen games. By playing just a couple of hours during a focus time, we can ensure that each game receives at least a little exposure and game time. Focus times are usually scheduled for 8:00 PM EST on Friday, Saturday, and Sunday. [See this post](http://www.reddit.com/r/Playdate/comments/mugsv/focus_times_overview_dec_24/c34g2j7?context=1) for more information on how focus times work.

##NOMINATE A GAME

**Please read and follow the rules below or your nomination WILL be considered invalid.** Failure to follow these rules will result in your nomination being revoked. Should this happen, you may re-submit your nomination in a new post that follows the proper rules.

**Nomination Qualifications:**

* The nominated game must have multiplayer capability and must be compatible with the computer.
* The nominated game cannot be one of the games that was played the previous week (these are: DEFCON and King Arthur's Gold).
* There should be only one nomination per post.

**The following MUST be included in your nomination post for it to be considered valid!**

* A link to the game's website or download page
* List of supported platforms (specifically Mac/Windows/Linux)
* Price (specifically free or not free)
* A short description of the game (optional but encouraged, it doesn't need to be long).

*We require users to list a few game specifications for their nominations to be considered valid. The reason for this is for the convenience of our users and mods. Writing a short description would also be helpful, but is not required.*

Wolfenstein: Enemy Territory is a downloadable, free-to-play multiplayer game in which players wage war as Axis or Allies in team-based combat. It's a team game; you will win or fall along with your comrades. The only way to complete the objectives that lead to victory is by cooperation, with each player covering their teammates and using their class special abilities in concert with the others.

Featuring multiplayer support for up to 32 players, Wolfenstein: Enemy Territory is the ultimate test of communication and teamwork on the battlefield. Players join the fray as one of five distinct character classes each with unique combat abilities. The Covert Ops can steal the uniforms of fallen enemies and perform covert reconnaissance behind enemy lines, while Engineers can plant and diffuse land mines as well as construct battlefield structures including bridges, guard towers and forward operations bases in the midst of combat to gain advantages for their team. Medics provide health and revive fallen teammates, as Field Ops use their binoculars to mark enemy positions for a Soldier's mortar barrage. Each Axis or Allies team can divide itself into smaller fire teams for quick and easy communication using an intuitive messaging system and dynamic command map of the entire battlefield.

1320981521.0,18,self.Playdate,m89jh,[ANNOUNCEMENT] | Notes on Giveaways,23,5,19,http://www.reddit.com/r/Playdate/comments/m89jh/announcement_notes_on_giveaways/,"Hey, you!

##READ THIS FIRST

This thread was created last year when there was a sudden influx of giveaways. At one point we had *six* ongoing giveaways! We didn't know exactly what to do, some didn't want to stop the generosity while others felt as though giveaways needed not to be part of this community. That's why this thread went up -- an attempt for us to create order for the massive amount of giveaways being posted.

However, the number of giveaways eventually slowed to a crawl, and there haven't been any recent giveaways in the past few weeks. Thus, most of the content in this thread is obsolete and doesn't really matter.

If you're interested in creating a giveaway of some kind for us, a) you're awesome and b) send us a message in [modmail](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%23Playdate) first, so we can work with you to make sure it's reasonable and awesome. If you have an idea on how you want to proceed, great, if you're clueless but still want to give to the community no worries! We can give you a few suggestions. :)

Alternatively, feel free to hop in the Steam Chat and do an impromptu giveaway! Or if you're just feeling generous in general, consider giving via /r/playitforward.

Thank you! I've kept the remaining post as archive material.

*April 10, 2012*

**To be clear, this isn't a ""rules"" thread.** These are suggestions to make your giveaway awesome. And if you want us to promote it you've got to give us at least a little bit of rope to work with.

Now, read on.

---

There have been a recent influx of giveaways, which is awesome and definitely not a bad thing, but I think it's important to understand a few things, especially if you're planning on creating your own giveaway:

* There are currently no special rules regarding giveaway creation. [SteamGifts.com](http://www.steamgifts.com/) seems to be the go-to platform for hosting giveaways, but if you know of an alternative method, go for it! You also don't have to follow the ""random"" method for giving away games. Feel free to be creative with it! You could think of a number between 1-100 and ask participants to name it. Closest wins (although that's kind of a lame method; I'm sure you could be more creative than me). Alternatively, if you want something more exciting, re-brand your giveaway as [CONTEST], and ask participants to do something fun or exciting for a chance to win. Reply with the word ponies if you're actually reading this.

* There is a difference between **exclusive** giveaways and **non-exclusive** giveaways. SteamGifts.com offers the ability to restrict your giveaway to a specific Steam group. If a giveaway is restricted to the Playdate Steam group, then that giveaway is considered exclusive. If a giveaway is not restricted to the Playdate Steam group, then that giveaway is considered non-exclusive. **You are welcome to create a thread and promote non-exclusive giveaways on your own, but we (mods) will only promote exclusive giveaways.**

*Note: The reason we won't promote giveaways that aren't exclusive to Playdate is partially because then there'd be way too many giveaways to promote, and partially because it's not fair to those who are already making their giveaways exclusive to Playdate.*

---

**Creating a Giveaway**

* Before creating a giveaway, consider what's already being given away. At the time of this posting, *six* copies of games are being given away. The more the merrier as they say, but the more giveaways going on at one time increases the probability of individual giveaways receiving less exposure. So, consider waiting until a lapse in giveaways to launch yours.

* Additionally, think carefully about how much time you'd like your giveaway to last for. We recommend between 2-5 days. Anything less than that and you run this risk of low exposure.

* When creating a giveaway, please be sure to **create a Reddit thread for it** as well. The reason for this is so that if anybody has questions or wants to discuss the giveaway, they can do so in that thread. **Also, be sure to include [GIVEAWAY] in brackets so that your thread shows up green!**

* Be sure to include the **exact closing time (day &amp; time &amp; timezone)** of your giveaway, even if you're using SteamGifts.com... they provide an approximate closing time but not an exact closing time, and we need the latter. This is really important!

* If you're making an exclusive giveaway, please **send a message to ALL of the mods** by using the [Moderator Mail](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%23Playdate). Include what game you're giving away, the exact closing day and time and timezone, and any special rules. You can send a message to the mods before or after creating your giveaway. You can also talk directly to an individual mod about your giveaway, but using the mod mail is very helpful: All of the mods can talk to you if necessary, and it logs for records/statistics.

* **The legal jargon:** Advertising is okay as long as it is minimal does not overshadow the giveaway. We should not have to use your site or product to enter the giveaway. SteamGifts.com is the exception. Additionally, giveaways with the intent of defamation, racism, brutalization of ponies, etc. are not allowed. Giveaways are checked on a case-by-case basis... if you think your giveaway might not be allowed, [send us a message](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%23Playdate) and we'll approve it or deny it. Playdate has the right to take down any giveaway at any time for any reason.

---

**tl;dr**

You are not required to use SteamGifts.com for creating giveaways. If you make your giveaway exclusive to /r/Playdate, we will promote it, otherwise not. When creating your giveaway be sure to create a Reddit thread for it, and include the exact date &amp; time &amp; timezone of closing. Send that information to the mods via Mod Mail.

edit1: Make sure you provide the timezone with the closing date &amp; time!

edit2: Made slight modifications to the last note, the ""message a mod"" note.

edit3: **To be clear, this isn't a ""rules"" thread.** These are **suggestions** that will make your giveaway awesome. And if you want us to promote it you've got to give us at least a little bit of rope to work with. The most important bits are creating a reddit thread for your giveaway, telling us the exact date/time (with your timezone) of closing, and sending a message to the moderators before or after the creation of your giveaway.

**Giveaways are great incentive for users to stay with Playdate. Thanks for supporting the community!**

edit4: Also, be sure to include [GIVEAWAY] in brackets so that your thread shows up green!

edit5: Added legal jargon.

edit6: Modified post, see top of page.

edit7: Made further modifications.

Every other month the native Bitfighter community hosts a spectacular event titled the ""**Big Bitfighter Battle**"", or ""**BBB**"" for short. We've had SIX of these events in the past and they have **ALL** been an absolute blast.

The seventh BBB runs for four hours, from **8:00 PM - 12:00 AM EDT**. Obviously, you do not have to stay for the entire time, but if you want to win a prize, you should stay for a while... wait, a prize?

Yup, the winner of the BBB will receive their choice of an **awesome prize**! To view the prize selection or learn how to win a prize, or if you would like to see more information, head on over to the Bitfighter forums: [**[Link]**](http://bitfighter.org/forums/viewtopic.php?f=20&amp;t=970)

The best part about the seventh BBB is that it aligns with Bitfighter's focus time. Both events will begin at 8:00 PM EDT. Just log onto Bitfighter and join the exclusive BBB server! Make sure to wear the {R} in your name so we know you're from /r/Playdate.

tl;dr: **Join us for a night of awesome on Friday, November 4th, from 8:00 PM to 12:00 AM EDT. Potentially win prizes!**

Thanks! Be sure to let me know if you have any questions. :)

I'm looking for people in nearby timezones and areas for some games due to ping. Borderlands 2, Battlefield 3 and Dungeon Defenders are pretty bad with people who are far away.

Some games (such as Civilization V) the area doesn't matter so much, but being online at the same time does. I've also found Castle Crashers and Saints Row 3 to not be too laggy when playing with someone far away.

This is a list of my multiplayer games:

---

Battlefield 3 (I have expansions, but just base game is fine too)

Left 4 Dead 2

Castle Crashers (almost finished normal mode, but stuck as using a magic character and facing magic resistant enemies)

Dungeon Defenders

Civilization IV Complete (Played a lot - still suck)

Civilization V + Gods and Kings (I'm a new player - only 12 hours logged)

Borderlands 2 (I'm pretty low level)

Saints Row 3

Command and Conquer Red Alert 3

Dead Island

Portal 2

Terraria

Worms Reloaded

1. Let's be mature and treat each other fair.
2. We'll split the gear up fairly
3. We'll be different toons, and have variety. (One Mechromancer, One Zer0, One Siren, One Commando, or One Gunzerker.
4. I won't touch these toons unless we're together on this. I'll try to be on reguarly, too.
5. Mics are completely optional, but it'd definately help!

##HOW THIS WORKS

---

* Nominate the game you'd like to play by posting in this thread (see rules below), and/or upvote the games you'd like to play! You choose the menu on this subreddit.
* We will be selecting three games to play. Games will be selected based primarily on the amount of upvotes they receive, but also on the response they receive (comments/discussion) and other factors. What else do we look for? Cross-platform compatibility, low pricing and easiness to purchase, a fresh genre, whether it's been selected recently, etc. We always try to pick at least one cross-platform game and at least one free game (or one game that shares both).
* We encourage you to comment on a nomination if you have thoughts on that game. Negative comments are fine as long as they're not offensive. Commenting gives us a better perspective on why X game should or shouldn't be selected. Also, [don't downvote, ok?](http://www.reddit.com/r/Playdate/comments/mugsv/focus_times_overview_dec_24/c34g2j7)
* The three selected games will be played all next week (see thread title for dates), simultaneously.
* During the week, the mods may swap a game with an alternate game, chosen from this thread of nominations. Reasons for this to happen are little to no activity, or if another game is better suited for this week (ex. free-to-play weekend). Generally when this happens we will ask for approval from the community.
* There will be three dedicated ""focus times"" (one for each game) to help increase activity in the selected games. Focus Times are specific times set aside to play the chosen games. By playing just a couple of hours during a focus time, we can ensure that each game receives at least a little exposure and game time. Focus times are usually scheduled for 8:00 PM EDT on Friday, Saturday, and Sunday. [See this post](http://www.reddit.com/r/Playdate/comments/mugsv/focus_times_overview_dec_24/c34g2j7?context=1) for more information on how focus times work.

* The nominated game must have multiplayer capability and must be compatible with the computer. And other common sense that I hope I don't have to list here, like if the game isn't released until mid-week, it won't be considered a valid nomination.
* The nominated game cannot be one of the games that is currently being played (these are: DEFCON, Revenge of the Cats: Ethernet, Mount &amp; Blade: Warband). You may nominate a game played the previous week, but it is highly unlikely to be chosen due to variety preferences.
* You may nominate up to THREE games. There should be only one nomination per post.

**The following MUST be included in your nomination post for it to be considered valid!**

* A link to the game's website or product page
* List of supported platforms (specifically Mac/Windows/Linux)
* Price (specifically free or not free)
* A short description of the game (optional but encouraged, it doesn't need to be long).

*We require users to list a few game specifications for their nominations to be considered valid. The reason for this is for the convenience of our users and mods. Writing a short description would also be helpful, but is not required.*

##HOW THIS WORKS

---

* Nominate the game you'd like to play by posting in this thread (see rules below), and/or upvote the games you'd like to play! You choose the menu on this subreddit.
* We will be selecting three games to play. Games will be selected based primarily on the amount of upvotes they receive, but also on the response they receive (comments/discussion) and other factors. What else do we look for? Cross-platform compatibility, low pricing and easiness to purchase, a fresh genre, whether it's been selected recently, etc. We always try to pick at least one cross-platform game and at least one free game (or one game that shares both).
* The three selected games will be played all next week (see thread title for dates), simultaneously.
* During the week, the mods may swap a game with an alternate game, chosen from this thread of nominations. Reasons for this to happen are little to no activity, or if another game is better suited for this week (ex. free-to-play weekend). Generally when this happens we will ask for approval from the community.
* There will be three dedicated ""focus times"" (one for each game) to help increase activity in the selected games. Focus Times are specific times set aside to play the chosen games. By playing just a couple of hours during a focus time, we can ensure that each game receives at least a little exposure and game time. Focus times are usually scheduled for 8:00 PM EDT on Friday, Saturday, and Sunday. [See this post](http://www.reddit.com/r/Playdate/comments/mugsv/focus_times_overview_dec_24/c34g2j7?context=1) for more information on how focus times work.

*We are posting the voting thread early to give plenty of time for games to be nominated. However, the week does not reset until Monday, and thus the games of the week will remain the same until Monday. We are still going to be playing the [Xonotic Focus Time](http://www.reddit.com/r/Playdate/comments/muhdg/focus_times_xonotic_dec_3/) tonight (12/03) and the [Lead &amp; Gold Focus Time](http://www.reddit.com/r/Playdate/comments/muh8k/focus_times_lead_gold_dec_4/) tomorrow (12/04)!*

*Minor edits have been made to this voting page, namely clarification of the ""swapping a game"" bullet point, and the ""focus time"" bullet point. Additionally, some text has been re-positioned in order to make it clearer that not following the nomination rules will result in ~~death~~ mauling by tigers.*

---

**How it works:**

* Nominate the game you'd like to play by posting in this thread (see rules below), and/or upvote the games you'd like to play!
* We will be selecting three games to play. Games will be selected based primarily on the amount of points they receive.
* The three selected games will be played all next week, simultaneously.
* During the week, the mods may swap a game with an alternate game, chosen from this thread of nominations. Reasons for this to happen are little to no activity, or if another game is better suited for this week (ex. free-to-play weekend). Generally when this happens we will ask for approval from the community.
* There will be three dedicated ""focus times"" (one for each game) to help increase activity in the selected games. Focus Times are specific times set aside to play the chosen games. By playing just a couple of hours during a focus time, we can ensure that each game receives at least a little exposure and game time. Focus times are usually scheduled for 8:00 PM EST on Friday, Saturday, and Sunday. [See this post](http://www.reddit.com/r/Playdate/comments/mugsv/focus_times_overview_dec_24/c34g2j7?context=1) for more information on how focus times work.

**Please read the text below very carefully and thoroughly or your nomination will be considered invalid.**

**Nomination Rules:**

* Games must have multiplayer capability and must be compatible with the computer.
* Games that have been played this week may not be nominated for next week (these are: Terraria, Xonotic, and Lead &amp; Gold).
* Also...

**... The following » » MUST « « be included in your nomination for it to be considered valid!**

* A link to the game's website or download page
* List of supported platforms (specifically Mac/Windows/Linux)
* Price (specifically free or not free)
* A description of the game (optional but encouraged, it doesn't need to be long).

*We require users to list a few game specifications for their nominations to be considered valid. The reason for this is for the convenience of our users and mods. Taking an extra minute to write a short description would also be helpful, but is not required.*

**Voting will close Sunday, December 4 at 9:00 PM EST.**

Voting may be extended if this thread does not receive enough participation (nominations and/or votes).

* **What?** According to [Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NeoTokyo_(video_game\)), it ""uses a round-based structure similar to Counter-Strike, in which gameplay takes place in a series of several rounds. When a player dies in-game, they must wait for the beginning of the next round before being able to play again. The game is class-based, with three classes available, each with slightly different characteristics, abilities, and available weaponry. NEOTOKYO° has two gametypes: team-based deathmatch, in which the team that manages to kill all members of the opposing team wins, and ""Capture The Ghost"", though the majority of maps are designed for the latter mode. This gametype has the two teams competing to capture a randomly-spawned objective item, the ""Ghost"", by picking it up and carrying it to a designated location on the other side of the map. It is generally similar to capture the flag, except that either team can win by eliminating the enemy, as well as that the Ghost allows the player holding it to see the locations of opposing team members through walls, at the expense of wielding a weapon. The Ghost and any player holding it can be seen as a blip from any location on the map.""

* **How?** This mod is completely **free**. In order to play it, you need a [Source engine game](http://store.steampowered.com/search/?category2=16) like Half-Life 2 or Team Fortress 2. Download the patch [**here**](http://www.neotokyohq.com/download.html).

Wow, am I glad I found this place! I am looking to start a brand-new campaign on BL2. Never played it before, so other new-ish types happily welcome. 

I don't own BL1 but have played it before, if BL2 teamwork goes well, then I'll happily consider buying other co-ops like the original Borderlands, Dead Island, Left4Dead etc to branch out into! 

I'll happily game with guys and girls alike, I'm dead friendly and I prefer mic-chat because trying to form a co-op strategy when you can't talk with your team-mates is reaaaaallly hard. Also I'm a chatterbox. 

I'll be gaming mainly weekday evenings (after 7pm) and pretty much all weekend. If you're interested in co-op, drop me a PM with your Steam ID and I'll get back to you.

Cheers,

The first is Auf Wiedersehen Petrovic - winning one of each multiplayer game type. Sounds kind of long and annoying, but whatever.

The second is reaching rank 10. Which is also kind of long and annoying.

But honestly I just miss GTA IV multiplayer, playing stuff like the Hangman's NOOSE game was super fun and I always enjoyed that.

So if anyone's game let me know.

Also co-op is possible with just two people, I remember there being some strategy to finish the level in less than 5 minutes too. But the more the merrier!

Another note regarding **time zones** - I have the week off work next week.

This information has also been posted to our Steam Group Events Calendar. [**Check it out!**](http://steamcommunity.com/groups/redditpd/events/)

Live elsewhere in the US? Check the table below for focus times in your area:

International? Find your [timezone](http://www.worldtimezone.com/), then count to find the time gap. For example, we know EDT is UTC-4, so if you lived in UTC+9, that'd be a 13 hour time difference and the focus times would be at 9 AM your time.

* Have the ability and desire to host a server? [Message us](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=%2Fr%2FPlaydate) or post a comment with the server details! We'll publicize it and credit you and love you forever. Servers should be password-protected if possible.
* Have suggestions for the best maps, server settings, etc for a game? Comment and let us know!
* Know of a fun, normally empty public server we could use if we can't secure an exclusive server? Post it!

3. If nominating is closed, then voting must be open, so go VOTE! Check the front page of /r/Playdate for the voting thread.

##NOMINATION RULES

---

**Please read and follow the rules below or your nomination WILL be considered invalid.** Failure to follow these rules will result in your nomination being revoked. Should this happen, you may re-submit your nomination in a new post that follows the proper rules, or edit the current post. If the cut-off for the nomination phase arrives and your nomination is still invalid, it will be excluded from that round of voting and you will need to wait for the nomination phase to re-open, then create a new post.

**Nomination Qualifications:**

* The nominated game must have multiplayer capability and must be compatible with the computer. And other common sense that I hope I don't have to list here, like if the game isn't released until midway through the week, it won't be considered a valid nomination for the upcoming voting phase.
* The nominated game cannot be one of the games that is currently being played. You may nominate a game played the previous week, but it is highly unlikely to be chosen due to variety preferences.
* You may nominate up to THREE games per week. You may stack multiple nominations per post.

**The following MUST be included in your nomination for it to be considered valid!**

* A link to the game's website or product page
* List of supported platforms (specifically Mac/Windows/Linux)
* Price (specifically free or not free)
* A short description of the game (optional but encouraged, it doesn't need to be long).

*We require users to list a few game specifications for their nominations to be considered valid. The reason for this is for the convenience of our users and mods.

##HOW THIS WORKS

---

* Nominate the game you'd like to play by posting in this thread (see rules below), and/or upvote the games you'd like to play! You choose the menu on this subreddit.
* We will be selecting three games to play. Games will be selected based primarily on the amount of upvotes they receive, but also on the response they receive (comments/discussion) and other factors. What else do we look for? Cross-platform compatibility, low pricing and easiness to purchase, a fresh genre, whether it's been selected recently, etc. We always try to pick at least one cross-platform game and at least one free game (or one game that shares both).
* We encourage you to comment on a nomination if you have thoughts on that game. Negative comments are fine as long as they're not offensive. Commenting gives us a better perspective on why X game should or shouldn't be selected. Also, [don't downvote, ok?](http://www.reddit.com/r/Playdate/comments/mugsv/focus_times_overview_dec_24/c34g2j7)
* The three selected games will be played all next week (see thread title for dates), simultaneously.
* During the week, the mods may swap a game with an alternate game, chosen from this thread of nominations. Reasons for this to happen are little to no activity, or if another game is better suited for this week (ex. free-to-play weekend). Generally when this happens we will ask for approval from the community.
* There will be three dedicated ""focus times"" (one for each game) to help increase activity in the selected games. Focus Times are specific times set aside to play the chosen games. By playing just a couple of hours during a focus time, we can ensure that each game receives at least a little exposure and game time. Focus times are usually scheduled for 8:00 PM EDT on Friday, Saturday, and Sunday. [See this post](http://www.reddit.com/r/Playdate/comments/mugsv/focus_times_overview_dec_24/c34g2j7?context=1) for more information on how focus times work.

This information has also been posted to our Steam Group Events Calendar. [**Check it out!**](http://steamcommunity.com/groups/redditpd/events/)

Don't live on the US East Coast but live in the US? Check the table below for focus times in your area:

Timezone|Focus Time

  UTC / GMT|12:00 AM
  Eastern (EDT)|8:00 PM
  Central (CDT)|7:00 PM
  Mountain (MDT)|6:00 PM
  Pacific (PDT)|5:00 PM

International? Find your [timezone](http://www.worldtimezone.com/), then count to find the time gap. For example, we know EDT is 4 hours behind UTC, so if you lived in UTC+2, that'd be a 6 hour time difference and the focus times would be at 2 AM your time.

**Server Planning**

---

If you've ever wanted to help the mods, now's your chance! We'd like to have servers up for each focus time, but it'd be even better if servers could be up for part of or all of the week.

Do you...

* Have the skill, means, and desire to host a server? *Note: Servers should be password-protected if possible.*
* Have experience within one or more of these games and can offer suggestions on the best maps, server settings, etc?
* Know of some good public servers should we be unable to host our own?

If you said yes to any bullet point, please post in this thread. We could really use your wisdom!

The max number allowed by the game is 16 players, and if anyone has the OLDSKOOL mod for Unreal Tournament that allows classic Unreal gameplay, I can add that mutator into gameplay. I have a Teamspeak server set up to play, so if anyone is interested comment here and I shall publicly give the teamspeak server location once I have a balanced number of players to go!
So, anyone interested? I operate the teamspeak server between 12 pm and 2 am GMT. TS3 Server IP is NOW 77.97.229.78:2350 since my host is unreliable and I need to host it myself locally.

When games are being selected, there are often some amount of nominations that have already been played at some point in the past, and it is extremely helpful to be able to look back and see how those games were during that week. This info allows us to essentially predict (more or less) how a repeated nomination would work.

For example, if a number of users collectively agreed that game A had a gradual learning curve and funny animations, we might be more inclined to pick game A again during a period of large growth (where we would want to attract new users). On the other hand, if a number of users collectively agreed that game B was buggy and had an evil development team, we might put that one aside during the period of growth (although we'd check out the game environment first to see if it's changed).

This is also why I ask users to post their *experiences*, as those are traditionally more descriptive and extensive than a mere ""this game was fun"". However, posting something is better than nothing, so by all means please do not hesitate to post even a single sentence! Thanks!

Last week we played:

* Cards Against Humanity ([Focus Time](http://redd.it/ulk2f) on Friday, June 08)
* The Ship ([Focus Time](http://redd.it/ulk89) on Saturday, June 09)
* Starcraft 2 ([Focus Time](http://redd.it/ulkee) on Sunday, June 10)

Now we want to hear about your experiences, good or bad. Write on anything that happened last week! Were the focus times a success, or an epic fail? Did you have technical difficulty with a game? What did you think of the various giveaways created this week?

You can be as descriptive as you'd like. Even just a couple of sentences is fine, but the more thorough you are the better we can do our jobs! Also, if you have any screenshots or video, upload it! We will use this information to determine what works and what doesn't so please be honest, descriptive, and extensive. And no, we're not just saying that, we mean it. Your advice has given us ideas that we have actually implemented with great results.

**Without your vital observations and suggestions, we cannot reasonably expect to improve Playdate.**

*Read on if you'd like to know...*

##HOW THIS WORKS

* Nominate the game you'd like to play by posting in this thread (see rules below), and/or upvote the games you'd like to play!
* We will be selecting ~~three~~ two games to play. Games will be selected based primarily on the amount of points they receive, but also on the response they receive (comments/discussion) and other factors. What do we look for? Popularity in terms of points/comments/discussion, cross-platform compatibility, low pricing and easy to buy, variety of genres, whether it's been selected recently, etc.
* The ~~three~~ two selected games will be played all next week, simultaneously.
* During the week, the mods may swap a game with an alternate game, chosen from this thread of nominations. Reasons for this to happen are little to no activity, or if another game is better suited for this week (ex. free-to-play weekend). Generally when this happens we will ask for approval from the community.
* There will be ~~three~~ dedicated ""focus times"" (one for each game) to help increase activity in the selected games. Focus Times are specific times set aside to play the chosen games. By playing just a couple of hours during a focus time, we can ensure that each game receives at least a little exposure and game time. Focus times are usually scheduled for 8:00 PM EST on Friday, Saturday, and Sunday. [See this post](http://www.reddit.com/r/Playdate/comments/mugsv/focus_times_overview_dec_24/c34g2j7?context=1) for more information on how focus times work. **Note: As only two games are being picked this week, there will be no focus time on Sunday.**

---

*Read on if you want to...*

##NOMINATE A GAME

**Please read and follow the rules below or your nomination WILL be considered invalid.** Failure to follow these rules will result in your nomination being revoked. Should this happen, you may re-submit your nomination in a new post that follows the proper rules.

**Nomination Qualifications:**

* The nominated game must have multiplayer capability and must be compatible with the computer.
* The nominated game cannot be one of the games that was played the previous week (these are: Tribes: Ascend, Armagetron Advanced, Trine 2).
* There should be only one nomination per post.

**The following MUST be included in your nomination post for it to be considered valid!**

* A link to the game's website or download page
* List of supported platforms (specifically Mac/Windows/Linux)
* Price (specifically free or not free)
* A short description of the game (optional but encouraged, it doesn't need to be long).

*We require users to list a few game specifications for their nominations to be considered valid. The reason for this is for the convenience of our users and mods. Writing a short description would also be helpful, but is not required.*

---

*But wait, Sunday is taken by the...*

##SUPERBOWL

Considering the Superbowl's massive impact, we wouldn't be surprised if the traditional focus time on Sunday was empty. The moderators have discussed a variety of options but ultimately have decided to make this week a light week, officially selecting TWO games instead of three. The focus times of each of these games will be on Friday and Saturday.

To make up for the lack of a third game, we will be hosting our own special **Superbowl Playdate Party!** We're 10x as cool as your extended family, so chill with us! If that's not enough motivation, we'll be holding a super awesome contest with fun prizes. A detailed thread will go out later in the week when the date gets closer.

Just can't wait for the party? See if you can find and nominate a football-related game for us to play during the upcoming week!

tl;dr: Two games picked this week instead of three, two focus times on Friday and Saturday, with a Superbowl themed Playdate Party on Sunday.

**IT'S T-T-T-TIME TO VOTE!**

How it works:

* Nominate a MULTIPLAYER game by posting in this thread, and/or upvote the games you'd like to play.
* Games will be selected based primarily on the amount of points they receive.
* We will be selecting three primary games and three alternates.
* The three primary games will be played all week, simultaneously.
* If a game is lacking activity, the mods will switch it with an alternate.
* There will be three dedicated focus times (one for each game), to be announced later in the week.

*As a reminder, the community is discouraged from nominating games that have been selected in recent weeks.*

**If you're nominating a game, please consider including the following in your nomination post:**

* Description of the game
* A link to the game's website or download page
* Supported platforms (Mac/Windows/Linux)
* Price (free or not)

Doing this is optional, but the more information you include in your nomination post the better chance of your nomination being upvoted.

Description:

Zero-K is a real-time-strategy game focused on large sprawling bases, huge swarms of units, and physics/simulation-oriented combat. Fans of the Total Annihilation and Supreme Commander series' should feel right at home. The game gives you a massive variety of units and combat options from the first moment of play. If you want to take the micro-management out of RTS gaming and take it to a larger scale, without losing the ability to control every individual unit in your army, this is the game for you.

*Battlefield 1942 generally costs $3-6 for a Windows license, and $20+ for a Mac license. :/

Description:

Battlefield 1942 is that classic FPS that started it all for the WWII genre of games. A game such as it had never been seen before with such great characteristics of vehicular gameplay, teamwork, and all around fun. While the game is obviously dying out...there are those few hundred (around 500-900) that play almost everyday. BF1942 is no longer about competition as it was back in the day, and is now focused more on fun. If you want a game unlike any others on the market in this period of time BF1942 is the way to go as it offers a little something for everyone.

If you like firing artillery and helping your teammates from the background there is that, or sniping. If you are more of a close up and personal kind of guy you have tanks, jeeps, apc's, and obviously foot soldiers.
If there was ever a time to try BF1942...this is it, go see what everyone is raving about before it is gone.

Every game begins at **8PM EDT** on its day and continues until people stumble to bed. 

* Tonight, become a [Zombie Master](http://youtu.be/6Q98DorwN_Q). This free Source mod (by this point we all have the necessary ingredients for source mods, right?) preceded Left 4 Dead and pits your team of human players in poorly-lit FPS environments and has them survive against a single zombie master, also human, who has a horde of zombies and traps that he controls as an evil commander. But I basically pinched this description from s1n1337, so read his instead!

  *""Holy fuck, this game is so fun... There's one guy (the zombie master) who controls the undead in an RTS fashion, spawning them and moving them around to set up ambushes. He also can manipulate parts of the environment, make bridges collapse, turn off lights, it all depends on how good the map is. The survivors have an objective to do, with each map is different, sometimes it's to get to the end of the map, and other times it's to gather items, (usually it's a bit of both). Every time a survivor reaches a 'checkpoint' the Zombie Master unlocks new zombies to deploy. Keep in mind that he can't deploy all zombies anywhere, and that he has a limited number of resources, so strategy is key!""*

  Zombie master is **free** and you can [download here](http://www.zombiemaster.org/files.php)


* Friday we all become...Xonoticalists...ummm. We play [Xonotic!](http://youtu.be/VaNtj7Kom-A?hd=1) This Quake throwback has fast-paced gameplay and simplified bunny-hopping. I basically pinched this description from s1n1337 (again), so read his instead: 

  *Xonotic is a great Quake like game made by the developers of Nexuiz. The only thing they've changed is the movement system. They have made it radically easier to move around, no more strafe jumping or bunny hopping anger. All you have to do is hold down your jump key and voila! Stress free bunny hopping! **[Here's](http://youtu.be/5SZgyP-0C0Q?hd=1)** a great video(tutorial) that shows off the simple side, and more advanced side of getting around in this game*

  Like all the games this week, Xonotic is **free.** [Download here](http://www.xonotic.org/download/)


* Saturday night, we will [climax](http://youtu.be/Bwsb5kvpPTc?hd=1) with Urban Terror. Several people have been playing the game all week, and say it's incredibly fun. It has an extremely passionate community. According to Jomskylark: *""Urban Terror is a free, online-multiplayer FPS. Very popular and is available for Mac, Windows, and Linux. Features include seven game modes, wall-jumping, quick radio chat, crouch &amp; slide, and some fantastic maps. It has been suggested three times on this sub-reddit already, so there's definitely some community interest.""*

##CLOSED! DO NOT NOMINATE!

**Note: Please do not comment on nominations** unless it is super important. You will have your chance in the voting thread. :)

---

**Active Experiments:**

* Playdate Recycling: Nominations from the previous week that weren't selected officially are added automatically to the line-up. Please nominate as you normally would however.
* Easy Nominating: You may skip adding the typical nomination requirements like supported platorms and price etc. **Only the game name is necessary!** You can add the other stuff if you want but it is not essential. Before voting begins a moderator will insert that extra info into nominations so nobody will be at a disadvantage if they choose to leave the info out.

**Nomination Qualifications:**

* The nominated game must have multiplayer capability and must be compatible with the computer. And other common sense that I hope I don't have to list here, like if the game isn't released until midway through the weekend, it won't be considered a valid nomination for the upcoming voting phase.
* The nominated game cannot be one of the games that is currently being played. You may nominate a game played the previous weekend, but it is highly unlikely to be chosen due to variety preferences.
* You may nominate up to THREE games per week. You may stack multiple nominations per post.

*We require users to list a few game specifications for their nominations to be considered valid. The reason for this is for the convenience of our users and mods. Writing a short description would be helpful, but is not required.*

##GAME INFORMATION

---

* Name: Trouble in Terrorist Town
* Platform: Windows, Mac
* Price: Free, sort of. To play TTT you will need both [Garry's Mod](http://store.steampowered.com/app/4000/) ($9.99) and [Counter-Strike: Source](http://store.steampowered.com/app/240/) ($19.99). You can get both together for [$24.99.](http://store.steampowered.com/sub/219/) The mod itself is free. **You may be able to get away without CS:S by using [this site's downloads.](http://cscheater.era.ee/)** Thanks /u/s3rris!
* Play via [Website](http://ttt.badking.net/)
* Check out this game's subreddit: /r/ttt
* Description below is from the website. Also see the [nomination.](http://www.reddit.com/r/Playdate/comments/1937j1/voting_game_selection_for_the_weekend_of_friday/c8kd8mc)

&gt;The game is about a group of ""terrorists"" who have traitors among them, out to kill everyone who's not a traitor. A small number of players is selected as Traitors, who have to kill all the Innocent players (ie. the rest of the players). Those innocents know they are in the majority, but they do not know who is Traitor and who is not.

&gt;The Traitors must use the element of surprise and their special equipment, if they are to succeed. The Innocent just have to survive, which means finding out who the Traitors are and killing them before they kill you. Of course everyone is holding a big gun, and everyone looks suspicious...

I have been playing for almost a month now so I have most of the basics down and I really enjoy the game. What I hate about the game though is that it is really hard to find people who are not total douches when it comes to play with them in the game. I understand that everyone likes to win but at the end of the day its a game, and its about having fun. 

So with that being said, if you are new to DOTA 2 and want somebody to play with who will help you and not bring you down, add me on steam. And if you are an experienced player, even better! I want to find people who will help me improve my skills at a game that seems to have such a crazy Learning curve!

Don't live on the US East Coast but live in the US? Check the table below for focus times in your area:

  UTC / GMT|12:00 AM

  Central (CDT)|7:00 PM
  Mountain (MDT)|6:00 PM

International? Find your [timezone](http://www.worldtimezone.com/), then count to find the time gap. For example, we know EDT is 4 hours behind UTC, so if you lived in UTC+2, that'd be a 6 hour time difference and the focus times would be at 2 AM your time.

Head's up! The voting deadline has now been extended two hours to 11:00 PM EDT! This will likely be a permanent change, allowing nominations to flourish for a longer period of time!

Please don't hesitate to comment if you have thoughts on a game. Even negative comments are fine as long as they're not offensive. Commenting gives us a better perspective on why X game should or should not be selected.

Also, be sure to check back frequently throughout the voting period for new nominations.

*IT'S T-T-T-TIME TO VOTE!*

##Planned Timeline

---

* Focus times for Serious Sam HD: The First Encounter on Saturday at 8:00 PM EDT and League of Legends on Sunday at 8:00 PM EDT.
* **Voting closes Sunday at 9 PM EDT!**
* Weekly wrap-up goes up late Sunday.
* Games announced sometime on Monday. Server planning thread and individual discussion threads go up then as well.

---

*Read on if you'd like to know...*

##HOW THIS WORKS

---

* Nominate the game you'd like to play by posting in this thread (see rules below), and/or upvote the games you'd like to play! You choose the menu on this subreddit.
* We will be selecting three games to play. Games will be selected based primarily on the amount of upvotes they receive, but also on the response they receive (comments/discussion) and other factors. What else do we look for? Cross-platform compatibility, low pricing and easiness to purchase, a fresh genre, whether it's been selected recently, etc. We always try to pick at least one cross-platform game and at least one free game (or one game that shares both).
* The three selected games will be played all next week (see thread title for dates), simultaneously.
* During the week, the mods may swap a game with an alternate game, chosen from this thread of nominations. Reasons for this to happen are little to no activity, or if another game is better suited for this week (ex. free-to-play weekend). Generally when this happens we will ask for approval from the community.
* There will be three dedicated ""focus times"" (one for each game) to help increase activity in the selected games. Focus Times are specific times set aside to play the chosen games. By playing just a couple of hours during a focus time, we can ensure that each game receives at least a little exposure and game time. Focus times are usually scheduled for 8:00 PM EDT on Friday, Saturday, and Sunday. [See this post](http://www.reddit.com/r/Playdate/comments/mugsv/focus_times_overview_dec_24/c34g2j7?context=1) for more information on how focus times work.

##NOMINATE A GAME

---

**Please read and follow the rules below or your nomination WILL be considered invalid.** Failure to follow these rules will result in your nomination being revoked. Should this happen, you may re-submit your nomination in a new post that follows the proper rules, or edit the current post.

**Nomination Qualifications:**

* The nominated game must have multiplayer capability and must be compatible with the computer. And other common sense that I hope I don't have to list here, like if the game isn't released until mid-week, it won't be considered a valid nomination.
* The nominated game cannot be one of the games that is currently being played (these are: Portal 2, Serious Sam HD: The First Encounter, League of Legends). You may nominate a game played the previous week, but it is highly unlikely to be chosen due to variety preferences.
* You may nominate up to THREE games. There should be only one nomination per post.

**The following MUST be included in your nomination post for it to be considered valid!**

* A link to the game's website or product page
* List of supported platforms (specifically Mac/Windows/Linux)
* Price (specifically free or not free)
* A short description of the game (optional but encouraged, it doesn't need to be long).

*We require users to list a few game specifications for their nominations to be considered valid. The reason for this is for the convenience of our users and mods. Writing a short description would also be helpful, but is not required.*

Top voted comment by 12 PM EST on November 17th will be the game I purchase for the giveaway. The only two rules is that the game has to be at most $10 (I want to support the subreddit, but I'm not the most financially secure person) and there should be co-op or multiplayer capability.

http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561197965602081

I dont play GW2 anymore, and Diablo 3 sucked, but i do consistently play WoW, LoL, and random Steam games.

Im not an elitest, but i do prefer you're good at a game. My WoW guild is pretty much pure pvp, and mostly 2200+ rated players, i dont mind with playing with people who arent amazing, but i dont enjoy playing with terrible players.

That goes especially with LoL, i was gold in season 2, then let my elo decay to 1400 and stopped playing. Season 3 im going for high plat, if im lucky/ really learn the game, maybe diamond. Again, ALL my RL friends, minus one, are bronze plate heroes. They suck, and they at least know it. If you are a bronze or silver plate hero, thats fine, but dont claim its elo hell. If you think you're in elo hell, dont bother leaving an ign, i wont add you. Im fine with somebody who realizes they're doing something wrong, and want to correct it. I cant stand people who blame their team and others, if you ever want to rank up, and become better, you need to look inwards to better yourself.

I grew up playing shitloads of DaoC, Diablo 2: LOD, CS 1.4/1.5/1.6 and some Source, WoW, etc.

Im 28 as stated before, so i would like to game with fellow adults. Nothing against youngsters, but i simply will have more in common with somebody who works for a living, has a significant other, and is from the same time period growing up.

I get so bored wandering around by myself. I build awesome cities and giant houses....that nobody lives in but me.


So I said screw it and decided to create a small 5 person server to hopefully share with some redditors. I'm hoping to make some friends and not just entertain the occasional passer by, or end up being the host for you and your posse. So if that's all you have in mind, please keep moving. 


Here's a little bit about me, and what I would find ideal in my match(es).


~I am a 27 year old married woman. I would highly prefer to play with other adults.


~I am a night owl and I tend to be on in the late afternoon all the way to the break of dawn. 
Someone who has a similar schedule would be nice so that we can actually play together.


~I'm a very outspoken person. If you're shy and quiet then this may not be the right server for you. I hope to get to know the people I play with so that eventually we can become friends.


Note: My server will only be connected when we're logging in to play a session or when I'm working on fixing the place up. I just don't have the capabilities to run it 24/7. If its not active, feel free to invite me to play. You bring the companionship, and I'll bring the server. =)

Torchlight 2: Brand new

Guild Wars 2: Level 80 close to 100%.  Not as willing to start a new character.  Depends on how reliably I could play with other people.

DotA 2: I'm still climbing the cliff that comprises the learning cliff.  I tend to be good at MOBAs in general though.

International? Find your [timezone](http://www.worldtimezone.com/), then count to find the time gap. For example, we know EDT is 4 hours behind UTC, so if you lived in UTC+2, that'd be a 6 hour time difference and the focus times would be at 2 AM your time.

##HOW THIS WORKS

---

* Nominate the game you'd like to play by posting in this thread (see rules below), and/or upvote the games you'd like to play! You choose the menu on this subreddit.
* We will be selecting three games to play. Games will be selected based primarily on the amount of upvotes they receive, but also on the response they receive (comments/discussion) and other factors. What else do we look for? Cross-platform compatibility, low pricing and easiness to purchase, a fresh genre, whether it's been selected recently, etc. We always try to pick at least one cross-platform game and at least one free game (or one game that shares both).
* We encourage you to comment on a nomination if you have thoughts on that game. Negative comments are fine as long as they're not offensive. Commenting gives us a better perspective on why X game should or shouldn't be selected. Also, [don't downvote, ok?](http://www.reddit.com/r/Playdate/comments/mugsv/focus_times_overview_dec_24/c34g2j7)
* The three selected games will be played all next week (see thread title for dates), simultaneously.
* During the week, the mods may swap a game with an alternate game, chosen from this thread of nominations. Reasons for this to happen are little to no activity, or if another game is better suited for this week (ex. free-to-play weekend). Generally when this happens we will ask for approval from the community.
* There will be three dedicated ""focus times"" (one for each game) to help increase activity in the selected games. Focus Times are specific times set aside to play the chosen games. By playing just a couple of hours during a focus time, we can ensure that each game receives at least a little exposure and game time. Focus times are usually scheduled for 8:00 PM EDT on Friday, Saturday, and Sunday. [See this post](http://www.reddit.com/r/Playdate/comments/mugsv/focus_times_overview_dec_24/c34g2j7?context=1) for more information on how focus times work.

##NOMINATE A GAME

---

**Please read and follow the rules below or your nomination WILL be considered invalid.** Failure to follow these rules will result in your nomination being revoked. Should this happen, you may re-submit your nomination in a new post that follows the proper rules, or edit the current post.

**Nomination Qualifications:**

* The nominated game must have multiplayer capability and must be compatible with the computer. And other common sense that I hope I don't have to list here, like if the game isn't released until mid-week, it won't be considered a valid nomination.
* The nominated game cannot be one of the games that is currently being played (these are: Toribash, Trouble in Terrorist Town, Killing Floor). You may nominate a game played the previous week, but it is highly unlikely to be chosen due to variety preferences.
* You may nominate up to THREE games. There should be only one nomination per post.

**The following MUST be included in your nomination post for it to be considered valid!**

* A link to the game's website or product page
* List of supported platforms (specifically Mac/Windows/Linux)
* Price (specifically free or not free)
* A short description of the game (optional but encouraged, it doesn't need to be long).

*We require users to list a few game specifications for their nominations to be considered valid. The reason for this is for the convenience of our users and mods. Writing a short description would also be helpful, but is not required.*

*Get your votes in soon, because...*

##Voting will close Sunday, June 17 at 11:00 PM EDT.

##FOCUS TIME INFORMATION

On **Sunday, June 17** we will be playing the **Killing Floor** focus time, to be held at **8:00 PM Eastern (EDT)**. If you don't live on the US East Coast, check out the focus time section in the [Games Overview](http://redd.it/uzcfm) to determine when the focus time is in your area. Alternatively, view the [countdown](http://timeanddate.com/counters/customcounter.html?msg=Killing+Floor+Focus+Time&amp;month=06&amp;day=17&amp;year=2012&amp;hour=20&amp;min=00&amp;sec=00&amp;p0=179) to the focus time.

When 8:00 PM EDT on Sunday rolls around, hop on our Steam chat ([direct link here](steam://friends/joinchat/103582791432297280))! If nobody's playing Killing Floor, take the initiative and ask if anybody's up for a game.

##Planned Timeline

---

* Focus times for StarMade on Saturday at 8:00 PM EDT and Killing Floor on Sunday at 8:00 PM EDT

* Weekly wrap-up goes up late Sunday.
* Games announced sometime on Monday. Server planning thread and individual discussion threads go up then as well.

##HOW THIS WORKS

---

* Nominate the game you'd like to play by posting in this thread (see rules below), and/or upvote the games you'd like to play! You choose the menu on this subreddit.
* We will be selecting three games to play. Games will be selected based primarily on the amount of upvotes they receive, but also on the response they receive (comments/discussion) and other factors. What else do we look for? Cross-platform compatibility, low pricing and easiness to purchase, a fresh genre, whether it's been selected recently, etc. We always try to pick at least one cross-platform game and at least one free game (or one game that shares both).
* The three selected games will be played all next week (see thread title for dates), simultaneously.
* During the week, the mods may swap a game with an alternate game, chosen from this thread of nominations. Reasons for this to happen are little to no activity, or if another game is better suited for this week (ex. free-to-play weekend). Generally when this happens we will ask for approval from the community.
* There will be three dedicated ""focus times"" (one for each game) to help increase activity in the selected games. Focus Times are specific times set aside to play the chosen games. By playing just a couple of hours during a focus time, we can ensure that each game receives at least a little exposure and game time. Focus times are usually scheduled for 8:00 PM EDT on Friday, Saturday, and Sunday. [See this post](http://www.reddit.com/r/Playdate/comments/mugsv/focus_times_overview_dec_24/c34g2j7?context=1) for more information on how focus times work.

##NOMINATE A GAME

---

**Please read and follow the rules below or your nomination WILL be considered invalid.** Failure to follow these rules will result in your nomination being revoked. Should this happen, you may re-submit your nomination in a new post that follows the proper rules, or edit the current post.

**Nomination Qualifications:**

* The nominated game must have multiplayer capability and must be compatible with the computer. And other common sense that I hope I don't have to list here, like if the game isn't released until mid-week, it won't be considered a valid nomination.
* The nominated game cannot be one of the games that is currently being played (these are: Battlefront 2, StarMade, Killing Floor). You can nominate a game played the previous week, but it is highly unlikely to be chosen due to variety preferences.
* You may nominate up to THREE games. There should be only one nomination per post.

**The following MUST be included in your nomination post for it to be considered valid!**

* A link to the game's website or product page
* List of supported platforms (specifically Mac/Windows/Linux)
* Price (specifically free or not free)
* A short description of the game (optional but encouraged, it doesn't need to be long).

*We require users to list a few game specifications for their nominations to be considered valid. The reason for this is for the convenience of our users and mods. Writing a short description would also be helpful, but is not required.*

##Voting will close Sunday, April 08 at 9:00 PM EDT.

Now we want to hear about your experiences, good or bad. Write on anything that happened last week! Were the focus times a success, or an epic fail? Did you have technical difficulty with a game? What did you think of the various giveaways created this week?

You can be as descriptive as you'd like. Even just a couple of sentences is fine, but the more thorough you are the better we can do our jobs! Also, if you have any screenshots or video, upload it! We will use this information to determine what works and what doesn't so please be honest, descriptive, and extensive. And no, we're not just saying that, we mean it. Your advice has given us ideas that we have actually implemented with great results.

There is a discussion the recently began in steamchat on how to improve Playdate further because although it has come far it is still messy and could use reform.

Some ideas include a website which would require an incentive to bring people in, a couple games to play for a full month and one or two weekly, more organized servers as well as dedicated ones for the monthly games or Playdate in general, and a better way to get people to participate in voting or Playdates in general.

Although those are a few ideas it takes the help of many Playdate users besides the few of us in chat currently discussing this.  That's where this thread comes in.

We want to have a Playdatewide discussion on how to make Playdate great and improve it in any way possible so please contribute your ideas or criticism here and help the mods and everyone in general have a better and overall more fun time on r/Playdate.

This combined with planned updates would've resulted in one awesome week, with a fantastic focus time!

Unfortunately, the Free-to-Play Weekend has been [re-scheduled for December 15-19](http://steamcommunity.com/games/nucleardawn/announcements/detail/1083343716599215402) (thanks to boisson for the tip), which is a little over two weeks away.

At this point, we have a couple of options:

**Option A** -- Postpone Nuclear Dawn as official Game of the Week. This option would guarantee Nuclear Dawn a spot in the week of December 12-18, but it would be removed as an *official* GotW this week. Obviously you could still play it as an unofficial GotW.

[Xonotic](http://www.xonotic.org/download/) (which received the next highest amount of votes) would replace Nuclear Dawn. Xonotic is free and cross-platform, so that's a plus.

**Option B** -- Do nothing. Those who have bought Nuclear Dawn can play it, and Nuclear Dawn can be nominated again in two weeks. However, the new nomination would need to receive a LOT of votes to secure a spot, as we rarely select games that have been played within the past few weeks.

**Option C** - Get together a team of operatives to go and kidnap the entire Steamworks staff and order them to push the F2P weekend back to when it was normally planned, and also steal a copy of Half-Life 3. Right.

**What do you think?** Personally I like ~~Option C~~ Option A, but I want to hear your thoughts on the matter. Let's aim to reach some kind of decision by late evening, so don't wait to post.

**Please read the below very carefully and thoroughly or your nomination will be considered invalid.**

**How it works:**

* Nominate the game you'd like to play by posting in this thread (see rules below), and/or upvote the games you'd like to play!
* We will be selecting three games to play. Games will be selected based primarily on the amount of points they receive.
* The three selected games will be played all next week, simultaneously.
* During the week, if a game is lacking community activity, the mods may swap it with an alternate game, chosen from this thread of nominations.
* There will be three dedicated ""focus times"" (one for each game) to help increase activity in the selected games. Focus Times are specific times set aside to play the chosen games. By playing just a couple of hours during a focus time, we can ensure that each game receives at least a little exposure and game time. Focus times are usually scheduled for 8:00 PM EST on Friday, Saturday, and Sunday, but be sure to look for our announcement for concrete times.

**Nomination Rules:**

* Games must have multiplayer capability and must be compatible with the computer.
* Games that have been played this week may not be nominated for next week (these are: Altitude, Warsow, and Team Fortress 2).
* Also...

**... The following MUST be included in your nomination for it to be valid!**

* A link to the game's website or download page
* List of supported platforms (specifically Mac/Windows/Linux)
* Price (specifically free or not free)
* A description of the game (optional but encouraged, it doesn't need to be long).

*We require users to list a few game specifications for their nominations to be considered valid. The reason for this is for the convenience of our users and mods. Taking an extra minute to write a short description would also be helpful, but is not required.*

*NOTE: This is a separate giveaway from the two Skyrim giveaways.*

Here at Playdate we like doing giveaways, so here we are giving away a giveaway. Yeah, that made no sense.

This particular giveaway focuses on **Bitfighter**, one of this week's featured games.

As you may or may not know, the native Bitfighter community hosts a ""**Big Bitfighter Battle**"" every other month. These epic Battles run for four hours in length (!) and feature dozens of quality maps. At the end of the Battle, the player with the most match wins is rewarded a prize from the Battle organizer. Prizes include a backlit gaming keyboard, universal gaming headset, and more. View all prizes [here](http://bitfighter.org/forums/viewtopic.php?f=20&amp;t=970).

Tonight, we're invited to the seventh Big Bitfighter Battle, and we wanted to add our own spin. Thus, the Playdate mods will also be rewarding a prize! The **Redditor** with the most match wins will receive a **$10 in Steam games** -- they choose! If the top player in the entire Battle happens to be a Redditor, that person will take home two prizes (one from Playdate and one from the organizer)!

**Instructions**

* [Download](http://bitfighter.org/downloads) and launch Bitfighter. It is free and cross-platform.
* When choosing a username, be sure to include {R} or [R] in it.
* Between **8:00 PM and 12:00 AM EDT TONIGHT (11/4)**, join the Big Bitfighter Battle (BBB) server. Play for as long or as short as you'd like. The more you play, the better chance you'll have of winning.
* The Redditor with the most match wins in that time will receive $10 in Steam games, complimentary of the Playdate mods.

**Rules**

* We will be following all Big Bitfighter Battle rules. [**Check out their ruleset here**](http://bitfighter.org/forums/viewtopic.php?f=20&amp;t=970).
* The seventh Big Bitfighter Battle runs from 8:00 PM EDT - 12:00 AM EDT. You are not required to stay for the full duration, but the longer you stay increases your chances of winning more matches.
* You must wear {R} or [R] in your name to be entered.
* The Redditor that receives the highest score (aka most match wins) according to the Big Bitfighter Battle organizer will win $10 USD in Steam games, complimentary of the Playdate staff. You can choose one $10 game, or two $5 games, or one $4 game and two $3 games, etc. You do not have to take the full $10 in games. The $10 must be sent through Steam.
* If a tie occurs, each party will receive $5 in games.
* We (the Playdate staff) have the right to disqualify any entrant for any reason at any time especially if rainbows are involved. In other words, as long as you don't cheat you'll be fine.

Let me know if you have any questions. My Bitfighter username is ""sky_lark"". Let's blast some bits (erm, ships)!!

Thanks to Gwnynzer there's a compiled list of correct bf2142 patches here, along with the FS downloads: http://www.blackintel.org/firststrike/downloads

It can be hell trying to DL the right 1.51 patch for bf2142 because they haven't bothered updating their own forum which states final release of 1.51 in a thread and it isn't the final release!

*****

**Installation/Troubleshooting Guides:** (Hopefully you won't need these as the setup is pretty simple but..) This guide is helpful although it is outdated as you need 1.51 of bf2142 not 1.50. http://forums.fsmod.com/viewtopic.php?id=9938

This may also be quite useful- http://firststrikemod.wikia.com/wiki/Troubleshooting#First_Troubleshooting_Step

There are other threads in here - http://forums.fsmod.com/viewforum.php?id=21

One of the biggest problems is a visual bug in space maps, you have to set your view distance to 100% if this happens to you.

If you crash or bug out at launch you probably have the wrong version of 2142 or you need to set your exe to widescreen, how to resolve this is in your first strike launcher you go to file, preferences and in the arguments box paste ""+widescreen 1"" (without the """")

**TO DOWNLOAD**, use [this mediafire link](http://www.mediafire.com/?oygghirwziw) rather than the download from ModDB, which is outdated.

Yes, despite the dual references to the Source engine, this is a Half-Life 1 mod. So then, why name the mod this way? Humor.  

This is one of the funniest mods I've ever played. Several joke weapons that serve a specific purpose, humorous character models, funny voice acting and just a large sense of ""WTF?"" It's got more weapons than you can handle, ""diving"" which lets you dive in any direction you aim in, throwable chainsaws and much more.  

However, amidst all the laughable guns and taunts and funny happenings, there are some *fantastic* game modes which are the cream of this game's crop. The 3 of those are:  
  
* Snake vs Monkey  
    In this game mode, 1 player is Solid Snake (yeah) and must sneak past the other team of monkeys from Ape Escape (yeah) in order to reach the Kerotan frog doll and win the match. Very fun stuff.  
  
* Real Snake vs Monkey  
    Rather than sneaking, the player who is Solid Snake must survive for a period of time against the Monkeys, who can only punch.  

* Battle Royale  
    Named after the movie/manga series, each player starts with a different, randomized weapon. To obtain better weapons, you must kill your opponents. Last man standing is the winner.  
  

If that isn't enough to convince you, watch the trailer for better convincing.

##VOTING RULES

---

* Games have already been nominated, so simply upvote the ones you'd like to play! You help choose the menu on this subreddit.
* We will be selecting three games to play. Games will be selected based primarily on the amount of upvotes they receive, but also on the response they receive (comments/discussion) and other factors. What else do we look for? Cross-platform compatibility, low pricing and easiness to purchase, a fresh genre, whether it's been selected recently, etc. We always try to pick at least one cross-platform game and at least one free game (or one game that shares both elements).
* We encourage you to comment on a nomination if you have thoughts on that game. Negative comments are fine as long as they're not offensive. Commenting gives us a better perspective on why X game should or shouldn't be selected. Also, [don't downvote, ok?](http://www.reddit.com/r/Playdate/comments/mugsv/focus_times_overview_dec_24/c34g2j7)

Tribes: Ascend's focus time had a little promotion which hopefully brought in more players; I'm really curious to know how this one went.

Anything you can write would be appreciated... thanks!

We hope you've had an awesome week!

This week we played:

* Sanctum ([Focus Time](http://redd.it/11loe1) on Friday, October 19)
* Mount &amp; Blade: Warband ([Focus Time](http://redd.it/11lorr) on Saturday, October 20)
* Tribes: Ascend ([Focus Time](http://redd.it/11lpaj) on Sunday, October 21)

Now we want to hear about your experiences, good or bad. Write on anything that happened last week! Were the focus times a success, or an epic fail? Did you have technical difficulty with a game? What did you think of the various giveaways created this week?

You can be as descriptive as you'd like. Even just a couple of sentences is fine, but the more thorough you are the better we can do our jobs! Also, if you have any screenshots or video, upload it! We will use this information to determine what works and what doesn't so please be honest, descriptive, and extensive. And no, we're not just saying that, we mean it. Your advice has given us ideas that we have actually implemented with great results.

**Without your vital observations and suggestions, we cannot reasonably expect to improve Playdate.**

No, really. In fact, [see here](http://redd.it/uvseh) for some insight into why it's so important!

It's like a combo of Company of Heroes / Supreme Commander / Men of War.  There is no base building, units have a value and you are given xx number of points to spend throughout the match...  

 One of the coolest aspects (and kinda bad at first) is that you earn stars for playing the campaign and multiplayer.  Those stars allow you to unlock units.  And with those unlocked units, you build a 'deck' of units that you take into multiplayer.

You can get a Russian copy for $20 that activates on Steam and you can convert it to English following the guide on the site.

##HOW THIS WORKS

---

* Nominate the game you'd like to play by posting in this thread (see rules below), and/or upvote the games you'd like to play! You choose the menu on this subreddit.
* We will be selecting three games to play. Games will be selected based primarily on the amount of upvotes they receive, but also on the response they receive (comments/discussion) and other factors. What else do we look for? Cross-platform compatibility, low pricing and easiness to purchase, a fresh genre, whether it's been selected recently, etc. We always try to pick at least one cross-platform game and at least one free game (or one game that shares both).
* The three selected games will be played all next week (see thread title for dates), simultaneously.
* During the week, the mods may swap a game with an alternate game, chosen from this thread of nominations. Reasons for this to happen are little to no activity, or if another game is better suited for this week (ex. free-to-play weekend). Generally when this happens we will ask for approval from the community.
* There will be three dedicated ""focus times"" (one for each game) to help increase activity in the selected games. Focus Times are specific times set aside to play the chosen games. By playing just a couple of hours during a focus time, we can ensure that each game receives at least a little exposure and game time. Focus times are usually scheduled for 8:00 PM EDT on Friday, Saturday, and Sunday. [See this post](http://www.reddit.com/r/Playdate/comments/mugsv/focus_times_overview_dec_24/c34g2j7?context=1) for more information on how focus times work.

##NOMINATE A GAME

---

**Please read and follow the rules below or your nomination WILL be considered invalid.** Failure to follow these rules will result in your nomination being revoked. Should this happen, you may re-submit your nomination in a new post that follows the proper rules, or edit the current post.

**Nomination Qualifications:**

* The nominated game must have multiplayer capability and must be compatible with the computer. And other common sense that I hope I don't have to list here, like if the game isn't released until mid-week, it won't be considered a valid nomination.
* The nominated game cannot be one of the games that is currently being played (these are: Altitude, Subspace, Runescape). You can nominate a game played the previous week, but it is highly unlikely to be chosen due to variety preferences.
* You may nominate up to THREE games. There should be only one nomination per post.

**The following MUST be included in your nomination post for it to be considered valid!**

* A link to the game's website or product page
* List of supported platforms (specifically Mac/Windows/Linux)
* Price (specifically free or not free)
* A short description of the game (optional but encouraged, it doesn't need to be long).

*We require users to list a few game specifications for their nominations to be considered valid. The reason for this is for the convenience of our users and mods. Writing a short description would also be helpful, but is not required.*

---

*Get your votes in soon, because...*

##Voting will close Sunday, April 01 at 9:00 PM EDT. And no, that's not an April Fool's joke! :P

Voting may be extended if this thread does not receive enough participation (nominations and/or votes).

edit: A nice variety of nominations! However, please don't hesitate to comment if you've got thoughts on a game. Good or bad comments are fine just so long as they're not offensive. Commenting gives us a better understanding of why X game should or should not be played.

Hope you're having a good weekend! We wanted to briefly inform you of two important issues and our responses: Giveaways and attacks.

---

**GIVEAWAYS**

We [recently revealed](http://redd.it/n0bfn) that we were aware of the complaints surrounding Steam notifications and were prepared to take action to lessen notifications. In that thread, multiple users complained about the existence of giveaways, and after much discussion here is what we are willing to do:

We will continue to allow you awesome people to make giveaways, but due to popular demand we will no longer be creating standalone Steam notifications for these giveaways.* However, giveaways will be linked in the sidebar like normal, and possibly promoted elsewhere (such as the Steam chat or in the body of other Steam announcements).

We firmly remain of the opinion that giveaways have a positive impact on this great community. We think that giveaways promote bonding and generosity, and giveaways often tie-in to community events.

**There may be rare exceptions to this rule.*

---

**ATTACKS**

The second thing we wanted to discuss was the environment in the Steam chat and other areas of the community. Playdate is a gaming community, and we pride ourselves on being social and friendly. However, various events have caused us worry.

Over the past few months we have received a small number of complaints regarding excessive trolling and the like within the Steam chat and other areas of the community. Now, we're a laid back bunch, so we're not going to go censor-nazi perma-ban for the smallest things. But there is a line. Personal attacks and excessive trolling against non-consenting individuals are unacceptable. And no, this is not something that we're just going to say and blow it off. Should an event of this arise, you will be warned and potentially receive a temporary ban. We are not going to tolerate our members being threatened, bullied, or excessively trolled.

Once again, we're not going to go overboard on this, but we will keep our eyes open. We're not banning trolling, if both parties are joking around and having a good time we'll keep back.

**What to do if you're being attacked:** First ask politely for it to stop, and make it clear that you're not joking. If it continues talk to a moderator or send us a message via moderator mail. You won't be treated as a snitch, there's no shame in seeking help. We'll keep your name anonymous, investigate the situation, and take proper action.

If a moderator is doing the attacking then send a message to different moderator and not through mod mail.

---

**tl;dr:** Giveaways will be allowed, but for the most part there'll be no more Steam notifications for giveaways. Personal attacks, bullying, threatening, etc. against individuals will not be tolerated and should you be guilty of this, we may take action against you.

That's all we've got for now. Let us know what you think! We're always open for ideas and suggestions.

Have a great weekend, and we hope to see some of you in [tonight's focus time](http://redd.it/n28iy) -- Soldner: Secret Wars! Begins 8:00 PM EST.

You also show me tons of great games when I look through the game suggestions for the GotW.


As such I'd like to enlist the help of r/playdate! My friends are having a LAN party for my brother next Saturday and I'd like to change it up a bit.

Instead of having the same-old lan party games (which we all love) I'd like to spice it up with some other games. Especially free ones since that way theres no convincing people to buy stuff.

So what would you guys suggest?

**tl;dr- You guys are awesome! What are some good free games for a lan party?**

EDIT:
Info on people/games

We've got 2 gaming rigs
3 other desktops
3 laptops
Either Mac or PC, but everyone can use Windows 7 in some shape or form.

Games we'd normally play:

Counter-Strike 1.6
Halo Combat Evolved
(normally boils down to those 2)
Half-Life 2 Deathmatch

We've also played TF2 with those who had it (when it was p2p)

That's all I can think of off the top of my head.


It's casual, but we're going to add a little tournament and I want a surprise game for the end. We can get pretty into the stuff of course.

Thanks again for the help guys!

Edit again: We also almost all play LoL already. DotA's on the table, same with Diablo 2 and Killing Floor for some.

Earlier this week, during the [Company of Heroes](http://store.steampowered.com/app/4560/) sale the nice /r/Playdate mods snagged a few extra copies to give out. There's a [CoH focus time](http://www.reddit.com/r/Playdate/comments/ku9pa/focus_time_information_sept_26_oct_2/) coming up later in the week and we want to make sure as many people as possible can participate.

1. We will first give *two* copies of Company of Heroes to *two* different Redditors. To be one of those Redditors, simply **tell us something about yourself** and post it in this thread. Make it awesome, make it funny, but it must be **honest**. Pictures or video proof is not necessary, but may help your entry stand out.

2. We will then give *one* copy of Company of Heroes to *one* more person. To be that person, **post something awesome about /r/Playdate on Twitter**. You must link to /r/Playdate in the tweet. You can tweet a poem, a joke, an advertisement, whatever. Link us to that tweet in this thread.

3. Finally, we will give *one* copy of Company of Heroes to *one* more person by random. To participate in this field, answer the following question: **Which /r/Playdate mod is the most handsome?** Write in the format of ""**____ is the most handsome mod**"". All persons who answer and write in the correct format will be entered into a drawing and randomly chosen using [random.org](http://www.random.org/).

If you choose to participate in more than one field, please make only **one post** and include all entries.

Rules:

* To enter in this contest, you must have both a Reddit account and a Steam account. Your Reddit account must have its e-mail verified.
* If you win, we will contact you somehow and send you a copy as a Steam gift.
* You may still participate in this raffle if you already own a copy, but you'll just have to make a more awesome entry to stand out. For those of you that do have a copy, please be kind and consider the following option:
* You may still participate in the raffle activities but choose not to receive a prize. Simply state that in your post.
* You may enter **ONCE** in each contest area. **You may enter in more than one contest area.** However, you may only win one copy for one area.
* Moderators may not participate in the raffle (but may participate in the raffle activities). Sorry guys.
* We reserve the right to revoke your entry if we think you are attempting to cheat. Please do not cheat, folks. If we think somebody's cheating we'll be discouraged from doing this sort of thing again in the future.

Active /r/Playdate mods will collectively vote on the entries submitted and choose winners.

You will have approximately 36 hours to submit an entry. Entries will close at 3:00 PM Eastern (EDT) on Friday, September 30, and winners will be notified soon after. The [Company of Heroes focus time](http://www.reddit.com/r/Playdate/comments/ku9pa/focus_time_information_sept_26_oct_2/) will be held later that day at 8:00 PM Eastern (EDT). Join us! :)

* Late-night throughout the week, and any future weeks to come! 9:30pm-2am PST is when we're usually available.

**What you'll need:**

* The Game + expansions (all available within the [Indie Royale bundle](http://www.indieroyale.com/), among other games for $5-6)

* [Hamachi](https://secure.logmein.com/products/hamachi/)

* [Mumble](http://www.mumble.com/mumble-download.php) or [Teamspeak](http://www.teamspeak.com/?page=downloads) (mumble preferred, but we have both)

----------------------------

AI War is a fully cooperative large-scale RTS 4X game with a bit of tower defense mixed in for good measure. Some battles within the game will have you pitting thousands upon thousands of your own ships against the AI in battle. It's hard to explain all of the tidbits, but [plenty of information is located here.](http://www.arcengames.com/w/index.php/aiwar-features)

The DLC (there are now 5 of them) add a ton to the game, with new AI types to face off against, new universe layouts, tons of new ships and other assorted goodies. Fortunately, every single thing you need, plus almost every other game by the developer (all of which are cooperative and excellent) are [in the Indie Royale bundle for the next 5 days or so!](http://www.indieroyale.com/)

A little background, I'm part of a regular group that plays a lot of games together (currently a mix of Rift, Marvel Heroes, Path of Exile, miscellaneous other dungeon crawlers, Minecraft, Terraria, LoL, steam games, etc.) but none of them seem to want to play AI War! I have one other person, and she, like me, doesn't have much experience with the game. We've played through once and really enjoyed it, but are looking to play again but with some more folks. We'll (ideally) be exploring the game together, as opposed to having someone super familiar with the game coach us through.

We play late-night EST, though we tend to seek out PST folks due to that. I'm personally generally on around **9:30pm-2am PST** most nights due to the nature of my work, and would be looking to play within that time slot, ideally. It wouldn't have to be an every-night deal, maybe once or twice per week, especially considering each game can pan over several game sessions. You'd of course be welcome to join our little group and play other games with us, as well! Most are free to play, to boot (Rift, Path of Exile, Marvel Heroes which are sucking up most of our time.)

I think that about covers it! If you opt for the bundle, it should end up running you $5-6 or so for all of the games, and I'd love to play A Valley Without Wind 2, which is also available within the pack.

Hope to hear from some of you guys soon! We're ideally looking for one or two folks, but the more the merrier in the long run. My mumble supports about 30, and I can upgrade as necessary.",,False,,t5_2spg8,False,,,True,t3_1fy9qy,http://www.reddit.com/r/Playdate/comments/1fy9qy/pc_ai_war_looking_for_some_latenight_folk_who/,

This is probably for the best anyway; we think many people are likely still enjoying the holidays and not quite ready to get back into the swing of things. :) Also, this gives more time for people to buy Steam games during the sale, which hopefully translates into greater desire to try out games with the Playdate community.

This nominating thread will stay open until Friday, January 4 at 11:00 AM EST. Voting will commence that day and close on Sunday, January 6 at 11:00 PM EST. Please take this additional time to nominate a game! We still need more nominations to hold a vote.

Let me be clear: **Nominations in THIS thread will proceed to voting for the weekend of Jan. 11 - 13, despite what the outdated title says.** There will be no additional nominating thread.

Thank you.

##CLOSED! DO NOT NOMINATE!

What this means:

1. Do not submit a nomination in this thread at this time. **It will be removed, no exceptions.**
2. The nomination phase will reopen Wednesday in a new thread, at which point you may begin submitting nominations for next week.
3. If nominating is closed, then voting must be open, so go VOTE! Check the front page of /r/Playdate for the voting thread.

##NOMINATION RULES

---

**Please read and follow the rules below or your nomination WILL be considered invalid.** Failure to follow these rules will result in your nomination being revoked. Should this happen, you may re-submit your nomination in a new post that follows the proper rules, or edit the current post. If the cut-off for the nomination phase arrives and your nomination is still invalid, it will be excluded from that round of voting and you will need to wait for the nomination phase to re-open, then create a new post.

**Nomination Qualifications:**

* The nominated game must have multiplayer capability and must be compatible with the computer. And other common sense that I hope I don't have to list here, like if the game isn't released until midway through the weekend, it won't be considered a valid nomination for the upcoming voting phase.
* The nominated game cannot be one of the games that is currently being played. You may nominate a game played the previous weekend, but it is highly unlikely to be chosen due to variety preferences.
* You may nominate up to THREE games per week. You may stack multiple nominations per post.

**The following MUST be included in your nomination for it to be considered valid!**

* A link to the game's website or product page
* List of supported platforms (specifically Mac/Windows/Linux)
* Price (specifically free or not free)
* A short description of the game (optional but encouraged, it doesn't need to be long).

*We require users to list a few game specifications for their nominations to be considered valid. The reason for this is for the convenience of our users and mods. Writing a short description would be helpful, but is not required.*",,False,,t5_2spg8,1357315995.0,,mod,True,t3_15dzg9,http://www.reddit.com/r/Playdate/comments/15dzg9/nominate_what_do_you_want_to_play_for_the_weekend/,moderator
