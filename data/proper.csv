1368592289.0,1555,self.proper,1ed4yw,A Poet's Duel,2269,714,310,http://www.reddit.com/r/proper/comments/1ed4yw/a_poets_duel/,"I have observed that there has been a distinct increase in the interest of the activity known as ""rapping"" of late. Among my peers I have noticed a particular increase in the frequency of performing said raps in an improvisational and rhythmic matter, which I believe is commonly referred to as ""freestyling."" Such an activity is remarkable for keeping one's wit and intellect sharp, however it is with grave displeasure that I note that those who partake in this verbal challenge tend to use the most base dialect that they are able to. I believe, if I may say so, that we here at r/proper could greatly improve upon their methods! And so I would like to propose a Duel of the Quill, if you will. Not just with a particular poet but rather a Battle Royale of the finest Wordsmiths. I propose that each poet compose an entry of 12 lines, and may the voting of our peers determine whose mastery of vernacular is superior. Would one of you gents be so kind as to provide the first sally, and then anyone may return fire.

This place is truly *la crème de la crème*, and I believe time used to peruse these forums is always time well spent. However I seem to have noticed quite a trend on these notice boards of assuming all patrons of Proper are of the male gender. In fact, glancing at the front page, it is impossible not to be called a gentleman at least one time. Now, if in the rules it had anything saying that this was a gentleman's club of course we ladies would not be caught lingering here. However, there is nothing of the sort, simply that any person who wishes to be involved in ""dignified discussion of the finer things and pursuits"" is welcome. 

My request is to simply remember that ladies as well as gentlemen may be trying to enjoy the lovely setting of proper. Thank you for your time, fine gentlemen.

The rigors of my day require a fresh demeanor;

I will endeavor to contrive one!

With alacricity I descend the staircase

The maid, knowing my requirements,

has prepared me a bowl of milled oats.

I fortify myself quickly.  The morning advances apace!

On the street I join the throng of other young scholars,

Vying for a seat on the public motorcoach

Come to fetch us to the halls of Academia.

[]

What luck!

I see my boon companions,

Roll up in a spacious convertible roadster!

Reposing on the front cushions in affected insouciance,

Sitting pretty in the rumble seat,

They beckon from both compartments,

Presenting me with an enjoyable dilemma!

[]

I opt to sit astern and we're off!

Flush with the exuberance of youth

We sing a favorite school cheer, apropop of the day:

[]

*""Friday, Friday, Fight Fight Fight!*

*Jitterbug and jive tonight!*

*Hail, the young debauched bourgeois!*

*Revel! Revel!  Rah Rah Rah!""*

[]

Forty-five minutes ago I was in bed.

Yet now, swept up in a modern mechanical conveyance,

Motoring down the thoroughfare at lofty speeds,

My mind wrestles with the rapid juxtaposition!

Yet, contemplating the impending bacchanals of the weekend,

I ache for the minutes to pass faster still!

I dwell deeply on thoughts of revelry.

Can you glimpse the depths of my wanton musings?

My bosom friend, sitting to my right,

Indulges in thoughts as dissipated and licentious as my own, the minx.

We exchange knowing glances.

[]

I savor the profound thought

That yesterday, being merely a Thursday, 

Impelled nonetheless, by neccessary sequence,

The manifestation of this glorious Friday! 

My friends and I have worked ourselves up to a fever pitch,

We hum like electric dynamos.

We shall suck the marrow from this day!

[]

Saturday if it can be believed, will dawn tomorrow,

Followed blythely by an inevitable Sunday

Portending the end to my frolics,

And if I dare to ponder deeper,

Perhaps the symbolic waning of my own misspent youth.

But I shall not dwell on that.

I return to the vivid presence of this sublime moment!

[]

*""Friday, Friday, Fight Fight Fight!*

*Jitterbug and jive tonight!*

*Hail, the young debauched bourgeois!*

*Revel! Revel!  Rah Rah Rah!""*

I was tempted to turn him away at once, but he begged for my time.

""Good sir, I am desperate for an agent. My family has quite the act!""

""Pish posh,"" I said. ""I do not represent family acts!""

The man continued to beseech me and I acquiesced. He summoned his family. His younger daughter's shoulders were bare, and the lad's attire was that of a street urchin! The son then touched his sister's bare shoulder, as if he were rough-housing with one of his fellows! Meanwhile, the husband served the wife tea! I was marveling at the absurdity of it when the tea spilled all over his wife's petticoats. 

I had to stop the act before it got even more out of hand.

""My word,"" I said, once I recovered. ""Whatever do you call such an act?""

Proudly, the man answered: ""The Buttfuckers!""

Before you accept another delivery of foodstuffs from your grocer, heed the following tale of unforeseen malady that struck my children this very morning.

Our butler returned from the shops before dawn to begin preparing our breakfast. The Lady wreckemtech and I dined on quail's egg omelets filled with a diced veal cutlet, baby spinach, and brie, topped with a hollandaise sauce and served with a side of foie buttered sourdough toast.

At the incessant beseeching of the children, our butler had acquired for their consumption a box of cocoa-infused puffs of corn with a cartoon image of a nefarious looking avian on the package. These nuggets were served in a bowl and then drowned in common cow's milk. I personally wouldn't have touched the slop, but our dearest children shoveled it into their mouths at an alarming rate.

Immediately following consumption, and for several hours hence, our children have been struck with a madness of sorts. This very moment the youngest is doing back flips in the hall, while his sister climbs the curtains. I can only hope that this chocolate-induced psychosis is temporary.

Consider yourselves forewarned!

Signed,

wreckemtech

I have often times received the queerest looks when strolling about with my favourite parasol in hand, a lovely ivory lace number.

1324846747.0,93,self.proper,nqgk8,'Twas the nocturnal segment of the diurnal period preceding the annual Yuletide celebration...,110,17,4,http://www.reddit.com/r/proper/comments/nqgk8/twas_the_nocturnal_segment_of_the_diurnal_period/,"'Twas the nocturnal segment of the diurnal period preceding the annual Yuletide celebration, and throughout our place of residence, kinetic activity was not in evidence
among the possessors of this potential, including that species of domestic rodent known as Mus musculus. Hosiery was meticulously suspended from the forward edge of
the wood burning caloric apparatus, pursuant to our anticipatory pleasure regarding an imminent visitation from an eccentric philanthropist among whose folkloric
appellations is the honorific title of St. Nicholas.

The prepubescent siblings, comfortably ensconced in their respective accommodations of repose, were experiencing subconscious visual hallucinations of variegated fruit
confections moving rhythmically through their cerebrums. My conjugal partner and I, attired in our nocturnal head coverings, were about to take slumberous advantage of
the hibernal darkness when upon the avenaceous exterior portion of the grounds there ascended such a cacophony of dissonance that I felt compelled to arise with
alacrity from my place of repose for the purpose of ascertaining the precise source thereof. 

Hastening to the casement, I forthwith opened the barriers sealing this fenestration, noting thereupon that the lunar brilliance without, reflected as it was on the surface of
a recent crystalline precipitation, might be said to rival that of the solar meridian itself - thus permitting my incredulous optical sensory organs to behold a miniature
airborne runnered conveyance drawn by eight diminutive specimens of the genus Rangifer, piloted by a minuscule, aged chauffeur so ebullient and nimble that it became
instantly apparent to me that he was indeed our anticipated caller. With his ungulate motive power travelling at what may possibly have been more vertiginous velocity
than patriotic alar predators, he vociferated loudly, expelled breath musically through contracted labia, and addressed each of the octet by his or her respective cognomen
- ""Now Dasher, now Dancer..."" et al. - guiding them to the uppermost exterior level of our abode, through which structure I could readily distinguish the concatenations
of each of the 32 cloven pedal extremities. 

As I retracted my cranium from its erstwhile location, and was performing a 180-degree pivot, our distinguished visitant achieved - with utmost celerity and via a
downward leap - entry by way of the smoke passage. He was clad entirely in animal pelts soiled by the ebony residue from oxidations of carboniferous fuels which had
accumulated on the walls thereof. His resemblance to a street vendor I attributed largely to the plethora of assorted playthings which he bore dorsally in a commodious
cloth receptacle. 

His orbs were scintillant with reflected luminosity, while his submaxillary dermal indentations gave every evidence of engaging amiability. The capillaries of his malar
regions and nasal appurtenance were engorged with blood which suffused the subcutaneous layers, the former approximating the coloration of Albion's floral emblem, the
latter that of the Prunus avium, or sweet cherry. His amusing sub - and supralabials resembled nothing so much as a common loop knot, and their ambient hirsute facial
adornment appeared like small, tabular and columnar crystals of frozen water. 

Clenched firmly between his incisors was a smoking piece whose grey fumes, forming a tenuous ellipse about his occiput, were suggestive of a decorative seasonal
circlet of holly. His visage was wider than it was high, and when he waxed audibly mirthful, his corpulent abdominal region undulated in the manner of impectinated fruit
syrup in a hemispherical container. He was, in short, neither more nor less than an obese, jocund, multigenarian gnome, the optical perception of whom rendered me
visibly frolicsome despite every effort to refrain from so being. By rapidly lowering and then elevating one eyelid and rotating his head slightly to one side, he indicated
that trepidation on my part was groundless. 

Without utterance and with dispatch, he commenced filling the aforementioned appended hosiery with various of the aforementioned articles of merchandise extracted
from his aforementioned previously dorsally transported cloth receptacle. Upon completion of this task, he executed an abrupt about- face, placed a single manual digit in
lateral juxtaposition to his olfactory organ, inclined his cranium forward in a gesture of leave-taking, and forthwith effected his egress by renegotiating (in reverse) the
smoke passage. He then propelled himself in a short vector onto his conveyance, directed a musical expulsion of air through his contracted oral sphincter to the antlered
quadrupeds of burden, and proceeded to soar aloft in a movement hitherto observable chiefly among the seed-bearing portions of a common weed. But I overheard his
parting exclamation, audible immediately prior to his vehiculation beyond the limits of visibility: ""Ecstatic Yuletide to the planetary constituency, and to that self same
assemblage, my sincerest wishes for a salubriously beneficial and gratifyingly pleasurable period between sunset and dawn.""

This morning I received the following telegram.  It details a most intriguing situation, the outcome of which will surely prove to be a veritable turn of good fortune for myself.

I enclose the telegram herewith for your perusal.

&gt; Dear Sir,

&gt; I apologise in advance for contacting you unannounced.

&gt; I am Mr Royston Spamoir, employed as the manager of Audit &amp; Accounts in the African Development Banke Du Burkina  Faso  (ADB).  

&gt; I am writing to request your assistance in transferring the sum of 100 guineas to your account.  These funds comprise the estate of our deceased customer, the late Mr Arthur Parther.  He sadly perished, along with his entire family, when their ship was dashed upon the rocks in a fierce storm whilst attempting to navigate the Cape of Good Horn.

&gt; Upon my further investigation, I discovered that you are named as the heir apparent of Mr Parther's estate, by virtue of the fact that your esteemed Father had helped Mr Parther to establish his business empire.

&gt; Kindly forward me the particulars of your banking establishment and I will endeavour to transfer the funds immediately.

&gt; Your loyal servant,

&gt; Mr Royston Spamoir

I don't recall my father ever speaking of a Mr Parther.  In fact, I was not aware that he had ever visited Africa.  But there it is, written in black and white, so I can only assume that the facts are indeed as Mr Spamoir has presented them.

I hope the ladies and gentlemen of /r/proper will excuse me from making so much of this turn of good fortune, but I am barely able to contain my excitement.  My first through was to share my exciting news with you all, and I appreciate you allowing me to do so.  I can assure you all that my new found wealth shall not change me in the slightest.

Your loyal servant,

Lord Wibble of Frusset-Pouch

I started following this subreddit a few months ago. And I did so because I enjoyed reading the text posts and their comments.

However, if you take a look at the [top-scoring posts of all time](http://www.reddit.com/r/proper/top/?sort=top&amp;t=all), all you will see are imgur.com links. Sure, a picture is worth a thousand words and all, but ... I liked the text posts more. They were like going a couple of centuries back in time and witnessing a conversation between people of those days. However, these pictures, they are worthless. Whenever I see a link from /r/proper on my frontpage and the domain is imgur.com, I don't click it. And they are the ones that always make it to the frontpage too, while posts like [this](http://www.reddit.com/r/proper/comments/v64xe/i_have_misplaced_my_top_hat_how_embarrassing/) go unnoticed.

What do the people of /r/proper think about this?

Whilst traveling down the street in my carriage I perchance came upon a notice which declared that the clan of the Wu was not to be fucked with.  My interest piqued by this odd declaration, I entered this fine establishment to come across a most delightful discussion of the queer poetry of said Clan.

In fact it appears I was not the sole viewer of this notice.  The registered members of this erudite community appears to have grown by at least one score since I last (and first) visited yesterday.  Would the new members (and longstanding members in good standing) care to join me for a round of introductions, tea, and general pleasantries?

In a world filled with such scallywags, ruffians, and commoners, it is indeed a pleasure to come across such fine Ladies and Gentlemen as yourselves.  I do believe I shall return in due time.

Good day to you all!

**ADDENDUM:** It has been a pleasure meeting most of you ladies of gentlemen of fine standing today.  When I first made this announcement, it was but a one score increase in the membership since yesterday at the Proper Club.  In the few hours since I have left to attend to some duties of import, I have return to find over **ten score** new members to this fine club!  Welcome again, I say to you all.

Now, for matters of a more disconcerting nature.  When I returned at 3 hours past noon, I heard that an unrepeatable comment was made toward I by the irrascible 'soggywaffle'.  I direct you to proof of his lurid comment [**here**](http://www.reddit.com/r/proper/comments/f2b97/welcome_to_all_in_this_fine_establishment/c1cr1p1).  I have since replied in person providing three options: a public apology, a duel, or failing heart, my public shaming of him here in these hallowed halls.  If he fails to complete the first option, he is not a gentleman.  If he fails to complete the second option, he has not heart.

I pray that this disconcerting news does not too much disrupt your tea and polite conversation thus far.

Mistake not this verbose lament that I am about to give as a crass insult and rebuke upon anyone that purview our forum. I apologize in advance if I might have offended. 

However, it comes to my attention that a growing majority of our most proper forum has been used as a gallery for whimsical canine, feline and other animal companions that are dressed in misshapen dinner jackets and glued upon mustaches. 

While surely I can not confess that it is not to a certain degree amusing, it does make me wonder just how *proper* it is? While I am not here to dictate laws and rules that I wish to enforce upon anyone, I'd not hesitate to say that my belief of this community is not merely to wear glued on mustaches or dinner jackets and then believe oneself proper. Any ruffian can don such a disguise but it doesn't in any way make him a *proper* sort of chap, does he? 

Are we so vain as to believe that an animal dressed up in human clothing is somehow an expression of proper mannerism? If you'd ask me I would rather see good men and women in their proper attire than a dog or a cat in such a garment. Indeed, I would even dare to say that the old boy or lady doesn't even need to refer to fashion and formal wear from older history (though I shant deny its appeal) to proclaim oneself proper as we do. 

Forgive me if I am making unjust statements here, in reality I'd wish for this to spark a debate - a communal discussion by us eminently gifted and proper men and women to ponder about just what we think of this ""trend"" as we might call it. 

I'd value your opinions as much as my own, I assure you. Thank you for taking the time to read this. 

Yours faithfully,

I wish to make a formal complaint.  During my recent perusal of /r/proper I was both shocked and alarmed by harsh comments made on a multitude posts-- a large number of which contained snide jokes concerning people’s economic status in society.  In laymen’s terms, you have overused prejudiced and unfair terms like *peasant*.  

As we all know, one does not get to choose their place in our society.  It is because of the entitlements granted to us as the elite that we often look down upon others, but we must not stoop to such base levels of belittlement.  As gentlemen, and gentlewomen, we must rise above the rest and take a more couth means of approach. 

So next time you feel the urge to demean someone for their misuse of grammar, or their inability to understand what is or is not proper, I think a simple downvote should suffice.

   This is a chronicle of my younger years and illustrates how I became the young gentleman that I am today. It is a tale of ups and downs, and of laughter and sadness. This may take a moment to read, but I implore you to suspend your impatience for but a few moments.

   I am originally from the borough of Drexel Hill in Philadelphia, PA. As a boy, I spent most of my free time down at the schoolyard engaging in various outdoor activities in the company of my peers. One warm Summer afternoon, I was trifling about with my schoolmates as was normal, when all of a sudden, a posse of fiendish jackanapes approached us and began harassing us in a most upsetting fashion. I'll admit, I lost my temper in a most unbecoming convention. I engaged one of the brutish miscreants in fisticuffs and was savagely beaten, as I was acutely outnumbered. Upon seeing my bruised and disconcerted visage, my mother was in quite a state of bedlam. She finally came upon the conclusion that since my father had departed long ago, and since she labored excessive hours to keep her proverbial head above water, that she was is no fit state to properly raise me any longer. She decreed that in order for me to receive an adequate rearing, she must send me away to live with her brother and the woman he has taken as his wife. 

   I was most displeased by this decision to uproot my existence but, as I was but a boy, I had little say in the matter. On the day I was set to depart, I stood on the street with all the belongings I could transport and accosted a taxi coach to ferry me to my new residence. The carriage was piloted by a ghastly chap who had decorated the interior of the vehicle with a number of gaudy knickknacks. This driver was a rare fellow indeed, I thought, surrounding himself with such crude trinkets in a commercial transport. 

   We talked and conversed for the duration of the considerable trip, and although he proved himself an educated and noble fellow, I was rather glad to finally arrive at my destination. You see, this gentleman had quite an offensive odor. By now, it was around 7 pm or 8 pm. I unloaded my things and gazed upon my new kingdom. I felt an overwhelming sense of relief as I realized that I had, at long last, arrived to claim my rightful place as the Prince of the community known as Bel-Air in the city of Los Angeles in the state of California.",,False,,t5_2rg96,False,,,True,t3_j1ecl,http://www.reddit.com/r/proper/comments/j1ecl/a_most_astonishing_tale_which_i_would_very_much/,

&gt; Shapiro, 42, said he gave money, cars, yacht trips, jewelry, televisions and other gifts to players. He also claimed he paid for 
nightclub outings, sex parties, restaurant meals and, in one case, an abortion for a woman impregnated by a player.

Indeed, these benefits do appear to be most improper. Completely and utterly unbecoming of budding scholars at distinguished centres 
of higher learning. I must extend my apologies to the eminently refined gentlemen and ladies in our presence- as recounts of 
such scandalous liaisons have no doubt offended their delicate sensibilities. However, I must atone for such discretions by 
offering an interpretation of what would constitute 'proper' benefits in this scenario. This category shall include, but is not limited to:

- Participation in a rousing game of chess or bridge- preferably in the company of undoubtedly experienced and patrician individuals- perhaps the finest players which the East India Company has to offer. 

- An afternoon tea party- it is most always amusing to spend countless hours indulging in the splendor of the finest teas and cakes and ices that polite society can afford 

- Since I am having reservations regarding this 'automobile' nonsense, I feel a large carriage- equipped with a solid pack of clydesdales and a reliable and subservient driver- shall most certainly satiate one's transport needs. 

- I do enjoy a fine yacht outing- who among us shall be so destitute as to not own a yacht?

- Contra to engaging one's carnal desires with members of the opposite gender- I suggest our fine young scholars instead seek to 
stimulate their intellectual needs. This accomplished by means of fruitful and vigorous discussion of the latest and finest in literature and sciences which cultured society has to offer. I do realize that inter mixture of unwed men and women has the potential to lead to some rather sinful indulgences- however, it does not have to if the intellect of these young individuals is sufficiently stimulated. 

- While I am unsure about what exactly this 'abortion' subject entails- if it is what I think its entomology suggests- then good Heavens! What hath God wrought? It is common knowledge that the proper way to deal with unwanted neophytes is to leave them alone in the wilderness and place their fate entirely in God's hands. My wife and I, the most honorable Duchess of Sghostshire, have done this numerous times, and with, I am most happy to report, great success. 

The aforementioned conditions do describe what I would consider to be 'proper' scenarios- fitting for the most distinguished student-athletes at the finest educational establishments which civilization has yet to conjure up.

A visit never fails to amuse, to inform, to elevate the senses with a discourse so heightened as to render the mundane trivialities of the day mere silence.

Therein lies the issue, I'm afraid. We who choose to aspire to nobler talk often fall victim to a grandiloquence nearing bloviation. Feel not persecuted; even I, your most humble author, find myself inflated with prose beyond my poor abilities to control, as one must break a wild stallion.

Verily, one must never identify a problem without giving at least cursory thought to a solution, lest one fall prey to the twinned vices of sloth and accusation. My proposal is simplicity embodied. The author, reflecting on his piece, is better positioned than any other body to abstract his thoughts to a mere trifle of their grandiose selves; as a photograph merely hints at the truest reality of a scene, so this summary may whet the literary appetite by display of its virtues, or discourage further inquiry by the same.
This synopsis should ideally be easily identifiable, to encourage readership, and consistently appear in the same relative position of the writing addressed. Let us mark our abstracts with initials universally understood to translate, ""Of Excessive Spaciousness; Unable To Complete"" (that the mindset of the hastiest audience be co-opted to their immediate education) and follow the entry immediately but separated by one immensely meaningful carriage return.

I wish to raise awareness of an issue that has been most troubling to me as I peruse this most outstanding subreddit. I fear, Distinguished Persons, that we have rather departed from our most proper routes. 

To begin: a poorly photoshopped mustache does not a Proper post make. Yes, the fine art of properly groomed facial hair has fallen by the wayside in these modern times, and the occasional sight of a well-maintained mustache is relieving. The sight of a decently maintained mustache poorly copied and pasted onto the face of a cat, dog, duck, or any other animal is simply irritating and does nothing to contribute to this distinguished and proper society. The same principle applies to top hats, monocles, canes, white gloves, tuxedos, or any other normally desirable fancy accessory.

One particular post has appalled me in its popularity. This is a post that is entitled: I submit for your prurient persusal; Proper Porn. 

To begin with, I do believe that the Distinguished Person intended to use the word ""perusal"" as I imagine he did not intend to invent a new word. Most appalling, however, is that any one among us may consider such obscene material may be in even the slightest way proper. Indeed, I may venture to say that anything that one may not proudly display in the workplace is not at all proper. 

My third complaint is somewhat related. Vocabulary does not make a post proper. One could have the most correct grammar to ever be heard, and should his subject matter be crude and vile it would not be in the least bit proper. 

In short, my dear fellows, many of us have fallen for the Faux-Proper ideals that are unfortunately beginning to prevail in this society, and I beseech you, my brothers and sisters, to correct your course before it leads this fine society to become a den of iniquity and unabashed memery. I believe we are in the most imminent danger of such an unthinkable crisis becoming a reality, and I pray I am not alone in my position.

Thank you for your time, and with that I relinquish the floor. 


EDIT: I do apologize for not having fully stated my mind prior, but in perusing the subreddit after having made this post, one other thing has caught my attention that I feel needs be addressed. I shall keep this complaint brief, however, as I already have officially relinquished the floor.

I find myself visiting this fine establishment quite often, almost on a daily basis, in hopes that I might find some worthy discussion among the most excellent people who indulge in discussion here, yet all I happen to find are few posts that are almost always more than a week old. I find that very odd, considering that we have, as the sidebar says, over 25,000 distinguished persons who are enrolled in this fine establishment. I dare say this, but could it be because of the fact that we are rather unwelcoming of those who do not possess the highest propriety? Surely we must seek to correct those who have accumulated ungentlemanly behaviours and words due to the frivolous nature of today's world, rather than oust them in an unruly fashion.

Lord zobier    
Sir freakball   
The Right Honourable SolInvictus   
Baron  robotjox  
Lady Faustyna and,     
Sir C_IsForCookie    

With Chief BritishEnglishPolice and Reverend synthemescthewise , I have no quarrel.   

I am sure that the above are all aware of the distinction between the Upper and Lower Houses, that of the House of Lords, and the House of Commons, for those without peerage.      

These noblemen of Reddit, (symbolised by their respective titles) appear to be associating themselves with the Commons, the members of which which are referred to as Members of Parliament.   

As peers and noblemen, the aforementioned have no place in the Commons, whether by birth, or by life peerage, noblemen and women belong in The Lords, for this is the way it need be, unless a disaster of Cromwellian proportions overtake us.   

Sirs, I beg of you, do not bring democracy into disrepute in this, the most gentile and civilised of internet forums of discourse. Abide by those rules set down in 1341, and return to the Lords, or renounce thine titles.   

Might I suggest that the following text be used to return a sense of civility and respect for due process to our beloved r/proper:   

""The Honourable Members and Noble Lords of the government of r/proper.""     

For this would remove any ambiguity, since a government may be comprised of members of both houses, and as such return the rule of law.  

Yours, in quiet anticipation of the return of proper democratic process to r/proper.

I was attracted to the land of Proper once long ago, and during that long-lost time, said Land was much more proper. I regret that I must leave, as this Land has degraded into a measly Sharing of Photographs, and many of the said photographs are merely weak edits of more popular images. The so called Iron Man with a top hat does not make him proper; no proper gentleman would kill and make sport of it. No young child can speak, nor can he request the morning announcements from his mother, and it is foolish to assume he could. Please, I pray, return this Land of Proper back to its once esteemed position.

First I must ask that you forgive my brazen use in this proper tongue. I can very well produce each sentence in a flowing, eloquent matter. But alas my linguistic knowledge is not up to par for such the establishment, which I find myself in.

Now as I move to the question at hand, as someone who was never the fondest of Mozart, Bach, or Beethoven. Last year, I stumbled upon a new name in the Classical Scene, and very quickly I fell in love with his music. I am referring to Ludovico Einaudi, grandson of Luigi Einaudi, *Second President of the Italian Republic 1948-1955*

Ludovico is thought of as an Alternative Classical composer whose music is described as ""ambient, meditative, and often introspective, drawing on minimalism and contemporary pop.""

What I ask is, how the lieges of proper, feel about such a man? Can you look at such a new face with dignity and reverence, or with a certain degree of ambivalence are you sworn to embrace the names of centuries past? [For such a question I have provided a link to a concert Ludovico performed in 2010. It will start midway through and for the next 35 minutes, consist of what I feel, - is the definition of perfection.](http://youtu.be/PAuwd-4yYHE?t=25m16s)

To me, without Ludovico Einaudi, classical music would be, but another genre in a frenzied world of sound and frustration.

I thank you for your time, and am graced by the patience though have shown in the time up to this point. I humbly await the insights and response of this kind community.

What would you suggest, as I would not wish to be rude or insulting to my generous and most gracious hostess?
