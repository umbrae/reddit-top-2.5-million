1369239472.0,545,self.Atlanta,1euaxz,Anyone interested in a former Homeless Atlantan AMA?,660,115,742,http://www.reddit.com/r/Atlanta/comments/1euaxz/anyone_interested_in_a_former_homeless_atlantan/,"I've been homeless in Atlanta twice, once last year and once three years ago, both for a period of roughly a month. I guess I can't exactly provide proof, you don't really take pictures of yourself or keep in contact with the people you meet while living on the street, but would anyone be interested in an AMA in the future?

EDIT: Okay, I'll start taking questions! You guys seem into it enough. I'll give a short background for context: I stayed mostly in the Little Five Points area so it's the locals around there and their habits that I know best. I also dealt with a lot of the travelers/train kids/gutter punks what ever you call them. I did a fair amount of panhandling at the time so I can certainly answer questions related to that. And my drug use, which was heroin, was what caused me to get to that point so questions related to that I can answer. I am now in recovery and have been clean since last year. I have lived in Atlanta all my life. AMA!

EDIT 2: Please don't take anything I say I've done as me being fine or proud of me doing it. Sometimes I can have a matter-of-fact tone that can come off in that way. In truth, the whole experience of homelessness and everything that comes with it is traumatizing. And when I think back to living that life I sometimes have to separate myself from it to a degree to be able to talk about it. I am certainly not proud with anything morally questionable that I've done but I believe it all happened for a reason.

1371967083.0,352,self.Atlanta,1gwad1,"Hey Atlanta. A while ago, a homeless man named Leonard changed my life. I'd love to find him and found out how he's doing. Details in comments.",402,50,53,http://www.reddit.com/r/Atlanta/comments/1gwad1/hey_atlanta_a_while_ago_a_homeless_man_named/,"I posted the following in an AskReddit thread, and a commenter suggest I post here to try to find this guy. I'd love to find him and see if I, or anyone else, can help him any more. Here's the story:

I was leaving a friend's wedding in downtown Atlanta. I parked in a pay lot, and since I was already running late for the wedding, I paid but didn't bother waiting for my receipt. Apparently, in this lot, you had to show your receipt on the dashboard.

So, when I got back to my car, I found it booted. I was pissed. As I was walking back to the pay station to see who to call, a homeless man approached me. Initially I waved him off, assuming he was panhandling, and while I usually try to be gracious, I was already too pissed off to deal with him. He insisted, though, and said that he saw my receipt on the ground. I froze, realizing that he actually had a real reason to talk to me. I stopped and let him continue, and he said he waited around to give it to me. With the receipt, he said, they would remove the boot for free since it proved I had paid, while without the receipt they'd charge me $75 since I couldn't prove it.

So, I took my receipt and called the booting company. They said they'd be out within an hour and asked if I had my receipt. I said yes, and they said okay, then there wouldn't be anything else required. I went back to the man and thanked him, and we started talking. He told me his life story -- his name was Leonard, he had been a concessionaire at the Braves' stadium before a leg injury caused him to lose his job since he couldn't walk up and down the stairs. He needed surgery to repair the leg and couldn't afford it, he was kicked out of his apartment, and ended up on the streets. He said he gathers what money he can to pay the $15/night it costs at the nearby shelter and saves all the rest of it for the eventual surgery. He wants to save up enough money before the surgery to take care of his expenses for six months after, knowing that he won't be able to even panhandle during that time. I was amazed -- he was living his life on the streets at the moment, yet he still had more of a life plan than I, a graduate student in Computing, had.

The crucial thing to mention is that he never, ever asked me for money. Ever. He sat around and chatted with me, asked me questions about computers and my own life, and never once even alluded to any sort of difference in stature between us or my ability to help him. We were equals. No one in the world might have judged us that way, but we were.

When the booting company arrived, they removed my boot for free just as they had said they would. I said thank you to Leonard again and gave him far more money than it would have cost to have the boot removed without a receipt because, frankly, Leonard had earned it. He'd earned it by showing far more humanity and selflessness than anyone else I encounter on a daily basis, despite having a millionth as many reasons to be so gracious. He'd earned it by trying to do a good deed with no motive to earn anything in the first place.

I definitely still think of Leonard. I hope he was able to get his surgery and get his job back. Even more, though, I hope he was able to impact others' lives the way he impacted mine. He gave me perspective, he humbled me, and he made me completely rethink massive portions of my prior political views.

1359860983.0,267,self.Atlanta,17sdxa,URGENT: To the guy on his bike who was just mugged by Lenox Marta off Oak Valley - PLEASE READ,287,20,57,http://www.reddit.com/r/Atlanta/comments/17sdxa/urgent_to_the_guy_on_his_bike_who_was_just_mugged/,"My husband and I were just driving on Oak Valley Rd. toward the Publix/Target shopping plaza and caught the tail end of a mugging. 2 young guys wearing hoodies and skinny jeans had mugged a guy in his late 20s/early 30s on his bicycle. Once they saw us slowing down and our headlights, they took off running, and we asked the guy if he was ok or if we could give him a ride somewhere. He said he had to catch a train, and I asked him to stick around while we sped off after the muggers. 

We found a cop in the process, pointed out the little fuckers, and the cop immediately went after them toward East Paces where it meets Roxboro up by the train tacks... He parked his car, ran after them on foot, and soon after 4 other cop cars rushed to the scene. We didn't see what happened from there because we hauled ass back to Marta, and my husband bought a ticket and ran through the Marta station trying to find the guy who was , but to no avail. 

If anyone out there knows the guy who was mugged tonight, PLEASE HAVE HIM CALL THE POLICE AND FILE A REPORT. I followed up with our local precinct just now, and they said if it was the same cop he's thinking of, that he was coming in with the guys. I gave my husband's and my information in case there is any issue with filing the report. I'm not asking to have the victim of the mugging contact me directly, but I want to make sure he knows those little shits were caught so that he can file a report and identify them.

To the victim of the mugging: if you're out there, I am SO sorry this happened to you, and I wish we could have done more to help you in the moment. I was mugged less than a year ago, and it fucking sucks. If you need anything at all, shoot me a message, and my husband and I are more than happy to help.

Thanks for reading, everyone!

The Medical Marijuana Necessity Act of 1981 (MMNA 1981) established groundwork for the creation of a patient qualification review board. This law is still on the books, but has never received the funding to create the review board. A recent legal decision established that the state cannot prevent the implementation of this board BUT they do not in any way have to fund the creation of this board - no advertising, no contacting doctors - nothing.

We need 8 doctors to staff the review board to begin medical marijuana trials right here in GA!!!

---

**Patient Qualification Review Board**

The Georgia Composite Medical Board is recruiting physicians for the Patient Qualification Review Board (PQRB) who elect
to participate to evaluate the response rates of oral THC, standardized smoking, and patient controlled smoking of anti-emetics
in cancer patients who have failed to respond to conventional anti-emetics therapy. The PQRB is limited to clinical trials and
research into therapeutic applications of marijuana only for use in treating glaucoma and in treating the side effects of
chemotherapeutic agents and radiation and should not be construed as either encouraging or sanctioning the social use of
marijuana. For additional information, see O.C.G.A. 43-34-121 Article 5, Use of Marijuana for Treatment of Cancer and
Glaucoma.

**The Board is recruiting the following specialties:**

-Board certified physician of Ophthalmology

-Board certified physician in Surgery

-Board certified physician in Internal Medicine and Medical Oncology

-Board certified physician in Psychiatry

-Board certified physician in Radiology

-A licensed Pharmacist

If you are interested, please send your CV to the Medical Board by email, facsimile, or regular mail to:

We were hard up for money (we had maybe $400 between the two of us) and no experience/formal education.  The city of Atlanta offered us so many opportunities - personally, financially, and professionally (although I could have gone on without the 20 lbs. weight gain!).  

Atlanta offered us college degrees, a home we bought, and jobs that became careers.  Atlanta's social life gave us the greatest friends we could ask for - the restaurants and bars raised our tastes from fast food to more sophisticated tastes.

We were born and raised in New England, but we grew up in the South.

Sadly, last week, my wife and I returned back home.  But we left Atlanta both with undergrad and graduate degrees from Georgia State University and an understanding of what it truly means to be from the South.  I'm a yankee again, but still feel like an Atlantan and will represent it well.

Thank you Atlanta - we'll be back soon.

So try to name something you think is a bit of a secret around Atlanta that you find interesting.

Here's my contribution: The Odd's End. It's an oddities and strange collectibles store that is in an old Victorian house towards Clarkston in Decatur. They have a closed Facebook group, not a page for some reason. So if you're in the mood to collect some 1920s mortician tools, taxidermy art, whatever, this is the place to check out. They do keep odd hours, so call first.

You can use the coupon code below until 12/31/11 in order to get a whole 40% off your order.

Each time you use this code, you help support our school choral department by donating a quarter.

The code is **N11WC4**. It can be used online, in-store for carryout, or over the phone. It works for an unlimited time, and you can share it with your friends and family.

**EDIT:** Also, courtesy of ribond86, after the new year you can get yourselves some free cheese sticks with the purchase of a large pizza at regular price, using the code **FREECHEESE**.

Do note that this only works in Atlanta and in surrounding areas. If it works elsewhere, that's unknown to me.

Please upvote. This is a self post, so it doesn't count for karma.

Thanks! :)

**EDIT 2:** Holy s**t! Thanks for your support! Completely did not expect this to have this much popularity. Please do tell your non-redditor friends though!

**EDIT 3:** If it doesn't work, try calling it in. That may work, but I'm not quite sure. Also attempt other stores around the area if possible.",,False,self,t5_2qiq9,True,,,True,t3_n5hw8,http://www.reddit.com/r/Atlanta/comments/n5hw8/coupon_papa_johns_pizza_40_off_for_the_rest_of/,

EDIT: Just to clarify, Kramer was taken during a robbery. Our TVs and laptops were also stolen. We were not home. However, this took place during a 45-minute window when my gf was at Target and I was at dinner. Please be safe and lock your shit down, everyone.

UPDATE: Kramer has been found, through Facebook. We're not sure if he ran away or was dropped off somewhere (his paws are injured - its possible the thieves realized he was neutered and dumped him) but he is home safe. Thanks so much everyone.

My father and I, along with the help of some interesting men, have opened up a new restaurant in the Sandy Springs/Dunwoody area right outside the perimeter called ""That Pie Place"". It's a very fun concept involving our version of a pie, both savory and sweet, where we put classics like the Chicken Cordon Bleu, Philly Cheesesteak, Cuban, etc. in a pie shell to make a personal, hand-held, pie. I think our food is a good fit for anyone who is looking for anything outside the norm or just want to try something new. I really like the Reddit community and I would like to give back to you guys so, if anyone is interested, send me a PM with your email address and I'll send you good discounts and offers. All of the information you need (address, phone number, menu, and a cool little video that shows how we work) is located on the [The Pie Place Website](http://www.thatpieplaceusa.com)  . Tomorrow is Pi Day so we'll have a few different events around Sandy Springs and also in the restaurant. Thanks!

Edit: Thanks for all the great comments and feedback everyone. Seriously. I've been asked a few times now to clarify what I mean by ""with the help of some interesting men"". Between the 5 owners of the company, they have over 100 years of restaurant and culinary experience combined. They have helped get many restaurants you may have heard of on their feet like Moe's Southwest Grill, The Flying Biscuit, Planet Smoothie, and Cinnabon.

Edit 2: Guys, seriously, thank you so much for all the feedback and support! You have made my day! I talked to many of you, and shared awkward glances around the room all day. Please PM me any feedback you have. There is no such thing as bad feedback to me. You kept me so busy all day I didn't even have time to type up an email discount, but no worries I'll be working on it as soon as I can.

So I thought I had a dollar in my wallet and when I go to pay I realize I didn't have it with me. I ask the owner (an old guy) if they have a minimum on debit cards and he responds ""don't worry about it. You can pay me back some other time.""

Anyway, so I'm just requesting anyone who lives around the midtown area to go and purchase something from this guy. Instead of buying a six pack from Publix consider stopping here. It's not often people do such kind things, especially in central Atlanta, and I really want this guy to get his own karma for it.

There's no way out of this except for someone to take over the lease for me. The place is really nice, I just can't live in the city anymore. The lease entitles my landlord to all the rent for the following year if I default, so that isn't an option. Please upvote and spread the word because i'm getting nailed for no reason other than my lungs suddenly started acting up.

The room is approximately 120sq ft, with your own bathroom and walk-in closet. Big windows with a nice view of the front yard. The house is right next to the Kroger off of Howell Mill with easy access to a marta bus stop and lots of good eats within walking distance. Its about a 8 minute drive to tech from the house; I can't say how far to GSU. 

For more info or if you want to meet and take a look at the place email me at jacobs1984@gmail.com

I'm more than willing to organize a meetup if we have enough commitments. With enough support and funding, I think we can arrange a kick-ass party and have a lot of fun. With that in mind, I've set up a PayPal account at 

    atl.reddit.meetup@gmail.com

If anyone wants to contribute in any way other than monetarily, just let me know, it'd be greatly appreciated! I believe that the following would be great to have:

* Live band and/or DJ  
* Keg o' Sweetwater beer  
* Party tent
* Food (Burgers?) - both carnivore and vegetarian
* Plates, napkins, cups, utensils, etc.  
* Soda and bottled water  

...and anything else we can think of.

So, I submit the following date and place of a massive Reddit meetup:

###Saturday, June 25^th at Noon in [TBA]*

Let the discussion begin!

**\***Looks like the venue may have to change, depending on rules regarding alcohol and music. If there is anywhere you feel would welcome an event like this, feel free to make any suggestions.

---

**Update** 

I contacted Sweetwater about renting a room, but they are booked all of the way through to mid-July, so it looks like that gold nugget is out of reach. 

Since then, I've called the Atlanta Parks Department and been told that alcohol is not permitted to be served in the parks without a permit, which they *only* give out for festivals, i.e. Atlanta has to be able to make money off of it.

So, the hunt is on for the next venue. I know that [raykwonx](http://www.reddit.com/user/raykwonx) has offered [his soon-to-open restaurant](http://www.darwinsburgers.com/) as a meetup spot, but if anyone else has a suggestion, feel free to share with everyone or PM me. I've got a guy that's friends with a few of Atlanta's beer elite, so he's getting in touch with them and seeing what they can offer. I'll keep everyone up to speed if I hear anything.

1331771195.0,121,self.Atlanta,qx0j4,My incident with a road-rager on Roswell@285.,143,22,92,http://www.reddit.com/r/Atlanta/comments/qx0j4/my_incident_with_a_roadrager_on_roswell285/,"Just as the evening rush was beginning, I was leaving a client's office and heading south on Roswell Road just before the junction at 285 and was stuck in traffic. I was in the left lane, and there was a shopping center to the right. Rather than be a douche, I left about a car length and a half open ahead of me, as did the guy to my right, to allow northbound drivers to turn into that shopping center without blocking more traffic. After about 30 seconds of this, the big white pickup truck a few cars behind me had enough of waiting patiently, and pulled out, drove up the turn lane, and pulled into the gap the guy to my right and I had left to turners. This got him nowhere, as traffic still wasn't moving, although I did salute his ingenious move with a middle finger. Shortly the light at Roswell and Cliftwood turned green, and we all moved slowly forwards.

Somewhere down by Allen and Roswell, the passenger got out and strutted himself towards my car with his tight t-shirt with no sleeves and a ball cap with an overly bent brim. I rolled down my window as he approached, and asked ""Can I help you?""

""You flipping us off?""

""Yes, I was.""

""Why?""

""Because you're assholes. Rather than block traffic in the other lanes, I left that space open for people to turn through while we all waited. You decided to block turning traffic so you could sit at a light three car lengths closer. You're assholes.""

He stares at me for a moment, and I can only assume he was processing the fact that I wasn't intimidated by him, and retorted, ""You're a fuckin' queer!""

I just blinked, because I was genuinely surprised that was the line he fell back on. ""What? Really?""

""Yeah! You gonna do something about it?""

So at this point I took off my seat belt, opened the door, and stood up slowly. I didn't walk up to him, nor even walk around my door. I simply stood there, letting him see I was a good 8 inches taller than him and I presume about a hundred pounds bigger. I'm 6'4"" and around 275. I then said in a somewhat loud voice, ""I'm a queer? Shut the fuck up before I rip your friend's dick off and fuck you with it. Now get back in the fucking truck.""

He backed away, trying to still look tough, and I got back in my car and pulled around him, as by now traffic was moving. I stopped at the left turn to go east on 284, and put on my signal. They pulled up behind me with their signal on, then turned off the signal and continued south on Roswell.

The moral of this story is if you're a redneck dipshit who thinks swaggering around like you have a painful buttplug inserted is somehow going to intimidate people to lay down and take your asshole behavior, please remember there's always a bigger asshole than you who is ready to teach you a lesson. Also, never try to get into a fight with a guy in a car, as he can run you over pretty easily. 
If we all try to make slightly less selfish choices on the road, I think we'd find we all can get where we're going faster. By letting people heading north turn, me and the guy to my right helped keep the northbound lanes moving, meaning when we wanted to turn left through those lanes, there's a better chance it'll have an opening rather than being jammed up.

Also, please use turn signals. Please. :)",,False,self,t5_2qiq9,False,,,True,t3_qx0j4,http://www.reddit.com/r/Atlanta/comments/qx0j4/my_incident_with_a_roadrager_on_roswell285/,

",134,20,185,http://www.reddit.com/r/Atlanta/comments/14skk2/i_keep_seeing_requests_for_how_to_meet_people/,"Anyone interested in organizing a large meetup? I know it's getting colder, but if we can brave the 100+ degree June meetup, surely we can brave cooler weather.

Ideas? Thoughts? ~~Inevitable downvotes?~~


Edit: Ideas so far - 

- Rent out space at the Highland Ballroom ( ~$500 for 3 hours, no bartender)
- Bowling Alley meetup
- Potential rooftop party (would need really, really good space heaters)
- ~~Piedmont Park BBQ~~ (too cold)
- ~~RubberDogTurds vagina~~ (Probably too cold as well)
- House Party (anyone wanna offer to let a buncha strangers know where you live?)
- ~~Clermont Lounge~~ (Too... yeah.)
- If enough people would venture OTP we could always get a private event at [Battle &amp; Brew](http://battleandbrew.com/prices/party-packages)
- Rent out space at [Manuel's Tavern](http://www.manuelstavern.com/events.php) 
- ~~Bar/Pub Crawl~~ (Excludes the under 21 folks)


**Edit 2**:
Currently I'm leaning towards Manuel's Tavern. There is plenty of free parking, they are 18+ (so under 21ers don't get excluded) and they don't have a fee for renting an event space. For conveinence they also have a [party menu](http://www.manuelstavern.com/menu/PartyMenu.pdf) if anyone wants to go in halvsies or quartersises or sixteenthsies with me on some appetizers for everyone. 
I'd just need a fairly accurate guesstimate of how many people would be attending to make sure I reserve a space large enough. 



**EDIT 3**:
Got pretty much all downvotes on the Manuel's Tavern meetup post so... guess I'll cancel the reservation. ",,False,self,t5_2qiq9,1356007863.0,,,True,t3_14skk2,http://www.reddit.com/r/Atlanta/comments/14skk2/i_keep_seeing_requests_for_how_to_meet_people/,

And I have to tell you, it's been great. But there was something that bothered me about using a breeze card. There aren't any reminders for when I need to reload my card. And if you're like me, you NEED reminders. So I did what any ambitious developer would do: I made a reminder system!

I've called it BreezeMinder and you can find it at http://breezeminder.com. The idea is simple: create an account, enter your breeze card number and set up reminders. That's it.

I thought it would be pretty useful (I've been using it for the past few weeks) and I hope everyone in r/Atlanta finds it useful too. Just keep in mind it's a first release and even though I've tried to make it perfect, there still might be a few quirks. But if you find any or you have any ideas to make it better, please let me know!

[Map of neighborhoods](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/62/Neighborhoods_of_Intown_Atlanta.jpg)

---

**[East Atlanta Village](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/East_Atlanta)**: (a.k.a. East Atlanta)

* Who: Young... late teens, early twenties... tats, piercings... hipsters (no hatin')... 
* What: EAV is like what L5P was back before the Target moved in. There is music playing and parties almost every night of the week. I find myself at [The Earl](http://www.badearl.com/) all the time, because they attract great bands (Captured by Robots April 21st)! 

**[Grant Park](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grant_Park_(Atlanta\))**:

* Who: Gentrification house price blowout! You can find fairly inexpensive housing here. Night life is limited to some pretty cool bars.
* What: [The Zoo](http://www.zooatlanta.org/) is cool, but you wouldn't want to go more than once a season. [Grant Central Pizza](http://www.facebook.com/pages/Grant-Central-Pizza-and-Pasta/101467503225102?v=info) is tasty. [Ria Bluebird](http://riasbluebird.com/) FTB (For The Breakfast). [Oakland Cemetary](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oakland_Cemetery_(Atlanta\)) is kick ass... especially as a photographer... or you're an ent with a J. Oh... yearly Zombie Walk FTW! Check out the roof deck at [Tin Lizzy's](http://www.tinlizzyscantina.com/) or [Six Feet Under](http://www.sixfeetunderatlanta.com/) overlooking Oakland Cemetery.


**[Cabbagetown](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cabbagetown_(Atlanta\))**:

* Who:  Artists... Thirty-ish crowd. 
* What: [Carroll Street Cafe](http://www.apresdiem.com/carroll_street/)	is worth checking out.
	Cabbagetown is very small and eclectic. You could definitely find some cool peeps to hang with... although not much nightlife outside of pubs. [97 Estoria](http://www.97estoria.com/) to wet your whistle.

**[Reynoldstown](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reynoldstown)**:

* Who: The artists that couldn't fit into Cabbagetown. 
* What: I always have considered Reynoldstown the burbs of Cabbagetown, which is kind of selling it short... kind of. [Eyedrum](http://www.eyedrum.org/) was in Grant Park, now Reynoldstown... very cool... all volunteered music/art venue. [Krog Street Tunnel](http://www.flickr.com/photos/ajbrustein/5402344439/in/photostream/) kicks ass.

**[Castleberry Hill](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Castleberry_Hill)**

* Who: the Morehouse/Spelman/Clark Atlanta crowd hang out here, but don't live here. Residents are young to middle-age, cool, white people who like art and loft living.
* What: [Slice](http://www.yelp.com/biz/slice-atlanta-2) I've heard the pizza is god-awful but that doesn't keep crowds of young, mostly black, people from congregating here. They bump loud music on the weekends and sell drinks and by the crowd, must be a decent place to hang out at. [Elliot Street](http://www.elliottstreet.com/) This place makes the best damn sandwiches you've probably never had. I'd start with the turkey slawich. It's a small place and most patrons hang around outside. Sometimes they have a keg with a chalkboard and you keep up with how many beers you've had. When the weather is nice they do an iron pour after dark which is a cool thing to go watch while you drink a few beers. [Bottle Rocket](http://www.yelp.com/biz/bottle-rocket-atlanta) Used to be Wasabi, an all sushi place. I hear the new name means a new menu with cooked food in addition to the sushi. I haven't been since the name change but I LOVED the sushi. Good price, great fish. [No Mas](http://www.nomascantina.com/) Mediocre Mexican food with an amazing atmosphere. They also have a beautiful home furnishings section where they sell handmade art and home decor. I can't afford any of it, but it's nice stuff. [Art Stroll](http://castleberryhill.org/ch_calendar/art-stroll/) Castleberry has a lot of art galleries which open their doors, sell you some wine, and let you walk around the neighborhood checking things out. It's a cool, cheap, Friday night, depending on how much art you buy.


**[Little Five Points](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Little_Five_Points)**: (a.k.a: L5P, Little Five)

* Who: Lots of ink and piercings... the people who live here tend to be early to mid 20s. Hipsters (Because of reddit, I don't even know if this word is derogatory)
* What: [The Porter](http://www.theporterbeerbar.com/) is for beer lovers... and excellent food. [Junkman's Daughter](http://www.facebook.com/pages/Junkmans-Daughter/215016775104) is what people who don't frequent L5P say when you mention L5P. [Sevananda](http://www.sevananda.coop/) food co-op. This is the neighborhood that everybody thinks of as ""alternative""... blech. Easy walk from Inman Park or Candler Park. L5P is quite active during the day and at night, and there are some cool music venues. [The Star Bar](http://www.starbar.net/) has free stand up every Monday... worth every penny... j/k, it's actually great for being free. 
								
**[Inman Park](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inman_Park)**:

* Who: Peeps who have graduated from Little Five Points, but still want to be in walking distance (cut the cord already! j/k I live here)
* What: [Dad's Garage](http://www.dadsgarage.com/)... Theater sports on Saturday night is the best improv in town. In less than a mile you can be in Old Fourth Ward, Virginia Highlands, L5P and Candler Park. 


**[Candler Park](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Candler_Park)**:

* Who: Similar to Inman park... except maybe slightly hippier-ish. 
* What: [Gato Bizco Café](http://www.urbanspoon.com/r/9/120226/restaurant/Little-Five-Points-Candler-Park/Gato-Bizco-Cafe-Atlanta)... everybody's heard of the Flying Biscuit... And in the day... they were kick ass... Unfortunately they were bought out by a corporation and things aren't quite what they used to be. For a very locally owned place, go across the street to this small Cafe... and ask for Nick... the owner, and the guy who is cooking your breakfast... Right behind the bar. 
	[Lake Claire Community Land Trust](http://lcclt.org/)... drum circle every other Sunday... and a great community... Don't go here if you are Eric Cartman.
	Also I highly recommend watching people play golf at the public course here... One time I saw a guy who was barefoot, with just one club... hitting the wrong way.


**[Poncey Highlands](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poncey-Highland)**:

* What: [Plaza Theater](http://www.plazaatlanta.com/) to get your Rocky Horror game on. [Rightous Room](http://clatl.com/atlanta/feeling-the-righteous-room/Content?oid=1236880) has one of the best stocked juke boxes in town, and tasty food. [Manuel's Tavern](http://www.manuelstavern.com/) is an old school bar. Craving pizza at 2am? Then [Felini's](http://www.fellinisatlanta.com/fellinis.html) is your place.


**[Virginia Highlands](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virginia_Highland)**: 

* Who: Upper middle class... baby making machines. 
* What: Brunch at [Murphy's](http://www.murphys-atlanta-restaurant.com/) could be the best in town... and one of the priciest. Move here when you have two kids and a dog that cost more than your first car. There are also a number of good locally owned bars... and one crazy Thai place (Panita). Although there are bars with stages, I don't really go here at night much outside of food. 


**[Decatur](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decatur,_Georgia)**: (a.k.a: Dick-hater)

* Who: Although there is a large lesbian community here... Er, yeah. And families. 
* What: [Dekalb Farmers Market](http://www.dekalbfarmersmarket.com/) No matter what neighborhood you live in, you are likely to come here. [Eddie's Attic](http://www.eddiesattic.com/). Decatur is like living in a small town, right next to a big one... In fact... it's exactly like that. It's technically not a neighborhood, but it makes sense to mention. I love Decatur, but I haven't spent a lot of time there. You'll find a high rate of families... very liberal. 
	

**[Midtown](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Midtown_Atlanta)**: 

* Who: Young professionals. There is a huge LGBT community here. Also students from State and Tech
* What: There are a lot of cool things in Midtown: [Center for Puppetry Arts](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Center_for_Puppetry_Arts). [The Independant](http://www.independentatlanta.com/) for billiards, and reddit trivia Tuesdays. [Piedmont Park](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Piedmont_Park) 189-acre's of park heaven... pick up games of ultimate... drummers... great dog park. Plenty of good food and bars. Good late night food ([City Cafe Diner](http://www.yelp.com/biz/city-cafe-diner-atlanta-2) and [Golden Buddha](http://www.yelp.com/biz/buddha-restaurant-atlanta)). Good pizza: [Antico](http://www.yelp.com/biz/antico-pizza-atlanta). Good date places: [Arts Center](http://www.woodruffcenter.org/).

Last year we hosted the Global Reddit meetup at Piedmont Park. The turnout was absolutely fantastic, plenty of Atlanta redditors showed up with epic food, pets and sports like things for everyone's enjoyment. It's almost that time of year ago and it'd be great to have another massive meetup. 

There are quite a few more members on this subreddit than there were last year, so we have the opportunity to be bigger and better!

This is the map of the meeting location from last year: 
http://i.imgur.com/wog3S.jpg

The spot above has been a great location for the previous meet ups as it's fairly central and easy to get to from both the main entrance and the lot located next to Park Tavern. 

I will continue to update this post with more details as they become available.

Which way should I go to avoid traffic in the snow?

Thanks!!

P.S. Don't forget to drive safely in the snow.

I've never really been to other states besides the tri-State area, and I gotta tell you guys, I've never met such a nicer bunch of people. I work right in Manhattan and as much as I enjoy the fast pace of NYC, so many people there are just assholes. 

I'll admit that I haven't visited much of Atlanta, mainly the downtown business district, but everybody here is absolutely awesome. I would go to a bar and people would chat me up. I never really felt alone in this place even though there were so few people out and about, unlike in NYC, where there is a crowd just about anywhere, yet everybody has this invisible wall up.

The kicker is they stole a camping backpack as well which had my fathers old badge in it from Genesee county Michigan and his buck knife that had a white horse on the blade. The camera was expensive for sure but my dad passed away many years ago and those are two of the few items I have left of him. I've been keeping an eye on Craigslist and a few websites that can track camera serial numbers. So if anyone happens to stumble upon it, i'd appreciate a PM

Would like to have a little discussion about pros/cons of the issue.

I'm personally voting yes. Currently 70% of our DOT funds go to simply maintaining infrastructure we already have, leaving only 30% for new projects/improvements. I also don't buy the argument that ""I don't like this bill, but we'll revisit it in a year or two."" The law isn't perfect, but it's a start and I don't trust politicians to address the issue again in a year or two.

EDIT: ~~Confused about the downvotes. This not something people want to discuss?~~ I'm no longer confused.

EDIT 2: Wow, great stuff. Thanks for all the comments and points of view. It was quite interesting to read some of the well thought out no votes, even if I disagree.

I took the MARTA for the first time today. Parked at my office, took the MARTA from Downtown to Buckhead. While waiting for the train in Buckhead, returning to Downtown, a lady randomly walks up to me after seeing my iPhone in my hands.

She then tells me that I should go to YouTube and look up videos of screaming armadillos....yeah.

I politely let her tell me about the videos and as soon as she finished talking I went to ""look"" at the map, put in my headphones and put on my sunglasses. We were in the same car on the train and at one stop a MARTA police officer gets on. I noticed she starts talking to him, pull out one earbud, and hear her telling him about armadillos in Texas. Immediately put earbud back in and turned up the music.

Oh, and her purse? Looked like an effin stuffed armadillo...and she was petting it the ENTIRE time.

TL;DR Rode MARTA for first time, lady was obsessed with armadillos and had to tell everyone.

I appreciate hearing from you and I appreciate the opportunity to respond.

 

S.968, the Preventing Real Online Threats to Economic Creativity and Theft of Intellectual Property (PROTECT IP) Act of 2011, was introduced by Senator Leahy (D-VT) on May 12, 2011, and was referred to the Senate Judiciary Committee.  On May 26, 2011, it was reported out of Committee and is currently pending in the Senate.   The bill targets websites, particularly those registered outside of the United States, which are ""dedicated to infringing activities.""  These rogue websites typically offer unauthorized downloading or streaming of copyrighted content or the sale of counterfeit goods including music, movies, and pharmaceutical drugs.  

 

Websites targeted by this bill are foreign owned and outside the reach of U.S. laws despite the fact U.S. intellectual property is being infringed upon and U.S. consumers are the targets.  Rogue websites cost American workers jobs and cost businesses millions of dollars in lost revenue.  As online technology and commerce advances, we must see to it that injured parties have the ability to stop infringers from profiting from counterfeit products.  For example, a victim of infringement will have the authority to file a civil action against the owner or registrant of a rogue site.  If an order is granted by the court, third parties will be required to stop processing payments from the infringing sites, therefore, preventing infringers from collecting payments.  I will work to ensure that our laws our modernized to protect intellectual property, and will keep your thoughts on this bill in mind should it come before the Senate for a vote.  

 

Thank you again for contacting me.  Please visit my webpage at http://isakson.senate.gov/ for more information on the issues important to you and to sign up for my e-newsletter.


Sincerely,
Johnny Isakson
United States Senator

1340137806.0,84,self.Atlanta,vajtr,June 23rd Global Meetup Day - Cookout at Piedmont Park this Saturday @ 12pm,93,9,181,http://www.reddit.com/r/Atlanta/comments/vajtr/june_23rd_global_meetup_day_cookout_at_piedmont/,"There was a post or 2 about this a month ago and there's 2 meetups on RedditGifts for the same event (why?), but I haven't really seen much talk or organization going on. Last meetup we had at Piedmont Park was awesome, I really enjoyed meeting new people and talking with the usual suspects. FutureImperfect was amazing in organizing the event and I credit her with the fact that 30-40 people showed up and food to feed 100+. If anyone wants to step up and try to fill her shoes it would be hugely appreciated.

One of the bigger problems we had last time was new people (myself included) figuring out where the group was and which group it was. Walking up to strangers and asking about narwhals and bacons is awkward (as it should be), so I had a giant Reddit banner made. Also, [here is a map](http://imgur.com/wog3S) of where we should be.

We'll probably be there all afternoon like last time and the grill will be manned the whole time, so don't worry if you can't come until later. I'll bring bratwurst and buns again, in addition to some beverages. It would be awesome if we could all post what we're bringing.

Lastly, I have no cooler, but I do have a couple guest parking spots at my place on 13th Street. If anyone wants to share a cooler with me I would be more than willing to give you a free place to park and I'll help you carry stuff.

I described what the host of the RHPS was wearing and that they didn't have to be an asshole. So they replied: ""Have a blessed night ... I would think you would not go to the Plaza in the future ... As we are assholes ...""

I guess I'm the idiot, and probably going to be in the bloopers for ""The Last of Robin Hood"" now.

There's a homeless man who is pretty frequent around here (as one snide donut-cashier identified him, yes, the ""one that stinks real bad"").  I help him out when I can, and he's always pleasant to me whether I can help him or not.

Today he stopped me and asked if I would please get him some food, and I said sure and grabbed him something.  When I brought it out for him, he set it in his lap and stared at the box for a moment, then started crying...

Man has like four teeth, so it was hard for me to understand all of what he was saying.  But someone recently stole his coat--he had a suit jacket draped over his head trying to keep the wind off.  It's always a winter struggle for him because the only place he can apparently find to sit indoors is the Midtown shops outside the North Avenue Marta station, and their security has been chasing him off lately.  I asked if any of the churches around will let him in, and he said they wouldn't.  So he has no coat, and no one will let him indoors.  He told me he expects to die this winter.

How the hell do I help him?  I haven't worked at this job for too terribly long, so I don't know the area.  Does anyone know him?  Does anyone have any advice to help him?

Does anyone at least have a damn coat he could use?

EDIT Jan 7:  So through a bunch of quick generosity, I've got a small care kit put together for the guy.  I've got a coat, a sweatshirt, a very good pair of gloves, and a small toiletry kit (baby wipes, fabric freshening spray, Axe body spray [because it can probably kill worse smells best], mouthwash, etc.), and a Subway gift card.  Buddy wasn't out in his usual spots this morning, but I will keep an eye out.  I'll also get his name (I'm a jerk and never got it before) and snap a pic as well.

LATER SAME DAY EDIT:  He showed up!  Brought out the stuff for him (it took two arms to carry it by that point, you guys are awesome!) and he was having a nap in the pretty and actually warm sunlight.  I didn't want to wake him up, but I also didn't want to take his pic without permission.  He had a huge smile on his face, and said it was all exactly what he needed.  His name is William.

1362067991.0,80,self.Atlanta,19egmz,Changes for Manuel's Tavern,96,16,87,http://www.reddit.com/r/Atlanta/comments/19egmz/changes_for_manuels_tavern/,"(From their FB page:) Friends of Manuel's Tavern,

 You are not nameless and faceless. You are not just customers. You are family, and as owner of Manuel’s I want to share some difficult, upcoming changes. It is my hope that, after explanation, these necessary changes will be more understandable to you, and that Manuel's will continue to receive your support.

 Without you, Manuel’s would not be in business, and because of our established relationship we consider the impact of decisions on you. Nevertheless, uncomfortable and unwanted decisions have to be made. The changes below are being forced by financial need.

 Every year management forecasts and surveys the business landscape and looks at any necessary adjustments to our business model. Most of the time, these adjustments are very small.

 However, because of many circumstances beyond of our control, Manuel’s is facing some big business hurdles. As a result, small changes are not in our current forecast.

 The Dilemma:

 Manuel himself did everything he could possibly do to keep our prices as low as possible. A price increase was always a last resort. That same price mentality is true with me today. 

Recently, however, Manuel’s has experienced the largest increases ever in our cost of goods. For a large percentage of menu items we now pay twice as much as we did a year ago. I cannot think of a single item we buy that has gone down in price.

 The cost of regulatory compliance has risen significantly as well. What used to be free from the city now comes with cost. In addition to compliance costs, our property taxes have risen a large percentage.

 As the building gets older, more frequent repairs and maintenance are required. The charges for these services have almost doubled.
 
Manuel’s hope is to soon provide health insurance for all of our employees again. We want to be ahead of the upcoming federal mandates. For decades we proudly provided it, but like so many small businesses trying to stay competitive, we were forced to drop it when we confronted years of nearly 30% premium increases and of competing against businesses that did not provide it. 

I never liked dropping this commitment to our staff and wished it had been otherwise. Now that the competitive field will be level, we will begin to provide this benefit again. However, it will still require a heavy investment, 40 to 60 thousand dollars a year in early estimates.

 I have rushed through the items with you, but here every day the fight against price increases is a tedious daily grind and battle. Everything we normally do to keep costs and prices low is now exhausted, and we are left with no choice but to implement some changes.

 The Changes:

 Menu price increases will be in effect very soon, always an absolute last resort for Manuel’s. 

In the past we have favored targeted price increases, focusing only on items with major cost increases. But after running the numbers, this unfortunately is impossible this time. Instead we are looking at mostly modest price increases across the board, which spreads the burden and meets our needs.

 However, a few items like our tuna will go up by as much as $1.25 per item. FYI: tuna before the Japan tsunami was around $5.50 a pound, and now I am happy to get it at $11.25 a pound.
 
In addition to the menu increase, our hours will be changing soon.

 We will open Monday – Friday at 11 am, Saturday and Sunday at 9:30 am. Brunch will be served from 9:30 am - 2 pm Saturday and Sunday. We will close at 1 am Tuesday – Saturday and midnight on Sunday and Monday. The kitchen will continue to close one hour before the tavern closes.
 
The changing of hours helps our employees and helps Manuel’s as well. Marta has cut some service routes and reduced hours. This reduction in public transportation has made staffing at night very hard. Reducing our late hours gets people home, increases security and cuts cost. 

A plan is underway to be completely smoke free by January 2014. Customer request and event coordinators continue to mention smoking as a problem here. Within a month the only smoking area available at Manuel’s will be in the main bar and that will end in January 2014. 

If we are truly the business I think we are, and you are truly the customer I know you to be, then I know you will understand and continue to support us.

 If you value honesty, please know I have been honest with you about our dilemma. It is scary and keeps me awake some nights. These changes are the best answers I have at the moment. They were conceived through lots of thought and meditation. I have not seen an alternative.

 I pray you understand and continue to love and support Manuel’s.

 Owner and General Manager

Some will have dinner in the city, while others may even stay for the night, leaving Junior free to spend hours loudly cursing at opponents on Xbox Live.

But before these suburbanites cross over the Perimeter, I feel obligated to inform them about a shadowy foe that terrorizes our streets at all hours looking for prey.  That’s right, I’m talking about Park Atlanta.

Atlanta residents have come to know Park Atlanta well because they’ve ticketed all of us, regardless of whether or not we own a car.  In fact, one of their top tactics involves citing random pedestrians for presumed offenses like expired meters, obstructing traffic, or parking in Virginia Highland during daylight.  If there aren’t any people around, they will also cite pets.  

These rules apply to everyone except on Sunday mornings, when churchgoers are invited to come from miles around and park in the middle of Peachtree.  While this tradition causes immense traffic problems, it’s allowed to continue - primarily because Park Atlanta is too busy placing fire hydrants in residential driveways so they can ticket homeowners.

Fortunately, errant tickets are easily cleared up through a simple appeals process.  Here’s how it works: first, you write a letter to the City of Atlanta contesting your citation.  Then, nine days later, you’re selected for jury duty.

The most perplexing part about Park Atlanta is its fine structure, which could only have been created by a toddler given blunt crayons to draw squiggly lines connecting offenses and penalties.  That’s how nine hours in a loading zone is a $10 fine, while “Parking in front of your own home with a clearly visible resident decal” nets you a mandatory tour of duty in Iraq.

To enforce its gamut of rules, Park Atlanta employs several sly tactics like waiting for lawbreakers by parking in bike lanes.  Once an outlaw appears, Park Atlanta swoops in to the closest loading zone - provided, of course, that a handicapped spot isn’t available.  After issuing the ticket, they take a photo of the offending vehicle, which provides incontrovertible evidence of your guilt, or possibly a grainy image of a large shrub.

So, to the Cirque du Soleil crowd, my advice is simple: don’t park anywhere.  Unless it’s Sunday morning on Peachtree.  Then you have the run of the place.",,False,self,t5_2qiq9,False,,,True,t3_14datu,http://www.reddit.com/r/Atlanta/comments/14datu/on_the_joys_of_parking_in_atlanta/,

I am the Communications Manager for the City of Milton (a northern Atlanta suburb) and a long time lurker on Reddit. 

This is a long shot, but if any Atlanta-area Redditors could help find justice for a young man killed, I know his family would be eternally grateful. Plus, there's a $5,000 reward.

Two weeks ago a 19-year-old college student named Christopher Walker was shot in the head in his parent's driveway in a random act of violence and robbery. His family and friends watched him die.

[Here's the story from Channel 2 so you know this isn't a joke.] (http://www.wsbtv.com/news/news/local/police-teen-shot-killed-north-fulton-driveway/nWqbq/)

The City of Milton Police are looking for any information to help catch his killer. We have low quality photographs and video from a Taco Bell of three suspects. 

[Here's the video on the city's Youtube page] (http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pP7314ClVvo&amp;feature=youtu.be)

[Here are stills of the suspects -- again, sorry for the crummy quality. Blame Taco Bell] (http://archive.constantcontact.com/fs166/1101538339397/archive/1112832590422.html)

Any information on the case can be submitted anonymously to the Crime Stoppers Atlanta tip line at 404-577-TIPS (8477), online at [www.crimestoppersatlanta.org] (http://www.crimestoppersatlanta.org) or by texting CSA and the tip to CRIMES (274637). 

I'll also be checking this post in hopes it generates some good leads.

You do not have to give your name or any identifying information to be eligible for the reward of up to $5,000.

Any geeks who live in the Metro-Atlanta area (or are willing to travel there), listen up! There's a new Con in town. Not in competition with Dragon*Con or AWA or MomoCon, but rather standing alongside them. That new Con is AndoCon, a weekend-long gaming convention.

That's right- rather than focusing on a particular topic like anime, or catering to cosplayers specifically, AndoCon is about coming together to have fun playing board games, card games, and role-playing games. We'll have some panels featuring game designers as well. We are friendly to newcomers and we have some easy-to-learn ""gateway"" games to ease you in, and we also have more challenging in-depth games for experts. RPGs aren't limited to the obvious D&amp;D- we support any RPG that anyone we know can run. And in case you get gamed out and want to sit back and laugh to some Internet hilarity, we also have a Video Track where some of the best and funniest stuff the Internet has to offer will be shown.

So if this sounds like the Con for you (and if you're a geeky gamer at all, it is!), we would LOVE to have you join us!

While I'm in school, it's hard for me to work at a shop due to my schedule, so I do work on-site for customers. So, I'd like to offer my services to the reddit community here.

I do anything and everything - no job too large or too small. Anything from brake jobs, suspension, electrical work, emissions repairs, all the way up to timing belts, head gaskets, engine/transmission replacement, etc. The only thing I try to avoid is basic oil changes - my costs are too high to price them competitively. I also do diagnostics (even on older vehicles, before the advent of OBD II codes) and pre-purchase/pre-trip inspections. Note: mechanical/electrical work only - I do NOT do body work, sorry!

I specialize in Mercedes-Benz and BMW, but I work on anything and everything - Honda Civics to Ford trucks and everything in between.

I'd be glad to work with you on a budget if need be. I understand the difference between ""100% by-the-book, factory-condition, dealer parts everywhere"" and ""let's keep this thing running for as long as possible for as cheap as possible"" and am quite comfortable working by either standard or anywhere between the two. Through experience, I know where corners can be cut, and where they shouldn't be, and I always inform my customers of their options. Along with this, I'm always glad to justify to my customers the need for ANY service/repair recommendation I make - showing you how a part has failed, explaining my diagnostic process, etc. If you don't need it, I'm not trying to sell it to you.

I'm offering a discount to anyone who mentions this ad when requesting a quote - $10/hr off my already-competitive labor rates, and if you're within 5 miles of me, I'll waive my $15 service charge.

If you'd like a quote on some work, you can get in touch with by calling/texting 678-685-1495. If I don't answer, leave a message and I'll get back to you as soon as I can. Please include the year/make/model/engine of your car and a phone number where I can reach you.

Feel free to pass along my contact info to anyone you know.

EDIT: 11/3 4AM - Alright, I think I've gotten back to everyone who's gotten to me so far, but I've had an overwhelming response to this post, so if I've missed one or two of you, I apologize - please get in touch with me again if you haven't gotten a reply!

I didn't hear my phone, so I didn't find out until 8 am.  I called the alarm company and the police.  The alarm company said that they received several notifications that someone was in the house and tampering with the alarm.  They notified Dekalb county who responded and didn't even bother to look at the back of the house where a window was jimmied wide open.  When I called them they said officers responded to a false alarm.  

So when I got there at 8:30 the copper was gone, water was pouring through the basement and the house was full of natural gas.  This is less than a 1/4 mile from an elementary school.  I called the cops again and got the same old bullshit.  No dusting for prints, just ""you'll have your report on Monday.""

Useless motherfuckers.

this little man has had a hard start. he has been living in a group home for the mentally handicaped. he has not been well taken care of. one of the residents decided they didn't want the dog anymore and they have been trying various methods to get rid of it, including dropping it off at the rail roads hoping he gets lost and doesn't come back. 
fortunately the social worker that comes to the group home took action and removed the pup. 
I am fostering him and trying to get him used to the idea of being a family pet.
I took him to the vet today to get his shots. he is about 8 months old and just shy of 25 lbs.

&gt;My friend Lisa here at Tech is trying to help a family for Christmas. The mother has cancer and epilepsy and is raising three kids by herself, two of them twins. We already collected enough to get their gas turned on for Christmas but they have nothing. The kids are sleeping on the floors, twins age 9 and a 12 year old girl. Lisa knows about the family because her friend is their social worker, so this is totally legit and for a family that is trying to get through illness and joblessness. If anyone has anything that they have laying around, please let me know. I've offered my time, gas, and truck. I hate Christmas but maybe I can make it not so awful for someone else.

Took the bus from new Orleans to here overnight last night. Don't worry, I'm not a saints fan! I'm here for the Mountain Goats show tonight. 

A friend from back home in Philly was flying down to meet me here and hang out tonight and tomorrow. Her flight was delayed 3 hours early this morning, and just now got cancelled. The next flight they could get her on wouldn't land til after the show started. So she isn't coming.

This leaves me by myself here. 

So!

Is anyone going to the mountain goats show tonight? Let's get drinks before and/or after!

Or!

My bus leaves at midnight tomorrow night. I have an entire day now with no plans... Don't know anyone in this city, don't know much about it. I kinda want to go to the aquarium and the dekalb county farmers market. But I'd totally be down for meeting some redditors and maybe having yall show me around! Any takers?

Ask your state senator to vote NO on SB 269

SB 269 is a bill that will allow the Georgia Environmental Protection Division (EPD) to give violators of clean water laws, including large industries and municipal utilities, permission to take voluntary action to fix their problems. The bill also allows EPD to grant six-month extensions to fix problems with no limit on how many extensions can be granted and no exception for emergency situations where problems need to be fixed immediately.

On the heels of several large spills and massive fish kills over the last 18 months – including the Ogeechee River, where King America Finishing illegally polluted the river for years resulting in the state's largest fish kill in history – the last thing the state needs to do is relax enforcement of its clean water laws.

Please contact your state senator today and tell them to VOTE NO on SB 269. To identify your senator follow this link: www.congress.org and see ""Get Involved.""",,False,self,t5_2qiq9,False,,,True,t3_prqx2,http://www.reddit.com/r/Atlanta/comments/prqx2/ga_contact_your_senator_today_and_ask_them_to/,

Please stay safe out there. Friendly reminder. If you need gas and are near the Metro, it's highly recommended to go ahead and get it before rush hour starts tonight.

**UPDATE:** 1 confirmed death from Adairsville tornado.

**UPDATE2:** Our [Live VIPIR Radar](http://www.myfoxatlanta.com/category/238504/georgia-radar) is showing that the main line is past the Metro area. Still a large body of rain in this slow-moving storm is carrying across the city. Additionally, we have a large cold-front and very windy areas coming through. We're expecting to see temperatures below 32 degrees Fahrenheit tonight.

**UPDATE3:** The storms are clearing through the rest of the state. The intense line is clear of Georgia now, just the bulky rain left. It's going to get cold tonight.

Thanks to everyone's positive responses I've decided to set up a pre-order for the Atlanta Skyline shirt. You'll notice I've refined the skyline slightly focusing mostly on midtown. It looks much nicer now.

I expect the shirts to be ready by the end of January 2013. If you have any questions please feel free to post them below.

Thanks everyone for your support; I'm very excited to get his things to the press!

**HELP ME I DON'T HAVE LONG TO LIVE!**

If someone doesn't adopt me by **Feb 12** I will be put to sleep.

My name is Jasmine. I am such a sweet girl. I am a chow/boxer mix, about 3 yrs old, and I weigh about 55lbs. My human mama loved me very much but she got sick and died. Some mean neighbors tied me to a tree and took bets on how long I would live without food. I was in the cold and rain for days without food until someone heard me crying. Now I am in a kill shelter in Hazlehurst, GA but my time is almost up. I get along well with children and other dogs. I am spayed and vaccinated. I am heartworm positive but it is easily treatable and I have already been on treatment for a long time. I am desperate for love and a family. Please don't let me die.
