1374717609.0,117,self.college,1izzwa,In the mind of a professor.,130,13,56,http://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/1izzwa/in_the_mind_of_a_professor/,"I'm a professor getting ready for the new school year. These are the 10 things I wish college students knew.

1. If you plan on skipping class because you are ""sick"" you probably shouldn't write a status update involving how you have a hangover. We don't count hangovers as being sick. When you have class the next day we count them as stupid. Same goes for incriminating pics. Also, don't come to campus intoxicated. If you aren't responsible enough to come to class sober, then you are likely too irresponsible to be in college. 

2. If you want to skip class, I won't stop you. You paid in advance $20+ for each lecture I give you. If you take out student loans to pay for classes you don't attend and are a chronic absentee, you are likely doing poorly in class. You are literally paying money to flunk school. Save your money; don't go to college if you won't go to class.   

3. If you are having trouble in class, come see me. I don't mind. In fact, the university requires I have at minimum number of hours to wait on you every week in my office. I'm not even doing you a favor, it's a part of my job description. Keep me company and ask me questions. It is usually good for your grade. If your prof/TA won't do this, talk to their boss. 

4. It takes me MUCH longer to grade F papers than A papers. If you're failing because you aren't trying, I'd prefer it if you just didn't turn in anything. It will save us both a lot of time, and you a lot of money. Also, I WILL get pissed off if I can tell I spent more time grading your paper than you took to write it. 

5. Over half of freshmen flunk out. You will find yourself up a creek if you have to pay back loans and you have no degree. You will be eligible for the same jobs you had in high school but now have a considerable monthly payment. You are literally worse off than if you just stayed at the burger joint. If you aren't sure you want to do college, check out programs at tech schools. You will get a job much sooner for much cheaper and you will likely make as much money as many 4 year degree holders. 

6. If something major and detrimental happens in your life, let me know. You don't have to tell me details if you aren't comfortable, but I'll be in a better position to give you an incomplete for the term, let you make up an assignment, etc... I will bend my own rules for you. I'm allowed. They're my rules. I bend them for students who need it.

7. Listen to advice from people who know what they are talking about. If you have a 2.5 GPA and are pre-med, your advisor will tell you to have a solid plan B. Have one. They are telling you that because they know you stand a minuscule chance of getting into that program/job/etc...  

8. Make use of your campus facilities. Your tuition money goes to pay for things like tutoring centers, health clinics, gym facilities, concerts, and cultural centers. You don't have to use all of them, but use some of them. You paid for it, and you may find them helpful or fun. 

9. Don't talk about your professors to other students. Every single semester I get a very loyal student who rats out a classmate for talking about me. Loyal students who like professors get REALLY upset when they hear trash talk. I won't grade you harder, but when you ask for a letter or recommendation, I will tell you no and you will have a very awkward conversation with me about your comments.

10. As a grad student I took out $11K in student loans when interest rates were really low. My monthly payment was $85. Many of you will take out $40-200K for your bachelors education. Your payments every month will be higher than what you spend on your car, or even your apartment. To minimize costs, take as many classes a semester as you can while maintaining your grades. Don't get below a C in class. Follow what your advisor says so you don't end up taking classes you don't need. Don't transfer schools if you can help it, unless it will save you a lot of money (you almost always lose classes you took when transferring). Get tutoring if you need it. If you advisor sucks, get another one. Know the course catalog for your major so you aren't relying on someone else to tell you what to take. Pay for as much of your tuition upfront as you can. 

That's about it. Hope everyone has a great fall term!",,False,,t5_2qh3z,False,,,True,t3_1izzwa,http://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/1izzwa/in_the_mind_of_a_professor/,

Go to your local community college instead. Cost of tuition there should be on the close order of $1000/semester, it looks better, and it will help you get into a real university.

Just posted this to /r/stanford and thought you might be interested too. Would love some feedback; happy to answer questions.

---

I dropped out of Stanford two years ago, and now I support myself running the small business I founded to sell the product I invented.

Living the dream, right? Back in high school I used to joke about my plan to get into Stanford, drop out after two years, and make a million dollars. And now here I am (with two out of the three so far).

Except nothing went the way it was supposed to. If it had, right now I'd be in the Marine Corps, a Lance Corporal or Corporal, pretty low on the totem pole, about to start my second year as a Combat Correspondent. I didn't drop out of Stanford to go do the start-up thing; I dropped out because I was absolutely miserable. I didn't leave to take some internship at Google or rub elbows with VCs; I left to do whatever felt as distant as possible from college and the Silicon Valley. But for some reason, while half my Stanford classmates wanted to be entrepreneurs, I'm the one who ended up starting a business.

This is the fifth time I've started this letter over from the beginning. I'm at a McDonald's in the Philadelphia Airport on a layover from my new home in DC to SFO. I've been invited out to the Bay Area for a week by another small business and they're conveniently located right across Sand Hill Road from the Stanford Mall. I know so many other people who felt depressed, alone, and most of all stuck at Stanford; I have a story to share about getting out, and now seems like a good time to tell it. But somehow it's hard to say ""I'm really, really happy and this is how it happened, and this is how you can do it too"" when all my advice boils down to ""be yourself"". ""Be yourself"" sounds profound when you hear it from a forty-something with years of experience behind them; i think it sounds stupid coming from a 23-year-old white boy who works by himself in a basement.

But I'm happy with my life. Really, really happy. At Stanford I met a lot of people who had one-in-a-million accomplishments, piles of money, beachfront houses, all kinds of skills and talents and the world at their feet. I met almost none who could honestly say they were happy.

The brand Stanford builds for itself is that you can expect Stanford to accomplish anything, and the branding worked on me because I showed up freshman year expecting everything. I expected Stanford to be the place I'd finally fit in, where everyone would be really smart yet also self-confident enough to be themselves and have fun, and there'd be awesome drunk 4 AM conversations in the dorm hallways about the physics and ethics of Batman. I expected to learn so much in class because ""class"" would finally mean more than lectures and reading texts and writing papers.

It turned out Stanford students are humans too, just like everyone else, except they have the added disadvantages of not knowing how to fail and knowing all too well that going to Stanford is a Great Opportunity and they have no right or reason to be anything other than happy all the time. It turned out Stanford's classes were great for some but not for most. There's a kind of person that learns really well from lectures and reading texts and writing papers, and for this kind of person Stanford is easily the best of all possible environments. I'm not one of those people. I always thought that the A-average I'd carried from kindergarten through my junior year at Stanford meant I learned really well in a classroom, but after taking a full course load every quarter and not being able to remember anything after a final exam, I realized that actually I'd just gotten really good at taking tests.

Protip Number One when you're having a slump in college is to branch out and try different activities. I joined Fleet Street, did Mock Trial, Gaieties, and Dance Marathon, went to Cape Town, took Improv and ballroom dance and Design and Spanish and lots of Urban Studies, saw a counselor at Vaden, wrote for the Daily, went steam tunneling, ran the Dish a few times a week, had an awesome bombshell girlfriend, a car on campus, and great dormmates. I did everything that was supposed to be making the most of my Stanford experience, and nowhere did I find the linchpin to make the experience everything it was supposed to be.

So I left. That was hard. It took two-and-a-half years and a whole lot of weekends spent alone in my dorm room watching Failblog, staying up all night putting off three hours of homework until one hour before it was due, not really looking forward to anything except the next meal in the dining hall. You get an opportunity that 99% of the world could only dream of, at the cost of some other kid somewhere getting a rejection letter, and you can't even appreciate it? What an ungrateful brat.

The reality is that college isn't right for everyone. Logically you know that nothing's right for everyone, but when you've spent 18 years being told again and again that college is the exception, staying objective isn't so easy.

So I switched my expectations over to the Marines. Classroom schooling hadn't been the answer to everything but maybe the opposite, the school of hard knocks, would be. The Marine Corps would be where I'd finally fit in -- where everyone would be self-confident enough to be themselves because they shared the same sense of honor and commitment and passion for justice.

Turns out Marines are humans too, like Stanford students. Two weeks after graduating Boot Camp I was diagnosed with major depressive disorder, prescribed a double-dose of Prozac every day, and put on permanent suicide watch for three months while I waited to get discharged for being psychiatrically unfit -- officially an ""Erroneous Enlistment"" which is the military's way of saying they screwed up by not seeing the warning signs and letting me join up in the first place.

There are two nice things about feeling like you've hit bottom. First, it gives you some clarity about life because you don't really have anything to lose. Second, you get good at rolling with the punches. These combined give you a lot of freedom to live your life pretty much however you want.

Until that point I'd been expecting other things -- jobs, experiences, money, people -- to be the key to happiness. It meant not only a lot of putting my eggs in one basket but also a lot of trying to change myself to match what I thought was expected of me. If this wasn't achieving the desired outcome then logically the next step would be trying to not expect anything from anyone else, nor let anyone expect anything of me.

That meant that instead of going back to finish up a West Coast Ivy education I stayed at home in Cincinnati and looked at table-waiting jobs, because I thought waiting tables sounded fun, or at least like a good way to learn about people. When I was offered a short gig with a nonprofit in Washington, DC, I ended up redesigning half their HR systems and exponentially increasing organization-wide efficiency because it was FUN, even though it was pretty clearly outside my authority because I was brought on as a recruitment intern. When I came up with a cool little invention and was advised to get investors and try to pass myself off as a professional established business, I instead made it abundantly clear that my ""business"" was just a young friendly guy in a basement learning as he went.

And now here I am, paying myself to spend all day messing around on the Internet, learning how to make websites and file taxes and make cool stuff -- all of which I did already because I enjoy it. The more I do what feels natural, the more the world seems to reward me. 

What a neat trick! You grow up in a society of how-to books and ""ten steps to becoming an entrepreneur"" and it turns out all you have to do to be who you want to be is to be who you are. I don't think an entrepreneur is a person who comes up with great ideas; I think an entrepreneur is a person who lets themselves be so possessed by an idea that they'll naturally end up making it great without even meaning to. The idea doesn't have to be a product or a business; a stay-at-home mom who blogs honestly and openly about raising kids because she loves it is as much an entrepreneur as someone who invents a new computer. Entrepreneurship isn't a measure of accomplishments; it's a measure of self-commitment.

If you're happy at Stanford, stay. If you're not happy, leave. Either way, make it a deliberate decision -- you're choosing to stay or you're choosing to leave. You're no longer just following the rules in the expectation that some day they'll start granting you freedom. I think Stanford's quietly on the same page with me here judging by how easy they make it to take time off; you can defer your admission or take off up to two years as an undergrad and come back pretty much whenever you want with no sort of penalty.

Anyway, I'll be in the area for a week and would love to hear from you, whether you think I'm a moron or not.

But every year a do a series of posts called Dear Freshmen. These aren't mean posts they are simply posts meant to help Freshmen not do something that clearly labels them a freshmen. So I will start off

Dear Freshmen,
Please for the love of all things do not bring your whole room to college. I know Walmart has that wonderful list of about 45 items EVERY college kid needs to have. Its a trap!!!! I promise. Realize that you will probably wear the same pants with a different T-shirt about three days a week. You don't need a million clothes. All 45 of your teddy bears doesn't need to come either. Bring the essentials because many colleges and organizations will give you free stuff at the beginning of the year. Call a friend who goes to the school or just ask any college kid. They probably ocerpacked their freshmen year and ended up not using or wearing half the stuff.
Sincerely 
An upper classmen

P.s. good luck!


Edit: I will start adding more as I go and number them as well as the suggestions of others. 

Edit: have to go take photos of a soccer game. I'll be back soon

1376055846.0,88,self.college,1k0wfs,"Starting my 3rd year of my undergraduate, here's all my advice to you freshmen.",98,10,31,http://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/1k0wfs/starting_my_3rd_year_of_my_undergraduate_heres/,"I'm not gonna waste your time with ""shit to bring to your dorm"" or anything like that, this is actual advice. Some I'm sure you've seen and some, maybe not. My experience? My first year I shit the bed. Got away from overbearing (but loving) parents, went wild with drinking/video games, JUST skimmed by. Second year, more video games, girls, last minute studying. Not good. Second year (second semester) got my life into gear, and here we are. I've switched up my majors, started getting A's in courses, and am well on my way to getting into Law School.

So, the advice (in no particular order):
-&gt; It doesn't matter who is paying your tuition. GO. TO. CLASS!
You can literally sit there on Reddit everyday and do 70% better in that class than you would by not going. This way, assuming you're not even paying attention, you will 1. Still absorb some useful knowledge and be able to pull it out in assignments and exams/midterms. 2. Attendance. Even if your prof says it's not mandatory, they still pay attention to whose there. Unless you're class is 150+ students, they will notice you if you've never been there before. PLUS they will be more willing to help you out if they know you at least show up to every class. 3. Stress. Even if you go and do nothing, you will feel better. If you just keep skipping class, you're stress will skyrocket, even subconsciously, especially closer to exams/midterms. 

-&gt;Talk to your professors on the first day of class and introduce yourself. Let yourself become on of the first faces they can recognize this term. This will (for most of them) give you a great first impression and they will be A LOT more willing to help you out on a 1on1 basis after this.

-&gt;The friends you make on your first day/week/month/term may not be your long term friends. I've seen people meet during ""Frosh Week"" and continue being BFF's from then on out. Then, I've seen people like me, met a group of people from a different program during the first week and stopped hanging out with them. Then I met another group during that first semester. They turned out to be the kind of people I don't like hanging out with (just generally rude to everyone they meet). In fact, it took me until the end of my first year/beginning of second to meet my friends who are my best friends/roommates today.

-&gt;If you can get a single room, do it, it's worth the money. Though double rooms may seem cooler for being more social and meeting people, its not worth it. Even if you don't end up with a horrific roommate, you're room should be somewhere you can retreat to, whether its just to mellow out, be with a girl or just study. Let somebody else's room be the ""host"".
P.S. Quick note on thinking about roommates. You don't REALLY know somebody, until you actually live with them.

-&gt;Video games are AWESOME!.....in moderation. Trust me, I'm an avid League of Legends player and even produce videos on YouTube (doesn't mean I'm good) but it took me 2 years to realize my priorities. For my first and (the majority of) my second year, I put video games and friends above studying. I managed to make up 2 failed courses in the summer, but its not worth the long run (plus its a lot more money). It's hard, but just DO YOUR BEST to try and moderate your gaming. 

-&gt;Studying. You really don't have to sit down, every day, and study for hours on end. Best advice? Whether you have to read as homework or even if you have NO homework, study right after class. This way, the stuff is still fresh in your head AND if you do this right after class, every day, you will only need to spend 1-2 hours (on average) a day. As opposed to freaking out and trying to spend 5 days of 7-8 hours of studying before a midterm/exam. Doesn't work. Wouldn't you rather be able to just chill those few days leading up to your test?

-&gt; PLANNING! Make a study plan and stick to it. Go out and buy one of those giant dry-erase calendars that you can stick to your wall. Fill in important dates such as due-dates, tests, etc. etc. Then, fill in a day schedule. Your classes and study times. I cannot stress this enough. It is much more worthwhile to study a little bit every day then wait until its too late. This way, it will be staring at you every time that you're in your room. 

-&gt;Budget your spending. Try and manage how much you spend each week/month/etc. Its amazing how much stuff just randomly ""comes up"". You may need a new book that you didn't know about, supplies (academic or health). Or it may be as simple as something you want to buy or go do but you can't because you went out one more night than you should've. 

-&gt;Be yourself. As corny as that actually sounds, just do it. For many of you, going to university/college is a clean slate experience. If you just be yourself, you'll find the group of friends for you. If you try to be fake, it can only end badly. You won't feel like you really fit in and sooner or later, your friends notice too. Trust me.

-&gt;Lastly, health and fitness. I won't go into what you eat or how much you DO eat because that's on you. Personally, I've always been overweight and I took advantage of the meal-hall and ate as healthy as possible. This of course, was after 1.5 years of eating whatever the hell I wanted then realizing why I gained more weight and felt like crap. If your campus has a gym, use it. Even if it is only for 1-2 hours a week and you're just getting some cardio in, its worth it. You will look/feel better and in turn, will do better overall! This last semester, I ate healthy and hit the gym for 2 hours a day, 5 days a week. Lost 60lbs and am sitting at 210lbs and feeling amazing. 

I'm sure there is a ton of stuff I'm forgetting and if this gets anybody's attention, I'll probably update it. Feel free to add anything to this! Good luck to all you froshies out there!

TL;DR
Go to class.
Meet your professors. Your first friends may not always be your friends. Should try for a single room. Manage your social life and video game playing. Study (derp). Plan everything. Watch your spending. Watch your health.

Be yourself.

I know there are a lot of incoming freshmen on here and I remember when I was in your shoes and I was looking for ""answers."" Well here are a few of mine....

1 . Do stuff. Don't be the guy who sits in your dorm and watches netflix and gets on reddit all day (sorry guys...)

2 . Find a girl/boy. I know this sounds cliche, but there is never going to be a time in your life when you are surrounded by like minded people as much as college...especially not singles.

3 . If you still arent convinced to do something (a sport, frat, club...whatever) get a job. You are going to go to college and be like ""i cant get a job cause i wont have time because I will be studying"" (hahahahahaha......whew.....hahahahahahahahaha....it never gets old) Well its not true, and your  choices come down to either: be poor, beg from your parents, or get a job. Just think of it as practice for when you graduate.

4 . Get a posse. This may sound like a bad thing, but the take it with a grain of salt. I dont mean it is a good idea to have a tight nit group that isolates you from college, though sometimes it is, i just mean you need a close group of friends who you can be real with in college. The truth is, it is stressful, even to a guy like myself who is a ""no stress"" guy...you need some friends that you can chill with at the end of the day.

5 . Remember what you are there for. It seems like anytime i see a ""Things you should know about college"" post they touch on this, but that is because it is important. Yes college is fun. Yes there are hot, easy, and drunk girls EVERYWHERE, but remember, you are there to get a degree. That should be first on the list.

6 . While we are on the subject, learn a little time management. There are hundreds of apps for it, here are a few of the things I use.

- Evernote: Make a notebook for each class and take notes, this can mean in-depth hardcore class notes, or simply writing down assignments and when they are due.

- Also use it to write down thoughts, I learned this way to late in college. The truth is that you are in a constant learning environment, so creative juices are constantly flowing. Don't let a good idea escape you just because you didn't write it down.

- Don't be afraid to go analog. Handwritten notes are awesome and no one will make fun of you for going low tech. If anything they will give you major respect. We live in a world where writing things down in a word doc begins to lose its magic, i remember things i wrote down way better than things I type.

7 . Don't skip class. There is nothing to say about this, just don't do it. You WILL fall behind, and if you don't (I didn't) then the teacher will count off points because you ""missed to many days.""

I did what some of you suggested and went to her for an explanation. I emailed her and she didn't respond. I called her and she didn't answer. I went to her office during her office hours and she wasn't there. I did this for three days before finally saying fuck it I'm going to administrators. 

Shortly before our spring break, I went to the administrators and told them about my situation. I also let them know how a lot of us (students) feel about our teacher. I told him we have never had to approve of topics before and mention the comment she made under her breath.

His response was that they have gotten a lot of negative feedback on this teacher over the past few years and that he couldn't say any more than that. He told me he would look into it and apologized.

**AFTER SPRING BREAK**

I walked to class and saw a note on the door. Said class would be held in so and so room for THIS DAY ONLY. I went to that class room and saw really old guy and same guy I talked to. Brief ""good afternoon"" yada yada how was spring break etc. Once everyone got in and about five minutes after class was suppose to start our teacher wasn't there yet.

He began talking and let us know that she was no longer with our school and that if she tries to contact us to ignore it and report it to them. That was monday. I was actually shaking with excitement.

Today however, when we went to class with our new teacher we were informed that our previous teacher managed to get into ""her"" grading page and DELETED ALL OF OUR WORK WE HAD PREVIOUSLY TURNED IN.

Now we're in the process of trying to recover grades for everyone and sort out some kind of agreement on where to go from here.

My parents think I should get an automatic A but I'm pretty indifferent about the whole ordeal. Anyway, she got fired. Perhaps I was the last straw for administrators.",,False,,t5_2qh3z,False,,,True,t3_1apj0p,http://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/1apj0p/my_teacher_half_ass_graded_my_paper_update/,

1. False Advertisement - Everything you see in the commercials will be completely opposite to what you actually experience at the school.

2. Limited Technology - Too bad the virtual machines we are running to utilize Windows Server 2008 is running on a box with 2 gigs of ram and a dual core processor with -1.4ghz making our labs painfully slow.

3. Flawed Curriculum - It's funny how many times a student or teacher will point out technical, grammatical, and structural flaws in our curriculum. 

4. Three fourths of the teachers here are incredibly sub par. You can tell they are here for the paycheck and not to teach. My 2nd quarter I had a class with my chair of my program. He was burnt out, terrible at explaining and teaching us any concepts. By the end of the quarter he was fired.

5. At 40k for your AA, you always get what you pay for... except at ITT.

6. Career Advisers points me to jobs requiring 2 years + experience that also require certifications.

7. Friday night classes to 10:45 PM followed by a Saturday morning class at 8:00 AM.

8. Recruiters tell you that classrooms are small and you will have more 1 on 1 with your teachers, then come to find out that you will be mostly in combined classrooms.

9. Useless filler classes such as Group Theory, Strategies for the IT Professional, Advanced Strategies for the IT Professional, etc., etc.

10. Credits are unlikely to transfer, and most people in the field of IT are familiar with ITT Tech and are generally unreceptive to ITT Graduates.",,False,,t5_2qh3z,False,,,True,t3_1j5yrf,http://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/1j5yrf/10_reasons_why_itt_tech_is_a_scam/,

1345303152.0,51,self.college,yfhvy,"Some unsolicited advice from a past college administrator... (I worked in student conduct, AKA where you go when you get caught breaking ""X"" policy).",60,9,26,http://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/yfhvy/some_unsolicited_advice_from_a_past_college/,"So just a few things.  I worked at one of those large state schools in the Midwest that is known for football and basketball and having all kinds of craziness on campus.  This could be any number of schools, and frankly, the rules are pretty much the same wherever you go.  While I was there, I worked with all of the students that were given MIPs (minor in possession), marijuana citation, other drug citations, got in fights, puked on the common room couch, etc.  You name it, I've seen the incident.  For better and for worse.

**In any case, I have a few things that will keep the most of you out of trouble and without a disciplinary record on campus.**

1.  Please, please, PLEASE do not smoke or store any drugs in your dorm room.  I have heard of every fucking contraption in the world that people use to try to mask the smell of weed being smoked inside.  I have heard of people who smoked all four years of college in the dorms and never got caught.  It's not that you never got caught, you probably just had a sympathetic/apathetic RA who didn't give a shit.   Trust me, we know when you're smoking weed.

2.  On that note, if you choose to use ritalin, aderol, or any of that shit as 'study aids,' please keep in mind that even having one pill of that stuff can get you in big trouble with the police.  I have seen students recieve felony charges for that.  Do I agree with it?  Mostly not.  But it's a reality.  And if *you are stupid enough to smoke in the rooms and keep shit like prescription drugs that aren't yours, acid, mdma, x, or copious amount of liquor, you probably shouldn't be in college.**

3.  Easy solution to all of this?  Don't use or store any of your shit in the room.  Chances are, there are trees because you're on a campus.  Go sit under one.  And give yourself at least an hour before coming back in, you'll thank me when you walk by campus PD.

4.  Do not store liquor bottles in your window.  Fuck it, just recycle them and be green.  Nobody thinks you're cool.  Maybe other freshman who also store liquor bottles.  But anybody who is past vodka level: Burnett's  does not.

5.  Find out what your level of tolerance is for drinks, and stay under it.  When you ""black out,"" your brain is shutting down because you have too much poison in your system.  You'll never remember ""what happened last night, dude,"" because you were not writing it down.  So if it's 10 drinks in a night (not 10 drinks all at once, you idiot), make sure you don't hit 11.  Yes, it will make a difference.  Yes, you will avoid puking in random places, getting hit by cars, or ending up dead.  The latter condition is irreversible and students die every semester from drinking too much. 

6. You may not like the administrators. But at the end of the day, honesty was always the best policy with me. I can't speak for others who were RA's, Hall Directors, Judicial Affairs, etc., but I always looked out for your best interest when you came to meet with me. 

You can also AMA, but I'll be gone until the night and won't respond for a few hours.

Anyway, my teacher is super awesome, very available for office hours, and open to entertaining questions. 

This guy is just so rude to my teacher though. First, it was about the online homework system we use, and he said out loud in class ""It's all just bullshit. Total bullshit"" to the teacher. 

Secondly, he got his test back, and out loud in class said ""Wow fucking bullshit"" and left. Like that is just immature and rude. 

Today the teacher used 10 or 100 or something as an example in an equation and the answer came out to be the same number. The guy just stops my teacher and is like ""Why don't you just teach it like that if it's always the same? There is no point for you to show us all this math"". 

Like ah dude maybe you don't know this stuff as well as the fucking professor just shut up and learn it. It is a 100 level class stop having all this trouble!

After a month of development, I'm really excited to share this course with you guys today. 
The course breaks down each respective section of the Common Application, how to create a resume that delivers meaning, what makes a story stick and most importantly, how to start mastering your story. 

If you have no background knowledge about the Common Application or college admissions, I hope this empowers you to get started. It's geared to help students start tackling their applications head-on through a series of engagement activities. 

I launched my startup last year to help top students of any socioeconomic background gain access to the top universities and programs in the United States. Last year, we helped 62 students gain acceptances into the nation's top colleges such as Columbia, UChicago, Duke, Dartmouth and Northwestern.

Feel free to share with your family or friends who may be applying to college this year. If you'd like to support me, I made a student discount that makes the course just $10; the code is **FRIENDLY10**.

Check it out and leave a review if you find it helpful! Also, check back often; every 3-5 questions I receive I'll make new videos and add it to the bonus section of the course.

1363063116.0,39,self.college,1a4pf8,To incoming freshmen: things I wish someone would have told me,48,9,28,http://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/1a4pf8/to_incoming_freshmen_things_i_wish_someone_would/,"I'm a freshman at Wake Forest University (http://colleges.usnews.rankingsandreviews.com/best-colleges/wake-forest-2978) and I wanted to briefly post a few things that I wish someone would have told me before I came to college. I've been fairly successful, made deans list and jumped through all those academically pretentious bullshit loops first semester, but I didn't do it perfectly at all. Here's the shocker: neither will you. It really doesn't matter if you were Billy the Badass at your new england prep school, or the popular kid at Jonesville High, college will kick your tail in more ways than one. I'm still a noob at a lot of stuff, and I'm not saying i know it all (far from it) but as someone still in their first year I'd hope to present a ground level perspective at what's about to happen.

**1)** The academics hit the ground running. The load varies by college, but it's universally true. I remember the first day of my freshman seminar class, the professor gave us Rand's *Atlas Shrugged* and told us to have it read in 2 weeks. The book is 1100 pages long. Like, wtf? It's typical though. You'll be doing homework a lot. Get the big boy pants on and push through it.

**2)** Professors really don't give a shit... *unless you make them want to*. What I mean by that is, go to their office hours. Talk with them. Get to know them. The West gets a lot of things right, but we get a lot of things wrong too. Middle Eastern cultures are oriented around getting to know a person before conducting business. Do that. Get to know your professor in his/her office hours. When you need that extra credit assignment to raise your grade, or even if you want clout in the department, that's how you do it. I'm not even kidding. I know for a fact I had a B+ in a class last semester, but me and my professor had chummed up and my final grade was an A- (there wasn't a curve, for all the skeptics). It won't work every time, but it's worth the effort.

**3)** Talk to the department in which you think you'll want to select a major and get information early on. Most departments, if not all, have sheets with the requirements for their majors. I know at Wake, since it's a lib arts college, we have ""divisionals"" (some schools call them ""Gen Ed"" requirements) that you have to take to graduate. Some of the those divisionals could correspond to your major, and you could knock out two requirements with one credit. Doing that as often as possible could open the space for those minor classes or pre-med/pre-law classes. Come junior and senior year, you'll be thanking yourself.

**4)** Don't drink punch at parties. Seriously. That shit has everclear in it.



If you have any questions, let me know. I might get lambasted by other current college students calling me an idiot or that I don't know what I'm talking about, but if this helps just one person, I don't really care. College is an a truly wonderful experience, and it helps to do the little things well.

Best of luck at your respective schools!",,False,,t5_2qh3z,False,,,True,t3_1a4pf8,http://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/1a4pf8/to_incoming_freshmen_things_i_wish_someone_would/,

Here are my main ones:

- Test Files. No matter who you are, there is someone you know or can get a hold of who has access to old tests from teachers that sometimes are the same (or close to) the tests that they give throughout the year. Tons of teachers reuse tests and they are incredibly valuable and can help relieve a lot of stress. 

- Type papers using Mac Dictation or another talk to text program. It literally cuts the time of writing a paper in half (at least) because you can literally have a conversation with your computer and instead of taking the time to think about what you want to type next, you can just keep talking and then correct and fix it later. 

- Go to teachers office hours. Professors are much more likely to increase your grade if you go in and talk to them. Also, they will usually help you and give tips that they normally wouldn't tell the entire class. One of my professors literally bumped me up from a B to a B+ just because I talked to her. They are sympathetic people too. 

- Use RateMyProfessor to pick every teacher or professor you have. I cannot stress this enough because most general classes have at least one teacher who is a lot easier than the other. Relieves a lot of stress and increases your grade when you can find the teachers who grade easier, have take home finals, etc. 

- Take the easy online class versions of your classes if you can. Not only do you not have to go to class but these classes are often much easier because all of the tests and quizzes are online and you can use the Internet during them. Also, the classes are sometimes shorter then a normal semester long class.

So you didn't get into your dream school. Deep breaths. Listen up.


I'm going to give you the best possible advice I can. And that's this: don't worry about it too much. I know you are disappointed, but it doesn't matter as much as you think it does. Why? Let me explain. But first, let me preface this by saying that I loved my college. UCLA. In fact, I'm a double Bruin, and I'm back here for grad school. It's great. That being said, after it's all said and done, and after giving it lots and lots of thought, I realize now that I probably would have been happy anywhere, or at any similar-type school. And in all honesty, unless you are trying to achieve something very specific, it doesn't matter where you wen't to college--both for your profession and for your personal life. Indeed, had I chosen to go to Oregon, or UNC, or UCSB, I probably would have loved it and I would be ""repping"" those colors and t-shirts right now. Let me explain.


When you go to college, you don't really know what you are doing at first, and you are still exploring who you are and what you want to be. In any case, you aren't going to have the same friend groups or interests that you did in high school. More importantly, you are going have a ton of new experiences (whether it be in student clubs, in greek life, at parties, dating, going to sports games), that are going to change your perspective on life a lot. Put simply, you don't know who you are going to be or what you are going to want two years from now. The great thing is that virtually any college worth it's weight, whether it's Boise State, Yale, or Wisconsin, can provide those experiences for you. They all have great people, tons of clubs, and lots of things to explore. And as long as you are a reasonably social, outgoing person with an open mind, you will find those experiences that you need to grow as a person and love college. Trust me.


Sure, there are differences. Cornell is going to be cold. CalTech might not party as hard. SDSU kids go to the beach more. Alabama kids love their football and it's hot and humid. USC sucks (joking, joking). Whatever. Yes, it's going to be different. No school except Florida is going to have the (dumb) Gator chomp. But you are going to embrace those differences, and love it. Are there exceptions? Yea. Sure. There are probably some state schools that have no social scene or school pride. And maybe those shouldn't be on your radar. For example, I can't remember the last time someone was cheering for Cal-State Hayward (no offense). But by in large, it's easy to find a school that has all you want it to offer (and indeed, as I have already pointed out, you probably don't know what you even really want yet).


Let me tell you my own story. Honestly, I had a pretty rough first year at UCLA. I had shitty roommates. I lived in the anti-social dorms (Canyon Point). My high school friends who went to UCLA didn't want to talk to me. I wasn't really involved in anything I liked. Basically, I wanted to transfer. And in fact, I applied to transfer to Pomona College after the first year (I had visited friends there and liked it a lot). But then I joined a couple organizations that I liked (an a cappella group and a summer camp). And then I joined a fraternity (which I NEVER saw myself doing before). And they were awesome. And suddenly I was having a great time. And what I realized was that the reason I had such a bad first year was NOT that UCLA wasn't the school for me. It was because I, personally, had not been as open minded or outgoing as I should have been. And what I came to realize is that happiness in school, at ANY school (and maybe in life), is not dependent on certain facts like school-ranking, weather, or sports teams--it's about a willingness to explore and embrace whatever environment you're put in. A school can have everything in the world, but you won't enjoy it unless you take advantage of it (aka, like my first year). I guess what it really boils down to is this: the college itself doesn't make your college experience, YOU make your college experience. And there are literally hundreds of schools where you can have a great one. I guarantee it.
Do I love my a cappella group, summer camp, or fraternity? Sure. But even though I can't imagine my college experience without them, I know, deep down, that I probably would have had similar and equally exciting experiences at Texas, Berkeley, or Ohio State. Do I love UCLA and rep it constantly? Absolutely. But my professional, personal, and romantic life doesn't depend on being an alumnus there. Trust me kid, you're gonna be ok, even if you never set foot on the campus you've dreamed of.

Confused because my loan states that I don't have to repay until I'm out of college, I contacted them.

Turns out that I was dropped from college, all my classes dropped, because I ""did not accept financial aid"" through the website, which I did, several months ago back in my last semester. 

I tripled checked it and signed in for classes, edited what classes I still needed/taking, saw the bill, balanced things out so I could live decently until december, and thought nothing of it. 

Now I can not reenter my classes and was not contacted either by email or phone when I was dropped (the classes filled up when I was dropped). Now I can not go to college because of this! My insurance drops, bills go up, no health insurance, I'm in deep crap. To top it off I have to tell my parents which they will probably chew me out and throw me out the door because that is how they are, college or you live on your own.

Thanks college for not telling me I was dropped before hand =/

I don't know what to do.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
EDIT:
Time for a update I guess of this mess. 

I dressed nicely and made a face to face ""advising session"" with the dean of the school to get this fixed but they basically said ""sorry for your luck, we can not help you"".

They stated that they tried to contact me via phone and email (which they did not) and I told them they did not but they said they can not do anything and basically said it was my fault for not checking the website more often (not in those words though).

The problem is there are no immediate ""let ins"" for dorm rooms in less then a week situations like this and all of my classes that I had got filled up when I was ""let go"".

The school starts the 19th and I can not enter, I basically went with the flow and left the school grounds confused and sad.

Searching around the internet I found a two year technical school in another town but about the same distance of my original school and contacted them and set up a interview Friday. I told them my situation and they were able to get me in to some classes, one online though, but hey I'm in college full time now, just not at the one I went to my first year.

All my credits transferred and to make it even better the tech school is cheaper.. only thing is I have to drive there every day. The school year for them starts the 26th.

So today I learned in a big college campus, I really am just a number that pays bills. They did not care about my situation enough to put in back in classes that it was their fault that dropped me. Smaller colleges are more friendly because they helped me get back on.

TLDR; Be careful out there college students, if you are in a big college campus you may be just a number to some and you need to really make sure everything goes good when you sign up..

I talk to people in my classes, go to a lot of clubs, know people on my floor, do basically everything I can think of to ""put myself out there"", but still I just don't feel connected with anyone.

A lot of people tell me to just keep waiting, that it's easier to make more friends second semester, but I'm not sure.

When she got to me I told her I'd be doing my paper on Starcraft II's league division and that I would explain in detail everything she needed to know.

She made a smug comment under her breath after hearing it was about a video game ""as long as it isn't boring ha"" to which I ignored because she's pretty ignorant. 

After a month we finally got our papers back in our inbox and I checked out mine. First thing in big red letters was ""TOPIC NOT APPROVED"" I then scanned through to see my mistakes in the paper. Mistakes any typical person would make on a essay paper. However, after page 2 she stopped grading. Sooo four pages of ungraded stuff.

I've never been in a situation like this before. 

Essentially, we had to watch a short film in class because we are writing papers that relate to it. We were supposed to be critical of the film and note the many shortcomings of the film maker. 

Afterwards, the teacher says, ""Yeah look at the film maker now!"" And proceeds to show us video of him having psychotic episodes in public (talking to himself; shouting; etc). Clearly the guy needs help. The professor and the whole class is laughing and joking about it after that for a good five minutes.

Honestly, I almost felt a tear in my eye; and I am a very non-emotional person. I have two schizophrenic parents. I don't think mental illness is funny, and I don't want people thinking it's okay to laugh at someone for being mentally ill. My parents have acted much like the guy in the video in public before, and it hurts me to no end if people think that's funny. If you're going to criticize someone's film, it should be for the content, incorrectness and so on, not because they later dealt with mental illness. 

Should I just let it go? Say something? Is it too late to say something now?

Opinions?

I received a Bachelor's in biology (in California) and want to pursue a Master's in speech pathology (a private university in Virginia). Since I don't have an undergrad degree in communicative sciences and disorders (CSD), I am considered a provisional/continuing student. It is required that I complete a year's worth of prerequisites before my status changes to ""graduate student"" at the university in VA, where I will then officially start the 2 year Master's program. This is a private school i will be attending and  so I completed the whole fafsa process, got approved, and accepted government loans all prior to moving here to VA, etc. 

After I arrive to VA (which was about a 4 days ago) I go to the financial aid's office (after receiving a letter saying I was not financially cleared-- only less than a week ago) and they tell me I don't have any loans. None. Nothing. I was told that since I am a provisional student, I cannot receive any federal aid and that my options are to either pay out of pocket or take private loans. The fin aid advisor said she gave a list of provisional students to my CSD advisor who should have updated the list electronically so that fafsa would have notified the school sooner about my status. I spoke to my CSD advisor who said she will speak to the dean to see why it was not taken care of earlier. My friend (whom I met during this ordeal, is in the same position as me) spoke to the dean who said he would talk to financial aid and see what's going on. 

At this point, I'm furious (a complete understatement).  It's going in circles and nobody is taking responsibility for it. I start school in less than 2 weeks and if I'm not financially cleared by then, I will not be able to register for classes. What infuriates me is that if this was a ""policy"" that provisional students cannot receive aid, why didn't they tell me this earlier? Before I declined other school's offers. Before I made this commitment. Before I moved my whole life here to Virginia. I feel trapped. Please help me reddit, what can I do? Who can I notify of this situation? I don't ever want this to happen to anyone else in the future; this needs to be taken care of.

1364528517.0,19,self.college,1b80qj,"2013 HS senior class mass rejection - is it something the students did(n’t do), or was it the school’s fault? ",33,14,48,http://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/1b80qj/2013_hs_senior_class_mass_rejection_is_it/,"Okay so I’d first like to explain my situation, then ask for advice. Not sure how much I can talk about, but basically:

I have been going to a very good high school (public school on the East Coast located in a predominantly asian/white community with VERY HIGH standards in terms of GPA, SAT, extracurriculars, etc.) in the US for four years. The school was ranked in the top ten until like last year when we dropped down to like 60-something because of a low student-faculty ratio :/. In terms of my own achievements, I managed to pull off quite a high gpa (we go on a 100 scale, so it ended up being about a 97) with a good amount of APs, honors classes etc, an okay SAT for the area (2100s), and a good amount of extracurriculars with lots of leadership and dedication (hundreds of hours and such) and outreach etc. (Side note: this school is in no way easy, and earning that GPA basically took away my entire life last 3 years/ first half of this year + extracurricular leadership positions took away any free time I would have had, not that I didn’t enjoy the activites). I wasn’t Ivy material, I admit, but at most other institutions I felt I could hold me own - engineering student w/ a strong interest in history and ethics and a strong basis in both, unheard of right? :O

So last year, our school had a high number of acceptances to very difficult schools - a multitude of kids accepted to Ivies and other great private institutions (when I say a high number, I’m talking from like 3 to 10 kids to each of these schools (UPenn, Duke, etc.) - not bad for a public school) - so that was last year, good year, lots of acceptances and lots of people happy...

Now moving on to this year, a good number of kids were accepted to really difficult schools ED, 1 to JHU, 2 to Harvard, 1 to Duke, etc... So that was fine and dandy, chances for regular kids looked pretty great. Then, because luck just loves our school, regular decision rolled around (these past few days/ weeks) and basically NO ONE got in anywhere, no one to Duke, no one to Hopkins, no one to any of the Ivies (never happened to us before ever) - that no one included me, yay! SUPER smart and qualified kids being rejected everywhere, something never seen before especially after last year.

Now some kids realized that this may possibly be due to the fact that our guidance department sent out our midyear reports incorrectly - they sent them out as optional forms, so a very small few colleges either recognized them as midyear reports or just, as many colleges probably did we realized, ignored them because they were in the wrong format... YAY! (These reports are actually like really important when looking for that one thing that sets student A apart from student B)

So my question is: was it the students' deficiencies do you think, because these kids are honestly so intelligent and qualified that a drop from 2 acceptances to Harvard (used as an example) during ED to 0 to ALL other ivies &amp; many other great schools during regular decision just doesn’t make sense... OR do you think it had something to do with the fact that our guidance department messed up, not only on the midyear forms but also in other respects that we won’t go into? On that note, if it was the school and not us that messed up, is there anything that could come of this, or are we all still screwed?

I know that this entire rant may sound super pretentious, and ""life will go on"" and ""everything happens for a reason,"" but the work these students and I put into the last four years, to have NONE of us accepted almost everywhere, is just so insulting and disheartening. Please don’t take this as me crying, just wondering how something like this is possible. :/ I would understand a lower number of acceptances to many great schools, but 0 overall during regular, that is actually impossible in one year, especially looking at our past history. I just don’t know anymore... Thoughts are super welcome, thanks!

*Thanks for all the great responses - quick update: we got two kids into Georgetown and surprisingly one girl into 2 ivies and UC Berkeley (she only announced it today), so this has lead me to believe that this year was just pretty terrible overall haha! While I am still going to contact the admissions office of a few colleges, I feel that it’s best to just accept this fate and move on.

I went back to community college several years ago, and transferred to a 4 year a year and a half ago.  For the past 1.5 years, I've been thinking ""kids these days...."" frequently.

Just tonight, I realized that it's not ""kids these days"", it's ""kids in general"".

Many of my classmates in the 18-22 range tend to not care too much about their education; they skip class, wait till the last minute to do assignments, and just generally not take their education seriously.

I left high school in 1998, worked in IT for about 10 years, and then returned to school.  Frequently I found myself thinking that ""kids these days"" don't really take their education seriously.... classmates will talk about being relieved to get a C- in a general ed course, or whatever, while I strive for an A in order to keep my GPA up.

I only recently realized that it's not ""kids these days"", it's ""kids in general"".... when I was that age (18-22), I was as burned out and uninterested in school as anyone else.  I realize now that it's not a problem with the current generation, it's just a problem with young(er) folk in general.  Until we get older, we just don't take our future seriously.  Hell, when I was in my 20s, I lived life expecting that I would never live to see 30 (seriously).  Motorcycles, credit card debt, misc drugs, reckless chances, etc.... I never expected to survive; and then when I did, it was kind of a shock.

Anyway.... there's no real point to this post, just to vent about a realization I had tonight.  Even though the current crop of youth in college seems to be useless (playing Minecraft or on Facebook during lectures rather than taking notes), it's not really different from what has been going on for decades, just in a different medium.

Anyway.... take your education seriously... learn all you can, and goddamn, ask questions in class!  If you don't understand something, ask about the subject, and keep asking until it makes sense.

1363462463.0,20,self.college,1af960,Tips for a Prospective College Student (From a College Student),23,3,27,http://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/1af960/tips_for_a_prospective_college_student_from_a/,"I apologize for the block of text. 

Always visit a campus in person.

When you do, don’t be afraid to talk to people. Most (especially students- provided they don’t look like they are late to class) will be more than happy to talk with you about any questions you have.

Talk to more than one person. 

Be sure to ask the pros and cons of the school. Students are especially helpful with this. 

Some questions to ask: 

*How is the administration? Particularly the offices you will likely be dealing with most- the Bursar and the Registrar. Are they nice? Helpful? Rude? 

*Who are the easy/lenient professors for core classes? I am sure you are an exemplary student. I was in high school too. And guess what? I goofed off my entire freshman year (especially first semester). I ended up losing my academic scholarship and caused myself so much hassle and money that could have been avoided if one of two (or both) things had happened. The most obvious being, I should’ve focused more on my classes. Everyone is probably telling you that you will end up goofing off your first year. You are probably telling them, “No way! I know better!” It’s ok, everyone does. And it’s ok to have fun and slack off a bit. However, it’s a slippery slope to failure, so be careful. The second thing, is that my ‘ adviser’ suggested I take 16 credit hours (versus 12- the minimum to live on campus). As a student who knew nothing about the classes or teachers (because I never asked), I let her sign me up for whatever. What I didn’t know was that she just stuck me in the classes that were left over and had the fewest number of students in them. Thus, I ended up with some of the hardest teachers for 4 out of my 5 classes. Keep that in mind. 

Talk to the student workers on campus. Ask them how they like their job, does the financial aid and/or bursar’s office give them a hard time, etc. 

Did you notice how I keep telling you to talk to students? This is because they are your most valuable tool for getting an accurate representation of any school. They don’t have to sell the school, they don’t have to worry about the political mess (yes, bureaucracy is everywhere), and they have no reason to lie to you. Again, talk to multiple students because they are all different and will all have different perspectives that will be useful. 

Ok, now for some general information. 

Any loan that you receive is secretly lower than it says. The bank takes a percentage off the top, so you may think you are covered for the semester only to find out later that you owe x-amount of money. 

Learn how to cook at least some basic meals. If you have a meal plan, great. Even so, make sure you have a microwave in your domicile; it is an invaluable asset. You can find some excellent recipes online for microwave stuff. 

If you are broke to the point that you can’t afford food, go work in the dining hall. It isn’t the most ideal place of employment, but you can always get free food. At the end of a meal (especially dinner), the government says they have to toss any leftover food. However, oftentimes you can take it home with you. I suggest talking to your supervisor about it first though, because some can be sticklers (aka a boss from hell) and will accuse you of stealing. 

Most schools make you pay for laundry. Be sure to ask about that too (cost, do they provide soap, etc). If they do, you can save a little bit of cash by doing the following. These may seem like common sense things, but you would be amazed how many people don’t do them. 

Most items can be worn more than once before they have to be washed. This is especially true for pants. I suggest hanging them overnight somewhere before folding and putting them in their own pile away from the fresh laundry. 

*For the above tip, underwear doesn’t count. Thus, buy a LOT. 

Buy plenty of socks; they tend to lose their mates quicker than you would think. When you buy socks, buy them all of the same variety. It makes life so much easier, trust me. 

When you can no longer avoid doing laundry, sort your clothes. Please do not try to mix whites with anything. It’s just a bad idea. If you have a really small load, see if you can find a ‘buddy’. For example, I don’t wear much red. But every so often, I like to have these items clean. I don’t want to run a whole load for 5 items. My roommate, however, wears tons of reds and pinks. So I will run my stuff with hers. I wear a lot of black, she doesn’t. Same thing applies. 

Never pay for a dryer if you can get away with it. Hang up your clothes in front of a window (especially if it’s warm and sunny). If it’s cold and miserable outside, hang in front of a heater or air vent. Jeans and other ‘heavy’ items, however, you should probably use the dryer otherwise they will smell musty. 

If you don’t have a good heating system (like my apartment), your oven is incredibly useful. Turn it on to 250 or 300, crack it open a little, and you’re good to go. If you live in a dorm, I’m sorry. Invest in blankets. **EDIT:** Never do this with a gas oven! **EVER!** [Here is why] (http://newsroom.dc.gov/show.aspx/agency/ota/section/2/release/15906) My roommate do this with an electric oven and have never had any problems. Thank you from *yawetag12* for pointing this out.

Talk to your teachers. Get to know them (especially the cool ones). There are a couple different reasons why. For one thing, if you are on the edge (between a B or C for example), they are more likely to help you out somehow. They can give you a glowing recommendation letter for jobs, graduate school, etc. They can help you network so it’s easier to get a job. And sometimes they will offer to take you to cool events. For example, my favorite art teacher has given me groceries she would have had to throw out (new diet), told me about a summer trip to Italy before it was officially posted so I could gather funds easier, given me endless amounts of constructive criticism for stuff she didn’t have to, and is even giving me a very nice wedding present (she is paying for our dancing lessons). And, obviously, you will know a pretty awesome person. 

That’s all I can think of for the time being, but I hope it helps. This is all stuff that I wish someone had told me when I was looking for schools and had to figure out on my own. So there you go. Happy hunting!

I wanted to share it with you guys as my blog gets no traffic, so I have copied it below.

I do not want to blogspam/karmawhore, but I would appreciate if you checked out my [blog itself](http://letsmovetowardsthefuture.wordpress.com/2013/04/01/college-what-i-wish-i-knew-a-year-ago/), no worries if you don't want to though.


1) The school you go to and the major you choose is much less importent then many claim: What really matters is what you do while you are there. Nobody, in this day and age, gets a job handed to them on a platter. Computer Science and engineering majors might have an easier time finding a job, but in the end they are not guaranteed a job, and their fields are moving fast, meaning if they fail to get a job immediately they may have trouble getting a job after a year passes.


2) Class is no optional: Nope it is not. Many college students go into their studies with the idea that missing a couple classes is fine, but this is downright not true. Go to class. Reap the benefits.


3) Your friends freshman year are not likely to be your friends senior year: Going in, I was under the impression that the friends you make first will stay the same other the next four (+) years. I was wrong. Beginning of the year everyone is ready to meet new people and make new friends, as the first year goes on your true friends will fall into place. Treat freshman year as a testing ground to meet a couple good friends.


4) High School Drama does not stay in high school: Related to #3, not everyone in college is mature and can put drama aside. Don't assume that people will not cause petty drama, you know, just 'cause. Try to keep yourself away from it, and distance yourself from people who revel in this drama.


5) You will get home sick, know how to combat that: I thought I was independent. I had stayed away from home for weeks backpacking and going off with friends before going to college, I had been doing this since ninth grade. I thought it would be easy to go off to college and part way with my dear family for months at a time. Even I was wrong. The best thing you can do is plan for this, and set up a system to combat this, whether it is photos of your loved ones, or a schedule of calling friends and family back home. 


6) You and your friends 'back home' will drift apart: It is inevitable. I'm not saying your friendship will disappear, but rather it will no longer be as strong as it was during high school. In some ways, our friendships are only as strong as our shared memories and experiences. What I found, going back for Winter break, was that while we stilled shared some things in common, we were still friends, but there was that awkward moment when we were about to reminisce about something or another, and you realize that they were not there for that, because that was back in college.


7) You will have some classes that, well, suck: No matter whether you are going to LeShit U or Yale, there will be those classes that just plain suck. It doesn't matter your major, concentration, etc, there will be at least one (and often a couple) classes that are mostly busywork that you will have to take. Do your best in them, and try to learn something from them. People tend to try and ignore them, skip class, bullshit the papers, etc in these classes. You never know what professor will turn out to be great, and who will need to write your letters of recommendation, burning bridges by fucking around in a bullshit class is a stupid way to ruin your GPA. Especially since if you put even a tiny bit of effort into passing the class, you probably can pass with flying color.


8) Read assigned readings: They are normally not just assigned for your pleasure reading, most of the time it is related to the class. Reading it will help you perform better.",,False,,t5_2qh3z,False,,,True,t3_1bfe5m,http://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/1bfe5m/what_i_wish_i_knew_a_year_ago/,

I'm not sure exactly what happened though, I remember my school asked for certain papers I needed around the same time I finished my FASFA so idk if I had submitted a hard copy through the mail since I gave every paper I needed to turn in to the Financial Aid place at my school. 

I don't want to put my parents at risk since they have been here for many years, I'm dependent on them to have this crappy place to live in and to eat plus my little brother as well.

I have worked for my college's Admissions department, Financial Aid department, and Residence Life Department (as an RA) so I'm use to the ""lingo"" or ""slang"" if you will.

My roommates/suite-mates were checking out of their room while I was taking my last two finals back-to-back and were cleaning out alcohol they had been hiding all year. The RA comes in to check them out and appropriately writes them all up for possession alcohol in a dry dorm. Because I was living in the room, the school assumed I had known my roommates possessed it and gave me sanctions as well.

My evidence was the fact that the school had no proof my roommates possessed this alcohol all semester (as it was check-out time and they were cleaning out their things), my final exams were during the entirety of the incident (as my schedule and my school's final exam schedule state), and my name only came up in the RA's report as someone who lived there.

My school's conduct board used their ""summer process"" and did not give me a pre-hearing (as is normally standard), did not give me an actual trial even though I was present on the campus (but instead had me submit a statement a month earlier and then never contacted me until they just e-mailed me my punishment).

My sanctions included pending termination of residency (housing expulsion if I commit and wrong-doings within the next academic year), $100 fine, mandatory alcohol online class, and a conduct letter sent to my mother. This letter is confusing because in Admissions I was taught that a student's conduct records were protected by the Family Education Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA) and although my mother does not have a waiver to know of my record, they already sent her the letter. Not to mention I was given two days to appeal all these sanctions but was notified the letter was already sent out to my mother! My school locally advertises students' conduct records being protected under FERPA but otherwise, this seems like a very bad lie.

I am not venting more or less because of the sanctions, they are very general in nature, but I want advice from the more experienced Reddit community because I have been punished for something I did not do (with circumstantial evidence at best to pin me to the crime while I have evidence supporting I had nothing to do with it), my school possibly violated FERPA, and I am being treated like a criminal within the school I have given everything to these last two years.

TL;DR - Conduct Board prosecutes me based on circumstantial evidence while I have proof that I was not at the incident in question. My school possibly violated FERPA by sending my mother a letter concerning my conduct record despite no FERPA waiver and before I have a chance to appeal the sanctions.

I'm trying to hash out a rough schedule for next year (classes and their timings, hours allotted for fun, socialization, eating, commuting, hidden time costs; the schedule is very flexible) and I ran into a wall regarding homework. Right now I have it at 3 hours for 3 days of the week and 4 hours for 2 based on how many classes I have those days plus an hour to each for good measure. I'm not sure if I'm overestimating.

I mean I only have days with either two or three classes a day, and in High School, I did maybe an hour of work for four classes a day (with a good 6 APs / 8 classes in there mind you). Even if the homework is optional I'd like to do it anyway.

what's the average interest rate I am going to be offered and what are my payment options for after I graduate? any ""strategies"" I should be aware of?

Is 36K too much to be pulling out for a loan?



Also, I plan on paying for housing and food by myself after freshman year, since at this college you are required to have a dorm your first year and there is already a meal plan you are required to pay for as well. the rooming in the area cost around 1,100-1,200 dollars a month with a roommate. In the end I will probably be paying around $500 a month plus another 100-200 for food. 

Is this an attainable goal? is it possible for a full-time student to afford housing and food with a part-time job?

The problem is these majors aren't very hireable, supposedly. I can't do anything that is *heavily* (obviously math is involved in everything) based upon math, so these ones are right out:

Engineering 

Accounting

Some kind of hard science

History

Journalism

English

Some sort of social science degree

Economics

I was homeschooled, so I was able to graduate early, and start getting my required classes out of the way.

Now, I am 22. All of my friends live hours away from me, even my fiance lives two hours away.

I've spent the last three years trying to get out of my awful environment, and go to college so I can pursue my dream of writing, and producing films. My family is... they mean well, but they are *so* negative, and I can't handle them anymore. They scream, they fight, they act poorly and it rubs off on me so that now I act like that when I get really upset. I hate myself when I act like my mom, or my dad.

My dad has been truly trying to help me go to college. He's helped me with money, but he just doesn't *have enough* We have spent months looking for a semi-decent car, and my classes start this month and I haven't even fucking signed up for any yet, due to so many problems.

First, it was that we have no money, now it's that we have no car(we were supposed to have one fixed up, but it won't be fixed soon enough).

I've had chronic pain and health issues most of my life, and I've struggled through school and keeping jobs. I had to quit my last job because of my pain, but I'm always actively trying to work with my doctor to feel better. I felt good enough last semester to do *SO fucking awesome* in school! All A's, so proud of myself!

I worked HARD, I studied, I earned my good grades. Then, I worked on my dream of working in theater, but it wasn't a paid position. I feel like an idiot. I should have tried to get a job so I could make enough money to buy a shitty car off Craigslist.

Now, I have no money. I have no car. I have a place to live for free(if I go to college), thank goodness. But, since my father is funding my education, he's just...very odd and doesn't communicate. He won't tell me if I'm actually going this year, or not. Which fucking sucks, because it is all in his hands, and he keeps acting like it will work out.

But today he told me we won't have a car, but he *still* wouldn't just tell me if I'll be able to go this year or not. He just can't figure it all out. I can't fill out financial aid forms until he gives me the go-ahead. He finally told me to get an advising appointment, so that I can sign up for some fucking classes, but FUCK, what's the point, if I'm not going?

I'm miserable here at home. I'm 22 years old and I feel like a complete loser for never living anywhere away from my family. I *need* to be on my own right now, I am sinking into a rather deep depression, and I don't know how I'm going to dig myself out of it if I end up staying home for another four months, until the Spring semester.

I've taken easy A classes before, but the fact that it was an easy A was mostly due to the fact that the teacher was incompetent.

So anyway, in this class we have ten homework assignments worth ten points each that adds up to a hundred (so it's really easy to figure out your overall homework grade). I was checking my grades online and noticed that two of my homework assignments were missing. One I did, but I think I turned it into the wrong pile so it must have been misplaced, and the other I didn't do and lost the paper.

Before class I go up to him and tell him that two assignments were missing, one I did, the other I didn't. He told me to email him to remind him and he'll check for the lost homework and to go ahead and turn in the one I didn't do. I told him I lost the paper and he said ""I'd hate for you to lose those ten points. I'll figure something out for you to do for bonus points. Email me."" Just the fact that he cared enough to not want me to lose ten points was great. I've rarely had teachers like that.

I emailed him later that day reminding him of our brief conversation and he emailed me back later that night saying ""Thanks, I'll take care of it.""

I checked my grades this morning and not only did he give me the full credit for the homework I did, but he even gave me full credit for the one I didn't do! And the thing is, I thought about lying and saying I did both assignments and they must have gotten lost, but he is a really nice guy and I would've felt bad for taking advantage, so I just told him the truth and it paid off.

However, upon reading the copy of the appeal form, it looks like he had to have some sort of emergency or circumstance beyond his control like a death in the family or something.  In truth, he just didn't study enough, but he obviously won't put that.  My thought process suggests that the school has every reason to approve it because they'll get their federal money guaranteed, but I have no experience with this kind of stuff.



Are there any tips for writing the appeal to make it more likely to be approved? If you need any more info, just ask.

I don't ultimately feel like I need to join one in order to be social and happy, but I do feel that it would be something really fun and a once-in-a-lifetime experience. I already know one person in the fraternity I am thinking of joining and both he and I have somewhat of the same personality so I think I'll fit in, but I'm still going to rush to make sure.

Here is my problem:
1. I am going to college on a full ride, but am going to have an on-campus job just to make some extra cash. My parents are totally opposed to the idea of joining a fraternity, so if I join all expenses will be coming out of my pocket. Do u think I  will be able to pay my dues ($45/month) and other expenses (booze, pledge stuff, party costumes, etc) with a job that only nets me about 3.5K for the while year??? I will probably be getting at least a 1K stipend this year, but I really don't want to use it.

2. I know that I will need blazers, bowties, other dress clothes for formals and such. Do I need to bring these in August (i won't be coming home much) when I move in, even if I'm not 100% i'm going to join?

3. I'm not even sure I have time for a fraternity. B/w classes, studying, working, sleeping, working for a public health advocacy group, and club tennis, I factored in that I have roughly 64 hours left in the week (yes, i'm weird like that I KNOW).

As most of you are aware, this week is when ED/EA (early decision/early action) applicants find out if they got in or not (or deferred). Well, this is for those of you who did not get into your top school ED or EA.

I'm not here to console you, but rather to share my experiences as a person who got rejected from his top school, which may or may not result in your consolation.

I'm approaching the end of my first semester at SUNY Geneseo, a small state school in western NY, which was my second choice school. I applied to the following schools: Cornell University (top choice), SUNY Geneseo, SUNY Binghamton, George Washington University, and University of Vermont (safety).

I ended up getting rejected from Cornell and Bing, waitlisted at GW, and accepted at Geneseo and UVM. Consequently, I was pretty upset. Born and raised in Ithaca (where Cornell is), I always looked toward Cornell to be *the* college to go to; however, this was not the case.

I ended up at Geneseo, where I not only found out I was saving a ton of money (I'm only paying ~$600 per semester w/ financial aid), but also, and most importantly, what I was genuinely interested in. I came in as a political science major, which I still enjoy, but learned I was very interested in labor history and policy through taking a 200-level history course, Work and Workers in America. At first, I was intimidated by how much I had to read (i.e. four books, an eight page paper, and textbook reading for each lecture), and I nearly decided to drop out of the class, but I stayed and soon discovered that the material was intellectually engaging.

Upon registering for spring classes, I noticed a lack of labor-related courses and began to look elsewhere. I turned to Cornell, my top choice school, to see if they had anything to offer. I called several schools within Cornell, looked through several curriculums, and concluded that Cornell's School of Industrial and Labor Relations (ILR) was where I needed to transfer to further pursue this interest.

I very recently contacted my Labor professor, and she said she'd be happy to write me a letter of recommendation, a 'very strong' one, in fact. No doubt my academic interest reflected well upon my grades, and I'm expecting at least a 3.5 GPA for my first semester.

The point is, despite having been rejected from my top school, I gained something I otherwise wouldn't have had I gotten accepted: perspective and a greater appreciation for higher education.

**TL;DR** Got rejected from Cornell, my top school, found where my academic interests lie, and am working hard to transfer. All is never lost.",,False,,t5_2qh3z,1355545284.0,,,True,t3_14vpbc,http://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/14vpbc/if_you_got_rejected_from_your_top_school/,

I just got my grades back. I took a 2 credit half-course and got an A in that, since it's mostly attendance and discussion based on light reading. I withdrew from my bio course (shows up as a W on the transcript), failed my chem course, got a D in Spanish, and got a C- on my sociology class. I feel like I really did burn out since end of high school/first year of college, which I finished with a 3.3

I can't get stressed about grades, I don't give a f**k about them. I reason with myself that they are important, but the emotional aspect of getting worried about grades doesn't kick in, as it did in high school, where I'd lose sleep over a B+ on a test. I'm really afraid that I might get kicked out of my college, and I've worked so hard in high school to get in. Hopefully, I can petition to my adviser, get good grades in summer school courses, and get some counseling during the upcoming school semester to get my life back on track. I can at least be satisfied with a required leave of absence, at the end of which I can return to my college as a normal student.

In the worst case scenario that I get kicked out, what are my options? Do I just transfer to a lower local university and get good grades there until I might transfer to a better college? Where's a good place that I can get help besides my academic adviser?

Any help is appreciated. ,17,2,5,http://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/p3atb/likely_expulsion_or_long_suspension_from_nursing/,"Hi reddit. My wife made a horrible decision and has imperiled my family.  She has been a fantastic student so far. She comes from a 4th grade education and what you could barely call home schooling by her neglectful parents. She has been straight A so far through all pre-reqs and first year of nursing school. 

At the end of the last semester, she was required to take an ATI remediation exam prior to the final. usually, you get feedback about wrong answers on this open-book test, but in this case there was none. She was spending hours upon hours retaking the same damn test and losing study time needed for the final. She decided it would be ok to collaborate with a friend since it was an open-book test. 

A classmate found out, and reported it. She had the hearing, and she was definitely antagonized a bit by the school board. Now she has one final appeal to the dean, and i think the decision will stand.

"" 1) A grade of an F be submitted for NAME for Nursing 218: Maternal Newborn Nursing Concepts
2) NAME be suspended from the nursing program for a period of one year. She should be allowed to re-enroll in Spring 2013.
3) NAME re-enroll in the Nursing program with Academic Santions imposed to include:
ineligible to apply for the Scholarship,
ineligible to hold an office in the student nursing associaiton on campus
exclusion from participation in privileged academic activities (e.g. SHP Recognition Ceremony, Nursing Pinning Ceremony, etc.)
Although this is perhaps not the outcome you had hoped for it is in keeping with prior Honor Council Decisions. Such behavior swill not be tolerated in teh SHP and student must take the Honor Code seriously in all aspects of academic classroom activities. You are training to enter a profession in which the public has placed a great deal of trust and you must embrace and uphold these values.""

You hae 5 days in which to provide written comments to the Dean of SHP before a final decision is made

I am devastated. I can only compare this to me drinking and driving and losing my ability to work and support my family. We killed ourselves for her to get her through this year, and now we have to deal with this. I really hate this because of how hard my kids have taken her being gone so much to study. i always felt like it was worth it to provide a better future for them. But now, who knows what will be.

Thanks for the vent reddit...  ;(

I feel like there really isn't much place to go since I don't really know anyone who has gone to college. 

Can one semester (Second Semester as a Freshman) completely destroy my chance of a good GPA? 

First off, I'm not incredibly intelligent or anything. I'm a B average student; probably get B's, maybe one A (my entire college career), and C's every once in a while. 
However for this one semester I have failed one class and there is nothing I can do to help my grade (I have a 46% average probably) although it's not a class that has anything to do with my Major it's still a ""General Education"" requirement. 
Doing horrible in another class (that is involved with my major) and the rest of my classes I'll probably pass (Probably with a B/B+). 
On top of all that I'm doing terrible with everything else. I don't manage my time well, have no idea what or when my Finals are, do homework usually last minute, and have otherwise been a pretty terrible student... This one semester. I did good my first semester, but so terrible this time?

I'm going to be a HS senior this upcoming year, and finally had a 'talk' with my mom about finances (which she had tactfully managed to evade). I asked her point blank what she could afford, and asked her if she would run net price calculators with me. 

So we did. We ran tons of them; we ran the one for the state U, the state U flagship, some private colleges, and an Ivy for shits and giggles. I know these things aren't 100% accurate but I wanted to give my parents an idea of how much it would cost.

And guess what? Every fucking school costs the same out of pocket. The state U's will give no aid. The private colleges were generous with the aid, but they were more expensive to begin with. The 'cheapest' was UPenn, and I regretted to inform my parents that no, I am not Ivy material. 

The FAFSA was worse. My mom needed a refill on her wine when I told her the EFC's of each school. She told me that she can pay one year of these crazy EFC's, but no more. 

So what's a girl to do? Community college isn't an option. Commuting isn't an option. I'm glad that my parents told me I can apply anywhere I want because they all cost the same, but seriously, being middle-class in America sucks balls so bad. I can't wait to take out 75k in loans for my nursing degree.

Source: TA,16,2,3,http://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/1c1ora/why_you_should_get_to_know_your_ta_source_ta/,"A lot of students do just fine without ever going to discussion or office hours. I was certainly one of those students. But now, having been a TA, I gotta tell you that knowing your TA is a big advantage. Why? For one, we usually grade your tests and papers (especially in large, GE type classes). If we know you, we are more likely to give you the benefit of the doubt when something you've written on a test is confusing or poorly written. For example, we are more likely to think ""I know this student means 'X' because we talked about 'X' one-on-one in office hours"" instead of ""what does this student mean?"" or worse, ""this student is simply bullshitting me."" In any case, if we talk one-on-one in office hours, you are going to learn the material quickly and you are going to know exactly what I'm looking for on the final (or at least, how to phrase things right). 

Even if office hours aren't extremely helpful, you might still learn something interesting you hadn't thought about. Or maybe you just get some good life advice. After all, most TA's are grad students who were successful in their major in college and did some cool stuff (we like to think so, anyway).

And although you probably won't need a letter of recommendation from us (as usually professors do that), it's always nice to have back ups. Who knows? If you have science TAs, they may even know about research or projects that are looking for undergrad assistants.

Finally, we care about the subject and your success. Well, some of us. And if you go out of the way to take interest in the subject, then we are going to go out of our way to make discussion interesting and challenging for you as well. This way, everyone wins.

Of course, you have to put in a little effort first. Some students never go to class and don't do the reading and then want their TA to teach them everything in office hours in a span of 30 minutes. That's just not fair to either of us, and I won't be happy with you. But with a little preparation, I guarantee that getting to know your TA is a worthwhile thing to do--for grades, life, or otherwise. 

Just my two cents. Good luck!",,False,,t5_2qh3z,False,,,True,t3_1c1ora,http://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/1c1ora/why_you_should_get_to_know_your_ta_source_ta/,

1363808522.0,12,self.college,1aol47,Today I woke up to a call from a bill collector at my university...,14,2,1,http://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/1aol47/today_i_woke_up_to_a_call_from_a_bill_collector/,"Warning: This is a bit of a rant, a bit of me getting things off my chest and a bit of trying to cope with the stress of the past half a year.

Last November I withdrew from college. I left with a good GPA, but the pressure was a little too much. I needed a break. Between financial instability and the stress of a STEM major, I decided that it would be good for me to just work for a semester and come back this Spring.

I didn't come to the decision lightly, but it was the death of a family member that caused me to finally trudge up to the counselor's office and ask for a withdrawal. I can't remember the last time I felt so ashamed of myself. I withdrew, noted that I desired to come back next semester, grabbed the readmission papers and went on my way.

In January, I found out that my school charged me $5,000 for withdrawing. My school's policy is that if you withdraw after the 60% mark of the semester, you don't have to pay back any of the financial aid you received. The date in question that they reference is the date you last attended class. I attended class last on the 29th of October. The 60% mark was the 30th. My counselor never mentioned this fact, even after I specifically asked her the implications for my financial aid. (Yes, $5,000 is about 40% of my aid. I am an independent student who receives little-to-no assistance from either parent).

Now, as someone who is in his early twenties and came to college with nothing financially, I don't exactly have that kind of money just lying around. Neither do any of my family members, at least that they'd be willing to give me. It makes things a little more complicated when nobody in my family knows I withdrew. I still live in the city that I go to school in, close to where my local family lives. Since November, I've done everything in my power to dodge concrete questions about my education. All they know is what I've told them: I'm really busy and the school is charging me money for something that is their fault. They also know that if I don't fix this, that I can't go back to school (true, since unless my balance is $0 they won't accept my readmission).

If I had the choice, I wouldn't have told them. But my school started sending invoices to my mother. I changed my permanent address as a result.

There was a silver lining though: I had still be attending class while my withdrawal was still in limbo. They give you ten days to think about it before they process your withdrawal, and I was attending one of the only classes I did like in the meanwhile. I got a letter from the teacher, and headed over to the counselor's office.

No sell. I had to go higher up in the bureaucracy if I wanted to get my date of last attendance fixed. I started asking the Director of Undergraduate Advising at my school, only to be ignored. Of the six emails I sent her, I got two responses. When I went to her office, I was held back by her secretary, who instead relayed the information her boss IM'ed her. I had started to become ""That Guy"", everytime I tell someone my name now, people seem to recognize who I am within the system.

Finally, I got an answer. I had to go to the head of the department and get confirmation that I had attended class. Okay, no problem. I did it within 24 hours, scanned it, emailed it, hand-delivered the physical copy and sent her a confirmation email. No reply. To any of them.

At this point, the date where I would have wanted to start my readmission process had already passed. I decided that I was wasting my time, so I went to the financial aid office. As I suspected, the Director had not done what she had told me she would, and that my date of last attendance had not been altered. Finally though, I got a breath of fresh air. A man named Michael (who I know reads Reddit and if you're reading this, I want you to know how eternally grateful I am to you for being the first person to actually do something to help me) filed a ticket with the Registrar. I was given a phone number, and with in the next few days, I got in touch with a man who altered my date.

Then I checked my balance a few days later, and nothing. No change, no billing inquiries, no nothing. I went to the financial aid office again, only to find out that the billing office is putting me off. Another ticket was filed, and my contact information noted.

This morning I woke up to a call from a bill collector. I tried to explain to her the rules that are noted on their website, and how I am not obligated to pay back these fees. How I am getting it fixed with financial aid. Never in my life have I felt someone treat me like such an idiot, even when I have cited parts of their own policy to them. This woman had no idea what she was talking about, and used any and all missteps in my method to criticize me.

I've prepared for the worst at this point. I'm sending out my resume, looking for jobs to replace the student career position I will lose if I don't reapply soon (in my field would be nice, but you never know). I'm working as much as I can to buy myself some time if I need to live off my savings for a while. I'm trying to come up to what I'm going to say to my parents when they inevitably ask me for the whole story. I've signed up for community college courses in an attempt to keep my degree in the works and to stave off my student loans.

The worst part about it is that if my counselor had said anything, if I hadn't read the policy wrong by just four little words, I would have told her I attended class the morning I withdrew, which was after the 60% mark. I would have never had to deal with this. Hopefully my efforts can make this all go away but you never know with bureaucracy.

Every single class (T/TH 1 hour, 10 minute classes) she lets us out after 20 minutes or totally cancels class. How can I learn if she is never teaching us? I am in Air Force ROTC and working my butt off to get good grades so I can be a pilot (3.6 last semester) and am shooting for a 4.0 this semester, but SHE NEVER TEACHES US ANYTHING. I go to every single class, never skip. I actually care, but its kind of hard to when she obviously does not. On the first exam I got an 85%, and I had a few questions to ask her about it, but ever since we got the test back she has canceled class. I emailed her a week ago to schedule office hours appointment (suprising, she doesnt have pre scheduled office hours either, ""by appointment only"") and havent heard anything back from her. We have a test March 26, and according to her syllabus schedule, we should be halfway through the unit, but we havent even started. And if I recieve a low grade on this next test, yes I know my schoolwork is my responsibly, but I am going to be pissed, because this is a class I should be acing, if the professor would actually show up and teach. There is a reason we have class.

What should I do? Aside from trying my hardest, and wanting to actually care, and working to get a 4.0, I am actually paying for this class, I figured $30 per day, and when she cancels class, this is valuable money I should be paying for her to teach me. I go to a large in state university, so who should I go talk to? Because I am pretty mad. I want an A, and I put in the effort, and when she does not show up, I am simply angry, because I am not getting what I paid for, or the grade I am working towards. What do I do?

We all have our special reasons (or someones) for going to class, and it  isn't because we are actually interested in hearing what the professor has to say. 

So when you walk into your first class in the next couple of weeks and find that special cutie to actually show up to and dress like a human for, here's how to break the ice (and it doesn't include any polar bears). 

1. “I heard the professor is really hard.”

Ask if they have read the reviews on the professor. Make up a bogus ‘friend of a friend’ who took the class. The more elaborate story, the better.

2. “Are you taking this class for your major/general requirements?”
Whatever their answer, reply with “Oh, me too. What major? Which requirement?”

3. “Did you get the textbook for this class yet?”
There’s a reason for #brokecollegestudent. Your whole budget and barista paycheck and summer savings all somehow end up going to the five textbooks your professor put on the syllabus but won’t actually even lecture from. No matter what their major, all college students minor in complaining.

4. “Is this seat taken?”
This is also an excuse to show up to class a little late. If you’re not ready to jump into introductions, ask if you’ve missed anything yet.

5. “Do you know if he put the syllabus up somewhere?”
Pretend you never heard where the professor actually put it. Even if you’re one of those that have it printed out and hole-punched in a binder for the first day of class, just don’t and ask so they can now tell you what’s on the syllabus.

6. “Are you a –whatever- year?”
Follow their answer up with a, “Oh I just heard that all –whatever- years take this class? I don’t know, I mean I’m a –whatever- year”. That’s usually enough to start off the recycled topics of “How do you like it? What else are you taking? and Do you live in the dorms?”...

7. “Hey, weren’t you in my psych class last semester?”
Make up some characteristic you ‘remember,' so it sounds less like a line at a frat party. “Yeah, didn’t you always sit at the back of the class?"" When they say no, just laugh and let them know they have a twin on campus.

8. “Did you see that game?”
If you don’t actually know of any games, just hope they do. Who knows? You might get lucky (in more ways than one).

9. “Which TA do you have?”
Move the conversation to share about last semester’s TA from hell. Everyone’s had one of those.

10. “Do you know when the activities fair is?”
Ask about any school event – advanced screening, football game, Chinese Student Union dumpling night mixer. You can even pull out your phone and pretend a friend texted you to ask. You might even work an invite into the conversation if it goes well!",,False,,t5_2qh3z,False,,,True,t3_169qi2,http://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/169qi2/how_to_talk_to_your_crush_in_lecture_hall/,

I'm a commuter and I have been commuting since last year (I'm a sophomore now) and I originally came into college with the mentality of just rushing through it and getting out as quickly as I can so I minimize the effects of debt. Well, I have achieved that because I'm on pace to graduate next year if I so desire. However, after freshmen year, my entire mindset changed...I want to experience the college life..I wasn't much of a social person in high school and until senior year I didn't really have that many friends...and now I'm facing something similar now. I mean I still have my high school friends here but I want to meet other people just like a lot of them have. My grades are beyond fine I'm a comp eng major with a 3.9+ GPA and I work a shitty job that I hate that is completely unrelated to comp eng for 15-20 hours a week. I've applied for transfer to several schools in the top 10 range for computer engineering but I'm being pretty realistic that I won't get into the ones I really want to go to...so I am assuming that I will be here for my final year/2 years if I choose to slow it down. I've been thinking that I should join a fraternity just for fun...a couple of my friends are in them and it seems they have all the connections and are really happy being in them. I'm in the computer engineering club and I did meet a few kids but none that have become really good friends. I don't even know if transferring would work...I've read that a lot of transfers feel its hard to make friends when you transfer because social circles have already been made. So I'm really thinking of just joining a frat because it seems like a good way to make really close friends and even though I'm sure pledging will be hard I feel like it well be worth it if I pick a frat that is reasonable. Anyway...what do you guys think? What should I do? I'm pretty lost right now and I don't want to sit here every year being depressed I want to change something....BTW... I have every intention of dropping the job if I choose to join a fraternity, transfer, w/e it may be... I need to do something to keep myself happy even if ""career-wise"" or anything else it would be better to keep sane


EDIT2*** I also forgot to mention that delaying graduation by a year will NOT cripple me in anyway financially..I am blessed to have parents who have saved up A LOT of money for my education and since I go to a state school + am on a scholarship for the next 2 years anyway I will be paying comparatively very VERY little

I don't really have much in common with my generation.  I don't like rap, I can't dance for shit, and I don't really like the taste of alcohol.  Add some social anxiety to that and you've got my current situation.

I'm a month into college, and for four Fridays and Saturdays, I've sat in my dorm room doing absolutely nothing.  Browsing Reddit, playing Xbox by myself, usually offline (the wifi is spotty on the 12th floor), things like that.  I look all around me and see people connecting.  I have made two or three friends while I've been here, but the awkwardness and hesitation plays into me not really actively trying to hang out with them.  I'm usually okay on my own, but lately I've been feeling kinda lonely.  I really don't know how to push myself to go do things or meet people I don't expect to have anything in common with.  

Is there anything I can do?  I WANT to meet people.  I WANT to find someone who I really do connect with.  College is usually the place to do that, but it seems I'm not doing well with it.  Part of the reason I feel so isolated is because my major is Language Studies and I want to get into the JET program to teach English in Japan, which inevitably means I'd be leaving the States after college.  It feels like anything I would try to create now, relationship or friendship, would automatically have a time limit on it.  I'm not the partying kind of person.  I'm not a drinker.  I don't smoke cigarettes.  Haven't met anyone who smokes weed but I really don't want to get caught high/in possession, especially my freshman year.  I'm sorry for the wall of text but I needed some place to vent tonight.

Update/edit: thanks for the answers.  The general consensus I'm getting is that for an introvert, it just takes a little more time and a LOT more effort to find people of similar tastes in a college setting.  It's only a month into my freshman year, so I'm probably coming off as a bit impatient.  Thanks again for the answers.

Visit /r/fitness and /r/loseit for more info and inspiration  
- eat healthy (there will be healthy choices in the food plan) and limit liquid calories your first semester. sorry, this means beer. food and booze will be your toughest opponent.  For greater progress, count calories and cut out liquid calories.  visit /r/loseit for more details  
- your university will have a decent gym, use it 3-4 times a week. My recommendation is do a program like starting strength, this is great for males and females. but you can check out /r/fitness for other ideas  
- join a group that is into fitness (rugby, rowing, rock climbing, roller derby, there may even be some non ""r"" groups outs there).  
- and for the love of god, go to class and get sleep.  
I know this seems like a tremendous sacrifice your first semester at college, and it is, but it will set you up for success the remaining 3 1/2 years.

And then think how much easier it will be to attract the gender of your choice when you look amazing. Once you reach your goals you can adjust accordingly but continue to monitor yourself and don't let it slip.

I could have gone to Ohio State, but the cost was too high, I thought. It was close to home, I saved a decent amount of cash by staying at home, and got through OK. Then came grad school, and thankfully, it was only a year.

When med school rolled around, the med school there was my 9th choice. It was my safety school, in a sense. I didn't want to go there, but I couldn't take a year off and apply again later thanks to loans.

My BS is framed in cherrywood with midnight blue and gold trim. Master's, the same. My MD? It's in a $9 frame from Target to keep the dust off, but not even on the wall. 

Over the last decade, the decay I've seen in the institution is amazing. The college I graduated from is dead- the century-old A&amp;S is now Natural Sciences and Math or some such bullshit. The honors program is now somehow its own tiny college (maybe 100 students, tops)- and pre-med is now an accepted major. That never flew back when I applied in 2000- we laughed at schools that offered pre-anything as a major, because what if you changed your mind?

The med school that once was a regional leader has slipped to an also-ran under their guidance. Pharmacy got thrown on that campus, and there are rumors that they're going to put a dental school there as well. This all after the Law school nearly lost accreditation in the early 2000s due to low Bar passage. They shouldn't add another professional program, fix what you have!

It's been 13 years since I started there. Now, as a physician, I'm looking for an online MBA. No chance am I going back there- I'm tired of explaining to out-of-towners where it is!

So I go to a school in China. And in these schools, there are all of these Asian international students going to these schools so that they'll have a high chance of getting into the American and British colleges. Most of these people I know are actually rich, local Chinese kids (their parents go as far as spending lots of money and somehow getting them American passports to go to these international schools). 

Everyday I hear these local classmates saying, ""Oh I'm applying to the UCs. Oh I'll go to NYU. USC"". Seriously, they are all going to apply at the UCs.. a huge vast majority of people at my school.. only care about the UCs or those other California universities. Another large amount of kids apply to Brown, Northwestern, and NYU. 

So why do I make this post? What problem do I want to address? 

International students pay more in tuition. Universities are constantly running out of money or want money (*cough* NYU). These rich international students... do they somewhat have a higher chance of getting accepted because they are not qualified for financial aid AND they can afford the whole tuition and housing fees? Is it a problem that these students are filling up public universities such as the UCs?

And it's not only that. At my school, it's ridiculously easy for anyone to take the IB program (really rigorous and prestigious academic program) or as many APs as he/she wants. So you have all these spoiled, procrastinating (but a lot of them are smart since they've been well educated), and UCs obsessed kids taking all these AP classes and having 3.5+ GPAs. Not to mention they spend thousands on SAT prep programs and tens of thousands on college counseling. Literally if they rack up thousands of dollars (in chinese rmb) they have these people telling them the specific GPA, SAT test scores, extracurriculars, and hours of community service they must do in order to get into their top choice. 

What disturbs me the most is that my school is one out of hundreds of schools like these. Is this a problem? Could this be a problem? Could this be affecting college acceptance rates? 

Tl;dr: Are well off international students a problem to the American college system? Could they be? 

Edit: Sure this could lean towards.. is there possibly more inequality and unfair prioritization.. but it just kind of disturbs me. Because while there are international students paying even more fees, there's also lots of international students who can't afford expensive tuition even if they are top of the class (people like these at my school, which is very rare go to British colleges because those colleges are cheaper).

I'm in a school where resources for networking and internships are plentiful, but since I was pre-med and was instead focused on volunteering hours and shadowing physicians I never really utilized them. Now that I may be dropping pre-med and have no idea what to do with my life yet I'm kind of in a tough spot.


Internships are likely out of the question. I have had a job as a research assistant since September and would still consider doing additional research over the summer, but so far I've had no luck with that. Right now all I have is volunteering over the summer at a hospital and possibly an animal shelter, and I may be thinking about grabbing a summer job at a Best Buy or wherever I can improve professional communication skills with customers and people in general.

Long story short, I'm a Computer Science major who doesn't see myself with a future that involves any sort of engineering or programming. I just get by in my programming classes and I feel like everyone has advanced so far ahead of me. I'm very frustrated because the beginner classes on Computer Programming here were hardly beginner and I feel like I have been launched into something that I no longer enjoy.

I see myself as a web master, web developer, web assistant, or web designer. Someone who manages a website for a business and constantly makes sure it is updated and things of that sort. Either that or I want to be part of a team that designs websites for upcoming firms and collaborates together.

I just don't think that Computer Science is the right major for what I want to do in the future. Can anyone help me or provide me with their experience?

**Edit 2/25/13:** So I'm thinking that I will actually stay in Computer Science and get through my one shitty professor this semester and maybe take on a double minor of Information Systems and Web Media.

I worked in food cafe's all throughout freshman year and for fall semester of sophomore year before my work study was cut off. My aid was cut off because my family makes too much money in order for me to receive work study. I really have no clue why it was even offered to me freshman year and the financial aid office couldn't really explain why either.

Most of the jobs on campus require work study, so I didn't work again after that. When I wasn't working I noticed my grades and overall class performance increased. I wasn't getting bad grades or anything, but for the tuition my parents are paying for I was disappointed to see I was only getting B's. I made deans list twice ever since I stopped working, and I believe the extra 10-15 hours I have a week contributes to that. I'm a fine arts major so I have a lot of extremely consuming projects which require 100% of my effort and time. 

Knowing this, I am reluctant to start working again. There is a job opening at the bookstore that's accepting non-work study students and I can easily apply. I know 10-15 hours a week sounds like nothing but it really helps a lot to have the extra time. It doesn't help that each individual art class is 4 1/2 hours long and eats up the entire day (1:30pm - 6pm). On top of my art classes I have regular academic classes too. I also make time for my boyfriend/friends, go on trips to NYC on the weekends (usually a requirement for class), workout regularly, go out, etc. I don't have much room in my schedule to work but I'm desperate for money. I can barely survive the school year with my summer job salary (about $1300), and unfortunately this year I had quite a couple of other expenses to take care of. I spent a lot of money on kitchen items (microwave, coffee maker, etc) and also had to pay to repair my Macbook, a ticket fine, groceries, and other things. Painting supplies are ridiculously expensive and I'm constantly shelling out money to buy canvas, gesso, stretchers, paint, etc. 

I don't ask to borrow money that much from my parents and if I do they will give me $100 or $50 from time to time which barely covers the cost of anything.

I'll start...,14,2,8,http://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/y4b72/whats_your_worst_college_admin_experience_ill/,"We have this thing in GA called the HOPE scholarship.  People who graduate from public and private HS's get it if they have above a certain GPA.  Because of an illness pretty much all 4 years of HS, I was home schooled.

When I was admitted to college #1, all they wanted was my transcript.  Boom, book it, done.

I came back home to work on the family farm after realizing that the degree program I'd moved hundreds of miles for was a ripoff, and went back to school a couple years later.

In October '10, I applied to a local community college just to get the 30 hours needed to receive HOPE.  I gave them my HS transcript, just as the other college, and everything seemed just fine.  I kept checking in with them to find out the progress, as my online info wasn't updating.  They kept promising someone would get back to me.  I was applying for Spring '11, so by finals week of that fall, I had had enough.  I drove over an hour to the college's main campus, and camped out until someone would speak to me in detail.  After an hour and a half, I threatened to go speak to the provost, and they finally let me talk to an admissions officer.

Come to find out, the Georgia Community College (can I name names here?) wanted a syllabus from every single class I took in HS, with a listing of what each item in that syllabus meant.  My mom had most of the syllabi, but she never expected that that kind of thing would ever be needed, so I had to put a lot of them together myself while working 60+ hours, 7 days a week.  I was told that because I had waited so late in the semester to provide the required forms, it was unlikely that I would be able to enroll in the spring.  This is despite never having been told they needed anything like this.  There was no way to search for it on their site (don't even get me started on that one) and no one answering the phones knew about these requirements, but I could have come up there at any time (M-TR, 9-4:30) to see a physical form.

I handed them a 3 ring binder, 1.5"" thick, documenting everything I'd done in HS in early December.

I didn't get in for that spring.

It took them a month and a half to review my documents.  I checked every day, and called frequently.  Finally it was processed.  But there was something new on my requirements.

I had to get a tetanus shot.  Mine was 1 year and 4 days out of due, so I had to get another one.  It took them a business week to process that form.  At this point, I'm exhausted, I had a bad reaction to the shot, but I figure everything should be fine.  I'm officially admitted to the school.

Come time for registration, with one day to spare before classes are closed to registration, I'm told I'm missing shot records from MIDDLE SCHOOL.  The only copy is with my HS I attended briefly, an hour in the other direction, and I need to have it back to them in order to register.  The school cannot fax it.  I drive over, pick it up, and break down in the school nurse's office.  20 years old, in front of 15 and 16 year olds.  I then drove the shot records back, where I ask to make a copy.  They take the original, telling me that they're making a copy, and I'm told I can never have it back.  No copy.  Once they have it, it's theirs forever.  I don't have another copy, and will have to get the shots again if I ever need records.

It's now May 30, 2011 or so.  Class starts the first week of June.  I'm finally in, they finally have everything.  I started in October '10.

Leaving that place was almost as hard as getting into it, but that's another story.

What I've Learned:

1) Have an ""on campus"" social schedule.  It's really hard to stick to, but having a general idea of when you're going to be there will help tremendously.

2) Don't be embarrassed to go to sleep at 9pm if that's what it takes.  I have 8am classes, I have to be there at least 30 mins early to get a parking spot, which means I have to leave before 6:30am.

3) Invest in your car.  Don't neglect your only means of getting to school.

4) Make friends with the librarians, make use of private study rooms.  I had a buddy last semester that would check out reddit for 2 hours while I napped, then vice versa.

I'd like to study astronomy, but I don't know very much about physics or know what kind of job I could get with that degree. I think my biggest interest, my life goal if you will, is social reform.

Am i being an idiot?",12,0,11,http://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/18d3fi/im_leaving_my_current_better_university_to_return/,"Basically, when i was at my old university, i thought i could do a lot better. So i wanted to try and transfer to UCLA or somewhere as good. Now that i'm at UCLA, i don't really like how competitive and insanely difficult all of this is. I'm doing alright in my classes here, but my motivation and interest is really going down the drain.

My old school is still a top 100 program for my major, but its definitely no UCLA. I felt like my classes were better at my old school cause not everyone was trying to be the next smartest person, and professors were more engaged and approachable. I feel like the quality of my education was better at my old school. 

On top of that, at my old school, i did a lot of things outside the classroom that i liked (surfing, hiking, etc), that i don't seem to have the time or ability to do here in LA. Since i've gotten here, i've definitely been a less happy person, and that's why i'm really thinking about going back, because quality of life is a huge thing to consider.

But i cant help but feel like a bit of a 'failure' or something for leaving such a 'great' school. 

My thoughts are that you shouldn't ever be doing something that you're not cool with. I'm not really cool with doing this UCLA thing, i spend most of my time playing tennis to get my mind off of school, and then come home and sit around alone. I feel like i'd be happier and more into school at my old university, and it was definitely more my speed there. 

At the same time i don't want to just be 'giving up', although i don't really feel like i am, i know that's how it could seem. I just don't enjoy the pace and the stresses here, and preferred the way of life my old school offered.

So I study at a college in Germany that claims to be based on the American college system. Fact is, it is anything but that. There are hardly any sports on campus and it's only academics that seem to be in the air, and a really pathetic form of them. It's quite normal to take 8-10 courses per semester here, but the worst part is that even after studying for about a year here, I can pretty safely say that there is hardly anything that I learnt here. The instructors and professors are boring and grade you in a way that is simply weird. Unlike US colleges, the grades aren't adjusted based on the whole class's performance, and the professors can make an exam really tough (which they definitely do) and give the whole class crappy grades at the end of the year. Studying here has made me realize that I am just throwing 3 years of my life away. I loved to study, but I don't think I even want to do my Masters now. I just wish that society didn't expect of us to have these useless degrees and I could read a shitload of books on my own and figure out my life without having to deal with people and institutions who just play with your life. The worst part is this college was my safety college. I had awesome high school grades, essays, SATs and extra-curriculars but I either didn't get enough aid from US colleges or got wait-listed/ rejected from them (I'm an international student). I came to my current college because they claimed to have excellent ties with universities around the world, had a diverse student body (which is true, but only comprises 1200 students in total), and were world renowned and other similar shit. Fact is, there are hardly any good clubs on campus, no good parties and you get tired of walking around the same small campus watching the same people everyday, and you can't go off campus a lot because of the fucking shitload of courses they force you to take every semester. Anyhow, these are my ramblings in a moment of utter frustration and I could really use your thoughts and inputs. For me, it's getting hard to stay positive! :/

EDIT 1: I didn't mention the name of my college before, but since someone guessed it (from his friend's equally bad review of it) I don't suppose it could harm mentioning it. It's Jacobs University in Bremen, and given a second choice, I would never in a million years have come here. I can't believe how fucked up life can be. I worked SO hard in high school, always got As, was top of my class, excellent SATs, essays and ECs and I still ended in a shit hole. I've just stopped studying or giving a fuck about academics or anything related to it. It's all just luck, and in the full scheme of things I doubt hard work matters anymore. What is worse is that some professors just refuse to accept that they are wrong. One particular genius deducted marks because he didn't know that atoms and molecules don't necessarily have the same weight (other than noble gases etc). When I asked him to correct it, he just didn't care and stalled it to the point that I just became frustrated and gave up on it. Seriously Reddit, I just don't know why this world doesn't value creativity and concepts more than just learning stuff without understanding it. I've seen people who don't deserve shit, get way too lucky than they deserve to be. Ask them something and they might answer it. Ask them the concept behind it, and they'll turn to stone.
And when you go and apply for a job, the employers will just select those dickheads because they somehow manage to get a better GPA which they don't deserve. I might sound jealous, but trust me, if you went through what I've suffered you would more than understand how hard I worked and how meaningless everything seems now.",,False,,t5_2qh3z,1350854226.0,,,True,t3_11tvuu,http://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/11tvuu/i_hate_my_collegego_ahead_and_let_me_know_what/,

Today, I want to share with you something that gave me motivation back into engineering way more than ever.
I always had the idea of that major since I was a little girl but today, for some odd reason, motivation hit me again.

I was in my Calculus class  and some guy kept going back and forth outside of the class to keep talking on the phone. Then when my classmate got up for the 100th time, once he went out, my teacher decided to go and lock the door. 
This is what he said: ""I cannot believe people are slaves over technology. Why do ""kids"" get attracted over some little device that can kill you or get your distracted from the big things like math"" -Everyone laughed-
""I think everyone should see a movie, I forgot what it's called but it's about a man, he worked in a factory where those technology devices are made. He develop a pattern on how to handle things because f his job and then he did the same in his house"" -doing a weird hand gesture thing-
""I don't get why kids would keep texting and calling all day, it can wait. Why not do something for yourself and become creators, Be thinkers and inventors, not consumers. I see all of you being consumers, don't you want to make something out of yourselves and create something and be proud of it?""
""I only make ten texts messages per year and I think that's too much, I see when I make more than 10, I have to stop -he laughed-""
Then he continue on with the lecture...

All of those quotes, he really said it. It kind of got stuck in my head. I see that he got frustrated how the guy kept going back and forth during class session. If I was him , I would lock the door too so he won't get in, to teach him a lesson.
But The last few things hit me. I want to create something out of myself, I want to create things, be an inventor, change the world. I don't want to be a consumer,a follower, or as he said it ""slave to technology"".

Btw, he let the guy in after a long while but he felt very embarrassed since we sort of all stared at him haha.

I believe if you start off strong with great habits (studying in particular) it will be a ton easier to continue the rest of the semester. Too often I put more and more stress on myself due to rough starts and digging out of the hole. 

First and foremost I have to put a strong emphasis on getting adequate sleep, eating healthy, and exercising every day. On the school side I've started to do a few things to eventually be so prepared that I'm almost *excited* for school to begin. Here's some it so far:

* Went to Amazon for some school essentials shopping. Spent more to aim for supplies that I'd really appreciate.. Got a [sweet mini stapler](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003CTFC0O/ref=ox_sc_act_title_5?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1&amp;smid=ATVPDKIKX0DER), a [dozen of the stellar sharpie pens](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001B66DXU/ref=ox_sc_act_title_1?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1&amp;smid=ATVPDKIKX0DER), these highly recommended [highlighters](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00260S0L8/ref=ox_sc_act_title_7?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1&amp;smid=ATVPDKIKX0DER), and most importantly this great [weekly planner](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0088VSJQU/ref=ox_sc_act_title_8?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1&amp;smid=A3G2RBEZBLAJ53) that fits in your pocket.

* Created a Fall Semester bookmark folder on my bookmarks toolbar with folders for each individual class, as well as important school information like the calendar and job search folders.

What do you find successful in getting off to a hot start? For instance, reading and printing out the syllabus for each class before school starts. There's plenty more I'll add tomorrow but it's almost 5 AM and I'm hitting the sack.",,False,,t5_2qh3z,False,,,True,t3_1kjiqj,http://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/1kjiqj/tips_on_starting_the_semester_on_the_right_foot/,

GO TO CLASS.

My freshman year I had a good GPA and I got kinda cocky thinking school was a breeze, so I started smoking pot and skipping a lot sophomore year.  Nothing wrong with smoking on occasion, but if you smoke every day and staying up late like I did and start skipping, it starts to take effect quickly and eventually you're so deep that you can't get out of it.

I'm not telling your guys this to earn sympathy or something, I fucked up and I'm just telling you guys this story so I can hopefully influence at least one person in the future.

I fucked up my GPA- immediate effects are that my dad wants me to pay him back the tuition from this past year.  Thankfully my mom is a little nicer so rather than owing $10k, I owe $5k.  So, I got a job for this summer to pay my dad back.  This job, although paying me ""well"", requires me to make major sacrifices.  I'm working near 40 hours a week and I work from 4am to noon every weekday.  By the end of summer, I will have made no money because it will all go to my dad.

Effects for the future- Honestly, it looks unlikely I can get a good internship next summer, so applying for jobs my senior year will be much more difficult.  I hope I can raise my GPA quickly enough to make my resume decent by then.

Note: Despite fucking up sophomore year, I was never placed on academic probation because my overall GPA stayed above 2.0.  If you ever find yourself on academic probation, I wish you the best of luck and know that you will probably have to get rid of your social life until you fix your GPA.",,False,,t5_2qh3z,False,,,True,t3_1g8t4s,http://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/1g8t4s/advice_from_an_older_college_student_to_entering/,

Apparently some people don't take criticism very well......

Hi XXXXX,

After leaving the exam, I had a few thoughts I think would be helpful to you next year.

The material on the final was not representative of the in-class discussions.  We had touched on land-lord tenant law very briefly at the end of last week, and it was roughly 25% of the exam.  We spent a whole class on anti-trust law and there was maybe 4 questions on it.  As a suggestion, I believe it would be in the students best interest for you to go more in-depth with land-lard tenant if you are going to cover it so heavily on the exam and just briefly touch on anti-trust law.  You made it seem like anti-trust law was more important than land-lord tenant.

On another note, I really enjoyed your class this semester.  The material was extremely interesting and your real life examples made it applicable and easier to understand.

Have a great summer!

XXXXXXX


Response:

Dear Ms. XXXXXXXX,
 
I have been extremely fair with this class, adding assignments, study guides, very fair with curves.  Your email is very disrespectful.  I talked at length about landlord tenant law, did an outline.  The class is responsible for all the reading materials.  It appears my generosity this semester led many to believe that they did not have to come to class or read any of the materials provided. 
 
I am sorry you felt ill prepared.

I'll be a senior, technically, but I'm behind due to transfer issues from a few years ago.  I'll also be living off campus (but close-ish), if that makes a difference.

The way my schedule worked out, I'll only have classes on Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays.  Of course, each of those days is five classes straight through from 8:50am to 2:05pm.  There will only be a ten minute break between classes, so that's really only enough time to get to the next class.  I'll have two 100-level, one 300-level, and two 400-level classes.

On the one hand, this seems pretty sweet.  I'll have four days per week without classes.  Thinking about it, 8:50-2:05 is less time than you put into a day of high school, so I don't think it'll be that bad.

On the other hand, I am not a morning person.  The only reason I chose early classes is because one of the 400-level ones is for my major, and there's not getting around it.  This means that for these three days per week, I'll probably have to be up by 7:00am, maybe 7:30.  This sounds terrible to me, but perhaps I can get used to it.

I feel that if I retook my SAT, I could bring my score up to a 2300+, and that'd really help me get into the colleges I want. I guess my question is simply: Is it worth it to take the SAT again?

I was unsure how much detail to go into, but I thought I covered the the gist of everything well enough...thoughts? Thanks for the read. 

Dear Office of Financial Aid,

My name is ___________ and I am writing to you in hope that you will consider reinstating my financial aid for my upcoming semester at ___________. I entered the semester with high expectations of myself after transferring from another school from which I had a bad experience, but was quickly struck with severe depression. A perfect storm of sorts came through my life and essentially derailed my academic semester and life. In my best interest, I reluctantly withdrew from all my courses so I could focus on getting my life back on track. My depression affected my ability to focus and my motivation, and crippled my day to day life and general happiness. Everyday was mentally exhausting. The stress of everything happening so quickly brought me to what I can safely say was the lowest point in my life, to which I never wish to return. 

Over time, my motivation returns. I sought the aid of a therapist which has helped tremendously. I found other mediums to release stress, such as exercise. While this time has not been fun, I have grown tremendously as an individual. I am more experienced and prepared for the future, whatever it may bring. I feel as though I have been disillusioned to the hardships of life, and am seriously ready to take it on.

My plan for future academic semesters is very serious. I will be enrolled as a full time student(12+ units), but not overly so as to avoid too much stress. I will keep busy and studious to maintain my focus. I will fully apply myself in all of my courses, because I am confident in my self. I am aware of the resources the school has made available to me if I encounter any doubt. 
While I am still healing, I am more excited for the future than ever. Through this time I have formulated long term and short term goals for myself, both in and out of school. Thank you for you consideration of reinstating my financial aid, and hearing my brief story. This semester has been difficult, but I have grown exponentially. 

Thank you,

I'm 24 years old, I'd be turning 25 for the next upcoming semester (birthday is august3).  I had a pretty decent job making some pretty decent money at an insurance company in Chicago.  Long story short, I got laid off.  I have no degree and only SOME college (and when I say some, I mean like, 3-4 classes completed).

It's hard as fuck to find a job making as much money as I was making at my old job.  I don't want to downgrade myself taking a job for a significant less amount of money, plus unemployment right now is paying me more then some of my friends who are working 40 hours a week.

Here's my question, if I was to go back to school, is it to late for my age to live inside of dorms?  Do I get my own apartment?  How do I get my own apartment without having a job currently?

Is there anybody my age(24/25) here that ended up going back to a university full-time that could give me some insight?

Also, how would one go about paying for college without having a job?  I understand loans, but is there any recommended companies you'd recommend?  I get about 12,000 through fafsa per year..not sure if that means anything.

I'm a biology major and also doing pretty well in school (3.4 GPA). However, I'm really not sure that this is for me. I feel completely confused, scared to take harder classes (like Organic Chemistry), worried about my financial situation, etc. I go to a school that has classes on a *quarter system* and while sometimes I like this fact, most of the time I hate how quick the pace is. I came to learn and better myself, not scramble for good grades. With a good pace I will always get good grades. I don't know what other college I could transfer to but I am considering it. 

*I kind of just want to take a leave of absence to sort of what I want in my future, what I want my major to be, how I will balance everything out, where my time investments will be, what my financial situation will look like during and after college, what college I will ultimately attend, what my future career to be.*

Is this a good idea though? I'm 20 and a sophomore... would it be bad or really good to take time off to figure out who I want to be?

1334041019.0,9,self.college,s27zu,Have had no sleep in days. Writing my Thesis has made me crazy. I wrote a poem in my delirium.,10,1,1,http://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/s27zu/have_had_no_sleep_in_days_writing_my_thesis_has/,"I have been holed up in the Religious Studies lounge on the 2nd floor of a campus building  for the past three days getting my senior thesis done. Its going really well and I am writing like a champ. I like to work this way, alone up there. It has nice big windows, a big table, but only room enough for me and a whole bunch of religious texts and posters all over the place. I think they rubbed off on me because gradually little snippets of this poem started coming to me as I was working. Finally this morning I decided to try writing it on the white board in there. This thing, almost exactly as you see it minus some of the punctuation and capitalization and so on, flowed out of me in one go. I really like it. 

Some context: I have generally given up on my appearances this week, haven’t showered, probably have crazy blue eye rings. I kindof relish this for some reason, the work is going really well I am just pounding it out, drinking a lot of Red Bull energy drink (their slogan: Red Bull gives you wings!)  When I take breaks I like to look out the window and watch people walk by down alumni walk. They don’t know anything about the fervor that is going on up in this FORTRESS OF SOLITUDE.  

We have advisors assigned to us who help you with your thesis project and keep you on schedule. I actually do not curse my advisor but I have been hearing a lot of people doing so. I don’t think she knows how little I have slept because I try to keep up appearances (haha) around her so she doesn’t worry or know how I left so much of it to the last week. I had this conversation with her about how after I turn in my thesis, I get to go out and celebrate and she is left with a ton of work left to do. I thought that was sortof funny. Maybe you see that in the poem. 

Then I just took the religious imagery thing and ran with it. It kinda works!  I probably just made myself look like a huge egotist with the whole “I am the god of….” “peons…” etc. Just playing around, I envy those frolicking people with nothing but time.

_______
*The Fall From Grace*, or *Graceful Falling*, or
*Why One Does Not Write Their Thesis in the Religious Studies Lounge*
*****

Dawn breaks on the Day of Reckoning.

From the corner window in my Ivory Tower,

The Fortress of Solitude. I look down on you

Passing peons - you don’t know tenacity.

I am the embodiment of Lack. The God of 

Type – Return – Indent – Type. 

Benevolent though I am, you reward me

with disgusted gaze, when I descend

to walk among you in the 

Garden of Earthly Delights. 

One Day you too will know. 

Appearances, the fluff of

Societal norm, falter at the alter of Thesis. 

Did you expect this trial-by-fire would leave

You entirely unscathed? 

I am not, you are not, no man is

so pure a scholar, so unburdened

by the original sin, procrastination. 

Thus we repent, for want of wings. 

The blood of the spring Red Bull 

will be taken gulp by inglorious gulp.

Taken for our own in some hope 

that the advisor will pass us

over without Fail.

As if, with the outward appearance of rest

on our face, he will not know how often

we take the lords name in vain. 

The Lord Thesis, curse him! 

and the Advisor, though I suspect at this late hour, 

he bears a similar distrust in the eternal.

Ironic that he who holds the whip

also feels the sting, in the end, and perhaps yet

worse than all. For, having given up the ghost

of the almighty (may that day come swift),

ready heretics that we are, 

The Bacchanal will quite surely 

soften our memory of toil. 

And Advisors, we all know, defect to Apollo

If at all. And so it is left –

Thesis and his Advisor, fully vested.

While the laity 

At the witching hour, 

pour out the sacrament 

Toast to their loneliness..

I was fine a few weeks ago but now that it's so close I am stressed and it's all I am thinking about.  I'm so used to living at home, gonna be so weird but I guess change is for the better. High school was like yeahh w/e everyone thinks they are so cool, blah blah, big ass popularity contest that I really didn't like at all. So I really only had a few of friends that were bearable. I also had a moderate case of social anxiety (much improved now), which if you had that in high school then it was most likely hell for you. Outgoing people don't understand that people can actually be scared of what they are gonna say or how they are going to embarrass themselves next, but it can really affect your health, especially in high school. I am more confident now then a few months ago, but I still lack those memories and social experiences from high school that most people have. So my social skills and I guess how I act in certain situations with people in my age group are a bit sluggish. So yeah with that holding me back I never partied, never drank, never smoked weed, never got laid haha. American society is so damn pretentious these days though, kids pretty much have to do all that shit in high school now or you're a giant failure.

Thank you for taking the time to help me. Like I said, I'm 27 years old, and I've struggled for the better part of a decade figuring out what it is I ""want"" to do, and dreaded the loans/misery that would come with pursuing a career I disliked. So I avoided that decision &amp; dropped out of community college at 19. In the meantime, I worked, and I've done OK for a HS graduate (~30k/year) in a web development/IT position at a small business. Unfortunately, I feel I've hit the ceiling.

I **love** computers. I **love** technology. I've always enjoyed troubleshooting &amp; hands-on work. I love the idea of what future technology will bring to our lives, the integration of computers in every aspect of our world; that's what excites me. I want to be the guy that makes those systems work.

So when I think about a major in Computer Information Systems, why am I so concerned about my prospects? Being a ""Network Systems Admin"" or ""IT Specialist"" seems like exactly the kind of job I'd enjoy.

Am I really setting myself up for failure, pursuing the one career I could see myself enjoying? Can anyone here give me a success story in the CIS field?

Or... do I need to focus on a CS degree, even if I dread the idea of programming/math? I'm not an idiot, I just prefer the hands on, hardware-based, troubleshooting &amp; setup over monotonous coding &amp; programming. If I'm wrong about any of my assessments of either of these careers, please tell me.

I need answers, but I feel like everything I'm reading is telling me I won't find success. That CIS graduates are a dime a dozen. That these jobs will be ""phased out"" in the future.

WARNING: Bookrenter.com,11,2,2,http://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/16ybb5/renting_textbooks_warning_bookrentercom/,"I am hoping that by creating this thread I will be able to prevent other students from having to experience the hell I went through with this company. Please share, if you will! This past fall I decided that instead of purchasing the textbooks I needed for my classes I would opt to rent instead. The cost of renting the textbooks was significantly cheaper and I wouldn't be stuck with a textbook lying around my house collecting dust. I found a company called Bookrenter.com and rented two textbooks from them for a 60-day period. Near the end of my 60-day period I received an e-mail offering me $5 Tiki cash (basically online credit towards rentals) if I returned my textbooks early. Since I was essentially finished with the books I decided to take advantage of their offer.

I began the return process on their website and opted to return both textbooks in the same package. By doing so I was provided a link to print a return invoice and a return label. The invoice listed both textbooks with a check box next to each title. I checked that both textbooks were in the package. The website and the return invoice both stated that once the package had been scanned at the USPS that the textbooks would be considered returned. So, I carefully packaged both textbooks in the same package and headed for the post office. I was foolish enough not to request a tracking number AND I discarded the receipt (dumb, I know!) since I read that the books are considered returned upon the post office scanning the package. Nearly a week later I receive another e-mail from Bookrenter.com thanking me for returning one of the textbooks but that I still needed to return the other. The textbook that they supposedly did not receive happened to be the most expensive of the two! I immediately called the company with only my word that I returned both books (since I discarded my receipt from the post office). The representative stated that she would put in an inquiry to find out why my textbook was missing from the package.

This went on for nearly a month. I called customer service nearly a dozen times and I waited in the queue for 30 minutes or more each time! Eventually I wasn't even able to reach a customer representative but instead spoke with the company's ""answering service"". At this point I'm highly frustrated, the company has charged my debit card a late fee without my permission, and I cannot reach a customer service representative. I decide to research the company and Google search for ""Bookrenters.com Reviews"". I discover a number of different reviews with people warning others of this SAME issue. Why the hell didn't I search for reviews on the company before? From here, I decided to file a complaint with the Better Business Bureau. After filing my complaint with the Better Business Bureau I e-mailed the company to inform them that I had filed a complaint. Would you believe that the following day after filing the complaint and sending them an e-mail they miraculously find my other textbook and credit me back the late fee? Yep.

So here is my warning: do not rent from Bookrenter.com! If you decide to take a chance and use Bookrenter.com be smarter than I was and request a tracking number with the weight of the package listed. Let me finish by saying that I'm not against renting. Renting textbooks is a wonderful alternative to buying textbooks outright. Especially with the astronomical costs of textbooks. Just research the company that you are considering renting from. There are other issues that fellow students have had with this company. If you are interested here is a link to the reviews I found:

It is not academic, I did fine with those, but the atmosphere at the dorm and the 'social' side. I payed my deposit late so I got stuck in the 'party' dorm at my school. It is a couple blocks off campus and is well known to be very active in the party scene. It constantly reeks of vomit, pot, and everything else, and most of the people in it party. A lot. Because it is a couple blocks off campus, it is hard for me to go meet people who live in the other dorms on friday nights or what not. 

Anyway, so I went into college thinking I would party once and a while, have a good time but not go overboard, you know. Anyway, once I got to the dorm, what I realized was that when my 4 suitemates are out, and partying, and the dorm is pretty empty (on Friday and sterday nights) there is not much to do. It just is boring. I could go to sleep, but every time I've done that I've gotten woken up by one of my suitemates or a friend, or someone else barging in drunk at 3-4AM, and I don't get much sleep anyway. 

This led to me going out more and more, realizing that if I was going to be woken up anyways, I might as well go out and have some fun, it was better then sitting bored in my room all alone and twidling my thumbs. I also put in a request for a move before the break. Over the break that request came back rejected because they only grant requests when it is roommate issues (which mine isn't, I have nothing against my roommates). I've also realized that I don't want to keep this up. While going out and partying is fun, the smoking weed, drinking, other drugs, just isn't healthy and doesn't support me pursuing my major.  This is especially true as I am starting to actually focus on my major (advertising) this next semester, and my course load is considerably larger. If I go back to the same dorm I know I will just get cought up in it again, and ZI don't want that. I live around half an hour away from the school, but my parents are highly opposed to me commuting, and I don't have the $$$ to rent an apartment by myself and pay tuition(my parents are paying for my room). They say that I need to have a full college experience. I have told them about my dorm's status as a party dorm (but not that I have gotten cought up in it), but they didn't seem to care, noting that that was part of life and I would have to learn to deal with distractions.

So let me start with the background of the situation. I am a sophomore but this is my first semester at my new school because I transferred after last year. I know that a small percentage of people like their first year roommates, but you have to believe me when I say that I was living with the two most awful, unreasonable, and overall nasty people you can think of. I was argued with, yelled at, and even threatened all because I wanted to be able to get enough sleep. I got my RA involved countless numbers of times, but all she would say was to ""respect each other"" and figure it out. I'm a level-headed and reasonable person, but telling that to someone with no morals obviously doesn't do anything to help. I would be woken up at 2 a.m. by our room lights getting turned on, once when I had a 7:30 a.m. final that morning, and my roommate would blast her music as loud as possible to the point where it could be heard clearly all the way down the hallway. Still, nothing was done for months. Finally I was offered a different room, but this was only 5 weeks before the end of the spring semester. By this time I had already submitted applications to new schools. A lot of my decision to transfer stemmed from my awful dorm experience, and to this day it still frustrates me the way it was handled by the school. My second room had great people and made the rest of my time there tolerable, but I still wanted to get out of there as fast as I could. 

Fast forward to this year. At first I didn't even want to live in a dorm anymore. I'm a very independent person and I wasn't feeling too good about being put back into a random pool of potential roommates given the situation I was in last year. However, I met some other transfers at spring orientation and I was really excited that one of them would be my roommate. Orientation was a little over 24 hours, and my orientation group, all transfers, got really close quickly. Everyone was really friendly, which is something my school is known for. However, there was one girl in the group who, although she was very nice, was already getting on my nerves by the time we left. She spent most of the orientation talking about herself, and she had an opinion about EVERYTHING. I decided that it was probably just a one time thing and didn't think too much about it afterwards. During orientation we all agreed to be randomly placed as roommates, but that we would all request to be housed with other transfers so we could all be together. There was an immediate bond between us because of our similar situations. A few weeks later we got our rooming assignments. I was placed with the girl who had gotten on my nerves within 24 hours of knowing her. I'll call her C.

At first I went into the situation with a very positive feeling. We were able to meet up over the summer, which was really pleasant. We also found out that our friends from orientation were going to be living a room over from us. I was so excited to finally have a good roommate and know people on my floor and have the college experience that I see other people having. 

Looking back, our situation didn't start off as good as I thought it was. C moved in the day before me, and had already claimed the bigger closet and the dresser that wasn't hard to get to. She had already spread her stuff out all over the room, including the spots that were supposed to be mine. Her bottled waters, for example, were on my dresser. At this point we were still friends and I didn't care enough to ask her to move them. For the first few weeks things were generally fine in our room. Trying to be friendly and non-confrontational, I let a lot of things go that, looking back, I should have addressed right away. She wouldn't use headphones. Ever. Even if I was sleeping. Her boyfriend, who lives only minutes from us, would be over all hours of the night. She also made a lot of rude comments without thinking about them, like once when my boyfriend told me I was smart and she yelled ""No, you're so dumb, kill yourself."" When I later confronted her about this comment, she said that she didn't even remember saying it, but it stuck with me to this day. Another problem she had was leaving our door open when she wasn't in the room and I was gone. Our door can be unlocked so that you can walk back in without needing a key, which is really helpful for things like using the bathroom or taking a shower when you have to leave but its inconvenient to bring keys. C, however, would instead leave our door wide open and leave for extended periods of time. Personally I don't care if she wants to leave her stuff vulnerable, but when my laptop and DSLR camera are sitting feet from our open door, I have a problem. Our school is pretty lenient with the guest policy, so strangers are able to wander the building and aren't questioned, and there have also been thefts by students. I don't think it is unreasonable to ask that if she was leaving the room for any amount of time that the door at least be closed, not even locked. At one point she even left our door wide open and left the building for hours. Anyone could have walked it and taken whatever they wanted, and since my stuff is closer to the door it probably would have been mine. The most obvious problem, however, has been her having alcohol and drugs in our room. Neither of us is 21, so obviously I don't want to be blamed should someone find those things in our room. When I brought this up with my RA I was first told that nothing could be done because she had no solid evidence other than me telling her that it was there. At one point C told me directly that she had pot on her, but my RA was still unable to do anything because she ""hadn't seen or smelt it"" herself. Frustrating to say the least.

To be honest, I didn't want to say anything to her at first because I didn't want to look like a nagging bitch of a roommate. I don't like to confront people, and I didn't want to start issues with her and make her feel like I was nitpicking her every move. But there was a lot of stuff she did that either got on my nerves or was just disrespectful to me and my space.  I finally got the courage to talk to her about a few issues I was having, but I would ask her to do or not do something and she would be doing or not doing that same thing again the next day. I literally asked her 4 different times to wear headphones while I was clearly sleeping. I decided that I needed to do something, so I went to my RA. Considering that my RA last year was a joke, I was so happily surprised to find that my new one was incredibly understanding and genuinely wanted to help me. After telling her my story she even said that although as an RA she wasn't supposed to pick sides, she definitely had my back. She encouraged me to have another conversation with her about what was bothering me, and eventually we met together with her. It was decided that we needed to rewrite our room contract, because the first time we did it I was the one writing everything down while she didn't show much interest at all. Our first contract was also very vague because at the time it was written I figured that whatever problems we had we could handle them on our own. Obviously not the case. Anyway, we talked prior to redoing our contract and decided that we would each take some time to think about what we wanted to be included so that neither of us would feel pressured into something we didn't want and we wouldn't forget anything. I took this new contract very seriously, seeing it as a fresh start for our room and by this time needing some serious changes in the way things were going. I went over every question and wrote out what I would want to see, expecting some compromise when we actually talked about it. When we got to the meeting, C hadn't prepared anything and just sat there while I read off my list. My RA kept encouraging her to voice her opinions but she just sat there saying ""I'm just here to do what sammywhammy52 wants."" Eventually I just stopped talking because I was so uncomfortable. I didn't feel that anything I was asking for was unreasonable (use your headphones when I'm sleeping, let me get enough sleep, send your boyfriend home at a reasonable hour on school nights, give me a heads up before you sexile me so I don't get locked out without my books) but I left feeling like I had asked her to be my personal slave. Apparently she didn't feel too great about it either because although she was given every opportunity and even encouraged to disagree with me and instead she just sat there and said she was fine with it, she told some friends of mine later that night that she was not fine with most of the things I had suggested. I felt like I had spent all that time and effort for nothing. The next step was to meet with our RA and now our RD, who was now fully aware of the situation. We made our contract again, this time with both of us contributing and compromising. We both got some of what we wanted, and both walked away relatively happy. I was feeling better thinking that finally my stuff wasn't going to get stolen and that she wouldn't be touching my things without asking.

Turns out I was wrong, and since then my frustrations have continued but for the most part I have tried to be civil and just deal with it. My sleep hasn't been getting interrupted anymore, but new issues have come up. For example, I keep a pitcher of water in the fridge that we rented together. C has her own pitcher that sits on her desk collecting dust. Until a few weeks ago, I wasn't aware that she had been using my pitcher without asking. It sounds stupid that it annoys me, but it's mostly the fact that I made it clear that I wanted to be asked first before she used my stuff and she was doing the opposite right in front of my face. It made me wonder what other things of mine she was using when I wasn't around. This didn't become a huge issue though until she drank from the pitcher, without using a cup, right in front of my face. I should have said something, but at the time I was so shocked that I didn't even know what to say. I later asked her to wash the pitcher and refill it, but I don't believe she ever did. That crossed the line for me from things that are annoying to things that are unsanitary and just not ok. Still, I let it go because I didn't want to restart drama and tension in the room.

Throughout all of this, I have maintained a twitter account which I post to multiple times a day. Last year neither of my roommates had a twitter account and didn't give a shit enough about me to see if I did, but if they had they would have found a ton of posts dedicated to venting my frustrations about them. At the beginning of the semester C created a twitter account, but deleted it a few weeks later. Once things became really frustrating with her, I slowly fell back into the habit of tweeting about her, thinking that since she had deleted her account that she wouldn't see them. And in a weird way, I almost wanted her to see them. Obviously this seems really stupid to me now, but I thought that maybe if she saw my tweets about how annoying she was that she would finally understand and I wouldn't have to keep asking her everything multiple times. Anyway, she reactivated her account a few days ago, and since my tweets were public at the time, she saw everything. Honestly, I don't feel like anything I said about her was that terrible, but I understand that in today's world something that wouldn't be given more than a talking to about if said in person is considering cyber-bullying and harassment if it is posted online. I was called to meet with my RD immediately, asked to spend the weekend off campus (even though I've been very sick this entire time and it has put a damper on my ability to get homework done), and today was moved to a completely different room on campus. I have told everyone involved that I am more than willing to continue living with her in our room since it is inconvenient for either of us to be changing rooms right now with finals coming up only a week from now. However, I have been told that C is not fine with this, and so here I am, typing this post from the commuter room that is usually saved for students who need to stay overnight on campus for some reason. 

This is the beginning of my frustration. I am trying to be civil, although it is definitely awkward and tense in our room. She isn't, but yet I am the one who is getting moved. I understand that I am the one who created the posts, but if she is the one who is so angry and thinks she might try to fight me then why shouldn't she leave? The other problem I've been dealing with is that this girl is at least as guilty as I am, if not more. I overheard a conversation she had today on the phone with someone (because she didn't think enough to even leave our floor) where she talked all kinds of shit about me and said things even worse than what I tweeted about her. Also, I opened our fridge and there is an empty bottle of wine laying in the bottom. Of course I texted my RA what's been going on in my absence, and her reply was that because the bottle is empty that there's nothing she can do. I'm not saying that any of that excuses what I did, but I feel like it's pretty unfair that I'm being treated like a criminal for making fun of her but she's literally doing things that are against the law and nothing is happening to her. At this point we are supposed to go before a conduct board of our peers on Thursday, at which point they will decide what sanction I will receive. From what I've been told it won't be anything extreme, most likely some sort of apology note or some work with an RA. Mostly it just bothers me because other than the tweets, I am the victim in this situation but it is being treated like the other way around. I am a good student, I was nominated for the same conduct board that will be seeing our case, and this type of thing is not typical for me at all. I'm feeling so many things at the same time, and I don't really know what do to or feel or say. I guess I'm just looking for some advice or some encouragement from anyone who has experienced something like this. Again, sorry for the rant. I just have a lot of feelings.",,False,,t5_2qh3z,False,,,True,t3_148omw,http://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/148omw/dorming_is_officially_ruined_for_me/,

I'm aiming for UNC-Chapel Hill, but will settle with UNC-Greensboro or App State if it means getting out of cc.

Problem is, I won't have much to show for on my application. High school didn't go so hot for me and I ended up with a GED. While I'm back on track now, the only significant academic record I have is a couple semesters of community college. Here's what I'm looking at:

* 3.75 GPA with Phi Theta Kappa membership.
* I'm taking the SAT this weekend; I know it's ignored on most transfer apps but I figure it couldn't hurt.
* I also have letters of recommendation from professors.
* Finally, I'm a strong writer so I think I could write a good essay, given that I have a decent topic. ;)

Deadline to apply is Feb. 15 for UNC-CH and later for UNC-G and App State, so I'll apply for all three in early February. That gives me roughly 4 months to do something that will impress the applications dept. and improve my chances for success. Here's what I'm thinking about:

* Applying to other honor societies or maybe scholarships. Money isn't a big factor but maybe the recognition will help?
* Volunteering in local community service or solo projects. If nothing else, this might give me something to write about in my college essay.

----------History-----------

So last Fall Semester I started my first semester at a 4-year University. I transferred from a community college nearby, where I made decent grades (Dean's List for at least 2 semesters, and about a 3-3.4 GPA) and had no problem making friends, getting time in with professors, etc. I thought things would go smoothly in the transfer, and that I would have all my bases covered and do fine. I should state before I get into this that I've had a history of depression at least 3 times in my past. 2007 it was so bad I rarely left my bedroom for almost a year. I started noticing before starting that the symptoms of it were on-setting toward the end of summer just before the semester began, but I put it off as nervousness.

I was wrong. My first semester I bombed my Calculus class, and made 2 C's in others. I only made one A, which left my GPA below the 2.0 minimum, putting me on Academic Warning. I found the classes to be naturally more difficult than I was used to, though not harder than I could take, and finding friends became a huge challenge since the campus population grew. I rarely found time to get with my professors, and when I did I found it hard to find things to even talk to them about. I sought the help of the school counselors about the depressed feelings I was having, but found myself either lying to them instead of being honest about it, or forgetting their advice the moment I walked out the door.

I thought, ""Oh, it's just one semester, you'll do good in the Spring, just apply yourself."" but I underestimated the depressed feeling I'd been having. My entire semester for spring I bombed. I attended class for about a month and a half before all my cares left me and I just didn't see a point in continuing. I didn't bother seeing the counselors at the university because I didn't see how it was helping. I just fell out, stopped going for the most part, and gave up.

This spell lasted until about the beginning of June. I forced myself to stop smoking, a habit I developed last year, and proud to say I've gone without one for the last six days after weaning myself the last month and a half. I also began changing my diet, eating more fruits and vegetables instead of resorting to quick solutions like fast food and frozen dinners. I've only recently starting exercising more, but I feel it's helped. Lastly, I've been studying independently everyday to pass the classes I plan to retake, so I feel I'm more than ready to begin.

---------Problem------------

The problem is this. I bombed last semester, so right at this moment I'm on academic probation. I have a 0.72 GPA and do not meet the SAP (satisfactory academic progress) of my university. They've put a hold on my financial aid until I bring the GPA up to a 2.0. I can appeal it, but I have no documented evidence to support that my depression was the cause, or that I've gotten better. Furthermore, the bill of tuition (5000$) is due on July 23rd. I can ask for an extension till the end of August, but there's no guarantee I'll get it. 

I'm at a loss of what to do. Should I bother writing an appeal, even though I know I have no required documented evidence for a reason why I feel in GPA? I have thought about taking only one class for a few semesters to bring it up, but I'm not sure I could even afford the 1200$ that would cost, especially in one month. I really want to continue college, get my degree and be done with it so all the loans wouldn't be a complete waste.  What should I or can I do at this point? What would you suggest reddit?

-----TL:DR-------

I got depressed, failed a semester of college, and have lost my Financial Aid. The tuition is due in 9 days unless I get an extension till the end of August. I can appeal, but have no documented proof of the depressive episode to bring up. I'm out of options, out of time, and out of ideas.

-Senior about to graduate in 2 weeks, high school student in CA, 4.0 weighted GPA (thanks AP classes), decent motivation, passionate about speech and debate, and interested in law (no question I will major in this field).
-Applied around to a few schools, but really only settled for one, this school was Whitworth University in Spokane, WA.
-Tuition/board would be about $20K a semester with all scholarships taken into account.

Why am I having second thoughts?
-Not so sure how I feel about Spokane, WA in general, leaving OC seems less and less attractive as the date grows closer.
-Don't think I am mature (emotionally or otherwise) enough to live on my own yet.
-Not sure that the education in WA would be worth the money/leaving California.

Mental list of pros I have off the top of my head for each school type:
Whitworth/University:
-Small campus (~2500 students, I do better in smaller groups, though I'd find friends no matter what decision I make through debate or other clubs)
-Closer relationship with the professors
-Decent debate team
-Student body appeared close when I visited

Community College (for you Californiaers, likely Fullerton, Orange Coast, or something surrounding)
-Close, cheaper
-Debate team at OCC looks good
-Allows me to transfer off to a UC later
-Allows me to remain in my comfort zone a bit and ease me into a UC/living on my own later as I inherit responsibilities little-by-little

I suppose I'm mostly asking for outside perspective since my family is heavily biased towards pushing me to Washington and my own judgement is fairly clouded (for instance got a recent girlfriend). Regardless of my own bias, I do know without a doubt that going to university and living on my own right out of high school terrifies me and that I generally hate diving head first into new situations.

Is it hard to make friends as a transfer student? Will my other three suite mates already knowing each other/being friends make it difficult for me to forge a bond with them? Will my being a transfer student hurt me when it comes to making friends in marching band/choir/other clubs or musical ensembles?

When does homesickness start to set in? What can I do to get rid of it/make it better? What things can make it easier for me to adjust to life in a dorm after not sharing a room for ~8 years and only living with family my entire life? Is it hard to keep being friends with people back home? Will I have a hard time adjusting to life back home during the summer months?

What differences are there in classes between university and community college? Are they inherently more difficult? Will I need much adjustment from one to the other?

I'm in the honors college of my school, majoring in CS with a minor in Econ and Math. Academically, I'm doing great (3.92/4.0), working on research with a few profs, and participate in a few activities. My HS record was decent- 3.8 UW, 2100 SAT (I will retake this if I transfer), loads of ECs, etc.  

I initially came to my state uni because my family couldn't really afford other schools due to some issues (drop in income due to death- not of parents though). Everything is better income wise, and I have also applied to more scholarships as well. So, I can afford the schools I was couldn't. 

I've had thoughts of transferring since mid-freshman year. I don't hate my school, but I think I can do better. I don't like saying this, but I don't know want to stay at my safety school. 

Academically, the school is strong for my major- Computer Science, but weak overall, and in other subjects. I don't want to go to graduate school, but would like to work in either tech (startup/silicon valley), or finance/consulting. I know for the latter field, that pedigree does matter. Ultimately, I do want to go to a more rigourous school. 

If there are any students here, who have transfered, or adults who are recruiters, would be willing to share your experience?

Lastly, I went to a fairly competitive HS. Kids went on to Ivys (Cornell, Brown, Penn), top publics (UVa, Michigan), and excellent private schools (Johns Hopkins, Tufts, CMU, Northwestern). I'm starting to feel that college isn't as competitive as HS. I'm a strong believer in that one of the best ways to get better/smarter, is to play a smarter opponent. I don't know if this holds true for college as well...

This is just in my first year of college with mostly just core classes, so I'm not behind by any means.

I haven't officially started my art curriculum, as it starts on the 10th of June and as it approaches, I'm having more and more doubt about my major choice. I love photography, but as an art form and a way of self-expression, but I would not feel comfortable making it something that I would derive a large percentage or my whole income . Lack of confidence? Maybe, but not in myself, but more so the availability of jobs and shrinking wages.

I am thinking about becoming a marketing major. I can use my skills in photography and digital image editing programs to my advantage in this field and would allow me some creative flexibility.

The other day she told me she was considering ""going back to school"" and getting a degree. Of course, I was elated to hear. I began to tell her about how the local community college is a great place to start, about transfer programs, study abroad, and guaranteed acceptance plans to California State University schools-- basically the whole deal.

She then tells me that she plans to go directly to a four-year school. I tell her that such a thing for someone in her position is ""impossible"" and that she needs to attend community college first, since she can't possibly enter as a freshman because she's a high school dropout, at 22, with no GED or college credit.

I told her that at the very least she'd need to get her GED first, which she acknowledged as necessary. I then told her that the GED provided no weight to college acceptance. Her reply? ""Maybe if I get a really high score on it...""

The message just wasn't getting through to her. She seems to have interpreted my usage of the word ""impossible"" as ""the odds are against you,"" and that [somehow] a school will accept her as the lucky minority simply on the merit of her intelligence (which isn't even quantifiable seeing as she has no portolio or credentials or transcript or test scores).

After mentioning to her all the mutual people we know who went to a community college prior to transferring to a university, she then says ""yeah, it's cheaper the way you guys did it.""

Is there a question here? I don't know. I guess I'm wondering how I can convince her in her stubbornness and arrogance. I guess I'm also ranting a bit. There's also an element of sibling-rivalry schadenfreude upon her applying to schools only for her to learn what I had tried to tell her previously.",,False,,t5_2qh3z,1368729828.0,,,True,t3_1egsa8,http://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/1egsa8/sister_wants_to_attend_4year_university_as_a_hs/,

Hey folks. I have a BS in Economics, and I want to start a terminal masters degree in Statistics in a couple years. I've researched a few masters programs, and it seems I meet the minimum requirements of undergrad coursework.

However, I am not confident in my ability to be accepted into a stats grad program or to even practice statistics in the real world (my current job doesn't involve stats)! My undergraduate studies had very light stats. I had to take 3 courses in stats (and 5 in calculus + dif eq, go figure). I got mediocre grades, with a 3.2 average. Plus, I've forgotten most of the math I once knew; it's been almost a year since graduation.

Since I have no research experience and am working a job that doesn't involve stats, I want to take a couple semesters worth of stats classes before I apply to any stats program. Unfortunately, community colleges don't offer courses in stats beyond the introductory work I've already done. 

Do 4 years colleges allow people to take courses without being enrolled in a degree program?

During that time, I would also be looking at schools again. When the time came to apply for schools as a transfer, I would apply (after 1 year of cc). I am currently in good academic standing, and I predict that if I go to CC i will remain that way. Also, going to my local CC would give me a lot more opportunities to do volunteer/extracurricular stuff I never had the time for in high school, but always wanted to do. I'm assuming this would make my application look better. But do really selective schools look down on students applying as a transfer from a cc?

**Myths**

&gt; You need to file your taxes before you can fill out the FAFSA.

There is an option on the FAFSA to choose ""will update later"", and the e-application will allow you to continue filling it out using estimates based on last year's taxes. Once you file taxes a few weeks or months later, you can go back to the FAFSA and update your tax info.

You can update it with the IRS Data Retrieval Tool, which pulls your tax info from the electronic IRS database directly, making it virtually guaranteed accurate and also easy to do. If your info isn't available, wait a week and try again. It takes a couple weeks to update the database.

The advantage to this is that you can submit your FAFSA *now*, in time to apply for all the priority deadlines for various colleges.

&gt; You have to pay to file the FAFSA.

FALSE. There are places that will do this legally and for a fee (there is an option on the FAFSA for so called ""preparers"" to tell the government that they prepared it for somebody else), if you are willing to do so and want to skip the work.

However, if you are willing to fill it out yourself (20 min tops, for me, it's worth it), it is COMPLETELY **FREE** TO SUBMIT A FAFSA.

Make sure you go to [fafsa.gov](http://fafsa.gov), NOT fafsa.com. The .com website is a preparer's site.

&gt; You only need to file the FAFSA once.

The FAFSA needs to be filed every year, to reflect your financial status and determine your eligibility for funds for the coming financial aid year (academic year). 

Check, however, from year to year, your dependency status. Most likely, you'll be a dependent of your parents for a while, but for others such as veterans or married students, or students who support themselves, claiming independent status can net you more aid, should you meet the requirements.

**Tips**

* FILE NOW.

Go back up to the top myth, I explain why there. Just do it. The earlier the better. It makes you look like you're on top of things, and you can start working through any unexpected financial problems that pop up without having to scramble. 

Example: I found out my EFC is $22,000, and I'm not eligible for any grants so far. So my family now has to save even more to help me out. Better to find this out in January than in March.

* File online.

Hands down the best way to do so. It's faster, it's simpler, and also the website has a *fantastic* help window that appears alongside the application. As you click within various text fields and drop down lists, it tells you exactly what each field is and what line of your 1044, EZ-1044, 1044-A form you can find the necessary info on.

* You will need, at a minimum: student's social security number, parent(s)' SSN, tax info for whoever will be filing (including the student) taxes in the 2013 calendar year, and knowledge of worth of liquid savings and checkings account, etc.

Dependent students of divorced parents, here are two question to help you determine which parent you will report info for on the FAFSA: 

1. Which parent provided more than 50% of the financial support for the student over the past year?

2. If equal support, which parent did the student spend more time with over the past year?

If equal, your and your family's choice.

Community colleges can save you a lot of money and give you the basic credits and prerequisits you need.

HOWEVER! MAKE SURE YOURE TAKING THE RIGHT CREDITS AND THEY WILL TRANSFER!!

I can't emphasize enough how important this is. I went to a community college planning on tranfering into a university, however I wasnt decided on a major so I took all my generals and got my associates degree and transfer curriculum completed. Good idea right? 

WRONG! When I transfered into my university I went in with high hopes that I would be graduating in 2 years with my BS. This was not the case. What I came to find out was that most universities have nearly 120 credits of required courses, whether they are advanced electives or prerequisits for classes you will be taking later on. Most of your upper division classes will require you to have completed some form of intoductory class that will double as both an elective and a prerequisite. I am now in my third year of school, ~30,000 in debt, and have three more years to go before graduation. 

So please, anyone who is planning on going to college, know what you are going to major in and stick to that specific curriculum. Make a graduation plan, know which classes you need and what order you need them in. College is not cheap and unless you are the selected few who have it paid for, not knowing what you want to major in can really hurt you financially. I hope this helps at least one person not make the same mistake I did.

Well, now I'm here and the fairy tale pretty much ended after the shiny newness of the first month wore off. I'm a city dude, and living in the middle of nowhere isn't working for me anymore. I feel like I'm on an extended vacation that's costing me too much money.

To top it off, I'm taking out a $30,000 CitiAssist loan, plus federal loans just to be here. If I go to a CUNY school and dorm/get an apartment with some friends in NYC, I can probably lower that amount to $5,000 or something along those lines. 

So a few questions arise from my situation. My freshman midterm GPA right now is a 3.5 taking 17 credits, so I don't think I'll have a problem getting into good CUNY schools. Also, I'm really nervous of the social judgement I'd face from family and friends from transferring out because I was so goddamn excited about it in high school. I was the kid everyone knew would go away and do well, and while I'm doing well, I just want to be back in New York City.

Are CUNY's good with Psych majors/Int. Relations minors? What's the best CUNY for psychology? And is transferring out of a private school to a public one a really terrible thing to have on a resume when applying for a Master's Program?

I've googled all these things but I'd just like to hear some of your responses. This is a really difficult decision for me, but my main motivation for transferring is debt. $30,000 a year plus fed loans right now, or possibly $5,000 a year plus fed loans.

Anyway, I've got a few questions:

1. Would taking French 3 over IB Computer Science really put colleges in my favor? My mom keeps saying French will, but I completely disagree. I already understand all the concepts put forth in the course and know how to implement them (I've been programming since I was 12). This means the final grade is almost guaranteed to be some kind an A. This will inflate my GPA for my junior year which I've read is the most important year when applying to colleges.

On the other hand we have French. I absolutely HATE World Language. It bores me to an extent you can't even understand. I've never been good at World Languages. I get an alright grade in it (B range usually but my Freshman year I got a D on the final even though I studied) but it's not nearly as high as I'd get in Computer Science which I'm deeply passionate about unlike French.

My mom says I'm taking French no matter what, but I have months to convince her that she's making the wrong decision.

2. Do many colleges have a bias towards in-school extracurriculars vs out-of-school extracurriculars? The reason I ask is that I entered into a science fair that takes place in March for which I'll be designing an artificial intelligence which I think has a good chance of making it into the top 4 (the top 4 get to go to the ISEF). I also do Fencing and a club at my school called the Academy of Science (I might end up doing debate, but that interferes with Fencing so I'm not sure). I'm probably not going to, but hypothetically could I drop Fencing and the clubs would college administration still look upon me favorably?

And as for why I don't want to continue and get a degree here, the college I go to kind of sucks.

- Transferred to a 4-yr school. Racked up $16K in Stafford Loan debt before deciding on a major.  
~$11K is subsidized and ~$5K is unsubsidized.

- Now I'm still 112 credits away. If I understand correctly, the Stafford Loan limit is $31,000.  The Stafford Loan website says that ""up to $23,000 may be subsidized"", so it sounds like that's part of the $31K.

- I am living with my parents at the moment.  So I'm dependent?  I'm 26 years old. :/  I wasn't planning on still being here at this age.  I did live with some roomates for a couple years, but...

- I'm about to tack on another $5K (subsidized) to my debt just by taking a couple university core requirements, and a few classes to bump up my GPA.  (I haven't declared my major yet, but I know what it will be.)

- I still need to get over my ""math hurdle"".  I'm trying to test-out of ""Core Math I,II,III and IV"" then move onto ""Algebra for Calculus"" followed by ""Intuitive Calculus"".  When it comes to math, I don't like it and I've never applied myself before.  The degree I'm pursuing is a 'Bachelor of Business Administration in Computer Information Systems' (BBA-CIS).

I don't want to be a pallet jack operator my whole life.  Even if I end up doing that after graduation, with the degree I'll still be hopeful.

First of all, I'm confused about choosing a college. All articles talking about this seem to be geared towards US students. I realize there are three types of colleges: reach, match and safety. So far I have identified a couple of reach schools, and a few matches and safeties also. All schools are currently in my 'Maybe' list except for my top reach school, which is a definite 'Yes!' However, I realize getting in there is quite a long shot, and I'm not going to be disappointed if I get rejected.

I'm having trouble dividing the rest of my 'Maybe' schools into reaches, matches and safeties. All of them, however, have my intended major, Aerospace Engineering. A couple of them rank within the top 10 schools for AE, according to US New and World Report; while others I have no idea how to find out where they rank. What are other criteria I should factor in ranking a college? I recently was looking at colleges on College Prowler, and I liked their grade ranking system. Up to what extent can I trust these web-based rankings?

I'm also worried about finances. I recently got a job, but it pays less than minimum wages and I will barely be able to secure myself ticket and visa expenses from my savings. Any scholarships that I find online are very competitive, and I have little chance of getting any. I might be able to secure a student loan once in the US, if I find a cosigner, but before that I will have to show proof of finances for the entire first year to be able to get a visa. My mother will try to pay as much as she can, but she will not be able to afford the entire thing, with her current financial situation. I'm in the process of trying to start an online business, I'm not sure how well will that go. I'll also try to do freelance work on the side, if I can find any. I'm not complaining or anything, but I want your advice on whether I should apply for entrance in the Fall of 2013 or wait till I have my finances sorted out first? If I get accepted by any of my 'Yes!' schools, then do I choose a safety school that is cheaper over the 'Yes!' school?

I'll be turning 19 years old in a few weeks. Will age be a problem when applying to schools, especially if I took an year or two off between high school and college to sort my finances out?

I've heard of the 'study in CC for first two years, then transfer to big Uni for the last two' approach to college. I'm not sure whether this will work for me as an international student, but would it be worth it if I took a similar approach: go to cheap safety school for first 2 years, then transfer to more expensive reach/match school for the last two?

Also, if I maintain an online business, or do online freelance work, will whatever work hours I put into that be deducted from the 20 hours of work per week allowed by my student visa?

**EDIT:** I forgot to include a TL;DR

**TL;DR:** What criteria should be included in choosing a college? I have financial trouble, do I wait until my finances are sorted or apply for entrance in Fall of 2013?

My personal plan for college is simply to do really well while working a job at the same time, meaning social life stuff I won't have time for (am I missing out?). But, even without a job, I don't think I would care going to parties. I'm a decently popular guy, but parties just aren't my thing, and on top of that I can make friends pretty well, so I don't have too much of a care when it comes to making friends (in fact, I met two great kids at orientation for school that I talk to regularly). So the social aspect of college kids seem to be worrying about (or maybe I just notice people worrying about it) doesn't bother me.

I was sure that college was a factory that churned out good workers, and bad workers, with good ones getting high paying jobs or jobs at good companies, or going off to graduate school. Whilst bad workers got dumped into shitty jobs and regretted going into massive debt. Is my impression all wrong?

Right now, I'm signed up for computer engineering at UMBC (I'm going to be a freshman this fall semester), but I'm having second thoughts. From what I've heard, computer engineering is mostly related to computer hardware, or at least programming hardware to do things. On the other hand, computer science is more focused on designing and writing software. Please correct me if I'm wrong about this.

Now, I really enjoy programming and problem solving (I took computer science in high school for 4 years and I really liked it). I'm also really into video game development (I've been teaching myself XNA for a while), and I think that might be a career I want to pursue. So I'm not really sure if the hardware oriented computer engineering track is right for me. However, game development is a pretty specific (and probably competitive) occupation, and my father insists that any job you can get as a computer scientist you can also get as a computer engineer, but not necessarily the other way around. In other words, he believes that computer engineering contains computer science, and that a degree in computer science may not offer as many (or as high quality) jobs as computer engineering may offer. Is he correct?

So basically, I really enjoy programming computers, but I'm having trouble choosing between computer science and computer engineering. I like programming and problem solving, and I'm not sure if computer engineering covers the more intense, algorithmic subjects that computer science touches upon.

The school I plan on transferring into is UC Davis as a Political Science major (though they offer an International Relations major that I'd like to transfer to.)


I'm at a community college right now.  I started off as a part-time, C student, but then I realized what I wanted to do, and what school I wanted to get in, so I became motivated, and have been a straight A student for about half the time I've been here.  

I'd like to go on to get a Master's and a PhD at a ""highly selective"" university for graduate school (LSE, MIT, NYU, Columbia-I'm trying to shoot as high as possible).  


My question to r/college is what can I do now, and at UCD, to get to the level where I'm eligible to be admitted into such prestigious institutions. I'm highly motivated and I don't have to work (I have a complete free ride thanks to mommy and daddy) making me able to focus 100% on school and extracurricular activities.  Also, what will the intensity of work be like at a 4-year on the quarter system?  I'm constantly told that the work is 10x harder than community college, which makes me nervous.

As a side note, I have volunteer experience, work for a real estate management company, Secretary of the Political Science club, and may be interning for a think tank over the summer. 

Thanks for any and all responses.  Reddit has been a big help in my life so far.

I'm a 16 year old from the UK. I'm in my 5th year at secondary school but as far as I'm aware that means I'm a sophomore in the US. I'm a straight A student, and I will take my [GCSE's](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Certificate_of_Secondary_Education) next month. For years I've known I wanted to become a doctor, but recently, I've considered going to a US university more and more. Mainly because I've visited the US a lot, and I love it every time. Also, due to the fact that it is getting increasingly harder to get into medical school in the UK.

I'm really passionate about trying to get into a Uni in the US, but the task of taking SATs, applying, etc. is really daunting. I want to get started early to try and give myself a head start, and make the process as manageable as possible.

I know I have to take the SAT I, and two subject tests (SAT II's, I think), but apart from that, I'm really lost.

I'm going to the US in July for 14 days to look at Universities. I'm staying with a friend who got accepted into Princeton this month. However, even when I ask her about some of this stuff I still don't feel she's explaining it very well and she makes it out as if it's a walk in the park.

I'm thinking of applying to a few schools to study medicine, these are the ones I will be visiting in July:

* Princeton
* Harvard
* NYU
* Geogretown
* Columbia
* MIT

There are lots of questions I have, if any of you would take a few minutes to answer even a couple of them I would love you forever.

* How do I apply to colleges?
* When do I apply?
* If I get asked for interview, how do I get interviewed if I'm not in the US?
* How do I cope with SATs, seeing as American teenagers are taught topics in Science and Math that may be slightly different than the topics I am taught in school?
* Would colleges understand my circumstances if I got a lower score than a US student, or would they expect me to do just as well despite the syllabus not being taught in my school?
* I've been told I have to write essays of some sorts for university applications and on my SATs, can someone explain this to me?
* How much of a role do extra-curricular activities/voluntary work play in getting accepted to Medical school?
* Will the fact I get Straight A's/A+'s help me, or will they completely dismiss my GCSE and A-Level grades.
* Is there any other important information I'm missing?

If anyone has actually got this far, thank you so much for reading this. I'm sorry if this post comes across as a little arrogant or pretentious, considering I'm trying to plan this far ahead even though I'm only 16, but I worry a lot about my schoolwork, my grades, universities and my future generally. I know medical school is a huge aspiration, but I know if I work hard enough, it's not out of my reach. I really don't want to look back on this in years to come and regret not preparing well for Uni applications or exams. Any help or replies would mean a lot.

I am taking classes online because I work full time and don't really have a schedule that would allow actual in person classes... this is fine and dandy as it gives me time to formulate responses etc...

I am curious about professor etiquette...  in all my previous classes I sometimes would ask my professor to 'look' over an assignment to make ensure that I was using the write format/equations and give any feedback possible.

Now, let me make this clear:  I am not asking for answers.  I am merely asking for guidance because I was unsure of a particular section of the assigned material.

I got a response from my teacher telling me that they ""didn't feel it was fair for them to do it.""

I _only_ asked to know if I was on the right track.
