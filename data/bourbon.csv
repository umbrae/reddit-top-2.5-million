Dear Ambassador,
 
Since we announced our decision last week to reduce the alcohol content (ABV) of Maker’s Mark in response to supply constraints, we have heard many concerns and questions from our ambassadors and brand fans. We’re humbled by your overwhelming response and passion for Maker’s Mark. While we thought we were doing what’s right, this is your brand – and you told us in large numbers to change our decision.

You spoke. We listened. And we’re sincerely sorry we let you down.

So effective immediately, we are reversing our decision to lower the ABV of Maker’s Mark, and resuming production at 45% alcohol by volume (90 proof). Just like we’ve made it since the very beginning.

The unanticipated dramatic growth rate of Maker’s Mark is a good problem to have, and we appreciate some of you telling us you’d even put up with occasional shortages. We promise we'll deal with them as best we can, as we work to expand capacity at the distillery.

Your trust, loyalty and passion are what’s most important. We realize we can’t lose sight of that. Thanks for your honesty and for reminding us what makes Maker’s Mark, and its fans, so special.

We’ll set about getting back to bottling the handcrafted bourbon that our father/grandfather, Bill Samuels, Sr. created. Same recipe. Same production process. Same product.

As always, we will continue to let you know first about developments at the distillery. In the meantime please keep telling us what’s on your mind and come down and visit us at the distillery. It means a lot to us.

Sincerely,

Rob Samuels

Ambassador-in-Chief

As of late it has become glaringly obvious that this subreddit is turning into an unproductive circle jerking cesspool.  The quality of content posted here has greatly declined, and the circlejerk favors the same content repeatedly posted as opposed to original content.  I recently posted a review of the [Weller Antique 107](http://www.reddit.com/r/bourbon/comments/17gtfs/review_1_old_weller_antique_107/) and received downvotes for it, whereas a picture of a bottle of [Buffalo Trace](http://www.reddit.com/r/bourbon/comments/18l5to/tonight_im_going_to_try_rbourbons_favorite/) gets double the karma. I certainly don't care about the karma, I'm using this to show the decline in mentality around here.  A quality review that I (and plenty of others) have taken time to write and create falls to the wayside while a picture of a bottle, a screenshot of Alton Brown, or one more regurgitated article about Maker's Mark is celebrated.  

I like this subreddit, but there used to be a lot more quality content here.  I want to see this sub maintain the dignity that it once had.  I'd like to ask the mods to create a set of rules (or, hell, copy the ones over at /r/scotch [but adapt them to this sub],) that will only allow quality original content **and enforce that users abide by these rules**.  Look at how many of default subreddits are filled with asinine comments, memes, and discussion about the same topics over and over.  That's what I feel like this sub is travelling on the path of, and I would hate for that to happen.  I believe that creating and enforcing such a set of rules would realign the user base towards submitting quality OC.

I understand I might be a bit harsh with this critique, but its because I truly care about this sub, and know what a great resource it can be.  Let's look at the success that /r/scotch has had.  I guarantee you that the great success of that subreddit can be attributed to rules that only allow for quality content to be posted.  So, /r/bourbon, I hope that some of you will feel the same way as me, and want this place to maintain its dignity and continue to grow; mods, I hope that you'll truly consider what I've said here, and whether you agree with me or not, at least consider some type of quality control.",,False,self,t5_2rgos,1361222770.0,,,True,t3_18ropc,http://www.reddit.com/r/bourbon/comments/18ropc/message_to_the_community_help_save_rbourbon/,

Some magazine called it ""whiskey of the year"" or something.

I drank almost the whole thing tonight with friends, co-workers, and strangers.  Half of them having no idea the 'rarity' of it.  I didn't take notes, I didn't review it, I didn't take pics, none of that.  Because when it all boils down, fuck it, whiskey is about drinking it with friends, new and old.

It was fantastic, maybe in the top 5 bourbons I have ever had, but the story of the way I drank it, and who I enjoyed it with may be better than an arbitrary score or review I give it.

Whiskey is for drinking, if I never find another bottle, that's ok, there will always be another bottle of something else.

We mods are in the process of putting together some guidelines for posting things though.  

Have no worries, things won't be as heavily regulated as /r/scotch.  It'll remain a laid back sub for the most part.

I'm asking you guys now, to sound off if you would like, what kind of content would you like to keep out of /r/bourbon?

1. memes? -  we don't really have a problem with these, but they can be easily removed if they do exist and sent to /r/whiskyporn.


2. a semi standard recommended review format.

I am now a mod.,80,12,61,http://www.reddit.com/r/bourbon/comments/1if969/hello_rbourbon_i_am_now_a_mod/,"I have been here for quite a while, so it was only natural for me to help out /u/Texacer and the other fine mods here at /r/bourbon with some housecleaning. Please upvote this post for visibility. I don't receive karma as this is a self.post.

I would like to make a few remarks about what I want from this community and what I encourage/discourage.

I highly encourage reviews. They are the lifeblood of whiskey discussion, not only helping oneself become acquainted with a particular whiskey, but give oneself the ability to communicate your feelings about a particular whiskey to others. It helps us make better decisions about what we want to buy and can even help us learn more about whiskey than what can be found in a glass. So, please, upvote every review you encounter, including the post and the comment. And as a reviewer, don’t forget to archive! Remember, every first reviewer is entitled to flair AKA your favorite American whiskey, so please let me know in the comments if you have reviewed in the past and would like some flair.

I will be going through the archive over these few days and determining who is worthy of the flag. The way our review system works is, after 10 reviews, you receive a flag. After the next ten, you will receive another piece, and so on until 50 reviews where you will receive a full American flag, a token that you are well acquainted with bourbon, rye and other American whiskey, which can be seen by all within the community. Remember: ALL American whiskey is welcome. However, you cannot receive these unless you archive! If you do not archive, how will we have a record of what you have done? If you have not already, please start archiving your reviews. If you don’t know how to review or archive, please see [here]( https://docs.google.com/document/d/1xcALvayjwoO2o9DZbJw73AVUK9CvjhMJwxFHp4dN9KE/edit).

I highly discourage bottle porn on this sub. There is a separate subreddit entitled /r/whiskyporn where you can post all your bottle porn, collections, memes and what not. I know many people are excited to post their bourbon hauls on this particular sub. We are excited for you too. If it is not a review, some comments about the whiskey: where you bought it, why you bought it, how it tastes, and so forth can go a long way for promoting discussion in this subreddit.

If you expect anything from the future from me, I plan on working on a /r/bourbon beginners guide eventually. But for now, nothing much will change. Your up-votes and down-votes are still the chief arbiter of what content this community thinks is important or not. So, as in any democracy, (cuz ‘MERICA) vote wisely.

So after coming on reddit and expounding on some price inflation (if not explicitly gouging), I'm back with the conclusion to the story I didn't know would happen.

The store mentioned in the above post is one of my local stores, so I stop by there often.  Every time I've been in the store I always saw the Stagg on the top shelf, but it was marked at $199. I was going there to grab some baby Saz yesterday when I saw the Stagg with a new price tag on it which read $87.99.

I did a double take, and asked the guy behind the counter how much it was.  He said the price was less because this was a new bottle that they got.  Even though it was last years release, in the same store, in the same spot its been for the last 5 months.  *yea*...  *right*...

either way, I grabbed the bottle and let him know that if he ever got more of the series and they charged a similar amount, I would buy it up.

Just figured I would share this story.  If we all refuse to pay 3x retail mark up, eventually, sometimes, thing works out and we get to pay what we should for our fine booze.

CHEERS!!!

EDIT:  TL;DR - Bottle was marked up 2.5x retail 5 months ago, I refused to pay, nobody bought for 5 months, and price went down to acceptable levels.",,False,self,t5_2rgos,False,,,True,t3_1eg733,http://www.reddit.com/r/bourbon/comments/1eg733/update_liquor_store_owner_says_i_can_get_stagg/,

**edit**:~~you know i'm concerned about the direction of this subreddit.  An actual topic is posted and gets downvoted.  people take time to make reviews and they are ignored~~

~~someone posts a picture of random bottles, something from Alton Brown's twitter that barely passes at bourbon content, or another post about makers mark gets 200 upvotes?   its just a little disheartening.  I'm all for enjoying bourbon but discouraging good discussion while jerking each other over trivial things is really a bad direction to go.  thats what the rest of reddit is.  its a shame.~~

/u/jbl7979 suggested the light-heavy and sweet-spicy as a beginning x and y axis for a bourbon flavor map.  I captured that along with some suggested examples in the attached diagram.

(/u/texacer suggested different axis: rye, wheat, high rye, and low / no rye bourbon - but I couldn't figure out which were opposites.  I also think there is a win to keeping the grain names out of things if light-heavy and sweet-spicy work.)

Soooo, 2 things:

1. Which other whiskeys should be on the map?  Looks like the scotch Malt Map has 77 listings.  That means about 8 bottles per square (for the little 9 box grid attached).

2. Where on the flavor map do they belong?

1368546221.0,48,self.bourbon,1ebifn,A better way to make ice.,53,5,44,http://www.reddit.com/r/bourbon/comments/1ebifn/a_better_way_to_make_ice/,"I did a quick search of /r/bourbon and saw very little mention of this very important part of our drinks. Yes, I am fully aware that a lot of you prefer your bourbon neat or with only a splash of water, as do I, but I and others also enjoy our drinks chilled. The problem, however, is that with the ice most of us have in our freezers and at the bars we frequent, we have chilled bourbon for only a short period of time and then it turns to bourbon flavored water. The ice we have in our freezers is cloudy and of low density because air is trapped within it. This is a result of the ice being formed quickly; the air cannot escape prior to the ice structure forming. To counter this, some go for the whiskey stones, but if all I wanted was a cooler glass of bourbon, I'd just put it in the freezer for a bit or use a chilled glass.

So on to to a solution. I went to a bar sometime ago that had ice that was not only perfect cubes, but perfectly clear. Now, they obviously have some sort of contraption that creates this ice. A quick search will show you that the machine, known as Kold Draft, mists water UP into a metal mold that is below freezing. Why does this work? Because this allows the ice to form more slowly and, thus, nearly eliminate the trapped air. So aside from this, how do we get perfect ice that doesn't melt immediately? How can we force it to freeze slowly? By putting water in an cooler and putting the cooler in the freezer! The insulated cooler prevents the ice from freezing to quickly. I recently tried this technique in a standard igloo playmate cooler (the 30 can variety). I poured about 2 gallons of water into the cooler, filling it about 4 inches, and set it in my chest freezer. After 24 hours, I removed it and started to chip at it only to find that it was half frozen. That's how significantly the cooler slows the process. The ice that was formed was perfectly clear. I chiseled some usable pieces that were about 1.5"" cubed, and put them back in the freezer to freeze completely. Once they were ""dry,"" I added one to two ounces of bourbon (Elmer T. Lee) and after 30 minutes, I still had more than half of the cube remaining and my bourbon was as if I only added a splash of water. Plus it was cold. With a completely frozen block, I'll take a knife, score it, and break it into usable cubes.

If anyone wants to find out more about it, do a search for ""clear ice"" and you'll see several articles discussing this process.

TL;DR: Put water in a cooler, put the cooler in the freezer and leave it for about 48 hours. You'll have a perfectly clear brick of ice that can be chiseled into smaller cubes that will not melt nearly as fast as the cloudy ice from your ice maker / trays / bagged ice.

Edit: This has spurred quite the discussion.  I also came across the method that involves boiling water, but also that many had not had success.  The cooler method, as I described it, always works. Yes, you end up with a giant block of ice, but that's ok with me. Someone mentioned just putting an ice cube tray in the cooler... I don't think that will work (if I remember my reading correctly), but if someone wants to try it and report back, go for it.  I like the massive chunk of ice. I don't know why, it's just fun to play with.",,False,self,t5_2rgos,1368560222.0,,,True,t3_1ebifn,http://www.reddit.com/r/bourbon/comments/1ebifn/a_better_way_to_make_ice/,

You spoke. We listened. 

Dear Friends,

Since we announced our decision last week to reduce the alcohol content (ABV) of Maker’s Mark in response to supply constraints, we have heard many concerns and questions from our ambassadors and brand fans. We’re humbled by your overwhelming response and passion for Maker’s Mark. While we thought we were doing what’s right, this is your brand – and you told us in large numbers to change our decision.

You spoke. We listened. And we’re sincerely sorry we let you down.

So effective immediately, we are reversing our decision to lower the ABV of Maker’s Mark, and resuming production at 45% alcohol by volume (90 proof). Just like we’ve made it since the very beginning.

The unanticipated dramatic growth rate of Maker’s Mark is a good problem to have, and we appreciate some of you telling us you’d even put up with occasional shortages. We promise we'll deal with them as best we can, as we work to expand capacity at the distillery.

Your trust, loyalty and passion are what’s most important. We realize we can’t lose sight of that. Thanks for your honesty and for reminding us what makes Maker’s Mark, and its fans, so special.

We’ll set about getting back to bottling the handcrafted bourbon that our father/grandfather, Bill Samuels, Sr. created. Same recipe. Same production process. Same product.

As always, we will continue to let you know first about developments at the distillery. In the meantime please keep telling us what’s on your mind and come down and visit us at the distillery. It means a lot to us.

Sincerely,

Rob Samuels Bill Samuels, Jr
Chief Operating Officer Chairman Emeritus

  As a relatively new American whiskey drinker, I've been trying to expand and develop my palate by trying the mid/bottom shelf bourbons. I've had a few ""top-shelf"" bourbons (Eagle Rare 10yr, Elijah Craig 18, Knob Creek SB 120, Blantons SB) and I really like them, but I found that by exploring the ""cheaper"" side of bourbon, I am able to start noticing tannins, spiciness, and other nuances of the ""better"" stuff more easily. 

I guess you could say I'm learning to walk before I run, so I can appreciate the great stuff later on.

So, in that spirit, and in the spirit of being a recent college graduate waiting to start his big-boy job, I've decided to try all the bottom shelf hooch, regardless of branding, review them here, and choose my favorite. 

**My criteria**

The reviewed must be all of the following:

* American whiskey. Absolutely no exceptions
* Available at a local liquor store in Alabama, US for $13.99 USD or less per 750ml
* Must not be blended, combined, flavored, or in any way altered with in accordance with the definition of American Whiskey.


**How the hooch will be reviewed**

I will ""judge"" the whiskey on its ability in 3 categories:

* Neat
* On the rocks
* In a sazerac or whiskey sour



I shall post my first review, Early Times, tonight. Hope this is helpful to some. I will update this description as I review with links to all reviewed whiskeys.

If you have JUST ONE BOTTLE of juice that you wanted to inform the world about, specifically something that's not crazy expensive(lets say the cap is approx $50 USD retail) but its something special.

I would say that if you find any liquor store that has its own personal barrel of Buffalo Trace (selected by the store owners), its an incredible deal.  I got a bottle of 7 year old BT juice, selected for one of my local spots, and it ended up only costing me $24 including tax!  $24 for a 7 year single barrel of BT quality is a great find, and something I would totally encourage for anyone who sees it and has a chance to pick it up!

[Aero Club Bar](http://www.aeroclubbar.com/)

You can download a PDF of their selection from the website, and it's 52 pages long.  This place was amazing.  The bartender knew her stuff and since it wasn't busy, we talked about whiskey for the entire afternoon.  The highlights (Not full reviews, it has been a while) were George T Stagg - Very smooth with a good amount of spice that hits you late in the game.  At 142 proof, I couldn't believe it.  I see now why it's hard to find.  

However, that paled in comparison to Willet 20 year.  I just had to close my eyes and enjoy the smoothness and range of flavors it offered.  So far, my second favorite, next to 1974 Hirsch Reserve (If I ever have again, I will feel lucky).  

At one point, I confessed I am not a big fan of Manhattans.  The bartender was so surprised, she made me one on the house to change my mind.  (The drink moved up quite a few notches after that)

I highly recommend this place if you are in San Diego.  [A few blurry pictures of their stock and me with the bartender](http://imgur.com/a/OABGh)",,False,self,t5_2rgos,False,,,True,t3_198rbi,http://www.reddit.com/r/bourbon/comments/198rbi/went_to_a_bar_in_san_diego_with_650_whiskeys/,

My Review of Jefferson's Kentucky Straight Bourbon Whisky Very Small Batch.

[Pic](http://i.imgur.com/g0UJBx5)

I bought this along with the Jeffersons Reserve and 10 year Rye for $100 as a package deal, so I do not know the exact price of this particular bottle. I've heard that the rye in their line is actually from Canada, but this definitely seems to be from Kentucky, distilled and bottled.

Batch No. 203 Bottle No. 0997

41.14% ABV

Appearance: Lighter than your average bourbon. I'd say its a solid amber.

Nose (neat): Vanilla forward, smells thin? Caramel is there as well as oak, but young green oak. Also touch of rice pudding. Pleasant but weak.

Taste (neat): First thing I get is apples. Pecan, corn cereal, and nutmeg. Hint of orange as well. very sweet, but enough spice and heat. I wouldn't call it ""hot"" though.

Body: Unexpectedly oily.

Finish: smooth and peppery, a medium in length yet not intense finish.

Conclusions: Weak nose and lackluster finish hurt this one. It was more unimpressive than off though and I enjoyed it enough. This is a bourbon I will be able to fully enjoy without lamenting the fact that it will be gone if I keep drinking it! Lovely bottle my picture doesn't do justice to. Can't wait to try the Reserve and long for the day I can find a bottle of the Select.

Happy Presidents Day!

Last night, I pulled out my bottle of Knob Creek Single Barrel Reserve (120 proof!) to pour myself a drink. I take this on the rocks, and at this strength I need to let the ice melt a bit to cut it back. 

So I go to wash my bourbon glass, and when I turn around, my wife has a pained look on her face. 

Now something you need to understand about my wife - she doesn't drink anything stronger than wine normally, and a sour apple martini on occasion.

I was wondering if anyone cooked with a bourbon before, and I wanted to share my only experience.

I wanted to make a steak au poivre, so I googled and found an easy Alton Brown recipe online.  Essentially, after cooking your steak in a pan and seasoning it with black pepper, you remove the steak and deglaze the pan with sherry or cognac, heat (or burn) all of the alcohol, add some heavy cream and reduce.

Being a bourbon guy, there's no cognac or sherry in my house, so I grabbed the rebel yell.  The result was a thick, creamy tan-colored sauce that tasted almost like maple candy:  very woody and sweet.  

Anyone ever try anything like that? Results good, or bad?",,False,self,t5_2rgos,False,discussion,,True,t3_1bfakw,http://www.reddit.com/r/bourbon/comments/1bfakw/anyone_ever_deglaze_a_pan_after_a_steak_with_some/,

Hello Bourbonit, Texacer here with a quick mention.  When we recently became a community of similar subs we also merged the Scotch archive with the Bourbon archive.  We use it on /r/worldwhisky as well.

It is located in the sidebar and has over 1800 whisky reviews in it, mostly Scotch but that's where you guys come in.

If you write a review, submit it to the archive using the form so that we can find it in the future and read it.  Otherwise reviews just kind of get lost.

This is for reddit submitted reviews only, **no blogs.**

**[""where is the submission form?""](http://i.imgur.com/vT7UX.png)**

The archive has been getting pretty vast over the last year and we would love all the bourbonit reviews to be included in it. 

It is also sortable in case you didn't know.  If you click on VIEW and change it to LIST mode, you can sort by any column or specific Whiskey.  

---

When you write your first review you can request text flair of the bottle you love the most.  I am considering similar level flair that /r/scotch uses, but that is up in the air right now.  Maybe State Flags?

---

Also a community review will be coming starting 2013, I think we will vote on what bottle at the beginning of next month so people can have a month to prepare.

any questions, just ask.

My sales rep for this area called me Friday night letting me know that PVW won't be coming in on the delivery trucks. The sales reps actually have to hand deliver every bottle of winkle they have. The reason why is that quantities are so small that any 1 bottle is unreplacable. So basically if a bottle was shorted off of the stores order ""Tough luck you won't get that bottle"".


So my salesman hand delivered every store in that town their PVW on friday night. Saturday afternoon 1 man drove to every store and bought every bottle at every store (everyone they would sell him). Who was this guy? He was another liquor store owner from another state. That tells us that this guy is able to pay state/local tax + full mark-up/gouging and then resale them and still make a profit..... Another salesman for the other sales route here said that there was a person following him to each and every store trying to buy every bottle of PVW as he was dropping it off. This is a part of why it is so hard to get.

I'm not 100% this is true. But my sales rep told me that Old Rip Van Winkle produced only 7,000 cases of PVW. I don't know if this is for the entire series or a specific sku. I personally think it's the whole series and you'll see why. Keep in mind that not ever state gets PVW and some even goes out of country. With that said lets play with the numbers we have.

7,000 cases. 3 bottles per case. That's 21,000 bottles. Just pretend that every state gets some PVW and no other countries. Well if you divide that equally that's 420 bottles per state. Here in Tennessee there are 4 seperate distributors through out the state. So that means 105 bottles per Distributor. My distributor has. My salesman has roughly 60 stores. The other salesman for that company probably has about the same. My salesman got 6 bottles of the 23 year old PVW for all 60ish of his stores. I didn't even get any. I'm a small/new store. Really suprised that I got any at all.

And that's all I have to say about that. Thanks for your time.",,False,self,t5_2rgos,False,,,True,t3_147b2v,http://www.reddit.com/r/bourbon/comments/147b2v/my_insight_on_the_pappy_van_winkle_problem/,

I've been a reddit lurker for years, but never felt compelled to create an account. When I rediscovered my love for bourbon earlier this year, I started scouring the interwebs for any information I could find on it. I read about the histories of the distilleries, reviews, and anything else I could get my hands... err, eyes on. One day it occurred to me, ""Hey, I'll bet there's a subreddit for bourbon."" Sure as shit, there was.

Still a lurker, I scoured the hundreds of posts here on /r/bourbon. I really dived into the reviews. I really didn't know what it all meant, but I wanted to get to the bottom of what I liked and why. I had no idea what I was doing, but one night, I grabbed my fifth of Maker's Mark and tried to do my own internal review on a pad of paper.

* Color: Pretty much the color of... whisky.
* Nose: Smells like whisky.
* Palate: Tastes like... you know... bourbon.
* Finish: Umm... like I just drank bourbon.
* Overall: I *like* it!

I obviously had a ways to go. When I finally got the courage to log in and actively participate in the discussion, I was greeted by a very accepting, down-to-earth group of people. Silly questions weren't treated like silly questions. Recommendations weren't merely offered with a personal slant, but with the preferences and tendencies of the poster in mind. The open and accepting atmosphere almost made me forget I was on reddit.

My biggest takeaway of /r/bourbon: **conversation &gt; karma**

Sure, we're all still upvoting and downvoting posts and comments, but there are no egos here; no elitists. Well, maybe a few, but they stay pretty quiet. This community helps each other, encourages each other, and is always willing to share knowledge, experience, and opinions. That's a damn fine group of people if you ask me. So thank you all for making me feel welcome and removing any reservations I had about asking silly questions. Cheers!

Is it a good deal?  Read on!

**Kirkland Signature Bourbon 7 year.  $20 1L bottle** 51.5% abv (103 proof)

Enjoyed neat in a glenfarcias glass

**Color**: Amber-orange.  Quite attractive looking actually.  

**Nose**:  vanilla everywhere.  Like vanilla extract aged in charred oak barrels.  Dark fruit, plums, bit of chemical harshness like paint thinner.

**Taste**:  Sour and strong.  Intense burn.  Toasted bread and raw wood

**Finish**: pretty decent.  Caramel notes and oddly sweet given the harshness of the initial taste.  All moisture stripped from mouth but warm and pleasant

Not terribly complex but intense and satisfying at the price point.  If I was going to pick a paint-stripper bourbon I wouldn't choose this one but as a drinking bourbon at $20 for a liter this is legitimately not bad.  Certainly not a special occasion bourbon or something you break out for fine company, but a good cold-weather sipping drink or something pleasant in a bourbon or whisky cocktail.

1362764581.0,32,self.bourbon,19x7mb,[PSA] Is Tennessee Whiskey actually Bourbon?,44,12,38,http://www.reddit.com/r/bourbon/comments/19x7mb/psa_is_tennessee_whiskey_actually_bourbon/,"If you don't already know, the answer is yes, Tennessee Whiskey is actually a specific type of Bourbon. What differentiates it from regular Bourbon, you might ask? Well, Tennessee Whiskey is Bourbon made in Tennessee. That's it. Some Tennessee Whiskies (and some Bourbons) go through a Charcoal filtering process (called the Lincoln County Process), but that does not make it a separate and distinct drink. Many producers of Tennessee Whiskey do not like to call their product Bourbon, but that doesn't make Tennessee Whiskey not a Bourbon.

**Here's the long answer:**

According to the [Federal Standards of Identity for Distilled Spirits, Title 27, Chapter 1, Subchapter A, Part 5, Subpart C, Section 5.22, Subsection B, Paragraph 1, Clause i](http://www.law.cornell.edu/cfr/text/27/5.22), ""'Bourbon whisky', 'rye whisky', 'wheat whisky', 'malt whisky', or 'rye malt whisky' is whisky [sic] produced at not exceeding 160° proof from a fermented mash of not less than 51 percent corn, rye, wheat, malted barley, or malted rye grain, respectively, and stored at not more than 125° proof in charred new oak containers; and also includes mixtures of such whiskies of the same type."" Jack Daniels Tennessee Whiskey is [produced](http://www.jackdaniels.com/history/jack-daniels-process) at less than 160 Proof from a predominantly corn mashbill, and aged in new charred oak barrels at less than 125 Proof, legally making it a Bourbon. The Federal Standards of Identity for Distilled Spirits makes no distinction for ""Tennessee Whiskey.""

Interestingly enough, the Federal Standards of Identity for Distilled Spirits actually does not explicitly state that Bourbon Whiskey must be made in the United States (only whiskey labeled ""whiskey distilled from Bourbon mash,"" which can be argued to include Bourbon). This definition, by US law, only applies to Whiskies made for US Consumption, not exported Whiskies. 

However, NAFTA regulation [Chapter 3, Annex 313](http://www.sice.oas.org/trade/nafta/chap-034.asp) (You're gonna have to scroll for this one) defines both Bourbon Whiskey and Tennessee Whiskey as ""Distinctive Products of the United States, and defines Bourbon as a product that ""has been manufactured in the United States in accordance with the laws and regulations of the United States governing the manufacture of Bourbon Whiskey"" and Tennessee Whiskey as ""a straight Bourbon Whiskey authorized to be produced only in the State of Tennessee."" So while Bourbon may be made anywhere in the USA, Tennessee Whiskey is defined as Bourbon made in Tennessee.

Canadian Liquor laws ([C.R.C., c. 870, B.02.010.](http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/regulations/C.R.C.,_c._870/page-56.html#h-53)) do not separately define Bourbon from Whiskey, only that its a ""potable alcoholic distillate"" made from a ""mash of cereal grain or cereal grain products,"" though they still follow the NAFTA regulation, so don't worry, Canuks, you're still getting real, US definition Bourbon.

EU Liquor laws ([Regulation (EC) No 936/2009](http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=OJ:L:2009:264:0005:01:EN:HTML))  made explicit, and the Australia--United States Free Trade Agreement ([link](http://www.ustr.gov/sites/default/files/uploads/agreements/fta/australia/asset_upload_file778_3889.pdf)) specifically implied that the use of the US definition of Bourbon and Tennessee Whiskey was the legal definition of Bourbon in the EU and Australia (even though the United States technically does not actually have a legal definition of Tennessee Whiskey).

I was a Scotch snob. There was no whiskey on the planet that could compete.

However, it was a real shocker when I noticed my favorite poster on /r/scotch was also a mod on /r/bourbon. So I began to read his reviews and noted that he gave some of his highest scores to bourbons. I guess I had to try some :)

Was actually disappointed with Blantons. That can be the trouble with a single barrell, every once in a while you get a crappy batch.

Then, at a local steak house, I noticed William Larue Weller on the menu for $15 a glass(!!).

Time to see if a Bourbon could match my favorite Scotches.

Oh my dear Lord was it amazing. I'll do an official review soon, but my whole perception of whisk(e)y changed overnight.

I'd rate it 99/100, which is higher than any Scotch I've ever had. Best dram hands down.

So, thanks to /r/bourbon and /u/texacer in particular, I now look forward to enjoying the best of Bourbon as well as Scotch. I love reddit.",,False,self,t5_2rgos,False,,,True,t3_1kgohg,http://www.reddit.com/r/bourbon/comments/1kgohg/thank_you_texacer_or_william_larue_weller/,

i don't know that any spirit could possibly embody a time and place like bourbon does the south. in a shitshow life driven by technology and ""progress"" i feel so fortunate to be able to experience something so drastically different. the taste of something so honest, simple and unapologetic. and that creeping warm comfort radiating out from my belly into my bones. goddammit i love bourbon.

I've been drinking whiskey for a while, but only really started getting into the world of bourbon enthusiasts a few months ago.  My wife gave me a trip to Louisville last weekend, and I got to pick a few tours to go on - her favorite brown stuff (prior to the trip) was Woodford, so I picked their distillery as the last stop on our itinerary.

For the previous two days, we'd been ushered into aging warehouses and earnestly lectured on the importance of location of the warehouse, the location of the barrel *in* the warehouse, the importance of Kentucky's climate in helping move the bourbon in and out of the barrel staves.  We got discussions about whether metal or wooden walls were better, whether the distance between ricks changed the airflow through the building - this was geeking out on a scale I had never imagined.  :D

...and then we went to Woodford.  They send most of their stuff to Louisville, chuck it in a climate-controlled brick warehouse, and then manipulate the temperature to force the bourbon in and out of the wood at an accelerated rate. For some reason, this struck me as cheating; using a manufacturing process to circumvent all the careful consideration, the risk, and the attention to co-mingling that the traditional distilleries go through to produce quality product. At the same time, though, it seems like a smart way to try to ensure that a quality product goes into the bottles; Woodford has always struck me as one of the most polished bourbons, and I'm guessing this aging technique has something to do with it.

It's the only tour where I came away nonplussed.  My wife, on the other hand, told me to pull my head out of my ass and get over it.  Thoughts?

(P.S. The Willet distillery tour was by far my favorite.  They're still building their on-site distillation capability, and our guide was puppy-dog excited to tell us about everything from why they use a hybrid pot still to who picked the belt-driven ceiling fans in the main distillery building.  I'm really looking forward to going back there in three or four years to see what their home-made product tastes like.)",,False,self,t5_2rgos,False,,,True,t3_yiron,http://www.reddit.com/r/bourbon/comments/yiron/does_woodford_reserve_cheat/,

That may prove to be a mistake as this is now, by far, my favorite bourbon... and with its scarcity.... Moving forward.... 

Prepared neat. 

**Color:** Darker and deeper than most bourbons I've had. Looks like good southern sweet tea.  

**Nose:** Initially some floral notes. No burn?!?!? At this proof? Second and third sniff. Honey and something else sweet... light fruity notes. Very nice. Best aroma therapy ever.

**Palate:** Everything bourbon should be. Beautiful sweetness. Honey and something else... figs? Slowly fading into caramel. The complexity is a masterwork. Yet its somehow... dare I say it? Smooth. A perfect balance of oak, sweet, fruit, tropical sun, baby laughter, a first kiss and nirvana. 

**Finish:** Long lasting warmth with various spices exploding over the tongue. A bit of good pipe tobacco smoke flavor. Totally relaxed body just taking it in... feeling like I need to lite up a smoke. The taste of tears start to make it to my mouth as I realize this was just a sample.

It tastes delicious, it really feels good going down, and the honey coats your throat. Also the dose of alcohol helps you relax and feel more at ease when you're feeling icky and in pain.

It made it really easy for me to find what I was looking for, so I though why not try it on /r/bourbon?

Here's the idea:

* Reply to this thread with the name of a bourbon you've sampled.

* Comment on that reply with your review/comments about it.

* Include cost and approximate location where you purchased it (if you're comfortable with that)

I thought this would make it easy to find what people are looking for, and give us a post to point people to when they ask for recommendations.  I'll post two or three of my favorites to start things off.

He told me about bonded and non-bonded, and made a few suggestions himself. I ended up with a bottle of non-bonded Old Grand-Dad and checked out.

* Bourbon Cocktail:

Van Winkles would be yearly/special editions as with all the Buffalo Trace Antique Collection.  They do qualify in the $50+ category.

Standard Offering is something that is not a special edition or yearly offering, something pretty much anyone can go find on the shelf at any time in a mid-level liquor store.

High Rye bourbons for purposes of this would be anything over roughly 15% rye in the mashbill.  This includes: Woodford, Old Forester, Wild Turkey, Four Roses, Bulleit, Old Grand Dad, and Basil Hayden.  

Additional Finishing would be any 2nd barrel aging, adding of oak staves, or things like that. Angel's Envy, Woodford Double Oak, Maker's 46, etc.

[The gist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solera) is you take a dram/portion of every bottle you open and pour it into a separate bottle where overtime it has a chance to blend with previous samples.  Once the bottle is full, you start removing a dram to enjoy while replacing it with new bottles' sample.  

Using an old JPS18 bottle (mainly for the ""fake"" cork which I feel would last a long time compared to natural cork) I put in these whiskeys at about the same measure:

* Rittenhouse 100
* Thomas H. Handy, 2012
* George T. Stagg, 2012
* Four Roses Single Barrel, 120th
* Four Roses Small Batch
* W. L. Weller 12 (went a bit heavy on this one)
* Parker's Heritage Collection Cognac Finish, 2011
* Elijah Craig 12
* Black Maple Hill Small Batch
* and about 5 mL of 1988 Old Grand Dad dusty thewonkyprofessor sent me!

Those are basically all my open bottles.  The next step is to let this concoction mingle for about 2 weeks, then with every serving of the solera, you replace it from a new bottle's sample.  

As ralfy said, the beauty of this method is that you can always have a hint of older bottles.  Even the bottle you first put in will have a presence (albeit a smaller and smaller one over time as you use it).  He even says it would be a great gift for your children or grand children some day.  Pass down your whiskey experience to the next generation to continue.  

Now I understand a true solera involves the aging process and sharing portions from old barrels with new barrels, that's my next step: to age my own white dog using microbarrels or oak staves/chunks.  I'd ultimately like to get a multi bottle solera going, but that takes time and money.  

I can't wait to give it a go when I open/buy a new bottle in a few weeks.  I'll report back on my findings.  Anyone else have experience?  Maybe I shouldn't have mingled my ryes with bourbons?  maybe I should add my scotches and start seperate bottles for each style?

I’m not sure what the official TTB definition of this kind of whiskey is, but this one has no age statement, is bottled at 41% ABV or 82 proof and distilled in North Carolina by the Blue Ridge Distilling, Co.  I was excited when I first heard about Defiant last year because it’s distilled in my state of NC and it’s an American single malt.  I’m a huge fan of Stranahan’s Colorado, but it’s not available in NC so I have to rely on my “source” out West to send me some every now and then.  I thought having a local single malt that I could use as a trade would be a nice bonus. Some information about Defiant according to their website:

&gt;“Our [water] is drawn from deep under the distillery…so pure and perfect for whisky making we do nothing to it whatsoever… we use only the finest, freshly ground [barley] for each and every batch in house on our custom roller mill….our custom-made German hybrid still is operated by hand…each still run is negotiated to collect only the heart of the hearts cut…. American white oak, air-dried, well seasoned, and toasted to perfection, matures and softens the spirit.  This marriage of fine oak and whisky imparts a palate to the whisky bringing out vanilla, caramel honey… You are certain to find even more.  This Defiant young single malt already stands strong!  Time will make it even better.”

**Color:** Light copper, clear (similar to a triple distilled Irish whiskey)

**Nose:** Alcohol, barley

**Taste:** Alcohol, slightly sweet &amp; some spice, mostly alcohol

**Finish:** Alcohol burn, some bread and light vegetal notes, hot

The last line on the company’s website really stands out to me now after I’ve tasted it; this is definitely a young whisky.  I didn’t see any age information on the website other than the “young” reference, but after a little research I found that it’s less than a year old, and probably somewhere between 6 months and a year.  I had set the bar high for Defiant having recently finished a bottle of Stranahan’s, and because I had to plunk down $55 for my first taste.  But even at only 82 proof, I found it hard to sip due because it tastes more like a “white dog” or “moonshine” type of whiskey.

I’ve actually enjoyed the legally available version of Popcorn Sutton’s Tennessee White Whiskey.  When I bought it for around $30 (1.75L) I knew it was an unaged spirit and I pretty much knew what to expect.  I’ve also had (but did not enjoy) the Buffalo Trace White Dog, again knowing what I was getting into.  Unfortunately Defiant reminded me of the BT in taste, but I didn’t realize that I was buying what one reviewer called a “copper dog” spirit, and I paid more than I would have had I known.  So my review score is somewhat negatively biased because of the price, but shame on me for not researching more before buying it on a whim.  While I can say that the color is nice, the taste was the biggest turn off for me.  I did detect some complexity in the nose and on the palate, but I didn’t pick up on the caramel or vanilla.  Maybe I was just pissed.  This defiantly (see what I did there?) needs some decent aging.  I think it has potential and I’m certain it will improve over time.  I really want to like this, and I’ll give it another try in a few years, but defiantly (again!) in a bar next time.

**Score:** 60/100 (but still better than vodka IMO)

It started with a suggestion from a friend over the summer to try some Maker's Mark.  I bought a bottle, and didn't open it for a week or two.  I finally gave it a chance, and poured myself a small glass on the rocks.  I enjoyed the smell of it, but I did not like the taste.  It was too sweet and I admittedly poured the glass down the drain after a few sips.

After doing a little internet research, I found I may like it a bit more with just a splash of water instead of cooled by the ice.  The mistake I didn't realize at the time is I used filtered water, not distilled.  Trying this it was more palatable for me, but I still could not finish the entire glass.  It then sat in my basement for about a month before I decided to give it another go.  This time I decided to go all out and just pour about a shot of it straight into my glass, and drink it as is.  Although I took the wrong approach of trying to finish it in one gulp, I actually found that I liked it much more than I remembered.  I poured another glass, a little bit more this time, and sipped it while watching tv.  It was starting to grow on me.  A few days later I poured another glass and I was hooked.  I did a little more research online and discovered that drinking it from the bottle to the glass to my mouth was called drinking it neat.  The further I got through the bottle the more I realized that this is what drinking bourbon was about; the aroma, the different flavors, the spices mixing with the sweetness of it.

As the bottle was approaching its end, I decided to look online for some bourbons in the same price range to try.  I decided to go with a bottle of Buffalo Trace for about 22 bucks (seeing as I'm a poor college student I was trying desperately to keep it under the 30 dollar mark).  The first sip out of the bottle and I LOVED it.  I found the BT had a much ""fatter"" taste it seemed to me, and felt a lot more smooth.  Even though they are the same proof, the BT seemed to go down easier for me and the bottle only lasted me about 2 weeks (I only drink about 3-4 nights a week).  The BT made me realize that there was more out there to bourbon and that they all were not the same.  To me the BT was rich, smooth and complex while still being very sweet.  Towards the end of this bottle was when I discovered /r/bourbon and started lurking and learning what I could.  That brings me to this week. 

When I finished the BT I decided to pick up something to expand my knowledge of the flavors of bourbon.  I grabbed a bottle of Bulleit Bourbon.  Immediately after drinking it I started to understand what I liked about bourbon.  The Bulleit to me had much of the same flavor as BT, but was a little more spicy.  A little time spent here on /r/bourbon tells me that it is the rye that gives it the spice.  Now in comparison the MM seems thin and sweet, the BT seems sweet and smooth, and the BB has a good amount of flavor to it, but has a spice that my tongue loves.  Of the three, the Bulleit is probably my favorite, with the Buffalo Trace a close second.  I like Maker's Mark, but in comparison I do not enjoy it as much as the other two I have tried.

So finally, the reason I am posting this.  Based on what I have tried so far, and that I want to keep my budget around $30 or less, what other bourbons should I try to learn more about what I like and don't like.  Secondly, how do I go about learning what different flavors are in a whisk(e)y?  I can pick out the woody barrel flavor, the sweetness, and the spice as separate flavors, but how do I go about learning to taste cinnamon, clove, caramel, tobacco, etc in different bourbons and be able to describe the difference between them by this?  /r/bourbon seems to be a great community and I very much enjoy reading through the reviews and comments on different bourbons.  Thank you to anyone who responds to this to give me some feedback on the direction to head to learn more about this delicious nectar that I have recently discovered!

TL;DR I have garnered an affection for bourbon over the past 3 or 4 months in the progression of Maker's Mark -&gt; Buffalo Trace -&gt; Bulleit Bourbon.  I enjoy drinking it neat, and so far like a good bit of spice to complement the sweetness. What do I try for my next few bottles?

EDIT: Wow, I wasn't expecting so many thorough responses! Thank you to everyone who replied, this seems to be a great community! I will likely be grabbing WT 101 and Elmer T. Lee next to expand a little bit. Four Roses sounds like another great option, so I'm sure it will be one of the next few I try as well.",,False,self,t5_2rgos,1354468841.0,,,True,t3_1456db,http://www.reddit.com/r/bourbon/comments/1456db/where_do_i_go_from_here/,

I got some very conflicting timetables from various sources. Ultimately, [Boozed + Infused](http://boozedandinfused.com/) proved to be a good source of information.

I did only single ingredient infusions because I wanted to understand how particular fruits, herbs, etc. work with bourbon. Not surprisingly, the raspberry, blackberry and vanilla turned out to be winners; the habanero, dried longan and ginger were losers. The habanero and ginger were just too overpowering, probably because I left them in there for 19 days. The dried longan was weird. The tamarind, persimmon and, surprisingly, apple, were themselves a bit overwhelmed by the WT101. I'll do some actual ingredient mixing next time.

I am a regular on /r/scotch, but I sort of feel like I know enough to be dangerous over there now.  So, my mouse has been wandering to /r/whisky and /r/bourbon.  By looking through your reviews I have started to get a feel for things, but I think I am a visual learner.

One tool on /r/scotch that I love is the malt map.  If you haven't seen it, you are in for a ~~scotch~~ errr, I mean shock!  :)

Check it out: http://scotchgit.bitbucket.org/

I found another (non-scotchit approved) map like this when I was first getting into single malt and it helped me immensely.  Basically, I went to a bar and ordered shots from the corners of the flavor map.  After one night I had a crude understanding of the whole map by tasting 4 whiskies.

So, I've seen corn and rye and sweetness and even apple jack swirling around in reviews here.  

Searching the net for a bourbon flavo(u)r map I find a bunch of single malt maps, but for bourbon I stumble on this:

http://blog.fxdurkin.com/2013/04/05/bourbon-flavor-map/

&gt; Bourbon flavor map
&gt; 
&gt; You couldn’t produce a Caretsian flavor map like the Scotch one for bourbon.  It would have to be a round target, with Pappy Van Winkle’s 20-year-old close to the center and various brands missing by greater or lesser differences.  Perhaps you could do something with flavor profiles like citrus, floral, woody, sweet etc going around the perimeter, but like an archery target it doesn’t really matter how you miss, but by how much.  

I'm not sure I'm buying that, but I'd love to hear your thoughts.  If a map isn't realistic, I guess I am looking for the ""shining examples"" from the various ends of the bourbon (or maybe I need to say American whiskey) spectrum.

My wife is out of town for a few weeks and today, I really started missing good old Kentucky (and its bourbon, of course). So I went to the local liquor store and picked up a bottle of Evan Williams Black Label just to tide me over. It's not my favorite bourbon in the world, but being a recent college graduate and thus a very poor person, it was the best I could do with the resources I have. Thus far tonight, I have drank about half of the bottle and its really hit the spot. I started browsing reddit and came across the bourbon sub for the first time on a whim and it's really helped me feel like I'm at home. I guess I just wanted to say ""thanks"" to all my fellow bourbon-drinkers for making me feel like I'm back in Kentucky.

Palate: Oak, Caramelized Banana and Vanilla Cream, good smoothness and very drinkable at 94 proof. Not as viscous as Pappy 15, but nice mouthfeel. 

Finish: Long. Rock Candy, Oak, with just a little Bitterness, black walnuts and a little acidity.

All the way around this is one of my favorite Bourbon’s of all time. I am only sad that I have but a few bottles left. JPS 18 causes some dissent among reviewers online, but I have had the pleasure of sampling multiple batches and they have all been very fine. If you like wheated bourbon you owe it to yourself to try this before it’s gone.

I've always enjoyed bourbon, but I hadn't branched out much past Maker's and Bulleit. I sent a message to the NSLC, my province's sole liquor corporation (a government entity) asking where to find the best selection of bourbon. I visited the store they recommended, only to find this: [http://i.imgur.com/98UN3.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/98UN3.jpg)

That's everything. So... yeah. A bit of a let down.

I love Canada and all, but man, I'm so jealous of what you guys have access to. We have a single liquor corporation in Nova Scotia, and if they don't sell it, you can't buy it (and Bulleit was recently de-listed from their stores, so I can't even get that anymore).

Anyway, I guess I'll keep drinking vicariously through you guys. The NSLC is having a big whisky show in March, where they assure me I'll be able to buy Buffalo Trace, but I'm not holding my breath. If I do manage to get my hands on it, I'll be sure to let you know what I think!

So as a new member to this subreddit, please keep up all your awesome posts. Don't forget that this is the closest some of us get to actually drinking these bourbons!

(An aside, this is the new thing the NSLC is up to: [shutting down in-house wine making stores](http://thechronicleherald.ca/business/404473-wine-kitz-owner-faces-nslc-court-bid))

I've bought Thomas H Handy there for $100 including tax, which I'm aware is high but I'm willing to take the reasonable hit to get something nice.  I told them this, and that the Stagg was part of the same collection and had an MSRP no higher than $80, but that I was willing to pay $100.

They called the store owner and countered with $175, and I had to smile and walk away.  Which sucks.  Because I had a freggin bottle of that liquid fire / gold in my hands.

I'm considering reporting them for gouging, though still hesitant because they're one of the very few places I've seen that can actually get this stuff...

End result of all this: went driving and found new awesome liquor store elsewhere that has tons of great $25-$50 bottles that will hold me over for a good while.  Now to go drink some four roses small batch and just relax for the evening.   Cheers gents!

A presentable amber/burnt umber color (I had the 128 Crayola set as a kid!) leaving some viscous legs on my glass. 

**Aroma:** Caramel/toffee hits me the most, like those off brand Tootsie Roll shaped toffee candies with the white middle you inevitably got from the cheap family in the neighborhood on Halloween. There's a little bit of clover honey and alcoholic spice, some marzipan smellin shit, and maybe a bit of maple fudge. Man, I'm gettin all fancy on this cheap ass bourbon.

**Taste:** TIME TO PUT THIS COCK IN MY MOUTH!! SEE WHAT I DID THERE? Ok. Woo, big honey and oak, spicy alcohol. I'm backpedaling and putting some whiskey stones in this...that's better. This cock still gots talons, but a little more sweet honey and caramel come out, plenty of pleasantly hot spice, charred oak. Burns in my gullet. This some tasty firewater though. Rough, manly, like fuckin cowboy whiskey.

**Finish:** This is the down side for me...astringent oak and something off; kinda dirty, like licking a boot that just stomped on a bunch of celery...not that that is a thing I do. That cock on the label done dug it's spurs in my throat and is pecking my esophagus on the way down. It's 103 proof and $15 a bottle, what can you do.

**Overall:** This is not classy bourbon, but it ain't bad. This ol' dirty Cock squawks and flaps and scratches on your palate, but it's decently balanced and drops some nice flavor notes on you before it claws you up right proper. Makes a great mint julep, but I might not drink a lot of it straight.",,False,self,t5_2rgos,False,,,True,t3_wd07c,http://www.reddit.com/r/bourbon/comments/wd07c/fighting_cock_a_tipsy_review/,

I am in Louisville for work for 2.5 days with a coworker. I asked my coworker last week if he likes bourbon, and his answer is ""it's what I drink slightly less than beer"". Same as me, so I feel good about this. We're both relative amateurs at bourbon but know we like it (and are both big fans of Eagle Rare). I do some research and tell my coworker I'm dragging him to Jockey Silks for bourbon flights. He goes willingly.

Neat place, dark wood bar, totally empty except for us and a regular. So we get our flights (I got Elmer T Lee, Wild Turkey Kentucky Spirit, and Blantons; he got Eagle Rare 10, Four Roses Single Barrel, and Wild Turkey Rare Breed) and enjoy them. While 4 Roses Single Barrel was my favorite overall, Elmer was my fave in my flight. Nice and caramelly. Blanton's smelled and tasted like dried cherries. WT was a bit hot and needed a significant amount of water &amp; ice to smooth it out, but once I did that it was REALLY nice.

So we've settled up and are chatting with the bartender (Jean, of Jockey Silks fame) when the head chef walks in and starts chatting with the bar staff. He looks to us, and asks us what we had, what our faves were, and if we had the pappy van winkle 20 year.

I said ""unfortunately, no. That's actually what I came here for, and it's out"". He said, did you have the 15 year? I said no, that's out too. He then asked the bar staff if they had the 23 year. They said yes, and he said...

.. ""We're out of both the 15 and 20 year?!! Are you kidding me?!! Pour them some 23 year. On me.""

Kid you not. $45 per pour. And he bought us a pour (we split it). 

Amazing, amazing bourbon. Changed my life. Stunning. Caramel and oak and rainbows and unicorns.

I couldn't stop smiling for about 20 minutes.

Thank you, /r/bourbon, for encouraging my interest in bourbon, and leading me to an experience that neither of us will forget for a long time (if ever). I am forever indebted.

1367345295.0,22,self.bourbon,1dfbg6,OK. Non-Review OC: The effects of Wood on Bourbon,25,3,29,http://www.reddit.com/r/bourbon/comments/1dfbg6/ok_nonreview_oc_the_effects_of_wood_on_bourbon/,"**Using all of the info provided thus far, a refinement of the previous post**

When bourbon is aged in its required charred oak barrels, a number of things happen: flavors are extracted from the wood, very slow chemical reactions take place, and evaporation occurs. All three are important, which is why just putting the stuff in a small barrel (as many start-ups do) or mixing it with wood chips does not result in good whiskey as oak flavors are extracted, but little else occurs. (Thanks to my fellow reddit users, especially the flavor chemist, “Flavorless” for expanding this. I have also heavily relied on the text and references from the excellent blog whisky science)  

**Charred Oak Extracts**  
All bourbon and straight rye whiskies are aged in new, charred oak barrels. Charring is a process where flame is applied to the inside of a barrel to form a layer of charcoal. This can be done for varying lengths of time, resulting in the different “char levels” used by different distilleries. Burning the oak in this way produces reactions that form free sugars that react with proteins. Well these sugars burn (caramelization), they form a lot of the aromas that we associated with caramel, bread, burnt sugar, beer, coffee etc. This burning process has made a lot of new chemical species that are released through smoke, but after the charring is done some compounds remain in the charred wood.   

Some of the compounds related to flavor are as follows:  
Hemicellulose is broken down by heat of charring and time to furfural (nutty aromas), hydroxymethylfurfural (musty, waxy, caramel aromas), maltol (malty aromas) and cyclotene (maple, caramel, licorice).  
Lignins are polymers (long and chain-like molecules) that in the case of oak lignins, have different sugars and aldehydes attached to them. These compounds break down during charring or toasting, but also over time in the native wood to provide a number of characteristic aromas like smoke, spice or floral notes. Most notably, though, are the vanillins, which lend the characteristic vanilla flavor to bourbon.  
Lactones occur in a number of conformations and impart coconut-vanilla aromas or a more incense-like aroma; I love the latter when I come across it.  

In addition to imparting beneficial flavors to the spirit, the char layer also serves to reduce unpleasant and immature ones. Simplistically, charcoal tends to bind and draw some off flavors out of the whiskey (like your Brita filter), while others are extracted into it.  

**Native Wood Extracts/Reactions**  

Beneath the Char layer of the barrel, native, uncharred wood remains. As you might predict, this contributes flavors and aromas that one would expect from dry wood, specifically oak. Oak from different areas and of different species may contribute different flavors.  In wine this is why American oak (much more vanilla) is very different than French oak (spicy as well as dill-like flavors). For the whiskey to extract compounds from the native wood, the liquor needs to first pass through the char layer. It is a slow process for the spirit to diffuse through the char layer, and again a slow one for it to extract native wood flavor compounds.     
Most of these compounds are actually bound to polymers (such as the lignins above) that do not readily extract into the spirit, and so must be liberated by hydrolysis reactions that “clip” them off the chains of larger molecules to which they were bound. Once freed, these compounds can be incorporated into the spirit, which must then diffuse back through the char layer (which may filer out other compounds, see below).  
As the spirit slumbers away in the wood, seasonal variations in temperature cause the barrel expand and contract and spirit is drawn in and out of the wood, allowing passage of the spirit through the char layer as discussed above. The rate at which this occurs is dependent on a number of factors, including the humidity and temperature of the warehouse as well as the temperature shifts that occur; the more dramatic the temperature changes are, the greater the transit of the spirit in and out of the wood will be. The tightness of the oak grain and the species of oak can also affect this (though American whiskey uses alsmost exclusively the Quercus alba species).  

**Other Reactions**  

In addition to extraction of the charred oak flavors there are other, slower reactions that take place in the barrel. Notably are those involving tannins; familiar to anyone who drinks red wine. These compounds lend mouth-drying astringency to red wine and this effect can also be found in whiskey. Tannins are also involved in a number of chemical reactions that break down unpleasant flavors in the spirit and oxidize alcohols to the ethereal top notes so valued in extra-aged bourbons (the acetone or ether-like aromas in Pappy or Stagg, for example). Tannins also serve to stabilize color.  

The important thing about all of these factors is that they take time. The extracted flavors (lactones, vanillins and others) actually come out of the wood relatively quickly (likely by the time a standard 4 year-old bourbon is dumped), but the breakdown of polymers and the reactions with tannins are not very fast at warehouse temperatures and are actually slowed down by alcohol, so it is not unreasonable to expect years or even decades worth of continued flavor evolution from a barrel of spirit, accounting for the increasing complexity of extra-aged whiskies.  

**Evaporation**  

In addition to imparting wood flavors, the barrel also serves as a semi-permeable membrane that allows passage of water and alcohol but little else. As such, part of the contents leave the barrel as the ""angel's share"" each year; about 8% the first year and about 3% per year thereafter. If this occurs in hot, dry environments (high warehouse floors), more water is lost, leading to higher proof spirits (like Stagg); lower floors and higher humidity lead to more alcohol loss (e.g. barrel-strength Four Roses at near 100 proof). Either way, the flavors are concentrated. This typically leads to a more intense spirit, and also one that is significantly more expensive (by our math an 18 year-old barrel will have lost 60% of its original volume)!  

So, there really seem to be two phases of barrel maturation: an initial, extractive one and a longer maturation phase. Most young bourbons on the market are basically bottled after the extractive phase (they have pulled out a lot of oak flavors and have had new-make flavors tamed by the charring). However, the truly special whiskeys make it through many years of concentration and chemical reactions that lead to much more complex complements if volatile chemicals and thus more complex aromas and flavors. That said, it is actually an art to produce such whiskies, as there is a reasonably high risk that too much time in a barrel can lead to whisky that is just too ""woody.""

Prep:  I will purposely keep a clean palate all day, no onions, garlic, smokes, green peppers, or anything else that deadens or clings to my palate.  I will generally review about an hour after eating, to not be super full, but not hungry.  I find a room with no other smells going on, no candles, no smelly trash, no smelly cat smells.

Glasswear: I always and only use a [Glencairn](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/75/Glencairn_Whisky_Glass.jpg/170px-Glencairn_Whisky_Glass.jpg) or [Copita](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/35/Copita-of-amontillado.jpg).  The concentrated nose is perfect for tasting spirits and I cannot stress enough how much of a difference these glasses make.

How I taste: Neat, only neat.  No ice, no added water.  I only drink it neat, so, will only review it neat.  I have been known to put 1 small ice cube in a dram of Booker's from time to time, but it's rare.  I do not by any means think this is the ""proper"" or ""correct"" way to drink whiskey, it's just how I like to do it.  Some would like it watered down a bit, especially cask strength offerings.

Reviewing: I cover the color, nose, taste, and finish.  

* Color: This is the most fun, coming up with different ways to say brown.  You get some nice red hues in Rye or Scotch sometimes, which is nice change of pace.

* Nose: I smell with my mouth closed from the rim of the glass and from 2"" away.  I do the same with my mouth open from the rim, and 2"" away.  Then a third time only inhaling thru my mouth from the rim and 2"" away.  I then will smell while moving the glass back and forth under my nose.  I write down notes as I go.

* Taste: I sip a little, suck in a little air with it, hold it for a second, and swallow.  Next one is a bigger sip, then suck all the air of out of my mouth and press my tongue up against the roof of my mouth for a few seconds.  Then just finish my dram normally, a sip at a time.  Taking notes the whole time.

* Finish: I record along the way, usually a little bit after my first sip, then the bulk of my notes come as I am drinking ""normally.""

I revisit all categories as I drink, sometimes things in the nose don't jump out until you have had half a dram or so.  

I am not afraid to say what I taste, I got teased a little for getting a ""meatball"" flavor our of Johnnie Walker Double Black, but, it was there dammit.

Ratings: For scotch I break it down into:

* Taste: 75 points
* Value: 15 points
* Uniqueness: 5 points
* Would I Buy Again?: 5 points

Bourbon:

* Taste: 80 points
* Value: 15 points
* Would I Buy Again?: 5 points

I threw ""uniqueness"" out of my bourbon ratings, because by it's nature, it just can't be too different from the next bottle.  Unlike scotch which is all over the map.

Words and flavors:  Bourbon is pretty tied to grain build, distillation strength, and barreling options. You will find the same basic flavors in all bourbon: Corn, Vanilla, Caramel, Toffee, Rye, Wood, and Char. It's just different levels of that, with others sometimes slipping in like cinnamon, fruit, candy, and such. Finding scotch flavors was much more challenging in terms of vocabulary, but this helped immensely: http://www.whisky-info.de/Scotch/genuss/Whiskywheel-Big.jpg

I read other reviews and tasting notes the company has as I drink.  Seeing if I can pick out the same flavors.  Binnys.com will often list a quick review with notes.  Also, try the extremest examples of things to learn the flavors.  Try an unaged corn whiskey sometime, it will help you pick out corn flavors, drink something like Macallan Cask Strength and it will help you find sherry in other scotch.  Try breaking down other things, like, Dr. Pepper.  23 flavors? Try to find them.  Same with gin, there are 12 in Beefeater, how many can you taste?

Most important thing: Drink lots of whisk(e)y, the true water of life.",,False,self,t5_2rgos,True,,,True,t3_o3msh,http://www.reddit.com/r/bourbon/comments/o3msh/how_i_tastereview_whiskey/,

**Eagle Rare 101, 1981** 101 proof (50.5% abv), 10 years aged

**Color**:  Cherry oak, cherry amber in color.  Very red compared to most contemporary bourbons.  

**Nose**: Instant ""old.""  I don't know how else to describe it.  There's a strong floral vanilla note.  Musty dust and old wood bookcase.  Creamy sweetness pokes through towards the end with toffee, butterscotch, cherry, wet cork?  Wow.  

**Taste**: Very complex bouquet of floral notes.  Lavender and lilac, fresh flower buds.  Underneath it all is toffee, vanilla, butterscotch, browh sugar, cherry and wet cork again.  I usually get strong browned apple and apple cider from anything with a hint of rye, but it's non-existent in this dram.  Honestly, this is a new experience for me in whiskey.  It brings me back to my great-grandmothers camp in New Hampshire, and especially my great-grandfather's study with the dark wood and musty bookshelves.  

**Finish**: Nothing spectacular.  A bit short to be honest.  I wish it was a bit longer, but the tasting experience was so unique that the lack of finish doesn't hinder the experience at all.  The floral profile is dominant, but this is the first time I notice a bit of oak.  It's old, wet, and musty oak, but it's there.  

**Discussion**: This is my second ""dusty,"" with the first being a 1989 Old Grand Dad.  I have to say that this eagle rare blows away the OGD I tried.  It's the first whiskey I had that gives me a true ""old-fashioned"" taste to it, and I now know the joy of dustys and why they're so prized.  Fuck, why do I like hard to find whiskeys...

In the time since, I've moved five times, changed careers twice, had a son, and switched from whatever God-awful free email I was using to Gmail. Needless to say, I stopped receiving my Maker's Mark goodies somewhere in there. But I never really gave it much thought. The birth of my son drastically reduced my disposable income, so bourbon was cut from my budget pretty quickly.

Earlier this year, my love of bourbon was renewed. On a whim, I grabbed a bottle of Maker's for a cookout my wife and I were hosting. And just like that, I was hooked again. My passion for bourbon quickly turned into an obsession. I read as many reviews as I could find, sampled as many releases as I could get my hands on, and read the history of just about every Kentucky distillery that ever existed.

At some point, it occurred to me that I had joined the Ambassador program several years earlier. I tried every possible username and password combination that I could think of. No luck. I didn't want to miss out on any more packages of goodies, so I signed up for a new account. But it was driving me nuts knowing that somewhere in one of those rick houses, there was a barrel with my name on it. Without knowing what year I joined, I had no idea if I'd missed my chance at my batch. My wife and I had already been planning a September trip to the Kentucky Bourbon Trail. I *had* to know what was going on with my barrel before making the trek down.

I figured it was a stretch, but I used the contact form on [makersmark.com](http://makersmark.com) to see if they could help me find my old Ambassador account information. That was last Monday. A week passed. I was starting to think it was a lost cause. Then... I got [this email](http://imgur.com/J5w3c). Turns out, I'd joined in January of 2005. Seven-and-a-half years later, serendipity was on my side.

So, our trip to Kentucky just got postponed by a few weeks. I was already excited about the trip. But now, thanks to Hannah at Maker's Mark, my trip just got a *whole* lot more special!
