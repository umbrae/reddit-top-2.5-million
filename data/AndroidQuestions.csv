I also do it in /r/networking, /r/techsupport and a few others and I have answered in many many threads asking for phone comparisons.

However, given that our sidebar states ""For any and all questions regarding the Android **mobile operating system**."" I'm getting really sick of posts asking people here to compare hardware for them because they can't be bothered looking up the specs. I mean really when you get past the specs all that's left is the aesthetic and the manufacturers skin, both things that are best decided by personal choice, which one do YOU like more? These days there are very few handsets that are incapable in the hardware department anyway and it's becoming more and more about personal choice, whatever you pick, the chances are it will be half decent, I mean there's the SGS3, the Galaxy Nexus, the Nexus 4, the LG Optimus G, the HTC One, One X, One XL, etc, hell, even the latest ZTE devices have at least a dual core CPU and a Tegra 2. All these devices only perform differently due to the visual styles applied to them by the manufacturer.

Personally, I feel this sub should be more about Android AS AN OS, this is not /r/PickAnAndroidForMe, though I suggest someone makes this sub so we can move all these questions there and we can concentrate more on the strange little problems people have using the OS day-to-day, instead of getting continually swamped with arbitrary comparisons between two almost identical phones.

Please let me know if I have any information wrong or if there's anything I should add to the guide.

*Music*

This is a big concern to almost everyone switching from iOS to android. There are a few different ways you can get all of your iTunes music onto your android:

1. Plug your phone into your computer via USB and drag your iTunes music folder into the phone or the SD card. When that’s done, you just take out your phone, launch the music player, and all your music will be there. 

2. Use Google’s music service. Get Google’s [Music Manager](http://support.google.com/googleplay/bin/answer.py?hl=en&amp;answer=1229970) and upload your iTunes folder and any other mp3 folders you may have. Get the Google Play Music app on your phone and you can 1. stream your iTunes music from the cloud 2. download your iTunes music to your phone via Google Music.

3. Use Doubletwist player. I don’t have any experience using doubletwist, but it works on the same principle as Google Music. Install [doubletwist’s client](http://www.doubletwist.com/) on your computer and doubletwist’s music player on your android, and you can sync your music, podcasts, videos, etc. over your wifi network.  

*Group Texting and iMessage*

Group text messages work in the newest version of android (4.2), and older versions of android can sort of handle it, although there are a lot of problems with it. iMessage, however, is locked away by apple, so no one can build an android client for it. So the short answer is: group texting works, iMessage doesn’t.

*Siri*

Google introduced Google Now in android 4.1. It's a lot like Siri in that you speak into your phone and it responds. You can ask it for the weather, sports scores, and nearby places, just like siri. You can also use it to give you phone commands like ""open Temple Run"" or ""set an alarm for 5:30 AM."" The coolest thing about Google Now, however, is its card system. I'll use the weather card as an example. When you open up Google Now, it automatically brings up a [card with the current weather and a 5 day forecast](http://i.imgur.com/Jpj3i.jpg) for your location, without you even asking for it.  [Here's a Google Now vs. Siri video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_pclCFpjgw).

*Facetime*

The best two alternatives to facetime are Skype and Google+ Hangouts. Skype is a free video-calling service that runs through a Skype account. Google+ hangouts are run through your google account and are great for video-calling with multiple people at the same time. President Obama uses them for his ""fireside chats"". 

*Other apps*

There will usually be an android version of any iOS app you want in the [Google Play Store](https://play.google.com/store). If not, you can usually find a different app with the same functionality to replace the app you’re looking for. I rarely have trouble finding the equivalent android app for whatever I just installed on my iPad.

This post is the culmination of several days searching online on how to root my 7"" inch LélikTec® A13 Capacitive Touch Screen Allwinner 1.0GHz CPU Android 4.1.1 (Ice Cream Sandwich OS) Tablet PC.

I asked around many Forums, and looked up previous answers - and a lot of people thought that you need a ROM image to root your tablet, and because these generic Chinese tablets are not ""mainstream"", it's unlikely that anyone would have edited the ROM image for a particular one.

Fortunately they are wrong.

What I could ascertain was that the ROM images were for phones, so that the operators couldn't push phone updates that would reset your rooting of the device. (Not 100% confirmed)

Rooting itself could be achieved by writing a specially crafted program that tricks the Android into giving you root, alternatively a ""backup profile"" is placed on your phone, and you ""restore"" a root account! Sneeky.

Either way - rooting a slab (Tablet PC) doesn't require a ROM image. WOOT!

The first step to getting your ""generic Chinese slab"" rooted, is visit this page, and download the latest ""Root with Restore"" by Bin4ry.
His post gives full details of how you run the root program on your PC, which talks your slab into becoming rooted:

Root MANY ANDROID! [Upd: 20.04.2013] - xda-developers            
http://forum.xda-developers.com/showthread.php?t=1886460


It worked perfectly on my slab, BUT when I rebooted (x 5 to make sure!) - I no longer had any app's or widgets on my home screen.
But it was a simple matter of touching the button in the top right of the screen, and selecting the apps and widgets I wanted to appear.

There was ONE icon I couldn't find though - the Google Play store icon!
I could get to it from a link in the browser, where ""Visit this link via google store or browser?"" would appear when I surfed to Google Play pages... which did ok, but I wanted my icon BACK!

I looked around, and discovered that if you install the old version of Google Play from this page below, it re-creates the ""Google Play"" icon in your list of installed software icons (the top right button on the home page), and you can then drop it back on to your home page, and you're back to normal!

This is what I mean:

I was on a long walk yesterday and thought how great it would be if you could use google maps for direction, but instead of looking at the screen, when you need to take the next left the phone would do a long single vibration, and when you had to turn right it would do short multiple vibrations (for example).

1348235348.0,29,self.AndroidQuestions,108x6k,Just switched over to Android (S3) this morning from the apple ecosystem....loving it.  But I have some questions...a lot of questions.,38,9,49,http://www.reddit.com/r/AndroidQuestions/comments/108x6k/just_switched_over_to_android_s3_this_morning/,"I'm just a typical office man, and I do love my technologies.  I switched over purely because I thought it was time for me to try Android to get the full experience of what I think is an exciting battle in a booming market.  And iphone 5/iOS6 was just not that impressive, so figured since I'm due for an upgrade it was the perfect time.


I have a lot of questions ranging from lazy and stupid to complicated.
I'm hoping one of you lots is kind (and bored at work) enough to go through these and answer them.  I know I can look a lot of these up, but reddit is way more fun and it is a one stop shop - **also, first post.**  So please don't hate if I did something wrong.  Anyway, here goes.


* Can I not change music with the headphones that came with the phone?  I want to go to the next song, and can't seem to find an easy way to do it...is there even a quick interface I can use rather than going back into pandora...etc?
* Kind of confused about syncing with my gmail account...under account and sync, it seems to be able to sync my contacts and such on the Google servers...does that mean all my contacts on my phone is backed up safely?  Or am I just able to access my contacts in gmail from my phone?  On a scale of 1 - 10, how stupid is this question?  I think I plan on rooting it, so I can use the Titanium back up.  Is there even a better option to do that, maybe without rooting it?
* Is there any way to modify what shows up on my notification bar?  I'm guessing there are ways if I root my phone, which I plan on doing once I get comfy with the stock ICS/touchWiz, but any way to do it without rooting?  For example, can I get weather to show up on the pull down notification bar?  And to make the full circle, is there any way I can have some music control show up there too?
* This might not have an answer...my fat palm sometimes squeezes over and hits the soft keys when I use it with one hand.  Any solution for that...?  I guess I can hit the gym....or play more smash bros to work out my hands?  


Maybe I'll end it here.  Any feedback/answer would be much appreciated.


**edit**  Oh man!  I love you guys.  I must say, I lost faith in reddit as it gained so much user base...(let's be honest, it evolved from a small community to another myspace...not saying that that's bad...but does take away a lot of the good stuff as well) but this thread was VERY helpful.  With that said, I now have another lingering question.  

* Whenever I try to install Google music manager, it doesn't seem to work properly.  Install itself seems fine, but when I try to open the application, it seems to freeze and it says ""not responding.""  I see it in System Preferences, but when I open the tool, I can't do anything with it and 'happyuser@gmail.com' is logged in and can't be logged out of.  Tried to look it up, but can't find info on this anywhere...so I turn to you again, reddit.
* Can I have a badge on the Gmail app icon, so I know how many unread messages I have from the home screen?
* Anyone know if there's any way I can plug in my galaxy S3 on 2011 Honda CR-V via USB to listen to music?  It works for ipods, and when I plug in the S3, it says unsupported...so I'm guessing not likely.  But figured someone here might know a hack or some cool shit to download/tweak my S3 to make it supported/compatible.  At this point, I pretty much expect all my problems to be answered here after the responses I got from the last post....on that note, I'm done with this edit.

Is there any way to adjust the threshold where my phone switches from WiFi to mobile data due to the WiFi signal being too weak to use?

A pretty standard situation for me is that I'll leave my home or office and wait for a little while at the bus stop right outside.  This bus stop is close enough that I still have a tiny bit of WiFi signal, but it's clearly inadequate.

If I want a responsive connection at these bus stops, I need to turn off WiFi so the phone switches over to mobile data. Not the end of the world, but it often leads to me leaving wifi off once I get off the bus.

Anyway, my question is, if I go for a quad core, during what phone activities will it matter? Is it just in graphically intensive games, loading videos, or heavy stuff like that? Or does it noticeably increase performance in everything including menu navigation, screen transitions, etc? How does it effect web browsing?

I'm a long time HTC user EVO &gt; EVO 3D &gt; EVO 4G LTE. Played around with the One and it kind of diminished my excitement about the device. The design is top notch but I don't feel that makes up for BlinkFeed, which I really didn't care about, non removable storage, lack of two-stage camera button (I use that a lot), Kick stand (negligable but I'm one of the few that use it often), changes to face buttons (again, I used the menu key often, anything to free up screen real estate), among other things. The One felt like a progression towards Apple's design philosophy. A ""streamlining"" of sorts that seems to limit the phone's ability in favor of features they feel we need and don't need.  Also, the phone honestly didn't feel much different than my 4G LTE.

Samsung's device is starting to look more interesting to me. While I've never been a fan of Samsung's designs and while I feel that their overall aesthetic is cheap (fonts, device build, etc) there are quite a number of software and hardware features I'm finding appealing. Having home back and menu keys is great as well as the ability to use removable storage. Back and front cover options seem useful too. Still no kick stand or 2-stage camera button but it would seem that I can't get that on either.

When I try to drag the blue handle things to select a word its mission impossible, it jumps all over the place and there is no accuracy at all. 

2. When I close and reopen my browser it goes back to my homepage instead of the page I was on, even if the browser remains loaded in the RAM.  Can I change this behavior?

3.  Whenever I make a phone call I get an annoying beep and a popup saying conditional call forwarding active.  How can I stop this?

4.  To remove all the att apps do I need to root my device?

5.  When I entered in my gmail info, without asking it added every single person I've emailed in the past 7 years to my contact list. This is annoying because If I'm starting a text message I have to type the persons whole name then still scroll through a long list to select their name instead just typing j for jessica for example. Do I now have to manually delete the over 1000 email contacts to remove them?  How can I make sure this never haplens again?  I know I can hide them from showing on the contacts screen but that doesn't help me when trying to text or call someone. 

6.  Can I make the default messaging app display image mms messages as a still image and not a slideshow or must I dl a different sms app for that?

7.  When I lock the phone with music playing with the default music player app sometimes there are pause next track etc buttons on the lock screen and sometimes not. How can I make them always display?

8.  On the iphone you can tap the top of the screen to instantly scroll to the top of a long webpage or text message. Does similar functionality exist in android os?

all these cables are difference and i have found the HTC and samsung official brands charge my phone fully in under an hour but some of these other chargers take almost 4 hours or more to get a full charge.

i heard someone say that they are different inside and samsung phones need the specific one but i cant find any information on it. 

im now looking to get more cables and wanted to see if there were specific brands to look for. ive purchased some ""samsung"" brand microUSB cables on amazon but they didn't look like the ones i had before and they did not do the trick.

My wife's uncle is a quadripeligic, but has some very basic usage of his arms.  So, he can move his arms, but can't move his hands/fingers (I apologize, I don't understand the nuances of his medical condition very well --- I believe he controls his arms through the use of his shoulder muscles, but I'm not 100% sure how it all works).  He is able to use a computer by typing with a pencil wedged into his hand (or in a special glove-type-thing) and can manipulate a touch-screen monitor.  

He was talking to me the other day about wanting to try and get a smart phone, but he wasn't sure if he'd be able to use it.  I figured I'd ask you guys if there were some ""Accessibility"" type apps for his kind of usage.

Some things he'd want/need: 
* Obviously, a large interface for all buttons/notifications.  Basically, try to use it by putting an eraser on your elbow.  
* ""Always on"" speakerphone.  He can't hold a phone up to his ear reliably (and I think he can't use a headset due to hearing loss?) but currently uses speakerphone on the home phone with ease.  Having to turn on speakerphone every time he answers the phone irritates him :)
* He'd like to be able to control the various devices in the house (tv/stereo/lights/thermostat).  I know it can be done with proper wiring/etc, but wasn't sure if the interface with an Android would be accessible enough.  

Anyhow, I figured I'd put out a quick request and see if any of y'all had experience or a direction for me to look.

Now I'm on WiFi almost 90% of the time, the weekends is when I use the mobile network the most, and even still that's a little bit of web browsing here and there. I rarely download anything, and I'm not streaming Netflix or YouTube.

Jump ahead a day and a handful of calls to T-Mobile later, they bumped me up to a 5GB limit for my 'loyalty as a customer.' Awesome, they're actually taking care of me. 

System refreshes and I'm back to 4G. 

This morning, not even 8 hours later, I'm being told I've already reached my data limit and I'm now being throttled. So somehow I've used over 3GB of data in under 8 hours? This has to be impossible. So I'm not too sure what's going on, nothing should be eating that much of my connection.

So am I going crazy here, or is my phone just fucked. I haven't done a full system reset yet, however I guess that's my next step. However what's the point if I'm throttled until 9/10? 

At this point I'm ready to cancel with T-Mobile and go elsewhere. Even if there isn't much I can do I guess I just wanted to vent. So thanks for reading if you did, I'm just completely baffled at this situation.

**EDIT:**

Looks like the culprit has been found. 

Somehow [Google Music](http://i.imgur.com/s3xiU.jpg) has been eating my connection, which is weird because I never use it.

  I am currently debating switching from my iPhone 4, to the Android powered Galaxy Note. I am sort of on the fence with switching to unfamiliar territory but when I honestly think about it, I can't really think of anything that I absolutely can only do on my iPhone that I couldn't do on Android. 

  I primarily use my phone for music, web browsing, and texting and usually have it sync'd to it's base station Macbook every night to charge and reload music I may have switched or apps I may have downloaded. Will an Android charge off of a Macbook's USB port? (I am in NO WAY an Apple fanboy, and only use my Macbook for DJing and as a bedside laptop). 

  How easy is it to root and replace things on an Android device? For example, I would want a custom boot animation and a faster than stock desktop system? (I have no idea what that's called..dashboard?)

  What are some of the main points of Android? How can I make it work well with my gaming pc, music, and other things? How well does the app store work for it, how secure is my payment info? 

  I appreciate the help, I am a total noob to this awesome looking OS and am trying to find a way out of the heavily restrictive iOS platform. I understand I am pretty much asking to be fully educated on the Android platform but I never open my wallet unless I know exactly what I am getting in to.

Thanks a ton!

tl;dr-

1. Android vs. iOs
2. Ease of use.
3. What are some key things on Android that I can't do on iOS.
4. Interactivity with current hardware in home.
5. Benefits of owning a ""phablet"" versus a regular form factor device.
6. Possibly, How this will help me as a DJ and gamer?

Hey I recently purchased a Samsung Galaxy Nexus to replace my slow, outdated, but still loved Motorola Droid 1.  I felt horrible turning the droid off and throwing it in my desk draw, but what else could I do with it?  

Well that got me thinking.  I removed ""Phone.apk"" and put the droid into Airplane mod.  Mind you I was running some outdated version of CM7 2.3.7 with a custom kernel I forget.  I removed all the pointless ""bloatware"" I had amounted over the past few years, resynced a new google account to the phone, But still wasn't impressed.  Eventually I fresh installed Peter Alfonso's GPA19 build. I downloaded Groove IP and replaced the link to Phone.apk with Groove IP synced to the new google gmail voice account I made.  This was much better.  Now It is still not perfect.  This device still performs like a phone, and I think there could be a better solution.  

I am traveling overseas beginning early feb, and instead of using a local phone for long distance calling, I will connect to wifi with the Droid 1 and use Groove IP to call from a US number to my family and friends.  I will use Google Music to sync my library to my old Droid before leaving.  I will use my phone for an MP3 player and internet browser while away.  No need for a netbook.  I like classic games, I can download tons of emus and bring along a wiimote to play classic NES games.  This device has a second life.  This is what I'm trying to say.  To throw this device into a desk to die a slow and abysmal death of obsolescence is a waste! 

**STATEMENT**

As the droid 1 becomes a non-network commissioned phone, Android builds should start popping up as there is a void to be filled by this trusty device.  We just need a dev or devs to take Android somewhere it never has gone.  This can and should pay-off nicely as it has for peter Alfonso who still back-ports and supports the old outdated, forgotten Droid 1.   

An Android Retired Device Commissioned OS build would be a hit with the future users, fill a void in Android's software library, as well as fill a bunch of needed overlapping between dedicated handheld VOIP, long lasting MP3 battery life, and pocket sized gaming platform with solid battery life. Retired phones, specifically Droid 1 can do this! I think it would be awesome, and tons of people who don't even realize it will love this device.  The battery life I get with this phone (now that I am in Airplane mode) is amazing! (4 days today).

We have implemented a system whereby all /r/AndroidQuestions readers can now add, *and update*, your own flair by yourselves. The purpose of this automated feature is to display *Phone/Tablet information (and optional: Carrier information)*. This not only allows you to showcase your android device, but more importantly, it allows other readers to help you with device-specific or carrier-specific problems.

*Follow this method below, and you will get your flair for /r/Android **and** /r/AndroidQuestions!*

**Here is how it works:**

1. [**Send a message to BigFriendlyRobot**](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=BigFriendlyRobot&amp;message=DeviceName,+Firmware,+Carrier&amp;subject=android) with the subject **android**.

2. In the message body, enter your flair: e.g. *Nexus One, Cyanogenmod 7.1-RC1, WindMobile*

3. Press SEND, and wait about 10 minutes for it to take effect. Done!

Note: Developers are also allowed to change their flairs (see Rules below). Your icons will remain. Readers who want to get a developer-icon next to their flair, [please see here](http://www.reddit.com/r/Android/comments/j20sm/developers_of_randroid_fill_out_this_form_to/).
***

Since the flairs can be misused for spam (or misused as a facebook-status), there are a few constraints placed on flairs.

**Rules Regarding Automated Flairs**

1. If you are a non-developer, your flair must be ""Device-name, Firmware"". Carrier is optional.

2. If you have multiple Android devices, you are allowed to mention all of them.

3. If you are a developer, your flair must be one of these: App-Name | Developer-Name | Team-Name | Company-Name | Top-level Domain | ""For Hire"" | (or leave empty, and only the icon will remain).

4. Developers are also allowed to mention their Android-Device info, if they want.

5. No URLs are allowed in your flair. Top-level domain is allowed (example.com)

6. Your flair must be of reasonable length (40 characters is the maximum limit).

7. Please don't type your flair text as ALL CAPS.

8. Please don't swear in your flair.

***

**The Flair Warning System (Three Strike Ban)**

There might be a small few, in a community of 60000, that choose to disregard the rules and misuse the feature. In order to moderate such behaviour, a transparent three-strike ban has been implemented.

**Here is how it works:**

1. If a reader disregards the rules of the subreddit (but the act is not a banworthy offense), a moderator will append [1] to the end of their flair-text. This counts as the first strike.

2. Succeeding offenses will result in [2] and [3] tags. On the third-strike, the reader will be banned from posting and commenting on /r/android.

2. A reader with [1] or [2] next to their flair will lose their automated flair-changing privileges (the bot will refuse to honor the flair-change request and will inform them through a reply). Only a moderator may change that reader's flair, so they will have to message the mods.

3. Note: You can [appeal your case to the moderators](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%23Android&amp;message=Please+reconsider+my+flair+strike+because+...&amp;subject=Flair+Strike+Appeal) to get your strike erased.

**These offenses will earn you a warning:**

* Grievous misuse of flair.

* Hateful comments towards other users.

* Harmful trolling of the subreddit/users.

* Providing links to pirated material.

* Gray areas when considering spam bans.

***

This new flair system will allow readers to see who's who in the comments, who owns what, allows for more transparency in moderating, and also makes spammers more visible.

If you have any suggestions or criticisms for improving on the proposed model, please let us know in the comments. Thanks! :)

Finally trucked my 4S into the AT&amp;T store with a bunch of old beater phones, walked out with a brand new SGS4 and a Galaxy Tab 2 10.1 with Android 4.0, which I didn't need, but was only $75 after I traded in all my old phones, so I couldn't pass it up.

Looks like AT&amp;T is the only provider who has yet to update to Jelly Bean on their Tab 2 10.1s, so hopefully that comes around eventually.
My bottom line questions are pretty easy:

1) I don't know much about maintaining a ""clean"" Android phone. I like to limit my apps to what I actually use, the SGS4 has a ton of Samsung, AT&amp;T, and Google apps. Can I delete any of them, or are they permanent?

2) I see the term ""rooting"" but don't know what it means, what ""flashing a ROM"" would entail and result in, etc. etc. - can anybody give me a very basic primer on these topics? Is it something I'm going to be potentially interested in with 4.2.2 already installed on the SGS4?

3) AT&amp;T tethering - anybody know the basics on this? If I ask my phone to do it, it tells me to go to AT&amp;T's website first. I have yet to try this, but my assumption was that the GS4 could tether without AT&amp;T's permission, am I incorrect?

Swiping right again bring me to a page with Flipboard and some apps for maps music and gallery. The apps are fine. I assume the other things are widgets. Can I delete them if I don't want them? Next is the ""Apps"" section. There are 3 pages of apps in there, and I don't think that I will use all of them. Can these be deleted? For instance there is what appears to be 3 different messaging apps: ""Messages"", ""Messaging"", and ""Messenger"" Am I missing something? Do I need all three of these? And lastly, when I go into the settings and Application manager, it says that I am currently downloading google play services, and google play store, which is fine, but does it just download things automatically, without my confirmation? I apologize for the wall of text, and appreciate any help you can give me.

I am currently using a non-rooted HTC Desire running 2.2 but I am eligible for an upgrade. My family uses US Cellular as our cell phone provider and they have a very poor selection of phones. Their most recent additions are the Galaxy SII and the Galaxy Aviator. I don't really care for the aviator so that just leaves the Galaxy SII. I am just wondering if it is still worth it to get it though. The white one looks really nice, but it costs $250 AFTER a $100 mail in rebate. That seems really steep for a phone that's been out since last summer on other carriers. I will also admit that I am kind of an HTC fanboy (as much as I hate to admit it, it's true) so switching to a Samsung will be really hard for me. My sister has the original Galaxy S and I prefer my phone so much more than hers. I absolutely love my Desire. The only problem is that the lack of internal storage is KILLING me. If it wasn't for that problem than I would keep it until it wouldn't turn on again. I could hold out and hope that an HTC eventually pops up but given HTC's horrible last year, I don't know what good it will do.

Now for a bonus question. If I do get the Galaxy SII, can I get ICS on it? I have never rooted a phone before so I am a total noob in that area. I would really like to get vanilla ICS on it if I could. Is there a ROM for the CDMA GSII? And if there is, how difficult would it be for a first timer to install it?

Thanks for all of your suggestions! My phone* works perfectly now, and i thought i'd share what i did

First thing I ended up doing was downloading a wakelock detector to see if anything was waking up my phone constantly. The only thing that was was 2x battery. An app that turns your entire networking on/off every 15 minutes. So although it was waking the phone up, it was normal and it did infact improve battery life

Then, I rooted my phone + unlocked the bootloader and stuck ViperX on it. Maybe it would work better with a fresh install? Sadly no. Although the ROM is very good and fun to use, the battery life remained the same

Afterwards i did one final test. I (again) charged my phone up fully, turned all networking off and let it discharge completely when i was sleeping. **It died in just under 7 Hours **(Which was when i woke up-ish)

So as some of you suggested, it was infact the batteries fault! I took off the rom, wiped my phone and stuck back the stock rom i had and sent it away. My phone came back yesterday and I did exactly the same test (Charge to 100% leave overnight).

**92%**, AND i slept for about 10 hours

So. What can i gather from all this? The average discharge rate of a HTC One X is about %0.5-1 an hour on idle, where as my old phone it was about 10-15%. Unless you've got some amazingly awful apps that keep your phone awake, it isn't normal. There are ways you can make your phone last longer (dim screen, turn off networking) but if your phone is still horrible then chances are the battery is fucked

1. I need to root it - I tried using gingerbreak (followed the instructions carefully) but it didn't work. The phone got stuck in a ""rooting"" screen for 2 hours before I gave up and rebooted. When I try to use gingerbreak the SD card unmounts, so I think that's why the rooting fails.

I don't have a usb cable, only a socket charger - but I can get a usb if it's the easiest method.

Post-root (if I can figure the root method out)

1. Disable emergency call (or disable the phone functions entirely). My son plays with buttons and sometimes presses the emergency call button. Twice it's gone through to a real person before I've realised what he's done. I've removed the SIM card already (and only enable wifi when I am trying to download root apks) but emergency call still goes through.

2. Remove all the ridiculous apps. Korean phones come with about 5 pages of unremovable apps. Most are complete crap! I'd like to get rid of as much as I can to clear up memory and not have them running (or able to be started).

3. Maximise the phone's speed. It does get sluggish because of all the background tasks that are running (many of which I don't need). So I would like to get rid of all unnecessary tasks which are always on. That includes stuff like contacts, messaging, etc (none of which he needs). It'll never be used as a phone again, so I don't care about dumping apps/processes which I don't immediately need.

Aside from kid's games, I only need the browser and wifi for downloading from the Play store and other toolkits which help me improve the phone's usability. Oh, I also plan to install some ROMs so that I can play Pokemon and Zelda (and teach them to my son later).

***

I know that's a lot ... I'd be happy with just rooting for now and working on the other stuff later. I have done a large amount of reading and I haven't been able to figure out the root issue. I'm sure once it's rooted there's ways I can get the other stuff done.

Apologies for the wall of text. I appreciate your help guys!

I'm getting a tablet for my cafe so the costumers can come in and read the news while they drink their coffee.

However, there is a problem. Theft.
What I will do is install Prey. But apart from that, what else can I do?

I would like that if the device leaves the WiFi-zone, that it enters a ""Locked down"" mode. Or that it automatically sends its GPS data to me.


Is there a way for me to do it?

I'll have the facebook app, twitter app, the browser plus a PDF-reader.
I would like the fb, twitter, browser cache to be deleted after a session ends. Is that possible?

So, in essence:
If the device leaves the wifi-zone lock-down. Automatic anti-theft app per say?!

Auto cache-deletion when the session ends. Is that possible? Are there apps or ""internet cafe"" launchers?

The hard transition from blackberry.,18,6,24,http://www.reddit.com/r/AndroidQuestions/comments/1hzge7/is_it_okay_to_live_with_gingerbread_the_hard/,"First of all, I admit that I am stubborn and wrong for wanting a phone exactly like my old one. I should adapt to change, and realize touchscreen keyboards aren't too bad.  

I've been clinging to my blackberry for ages, I love it, but I want to switch carriers, which means no BIS, which means no blackberry. 

My favorite phone of all time has been the [nokia E71](http://www.amazon.com/Nokia-E71-Unlocked-Navigation-Warranty/dp/B001BZJ54U/ref=sr_1_1?s=wireless&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1373425598&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=nokia+e71). If I cannot find an android phone, I might just buy another one. 

Alright, enough about me, on to android.  

My ideal device: multiple days of battery life, physical keyboard, up to date android, (via CM, or whatever custom rom, or stock doesn't matter). Preference in that order. (EDIT: Forgot to mention, primary usage is multiple email accounts and text messaging. But I want to have access to the latest apps and what not if possible)  

What I have found:

[Motorola Defy Pro](http://www.amazon.com/Motorola-Xt560-Unlocked-Smartphone-Waterproof/dp/B00CFS79K4/ref=sr_1_1?s=wireless&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1373425963&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=motorola+defy+pro)
Android 2.3, good battery, decently reviewed, waterproof! 

[Sony Ericsson Experia Pro](http://www.amazon.com/Sony-Ericsson-MK16A-Smartphone-Touchscreen/dp/B005DIPRSE/ref=sr_1_1?s=wireless&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1373426290&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=sony+experia+pro)  jellybean via CM10, decently reviewed, not terrible battery. 

[HTC Status/ChaCha](http://www.amazon.com/HTC-Status-A810a-Unlocked-Keyboard/dp/B00749TZQU/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1373426363&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=htc+chacha) Android 2.3, crappy battery, poor reviews on engadget, but amazon is okay. 


Those are the three phones that stuck out to me. Considering all of this, is there maybe just no right phone? Am I looking for something that doesn't exist? Or is gingerbread not too bad? 

 Any advice appreciated, including general comments about gingerbread. (food or android flavor, both will do)

Thank you!

[Question Solved] [Success Story]",17,4,5,http://www.reddit.com/r/AndroidQuestions/comments/11sw0c/power_button_broke_how_i_compensated_and_how_you/,"So I pull out my phone to see what's new, and suddenly the power button did not work. The phone wasn't turning on. I imagined that my battery had died and left it at that.

About an hour later, I received a call, took it, thinking I must have somehow turned on my phone within that time. Once done talking, I realized that my power button did not lock the phone! After I took it home, and did my troubleshooting, I thought to myself, how will I ever live with this, as it stood, the only way to wake my phone was to plug and unplug it to my charger.

I wondered what I could do regarding warranty. Sadly, my phone is over a year old and is no longer covered by my warranty from my carrier. (Not to mention it's been rooted)

I looked to the web, and found some people discussing similar issues. Fortunately, I discovered remapping the keys. I remapped my capacitive search button to putting the phone to sleep. I used this app right here.

 http://forum.xda-developers.com/showthread.php?t=850464

However the issue still stood of how to wake my phone. If I was to remap one of my volume rockers to a power button, I would lose control of that button. Luckily, in looking through my custom ROM's ( http://forum.xda-developers.com/showthread.php?t=1839249 ) settings, I found the ability for my volume rockers to wake the phone!

I have no idea if that was the purpose of putting it in there, or why it was included but I'm overjoyed at that. I can wake and unlock my phone via the volume buttons, and once my phone is awake those buttons function fully as volume buttons. To put my phone back to sleep and lock it I simply use the search capacitive button.

When I first discovered this, I was heartbroken about my phone, however rooting my phone to put on a custom ROM and a root-only app to allow me to lock my phone has completely saved my and my android experience.

I've tried nearly everything and its still horrendous,17,6,32,http://www.reddit.com/r/AndroidQuestions/comments/1hipyp/im_incredibly_frustrated_and_on_the_point_of_just/,"Hi AndroidQuestions. Sorry for being overdramatic but i'm at my wits end and cant take this anymore

Backstory: Last march I got my One X, and the battery life wasn't *great* but i expected this and it was liveable. A few tweaks here and there and I could get about a day and a halfs worth of charge with use, which was fab. Sadly about 5 months ago it went a bit hay-wire and the screen stopped working. So I gave it to my network provider and got a replacement

Now, thats where everything seems to be going downhill. As soon as i got the phone, the battery life was absolutely horrendous, completely discharging with use in about 5 hours. I tweaked it and all that jazz but even then i can't really get higher than about 7 hours without it dying. I'd wake up to go to college, listen to music and browse reddit etc, put it in my bag and when i got home it would of been at about 4% battery. 

This is still happening now. I did a test on my phone where i fully charged it, unplugged it, and went to sleep to see what % battery it was at before i woke up. I went to bed at about 2am and woke up at 12, and when i checked my phone it was at 8% battery. Not only that, occasionly when I charge my phone and return an hour or so later, the phone is INCREDIBLY hot and nearly looses all of its battery. So it looses power when its meant to be gaining it. Great!

What the fuck

My phone is no longer a phone, its a really dumbdowned laptop that requires a constant charge. I absolutely hate the fact i now have to take my charger EVERYWHERE for it to function properly.

Not only that, I'm going to the US in just under a month and need my phone to communicate with other people in an emergency. I would of loved to take my HOX with me but at the moment it looks like i'm going to have to take my old Samsung Soul i used when i was about 14. Atleast that holds battery :(

What can I do. I've already claimed on my insurance and I can't really afford to spend money on a brand spanking new phone. I've factory reset the fucking thing about 4 times and the problems are still recurring. I've also downloaded BetterBatteryStats to try and identify the problem, but that hasn't worked

I'm just stuck. I want to have a phone that i can actually use without wanting to snap it in half because its fucking dead.

Sorry if this is a bit strongly worded, i'm just incredibly annoyed.

**EDIT**: Thank you ALL so much for your responses. Following your suggestions, I've installed a custom ROM into my phone and I've also installed a different kernel.

Let me explain.

So, I work IT. I know Windows PC's in and out. I'd go so far as to call myself a power user. However, there's so many versions and subversions of the Android OS, and so many versions of rooted ROM's and all kinds of other things that make this pretty difficult for me to just read and learn by absorbing info...

I work with a dude who has his phone rooted. He says to not install any file managment or task killer apps, but the thing is, Android's built-in file browser sucks, and it's task manager doesn't seem to do it's job half the time.

Chrome locks up when I try to load web pages. Google Play Store and Music seem to just stop altogether randomly. My phone has been moving slowly recently, so at the urging of my coworker I reset to factory.

This gives me a fresh start, so, I am open to suggestion: What should I do? I'd like to be able to know everything that happens on my device, the same way I do my computer, but Android hides data from me. I don't necessarily want to root my phone because I've heard all kinds of horror stories about bad ROMs and phones that just don't want to accept the new ROMs.

Without any request for confirmation, an apk file was downloaded, and when I tried the same thing on firefox, the app even tried to install itself without any action from myself. 

Thankfully, on both occasions [Lookout](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.lookout&amp;hl=en) caught it and flagged the file as a threat. It called it Chargeware?

Should this be possible on an android handset? I mean, when you open a page ending in pdf it will download the file, but for automatic popups to download an apk and try to install it without your permission? Pretty dodgy.

I would start typing in gmail or text messaging or gtalk or browser or dolphin hd, and as soon as i was about to type the third word (right after the second space in the message), the app would stop responding. Wait would make it freeze for a moment then give the same not responding message. Force close would close it, but the problem would return as soon as i relaunched it.

I did a factory reset a few weeks ago due to many other problems with the device, and the current problem comes and goes for hours at a time, and persists even if i reboot it and/or remove and replace the battery.

I've been told to try Liberty custom ROM, but every version i found was for the droid 2 global, which i am told would brick my phone.

Edit - when it crashes, the grey autocomplete bar at the bottom freezes with whatever it was displaying when it froze. This persists until i reboot the phone. So right now it is showing the autocomplete options for the word i was typing the last time it froze and i had to force close. This has at various other times either become a blank grey/white bar that appeared in all apps (but not the homescreen), and been a duplicate of the 1/4"" or so of the screen above it (i.e. gtalk showed two bars to enter text).

My boss gave me three tablets and told me to pick one, so I wanted to ask some people that are more informed than me. Here are my three options:

* Matrix SC 72JB - 4GB - 7'' Screen - 1.2 GHz

NetsGo2 has no camera, Matrix has a front and rear camera (unsure of megapixels), and d2 has a front facing camera of .3 megapixels.

Only need it for very basic functionality--i.e. viewing a pdf and taking some notes--so I'm looking for some other info that can help me make my decision. If anyone has any experience with these devices, please feel free to air out some pros/cons here.

I hate dealing with iTunes at all. The podcast app constantly loses my spot when resuming a stream. Safari and the stock email app on iPhone are also dull. 

My questions about HTC One/Android in general...

1. Does the device basically act like a USB drive when plugged into a computer? As in I can open it up and drag and drop anything on it.

2. Could I be at home on a PC, plug it in, drag some music on to it, and then go to work and plug it into a Mac and drag more music on it without it erasing anything or doing some sync? With iTunes this would erase my music I put onto it at home because it's not also on my work computer. 

3. I know there are android podcast apps, but do they actually work nice? Can you setup subscriptions, set options like how many to keep downloaded, streaming, etc?

4. Does anyone else here run an iPad and an Android phone? Is it confusing, difficult, odd, etc to switch between the 2 systems?

5. Other than the openess of Android in general, does Android bring any other benefits over the iPhone? For example the iPhone has a great ecosystem thats shared between all the apple products, everything works well, it's fast, it's easy, it's foolproof, most apps release first for iPhone, etc.

In the near future, I've been tasked with demonstrating the Note 8.0 in various retail outlets. It's all about having people try the device and seeing some of the possibilities a tablet provides. 

Not unimportant are the apps. I want to have a bunch of apps ready to pique the interest of different customers, from very casual to more advanced users. Real 'hardcore' isn't likely to come into the store, they generally order online so might be 2% of the people I encounter.  
^(If they do come, it's usually only to hold the product before ordering it somewhere cheaper).

Which apps or games do you think have a large 'wow'-factor on tablets?

Thanks in advance!

P.S: I understand some of you have this picture of sales people being *soulless creatures* trying to make you buy *stuff*. However, I get to pick which products I must promote and thus only work with products I am enthusiastic about. I get an hourly pay, no commissions or bonuses, so there's no reason for me to lie to customers.  
I decided to play open card instead of making up a lie and asking the same question, so I hope that in return you guys can help me a bit.

Ideally, this app would work like this:   
* Click desktop icon, recording starts from camera immediately.   
* Still works while multi-tasking so GPS navigation can be used simultaneously.   
* Video recording is constant, but overwrites the video continuously so the final clip is only the last 60 to 120 seconds even if it has been recording for a lot longer (basically enough that I can capture the event it is intended for, like an accident or similar).   
* Video output is to SD card.


Does anyone know of any apps available currently that can do this? Or perharps there is a dev out there that would like to tackle this?

&gt; Allows the app to install new or updated Android packages. Malicious apps may use this to add new apps with arbitrarily powerful permissions.

The app uses a plugin architecture. I've seen it, twice now, prompt me to download updates from private servers, which I assume is to update the plugins.

My question is, what kind of damage can an app do with all permissions granted?

I know that it can do things such as call phone numbers and send text messages without my knowledge.

But can it access or read the data from other applications, namely the default Gmail app? That's the one that really worries me. Your email address is the key to your online life.

What other kind of stuff could such an app get into which may be difficult to infer from the permission list?

**edit:** 

As an addendum, is this article legit? Can an app just request to use an intent from another app to bypass the permission system?

I am new to Android devices and am still getting the hang of the operation and flow. So far I'm really enjoying it with a few quirks which I'm not sure is my ignorance or something wrong with the phone. None are critical, just want the phone to operate as intended. So here it goes:

1) When in sleep mode, if I get a text message, the sound notification goes off, but nothing on the screen...it stays black. I checked all my notification settings (I think), and everything looks to be in place. Is this intended or is there a fix for this?

2) When I open my task manager (stock task manager that comes with the phone), I notice that apps are running that I never opened in the first place. If I close them, close task manager, then reopen, they will be back on (Facebook, Youtube, Maps, etc.). Am I overlooking something?

3) If I add app shortcuts for my music apps to the Music folder that comes with the phone, everything is fine until I power cycle my phone. I go back in and random shortcuts will not be there. They are never the same ones that disappear. Is this based on amount of use of said app? How can I keep them in there. (I've noticed this when power-cycling the phone, but it is very possible they disappear at other times while the phone is on).

Again, these are all things I can live with, but would be nice if there were fixes for the above issues. If a phone reset is what I need to do, I'm ok with that being I haven't downloaded a ton of apps yet and my contacts are backed up to gmail.

I've been thinking of buying a Nexus S (or a Captivate/Vibrant/Intl. Galaxy S) to replace my MyTouch 3G 1.2. My MT3G survived 1.6 all the way to 2.3.5, but I'm sure it won't be able to run ICS. I've always considered my phone to have become outdated really quick due to Android maturing very quickly, with optimization of the OS and optimization of hardware happening at a very fast pace. 

I want to get a new phone that will get ICS and will also last several iterations, so I decided the Nexus S (and Galaxy S line) would probably fit the bill. However... I started wondering if ICS would consume more RAM for the OS itself, therefore leaving less RAM for applications to populate. How much RAM does the system itself take in Gingerbread/Honeycomb? Could 512 be enough to last a few years? I think that Android's use of resources is starting to stabilize, so perhaps future versions of Android will use about the same amount of resources as they do today?

As for the reason I want to get a Nexus S over the Galaxy Nexus... mainly, I'm a student and am trying to save as much money as I can. I'm also not in a contract. I bum off my school's omnipresent wifi, so I need no data (I just don't use the data while off campus.. which isn't often heh).

The one I am most interested in that is currently out is the ASUS transformer. I like that it has a keyboard dock and is (relatively) inexpensive. If I went out and bought one today it would likely be this or the Samsung Galaxy Tab 10.1.

There have been rumors that the next generation of nVidia Tegra chips were due out in tablets as early as this month [Amazon](http://www.engadget.com/2011/06/22/amazon-tablet-with-ti-processor-shipping-as-early-as-august/) and recently [ASUS](http://www.engadget.com/2011/08/17/asus-next-gen-eee-pad-transformer-to-be-first-kal-el-device/). I wouldn't doubt that it was delayed from this date, but by how long is anyone's guess. 

I don't strictly ""need"" a tablet for school, but it would make many classes easier (and professors tend to be more lenient with having a tablet out to look at material online than they do phones, which is how I am currently looking at the online material while in class). 

Also, I want a tablet that would be able to run [Windows 8](http://www.engadget.com/2011/06/01/microsoft-reveals-arm-powered-windows-8-prototypes/) when it comes out. I can't find the article atm, but I know microsoft has shown windows 8 running on the Tegra 3 already, but I don't know if anybody has seen it run on the Tegra 2. This would be more of a luxury than a requirement.

Anyways, as the title says my question is should I wait for a Tegra 3 tablet or go ahead and get one out now?

If you think I should get one now, should I buy the ASUS transformer or the Samsung Galaxy Tab 10.1?

I thought nothing of it, until I realized all of a sudden that my data had been cut-off. I called Straighttalk and they said I had throttled me then cut me off. I explained the situation but they couldn't do anything. I went back to look at my data usage, and 2.2 GB had been used by Google Services...in the span of less than a week. I clicked on Google Services and checked ""Restrict background data"" at the bottom, so this can't happen again. (By the way, what does that even do? Will it not sync at all? Only when I tell it to? Will it sync when I update things on my browser--like my calendar--or does it still have to manually be synced? Will it still sync in the background if on wifi?) Cut forward a week, and my wife happened to look at her data at my urging, and lo and behold, Google Services ate up 1.3 GB of her data in just a few days as well. I restricted background data, and I think that has put it in check. One of her accounts has a sync error as well, but again everything is syncing normally. For the life of me, I can't fix this sync error on either phone.

All this is to say, I don't even know what is happening. How can I fix the sync error? What does restricting the background data even do (see above)? Are others experiencing similar problems?

I really hope you can help me out with this. Today I have noticed a bug that really irks me.





To the folks that are  running stock android 4.2, try this:


While making a call, put it on speaker. Then unlock your device, and try to use your home screen (swipe down your notification bar, use apps, etc) what do you notice?




When I do this, my phone starts flashing. The screen goes off and on. I basically cant multitask with my phone while making a call. Try this doing it with speaker on and off.




Please let me know your experience. I wasn't sure in which subreddit to put this question in.  I would appreciate if Google Edition users and Nexus users can try this (or other users who have android 4.2.2 that I don't know of)

Yesterday morning, I gave my old iPhone 4 to my brother, and then I bought the new Galaxy S4. All in all I love the Android ecosystem, but I miss some features that maybe, just maybe, could be replaced with other alternatives.

1. Starting with iTunes sync. I know that I hated really the iTunes stuff, but I simply miss the folder ""Automatically Add to iTunes"" where I can put all my downloaded or saved music in to that folder and then just sync and go. I would like to know any kind of alternative to iTunes that enables sync with other devices via USB.

2. I'm kinda worried about being robbed, in my iPhone I have ""Find my iPhone"", but there're so much apps in the market, and most of them are paid, are there free alternatives to Security apps? If free apps are not enoguh protection, which one would be more worthy to spend my money?

3. I'm a bit worried about notification center. I know that I have the option to disable all the notifications from a specific app. Is there any way to get ""need to update app"" from the Play Store, like App Store did?

But, yeah, as I did, I'm really really really happy with the change, but you know miss these little features that are really useful :))

I've got a really weird bug in it and I can't find any information on online. When I receive a call it appears on my phone as +614XX XXX XXX (With country code prefixed, I'm in Australia) whereas most of my contacts are saved as 04XX XXX XXX (no country code prefix).

For some reason my phone is not recognizing that the incoming +614XX number is the same as the 04XX number. However, if I make a phonecall to this 'unknown' +614XX number the phone immediately knows who I am calling (i.e. ties the number to the contact).

I've been using Android since a HTC Desire HD and never had this issue before, does anyone know how to tie these contacts together without having to go through and change the 04 in every phone number to +614

I've had my SGS2 for nearly a year now and it's seen some rough times. Most recently it decided that it would be finicky with my chargers, and eventually the OEM Samsung one that it came with did not work (at first you just had to wiggle the cable). The cable from my HTC Evo Shift worked just fine, so I began using that. At that point I had already experienced some weird things regarding charging/battery life:

* Performing a reset on the phone caused the battery to immediately drain to ~6%, regardless of what level it was at before.

* The device would randomly say the voltage was too high or that the battery was too hot to continue charging. Upon touching the device you would not assume it was that hot.

The other day the HTC charger stopped working and I had to play around with it to find a way to get it to charge. I would push the plug in, tilt it up a bit so it was at an angle with the port, and then place something under the charger to mildly keep it at that angle. That usually would work for a bit, but it charged slowly and would often randomly stop. Also, sometimes it would appear to be charging but the battery would stay at 0%. 

I woke up this morning and the device refuses to take a charge, so I switched service back over to my Evo Shift. Does anyone have any troubleshooting advice for me so I can determine if it's the battery or the port that is the culprit here, as well as steps I could take to remedy the issue?

As rumours indicated the Galaxy Nexus was to come out later on in the year, so I declined. Instead, I was offered an alternative of a half price sim only plan until I wanted my upgrade. I accepted this offer, thinking that I’d be able to snap up the Nexus as soon as it was launched.

So around the time of launch by other networks I give T-Mobile a call to see when they’ll have the Galaxy Nexus, and am met with “We do not/will not be offer/offering this handset directly”. And what's worse, the sim only plan they put me on has a 12 month contract on it, meaning I can’t leave T-mobile unless I pay them the “early cancellation fee” which is almost £100!

So my question is do you think it’s worth me paying almost £100 in order to leave T-Mobile and join another network to be able to get the Galaxy Nexus or do you think I should just wait until the new year for the next big phone (assuming tmobile will even stock it)?

Since my iPhone is on it's last legs, I figure I'm going to switch. I'm thinking of the Samsung Galaxy II - I'm a journalist (in training), and it seems to have everything I need in a phone: good camera, long battery life, durability, ability to record voice and video, and it seems pretty durable. (This isn't what I came here to ask, but if anyone has any other suggestions, please let me know)

Here's the thing, though. As a journalism student, I need constant connectivity to the internet - you'd be surprised how much breaking news actually does come through Twitter. I also need to be able to send large files (i.e. high-def photos) to my editors. Right now, I'm on an AT&amp;T family plan (I know, I know), and we have unlimited data grandfathered in. So, I have a few questions:

1. Can I buy a Galaxy II from AT&amp;T at the reduced price, renew the contract, and still keep unlimited data, or does that stay grandfathered in only when it's through an iPhone?
2. Can I buy a Galaxy II at full price, take out the SIM card from my iPhone, and put it into a Galaxy II and keep my unlimited data? Can AT&amp;T tell when I'm using a different phone? Could I get in trouble for this?
3. Is there a carrier that has consistant coverage (I'm in NE Ohio, if that helps) while keeping unlimited data? Every marketing website says that 2GB should be enough for pretty much anyone - is this true?

For some unknown reason, this phone keeps shutting itself off and for the life of me I can't figure out why.

I used the S2 for a long time, we have a lot of them out in the field, and neither myself nor any of our other nurses are seeing this issue.  She will be talking on the phone, or composing an e-mail or text, or even just attempting to turn the phone on using the button in the upper right and the screen will go/stay black.  It will be completely unresponsive to pressing any buttons at all for between 30 seconds to 2 minutes, and then you'll hit the power button and it will boot back up with the Samsung/Sprint splash screens and work fine again for a while.

She is on call constantly and literally dealing with life or death issues and is now forced to set an alarm at night every hour just so she can wake up and make sure that her phone hasn't shut itself off and this is getting ridiculous.

Here's the kicker...this is the second phone that has done this, and the fourth battery.  When it started happening, I swapped the battery out for one of the spares we keep around and it kept happening.  Then it still persisted, so I called Sprint and they sent out a replacement phone with yet another new battery in it.  Even with a BRAND NEW PHONE AND BATTERY this still kept happening, so I took it up to the Sprint store and they tested the battery and said that it was failing and had ""bloating"" so they ordered another battery for it and upon getting it back to the office and putting that brand new battery in the phone did it within 30 minutes.

I've replaced the charger twice, I've had her use it without the case for a few days thinking maybe the case was pressing something, I am at a serious loss and I have no idea how this same issue could keep happening with two separate pieces of hardware and four separate batteries.

However, this one has me stumped.  I first noticed that on my Nexus 4 I could not access Reddit over wifi no matter what browser or app I used, with the exception of Reddit is Fun, and sometimes Reddit Sync. But some functionality in even those apps do not work. Yet, I could get Reddit to load just fine over my mobile network (Straight Talk ATT backbone.) This behavior is not just limited to Reddit. Other select sites like Indeed.com exhibit the same behavior, but the majority of sites I visit work fine.


  In my efforts to figure out WTF is going on I tried it on different wifi networks. Still no Reddit.  Fortunately, I have other devices to do additional testing like my Nexus 10.  The Nexus 10 runs 4.2.2 just like the Nexus 4 and it cannot access the same sites just like like my Nexus 4. Even on different wifi networks.  Since it does not have 3G I could not test mobile network accessibility.  


  I moved on to another device that is running a different version of android.  She has an HTC Amaze 4G running 4.0.3 and not only can her device not access reddit over wifi, but it cannot access it over her mobile network either (Straight Talk T-Mobile backbone.) Again, it does not matter what browser I use, the results are the same. 


  Here is where things get real weird.  I have an ""old"" Evo 4G running some custom ROM version of gingerbread and it has no issue connecting to Reddit. As well as my 2nd gen. IPod Touch and 1st gen. IPad.  They all have no issue connecting via wifi.


  I feel like I am the only one in the world with this issue because I cannot find anyone who is dealing with the same thing.  I have read reviews of people using Reddit News on their Nexus 4s and 10s without issue.  I, however, get a blank screen with it because it cannot access the site.


  The evidence is so conflicted that it is making my synapses misfire.  I am unable to make heads or tails of why this is happening, let alone how to fix it.  Any thoughts or suggestions would be greatly appreciated.


Edit: I forgot to add that all android devices mentioned are rooted if that has any significance. 

Edit 2: Let me apologize. There is an important piece of information I intended to include, but I forgot.  I have written this post on my home network on a desktop PC which accesses Reddit and the rest of the internet just fine.  I have also tried accessing Reddit with my Nexus 4 and 10 on several different networks around town that use completely different routers with the same result, no Reddit.

Edit 3: Did a factory reset. No change. =\

Edit 4: (Solved) There was a left over hosts file under system/etc from Adfree that was the culprit. Once removed everything worked as normal.  Too bad I did not figure this out before flashing a new ROM (Paranoid Android 3.5) on one of my devices to see if that fixed the issue. It did.

And yet I keep running into the same problem: one way or another, I lose the stuff I'm working on.

I'm not always working at home or somewhere with a reliable internet connection. While I'm normally able to get online with my phone as a hotspot, sometimes the connection is flaky. So something cloud-based is not a good solution if it requires an always-on connection.

I have tried Google Docs, and it's not a workable solution. Besides the interface being primitive at best, it keeps stopping as I'm typing and saying it can't connect to the server. When it's unable to connect for a long time, it sometimes loses my recent changes. It's also frustrating to have to stop and wait for the app to connect before I can continue with it.

I've also tried a number of word processing apps. None of them seem to provide autosave functionality that I've found, and the document recovery that they provide can be flaky too. Today I left what I was working on because someone chatted me; when I used the Recent Apps screen to reopen the word processor, I accidentally swiped instead of selecting (an amazingly easy mistake to make), and I lost all of the changes I had made on the document.

Apps like Evernote and Catch are better at saving locally and syncing only when they have a connection, but they're not word processors at all, and I've lost work with both of them in various ways (crashes with Evernote, and switching away from Catch without saving and then not switching back before the work disappeared).

1363803764.0,11,self.AndroidQuestions,1aoekv,"So, I'm a long time web developer, but considering creating an app that I see missing from Android. What am I getting into?",16,5,11,http://www.reddit.com/r/AndroidQuestions/comments/1aoekv/so_im_a_long_time_web_developer_but_considering/,"I have a strong programming background... not a ""web developer"" that doesn't understand how to actually create programs. My question isn't really about *how* to develop... Google has a pretty good SDK and dev tools/tutorials to get started.

I was the PR Director for Occupy Portland, and we used technology however we could. But often the tech side of things was a PAIN in the ass to set up and coordinate with people. Especially since the police would tap some of our phones (yes it happened), illegally spy on us, and generally get information they shouldn't have.

So I searched Google Play for an app for protesters, and the best that I found was [Protest4](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.zapon.protestfour&amp;feature=search_result), which was last updated over a year ago (right near the end of Occupy actually).

So, this is what I'm looking at doing:

- Create a profile, including an avatar, display name, and ""role"" (self defined)
- Create a protest, tagged by topic, dates and location that anyone can join
- The protest has a live ""wall"" that anyone can comment on and post pictures/video to
- Content can be removed from the wall if 2/3 of active users mark it for removal
- Content can be hidden from the wall display on an individual basis
- Inside a protest, you can create an event that is optionally password protected, and can be ""invisible"" or not; an invisible event is only there for people you invite to the event; password protection and visibility are independent settings; events have locations and times, and expirations (i.e. after their expiration, the event is archived)
- Inside a protest you can also create a channel, which is pretty much like a separate wall, that has visibility controls, password controls, invitations, and current status of everyone in the channel (status set by the user)
- You can lock the app by shaking your phone (its an option that can be toggled) or other quick, easy actions (to prevent privileged access from being given to an official that confiscates your phone); it also automatically locks when your phone sleeps, or after switching out of the app
- You can tie it to your email, twitter and/or facebook (ideally you'd be able to tie it to multiple accounts on each) and set up distribution plans for content you post to protest walls, channels, etc. that can be triggered when you submit something
- A copy of the legal information relevant to protesting for your current jurisdiction (yes, this means outside the US as well, and yes this means a ton of content and updates, and yes it means that I'll have to maintain a list of supported countries/locales)
- Recruiting and inviting protesters, via email, the app, a web page, twitter, facebook
- A map showing current activities and reports of police/official activity, including how long ago the report was
- Password screen allows you to type in (or more likely, have some sort of official type in) a fake password that automatically updates the protest wall, your twitter, facebook, distribution plan, etc. letting them know that you've been detained; this allows you to let other people know that you have been detained by giving a false password (that fakes access)

So... what exactly am I getting myself into here? What do you think of an app like this? Some of the things in Protest4 I was already thinking about, but several important features are missing in my opinion.

I know what this kind of rough scope means as a web developer, and approximately how long it would take me, but I don't want to dick around with my first app. I want it to be something that genuinely solves a problem of some kind, and this is what I see (I actually think this will be more useful for protests in non-US jurisdictions for a variety of reasons).

Can someone please solve my problem? I tried posting this to /r/Android and they downvoted it 5 times with no one answering it. 

My friend is in Korea these days and he says he has found a pretty good phone for pretty much free with amazing specs. I already have an HTC One X and didn't think twice about it but out of curiosity I researched it.

This is the phone :

**Pantech Vega Racer 2 IM-A830L**

Specs on GSMarena : 

http://www.gsmarena.com/pantech_vega_racer_2_im_a830l-4738.php

Specs on Android.com , this makes me think it isn't a cheap knock off

http://www.android.com/devices/detail/sky-vega-racer2-im-a830l

Now what I found the most weird thing about this phone was just how cheap and powerful it was. After some researching I found these things about it :

- This company is the second most sold in Korea after Samsung and in front of LG.

- This phone is cheap because of Korean currency value being so low

- In the benchmark tests, this phone beats my HTC One X while it is not even 1/10th of the price my friend is getting it for.

- It is pretty well known in those regions, its custom roms exist, it comes with ICS out of the box (upgradable) and also has 16-32Gig internal with an SD card slot as well. 

- Its battery life is claimed better than my phone too, on top of that it has an additional battery which comes with its own seperate charging dock which also holds the phone as a kind of tripod. On top of that even that battery has an extra protective cover with it.

- The bloatware by Pantech is pretty good too, comes with motion detection gestures out of the box.

I found a 30 minute video of someone going over it :

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMX6dyDWVs

It's advertisements and website also seem to be top notch and the company has been making phones since 1991/92 and I think they also sell them in the US (I'm in UK).

**My questions are these :**

- Should I buy this phone? I do need a second phone and this is pretty cheap and I'll never find a phone with the same specs for this price.

- If I buy this phone can I remove everything from it and change it to a custom ICS installation without any bloatware that comes with it? Like Pantech's own personalized widgets, apps etcetera. I don't really find them appealing and I don't want to get stuck with that. I also hate Samsung's bloatware, even if I could get HTC Sense on this I would be beyond delighted. But I do not want to get stuck with Pantech's bloatware.

- My friend has held the phone and says it is very smooth and solid, comes with protective glass and all that, the reviews on GSMarena rate this higher than most other phones with the same specs too. What am I missing, why is this so cheap then? Why does it have a 1.5Ghz dual core for so cheap?

Please help me make this decision. I really don't want to miss this opportunity but I don't want to get my money lost either. What do you guys think?

I've been flashing CM, both stables and nightlies, onto my Galaxy SII Skyrocket since CM9. I updated to nightly Feb 13, and started experiencing a slew of issues. Many times, an error saying Youtube, or Google Voice, or camera has stopped working would pop up. Also, when I would lock the phone, the phone would sometimes wake up immediately after, or the reboot/shutoff menu would appear.

I began to think this was due to the rom being an unstable nightly, so I reverted back to the stable rom (cm 10.0.0). Everything was functional (no error messages), but the lock screen is still causing the same issues. Sometimes when locking, the phone's backlight will flash and other times, the phone will reboot. Sometimes the lock button is just unresponsive. 

I've tried flashing the stable mod multiple times and can't figure out what I'm doing wrong. My normal process is:

1) factory reset 
2) wipe cache 
3) wipe dalvik 
4) install CM 10.0.0 
5) install the appropriate gapps 
6) reboot 
7) set up google account 
8) test lock button

Any ideas?

The reason I went from Swype to Kii was because I was extremely fed up with how I would clearly glide the word like say shit or fuck, and it would autocorrect to sit or duck. And I've tried to do it VERY slowly, making sure despite the F being close to the D, that my finger did NOT touch the D when swyping the word fuck, for example. When I type it in instead of swyping it, it still autocorrected to duck! 

I am, unfortunately, experiencing the same problem with the Kii keyboard for when I glide, but at least this time when I type it in, it doesn't autocorrect or try to tell me that this word is a misspelling or the like.

This is really frustrating because other words like for example dirty aren't registering, either. DIRTY of all words! It changes to forty or sometimes just simply dirt. Like... seriously? I'm VERY frustrated by this, and I hate that while I can glide to write all other words, when it comes to words like bitch (goes to birch or butch), poop, bastard, git, etc I have to stop and actually touch-type it.

Is this just something I'm going to have to live with? When I had Swype on my other phone, I never had this problem at all (previous phone was Motorola Droid, currently using Galaxy Nexus). It worked like magic. Does this change if I were to pay for the ""pro"" version of Kii?

Rooted and installed CM10 nightly several months ago. Periodically upgraded with nightly releases and all was well, until...

I saw a 'Stable' release and set it to download. Normally, the phone would download the package and wait for me to give it permission to install. This time when I looked to check progress, it had done the flash and was stuck in a boot loop. I don't know if the process was interrupted by a glitch or somebody messing around or what, but there it was.

I tried several things that I read online. The last attempt was this:

- Use Odin to install Eugene's Froyo that won't brick, without re-partition.
- Use Odin to install factory 2.2 with re-partition set.

I got the expected error message about failing to mount after the Eugene step. but the factory install did not work. I have tried this process both with and without the external sd installed.

What fails: Every time I use Odin to install the factory rom, it seems to succeed, but when the phone reboots I get an error that 'Data partition wipe failed.' and the phone boot loops, showing only the Vibrant splash screen then going dark.

I cannot get into the bootloader any more but can go into Download mode. I have searched the web, but in threads where the process I detailed is suggested, no reply is given for people who try that and fail.

Also, I noticed a while back that the internal storage does not show up in Windows when I have the phone connected to the computer. Don't remember if I noticed this before or after going to CM10. The external SD remained visible to windows.

Could my RAM have gone bad? Any suggestions? I know it's old, but it's still a cool machine.

They're just relocated. Chances are, you flashed from a pre-4.2 ROM to a 4.2 ROM without updating your recovery. You notice that your /sdcard folder is near-empty, but your internal storage space is being taken up. Worried, you rush back to recovery and try to restore your nandroid, only to find that it's missing too. *Relax. They're still there.* Follow these steps, and they'll be back to where you want them. 

1. Use a root-enabled file explorer and browse to /sdcard. 

2. Do you see a ""0"" folder? If you do, skip to step 4. If you don't, continue on with step 3.

3. Go to /data/media. All your files are here, right? If not, perform step 2 for this folder. This time, you should definitely see a ""0"" folder if all your files aren't in /data/media.

4. Move everything to /sdcard. Feel free to delete the ""0"" folder. ***DO NOT*** delete /data/media. /data/media/0 should be ok though. 

5. Update your recovery to either the [latest CWM](http://www.clockworkmod.com/rommanager) or the [latest TWRP](http://goo.im/devs/openrecovery). Flash that through fastboot. This will prevent ""your files going missing"" in the future. Note that you can't restore backups made by CWM with TWRP, and vice versa, so flash the one you were originally using.

Now boot into recovery, and you should be able to see your backups!

In the case that your files ***DO*** go missing again, follow these steps.

The problem then arises (for me) when you try return to the inbox either to see other messages or to compose a new one to a different recipient.  Pressing the back button from here just returns to the previous activity (the home screen or whatever) and not the inbox.  There is a link to the inbox, but its a bit buried.  What you can do is, go to the home screen, open the messaging app, press back, open the messaging app again, and you should see the inbox.  Notice that you must go back to the home screen; if you hold down the home button, select messaging, and then press back, you will be stuck in an infinite loop.

* Is 1 GB of RAM enough on the HOX+?

* Is there a huge performace deficit between the dual core GSIII and the Optimus G/HOX+?

* The reason I am considering the GSIII is because I know w CM/AOSP support, can I expect the same for the Optimus G or HOX+?

Really, the deciding factor between these phones is performance and custom ROM support. I'd really like to get the Optimus G, but the locked bootloader and unknown developer support holds me back. Also, the Nexus 4 will be a no-brainer if it comes with enough storage and on contract for AT&amp;T.

Long story short, I bricked it, it was an open box special that I paid $240 for, after going around in circles with customer support they're giving mw $320 store credit because they can't get another Atrix 2(Best mistake I've ever made), so basically I can get a Galaxy Nexus for an extra $50 which is $290 total. OR I can get the Onex for an extra $149, total $389. The S3 is out of my price range tho it is a beautiful device. 

I love flashing roms, developer support is important to me coming from a G2 running Jellybean (and smoothly), I know the Nexus is the obvious choice for pure Google, but the One X seems like a beast in specs, and I don't know if I'm sold on super amoled. 

I checked XDA developers and the one x is rooted, unlocked bootloader, and seems to have a nice variety of roms including Jellybean(very important to me). I don't like sense, I'll give the new version a try but I'll most likely be throwing AOSP or AOKP on the One X straight away.


The way I see it, for an extra $100 I'll have a high end device that'll last me a long time, the specs seem great, screen looks beautiful, but I really really love the Nexus and the whole idea of the Nexus, I'm really torn here, trying to weigh up the pros and cons.

Pros of the Nexus

* Pure Android, what I've always wanted since my first Android phone with sense(Thank god for roms)

* Always wanted a nexus!
* Removable battery(As long as I can get at least 12 hours I wont need to remove the battery)
* Great developer support, guaranteed to be supported for a long long time

Cons of the Nexus

* Specs are kinda outdated
* Knowing a new nexus will be out in a few months is really killing me and I feel I'll regret buying the Nexus right now
* The build quality on the thing just doesn't seem very ""high end""
* The camera seems a little poor

Pros of the One X

* Specs are awesome and seem pretty future proof, could even say ahead of it's time
* Really like the screen, used a friends and it looks great
* Has easy root and unlock, not a Nexus but still pretty easy
* Camera seems better
* Build quality and overall design looks better (to me)

Cons of the One X

* Non removable battery (Is this a big deal I don't know... I always pull the battery on my G2 when it crashes, I have an extended battery in the phone right now, lasts a while but too bulky)
* Bit more expensive (Tho I think it's justified)

I'm leaning towards the One X, as you can probably tell, plenty of power with good developer support (Unless someone tells me there's missing drivers or something like that then I'm going Nexus for sure), it just feels like the wrong time to get a Nexus, with a new one just around the corner, buying it now ensures that I a)Don't get anything off the price because it's currently the latest model and b)Don't get the new Nexus because it isn't out yet. I know one person with a Nexus and one person with a One X, the One X looks a lot cooler to me, it's definitely better spec wise, the only thing left is developer support, so basically I'm just looking for some One X owners to chime in with their experience, and Nexus owners too, haven't fully decided yet. But need to come to a decision by 6pm tomorrow.

I have done a few quick google searches with no results, and also just had a quick search through this subreddit and couldn't find anything. I hope you guys can help.

So this weird thing has started happening with my phone. Whenever I type a word which begins with the letter O (of, or, our, often, etc.) my phone will just freeze up. It happens with everything: messaging, browser, notes, youtube. The only thing I've found that it doesn't do it for is when using the google search widget. 

When it happens I have to exit out of the app and go back in. Sometimes it won't let me exit and I have to open task manager and end the program. Sometimes the keyboard will remain open and I'll have to wait a minute before it closes and is usable again. Sometimes the entire phone will just freeze and I have to restart the thing. The way I'm currently getting around the issue is by typing the second letter, then going back and typing the o. The issue seems to be with the process of pressing the spacebar, followed by the O key. Works fine if the word is the first word of the text.

I have a Samsung Galaxy SII on ICS. I had no problems prior to the update. It's not rooted, whatever that is.

EDIT: **SOLVED!** Thanks so much guys! When trying to find out how to clear the keyboard's cache/data, I found the option to turn off the Swype keyboard which I did because I never use the thing.

For the record, I have a VZW Galaxy Nexus.",18,6,14,http://www.reddit.com/r/AndroidQuestions/comments/xa0ne/took_a_trip_to_verizon_today_they_told_me_some/,"Questions at the end. First, it's story time.

Alright, so I posted yesterday about [my Galaxy Nexus losing signal randomly.](http://www.reddit.com/r/AndroidQuestions/comments/x7wet/verizon_galaxy_nexus_randomly_dropping_all_data/) I was told to go in and request a new phone. 

I went to Verizon and explained the issue to them. The rep told me that it was losing all data because I didn't have location services turned on, and proceeded to turn all of them on for me.^1 I pushed the issue slightly, and they finally took me to their tech support area. They told me other customers had been having the same problem, but it was fixed with a new SIM card. They gave me a new 4G SIM card.^2 I left, a little weary that they were just trying to get rid of me. I walked out of the store, sat down in my car, and looked at my phone. Signal dropped as soon as I turned the screen on. 

So, I walked back in, was put back in the line, and was seen again pretty quickly. I showed the rep that I had the location services on as they had turned it on for me. While I was showing the location services status to the rep, the signal cut out again. I pointed it out to the rep and was taken back to the tech area again. They took my phone back in the back and left me standing there for about 10 minutes, just waiting. During this time, the rep walked out twice and got additional reps. Eventually they came back out and told me that there were a few things that might be able to help. They uninstalled Advanced Task Killer, explaining that it could be interfering with the 4G radio.^3* Then, they uninstalled a battery widget I had installed to tell me the % of battery I had left in the notification bar. I was told that this battery widget could cause my signal to drop randomly. 

Finally, they explained that it was a known issue and Verizon would be releasing an update within a week or two that would be fixing the issue. If I wasn't satisfied after that, then I would still be under the manufacturer's warranty and I would be able to swap the phone out for any other phone. 


***

Frankly, I feel like Verizon just fed me a large amount of bullshit to get me out of the door without giving me a new replacement phone. What do you think?

***

**Questions**

1. Is it possible that not having location services turned on caused my phone to randomly drop all of it's data and signal? 

2. Could a faulty SIM card be the cause of this? If so, what are the odds that this many SIM cards could be faulty?

3. Can a task killer somehow disrupt a 4G LTE signal? If so, how?

4. Can a battery widget somehow disrupt a 4G LTE signal? If so, how?

I made a post somewhere about it happening the 17th of May, so it started somewhere before that.
My phone will freeze for 2 seconds and then reboot itself.

It started while I was on stock 4.0.2 and now I'm on stock 4.0.4 IMM761. I have a GSM Galaxy Nexus.

It only happens just after the phone has been woken up and something is started. The most common (as it's my go-to-way of forcing it, to see if it's still there) is after waking up the phone, sliding down the notification bar and pressing ""settings"", which doesn't open but the phone freezes and reboots itself. I first discovered this when I wanted to go in there to change screen brightness. It's also happened when I went into the notification bar and pressed a battery app there. It doesn't matter if I'm doing it in the lock screen or after the lock screen.

It's also happened when I wake up the phone and enter the camera through the lock screen.

It also regularly happen if I set an alarm in the morning. When my alarm is suppose to play it freezes and reboots, and when it's rebooted, the alarm has been cancelled without ever playing.

It doesn't need to wake from deep sleep to do this, I've had it happen mere minutes after trying to see if it's there.

I don't know if it has something to do with this, but the 21st of April I tried to do the ""clear google services framework"" trick to force 4.0.4 ( I was on yakjuxw), but it did not work and I remember my phone acting janky and I was scared it messed something up, but I seem to remember it getting better. I can't remember what exactly it did though.

I've read that 4.0.4 would fix the reboots that a lot of people were having (don't know if it was the exact same kind of reboots as mine) so I did this to make my phone a yakju (translated from Danish):

[LINK!](http://translate.google.dk/translate?sl=da&amp;tl=en&amp;js=n&amp;prev=_t&amp;hl=da&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;layout=2&amp;eotf=1&amp;u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.ndroid.dk%2F2012%2F01%2Fvaer-blandt-de-forste-til-at-modtage-opdateringer-til-din-galaxy-nexus%2F)

I did that the 8th of June, and it worked flawlessly and I was on 4.0.4 IMM761 in no time. Unfortunately it did nothing to stop these reboots.

As part of the process of making my phone a yakju I, of course, did a complete factory reset, although I did make a copy of my entire SD and transferred everything over again after the process.

These past two weeks I've tried the following to fix it:

Clear cache partition in recovery.
Clear google services framework.
Clear media storage.
Tried to uninstall many apps, 2-3 a day, to see if they were causing it, re-installing them when I still had the same problem. If it's an app causing this I've yet to find it, but I find it weird that an app could be causing this.

It happens once a day, but never close to each other. It seems that some time has to pass before it can happen, and it only ever happens just after the phone is woken up, either by my alarm or by me opening the notification bar and pressing something there.

Despite being a massive Android fanboy, I have *no* idea how modern devices like the SGS2/3, Razr Maxx, etc. treat internal vs. external storage and how it appears to both basic apps (i.e., music players) and file browsers. **Short-version is: how does the phone treat SD vs. internal storage?**

For instance, if I buy a 16GB SGS3 tomorrow, then stick a 64GB SD card into it, how will things be treated? Will I have 80GB to install apps to? Will I see an 80GB unified virtual partition when I mount the phone to my PC to drag movies and music to?

Or will the 16GB and 64GB be kept wholly separate? Will I be ""allowed"" to drag music to the internal phone storage? Will I be able to directly install apps (not ""move-to"") the SD partition? If I do have music in both places, how does the average app (say, Poweramp) go about handling that? How about the average file explorer?

Essentially, I am curious as to whether the SD/internal split is as severe as it is on the D1 (no installation directly to SD card without massive hax, all downloads/PC transfers go to the SD card, etc.) or not, because that will play into my decision of whether to buy a 16GB or 32GB model.",,False,self,t5_2rtri,False,,default,True,t3_un9q8,http://www.reddit.com/r/AndroidQuestions/comments/un9q8/how_does_a_modern_android_phone_treat_internal_vs/,

What's the best way to do this?",11,0,2,http://www.reddit.com/r/AndroidQuestions/comments/lkl9j/i_want_to_wipe_my_incredible_but_its_flashed_to/,"I have an HTC Incredible that was flashed to Cricket by some guy I found in the paper. 

However, it has a few problems that I hope a full wipe will fix. Here's a breakdown of said problems:

    1. Low on app data space message appears erroneously.   
I've moved every app that I could over to the SD card, but the message still comes up. Also, when looking at SD &amp; phone storage, SD has over 2GB free, internal phone storage has 5.96GB free, and phone memory has 609MB free. 

    2. Gmail doesn't work at all.  
I had 3 accounts associated with it, and none of them sync anymore. This happened about 3 days ago. I tried to clear data from the application menu, and now it just says ""Your email will appear shortly"". I've tried this over 3G and wifi to no avail.   

    3. Notifications only work with SMS / MMS. 
    Nothing else notifies until reboot. Then it only notifies once.  
Wordfeud and Facebook don't notify at all anymore until a reboot.

I saw [this](http://www.cricketusers.com/verizon-htc-droid-incredible/8128-full-flash-htc-incredible-cricket-wireless-talk-text-mms-internet.html#axzz1bOhPnBhr) tutorial, but can't find my MIN that's supposed to be entered in the second video.   

I would take it back to the guy who flashed it before, but I don't want to pay another $40 to run into these problems again. If I do get some or all of these issues again, I'd like to be able to wipe it and fix it for free.

The phone is rooted by the same guy who flashed it. When he gave it back to me, there were placeholders on the homescreens where my apps were, but the apps were uninstalled. I don't know how he rooted without wiping it.

Any ideas would be greatly appreciated. I don't mind putting on a different ROM, but I think the Froyo for Cricket would be best for me.

Done tons of research, hit the usual places... but most of the time, the info differs greatly from place to place and doesn't do the best job of explaining things.

Ok now, my 1yo HTC One X died a 4 weeks ago and it's been sent for repair since (under warranty). Since it's been 4 weeks, and there's no end in sight, apparently something in the german consumer laws makes that they have to buy it back from me, for a fraction of the original price that is. (Apparently it'll be between 300 and 400€ and I bought it for 500€ a year ago).
400€ would be a very decent price, 300 would be acceptable...

The fucked up thing is that I have to say if I want them to buy it back before I even know for sure how much money I'm gonna get... 

Anyway, I'm gonna go the store (mediamarkt in germany) this afternoon and see if there's something I didn't understand correctly.... (they ship the rest of the accessories to htc, htc evaluates the price and gives them my money...)

So I have to buy a new smartphone... which one should I get between the N4, HTC One, or GS4 ?

In my understanding of things, the N4 is a great phone and still holds the best quality/price ratio. 

For the One, it seems to be a great phone but the problem I had with my One X and the fact that they were not able to get a new motherboard for it in less than 4 weeks, plus the fact that they seem to forget about they're last gen flagship cellphones quite fast...... i'd rather not - unless it's really, really, really better than every other thing that has ever existed....

GS4... seems great but with a cheap design/aspect... 

what do you think ?

Would there be any way for this to be done without physical access to the device(s). ANY help would be greatly appreciated on how to get rid of this on our phones.

So far I am absolutely loving the Note 2, but there's some things about the OS which annoy me.

* **Notifications**! - There's no system wide notification centre like there is in iOS (or maybe I just haven't found it?). At the moment I have widgetlocker set up with NiLS which is pretty buggy and ugly. I'd like to use the native lockscreen but that doesn't show notifications. StatusBar+ also manages some notifications while the device is unlocked but sometimes they fail to show and generally its unreliable. 

* **Lockscreen** - Kinda covered in the previous point. I'm using widget locker with a jellybean theme and I find it sometimes doesn't unlock properly. Also, when using the camera shortcut it sometimes opens to the gallery, very frustrating if you're in a rush!

* **Statusbar** - At the moment I am using StatusBar+ which allows a bit of customization but not really enough. In the statusbar I want battery percentage, time, cellular signal in dBm and data type (3G, 4G etc..) OR wifi icon. As well as dynamic icons such as silent/vibrate, new notifications, alarms set.

* **Shortcuts** - On iOS there was activator which was great for assigning tasks for long home button press, long menu button press etc... I can't seem to find a way to change the default actions. 

* **Multitasking** - I'm not a big fan of the current recent apps screen which appears on long home button hold. Only 2/3 apps are shown at a time and generally its very clunky to use. Is there an iOS like multitasking bar available?

I am comfortable with flashing new ROMs, as I imagine I'll have to do to get some of these features, and my device is rooted.

I currently have an HTC HD7 Windows Phone 7 on T-mobile that I've had for over two years. My contract has ended (yay!). However, I desperately need to cut back on expenses as I cannot afford to keep spending $92 a month (boo!). I am thinking about switching to a prepaid carrier--Virgin, probably--and I am looking at a couple different phone options, including the HTC One V. Although I had no real issues with the Windows Phone and liked the UI a lot, it seems like Android is just a safer bet for the future and gives me the most options. 

I see that different phones have different versions of Android, and it looks like the newest of the new is Jelly Bean, but there are phones (like the HTC One V) that run Ice Cream Sandwich and even some phones that use the older versions. My questions are:

* If you buy a phone that comes with, say, Ice Cream Sandwich, can you upgrade to Jelly Bean? Does this depend on the phone's hardware? Is it easy?
* What happens to your apps if you have an older version? Is there a point at which you can't run the apps anymore because your version is too old?
* Also, and I realize this is going to sound really naive, but how do you sync your Android with your computer? Like iPhone uses iTunes and my WP7 uses Zune. How does this work with Android?

For some reason, Android seems to confuse me, perhaps because people on reddit seem to hyper-customize them.

You all seem very helpful, so I'll ask my question here. I'd like to first apologize if this is the wrong subreddit. I've checked /r/android and didn't find anything there, in the rules/FAQ's, etc.

A few months ago I flashed Eclipse 1.3.2 on my Droid 4. It ran well, but lately I've been getting data drops and while it's always fixable, I'd rather just get a new ROM. Unfortunately every time that I try to flash a new one, I can't get it to work.

I'd like to have [CM10](http://www.droidforums.net/forum/droid-4-roms/231899-unofficial-cm10-1-jb-4-2-1-rom-development-01-23-mms-fix.html) or [Liquid JB](http://www.droidforums.net/forum/droid-4-roms/234589-liquid-jb-4-2-rom-droid-4-xt894.html) on my phone to enjoy Jelly Bean. 

I'll boot into recovery mode via safestrap. Afterwords I'll factory reset, clear cashe, clear Dalvik cashe, and then format system before installing the zip file for CM10 (then the gapps) or Liquid. With CM10, I'll get stuck at the Cyanogen boot screen (with the rotating badass boot logo) and with Liquid, it's just a blank screen that's lit up.

I've tried a few times and I'd like to believe I know at least a little bit about how to flash a ROM to my phone, but for some reason this time I can't get it.

We're developing an Android application to perform condition checks on delivery/collection, rather than using paper -- we picked Android as the platform a couple of years ago, then the project went a bit awry, with the outsourced developer that created V1 not necessarily delivering *quite* what we wanted, albeit delivering something within spec. Yeah, I know, poor spec-writing.

So we're starting kinda-over, and building the app in-house. Great news is, compared to when we started, Android has come a long way -- so, we've taken the decision that since we're going to have to buy the devices anyway, we may as well target only ICS upwards. The new app, thus, targets ICS and JB, although we'll obviously have to support 4.2 too once that's launched (next week?)

There's a lot of work still to do and we're potentially months away from launch, but, the question on my mind is what our ""go-to"" device should be, for said launch.

We've got a couple of Nexus 7 tablets kicking around, and they're great in a lot of ways, and of course we love the price point (there are a lot of tablets &lt;£200, but no other quality ones I've seen), but there's currently no 3G, and no rear-facing camera, both of which are deal breakers (3G less so, we could get a bunch of MiFi or similar devices)

We care about price because these are going to get broken; we care about ruggedness, but not so much as we care about the availability of a choice of decent cases; we care about quality but not so much that we want to spend several hundred per device on the best possible thing out there. Our experience with no-name (e.g. Storage Options, ViewSonic) tablets has been pretty awful.

Given all of this, /r/AndroidQuestions... whose tablet ranges should I be looking at?

We don't really have much to complain about in the 4 years we have owned them beyond AT&amp;T's crap service.

We want to jump ship from AT&amp;T and here is what we are looking at:
1) Verizon. I have confirmed that Verizon signal in my home is very good.
2) US Cellular. I still have to get someone to test in our home. But I have heard VERY good things from local subscribers.

Sprint is our only other option locally. Their signal, etc in my home is very bad. So, unlimited minutes and data would be nice, but not an option.

**If I had to guess, we will be going Verizon. Also, if I had to guess, my wife will want to stay with an iphone whereas i might do the Galaxy sIII.**

My computers:
1. PC hooked up to TV monitor that functions as our home media center.
2. Macbook Pro - My laptop that I use to do design. 

Currently, the iTunes on my Macbook is where everything is at and synced. Ideally, I do not want this comp to house all the music, etc. that we use. I would like to use it for design mainly. I will have a little bit of music on there, but only to be played from the machine, not synced to any phone or anything.

So, here are my questions, ideas, etc.

1. As I mentioned above, my wife might stick with the iphone if I can't convince her. If she does, how do i manage the music for both phones easily? All her music would be housed in itunes on my pc, and i would just have a folder with mp3's for my android? The thing is, I don't want to duplicate, etc. since that it eats up a ton of memory.

2. I know if we both went with SIII's it would be a lot easier in terms of music management. We both have our 16g iphones full, so the idea of a 32-64g Galazy SIII is appealing, and we would certainly use a 64g sd card. Basically, we want to hold a ton of songs as we listen to music nonstop on these devices. So, that being said, what would I do to get all of my itunes stuff from my Macbook, to my PC. Itunes as a manager would be fine by me, and I have heard of programs that can do this (Easy Phone Sync) but I also heard that it only works in the UK.

I will add to this as answers come, etc. and more questions pop up.

What a mistake!  I really should have looked into it first, but I didn't.  I figured I'd just use Google Maps on my PC to setup our custom route to get us there via the places we wanted to see, send it to my phone, open it in Google Maps and hit Navigate.  Seems logical.  Unbeknownst to me Navigation doesn't read custom routes - it just sets a new route from origin to destination and we ended up missing a lot of the sites.  Also in north central PA there's little to no cell coverage so we had the obvious technology breakdowns there.  Are there any Android GPS apps that meet some or any of my wishlist?

* Easy custom route implementation.  Like Google Maps route dragging would be ideal; done on the PC, saved and sent to phone
* No reliance on an actual data connection.  Once the route is sent to the phone the phone should download all of the relevant maps that'll be used on the trip and cache them on the phone
* Decent turn by turn navigation, lane change diagrams etc.

Now the bonus wish list:

* Diverge routes from a point or points on a given trip route.  For example, navigate to town ""X"" and from there have custom routes setup - fast, scenic and slow, less scenic but quicker etc.  So when you get to town X the app prompts you ""which route do you wish to take from here to get to your destination?""
* Easy to set POI or waypoints.  For example, tag a particular brewpub that looks like a good lunch stop on your route.  Have the app notify you ""You are 10 minutes from a designated lunch stop - navigate here or continue driving (next lunch stop is 40 minutes along your route)""
* Fastest route from here button.  Anywhere on your route have a menu button that changes nav to quickest route to destination from here
* Breakdown a trip into ""legs"".  For example, leg 1 of trip to get to vacation spot, leg 2 is side trips around vacation spot, leg 3 is return home via a different route than leg 1

Are there any navigation apps that meet some or all of these wishlist items?  I don't mind paying for one like Sygic, Navigon, Route 66 but it's difficult to tell from their websites which of these features can be done.  The custom routing created on a PC and stored / cached maps are a must have feature.

- error messages. so many error messages. while i'm typing a text, the same damn error message keeps popping up over and over, in hyper fast succession. getting an incoming call? can't get at the answer button, because it's doing hyper fast error alert to some program in the phone crashing. i press quit. quit. quitquitquitquitquitquitquitquitquitquitquitquitquitquitquitquitquitquitquitquitquitquitquit missed the call. the program that crashes is usually the one that turns peoples phone numbers into names in the messages and contacts lists

Now, that's mostly supposition on my part. I KNOW I read that there's some sort of SiriServer, and the rest of that just sorta flows from that one central idea. (If you're going to require an internet connection to use Siri, might as well push all the leg work onto the server side, thus reducing the processing power the phone needs.)

For about a month now, I've been researching potential Android phones to buy. The Xperia Play was an interesting choice, but the reviews on it were rather lukewarm. I do hear the phone portion of it is actually quite great despite being a bit behind in terms of hardware, but the lack of an official games library is what really bogs the phone down. However, earlier this week I went to a Verizon store that had the phone on display, played around with it, and really enjoyed my experience! The lack of a fleshed out games library on the official side of things isn't even that big of a worry of mine, as the majority of gaming I plan on doing is through emulators, which this phone is supposedly awesome at doing.

Another thing to note is that this is the first Android phone I will ever own. I was really considering waiting for the Galaxy S II, but I would really enjoy using a physical gamepad to play games on, as it could make fast-paced games like Metroid: Zero Mission, for instance, actually playable. In addition, the phone is only one cent through Newegg or Amazon Wireless if I renew my contract through Verizon (and I'm eligible for an upgrade), minus the cost of the data plan and such. I've heard good things about Amazon Wireless, and I understand the early activation fee and the potential issue of neither side taking responsibility for fixing my phone if I need to get it fixed, but are there any other catches I might be missing, or is Amazon Wireless really that legit?

So, what do you guys think?

I love most of it, and have gotten used to how things work. The one thing I can't find is a good music player. The iPhone essentially works pretty much like an iPod so it is a great music player but I keep getting frustrated with the Android apps for music. I will list below my complaints and requirements.

I use an Ubuntu PC and a Mac OS X laptop as my primary computers. Ideally whatever program I use will work with one of those two, not necessarily both. I use a Windows VM if needed but that is just a pain.

First I would like for syncing of music to work sort of like it did between the iPhone and iTunes. Plug it in, and it syncs both ways. Keeps my playlists, ratings, etc.

Second, when playing music, I want to be able to use headphones, ideally with multiple buttons. Volume up/down and song skip are very important as I usually listen to music while mowing and hate having to pull my phone out of my pocket to change songs or change the volume. 

I need to be able to still receive phone calls while listening to music. I am not sure why but while using google music I missed a phone call, it's like it didn't ring through the headphones like the iPhone would have.

Finally, it needs to be able to play all my music offline, for some reason google music kept on failing every so often to play some of my music. I haven't even looked into why yet because I didn't really like their only 1 player at a time limitation. I often leave music playing out of my computer in the house while I go outside and my wife stays inside. I need to have music on both places. 

I've tried so far songbird and google music. I remember trying something else early on but don't remember the name. Songbird really sucked at using the headphones with buttons, maybe I just need to get different headphones.

What should I do?,9,3,14,http://www.reddit.com/r/AndroidQuestions/comments/1k94i6/im_getting_a_gs3_after_a_long_time_with_a/,"I hated my Charge, and was just informed today that I'm getting a Galaxy S3.

The Charge sucked. I couldn't run anything at all in the background, and was really careful about what I installed on the bloody thing. 

Now that I'm getting a decent phone, what should do with it that might be  useful? I'm no stranger to technology (The Charge was rooting running Tweaked 3), but I'd rather not root this one, because of the warranty and all that. 

Is there anything really awesome I should try out that's new since Gingerbread?

Thanks for the advice!",,False,self,t5_2rtri,False,,default,True,t3_1k94i6,http://www.reddit.com/r/AndroidQuestions/comments/1k94i6/im_getting_a_gs3_after_a_long_time_with_a/,

Any idea how boned i am?,9,1,1,http://www.reddit.com/r/AndroidQuestions/comments/1k7jow/loss_of_functionality_on_lg_motion_after_root_any/,"So, i rooted my phone the other day using instructions that seemed fairly consistant across various tutorials. Bassically consisting of: install device drivers on pc, install systembackuptest on phone, reboot phone, and then install superuser. Initialy systembackuptest slowed the phone down and completely broke firefox and chrome. After completeing the process everything returned to normal, and stayed that way for a couple days. Then my phone died and when I rebooted the phone it started running slow and both browsers went back to being inoperable. I think i was supposed to delete systembackuptest but i arbitraraly neglected to do so and i think that might be the problem? I deleted it anyway after the fact and tried switching superuser on and off but nothings changed.

It seems it had some sort of kernel hiccup or something of that sort. Thank you everyone for your help. You guys are super nice! Consider me a subscriber to /r/AndroidQuestions ! Thank you again!!**

I used my phone from around 8:30 to 10:15 using BaconReader, and it went from 100ish to below 70% -- which felt very fast. Then, when charging it, it took over an hour to get 90% (using a wall charger, not a USB port).

Graph [here](http://i.imgur.com/TwPOhY0.png).

I feel like the discharge was twice as fast as it normally is, and the charge time was way too slow.

Most of the power went to the screen, even though I have Lux going and it was on ""Dark"" setting.

All apps were closed other than BaconReader.
