I'd like to thank all of you for laying the foundation for this, the staging platform for Merchandising Initiative Chapter I: ""Expatiated Gratuity Obligation"". In the next few months, coinciding with becoming subreddit of the day for March 18th and the influx of new readers, each subscriber will be outfitted with a completely optional mandatory opt-out Non-Pirate-Pedophile retina display module.

Once slotted into the eye by your CD-ROM drive, the display module will charge a small remuneration fee for every word definition that is viewed by a subscriber. I know this fee is a contentious issue, which is why the new management has chosen to only charge for the *definitions* of the words, while the words themselves will remain freemium freeplay(until 2013 Q3)!

Also, for an additional Gold or Platinum membership, sponsorship messages and retina-shocks for ignoring popup ads will be waived!

If you are uninterested with the Bronze subscriber package (which you have agreed to become a part of after clicking on the subscriber button for this subreddit), simply post a submission in the board of a picture of you holding two forms of photo identification and a sign which clearly states, in print, ""I opt-out of being a Non-Pirate-Pedophile."" Our local trained veterinarian will come to your house or place of business to distribute legal documentation, serve notice of the operation, literature and perform the procedure within two months!

Thank you for your patience, your continuing support of literature, and please keep submitting words!

The English usage of the Latin word for -

* as; in the capacity or character of

* in so far as

-is quite varied and fills a couple of very useful roles when talking about a thing which may be thought of in multiple respects.

**(All following information from ShreevatsaR's response on [this page](http://english.stackexchange.com/questions/8970/how-is-the-word-qua-used) which I have pasted below)**

Qua can usually be read as the word ""as"".

It is an occasionally useful (and rarely used) link-word in English. I was just reading about qua in Fowler's (incl. the 3rd ed by Burchfield) a couple of days ago. Says Fowler: ""The real occasion for the use of qua occurs when a person or thing spoken of can be regarded from more than one point of view or as the holder of various coexistent functions, and a statement about him (or it) is to be limited to him in one of these aspects"":

""Qua lover he must be condemned for doing what qua citizen he would be condemned for not doing.""
Here, ""the lover aspect is distinguished from another aspect in which he may be regarded. The two nouns (or pronouns) must be present, one denoting the person or thing in all aspects (he), and the other singling out one of his or its aspects (lover, or citizen).""

This was the only way in which Fowler preferred the word be used, but in fact (notes Burchfield), it's often used in other ways:

between identical nouns (""X qua X"") as an emphatic version of ""as"":
""The presence of actual words is apt to confuse any estimate of the evocative power of the music qua music.""

""I don't think that 'Hard Times' is a particularly good novel qua novel, whatever it may be as a social document.""

""James Kirkup's poem about Jesus … is … an indefensibly bad poem qua poem.""
And sometimes, merely as ""as"":
""It cannot, qua film, have the scope of a large book."" [i.e., it cannot, as a film,…]

""Qua phonetician, de Saussure has no interest in making precise the notion of species.""

""Dressed in an Armani suit and espadrilles, he plays a cop qua existential hero.""
But the word can seem pretentious, so you may want to avoid it — it usually adds nothing over ""as"", anyway.

Querencia is a place where one feels secure, ‘a place from which one’s strength of character is drawn.’ In Spain, it is the place in the ring where the wounded bull goes to renew his strength and center himself, ready for a fresh charge. It's a place in which we know exactly who we are, and from which we speak our deepest beliefs.

I'm not really interested in plumbing the depth of tumblr any further, (frankly, just the effort of typing the word without even the appropriate 'e' in its place is a hard road to hoe as is), so that's where my investigation's going to stop in that regard.

This isn't the first time that content from this domain has been submitted to this subreddit, although it is the first time in a long while. I think those got through during that early age because I don't always check the citations for the definitions. I still don't, but I didn't use to either.

Anyway, the long and short of it is that due to the uproar surrounding that submission, I'm amending the rules to preclude submissions that don't come from some kind of certified dictionary website like dictionary.com or merriam-webster.com.
