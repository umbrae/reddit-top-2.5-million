For brevity, just gonna lay out some framework, rather than a full narrative, as my heart is still pounding wild *and* I'm sitting here at an [8], and it's not from trees.

* First year university student; this year has been kinda rough (left family, boyfriend, friends, dog, etc etc)
* Few friends besides a small group of amazing people (none of them want to touch weed though :( )
* One of these, (who we will call 'Ben') is my best friend.  Hot, can't lie and say I was not attracted to him; has had a gay experience in the past but these days he is 100% straight.  We work out together, go out together, hang, study, etc.  We are two damn peas in a pod.
* We get invited to a small party (one of his other friends).
* He doesn't really want to go, as he knows that a few of his other pot-smoking friends are going to be there, but I tell him he needs to blow off some steam, so I talk him into it.
* And here we go...

Shots, snacks, video games.  Kick ass get together.  Weed comes out.  Most imbibe, some don't.  I do.  Ben doesn't.  Ben sees me getting high (is practically sewn to my hip).  He looks like he is bored, because most of us are sitting around stoned and a few of the non-smokers left.  I kiss him on the cheek and tell him to relax, don't feel like he is being pressured into doing it.  He suddenly wants to try.  Says he is afraid of the lighter or something (I think he thought he'd fuck up or do it wrong, or it'd be hot or something).  The friend that invited us (he gets a best friend metal for this) suggests a shot gun.

FUCK_YES.jpg

I act non-chalant (but let's face it, I was already high as shit.)  grab a bowl, load it up, hit it, grab the back of his neck.  (This contact alone sets my penis off, quickly going from flaccid to diamond-hard).  I lean in, he leans in.  He starts inhaling, I start exhaling.  He pulls the entire fucking thing, doesn't even cough.  Meanwhile, I feel like I am going to need a pacemaker a few years early just because of this.

5 minutes later, he is giggling adorably.  30 minutes later, he exclaims he wants another.  Who am I to refuse him?  Get another one ready.  He leans in, I lean in.  He keeps leaning in.  His lips touch mine.  I pretty much die.  I kiss him back.  I feel his tongue trying to come in.  Say fuck it to the smoke, blow it out, go back for a real kiss.  Get it.  (Meanwhile, everyone else is at a [9] *and* blown away by these two dudes kissing (they didn't even know I was gay).)

I break the kiss.  Ben says we need to go.  He looks freaked suddenly.  We leave.  On the bus home.  Didn't say a word.  I am dying inside all over again, and not in a good way.  Still high as a kite.  I normally get off a stop before him, so I stand at the appropriate time.  Suddenly feel his hand in mine.  He pulls me back down.  Keeps his hand in mine.  My heart is again pounding like a goddamn jackhammer.  We go a stop further, his stop.  We go back to his apartment.

He tells me he's been in love with me for a few months, and this may just be the weed, but he wants to be with me forever.  Magic words.  Pants flew.

5 hours later, our balls are completely drained. He's on his bed, exhausted from last night, and legitimately smiling while asleep.  I'm about to make him breakfast, hoping that when I wake him up, the spell won't be broken.  Thank you, marijuana.

If you got this far, congrats, you win three more internets.

**TL;DR:** Me and a non-ent best friend and crush  (I've been secretly in love with him for a few months) attended a party, performed a shot gun which led to a fantastically hot kiss, followed by his professing his love to me, and our having wild sex.  Weed is a miracle.


**EDIT:  So, holy shit.  Holy shit what the fuck I love my life holy shit.**

Spell is not broken.  He says that he has been waiting for last night to happen for a long time.  He seems to be unaware that I have been crushing back on him all this time.  He told me that I was the person that galvanized his sexuality *happy tears* and that he wants to become official whenever I am cool with it.  Sometimes life just works.

Also his friend saw me on the quad today.  We chatted for a bit.  Not super awkward, but it had a ""so-how-was-kissing-that-dude"" feel.  Told him the truth.  He told me that he wasn't weird about it, wants to hang out again sometime.  Not gonna read into that at all for now.",,False,,t5_2s43r,True,,,True,t3_qx8oa,http://www.reddit.com/r/LGBTrees/comments/qx8oa/long_time_lurker_need_to_share_the_events_of_this/,

One of my best friends growing up (12-20 years old) was this kid called Nick. He introduced me to trees; thus freeing me from horrible side effects of the medications I was on. 

Mid-highschool he came out of the closet and felt the backlash of ""Midwestern Tolerance"". I was taken back at how differently he was treated by his former friends. They forgot how thoughtful, intelligent and caring he was, all because of a sexual preference. I still to this day can't imagine why people give two shits about what consenting adults do together. 

Eventually we went to separate universities and lost touch. I can never thank him enough for the lessons he has taught me about accepting who you are, regardless of the consequences. 

tl;dr Friend taught me that trees and gays were A-Okay, life better because of it.

And it hit me that I was kind of homophobic in high school. It wasn't that I hated anyone, but I used to think that military/marriage/societal situations were neither unjustifiable nor unfair. Since coming to college, I've changed, of course. I've told this to one of my good friends who also happens to be gay, and said it was probably because of my immaturity and traditional/religious/societal background.
One constant, though, through these changes, was that I really like lesbians. I don't know why this didn't click when I was in high school. But my immature hypocrisy aside, I've never apologized for the way of thinking I held for nearly half a decade; so, I'm sorry.

I am a 19 year old FtM transguy. I've been having a lot of issues with familial support and self-esteem lately, as well as deciding on my chosen name.

The best part of my Holidays this year, the best present I could have asked for, was a conversation I had with my mom, about my name. 

“Oliver?” She said to me. “Really? Oliver? are you sure?!” She really dislikes the name.

“That’s what I always thought you were going to name me,” I said, confused.

“NO!” She yelled. “No way. I thought about it for about half a minute, and then decided I really hated that name.”

I was stumped. When I was a child, I found a baby name book with ‘Oliver’ starred, like that was it, that was my name. I attached to it from a young age. “Oh. Well, what do you think, then? I’ve been going back and forth between Oliver and Aiden. I don’t really know what to do.”

She looked at me long and hard for a moment, like she wasn’t really sure what to make of me and then said, “Dylan. You were supposed to be Dylan; all the doctors told me you’d be a boy. I’d named you Dylan before I was any wiser.”

I turned the name over in my head, let my mouth bend around it. Dylan. Dylan Joseph. 

You know the feeling you get when you’re really anxious over something - an exam, for example. You’re waiiting so impatiently to find out how you did on that exam, and then the professor hands back your papers and you see you made a big ol’ A, and you feel, for that brief moment, like you’re on top of the damn world. Like everything you’ve done in life is right, that everything fits. That’s the feeling that came over me at that instant, and I’m still swimming in it.

Dylan. 

Dylan Joseph.

DJ.

She had absolutely no clue and was stunned, but was immensely supportive.

Needless to say, as I'm sure many of you have experienced it, it felt incredible to finally let loose 7 years of all of this built up. We talked for hours about it, about me, about life, about what to do next. I feel like I can breathe again for the first time in a very long time.

I've been lurking in LGBTrees for about 8 months now, and I've been smoking trees for about a year and a half. Trees definitely opened my eyes and my hears, and It's been you guys that have helped me come to terms with who I am—and not just accept myself but love myself. 

I'm just extremely happy right now. I've begun the process of coming out and I'm going to be taking baby steps. Thank you so much to all of you.

Quick question, I have a friend who is an MtF TG woman who is interested in trying trees, however, her Doctor had told her that it would be bad and her consideration is blood clots and such.

I have a vaporizer which is the primary method by which i'd like to try to get her high, but, I want to know just how bad it is for her to smoke? A quick google says smoking trees increases testosterone? I'm highly skeptical of that, but I obviously care for her safety but I also know that weed is largely harmless -- but I don't want to encounter any contraindications with her medications

Anyone on Spironolactone, Progesterone, etc? Any help or information would be wonderful.

One of my best friends who graduated a couple of years ago still lives off-campus.

I'm living basically as a nomad after having moved out from my summer place (because the guy who lives there during the academic year is back). I was going to head to NYC to stay with my best friend, but Hurricane Irene is keeping me away for the time being. Last night, after having a late dinner with my friend and his roommate, I ended up going back to their place to hangout. We were watching TV when I fell asleep on the couch (as I have before). My friend and his roommate ended up going to bed, too. This morning I woke up when my friend was heading out to run some errands. His roommate wanted to practice guitar in the living room, so I decided I'd watch stuff on my laptop in my friend's room while I waited for my friend to come back from his errands.

Outside my friend's bedroom door I found a note pinned under a can of Febreeze: **""Alex, RuPaul slept on the family couch last night. Febreeze the shit out of it, I don't want to get AIDS LOL""**

I've never encountered this kind of homophobia. I'm relatively masculine, a fact that I've come to grips with over this past summer- I didn't think I could pass, but apparently I can. I've never actually brought up being gay around my friend's roommates (the roommate's girlfriend also lives there). I have no idea who wrote the note- the roommate or his girlfriend. I always tried to be nice to them, usually by engaging them on things they like (Rastafarianism, art). After finding the note, I put it back where it was and left for someone else's apartment. I'm afraid my friend won't say anything to his roommates. I guess I just want to talk to someone about it.

**TL;DR**- Crashed at my friend's place last night, found a ridiculously homophobic note about me from one of his roommates this morning.

Granted, my school is pretty accepting and has a great LGBT club that is very active and from what I can tell, respected on campus. Anyway, the rugby team would get negative remarks every now and then about how ""they're all lesbians"" blah blah blah. It wasn't nice, those of us who weren't didn't like being called something we weren't but most of all we hated that our teammates were being disrespected.

So we came up with a fun word we could use to refer to our LGBT teammates (and anyone else we wanted to) that had no negative connotations. The word is ""Shmishma"" (or ""Shmishmo"" for the guys out there). We even made team shirts that said ""you know you're a Lady Rebel when..."" and on the back we had a number of shmishma related phrases. It was kind of our way of sharing the word with our campus.

What I'm trying to share is this fun word that should never be used negatively but said and shared proudly!

A variation of the word:
Shmishmashing (the act of engaging in anything shmish related)

The best part is, you can't say it without laughing because it's so fun to say. 

Those of us on the WORFC (Women's Oneonta Rugby Football Club) hope that this word brings you as much joy and acceptance as it has brought us.

4 of my friends in New Hampshire live in the same house. All of them toke occasional, not that common though. They do have a few pipes/bongs in the house. Also, they are all gay.

One day the jobless guy of the house answers the door in just his underwear. He is greeted by 8 officers and a police dog. They are looking for a girl that has run away from her home, and they suspected she was hiding there. Instead of asking for a warrant, my friend panicked, let the cops in. They did find the pipes/bongs/weed, but they just put them back where they found them and continued the search. No girl was found. They are so gay, I doubt they have had a girl in their house in the last year.

They ended up flushing all their weed ""just in case"".

Oh, sorry, this story was about dicks, back on topic! So, being New Hampshire folks, they own quite a few firearms. Also, being gay, they own quite a dildos and other sex toys. After the raid, I asked ""Did they say anything about all the guns, or all the dildos?"" ""Nope."" ""So.... are there more guns, or dildos in the house?"" ""Uhhhh, no idea"".

His hands

Or the taste of your sex

Pushed past known boundaries

Exploring what scares me

Excited by your lips on me

And the feel of her breasts on my thigh

I laid back and closed my eyes

As he pushed me to my limit

Undone and untamed

This feeling cannot be named

And I'm forever changed

Labeled and put on display

So I jumped through their hoops

And tried to wear their lives

Forced to learn the hard way

To unashamedly say

I'm proud to be gay

I'm proud of myself

To live in your world; on rules I have learned

From the mistakes you don't know you're making

I'm proud I'm a lesbian

I'm proud of my sisters

For teaching me strength

I had always known i was gay, or at least had no sexual interest in females, but I grew up christian, so I  never thought to much of it. I would just tell myself that Jesus would ""fix"" it one day. Then, almost four years ago, out of nowhere, I had my first crush. It was powerful and debilitating, and solidified the fact that I was gay. I didn't know what to do--I had a crisis, praying and floundering helplessly. I knew if i told my family, it might destroy us. I had no one to talk to about it, and it didnt help that the guy I liked was...is straight (found out when I spilled the beans about my feelings to him...rough night, story for another time). I was going insane. But then a friend of mine, who I had known had gotten into weed (he offered it to me once a year before, I freaked out being the good christian boy I was and stopped talking to him for a year) reappeared and offered to smoke me out for the first time. Not knowing what else to do, I accepted his offer.

I won't recap the whole night, because you all probably know how magical getting high for the first time is. But it was the first time in a long while that I had mental peace. I didn't give a fuck about being gay, or what my family would think, or the awful loneliness and heartbreak I had been feeling for a long time. Everything was wonderful again. Colors brought joy, music brought peace, video games brought rainbows of jizz in my pants. I was finally happy again.

Im really talking about my high behaviors. How do i act differently, what about me comes out more or less now because of transition. 

Some things i have noticed (Im mtf):

* I dont have to load the bowl very often, others seem to do it.

* i generally get a little more playful with others.

* I dont say ""dude"" or ""man"" quite as much, but still a lot :)

*  I like blankets and pillows more

* When high there is always a threat of tears.

* I fucking love getting high now! It was chill before, but now its just awesome!

So what kinds of things have you noticed about yourself or others when you are high during transition? And if you are not trans, how has smoking changed since coming out?

So I volunteer at a GLBTQ centre in a university and I do peer support for people coming to terms with their sexuality and identity a lot. When someone is having issues with coming out, I like to tell them this:

When I was in high school I had the pleasure of listening to  a man talk about being the first arranged same sex marriage in Canada.When a student asked him what coming out in India was like, he said that he never understood the concept of coming out. Instead of stepping out into the world of everyone else, instead he invited people into his circle. If you proved yourself to be a decent human being and trustworthy, then he would invite you in and let you know more things about him, one of those facets being that he was gay.

Strangers didn't inherently deserve to be in his circle, and telling people that he was gay was a privilege that he gave to those that deserved it, rather than something that he had to do to be real. He wasn't in a constant state of lying. He was not obligated to come out, people had to request to be let in.

For some of you, this might make sense. For others, you might have come to terms with your sexuality so long ago it doesn't matter. However, especially for people where their identity is something still being discovered or rediscovered, it may be the shift in perspective that they need to take the pressure off having to constantly declare or label yourself. 

**TLDR** Instead of coming out of the closet, think about letting people into your circle. It takes the emphasis off of you to come out, and instead puts the responsibility on other people to prove themselves worthy of being invited in.",,False,,t5_2s43r,True,,,True,t3_pqqze,http://www.reddit.com/r/LGBTrees/comments/pqqze/a_different_perspective_that_i_found_helpful/,

(x-post from r/trees),26,4,6,http://www.reddit.com/r/LGBTrees/comments/x94he/what_smoking_trees_has_done_for_me_xpost_from/,"As a child I was always smarter than the average person and more aware of the world than others my age and some even older. I also had a lot of energy and a penchant for mischief. Being a middle child to a working class family, I spread terror and havoc in my neighborhood for attention and often got into fights with other boys who made fun of me. When I was 10 my parents were at their wits end with my destructive behavior and emotional outbursts so they took me to a child psychiatrist. The man told my parents that I had a chemical imbalance and that I would need medication to be ""normal."" He took their money (and confidence) and proceeded to pump me full of antidepressants (Zoloft and Seroquel specifically) that were still in trial phase for children under 18. When the antidepressants made me more subdued and unable to interact with people normally I started to do poorly in school. I had very little drive or ambition to do anything. So my parents went back to the doc and he prescribed Dexadrine Spansule, which is basically buffered amphetamines. This was the beginning of the end.

It took a while for my dad and I to get the timing right for all the pills I was taking. The antidepressants had sedative qualities and the amphetamines (obviously) were uppers. I had lots of sleepless nights and bouts of extreme sleepiness in school. I ended up getting hooked on the amphetamines in high school, about age 15. I would go through my 30 day supply in a week and then bought more pills from friends and schoolmates. I lost lots of weight and had more energy and people thought I looked great. But it caught up with me. I stopped sleeping normal. I would be awake for a few days at a time, forgetting huge portions of my day because of my hyperdrive state and fatigue. I stopped taking everything when I woke up with heart palpitations and serious pain in my chest at the age of 17. My doctor and parents told me that if I did not take the pills, they would put me in an asylums so I wouldn't hurt myself. So I took the antidepressants but tossed the uppers. When I turned 18, I told my doctor to shove his pills up his ass because I wasn't going to take them anymore. He told me that he was concerned with my safety and that I would have a psychotic episode if I wasnt on medication. I never did but I never felt right after. I still don't know what damage those pills did to my developing mind and body and I hope any that there may be is not irreparable.

I didnt smoke trees until I met my ex-boyfriend Mark at the age of 22 and he convinced me to try it. I had never felt more relaxed or even tempered in years. So I started self-medicating. I've felt happier, more at ease, enlightened and truly in control of my emotions. It was then also that I had a moment of realization: If I had weed in high school, I might have not gone off the deep end like I had. I might have not fought back against everyone who wanted to help me with the problems I was dealing with. (I came out as gay at 16 in a super conservative town and was getting picked on a lot) In conclusion, in the last 4 years of smoking weed, I've been able to find my center and above all else have found peace of mind. I wish it hadnt taken so long to find it.

tl;dr After years of prescription drugs, trees makes me feel better than any of those pills ever could.

Smoked some pot before Christmas, and all round my mouth
Grey puffs were swirling and filled up the house
The blunts were all rolled by the ash tray with care
In hopes that my dealer soon would be there	

The E-heads were rolling, glowsticks blue greens and reds,
While loud bass and club music danced in their heads
Then Pookie and d’em and the girl with the clap 
Had to bring all their drama and all the “ooh snaps!” 

When out on the porch, “ oh shit, what’s the matter?”
The locks were being picked, and caused such a clatter
“Not those crackheads again” as  I reach for my stash
“aint getting this shit tonight cuz I’m going to kick your ass!”

They scampered away, to who cares or who knows
Unbeknownst to the white girls who’re cleaning their nose.
When, what to my squinty eyes should appear, 
But another blunt circling around with my peers.

With a light and a smile, I grab that shit quick
Can’t wait to get smashed with another big hit!
Rolled with diligence and speed I saw the blunt came
We each hit it hard, and we all hit the same



Now puff, and now puff, and don’t politic, PASS! 
On smoker, and potheads, hurry up your slow ass
I want to get wasted, I want to bounce off the wall
So smoke on my friends, It’s Christmas afterall.

Anyway, *Undertow* (*Contracorriente*) is a sort of unusual but really well-told, super romantic (at times) and hear-wrenching (at other times), Sundance Award-winning gay supernatural drama set on the Peruvian seaside.

It's got a lot going for it but stays very coherent and focused evenly on all its elements. Like even though it's a ghost story, it's not *about* the fact that it has a ghost in it so much as it's about (imperfect) reconciliation and redemption, partly through paranormal mechanisms. It's partly a more bittersweet yet less depressing Brokeback Mountain, but with a Latin American perspective that deals with machismo and related issues.

I also find it really refreshing compared with most of the rest of the movies on Netflix's Gay and Lesbian section. Without going into too much rambling detail, I'll just say it's a beautiful story on its own merits, even if you're not gay/bi.

At least where I come from (urban Canada), being gay is quickly becoming completely normalized.  Queers are everywhere and let's be fucking proud about that.

But it's shit like this.  Casual gay bullying is going on rampantly in our secondary school system.  I don't think most of it is necessarily homophobic, but moreso a mimickry of a world we grew in, or else kids are just using the *fags* as a target dummy for casual bullying.

I'm 21, and I think WE need to teach our little brothers that those days are over.  (The same kind of this applies to other queers, but this is my own perspective.)  Alongside gay marriage, I think this campaign could be the key to total gay empowerment.

I am here today because I feel - uneasy. Frightened. Discouraged. And I don't know how to deal with it :(

I've known about and accepted my bisexuality my whole life, but I've never had a relationship with a woman. I've never even seriously fooled around with one. I keep waiting for something to ""just happen"" but it never does. I'm about to go to an all-girls college and I'm wondering...

Should I start putting myself out there and pursuing gals?

I'm terrified. For many reasons.

I recently cut my hair very short, even though I'm very feminine. I'm attracted to both ""butch"" and.... ""normal"" gals, but will either party still be attracted to me? I feel very unwanted and out of place.

I've never pursued anyone before - teased, led him on, encouraged him perhaps - but that is not at all the same as asking a woman out on a date. Or planning a date for that matter. At an all-girls school, how do I make her understand I want this to be a *romantic date*? I'm frightened that she'll agree, thinking I just want to chill, and be horrified when she finds I had different ideas.

I enjoy a very pro-homosexual rights environment in my hometown. It's not the same elsewhere. I'm moving to middle Georgia, and I'm terrified of being raped. Girls from my school are ""*traditionally*"" targeted by the dumb-ass redneck boys in the area and I feel like going around in public with my girlfriend would be an extreme risk. I'm getting ahead of myself a bit here, but the fear of this is so strong that it leads me to consider never having an open, public relationship with a woman down there.

And, finally, a bit of self-absorbed whining. Please don't read this bit if you get touchy about such things.

I used to be **loved** on gonewild. Front page, even top of the front page. Now, I get at least half as many down votes as up votes- on a sub at hides the down vote button for Merlin's sake! It makes me feel so goddamn shitty about myself. I know I shouldn't. I love my short hair. It makes me feel confident and sexy and has vastly improved my day-to-day life, I just couldn't keep up with long hair. But these down votes are really getting to me, man. :( I loved showing off my body for the folks over at r/GW, and it truly breaks my heart to be forgotten and down voted into oblivion just because I cut my hair. I feel exactly like I do at the end of a relationship. I need closure, and I'm not going to get it from gonewild, that's for sure.

And, even if I got closure - I still want somewhere to share myself. I tried r/xsmall and they said I was too fat. r/treesgonewild wants me to actually include smoking, and I don't have my own weed. r/selfshots is too creepy for me, as is LegalTeens. I definitely want somewhere where every post, or at least most, are by the person(s) in the picture.

But mostly, I just want to feel accepted and loved.

Sorry for the babble, it's early in the morning. I'll probably delete this later, when it has amassed a few down votes and negative comments I'm too embarrassed to keep seeing it on my profile.

Started going through depression and being bullied at school for suspicion the being gay, yeah the normal bit. Hi, my name's [Ian](http://i.imgur.com/woK7c.jpg). I do this weird thing called ""Colorguard"" maybe some of you have heard of it. I now march for a Drum Corps called the [Crossmen](http://i.imgur.com/BFbEZ.jpg)! This isn't important because I didn't start doing this until after high school.

During my freshman year I found out who my real [friends](http://i.imgur.com/7mLvU.jpg) were. That's Nicole..She is probably one of the most grown-up people I know and always is ready to hang out for hours sitting around just because there is nothing else to do. She ended up graduating early and moving to South Carolina :(

In comes [Logan](http://i.imgur.com/Y2fHE.jpg), One of my friends who I became EXTREMELY close with over sophomore year. This girl, I have no other words to describe her except perfect. She's always ready to listen to your problems and build you back up to help you continue through out school. Well she helped me get over this whole depression thing, accept myself and more importantly love myself. This process happened over sophomore and junior year. But then something amazing happened...the summer of my senior year she smoked me out. 

All summer we smoked, all day everyday. I began learning the ropes and started toking up on my own. Both of my parents are FANTASTIC, I mean my mom can be a psycho bitch sometimes but it's because she loves me. My dad is basically Gandalf in human form (he even dressed as a wizard for when he taught chemistry at a Maryland University), and my m[om](http://i.imgur.com/xMdAQ.jpg) married him so she must be at least an ent. 

IN COMES SENIOR YEAR! I have taken a major wardrobe change, hair cut AND a new attitude on [life](http://i.imgur.com/uZ1gK.jpg). I went to [disney world with my band](http://i.imgur.com/rX38t.jpg)!!! And for my graduation party I got really blazed with my [friends](http://i.imgur.com/kCIwL.jpg)!

Cut to life in drum corps...I didn't know what to expect going in except it was going to be really hard. I ended up meeting some amazing people who I would soon call my Family. Then first semester at college happened, I was floored. I just kind of did the normal school thing never really going out much. For second semester I ended up joining a Fraternity(It's not as bad as some people make it seem) and having the TIME of my life. I wasn't sure where to live for my sophomore year (this year) and they invited me to live IN the fraternity house...HOW COOL IS THAT? 

I went to do my drum corps thing again this summer...but something special happened. I thought I knew what family was, but the time I spent with these people was different. It didn't feel like family but that we all had the same [brain](http://i.imgur.com/uA2P3.jpg). And this one is cool...and of [me](http://i.imgur.com/zPHuV.jpg) (I'm the boy all the way on the right)! The last walk-on to the field at [Lucas Oil in Indianapolis.](http://i.imgur.com/rn5iZ.jpg)

After leaving drum corps it was off to live in a FRAT HOUSE...with 8 straight guys..oh boy. It's been odd, but I've also made bonds with people I never thought possible. Also living in a house with 8 other people who do random things gets interesting. 

So basically...Trees turned me into an outgoing individual with so many friends. This is [me](http://i.imgur.com/ILMtL.jpg) now! So toke up everyday friends and let's all be sexy [butterflys](http://i.imgur.com/1blDZ.jpg) together!

A friend of mine told me he was interested at the beginning of last summer. I said that we should wait till school starts up again to see if anything happens because I was still getting over somebody and I honestly didn't know how I felt about him.

So skip to the beginning of this year. We go on a ""date"", which is really us just hanging out. I said that I still didn't want to start anything but I was interested to see where it could lead. I did have a very nice time with him, but what I realized after the fact that I was definitely not romantically attracted to him at all, which is something I had been struggling with all summer. So naturally I decide that I have to tell him and nip this in the bud before it gets out of hand.

The problem here is that I feel like I lead him on. I was so indecisive and so torn on how I felt about him that I realized after the fact that I may have said a lot of things that got his hopes up. Not in the ""hinting at sex"" sort of way, but more of a ""yeah I might be interested"" sort of way. Now I have had my emotions played with like this before, and I know how much it sucks. I would never wish that on anybody. But again this is the third guy who has ever shown interest in me, and I really didn't know what I was doing.

I ended up telling him my feelings today, explaining everything above in what was confirmed by some friends to be the ""gentlest way possible"", and ""very well spoken"". I truly think that I could not have handled it any better given the situation.

He took it poorly, to say the least. He was really upset, and said that he did feel like I led him on. I emphasized multiple times that I had no intention of doing so and I would never intentionally hurt him, which is true, and I think he knows that, but it still hurt him a lot. We ended on a decent note I guess, and I know that he'll need time to recover.

I feel really terrible and shitty about the whole thing. But people say that I didn't do anything wrong on purpose. I know what I did was wrong, but a) I never intentionally tried to harm him and b) it wasn't a problem until after I realized I wasn't actually attracted to him. So I guess what I'm asking for is a little advice. Do you guys think that I handled this alright? Is there anything I can do to stop feeling so bad about this?Anything I can say to him? Or should I just let him be for a while? I honestly think that this is the worst thing  I have ever done to somebody, even though it was unintentional. I try to be the nicest and kindest person I can be. Thank you guys, it means a lot to me.

UPDATE: I think he is just in the shit right now, he is expressing deep emotional hurt on Facebook, probably so that I could see it and feel bad. Well, it worked...

He's running in the Libertarian party, so he is a third party candidate, which unfortunately puts him at a disadvantage. However, even having him in the debates would be great, as he would push issues that the other candidates avoid.

As a libertarian he is all about personal freedoms. This includes legalizing marijuana and LGBT equal rights. This is every cannabis smokers dream, **a president who openly endorses marijuana legalization** on his official website. In his IAmA he talks about rescheduling marijuana by executive order, [here's a link to that post](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/l8utx/iama_entrepreneur_ironman_scaler_of_mt_everest/c2qppkm). Aside from this great stance, he also has a lot of other views that I personally agree with. For instance, he supports net neutrality which is something most of Reddit can get behind. Here's some links to get more information about him.

I'm taking you up on your drawing offer. Can you have Shepard (the dude version) and Kaiden from Mass Effect just snuggle a little bit? That would be adorable. Also, they don't *have* to be wearing shirts. Or they can be. Whatever works. Also, am I allowed to whore the resulting picture out for karma on /r/gaymers? It's alright if you say no.
 
- **Hacker Evolution** (winner: **Ichikurosakai**)

Given to you for being the only one to request it. =)

- **Greed Corp** (winner: **30helensagree**)

Chosen for having the 13th most upvoted post of all time on this subreddit. And for being all-around awesome, according to my stalking. And for offering me a game in return. =)

- **World of Goo** (winner: *anonymous*)

This one's going to someone who PMed me. If they're comfortable with me sharing their name here, I'll post it, just know that they're getting it because their description of World of Goo included: ""This game is like instant physics boner fuel.""

- **Toki Tori** (winner: **CheeterMcSkeeter**)

I'm more of a *beards* man than a *breasts* man (this whole Kinsey 6 thing is so *limiting*), but if you're dead set on sending that picture, feel free.

- **Xotic** (winner: *on hold*)

I'll pick a winner for this from the remaining requests as soon as the bundle actually goes up. It failed to launch *again* today.

1321990982.0,14,self.LGBTrees,mlsvx,I need some advice for a tricky situation,16,2,13,http://www.reddit.com/r/LGBTrees/comments/mlsvx/i_need_some_advice_for_a_tricky_situation/,"Sorry for the length, I'll try to keep this as concise as possible. So about a month ago I moved out of a house I was living in with a friend. We've been friends for about 5 years (since I moved here) and he's done some fucked up things to me before, apologized, and we moved on. While we were living together though, he didn't pay rent for 4-5 months, even though he spent a week on vacation and brought several hundred dollars in spending money (enough to pay almost 3 months' rent.) 

He ignored all calls and emails from the landlord and never called him back; he also never told me about any of this. Several times throughout the year, I got surprise calls from my furious landlord who was pissed that my roommate hadn't paid and refused to contact him. Being a good friend, I tried to cover for him while also confronting him with the usual, ""yo, what the fuck?"" business. As usual, he apologized, finally got in touch with the landlord (who was super-flexible with us despite being able to fuck us over if he really wanted to) and arranged paying his backrent. This included him moving back in with his parents so he could save money and pay it all sooner.

Fast forwarding a month, after we've moved out of this place, I email my landlord asking why he hadn't sent my deposit yet (the city I live in requires it to be returned within 30 days.) He emails me back saying that he still has not been paid. At this point, I had already decided to not be friends with this kid anymore (due to something somewhat related) and hadn't talked to him in over a month. Since then, he has been all of my calls, texts, and messages and STILL has not sent the check (the landlord said that this kid claimed he mailed a check about a week and a half ago which never arrived.)

I know he has the money because he has been trying to move in with some friends of mine who asked me about him. Of course I told them about our situation because I don't want them to end up getting screwed over, too. This morning, my landlord emailed me again saying that this kid sent him an email saying that he accidentally sent the check to the wrong address and that *I* have it. Since we haven't talked in over a month and he doesn't even know where I live now, this is clearly not possible. It seems he is trying to fuck me over and stick me with his bill since we were on a joint lease (in addition to me not getting my deposit back, which I desperately need as I am about to be unemployed.)

I'm not sure what to do at this point. He has screwed me over before, but not in a way that ends up costing me several hundreds of dollars (including money that is HIS debt). He works a few blocks from my house, so I could go confront him in person, but I know that he's the type of person who will look you straight in the eye and lie to your face. I also know that he has most likely already talked tons of shit to our mutual friends to make them think he's the innocent one here and I'm the ass who is overreacting and yelling at him for no reason (I have seen him do it to people countless times before). While I do not like the idea of taking him to court, I do not have the money to cover these costs and he has already made it clear that he is too cowardly to confront me about whatever problem he has with me. However, since we are on a joint lease and I am technically legally responsible for his share of the rent too, it seems like suing him may be the only way to get him to pay up.

Any advice, fellow ents? I am too furious right now to think clearly and don't want to make any rash moves that I might regret later.

**tl;dr** Former best friend is totally fucking me over, trying to push his unpaid rent debt onto me and completely ignoring my attempts to contact him. What do?

Just recently I've started talking to this guy from there.  We have seen each other many times but one day he started talking to me while we were in the steam room together.  I find him really attractive so I started asking him all about his different tattoos and tried to make general conversation.  The very next day we found each other in the steam room again.  We talked about his trip to Laos and he said it was amazing because you go to a party and there's just 'half naked people everywhere'.  Later when I was changing, he walked up to me, naked, and started asking me about my work.

The following week we saw each other again.  He told me he 'sucked a dick' all weekend at work (meaning it was very busy), but I thought it was an interesting euphemism for two guys to share in a locker room, naked.

Long story short, ever since that one day when we initialized contact we find each other in the steam room every time we're there at the same time.  He's really comfortable with me staring at his naked body and he doesn't seem shy around mine.  I know he's seen me deliberately stare at his cock in mid conversation.

Is this viable evidence to discern his interest in me?  I'm really shy and I've never asked a stranger out before in this sense.   What should I do?!  I asked him if he was an ent last time and he is..  Perhaps a smoke session?  What do I say?

Edit:  Thanks everyone!  I'm gonna grow some courage and hopefully I'll see him tomorrow at the gym!  ;)

Edit (March 06):  Hurray!  Thanks so much for the encouragement everyone!  The other day I saw M at the gym and while it took a lot out of me to do so I gathered the courage to ask him for his number.

Yet another game giveaway from bundle-junkie me!

The Indie Gala, apparently *desperate* for sales, keeps having ""happy hours"" where you can get double gifts. I've ignored them -- until today when they had an offer for *quadruple* gifts if you were one of the people to buy the bundle in the first week (it's nice for them to finally see that they should throw bones to their early adopters). Anyway, I snatched that up and now have **FOUR copies** of the *complete* Indie Gala to giveaway. Let's all just dwell on how great of a deal that is for us and ignore how much it's undervaluing indie games and music.

----

**-- What's up for grabs?**

*Each* bundle has *all* of the following:

Steam keys (no direct downloads -- Steam is *required* to get these games) for:

* Bunch of Heroes

* Critical Mass

* Fortix 2

* Greed Corp

* Hacker Evolution

* Hacker Evolution: Untold

* Hacker Evolution: Duality

* inMomentum



* Roboblitz

* Your Doodles Are Bugged!

* Zombie Shooter

* Zombie Shooter 2

Android download (.apk file) for:

* Fruit Blitz

320 kbps MP3 downloads for the following albums:

* Casey Lalonde - Thank You

* Casey Lalonde - Skitter EP

* Giraffage - Comfort

* Jack Butler - Fit the Paradigm

* Robot Science - Square

* Robot Science - Doodads

* Robot Science - Good Luck

* The Numbers - Beautiful EP

* Ulrich Schnauss - The Gala Selection

----

**-- And you're just giving *all* that away for free?**

Yup. I have this theory that if everybody were a little bit more charitable to random strangers, we'd all be just a little bit happier in this woeful world. Also, queer ents are pretty much my favorite people, which explains the choice of subreddit.

----

**-- How do I win?**

Post a quote/book/image/song/*something* that has been formative to you and your queer identity, and tell us *why* it matters so much to you.

For example, if I were entering, I would likely write about Audre Lorde's quote ""your silence will not protect you."" One of my mentors said it to me as I was going through the whole process of coming out to those close to me, and, up until that point, I had thought that I was staying ""safe"" by not telling people. Instead, staying silent meant that all the damage I was experiencing had been internalized, and I had no voice to counteract it, to address it, or even to cry for help from it.

Anyway, I'll pick the winners based on a *completely* subjective analysis of what you write, so put some effort into it and make it compelling. I want to hear your stories!

My best friend, and her two gay friends ,A and B, whom are in a relationship (a rather pathetic excuse for a relationship much like my old one) I've known one of the guys, A, since i was like 7 (13 years) and i just met his boyfriend, B. these three people are my rocks right now, i feel so good when i'm hanging out with them, smoking trees with them... it just feels good.

Here's where the problem comes in. I'm starting to like B... He's energetic, so handsome, and probably the most awesome guy i've met in a while, I like him, but...he's in this relationship, and it sucks. 

I'm not acting on it, i'm not a scumbag.

But he's the real crazy thing A doesn't realize how great of a guy he has, we were all high the other day and B and my best friend went in the other room and and A showed me a picture of another guy and said ""do you think this guy is cute?""
me: ""no""
A: ""i do""
*shuffling noise outside the room*
A: ""oh shit"" *backs off page*

like... idk... B is amazing and doesnt deserve to be treated like that.

just a rant. reply if you want, don't if you don't.


and make sure your signifigant other knows how much you love them, and dont be a scumbag. and lets all toke up :)

He asked me if I wanted more, but I told him that I'm not ready to have anything more than hangout/smoke/fuck sessions. Basically I'm not looking for anything serious, but at the same time I enjoyed our time together and I don't think he appreciated being treated like a whore.

He has a gf and I have a bf. I'm a little attracted to him, but I suppress that. I have no other smoking buddies and I usually smoke alone or when I'm with my bf, but he doesn't smoke. I look forward to smoking with him and get excited when we chat/text, which is uncommon. It might be that I'm interested in him or because we have a lot in common. It's a little awkward when we kick it, but maybe because I'm self-conscious about coming off like I'm hitting on him.

Today, I saw him in the hospital (we're med students) but I was talking to someone. We looked at each other but I was in the middle of a conversation so he just kept walking. He looked cute today! I got a little sad that we didn't get to say hi, but I texted him just now to ask if he wanted to smoke tomorrow and he said yeah.

I'm at a [4] so I hope this makes sense. Anybody else been in a similar situation?",,False,,t5_2s43r,False,,,True,t3_108nhh,http://www.reddit.com/r/LGBTrees/comments/108nhh/smoking_with_a_straight_friend/,

I have been with my fiance for just about 2.5 years and we have seen a lot of people and friends come and go.  I personally have ZERO gay friends and he has a bunch of slutty ones that like to go out until 3am on a Wednesday.  Sorry, we have jobs.

Anyway, I was wondering if there were any couples out there that would like some smoking buddies.  Let me be clear here: I AM VERY HAPPY IN MY RELATIONSHIP AND THIS IS NOT A SEXUAL ADVERTISEMENT. Seriously. Like super seriously.  We're just looking for another couple to chill with, watch stupid tv shows, maybe play some wii, and of course blaze.

I feel kind of ridiculous posting this, but it would be nice to know that we're not the only boyfrients with no ent friends :)",,False,,t5_2s43r,False,,,True,t3_vgn7n,http://www.reddit.com/r/LGBTrees/comments/vgn7n/any_ent_couples_in_la/,
