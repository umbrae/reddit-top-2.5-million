Thought I'd share my personal rankings. In general, I only download those talks that seem interesting to me (currently I've got 200 of them downloaded, only watched around 80 so far, and going in reverse chronological release date).

I have them in a 5 star ranking system in iTunes (with half stars), so in general, a 5 is an absolute must see, a life changer, something fascinating to ponder or something utterly original, a 4 1/2 is pretty close to that, a 4 is something overwhelmingly interesting or readily worthwhile to share, a 3 1/2 is something worth thinking about, though not necessarily in the exact form (i.e. maybe a topic worth looking into independently), a 3 is something that's a bit interesting but without much replay value, a 2.5 is something that's perhaps a bit disappointing, or just plain uninteresting, and anything below that is just garbage.

Without further adieu (I'll update this hopefully as I watch more):

## 5

* Hans Rosling - All 5 of them (note: there's overlap here between them)
* Derek Silvers - Weird, or just different?
* Lalitesh Katragadda - Making Maps to Fight Disaster, Build Economies

Don't take this too rigidly, a lot of it obviously depended on the mood I was in, and I think I also got a bit more strict with my rankings as time went on, but this is a nice rough sketch of how I feel they lay out. Feel free to challenge or add!

I find fewer and fewer to be worthwhile. Maybe the quality has declined or it could be that my standards have increased. Probably the latter.    

Many talks are full of buzzwords but devoid of a message. Many talks are about the insecurity of the speaker and subsequently turn into ""look how awesome I am. Apploud! ""      
Some talks are done by awful public speakers and I won't watch.    
Some talks are about raising awareness about a problem and urging for action, without supplying a solution and even without search for the root cause.    

I wonder whether TED talks have real world effects or are just a big  circlejerk. 

I still watch them all, since there **is** quality content, occasionally. 

If you wonder how one watches them all:   
Get the rss feed (hopefully it still contains them all)  and RSSowl to auto download them all + every new one.

Would you please recommend me some TED Talks? I know I can see Talks related to Global Issues, but maybe you can recommend me an specific Talk.

Here are some examples, for reference:

* The limits of privacy on social networks

* Work in construction of human dignity

* The challenge of living with differences (among people)

* The power of transformation by reading

* Child work

* Violence

* The right to vote as a way to promote social transformations

* Development and environmental preservation

The topics are usually very broad so you we talk about its negative and positive sides.

Quotes are also a valuable tool that could give some extra points.

The speaker used a tuning fork to figure out the pitch of these individual sounds, and combining them, he used a keyboard to recreate the combination of all the ambient sounds in his office, and showed that the pitch produced by these combined sounds was unsettling.  

I've watched a couple of Julian Treasure's videos and think it might be one of his, but I haven't been able to find this.  There is a possibility it wasn't a Ted talk, but something similar.  Any help in finding this would be most appreciated.

I'm looking for suggestions about TED Talks to watch that would help or inspire a political party sort of starting out in local politics and building an organization.

Talks about ideas that should be implemented in local government would be great. 

Talks about methods of creating organizations, getting people involved as activists, and also methods of working together on and offline also good. 

Talks about human psychology and how you can use that to make positive changes in peoples behaviour that actually work is very interesting for writing policies or laws.

Please clarify?,10,0,2,http://www.reddit.com/r/ted/comments/fn3gi/getting_mixed_messages_about_tedx_attendance/,"So within the year I plan on hosting a TEDx event in the Seattle-Metropolitan area and I am having some issues clarifying what my max attendance numbers are.

I've already been in talks with other TEDx organizers in my area and I have learned that if I have someone who has attended an actual TED event on my organizing team, I can bump up my max attendance number to above 100. 

In all honesty, I would be perfectly fine having an actual TEDx event with simply 100 people actively participating but given the nature of my venue, I have an extra balcony space that is separately connected where I would like for students to be able to come and go to watch talks occur live. 

If someone could give me some opinions/advice I can move forward with my event with the correct priorities. I can answer any question if necessary. ",,False,,t5_2qi6s,False,,,True,t3_fn3gi,http://www.reddit.com/r/ted/comments/fn3gi/getting_mixed_messages_about_tedx_attendance/,

Instead, I'm full of rage in how elitest, backwards, stuck up everyone seems to be.  

Are these the people changing the world or the people taking credit for those changing the world?  

Everyone I've talked to from TED has been an enormous disappointment.  They talk with a 'DO YOU KNOW WHO I AM?' spat that can only be from working for people that don't value your work or care about you.  It is all a game of image coupled with hidden depression, it seems. 

Perhaps I am wrong.  I hope I am.

Usually I don't find the idea being explored in the TED talk all that interesting. It just strikes me as a desperate attempt to be influential. An exclusive club of high powered people who want to remain relevant in a world that is increasing networking without the over-determined direction of the mainstream media. TED is just an unwelcome intrusion in my social networking world. A slick attempt to create memes by people who are too powerful in the real world to bother interacting with the social networking masses. But mostly their grand ideas are just bland, the same pablum you used to get from pundits.
