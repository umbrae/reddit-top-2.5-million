The whole event is ""women-oriented"" and marketed as a female empowerment gig, which to me adds insult to the injury, as if women were incapable to distinguish true science from utter superstitious, anti-scientific bullshit. 

Seeing the TED name associated with this freak show in a country where science and education have already been cornered and budget-cut by its own government is extremely sad. TED should react and examine its own standards in order to avoid being ashamed by these hordes of rain-makers and mystic scam artists in the future.

The discussion revolves around that in some TEDx there are speakers who do not deal with the proper attention to the data of the subjects they address. [A case is a lecture in TEDx Austin](http://kfolta.blogspot.com.br/2012/03/ted-you-can-do-better.html) where the person confuses correlation with causation and the [other case](http://www.quackometer.net/blog/2010/12/ted-quacks.html) is a pseudoscientist who made a speech at a TEDx Brussels.  

For those who do not know, [TEDx are not organized by TED](http://www.ted.com/tedx), they are authorized by the headquarters if their promoters follow [some rules](http://www.ted.com/pages/view/id/493#pr-press-media).  Please, if someone knows more about how they are made, explain.

The case is that the quality of the speakers is not something that is monitored. So, many people are using the brand of TED to give validity to ideas that are (being generous) debatable. Because most people do not know the difference between TED and TEDx people are deceived because they trust the brand.

So, do you think TED should have greater control over what is propagated in TEDx? This is possible in practical terms? Maybe it was better appreciate the quality of the brand and not to promote more TEDx? I honestly have no party in this matter. On the one hand I think the TEDx help propagate a format for success in the spread of ideas, but I understand that the brand needs to worry about the quality of what is said on your logo.  

Sorry for any grammatical error. English is not my first language.
