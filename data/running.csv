My immediate thought was, ""Uhh, I didn't take anything."" And then I saw him point a couple blocks ahead of me to another guy, also running away. For whatever stupid reason in my stupid head, I started chasing the other guy. Now, other guy is about my height, but pretty chubby. I let him run for awhile, scaled a 6 foot wall, and tried to figure out what to do. I could tell he was getting winded, so, as we neared a curb, I sprinted up to him and pushed him forward. Homeboy tripped on the curb and ate sh*t. I told him to give up the necklace (I heard a lady yell that earlier) and he took a gold necklace from his pocket and laid it on the ground, muttered something about me being a freak (because I'm in shape?) and started running away. Glad that I hadn't been stabbed or something, I grabbed the necklace and found the couple it belonged to (older guy had a huge rock in his hand, ready to smash the guy's face, he told me). His wife was grateful, gave me a hug, and I finished my run.

Good Grief people! Y'all made me tear up and that's not something I say lightly. Thank you all so very much for the open arms of encouragement. I thought for sure I was going to get ""haha fatty""  or ""Run Forrest RUN!""  You guys are AWESOME.  

Here is a pic of my first ""run"" in my new shoes.  I didn't do too much running today because I had to pick up my puppy and push a stroller with the other hand when I did. LOL Was rather awkward. I plan on getting up early tomorrow though or running after the kids are in bed so that I can actually ""run.""   The shoes felt FANTASTIC btw. :)

I comply of course and he then puts my hands behind my back and cuffs me.

He explained I perfectly matched the description of someone who just broke into a nearby house. He tells me I don't have to say anything if I don't want to and helps me sit on the ground while 3 more cars arrive. He was very professional and respectful, and I was confident I'd be on my way soon.

Then, a second cop waddles over, a big tub o' lard, this one, and says accusingly, ""You're awfully sweaty, what are you running from?"" I wanted to say, ""I was exercising, you've probably never heard of it.""

I tap my nonexistent pockets and shoot him another glance as if to say ""are you fucking kidding me?"".

The witness to the crime finally arrives and says I'm not the guy. The first cop apologizes for the confusion and thanks me for my cooperation and I continue my run with a nice little adrenaline boost.

I was kinda hoping they would take me downtown so I could prove my alibi with my Garmin watch. Would've made for a better story ;)

I got rid of some bad habits (and a shit job) and picked up newer, healthier ones.  I had taken a long hiatus from running while my early twenties stomped me into the ground.  So today, after busting my ass all day, I couldn't wait to go for a run and just relax.  I was looking forward to it all day.  About 2.5 miles in, I'm trying to focus on form and am kind of deep in thought,  when all of a sudden I'm on the ground, can't see, in pain and dripping blood everywhere. Someone threw a full 2 liter bottle of Coke out of a car going probably 35-40mph and it hit me right in the face.  I didn't see it coming or anything.  I tried to stand up and stumbled into the street.  I tried to get someone to follow the car to get the plates, but I couldn't talk and I probably looked like a crazy person.  I'm glad it didn't knock any of my teeth out, but it hurt. A lot.  I really can't even believe I didn't get knocked unconscious.  It was pretty discouraging.  I'm a 28 year old guy and I felt like crying...not because of physical pain, but because here I am trying to do something beneficial for myself and feeling good and some asshole has to come along and hit me in the face with a bottle.  I hate complainers, and I'd probably tell someone in my situation to be the bigger person and let it go, but it's just been bothering me all night.  And yeah, after knocking on someone's door who very kindly let me bleed into some of their towels, I finished the second half of my run.

1329932602.0,654,self.running,q15p3,You shouldn't be winded!,802,148,205,http://www.reddit.com/r/running/comments/q15p3/you_shouldnt_be_winded/,"I've seen a few posts this week from newer runners who are getting winded, so I thought I'd post something about it.

First off, a mistake they've all made is thinking that they are getting winded because of the distance they've run.  In reality, distance shouldn't be a factor.  You should be able to run until something else causes you to stop without ever getting out of breath.

The real problem is actually the intensity, or speed, of the run.  If you're getting winded, the issue is that you're going anaerobic to some degree.  That is, your muscles aren't getting the oxygen that they need at the rate they are using it.  They can operate for a while in a deficit, but pretty soon you'll be gasping for air and unable to continue.

So what to do?  Well, the answer is easy: slow down!  Yup, simply reducing your pace a bit will allow you to run until you have to stop for some other reason.  When you run, you can expect to breath a bit more heavily, but you should still be able to speak a sentence without too much trouble.

""But my body can run so much faster"", you might be saying.  Well, sure enough, you probably have the leg muscles to move yourself at a nice pace without it feeling too hard.  The problem is that a chain is as strong as its weakest link.  In this case, your muscles are at one end of the chain and your lungs are at the other.  In between are red blood cells that carry oxygen, a heart that moves them and capillaries that deliver those oxygen carrying cells to the muscles.  In a new runner, some or all of those links aren't as well developed as the muscles.  As a result, that oxygen just isn't getting there fast enough.

How do you fix this?  You just have to run more and do it at slower speeds.  With just a little bit of strain on the system, and your body will go to work ramping all of those parts up.  You'll start building more red blood cells to deliver oxygen.  Capillaries will grow to make sure it can all get where it needs to go.  Your heart will get stronger and more efficient, so it can pump more blood to more places that need it with each beat.

The good news is that this happens no matter what pace you're running!  By running slowly, you can run for a longer time and provide stimulus for longer.  The process doesn't work faster when you run faster, so all you really accomplish there is that you have to stop sooner.

These adaptions, as well as others related to metabolism and energy production, mean that you can get a lot faster just by running more miles at an easy pace.  In fact, the best thing you can do as a new runner is to run more at almost an exclusively easy pace.  With each easy run, you are increasing the ability of your body to work harder for a longer duration.  This translates into the potential to run faster for longer when you want to, like in a race.

So what about speed work?  Well, you are building up your potential by running slowly, and in the beginning, that will yield huge gains.  In fact those gains will be much more substantial and more sustainable than what you'll get from speed work.  As the returns start to diminish and you have a body with the ability to run much better than it once did, you can start doing speed work.  Intervals, tempos, fartleks, etc will allow you to come closer to the great potential you've built up.  The base you've built will help you do speed work much more effectively and with less chance of injury.  For beginners, though, it isn't all that important.

**TL;DR**: Slow down, trust me.

EDIT: A few people have brought up that there are workouts that should leave a person winded.  Absolutely true!  I hit the track and run hard when I'm 5K training.  However, I don't think those workouts are appropriate for newer runners.  A new runner being able to actually complete a three mile run will do much more for their 5K time than running 400 meters at top speed.   As with any sport, or any skill for that matter, you get the fundamentals down first, then start getting fancy.",,False,,t5_2qlit,True,,,True,t3_q15p3,http://www.reddit.com/r/running/comments/q15p3/you_shouldnt_be_winded/,

I went from being a non distance runner to running regularly, and in the process dropped 40 lbs, completed 17 marathons, an Ironman, countless other races, blah blah blah.  I've had Injuries that have knocked me down for short periods of time, but it's never been too long before I'm back on the pavement/trails.    
For the past 8 weeks I've been laid up from running by a heel Achilles insertional tendonosis that just won't improve no matter what I do.  Walking - no problem.  Running - can't do.    
I'm not here to whine, just to pass along some motivation.  Sometimes it's easy to lose sight of the gift of running.  The training can be a little tedious; there's never quite enough time to fit in all the runs, the weather doesn't always cooperate.  But running is a gift, one you don't often appreciate until it's gone.  To be able to lace up your shoes, step out the door, and put 2, 5, 12 miles behind you without stopping - that's a pretty amazing thing.  Only runners know that feeling you can get when everything just clicks, and the strides seem effortless, and you're just experiencing the joy of being a primal body in motion, doing what you were created to do.  Only runners know that good ache to the quads and calves and glutes that you feel each time you move the day after you've nailed a difficult long run.  And runners know that unique feeling of accomplishment when those difficult physical goals you've set for yourself, are met and exceeded.    
So for those of you headed out on a run today, or this week, take a moment during it to appreciate, really appreciate, how great a thing it is.  This running you're doing, it's a gift that isn't given to everyone.  And while at times it may seem more like a punishment than a reward, believe me, when it's taken away, you'll realize how much a part of you  and your sanity this simple act is.

1340291395.0,567,self.running,vdu5v,Running and alcohol (Personal Story),652,85,142,http://www.reddit.com/r/running/comments/vdu5v/running_and_alcohol_personal_story/,"A year ago, I was in terrible shape. 52lbs overweight. Eating the wrong things and drinking like a fish. I drank on every day that ended in 'Y'. Beer, liquor, wine, whatever, didn't matter. As long as I got 'that feeling'.

I had a problem with it to say the least. It wasn't a major life ruining problem that some have, but I definitely fit the label of functioning alcoholic. I just loved being drunk. It made everything better.

I hated myself for drinking so much. I hated myself for eating so much and just letting my health get out of hand. But I felt stuck. I didn't know what to do or more honestly I just didn't want to do what I knew I had to do.

That changed for me last August. I started a weight loss program at the local gym. I managed to shed the weight. Eating habits were better, but the alcohol use was just as bad. I would cut out eating food to have a drink or two. A shot of whiskey has 65 calories. I could have 8oz of whiskey instead of dinner and get the same amount of calories for that day. Smart move for the functioning alcoholic, not.

That weight loss program had cardio in it which I hated, but I did it anyway to keep with the program and the weight loss made me feel a lot better. I was working my way up to 3 miles on the treadmill when I got sick with the flu. It was the kind of flu that held on to you weeks after you started feeling normal. 

So after about 3 weeks, I came back to the gym and the treadmill and found I could not go my usual distance without getting horribly painful stitches. I could go maybe 1.5 miles and then I was down and in so much pain, that it detracted away from doing the weight training. This went on and on and on every time I tried the treadmill. So my trainer told me just to do what I could do and he lowered the speed and intensity. This didn't work. I still got the stitches. Alcohol soothed my failure, that is it soothed me, because I very much, even with the weight loss, good marriage, good job, thought of myself as a failure.

I was disappointed that I seemed to be losing those hard fought miles on the treadmill. I did my paltry 1 mile and felt horrible about it, but again, my dear, dear friend waited on top of the refrigerator. It made me forget all my failures. It made me forget myself and I worshiped it for that. 

I then got off the treadmill. I decided it was just too painful of a device for me and looked for something else. I don't know why I passed up the ellipticals, but my eyes fell on the track above me. 

1/7th of a mile indoor track. Ok, why not. I started to run it three days a week. I got the stitches but they weren't as bad. I couldn't got the full distance yet, but I just kept adding small distances every week until I managed to get 7 trips around without stopping, my first mile on the track! I promised myself if I got three miles I would enter a 5K. 

I got those 3 miles in about 2 months or so and ran my first 5K and loved it. It was fun and I had a time of 30:38 and a nifty tshirt which, to me, was like a badge of honor saying that I had trained and sacrificed for this event and I finished. Didn't win, didn't even have a great finishing time, but I did it. I achieved a goal.

It was suggested to me that I take my running outdoors by a friend of mine. Which I did and I loved it even more. Just being out in the world was inspiring to me. So I began to log three miles around the local college here and developed an actual running routine where I would run with some other people a few days and by myself on others. I entered more 5Ks and saw my times increase, 29:29, 29:15, 28:06. I started increasing my mileage and adding another run day to my week. 

You might have noticed that in the above paragraphs I haven't mentioned drinking. A funny thing happened about that. I used to crave the drink. It was a crying need in me. I used to run home after work just to open a bottle and get schloshed in 2 hours and ride it out until I passed out later that evening. I noticed in doing all this running, I didn't have that craving as much. There were days I'd go home and look at that bottle of whiskey and instead grab a big 32oz glass and fill it with ice and water. 

A bottle of whiskey would last me maybe 2-3 days, the 750ml kind. I've now had the same bottle for almost 3 months. It just doesn't have the power it once did. I am not sure how that happened. Now, if I do drink it is a very rare occasion. Maybe once a month, sometimes not at all for the whole month and never to the excess I once did. I have celebrated a new PR with a few drinks and a rowdy time, but now I would rather have water than anything else. Soda/pop even took a backseat. I have a diet soda/pop every now and then too, but again, I would rather see a big glass of ice cold water in front of me now than soda/pop. 

My long runs are 5 miles now which I will push to 6 miles come July 7th. There is a 10k in September around here that I think I will be running in too. I used to run home for the drink and now I am running home to tie on my running shoes and hit the road. I don't need the alcohol any longer. I have a 10K car magnet to earn now.

I was about 7 miles deep on a training run this morning.  At this point in my route I was on some wooded trails in my town which are very popular with runners, walkers, and bikers.  About 20 yards ahead of me a young woman was walking her baby in a stroller.  A teenage kid, probably 15 years old, was walking by her when all of a sudden he grabbed her purse and began running away.  I saw the whole thing happen so immediately started chasing after the kid.  I was pretty tired having already ran over 7 miles, but the adrenaline kicked in and after a pursuit of maybe 150 yards I caught the kid (who had a 20 yard head start may I remind you).  Once I caught him he didn't put up much of a fight, just surrendered the purse and ran off.  I returned the purse to the woman, who was needless to say very grateful when she said ""wow I never thought you'd catch him! Guess all the running paid off!""  Her comment made me realize that this was really the first time I used my running abilities for a purpose other than sports. 

Anyway, keep on running.

1371090730.0,524,self.running,1g8prw,An interesting interview with an evolutionary biologist on running and why humans hate exercise. (Copied here so you don't have to create an account.),632,108,73,http://www.reddit.com/r/running/comments/1g8prw/an_interesting_interview_with_an_evolutionary/,"Exercise confers huge health benefits, so why does it often feel like such a chore? Evolutionary biologist Daniel Lieberman explains the paradox

**Why did you start to study the evolution of running and exercise?**


I got interested in how we hold our heads still when we run. It began when my colleagues and I were doing some experiments with pigs as models. It is very uncomfortable to watch a pig run: its head bobs all over the place. But animals that are good at running, like us, are extremely good at keeping the head still, because it is important for gaze stabilisation. We started thinking about humans and chimps, and came up with hypotheses about how we evolved head stabilisation to run.


**Why do you think head stabilisation evolved for running, and not another form of movement?**


If you watch someone with a ponytail running, the ponytail bobs up and down. That's because of the pitching forces acting on the head. The head itself stays very stable. There are special mechanisms – the semicircular canals in human heads are greatly enlarged relative to apes, for instance – that give us a much greater ability to perceive and react to rapid accelerations of the head.

Walking does not create such accelerations. And I don't think our ancestors were jumping on trampolines or hitting each other on the head so much. The only explanation we can come up with is running.

**Being able to run is one thing – how did we then go on to become endurance athletes?**


We evolved from very non-active creatures. A typical chimp will walk 2 to 3 kilometres a day, run about 100 metres and climb a tree or two. Your average hunter-gatherer walks or runs 9 to 15 kilometres per day, and we have all these features in our bodies, literally from our heads down to our toes, that make us really good at long-distance walking and running.

I and my colleagues at the University of Utah, Dennis Bramble and David Carrier, think the key advantage for humans was persistence hunting, whereby you run very long distances to chase animals in the heat and run them into heat stroke. We can run for very long distances, marathons in fact, at speeds at which other animals have to gallop. That's not an endurance gait for quadrupeds, because they cool by panting – short shallow breaths. You can't pant and gallop at the same time. If you make an animal gallop in the heat for 15 minutes or so, on a hot day, you'll kill it.

**But we have adaptations for this kind of endurance running?**


Yes. Our bodies are loaded with all kinds of features: short toes that require less energy to stabilise and generate less shock when running; the Achilles tendon that stores and releases energy appropriately as we run; the large gluteus maximus muscles that steady the trunk; and stabilisation of the head. I'm a middle-aged professor, I'm not a great specimen of an athlete, but I can easily run a marathon at a speed that would cause a dog my size to gallop.

**What's your best marathon time?**


[Laughs] 3 hours and 34 minutes. There are guys who can run almost twice as fast as me.

Still, if you made an animal run that far at your speed, you would...
I'd have dinner.

**Why, in spite of our adaptations, have we gone from endurance athletes to couch potatoes?**


It was incredibly recently in history that a large number of humans have been freed from having to do physical activity. My argument, from an evolutionary perspective, would be that not having regular physical activity every day is pathological and abnormal. In a lot of medical studies, we compare people who are sick with controls. But who are those controls? They are relatively sedentary Westerners. I'd argue that we are comparing people who are sick to people who are abnormal and semi-pathological.


**If being inactive is pathological and abnormal, then how come we hate exercise so much?**


There was never any evolutionary selection pressure to make us like exercise. If you are a Neanderthal or Homo erectus or an early modern human, you didn't think, ""Gee, I'm going to go for a run so that I'm not going to get depressed"". They had to go long distances every day in order to survive. Not exercising was never an option, so there was never any selection pressure to make people like exercise. On the contrary, there was probably selection to help people avoid needless exercise when they could. Some hunter-gatherers had diets of about 2200 calories a day. When your energy intake is that low, you can't afford to go for a jog just for fun.

So evolution selected for traits that made us relax or be lazy?
Of course. Just like any time you crave sugary, fatty foods – that would have been advantageous for early humans. It's only now that they have become maladaptive.

When you walk into a train station and there is a staircase and an escalator, your brain always tells you to take the escalator. Given a choice between a piece of cake and a carrot, we always go for the cake. It's not in your best interest, but it's probably a very deeply rooted evolutionary instinct.


**What are the consequences of the modern sedentary lifestyle?**


It's hard to think of one disease that is not affected by physical activity. Take the two major killers: heart disease and cancer. The heart requires exercise to grow properly. Exercise increases the peripheral arteries and decreases your cholesterol levels, it decreases your risk of heart disease by at least half.

Breast cancers and many other reproductive tissue cancers also respond strongly to exercise. Other factors being constant, women who have engaged in regular vigorous exercise have significantly lower cancer rates than women who have not. Colon cancer has been shown to be reduced by up to 30 per cent by exercise. There are also benefits for mental health – depression, anxiety, the list is incredibly long.


**What can we do about our maladaptive traits?**


If we want to practice preventive medicine, that means we have to eat foods that we might not prefer, and exercise when we don't want to. The only way to do that is through some form of socially acceptable coercion. There is a reason why we require good food and exercise in school – otherwise the kids won't get enough of it. Right now we are dropping those requirements around the world.

If we are going to solve these health problems, we have to push ourselves to act in our own self-interest. As a society, as a culture, we have to somehow agree that it's necessary or face the consequence – which is billions of unfit, overweight people.

Has evolution given us any instincts that promote exercise?
Yes. It's important to recognise that the body isn't adapted only in one way or another. There are multiple competing adaptations. While it's true that many of our instincts are to not like exercise, we also have other adaptations that make us enjoy exercise. The most obvious example is the runner's high.

**What's the evolutionary advantage of the runner's high?**


Imagine you are chasing an animal, and you have to keep going. When you are chasing, you are usually also tracking, which is all about observation. You are looking for clues in the environment. What does a runner's high do? It makes everything more intense. It stimulates your perception and your sensory awareness.

I can give you an example: I ran the London marathon a few years ago, and as I was nearing the finish I remember running by Big Ben and thinking, ""Wow, Big Ben is really big."" And then I remember thinking to myself, ""Oh, I must be high.""

Just wanted to share a website I just launched called [DressMyRun](http://dressmyrun.com). It automatically gets your current weather conditions and, based on that, provides recommendations on what to wear for a run.

Runner's World used to have a tool that did this, then they redesigned their site and it disappeared, so I decided to create my own. In the meantime they [relaunched theirs](http://www.whattoweartool.com/), slightly upgraded. But mine was nearly complete, so I finished it up, and here it is.  

Obviously I'm biased, but I think it's much better because you don't have to first go find the current conditions -- it automatically gets the weather. Or you can enter a city directly for weather in a specific location. And of course you can still enter your own custom conditions the way Runner's World works. Plus it's mobile friendly. You can save your preferences across browsers if you sign in with your Google/Facebook/Twitter/Live account. You can choose between metric and imperial units. Plus I have plans for some additional features if there's a demand for it.

Second day in the gym, I used a cross trainer for 20 minutes at an easy pace to warm up. After this I decided I would see how I would cope with 5k being 6ft and 101kg with no previous running experience. 

Around 1k in I felt like stepping off the treadmill and calling it a day, that's when a guy gets on the machine next to me and punches 5k into it. At this point I felt like I had to finish with this guy standing next me. 

I chose 2.5k as my checkpoint, when I hit this I felt great but needed to slow things down for a little while. Did this for 0.5k then went back to my normal pace. 

After reaching 4k the guy next to me who inspired me to keep going had finished his 5k, I felt like he got me through this without even knowing it. 

5k completed I had a little cool down and took a shower. That 15 minute walk home I felt so alive and proud, it beat any achievement or trophy I've ever earned playing video games.

He consistently ran under 1:55 in Highschool and led not only his 4x800 team to second in state he also was second in state individually. In cross country he was top ten but what impressed me most about this runner was his dedication to his team. His brother was on the team and every time I ever raced against this guy he would talk to me after the race, congratulate me, and we would talk about our seasons. He was the runner every coach wanted on their team, he made everyone better. He was an all around amazing athlete. He later went on to run division one and was 15 in his conference his freshman year! He had everything going for him until last night, and the thing that every runner fears, he was hit and killed in a car accident. Someone was texting and driving. Fucking texting and driving, and they hit him. And they killed him. He had his headphones in so he didn't even hear it coming. So much promise, such an amazing person, a brother lost doing what he loved all because someone was texting and he didn't hear it coming. So today I ran 13 miles. I cried during those miles just thinking how fragile this thing that I love doing is, how lucky I am to be able to do what I love. This is the second time this year that this that I love has been rocked. We are the lucky ones guys. Truly the lucky ones. And if I have one plea for all of you, DO NOT WEAR YOUR HEADPHONES WHILE RUNNING! EVER! I know it would suck to not have music but I got used to it and seriously it is not worth your life.

I just wanted to say that one of the things I really enjoy about running is how supportive runners tend to be towards each other. 

I've been cycling for the last few years and have never noticed this in the cycling community; it always has this ultra-competitive feel, right down to judging you based on your bike or clothes.

With running it's different. Running is definitely more of a mental battle when compared to cycling. A tough ride is a tough ride, but it's not the same as a tough run, where every minute your brain is urging and tempting you to stop.

It seems to me that runners all tacitly acknowledge this. It's why they will cheer for another runner who is actually quite slow, but is running a new PB.

Calling ourselves slow is just another way we allow negative talk to infect our minds and keep us from achieving whatever we want from life. It sets up this mental barrier and instead of hurdling it, we let it stop us from breaking through it. 


What IS slow, though? 12 minute miles? 15 minute miles? 20 minute miles? This idea of slow only comes into play when one compares themselves to others. ""Mr. Fasty-Pants runs a 7 minute mile and here I am at 12 minute miles! I suck!"" Some people don't care about being fast. When I started, I was one of them. I got more of a kick out of the endurance part of it, running 2 miles, then 5 miles, then 10. When I started, I was a 15 minute miler. Over time, by just running consistently, I got faster. This happens for all of us, naturally. As our body adjusts to running, muscles get stronger, speed increases. 


And say you're sick of that 15 minute mile pace and you do want to become faster. Well, you can and if you are just starting you will improve quickly. Substitute one of your running days as a speed workout day and do some running geared toward making you faster like the Kenyan 25-1-1 Interval Run (from the book Running with the Keyans.): 


Set your watch/phone to beep every minute and then start running. The first minute is a super easy, really slow jog. When you hear the beep, take off as fast as you can and keep going until you hear the beep again. Repeat this cycle for about 30 to 45 minutes or however long your are currently running.( [Source]( http://freeradical.me/2013/05/21/three-ways-to-increase-running-stamina) )

Simple and over time you'll start noticing that 15 minute mile is now a 12 minute mile and then a 9 minute mile. You've gotten faster!


Yet, I've seen after people are successful at increasing their speed, they still fall into, ""I'm slow. 9 minute miles? Mr. Fasty-Pants runs 5 minute miles!"" How soon we forget all the work and dedication we've put into a task once we achieve a certain goal. We want to sell ourselves short and downplay the effort. Start denying yourself this empty comfort, stop putting yourself and your effort down. 


Running is about you and your effort on that day and not Mr. Fasty-Pants, not the winner of the Boston Marathon or the gold medal winner at the Olympics.  It's about wanting to get better at it and taking steps to do so and not languishing in the mire of ""I'm so slow.""


So if you want to be faster, be faster. Take the time, make the effort, stay consistent and you will be. Lose the negative self-talk, too. Think of what goals you could accomplish by changing 'I can not.' to 'I can.' The omission of that one little word will make a world of difference.

TL;DR - Stop using 'I'm slow' and kill the negative self-talk. Be dedicated, be consistent, achieve your goals!

1325631930.0,445,self.running,o1oxu,How the Physical Overcomes the Mental:  Lessons Learned from Running Everyday for a Year,514,69,81,http://www.reddit.com/r/running/comments/o1oxu/how_the_physical_overcomes_the_mental_lessons/,"**1.	Mind over body**


A body at rest likes to stay at rest, so any act of physical exertion, including getting out of bed in the morning, requires a certain degree of mental will power, will power that I knew I would need exactly one year ago when I set out to run 365 consecutive days and to qualify for the Olympic Trials marathon.  What I didn’t know then, however, was that at some point the physical overcomes the mental, and rather than the mind willing the body to get out the door, the body wills the mind.  Here’s how it happened:


**2.	No Excuses**
I am a 39-year-old mother of two, and I work full time as a high school English teacher.  My husband, while, incredibly supportive and well-intentioned, does not grocery shop, do laundry, or give baths.  His cooking, while excellent, is sporadic, and he refuses to mow the lawn. We don’t have a cleaning lady, a nanny, or a lawn service, and the weather here in Michigan can be extreme.  Excuses to not run are ripe apples on an every-blooming tree. But I am not Snow White – or Eve; for this to work, excuses could not allowed.


**3.	Planning – and Flexibility**
I ran into an acquaintance in the grocery store in May shortly after I had run a 2:52 marathon – a stepping-stone to breaking the Olympic Trials qualifying time of 2:46.  She was skeptical of how my schedule could allow for the training I had to do to run a sub 3-hour marathon. “It just requires planning,” I told her.  Just like dentist appointments, soccer practice, and book club, running gets put on the calendar.  My husband, also a runner, and I sit down every Sunday night and plan the week, including our runs, and we do everything we can do to stick to the plan.  If I have eight miles planned from 4:00 until 5:00 on Tuesday, then it becomes an appointment only to be missed in case of emergency.


Of course, things don’t always go as planned, so it’s important to also be flexible.  It’s easy for a wrench in the plan to become an excuse.  When the 4:00 run doesn’t work out because I have to go pick my sick kid up from school, and hold his head while he vomits, it’s tempting to throw in the towel, and believe me, I’ve been tempted many times.  That’s where the momentum of consecutive days running keeps me going.  Whether I’m on day 5 or day 255, it’s a shame to break the streak now, so even if I find myself in my neighbor’s basement treadmill at 10pm banging out 4 miles, when the plan had been to run a sunny 10 on trails with my friend, I take it, because I’ve got to keep the streak alive.


**4.	No Ball Scratching**
Time is precious, and while I dream of one day having the leisure to make a ten-mile run be the focus of my day, I currently do not have that luxury.  So if it takes me 75 minutes to run 10 miles, I can make the whole transaction happen in less than 85 minutes, including changing, and showering afterwards.  When I run with friends, we don’t stand around for ten minutes tying our shoelaces and pretending to stretch:  we go out and run.  I often bring my running clothes to work and change there.  Because I carpool to work, on the days I don’t drive, I’ll get out of the car 15 minutes from home, start my run there, which adds another 15 minutes to my day.  Instead of meeting friends for coffee, I’ll meet them for a run.  I’ve gotten six miles in by running to the dentist, having my teeth cleaned, and running home.  Before I had kids, I thought of time in large chunks.  If I had papers to grade, I didn’t touch them unless I had a good two-hour block.  Now, out of necessity, time has become more malleable.  If I’ve got 5 minutes, I can grade two papers; if I’ve got 30 minutes, I can run 4 miles.


**5.	Embracing hard because hard is what makes it good**
Running everyday is part of what helped me PR in the marathon, but just running isn’t enough.  The second part of the equation is running fast, and running faster than what’s comfortable is hard, but as Tom Hanks tells the women in A League of Their Own, “Of course it’s hard.  If it wasn’t hard, everyone would do it.  Hard is what makes it good.”  The best way to get through pain – of any kind – is to welcome it, embrace it, and most of all not to fear it.  Of course it doesn’t hurt to have a buddy to help get you through it.  I’m fortunate to live in a town with a large running community, so for most of my hard workouts, I’ve had a partner or a group to run with, which is a huge help; suffering is easier when you’re not alone.  I’ve also had to do a number of workouts on my own, though, and I’ve learned that I can suffer just as easily by myself.


**6.	Except when it doesn’t**
I hate quitting a workout, and I rarely do it, but sometimes hard doesn’t make it good.  Sometimes, hard just makes you injured or depleted, and it’s important to know how to read your body accurately.  This takes time and practice.  Shortly before my target marathon, I quit a 12 mile tempo at race pace half-way through.  At six miles, the struggle was too much, but quitting didn’t make me less tough; it probably allowed me to dig down and have something left at mile 24 in the marathon.  My body knew what I needed and I’m thankful that I listened.


**7.	Variety**
While I’ve thrived on the routine of running everyday, and relied on standard routes, that’s about where my reliance on routine ends.  I also thrive on variety.  I love running in new cities, and exploring new places.  I like to run alone.  I like to run with people.  I like to run with an Ipod.  I like to run without one.  I like to run trails.  I like to run roads.  In short, I change it up, keep it interesting, and that keeps me interested.


**8.	Joy**
The runner’s high is no myth.  Most of the time (but not every time) I experience joy when I run.  Whether it’s the endorphins, the fresh air, the movement, the head-clearing, or something else entirely, I am at my best – my strongest and happiest – when I run.  And for that reason, I will keep doing it as long as I can.  


**9.	Letting go of the outcome**
About two weeks before my big race, I saw my massage therapist (an important monthly ritual).  A marathoner herself, she asked me if I had let go of the outcome yet?  I had no idea what she was talking about.  “You’ve done everything you could do to reach your goal,” she told me.  “There’s nothing more you can do, so now you need to let it go.”  I did finally let it go, though it wasn’t until half-way through the race.  I was in the lead, had just run a ½ marathon personal record by 2 minutes and was on pace to run 2:41.  I knew I would finish the race, though I didn’t know if I would win (I didn’t) or qualify for the trials (I did), and that is when I was finally able to let go.  I thought of all the miles I had logged, all the workouts I had completed, how far I had tested my body, and then I realized that that was enough.  Anything else that happened that day was extra.  The next five miles were pure joy, and I suppose the next eight could have been too, had they not been the last eight miles of my fastest marathon ever, straight into a head wind.  That part was hard.  But hard is what makes it good.


**10.	Body over mind**
On December 31st, I had a 16-mile run on the schedule that I did not want to do. The eternally gray sky of December provided no inspiration, nor did my dull headache from over-indulging in red wine the night before, but by day 365, getting out the door is no longer requires will-power; getting out the door just happens, and before I knew it, I was at mile five on a familiar route.  At mile 11, I noticed that I was running kind of fast, so I glanced down at my Garmin and saw I had been running 6:30 pace for the last mile, only 15 seconds off of race pace.  I picked it up and the next mile was 6:15.  Still feeling good, I hit the next one at 6:01.  My body had taken over, and the transformation from mind over body to body over mind was complete.  
In two weeks, I will be in Houston running the Olympic Trials, and it’s freaking me out to think about standing on the starting line with Desiree Davila, Shalane Flanagan, and Kara Goucher.  Who am I to be standing there with them?  But while I’m not entirely sure that I can control the doubts and worries that will creep into my mind, I know it will not matter, because my body is trained and come January 14th, it will know what to do.

Boyfriend finished, I finished about 45 minutes later, and we looked for our friend to meet up with her--neither of us, nor our families, saw her finish. We thought we just missed her in the crowds. But after looking all over the stadium--no friend. Figured she went back to the hotel--no friend.

After covering a lot of different angles and presuming she was here or there, I decided to call the hospitals just in case. Turns out, she was taken to the ER at mile 12 after she collapsed. Apparently someone caught her when she fell, and she said she remembers 4 people staying with her, rubbing her back and literally holding her up, until the ambulance came to get her.

My friend is fine, but she keeps talking about the people that stayed with her. We are both so impressed and had a ""faith in humanity restored"" moment when these individuals, who were probably trying to achieve goals of their own, made the choice to sit with my friend with only 1 mile left and make sure she was ok. Not to mention the person who caught her likely saved the situation from being 100 times worse.

It's a long shot but I hope these heroes, or other runners in the St. Luke's Half that may know more, read this post.

But what you're actually doing is totally rude. I'm sure you don't mean it to be, but walkers and slow joggers up front ruin races for people that are trying to run as fast as they can and are lined up in the proper position. RUIN.

Think of it this way: you wouldn't switch to the left lane on the highway and drive 45 miles per hour would you? Well, that's what you're doing...except worse.

If there are corrals and timing chips and people all around you with very determined looks in their eyes, you should assume that they have been training very hard and for a long time for this moment. They've sacrificed nights out with friends and family, endured the pain and discomfort of many hill repeats and intervals, and probably haven't eaten a piece of chocolate in weeks just to test themselves in this race. If your level of ability doesn't match the people around you, simply move back until it does. I promise you will get up to the start line in a jiffy, and you'll actually have a better race.

Look, I'm glad you're there. There's room for all of us to have a great day. Just remember people have all kinds of reasons for being there--some more serious, some more fun. But you should respect everyone's right to have the race they want to have.

TL;DR: Please line up in the appropriate corral or starting position at a race. It's very rude not to.

Something about having a biker announce to his crew that there was a ""runner"" ahead of them really struck me. 

I'm a runner now, I suppose. It may sound silly, but it made a difference to me. Thanks for the inspiration, guys. ",,False,,t5_2qlit,False,,,True,t3_1is4es,http://www.reddit.com/r/running/comments/1is4es/runner_up_ahead/,

Ever since that moment I have left my iPod at home and have never looked back. I can hear how my shoes are landing, I can monitor my breathing. I am no longer trying to line my step up to the beat of the music, I find I can push myself that much harder and that much farther. Most importantly being a road runner I can actually hear the traffic coming and going. I think to being a kid and my dad was a runner, he never had music no one back then had music.

Dont worry - if you do feel like the guy is a loser or any such thing - just be honest! It would help me - and certainly other big people know how to react (or how to strengthen the mind) before running

Running makes me cry. In a good way. I'm holding my phone away from my face right now because of it. I'm cooling down right now from 2 miles in gorgeous April weather here in Birmingham, Alabama. I was a smoker for 7 years (4 days without one as of this writing, though I do vape to help with cravings.) I've had depression and self-esteem issues for about the last 3 years, stemming from a string of bad relationships. I've been cheated on, lied to, stolen from, cuckolded in public, and bad-mouthed around town by every woman I've loved. As much as I say I believe in myself, the shit I've been through could hurt any mans confidence. 

I run for myself. I feel like it's the first thing I've done truly for my own benefit in a long time. I've taken myself out of the dating game completely for at least the rest of 2013. When I run, there's no one there but me, my feet, and the sidewalk in front of me. When I run, it's for me; not for you fuckers on Reddit, not Cynthia, Jessica, or Nicki. I was cat-called twice in the past week by women while running, so that helps a ton. And that's where the tears come from, I'm finally out of the hole. I'm fucking doing it. This is my reality now. 

I've caught my breath. I'm off work today and I've got another one in me. See y'all out there! :D

EDIT: I totaled 5 miles today! 2 my first run, and then I ran 3 miles to work and back after this post. Just got back from working out, too. Legs and back today. I'm pooped, but when I got home from the gym, I wanted to do even more! Thanks for all the kind words(my first front page!)

I was a chubby teenager who could hardly find comfort in his own skin, with serious confidence issues and little to no self-respect. I assumed that my chances at earning a nice body were over- that I'd been skipped. After hearing some advice from my friends, I decided that running might help out my situation, so I started jogging every night once it got dark (so nobody could see me). It started off slow, and at distances of no more than half a mile. I'd run to my high school, then I'd have to be driven home because I was too tired to run back. I never took it upon myself to become a track or XC star, but I will admit that running brought me the confidence and peace of mind I desired- especially when I left to attend college. In a state of panic without my best friends and family, I responded by doing what I knew how to do- running. Long story short, I have gone on to run three marathons.

Eventually I met a girl and fell in love. We dated for almost a year, and it was an incredibly intense relationship with much promise of the future. She became despondent and detached from me, and she admitted that she was still not over her ex-boyfriend and that she wished to be single at this point in her life to figure out who she was and where she was headed.

My world collapsed. I screamed and cried. I didn't eat for 3 days straight. I couldn't listen to music or be left alone. I only felt numb through all of this. For the first week, I turned to alcohol, but its remedial effects were short lived and came with much consequence. I kept my wound open by keeping myself updated on her life via social media, only to find her ""embracing"" the single life happily, and with full force. I scoured the internet for breakup advice, finding no resolve, but a popular tip: exercise. So one day, I decided to do what I knew how to- even though I'd really put running on the back burner during my relationship.

I went out for a run. I turned my music up and ran through the tears- thank God they blended in well enough with my sweat so I didn't look pathetic. I will admit, it didn't help at first. It didn't even help the next day- how could I get runner's high when I felt like I had undone whatever talent I had for this sport? It didn't help in the moment that my muscles screamed in pain, while all I wanted to do was see the girl that I loved again.

But it began to get better. Slowly, I started to rediscover a spiritual connection with myself. A connection that has long been ignored. It wasn't how fast I ran or even how long I ran. It was the fact that somehow, I love myself enough to get out there and do right by me. The fact that I could be alone in the woods for an hour and not shed a tear, yet 10 minutes alone in my room would send me into a dark state of depression. The solitude and peace of mind I desired was restored. It was as though I was meeting myself for the first time in almost a year.

I feel awakened. I signed up for a half marathon to give myself a moderate goal to train for, and I've been running again every day. Before, I couldn't really do more than 30 minutes. I see progress again- reaching 40-50 minutes after a week and a half. I'm confident that I'll not only be the seasoned distance runner I once was, but with a level of heightened discipline to succeed. I even joined my town's running club, serving as a way to get involved &amp; volunteer, and spend time with people who share some of my passion.

Reread that title. I'm making it clear that I'm running through this breakup-- not away from it. I'm not only rediscovering the man I was before this relationship- I'm shaping myself into the man I've always wanted to be. And seriously, I owe a lot of it to running. No matter what happens in a day- the bullshit we suffer from a work-a-day world, emotional anguish from other people (whether it be our family, partner, or friends), the stress from high-piled school work, there is always a place to turn. A proverbial shoulder to cry on.

It's always there. It has always been there. And I'm so grateful I'm able to rekindle the relationship we had :).

Thick, heavy, wet - the kind that drenches you to the bone in minutes.

Still, it's usually just a drizzle and/or intermittent. 

Anyway, I'm driving back home, completely soaked, defroster barely able to keep things visible due to the humidity escaping my person. Just a couple miles from my house, I see a very odd sight...some guy is running down the side of the road, pushing a baby carriage. It's still pouring rain. If that wasn't odd enough, this ""kook"" even waved at me - a random car traveling down a fairly busy highway. I waved back, but thought...man. There's somebody more nuts than me.

Weekends are made for long runs and I normally do two, one on each day. Tonight's run was a little more than 12 miles. I reached 11 miles tonight after cresting a mile long uphill. At the top of the hill there is a little park with a third mile loop surrounding it. As I enter the park, two overweight night-joggers, (a man and a woman) point at my skinny, hard breathing self and proceed to laugh at my form. The man even did an impression of me. I neither said nor did anything to provoke those assholes. Instead of saying anything to that fat fuck, I simply picked up the pace and lapped him twice, hitting 12 miles before leaving the park and heading home. 

I haven't be laughed at for running since I was overweight and even then, it was in the form of mocking encouragement; a frat/bro yelled ""Run Forrest run"" at me.

I have never mocked nor discouraged anyone for working out, and cannot believe that someone who was barely running had the nerve to be a complete jackass. I celebrate anyone who runs or works out and never think less of anyone who does not. I was raised to judge a person by their character and nothing more. I still practice that to this day. 

But fuck that fat fuck. I ran 12.25 miles tonight, capping off a 33.4 mile week, and closing in on a 100 mile month; not bad considering I was injured from December-February. I hope that jackass guy has a good a run tonight, maybe if he feels better about himself, he won't make fun of others.

Thanks for taking the time to read this.

But it usually goes away) this time it didn't want to go away. My lips, fingertips, and toes started turning blue so we went to the ER. Apparently my heart was beating about 280 bpm and they tried 3 different times to slow it down, but that didnt work. Eventually they had to restart my heart and it finally went back to somewhat normal.

Docs say I have WPW (Wolff Parkinson White syndrome... I included a link) any other runners out there have that?

One of the runners had to stop running, apparently because of a leg cramp or something. It must have been pretty bac because he wasn't able to stand on his left leg at all. Now after running 42k I can only imagine how hard it must be to stand on one leg and he couldn't move forward at all, so it was all he could do to try to not fall over but he could hardly keep standing. The spectators couldn't come to his help because of the fences and somehow, the marathon staff didn't react. Some runners ran by until finally one stopped to help keep him standing. Then another one stopped to help.

Now, this was roughly 100 meters before the finish line and we could see the two helper try to convince the hurt guy to walk to the finish but he just wasn't able to do so. So, without thinking for two long, the two runners who had stopped took the hurt guy by his arms and half carried him towards the finish. 

Those runners decided within seconds to abandon their strive for good running times and instead helping a hurt stranger pass the finish line at all. They did this after running 42km and without thinking much. I think that's an outstanding display of kindness and shows how intrinsically good those two people were in their hearts. I stand in awe!

It was nice and cool so I figured she could handle it. The temperature had gone from mid 80's to low 70's. 

So, I get the collar and leash on her and we start off down the road. We haven't gone two hundred feet and then thunder breaks over head and it begins to rain. But, it is a light rain and it feels good. We continue. 

I run in a section of woods with wicked tall pine and fir trees. Looks like a forest straight out of a story book. We get there, and it is now raining hard. As in, you cannot even see two dozen feet in front of you. Thunder is booming every minute or two. 

My big ass German shepherd is keeping up as I'm running like a mad-man, shirtless through the woods with thunder booming and the rain filling the air. I'm shouting encourage to myself and pounding through puddles. 

TLDR; I ran through the woods during a thunderstorm with my badass German shepherd and I felt like a Viking.

Funny thing is every time I've seen that dude running covered in his shit I was thinking it's impossible for it to happen to myself.

I'm not racing, I don't compete, I run 40 minutes with ~150ish bpm to lose some fat, empty stomach in the morning. I was at around 20th minute when I felt very hard pain in my belly, it bend me over but I somehow kept going, it passed after 10 seconds. At around 25th minute of a run I felt great and sudden urge to take a shit. Thought I can finish at that time but few seconds later it was clear that ain't going to happen, I was maybe 5 minutes walk from my home. The immense power shit was forcing itself through my asshole was something I've never felt before and mind that I kept myself from shitting having diarrhea during 8hr shift, people told me I was green but I held it. I always thought it's impossible to shit myself but that was something different. I was walking and moaning from pain from clinching my asshole, Maybe 20 meters away from the doors of my home I felt that my ass is giving up and shit is coming out, I freaked out cause I. a grown man, was about to shit my pants and from what I was feeling that already happened, Yes, it did. Now most bizarre thing.., Shit came out and made a contact with underwear, there were clear sings of that and.... went back into the colon. I got to the toilet, left massive dump which looked like something a cow made rather than a human and that was it.

So, no changes in diet, low intensity, not my first time and such thing can happen. Scared me enough to not ever even try competing. If my shit was any looser I would look like that dude wearing pants made of his diarrhea. Dunno why but wanted to share ;), sorry for my English.

Since then I have gone from nearly dying after 3km to running 5km in just under 25 minutes (Male/23/5'9). I have so much more energy and I can already see the positive effect it's having on my body. 

Anyway, I really feel committed to my daily runs (5km in the morning and 5 km at night where possible). I finished work at 12 midnight last night and decided to go for a run around the bay near my house. About half way into my run I noticed a boat quite close to me with a bright spot light and it was shining on me from time to time, I thought it was just fisherman looking for a good spot and kept running. About 1minute later I noticed a police wagon driving down the street towards me, it drove past and just stopped. 

By this stage I was thinking that they were looking for someone on the run and I kept looking back incase they sent some dogs on me, thinking I was a burglar or something. I was feeling very anxious at this point and unsure what was going on but in true runner form I kept running. 

I ran another Km and then the wagon came flying down the street and drove next to me as I was running, I pulled out my headphones and they told me to stop and come over to the car.

At this stage I had the boat (which turned out to be a police boat) shining its lights on me from the water and the police officers asking me who I was and what I was doing. 

Long story short, I just said I was going for my nightly run and they said ""we had a call saying there was a man running around the bay"". 

Let me also state that the bay I run around is a known running track, during the day it's full of people. 

I couldn't believe they sent a police boat and a car to in estivate someone running around a running track! They appologised and ended up saying they were just doing their job, which I completely understand. But as for the person who called, I think they really need help. Who sits in their house looking out a window at 12:30am, to then see a runner and then have the nerve to call police? It's beyond stupidity.

I swelled with pride and humility as I stood on the starting line of the 2012 Olympic marathon trials, listening to Joan Benoit Samuelson, winner of the first women’s Olympic marathon in 1984, offer words of encouragement to the 191 women, ages 22-50, about to embark on the next 26.2 miles of a journey to discover what we are capable of as runners and as women.  I was proud of the work I had done to land myself a spot among such an elite group of marathoners, and incredibly humble thinking about what the top tier athletes standing at the front of the pack – who would be running close to a minute faster per mile than I was – had done to make themselves contenders in the strongest field of American women marathoners ever assembled.


**Mile 8:  Cooperation and Competition**
At mile eight, I found myself comfortably ensconced in a pack of about 30 women running 6:15-6:20 pace – the pace we had needed to run to qualify for the event.  We were a happy, solid pack, secure in the knowledge that we had no chance to qualify for London, but nevertheless pushing ourselves to do what we knew we were capable of and to enjoy the positive energy of the day.  At one point a spectator yelled out for us “break up the pack” and “compete,” to which one of our pack responded, “we love our pack.”  What the spectator didn’t understand – but what the athletes who will represent us in London do, as we found out when they discussed their race at the awards lunch – is that cooperation and competition can co-exist.  Sure, each one of us wanted to finish ahead of all the others, but we also knew that running as a group would make us all run better and that running our best would require both cooperation and competition.


**Mile 18:  Suffering and Elation**
Just before mile 18, the race started to get hard.  Glycogen stores were breaking down and I was beginning to suffer.  Then, as our pack approached the final 8 mile-loop of our course, the lead motorcycle whizzed by us.  Meb Keflezighi had just taken a convincing lead over Ryan Hall. It was mile 26 for him (the men started 15 minutes ahead of us and ran the same looped course) and mile 18 for us, we cheered along with the crowds as Meb cruised by us and headed into his final 400 meters.  The crowds were wild and the energy propelled us forward, with the joy of being in that moment making the physical pain barely noticeable.  


**Mile 20:  Alone and Together**
By mile 20, our group started to break up.  We were all suffering to varying degrees, and though we were still together in small clusters, each was alone in her pain.  At this point, we were each relying on the grit that got us to the starting line in the first place to get us to the finish.  I got passed by a few people in those final miles, and passed an equal number myself, and I felt a comforting solidarity, despite knowing that the only way to get to the finish line was through my own power.


**The Final Paradox:  There is no finish line**
While I had been on pace at 20 miles to run 2:44, my final 10K was not blistering.  I fell off pace considerably, but did not completely fall apart.  I finished in 2:47:44, my second fastest of the 10 marathons I’ve run in the last 15 years.  I’m looking forward to a nice long rest, celebrating my 40th birthday, and then competing once again.  The final paradox is that while I’m satisfied with my performance on Saturday and thrilled that I was part of such an amazing event, I know that I have a faster marathon in me.  40-year-old Sheri Piers ran 2:37:09 on Saturday, and 50-year-old Linda Somers Smith ran 2:37:36.  They are proof that age is not our enemy, and inspiration to continue this fantastic journey.

My wife and I left our jobs as high school teachers to travel the US with our three children in an RV. We spend our time seeking out interesting mountain trails, running ultras, and conducting barefoot/minimalist shoe clinics. 

I do some training barefoot, race occasional races barefoot, and use various degrees of minimalist shoes for most races.

My goal is to raise awareness about running form and providing people with accurate information about barefoot and minimalist shoe running, including the pros and cons. While I am a strong supporter of ""natural"" running, I am also an open-minded skeptic. There's a great deal of misinformation spread by others. I try to get both proponents and detractors to understand how and why people *may* want to consider making a transition.

1368046270.0,318,self.running,1dyexg,Marathon Report/Engagement Surprise,374,56,50,http://www.reddit.com/r/running/comments/1dyexg/marathon_reportengagement_surprise/,"So I signed up for the Pittsburgh half marathon earlier this year, and was quickly persuaded to switch to the full marathon. I had done two halves, but never a full. Before the marathon, my boyfriend, a few others, and I had a conversation where we were talking about he doesn't get to wear his suit often. Boyfriend, who was sitting this marathon out, made the joke that he would wear his suit to the finish line of the marathon as he hand delivered me a Frank’s Buffalo Chicken pizza, something that has become a traditional post-race meal for us. As the date got closer, I confessed to my boyfriend my reservations about my ability to finish the marathon, despite hours and hours of training and 20-mile long runs. He promised that if I finished, he would have a surprise for me. 

So the day before the marathon, he had told me that he forgot that he promised me a surprise and that he didn’t have anything in mind yet. I didn't think that much of it, but at the race expo, we passed the Humane Society booth and I jokingly (okay, not that jokingly) told him he could get me a kitten for the finish line. The night before the big 26.2, I told him that I felt like I was preparing to go into the Hunger Games. He told me to think of it as a Quidditch match instead. I did not like his lackadaisical attitude towards what was probably going to be the most difficult thing I had ever done. 

The morning of the race, I was strangely calm and maintained composure, even though in the days before I was a huge ball of nerves. The weather was perfect with a high of 71 degrees, and I was feeling great. I was running with a friend who I had trained with for the last four months, and we were completely in sync. The first 18 miles flew by, including a few big hills. The crowd was out in full force in every neighborhood, and the spectators truly made it the most enjoyable race I had ever done. At mile 18 or so, the sun was directly on us and even little hills began to feel huge. We began to walk through the fluid stations and took a few minutes to catch our breath. The last 4 miles or so were downhill, and as soon as we hit the last mile, we started running way too fast. We purposely slowed ourselves down as to enjoy the finish as much as possible. The crowd was amazing and regardless of how much we tried to slow down, our last mile was by far our fastest. As my running partner and I crossed the finish line, I broke into tears. Still overwhelmed at finishing my first full marathon (and under my goal time as well (4:50-not that fast, but I was still thrilled)).

After a round of hugs and congratulations, it still didnt register that my family was in the press only area. I did notice my boyfriend was indeed wearing his suit, but there was no pizza box around. Instead, he pulled out a smaller box. Inside was a Golden Snitch locket from Harry Potter. (In the last book, Harry is left the Snitch in Dumbledore’s will and figures out that it “opens at the close” -pretty nerdy and uber cheesy, dont judge). He said it was the close of the marathon, and that I should open it. Inside the locket, the words “Will you marry me?” were written. At that point, I pretty much fell to the ground, with the help of my boyfriend kind of gently lowering me to break the fall, and started violently sobbing and ugly crying. Good thing there were loads of cameras there to catch that! After I collected myself to the point where I could stand, people around realized what had happened and everyone broke into screams and yells and applause. I tried to say “Yes!”, but I’m pretty sure all that came out were muffled sobs and a head shake. It was truly a surreal series of events. He gave me the ring and with hugs and screams from everyone, including strangers, we made our way to the finish line festival. Along the way, the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette stopped and talked to us and asked to write an article about the proposal. He writer asked him why he did it at the end of the marathon. His response was “I figured she would be so tired from running the marathon that she couldn’t run away from me.” I wouldn’t have ever tried. 

EDIT: thank you all! I wasnt sure how this would be received on r/running and I wasn't expecting this much love! here is a video my sister recorded of the proposal. warning: lots of tears. I'm sorry I don't know how to make it a pretty link. &lt;3

I've never been a very fast runner, and I am not quite to the point where I can run an entire 5k without walking for at least .25 mile somewhere in the middle.  I've been improving, though, and that's all that matters.  There was a 5k in my hometown a few weeks ago that benefited the Special Olympics.  My little sister competes in the games every year and I think it's an excellent program.  This year was even more special because her T-shirt design was the design used in our town's Special Olympics games!  I was ecstatic!  I even bought the very last T-shirt they had and wore it on race day.  I finished the race in 37 minutes, beating my personal goal by 3 minutes!  To top it all off, my little sister was there to see me finish the race wearing her t-shirt.  Needless to say, it was a great day.

**Don't be this guy** This was a very small race that ended on a track in a public park.  As racers were seen closing in on the finish line, the stop-watch guy would shout ""Runner on the track!""  The guy who won the race (in something like 19 minutes) stood by the stop-watch guy after he had gotten his bagel and whatnot.  When one of the runners who came in about a minute before me got close to the track, stop-watch guy yelled ""Runner on the track!"" and the race winner said ""We're using that term loosely now, huh?""

My boyfriend was on the track when the guy said that and he told me about it some time later.  It made me feel sad, but not about my own abilities.  I consider myself a runner.  Not a very ""good"" one by his standards, but running is such a personal thing that I don't feel as though he had any place to say such a terrible thing!  I see folks on this subreddit who are so supportive of beginner runners that I guess I fooled myself into thinking that all runners are that supportive.  So, he didn't ruin *my* day, but I hope this kind of thing is never said in earshot of a beginner runner who loses drive because of one person's arrogance.

Edit: Thank you (to most of you) for the supportive comments. I really love this community. I would like to clarify a few things

1. When I say this was a very small race,  I mean VERY small. There were maybe 25 people in all. The Special Olympics receives no public funding and all of the race fees stay in the county. So,  even if I hadn't stepped foot on pavement for a year, I would have participated in this race. I would have happily participated, even if I had to walk. It's a very special cause and it happened to be a good run, also.

2. This guy didn't phase me, I just wanted to post my story as a reminder to more elite runners that everyone started somewhere, and this kind of talk might discourage future runners.  I am still training, and I hope to get my 5k time down, of course, but not to prove anything to that guy. And when I get to a point where I have finished a race and gotten my bagel and I'm waiting on other folks, I'll cheer them on just as I've seen some of you do!

1360323172.0,310,self.running,184kmm,Five Other Pieces of Advice for First-Time Marathoners,362,52,56,http://www.reddit.com/r/running/comments/184kmm/five_other_pieces_of_advice_for_firsttime/,"After reading [There Is Nothing For You Here](http://www.reddit.com/r/running/comments/183hwa/there_is_nothing_for_you_here_six_things_every/), as a former marathoner I felt like some other things needed to be said. And it's not that anything written there was just false, as much as it's incomplete and varies by person. 

**1. You will be a different person inside, even if nothing else around you changes as a result.** You set a goal, you worked hard for that goal, and you completed that goal. Let yourself enjoy that a bit, because regardless of whatever else you do in life, no one will ever be able to take that away from you. 

**2. Most other people won't care, but they don't matter.** You are going to want to tell the world that you're training for it. All about your long runs, your early morning midweek recovery runs, your juggling of work and running, how your feet hurt, your pasta binges, everything. And you will find out very quickly that the only people who will really listen to you are (1) those who truly love you like family, and (2) other runners. Use them, especially other runners, to commiserate and talk strategy and get psyched. Your co-workers will brand you as the crazy person training for a marathon, and they may even turn the other way when you come into the coffee room.  But they are not why you're doing this -- you're doing it for you, for your family, for the charity you've selected, but mostly for you. Find other runners to talk to, and you will get instant validation that you're not crazy. Runners love talking about running. 

**3. It isn't a race.** Not the first time out, at least. Just get past the finish line, and set time goals later, if you decide to do it again. I had a two-marathon strategy going into my first -- complete the first one, and then learn from it and improve my time on the second. I did that, by just under 10 minutes. I was delighted with both of my finishes. 

**4. The training changes you more than the marathon itself.** If crossing the finish line seems anti-climactic to you when you do it, it's because the transformation already happened. You were a marathoner before you hit the starting line -- 5 days' training per week, 40-50 miles per week running, 20 mile long runs, everything. The change in you already happened; you're just using the race itself to prove it. 

**5. Remind yourself occasionally of what you did.** It is true that any euphoria you get immediately after will disappear within a day or two, but the accomplishment is still yours, forever. Don't shy away from that. Keep the medal and the shirt, buy the finish line picture, and every once in a while you can take a look at those things and remind yourself how hard it seemed when you first decided to do it, and how good it felt to actually do it. How many times did you almost quit, and yet got up that next morning and kept at it, completely through self-motivation? You did good, so appreciate that.

1345259531.0,307,self.running,yeuf1,10 months ago my wife almost died from pulmonary embolisms... This is her finishing a 5K tonight.,369,62,47,http://www.reddit.com/r/running/comments/yeuf1/10_months_ago_my_wife_almost_died_from_pulmonary/,"End of September last year my wife ran a 5K in 29 minutes and some change.  She had been spending months training, working her time down gradually, and that was her 3rd one since the middle of summer.  She was feeling great, in great shape and looking forward to moving on to 10K runs.  About a week later she came home early from jogging having trouble breathing and some tightness in her chest.  She thought maybe it was anxiety, a pulled muscle, tried to rationalize it off but it didn't get better over the course of the rest of the week.  

By Thursday she could barely breath at all and the pain was unbearable.  She went to her doctor's office that day and the physician's assistant she saw dropped the ball significantly giving her a diagnosis of pleurisy.  The pain and her difficulty breathing were so intense by the next day that I rushed her to the ER and we discovered it wasn't pleurisy but actually blood clots in her lungs after a CT scan was performed.  

We were both pretty shocked since she was so active and had been making so much progress running.  Over the course of the weekend I watched her health continue to decline and I knew she was dying. I had to yell at the resident on her floor in order to get a specialist in to see her.  We discovered that her right lung was literally full of clots and her left not as bad, but still not good.  The pulmonary doctor called in a world class hematologist (former head of hematology at UofM for 30+ years) because he wasn't sure why my wife wasn't dead yet, so extra perspective was in order.  The hematologist ordered a TPA treatment for her which saved her life.  

At the end of it, what we were told would be a 3-4 day hospital stay had dragged into almost 2 weeks, a month of bed rest, and lasting side effects due to lung damage.  She'll be on coumadin the rest of her life, her diaphragm has fused to her right lung due to the scar tissue that developed and a heavy workout that would leave a normal person feeling drained for a few hours can potentially wipe her out for a couple days.

Even with all that, she decided she would run again and set her goal for the same 5K she ran last year before this nightmare happened.  Her cousin called her yesterday to see if she wanted to run a 5K that was happening today and after some debate she decided to go for it.  This picture is of her finishing with a time for 33 minutes 24 seconds.  Her goal was to come in under 40 minutes.  http://i.imgur.com/5sODo.jpg

I can't really express how proud I am of her for doing this after all the struggles she's been through.  I'm thankful every day that I just get to spend another day with her.  She's an amazing woman, an amazing mother and one of the strongest people I know.

TL;DR - Wife almost died because lungs filled with blood clots, has lasting damage that makes breathing tough, finished a 5K in respectable time.  Picture: http://i.imgur.com/5sODo.jpg

EDIT:  Probably should have mentioned my wife is 32 years old, and has had two children.

1368778548.0,305,self.running,1ei9k9,So...this is it.,374,69,87,http://www.reddit.com/r/running/comments/1ei9k9/sothis_is_it/,"Hello. 
I don't know what all I wanted to write here but just get some things off my chest. 

About me: I'm 24, not fat but not fit.
I am one of those ""unless I'm being chased, I'm not going to run"" kind of people. If I ever did run, it was on a treadmill and not outside. Smoker for years, work 10-12 hour shifts at a gas station with no lunches or breaks. My pattern has been wake up-work-sleep for as long as I can remember.  I enjoy working out... but in small doses but eventually slack off.  I'm pretty lazy when I wake up or get off work. 

So I met this guy (lets just call him Sam)  shows up in my life. I've only went one one date with him at this time.  Sam is this well traveled, educated, awesome guy who has ran marathons and still does. Anyway, I asked him if he wanted to go to the park with me and just walk the track. First lap is rather slow and steady. Nothing special just a simple pace and chit-chat. Second lap I said ""I wonder how long this track is?"" He turns on his Nike app and this time we speed walk it to find out its either exactly one mile or 1.1 (give or take for GPS). We did it in 17 ish min.  At this point I'm thinking ok let's gtfo and home... 

Sam says ""let's do one more but run the whole time. Everyone should be able to run a mile without stopping"" ... Now in my head I am like ""lol me run without stopping!? "" I explained to him that being a smoker and not active wouldn't work out in our favor. Pretty much giving myself an excuse to not do it, but he convinces me to do it. I remember pointing on the other side of the track how I wouldn't make it that far without a break. 

So the run starts! (Mind you this is terrain of inclines and turns.) At first everything was going better than expected,  even side by side and sort of talking. Going down hill we get to where I pointed and he says ""Look at you! You made it to the spot without stopping and I'm proud of you!"" That moment right there was a HUGE BOOST for me. Continuing we start hitting the inclination that curves and he passes me and I feel I may slow down and fail... not just embarrass myself in front of a marathon runner who I'm wanting to date more... but fail myself. 

I told him ""I don't think I will make it  with you in front of me, might as well go on without me"" he looks at me funny and said ""We'll then I'll get behind you and push you. (And he literally does) You can do it and we are half way done. "" So I press on! Coming to the 3/4 mark of the run I keep slowing down and he keeps trying to keep me up.  I told him that my lungs feel like someone is squeezing them and I can't breath! He just looks at me and says ""well you are talking so you seem to be breathing alright. "" and I press on.

Down to the final stretch of the run I slowed down to a speed walk and I felt like it would be the end for me doing this. I put my hands over my head and sort of run-ish/walk until he says ""you started strong will end strong, now get your as up here! "" I pretty much push myself to the finish line with him telling me I'm not allowed to stop.

And we finish... I feel like laying dead on the floor because I didn't realise how out of shape I really was.  Sam brings me water and sprays it on my head laughing  as a way of saying congratulations for finishing.  So many things ran through my mind...

Did I embarrass myself?
Where Is my life going if I can't even run a mile?
Does he think less of me? 
I am sure I look like a loser....

Well panting on the side walk by the car Sam sits next to me and says ""I'm proud of you.""  I told him ""I'm sorry if I look weak because nothing says date me like sweaty, out of breath, and sitting on the floor"" . He responded with the best thing,  he kissed me and said ""nope still think your awesome but now you have to run more so you get use to it and we can do this more"" 

The whole time I was giving excuses to stop and just give up but Sam made sure I saw it through and showed me that I am better than I give myself credit for. 10 min run for a mile made me stoked. 

Moral of the story is that even though I kept telling myself I couldn't do it, all it took was someone to show me that I could and don't let myself be the one that stops me from a goal.  

Tonight I went back to that park, alone,  ran a mile in 11 min without stopping . I have never felt so proud of myself. 

Also music helps.

I keep pace while we stare at each other and then the doe takes off running up the hill. As mental motivation I tell myself to keep her in sight and pick up the pace to a sprint. As I come to the top of the hill there is a public drinking water fountain I usually stop at, but the doe kept looking at me so I continued the ""chase"". Eventually she stops to where I pass her and after I get a dozen yards pass I turn around and make eye contact while jogging backwards; she begins to run with me at my 4 o'clock position. We run together for about a half mile before I realize there are cars stopped in the road. I pull one of my earbuds out and as I make eye contact with one of the drivers he yells out that it was so awesome he had to watch it.

Why? Because (at the time of writing) his awful elitist angry post has 5 upvotes. If I were a beginner, or insecure in my running, I would find his post, and those upvotes, to be incredibly discouraging. I am writing this to let people know that his view is not *The Runnit Way*.

I will start by relaying a classic story of mine: I used to manage a rock climbing gym at a university, for many years.  Obviously, as the club president, my job was to promote the gym, get people learning, etc, and create a fun, friendly atmosphere. This is hard to do, because of people like Seydar.

What happens is that after a year or two, a noob starts to get stronger. He climbs more often then the other noobs, and soon, starts to complain about them. He bitches that they sweat on the holds. He bitches about them not taking turns properly. And so on. You would not *believe* how easily we forget where we came from. I've seen it over, and over, and over again.

And so to read Seydar's rant is to see this exact thing. He states that ""he'll continue to dispense advice"" to the idiots who get hurt... He makes himself feel better, by trying to create a club of ""runners"" and ""non-runners"". He obviously thinks he's a runner, because he is an ""intellectual"" of the sport.

But if you're a beginner, here are a few things I think are important:

**1)** Everyone was a beginner. Even those D1 track stars started out as dorky kids in short shorts fumbling their way around a high school track. Their daddies bought them their first pair of spikes. Me? I remember emailing *everyone* I know when I ran my first 12 km! Holy shit! 12 km! We all start at the bottom. Most of us will forget it.

**2)** There is no club. There are no ""runners"" and ""non-runners"". There are no special privileges on here for ""runners"". There's no bumper sticker. You are a runner when you are out running, and only then.

**3)** You are competing against only yourself. Unless you are olympic caliber, there is always a faster runner. So the corollary to that is: do not value yourself based on your performance. Just because you run slower than me doesn't make you a worse ""runner"".

**4)** There are thousands of people out there who want to help you to learn as much as you can. They will help you with your goals, both setting them, and achieving them. They will tell you what books were good, and what shoes they liked. They won't answer your questions and curse you anonymously. They will be glad you've decided to *share* running with them.

Because I think the only thing that makes someone a runner is *running*, and the only thing better than running is running with someone else.",,False,,t5_2qlit,False,,,True,t3_gzko8,http://www.reddit.com/r/running/comments/gzko8/runners_nonrunners_and_running_on_being_a_beginner/,

You don't know me, so I'll introduce myself. My name is Flint, and I write the blog FlintLand, which you might know because of a certain post titled ""Hey, Fat Girl"".

Since writing this post, I have received hundreds of comments from many people who were touched by the text. But a couple weeks ago, I got this one :

""Flint, almost a year ago I came across your blog, as a new recent runner again. I had quit after having kids and gained over 115lbs. I printed this open letter and hung it on my fridge, I read it every single day before I go to the gym at 430a and or a run at 430a. I have since lost over 120lbs, ran 2 halfs, numerious 15Ks, 10Ks, and 5Ks. I recently PRed last weekend in a 5K with 25:48! I was one of tbe lucky 30,000 to register for the Chicago Marathon on Feb. 19th, and in Dec doing my first Ultra a 50K trail run. I began to run again to loose weight, BUT I gained myself back. I am a runner, my life has never been better, the renewed self confidence and energy I have is amazing. I felt I needed to thank you for this letter, it gave me the motivation every day to get out the door! Thank you Flint, as this former ""fat girl"" couldnt have done it withput your kind words! Amie B.""

I was very moved, to say the least. 

So I had an idea. If you guys could help me find who Amie B is, and what ultra she will run, I will go there myself and be her pacer. And of course write about it, and shed some well-deserved light on how awesome her journey to health has been.

What do you think?

I am not very good at Reddit, I'm sorry, so I'm not too sure how to go about this from here. I'll leave it to you guys if you can help.

Thanks :)

Run free,


Flint

I wrote it down, put it up on my wall, and made a plan. Using Hal Higdon's beginner marathon training schedule, I tweaked it to match the days I could run, and set a date to start my training. Prior to official training I went out and did a few test runs, initially I couldn't run more than 2 miles without knee pain. The pain was enough that it forced me to stop each time. Finally I purchased new shoes and purchased a knee brace. After a few weeks I was up to 10 miles. That's when I felt like I could actually finish the marathon.

Fast forward to race day. The first 15 miles went exactly as planned. My goal was to run 11:30 miles. Given how my knee had been treating me this year, speed was not a goal at all. I only wanted to finish it. After the 15 mile mark I seriously slowed down, partially because of some large hills. My split paces finally got so slow that I stopped listening to my iPhone. 

Towards the end I don't know that I ever hit a wall, unless you count needing to find the nearest port-o-potty on multiple occasions. 

Finishing was one of the best feelings. I would do it again. 

Just wanted to encourage you guys, if you write a plan, put your mind to it, and take active steps to complete it, you can finish a marathon too!

1372086849.0,271,self.running,1gz0bt,Tips for Running in the Heat,326,55,169,http://www.reddit.com/r/running/comments/1gz0bt/tips_for_running_in_the_heat/,"Background: Ran the Franklin Half Marathon in TN this past Saturday.  Highs for the day were supposed to reach the low 90s, but the race was due to start at 7, and since I was shooting for a sub-90 minute time, I figured I didn't need to follow my usual routine for running in the heat.  

*Big* mistake.

Race start ended up being delayed for about a half hour due to a massive backup for parking.  The morning was nice and foggy, but by the time the race started, the fog had left and we were left baking in the sun at the start.  To compound my problems, the course had very little shade - back country roads with few trees and no breeze.  At this point, I'm kicking myself for not bringing a hand bottle.

Long story short, I was on pace at the 5K split, at which point the heat hit me like a ton of bricks.  I ended up finishing at 1:39, missing my goal by 10 minutes and having a generally miserable run.  Had I followed my usual hot weather routine, I probably wouldn't have run as poorly.  So anyway, here are some tips for hot weather running (feel free to add):

1. Wear a hat or visor.  Sunglasses help as well if you don't care about goofy tan lines.

2. Light colored and loose fitting clothing.  Wearing a shirt will help better regulate body temperature than running without one.

2b. Cotton kills!  Tech shirts are a lifesaver when you start to sweat.

3. Sunscreen.  Especially if you pop your shirt off.  

4. Water.  Even with water stations at every mile, I was still hurting in between.  Having my hand bottle would have been great, even just to keep rinsing my mouth out.  A [water backpack](http://shop.camelbak.com/dart/d/1249_c_131_cl_3306) is also an option, as is leaving a bottle in a hidden spot on your route.

4b. Take advantage of public water - outdoor fountains, public locations with water fountains, etc.

5. Ice.  My personal favorite.  Tossing some ice cubes under your hat helps cool your head as well as lowers your body temp due to all the heat that is lost through your head.

6. Salt tablets.  Probably not necessary during a half unless you plan on being out there for 2+ hours, but you need to replace all the salt you will inevitably lose due to sweat.  Also prevents hyponatremia from drinking too much water.

7. Run early or late.  

8. MOST IMPORTANTLY know the signs of [heatstroke](http://www.mayoclinic.com/health/heat-stroke/DS01025/DSECTION=symptoms).

Its finally summer and its hot.  Run smart.  Feel free to add your own tips.

1369183732.0,267,self.running,1eswf3,What's an overpronator to do?,313,46,136,http://www.reddit.com/r/running/comments/1eswf3/whats_an_overpronator_to_do/,"I've been fighting posterior shin splints for about 6 months now.  I spent more time reading and guessing at the cause and cures than I care to admit.  

I finally gave up and went to a sports medicine orthopedic doc a couple of weeks ago, thinking he'd look at my feet, shins, shoes, etc, and give me a solid direction.  I was happy I went, but not too thrilled with the results.  

As background, the issues started when I tossed my 5-year old Asics Gel series shoes (way overdue for replacement) and purchased a pair of ASICS GT-2170s.  First few hundred feet of my first run in them and I had some serious heel pain.  Kept trying to ease into them and it only got worse.  Eventually required a doctor visit, anti-inflammatory meds, and a few weeks off.

Swapped the Asics for Brooks Adrenalin GTS-12s.  Felt good, no heel pain, but over the next month, noticed the shin splints becoming more persistent.  Read lots about causes...too much too fast, poor foot strike, etc.  I even spent a couple months transitioning to a mid-foot strike to be sure that wasn't the case.  Forced myself to do it by getting a pair of Saucony Kinvara 3's.  Went through the expected calf soreness, and I believe I came out a much better runner for doing it.

No matter which shoe I used and for how long, the shin pain was still there.  I was convinced I wasn't much of an overpronator, but that was all I had left.  That's when I went to the ortho.

He looked at my shins, poked, said ""does that hurt"", I said ""yes"", and he said classic posterior shin splints.  Suggested Aleve twice a day, a break from running for a few weeks, stretching, and some additional theraband exercises to target those specific muscles.  I had already tried lots of stretching and time off.  Oddly he never mentioned pronation or the shoes.  So I asked.  He said ""That is possible"" and suggested the Kinvaras were a bad idea and to go back to Asics with good arch support.  Showed me what to look for with rear-to-mid sole rigidity and firm heel cup.

So...do I really invest in another pair of support shoes that aren't much different than the Brooks I already have?  Does anyone have any other suggestions before I blow another $100?  I don't have a lot of confidence that it will do a lot of good.  To make it worse, I really enjoy the minimalist feel of the Kinvaras and hate going back to a bulky support shoe.  But I don't think there is such an animal as a motion control shoe with lower stack height and minimal drop.  

EDIT: Wow!  Just Wow!  You all rock!  I can't believe how much great advice and ideas you've given me.  Would love to thank each and everyone of you individually, but long work days, kids and wife are keeping me from sitting in front of this thing for more than a few minutes.  There's lots of things here to try and offers of help.  I'm sincerely grateful for each and every reply!  I will follow up with some thoughts and things I forgot about a little later.  Just wanted to say THANKS, though!

EDIT 2: Some additional background...

* I've used compression sleeves.  While running, they don't seem to help and make me feel like they're limiting my range of motion.  During recovery, I feel like they help a little.  Shins feel good while I'm wearing them after a run.
* The pain is sometimes there WHEN I run, but not always.  It is there SOMETIMES after running and lasts a couple of days.  If I run one day then take 2 off, it's a steady routine of pain and recovery.  More frequently, pain increases.
* I'm currently working on strength training.  Squats, lunges, calf raises, and the theraband exercises the doctor gave me.  I had been doing all but the theraband stuff before, but not often.  I usually skipped lower body work because I didn't want to overdo it while I was running.  But I'm now hitting it every day for about 3 weeks to start building a base.
* I'm definitely not looking for a crutch (control shoes).  I worked hard through the transition to minimalist and better form in hopes that this would be the fix.  I'm now working on strength and stretching.  My preference is to fix my body, not my shoes.  The support shoes is just what the ortho recommended so I'm considering it.

EDIT 3: Some of the suggestions paraphrased to the point that they're probably inaccurate or just plain dangerous:

* Gait analysis at a proper running store
* Go to several stores to be sure they aren’t upselling a particular brand
* Strengthen quads, reduces unwanted knee movement
* Squat heavy and deep
* Try custom orthotics
* Green SuperFeet
* Orange SuperFeet
* Strengthen Gluteus Medius
* See a good ATC or PT
* Trail running
* Run barefoot
* Don’t run barefoot
* Vary runs from day to day (concrete, grass, stairs, sprints, hills)
* Read “Born to Run”

EDIT 4: Not sure if anyone is still reading this post.  I got some time this weekend to tape myself running.  I was surprised at what I saw.  If I see what I think I see, I may actually be supinating rather than overpronating.  I'd love your thoughts.  Each video shows rear (full speed), rear (slo-mo), then front.

* [Old Asics GEL-1140](http://youtu.be/m0NI7FoPMaU) NOT 1170 like the caption says...

* [Saucony Kinvara 3](http://youtu.be/Hiw_Unsh30k)

As I said...no shin pain with the Asics (lower weekly mileage) but the Brooks and Saucony both cause shin pain with nearly every run.

So I ran the London Marathon on Sunday, it was kind of the culmination of about 7 years of hard work and weight loss. I've lost over 100lbs over all, with 50lbs coming off in the last 8 months, however I am still a big guy weighing about 220lbs at the moment. Anyway, I'd been looking forward to it for so long, and I was incredibly excited before the race.

It started well enough, aside from stopping to nip to the toilets pretty soon after crossing the start line, I was maintaining a decent 9:30 pace which was my plan so I'd be comfortably under a 4:30 finish.

I should say at this point that during my training I'd had a couple of injuries; Achilles tendinitis in my left just before Christmas and then 6 weeks later in my right. So that basically meant that by the time I got round to my final long run 3 weeks before I'd only managed 18 miles.

So that said, on the day I breezed past 18 miles with no trouble at all, got to 20 miles and then started to feel it getting tougher, my quads started to hurt really quite a lot and my pace slipped to about 11:00s on average which I kind of expected and was ok with so I kept running.

What I wasn't prepared for was the constant sunshine, and I got so very dehydrated after this point. I felt constantly sick from here on out and had a splitting head ache, the gap between each water station was utterly horrific for me. But I kept running.

Then finally at 24 miles my legs just completely failed me, cramp everywhere, calves, hamstrings, quads, you name it, they all decided they'd had enough. I came to a screeching halt and could barely walk.

Every so often I would fight through it and run a little but I'd only manage about a minute or so before they cramped up again and I would have to walk/limp for a bit.

I don't think I've ever been so angry, frustrated, and upset with myself in my entire life, it was not a nice feeling.

I just about pulled it together for a ""sprint finish"" for the last few 100 yards. I finished in 04:47:26 and I was a complete physical and emotional wreck (which I had also expected) but this was not the ""Yes I did it!"" finish that I had been hoping for.

Has anyone else ever felt like this? Why am I not proud of myself? Why do I feel like I haven't achieved anything?

I had planned to get my first tattoo after the marathon to mark the occasion and to always remind myself of what I accomplished. Now I don't feel like I deserve it.

After I finished I said to myself that I would never do it again, but after thinking about it, I will be going in to the ballot for next year. I feel like I need to beat it, because on Sunday, I feel like it beat me.

Anyway, I just feel like I needed to write this down somewhere. Thanks for reading.

P.S for anyone interested, [here](http://i.imgur.com/qj3MOVM.jpg) is the race report from my watch along with my [splits](http://i.imgur.com/bWO4r2r.jpg)

EDIT: WOW! I just want to say thanks so much for all your advice and encouragement, it's really made a huge difference to how I'm viewing what happened on Sunday.

I definitely expected too much of it, but at least now I have a time to beat and I know what to expect for the most part.

I slipped into my half-conscious state and started flying.

This route is particular. It has clearly marked milestones, so say it's usual to see other runners trotting around often, although not as many when I commonly lace up—either too early in the morning or too late at night. 

Tonight, as I had a tad more than a mile left, a runner caught up with me. I thought I had seen him pass me by in the other direction earlier. I shrugged it off... For less than 10 seconds. I have no idea what got into me, the hell with it. I locked his pace and came closer. It was tensing. We made eye contact and instantly knew the chase was on. We began to taunt each other, pounding the pavement, our feet going back and forth in the flickering street lights.   

We pushed our legs to defeat. When we reached the end of the road he just looked at me as we both gasped for air and just said: ""mate, you *killed* me at the end. That was a great run. Thank you!"". We fist-bumped and went our ways.

I was psyched. I still am. A couple of months ago I decided take my running training more seriously and it's been wonderful even after I have fallen ill a couple of times and have had to work my ass off to get back on track. 

I feel these are exactly the kind of things that make me love this sport. They push you forward and make you want to strive for more. To want to make you light a fire under your feet and go on for miles on end.

I took a trip to Florida with some family and realized I HATED how I looked in a bikini. I remember almost crying one night cause I just hated my body so much.
As soon as I got back, I started hitting the gym. I'd go at least once a day, sometimes go for 10K bikes in the afternoons too and swim. But never really ran besides a mile or two on the treadmill.
June came around, and I did my first outside run. I'd been getting compliment on looking thinner lately but I didn't think I lost anything, seeing as my scale broke a month earlier and was giving me innacurate results. 
I remember the morning I got a new scale and discovered I'd lost almost 15 pounds. I was ecstatic, and went on my first full 5k run.
I ran everyday in the summer after that. Not even for the weight loss, just because I loved it. Everyone around me was so stressed out and down about life, and I found that after running I felt amazing, de-stressed, and extremely happy. I'm still in High School, and when I went back to class 2 months ago, I was a completely different person than when I finished last school year.

I am a college student so mornings usually aren't my thing, and I always find myself running at night after class, which is especially dangerous considering I live in downtown Birmingham, Alabama. 

This morning I woke up at 6:30am, put my shoes on and grabbed a power bar and my iPod and hit the road. I went out for a nice and easy four mile wake-up run, and I put This Will Destroy You's self-titled album (post-rock melodic music with no lyrics). It aided the creation of the most perfect atmosphere for running; it was 45 degrees, the sun was just breaking over Red Mountain and shining between the buildings and down the streets of downtown Birmingham. People were starting their days, getting their morning coffee, and this was something I wasn't used to seeing. The fog was retracting over the mountain with the rising sun, and it was a brilliant sight to see. The music in my iPod paralleled this experience; the simple, almost cinematic feel to the music allowed for reflection of my running journey that only started last September. I saw a new side of my city, but most importantly myself. I think I have a reason to get out of bed in the morning and to get into bed earlier at night. I realized that I think, as crazy as it sounds, I may have fallen in love with running.

Everywhere I look in here, whether it's a discussion about injury, endurance, speed, performance, pain or flexibility I see ""advice"" informing people they need to stretch. It's pervasive.

The problem with this advice is that it's just wrong. It's probably not harmful, but it's definitely not beneficial and I think the running community should be an evidence-based community. Let's examine the evidence for stretching. 

I know a lot of people have strong opinions on this because they have been told their whole lives to believe that stretching is beneficial, but I ask you to challenge yourself to examine the evidence objectively and truly re-evaluate your views on this subject.

**Does stretching prevent injury or help soreness?**

* [British Medical Journal: Effects of stretching before and after exercising on muscle soreness and risk of injury: systematic review](http://www.bmj.com/content/325/7362/468) - a systematic review of five studies concludes:
&gt; Stretching before or after exercising does not confer protection from muscle soreness. Stretching before exercising does not seem to confer a practically useful reduction in the risk of injury

* [Clinical Journal of Sport Medicine: Stretching before exercise does not reduce the risk of local muscle injury: a critical review of the clinical and basic science literature.](http://europepmc.org/abstract/MED/10593217/reload=0;jsessionid=BYr9LWEKFaul3crc7f8o.6) - a review of the literature concludes
&gt; The basic science literature supports the epidemiologic evidence that stretching before exercise does not reduce the risk of injury.

* [A randomized trial of preexercise stretching for prevention of lower-limb injury](http://andrewvs.blogs.com/files/stretching-to-prevent-injury.pdf) (pdf warning) - a study of stretching in the prevention of lower-limb injury concludes:
&gt; The results of this randomized, controlled trial indicate that preexercise muscle stretching does not produce a clinically worthwhile reduction in the risk of lower-limb injury

...there are many more, but let's not belabor the point.

**Does stretching improve sports performance, endurance or strength?**

* [Journal of strength and conditioning research: Effects of Static Stretching on Energy Cost and Running Endurance Performance](http://journals.lww.com/nsca-jscr/Abstract/2010/09000/Effects_of_Static_Stretching_on_Energy_Cost_and.2.aspx) - experimental survey of the energy cost of running for stretching and non-stretching participants. From the abstract:
&gt; Our findings suggest that stretching before an endurance event may lower endurance performance and increase the energy cost of running.

* [Does Stretching Improve Performance?: A Systematic and Critical Review of the Literature](http://journals.lww.com/cjsportsmed/Abstract/2004/09000/Does_Stretching_Improve_Performance___A_Systematic.4.aspx) - a systematic review of both acute and regular stretching finds:
&gt; An acute bout of stretching does not improve force or jump height, and the results for running speed are contradictory. Regular stretching improves force, jump height, and speed, although there is no evidence that it improves running economy.

* [Strength and conditioning journal: Stretching: Acute and Chronic? The Potential Consequences](http://journals.lww.com/nsca-scj/Abstract/2006/12000/Stretching__Acute_and_Chronic__The_Potential.10.aspx) - 
&gt; Although acute stretching, as part of a warm-up, can enhance range of motion, it may also reduce performance. Acute stretching can reduce peak force, rate of force production, and power output. Chronic stretching may enhance performance, although the mechanism is unclear. 

* [Journal of strength and conditioning research: Static Stretching Impairs Sprint Performance in Collegiate Track and Field Athletes](http://journals.lww.com/nsca-jscr/Abstract/2008/01000/Static_Stretching_Impairs_Sprint_Performance_in.4.aspx) - 
&gt; The results of this study suggest that performing a [static stretching] protocol following a dynamic warm-up will inhibit sprint performance in collegiate athletes.

There are way more examples. Just do a simple literature search and you'll find that very few studies conclude that stretching is beneficial, and those that do tend to be of lower quality. I believe that /r/running and the running community as a whole should be evidence-based and I think we need to stop giving advice that has been clearly shown to be wrong for many years.

I fully expect this to be downvoted. It's a long post and a lot of people will instinctively downvote as soon as they see something they disagree with instead of reading it. But I'm hoping at least a handful of you will reevaluate your views on this important subject and start giving advice that is reasoned and grounded with evidence.

I will still get to all of them, but I'm taking a break from the computer tonight. Keep asking away though, and I'll answer eventually! Have a good run.

Hey Runnit! So it's been a while since my last AMA, and since I'm on a break and have some free time as opposed to being wiped out from workouts, I thought it would be fun to introduce myself to any new people on here, and give others a chance to ask some new questions. My name is David Torrence, and I am professional track athlete sponsored by Nike.

My PR's are:

800m - 1:45.14

1500m - 3:34.25

Mile - 3:52.01

3000m - 7:47.80

5000m - 13:16.53

8000m XC - 23:25

I am a 4x US National Champ, been to the last two Olympic Trials, and have been ranked in the top 5 in the country in the 800m and 1500m in 2010, and just the 1500m in 2011. I was an All-American while at UC Berkeley (graduated in '08), and briefly held the school record in the mile. 

Although my accomplishments may be a bit more glamorous than the typical redditor, I just want to say that I think **anyone** that goes out there and is putting in the miles (or kilometers, for my non-US friends) for fitness, fun, or competitive goals I consider a brother/sister in arms. 

So ask away!

My inner thighs burn whenever they meet.

I limp and trip, and grab hand-rails.

Most 80-year-olds don't look this frail.

My hip hurts when I sit on a chair,

My toes are numb and miss their hair.

My nipples hide under athletic tape.

He pulls over at the trail head. Asks me what the plan is. I say go do errands, I'll call you when I'm ready. I haven't been able to go for a run in over a month. I'mnevercomminback. 

I don't even say goodbye as I jump out of the car into the grey wall of rain. No looking back. I take a few steps thinking I'll just walk a few hundred meters before I start running. 

Nope. 

My feet hit black pavement and they fucking *go.* 

Its pouring. I'm running. No screaming kids. No dishes. No laundry. No paperwork. None of that. The trail is empty. The trees are a little melancholy but glad to see me. They hug the trail and divert the puddles. I don't care. I run through the puddles. 

My shoes are soaked. My tights are soaked. My ponytail is heavy down my back and I'm smiling. 

And the rain rain rain came down down down. 

I'm happier than I have ever been. I'm wild and free. I'm alone and in the world. It's just me and my mistress, the miles. 

I see five consecutive steep flights of stairs leading to another trail entrance. I make them my bitch, back down, and gone again. 

Then [this song](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GSt9lK_EPUY) comes on. I'm still alone. Still pouring. Nobody anywhere. Fuck it, I start singing. Then I start singing more loudly. 

I'm screaming and sprinting. *This race is worth the run.*

This is peace. This is freedom. This is letting the clouds wash the stress and the frustration and the pain and the tears away.

1314300043.0,223,self.running,jubo2,"To Beginners, from a recently graduated beginner. ",270,47,77,http://www.reddit.com/r/running/comments/jubo2/to_beginners_from_a_recently_graduated_beginner/,"It has been 13 years of running and six marathons; I figured it would be wrong to call myself a beginner any more. So, having just graduated from the moniker, I thought I'd write down a few notes from my personal experience, in case someone new might find it amusing or slightly useful. Here goes:

**You are almost certainly running too fast**

You get the most gains training on slow runs, especially if you are trying to build endurance. In fact, by running too fast, you are sacrificing gains. Running slower will also keeps injuries down. And ""slow"" is likely slower than you think. Yes, you will need speedwork and tempo runs, but you are likely overestimating their contribution to becoming fast.

**Your injuries are likely less serious and less permanent than you think**

I lived through a good number of them. What felt like a stress-fracture was just tendonitis. What I thought was hip-bursitis was just strained groin and hip muscles. In the end, it wasn’t the x-rays that solved them - it was rest and ice and Advil. Usual caveats apply.

**Think less shoe=better**

Don’t fall for that whole over-pronation nonsense. Let your feet work like they want to, and ramp up slowly. If a shoe promises to do anything more than prevent scrapes, provide just a little cushioning and maybe, look good, steer clear. Barefooting, I hear, is awesome. I have tried it but have never given it a full-fledged shot. 

**Think 2 Years**

That’s how long it will take your body to get 80-90% of gains. It takes a while to build additional vasculature, metabolic capacity, aerobic capacity, muscle and tendon strength etc. Yes, it only takes a few weeks to get “5k ready”, but it takes longer to get the big gains. Lots of caveats - you have to train etc. 

**You will run races too fast and crash**

There isn’t another way to learn what you are capable of and how to adjust for weather, hydration etc. So, go right ahead, crash and burn. This stuff cannot be taught.

**You will run too slow and fail to make up time**

Corrollary to previous section. 

**If you commit to running a marathon, you will**

Running a marathon is more about commitment and planning than it is about innate ability, willpower, insanity or pain tolerance. You underestimate your body’s ability to adapt. It is one of the most rewarding things I have done for myself. 

**Enjoy the running**

It's the single biggest factor of whether you will be a runner for life. Keep it fun. ",,False,,t5_2qlit,True,,,True,t3_jubo2,http://www.reddit.com/r/running/comments/jubo2/to_beginners_from_a_recently_graduated_beginner/,

I knew I'd probably be taking in some extra calories over the holiday so I talked myself into it. Prior to this my farthest distance was 10 miles. It was totally unplanned and was a great example of overcoming that voice in your head that says ""Can't"". Here's how the conversation went:

Wife as I'm walking out the door: How far are you running?

Positive Me: At least 5 miles

Wife: Cool.

(After a quick stretch, I start running)

Negative me (.25 miles): Man, I'm not feeling it today. I think I'll just run 2-3 and call it a day.

Positive me: Seriously? Just for your whining, now you're running AT LEAST 8 miles.

Negative me: What? We'll see.

Positive me (.5 miles): Nope. No argument. Man up.

...(running continues)

Positive me (5 miles): Man, this feels great! Aren't you glad you didn't quit?

Negative me: Ya, I guess so. Still, this is pretty far. Want to call it a day?

Positive me: Don't you ever learn? Now we're going to run a half marathon?

Negative me: WHAT?! We've never run that far.

Positive me: Well, what would you rather be doing? Sitting on the couch, drinking, and watching Netflix? Let's do this!

...(running continues)

Negative me (11 miles): Well, this has been fun but we've been running for over an hour and a half now...and this is farther than we've ever run. Maybe call it a day?

Positive me: Ya, exactly, we've been running for over an hour and a half and only have around 20 minutes left to accomplish something we've never done before. Are you crazy?

Me: You know what, you're right. LET'S DO THIS.

TL;DR: I set out to run my normal 5 miles, didn't really feel like it, but rather than quitting 2 miles in I talked myself into running my first ever half marathon.

Was this due to the lack of calories in my body since I burned off more than I had taken in so far that day or some other cause?",,False,,t5_2qlit,False,,,True,t3_15j3l8,http://www.reddit.com/r/running/comments/15j3l8/last_friday_night_i_walked_out_my_front_door_to/,

I just need to get some thoughts off my chest and vent a little. If you don't want to read my bitching, I don't mind you clicking back in your browser.*     
   
My mindset is pretty shitty right now. I was running the Munich Marathon today, aiming for a goal of 3:15h. I was taking it careful and slow in the beginning, easing into my average pace at around km 4 (2.5 miles). Everything was great, I went through the half marathon checkpoint at 1:35:40, my legs felt fresh and the only incline on the course was already behind me. At mile 16 I started to notice stomach cramps and at mile 18 I had to stop and vomit. It was disgusting. I couldn't control the cramps and they started to get really painful. At mile 20 I had to vomit again and after the 3:30 group passed me I was pissed at myself and dropped out.  
From a health point of view it was probably the better choice, considering I'm still feeling pretty sick a couple of hours after the race. But the runner's mind tells me that I am feeble, an idiot and loser for not pushing through to the finish line.   
I drank sufficiently, both elecrolyte beverages and water, not too much to prevent my stomach from cramping, it happened anyway. I also only used a brand of carb gels that I had tested in long runs before and those didn't cause me any problems before.
I'm not asking for sympathy, I just needed a place to write down my thoughts. Right now I am somewhere between 'I'm quitting running alltogether' and 'I'm going to retry the marathon in 4 weeks.'. If you have read this, thank you for your time.    
**EDIT**: Seems I caught gastric flu. I had to get up to puke several times during the night, my temperature is raised and I have hell of a headache. Also, diarrhea. Bad timing for an illness like this.  
Thanks everyone for your motivating input. My next goal is to get better. I'm taking a few days to decide whether to attempt another marathon this year or not. If I'll do so, I'm going to start a little more careful and also going to be very careful around nutrition before and during the race. I'm still determined to destroy the 26.2 miles.

I love reading the stories about a tough stretch where people encourage each during the race. I'm happy to say I got to experience something similar this past weekend.

I had been running with a group of about 4 guys throughout the first 7 miles, none of us had known each of other prior to the race. As the race wore on, we slowly began to separate as some people picked up their pace and others slowed down. Around mile 8 two guys pulled ahead and I made it my goal to catch them again before the end of the race (they were probably 15-20 seconds ahead). Around mile 10, I finally caught one of the guys and as I was passing him, he just simply said, ""Go get the next guy."" Just when I was getting complacent, he reminded me that running is about pushing yourself as far as you can go, there's always another goal to reach. I never did catch the next guy, but that's ok because that little statement he made gave me the drive to keep pushing my limit and finish well under my goal time, which was a euphoric feeling when I crossed that finish line.

I just want runners to be educated before registering for one. Unfortunately I didn't properly research the event and now I regret it. My experience: My friends and I registered in April and were in the process of putting together some slick costumes when we were notified of a venue and date change. Right away that caused an issue as one of my friends (friend #3) wouldn't be in town for the new date, and she would have to pay a fee to transfer her registration. The day finally comes around and friend #2 goes to pick up packets. The bibs have no numbers, so there was no number attached to friend #3, so it was unnecessary for her to pay a fee to transfer the registration to friend #2's family member. Day of the event, we arrive an hour and fifteen minutes early and find about 20 people milling around waiting. There's no music. There's no anything. Just standing. Later music starts and a really annoying announcer starts talking about a costume contest, then leads everyone in a ""warm up"", which I understand happens at all the Retro Run events. Finally time for the run to begin (a little late, so it's already after 9am and the heat is rising). There's no organization here, everyone just clumps together and the run begins. There are mile markers along the path but they're wrong. My friend and I finally arrive at the first water station and find we have to stop, wait in line, and fill our cups from coolers. The water is warm and dirty. Back to the run, we come around to do the second lap and are looking for the second water station. We find it off the course. We have to stop, go off the course, wait in line again, drink our dirty water, and then return to the course. By this time the temperature is really up there and people are dehydrated (poor planning) and some are throwing up on the side of the course. One girl was vomiting just a few feet from the finish line so I started looking for a first aid station or some gatorade or something to get her. No first aid station. No gatorade or vendor sites or anything, just more warm dirty water. I searched for someone affiliated with the event to find out if there was a first aid tent hidden somewhere or maybe some cold water to get this woman. No organizers to be found, only a bad DJ and a group of teenage volunteers standing in a group talking. By this time the woman has recovered and disappeared. Ready to leave, I change out of my sweaty shirt into the Retro Run shirt. Worst. Shirt. Ever. It stretched immediately and later all the stitching came out in the wash. Back at home I emailed the organizers asking what happened, why there wasn't a first aid station. No response. Days later my friend posted a complaint to their FB page (well worded, very legit complaint) and the post was deleted. Now they're apparently moderating comments. Nearly a week later and they haven't posted the photos (one woman, who doubled as the annoying announcer, was roaming the course taking photos). Still no response to my email so I started researching and found tons of complaints that are nearly identical to my own experience. All this talk about music playing along the course, or each mile separated into eras.. none of that. Expecting a ""post-race festival"" afterwards? Nope.

What are your stories of running acts of kindness?",281,66,69,http://www.reddit.com/r/running/comments/y78mj/last_month_a_total_stranger_did_me_an_enormous/,"Last month, I was visiting a friend in a new city when I decided to go for a run on my last morning. I took a quick look at a map and roughly planned a 3 mile loop. At about the halfway mark, I was feeling pretty great, so I decided to go just a little bit further before heading back. I figured it was a city, it was on a grid system, so no harm, right?


Nope. It turns out the ""grid system"" for this city had an awful lot of curved streets and dead ends. I quickly started to feel lost, so I asked a couple people for directions ""toward campus""... not realizing that there was more than one major campus in the immediate vicinity. A couple miles later, feeling even more lost, I asked someone what time it was and realized that I had almost no time to get back to my friend's house before he had to leave for his day. Finally, I stopped a runner with a smartphone and asked for directions. She must have sensed my desperation, because she said her car was just down the block and she offered me a ride. At that point, I had no phone, no phone numbers, and no time to get back myself, so I gratefully accepted. We made it back to my friend's house just in time. It turned out I'd run almost 6 miles and still would've had 2 miles to get back to the house (assuming I knew where I was going). I thanked her profusely and she told me when she first moved to the city, the same exact thing happened to her, and someone gave her a ride back to her house. I forgot to get her name or address, but I filed it away in my head.


So today, I went for a run in my parents' very suburban town, where I'm visiting for the week. About a mile from home, I spotted a bicyclist sitting on the curb trying to fix his bike. Cars were passing by without stopping, and it was a very low pedestrian-traffic area... I'd passed by maybe a half-dozen people in the 4 miles up to that point. He'd scraped up his arm pretty badly and seemed pretty downtrodden, so I told him I'd go home and be right back with some rubbing alcohol and bandages. I went home, picked up supplies, and my mother drove me back to where I'd found him. He had started slowly wheeling his bike down the road and seemed really surprised that I actually showed up again. I helped him clean up and bandaged his arm, and we had a battle over the $20 he tried to offer me before I dropped the bill at his feet and literally ran away yelling, ""Donate it to charity!""

Ok, it's not that dramatic.  I ran out of gas on the highway yesterday and the closest gas station (a general store actually) was 2 miles away.  Not too long ago, I would have called up AAA, opened up my Netflix app, and endured, though not happily, the tauntings of my wife until rescue arrived.

Now, thanks in part to this excellent sub and some months of hard work, I had my running shoes and a change of clothes in the car, 20lbs less weight on my body, and the ability to knock out some sub-10 minute miles.

As an added bonus, I got to spend some quiet time in the countryside before enduring the tauntings of my wife for running out of gas in her car.

I pretend I'm running with a friend who despises running (I have a lot of them, but I always choose my best friend who REFUSES to run). If I just picture them running next to me, complaining about the run, or upcoming hill, I can talk them through it. 
Like up a really tough hill, if I'm tempted to stop and walk, I picture them struggling instead, and I tell them it's temporary and you'll start recovering once you reach the top.
It's like training someone else and being their coach. Basically, I just project my own complaints on an imaginary running friend and suddenly it doesn't seem so bad.

I've been running very cusually for the last couple of years, averaging around 3 runs per week,  each run about 5km. Late fall 2012 I decided that I wanted to step it up and see how much faster I could get. My goal is a sub 20 minute 5k, after that who knows.

.

I shopped around for some program to follow and settled on the Blue (Advanced) Program from the  2nd edition of ""Jack Daniels' Running Formula"". To measure my progress I decided on a full out 5k Time Trial before the start and after the completion of the program.

. 

The program is segmented into 4 parts, each of them lasting for 4 weeks. It is not tailored specifically for 5k racers but rather designed for all-round running improvement. It consists of 5 days of running each week with 2 additional optional days. I decided I would do one of the optional days and rest on saturdays. 

.

**November 2012 5k Time Trial : 24:46**

.

Desember 2012 : I spent this time ramping up my milage until I could do 40 miles/week without the  need for hospitalization. All of it easy paced running.

.

**Phase 1 (January - February)**

.

The schedule for weeks 1 - 4:

.

* Day 1 : 60 minutes Easy
* Day 2 : 10 minutes Easy + 8 x (400 meters Repetition + 400 meters Easy) + 10 minutes Easy.
* Day 3 : 60 minutes Easy (optional day, repeats day 1)
* Day 4 : 45 minutes Easy + 8 strides
* Day 5 : 15 minutes Easy + 4 x (1200 meters Interval + 4 minutes Easy) + 15 minutes Easy
* Day 6 : Rest for me ( optional repeat of day 4)
* Day 7 : 90 minutes Easy

.

I should take some time here to explain the terms used by Jack Daniels.

* Easy is a pace you can hold for a long time, you should be able to carry a conversation with a running partner without too much effort. 
* Treshold is a pace which you can hold for about an hour in a race situation. It is ""comfortably hard"".
* Intervals are hard. They should be at the pace you can hold for a couple of miles.
* Repetition pace is fast but not hard (due to more rest between workbouts). It is somewhere in between Interval pace and Sprinting.
* Strides are shorter bursts of speed at about repetition pace with full recovery between.

.

The book goes into great detail about these paces and how to find your exact values based on something he calls a VDOT value. More about this in the random ramblings at the end.

.

I did my quality workouts (Day 2 &amp; 5) on a threadmill due to the whole living-in-norway situation. It is hard to keep a consistent pace when running on varying degrees of snow and ice and beneath a ton of clothes. My easy and long runs (day 7) was all done outside.

.

I had only done relativly easy running prior to this so my first interval session was rough. This got better quickly though, at week two I felt much better and by week three I came to look forward to the intervals as they are more diverse and fun than steady pace runs.

.

I ran most day 1 workouts in the morning before breakfast, which to me was a real pain. I have no energy in the morning and but people I talked to said this would get better so I stuck to it.

.

Most of the easy runs I would go a little faster than the pace set by Daniels, just because it felt natural to do so. (NOT on my morning runs however, I would get totally spent just trying to keep an easy pace on these and it did not feel easy in any sense of the word).

.

All over I think this phase felt ok.

.

**Phase 2 (February - March)**

.

The schedule for weeks 5 - 8:

.

* Day 1 : 60 minutes Easy
* Day 2 : 15 minutes Easy + 4 x (2 x 200 meters Repetition w/ 200 meters Easy + 400 meters Repetition w/ 400 meters easy) + 15 minutes Easy
* Day 3 : 60 minutes Easy
* Day 4 : 45 minutes Easy + 8 strides
* Day 5 : 15 minutes Easy + 20 minutes Threshold + 4 strides + 15 minutes Easy
* Day 6 : Rest
* Day 7 : 90 minutes Easy

.

At the beginning of this phase I felt bloody brilliant. The threshold runs was not taxing at all and I decided it was time to increase my VDOT value (this in turn increases the designated pace for all the different workouts). After adjusting the VDOT things got a lot harder for a couple of weeks and then normalized again to what I felt was ""proper effort"".

.

I kept doing my morning runs on day 1 and every single one of them felt like shit. I started to do an additional morning run each week (most of the time day 4) in an feeble attempt to acclimatize to them but I had no such luck. At the end of this phase I decided that morning running is just not for me. Maybe I'll try again some other time. 

.

As with phase 1 I still did my quality runs on the threadmill. Some particularly nasty weather forced me to move one of the long runs to the threadmill as well.. I never realized how mindnumbingly boring 90 minutes of steady effort on a mill could be! I'll do my very best to avoid that scenario in the future.

.

Overall this phase felt great. I increased my vdot and was pretty sure progress was being made! I kept running my easy days a bit faster than presecribed by Dr Daniels. While I was sure this  affected my quality sessions negativly I just had a hard time jogging as slowly as suggested.

.

**Phase 3 (March - April)**

.

The schedule for weeks 9 - 12:

.

* Day 1 : 60 minutes Easy
* Day 2 : 15 minutes Easy + 6 strides + 6 x (400 meters Repetition w/ 400 meters Easy + 200 meters Repetition w/ 200 meters easy) + 15 minutes Easy
* Day 3 : 30 minutes Easy + 6 strides
* Day 4 : 45 minutes Easy + 8 strides
* Day 5 : 15 minutes Easy + 5 x (1000 meters Interval w/ 3 minutes Easy) + 15 minutes Easy
* Day 6 : Rest sweet rest
* Day 7 : 90 minutes Easy

.

At the start of this phase I felt pretty bad. I had plans to increase my VDOT during week 9 but I postponed it to week 11. I didnt feel particularly well when I did the increase so I made a promise to myself that I would stick to the pace on easy days (yeah right).

.

This was without doubt the hardest phase for me. My legs felt constantly sore and in the mornings when I woke up there would be actual pain assosiated with the first five minutes of walking (or trying to walk as it may be). My main problems were with the soles of my feet and the calves. 

.

Some nights I had trouble sleeping because the muscles in my feet kept ""twitching"". I could see random muscle contractions in my calves even when laying on my back resting. This was kind of weird and I felt pretty sure this was a sign that I had to do something :)

.

I had not done any stretching what-so-ever at this point and decided it might be time to start. I began a small routine which I did after each workout, as well as random times during the day if I felt bad. Little by little my feet started feeling better, although I still have occational issues. It might be because I only remember to stretch when it hurts :p

.

I started running my quality sessions outdoor on a track during this phase. Even though I had the incline on the threadmill set to 1.5% to make it about the same effort as outside I was one hundred percent floored after the first few outdoor sessions. I've been mulling this over a bit and I think I know why; when you're on a threadmill the pace is set for you and all you have to worry about is running as relaxed as possible. Outside however your pace will vary quite a bit which in itself is not was efficient as a steady pace. In addition to that you have to keep track of splits and adjust your pace when you get too fast or fall behind. All these things take some of the focus away from running as smoothly and relaxed as you can.

.

I've gradually become better both at keeping an accurate pace based on my watch and at judging my pace ""manually"". As I get better and better at this I can keep more of a focus on my actual running.

.

Overall this was a hard phase. It is designed by Daniels to be the toughest of the phases and it was probably made worse than it had to be by me moving outdoors for the first time and failing to take adequate measures when I felt my body start to protest a bit.

.

**Phase 4 (March - May)**

.

The schedule for weeks 13 - 16:

.

* Day 1 : 60 minutes Easy
* Day 2 : 15 minutes Easy + 3 x ( 1000 meters Threshold w/ 1 minute rest) + 3 x (800 meters Interval w/ 2 minutes rest) + 15 minutes Easy
* Day 3 : 30 minutes Easy
* Day 4 : 45 minutes Easy + 6 strides
* Day 5 : 15 minutes Easy + 2 x (200 meters Repetition w/ 200 meters Easy) + 3 x (1000 meters Treshold w/ 1 minute rest) + 2 x (200 meters Repetition w/ 200 meters Easy) + 15 minutes Easy
* Day 6 : Rest
* Day 7 : 90 minutes Easy

.

The final phase and a more than welcome decline in overall effort from phase 3. My legs gradually started to feel lighter and at the end of many quality days I felt like I had more energy comming out of the workout than I had going in. True to self I kept running my easy sessions too fast.

.

This was the first time since the beginning of the program where there was actual rest in between workbouts (as opposed to easy running as recovery) which felt pretty strange at first but I came to love. I feel like an actual athlete when I stand around sipping my water on the track between intervals. 

.

I decided that my end of cycle time trial would replace the long run on the very last day of the program. The last week I modified slightly to give myself some rest; I replaced day 4 with 30 minutes easy as well as day 5 with 30 minutes easy + 6 strides. On day 6 I rested as usual and on day 7 I went all out for 5000 meters.

.

For my time trial I decided to use my current Interval pace (4:30 / km) as a starting point and then see how I felt as things progressed. I felt very good during the first 3 km, so I was pretty confident that I could increase my speed effort in the last two without bombing. The splits ended up like this:

.

* 1 km : 4:27
* 2 km : 4:29
* 3 km : 4:28
* 4 km : 4:14
* 5 km : 4:05

.

*May 2013 5k Time Trial : 21:43*

.

A new PB with a margin of 3:03! Although I could probably have started out a bit faster and shaved a few seconds off, I am very happy with my result. I managed to run very evenly for the first 3 km and when I ramped up the speed I got a negative split like a pro :) I misjudged the sprint somewhat and started it too late, so I think 21:30 is my ""real limit"" for a 5k at the moment. I cannot fault myself too much for these small misses however, seeing as it is my second ever all out effort at the distance.

.

Im going to use this week to just run what I feel like as a reward for staying with a strict program for the last months. I'll probably head down to the track on my quality days and try to set some PBs for other distances, just to have a benchmark for future efforts.

.

Overall I am really happy with the program as well as my progress. While I am still quite a bit off from my goal of a sub 20 5k, I am making real progress. I also have to take into consideration that this is not a program geared towards the 5k, but rather a generalist approach to anything shorter than a marathon.

.

**Some thoughts on the book and and the program**

.

*Cadence*. Daniels talk a lot about how most elite runners take about 180 steps per minute regardless of speed, and that this is the rate to aim for. In the beginning I tried to adjust to this on my easy runs but I find it very unnatural to take that many steps when my pace is 6 minutes / km. When I run at Treshold pace and faster I find that my cadence naturally falls into the ""correct"" range, so I have concluded the following: While elites keep this cadence at all speeds, they never run as slow as I do on my easy runs. I therefor grant myself permission to run with a lower step frequency while running slow, as long as it increases along with my speed.

.

*vdot*. I simply love the vdot system, and regardless of what program I might be following next I will probably come back to this to find my designated paces for various efforts. I find it does a very good job of predicting speeds for me as well as ballpark my all out efforts at different distances. 

.

*Time, not distance*. Daniels' programs are designed around how much time you should be spending doing some effort, rather than distances (which are the norm). This makes a ton of sense to me. Consider a program asking you to do 8 miles easy. This could take you anything from 1 hour 30 minutes to 50 minutes depending on your level of fitness. In both cases the runner will run at an effort that (to himself) is easy; however the *least fit* individual will be doing it for 40 minutes longer than the *most fit*! This is totally counter to how it should be, and designating durations rather than distances fixes this issue.

.

*Heart rate monitors*. The book lacks a bit of information on how to adapt its programs to running with a heart rate monitor. Since all efforts are based on paces you pretty much need a track or some long flat area to do your quality workouts. If the HR zone for the workout was listed in addition to the pace it would be easier to ""bring the workout with you"" when you happen to find yourself somewhere with a lot of hills or heat or wind or other things that make pace a bad metric. I think the info is in there but it is scattered all over the book and takes a lot of effort to extract.

.

*Tapering*. The book gives limited information on tapering. It is certainly mentioned but it is a bit vague on how to do it in practice. I would love if it included specific tapers with each program rather than say general things about it in a random chapter. The whole of phase 4 in the Blue Program is a taper of sorts, but it is not a single-race-taper, it is more of a breather after the tough phase 3.

.

*Purpose*. The purpose of each workout is explained in great detail, which will be very helpfull to anyone new to running seriously (such as myself). I would be a hundredfold more confident in designing my own workouts now than I was prior to reading the book. I know why I need to do the different elements, how they help me get better and roughly in what proportions I need each of them.

.

*Would I recommend this book?* Yes. It has programs for pretty much anyone from a c25k graduate to someone just barely below the level where you would have your own coach. In fact many coaches at many levels around the world use adaptations of the programs and the principles in this book in their day to day coaching. While one might quibble about a detail here or there, it is generally agreed upon that the approach to running and the design of these programs are sound.

.

So.. Thats it. I have had a blast with this and I hope someone else who is looking around for a program to follow might find this helpfull. 

.

If some of the more experienced runners out there would chime in with suggestions for me on what to do next (a program to follow, a book to read, some general advice, anything!)

---------------------------

- Who?: You're looking at him.
- What?: Kettle Moraine 100 Miler.
- When?: Saturday June 1st and Sunday June 2nd, 2013.
- Where?: La Grange, WI / Kettle Moraine State Park.
- Why?: Apparently I thought 50 milers weren't terrible enough.

First things first…. I'm still trying to process all that happened this weekend. Without a doubt I'll end up leaving something out but I wanted to get everything I can remember down as soon as possible. Big thanks to all the volunteers and random strangers who made all of us runners feel like super heroes. Your words of encouragement mean the world to us out there on the course.

**INTRODUCTION:** This year i've run two 50 milers and a 50k which all were leading up to my first ever 100 miler. My ultimate buddy/crew man Kevin and I landed at the Milwaukee airport at 9:30 am on Friday morning. After carb loading on a morning beer at the airport we jumped into our rental car and headed west towards La Grange/Whitewater, WI. We spent the rest of the day relaxing, picking up my race bib and organizing nutrition / going over my race strategy. My sister who has many ultras including 100 milers under her belt would fly in on race day to help crew the later afternoon, perform surgery on my feet if necessary and pace 24 of the last 38 miles during the night while Kevin would pace 14 of the last 38 miles. 

**THE SETUP:** The way the course works is that there is a 31 mile out and back section (for a total of 62 miles) that ends at the start/finish for 100K and from there the 100 mile runners go 19 miles out and back (for a total of 38 miles) on another section of trail in the state park. This makes the race extremely difficult as 100 mile runners are allowed to drop out at the 100K mark and still earn a 100K prize.

**INTO THE DARKNESS:** The race kicked off at 6 AM on Saturday morning with both 100K and 100 mile runners taking off together. I was warned ahead of time to take it easy going out. 100 miles is a long time to run but what is deceptive about this course are the small rolling hills that litter all 100 miles. Apparently the locals call them ""silent killers"" and for good reason. These hills would come back to haunt all of us over and over again. 

So much happened in the span of 27 hours 26 minutes and 25 seconds (my finishing time) that I can't even pretend to go step by step through the race. I will however hit the highlights, the ups the downs, and all the surprises that happen over the course of 100 miles.

The big surprise on this course is how varied the different sections of trail/forest were. We ran through open marshlands/fields that were unprotected from the sun, we ran up and over ski slopes, technical rocky switchbacks like I find in Virginia, pine needle floor forests littered with trees as far as the eye could see, beautiful views on top of some of the larger climbs. Honestly it felt like I ran through 7 or 8 different trails all together which provide some great variety and kept my mind off the work at hand. The first 35 miles or so I ran with a gentleman who was turning 40 that day and tackling his first 100 miler (unfortunately I believe he dropped at the 100K mark). We did however set a nice pace (timing chip shows a 10:37 per mile pace at the 31 mile turnaround). Through the turnaround you head once again through a 8 mile or so stretch of open prairie/field/marshland with only a few unmanned water aid stations in between. A mix of not hydrating as well as I should due to the temperature being lower but the humidity still being high, not fueling correctly for the same reasons and just the despair of running through this stretch by myself was the perfect setup for my first and deepest darkest low point of the race. Coming out of the field section I immediately entered in the darkest and lowest spot ever in my life. I trudged slowly from mile 47 - 55 knowing that I was only about half way done and would be out on the course the rest of the evening, night and possible part of the morning. I thought about dropping at the 100K point (which I would imagine everyone does), I felt foolish for even being out there but I slowly started reeling everything back in knowing pain is only temporary and suffering is optional. By the 100K point I had my head back on straight, my crew had real dinner for me, I changed my clothes and we examined and bandaged up my feet.

Picking up a pacer as well as the afternoon sun setting made all the difference in the world. Kevin would pace me the first 14 miles out. He crewed me at my first ultra ever (Tussey MountainBack 50 Miler last October), he crewed me at my last 50 miler which was my 30th birthday and I ended up coming in 4th overall and now he was setting out into the night on his longest run to date, in the dark, on very technical single track trail. I'm proud to call this guy my friend and lucky I have such a great support system for these races. No one finishes these things alone: friends, family, other runners, aid station workers and random strangers send us positive vibes the entire way and without them I'm not sure if anyone would ever finish.

The night is a complete blur to me now: I do know I had hallucinations that included seeing turtles out in the middle of the trail, hearing really loud breathing noises in the woods and seeing swirling patterns on port-a-potty walls. I also grabbed a cup of Heed at mile 82 turnaround aid station sitting it on a picnic table for a second. When I picked it back up and threw the contents into my mouth I realized very quickly I had grabbed the wrong cup and ended up with red wine in my mouth which I quickly spit out. The highlights for me during the evening was the sound of peace &amp; quiet, beautiful star filled skies, cooler weather and getting to see the sun come up. Hash browns and coffee at aid stations in the last 10 miles or so were also the best pick me up (race directors take note!). 

Some overuse inflammation starting around mile 62 really slowed me down the last part of the race but never stopped me in my tracks. Slowly and surely I pushed through finally crossing the finish line in 27:26:25 good enough for 69th place out of 113 finishers. 

**THINGS I LEARNED:** 100 miles is hard. really really hard. i am completely inspired by seeing seemingly normal people out there on the course grinding it out for no other reason than to battle their own personal demons and accomplish something everyone else told them was impossible. these are the kind of people you might see in starbucks ordering coffee, shopping for groceries, etc… who you would never think were runners. these people performed super human feats of physical and mental strength and everyone who started the race gets my respect and more. i do think there is an element of luck in the races. wrong decisions build up quickly and spin out of control faster than you realize. no one who crosses that finish line is the same person who started the race. i think that will apply to every single one you make it through. i'm certainly not the same person i was before. finishing this has been similar to opening pandora's box. two days later and i'm already looking to sign up for my next.

1365901407.0,207,self.running,1cauae,Here is correct running form.,251,44,73,http://www.reddit.com/r/running/comments/1cauae/here_is_correct_running_form/,"I've had a lot of questions on running form and I've noticed that next to no one knows proper running form And why would we? Afterall, every CC coach and track coach out there is screaming ""STRIDE OUT!! REACH!!"" **NO** Not good. Not at all what you want to do. And the high heel shoes don't help either.

 **A fast turnover will always beat a longer stride.** Remember that. It hurts at first and your calves will burn but don't break form. When you're exhausted is when it counts most. I'll take any questions.


**Head Tilt** How you hold your head is key to overall posture, which determines how efficiently you run. Let your gaze guide you. Look ahead naturally, not down at your feet, and scan the horizon. This will straighten your neck and back, and bring them into alignment. Don't allow your chin to jut out.

**Shoulders** play an important role in keeping your upper body relaxed while you run, which is critical to maintaining efficient running posture. Keep them up a little and back a little. As you tire on a run, don't let them creep down and slouch. If they do, shake them out! Your shoulders also need to remain level and shouldn't dip from side to side with each stride.

**Arms** Even though running is primarily a lower-body activity, your arms aren't just along for the ride. Your hands control the tension in your upper body, while your arm swing works in conjunction with your leg stride to drive you forward. Keep your hands in an unclenched fist, with your fingers lightly touching your palms. Imagine yourself trying to carry a potato chip in each hand without crushing it. Your arms should swing mostly forward and back, not across your body, between waist and lower-chest level. Your elbows should be bent at about a 90-degree angle. When you feel your fists clenching or your forearms tensing, drop your arms to your sides and shake them out for a few seconds to release the tension.

**Torso** The position of your torso while running is affected by the position of your head and shoulders. With your head up and looking ahead and your shoulders in the correct position, your torso and back naturally straighten to allow you to run in an efficient, upright position that promotes optimal lung capacity and stride length. Many track coaches describe this ideal torso position as ""running tall"" and it means you need to stretch yourself up to your full height with your back comfortably straight. If you start to slouch during a run take a deep breath and feel yourself naturally straighten. As you exhale simply maintain that upright position.

**Hips** Your hips are your center of gravity, so they're key to good running posture. The proper position of your torso while running helps to ensure your hips will also be in the ideal position. With your torso and back comfortably upright and straight, your hips naturally fall into proper alignment--pointing you straight ahead. If you allow your torso to hunch over or lean too far forward during a run, your pelvis will tilt forward as well, which can put pressure on your lower back and throw the rest of your lower body out of alignment. 

**Legs/Stride** While sprinters need to lift their knees high to achieve maximum leg power, distance runners don't need such an exaggerated knee lift--it's simply too hard to sustain for any length of time. Instead, efficient endurance running requires just a slight knee lift, a quick leg turnover, and a short stride. During workouts though, exaggerating knee drive will greatly strengthen stride and endurance. Together, these will facilitate fluid forward movement instead of diverting (and wasting) energy. When running with the proper stride length, your feet should land directly underneath your body. As your foot strikes the ground, your knee should be slightly flexed so that it can bend naturally on impact. If your lower leg (below the knee) extends out in front of your body, your stride is too long. Your foot should land directly underneath your hip.

**Ankles/Feet** To run well, you need to push off the ground with maximum force. With each step, your foot should hit the ground lightly—landing the “balls” of your feet. Keep your ankle flexed as your foot rolls forward to create more force for push-off. As you roll onto your toes, try to spring off the ground. You should feel your calf muscles propelling you forward on each step. Your feet should not slap loudly as they hit the ground. Good running is springy and quiet.

Long story short I go in a motorcycle accident in September (got cut off at an intersection doing ~40 mph). Broke my Tibula,fibula, foot, toe, collar bone. Got a metal plate put in along with ~60 stitches.

Had to relearn how to walk in November &amp; December and slowly started exercising again.

**Fast Forward to today:**

Because of summer classes and work I havent been able to run as much, though today I decided to go to the track. 

I did a mile warmup  and then proceeded to do a timed mile. With how I was feeling I was expecting an 8:00+ mile. I surprised myself when I clocked it at 6:46.  Afterwards I did a quarter mile barefoot at a very slow pace.

It kind of fueled me to to start running more. I already signed up for a 5k race at the end of August. I would be extremely content if i manage to do a sub 20. I'm excited to get back out there again!

1367886720.0,204,self.running,1dtvjv,"Last weekend, instead of running a race, I photographed one. Now I know why race photos aren't great and are priced the way they are!!",242,38,68,http://www.reddit.com/r/running/comments/1dtvjv/last_weekend_instead_of_running_a_race_i/,"My wife ran a 25mi trail race this past weekend. Being injured, I decided to sit this one out. I still wanted to be out there to support her as well as all of my other friends running, so I decided I'd take advantage of this opportunity and endulge in my other hobby besides running. Photography.  
  
  
I'm an amatuer photographer and I haven't been doing it too long. I'm okay and do produce income on the side from photography, but it's certainly not my main source of income.  


**Summary:**   

The race had a 6:30 AM start and had a 25mi or 50mi option. On trails. (a 25mi loop). I figured I'd get some pics of the start, then I'd then hop in the car and head up to where the first climb is before it heads into the single track woods as it has a great view and I'd be able to get there via car, before the runners got there. Then, I figured I'd hang out at the start/finish and maybe hike up a bit and take some photos a bit before the finish, on the trail. This way, I'd be able to get my 50miler friends coming in, then back out again. (after they finished the 25mi loop, they turned around and ran it backward) 

All in all I got some GREAT photos of my wife and friends. As practice, and because I was there, I also shot most of the other runners as well. However, it very quickly dawned on me how people take for granted race photographers. Myself included!   
 
I'll never again complain how race photos are priced, nor about the quality. It's very hard, long, and pricey work.    


**First**, my equipment. For the photographers out there, I shot with a pretty standard semi-pro body camera. A Nikon D800 (~$3000) and a Nikon D300 (~$1500). My lenses were a 24-70/2.8 (~$2000) and an 18-200 (~$1500). Why two cameras? Well, mainly to cover the focal lengths. I needed the 18-200 to get shots from farther away and I needed the 24-70 to get good depth of field shots close-up. Ideally, I could have shot the entire race with just the D800 and a 70-200, but I don't own a 70-200 (yet). This just covers the camera and lens. It doesn't include my pack, straps, batteries, memory cards, laptop, equipment insurance, gas to get there, etc..        
   
What's the point of listing all of that crap? Not sure, but a photographer likely couldn't do a good job without a comparible kit. The price of entry for someone doing this professionally, to produce quality photos, is pretty costly when it comes to equipment.       

  
**Second**, the schedule. Going crazy trying to beat the runners, finding a good spot to take photos, battling which way the sun is shining (of course, it's ALWAYS shining the wrong way!), etc. was very stressful! I imagine you get a better with experience, but it's not easy to find a good spot to shoot. In addition, you have to run from place to place where it's feasible. Get there an hour earlier to prepare, etc...

**Third,** The overall yime. After I shot all of the runners at mile 3, I went to ~24 and starteted hiking around to find ""the perfect spot"", given my experience with the stress of finding the first spot. I was relieved that the first runner wouldn't be through for ~2.5hrs. Finding this spot was TOUGH. The course just didn't favor the sun at all. But, I finally found a spot. Then had to wait a bit for the first runner to come through. I took some shots of all the front runners, crouched down, etc. Runners came in 1 by 1 or in groups…for the next. 5. hours. Of COURSE you know after the first few guys came through, the sun changed, right? I finally spot my wife again and (ironically) hers were the worst shots of the day as she was bunched with a lot of runners. Did I mention I wasn't prepared with food/water? silly mistake.   

  
After my wife passed I went to head down to the finish line to congratualte her, then camp out at the finish to wait for the 50 miler finishers and such. All in All I shot for about 9 hours.     


  
**Lastly**, I took ~2000 frames and ~64gigs of photos. And, unfortunately, that only included about 60% of the runners!! Some, I had simply missed, or came in after my wife, etc…   
  
Then, I got home. I was excited as I knew I had some fantastic shots. Then, it dawned on me. Shit. I have 2000+ photos to go through! I have 64 gigs of space I need to free up!   
   
  
and then, HOLY SHIT DO YOU KNOW HOW LONG ITS GOING TO TAKE TO PROCESS 2000+ PHOTOS!?!?!?    


Now, I quickly deleted 500 that were missed focus, shots that went off of my foot, photos of 'false runners' (runners without bibs who weren't in the race). Then, I took a deep breath and marked the ones of my wife to process. About 20 photos…~5 were what ""I"" consider keepers. Then, I edited them. Now, I really don't photoshop my photos. In fact, I didn't even touch photoshop. Just BASIC color/white balance correction in Lightroom, since I shoot RAW, and cropping. It still took me about an hour to just edit hers! Then, I started going through my friends. All in all I spent at least another 8 hours processing my friends for a total of about 100 photos!!  At this point I gave up all hope on ever bothering with the other people. I'll keep them on my disk in case a friend of a friend ran and wants photos, but, aint nobody got time to process 2000 photos!! The only way to do so is to sacrifice quality and just mass color correct and don't crop anything….and ""hope"" you got some good shots. I suppose this is why a lot of people complain about quality.       

  
Some takeaways and some rudementary and lowball number crunching:  

* You get one shot. The runner runs by, and you can't ask him/her to do it again. If you miss it…you miss it. That's a lot of pressure, and I don't care how experienced you are, you're going to miss a shot. You're going to miss a focus. You're going to forget you weren't on continous focus, you're going to have to take a piss.   
* Unless you really spend the time planning, finding good vantage points to shoot at that are A.) Accessible, B.) Have good light (that doesn't change!), is going to be tough. At this point, you're sometimes 'just working with what you have' . 
* The equipment needed to do it right, is expensive. Ideally? Do really do it right. I'd have rented/owned a 70-200 2.8 on one body, and then maybe a 200-400 on another! Right there you're at about ~15k.   
* You have to invest a lot of time. Let's break it down. Driving to the race, prepping before the race, the race, The finish, The awards, the drive home. Remember, you have to shoot everyone right? When does that last person finish?! Let's use a half-marathon for example since that's a pretty common race distance. Let's say the last person finishes in what…3.5 hrs? So, say it takes 30 minutes to get there. That's .5+1+3.5+.5+.5 at MINIMUM. 6 hours.    
* Then, there is the processing. Let's say you're a really good shot, and don't just spray and pray. You have ~2000 photos. Just importing them could take an hour. Then there is hard drive space. Then there is a fast computer to process. Then there is processing software. All in all, at MINIMUM. There is NO way unless you're completely just posting ""shit"" unprocessed photos, that would take 4-6 hours. We're at 12 hours of work. Then there is hosting fees, etc.   
*  How much is your time worth? Let's ballpark at $20 an hour. Let's just assume that this photographer (me) deserves $20hr (even though the expertise and effort it takes, I believe deserves more). At 12 hours of total work. That's $240. That's just your break-even for 'time worked'   
* Let's calculate your equipment. Without getting into symantecs, let's lowball (EXTREMELY, by, like a lot) and calculate $15k/yr. This covers gear, insurance, gas, car maintance, memory cards, computer (yes, I am even taking into consideration that you have some things for many years) etc.. that's about 41$ a day. That is if you could work EVERY day. But, we know that's not true. Why? Well, races are only on weekends, there is a limited amount. Also, Holidays, etc. So, let's say…you can realistically ""Work"" 100 days a year. That's every Saturday and Sunday, plus editing/processing on Monday and Tuesday (doesn't leave much time for the day job!) That means that you have to earn 150$ per event, just to cover equipment costs.    

  
- Already, with the time + equipment, for each event we're at $390. You'd have to earn $390 per event, in selling your photos, JUST to make 20$ an hour for your ""time worked"". That doesn't include continous learning, research, networking, marketing costs, ughhhhhhh       

  
(that make sense? My head is starting to hurt doing the basic maths)   

 
- That doesn't include *SO* so many missed costs like web hosting, etc…   


**Conclusion: TL:DR** 

- **The reason race photographers photos sometimes aren't ""super awesome"" is because it's hard to make 2000 ""super awesome"" photos without spending a lot of time. And, **it's just not financially worth it, no matter how many photos they sell and no matter how expensive or cheap they make them.** 

- **The reason race photographs are expensive, is because it IS expensive.**

To all you race photographers, keep on keepin' on. I don't envy you. I'd love to hear some tips. Next time (doubt there will be a next time!) I certainly won't shoot RAW and will shoot lower quality JPEG. ",,False,,t5_2qlit,False,,,True,t3_1dtvjv,http://www.reddit.com/r/running/comments/1dtvjv/last_weekend_instead_of_running_a_race_i/,

Today marks my 100th consecutive day of running. I had a baby in January and the day my doc cleared me for exercise, I took off! I had made this a goal in 2010 and the longest streak I managed then was 6 days. I usually ran on the treadmill as I had the baby and toddler, but on days my husband was home I took the dogs out for a 3.35 mile loop around the neighborhood. I did an interval program on the treadmill, trying to increase my speed and burn more calories, but ran the entire outside loop. I logged 465.6 miles during this time, and will continue as my second goal this year is to reach 1000 miles!

I'm glad I made a goal that didn't revolve around the number on the scale, because hitting a plateau would have ruined me. For 4 weeks my weight shifted by .2-.6lbs, before I finally adjusted my diet to get it moving again. I also didn't let anything stop me from running, starting with a severe headcold in the second week that made it impossible to breathe out of my nose, to a disgusting stomach virus a little over halfway (diarrhea and running = bad idea), to a swollen cankle after a softball injury at day 94.

I woke up someone skeptical and not excited about running for 2.5 hours; it seemed like a chore. But, as I ventured out of the city and towards the farm fields, I found myself noticing something: running is magical.  I began to forget that I was running. I'd never had the experience of getting lost in my thoughts and then 5 minutes later realizing that I was running down the road.  It's a strange feeling! I started to listen to my body and adjust accordingly, rather than focusing on the dread of every step. As each mile ticked off, I realized how powerful running can be.  5 miles in, I had forgotten my worries and problems of the day, and I found myself at peace. What once seemed like an arduous chore, was becoming the highlight of a week. I was discovering new areas of a town I was growing bored of. I even had a nice encounter with some angry farm dogs. I said hello to them, and went on my merry way.

It seems as if after 14 weeks of marathon training, I was getting bored. I was getting tired of lacing up my shoes and running.  But today, after 19 miles of monster hills, a huge bonk, and 70% humidity, I am back to being excited about training! I have rediscovered the magic of running today. And, runnit, I just wanted to say that I hope you all stick with your training, even if you're getting bored. Running is awesome. Its almost indescribable. This may seem basic but, to all you runners out there, keep goin; running may have a surprise up it's sleeve for ya!

Did any of you have this experience recently? 

TL ; DR : After a long run, I rediscovered how super legit/life changing running is. ",,False,,t5_2qlit,False,,,True,t3_1k62dh,http://www.reddit.com/r/running/comments/1k62dh/rediscovering_the_magic_of_the_long_run/,

It has completely changed my outlook on running and life.

-Bodyglide, vasoline, whatever you choose use it, you do not want to be walking around like you have a hedgehog stuffed in your trousers
-Injuries, treat them like you would treat a wounded animal, look after them, nourish them, and ensure they get better
-Nutrition, eat right damnit!! Going on a run after a couple of doritos locos tacos will ruin your shorts and the trail you run. It will also not help at mile 18 when you are contemplating death or taking a nap on the side of the road
-Hydration, drink some water, then drink more, and a little bit more water until everyone hates you for going to the bathroom every second or until your pee looks like it can recycled to fill up water bottles for nestle(which they probably already use this method to reduce costs)
-Dedication, you have to commit to your training, make no excuses and just do it.  If you can find time to fap twice a day you can find time to run
-Do not over think your long runs, they are just like any other run but way more badass because it is cool saying you ran 20 miles and you get to eat during them
-Stretch, shit feels nice

Funny what turning 40 will make you do. I'm still not sure why, but one day in early Dec I bought a good pair of shoes and took my first 'run'. Day one, I could run for about 30 seconds before breaking into a walk, but kept at it, going for a 'run' every other day. These were mostly walks, with shuffling 'sort of running' in between.

I kept at it, reading links here, geeking out on form videos on youtube, chi running, foam rolling, core strengthening and pigeon posing. My goal was to do a 5k race within 3 months of starting out.. but, no 5ks. sold out. Knowing it was a stretch, I booked for a local 10k race.

This morning I ran a hilly 10k in 1:14 and have almost no pain other than some tender knees and stiff lower back. I only trained up to 6k, but the adrenaline of running in a 'pack' carried me through. 

It wasn't very pretty. I ended up passing on a ride home from a friend I met up with at the finish point because I was so sweaty and I pissed myself (slightly) after while walking to the porta potty. I didn't realize it was happening and couldn't stop it if my life depended on it. No matter..I poured a bottle of water over my stomach/crotch and took a cab back home. 

This is the first time in my life I've set a physical goal and met it. I've got flat feet, pronation, my right leg is shorter than the left and I've never ran before in my adult life. But, [I did it](http://i.imgur.com/McPTNoB). Some advice to anyone starting out. 

- Get a 'hard' foam roller and look on youtube for how to use it.
- Learn some runner's yoga.
- Have someone that knows sports medicine watch you run and do the exercises they instruct you to do.
- Strengthen your inner and outer thighs (squeeze ball, resistance bands, surfer squats).
- Run by yourself at first, go at your own pace and avoid injury.
- As soon as you are ready, learn to run hills. 
- Don't give up on yourself, ever.
- Bring a plastic bag to sit on if you've got to take a taxi home after pissing yourself.

Sub 3. 29.5mpw,234,41,65,http://www.reddit.com/r/running/comments/uwosl/my_debut_marathon_sub_3_295mpw/,"I feel that the training is very much a part of the marathon experience so I’ll be detailing both my training and my actual race in separate sections below.

**Training**

As of last fall I had been running for two years and done a number of 5ks and one half marathon.  For whatever reason I decided it was time to up my game and run a full marathon.  At that point I was running 15-20 miles a week.  I clocked in at 18:33 in the 5k and 1:30 in the HM.  After two months of not picking out a race, I decided I’d just start training and figure out the race later.  So began the world’s longest marathon training program.

All told my marathon prep took 7 months (vs the usual 4).  Initially my goal was just to finish a marathon and not poop myself.  However, as I trained and got faster, my goals became loftier and loftier.  
For the first 5 months I took my usual program:

* 1 fartlek:  4-7 miles at whatever sorts of paces appealed to me that day.  Usually pretty quick.
* 1 track workout: 2-3 miles Intervals.  200's in 0:34, 400's 1:14, 800's: 2:36, 1000's 3:22. 180-197 bpm. Equal length cool-down jogs.
* 1 tempo at 6:00 - 6:30 pace. 180-185bpm.
* Sometimes drop intervals/temp and do 3-4 miles very close to 5k race pace.  I would try to do strides or play soccer those weeks. 185-190bpm.
* Tried to avoid all easy runs.  Sometimes my girlfriend (28min 5k’er) would want to run with me, so  I’d tack on a tempo at the end or do some out/back intervals during the run so I could keep the intensity up and run with her most the time.

And simply added a 90-120 minute long run every weekend. I did the long runs at a pretty zesty pace: 7:00-7:30/mile.  165-175bpm. All told this was about 25 miles a week.

The long runs pretty quickly gave dividends.  I dropped 3 minutes off my HM after 3 months and 50 seconds off my 5k after 4 months. 

After 5 months I finally picked my race.  I decided I was going to do the [North Olympic Discovery Marathon](http://www.nodm.com/) 2 months from then.  I also decided it would be feasible to do it in less than 3 hours.  To facilitate this newer, more specific goal, I altered my weekly plan

* Dropped the fartlek.
* Added Race pace short runs.  4-8 miles at race pace. 175-180 bpm.
* Lengthened Long runs 10-15 minutes.

Additionally, I stopped eating junk food and snacking in order to lose a few pounds and give myself an edge.  I ended up losing about 5lbs in 6-7 weeks (142 down to 137)

1 month out from the race (6 months into my program) I decided to do a half marathon to test the feasibility of my goal pace.  I decided if I could do a half in under 1:25, I could do the full in under 3:00.  I came in at 1:23 and was feeling pretty good about my prospects.

I didn’t make any more changes to my program until 1 week out.  Given my already low volume I didn’t feel the need to taper miles.  Instead, I lowered my intensity a bit and did some extra pace testing:

* Dropped my usual intervals/tempo runs
* Instead did 8 miles at race pace on track and two easy 4 milers.
* Was going to do some strides + moderate mile day before, but weather was shitty and my knee hurt so I didn't.
Additionally, I ate a ton of carbs (mostly pasta) in the 3 days preceding the race.

During the course of my training I averaged 29.5 miles per week.  Towards the end most weeks were in the 30-34 range, though none were over 35 (not counting the marathon itself).

**The Great Race**

The day before the race I had a fair amount of trepidation.  My left knee hurt, it was raining buckets and I had the trots.  Fortunately, it all cleared up on race day.  The weather was great:  Cloudy, 56 degrees, no rain, and a 5mph tailwind for most the race.  My knee and bowels also calmed down.

My goal was to average 6:50/mi for the race.  Since were some hills towards the end of the race I decided I’d bank some time earlier in the race so I could take them at an appropriate pace.   Accordingly, I aimed stay between 6:40 and 6:50/mi for the first 18 or so.

There were a couple people who started at wildly inappropriate paces and dropped off in the first 1-3 miles and by mile 4 race order mostly decided.  I was right behind some dude named Dave (henceforth my BFF Dave) who was also shooting for sub 3.   I stuck behind him and just took in the sights for the next 12 miles.  

[Here I am trying to look ridiculously photogenic at mile 4](http://i.imgur.com/NJB3P.jpg)

The race was well supported and had aid stations every 3 miles or so.  Most of the aid stations had cool themes.  The coolest one, IMO, was either one where everybody dressed as characters from Mad Men or one with a tribal drum session going on. 

In addition to the cool aid stations, I got support from my family.  They followed along as I went.  I was able to see them at the start, miles 4 and 12, and the finish.  My dad let me know how far back from the lead I was.  (In years past this was a smaller race and I figured I had a small chance of winning it.  The guy who won was cruising along at about 6:10 though, so I quickly gave up on aspirations of winning.)  It was really nice to have them cheering for me since there were very few spectators anywhere but the aid stations and finish line.

[Here I am enjoying a gel at mile 13](http://i.imgur.com/TL1uy.jpg)  (My BFF dave in the front.)  I ate gels at 7.5 (0:50), 12.5 (1:23), 18.5 (2:04).  I think one more might have helped.

I reached the half way mark in 1:27:47 (6:42/mi).  The first 18 didn't give me any trouble.  Each mile was between 6:35 and 6:56.  

At mile 19 I hit the hills I was worried about and my pace went to shit.  19 through 21 clocked in at 7:17, 7:06, and 7:24 respectively.  To make matters worse, my BFF Dave left me in the dust.  I knew I had some extra time for this exact issue, but was starting to worry about making my goal.  I also began to understand why people say the half way mark of a marathon is at mile 20.

Fortunately at the end of mile 21 I was saved.  There was a moderate downhill with spectators blasting “Eye of the Tiger” I was able to get my foot speed back up and totally reset.  The next three miles I averaged 6:53 and was able to catch / pass my BFF Dave.  At this point I was blowing by the tail end of the half marathoners.  A lot of them were walking in groups and clogging up the fairly narrow trail.  At the time I was pretty annoyed that I had to yell at them to make way, however in retrospect I think passing them made me run faster.

I was feeling ok until right around mile 24.  My hamstrings and calves starting killing me.  I tried to inspire myself by noting I only had a 5k left and had 22 minutes to do it, but it didn’t make it easier.  To add insult to injury, a poorly dressed older fellow breezed by me at mile 25 and I couldn’t do anything about it.  I kept pushing harder and harder, but my pace just wouldn’t drop below 7:10.   I ended up averaging 7:15 for those two miles.  

It wasn’t until I was within sight of the finish that my legs finally relented and obeyed my demands to go faster.  About 1/3 mile out I was able to drop down to a 6:07 pace for a [finishing kick](http://i.imgur.com/bFvAe.jpg).  It felt good to look strong at the end even if I didn’t feel it.  After I stopped running, I discovered I was pretty terrible at walking, so I decided to go have a little lay down. [Laying down never felt so good](http://i.imgur.com/Lygft.jpg)

My girlfriend ran her first half that day.  [Here we are a few minutes later with our medals](http://i.imgur.com/TtxOQ.jpg)

**Results**

[My finish time and medal](http://i.imgur.com/Q3zv2.jpg).
My official time was 2:59:36 (Interestingly, the exact same time as Lance Armstrong’s first marathon… only I didn’t a couple Olympic runners pacing me =p ).  The first half was 1:27:47 and the second was 1:31:29 for an average pace of 6:51 / mile.  I was 5th out of 320 overall and 1st out of 32 in my age group.

THEY RUN AND THEY RUN...
This is the season of the lonely sport.

It is called cross country.

The glory and the glamour are on the gridiron. The guts are out on the course where the cross country meets are run.

Football players perform in front of thousands of frenzied, shrieking fans in plush stadiums. Their rib-rattling efforts are cheered on by long-legged, short-skirted cheerleaders. They are outfitted with the best equipment plastic, rubber, and jersey can provide.

Their every hangnail is ministered to by a battery of trainers, physicians, and surgeons. Sports writers give them flashy names like ""Tank"" and ""Animal"" and ""Roadrunner"", and pour out reams of purple prose, quoting faithfully every belch and grunt, while radio and TV casters describe their every move in breathless decibels.

The football player gets the stats and the ink and the homecoming queen.

The cross country runner gets leg cramps, seared lungs, and the dry heaves.

Most cross country meets are about as well attended as a refrigerator auction in Siberia, or the commission of an act of hari-kari.

Cross country runners have no equipment problems. They put on shorts, maybe a t-shirt, and some shoes. If you're really sporty, you wear a headband to keep the sweat out of your eyes.

Football players hear the swelling crescendo of 70,000 voices screaming to score. Cross Country runners hear their own rasping breathing, the pounding of their blood in their head, the crunching rhythm of their own footsteps . . . and a little voice whispering taunts, asking maddening questions: ""Only three more miles, spaghetti legs, only three more miles . . . will you make it? Or are you gonna quit? Come on, lie to your legs some more; tell them just one more hill then you'll sit down and rest.""

They call it the loneliness of the long distance runner. It is an apt phrase. For the runner has only one other companion in each race . . . his name is pain.

They draw elaborate patterns of X's and O's in football, they send out scouts, they use computers, and they draw up game plans more complex and involved then the D-Day invasion of the beaches at Normandy.

But the strategy in cross country is simple and brutal. You go out and run and you run until you think you simply cannot take one more step, you run until it feels like your head is a hornets' nest with its own population explosion and your lungs are on fire and your heart is a beating jackhammer fast and your stomach is churning with nausea and your legs weigh 400 pounds apiece and you're wondering seriously about your own sanity, wondering why the name of exhaustion you ever answered the starter's gun . . . well, you run until all of this happens . . . and then you run some more.

Cross country runners perform in no plush stadium. Their course may be laid out over a golf course. Or through a park. Or over plowed fields. Up the hill, down the hill, across the creek, through the trees, around the briar patch, watch out for (ouch!) rocks.

They have no marching bands, no flash card sections. Their cheerleaders are the birds and the squirrels, which, startled but curious, watch in head-tilted puzzlement as this strange creature, which walks upright, goes galloping on in his underwear.

Those who coach the lonely sport will tell you a cross country runner needs: (a) endurance, (b) mental discipline, (c) a high threshold of pain.

And a cross country runner himself/herself may find it difficult to tell you why he runs, just as the mountain climber may find it difficult to tell you why he scales the summit. Or tries.

But one put it this way: ""Finishing first is a great feeling, sure. There is nothing like being first through the chute. But I'd still run even if I finished dead last every time.

""I guess it's because you get to know yourself . . . the hard way. You run and you get tired and you push yourself and you get a second wind and a third and then you're just going on guts, and when it's really tough, when you feel like you've had the crap kicked out of you, why it's like you're not part of your body anymore, it's like your up above watching yourself . . . it's almost like everything's stripped away clear down to your soul, and it's all there for you to see"".

It could be tight calves, poor running form, over-pronation, weak hips, or even a combination of all of these.  Getting rid of them - especially the extreme cases - is going to take time, self-discipline, and let's face it, some money.  

For starters, don't give yourself a self-diagnosis.  If this has been a reoccurring problem that won't seem to go away, see a doctor or physician and make sure it isn't something like a stress fracture (not fun), bruised bone, compartment syndrome, or tibial tendonitis.  

If you've been suffering from shin splints for a while now, I'm sure you know a decent amount about the causes and effects that come along with it.  To review some of this information, [read here](http://sportsmedicine.about.com/cs/leg_injuries/a/leg2.htm).

-------------------------------------------------------------------

There are several things out there that you can buy to make a tremendous difference when it comes to healing shin splints:

* **New shoes -** This should be a given.  Go to a running store and have someone fit you a pair of shoes (foot mapping, stride test, etc.) Start with [this](http://www.roadrunnersports.com/rrs/content/popup.jsp?contentId=200092), this way you'll have an idea of what shoe category you'll need.  While I'm not going to go into the whole minimalist vs traditional support debate, it is something I'd recommend looking into.

* **Compression socks -** I love these things.  I bought SKINS compression socks and I can't imagine running without them.  It may just be a placebo effect, but these things feel absolutely amazing on my legs and help reduce tightness in my calves.  

* **""The Stick"" -** The toothbrush for muscles.  There are a few different versions you can buy.  An old high school track coach ended up giving me one of his, so I ended up with [this one](http://www.amazon.com/The-Stick-G-1750-Travel/dp/B002HJ59MG/ref=sr_1_9?s=sporting-goods&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1344959021&amp;sr=1-9&amp;keywords=the+stick).  This thing is great for a deep tissue massage on your calves.  You get what you put into it, really.  For best results, lay flat and have a family member, running partner, or your significant other torture the shit out of you with this thing.

* **Foam roller -** Another fabulous tool for deep tissue massage.  I like this better than the stick simply because I think it's easier to use and to me, it feels better.  I use both the stick and the foam roller, but either will do.  Buy a high density firm one, like [this](http://www.amazon.com/Black-High-Density-Foam-Rollers/dp/B0040NJOA0/ref=sr_1_1?s=sporting-goods&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1344964138&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=foam+roller).

* **Calcium and Magnesium dietary supplements -** Calcium is essential for building strong bones and magnesium is involved in the function of your nerves and muscles.  Getting your daily value of the two is very important.  A bottle of these is pretty inexpensive.

* **Inserts -** Going with custom fit orthodic inserts is your best bet.  I'm not sure how I feel about inserts, I really just think you should find a nice pair of fitted shoes.  Some people have claimed that inserts did the trick though.



**Now, for my routine:** Do this before and after you run.

* To warm up, I sit in a chair and lift my legs so my feet are a few inches above the ground.  I tap my toes up and down for a couple minutes.
* I then do [this exercise](http://gizmodo.com/5902699/banish-shin-splints-forever-with-one-magical-exercise).  Also, between each set I lay on my back, stick my feet up in the air, and write the alphabet with my toes.
* Next is the towel grab.  Lay a small to medium sized towel on the floor in front of you.  While seated, keep your heel planted and grab and pull the towel towards you by using your toes.  Repeat this 3x for each foot.
* After that, get a bunch of marbles or tiny pieces of rolled up paper (this is what I use).  Any small object will do.  Scatter the pieces on the floor and set a cup on the ground nearby.  Grab the items with your toes and place them into the cup.  I also keep my heel planted as much as possible for this exercise to limit the movement in my leg.  The more you use your feet, the better you'll be working your shins.
* Toe walks throughout my house.
* This is where I break out the massage stick and foam roller.  Give your calves a deep tissue massage.  If you don't own one of these, use your hands to the best of your ability.  It can be extremely painful, but in a good way.  
* Calf stretches.  I do [this one](http://www.racewalk.com/Stretching/TraditionalCalfStretch.jpg) and [this one](http://www.racewalk.com/Stretching/IntensiveCalfStretch.jpg).  3x on each side, 20 seconds each.


**Heating::**
Use a heating pad or dip your legs in really hot water for 5-10 minutes and massage lightly before going on a run.  This will help relax the muscles and increase blood flow.

**Icing:**
You also need to be icing at least 2x a day.  Fill a solo cup with water and let it freeze completely.  Wear a glove and let the ice melt by rubbing it all over your legs.  This was easily the worst part for me.  I did about 10 minutes on each leg.  And instead of taking one of those dreadful ice baths after my runs, I simply put my legs in a huge bucket of ice.

[**Interesting information about how you should kick the habit of icing.**](http://www.mobilitywod.com/2012/08/people-weve-got-to-stop-icing-we-were-wrong-sooo-wrong.html)  This was actually pointed out in the comments.  I was completely oblivious and had no idea.  Check it out yourself and take what you will from it. 

**Running Form:**
Watch this video: www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSIDRHUWlVo.  Chances are you probably don't have perfect running form and could make some adjustments.  The efficiency gained from adapting to an improved form will reduce injuries and make you faster than ever.  Fundamentals are everything.

**Change your surface!:**
I used to run exclusively on the treadmill.  My personal trainer would constantly tell me to stay off of the thing, saying that it was terrible for my joints.  I always figured that there was no possible way a treadmill could put more stress on my muscles and joints than running on concrete would, but I guess I was wrong.  Believe it or not, ever since I stopped running on the treadmill and switched to concrete, my shin splints have gotten much better.  Coincidence?  Who knows.  Switch it up and see what happens.

**When you start running again:**
Please, please, please start slow and take a few weeks to work your way back up.  This is the most crucial part to returning from *any* injury.  I have read this advice a million times and would never take it very seriously.  My first day back I would always try running at least 2 miles.  Don't be stubborn like me.  For someone who was running 20+ MPW, dropping back down to just a few miles has been awful, but it really is necessary to start off this light if shin splints are a reoccurring problem for you.  And when you start running again, continue with these stretches and exercises!  Treat your legs like the shin splints never left.  Don't get lazy and let them come back, stop the problem before it starts!  This will ensure that they'll be gone for a long, long time.  Hopefully forever.

Well, there you have it.  I hope this guide can be a helpful resource in your quest to conquering those awful shin splints of yours.  Good luck! :)

**Edit1** - Formatting, typos, and added some information about returning from an injury.

**Edit2** - A lot of this stuff is subjective, I suppose.  Take it as you will, I'm just sharing several methods that people have had success with, including myself.  Some have claimed that inserts healed their problem over night, others just needed a pair of compression socks.  Personally, I think it comes down to footwear + running form.  Basically, think of this as a compilation of available options, not a list of essential tips and tricks that *must* be followed.

I have hated running my whole life (25 F) and stayed active through sports until after high school. I got into running in February this year and no matter how busy I get (full time employee and full-time grad student) I still find time for it and aim for 10 miles a week. My pace went from like 9:30 a mile to now under 8:20, and sometimes around 7! I finally invested in some shoes and cold weather gear so I don't fall off. Just a special thanks to you guys, kept me motivated. My record is 5 miles at  8:40 a mile and I am pushing for 6 in the next few weeks. Keep on kicking ass guys! Can't believe I actually crave a run these days... Polar opposite of a year ago. Thanks!

When I think of running, I think of escape.  I think of being a child again.  I imaging the whole world as a new place, ripe for discovery and fun.  I run to get away from deadlines, from work, and responsibility.  I run to take away stress and to feel ALIVE!  To feel the air in my lungs, and the ground on my feet.  I run because it makes me feel STRONG and invigorated.  I try to remember being a child and the way I saw the world, and suddenly benches become hurdles to jump, stairs become mountains to conquer, and rocks turn into a balancing act high above the imaginary ground below.  

Quite often on long runs I'll imagine myself turning the Earth under my feet.  Instead of running I am now examining the world around me.  Turning the Earth this way and that to see what's behind that building, or what's on the other side of that hill.  Suddenly running becomes more than just exercise or a personal goal to accomplish, it becomes a way to discover new places and find new things I wouldn't have found otherwise.  It essentially turns each of my runs into an ADVENTURE!

This is how I let go and unwind.  I run all for the fun of it, and to me, running for speed or time would defeat the whole purpose.  It would add a sense of grown-up-ness to what I see as my connection to a simpler time in life.  It would make the adventure just another task to accomplish.  

I love the running community on here, and as a whole in general, and I'm not trying to say setting goals to accomplish is a bad thing.  Instead I'm just trying to remind everyone to let your imaginations loose and take an adventure every now and then.

I am going to define the Long Run as:

 25-30% of mileage but not to exceed 2.25-2.5 hours total running time. 

The long runs for different average weekly mileages:

*30 mpw— 10 miles 
   
*40 mpw— 10-12 miles

*50 mpw— 12-15 miles

*60 mpw— 15-18 miles

**What about the 20 milers?**
I can think of only two good reasons to run a 20 Miler, and one very good reason to NOT run 20 Milers.

**Good reasons to run 20 Milers**

1. If you are running 70+ miles per week at faster than 7:30 per mile pace.  

In this instance, runners are running enough miles per week fast enough that they can complete a 20 mile run without the Long Run being disproportionate to their overall training load.

And 2. If you need the confidence and psychological boost of doing a 20 Miler

Many runners feel that they need the boost in confidence and the piece of mind that come from running a 20 Miler.  If you feel that you will get a big psychological benefit by running a 20 Miler, even if it takes 3-3.5 hours in order to complete, then do it- With this caveat:  take it easy for the next week or so and make sure that you are fully recovered before you begin your regular training schedule again.  

**Good reason to Not run a 20 Miler**

 It takes too long to recover from a 20 Miler


The stress of running more than 2.5 hours is too great for many positive returns and takes too much time to recover from.

The first thing to do:  Focus on maximizing the number of miles that you run over the course of the entire week.  This is MUCH more important than any one Run  If you are only running 25-35 mpw, or only 3-4 days a week, doing a Long run will more likely be harmful than beneficial.  When the Long Run is more than 30% of your weekly mileage it stresses your body significantly and takes a long time- up to a week or more- to fully recover.   So before you worry about your Long Run, make sure that you have maximized the mileage over the whole week— Work up to running 6-7 days per week. Add a mile or two to each of the daily runs- let the Long Run grow in proportion to the weekly mileage.

**How to get the Most from your Long Runs:**
If you are training for a marathon, you will find the greatest success by focusing on your Marathon Goal Pace first and Distance second.  Here are two Long Run strategies that my runners have had great success with:

**Long Run with Fast Finish** (Progression Run) Early in the program, start with running the last mile at your Goal Marathon Pace. (It doesn’t matter if you are not training for a marathon, this is a great way to get the most from your Long Run).  As you become more comfortable at your Goal Marathon Pace increase the distance of your Fast Finish at Goal Marathon Pace.  

A 10 Week Progression might look like this

*Week 1:		10 miles easy, last 1 Mile @ GoalMarathon Pace

*Week 2:		10 miles easy, last 2 Miles @ Goal Marathon Pace

*Week 3:		12 miles easy, last 2 Miles @ Goal Marathon Pace

*Week 4:		12 miles easy, last 3 Miles @ Goal Marathon Pace

*Week 5:		14 miles easy, last 3 Miles @ Goal Marathon Pace

*Week 6:		14 miles easy, last 4 Miles @ Goal Marathon Pace

*Week 7:		16 miles easy, last 4 Miles @ Goal Marathon Pace

*Week 8:		16 miles easy, last 4 Miles @ Goal Marathon Pace

*Week 9:		16 miles easy, last 5 Miles @ Goal Marathon Pace

*Week 10:	16 miles easy, last 6 Miles @ Goal Marathon Pace


**Long Steady State Runs** (Sub-Threshold Run)Steady state runs are done at Goal Marathon Pace and should not feel too difficult.  Do not make the mistake of running the Steady State Run too hard.  These workouts are sub-threshold; the runner never goes into oxygen debt.  Steady State Runs should be easy to recover from and not to hard on the body.

Warm-up 2-3 miles, Steady State Run, 2-3 mile Cool-down, for a total of 10-15+ miles

Week #			Steady State Run

*1				3-4 Miles at Marathon Pace

*2				5-6 Miles at Marathon Pace

*3				7-8 Miles at Marathon Pace

*4				7-8 Miles at Marathon Pace

*5				9-10 Miles at Marathon Pace

*6				9-10 Miles at Marathon Pace

*7				9-10 Miles at Marathon Pace

*8				9-10 Miles at Marathon Pace

4-6 weeks out from the marathon I like to have my runners run a couple of workouts of between 12 and 17 miles at Marathon Pace.  

The Steady State Long Run and the Long Run with Fast Finish are not an either or choice.  If you are just getting started,  you can mix and match to break things up and keep things fresh:  do week 1 of the Fast Finish, week 2 the Steady State,  etc.  

If you have a decent mileage base and can handle the training load, you can do both workouts each week.  Steady State Run on Wednesday, and Fast Finish on Saturday, for example.

This long run strategy is not simply a theory of mine, we practice what we preach.  Below is a sample of the long runs that a group of my athletes have run over the past few months.  This group is training to run fall marathons in 2:40-2:42 or a half marathon in 1:18.  They average 85-105 mpw.  By keeping the long run distances a little shorter, the runners are able to recover fully in 2-3 days and are prepared to run the next work-out feeling fresh and strong.

*16 easy

*18 w last 4 miles at 6:00 pace

*18 easy

*16 with last 8 miles at Marathon Pace (6:06)

*18 miles 2 mile warm-up, 16 @ 6:20, 1 mile cool-down

*18 mile cut down (1st mile @7:30 pace, run each mile 5 sec faster than the previous, hold last 3 miles at 6:06 pace)

It's on a sidewalk in typical American suburbs on a somewhat busy street. Mostly residential, but some shopping centers as well. Most days there is a fair amount of people out running/walking dogs whatever.

So I was running along when I see an older lady in a parking lot making her way to the exit, face buried in her cell. When I spotted her she was probably about 30 feet from the street.  She never once looked up once until she was ready to pull into the main street (already into the sidewalk). Fortunately, I'm an alert runner so I spotted her distracted driving from a pretty good distance (luckily she was in front of me), but If hadn't I would've probably been in a bad spot.

So here's the questionable part - I stop short and look directly at the driver. When she finally looks up and sees me, I do my best 'wtf' pose and act like she had almost just hit me. I could tell I'd just scared the hell out of her by the expression on her face. At that point I just continued on. Only later did I think that may have been over the top.

Justified? Jerk of the year?

The nurse replied she thought that might have something to do with her being alive because of her strong heart and lungs.  This is obviously not a sure reason, but it inspired the hell out of me.  Thought ya'll might appreciate it.  I'm going for a run.  Also, donate blood.  It really does save people's lives.

If you can't push yourself during a run, how do you expect to push yourself in any other aspect of your life? Disciplined running can help you become disciplined in other aspects of your life and make you into a better person. That's why I love running. 2 years ago I was 230lbs, low self esteem, and lazy. Today, I just ran a 20minute 5k, doing well in school and at my internship, and have never been happier. Just last week I did a 4:56 mile. I used to hate the 5 minutes after a run, but now I long for it. Running has truly made me into a better person!

I started out running 1 block. I was 217 pounds. That was in January and I've now lost 33 pounds and just finished mt first half marathon. My time was 1 hour and 58mins and I've already signed up for my second one.
http://imgur.com/p9eWJj8

I'm a runner.

Edit: A little more back story. I first started running after I got myself the Nike+ GPS watch for Christmas and got an early start on my new years resolution. My girlfriend and I both decided to be more fit and wanted to lose weight (she doesn't run but goes to the gym more and does cardio there, running isn't for everyone). Started off running in Nike Free's (Awful I know but bare with me) and just did 3k, 3 times a week. I found out though that my feet would keep going numb, spreading from my toes all the way up to my shins. I switched to a pair of shoes with arch support (I pronate) and my distance started to go up again. At around 7k, same problem happened with my feet and I had almost reserved myself to being a low distance runner. Around the end of January I started reading up on barefoot running. I currently work at a running store so I had encountered the topic a few times and since my distance wasn't very high it wasn't a big deal dropping down to 1k so my feet could adjust, so I decided to throw my hat in the ring. I bought a pair of the Vibram Seeya's and started running around a bark mulch trail at my house and switched to Garmin for my GPS needs (I started cycling a bit and the Nike doesn't work with biking, great for running though), upping it by 1k a week and then more as I become more comfortable. I finally took them out on the road once I hit 5k and everything was going good. The next week I went to do my first 8k run (longest ever) and when I hit the 7k mark.... nothing. Not one thing was wrong with my feet and I broke out laughing. I bought a second pair of Vibram Komodo's (which I did my half in). I did my first 5k race in March and finished it in 26:11 and was pretty happy about it. Ever since I could run longer distances without having to worry about my feet, I've been hooked. I have an unstoppable hunger to achieve and overcome more and more fitness goals. I have the Spartan Sprint this Saturday, similar to the Warrior Dash, the Whistler Tough Mudder at the end of the month and the Victoria Half in October, and if I can get time off work I'll be doing the Surrey half as well in September, all barefoot.

I honestly never really considered myself a runner nor did I ever think I would be a runner. It was always just cardio. I did rugby for a long time but running was always a punishment, but now its the sport. My sport is the punishment of every other sport and that honestly feels amazing to me. To be able to be part of the elite group of athletes that participate in this sport is an honor, and I still have so far to go. I want to do Boston, and Ironman and an Ultramarathon eventually, all barefoot. Its a daunting task but 5 months ago I was running a block and now here I am, sharing my experience with all of you and loving every second of it so I know I can do it.

If anyone is wondering about motivation or how I motivated myself, I took it personally. The road, the wind, the rain, the pain all whisper, ""you don't need to run today, its ok,"" but I'm too stubborn to listen. Every time I run I go to battle with the elements and the road, wind, rain and heat aren't going to beat me. Not yesterday, not today and not tomorrow. That's how I keep myself motivated.

Here's a picture of me running my half in the pouring rain!

What got me there was reading /r/running last night and noticing how many people said so much of it *mental*. I decided today that I was going to forget my usual walk periods and just keep going regardless, and listen to my body.

I decided then I would give the birthday run a go.  I have never been a fast runner but prefer the LSD runs.  My parameters were to complete the run in a 24 hour period, walking is okay.  I pretty much followed a half marathon training schedule due to kids and  other time commitments.  

Birthday day arrived and I went out for a 6 mile run at midnight with my best friend.  After I was done I went home and slept until heading out again at 7am.  I started off with intervals of running 3/4 of the time and walking 1/4 of the time.  My girlfriend met me for lunch at 16 miles where I stopped and took about a 90 minute break.  I ate a huge freaking lunch.  It was awesome.i thought maybe I would barf later in the day but was okay.   I took my break time to charge my phone so I was all set.  I headed back the way I came for the  final 15 miles and was much much slower.  I probably walked the last 6 miles.  

At the end of the run was a  birthday party and celebration at my house.  The whole experience was incredible and I recommend it to anyone.  It's rare for me to have a whole day to think about things and not have to worry about the kids or work so it was a great opportunity.  I'm now thinking I might want to look into running a full marathon (ie. run the whole way.). I ended the day around 4:30pm.   Anyways, just wanted to share with you all!

 and didn't get very much support or encouragement, which really upset me.
As I stated in the previous post, I had roughly 10 weeks to train. It was recommended by [george-bob](http://www.reddit.com/user/george-bob) that I look up a training plan from Hal Higdon and begin with the time remaining and that is exactly what I did.

All of my training (except for a few 5Ks and 10Ks) was done on a treadmill. My long runs were set a 10 min/mile place, the shorter runs (&lt;13.1 miles) were done for time. 
I started the [Novice 2 Training Plan.](http://www.halhigdon.com/training/51138/Marathon-Novice-2-Training-Program) I started my training at the very last day of Week 9, due to time constraints. My very first run was a half marathon. It was brutal, but I was able to complete it around 2:20. Even though it was damn hard at the beginning, I kept it up the training and was able to finish the marathon. My completion time is 4hr 31min. 2hr 5min for the first half. I was hoping to finish a bit quicker, but I am not upset with the results. I never watched my diet, if I wanted ice cream, pizza, cheeseburgers, I would eat them. As I mentioned before, nearly every step of my training was done on a treadmill. I imagine if I had done my training like the race, my time would have reflected a bit better.

A few notes about the race. Right after the 10K marker, I got all grumpy while running for about two miles before I got clear headed and re-focused. From around mile 8 to mile 18, I felt great! Around the 18 mile marker I started feeling sluggish and figured it would be best to ease off the throttle a tad, at the 20 mile marker,  I wanted to die. Every step from 20 to 26.2 was agony. I jogged as often as I could bring myself to do it, but there was sadly at a lot of walking that was involved.

So I googled around for a real running store, the kind with employees that know what pronation means and certainly have a better idea of what shoes are good for what. I walked in and a sales person talked to me about what shoes I wore, had me walk barefoot and then talked to me about my running style and what I thought I might need. Then she went, got a couple different pairs of shoes which I tried on and then they put my on the treadmill.

Here was one of the awesome parts of the whole trip, they took a video of me running, and then played it back frame by frame, and low and behold, I was overpronating, even with a mid-foot strike. It was clear as day, no if and's or but's. Then we changed shoe choices, tried a few others and eventually decided on a pair of brooks (pureflow 2) were the right match for me, and the video seemed to prove it. 

I genuinely believe that I'm much better off for having gone to a real running store, talked to someone as knowledgeable as I did and I don't regret the trip what-so-ever. I learned a ton as well. Do yourself the favor if you're in a similar boat, go to a real running store!

Well after eating lunch with him every day he doesn't eat much at all. It baffles me.

Do you think this is possibly because he doesn't push himself and keep his heart rate up? He says by the end of his marathons he averages an 11-12 minute mile, and for an avid runner that seems pretty slow, even for a marathon. I'm seriously curious as to how this phenomenon happens...

A few years ago, I was a smoker, drank 3 nights a week, barely exercised, and ate like shit.  I also had serious body image issues.  I got my act together in December 2009, vowing to lose the weight I had put on in college (35 pounds).  In March of 2010, I decided to give C25k a try.  I completed it, ran my first 5k, and the rest is history!  It became much more than just losing weight, and very much about adopting a healthy lifestyle that I love.

As of yesterday, I am a marathoner and in the best shape of my life.  I've never felt better.

I've always been told how its much better but never believed it.  I've been running about 3 miles, 3x per week for the last few years. Whether it be on a treadmill or outside I always played music and I never understood why it was a big deal. 
I recently decided to train for a half marathon as a way to motivate myself from my stagnant routine. When I decided this I also thought I'd try running without music to see what all the hype was about. Plus the idea of running for that length of time with music seemed like it would get annoying. 

I will never run with music again. I guess before I relied on the music to pump me up and get me through my run. With just my thoughts and my own motivation my runs are easier and more satisfying than ever before. I guess this also makes me much more open minded to other ideas I was previously unwilling to try. So if anyone else has any successful tips for training for a half I'd love to hear them.

If you depend on music...just give it a try without it and see how you feel.

Yesterday, I turned 35, and succeeded in this self-imposed challenge. 

Total number of miles run: **1825** (averages out to 35.09 miles a week)

Greater than **217,000** calories burned

Races in order of event: 

-Half Marathon **1:54:13** (beat 1:59:02 from the year before)

-Half Marathon **1:47:35** PR (beat 1:47:39 from 2 years before)

-5 miler **36:12** PR (beat 42:42 from the year before)

-5k **21:38** PR (first time race this distance)

-10k **47:02** PR (first time race this distance)

I thankfully never got seriously injured or sick.  (Though I had a little knee pain in week 4)

Treadmill running: 18 miles when I was traveling abroad. 

As it was a real mild winter, I only ran in snow twice. The yak tracks worked well.

Starting in July, the pace of my runs have slowed by about 30 seconds a mile (because of heat? exhaustion?). I also find myself procrastinating runs until the end of the 'week' and would run the last 25 miles or so in a couple of days (unthinkable a year ago).  This upcoming year, I plan to allow banking, so starting today I will average 35 miles a week until next year.

I only started running a few years ago.  After initial successes, found myself starting training late for races and not meeting my potential.   I was being inconsistent with my workouts and was putting on weight.  The most I would run a week would be about 25 mies.

I am now a firm believer that lots of miles, whatever their speed, can increase race speed. I didn't stretch.  I find having a GPS watch to be extremely useful.  

I have now built a strong base, and feel like I'm in excellent shape. I found this process challenging but rewarding.   I have a half marathon in October, I'm interested to see if I can PR again.


I plan to increase each year my now average weekly miles until I qualify for Boston, at which point my goal mileage will decrease by one a year.  To the end of getting faster, I might start things like hill workouts and speed training.

Here's the deal:

* The spreadsheet is located [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0ArTVz-nvTm8ydFhrQWRyQTl3c1NVRl9ZM0VycEhXaGc). At some point we will probably also add it to the sidebar.

* In the spreadsheet, add your username and any goals you have for 2013. You can also assign tiers to the goals if you like having A, B, and C goals (but if you don't like doing that, you can just leave that column blank). 

* When you achieve your goals, write down the date you achieved them and (if you'd like to) add proof (links to race results, race reports, photos, screenshots, and so on). 

* There's also a section for miscellaneous comments if you want to write anything else (perhaps how you're progressing or why that's a goal you'd like to achieve).

* You can append and change your own goals whenever you want.

**Please be mature about this** and use it for its intended purpose. I will be backing it up periodically so if anyone comes across any issues let me know and we can roll it back. Preferably, I'd like to avoid that situation.

I've been shaving a minute to a minute and half off of my miles. Should I be attributing this to weightlifting? Has anyone else had better results due to adding some weights to their routine?

I'm a 28 year-old guy with [cystic fibrosis](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cystic_fibrosis). CF is a genetic disease that affects multiple organ systems, but the one that makes it the hardest to deal with is its impact on the lungs. My lungs produce thick, sticky mucus that makes breathing more difficult. As you can imagine, this makes respiration more difficult and blood oxygenation less efficient. 

With all of the amazing medical advances that have made my life better (and have made me not dead yet), running has been the one that has made the biggest difference for my quality of life. When I run, I feel like I don't have CF for a while. My body just gets into that groove that you all know so well, my coughing stops, and my whole being just gets focused on the task of putting one foot in front of the other. It's like magic... I do cough a bunch when I run, but it doesn't bother because I always tell myself that I'm adding a few extra minutes to my life each time I hit the trails and crank out a few miles.

I'm sure that many of you have had plantar fasciitis, runner's knee, chafed nips, shin splints, and all the other stuff that comes along with this great sport. Those injuries can be frustrating, and I think we harp on what doesn't work a lot of the time. But it seems to me that most of the time our bodies work pretty well, allowing us to enjoy the road/trail whenever we want. So here's to the stuff that does work, and next time you go for a run, take a deep breath and say thank you for those wonderful lungs that work so beautifully and are so easy to take for granted.

With synonyms, descriptions, purpose, and examples",163,19,10,http://www.reddit.com/r/running/comments/16yveu/types_of_runs_and_paces_with_synonyms/,"I saw the types of runs post earlier and did not like it.  I have been working on this draft for a while, so I finished it and posted it.
[The physiological benefits of running post](http://www.reddit.com/r/running/comments/16yu4f/the_physiological_benefits_of_running/) is a sister post to this one that explains the benefits of doing certain types of runs.

**Races**

**Goal Race-** *Peak race*

 A Goal Race is the select targeted race that a runner focuses on for a training period. Because a runner can only “peak”  a limited number of times per year, by picking a goal race a runner can train for maximum performance on a specific date at a specific distance.   Most people can only peak at on or two marathons a year- generally a spring and a fall marathon.  For shorter races, 1/2 marathon, 10k, 5k, mile, etc, you can run more of them because the take less time to recover from.  Serious runners who focus on races shorter than the marathon generally break their training up into a few seasons and build up to a goal race or two at the end of each season.  

Racing affords runners a concrete goal that they can work towards, a framework around which they can design their training and an opportunity to test your mettle against yourself, the clock and others.  Source of pride.  A measure of growth.

e.g. Boston Marathon, 3:05:23, 1489th place overall, or
Turkey Trot, 10k, 42:15, PR!, 4th in age group

**Tune-up Race-**  *Sharpening Race*

During the training period other races can be scheduled. Runners generally do not taper much or alter their training schedule considerably for tune-up races, but rather “train through” the tune-up races.  These races help the runner stay motivated, sharpen for a peak race, and provide an opportunity to check on fitness improvements. 

**Training Runs**

**Long Run-** *Distance Run,  Long Slow Distance, LSD, Over-distance*

Long Runs are often incorporate one or more of the other types of runs and/or intensities listed below as part of the long run; see examples below.

A long run is 20-30% of weekly mileage, lasting between 1-2.5 hours.  As a general rule, Long Runs should not exceed 2.5 hours, beyond that you get well into the point of diminishing returns.  
	
e.g.  Long Easy Run, 9 miles easy, or
Long Progression Run, 10 miles easy last 2 miles @ marathon pace, or
Long Fartlek Run, 5 miles controlled, 6x1minute hard, 1 minute easy running recovery, 4 miles easy


**Tempo Run-** *Threshold, lactic threshold, steady-state, cruise interval, tempo interval, long interval*

A tempo run is a sustained, fast, but controlled, run for a specified distance or time; usually 2-10 miles. The pace of tempos varies with the distance.  A short 20 minute tempo run will be much faster than a 12 mile tempo at marathon pace. The tempo run helps increase your lactic threshold allowing a runner to run fast, longer. I included long intervals as a tempo run because long intervals help increase lactate threshold. Even though they are not sustained efforts, the rest period is short, giving the same benefit to the lactate threshold.


e.g. 2 miles easy, 3 mile tempo, 2 miles easy

**Progression Run-** *Fast finish, Build*

Progressive runs are continuous runs that start slow and finish fast. Runners begin with an easy pace for a set duration or distance and finish the run at a more intense pace at the end.  How the the runner transitions from the easy initial pace to the faster pace varies from incremental increases in speed over several miles, to running the last 15 minutes (or however long) of a long run at marathon pace, to running the last few minutes at near max effort. 

e.g. 6 miles at base pace + 2 miles hard, or
8 miles easy, run the last 3 miles increasing from marathon pace, to 1/2 pace, to 10k pace at each mile
4 miles easy last 5 minutes moderate


**Fartlek-** *Surges*

Literal translation is speed play in Swedish (Edit: not Finnish as I put originally. Thanks for the correction)

Intermittent bursts of speed within a continuous run.  The length- measured in either time or distance- and the intensity of the fast portion can vary.  The duration and the intensity of the recovery portion of the fartlek vary as well.  

Fartleks are as a less intense aerobic capacity workout that spit the difference between an interval workout and a tempo.  Fartleks are often used early in the training cycle as an introduction to speed a  and ‘head’s up’ to prep the body for the more intense workouts.  They are also used later in the training cycle as aerobic capacity maintenance workouts.

e.g. 5 miles, work the hills, or
2 miles easy, 6x (30 seconds hard at start of each mile), 2 easy
8 miles with 20 minutes of minute on minute off


**Training Run-** *Easy Run, Base Run*
 
  A Training Run is the default workout and pace, if no other pace or intensity is described or assigned, assume that the pace is Training Run.

The training run is both a description of a type of run and a pace—See Intensities below. The training run is the most common run and the pace. It is done at the runner’s natural pace:  The pace that feels normal and comfortable to the runner, over a distance that is also comfortable to the runner.
 
A runner should be able to talk in a normal conversational tone while running at his natural pace.  Training runs are of a moderate distance- not as short as an easy run and not as long as a long run.

e.g. 8 miles easy. Or, 7 miles.

**Recovery Run-** *Shake-out, jog, slow run, super easy run, warm-up, cool down, active rest*

Like Training Runs, Recovery Runs describe both a type of run and the pace of the run. Recovery Runs are - usually- slower and shorter runs that are extremely comfortable for the runner.  Recovery runs are typically 45 seconds to 2 minutes per mile slower than Training Runs. They are also the warm-up and cool-down pace before and after a workout and the pace used for rest between intervals.  

Recovery runs allow runners to build endurance while not making any new demands on their bodies 

e.g. 4 mile shake-out.  Or, 3 miles super easy.

**Interval Runs-**  *Repetions, track workout, repeats, ladder, speed intervals, long intervals, sprint intervals, short intervals*

These are just a few of the many names and workouts that fall under the Interval Run category.  At the most basic level, interval runs involve repeatedly running hard for a  with a defined amount of rest between each effort.

*Name or type of Interval
(# of intervals)  (Length of interval- time or distance)  (Intensity of interval- duration or effort Length of recovery-time or distance)

*Recovery: The rest period, a specific time or distance between intervals, that the runner runs or walks

*Sets- if more than one
Length of recovery between sets- time or distance 
Type of recovery- Active: Run or walk specific time or distance, or complete rest

Interval workouts help optimize running economy, increase a runner’s speed and build aerobic capacity.

e.g. 2 mile warmup, 12x 400m @ 72 sec, 200m active recovery, 2 mile cool down. Or, 2 mile warmup, ladder 200m @35, 400m @ 77, 800m @ 2:40, 2x Mile @ 5:20, 2 mile cool down



**Hill Repeats-** 

Repetitions run up a moderate to moderately steep hill- 4-8% grade. If the runner is bounding up the hill rather than running up,  the hill is too steep. Run up at 1 mile to 5k effort for 45 seconds to three minutes.  Jog slowly or walk back to the start after each repetition.

Hill Repeats are used most often early in the training cycle but can be very effective tool throughout the training cycle.

Hill repeats build strength, speed, and increase aerobic capacity.  Hill repeats allow a runner to have a very intense workout with minimal impact; this helps reduce the risk of injury while enjoying the benefits of an intense workout.

e.g. 2 mile warmup, 8 x Ridgeway Hill (45 sec), 2 mile cool down. Or, 2 mile warmup, 2x Arb Hill (3:00), 6x Ridgeway Hill (45 sec), 2 mile cool down

**Drills-**   *Circuits, form drills, diagonals, HIIT, strides, accelerations, hill sprints, sprints, bounding, pickups, 50s, 60s, 100s, 150s*

Drills are any of several short and fast (&lt; 20 seconds) events that aid in developing form, maintaining speed, accelerating recovery, or increasing running efficiency. Drills are usually not a workout in themselves, and are typically added to the end of a run or workout. Strides and pick-ups are also used directly before intense workouts like intervals or hill repeats (and before races) as a dynamic stretch and to increase the heart rate.

e.g. 10x 8-10 sec hill sprints at the end of training run. 

**Running Intensity-  A Note of Explanation**

*Running by Feel: Sprint, Hard, Moderate, Training and Easy*

The five designations of intensity- Sprint, Hard, Moderate, Base, and Easy- are broad descriptions of pace and not meant to be the definitive descriptions.  These descriptions are meant to be easily understood by runners of all ability levels and runners of varying levels of knowledge and sophistication regarding training.

An experienced runner has her ‘feel’ strongly calibrated to her pace:  she knows what 8:10 per mile feels like, and she can feel the difference between 8:20 and 8:30 pace.  It takes time for a runner’s body to learn the feel of different paces; so it is difficult for new runners to run a specific pace right away (Although you will be surprised how quickly you can begin to get a sense of different paces) so running by feel may be the only option for new runners.

Changes in terrain, footing, weather, or environmental conditions may encourage a runners to designate an intensity (or effort- e.g. Ran 8:20 effort on the snowy trails) instead of a specific pace as well.  If the runner runs on snowy roads, trails, at altitude, when it is extremely hot, cold, or windy, or he is in an unfamiliar location, it can be easier to assign a perceived effort to a run than to try and run a specific pace. 

**Sprint-** *Top speed, all-out*

A runner’s max effort for a short duration- no longer than 300-400m


**Hard Pace-** *Fast, very hard, specific pace (e.g. 10k race pace)*

Near a runner’s limit over a distance.  Hard is relative to the distance, a hard 400m interval is different (and much faster) than a hard 8 mile tempo, but the effort for each is near the runner’s limit for that distance.

**Moderate Pace-** *Intensity-controlled, controlled, good pace, comfortable, steady, specific pace (e.g. marathon pace, or 20 sec over 1/2 marathon pace)*

Outside a runner’s comfort zone; runner should feel stressed but in control—  feels like about 3/4 effort.  A fast and snappy pace that leaves the runner still feeling like she could do more at the end of the run:  she does not leave it all on the road, there is still fuel in the tank.

The moderate pace is not used too often in training relative to hard, easy, and recovery pace. Moderate pace can have a place in early season training as a way to mix it up a bit and break the monotony. Training done at marathon pace is a moderate pace run.

**Easy Pace-** *Training pace, Conversational pace, Comfortable pace, Natural pace, Base Pace, Fair pace, OK pace*

Pay attention here, this gets a little weird.  I, and many others, call the base pace, Easy Pace.  You would think that the recovery pace would be called easy pace, but it is often not. This can lead to confusion, so be aware.

Easy pace is a runner’s natural pace:  The pace that feels normal and comfortable to the runner, over a distance that is also comfortable to the runner.
 
A runner should be able to talk in a normal conversational tone while running at his natural pace.  


**Recovery Pace-** *Shake-out, Slow, Recovery, Warm-up, Cool-down, Jog, Recovery, Super-easy pace*
 
Recovery pace is typically 45 seconds to 2 minutes per mile slower than Easy Pace. They are also the warm-up and cool-down pace before and after a workout and the pace used for rest between intervals. 

The recovery pace feels slow.  Sometimes a runner is so tired and flat that their only option is to run slowly.  Other times a runner feels ok, but forces himself to run a slow shakeout to aid in recovery and to ‘get the blood moving.’

1357739551.0,145,self.running,168xr6,The story of my first running commute.,173,28,37,http://www.reddit.com/r/running/comments/168xr6/the_story_of_my_first_running_commute/,"I would like to share with you the story of my first ever commute on foot. I live 9.5 km (about 6 miles) away from my workplace, and I'm currently training for the Paris half-marathon of March 3rd. Doing the commute on foot is something I've fantasized about for a long time. Yesterday I finally did it.

It was not as easy as I expected but I'm glad I did it.

Some background: I have been running on and off since I was 14, but I've only been training consistenly since two years (I'm 24 now). I used to focus on 5&amp;10km, and training on speed. These days though I train about twice a week, my current longest run being a recent 13.5 km, or 15k if you include warming-up and cooling-down. So I figured 2x9.5 km on a day can't be so hard, can it? Last Monday I prepared by bringing clean clothes to my workplace, and yesterday morning I took off, on foot, carrying in a backpack some breakfast and clean underwear.

Lesson 1: I need to get a better backpack if I want to do this more regularly. The backpack was bouncing about very uncomfortably and I decided to take a couple of recovery breaks during the run. But in the end I arrived, had breakfast, and felt quite energetic at work.

Then, in the evening, I changed and started running back and I got to learn...

Lesson 2: it's hard to run twice on a day. My muscles were clearly not expecting this to happen.

As I did some warming-up, I could feel how tired my legs were already. But I got into the zone of running, and... right before I passed the local rowing club, two rowing boats took off. I was running slightly faster than those boats; of course I couldn't slow down now! Stride after stride, I slowly overtook the boats, my face not showing anything of the growing surge of pain in my muscles. I was looking good!

Soon, the route led me away from the rowing course. I was now halfway, and stopped for a traffic light. When the light turned green, I started running again and... ouch! The strangest sensation happened. My energy level was fine, and my body was totally ready to go! But my legs were just burning at every stride. My calves felt overstretched and even my joints started complaining a bit. Grudgingly, I started... walking.

After a minute of walking I started to jog very slowly again. Interestingly enough I could do it, but only slowly! Here I was, taking baby step after baby step. My normal pace would be around 4:40/km, but this pace felt slow! Maybe it was 6:00/km, maybe it was 7:00/km - I really don't know. But strangely enough, it felt good! In fact, it felt really good!

I kept running like this until I reached home, and in fact, I didn't want to stop even then. Every muscle in my legs hurt but I felt great! Baby step after baby step, no speed at all, not even a high heart rate, but endorfin levels like crazy. Is this how ultramarathoners feel? Did I approach that sensation? I don't know, but if so, I need to run an ultramarathon one day!

Such were my thoughts at that point.

Fortunately, as I came home I was struck by an attack of common sense and I called it a night. I went inside, made myself a big dinner with a big dessert, hung around a bit and went to bed early.

This morning my legs felt tired and my left calve feels a bit hurt, but I think the training effect will be all right. My normal bicycle ride to office this morning actually felt quite good, bringing a bit of movement into my tired muscles again.

In conclusion, I'm happy overall. This will not be the last time I commute like this.

We said hello, but after about 10 seconds I heard him yell something like ""Is that Bob?!"" and I turned around and said ""No, Mitch!"" and he told me I looked like a friend of his...

Well anyway, we went on our way, and that was that.

A couple days later I was at Turquoise Lake to do some easy miles with the dog, and I saw this guy again! We chatted a bit, and again, went on our way.

Well yesterday he actually stopped by my house (saw me and the dog walking) and came over, and asked if I wanted to go for a run. He wanted to do a 20 miler up over the hills and back around the lake. ""Sure thing"" I said. He added: ""On one condition: if one of us is too slow or too fast, we just go our separate ways."" It sounded ominous, but when you run alone 90% of the time, it hardly mattered.

So we met up this morning, and ran our 20 miler. It was tough, my hardest (speed-wise) run to date up here, and the guy was simply killing it. Chatting the whole time while I was panting and gasping for air... Sounded like he was very accomplished, and very fast...

Well as we rounded the lake, only about 3 miles to do, we were running like 8 minutes / mile and I was simply dying, and had to stop. He ran on, faster still, and dropped me like a bad habit. I hobbled / walk-ran my way back to the end of the trail, where we jogged back to the car.

Well I did some searching and it turns out my impromptu running buddy  is a Mr. [Steve Peterson](http://thewayofrunning.com/clinics-workshops-and-training-groups/the-nature-of-running/about-steve-peterson/)... who happens to be a *Five*-time Leadville 100 **winner** (!!) and an absolute beast of an ultra runner.

It also turns out that the Leadville Pacing strategy I've been devising is based on ""The Peterson Pattern"", which is no longer online, but is [discussed here](http://ajwellman.blogspot.com/2012/02/lt100-pacing-strategy.html), as an example.

Was a great run, I got totally thrashed, and it was an honour to run with a dude who is such a total machine, and so ridiculously humble about it.

Lessons learned, and training plan used.",173,33,28,http://www.reddit.com/r/running/comments/p2se0/won_my_first_completed_50k_lessons_learned_and/,"I'm still in a bit of shock having won the race not necessarily because I didn't think I could run as well as I did, but more or less because nothing went wrong this time around. I shall start the short story and description there.


Last year I made a bet with my boss that I could beat him in a local 50k. He is a long time ultra runner with experience beyond my years, I am damn near half his age, and easily twice his speed at the shorter events. I figured it would be a one and done, I'd be sipping champagne waiting for him to finish.


The day of the race comes and I have basically trained for it like I train for most of my marathons with relatively little or no foresight that the extra distance could be my undoing. The race is 6 laps through a rolling set of horse trails that quickly become almost knee high mud in areas, and starts at 3:30 pm so you are guaranteed to be finishing in the dark. Through the first few laps I feel fine and decide not to run with any water or food, simply grabbing a gel on each lap and a bottle and dropping the bottle a few hundred meters later where my crew retrieves it and refills for the next lap. This works until the gels start to not taste to good and I opt to completely forego fueling for one lap due to digestion issues. Needless to say I fizzle and DNF on lap 4. I eat through all my glycogen and find myself barely able to hobble into the aid station humbled by a course with relatively little climbing. For later reference my splits were 31 minutes, 32 minutes, 35 minutes, 43 minutes, Fin.


This marks my first real DNF, and made me think very hard about how to train effectively, and how to overcome the issues I had experienced. They were by no means difficult or unfamiliar to trail or ultra runners, or even marathoners. However I had not yet encountered them and needed to find a method for solving this problem lest the race win the following year. 


Skip ahead 6 months, and again a bet is made between my boss and I. His shit-talk is getting annoying, and I decide to make not massive, but necessary alterations to my training plan to properly solve the previous issues I have had. In May I had nearly DNF'd out of a marathon having found myself blown up again and passed out on the side of the road for several minutes, a few times. My fueling had been better this time around, but I seemed to have found a current limit to the distance I could maintain a relatively moderate pace at. As I prepared my training for Jan 2012 I had several issues to solve:


1. fueling, I had a difficult time keeping anything down for extended periods of time.
2. cramping from the marathon in May, and to a lesser extent the 50k in January before it.
3. maintaining a consistent effort over the course, my pace and effort over the 4 laps was uneven and inefficient.


Starting in June I began taking weekly trips out to the North Cascades to begin getting used to spending a long time on my legs. The runs started out as 2-3 hours, but by the end of the summer I had worked my way up to 4-5 hour runs. The effort was very very low, much of the uphills I would hike, I would jog easily on the flats, and try to be a smooth and efficient on the descents. I would bring twice the amount of food I figured I would need, all of varied types. Gels, blocks, solid food, sandwiches, anything. If I threw it up, I didn't bring it on the next trip, if it stayed down, I brought more of it. When I first started the long long runs I could only eat if I jogged very very slowly, or hiked, my main focus as I ran these, wasn't the distance or the speed, but simply to increase the pace and volume at which I could consume calories. By the middle of the fall I could run sub 7 minute miles while eating gels without digestive issue. It took a concentrated effort, but the end result was that I (painstakingly) found what I needed to do fuel wise to keep me going. My plan was to run the 50k in under 4 hours, and if I could keep myself moving for 4 hours going up and down mountain passes for 5 hours, I was going to be able to manage on a course with far less incline.


Following the injection of super long runs into my training I started to build my mileage up. In the fall I was running XC, to me a good chance to work on strength, and my ability to maintain effort over varied terrain. The training plan I built for the fall involved very very little speed-work and instead focused on longer more sustained efforts. I have historically had a difficulty remaining injury free whilst doing speed-work, and needed to find a way to simulate that sort of over hill over dale raw XC strength in other manners. What I ended up with was alternating days of 90 minutes of relaxed running on rolling trails, with days of 90 minutes with a sustained effort on rolling trails. Essentially a 90 minute run with 30 minutes of uptempo injected midway. The courses I ran always had hills, but no extended climbs as that was not my focus. My philosophy was: the more time spent on the surface the faster you get at it. My race I was gearing up for was on rolling muddy trails that had some fast sections, and some slower ones as well so those were the types of trails I ran on for months.


XC came and passed and I was left with 2 months to prepare until the race. Despite my unorthodox training, I had run a huge 8k PR, and lopped a minute off my half marathon time. I however didn't know how well the training had paid off for a 50k. One last snag remained. On my last super long run I began to experience sever leg cramping that almost relegated me to a walk for the final several miles. It took an PHD dissertation in pain to finish the run but I somehow managed. The only glimmer of hope I had was that the cramping managed to subside when I took a gel with more sodium than my others. Although I had no idea what had caused the severe cramping, the idea that knowingly increasing my sodium intake may (albeit by placebo) stave off cramping was enough to leave me hopeful.


On race day I had the same plan as the previous year, only don't mess everything up. I know I had learned so much. The race did kinda go off without a hitch though. I decided on gels every 20 minutes, with a back up of flat coke in case things went south. Through my first two laps nothing really happened aside from my lead growing increasingly 34:43 and 33:27 were my first two lap splits. On lap 3 I felt the caffeine from the gels get to me and I stopped for a short visit to the brush, then followed that up with another evenly paced lap 35:05, and 34:33. At this point I knew I was racing into unknown territory. My lead was massive, and the only person who could keep me from finishing very well was myself. Towards the end of lap 4 my stomach started to rebel as fiercely as my lower intestine had previously. The gels weren't staying down so I swapped to flat coke for lap 5 and continued eating despite the vomit. I hadn't passed all the caffeine from my system yet so again on lap 5 I took a trip to the brush and eased off the gas ever so slightly, 37:52. Lap 6 I went back to water and swore off the gels. I knew I had enough sugar in my body to make the final loop, so I just worried about hydration. On several uphills I began to feel my hamstrings tighten, easing off the gas on them until I got back onto a flats where I ever so slightly lowered my pace back down. Sometimes the flat section wasn't long enough to get back to my comfortable ""top speed"", so I simply didn't push it. I knew on the final lap I was managing a controlled explosion and I couldn't let it get out of hand until I was passed the finish line. It wasn't until I saw the flood lights at the end and could hear the cowbells that I laid it all on the table. Final lap: 37:43, finish time 3:33.


The biggest lesson learned here is: don't train abstractly. If you're training for a race on roads, focus a majority of your time running on roads. If those roads are flat, don't worry about hills as much. If the race is on trails, try your best to simulate the trails you will be running. Running a trail is one thing, racing it when its muddy is another.


Work on what you have issues with. In the following years I will have to work on speed work if I wish to get much more of my PRs down any farther. Not to say I will need to DO more speed work, but I need to find a way to do that speed work without getting injured. Working on fueling and staying on your feet for hours payed huge dividends months later. My first three marathons left me unable to walk the following days after them. After this 50k I didn't feel like a bouquet of roses, but the following morning I felt fine. 


Best of luck to all you runnitors, I will finish this with a sample week of training:


Monday: Easy 60-75 mins

Tues: Med-hard 90 mins

Weds: 4+ hour long run in mountains or 2-2:30 long run along logging roads negative splitting second half

Thurs: Easy 45-60 mins

Fri: Med-hard 90 mins

Sat: Easy 90 mins

Details inside.,177,32,61,http://www.reddit.com/r/running/comments/lxrob/rrunning_saved_my_hiney_this_morning_just_wanted/,"Over the past few months, I've been reading this subreddit and getting some excellent guidance and advice on running and the running lifestyle. The piece of advice that saved my butt this morning though is running against traffic, not with it. In my years as a 5th grade bicycle student in elementary school, they taught us to always ride with traffic, and for years I followed this logic while running as well. Reading reddit, I learned to do the opposite when running, especially since I have to wear my ipod. I was on a residential road with no sidewalk (there are so few where I live it's hard to find a 100% safe route) and a huge pickup truck came barreling onto the side of the road, swerving into the mud, just feet from where I was before swerving back into the road to try and avoid me. I jumped into someone's yard as he passed and had just enough time to give him the finger before he disappeared around the corner. He was on a cell phone, traveling much too fast down a residential road and was losing control of his vehicle before he even saw me. I would have been killed if I was running on the other side of the road and he was behind me. So thank you r/running, I live to run another day!

TL;DR: Runnit saved my life.

**EDIT: I both heard AND saw the truck coming, so the headphones are not the issue in this particular post, *but thank you for your concern.***

Not only was it not cold out AT ALL, I actually started to sweat, and was grinning from ear to ear the entire time.

I know for the seasoned runners, this probably sounds silly. I started C25K last June to lose weight. I'm about 100 pounds down now and NEVER thought I'd be a runner.

1350267638.0,140,self.running,11hpj4,Finished my first 50 miler this morning. Here is a small race report for any of you that are curious.,163,23,59,http://www.reddit.com/r/running/comments/11hpj4/finished_my_first_50_miler_this_morning_here_is_a/,"So I ran the Heartland 50 miler in Cassoday, Kansas starting last night and finishing this morning. This was my first ultra, and my first actual race in 7 years. Here are a few of my thoughts from the race.

Cost: I signed up in June and I don't remember how much I paid. I know it was $55 or under, so the cost was pretty good.

Pre-race instructions: Since Cassoday is super small town in the middle of nowhere, it was kind of important to get directions. The 2 race directors went above and beyond to get us good directions, plus they were sending out awesome weather updates to help us get our drop bags planned out. There was a severe weather system moving in, and they were on it with updates for us.

Aid Stations: There was an aid station roughly every 4 miles. At 4, 12, and 20, they were unmanned with a good selection of food and water to fill up with. At 8, 16, and the 25 mile turnaround, they were manned. I have never seen such dedicated volunteers in my life. Through all the crap weather, they stuck it out and motivated us. The food they were making for us was awesome. I even had one volunteer at mile 33 help me take my shoes off to get the rocks out of them. Simply amazing. 

Course: The course was well planned out and well marked. The whole race is through a prairie, so there is a large psychological part of being able to see way too far ahead of you. It's a great course. 

The 100 milers started at 0600 on Saturday, and we started at 1800. We had an 18 hour cut off time and the 100s had a 30 hour. 

My overall experience was amazing. Some advice to anyone wanting to run a 50 miler: hydrate more than you think you need to. My right calf cramped really bad from mile 12 to mile 22 and I could tell it was from dehydration. Eat. Eat Eat Eat. I was starving and could feel myself being malnourished by the turnaround. Lastly, just keep running. Walking the uphills wasn't bad, but I caught myself walking the flats sometimes too. The next 50 I run, I'm going to force myself to run unless it's an uphill.

1372538772.0,142,self.running,1hbu2c,So my wife doesn't want me to run my first 50k in September and why I'm going to do it. (kinda long story),187,45,38,http://www.reddit.com/r/running/comments/1hbu2c/so_my_wife_doesnt_want_me_to_run_my_first_50k_in/,"(Backstory)  I'm 35 years old and have been happily married to my wife for 10 years this October.  We have 3 children and life is pretty much good for us.  I joined the Army in 1996 just out high school and was active until 2001, then the reserves and then deployed to Iraq in 2003-4 and discharged in 2006.  After I got out of the service, I pretty much let myself go.  Drinking and depression led me to a low point in my life  where I felt like a car just stuck in the mud with the tires spinning.

Fast forward to 2009.  My wife had just gotten a job as a fitness instructor at  local gym, teaching spinning and zumba classes and some personal training.  She nicely reminded me that as an employee her immediate family got discounted memberships so I said what the heck.  Now at this point, my physical ability was at an all time low, 50 pounds overweight and close to a habitual drinking problem.  

I started wheezing on the treadmill and lifting some weights but I liked how I felt after running more than anything else.  I kept a modest workout schedule, running 3-4 times a week and crossfit or weights twice a week.  Over the next couple years, I did the 5ks, 10ks and halfs and completed my first marathon this last April 7th.  A complete lifehack.  And I was happy.

About 8pm the night before my first marathon, April 6th, my mother calls me and tells me that my dad has been rushed to the ER with chest pains.  Him being overweight, diabetic, and in poor health Im thinking the worst.  I stay with him in the hospital until about midnight.  He in stable condition and being admitted and is apologizing to me about being there, that ""he's sorry that he's there, that he knows how hard Ive worked and he wanted to be there at the finish line for me.""  Gawd, it was sad.

So I get back home around 1am.  I know the race is about 30 min away so I must leave by 7:45 to park and make the 830am start.  At 2am I'm laying wide awake in my bed, freaking out over my dad, freaking out over even being able to run in the morning.  But I wanted to complete it and I was determined to.  I'm still not sure how much sleep I got, 4 hours?

Race day.  My wife and I get to the starting line and surprisingly I don't feel too bad.  It was an out and back course and she wanted to help me so the plan was for her to run the first 6 miles with me, then she would stop at the aid station and volunteer there and help out (the 20 mile mark on the way back) and I would pick her up and we would run the last 6.2 together.  

When she saw me after running 20 miles she was probably concerned for my health.  I had slowed way down around mile 18.  I was hitting the wall and I knew it.  My legs didn't feel too bad just the engine inside me was drained of fuel.  But being determined and stubborn there was no way in hell I wasn't going to finish.  She picked me up and we shuffled along until I finished.  We finished together.  My wife is awesome and beautiful and Im not sure if I could have done it without her.  It was tough.  I finished in 4:47:00.

I felt good in the following days and picked up some slow miles the next week.  I started slowly building a base again.  I knew the time of that marathon wasn't great but I wanted to run farther.  I told my wife about a 50k trailrun that just so happened to be taking place on the trail system that is 5 mins from my house and I run them weekly.  She told me that I was crazy..."" you barely finished that marathon and you want to run 5 miles farther on trails with more hills?!!!""

I knew that my stress the night before the race and lack of sleep probably affected the slow time of my marathon more than anything else.  Training went well other than a little Achilles issue near my taper but I learned a lot about myself from that run.. A lot about being determined to finish and even though I was physically drained at the end of that marathon I knew I had the drive to finish. I believe I can complete any distance if I train for it.

I started secretly looking up 50k training plans on the interwebs.  Yes, like most guys hide looking at porn, that's how I was researching training plans. 

 I signed up for it and had the confirmation sent to her email address.  She's a good sport.  She'll get over it. 

**EDIT** My dad is doing good.  He had a heart stent and has changed his diet and started walking the dog everyday.  He's lost some weight and promises me that he'll be at the finishline of the 50k.  I know I'll be there too.

For many years, I didn't run because I was afraid of hurting my knee again.

What if I mess up my knee again and have to get surgery again and then I'm immobile again and I lose all my progress, again...

Then yesterday, it finally happened.  I tripped on the sidewalk, couldn't get my other foot under me fast enough, and fell to my hands and knees.  My palms were torn up, my knees bruised and scraped.  But I was okay.  I fell, I was terrified, and nothing awful came of it.  I stood up, shook it off, and ran four more miles.

For years, I had let that fear of falling loom so large in my mind that I didn't do anything that would potentially injure my knee.  I was so afraid of a crippling injury that I crippled myself with fear instead.  But fuck that.  I'm a survivor, and I have the road rash to prove it.

~~~~~

Well, I guess I did it. I ran the Chicago Marathon today, and I must say it wasn't what I expected.

I started off excellent. I was able to get to the very front of wave 2 (which started 30 minutes after wave 1), so that basically means that for a few miles, while the rest of the race panned out, I was able to run basically a new race.

I'd like to protect my identity, so I'm going to be a bit general here.
I came in with a goal of getting under 2:50, but a hard goal of 2:42. Through sixteen miles, I was feeling great, and even running a bit faster than that (averaged around 6:09 pace, hit the half at 1:20). But then, mile 17 came... and it got all uphill from there. I ran a 6:43 mile 17, and mile 18 was a 7:28, and from then on, it was consistent 8:40s until the end, finishing in the mid-2:50's. 

I don't know, I guess I was over-confident, or thought I was tough enough to push through it... but you guys really weren't joking when you said that the wall is the worst pain in the world. I've never experienced anything like that. That feeling off burning hips, thousand-pound legs, feeling your calves straining, feet hurting... wow. I was blown away by how painful all of that was. And I let my ego get in the way of that.

I was still able to qualify for Boston, though, so that's exciting. Hopefully I'll be able to make it out there. And I got top 3 in my age division. So I guess I really can't complain.

But honestly, it was a learning experience, being my first marathon and all. And I cannot wait to do it again. Marathons may suck at some points, but that feeling of hitting the last corner and crossing that finish line is simply incredible. I highly recommend it to those on the fence about it.

If you have read this far, I appreciate it. Even if you don't comment. It's nice having someone, even for a little bit, care about what I have to say. Please post though, if you feel like having a conversation.

1366741635.0,135,self.running,1cy9o6,Race Report - Boston Marathon,163,28,53,http://www.reddit.com/r/running/comments/1cy9o6/race_report_boston_marathon/,"A little late with this post, but I stretched my trip to Boston into a week long trip and followed it up with a music festival (which, incidentally, has helped my leg recovery!), so I am just now making it back to a computer.  Here's the usual race report (aka giant wall of text) for the few major races I do a year, enjoy!

**Training**

I qualified for Boston 2013 at Santa Rosa marathon in August 2012.  This left me with ~7.5 months to recover, re-base, and ramp up mileage leading into this month.  I decided to go with a 4 month buildup (16 weeks) which left me with 3.5 months to recovery and establish a solid base again.

Recovery from Santa Rosa included essentially nothing.  I ran once a week for 2 weeks and then 2-3 times a week for another 2 weeks.  No watch, no pacing.  Always nice to have some unstructured running time!

After recovery, I wanted to ramp up to 50 mile weeks until December, so I pretty much ran 20, 30, 40, 50 and then held 50 until Christmas time.  I tracked my distance, but didn't really track pacing except for weekly tempo runs with a group I run with.  Again, lack of structure was pretty nice that far out from a race.  I hurt my back a little bit playing golf before xmas, and then skiing a bunch on it in the ensuing snow storms (powder!! Worth it!), but I was back on the horse in full swing by new years.

The 16 week buildup (now 15), loosely followed the Pfitzinger 18/70 plan (18 weeks, 70 miles peak).  I was already at 50 mpw, so jumping into the plan 3 weeks after it was designed to start was not a problem.  I say 'loosely followed' because I re-structured to plan to conform to weekly tempo runs with a run group and Saturday long runs.  Everything else fell out of that.

As usual, I had a couple of key goals for my training:

1. Miles.  I wanted to hit 70 mpw and feel good about it (I think most 50 mpw runners could run a shitty 70 mile week and feel pretty wrecked by the end).  This meant diligent ramp up with multiple weeks in the mid 60s and high 60s through February and early March.

2. Hills.  Boston is known for crushing runners in miles 16-20 through the Newton Hills and Heartbreak Hill.  I wanted to feel pretty strong at the end of these hills because I knew a strong finish would be necessary to make up for the pace drop on the ascent.  To add hill strength, I would run hill sprints (10-20 seconds x10) to finish medium length workouts, I ran my long runs on as hilly terrain as I could find, and I added some pure hill workouts with lots of 2-4 minutes hill climb efforts.

Additionally, I added some upper body (13-15 rep x3 sets) lifting once a week to get a little more endurance and pop out of my arms.

A typical week would look like this:

* M: Tempo, 8.5-12 miles with 3.5-7 miles at pace.
* T: Recovery 5-6
* W: Moderate 8-12
* Th: Recovery 5-6
* Fr: Moderate 8-12
* Sat: Long 17-24
* Sun: Moderate 5-10

**Taper**

Taper plan was pretty simple: 40, 30, 20 miles per week.  I am pretty relaxed about taper, so it ended up being like 38, 28, 15.  Most of the runs consisted of 1 mile warm up, marathon pace running, 1 mile warm down.  Taper started 21 days out, and I had big tempo workouts 19 and 11 days out before I stopped anything faster than marathon pace.  4 days out I did nothing but easy runs to stay loose, and I also previewed Heartbreak Hill and the preceeding Newton hill to get an idea of how hard they are (surprisingly mild, but opportunely placed for a decent amount of pain in-race).

**Race**

I got dropped off by my Aunt's family at the State Park in Hopkinton at about 7:45 am on race day to take the shuttle to the starting area.  Much preferable to taking the bus, so I've heard.  I was able to wake up at around 6am as opposed to 4am to get to downtown and catch a bus.

I sat around for a while, did about a mile warmup jog with some pacing in the middle, and started to make my way to the starting line at around 9:15.  By the time I had dropped my bag off and prepared it was about 9:45, so I only had to spend about 15 minutes in the corral, which was nice.

When the gun for the pro-men went off, it took me about 2 minutes to cross the starting line (I was in wave 1, corral 4).

The first 3 miles of the race were pretty uneventful.  I was worried that I was caught in the crowd and going too slowly (started at over 7 minute pace), but after a bit the crowd started to pick up and the first split was an acceptable 6:52.  Coming down the hills and seeing the road packed shoulder to shoulder with runners as far as the eye could follow was pretty amazing.  Such a big race!

I ended up finding a dude that I raced with at LA Marathon last year and said what's up.  We cruised together for a while, but he started to fade about 12 miles in (I guess he was injured for a month or so), so I didn't see him again.

The rest of the first half was actually pretty uneventful as well.  I was worrying a little about my legs because they felt so heavy, but I resolved to run by feel and not break myself to early.  I wanted to hit a 1:28 first half but ended up at 1:30:05.  This was a bad sign for hitting my goal time of sub 3:00:00, but I wasn't gonna go all-or-nothing at Boston, so I was OK with it.  Running through Wellesley was pretty insane, I could barely hear because of all the yelling from the girls, but it was the first of many sections that were amazing from all the crowd support.

Miles 13-15 were a little rough and I'm not sure why.  Perhaps my nutrition was a little lacking through there, but I'm not sure.

Mile 16 is where the Newton Hills start.  I had some family at the Washington Street overpass who handed me some liquid calories (Gu Rocktane Endurance Drink) which I drank over the next 4 miles.  The hills themselves were not too bad.  I slowed my pace for fear of blowing up (hill chops were as-yet untested), but I ended up running 7:18, 7:21, 7:05, 7:19, 7:29 through the hills and up Heartbreak Hill.

At the top of Heartbreak Hill, I checked the clock and I realized that I would have to run ~6:20/mile pace to break 3 hours, which was not happening.  This was a little disappointing, but also relieving, because I knew I could still hold out for sub 3:05 (re-qualifying time).  The other thing that felt great was that my legs felt decently strong and I was able to hold 6:49 averages from there until the mile 25 marker.

EDIT: Clarity.  Thanks Seydar!

At mile 25, I could feel the wheels starting to come off, but I knew that 1.2 miles to go was nothing I hadn't hammered through before, so I hammered it out averaging about 7:15/mile for the remainder, crossing at 3:03:47.

**Nutrition**

I tried something new this time around:  2 shot bloks 30 mins before the start, 1xGu 15 minutes before the start, and then 1 shot blok per mile until mile 10, followed by liquid calories at mile 16-20.  I drank water at every water stop and it certainly helped me avoid stomach cramps from the shot bloks.  I also took a SaltStick Tab at mile 5, 10 and 15.

EDIT: I ran with one of [these](http://www.flipbelt.com/the-flipbelt/) and I highly recommend it.  Sat comfortably under my singlet and held the salt tabs and 4 sleeves of shot bloks comfortably and tightly, so there was no bouncing as with pockets, or chafing like with fanny packs.

**Afterwards**

My overall impression of the race was incredible.  The crowd support was insane.  Better than any race I've ever done, because they are pretty much non-stop for 26 miles.  The race was impeccably run, and the value was high (great expo, a pre-race dinner, and a post-race party (cancelled), all included in the race fee).  The chance to run on such a storied course was also an amazing experience, and I felt lucky every step of the way.

The comraderie at the finish line was completely unexpected.  At a race where there are more than a handful of serious runners finishing at 3:00-ish, it's awesome to talk it out with everyone who had been feeding off of each other in the final miles.

I ended up being nowhere near the bombings, as I had finished and was on the subway when it all happened, so I was pretty much unaffected.  I think we can all agree that what happened was terrible, so I'll limit my comments to running related topics.  My post race was completely thrown off by the events that occurred.  Normally I process my race over and over again to figure out what to work on for next race, but I'm just now beginning to think about what to work on over the summer.  I hope the other runners who did not get the stellar race experience that I got will get another chance to run the Boston Marathon and receive an official time/finishing experience.",,False,,t5_2qlit,1366770488.0,,,True,t3_1cy9o6,http://www.reddit.com/r/running/comments/1cy9o6/race_report_boston_marathon/,

It was hot, almost 20 something when we started at 9AM climbing go 30C in the noon. But fortunately I managed to finish it in good condition. 

My plan was to go for 4:30 although I didn't have idea if I can make it. I was running 1:05 - 1:10 per 10km on my longer runs. 
I would probably do it, if I'd sticked  pacemakers team that were running for 4:30. But for the 15km I was feeling good and thought I can run faster. They caught me at ~30km and couple kilometers later I couldn't follow them. I was doing walking breaks, during all watering stations, every 5km and also some in between. I poured lots of water on my hat, head since it was really really hot and sunny.

But still I'm very happy that I finished this event, being able to make it to the end, feeling nice atmosphere of race and just enjoy the run (except last couple kilometers when I thought I won't run any more marathons in future - that feeling passed just after I entered last straight and passed finish line ;-)))

Atmosphere was great. There we people on streets cheering at us, smiling, there was some band, playing straight on the street from someones doors, some runners had costumes. It was all fan. I'm really glad I did it.

1276720980.0,132,self.running,cfr68,How To Run Faster and Longer,148,16,54,http://www.reddit.com/r/running/comments/cfr68/how_to_run_faster_and_longer/,"Well, I posted this in an old thread in IWTL, but it seemed kind of pointless because it was an old thread and only about 2 or 3 people will ever read it. So I'm just going to repost it in here.

I had the mile run coming up last school year. I really wanted to cut off some time, so after a whole lot of research, practice, and healthy eating, I managed to cut off 2 1/2 minutes (from 8:45 to 6:15) in only 2 months for my mile run. I'm not an overweight guy. I'm actually well underweight. The main problem I had was that 95% of the info I could find online was about ""weight loss"", something I'm not concerned with... So, out of all the other information, this is what I've gathered in that time-span:


One of the main things that you should focus on is your form:

* Don't step farther out in front of underneath your body when you run. When you do, you're having to spend extra energy to push your body over your foot, when you should be stepping underneath you, and letting yourself just ""fall"" into your next step. 

* Try to step in front or near in front of the other foot. Wide steps while running can put out force to the side, when you want to be going forward instead.

* Keep your back straight, but let yourself bend at the waist by 10 degrees or less forward. This also lets you ""fall"" forward into the next step. Slouching can make it harder to breathe.

* I've heard that you shouldn't bounce at all when running, but I've never had significant problems with bouncing. Just do what's most comfortable to you.

* The leg forms a natural spring to avoid shock when you land mid-to-forefoot. Try not to land on your heels when running.

* Deep breaths! Avoid shallow breathing at all costs. You may get side stitches and you'll **really** want to take short breaths, but don't do it! If you practice taking deep, rhythmic breaths (even when you're not running), you'll eventually do it naturally and not even have to think about it to do it. Try to use all of your lungs.

* If you're running for distance, take short strides. If you're running for speed, take long strides. Really, whether a certain distance is long or short is up to you. It really depends on the pace you want to take and how much energy you're willing to spend.

* When running, create a figure 4 by lifting your knee up to have your shin parallel to the ground and pull with your hamstring. 



Diet also plays an important role in how you run:

* Eat plenty of complex carbs. Things like bread, pasta, potatoes, and other foods are good sources. The night before any big run, you'll want to load up on these.

* Protein can't hurt either. Abundant in meats and dairy products, protein can help you build the muscles necessary to become a great runner.

* Avoid simple carbs, like sugars. Sugars and junk food can hinder your performance, and it'll be more obvious while you run. Try to stay as healthy as you can, especially when big races are coming up.

* Drink lots of water. Some herbal teas and juices can also hydrate. Milk, soft drinks, beer, and coffee are weak hydrators, so you shouldn't rely on them for hydration.



Practice!

* Get a running partner. It really helps motivate you to put in more effort.

* Try waking up early and run before school/work. You may not feel like it when you wake up, but you'll definitely feel great throughout the day. 

* Run long distances and short distances. Try to mix it up, so you're body better adapts to your exercises.

* Hills may seem like your worst enemy, but they're great for working different muscles.

* Warm up your muscles before running by doing a steady jog. This can help prevent injuries and get your blood pumping for harder workouts. Stretch after runs, this can help keep you from feeling too sore afterwards.

* In cold weather, you might want to wear gloves, cap, warm socks. Your body will redirect the heat from your extremities (toes, fingers, penis), to your necessities (heart, lungs), so try to keep them warm.

* Try not to eat immediately before running. You can get sick, and you can get cramps or side stitches. Give yourself from 45 minutes to 2 hours after eating (depending on how large the meal was).

* Get some carbs and protein in soon after running. The period of about 45 minutes immediately after running will be your most beneficial time for absorbing nutrients.

* Be careful and watch your step!

* You can build distance by increasing your weekly base mileage.

* You can build speed by interval training. Run fast for a period of time, then jog or walk for another period, then repeat.



Some last things:

* Record your distances and times in a log or journal. Try to focus on getting faster and longer times! 

* Get some rest every once in awhile (two or three days a week will be fine). You don't have to not run on your rest days, so a light jog will be fine if you're willing.

* Your shins might get sore if you're starting out (shin splints). Getting new insoles for my shoes helped a lot for me. Give more time for your shins to recover, and run on soft surfaces (not concrete) if you're still having problems.

* If you start feeling dizzy or light-headed, it'll be a good idea to stop and rest immediately.

* Don't run in brand new shoes on important race days. You'll want to jog a lot in them before hand so you can adjust to them and they can adjust to you.

* Challenge yourself! You can't get a better mile time until you *try* to get a better mile time!



**Don't be afraid to look up info about running on the internet!** Just try to check several sources on each topic, so you'll know that you're not being misinformed. I encourage you to look up extra info about things that I've mentioned, or haven't mentioned. I may have forgot a few things, so do some research!

Good luck out there!

Running has not only helped my physically but also mentally.  I am so much happier, confident, and open to new things now than I ever was before.  It is a wonderful outlet for anything.  Whether you are having a great week or a terrible week, running will just add to it.

Also in between those 2 pictures were 2 5ks, 3 half marathons, and countless training/fun runs!  Running/exercise in general has become so integrated into my life I feel bad when I neglect it.

1) When beginning to run (zero fitness) always go slow and continue running slow for 2-3 months. Be very careful about mixing in a fast run cause it could set you up for a nagging injury that may not heal. Build a solid base first. Be patient and speed will follow.

2) Stretch IT band or whatever your weakness regularly.

3) Don't assume footwear is good (old or new)- One of my Achilles tendons started acting up - it took me 4 months to realize my new sneakers were the direct cause. Very annoying.

Your hamstring may go south, your knee may go south, your ankle, a toenail. Name a body part, it might misbehave. You may trip and fall down over one of ten thousand roots or rocks; you may even fall off a cliff. You might dump your iPod in a river, leave your water bottle at an aid station, get stung by angry wasps, follow the wrong trail to nowhere, put your foot down on a rattlesnake, do a face plant in a rock garden, get blisters on top of blisters, throw up, lose heart, get dizzy, or get to the end of your rope. The trick is to realize ahead of time that anything can happen, so when something does happen, you don’t get discouraged and think, “Oh, something went wrong, I guess this is not my day.” Something is always going to go wrong, for you and everybody else, but it can still be your day.

Whenever I run at night, I take the same route: straight down a busy main road that goes past several 24-hour gas stations/restaurants, plus the police station (so there are always a lot of cops passing by). I got to the top of this really steep hill (the 3 mile mark where I turn around) and stopped to stretch out and check my pace, catch my breath, etc.

All of a sudden, this car pulls up next to me (going the same direction- I had been running against traffic but turned around so I was on the right side of the road) and this guy motions for me to get in. I didn't know what to say, so I kind of shook my head and looked around, like ""Is he for real right now?"" He motions again, and I said ""Um, NO. No."" He rolled his window up and drove away. Obviously I'm freaked out- there was a rape in the area a few months ago and I've been strongly advised to not run alone (that's a different post altogether). The thing is, this hill is about three blocks from the police station where there's ALWAYS 1-2 cop cars that I have to run right in front of- I could see a police officer as this whole thing was going down. As he pulls away, I memorize his license plate number and type it into my phone and start power walking towards the nearest police car. 

I get a block closer and the guy comes back AGAIN from the opposite direction, takes a left, pulls in front of me (blocking me from crossing the street) and ""apologizes"" for the previous incident. I'm still not sure what the proper response is here so I just said ""Ha. Um. Yeah, it's fine."" He pulls around into a driveway nearby- this time I'm able to get a vehicle description. Once I realized he had stopped and wasn't going to get any further away, I *bolted* for the police car. I waved down the officer, gave him all the info, and got a ride home (I wasn't down with this guy being able to follow me for three more miles). 

**TL;DR** Had some guy try to get me in his car while running at night, got to ride home with a cop.

I've honestly never had any problems running at night aside from the occasional sexual harassment from passerby. Since I've been working and going to school and the heat has been bad during the day, I've only had the chance to run at night, which means running this route. Lately I've been getting really sick of it and thinking about going through some residential routes- NOPE. I've definitely been reminded that there are reasons I use that route- lots of 24-hour businesses, cops, and traffic. I don't even want to know how that scenario could have played out if I didn't have safe spots every quarter mile or less. 

Anyways, I really just posted because I know you can get bored/comfortable and want to let your guard down. I never thought something like that would happen to me, and I'm glad my paranoia paid off.

I was out on my run, a pleasant 4-miler along the Creek that I do on a regular basis.  About 3/4 of the way through, I saw a runner in the distance slowing to a walk, but that's just a part of running sometimes, plus there are tons of walk-runners, so I didn't make any special note of it. 

Going at a steady clip, I eventually caught up to her and I was about to pass her when she started running again, just going all out.  It wasn't that much faster than my pace, but enough that she pulled ahead.  Almost immediately, she slowed down and seemed to be looking behind her.  Seeing me, she sped up again.  Sure enough, within a few feet, she slowed down again, I caught up with her, she looked behind, saw me, and sped up again.  She did this 3-4 times.  During this whole sequence, I was keeping along at my regular pace. 

After the 4th time, she stopped, whirled around, and said in the nastiest tone I've heard in a while, ""Oh, go ahead.  You've been trying to,"" with this expansive gesture as if she was doing me a great favor.  I was completely taken aback.  I just went along my way, though, confused but still trying to focus on my running.  Almost immediately, I heard her coming up behind me.  She ran past me, even though I could tell she was struggling with it.  This time she stopped almost immediately, and, as I passed her, she said, ""Oh, fine! Yeah, go ahead.  I hope that feels good for you.""

I registered for $60 per person 3/5/13, and the next day they released a living social for $35 / person.  On 3/27/13 they pushed the event from 4/13, less than 3 weeks before the race.  They said the reason was they needed a bigger venue aka: over sold or didn’t get the right permits.  Sometime around here they changed it from a 5 mile to a 5K in length.  No Refund!  Race Day:  $10 to park (why?) and 15 min wait to get your bib and t-shirt.  We did get our headbands, but they ran out soon after that.  Not organized, shirt size was what you told them, not what you registered for, so they were running out of some sizes.  I found out the living social people did not get a shirt, BBQ lunch or beer.  They did not know this when they signed up.  We watched the 10:00 wave start out of the gate, only to stack up at the first obstacle 75 yards ahead.  We immediately lined up for our 10:30 wave.  They did not regulate the waves, instead letting people run regardless of what they signed up for.  The living social people didn’t even get a chance to sign up for waves.  The whole reason for waves is to keep the course flowing, what were they thinking?  Obstacles advertised as 14 over a 3.1 mile course.  Ended up being 12 over a 2 mile course.

1.	Mud pit with bungee cord to crawl under.  Good sized pit, but most people just walked under it without getting that muddy.
2.	Tires 4 tires to cross. Joke obstacle.  My buddy tweaked his ankle because the ground inside one tire was not level.
3.	Slant wall up and down with spaces between the boards, ~ 8 foot tall.
4.	Bungees stretched between trees about 3 foot high 15’ long.  Joke obstacle
5.	4’, 6’ &amp; 8’ walls with gaps in the boards so you can climb them like a ladder.  Maybe they count this as 3 obstacles.
6.	YES! 15 foot wall rope climb NOPE! shut down.  Someone fell and there was no cushion or mud to break the fall.  EMS shut it down before our wave, because it was not safe.
7.	Mud hole about 6’ x 4’, everyone just ran the edge.
8.	After running through the woods for a little while, came to a complete stop waiting in line for a mud wall obstacle.  Waited for what seemed like 30 minutes, and they ended up shutting it down.  This wait for the obstacle included at least the 9:30 and 10:00 wave people.  The obstacle looked like a 10 foot dirt ledge with a rope to help climb up it.
9.	Because the waves are really stacked up by now, we waited about 10 minutes to go through the 4’ tubes positioned in watery mud.  Was able to flag down my friend spectating to bring us some water, because they didn’t have any on the course.
10.	Ice pit turned out being a 4’ x 6’ x 3’ foot deep, cool water pit.
11.	5 min wait Inflatable run?  I think this was a bungee run inflatable.  You run down it about 30’ and hop over the back wall.  Joke
12.	15 min wait, Obstacle inflatable.  This was right after the previous one.  The reason the wait was so long is none of the event people were regulating the course.  This one had some obstacles  to climb through, Then you had to scale a 12 slanted wall and slid down.  The problem was there were so many people crammed in, it was caving in.  Then the wall didn’t have anywhere to grab.  With it slicked down from the previous runners, the footholds don’t work.  10 minutes of my wait was watching some poor girl trying to climb and keep slipping down.  There was no way to go back or around at that point,  because of the people stacked up.  We yelled ahead for the people to help her, and they were finally able to heave her over.  We had people in our team, so we were able to work together to get through it.

Done in about 1.5 hours.  Clean up station was standing in the mud while someone shot you with a fire hose, and someone standing at the back of a truck with a garden hose.  

Time for my well-deserved beer and as advertised at sign up, a BBQ plate.  Got our beer and went to the BBQ line.  Ended up being uncooked sausage wraps (tortilla and sausage) and a bag of chips.  

We wanted to stay for the Jack Ingram concert.   The cow pasture where the stage was had no shade anywhere.  There was no other food to even purchase, just raw sausage wraps.  We heard the fitness place had free pizza, but they ran out.   It’s about 12:30 now and 90 degrees outside.  Well there is still beer.  We had a team of more than 10 so we were should have received an extra beer ticket.  We could not find anyone there that knew how we could do this.  I would have brought a shade and some food to wait for the 8:00 Jack Ingram concert, but the FAQ had nothing like this on what to bring.  In fact it said no outside food and beverages allowed.

No one there could tell us who was in charge, or who to complain to.  We were all so upset and defeated, that we gave up and went home.

 I feel sorry for the people signing up for their Mud, Obstacles &amp; Zombies race in San Antonio TX, Oct 26 &amp; 27.  I want to know how much of my registration fee went Make-A-Wish, and how much went to profit.  Every time I watch that video on their website, I get more pissed off.  They show real obstacles and even state five miles on the video.   If you know of a way to stop these people from doing this again, please do.

tl;dr Rip off. Terrible event and planning.

If you're not ready to race with the big boys in one of those half-marathon, hellacious obstacle nightmares, but are ready to graduate from a run-of-the-mill 5K, we've got the race for you. Sure, there are the obligatory mud crawl, balance beam, and incline walls - but you're also up against monster obstacles like the flames of fury - rows and rows of fire that require a brave leap - followed by the ice bath, a long pool of burning-cold ice water that prescribe a dive and a swim (not recommended for guys with tight shorts). And once you've bested the barricades, managed the moat, and surpassed your perceived limitations, kick back at the post race BBQ with a cold beer and mud-strewn grin. In 2013, find out what you're made of at the one-and-only Gut Check Challenge.

In fact, my runs became the highlight of my days, although that might speak more to the year I'm having than my enjoyment of these runs. But anyway, last Friday I finished a 9 mile run for the first time in my life (in 77 minutes!), and I was absolutely ecstatic. I was a few weeks away from hitting my 13 mile goal; my 2 mile times were plummeting each week (11:55!); and after months of running in snow, sleet, wind, hail, and sub freezing temperatures, the weather is finally warming up enough for me to delayer and enjoy the scenery. Everything was coming up Millhouse. 

But then I felt it. A sharp, distinct pain in the mid-outer part of my left foot. I've rested, iced, and elevated during the past two days in the hopes that it was just a strain or a some minor injury and not those two words every runner dreads hearing. **stress fracture**. But the pain continues to persist to the point where I've set up an appointment with a podiatrist. And although I haven't received an official diagnosis yet, I'm expecting the worst. 

And I'm absolutely crushed. Not because I won't be able to run the tough mudder (there will always be other races), but because running has been one of the only constants in what has been a shit year for me. I'm going to try biking and maybe the elliptical, but I was wondering if anyone out there had any tips for substitute exercises I could do, things to help with recovery, etc...

I am a grad student and therefore way too broke to afford brand name GU Gels. So here is the best and simplest recipe I have found:

-50% Honey
-25% Brown Rice Syrup
-25% Blackstrap Molasses

Taste: taste was a bit like a ginger snap cookie dipped in honey

How to bring it with you:
This sort of baffled me for a bit, but you can buy anywhere from 1-5oz travel shampoo bottles for cheap and reuse them. I just stick it in my running belt and carry on.

SIMPLE AS THAT! ENJOY!


edit: just went to Bed Bath and Beyond and got the 2oz bottle you guys see here in the pic below for 99 cents.

It means a lot to hear a complete stranger say these words to you. There's no way you could have known I was in the middle of a ten miler, doing some speed work (mostly because I needed to use the restroom ;) ), there's no way you could have known that I'd held down a 9 minute mile for 2 miles consistently and was so pumped. All you knew was I was out there, and maybe that inspired you! I know your words and kindness inspired me.  Thank you!!


I just wanted to share this with you fellow runners! So often,  I hear of people yelling rude crap out car windows.
