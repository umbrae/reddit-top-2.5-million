You will do endless experiments and perform endless analysis to find that the data is just generally shit.

Grid cells were discovered in the entorhinal cortex in 2005 by the Moser group, communicated in the paper ""Microstructure of a spatial map in the entorhinal cortex"". Much like place cells, grid cells fire when an animal is physically occupying a certain part of a room, only rather than only firing in a single place, the cells seem to respond to a triangular lattice ""grid"" of spaces.

http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v436/n7052/abs/nature03721.html

Here's a non-paywalled link: https://www.princeton.edu/~njclub/2007-06-27_papers/Hafting+etal_2005.pdf


It's an open theoretical question about how these kinds of non-intrinsic maps of space are formed. The fundamental issue seems to be the idea of internal integration of velocity information. Two main theoretical models have since arisen to try and explain this phenomena. I don't have a good citation on theta oscillation models of grid cells, but the ***continuous attractor model*** of grid cells starts with a 2009 PLOS Computational Biology paper (open access!) from Burak and Fiete ""Accurate Path Integration in Continuous Attractor Network Models of Grid Cells"".

http://www.ploscompbiol.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pcbi.1000291


More recent work from Sreenivasan and Fiete has suggested that the grid cell networks might be extraordinarily error resistant in ""Grid cells generate an analog error-correcting code for singularly precise neural computation""

http://www.nature.com/neuro/journal/v14/n10/full/nn.2901.html

NP: https://clm.utexas.edu/fietelab/Papers/nn.2901.pdf


Now for the recent results. 3 papers published in the most recent issue of Nature Neuroscience, and 1 in the most recent issue of Nature. 

First up, the Mosers have two results. The first seems to be that entorhinal cortex, despite being considered upstream of the hippocampus in most circuit diagrams, seems to depend on recurrent hippocampal input in order to form its grid structure. A reversible lesion of hippocampus seems to knock out the receptive field structure of these entorhinal cells. The Burak and Fiete model predicts that a sea of mostly uniform, slightly head-direction tuned input is enough to form grid structure, so the authors hypothesize that hippocampus might be the source of this nonspecific input.

""Grid cells require excitatory drive from the hippocampus""
http://www.nature.com/neuro/journal/v16/n3/full/nn.3311.html


Second, from the same lab, *in vitro* slice work appears to show that layer 2 spiny stellate cells (but not the giant pyramidal cells of layer 2) in entorhinal cortex seem to show a largely recurrent inhibitory network, with no excitatory connections. This confirms yet another prediction of the Burak and Fiete model - that grid cells arise out of a purely inhibitory ""Mexican Hat"" connectivity profile.

""Recurrent inhibitory circuitry as a mechanism for grid formation""
http://www.nature.com/neuro/journal/v16/n3/full/nn.3310.html


Two more papers have done a very impressive job of patch-clamping neurons *in vivo* with a rodent walking around a virtual track. The first is work out of Michael Hausser's group, and the second is work out of David Tank's group. Both show similar results: that it is slow fluctuations in membrane potential, rather than peaks in the membrane potential theta oscillation envelope, that seem to bring about tuned spiking in grid cells.

""Cellular mechanisms of spatial navigation in the medial entorhinal cortex""
http://www.nature.com/neuro/journal/v16/n3/full/nn.3340.html

""Membrane potential dynamics of grid cells""

Many places are not able to take on new staff or are even forcing their employees to have furloughs. As a soon-to-graduate science major, this is really hitting me hard as well. Two government-funded labs have had to deny my hiring after the budget cuts were introduced. NIH funding, I believe, is going to 10% to 7.5%, which is a pretty big difference. At a conference last year, I was told that for every $1 put into the NIH, $8 was profited. NIH research is integral to science. Many studies are critical to improving our healthcare. The first lab I was going to work in explored pharmacological treatments of autism, and the second is looking at treatments for soldiers affected by nerve agents. I just can't believe the US would cut funding to such important things. NASA, which I think should be funded, is not quite as broad as the NIH (I think).

The debate revolves around two classes of cortical inhibitory interneurons - those that express parvalbumin (PV+) and primarily synapse on the main cell bodies of excitatory pyramidal neurons, and those that express somatostatin (SOM+) and primarily synapse on the distal dendrites of pyramidal neurons. 

The two labs use the same imaging techniques (in vivo two-photon laser imaging), both use anesthetized preps and are both looking in primary visual cortex (V1). Yet the labs come to truly opposite conclusions for the functional roles of these two classes of interneurons.

All numbers are rough, but originate from my googling for some reasonable statistics. Success rates come from ""opinion pieces"" about bleak perspectives of recent PhDs that appear every now and then, while salaries are rough averages from the glassdoor.com.

Looking for help.,60,15,118,http://www.reddit.com/r/neuro/comments/16xzqx/crossposting_to_multiple_medical_subreddits_my/,"Hi everyone. I am really sorry if this is the wrong subreddit for posting this but I'm hoping and praying that somebody here has *any* advice for us.

This will be long but it needs to be in order for me to accurately describe my fiancé's symptoms.

He is almost 25, if that helps.


I met my fiancé, Keagan, about 3 years ago. When we first started seeing one another things were fine for about a month. Then one night, he suddenly started acting really strange, almost like he'd been drinking. He was slurring his speech, hadblurry vision, was having trouble walking straight and was basically just ""out of it."" I didn't know what was going on but I took care of him and he soonly after fell asleep. When he woke up, he was fine. As if it had never happened. I brought it up and he had no recollection of even being that way. He could remember the day just fine up to that point, then told me it was probably due to his multiple sclerosis. So I looked that up online and the symptoms fit (being how widespread symptoms can be for MS...). He told me he hadn't been ""officially"" diagnosed with MS because after being tested many times, he still hadn't shown any lesions.

As time went on, his symptoms got more and more severe. The speech will go from being slurred to entirely incomprehensible, where the most he can manage to ""say"" just sounds like ""Unnnghh."" He can't walk at all sometimes during these episodes. I've had to actually drag him or pull him to a couch. His eyes will droop so that he looks asleep but he isn't. He doesn't seem to know what is happening around him when it happens. I've had to help him go to the bathroom, take lit cigarettes from him because he has dropped them onto himself without even noticing.

These symptoms come and go and the severity changes every time. Sometimes it is as described above and sometimes it's just *slightly* slurred speech and you can barely notice.

These episodes can happen once a week, once a month, once every three months, it's so sporadic and hard to understand! They can last just one day or several days. It's really scary.

He also has chronic, constant pain on one entire side of his body from the top of his head to the bottom of his foot. No idea why. He said these symptoms all started when he was about 20 years old and the pain used to apparently be tolerable but now is bad at best and at times even excruciating. 

Anyway, he went to another doctor who then said, ""No. It's not MS, it's fibromyalgia."" OK, correct me if I'm wrong but these symptoms just do not fit. 

So he's seen many doctors, neurologists, had CAT scans and MRIs done and this is as far as we've gotten. I need answers. He needs help. He hasn't had an episode in probably 2-3 months but it's never been more than about 3 months so I know one will be coming soon, most likely. He's even gone to the ER **during** these flare-ups and all they do is hook him up to an IV and he stays til he's better. Again, never any answers.


Oh, also, his sleeping is extremely messed up. He can rarely sleep. He's either in too much pain, or inexplicably anxious/nervous, can't get comfortable, or some other reason. He can go DAYS without ANY sleep. He just went three entire nights without any sleep until last night when he finally got about five hours.


Has anyone got any idea what this may be? Or what else we can do since the doctors seem clueless? I hate seeing him suffer. 

I'm going to crosspost this to as many subreddits as I can to try and get different perspectives.


Thank you so much for taking the time to read this and again I'm very sorry if this post doesn't belong here.


**Edited to add:
He says [Morvan's Syndrome](http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morvan's_syndrome) is the closest thing he's ever read to what his symptoms are. (Including hyperhidrosis which I forgot to mention - sorry!) However this is so rare that when he brought it up to his doctor he didn't even know what it was. He said he would look it up and get back to us - which he still hasn't done.**

EDIT AGAIN:
I left out another symptom - sorry. His hands and feet sometimes turn purple and are freezing to the touch. Just trying to be as specific as possible.

It is difficult to find jobs to apply to. What kind of jobs can I look for? How narrow does my focus have to be? Can I apply for jobs that I have no direct experience in but are still under the neuroscience umbrella? I feel like I have to stay in the realm of my research, which I would certainly like, but isn't practical. I don't know how to back up my interest in something that I only have classwork experience in. Does the job I get have to be close to what I want to study in graduate school or is only the lab/research experience what grad schools are looking for?

Because marijuana and its effect on the brain is a hot political topic...and I have a vested interest, I was curious about what you all think about it.
I am currently studying neuroscience in school but we haven't covered this but it is something that a lot of my friends ask me about.  I feel like there are more answers out there than I have come across.  
I read that casual use has no detrimental effects however, long term use inhibits LTP in the hippocampus, which obviously can't be good for memory. Is that all?
Are there any good resources that can explain the cannabinoid system and marijuana's effect?
What other aspects of psychological/neurological health are important to think about regarding this topic?

I find no joy in my field of work and I've been thinking of quitting for a long time now. I should also mention that I'm located in a developing country where there is virtually no research of any kind taking place. I was thinking of getting a master's degree in neuroscience, but I have no idea where to start and I was hoping that you can help clear some things up for me.

1. Is being a med school graduate a positive or a negative, as opposed to, say, majoring in neuroscience in college? What are my chances of getting into a master's degree program? (I realize this is a vague question, but I'm only looking for a general idea)

2. Is a master's degree enough to find a job in research, or will I have to get a PhD too.

3. I'm really interested in neuroimaging. How hard is it to find a position in this field with a master's degree in neuroscience (taking into account my experience in diagnostic radiology).

4. Is 27 too old to start a career in neuroscience? I found a master's degree program with a cut-off age of 26, so it sort of worried me. 

5. I'm actually working on a master's degree in diagnostic radiology in my home country. My thesis is about the ""Role of DTI in the evaluation of Alzheimer's disease"". The problem is that it's not really a ""thesis"", since it's not based on any research. It's basically a compilation of recent research papers on the subject put together to produce a glorified paper, but it's not a real thesis. My question is, should I wait and finish my master's here before applying to neuroscience programs? Will it help (even though it's not research based)? Or should I not mention it all together when applying to grad school?

For example, if it is your first time tying a knot it requires much more thought the first time around than it does later. 

The reason I am asking this is because I have epilepsy, and doing a dexterous activity for the first time causes intense dizzyness and possible auras. For example, if I were to make a piece of origami that I never had made before, I'd get too dizzy to finish it. However, I can effortlessly fold a paper airplane that i've done a million times before. 

I recently got a new job, which requires me to use a [Manual Imprinter](http://blog.nabancard.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/Manual_Imprinter.jpg) for credit card transactions, and my first few days were hell because it felt like I was going to have a seizure every time I rung somebody up. Now however I can ring people up without getting dizzy (because I've become used to and memorized the motions).

I want to find out if there is a specific region of my brain causing this problem and report it to my neurologist (I might even try some complicated origami next time I have an EEG) because nobody seems to believe me. I also hope to study neuroscience in college so I can learn more about my epilepsy and self- diagnose these things.

Here we have a multiunit recording of macaque V1 being driven by a 6-7Hz grating. You can clearly hear the units firing in tandem with the stimulus.

For those a bit less familiar with the setup: an electrode is basically a small wire that can detect small local electric changes in the brain.  When neurons fire action potentials, the electrode reads the voltage drop over a small resistance, and we can amplify that signal enough to play it over a speaker.

When the video pans over to the screen, you're looking at about 12 channels listening what is probably a small group of neurons that are visually-driven. When a spike is detected, it's displayed on screen, overlayed with previous spikes.

Here's my motivation: After working in molecular biology labs for many years, I tried my hand at some behavioral psych stuff and found that the amount of statistics I was doing increased exponentially. In a wet lab, experiments were sort of limited to ""do it three times and trust the results if it works for all three trials""; in psych, they do power analysis and effect size calculations to determine the number of trials they need, plus multivariate and stochastic analyses on the data, yadda yadda yadda. 

It seemed like wet labs didn't go through so much effort to look at the data (and why don't they, by the way? can't you calculate effect sizes for anything quantifiable that spits out numbers?), but all the neuro people I talk to say that MATLAB is awesome and wonderful and in use by every neuroscience lab. What are these labs using it for? What kind of data do labs produce that require the use of MATLAB? Was I just working in labs that were lazy with their analyses?

1361994260.0,38,self.neuro,19cgae,I am a research assistant and my grant is ending (with slim opportunities for funding). Where do I land?,45,7,21,http://www.reddit.com/r/neuro/comments/19cgae/i_am_a_research_assistant_and_my_grant_is_ending/,"Hey neuro, so I’ve reached a crossroad in a (thus far) unconventional path following my passion for science and I would love some advice about what options I have in a changing world that I still feel I know very little about. I’ll start with a brief background about me (which you can likely skip, thought it might provide some context for some folks).


I took an AP psychology class in high school that really turned me on to the subject and we covered a the gamut of information from famous psychological studies, cell layout and basic neuroanatomy, to abnormal psychology and even a tour at our local air force base’s neuroscience laboratory. I decided I would major in psychology. So I major in psychology (with a double major in music, another passion). All is great, except by the tail end I realize that most of my focus wound up being in social psychology which, while I find it interesting, isn’t the “meaty goodness” I was looking for. It felt like I was waiting for more of the “harder science” aspect of some topics I scratched the surface of in the AP class, but it never really came through. I’m also lacking in biology/chemistry backgrounds (but have a lot of music experience!). I wish was the other way around. My college also offered a program where you can get a one-year accelerated M.S. degree with decent grades. Cool. So I take it, and now have an M.S. in Professional Communication (really it’s more like marketing/advertising with a focus on working in a professional world). Sort of a silly degree, but it looks nice on paper and didn’t cost a dime.


Work at Best Buy for 6 months. Fuck that. To the present!


Move back to the city where I grew up to be closer to family and take time finding what it is I’d like to do. Get lucky, find an ideal job on craigslist, interview, get it in June of 2012. I’m now a neuropsychology technician doing the day-to-day research on cognition in autoimmune disease, and I love it. Getting my name on some small stuff, having a lot of fun doing the things I’m doing. (The M.S. degree honestly helps with recruitment too.) Thing is, with budget cuts and it being very, very hard to get funding through NIH (we’ve written 3 grant proposals in 5 months) the current grant is running out of money. That that is where my entire salary (it’s “low”, but much better than Best Buy) comes from. We are trying to extend the grant’s budget so that it won’t terminate on 5/31/13 – ending my position. I may have to go to 20 hours a week (okay) and our team is trying to find other opportunities either here or in other departments for me.


A few proposed options are: 

* Stay at 20 hours until my position ends and “find” a job somewhere else (“find” meaning it would really suck and would be another painful process… especially because of how short this position has been, since June 2012. But it’s not my fault!)

* Cut back on research and take up as a clinical neuropsychology technician instead of research (not ideal, but if you read my background I like all kinds of experience)

* Find research opportunities under other researchers that my team may know (although it may divide my time up, and it may be in something completely unrelated. Again, I like experiences… and research)


My thoughts:
I’ve been self educating on neuroscience (reading and testing myself through textbooks, finding studies that interest me) and would like to find a position doing something in the field, especially in behavioral/cognitive neuroscience. Anything affect related, communication or social related would be a dream. I want to learn more about affect regulation, I am interested in learning much more about neuroimaging and animal models, and I would like to experience and learn through research and such first-hand. I think the right neurology would be interesting as well, and this new connectome stuff is neat (I know very little about both). But… I have no background in any of these areas. No formal biology since high school. I just have passion, potential, and the drive to make it work. I guess my question is: what would you do in my situation? For someone who is heavily considering higher education in the future (but wants to learn more about what specific field through experience), what options would be ideal? What things should I steer away from? Will how short this position has been affect the next one? I don’t think neuropsychological research is in my future, but I think it intersects nicely with my neuroscience interests – what about that? Should I voice my concerns in a well-written email to my P.I. so she knows where I am coming from and can help me land softly?


Again, apologies if any of this sounds a bit immature or ignorant to reality – I’m very new to it all. It’s just something I’ve started to put my mind to and I don’t want to see it come to an end! Thanks for any and all help. I of course welcome any and all questions that might help clarify things, or that I should answer before taking the next step. I am in Denver if it makes any difference.

My background consists of 4 years in the Navy as an electrician, a BS in Environmental Business with a minor in philosophy.

I also found a position at a research lab and have been diligently volunteering for approximately 8 months.  Where many NS programs do not restrict the entrance to certain bachelor degrees I'm worried that my lack of a specific discipline focus will hinder my competitiveness.  

As for LOR my PI and an old Lt. have said they would write a LOR for me, but most programs require at three.  I'm on the fence about asking a professor in my old program since his field (environmental science) isn't really relevant to NS.  Should I ask a random biology/psychology professor whom I received high marks from that doesn't know me or ask my old professor who knows me well?

Also do I stand much of a chance (aiming at state schools) with a current GPA of 3.75 and GRE of V 162 and Q 151.

I know similar efforts exist, but reddit seems a natural platform for helping with these problems for two reasons:

1. Suppose we create a subreddit where each post is a link to a single article.  The voting system of reddit might be used as a means of expressing the relative importance of individual journal publications as decided by participating users.  In this way, important research can be frontpaged in the subreddit so that finding important research is made easier.

2. The comment system on reddit could then similarly be used for expressing scientific criticisms of the linked research article.  Each thread could naturally evolve according to user input.  In this way, important criticisms may be upvoted and be more likely to be seen.  Not all published research is credible and this could be a way of picking apart those who are not.  This criticism could also influence the score of the post as a whole, leading to poor research being downvoted and vice versa, thus supporting point one.

Of course there are probably a number of pitfalls that such a system could fall prey to.  However, as researchers should know, we learn from failed experiments in order to make better ones.

it is often referred to as ""randomly"" staining a few neurons, because no one seems to know what causes particular neurons to be filled with silver, while the surrounding neurons remain unlabeled.

do you know? has anyone been successful at deciphering some clues as to why some neurons are labeled and others are not? has anyone even tried to figure this out in the last 100+ years?

Although I would loooove to work on a magic topic that could be directly applied to humans rather than mice/rats/etc., I'm a little averse to working with fMRI and EEG because of the variable quality of the analyses. I'm not at all confident I could pick a lab that would look at its data well, since I have little exposure to those research techniques. Is this concern justified? Any advice? 

My background: I worked in wet labs during college (mouse model histology Alzheimer's Disease stuff, non-neurological blood cell development stuff), and then am spending a few years doing research on early human brain development in a more psych/clinical environment. I miss working at a bench and having exposure to wet lab research, but I also think I'll miss learning useful statistics/data analysis methods when I go back.

(x-post from neuro)",41,11,37,http://www.reddit.com/r/neuro/comments/1dyrq3/unexplained_serious_neurological_issues/,"Hi. I'm sorry to dump this out here, but frankly my girlfriend is running out of time, without prompt and accurate diagnosis, she'll likely be crippled for life. Any insight or advice would be seriously appreciated.

The short version: 6 weeks ago, she noticed a numb toe. Since then, she's had progressively more difficulty walking, her gait has dramatically changed, the numbness has progressed up her legs, and started to attack her bowels and bladder; she's unable to contract her internal muscles presently, and has outer partial numbness. Her legs are weakening, especially her feet. She's reliant on crutches to walk now and is barely able to manage more than maybe 20-40 meters on them, even taking extreme care. She seems to be tiring easily too.

This is still worsening. She's had an MRI, and spinal fluid sample taken, several blood tests, and other than 'elevated liver results' she's apparently all normal, although one neuro said her spine is an odd shape. They're going to perform an EMG tomorrow, but as I understand it, that mainly shows peripheral neuropathy issues and this seems to be a CNS problem. I've watched her knee reflexes change from 'normal' to 'brisk' to 'trying to enter orbit' over the last few weeks, but the neuros seem to think they're 'naturally brisk' and are ignoring our concerns that this is a recent change. Her reflex there now moves her legs further than she herself consciously can.

Her plantar reflex looks to me to be showing Babinski's sign, however, neuros seem to think it's a downward reflex. We hope to clarify tomorrow why they think this, but I can see her big toe fly upwards and her other toes spread out when the test is performed.

She's in hospital but they're aiming to discharge her at the end of the week or so, despite the dramatic worsening, saying it's a 'functional disorder', ie, 'we don't know what it is so have some physio to help'. We're in England, so the NHS is providing these services. We can't afford private.

I'm seriously concerned that something critical has been missed, I've been studying things and it sounds to me like something along the lines of a tethered spinal cord, spinal muscular atrophy, or possibly MS, but MS has apparently been ruled out based on the MRI. She also has a lot of pain in her hips and slightly down her inner and outer thighs, which has been the case for a while, but is a lot worse lately. Some upper back ache but nothing major or radiating as I understand it.

Any input would be much appreciated. Honestly I'm seriously scared, I really don't like the way this is progressing, and unless the EMG magically shows something tomorrow, they'll most likely try to discharge her in the very near future, eg next few days, and the 'diagnosis' of 'functional disorder' will lock the door on getting her back in, at least until it's likely too late to do anything to genuinely help with whatever the cause is.

1291158429.0,28,self.neuro,ee5rx,IAmA person who had a sudden personality change along with Aphasia. AMA (previously posted in cogsci),37,9,14,http://www.reddit.com/r/neuro/comments/ee5rx/iama_person_who_had_a_sudden_personality_change/,"One day in 1995 I went to work as normal (USAF) and after being there a while I found that I could not complete most sentences. To everyone else I seemed to be stuttering, but what had happened is that I had lost access to all of the ""big"" words I commonly used in every day conversation. I could ""feel"" them, but they were not there anymore.
I was 25 years old.

It took me about three months to re-learn how to talk. I had to use analogies in speaking to replace the words I no longer had. If someone said one of the words, I would understand it and be able to repeat it and use it in a sentence. But quickly afterward it would be gone again.


I had no improvement from this condition until about two years ago, some of the words starting coming back. They would just pop up in conversation when needed. I don't have the immediate recall of a 99th percentile vocabulary anymore - but sometimes a word is there when I need it. And sometimes not.

The personality change was a lot more subtle. I lived alone and had no friends, so no one noticed anything right away. I did not notice either (I have pieced this together over the last few years), but then people who have these sort of personality shifts are the last ones to notice. But in the space of about a year, I went from having no friends my entire life to suddenly having people want to hang out with me. I had become the hub of a bunch of friends. I suddenly started having startling success with the opposite sex, at least to the point of bedding women easily. This was after having only one incredibly dysfunctional sexual relationship previously (a few years prior). Women would quickly fall in love with me. Prior to my ""event"" (as I have come to think of it) I would have been considered pretty straight down the line Asperger's (not that I knew what that was or even what Autism was about back then). After the event I suddenly was able to judge social situations and body language. I started just ""knowing things"" based on subtle signs. I found that I was better at this than any of my peers. All good except for the words thing, right? Well, not quite...

The bad: Lost some of my savant-like talents. Started being bad with money; going from debt-free to bankrupt by 1997. Started doing risky things - lots of road rage incidents and ""fools rush in"" kinds of situations. My memories of my past life became foggy and mixed up. New memories were similarly scrambled. Lost some of my sense of smell. Emotional blunting and alexathymia. Became sexually promiscuous and careless. Changes in libido and a shift in sexual interests. Became hyper-sexual (could go in the good or bad column I guess) Lost most interest in personal hygiene and housekeeping. Lost the willpower to control my diet, began binge eating. Was insensitive to authority when not directly in view, future punishment did not concern me. Was apathetic about all of the above.

Now for the strange part (and you thought it was strange already). I found that I now had two separate processes of cognition; the old one and the new one. You see, I was still thinking like I did before the event, AND I was thinking the new way. Not dual personalities - dual intelligences.

Any time that a subject or problem would arise, I would have simultaneous differing perceptions of same - and differing solutions or judgments.

This sort of thing continues to this day, with the exception that I have worked out what my opinions are (and they are a mix of the two). Romantically and financially, I could clearly see that the things I was doing were against what I continued to believe in, but that had no bearing whatsoever on my behavior. That part of me had become a observer only, a voyeur.

I know what you are wanting to ask: What the F did the doctors say happened? Well, I never went to the doctor. Never seemed like a big deal to me (bearing in mind that only the aphasia was known to me at the time).
Over the previous 6 years or so, it actually was not unusual for me to experience changes in my cognition or memory. Usually this involved me completely forgetting how to do some previously mastered skill. Or sometimes it was completely forgetting a part of my daily routine for a week or two. Sometimes it would come right back after a week or so, sometimes I would have to relearn.

An example would be when I forgot how to drive my stickshift in 1991. Took me a few months before it became natural again.

So I just assumed that the words would just come back in a week or two.

I know of no particular physical event that would explain any of this; but my memory is such that I would not necessarily be able to connect a fall or a car accident to a particular time frame. It is all a big mosh pit of vague connections.

I have experienced more changes since then, some I notice right away, some I don't notice for years. One example is that I suddenly started having trouble parking in 2006. Since then I have major problems judging the distance that the front left of my car is from other cars. This causes me issues getting into and out of parking spaces. The rest of my savant-like spatial awareness is mostly unaffected.

Over the last couple of years I have had a lot of medical problems which generally atypical presentations or just plain never before seen. As part of investigating this I have had a MRI and CT of my head. I was surprised when I was told that there were no abnormalities seen whatsoever.
I do have a lot of feelings about all of this. I feel a great sense of loss, since I feel like I have a lot of talent in multiple areas that goes unused due to my various mental ailments.
My mind is extremely error-prone. I make a near constant stream of mental errors throughout the day. Fortunately my current job does not expose this too much; becoming a brain surgeon is NOT an option.
I have seen a slow decline in what remains of old skills and a regression in some of my post event gains. I fear that in the future I will completely go back to the way I was, but with the fogginess and other issues too. And that would be a bad thing. 


I have seen many doctors in the last couple of years. All scans come back negative. Extensive EMG testing comes back with odd results and increased insertional activity in all muscles. Muscle biopsy was abnormal but not enough so to be diagnostic. Many tiny fibers noted. High CK (3x), High AST and ALT, Uric acid, NASH found on biopsy.


When I take personality type tests, I could easily score out differently on the same test when taking it again. Even if I re-took the same test minutes afterwards it would be different. This is because I often cannot decide which answer I actually agree with most.
If you were to ask me to emulate a particular personality type when taking the test I would be completely consistent and would be able to skew the test whichever way I needed to.
I believe that some part of my outward personality is emulated. I often have unspoken discussions with other people in my head. I emulate their part in it, and often get answers I would have never have thought of ""on my own"". The answers I get often turn out to be exactly what the real version of the person comes up with when it is put to them.
I believe that part of the dual intelligence thing is that I have partial access to the subconscious/common sense part of my mind. I used to be wrong about everything in my life; even on subjects I had complete mastery of.
Now that the change happened, I can see the right answers. When I meet people now, I can pick out the ones that have the same ""being wrong"" problem. They might as well be holding up a sign they are so obvious to me.
Other people's cognitive issues are also obvious to me, there are few that I do not experience either chronically or episodically. My own biases (cognitive and emotional) are plain to me on a real time basis and I filter them out.
Not allowing them to affect my interactions with others makes me difficult to understand for most.
Of course telling anyone that you are only rarely affected by common biases provokes an immediate bullshit from them. Yet it is the case.


Although I have never attended college I do have quite a lot of college credit. I found out that a perk to being in the USAF was that I could take CLEP tests for free. So I started taking them. No studying, just showing up on test day and browsing through the tests and picking one I thought I could pass.

This was all before the changes.

I ended up with 40 some credits this way. I was two classes away from an associates degree, but they were in two subjects that I would have actually had to do something for: algebra and speech.
Some of the tests I took only because I was mistaken about the subject matter. For example I took Western Civ I because I mixed up east and west (as I usually do) and I thought it was going to be about Europe. I somehow passed it by deconstructing the test and going back and changing 80% of the answers as I went.
I went ahead and took Western Civ II and passed it using the same method.
I also passed English with a 94% for a nice 6 credits. This is despite me struggling in this subject in HS and failing it my Junior year.",,False,,t5_2qu9b,True,,,True,t3_ee5rx,http://www.reddit.com/r/neuro/comments/ee5rx/iama_person_who_had_a_sudden_personality_change/,

The master's programme is a bit biomedical engineering-ish (the school is a polytechnic institute) and offers concentrations either in neuroscience or molecular biology. 

The problem is, the neuro classes are introductory (the school doesn't offer a neuroscience programme in the bachelor's level, which is the case in Europe most often), and i've covered pretty much all of it before. Talking to the professors confirmed this. One of them suggested I take the bio courses - cancer biology and immunology - which conflict with the neuro courses, and just take the neuro course exams at the end of the period. Another suggested i take advantage of finding the neuro courses easy and focus more on taking some modelling/data analysis classes. The problem is I have a poor math background compared to what is done in these classes (I've done up to calc II, these classes begin with nonlinear dynamical systems), and also I'm not sure where to focus more. 

I'm interested greatly in neuroimmunology, and of course cancer, and think that taking the bio courses will help me have a deeper biological background with neurodegenerative disease, stroke, etc. On the other hand, it seems that computational methods are starting to take the reins in all biological disciplines, especially neuroscience, these days.

I'm NOT seeking a prognosis, rather have some questions in the purely medical sense.

I think it's important to give a brief breakdown (timeline) of the situation with this patient to better answer these questions, but that might not be important.

- Patient (25 y/o female) suffered anaphylactic shock from an allergen.
- Patient administered epi (did not work)
- Patient was seen my EMTs moments later, who gave her oxygen plus began transport
- Patient went into cardiac arrest (believe heart was brought back in the ambulance)
- Patient entered ER stable, talking, alert
- ER Doctors determined brain was swelling
- Patient was induced into a coma
- Taken off medical coma Sunday (2/24)
- Patient will not awake to-date
- Doctors have done an EEG and all we know is that results ""are not good""
- Patient getting a tracheotomy + on respirator

Questions:

1) Is it realistic to say that a patient's brain will swell only because of lack of oxygen due to a cardiac arrest where he/she did not have adequate O2 supply within the 6-minute mark? And how is this swelling determined in the ER? (CAT scan?)

2) I know there are a ton of tests to determine brain death in adults (http://www.aan.com/professionals/practice/guidelines/pda/Brain_death_adults.pdf), but does brain death = EEG showing no electric current (in the simplest terms possible)?

3) Is coma related to severe-neurological brain injuries? Do people not wake up from comas because of brain trauma/injury? Are there other factors associated for coma victims, neurological trauma aside?

Finally, 4) Is it possible for a patient's brain to not receive adequate oxygen even though oxygen was being delivered by either mask or CPR? Could an obstructed airway prevent oxygen from being delivered via CPR/mask missing the 6-minute window for cerebral hypoxia?

I documented these changes and staring/unresponsive episodes with my camera. We showed them to his pediatrician after 5 days. We were referred to a neurologist to see him first thing on Monday (we went in on Friday). Monday morning he had another episode of unresponsiveness followed by vomiting. We went to a children's hospital ER. They did an overnight EEG, which didn't show anything. He didnt have any of the staring episodes during this time though. The neurologist wanted to do an MRI and lumbar puncture but because of scheduling he needed to stay another night to have it done the next day. He made such rapid improvement during that day we decided to not do these tests.

His symptoms have almost totally gone. We are still following up with the neurologist, but in the meantime I want to know what happened and why. There is no question it was related to the vaccine, but how? If he were having absence seizures, could you tell from an EEG even if he didnt have an episode during the EEG? What would cause a developmentally normal, actually advanced, 3 year old to rapidly develop and then recover from these symptoms that so closely mimic the ”A” word. I'm a registered nurse, so I can navigate health literature. I just need a point in the right direction. Anyone? Please?

Edit: Can we please operate under the assumption that I am not an idiot? I realize this isn't a substitute for a neurologist visit and I am not going to let Google and people on Reddit determine his diagnosis and course of treatment. I am only looking to learn and understand what happened while we wait for his neurologist appointment. I have gotten some excellent information as a starting point from here so far, so THANK YOU. I did follow the neurologist's recommendation and we panned to go ahead with the testing until on the morning of the testing the neurologist said that given his improvement he was on the fence about whether it was necessary. He said it was our decision and could always be done outpatient. Yes, I am a scared mother, but I am also reasonable.

I could use some wisdom from neuroscientists... (I'm not sure which subreddit to put this in, exactly, but I figured it wouldn't hurt to start with Neuro). I'm currently an undergraduate studying Brain and Cognitive Sciences, and I really want to start taking my work and future more seriously. However, since I've never taken much time to actually stop and talk to a neuroscientist about the path that he/she has taken to become a neuroscientist, I find I'm at a bit of a loss when it comes to what I should be doing to adequately prepare me for studying and applying neuroscience.

I've taken a number of neuroscience courses ranging from Cognitive Neuroscience to Neuroanatomy, and I'm currently looking into some undergraduate research positions in my institute's laboratories. I may have access to some excellent neuroscientists, as well, if I can manage to persuade them to give me some of their time.


I read, but not as much as I used to, and my reading consists a great deal of neuropsychology or psychology since I'm not sure where to begin with general neuroscience readings. I'm taking a short week-long course dealing with the current state of the field next week, so I'm hoping that will point my way.


Maybe some of you could simply share your stories about how or why you became neuroscientists? Or just interested in the topic?


**tl;dr: I'm a nub in college. How does I prepare to be neuroscientist besides classes?**


*EDIT:* I'm very grateful for the feedback everyone has provided and hope it helps other undergraduate neuroscience students. I've begun looking into the books suggested and starting speaking with some professors about their labs. I've looked into some of the books, now:

* Kandel's Principles of Neuroscience
* Research Techniques in Neuroscience by Matt Carter and Jennifer Shieh
* MATLAB for Neuroscientists

**EDIT2:** I've been speaking with professors about working in their labs. The sentiments about programming and mathematics are spot on. A lot of the work being done by the professors I've spoken to so far have to do with oscillatory firing patterns of neuron populations and there is a ton of statistical analysis and sinusoidal techniques that I need to touch up on. Good thing I kept my math books!

Also, the Kandel book is phenomenal! I've heard good things about Fundamental Neuroscience by Squire, so I'm going to check that one out, as well. And I've heard that Neuroscience by Purve is a nice concise take on things as well. I really feel like I'm getting a solid foundation in neuroscience now! Thanks, everyone!

**EDIT3:** Just wanted to do a quick update. I followed most of the advice in the comments and things worked out very well - so if you are/were in my position, there is sound advice in this community having tested it first hand. I'm currently employed as an undergraduate researcher working with [Robert Desimone](http://bcs.mit.edu/people/desimone.html) regarding the neural basis of attention. Just this past week I was helping my postdoc supervisor run an MEG+EEG experiment - it was totally awesome! So yes, I buckled down, read journal articles, sought out professors, emphasized the strengths I had in the areas everyone here mentioned and I'm still reading a ton as I go and trying to get more and more hands on experience at the same time so I have more pragmatic knowledge.

This includes programming, mathematical proofs, analyzing media claims, building electronic systems and understanding women. Because I was writing to think I've split this into three sections for your convenience: background knowledge, analysis, and discussion. Go look at whatever's most relevant to you.

---

**Background Knowledge**

In the expertise-acquisition literature it's noted that when expert chess or Starcraft players have their eye movements tracked while playing a game, they are much more economical than novices were in what they paid attention to in their given scenario. Through consistent playing, the theory goes, they've learned to pick up patterns in the structure of the game's advance. These patterns are primarily visual, but represent signposts in the game's progression and thus one can make an educated response to turn the tables to one's favor.

Chess and Starcraft are very complex games. The chess puts a heavy load on deductive reasoning while Starcraft is much more inferential, but both involve reasoning well if one wants to be successful. Expertise in these games, however, does not necessarily come from just playing more games. Chess books exist so that case studies can be analysed and to an extent memorized, so that when one comes up against a complicated scenario, by rote one may still win. Similarly with Starcraft and clan wikis.

In some, beyond learning the specific 'rules' of the game, ad-hoc 'rules' are made that experts use to their advantage. Those with adequate experience can take advantage of these rules and become an expert more quickly. As an expert practices these rules, they move to subconscious instead of conscious processing. This means that experts can do more complex things but are less tired in doing so because subconscious processing is less expensive.

---

**Analysis**

There seem to be three approaches to gaining expertise at a Chess and Starcraft, examples of complex reasoning tasks.

1) practicing a lot at the level of doing the thing and coming up with your own rules - most costly and requires most smarts: reflection on experience and analysis of experience

2) memorizing patterns and strategies - less costly than (1) and accessible to more people; but also less innovative. You're taking expertise rather than generating it

3) increasing one's motivation and mental energy to be better at (1) and (2).

These are not mutually exclusive, but whichever one is marginally more effective seems to depend on how smart and motivated you are. Let's map ""smart"" to ""general fluid intelligence"" or Gf.

(3) is hardly a crapshoot, so it won't be covered. Sans the likes of chronic major depression, motivation appears to be mostly solved, and mental energy is cheap - drink caffeine, do exercise, and have a balanced diet that isn't vegan.

What about smarts? It appears that after some difficulty trying, it's reasonable to expect that improving fluid intelligence is out of the picture. This is regrettable as much economic value is created by new and specific concepts, along with their effective implementation. 

Memorizing facts, however, is easier than ever. Spaced repetition is allows for a metric fuckload of facts to be remembered. Around the hinges of the conversations on SR we find reports that the memorization of concepts can lead to more intelligent behavior - see these posts on LessWrong: [Memory, Spaced Repetition and Life](http://lesswrong.com/lw/64k/memory_spaced_repetition_and_life/), or [Self-programming through spaced repetition](http://lesswrong.com/lw/5v1/selfprogramming_through_spaced_repetition/).

So is the memorization of key reasoning concepts like Modus Ponens/Modus Tollens, reasoning about absences (Wherever there is no triangle there is no circle. This sequence lacks a triangle. Thus, this sequence will lack a circle), or domain-specific patterns both possible and adequate as a strategy for improving my reasoning ability?

---

**Discussion**

Weaknesses in this analysis include:

* I might suffer from some key points being too general and it could be more effective to look at how to improve my performance at all of the tasks mentioned in the beginning. A deconstruction of these tasks could provide insight on this question anyway. Maybe if it comes up.

* Practicing Chess and Starcraft do not appear to have far transfer to many other except maybe speed of processing. So generalizing the nature of these tasks to other specific activities could be fallacious. However, it could still be the case that memorizing visual patterns is effective within complex reasoning tasks, but not between complex reasoning tasks (unless you remember marines being sliced apart by zerg while you're modelling a population's life expectancy using a logistic's curve).

* Visual recognition and motor response are quite different from devising a program or math proof that works. Word problems don't always have any aside from some keywords, but *really hard problems* still require some reliance on cleverness. This might be worth looking into further.

* Given that memorization is an effective method, a tradeoff appears to exist between strong working memory, a correlate with Gf, and long-term memory storage. I doubt this is too much of an issue, but would an overreliance on memorization have any negative consequence on analytic capacity? Are these just a matter of time committed to one improvement strategy over other possible but unknown strategy of analytic improvement?

I'm afraid the above factual claims are going to go uncited until I find the papers again.

Thoughts?

EDIT: I just realized that most human expertise is about passing down refined and easy to learn versions of the concepts that other people took time and deep thought to invent. Calculus was invented by Newton but is ultimately easier to learn from Salman Khan (see Philosophae Naturalis Principia Mathematica vs Khan Academy, and writhe). As with whoever invented logic or any of other concepts in these fields. So that's the proof of concept of memorization being **a** strategy, so why bother asking?

It might be easier to revise what I meant by ""adequate"". Could memorizing abstractions, if properly done, be a way of making the advantage close between those with higher fluid intelligence and merely typical fluid intelligence?

If any of you are actually in a specific field if you wouldn't mind divulging your area of expertise and what you do, and maybe just a general idea of what you make, no worries if that's too personal.
Also, maybe this could be expanded to just a personal ""Show-and-tell"" of professions here on reddit. With over 4000 of us I'm sure some of you have some cool jobs and there are surely many students who would be interested.

I'm looking for high-resolution neuro-related images that can be made into a printed poster (as a gift).

I'm sure many of us would appreciate the sharing of such visually (and thought) provoking stimuli.

I've done some preliminary searches, but finding images that are both *high in artistic quality and high in resolution* seems to be more difficult than expected.

Any advice on transitioning over to this field ?  Should I pick up a degree relating to biology/chemistry first ?  Or start mopping floors at a neuroscience lab and begging fellow neurons to allow me to do research for free ?

Let's say that Server1 and Server2 are both financial exchange servers running exactly the same algorithms, but Server2 is somewhat closer to the stock exchange than Server1, and is also of lower bandwidth - it can handle fewer trades until it starts delaying their execution.  As a result, Server2 is generally preferred by traders – and thus handles most trades – *unless* the number of trades exceeds its bandwidth. In that case, Server1 is very rapidly and overwhelmingly preferred by traders, because it won't impose further delays.

So, at low #'s of trades, Server1 consumes more energy, but at high #s of trades, Server 2 consumes more energy. This gives us a [Server1 vs. Server 2] x [# of trades demanded] interaction in terms of energy consumed, even though both servers are running the same algorithm.

Now, replace ""energy consumed"" with percent signal change (PSC), ""servers"" with brain regions and ""# of trades demanded"" with cognitive demand on a single underlying process. See here:  

http://i.imgur.com/RMKjcU8.jpg

Does this mean we can't infer a difference in the cognitive processes implemented by each brain region, EVEN with a crossover region x effect interaction?

------Teaser 2------

Server1 and Server2 are two webservers running Apache 3.2, and they serve up exactly the same information. However, the servers are each maximally energy efficient at different levels of demand. Specifically, when the number of client requests are low, Server 1 tends to be involved; when the number of client requests are high, Server 2 is recruited instead. Let's say this occurs because there's a high cost to spinning up Server2's disk, but once spun up it can handle lots of requests very quickly (e.g., it spins at a 54000000RPM).

Finally, when the number of requests exceeds those that either server can handle with maximum energy efficiency, the information is simply routed elsewhere.

This also gives us a Server [1 vs 2] by [# of client demands] interaction in terms of energy used, but to infer that the servers implement a different process would be wrong - they both run Apache 3.2.

As before, replace ""Server"" with brain region, client demand with demands on a single underlying process, and energy with PSC. Does this mean that, once again, we can't infer a difference in the cognitive function of these regions, even given the region x effect interaction?

My problem is that I have been unable to find lab work.  I've applied to about 30 different positions.  I've tried to worked the ""ins"" I have with a friend currently working in a research lab to no avail.  

Is there anything I can do?  Should I abandon this search and just start applying to Masters programs?  I obviously cannot apply to a PhD program without any research experience.

I feel like I am running out of options.

Thank you for your time and help in advance!

I'm really curious if anyone here can offer a reasonable explanation for it...

So this lady had a schwannoma on her left L2 nerve root, and the surgeon wanted to stimulate areas of the tumor so that he could avoid any motor nerves. In one location where he stimulated, we had no muscle response in the legs where we were expecting, but the lady's *right* arm started to retract and her wrist and hand began to twitch. 

My supervisor who was there at the time is kind of in denial about it even happening because it makes so little sense given what the two of us know. I'm hoping that someone here is a genius with a reasonable explanation, but I'm not holding my breath. This is pretty weird.

For more detail, we noticed it happening while we were stimulating between 3 and 4mA with a bipolar stimulator. I remember seeing it happen 3 times, only while we were stimulating, so I don't think it was just some coincidence. Also, her hand was twitching at approximately the same rep-rate that we were stimulating. My supervisor thinks that she was light on anesthesia at the time and that that was the cause, but the anesthetist disagreed with him.

Whenever we eat, adipocytes (fat cells) release a hormone known as leptin. This leptin directly acts on the hypothalamus, and through a complex series of interactions, reduces sensations of hunger. As the hours pass, the levels of leptin decrease within the body. This in turn causes the pancreas and stomach to release a hormone known as ghrelin (the counter-part of leptin). High levels of ghrelin cause feelings of satiation and prevent us from over-consuming food. Normally, this cycle works well to ensure that we obtain adequate nutrition without becoming obese.

A few months ago I sort of ""woke up"" in the middle of the campus of the university I attend with none of my belongings and no ability to recognize where I was, though I knew I was on campus. I could remember things like who my parents were, their phone numbers, etc., but I mistook an address from two years ago for my current address and could remember very little else.

A couple of weeks later I had an EEG done for the first time, and the results led to a diagnosis of a seizure disorder. After telling my neurologist that I still have frequent deja vu and other symptoms (including subtle memory loss), he recommended I undergo an ambulatory EEG. I've got the electrodes on my head as I'm writing this.

I thought my experience and test results might be of interest to some of you here ([transient epileptic amnesia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transient_epileptic_amnesia) apparently [raises questions about the way we think about memory](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transient_epileptic_amnesia#Implications_for_theories_of_memory_), and I thought maybe some among you could shed some light on the specifics of the results. My neurologist is great but I haven't had a chance to get a detailed, plain-English account of what it all means. (I should note I haven't been diagnosed with TEA, nor have I been told I have temporal lobe epilepsy specifically.)

Results from the first EEG:

Hyperventilation and photic stimulation caused abnormal activity, but it happened other times as well (awake, drowsy, and asleep). 9-10 ""diffuse, transient bursts of delta and theta slowing"" of 1-3 seconds. These were well-formed, quasirhythmic, and of moderate intensity; on a few occasions they were better-formed in the left hemisphere. Most of the episodes were in the theta range of 6-7 Hz with some in the delta range of 2-3 Hz with overriding delta activity. ""Vertex sharp waves with phase reversals in the central and paracentral head regions are noted.""

I have a general sense of what the different sorts of waves suggest, but no idea what they mean in an ""abnormal"" context.",,False,,t5_2qu9b,False,,,True,t3_o4icf,http://www.reddit.com/r/neuro/comments/o4icf/transient_amnesia_eeg_results_seizure_disorder/,

I thought it would also be a great chance to pose a question, or rather a quest that I've been on for quite some time. 

I myself cannot form very vivid mental images lately and its really made things like reading novels and even non-fiction quite a hassle. As we all know remembering something through an image is much easier than simple words. My only issue is that I have had certain stretches of time over the past year that I had an almost perfect ability to make these images, so much so that it surprised me when I saw them.

Is there a nutritional basis to this or possibly something to do with exercise? As it is I put over an hour into meditation and yoga each day . So I suppose my real question is what is the neurological basis for this and in what ways does this ability increase and decrease and under what conditions?

This is surprisingly a very rare topic and I have only found a few books in my travels that deal with it and they weren't even geared towards this specifically, but moreso mentioned as an aside in many books on memory.

Well thank you all hope to get a discussion going!

I'm a Computer Scientist who has been trying to learn more about neuroscience. I've been reading a [textbook](http://www.amazon.com/Neuroscience-Exploring-Mark-F-Bear/dp/0781760038) and some papers/wikipedia articles and there's a concept that confuses me that I'm hoping you guys can help me clarify. I'm not in school anymore and I don't really have access to many resources to just ask questions to so I hope this is ok in this sub.

I've been trying to learn more about the visual cortex (I'm a Machine Vision guy professionally), and I keep running across this idea of [Neuronal tuning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuronal_tuning). I've done a little work with [ANN](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_neural_network) simulations and took a grad course in Nerual Networks and Pattern Recognition in undergrad. 

When we do computational simulations of ANNs, we very rarely assume that individual objects (artificial neurons) represent singular (or even multiple unique) abstract ideas. We instead assume that the entire set of neurons models some nonlinear behavior as a combination of linear equations. This seems to work very well in creating interesting, complex behavior, but this also appears to clash with the idea of neuronal tuning as I've read it (although I may be completely misunderstanding the concept).

I understand ANNs aren't accurate representations of brains, but it seems strange that the computational models should be so different from the biological systems that inspired them (and makes me think we have a lot of room to improve the models).

Why do we believe individual cells ""selectively represent a particular type of sensory, motor, or cognitive information,"" and is this belief limited to sensory systems like visual and auditory? How does a single cell hold this information (my understanding of neuronal cell structure is limited to what I've read in the aforementioned textbook)? Are there computational models which better represent this idea? I've seen boosting networks, or networks of networks, which represent more complex information or patterns in a subnetwork, but these networks don't abstractly represent a single cell.

Sorry if this seems like a really layman question! I'm still pretty new to neuroscience, and I understand I may be missing something fundamental.

Thanks!

So the final part of my PhD project has necessitated the use of multielectrode arrays to measure electrical activity in cultured neurons. There's a slight bump in all this in that my PI literally has no idea what I'm talking about when I ask about any of the finer details about spike sorting, or analyzing waveforms, or... yeah, just anything extending past ""this graph shows a bunch of lines that means there's a lot of spikes going on there.""

However I'm having a lot of my own difficulty related to this, and the more I've been trying to put data together the more computational and math intensive it's getting, to the point that I'm not sure about a lot of the ""why"" in the variables or experimental tools and programs I'm working with. For instance, I have no idea why a spike can be defined in the intervals of .86 ms to 2.1 ms (where did these ranges come from? Who tested this?) or how to make pretty plots of the data (why can't I add electrode counts to my Raster plots? I read the Neuroexplorer manual and it tells me nothing. Why am I so retarded? etc.). Literature searches haven't really dug up much help for me and I just feel like I'm not even grasping the most elementary assumptions that I'm supposed to be making while doing my experiments and analyzing the data I have, which undoubtedly will turn out to be poorly done.

So I know this probably seems nebulous and vague and all, but are there resources-- literally any-- that could help me better understand the finer points of electrophysiology and spike activity?

Now, every moment you spend or think of her you automatically think of the bad phrase. How can one ""break"" the two thoughts apart?

I've heard a couple answers so far from Google. One person said that it is impossible to disassociate the two things, instead, you have to get used to the facts of the bad phrase until it no longer seems significant and eventually it will become a subconscious thought and not bother you anymore. 

Way to make the bad phrase become insignificant: Imagine the phrase on a piece of paper, then imagine yourself crumpling the paper and lighting it on fire...

Could someone please explain what determines the neurotransmitter payload that will be released from a given presynaptic axon?,19,0,14,http://www.reddit.com/r/neuro/comments/hxb83/i_dont_quite_understand_could_someone_please/,"Whoops, badly worded title. 
Maybe this is a really uninformed question but I can't seem to find a straight answer or figure it out so I'd appreciate an explanation.

So, neurons interact via synapses which generally exist between the axon of the pre-synaptic neuron and a dendrite of the post-synaptic neuron. When neuron fires it releases neurotransmitters into all of the synapses along its axon. There are multiple neurotransmitters and different neurotransmitters cause different effects when absorbed. Right?

What determines which neurotransmitter a given neuron will release into a given synapse?

I can think of a few different possibilities
Is it context dependent? Can a neuron release different neurotransmitters into the same synapse depending on the situation? For some reason that sounds unlikely.
Can a given neuron only ever release one neurotransmitter and you just have dopamine neurons and GABA neurons or can a neuron have different neurotransmitters it releases into different synapses but each synapse has a specific neurotransmitter it receives?

What mechanism determines this stuff? Is it genetic? Do neurons with different jobs differentiated and replicate? How does a neuron decide whether this specific corner of my brain needs some stimulation or some cool jazz?

tl;dr What mechanism determines which neurotransmitter will be released into a synapse?

So, these days I'm being in the course of depression treatment therapy. It seems like this depression was ""essential"" part of my life for a looong time by now (almost 20 years or so) without myself being aware of this fact. 

I take zoloft everyday as well as mild doses of b1-blockers (bisoprolol). And the therapy ends soon, about in a month or so. 


So, as now I'm feeling better than I ever did in my whole life (YAY for SSRI!), I wonder what will happen next after the therapy ends ? 


Would I feel myself better than strictly before the therapy ? And most important - how can I achieve and sustain such a positive state of mind without taking any drugs ?


Now I do sports almost on a daily basis, I don't drink or smoke. But from neurological standpoint I could suggest that my motivation for such a behavior might weaken severely when I'll stop taking antidepressants.


So, please help ! What should I do next ?

I think of designing a college-level class for High School kids, which would serve as a very simple introduction into computational neuroscience. I already know what problems I'd like to give them, but I am still struggling about the programming language to choose. All my friends in neuroscience are using Matlab, but I have heard that in many fields (biostatistics, genomics) R is at least as popular as Matlab, or even more popular. Also R is free, which seems to provide certain logistical benefits for the course organization. Still I don't want to teach them something they are not really likely to use in the neuroscience lab later on.

Thus please help me with this mini-poll. If you use Matlab or/and R in your research, please, indicate so in the comments! Also, if possible, hint at what kind of science you are talking about (fMRI, spike trains analysis, cellular neuroscience?..) It will give me a better perspective of the current state of affairs.

Can a neuron react to different stimulation by releasing different neurotransmitters in synaptic cleft? For example, can there be a situation where a neuron can be stimuated 2 different ways. If it's stimulated the first way then it releases glutamin and if it is stimulated the second way it releases a combination of glutamin with some other neurotransmitter of modulator. 

Or, can a neuron be modulated to react to the same stimuli different way?

I've mentioned it to a couple of my doctors and they just say they've never heard anything like that and give me a stupid look. It's been occurring for the past 7-10 years or so, off and on. 

The best way I can describe it is the sensation you get when you stick your finger in an outlet. It's a quick, sharp electrical shock feeling and always occurs in the back right side of my head (feels like it's in my brain). It's like a quick 'pop', almost. It's very random and I haven't been able to identify myself doing anything in particular that could trigger it. Sometimes it happens frequently, or it can go weeks without happening. I don't think it's life threatening, but it's pretty terrifying when it happens(mainly because it's painful and very unexpected) and disorients me for a few seconds. Other than that, it doesn't really seem to cause any harm.

Since I've never been able to find anything on google about it, I thought maybe someone here would know what the hell I'm talking about. I don't even know if this is the appropriate place. Just a shot in the dark I guess.

1342128077.0,16,self.neuro,wgp3k,New psychology subreddit! Subscribers of /r/neuro invited!,18,2,2,http://www.reddit.com/r/neuro/comments/wgp3k/new_psychology_subreddit_subscribers_of_rneuro/,"/r/CollaborativePsych is a new psychology subreddit intended for the discussion of psychology from an introspective perspective. It is sort of a think-tank where you post observations of your own psychology, ask questions, and propose and compare hypotheses.

I say we should use an ""introspective perspective"" because that is the one thing we have access to which others don't. We experience our own psychology in a way no one else can and I think that by communicating and comparing what is happening in our minds *en masse*, we can learn something important about how our minds work.

I hope that the subreddit will be strongly structured in such a way that past posts will continually be re-referred to and past proposed theories will be frequently brought up and compared.

/r/CollaborativePsych would very much so like input from /r/neuro and anyone who has knowledge or interest in psychology, neurology, or cognitive science.

So come to /r/CollaborativePsych and take a look. Subscribe if you want to support us or see this type of content!

I'd love to hear your criticisms, critiques, and tips if you have any. (Also, we need moderators. If you'd like to become a moderator, post a comment under the ""Welcome"" post on the subreddit.)

It should be a trivial thing -- I'm using these vectors for shRNA delivery, so it's just oligo cloning. And I've made the damned cassette before, too (only in a different plasmid), so I don't think my construct should be toxic to E. coli. But what's happening is that I do the ligation and transform my bacteria, and then I get a huge number of tiny colonies. If I do a miniprep, the colonies are making a huge plasmid that is Amp resistant but not at all the plasmid I'm trying to make. 

Is this some sort of weird recombination event? (I don't understand how that would happen in DH5a cells, which are recombinase-deficient...) My friend in the lab next door is having the same problem, and nobody seems to have a clue about how we can fix it.

When I was younger, I was really into pokemon. For those of you that don't know, each pokemon has one or more elements that have advantages and weaknesses against other elements. The way that I saw the individual elements was simply based on the image and color given, but I saw the relationship between the elements in a weird way.

Sadly, I only really remember one distinct example. Grass-type is super-effective against Water-type. In my head, instead of seeing an association of blue and green, I would see a squiggly line that would be flattened by a rigid line until only the rigid line was visible. Every relationship between elements had a similar 'animation' with rigid vs. squiggly lines, and they were never in full color.

The strange thing about my memories is that I was never able to recall them when I wanted to. I would recognize them subconsciously, but if I though about them too hard, they would vanish.

Could I have your thoughts please?,19,3,9,http://www.reddit.com/r/neuro/comments/11sb8c/im_looking_to_obtain_research_experience_to_get/,"Hello, I’ve asked a question about research experience here before and have received very helpful answers. Now I’ve come up with another question:

I’m in the process of obtaining lab experience so I can apply for a graduate program in neuroscience (I have no experience aside from classes with labs as I didn’t know that I wanted to get into neuro until my final semester of undergrad – BS in Psychology). What I’ve found so far are openings for paid research assistant positions, full time, in a university close by. I’m hoping that with a killer cover letter, I could get accepted to one of these positions (from what’s listed... I seem to match basic requirements). The thing is though, they all seem to be for biology/chemistry/etc, not actual neuroscience. Would lab experience from these origins be suitable enough to be considered for a position in a neuroscience program? Or do I have to have experience from specifically neuroscience-based labs? I’m pretty sure I can obtain all the other requirements for admission (GPA, GREs, letters of recommendation, etc) – it’s just the lab experience that has me snagged.

So would I be okay getting experience in these types of labs, or should I keep looking? Any thoughts or advice would be much appreciated, thank you.

Around a year ago I noticed that people tend to take the same paths through space, even if it is an individual walking by them selves. This led me to ask why is this the case. I have since began to study human perception in depth, a study that started from little to no knowledge of the subject beyond first hand observation. I have read quite a few primers on the subject but after some time, decided that this was the wrong approach. Since than I have devoted most of my time to starting at the beginning and studying the eye. I have for the most part advanced beyond this and now would like to know how we understand space. To clarify, by space I mean the world immediately around the viewer. I guess you could say I would like to know how people come to understand their surroundings and exactly what that understanding entitles. To go back to my original question, I want to know what factors cause people to interact with space in the way we do. I have come across many bits and pieces on the subject but no complete analysis of the matter. I have many personal theories but would like to be able to augment them and correct them with quantitative studies. Any help in this would be greatly appreciated, even just a small pointer in a general direction.

My boyfriend had to leave for work so I kept trying to get up. I ended up rolling myself onto the bedroom floor then yelling for my boyfriend to come help.  He came in and helped me up, all I can remember from there is being at the bar (two rooms away) and falling to the floor.  I thought it was just a weird migraine because I have had pretty severe migraines since I was 3 but it was always my left hand going numb, then the aura, then the migraine. But on the 12th of December, a Monday morning... it was very different.  I could not walk, i could not really talk, or do anything.  So I had my boyfriend put me on the couch as if it were a migraine with all the stuff beside the couch like drinks, phones, meds, etc... but I did not wake up i slept the entire day and he returned home 10 hours later and (I do not remember any of this...) he said the right side of my face was drooping and he put me in the car and took me to the ER and they admitted me.  
It is a blur to waking up in the hospital.  But i do remember calling all my family member and being very emotionally unstable.  My dad and grandparents came on that Wednesday which was also the day I saw the neurologist. 
He said I had a stroke deep in the left side of my brain in my sleep.  At first he said it was caused by my migraines, my ""complicated migraines"". But after further investigating into my other medical issues like my last 3 gastrointestinal surgeries and my open-heart surgery when I was 12 among many others but I dont think they matter to this.  
SO, I gained back some movement of my right side before I left the hospital.  I now can walk on my own and do what I put my mind to but I still get vet upset and frustrated and angry and emotional and I need some answers.  My family doctor read the neurologists report and it said not only did I have the big stroke in the Basal Ganglia but I had one in my Temporal Lobe as well, and I do remember that one a few weeks before the big one in the middle of the night I had got up to get a drink and my head hurt really bad and it was really hard to walk and i fell into the clothes basket and bruised my leg but didnt remember this until I got back home from the hospital.
It is now January 2nd and I had a very scary episode yesterday.  My boyfriend and his friend were playing their video game and I (I do not remember this) I got up from the couch and just dropped to the ground really hard and hit my head off the floor.  So Rob (my boyfriend) took me into the bathroom and I was delusional for a few minutes.  I was really scared and crying and I didnt know what happened or why it happened.  I know I shouldve went to the hospital but I did not because I thought they would keep me overnight and what if there is something else wrong?
Also...
I spent a total of 5 days in the hospital when I had the 2nd stroke.  They did a echo...and this time they did a ""bubble""test with it.  Ive had hundreds of echo's but never did they aggitate waterand push it thru an IV before... so this showed what they think caused the stroke.  A PFO I was told is my new diagnosis.  I made a cardiologist appointment for Children's Hospital in Pittsburgh for Jan. 13 because the neurologist wants me to go where I went for my first heart surgery.  So, now I have to wait and see my neurologist until Jan 16.  
They think the PFO is what caused the strokes. And now they have me on the new combination of Plaviks, Topomax, baby Asprin, Slow Mag, xanax, and percocet I am looking for any kind of guidance at this point because I have only saw my family doctor once and it has been 2 weeks.

The dog and I looked at each other for about 4 or 5 seconds, and then he took a nip at my hand.  I *knew* the dog was going to bite.  Since I was fearful, is it possible the dog's mirror neurons ""twinned"" with my experiencing fear, and he thus felt fearful?  This would be different than if the dog was an opportunist and saw me as subordinate and was enforcing that.  Some people will tell you that a dog or a horse can sense if you're fearful of them, and if that's true, maybe the scent a person emits could be be part of the reason that dog bit me.  I don't know if the idea about scent has been proven.

I believe that love can exist between humans and animals and wonder if the feeling of love between them also involves how mirror neurons function.  Love is hard to define and brain chemistry, hormones, and a lot of other things are involved, and these things may partially explain the bond between people and animals, but the idea of mirror neurons being activated between human and animal brains is intriguing.

As a non-scientific person, what I think about mirror neurons is derived from scant reading.  There may be material online about this idea and I admit I've not gone searching too thoroughly.

' How To Build a Brain by Professor Chris Eliasmith details how and he and his team built Spaun, the world’s largest functional brain model. The book gives hands-on tutorials that even newcomers to the field can undertake, quickly allowing them to construct a wide range of biologically realistic brain models.

""This book is aimed at anyone wishing to understand how large numbers of neurons form brain circuits that result in behavior, "" said Professor Eliasmith, director of the Centre for Theoretical Neuroscience at Waterloo, Canada Research Chair in Theoretical Neuroscience, and professor in Waterloo's Department of Philosophy and Department of Systems Design Engineering. “The semantic, syntactical, control, learning, and memory models covered by the book and tutorials are the components that we used to create Spaun.” '

This sparked a huge interest in neurology for me. At the time it was mostly cognitive neuroscience (even though I barely knew what that meant and barely do now), and Eric Kandel's [In Search of Memory](http://www.amazon.com/In-Search-Memory-Emergence-Science/dp/0393058638), which I'm still reading, expanded it to neuroanatomy, neurochemistry, and neurophysiology, among others. I also just started Oliver Sacks' [Musicophilia](http://musicophilia.com/) and plan to read more by him.

Unfortunately, I'm only going to be a junior in high school next year so I don't have much instruction from any kind of school on any of this (I'm taking Biology, Chemistry, and Physics for the next two years, but it's not specific to this at all). I tried taking an introductory course on neurochemistry on Coursera earlier this year but all the electrical equations and all that were above my level. There's also the fact that I still need to keep getting good grades so I can't devote myself completely to neuroscience (or anything, obviously) for the time being. I'm thinking about pre-med and med school (I know, it's early), and I think I would be more research-oriented than clinically-oriented. My two main interests in life and for studies are neuro (duh) and music, so I'm finding more ways to be able to combine those two. I'm a musician as well.

Is there anything else I can be doing in the mean time (apart from reading neuro books and looking stuff up that relates to neuro) to help me along that path?

I'm 23/f, average height/weight, BP 117/70, cardio exercise 3x per week on average, no smoking, I have a few drinks on the weekend, no elicit drugs, fairly traditional dietary habits, though I try to steer clear of processed foods as much as possible. The only things I have going against me is quite a bit of family history of high cholesterol and related heart attacks/strokes. I was also diagnosed with hypothyroidism (another abnormal issue for someone my age) about a year and a half ago, which I control with levothyroxine. I majored in bio/chem in college and am applying to nursing masters program, so I'm very familiar with most scientific/medical jargon. :)

The story (sorry for the detail/length!):
When I was 18 during my first semester at college, I was watching Garden State with friends when I started noticing that I was having trouble seeing the right half of my normal field of vision. One particular example I remember from watching the movie was when Zach Braff wakes up with ""BALLS"" written across his forehead, I could only see ""BA"". As I was trying to explain what was going on to my friends, the words coming out of my mouth were complete gibberish. My speech was slurred and I felt like I couldn't articulate my thoughts no matter how hard I tried. Next, I started feeling tingling in my right hand. I should also mention that I had a dull headache throughout all of this, but nothing remarkably painful or abnormal. I know at this point I probably should have realized what was going on and gone to the ER, but I was confused and scared, and all my symptoms went away within 30 minutes. I felt completely normal and like nothing had happened at all.

The next day I saw my doctor, and he ran a series of tests including basic neurological function, EKG, MRI with contrast, various blood tests, all of which came back normal. At the time he never used the word ""stroke"", but said it could have been caused by a migraine (although I had never had one before) or some other fluke event. He told me that I should just be mindful of theses symptoms and go to the ER if this were to ever happen again, and then he would refer me to a neurologist for further testing.

So fast forward to last week, I'm now 23, and the exact same thing happened to me again. This time I was quite a bit more confused, and by the time I had decided I needed to go to the ER, my symptoms had completely subsided. I would say the whole event lasted between 1-2 hours. I saw a different doctor (I've since moved across the country), and after I told her my symptoms and my suspicions that these events could be TIAs, she agreed with me and referred me to a neurologist. Unfortunately, the earliest available appointment is in a month, so I have to impatiently wait to find out what's going on. 

I know the MRI ruled out blockages/plaque in the brain, the EKG ruled out any sort of heart defect, and the blood tests ruled out clotting/platelet issues that could be the cause of vessel blockage. Can anyone think of something else that might cause these symptoms? Or maybe some other tests the neurologist might run? I ask not to walk into the neurologist's office with a WebMD diagnosis, but mostly because I'm curious and find the subject to be fascinating. I also think its always best to be a well informed patient!

So with ALL that said, any anecdotal experience, clinical knowledge, or articles you might have on the subject of TIAs in young people would be greatly appreciated! :)",,False,,t5_2qu9b,False,,,True,t3_18v9wt,http://www.reddit.com/r/neuro/comments/18v9wt/hey_rneuro_has_anyone_ever_heard_of_a_transient/,

Recently my friends have told me about a neurologist in one of the main city hospitals. It appears that this man has, should I say, a lot of unconventional techniques, but I cannot really wrap my mind around them. So I figured this is the place to go. The description of his work is rather scarce, because I have not seen him in action and I've only heard rumors from my colleague:

1. He uses magnets. That was the first red flag. He uses them to ""block"" certain parts of the peripheral nervous system during neurological examination, as I understand, maybe to diagnose a disease.
2. A friend said that he examines patients very swiftly, quickly blocking various ""points"" and causing the patients to lose, i.e. motor function, then re-gain it.
3. He claims, that certain visceral organs are associated with certain muscle groups. When those organs are ill, there are pathological changes in the muscles, causing them to spasm and inducing neurological symptoms. By applying pressure to various points, he can fix those problems, maybe diagnose visceral organ diseases.
4. After googling a bit I've found that he already had his license suspended once, he uses other unconventional methods, like homeopathy and, as I've heard, falsifies documents, denies conventional treatment and a lot of other bad bad stuff.

I might pay him a visit to try and see his ""technique"". If I do, I will definitely give an update, but at this moment I need to do some reading up about what he is doing. However, I don't really know what should I be reading up about. What he is doing looks like a weird combination (well, I shouldn't be surprised) of magnetic therapy/magnetism, traditional Chinese medicine with visceral organs reflections on the body, but that is it.

What intrigues me is that neurological examination part and induced paralysis or whatever he is doing there. As I said, I have very little information, but could this be something explainable, like pathological reflexes or some other neurological examination refinements that I am not yet aware of? If so, could you guys provide me a source to read up on that? My first thought was something along the lines of the power of suggestion, something that Derren Brown does: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAv7aGamcy4 (even though I'm a bit skeptical of his work too).

So, do you have any idea what he is doing? How would someone call these techniques? Where could I read up on it? Would really love to get some constructive non-bashing comments.

I must confess I haven't got round to reading much of the great stuff suggested back then (I hate myself as much as you do now!) but I have holidays coming up so I'm psyched to learn loads :D

I have a Science Essay prize in my school over the holidays and I really want to do a neuroscience one so I can learn more (and hopefully win!). The premise for the essay is simply to write a paper on any scientific or technological subject (about 2000 words). Usually, people do things like recent studies etc.

Is there anything in neuroscience recently or an interesting sub-section that I could write about? That fits into the not-too-complicated-but-sophisticated-enough? I am willing to put in 10-20 hours of research/learning work, and I am also signed up for the Drugs and the Brain Coursera. Thanks in advance! You guys rock.

EDIT: Sorry for not giving more background. I have the most rudimentary understanding I would say. I can understand what basic articles are talking about (like SciAm which seems to have a lot of neuro stuff lately). I know synapses etc. But thats about it. I THINK I am pretty good at picking up new topics :) I catch on pretty quickly when learning extra physics stuff from the web.

Thanks for all the suggestions so far! I will investigate them. The optogenics, split brain and empathy look very cool. I think the essay is meant to be more sciencey so I am not sure about the politics :/

INTERESTS: I haven't really delved deep enough yet to develop specific neuroscience interests. I am extremely interested by AI and brain simulation due to my background in CS (last year [my essay linked here](http://cl.ly/1S433c2l3X0u) was on CS but it didnt do very well :( Hopefully that essay gives you an idea of my depth of computer understanding incase there is a possible AI related thing. I thought about the recent brain simulation [at Waterloo](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/147gqm/we_are_the_computational_neuroscientists_behind/). Does that sound reasonable? Or is it too recent/wishy-washy/complicated?

FINALLY: Since there are a lot of PhD peoples here, would someone be able to point me to a good crash course on writing scientific papers (or even neuro papers specifically)? I think they judge quite a lot on style/bibliography-ing.

I've spoken with some folks in my building (mostly undergrads from other labs) who have given me some pretty solid advice (e.g. [Para/Gard](http://trianglebiomedical.com/product/paragard-paraffin-repellent/)!), and I've progressed significantly in my technique. I can reliably produce a 6-section ribbon of samples, transfer them to the water bath, and mount them on slides with few issues. 

I'm still looking for some best practices from people who have sliced *a lot* of tissue... What are some common problems that I'm likely to run into? How do I fix them? Are there any tips that you have discovered that make the process run more smoothly?

My main concerns are with taking samples at the correct anterior-posterior depth (we typically get hit 10-11 locations, taking 2-3 slides per location), recognizing regions of interest (striatum, hippocampus), establishing symmetry (something more precise than just eyeballing it?) and slipcovering (this is maddening).

I need help with some clarification on how it applies to mood disorders, cognitive restructuring, etc.

So, when an individual gets trapped into patterns of thinking, such as negative self talk (""X happened because I'm not good enough."" ""Y happened because I'm too dumb."" ""Z happened because I don't look good enough."" etc.) the neurons that support these thoughts grow stronger, and more positive cognitive patterns (""X happened, but I'll do better next time."" ""Z happened because we aren't compatible,"" etc.) are harder to engage in, because the neurons that support those cognitions are weaker?

Basically: When John engages in negative self talk, he strengthens neurons that ""fire together,"" and weakens positive self talk neurons that aren't firing together. Because of this, John could develop depression, because he engages in so much negative self talk. Is this true?

It seems to be at this point that CBT and cognitive restructuring works to strengthen more 'positive' neural connections. Let me know where/if I am wrong in my assumption.

Thanks for the clarification in advance. I am just interested in how neuroplasticity and neurons firing together influences mood disorders.

**EDIT:** If not these stronger neuron connections, what then does cause ""rut"" thinking? Since CBT is the therapy of choice for most therapists, and cognitive restructuring is part of that, then why does that therapy work biologically?

If you want to do that, go write some diatribe on r/academicphilosophy or r/philosophyofscience. I am asking for a prevalence of particular views* **within the field**, *not for the prevalence of the view* **within your head**.

Part of a thesis I'm writing (without going into much detail about the particulars) involves combatting the argument that research on subjectivity/consciousness has been limited by ""science's"" (as if science were a single agent...) dogmatic acceptance of materialistic reductionism. I'm going with a multi-pronged approach to attack this:

(1) Demonstrate that cognitive science and neuroscience have indeed uncovered a number of facts about ""subjective experience"" or ""consciousness"" (this part is pretty basic, it seems that the entire history of these fields is a testament to that fact)

(2) Demonstrate that scientists working in cognitive science/neuroscience are not ""dogmatically"" committed to materialistic reductionism. I see there being two subpoints here: (a) not all scientists working in the field are physicalists about the mind/brain, and (b) those who are do not accept this thesis dogmatically or as axiomatic; they have actual reasons for supporting this thesis.

Basically, what I'm looking for is some evidence in the literature that supports point 2a. In my experience in the field, this is the case -- I have met a number of people who are either agnostic or kind of crafty dualists -- but I can't really cite my personal experience as a reliable source. Has anyone seen any papers that maybe surveyed scientists on this sort of issue?

P.S. As a sort of corollary question, does anyone think that cognitive science or neuroscience as fields are committed to any particular ontology of mind? I can't think of any paper I've ever read that wasn't just agnostic on this issue, or basically just avoided the question -- kind of just referring to ""conscious experience"" or ""awareness"", without qualifying whether they thought of that as a physical, non-physical, or strange hybrid thing. Can anyone point to any counterexamples?

I've read a decent amount of cognitive science/consciousness stuff, youtube lectures, TED talks, I'm partial to Dennet, etc.  I'm by no means well-versed, but I have a pretty good grasp of how consciousness works.

I have never found a satisfying explanation of what makes ME, ME (as opposed to ""someone else"", if that's even a valid thing to say).  I can gather first-hand evidence for MY mental processes happening in MY head, but *why* do they have to end there, at the edge of my skull?  That question leads into: If I had a way to interface perfectly with another brain or a synthetic apparatus that would allow me to, say, see through its ""eyes"" and use its visual processing faculties, could ""I"" consider that part of ""ME""? 

To jump probably way too far next:  If i could likewise interface completely with another ""stand-alone mind"" (a machine that could think and perceive and feel more or less exactly as I can) and I could experience through that one as well as my own anatomy, would I be able to turn off my biological body and continue experiencing through the other one?  If not, why not?  Where am ""I"" and Why?!?

Obviously I'm just looking for ideas and directions and that's the most I would expect.

The question, I think, has two parts. First, we can assume that any neuron in the human nervous system can be linked to any other through a series of connections. Many neurons will be directly connected. Others will be two, three, or four degrees of separation away, each degree corresponding to the number of synapses you have to pass through to get from one neuron, to the next.

There will be, theoretically, two neurons that are the least connected to one another - you have to go through more links to get between them than any other two neurons in the nervous system. We will call the above two neurons the ""least connected"" neurons - note this does not refer to their total connections to other neurons, but rather the number of links you have to go through to get from one to the other. 

The first part of the question is, where might these two neurons be? Presumably enough is known about gross anatomical connections in the nervous system to estimate. Distance alone may be a good rough indicator - perhaps one would be in the retina and one the spinal cord, or one in the frontal lobe and one in the retina. Perhaps someone else has a good opinion?

The second part of the question is more interesting. The second question is: between these two least connected neurons, how many links (synapses), roughly, are there? 10? 100? More, less?

I am interested in this because I feel such a number will be small, and will demonstrate just how highly connected the brain really is - that even the two least connected neurons will only be a few steps away from (theoretically) influencing each other.",,False,,t5_2qu9b,False,,,True,t3_bvpsx,http://www.reddit.com/r/neuro/comments/bvpsx/neural_connectivity_how_far_away_are_the_two/,

Anterograde amnesia - "" loss of the ability to create new memories after the event that caused the amnesia, leading to a partial or complete inability to recall the recent past, while long-term memories from before the event remain intact.""

By the Wikipedia definitions, I understand that Jimmie G has anterograde amnesia because he can remember everything up to 1945 clearly, but he has been unable to form new memories since then.

So why does Sacks keep talking about Jimmie G's ""retrograde amnesia""? Shouldn't it be anterograde instead?

I'm reading a paper for a class, and I'm pretty stumped by a parenthetical explanation in the figure legend that can be found here: 
http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3201789/figure/F2/

I'm referring to part b that reads, ""(note that the average amplitude of individual subjects’ peak values is not equal to the peak amplitude of the grand-averaged waveform due to inter-subject variation in peak latency).""

I don't know much at all about ERPs, but despite multiple attempts at searching Google for an answer, I am still unsure of the implications of that statement. My understanding is that an ERP is an average of numerous EEG segments (numerous recordings from all subjects, with each subject himself having numerous recordings) from roughly the same time interval post-stimulus presentation. In this study, the stimulus is the presentation of a facial expression.

So, if there were a variation in latency between recordings, wouldn't that only affect the timing of the peak (i.e., its position with regard to the x-axis (ms)) and not the amplitude? If the grand-averaged waveform represents an average of all of the individual averages, why do the amplitudes (for each expression) of the N240 peak on the grand-averaged waveform differ from the average peak amplitudes (for each expression)? There must be something I'm missing here--I'm just not sure what it could be. If anyone has the time to point me in the right direction, I would greatly appreciate it. I hope my explanation of my own understanding isn't too convoluted. If it is, feel free to ask for clarification. Thanks a bunch!

In my early twenties I started to have some strange symptoms, the most prominent one being that I constantly felt like I was kind of drunk, but with no balance issues. This went on for a little while, and then lightened up for several years. I was always told it was anxiety and that I was fine. Fast forward to about 3 months ago, I was finishing up the semester at school, and the symptoms that were once very light an not always noticeable, started to return...but a lot more intense. These symptoms ended up giving me a panic attack and I went to the ER because I thought it could possibly be a blood sugar issue. Blood work came back ok, so the neurologist ordered an MRI and CT scan. The radiologist's report of these tests showed that I have a tortuous vessel with mass effect on the 8th cranial nerve. 

I thought I had found the answer to my condition. However, when the neurologist AND neurosurgeon at the hospital reviewed the test results, they both said they didn't think that it was what was causing my problem. I am disappointed, because this ""condition"" has become debilitating, and it is not getting any better. 

From everything I have read, it described perfectly when people talk about Derealization/Depersonalization. I have also read that this can be cause by anxiety, but my anxiety is actually really low after 3 months.

I would like to know if there is any paper/research showing the direct effect of the monoamine on the production of emotive movements. By this, I mean that by controlling the release of monoamine in the body we can see a difference in the production of emotional body movements.

My question is a bit unfortunately put, to clarify in other words:

**I don't want to know whether we react on positive events (such as joy) or negative ones (e.g. fear), which would be the quality of the event. Instead, my question addresses the quality of the the reaction that is caused by the event, through the mirror neurons, and whether the quality of the reaction depends on the quality of the event.**

Two situations be given:

a. A man sees another suffer of violence caused by nature, i.e. a flood.
His mirror neurons become active. Does the man feel pity because he might

- I. suffer in place of the other (negative quality)

- II. not want the other man to suffer for the reason of the other man being (positive)

- III. not want the other man to suffer for the reason of the other man being *a living entity as (1.) / like (2.) himself* (negative)


b. A man sees another enjoying hapiness. His mirror neurons become active. Does the man feel joy because he might

- I. be in the position of the other man (negative)

- II. wants the other man to enjoy happiness for the reason of the other man being (positive)

- III. wants the other man to enjoy happiness for the reason of the other man being *a living entity as (1.) / like (2.) himself* (negative)


As you can see, aI - aIII1./2. - bI - bIII1./2. all imply a egoistic motivation (negative), whereas aII and bII would speak for truly altruistic motivation, defined by Jonathan Seglow as having to be neccesarily non-enforced. Of course we could then say it would be not enforced by likelihood but the human mind itself.

So I'm wondering whether there might be enfcorcment on the neurological layer that is either limited to oneself (aI-bI) or one's kind (aIII1.-bIII1. , or even stronger to one's species aIII2.-bIII2.) or only limited to the existence of the other (aII-bII; which is in fact limited as well, but I don't want to take non-existant things in account).

I would mostly be running experiments for the PI though. They have 1yr of funding for a tech, and then it depends on grants. I would work some weekends. 

Job B - New professor, just started teaching in Sept so he's a bit slow and disorganized with the hiring process. He has funding for a tech for 2 years and of course depending on grants afterwards. The prof has one grad student, might get another and has a couple of undergrads. I would probably work every weekend it seems. I was told I was the best qualified out of the pool of candidates and we have another interview scheduled. (Is that a good sign? I'm trying not to get too hopeful, I've had several rejections.)

I have had congenital torticollis since I was born. It was the cause of multiple ear infections (which lead to tubes) and other issues as a child. I attended regular physical therapy sessions until I was a few years old and visited a chiropractor when I was a young teenager (12-14 or so).

Currently, I am 24, I have no real cosmetic issues due to the torticollis. I have a slight head tilt to the left and a little misalignment of my features on my face. The only other issue is my eye which twitches open widely when I chew or open my jaw fully.

Over a year ago I started developing urinary incontinence and hesitancy. When my urinary issues did not subside and increased (developed a pain when urinating) I visited a urologist. After having a Cystogram, they regretfully couldn't identify any issues.

A couple months ago, I developed a pins and needles feeling that occurred occasionally in my hands and/or feet. Typically, due to the muscle formation in my neck caused by torticollis, I feel like my neck and back are usually quite sore or in pain.

After doing my own research, I'm beginning to wonder if I have developed Neuropathy... my only possible explanation for the pins and needles feelings I am having however could be from past injuries in my wrists and ankles from the daily skateboarding I did for about 6 years and my habitual video games I have enjoyed since I was about 3 years old.

I'm not from neuro/cog. science. I'm from artificial intelligence, with a background in mathematics and computer science. I want to share my thoughts about a topic that interests me very much. I have layman+ knowledge of the brain and would like constructive comments, proving me false or backing me up, from neuro/cogsci.
_________________________________________________
Why is it that we feel no effort for tasks such as vision (recognition) and that we are good both for top-down and bottom-up reasoning (we can link trajectory interpolation with conscious thinking) ?
I have an hypothesis: I think that the data structures within our brain are better (by far) than the ones we currently use when programming. When programming, we have to make a choice over which operation we want in O(1) and which ones are OK to be in O(n). Advanced data structures allow for ""normally exclusive"" O(1) operations to be executed in constant time, at the cost of this constant time being bigger, or other operations. For instance some data structures have many ""scaffolding"" around the data, but all structures have to be kept up-to-date. I think that our brain has a mega-super-structure like this.

The most basic example is whether we need an array or a (linked) list. Accessing the Nth element of an array is O(1), we simply have to look at the memory address of the beginning of the array plus N times the size of one element. For a list, we have to follow the pointers (links), N times for a simply linked list. On the contrary, adding an element to an array may need more memory and so a new memory allocation and a deep copy. Adding an element to a linked list is easy, allow memory and point on it. Good for insertion/deletion, bad for random access. We have to make a choice. It takes less time to know if an element is inside a set than inside a(n) (unsorted) array or a list but we cannot randomly access the nth element and insertion is longer than for a list.

One illustration of that is simple: consider a NxN 2D map with M items on it. Either you can represent the M items and store their (x, y) values or you can store on each the map tiles which items are on it. If you store the items with their positions, knowing where a given item is, or moving it, is easy, just change its coordinates, but you have to iterate potentially over all items (O(M)) if you want to know which items are on a particular map tile. If you store the items in the tiles, it's quick and easy to know which items are on given tiles, but knowing where is a given item and/or move it is a pain (O(N^2)). You get it. Now, we could have both structures and pointers to where the data really is, but keeping this pointers structure up to date is quite some work. That's where I think than our brain differ: these kind of tasks seem easy to deal with, because we may have a super data structure thanks to our neurons (and their connections), and maintaining it up to date is a background work that we are really used to. We even do that while sleeping. So, perhaps that's the singularity of our brain, that we don't trade memory for processing time or the other way around, because both are united.

1371117423.0,8,self.neuro,1g9cd1,"I had a transformative experience that cured my depression, inattention, aphasia, motivation &amp; anxiety problems and left me with enhanced senses. Wtf happened?",22,14,35,http://www.reddit.com/r/neuro/comments/1g9cd1/i_had_a_transformative_experience_that_cured_my/,"
Background: I've been struggling with (many of the recognised) depressive symptoms, substance use, adhd-like inattentivity, social anxiety and a weird kind of speech thing where I know the word I want is there but I can't access it. Social interactions, creativity and mental faculties all felt like a big cognitive effort for me. This has been going on for all of recent memory, at least since late teens, hard to say about earlier.

Now, I am a fairly experienced psychonaut and a couple nights ago I decided to take a trip with a paricular substance I'll avoid naming, ostensibly continuing the search for myself (see [this thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/Psychonaut/comments/1fq737/i_feel_like_i_am_myself_on_psychedelics_how_do_i/)). Part of the goal with this trip was to help me quit an irritating small scale opiate addiction.

So the interesting part of the story came near the peak of my trip, where I had an experience of being ""reborn"", and a feeling of my different selves being integrated -- confident, articulate, engaging self and anxious, withdrawn self. I don't feel that I intended or directed this event at the time, it just sort of happened to me. Following this experience I sort of came to, not so much in the usual way of phasing into clarity that I've experienced on this substance; more like awakening from unconsciousness.

Soon after, although still quite high, I noticed my vision and auditory senses were enhanced. It felt like I had full clarity of vision, sort of like going from 240p to 1080p, or taking off a pair of dark sunglasses. I have had similar enhanced sensory effects on this and other psychedelics before, but not quite to this extent and always transitory. It felt almost natural, as though this were the normal capacity of my senses finally being utilised properly. Cognitively I felt confident and alert and very much ""myself"". Not a trace of anxiety.

As I came down, these effects remained. Now it's two days later and they have not faded or diminished. I feel like I am my complete, fully realised self. The confidence and lack of anxiety is fucking great, and I feel awesome, despite the lingering effects of opiate withdrawal. I don't feel high at all; completely sober in fact. It's sort of like the experience of cognitive enhancement from taking modafinil, except this is significantly more profound an effect and also feels less like enhancement and more like my faculties operating at full natural capacity (although given the relative change, there is also the enhanced feeling; just different to having taken a stimulant).

Now, I have a few theories about what might have happened but I will try to avoid biasing your response. Subjectively it doesn't feel like I am still high or that this is an afterglow or something like that (keep in mind I have a lot of experience with various drugs and their effects and after-effects).

List of changes:

- Improved sensory function and clarity (all senses)
- Better mental clarity and energy; memory and attention are much improved
- No longer a big mental effort to generate speech &amp; writing, or to socialise. I feel like I am constantly in a state of ""flow"" doing these things now.
- Anxiety (social and otherwise) gone
- Far easier to feel pleasure, happy, excited
- Better motor feedback and coordination
- More physical energy
- The desire to take drugs is gone; the interest in psychedelics is still there, but the needs to find myself and to ""fill a gap"" are gone.
- I feel warmer; better circulation to extremities (I had chronically poor circulation)
- Pupils a little more dilated than usual, although still normally responsive (I had a doc check me up and they noted nothing abnormal)
- Feeling of my head being fully ""pressurised"", not sure how to explain it, but I've often felt before (subjectively) that I've had insufficient blood flow to my brain and now I feel fully ""inflated"" and alert.
- Inattentive problems gone; it's no longer an enormous effort to stay engaged &amp; awake in lectures or conversations
- Motivated, increased mental energy &amp; stamina
- Easy to form mental associations, which has made creativity so much more natural and pleasurable. I can play music and improvise effortlessly.
- My ongoing problem with grasping for words is gone; I can have long flowy stream of consciousness conversations with no effort now.
- Feeling of being in ""engaged"" mode, not ""withdrawn"" mode.

Now, I have a few concerns that I might have broken something in my brain or that I'm being flooded with some neutransmitter and will crash hard. Although I don't really feel ""up"" or wired or manic. It doesn't feel like dopamine. It doesn't feel like a psychological change has occurred (I have had many revelatory experiences on psychedelics before and they've produced nothing like this). It feels very physiological, like some obstruction was suddenly cleared and all of a sudden I'm at full capacity. I'm skeptical that I could have just ""gotten over"" depression and all those problems at the flick of a psychological switch. And I don't think I ever was a textbook depression case, always having had a positive, optimistic outlook and maintaining a large number of interests and hobbies.


**TL/DR:** my ongoing depressive, inattentive, social anxiety and motivation issues ""cured"" during a psychedelic trip, leaving me with enhanced cognitive function, confidence, and enhanced sensory perceptions.

Why does the electrode need to be grounded, and where are electrodes  grounded during an electrophysiology experiment?

I had/have depression since about 6th grade. During my junior year is when I actually got help for it, that was 7 years ago. I am not on medication anymore and I feel like I can actually handle life and all its stress now, but....I still have this empty feeling inside, nothing like the feeling of depression though, more like a lack of emotion. I don't feel like I need to seclude myself. I have some friends and I have a stable job in sales (funny isn't it). 

I just feel like I don't truly know what love is or even what true mourning is. I just feel like I'm in a constant state of boredom, I do feel like I feel happy most of the time, I laugh, smile, and joke most of the time, but there is always that underlying feeling of boredom. 

For example, recently I had lost my grandfather on my mother's side. While I was at the viewing, I saw many crying and all the sadness of his passing, my sister (2 years younger than I) was one of the worst. Bawling her eyes out most of the time she was there. I, on the otherhand, just felt nothing. As I stood at his casket, nothing. All I saw was an older man lying there motionless, never stirring. No feeling of sadness or mourning, just nothing. I should mention I was pallbearer for this funeral, and again, I feel like I should be honored to be carrying the casket, but nothing once more. All I was concerned about was not dropping the casket. 

So, my questions are as follows. Do people who have seemingly conquered depression, still have a problem with emotions afterwards?

I've volunteered in a couple of labs, with one proff saying he'd be more than happy to take me on as a graduate student.

Over the past year, I've become more interested in the topic of plasticity in regards to visual neurological disorders/recovery with neuro-imaging (this probably sounds bad/bland/not precise, still have to do more research).

Anyone have advice in regards to applying to work with a proff in a different uni than your undergrad? Is it not recommended?

Just to make it worse, I may apply to medical school after my MSc, which I know may be severely looked down upon by a proff when accepting potential grad students, but the proff I work with now is already aware of my intentions and has no problem with it (has had previous graduate students after their masters for Medical school).

To clarify, if an organism is presented with a stimulus and the organism responds to the stimulus 100% of the time in a stereotypical manner, is decision-making involved? Or does the organism have to have two or more stimuli present in order for a decision to be made?

I have been having a debate with someone and I've taken the position that one stimulus is all that is needed to evoke a decision being made; the decision is to either act on it or to not act on it. The other person thinks that decision-making requires choosing between at least two things. For example, if you give a normal insect light (assuming nothing is wrong with it), it will always go towards the light. From my perspective, the insect can either choose to go to the light or not go to the light. Through evolutionary processes, it has acquired a certain behavior that says, ""Go towards the light."" Even though the fly will always go towards it, the option of not going towards it still exists. It is merely that one choice now completely dominates because of evolutionary processes. The other person thinks that this is merely a reflex like behavior. *He thinks that if the fly does not go to the light (given the first idea), it is a failure to act rather than the fly choosing to not go to the light.* He thinks that in order for it to be a decision, the fly must choose between two things (i.e. you present the light but at the light source you have a heat source as well; does the fly choose to go to the light or does it choose to avoid the heat source?). The fly would then make its decision based on integrating how hot the heat is versus how attractive the light is.

I'm not an expert in decision theory so I present the people of r/neuro this question. Which definition of decision-making is more accurate? Are they both wrong?

2) G-coupled proteins at the synapse react to the increase in serotonin the synaptic gap, which in turn affect transcription factors.  These transcription factors control certain genes being ""turned on or off"".  The latency period is the time it takes for these changes to take effect.

I am very fascinated in neuroscience and I have a educational question. I've talked to some student counselors about neuroscience and how to get into the field, (I am living and will be studying in Sweden), and they basicly just referred me to Medical School (Doctor) which i don't really have any interest nor grades to get into. Getting into Medical School in Sweden is extremely hard, need max grades for it. 

Anywho, my goal was to study to become a civilengineer. Where I live, Linköping, our university has a very good Civil Engineer in Computer Science course, and as a Master we have Artifical Intelligence. 

To the point, would it be possible to become a neuroscientist by studying Computer Science as bachlor, AI as Masters and just taking a lot of biology/neuroscience courses on the side? Possible to get a PhD in Neuroscience after that?  My father, who works at the university but not in any biological department, says that scientific groups are indeed interested in taking in people a bit ""outside"" of neuro, but if you have read some on the side.

TL;DR: Can i become a neuroscientist with a bachlor in Computer Science, Masters in AI + additional biology and neuroscience courses on the side, read throughout the 5 years.

Some of them are pretty old, from the era when the privacy rules seemed to be not that strict, and some of them are uploaded by people themselves.

The recent video of a transient global amnesia that was shared here on Reddit (http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3fA5uzWDU8) reminded me of these case representations, so I decided to share with you this collection of selected links. Maybe it will save some time for you.

I decided not to major in public health because the job market for just a BS is pretty poor -with an MPH being standard. I decided that if I did want to go into that field later I could go for a master's degree. MPH degrees don't seem to require any specific major (or even a field of related majors) for admission - so it is something I can keep open. Is the same true for neuroscience?

I need your help for science!

I'm running a live experiment for the Science Festival at the University of Cambridge (UK) this week, as part of a public lecture on the connectivity of brains and other networks. We will be mapping the network of twitter activity about the lecture itself, both during the lecture and ahead of time. To be part of this [beautiful network](http://comms.group.cam.ac.uk/sciencefestival/twitterbrain/), all you have to do is tweet (and more importantly, get people to re-tweet) with the tag #csftwitterbrain. 
Re-tweets are important because they will form the links in the network. I will post the results at the end of next week!

Brain: The medial left temporal lobe is abnormal. It is asymmetrically
enlarged and has high T2/FLAIR signal, centered at the amygdala. There is no
hippocampal sclerosis. The left temporal and inferior left frontal cortex is
slightly bright on T2/FLAIR. No evidence of hemorrhage, mass, or acute
infarction. The ventricles are normal in size and morphology. There is no
abnormal enhancement.

Soft tissues and marrow: Unremarkable
Face and orbits: Bilateral maxillary sinus mucus retention cysts.

IMPRESSION:

Signal abnormality and enlargement of the left medial temporal lobe. This may
be due to underlying mass, cortical dysplasia, chronic seizures, or less likely
a subtle presentation of herpes encephalitis.



I have personally viewed this procedure/exam, reviewed this report, and made
changes to it where appropriate.

ROUTINE EEG

Indication: evaluate for epileptiform abnormalities

History: 27 y/o male with new onset seizure on 7/19, beginning
with vertigo, confusion, and progressing to a generalized
convulsion. EEG requested to evaluate for epileptiform
abnormalities. 

Methods:
This study was a Routine EEG with a duration of 29 minutes. The
digital recording was performed with routine electrodes applied
according to the 10-20 electrode placement system. The record
included video, EKG, and EOG monitoring. EEG was reviewed
electronically. Automated digital spike and seizure detection
analysis was used, along with patient-activated alarms and
nursing observations. 

EEG Description

Interictal Record: In the maximally awake and alert state, there
is a well formed, poorly sustained, reactive posterior dominant
rhythm of 10 Hertz of low amplitude identified. Prominent lower
voltage, faster frequency beta activity was present diffusely.
Occasional brief, mild, sharply contoured focal slowing was
observed over the left temporal region. Two 1-2 second bursts of
sharply contoured, generalized but frontally predominant 6-7
Hertz activity were observed during periods of drowsiness. These
bursts did not show any clear intermixed spikes or slow waves,
and were not accompanied by any clinical correlate. No
epileptiform discharges were present. The patient entered the
drowsy state, but no segment of Stage I or Stage II sleep was
recorded. Stage II sleep is characterized by symmetric sleep
spindles, vertex waves, and K-complexes. 

Activation: Hyperventilation was performed and produced some mild
diffuse slowing, but no abnormal responses. Photic stimulation
was performed and produced a symmetric driving response, but no
photoparoxysmal discharges or other abnormal responses. 

Events/Seizures: No events or seizures are recorded. 

EKG: The single-channel EKG recording shows a sinus rhythm. 

Interpretation: This is an abnormal awake and drowsy EEG. The
presence of mild intermittent, sharply contoured focal slowing
over the left temporal region is suggestive of an underlying
physiologic or structural disturbance in this area. No
epileptiform discharges were identified. Additionally, two brief
paroxysmal bursts of generalized, but frontally predominant,
sharply contoured theta activity was observed. No intermixed
spike or slow wave activity was present during these bursts to
clearly indicate that they represent an epileptiform abnormality.
This finding is of uncertain significance, though paroxysmal
bursts of generalized theta activity have been described in some
patients with primarily generalized epilepsy. Clinical
correlation is advised.

INPATIENT NEUROLOGY HISTORY AND PHYSICAL

 is a 27 yo RH man minimal PHMx whom neurology is consulted on for first time seizure. He reports he was getting his allergy shots this AM, waited 30 minutes and then drove back to his work on his bike. He noticed 10 minutes after leaving the clinic he was lightheaded, felt vertigo and unsteady on his feet. In both eyes he saw a circular rainbow, like a stalled MAC OS sign in both eyes. This last about 2-3 minutes. He was able to get back to work, sit in his chair and next thing he knew he woke up on the floor.
His friend Don was the event and said he was sitting up in chair and then tightened up and then shook all over. He got him to the floor and he was flailing about. His eyes were looking around, there was no fixed eye deviation and head was pointed straight. The length of convulsions was less that a commercial, so he estimates a few minutes, but it felt like ""15"". Pt did not receive any medications to abort seizure. He was throwing up. He reports taking a few minutes to get back to normal. He bit his tongue on the R side, but urinary or stool incontinence. No prior history of convulsions. No history lips smacking, staring, losing tract of time. He is back to normal.
Risk factors: no birth complicated, went through college, never held back, no family history of seizure, no febrile seizures, no meningitis or encephalitis, or LOC &gt; 30 min
Prior injections okay, molds, dust, pollen, tree and grasses.

Assessment:
27 yo RH man minimal PHMx whom neurology is consulted on for first time seizure. There are no clear provoking factors, though history appears consistent with seizure. There are no deficits on exam and pt is back to baseline. He would benefit from outpatient seizure work-up including MRI epilepsy protocol and EEG. Would recommend pt to be with family and his girlfriend has agreed to stay with him (until formally moving in in 2 weeks). As this is first time unprovoked seizure would not start AED. Would give rectal diastat if there is concern for GTC.

Recommendations:
-MRI epilepsy protocol outpatient
-Out patient EEG
-Rectal distat if GTC &gt; 2 min
-Seizure precautions, no driving, ED to discuss with patient
-Family educated to call or return pt to ED for recurrent events

I've been listening to some music yesterday and for about 6 hours I would often get ""the chills"" ( which is connected to dopamine release, please correct me if I'm wrong). By often I mean twice every minute or so - one such chill consisting of a few ""waves"" each getting more intense than the previous one. I stopped listening to the music for about 1-2h (in the 6h interval) and then began to listen again - chills were back also. 

Then I was going to sleep but i wanted to listen some more so I was lying and listening to the music with chills. Then I noticed that I was seeing subtle flashing lights and when I closed my eyes I saw something like a grid structure. I never had such visuals (even when I was trying to achieve sleep paralysis) and when I turned off the music and calm myself from the chills the visuals quickly disappeared.

Each of them is capable of recognizing just one pattern, consists of, on average, 100 neurons, and takes, on average, 8 inputs (page 196).

I couldn't find an explanation of where these numbers come from, other than that the number of pattern recognizers is the estimated total number of neurons in the neocortex (30 billion) divided by the average number of neurons in each pattern recognizer (100).

Wouldn't it be more logical to assume that each neuron is a pattern recognizer in its own right, and each synapse is its input, and so there should be 30 billion pattern recognizers with 1000+ inputs each?

Is there any neuroscience research that supports Kurzweil's claims? Links to review papers, video lectures, etc. are most welcome.

**Edit** A mini-column has about 100 neurons, and its neurons tend to activate together, so perhaps it could be argued that they detect just one pattern (Kurzweil actually writes that a mini-column does not have to coincide with a pattern recognizer), still 

* Why just 8 inputs per pattern recognizer (instead of 100 * 1000+)?
* Do the neurons in a mini-column activate because of their inputs or because some other neurons in the same mini-column activated?",,False,,t5_2qu9b,1356245811.0,,,True,t3_15b3so,http://www.reddit.com/r/neuro/comments/15b3so/ask_neuro_why_100_neurons_per_pattern_recognizer/,

For several months now I've been entertaining the idea of going to grad school in social or cognitive neuroscience, but I found out yesterday after speaking to a professor in the area that the requirements to be a competitive applicant to those programs involve a lot more programming and mathematics than I was aware of. I've never been a fan of math, and in order to take all the classes I need to I would have to really load my schedule for the remaining two years with it. I'm willing to do it if I know that that's what I want to do, but now I'm not so sure. 

So, I was hoping I could get some advice from you, r/neuro. How might I find out if this is something I really want to pursue? Our college teaches one social neuroscience class every other year (and not this year), and that class focuses more on the results (which I know I'm interested in) and less on the methods and analysis (which I know less about). If this is your area, what was your analytical and computational background?

My biggest worry is that I do the work to go down this path and discover that I dislike the math more than I like the neuroscience, but by then I will have missed my opportunity to take more psychology and sociology courses which I know I like.
