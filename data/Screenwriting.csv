1365568854.0,183,self.Screenwriting,1c1l3s,Screenwriting 101,209,26,35,http://www.reddit.com/r/Screenwriting/comments/1c1l3s/screenwriting_101/,"I'm hoping this post will cover the essentials of screenwriting, from idea generation to selling your script. I cannot add to this post because I have reached the max character count.

**1. IDEA GENERATION**

While sometimes writers have those ah-ha! moments where we are flooded with a mostly thought out concept, sometimes we need to activate our brains. There are several techniques for this, but they all revolve around the same basic theory: start with one aspect of the story and build from there.

For example, every protagonist has a goal or want. Come up with that goal first. Then, you can build upon that. Why would it be interesting to see this character have that particular goal? What kind of problems would a character face in trying to achieve this goal? Remember, Harold &amp; Kumar Go To White Castle was a successful comedy spawning two sequels, and it's entire premise is ""two stoners want a cheeseburger."" So no idea is off limits here.

**2. HOW DO I TURN THE IDEA INTO A SCRIPT?**

Every writer swears by their own technique. Some writers will start with coming up with an initial logline. The benefits are having something to guide you while writing, as well as being able to use the logline with others when they ask what you're writing about. That way, you can gauge their response to the idea as well as politely answer them and not provide something like ""uhh, it's kind of complicated...""

But something almost all writers will do is have something of an outline. What does an outline look like? That's going to vary widely. Some writers prefer to keep their outlines bare bones and will only map out key points (typically plot points). Other writers will get detailed and break it down by scene. An outline may have notes such as ""Hero captured by Villain in their lair,"" where others might write out things such as what the scene/sequence/act tension is, what the character goals are for the scene/sequence/act, and so on.

There is no right or wrong way to outline. It's whatever will help you write.

**3. STRUCTURE**

Many writers will base their outlines on specific structures or formulas. Structure is what gives the story a feeling of cohesiveness, that feeling that the writer knows what he or she is doing. There are many theories on structure. Below are two popular structures.

* Plot point/3-Act-based Structure

There are variations within this, but I'm combining them here for simplicity. Essentially, structures of this type suggest that screenplays should be written in three acts (a beginning, middle, and end). Acts 1 and 3 should each be roughly 25% of the script, and Act 2 should be roughly 50% of the script.

Some structures and formulas of this type will have a few plot points, while others may be filled with them. Some basic plot points will include the inciting incident, act breaks, midpoint, climax, and resolution. Plot points are essentially mile markers that help the writer keep the story interesting and with purpose.

3. [Screenplay: The Foundations of Screenwriting](http://www.amazon.com/Screenplay-Foundations-Screenwriting-Syd-Field/dp/0385339038), by Syd Field

* Sequence Structure

Sequence structure is based off of three acts as well. Plot points can be used with this still, but the idea behind this technique is break the script down into small chunks that are easy to handle (plot points are often the end of the sequence).

The common version of this holds that there should be eight sequences in the script. Sequences are roughly 12-15 pages in length. If you do the math, you'll notice that eight 12-page sequences is 90 pages, and eight 15-page sequences is 120 pages. Each sequence should have it's own tension, a question that the audience worries about, in addition to the story's main tension (which is usually ""will the protagonist succeed?""). The purpose for this is to constantly have something for the audience to be concerned about, thus getting them to invest in the movie. And since your tension changes every 12-15 pages, your script is less likely to become boring.

Here's what sequence structure ends up looking like:

Act|Sequence|Notes
:---|:---|:---
Act One | Sequence One | Often ends with inciting incident
 | Sequence Two | Ends in Act Break 1
Act Two | Sequence Three |
 | Sequence Four | Ends in Midpoint
 | Sequence Five | 
 | Sequence Six | Ends in Act Break 2
Act Three | Sequence Seven | Often ends with a false resolution or twist
 | Sequence Eight | Ends in resolution

2. [The Eight Sequences](http://thescriptlab.com/screenwriting/structure/the-sequence/45-the-eight-sequences), by The Script Lab

* Television Structure

Television is a different beast when it comes to structure, largely because of commercials. Acts don't really mean the same thing that they do in feature writing. A 30-minute show may consist of a teaser, two acts (commercial break separating them), and a tag, for instance. But this would not apply to every show.

The best way to learn structure for television is to read television scripts. If you're writing a pilot spec, read scripts of shows similar to yours. If you're writing a spec of a current show, read scripts from that show. Break them down and truly analyze them.

**4. HOW DO I ACTUALLY WRITE THE SCRIPT?**

There are numerous tools out there for writing scripts, available on PC, Mac, Android, and iOS. Here is a list of some:

* [Final Draft](http://www.finaldraft.com) (Windows / Mac / iOS) - The desktop versions of this software are considered the industry standard, and the company claims its mobile version lives up to the name as well.
* [Celtx](http://www.celtx.com) (Windows / Mac / Linux / iOS / Android) - The basic version of this software is free. The desktop version also provides many pre-production tools so you can actually film your script as well.
* [Movie Magic Screenwriter](http://www.screenplay.com) (Windows / Mac) - Another full featured program. But the company has many other tools available to assist in the writing process
* [Scrivener](http://literatureandlatte.com/) (Windows / Mac) - Although not intended specifically for screenplays, the program offers a lot. It can be used to outline and create character notes, write the script itself, or used as a rough draft tool and then exported into Final Draft for final publishing. There's also a bunch of tools for writing beyond screenplays as well, including novels, poetry, theses, textbooks, ebooks, etc.

**5. I WROTE THE SCRIPT. NOW WHAT?**

Assuming you have received feedback and rewrote your script, you're now off to sell it, or yourself as a writer for future work, or both. There are two main avenues for this that I'll touch on.

* Competitions / Fellowships

These will not sell your script directly, however you may make contacts at these events. Winning a competition can result in prizes and bragging rights. Fellowships are almost like jobs because you are essentially being paid to write.

Top Competitions and Fellowships:

1. [Nicholl Fellowship](http://www.oscars.org/awards/nicholl/) - Winners are paid $35,000 and must complete a new feature screenplay over the next year.
2. [Austin Film Festival](http://www.austinfilmfestival.com/) - Considered by many to be the top film festival for screenwriters.
3. Production Company Fellowships - Many big name companies offer fellowship competitions. You're often competing for what amounts to a paid internship where you learn from within the company. Some companies include [Disney/ABC](http://www.abctalentdevelopment.com/), [Nickelodeon](http://www.nickwriting.com/home/), and [Warner Brothers](http://writersworkshop.warnerbros.com/).
4. [Withoutabox](http://www.withoutabox.com) - Not a competition itself, but is a place where you can submit to numerous competitions and not have to be constantly filling out forms. Most of the competitions listed will be smaller and not necessarily ones that will truly advance your career. But you never know.

* Pitching / Queries

Here you are directly selling yourself and script. You can pitch to an agent, a manager, or a production company. A query is essentially a pitch in letter format. With both, you are trying to get the person or company interested in reading what you wrote.

Pitches come in two basic forms: the elevator pitch and the formal pitch. The elevator pitch is where you only have maybe 30-seconds to pitch your idea. The name comes from the idea of meeting a producer or development exec on the elevator and pitching them within that amount of time. This is where your logline comes in real handy. The formal pitch can last 5-minutes, 15-minutes, or longer depending on the circumstance. With both types of pitches, you are giving the best aspect(s) of your script - the parts that make the person you're pitching to practically beg you to read it.

There are also pitching festivals, such as [The Great American Pitchfest](https://pitchfest.com/), where for a fee you will able to network and pitch your script.

A query is a one-page letter that is sent out to these same people. At minimum it'll contain your contact information and a logline. Many writers choose to expand on that and include things such as a one-paragraph synopsis, or maybe even a sentence or two about major characters. If your script has won a competition, you may wish to include that information as well (especially if it's a big competition).

2. [Pitches](http://johnaugust.com/qanda/pitches), by John August

**6. WHAT ABOUT AGENTS AND MANAGERS?**

The rule goes that you cannot sell a script without an agent. This isn't entirely true. You are free to query your work without one, and you can sell your work without one. This works well for smaller production companies, because they are in need of good scripts as much as your are in need of a payday.

But if you want to sell to a major production company, an agent will increase your odds of selling, so they can be quite handy to have.

* Agent

An agent is a representative of talent. They get people hired. Depending on the company, you may be represented by an individual or a team. Some top-end agencies are: [William Morris](http://www.wmeentertainment.com) (WME), [Creative Artists](http://www.caa.com) (CAA), [ICM](http://www.icmtalent.com/), and [United Talent](http://www.unitedtalent.com/) (UTA). Agents are paid when you get paid. The average pay for agents is 10% (this can vary depending on local laws). If they say you owe them money upfront to hire them, they are a scam.

* Manager

A manager focuses more on your career as a whole rather than getting specific work. Your manager should have excellent contacts and work with you. A manager will have fewer clients and work more directly with you. Managers are paid much like agents, but don't be surprised when they are asking more for 15% or 20% until you become established.

**7. HOW DO I GET A JOB AS A TV WRITER?**

You should have some original work, but you're also going to want some scripts based on current shows as well. Think of these as fanfic specs, where you are writing a wholly original episode of a series. You should have these resemble actual scripts of the show as much as possible in terms of structure, dialogue, story arcs, etc. Do not write ""big"" episodes where an aspect of your episode would continue into future episodes, such as introducing a new character or killing a character off. Your spec should be stand-alone, and be based off of a ""typical"" episode, not a sweeps. You should also write for a show that's in at least its second season.

A major point that needs to be noted here is DO NOT write for the show you want to write for. Write for a similar one instead. If you want to write for New Girl, write a spec for Raising Hope. The reason is that the people behind the show you want to write for cannot legally read your script. If they did and ended up doing something from it (intentionally or not), you can now sue them.

**7a. I HAVE THE PERFECT SCRIPT FOR HBO/SHOWTIME/FX/AMC**

I'm writing this as a separate section because it seems to be talked about a lot on here. The network isn't who you want to talk to. You want to talk to production companies. Essentially how it works is the network will purchase rights to air the show from the production company. So you need to talk to the people who actually make the shows.

I should note that some networks have their own production companies, such as ABC owning ABC Studios, but they are separate companies.

Example: Scrubs was produced by a company called Doozer. NBC had the airing rights. When NBC cancelled Scrubs, Doozer was able to take the show over to ABC. ABC, however, had Scrubs co-produced with ABC Studios (then called Touchstone Television) as part of the arrangement.

**8. SHOULD I GO TO FILM SCHOOL?**

There's no easy answer to this one. Film schools provide a lot of knowledge, but most of it can be learned from other sources. The number one reason to go to a film school is to make contacts. But this is useful only going to an LA or NY-based school. There are other excellent film schools out there, however. Just remember that you will likely be incurring a lot of debt for a degree that won't automatically qualify you for a job. However, the best filmmakers, including writers, often went to college (not always film school) and have a bachelors or masters degree.

**9. MISCELLANEOUS RESOURCES**

* [IMSDb](http://www.imsdb.com) - A website with numerous scripts of produced work.
* [The Black List](http://blcklst.com/) - Originally a list of the most talked about unproduced screenplays, the site also offers other services to writers. These scripts are good to read because it will show you what the powers-that-be are interested in.
* [Done Deal Pro](http://www.donedealpro.com) - Keeps updated information on what's being sold and such, information that can be hard to gather elsewhere (even from a site like [Deadline](http://www.deadline.com)). This is good info because it'll let you know what companies are buying. There is also a very useful forum on there.",,False,self,t5_2qupf,1365640748.0,,,True,t3_1c1l3s,http://www.reddit.com/r/Screenwriting/comments/1c1l3s/screenwriting_101/,

I say we just stop doing that.

Should you start your screenplay with ten pages of dialogue that isn't pushing the story forward?  Probably not. Are there valid reasons why you probably shouldn't?  Yes.  Are any of those reasons that you aren't Tarantino?  No.

The discussions in r/screenwriting should generally be about how to write a compelling story and/or about getting your script read/sold (and these two topics overlap a lot).  The same pieces of advice that we come across over and over are super useful and I expect everyone to be familiar with them if they are even semi-serious about being a screenwriter.  However, someone is gonna break them in a brilliant way because of their unique way of telling a story.  Some people are going to be the next brilliant whomevers.

So when someone asks, ""hey I've been working on this script and I introduce my protagonist on page 30, can I get away with that?"" answers should be, ""well a reason you would wanna introduce your protagonist right away is blah blah blah"" or ""as a script reader, if I don't know who your protagonist is by page five, blah blah blah"", but not ""you aren't the Coen brothers, bro, forget about it"".  We wanna start discussions, right?! 

All that being said, if you're a writer who is redefining the hero's journey or not having a protagonist or some other crazy shit that obviously goes against everything we know about screenwriting, what do you expect people to say??  Finish it and post the screenplay so we can start a real discussion about it, rather than speculating how only Hitchcock can kill off the hero halfway through the movie.  And if you pull something like that off, I'll be the first to applaud you.

1336860472.0,150,self.Screenwriting,tk653,I'm a professional reader and here are a few quick things you should eliminate from your writing.,181,31,62,http://www.reddit.com/r/Screenwriting/comments/tk653/im_a_professional_reader_and_here_are_a_few_quick/,"I’m a reader and this is a throwaway. I am not doing an AMA. You can take these or leave them or debate them.  But I'm right.  If I come across as rude, it's because it infuriates me. I love writing, I love screenwriting, and I love screenwriters.  You're breaking my heart, that's why I'm mad.

These are things I see often and usually by bad writers.  Not to say good writers won’t occasionally use some of these, but on average, the good writers don’t. You may already know these, I hope that you do.  Most of these have to do with being economical and delivering tighter descriptions.  I’m only doing this to maybe spare myself from coming across these so frequently.  You should know these things. They may seem insignificant, but when a reader only reads, these jump out and could elicit a premature judgment of your writing.  In no particular order:

1) On your face.  If someone smiles, smirks, or has a look, we know it’s on their face.  Where else would a smile be?  With a smile on his face.  Just “With a smile.” 

2) He nods his head.  Or He shakes his head ‘no’. Nods means ‘yes’, shakes means ‘no’.  If he nods, we know it’s with his head, if he shakes his head, we know it means no.

3) The best he can.  Or The best they can.  They clean the house the best they can. He talks her down the best he can. This means nothing, tells us nothing. And it’s usually unnecessary. 

4) Very pregnant.  You’re not clever, EVERYBODY writes very pregnant. Just write pregnant, we all know what pregnant looks like. The only time you would address the size, is if they’re in the early stages of pregnancy, we’ll assume they’re very pregnant otherwise.

5) They fight.  They kiss. They have sex. Too dry.  Lame, lame writing.  Describe the kiss, the fight, the sex, however brief, show what we’ll see onscreen.

6) He is walking, he is talking, they are walking, they are talking.  Just write He walks, He talks, They walk, They talk. Everyone should know this, yet I see it ALL the time.

7) Suddenly and all of a sudden.  Go ahead and eliminate suddenly from your vocabulary.  If you use ‘all of a sudden’ it might already be too late for you.

8) Starts doing his homework.  Begins searching for files. Just do the action. He does his homework. He searches for files. 

9) Be sparse with your adverbs and adjectives.  A large aircraft, or he quickly flees are redundancies. Large and quickly are two words that are overused, unnecessary, and lame.

10) Watch your spacing after periods. Hard to notice, but it’s all I see.  It’s lazy, you should be mindful.  It doesn’t matter if you use one space or two, but remain consistent.  

11) Don't write Well, before dialogue.  Well, I don't know.  I don't know.  Amateurs use this to make their dialogue sound real.  It doesn't.  

I hope this helps.

Edit: pizzazzeria pointed out an error.

Edit: Also, just want to make clear that these are my annoyances.  And again, I've seen these in good writing, but it's RARE.

Anyone else have writing aphorisms that work for them?

***

A hero’s success is earned. He should learn from his defeats.

Allow characters to have lives offscreen.

Arrive late, leave early.

As much as possible, reveal character and advance plot through actions.

Avoid people saying what they mean, or stating the obvious.

Be a sadist.

Chance should only work against the characters.

Connect all scenes with “Therefore” or “But.”

Cut the dialogue shorter.

Danger must be immediate, and endanger characters we care about.

Dialogue’s use is primarily to reveal character, not advance plot.

Discard your first five ideas.

Don’t talk down to the audience.

Every character should want something they can’t get.

Figure out the structure first, especially the ending.

Finish first, then rewrite.

Gain audience empathy early via the hero’s actions.

Get to the plot fast. Don’t fluff the intro with backstory.

Imagine your scene in a foreign language if you get stuck.

Imply a larger world.

Kill what you love.

Know where the story is going by page 17.

Lure characters forward while chasing them from behind. 

Make secondary characters stand out by giving them unique traits.

Monologues should be rare.

Avoid conventional figures of speech.

Raise the stakes. Stack the odds against your characters.

Simplify. Focus. Combine characters. Hop over detours.

Stakes should be primal and ring true.

Start as close to the end as possible.

Stuck? Write down what wouldn’t happen next.

The audience should know everything the hero knows.

The character’s choices should be logical but unexpected.

The hero doesn’t ask questions, he answers them.

The hero should be proactive, and have a clear goal, in words and actions.

The plot should change the hero.

The setting should be vital to the plot.

Use only one piece of magic per movie.

World-building should be quick and merciless.

Wring a variety of emotions from the characters.

1301413152.0,76,self.Screenwriting,gdzmj,A cheat-sheet to improving dialogue,98,22,19,http://www.reddit.com/r/Screenwriting/comments/gdzmj/a_cheatsheet_to_improving_dialogue/,"Hey all,

I put together a sort of cheat-sheet that has helped me improving when writing dialogue for my characters and thought I would share. Dialogue seems to be one my weak points. It seems that among writers, there are two camps: Those who write excellent description/action and those who write excellent dialogue. Putting these skills together is what separates the men from the boys, or the paid from the unpaid (IMO). 

Anything else to add?  

**Exercises:**

*At lunch, grab a sketch pad and eavesdrop*

* Note how people talk over each other constantly, and rarely ever finish a complete thought
* Don’t transcribe the conversation verbatim, but jot down interesting phrases, notes regarding the flow of dialogue, and how the flow shifts (or how the dialogue volleys / turns of phrases)

*Write a scene where a couple is buying a mattress*

* They are only allowed to speak about the mattress, but through the subtext, we learn of their marital problems 

""I've always wanted a firm mattress, what with my back problems and all. I need a nice hard lay, don't I John?""


**Dos:**

* Short, simple sentences -- one thought at a time
* Include tension and purpose to every word/sentence
* Generally, no more than three, uninterrupted sentences -- the odd, lengthy monologue is fine but should be 
absolutely warranted
* If you can, always break up dialogue with action 
* Channel your characters -- quiet the automated voice in your head
* Engage the audience -- viewers are engaged by what the writer doesn’t tell them, not by what the writer tells
* Join scenes late -- i.e., avoid pleasantries
* Leave scenes early -- i.e., cut the scene at the point of tension or drama
* Allow characters to exist offstage -- reference their background lives or acts, at least those aspects worthy of mention, in their dialogue/character interactions
* Let the scene loop over in your head 10-20 times, silent, before placing in the dialogue to establish what needs to happen and what messages you want to convey
* Alternatively, imagine watching your scene, but in a foreign or gibberish language -- What does the talking feel like? What’s the emotion behind the words? Who’s in control? Who’s guiding the discussion? Is it an equal exchange? 
* Have your characters actually listen, engage, interrupt and react to things said by each other, instead of each character just speaking because it’s their turn
* When you’re finally done and happy with your scene -- go back and cut the dialogue shorter
* Remember that film is a visual medium -- a motion picture
* Some screenwriters suggest writing to a rhythm; write to the pulse or the beat of your story

**Don'ts:**

* Avoid people saying directly what they mean
* Avoid big speeches
* Avoid “uh” and “um”
* Avoid spellings things out, instead allude 
* Avoid stating the obvious (particularly in respect to things the audience can see or hear)

**Purpose of Dialogue**

Dialogue in film has four major functions: reveal character, advance the plot, express subtext, and entertain. Aristotle gave us the idea that everything in a story is a microcosm of the entire story, and if it isn't, then it is unrelated (and shouldn't be in the story) -- the same can be said of dialogue. 

*Reveal Character*

* Every line should resonate with who says it
* The flavour of their background should be captured in their word choices
* The syntax (arrangement of words) should be uniquely theirs
* Focus on background, attitudes, personality quirks, unique world view, education, mannerisms -- and most importantly -- wants and needs
* Strong characters have needs which should come into conflict with the needs of other characters

*Advance the Plot*

* Well-written dialogue imperceptibly moves the story forward -- by having the characters say something that leads to something happening
* A decision is made
* A question is asked
* Information is revealed -- with subtlety 
* Momentum or tension is built
* Even silence at times can be moving
* A cause and effect relationship should be established between what is spoken and what happens next
* Try to instill conflict in your character interactions
* In real life, inner conflict often gets externalized, or “dumped” onto friends/family/complete strangers (remember to be subtle) 

*Express Subtext*

* Avoid people saying exactly what they mean
* Let visuals, sounds, tension and so on, drive the meaning behind words -- trust your audience and your actors

*Entertain the Audience*

* Dialogue needs to evoke a visceral response and engage the audience
* Whether it’s a funny line, poignant line, mysterious line, frightening line, emotion-filled line or so on, the audience should be moved emotionally 
* Engage the audience by...
* Joining scenes late
* Leaving scenes early 
* Allowing characters to exist offstage
* Revealing new information about your characters (reveal the different or unexpected facets of their personalities)
* Thinking about what the audience expects from this film -- Is it a horror? Drama? Comedy? 

A great quote (though from a religious preacher): 

&gt;[Great dialogue requires] thinking out what I have to say, then thinking out how the other man will understand what I say, and then rethinking what I have to say, so that, when I say it, he will think what I am thinking

Here's a quick-run down of the huge amount of unbelievable coincidences that drive the plot. 

- Flint Marko, who just HAPPENED to be the real killer of Uncle Ben, just HAPPENS to fall in a completely random science experiment and become Sandman. 

- Gwen Stacy, who just HAPPENS to be Peter Parker's lab partner, just HAPPENS to fall out of a skyscraper and be saved by Peter/Spider-Man. She also just HAPPENS to be there when Peter plans on proposing to to Mary Jane. 

- The alien symbiote (whose presence is never explained) just HAPPENS to land on Earth right next to Spider-Man, the only super-powered person on the planet (at this point in the film).

- Eddie Brock, Peter Parker's rival, just HAPPENS to also be dating Gwen Stacy. He also just HAPPENS to be in the same church where able Spider-Man expels the symbiote. 

- Venom and Sandman, two characters tied to Peter Parker in completely unrelated ways, just HAPPEN to run into each other on the street and then decide to team up to kill Spider-Man. 

The only antagonist in the film whose screentime isn't driven by unbelievable coincidences is Harry Osborn, and he's the most underutilized in the film. 

This is in stark contrast to Spider-Man 2, which has one of the best written screenplays (in my opinion) of any superhero film. What do you guys think?

Then it hit me... the scene just didn't belong in the story.  As much as I liked it by itself (two characters I love writing interacting for the first time), it didn't add anything, and worse, it slowed down the momentum.

So I highlighted it and I deleted it and it's gone.  I read through the script and it's not missed and the flow is noticeably better.

My reason for writing this post?  Am I hoping this helps someone else in the same predicament?  Maybe.  Am I looking for a pat on the back and some internet points?  Probably.  But mostly, I felt the nice little scene, that will never be read by anyone, (let alone brought to life by actors) deserved some sort of eulogy.

-Draw LINES connecting two characters who are connected (e.g., siblings, enemies, romantic rivals, lovers, boss/employee, etc.)

Anyone who isn't connected by at least TWO LINES either:

a. Has to go! 

b. Has to be connected in some way (e.g., the ANTAGONIST who's bothering the ROMANTIC HERO is ALSO after his girl (a romantic rival), etc.)

OR

c. Has to be COMBINED with another SOLO CHARACTER (to become ONE CHARACTER) so that s/he's now connected by two lines, possibly more.

*The third one is often the best solution (that extraneous 'cousin' character you threw in as a device to teach the hero how to swing a baseball bat, is actually the BULLY we met at the beginning, etc.)*

.
.
.

EDIT 1: Obviously I wasn't clear enough b/c some folks misunderstood.

a. *Not all characters need to be connected.*  The idea is that EVERY CHARACTER should be 'related' in some way to AT LEAST TWO OTHER CHARACTERS.  (They're not all related to each other).

b. *The significance of the relationship increases the opportunity for drama/conflict (it's a spectrum):*

Superman flies to save a random stranger from Lex Luthor and we're somewhat involved (especially if it's a baby); but HE cares WAY MORE when he's flying to save *Lois* from Lex Luthor ('the VICTIM', Lois is now connected to TWO PEOPLE) - and accordingly, we care even more as well.

**And as I mentioned, it's most useful for COMBINING CHARACTERS.  I assure you, it's worth considering where you can do that.**

.
.
.

EDIT 2:  I'm very amused by all the blowback this post is getting.  

--This is not an inviolable RULE of screenplay physics, folks, it's a TOOL--

It's a way to analyze your script and see where there are holes, where you can add complexity, and a way to identify and tie up loose ends (characters/scenes serving only one purpose, instead of more than that.)

My wife is a manager/producer and I have two agents at one of the top agencies, a great manager (not my wife) and an ent lawyer. 

-Yes, managers read queries. When they suck, my wife sends them to me for laughs.

-Yes, managers will request material. While managers always have too many clients, they never stop looking for new hot writers.

-Caveat: some managers focus on certain genres, especially comedy, TV, etc. Do your research, don't send horrors to a female romcom manager.

-Misspellings send a query to the burn folder. Seriously, you misspelled the name of your own title? Get a second pair of eyes on everything you send out. 

-Contests, while good for experience, don't matter to managers and agents. Really. Unless it's Nicholl, but then managers are contacting you. They do not care one bit about ""top 25%"" or whatever of random contests. Don't waste your money. It makes you sound amateur. 

-Don't mention how many scripts you've written. If you say, ""I've written 10 scripts"" the manager goes away thinking, ""This person has failed 10 times."" No joke, you're focusing on selling one script per query, that's it.

-Also, don't list multiple log lines. Again, no one cares about your less-than-average scripts. You're pitching your best script, that's it. Lord knows I have dumpsters of bad scripts I've written, but no one knows about those, everyone thinks my first script was brilliant. Get it?

-Don't be creepy. Ie: ""I googled the shit out of you and saw your picture on facebook -- I see you love pizza! I love pizza! My script is about pizza!"" Just no. 

-Don't be arrogant. ""I'm the next Aaron Sorkin."" No you're not. You log line is the only thing that matters.

-Be humble and nice. A manager will, even if they don't rep you, pass you along to someone else in the same company or elsewhere. But only if you're not a d-bag.

-Be brief. This means a hello, the log line, and a thank you. That's it, 3 paragraphs, no rambling.

-Write your query professionally. Spell check, have it nicely formatted, etc. 

-Use forums and friends and family to test your query and script. If your readers are giving you ""yeah, it's good"" not ""this is fantastic!"" then something is off. If non-professionals don't love your material, you can sure as hell bet that managers (who read scripts and queries all day long) won't either. 

-Finally, don't follow up. There's no point, they read your query and passed. For the next script you write and query, you don't want to be remembered as the wet blanket who couldn't take a hint.



Also:

-Screenwriting pitch fests are legit (as long as the execs you're pitching to are from real companies). I've been to many (not as a writer, just with my wife), and the managers/execs will, after the fest, swap stories about the best material they heard. Also the worst. If there's a great pitch, they'll request it. If it's a great script, they'll try to sell it.

-Don't be crazy. Seriously, ""crazy"" is the #1 reason good writers get dropped. Take your crazy to the forums or /r/screenwriting. Don't argue when getting notes. Just write everything down and say, ""Great note!"" I'm serious. Your mantra should be ""I'm the nicest, easiest guy to work with ever."" 

-Paid script reads are bullshit...unless it's by an industry exec. There's a few fests/workshops out there like this. These will be the best notes you'll get in your entire life. And if your script has promise, you could land a rep. These are worth the money, but only for people whose scripts are solid, who have a half dozen solid ideas for future scripts and who aren't batshit insane.

52 scripts, and a month of reading, and we finally have the winners!

Without further ado: --

* **1st prize** - *'Simuverse'* by /u/Sentry_the_Defiant

* **2nd prize** - *'Fair Play'* by /u/StillNotSam

* **3rd prize** - *'Harker and Grey'* by /u/indy42

I'll be writing up the free coverage for 2nd and 3rd prize very soon. And I'll put the winner in contact with Bob to claim his Pitchfest ticket!

The competition was really tight all the way through. I really wish I had more prizes to give away.

The rest of the short-listed finalists were (in no particular order):

* Pretty Faces
* Risk Management
* Sins of the Son
* Small Town
* Zoo

And some honourable mentions of scripts that would have made the final if we had more room/time/judges:

* Gerry Buck Says Buck You
* Britannia
* The Giant's Passage
* Super Groovy!
* Death in the Family

Don't get disheartened if your script isn't in here! As I say, competition was very high, and we were concentrating on getting a definite single winner rather than ranking all the scripts.

(If you'd like to read loglines for the winning scripts, it's up to the entrants to provide them. I'll edit this post if anybody puts them up.)

Mega-thanks to the other judges:

* /u/Filmmaker_mike
* /u/veroEgiusto
* /u/theoxford_comma

And also huge thanks to /u/MayorPoopenmeyer for dontating the prize!

We'll definitely be organising more things like this in the future! (Now that I know what I'm doing ... )

If any of you have suggestions for future events/contests/etc, I'll be making a big suggestions thread next week so I can see which ideas are most popular.

Thank you to all the entrants - and congratulations to the winners!

**EDIT: -** Added the reddit username for the script in 2nd place.

Logline for the winner:

&gt; **SIMUVERSE**

&gt; *Would she be with him if he was virtually the last man on Earth?*

&gt; *With the help of his sentient supercomputer, a depressed scientist creates a near-perfect simulation of reality to see if his love interest would have gone out with him if he were the last man on Earth. But the simulated versions of the scientist and his love interest gradually discover that their universe is a sham, which ruins the test and interferes with the controller's grand designs.*",,False,self,t5_2qupf,1368378192.0,,,True,t3_1e5bhi,http://www.reddit.com/r/Screenwriting/comments/1e5bhi/announcement_reddit_screenwriting_contest_the/,moderator

Yesterday a friend of mine and I received the first rough cut of our first short film from an editor. Basically, it was the most horrible thing we'd ever watched. 

At that moment we both felt like giving up the idea of becoming a director/screenwriter duo (even as individuals) However, I quickly realised that filmmaking/screenwriting is the only thing I'm genuinely passionate about. It's the one thing that motivates me to act without the need of an incentive like, food, babes or money. 

We're young-ish (26) And in the process of making this film, we've lost money, damaged property and lost more money. We'll probably be an embarrassment to our peers and a laughing stock to all the naysayers.    

However! We're not giving up. Why bother? All we can do is learn and move on, try again and again and again and again and again and again until, you get the picture...

So for anyone who has screwed up, feels talentless or has thought about quitting for whatever reason, here me when I say...

DON'T GIVE UP! Keep going in the direction of the life you want to live, because a few months from now you'll be much closer to that goal than you are today.

1351814594.0,42,self.Screenwriting,12hjl9,[UPDATE] Michael Mann meeting.,48,6,16,http://www.reddit.com/r/Screenwriting/comments/12hjl9/update_michael_mann_meeting/,"For those who haven't been following - [original post](http://www.reddit.com/r/Screenwriting/comments/vc5at/had_dinner_with_directorproducer_michael_mann/) and the [second one](http://www.reddit.com/r/Screenwriting/comments/10a3z2/im_that_guy_who_had_dinner_with_michael_mann_and/)

After weeks of rescheduling appointments, I finally got to sit down and have a wonderful conversation with Michael Mann. I thought you guys would like to know some of the things we talked about and some of the tips he gave me.

First things first, we discussed the three scripts he sent me (i.e. Ray Donovan by Ann Biderman, A Star Is Born (1976) by Frank R. Pierson, and Sullivan's Travels). I told him that I was very grateful for them, and that I enjoyed them a lot...except for A Star is Born. He laughed and said ""Yeah, Barbra Streisand really wanted to do that. She basically manipulated Kris Kristofferson into doing it. I hate it.""

He let me talk about my thoughts on them for a while. I told him that what I liked about Sullivan's Travels is that I could clearly see the characters and, while the dialogue was fantastic, there was a significant amount of action that really helped the scenes play out. Ray Donovan was rich in conflict and that's why it was strong as a pilot. While I didn't really like A Star is Born, I thought it played out nicely, plot-wise.

He agreed with a lot that I said. He said he gave me Sullivan's Travels because of my interest in comedy writing. A Star is Born was a prime example of story structure as it demonstrated a rigid skeleton that fits all the criterion for a great story. A screenplay is the blueprint, the genome, of a film. It's important for it to have a solid foundation.

Ray Donovan was probably the best  example for a TV pilot he's ever seen. The amount of conflict in the Ray Donovan pilot, although a little overwhelming, leaves a lot of room for possibilites in the rest of the series. It sets up the show spectacularly.

After talking about the scripts, he motioned to me and asked ""So, where are you with all this?"" I told him how I started out wanting to act for the camera, and then got into filmmaking, but recently decided I was better off a screenwriter. He said that was alright and said that it was important to consider all options.

""I'm a horrible actor. But I love and respect the art of acting. That's why I produce most of the time. If you're not that great at writing, or editing, or directing, producing is a great way to stay involved with your passions.""

He frequently changed majors as an undergraduate and only went to film school for his graduate year, in which he wanted to learn everything there was about cinema. During his time as an undergraduate, he recalled taking a philosophy class on logic, and how he uses the analytical techniques to develop his stories, ideas, and films. So, always keep to your other interests, because they will always find a way into your writing. You do better at the things you love, no?

On that note, I asked him how he got into the business and if there was anything he could tell me as an aspiring screenwriter. He told me that student films were a great start, and recommended that I check out film festivals like the ones the Academy runs for students (of which he is a board member). 

But most importantly, I had to love what I was doing. To forget about the career and just write. Honestly, if you write and write and write, you'll get good and then the career will naturally come. Plus, you can't show anything if you haven't got anything. Most producers don't want you to write something they're looking for, they'd rather produce something you've already written.

On behalf of [WriteOnSC](http://www.reddit.com/user/WriteOnSC), I asked him what his revision process was. ""Well, first of all, when I start writing out the story, I start from the end. I break it down (he draws four squares on a Post-It) and first I think, 'Okay, how's this thing gonna end?' and then I work backwards; how does act III end, how does act II end, etc.""

""After you've made sure that's solid, you can start looking at the little things. When I was writing Heat, I really liked 9 parts out of 10, but there was something missing. I had it like that for six to eight years. I showed it to Marty (Martin Scorsese) and asked him if he wanted to direct it. So then we talked about it and it was then that I found that missing piece. So, you've got to be patient with your work. And critical. You are the best judge of your work.""

The conversation lasted about an hour. Afterwards, as a bonus, he said I could send him any of my work and he'll get some of his professional readers to tear it apart. I was ecstatic about that, but first I'd have to get off my lazy ass and actually finish a goddamn script! I'm really glad I got the chance to sit down with him. He's a wonderful person. The experience has really motivated me to do a lot more writing, and I hope by sharing it, you guys may also feel the same inspiration as I have felt.",,False,self,t5_2qupf,1351832076.0,,,True,t3_12hjl9,http://www.reddit.com/r/Screenwriting/comments/12hjl9/update_michael_mann_meeting/,

As a fan of the /r/NoSleep subreddit, I've taken on the side project to create a webseries of films based on the excellent storytelling that goes on in NoSleep.  

For this, I will need writers to help with the adaptation into short screenplays.  I want the writers in /r/writing and /r/screenwriting to participate.  

Don't start adapting just yet.  This is to be done in the most professional way, while trying to involve the most Redditors possible.  

The plan is for Season One to be 6 adapted episodes plus extras (behind-the-scene footage, interviews with cast and crew, learning about the origin stories, etc.).  The 6 episodes will vary on running time based on the story to tell.  

Consider these jobs as OWA (Open Writing Assignments) that need to be filled.  I'm in talks with the NoSleep writers and while I'm finalizing the 6 stories to adapt, I'll need to hear from you and why you would be a good candidate, so pitch yourself by either PMing me here or sending an email to no.sleep.series@gmail.com  Please don't send writing samples until I ask for them.  Emails with attachments will be deleted and unread.

What I have to offer you.  At the moment, the entire series is being funded out of my pocket.  I'm looking for writers that would be happy to receive credit, IMDb credit, and the chance to work on a cool project.  That's not all, my production company is a signatory with the WGA.  This project is being produced under that, which means screenwriters brought on will receive units toward their WGA membership.  You can read more about units [here](http://www.wga.org/content/default.aspx?id=84).

This will be a process and in the meantime you can check out these links:

We finished our first feature on a modest budget last year, and it was a financial success! We are now in various stages of development on multiple projects. One is about to enter pre-production.

**Currently, we are soliciting screenplays for two thrillers which we hope to develop later this year. We got the word out to agents and scripts have been coming in. The director and a few other principle players and myself have been sifting through the scripts looking for projects we like. So far, we haven’t fallen in love with anything and are hoping to make decisions on the projects by April 30th.**

I mentioned this subreddit to the director, and he thought it couldn’t hurt. So I contacted the mods and they authorized a solicitation post.

If you’ve got a strong thriller screenplay you’re looking to sell, we’re looking for the small town, character driven type. Not so much the spy type. PM me and I’ll give you contact information and instructions on how to submit your script.

Best of Luck!



**Edit to add** that I posted this solicitation last week, but the mods suggested I repost since the first post was caught in the spam filter for a bit.

Win a ticket to PitchFest.,46,10,63,http://www.reddit.com/r/Screenwriting/comments/m3af0/screenwriting_contest_win_a_ticket_to_pitchfest/,"Alright guys sorry this took awhile to start up but now we're ready to begin. So like the title says this is a screenwriting contest. [PitchFest](http://pitchfest.com/index.shtml) is next year June 1-3 at the Marriott in Burbank, California. This ticket is courtesy of user [MayorPoopenmeyer](http://www.reddit.com/r/Screenwriting/comments/leofq/would_anyone_be_interested_in_a_screenwriting/c2s7rnz).

So let's get right down to it.   

*  Your script needs to be feature-length. We're talking 90-120 pages. You can go a bit over or a bit under.
  
*   It is open topic, any genre. We want your best work. The winner will be pitching this to companies. Only one submission per person!
  
* You can use an older script as long as it hasn't garnered any awards or been sold or optioned. We'd prefer if you wrote a new script during the deadline on your favorite subject but you can also touch up an old one and use again. We won't discriminate.

  
*   You have 12 weeks to write. So that means your completed script must be turned in on** Monday, January 30, 2012**. You have until 11:59pm.
  
*  **READ PLEASE: **Your completed script must be turned in as a PDF. It **MUST** have a title page with only your title. I repeat only your title. No identifying information. We don't want any bias with the judges. Your contact information will have to be provided separate. 
  
*  You must email the pdf as an attachment to reddit.screenwriting@gmail.com and have your contact information(name, reply email address) in the body. The subject line must be ""Reddit Contest-Title."" Make sure you get this right! It's grounds for **disqualification** if you put your information on the title page. If I do receive some with the info on the title page I'll email you to send a revised copy but I won't do this on the last day of the contest.
  
Your script will be read by a panel of judges. They will focus on topics such as characters, dialogue, story, and marketability. The judges will not be providing feedback and notes. If they do it is entirely at their discretion. We're screening the judges beforehand but there are other ways to protect your script. There is more information at the [PitchFest](http://pitchfest.com/gapf/gapf_faq.shtml#L) website.
  
There's freeware like [Celtx](http://celtx.com/) that you can use to write your script. The basic version is free.
  
We are still looking for a few more judges so please send a short bio if you're interested. If you need to reach us for anything you can either PM us or email me at mr.leeruiz@gmail.com or MayorPoopie at bob@pitchfest.com  


We might have an update in 6 weeks, maybe an AMA with Bob to settle any questions you have. UPDATE: I just got word from Bob we want to be doing check-ins about every 2 weeks and an AMA soon enough. The AMA will also be good for getting info on how to go about pitching, where to get more information, the logistics of getting to Burbank safely.

  

So comment with any questions you might have and good luck. Also let me know if you would like reminders, like in 6weeks or of the updated delivery method, and tell me how to contact you be it through reddit or email.  

  
Sweet we made the header! I ALREADY have a couple of scripts in. Awesome guys, keep it up!

Win a ticket to PitchFest 2013.,54,14,57,http://www.reddit.com/r/Screenwriting/comments/1a32wd/announcement_rscreenwriting_screenplay/,"Okay -- this is starting a little later than last year, but otherwise, it will be much the same.

A screenwriting contest! The winner of which will receive a free pass to the Great American PitchFest - worth $275!

[PitchFest](http://pitchfest.com/index.shtml) takes place May 31st - June 2nd at the Marriott in Burbank, California. This prize - like last time - is courtesy of user [MayorPoopenmeyer](http://reddit.com/u/MayorPoopenmeyer).

So let's get to the details: --

*  Only one submission per person. Original work only. Scripts by two or more people are fine - but only one entry per team please.

*  Feature-length screenplays only. Approximately 90-120 pages. (You can go a little under/over, but be reasonable.)
  
*   Any genre - any topic. We want your best work. The winner will be pitching this to companies.
  
* You can enter any script as long as it hasn't garnered any awards or been sold or optioned.

* Obviously, you must have the rights to the script you are submitting.
  
*  Your completed script must be sent in by **THURSDAY 11TH APRIL 2013**. You have until 11:59pm Thursday evening. (I'll be collating everything on the morning of Friday 12th April to allow for time-zone differences).

Submission rules: --
  
* Your completed script **must be turned in as a PDF.** (It should go without saying that your screenplay must be properly formatted.)

* It **MUST** have a title page with **YOUR SCRIPT TITLE ONLY**. -- NO IDENTIFYING DETAILS WHATSOEVER. Your contact information will be provided separately (see below).
  
*  You must email the PDF as an attachment to redditscreenwriting2013@gmail.com before the closing date.

* Include your contact information (name, reply email address) in the **body of the email**. This way, we can judge the PDF scripts anonymously and fairly.

* The email subject line must be: *""Reddit Contest - [script title]""*. -- Make sure you get this right! 

* It's grounds for **disqualification** if you put your information on the title page or in headers/footnotes/whatever. *(If I do receive some with personal info on, I'll email you to send a revised copy - but I won't do this on the last day of the contest, and I certainly won't have time to edit any information out myself.)*

Judging --
  
* Your script will be read by a panel of judges. They will focus mainly on the areas of: concept, character, dialogue, story, structure, writing, tone and marketability. **The judges will not be providing feedback or notes.** (If they do it is entirely at their discretion.)

* The precise format of the judging will depend on how many entries we receive, and how many judges there are. (If you would like to be a judge, and feel qualified to do so, see below.)

* I'll be screening the judges beforehand, but there are other ways to protect your script if you're worried (though you really shouldn't be). There is more information at the [PitchFest](https://pitchfest.com/faq/) website FAQ.
  
We are still looking for a few more judges - so please send a short bio to me via email or PM if you're interested. You need to have at least some experience - and the turnaround will have to be pretty fast due to the late start. So make sure you'll actually have the time to read and judge a bunch of scripts soon after the April 11th deadline.

I'm hoping that the results will be out pretty fast after the deadline, to allow for as much time as possible for the winner to plan their trip, considering the slightly late start to the contest.

If you need to reach us for anything you can either PM me here, email me at pk1yen@msn.com. Or email MayorPoopenmeyer at bob@pitchfest.com. 

**I have already verified that Bob is genuine in his offer** - but feel free to contact him at the pitchfest email if you need extra reassurance.

We might have an update in 2 weeks -- and maybe an AMA with Bob to settle any questions (how to go about pitching, where to get more information, the logistics of getting to Burbank safely, etc).

Feel free to comment here with any questions you might have. 

You have one month!

Good luck!

*(Please upvote this self-post for visibility).*

**EDIT 1: --** Bob has made a good point about registering with the Copyright Office (and WGA, though I personally think copyright is enough), if you're at all concerned about handing your script about. (I would ask that you don't include any WGA or copyright information on your title page, though - we've had threads here before about readers being biased against scripts with WGA numbers on the front!)

Also -- if the winner is a script by two people, Bob has also very kindly offered the opportunity to upgrade the free pass to a Buddy Pass (worth $400) for $125!

Before Final Draft, before Celtix, before, writing everything out on notecards. open up Word/open Office/Whatever and write a scene-by-Scene outline. 

1. Int. Bedroom - Night
Yadda, Yadda, Yadda.

2. Int. Kitchen - Continuous
Whatever, blah, blah, blah. 

It's so much easier to make big changes to your script if you don't have 20-30 other pages of dialogue that need to change also. Just give each scene a paragraph or so, less if it's just description. Just so long as you know what you meant and it'll jog your memory when you come back to it.

I know that when you get that amazing idea, you just want to sit down a bang the whole 90 pages out immediately but that's not going to happen. You're going to get to the second act and the script is going to come to a screeching halt. 

I know that it's not the most romantic idea, but in practical writing, having an outline that you can reference is a Godsend when you're stuck and your characters have been going in circles for 15 pages halfway though your feature. 

A 9-10 page outline is great, but if you have more details already, throw em in. I just wrote an outline for my feature that was about 20 pages and every scene is meticulously planned out. Some have dialogue, some are just rough sketches. The important part is that when I get to the point where I'm actually in Final Draft, I'll have a starting point for every scene. 

I've had too many scripts crash at the 60 page mark because all the great ideas I had when I sat down have created the perfect shitstorm and there are two options; get frustrated and make up and ending for it all, or get frustrated and end up deleting a bunch of stuff. 

I know that not everyone may have this problem and if you've been around the block a few times you can get away with not Outlining so much, but if you're writing your first, second, or whatever number script and you've been having trouble in the past, Outlining is one of the best friends you could possibly ask for.

So I just watched ‘White House Down’ and thought it would be a fun screenplay to write about.

For a great lesson in the power of character motivation recommend watching Olympus Has Fallen and White House Down in relative proximity to each other. One has fully realized characters, motivations, and all that earns, heroism, humor, heart. While the other features a blank killing machine who drives us through a body count north of a horror film. The plots are identical. The experience of viewing, night and day. It’s pretty remarkable.

That said, I would like to now explore one particular aspect of the White House Down script  (without dragging Olympus Has Fallen through the mud, cause there’s no need for that) that made it work so well.   

Will also do my best to avoid any verbiage that implies I’m something I’m not. I am not a screenplay expert. I am not a teacher. I'm not a 'pro reader'. I’m an amateur enthusiast and completely fine with it that way. So please take all this with a grain of salt. I’m just doing my own thing and nobody’s going to get hurt if I express an opinion here and there. When it comes to writing, and thoughts on writing, consider me an enthusiast. An amateur. After all, the only difference between a person who likes to have sex constantly and one who does it for money, is one went pro. Keep that image in mind the next time some eager self promoter corners you in the bathroom at a film festival. 

Now,  if you’re on this sub, you’re likely into screenwriting and you’ve probably read countless books and articles that scrutinize, contextualize, and codify structure to the point of who gives a fuck. It’s often like the blind leading the blind. Which means when you actually come upon something that works and works well, when you find that rug that really ties the room together, it’s natural to get enthused. And like that rug that ties the room together, all the little bits come to form a complete picture. Click enough Lego blocks, next thing you know you’re in Legoland. In this case the rug, the Lego, the thing that works, is **character motivation**. 

Recently, I was clicking around online, reading some blogs, as I’m wont to do, and I came across this article: http://scriptshadow.net/screenwriting-article-11-character-flaws-to-use-in-your-script-right-now/

It details a bunch of famous films (Raiders included…but more on that) and essentially boils the gist of those stories down to key character flaws, inner weaknesses if you will, that drive the story and provide a satisfying arc that sends the audience home happy. The premise here is that there’s something they can’t do at the beginning, that they can do at the end, because they’ve overcome some internal block, and that’s the real story. That aspect is spot on. In fact if you subscribe to the mono-myth, or if you subscribe to the idea that life is about one thing, change, you get the idea. Change can be negative or positive, doesn’t matter. Same way the leaves fall off the tree each Autumn and come back renewed each Spring, change is the name of the game. 

So what does this have to do with character motivation and inner weakness? Everything.

Also, it’s the thing that ScriptShadow blog and a thousand others gloss right over. To restate the classic question regarding character development: What can the person do at the end that they couldn’t do at the beginning? 

However, this is not the most important question when it comes to character development, IMHO. The real question is…

Why?

**Why** can’t they do the thing they need to do at the start? 

Indiana Jones modulates from an archeologist who has no time for the supernatural, to a guy who believes in the supernatural, in God essentially. That’s not really an arc. That’s how many of us are. If you told someone there was a magic box with the power of God, they would be skeptical. To then show that person the face melting climax of Raiders IN REAL LIFE. They would believe. Again, not an arc. That's a logical REACTION. The question with Indiana Jones is, why does he care? Why is he so adamant to get it in a museum? Why is he so driven? The film never explains it. So I will.  

The answer for Indiana Jones is the same answer for EVERY character. 

Why is Indiana Jones so driven, so motivated? 

Because deep down, Indiana Jones, thinks he’s a piece of shit.
 
Let that sink in for a minute. 

Nothing had much more impact on Indy’s life than a deep, tragic wound, sliced into his heart, in this case, by the cold steel of a loved authority figure. Namely Henry Jones. His father. ""That's his name, Henry Jones, Junior."", ""I like Indiana."", ""We named the DOG Indiana."" 

And if almost no moment previous had greater impact than suffering that tragic wound, then it’s certainly safe to say no moment had a more meaningful euphoria then when Indy and Henry buried the hatchet, beat the Nazi’s, and restored the Grail. Raiders left us in cheers, Last Crusade left us in tears…of joy. Which emotion is more powerful?

That’s the power of character motivation and character motivation comes from one place and one place only, an Inner Wound or Weakness.  

It’s the characters inner, hidden, drive that propels them. And it’s almost always because they perceive themselves to be unlovable or lacking self worth.

In Die Hard John McClane has a whole heap of external problems; terrorists, hostages, no shoes, bullets flying, broken glass, Hans Gruber, only one bullet left, few allies, and the Twinkies are expired.

But what does that mean? If it’s a shitty story it means he has to deal with those things all at once or one at a time, and although that sounds exciting, imagine there were nothing more to it. Some coke head screenwriter walks us through a series of obstacles and explosions, credits, collect check. Boring.

But there IS one more problem and its the most critical. No, it’s not that his wife is a hostage, it’s not that he's after a reconciliation, and it’s not that the news is endangering his family by plastering their faces on TV. 

These are also external problems.

His big problem, his inner weakness, his drive, is that he's a piece of shit divorcee whom nobody loves. Nobody can love. This inner weakness has only to do with him. It makes him angry at his wife for not loving him. It makes him ready to fight because he has a chip on his shoulder, it provides him with something to prove.

His inner weakness is what holds him back AND drives him. It’s what stands between him and Apotheosis. Right up to the end of his looser life; torn, bloody, injured, picking glass out of his feet, and dying the way losers die, alone in a bathroom. Until his one friend, a guy he's never met, encourages him to hold on a while longer and in doing so coaxes the Hero out when John admits he's a fuck up and confesses, ""I must have told her a thousand times I loved her. But I never said I was sorry.""

From that point on John has figured out what’s been holding him back. HE has, his ego. His wound, even if not healed, has been addressed. He’s seen the light and has a renewed strength. We know what must come next as well as he. Save the fucking day. It's a lot like redemption. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QrY9eHkXTa4

Looking at it that way, the idea of a 'laundry' list of character flaws seems arbitrary, if anything, distracting. 

Writers are nothing if not students of human nature. Which means it’s important to get down to the deep, deep, deep levels of character. The level so deep your submarine will explode like Michael Bien’s at the end of The Abyss.  

It's about love and self worth, specifically the lack thereof, and how it can be restored. 

The question of, what can they do at the end that they couldn't do at the beginning, is important, but it’s not what motivates them.  

Unfortunately it is often a thought exercise that takes a detour around the real question of, 'Why couldn't they do that in the first place?' One question is more critical than the other. 

The conclusion seems to be that somewhere, deep down, the characters believe themselves to be less than worthy, unlovable, and as a result, ineffective. Until they heal that wound they'll only be as powerful as their fear allows. That's for every character.

Need a villain? No problem. The villain is the character that let's themselves be owned by that wound. They don’t make it to the redemption stage. The gravity of that pain keeps them down on their own personal Hero’s Journey…only to do their best to satiate whatever pain rules them. Back to Die Hard, John was such a villain from Holly Gennaro’s POV that she ~~divorced~~ separated from him, moved across the country, and changed her name. 

Again, it’s often written that the villain is the shadow of the hero, and it serves a thematic, blah, blah, blah. Nope.

The villain is very similar to the hero because the hero is very similar to us and we all know what it’s like to be wounded. That’s why it’s difficult NOT to empathize, at least a little, with a character on the screen. Because we know what it’s like. 

We’ve all been there. The trick, is to make SURE you go there. After all, Indiana Jones, Die Hard, Batman, Daredevil, Channing Tatum…all may be without fear. But they’re never without pain. 

Which brings us back to White House Down. I dare not spoil it suffice to say it has perhaps the most outlandish plot since…wait for it…Independence Day. But what it does have is the drive of highly motivated, realistically drawn, human characters. It’s upon that bedrock that Roland Emmerich makes the punches fly, the bullets pop, and the rockets launch. Subtract that drive and it’s beyond unwatchable because it rings false. Who would put themselves in such dangerous straits unless they were highly motivated. And not gun to the head motivated. That’s not motivation, that’s coercion. There’s a big, big difference. 

Fortunately the difference is awesome.",,False,self,t5_2qupf,1375411614.0,,,True,t3_1ji7pk,http://www.reddit.com/r/Screenwriting/comments/1ji7pk/getting_to_the_heart_and_soul_of_inner_weakness/,

I had an idea this morning, thought I might bring it up here to see if it gains any traction.

Most of us listen to music while we write, and we spend a painstakingly long amount of time building a playlist to match our mood.

Why not use the hive mind of r/Screenwriting and create a collaborate playlist?

1324041630.0,35,self.Screenwriting,nf4ta,Yesterday I visited the set of my first feature film,44,9,24,http://www.reddit.com/r/Screenwriting/comments/nf4ta/yesterday_i_visited_the_set_of_my_first_feature/,"I've been following this subreddit for some time now, and I've learned a great deal from you people. I just wanted to share some ruminations of my experience from yesterday and encourage other produced screenwriters to share their feelings of being in the set for the first time. I feel that it's a highly conflicting experience.

As backstory, I've been developing this film with the director for a little more than a year now. It started as his original story but in the process it turned into something completely different than either of us had planned or could have written alone. A month ago we got greenlighted, and now our ~1 million euro budget film is in production. It's a Norwegian-Finnish coproduction and after a couple of weeks of shooting in Oslo they are now in Helsinki, which is my old home town (although nowadays I live in Berlin). Day before yesterday I arrived in Helsinki, and yesterday afternoon I went to the set.

Like everyone who has seen Adaptation knows, screenwriter has nothing to do in a film set. He rarely knows more than a quarter of the people running around busily, the director who used to be his best friend now merely says hello as he rushes to sooth the distressed actor and solve some camera-related technical questions, the boom operator is talking to his microphone, lights are being mounted and tuned, walkietalkies are buzzing. I guess it's like visiting your own child in a prison, orphanage or a cult meeting. You thought you knew her so well, you thought you had a good relationship, you thought you would be able to act cool. But when you get there...

Truth to be told, I was nervous as hell, my heart was beating like one of a humming bird and in a panicky blink of an eye I was really contamplating that I'd better turn around and go home and cry. As I approached the location I saw the star of the film outside the old theatre (they were shooting a dance performance scene). I said hello and felt like I was a wino asking for a euro. She was with some anonymous ""production people"" and together they were too busy looking for the entrance to the theatre. I trailed them some good 20 meters behind, trying to think of what I'll say when someone asks what the hell I'm doing there and tells me to leave. 

When I saw the lighting truck outside the theatre's loading platform, I felt a bit relieved. I have done some electrician's work in film and tv sets so somehow I made a wholly unlogical connection in my brain, I guess, that maybe I could be mistaken as a gaffer or sorts and thus granted entrance. I think I wasn't visibly shaking but for a perceptive viewer my condition would have been revealed by my rapidly blinking eyes as I dug into the backstage-turned-into-my-personal-dark-cave.

In the pitch black darkness I heard distant chatter. The star actress reappeared and disappeared like a ghost. I hid behind a corner as some anonymous staff walked by. I knew they were shooting on the stage so I tried to find my way in the darkness. I was looking for someone I knew, someone I could talk to, someone who could justify my presence. I peaked behind the black back curtains and saw the stage and the grandiose old theatre room with red velvet seats. And shitloads of big colored balloons, most more than a meter in diameter. I knew nothing of any balloons. Behind the balloons there were people. I tried to see if there would have been someone I knew. Strangers, talking in Finnish, English and Norwegian. The director wasn't there yet, I guess. I gathered my courage and stepped into the light, ready for their piercing eyes to would stab me dead with suspicion. 

No one turned. No one saw me. They were all very busy. I sighed a conflicted breath and tried to look cool, tried to look like I *knew* what i was doing. I heard some more chatter and decided to have a look in the foyer.

I entered the foyer and suddenly all my fear was gone. I saw the choreographer that I know from a long time ago. I saw the dancers, most of them my friends. They were trying on their clothes. They were all very kind to me. As I talked with the choreographer I started shaking, some kind of miniature PTSD. I tried to explain my inner crisis. I think she understood, at least she was smiling. I drank a litre of water.

In a few moments, the whole place had mutated, from a dark cave into a treasure chamber. I was still shaking as I walked back to the stage and saw the director. I said hello and he gave me a hug. I met the cinematographer and the art director, and then I realized that the sound recordist was actually an old friend of mine. 

Backstage with the dancers I drank some tea and slowly regained my self-esteem. Soon they started to shoot and I found a place to watch without being on the way. As the cameras were rolling I began to smile as I remembered what it really was that was going on, right there in front of me. I had written a screenplay and now it was being made into a film. *Wow.*

Today I'm going back to the set. Now they're shooting outside. It's one of my facorite scenes in the whole film. I'm still excited but definitely not so morbidly nervous as yesterday. I guess it's only once that you reach the dark and unknown cave, after that you know the steps or, at least, remember to bring a torch with you.

But I thought I'd give you all a quick update, because I've gotten a few messages about it recently.

- In the end, we got **52** (fifty-two!) entries. Which is more than I was expecting -- and more than double last year's total.

- We split the 52 entries into 4 groups of 13 - and then picked the best 2 scripts from each of these groups. These 8 scripts form the short-list for winners. (We also have some 'honorary mentions' of scripts we really liked, but which didn't *quite* make it through, which might be given some quick notes).

- We are giving each of these final 8 scripts a series of numerical scores in various categories - in the hopes that it'll help the writers know their strengths and weaknesses. These scores will be used to find the winners.

- We are currently waiting for one busy judge to make their final pick for the short-list -- and in the meantime, we have started scoring and commenting on the final scripts. 

- We're almost there! I estimate that the results will be available in the next week. (But as always, it depends on how much time the volunteer judges can dedicate to scoring the scripts properly. Each script can take 3+ hours to read and score accurately, and we're trying to give  a lot more constructive feedback than last year.)

I am aware that Pitchfest is approaching -- and I'm really sorry we just missed the deadline for Nicholl (it would have been nice to give the feedback in time, before people submit their scripts).

But these are lessons we've learned for next time!

So - keep your eyes peeled for the results. 

And I'll have a few other exciting things to announce soon as well.

Or, for the logline; Sara has just moved into a block of flats to start a new life away from her abusive mother, but when a vengeful ghost controlling a horde of zombies takes an interest in her, she's suddenly thrown into a fight for survival.

I'm looking for a new script to get into production in late winter. Ideally in the slasher / supernatural slasher genre, although I'll look at anything horror. We'll be looking at a production budget of £200k, so that means relatively small number of locations, in-camera effects and a smallish cast.

I'd be excited to see something beyond genre tropes; something which lifts it above other films in the genre and makes it stand out as unique and gives it a central theme or message beyond watching teenagers die!

I'm not into sexual violence - that's a big no for me, and I do like a dose of black or bleak humour to offset the horror.

It's simplest for me to receive loglines and treatments alongside scripts so that I can see quickly what it is you're aiming for.

I've been a redditor for three years now and more often than not when I see people posting on this sub for scripts, they get shot down in a flurry of negative posts - it's actually a very unfriendly sub for people trying to find scripts and quite daunting to post here, which I find bizarre as it's a forum for writers who want their films made! 

So, before anything goes wrong; no, I don't think I'm the right person to submit to if you're already making a living from your writing as it's unlikely we'll be able to offer you the figures you're interested in. However, if you're starting out and looking to get established, I think we can help each other out - and if the film does stupidly well, we'll all do well off it! 

I know writers have to fight to get the money and recognition they deserve, but I want to be clear that I'm not the big bad producer about to steal your ideas, I'm just someone starting out and trying to carve a name for myself and the people I work with.

You can reach me here, or email me on info@toothpix.co.uk

Can't wait to see what you've got in store for me!!!

1373527374.0,34,self.Screenwriting,1i2fmw,Just re-watched Mr. and Mrs. Smith... a couple thoughts,45,11,21,http://www.reddit.com/r/Screenwriting/comments/1i2fmw/just_rewatched_mr_and_mrs_smith_a_couple_thoughts/,"I just watched Mr. and Mrs. Smith (2005, Brad Pitt &amp; Angelina Jolie, written by Simon Kinberg, directed by Doug Liman) on HBO Go after not having seen it for several years.  I enjoyed it the first time I saw it, and it holds up quite well--their on screen chemistry is amazing, most of the jokes work, and the action is fun--but the third act drags, and I just realized why.  Quick recap: 

Act I: Pitt and Jolie meet and fall in love.  Then ""5 or 6 years later..."" they're married and bored.  We're thrown some red herrings to think they're cheating on each other, but then we discover that unbeknownst to each other, they're both expert assassins.  

Act II: When they realize they're working on opposite sides of a mission, they then half-try to kill each other several times until a knock-down, drag-out fight in their home that destroys the house and allows them to rediscover their love.  

Act III: They then have to fight together to survive the bad guys from both their former employers trying to kill them.

Here's the thing: Compared to the rest of the movie, most of Act III is really boring.  The climax is a fun shootout in a department store, and they both look cool in their matching grey suits and yellow-tinted sunglasses, but it still drags.  And I only just now realized why.  

The two best scenes are them falling back in love while fighting each other, and then in basically the next scene,  revealing all their secrets to each other while they're on the run together (""Who was that kind fellow who gave you away at our wedding?""  ""A hired actor.""  ""I said! I said I saw your dad on Fantasy Island!"").  And once that happens, it's all downhill.  There's nowhere left for the story to go because all the internal conflict has been resolved.  They're in love, and they're finally honest with each.  The end.

The only thing left is the external conflict--that there's a bounty on their heads--so they have to fight together to survive.  But it lacks all the sizzle of the previous 90 minutes because the real story conflict--will this married couple's love survive?--has already been answered.

It ends on a high note, though, with them returning to the marriage counselor.  ""Ask us the sex question...*Ten*.""

I'm just curious of how everybody handles getting enough writing done every day.

Personally I work 9 to 5, and have a 2 hour commute each way. I can’t write first thing in the morning (I can't do anything in the morning except sob and try to drag myself out of bed), but I do write on the commute using Final Draft on the iPad. I have to hop between a bus, where I do outline work as there are too many distractions to try and write scenes, and a train, where I write actual scripts. When I get home I wolf a quick dinner and write till half an hour before bed. All in all that’s between 5 and 6 writing hours per day. I think I'd get more done if I could work continuously rather than in bursts throughout the day, but it works pretty well.

So what do you guys do?

1339544819.0,31,self.Screenwriting,uyuv4,There has been a great deal of wailing and gnashing of teeth concerning the narrative problems in 'Prometheus.' How would YOU have written the screenplay?,40,9,23,http://www.reddit.com/r/Screenwriting/comments/uyuv4/there_has_been_a_great_deal_of_wailing_and/,"These are just some ideas that came to mind while watching:

1.) Jettison half the characters, including Vickers, Mohawk Guy, the Biologist. You could even eliminate Dr. Shaw's boyfriend/husband. They add nothing. Focus the story entirely around Dr. Shaw and her DRIVE to determine the origin of life on earth. 

2.) Eliminate the absurd sub-plot about Benjamin Button--oh, wait, excuse me--Peter Weyland--secretly aboard the ship. I still don't know what this added to the story other than an M. Night-level ""twist,"" which isn't much. 

3.) Make David the ""villain."" While Dr. Shaw recklessly pursues her goal, he cautiously thwarts her at every turn to protect the ship. In this way he becomes the anti-Ash from the first Alien film. Rather than a secret corporate tool, David is the rational one, ironically protecting humanity from its own impulses. 

4.) Secret of the ooze. The black ooze is to 'Prometheus' what ""dino DNA"" is to 'Jurassic Park.' Actually, you could take a lot of notes from JP as both are about the origins of life, genetics, and involve a Frankenstein-style plot. The whole scientific effort on LV-223 should have centered around figuring out about this mysterious black ooze. What does it do? How is it made? And what happens if you ingest it? Instead, it's never really explained, and seems capable of doing everything from making giant squid monsters, penis monsters, to turning astronauts into zombies. As an aside, this is the second epic space movie RUINED by zombies, 'Sunshine' being the first. This shit needs to stop.      

5.) Make the squid monster cesarean the mid-point ""pinch"" instead of some hackneyed random event. This was a really cool scene, (its similarity to the birth scene in the original 'MIB' notwithstanding) and it should have incorporated the other characters.             

6.) Clearly define Dr. Shaw's character. This is a woman ON A MISSION to find out how life started, but struggles to emotionally connect with people. Even worse, she's barren, so she'll never know what it's like to create life. This propels her to ingest the black ooze, something that she thinks will spawn life, resulting in the pregnancy. Only, instead of life, she creates death (the squid monster). Oh shit! Now it must be stopped at all costs.  

7.) Expand on the beginning with the Engineers. This should have been a mind blowing five minute or so intro setting up the black ooze, the space jockeys, and a primer for how life forms on other planets. Instead, it spends more time giving us amazing desktop wallpaper and then a lost albino 'Conan' extra with digestive problems than a coherent set-up for the story. 

EDIT: Just had another thought. Imagine Angelina Jolie instead of Noomi Rapace as Dr. Shaw. Now Jolie I can imagine traipsing across the cosmos trying to determine the origin of life. For some reason, I feel Jolie fits perfectly in with the Alien universe.

1350609175.0,31,self.Screenwriting,11q18q,Just some good advice I'd like to share.,39,8,5,http://www.reddit.com/r/Screenwriting/comments/11q18q/just_some_good_advice_id_like_to_share/,"On Characters: These characters are yours and yours alone, this is the beauty of writing. Make them real. Or make them unreal, but make them special. Let them reflect the things in life which intrigue/disturb/make you laugh. Let them be flawed, don’t worry about a hero being heroic or a villain being villainous, try to give each character a mix of both. Let them be all your own. Think like your character and let them make decisions and define themselves as you go. Follow your instincts. Make your characters specific, make decisions, everything you write should communicate some specific element of character. Thusfar the best character moment is Chester’s opening line, I don’t know if he was singing a specific song, but the way I read him singing it was funny. Don’t be afraid to take risks like this.

On Pacing: flesh everything out and dramatize it, have fun with the scenes, rather than concerning yourself with length. worry about cutting later, worry about the voices of each of the characters now and making sure each scene is as funny/dramatic/engaging as it ought to be. this isn’t an essay, there’s no page limit, you can always cut later. 


Other: You need to be patient and work harder on your screenplay, but I know if I send it to trusted readers without finishing the story, it won’t get the read/notes I need to improve, it’ll just be like a checkpoint, so I’m waiting until I complete my story which will drives me to be more productive. If you send it out early, it will deflate your momentum. You generally will only get one good read out of a reader so it’s generally best wait until you finish the first draft.


Overall, the number one thing I’d tell you is to write something and finish it rather than sending something that’s incomplete looking for conceptual validation. When you send something that’s not done, it gets ripped up because nothing’s fleshed out, it’s not even a first draft, then you get discouraged from continuing on it because some asshole didn’t get it.",,False,self,t5_2qupf,False,,,True,t3_11q18q,http://www.reddit.com/r/Screenwriting/comments/11q18q/just_some_good_advice_id_like_to_share/,

So... Hi guys! I'm a comic book artist and designer but looking to break into cartoon and live action storyboarding. I don't want to storyboard something that's already been seen (optioned or made movie scripts available online) or have a portfolio full of my own scripts, so instead I thought I'd come to you guys!

Anyone want a scene or two storyboarded that they wrote? It would fill my portfolio with your script and your portfolio with my storyboards. 
I'm open to all genres and styles, but I ask that submissions be in screenplay format and under 15 minutes... I know it would be awesome to have me do your whole movie, but I wouldn't be willing to ask you to work for free, so please respect that. I don't mind boarding a complete short screenplay as long as it's under 15 minutes. I want variety! Sci fi, westerns, comedy! Something I can show off without being pigeonholed.

If you would like to see some of my work (again, rebuilding a portfolio), check out [my website](http://www.panel2panel.com/). Thanks guys!
 
Legal: You'll retain the rights to all of your own writing as I will to my art, but I will let you use it for pitch or anything else you want (just credit me and consider me for the full time position should your project get picked up). These boards will be under a [creative common](http://creativecommons.org/)'s copyright license. People can share them, distribute them, show them, love on them, just don't ""sell"" them without my permission or without crediting me... So this means, spread the love if you like them. :) It's only advertising for my work.

**TL;DR: Comic book artist breaking into storyboarding. Will board your script of 15 pages or less for free to build up portfolio. Helps you sell your idea, helps me sell my talent.**

*Edit: Holy shiznats, Batmen, you guys are awesome! I step away for a few hours, and come back to quite a pileup of communications. I honestly didn't expect so many responses in PMs, private emails, and comments here... I will get to everyone within time, so thank you for your patience...*


*Edit II: CineSuppa mentioned signing an NDA below which I think is a wonderful idea. I don't want to infringe on anyone's creative hard work... So BEFORE I read any pages, I'm going to have both of us sign one, okay? This way what's yours stays yours.*

*Edit III: I found a free NDA [here](http://www.echosign.com/forms/nda.jsp) for anyone who wants to send along their pages. I have responded to the first batch of requests (between everyone, about 350 script pages in all), but am waiting until I see the NDAs. Also, after I'm done, I think it'll be fun to post the results here. Thanks again everyone! This is going to be a lot of fun.*

*Edit IV: Okay- NDAs are a soft spot for some. I don't want to step on anyone's toes which is why I offered them but I've gotten a lot of advice from people on this forum that I'm shooting myself in the foot and limiting MY ability to show this in my portfolio for free work. I'm comfortable without them, don't plan on stealing your pages, but if you would like to use one, I'm open to that too. We can draft our own copy. The one I linked to is a general one. I've also been advised that e-mail transcripts are legal in laying out what's expected of both parties...*

**That being said, I have received over 400 requests for this over the past 2 days... I have to close the gate and get to working on these other boards for people, so I have to end the offer now. I might do this again in the future just for kicks, but not sure. It's going to be a lot of work. This is going to be a lot of fun and I look forward to it. Thank you everyone who submitted pages and NDAs and communications.**",,False,self,t5_2qupf,1344350523.0,,,True,t3_xrn8b,http://www.reddit.com/r/Screenwriting/comments/xrn8b/anybody_need_storyboards/,

1370114600.0,30,self.Screenwriting,1fh7rg,ANNOUNCEMENT - The Great /r/Screenwriting FAQ.,32,2,12,http://www.reddit.com/r/Screenwriting/comments/1fh7rg/announcement_the_great_rscreenwriting_faq/,"Hi gang,

I think I've sorted out the wiki feature now, so I'd like to begin to compile a fairly-detailed Screenwriting FAQ for new members.

We get a lot of posts from new writers (which is great) - so it would be nice if we had some decent community resource which will answer all the basic questions (formatting, agents, managers, ideas, structure, etc).

In addition, I'm thinking of organising a semi-decent bibliography, with links to the major screenwriting books and websites that people find/found useful.

I don't really want to write it **all** myself (mainly to avoid any bias or unpopular opinions I may have, and to avoid making myself appear like an infallible spokesperson for the community). But I'm happy to do most of the work in organising and actually creating it, if that's easiest.

So how do you think this will work best? There are a few options:

* One option is for you lot to write the major questions in a thread specifically for asking FAQs - and for me to source/write the material and put together a basic draft. And then you can tell me how to improve/rewrite it.

* Another is for us to make a series of 'FAQ Threads', in which we ask one or two questions in the title, and the most upvoted answers become the basis for the actual FAQ.

* Or, I could ask for (knowledgeable) volunteers and we could work on it together.

None of them is *ideal* - the first doesn't seem like a very neat solution - the second relies on a very flawed voting mechanism and necessitates a lot of wasted writing - and the third relies on a lot of teamwork and is still a select few writing *ex cathedra*.

Perhaps a mix of them would be best - a series of FAQ threads for specific questions, which I can take the best points from, and edit into a series of succinct answers written by everyone?

What are your thoughts?

I'm not sure exactly how it'd work at the moment, but it'd be mostly about just being challenged to write something as best as you can. So it'd be something like a limit of 3 or 5 pages, and the challenge would basically consist of elements that must be included - such as genre or a character or both or whatever (a rom-com about a 50 yo auto tech, for instance). Maybe one week it's just that your script must include time-travel or contain a specific line of dialogue. Plenty of options.

This could be competitive, if desired. /r/photoshopbattles and other subs do stuff like that with flair rewards (so mods would need to be involved for that to happen). Or it could just be kept to simple write and receive feedback.

First and foremost, a few things to get out of the way: this is a throwaway account simply because I'd like to keep my personal account apart separate from this post. We have chosen not to post details about the company within this post itself simply to retain anonymity, but we have sent verification to the moderators.  

Now, on to the reason we're here. **We are looking for scripts!**

**Who are we**:

Small production company of working professional in their mid to late twenties, with many years of experience. We're not much different than other young professionals, what you see is pretty much what you get. Good contacts in the industry, decent financial backing, and many great jokes. 

**What we are after:**

* We are currently looking for short scripts no more than 25 pages in length. If they are shorter, that is even more appealing. However, we don't really want to give you a cap on page length because we want you to tell your story in however many pages it takes you to do so. We preffer shorter more/condencsed scripts simply because they can be more appealing on the fesitval curcuit. 

**Which brings me to my next point:**


We are looking for a script that **will be produced this year**. Why? We're aiming and hoping to get a short into the large festival circuit for the 2012-2013 season (Sundance, Tribecca, Telluride, ect.) At the moment we are only actively looking for short scripts, but if you have a feature that you feel very strongly about please do not hesitate to send it. You never know, we may just go for it. 

**Compensation:**

* There will be payment if we would like to produce your script. Given that this would be a directly professional endeavor for all parties involved, a deal will be negotiated between the production company and the writer. It should be noted that this isn't going to be a huge six figure deal or anything- but we will be happily paying for a good script. 

**If you are interested in submitting please make sure you do these things before doing so:**

* Register your script with the WGA. We're not here to steal your ideas, we're here to work together to make a movie. This **protects you** in any event. 
* Please, please, please only submit scripts which are in proper standard screenplay format. Anything which is not may not be looked at.
* Please be sure to add a logline and genre on your title page. And of course, any and all contact information. 
* All genres and stories are welcome. 
* Please submit scripts as .PDFs.

Lastly, **this is not a contest**. We are looking for finished works. If you are still revising your script(s), please go head and finish before submitting. We're not giving deadlines but of course, the sooner the better. 

Please submit all scripts to Throwawaymovieguy@gmail.com. Again, this is not our professional address, we are simply opting for anonymity for the time being. 

Thanks, Reddit! Very much excited to reading your scripts!",,False,self,t5_2qupf,True,,,True,t3_o2q06,http://www.reddit.com/r/Screenwriting/comments/o2q06/production_company_accepting_scripts_send_us_what/,

This will be an iterative guide so please if I miss anything just add it in the comments and I will continually update. Perhaps we can add this to the sidebar (or just quietly keep this in your back pocket). 

-------------------

**Google searching**

A great number of scripts can be found through the magic of Google. The trick is knowing how to search for it. I'll give a list of a number of different queries that will give you over 90% success in finding a script if that script is in fact online. I'll use *Pitch Black* as an example. Simply change the script name and otherwise copy the query character for character (without the numbers of course). 

1. *Pitch Black screenplay*

2. *Pitch Black script*

3. *Pitch Black pdf*

4. *Pitch Black file:.pdf*

5. *Pitch Black site:mediafire.com*

6. *Pitch Black pdf site:mediafire.com*

7. *Pitch Black site:sendspace.com*

8. *Pitch Black pdf site:sendspace.com*

9. *Pitch.black.pdf*

10. *Pitch-black.pdf*

11. *Pitch_black.pdf*

12. *Pitch Black Wheat screenplay* 

Tips:

* As seen in step 12, you can add the term ""Wheat"" to any of the above queries (steps 1-8); Wheat is the last name of one of the authors (you can use full names or last names, whatever works). Some films share titles with popular phrases or names that may impede your Google searching so by adding the screenwriter's name, you end up with a much more targeted search (for you science nerds, this increases your search's specificity). You can  trying throwing the word ""download"" in as well.

* Similar to the first bullet above, you may want to put the name of the script within quotations in order to receive a much more targeted search. For example: *""Pitch Black"" pdf*

* Similar to the second bullet above, in your preliminary searching, you may come across some fake download sites, or some other sites where you learn the *exact* name of the script file. For example, let's say the Pitch Black script pdf was circulating as *PitchBlackscreenplayWheat.pdf*. This is just a fake example, but in that case, you would use quotations and your Google query would read as follows: *""PitchBlackscreenplayWheat.pdf""* &lt;-- be sure to use the quotations. Over time you'll develop a sense of what a ""fake download site"" is and which links are or are not spam. 

**Websites**

Let's try and keep a revolving list of great sites. (I can't vouch for all these sites.)

**Torrents**

There are huge packs of unreleased scripts (containing 10-150 scripts) floating around on torrent sites. If you want a good torrent client, use [utorrent](http://www.utorrent.com/).

I'll list some great torrents when I get home but for some quick hits, simply Google the following: 

* unreleased movie scripts torrent
* screenplays torrent
* upcoming screenplays torrent
  
*Actual torrents:*

* [6](http://sharereactor.com/release/15006-unreleased-movie-scripts-pack-5.htm)

Note: (Most should have seeders but if they don't just let it run a few days and hopefully a seeder will log on).

**Buying Scripts Online**

When in doubt, you can buy scripts online from sites like [ScriptCity](http://www.scriptcity.com) or [ScriptFly](http://www.scriptfly.com)

1366641122.0,26,self.Screenwriting,1cv4xq,Love Triangles,33,7,18,http://www.reddit.com/r/Screenwriting/comments/1cv4xq/love_triangles/,"I saw a film on Saturday night: Oblivion (the new Tom Cruise movie). 

It was a decidedly ‘meh’ movie. It wasn’t terrible, but if I’d needed to go to the loo part of the way through I doubt I would’ve been too fussed about missing bits. That's how I've come to gauge films now, by how annoyed I'd be at having to miss a bit because of a loo break.

Anyway, this movie did something that bugged me immensely. It depicted a love triangle in traditional Hollywood style. They’re the same as normal person love triangles in all but one aspect; their resolution.

In movies (and TV), whenever there is a love triangle (and there often is, as it’s an easy way of introducing a conflict in a romantic sub-plot) between Jim, Jess and Joanne it always one of two ways:

1.	Joanne gives her blessing for Jim and Jess to be together, selflessly realizing that they are ‘supposed to be together’
2.	Joanne is killed off

Jim and Jess live happily ever after, as we all knew they would because the film-maker has gone to great lengths to demonstrate that they are made for each other. Story over, enjoy the credits.

This is one of the more frustrating bits of bullshit you see in fiction. The love triangle is introduced for the sake of providing conflict on Jim and Jess’ inevitable road to happiness, and we’re never expected to take Joanne particularly seriously. As such, she either removes herself from the equation or is removed by external forces. The reason for it is obvious, no-body wants to risk their romantic lead being reviled for needlessly breaking someone’s heart on screen. As much as that is exactly what would have to happen in real life, audiences wouldn’t respond well to it. We wouldn’t want Jim to live happily ever after, not after seeing him reduce Joanne to tears. 

We end up with a false idea about how these things pan out. Without wanting to sound like an interesting person, at various points in my life, I’ve been Jim, Jess and Joanne so I can tell you exactly what happens to each of them in the end:

-	Joanne’s heart is broken by someone she cared for, and who she genuinely believed cared for her. She may or may not have ever known about Jess’ existence/romantic interest in Jim, so there’s a good chance that she’s totally unprepared for what happens which makes it so much worse. Eventually, it becomes just another heart-break, but at the time it devastates her because someone she was in love with has basically looked her in the eye and said “you are great, but she’s even better.” That’s about as hurtful as it gets. 

-	Jim feels guilty about what he did to Joanne, and often finds himself thinking about whether he did the right thing. During rough spots with Jess, he’ll fantasize about his life would have been like if he’d chosen Joanne. He’ll never fully accept that he’s burnt that bridge until one day he bumps into her and she makes it abundantly clear that he can go to hell. 

-	Jess may or may not know about Joanne’s interest, but even if she doesn’t during the event she’ll find out at some point. She’ll feel superior at first that she was picked over someone else, then she’ll start worrying that Jim sometimes thinks about the things listed above. Despite the fact that she won, she’ll become paranoid. At first it’ll be paranoia whenever Jim has to see Joanna, paranoia that he’ll realize he made a mistake and will change his mind on the spot. Then it’ll spread to paranoia about all the women in Jim’s life. She knows that at one point in his life he compared her to someone else and decided on her. Who’s to say he doesn’t compare her to every woman he meets? How long before he compares her to someone who comes out quite favourably? After all, Joanne thought she and Jim were going to be together forever, then along came you.

When the time comes for the love triangle sub-plot to end in real life, Joanne doesn’t bow out gracefully. She wanted Jim and still does, and she won’t back down until Jim makes it clear that it’s over and she lost. Joanne also doesn’t magically get killed off (and if she did it would hardly result in Jim living happily ever after), she doesn’t suddenly meet her soul mate within 30 seconds of Jim ditching her, and she doesn’t suddenly become philosophical and decide it’s all for the best.

So yes. The Hollywood love triangle, where everybody is super-mature and fine with getting their heart broken. A frustrating bit of bullshit that gets slipped under our radar at the movies and on TV all the damn time. It cheats us from seeing what our romantic hero is actually made of out of fear that we won’t like what we see. It tells us that people can walk away from emotional train wrecks without a scratch on them, when they don’t. They really bloody don’t. Nobody does. 

I just wanted to vent this to some fellow writers, feel free to point out the inevitable pile of movies where love triangles do occur as I've described (there's bound to be a couple). I hope it provides some food for thought for anyone writing romance out there.

The purpose of this group would be to help each other in our writing; pointing out the flaws and problems in script.

The way it works: we would send each other pages, review them, and meet either bi-monthly or monthly via Google Huddle (a group chat for Google+) to discuss them, giving notes to one another.

I would be willing to run 3 different groups if need be: beginners, advanced, and professional.  We would place you based on experience, and writing ability.  The reason for having these groups is that the beginners are not going to be able to learn, or understand, the same things that the professionals do.  The hardest part is determining what group you belong in.  

Beginner is someone who has little to no writing experience.  You don't know where to start, or how to format a script.  You need to learn the basics to screenwriting and want to learn where to start.

The Advanced group would be people who know how to write and have maybe written their first feature, or have a couple under their belt.  They understand the idea of conflict and how to utilize it in a scene.  You know how the story flows, but there are still some questions you might have on where to take the story, and how to set up the character arcs.  You don't know how to develop different stories within your script (ie: A Story, B Story, C Story) but are working towards this.

The Professional group would be just that, people in the industry who have written and sold something, or are writing their first real sellable script.  This is a place for someone who has had a few scripts under their belt, understand all the concepts of writing, and the concept of story.  They understand how to write dialogue and know the 5 points to a script.  In order to considered for this you must have either IMDB Credits or can demo straight to all the members of this group that you can write.  This is not for the faint of heart as the purpose of this group is to tear your script apart and give you real notes, and real feedback.  You can be kicked out of the group at any time if the members feel that your writing is lacking, if you are not keeping up with your reading or writing, or if they feel that you are becoming a problem for the group.

Please let me know if any of you are interested and what group you are interested in joining.  I would be more than happy to get this going and help run these groups, eventually letting those in each group run themselves.  Lets help one another guys!!!  Today's beginner writers are tomorrows Academy Award Winners!


**[edit]** So I've stared to get this list together.  I have about 17 people in the three groups.  I will not be running these groups, I'm just organizing.  If there are any people out there interested in running the groups please let me know.

1302028123.0,29,self.Screenwriting,gja4g,"Would anyone be interested in doing a ""Screenplay of the Week"" type thing, where we pick a produced script and discuss it? Here's my pick for the week:  ",30,1,20,http://www.reddit.com/r/Screenwriting/comments/gja4g/would_anyone_be_interested_in_doing_a_screenplay/,"[Mulholland Drive](http://www.lynchnet.com/mdrive/mdscript.html) by David Lynch.

I've found that I learn more about the craft of screenwriting by reading them than by reading about them in How-To books and such. It's always interesting to see how something written down translates onto the screen. I envision this as a weekly script review as a way to discuss the writing itself--the style, techniques used, what worked, what maybe didn't work--not a movie review (there's plenty of those already).

Every writer seems to have his/her own quirks. For instance, John Carpenter's *Halloween* script--written in three weeks--is really sparse, with frequent use of POV. It reads like a director's script, not as something somene wrote hoping to get made. It almost seems like Carpenter already knew beforehand how he would shoot the film, negating the use of heavy description in the script.

Wheras, Lynch's script, written for himself obviously as the director of the film, reads like a mini-novel. There are large blocks of text, and much of the action involves subtext and subtelty. I actually found it slightly easier to follow than the movie. There is little ""We see"" in MD, but it does crop up from time to time.  

Lynch is also amazingly specific, especially when it comes to describing furniture. For instance, he doesn't just say Ray meets a secretary, he writes, ""Ray walks into a windowless reception area where a beautiful Italian woman sits behind a large, blonde, modern, built-in desk."" That's a ton of detail for a desk.   

**Edit**: Thanks for the response, everyone! I agree with doing it monthly, as that seems to work the best for everyone. 

After some feedback from mods and others here, I'll go ahead and make a separate post for Mulholland Drive. In the future, maybe we could have a voting system in a separate thread to determine the script for the next month, but in the meanwhile, we have David Lynch, Naomi Watts, and lesbian sex. Poor us!

1295902714.0,27,self.Screenwriting,f8aiz,"So I attended Black Swan screenwriter's speech at the University of Tampa, some info inside....",35,8,8,http://www.reddit.com/r/Screenwriting/comments/f8aiz/so_i_attended_black_swan_screenwriters_speech_at/,"My humble impressions:
1. The dude was old, like 60-65 maybe? His energy level was a bit down (jet lag from flying from New York? ;)), but he was very informal and cracked few jokes. He was a huge contrast with the professors out there who were all stuck up. 
2. Based on what he told, screenwriting is some crazy process that involves several people working on a script that is getting changed a lot. It also seems that directors like to write their own stuff, so where is the place for a solitary screenwriter working on a script?
3. The original screenplay is only one small part of his work, because he mainly works on novel adaptations, mini-series screenplays, and stuff like that.
4. The number of changes the initial script goes through is mind-blowing.

I took notes, so apologies for some hectic stuff here, it was a bit hectic as they jumped from topic to topic.

1. How “Black Swan” started. Darren Aronofsky and John McLaughlin worked together on HBO series about hunted houses (still has not been finished) then one day Darren called and asked John McLaughlin about ballet thriller. Why ballet? Because it was an interesting backdrop. Darren had the idea for 5+ years and initially it was set up in theater (if I got it correctly). The draft was already done by somebody else, but John reworked it and then a third screenwriter worked on it too. Anyway, John and Darren went to New York ballet, talked to dancers a lot, attended a lot of rehearsals. So the idea was to show the beauty vs. terror inside a person. When John was working on a script he knew that Natalie will be a lead, she was attached to a project since day 1. The whole process of writing the script went in “circles” (John’s words) as Darren has been working and re-working stuff and they had like tons of drafts. Interestingly, the initial idea was that Natalie will play both roles (Mila’s role) and they also thought that it might go like the aging ballerina (that was played by Winona Ryder ) committing suicide was in fact Natalie, and the movie was the chain of events leading to it. But then they decided it was too cheesy and cliché and decided not to do it.
2. Somebody asked a question how could all male writers write about a female?
John said that it was true and they were trying to find something in common with a character and built on that. Darren’s sister was into ballet and John said that he can definitely identify with Nina’s paranoia. He also mentioned that female driven movie hard to finance.
3. Film school professor asked what was a “log line” for Black Swan? John started to laugh and said “I do not know!” Then he said that they tried to tell a story of a protagonist the public can sympathize with. Ballerinas are unique types of artists who have the shortest career life span. The window of opportunity is very small and at the very young age they already know whether they’ll make it or not. Nina was at the point when her “shelf life” was almost up. She also had very difficult relationships with her mother and even other dancers, outsider of a sort.
They tried to convey “perfectionism” in a dialogue, dialogue was written by Darren, John and other writer after him. (so basically at least 4 people worked on that script in some way or the other).
Darren also wanted her to self-mutilate and be anorexic. Throughout the movie we see a lot of red color and it was John’s intention as he likes to “work with colors” while writing his screenplays. He said he tries to not to be conscious with words because it chokes the progress. Then he mentioned that there is a lot of orange color in Hitchcock’s “Psycho” and it was because Hitchcock himself was on a diet of mainly oranges at the time. 
4. Somebody asked about leg bending scene, was it a bit over the top? John said that sometimes nothing is wrong with being over the top a bit. He said that he did not write about lots of physiological horrors of Black Swan, but he wrote about feathers plucking. Bending legs were added later to the script. Darren had the idea for at least 5 years. One person sort of hallucinates about themselves. 
5. Somebody asked how many drafts? He said at least 3-4 initial, he did 6 outlines and 4 more drafts, a person after him did a bazillion more drafts, more like one draft a day as they have been changing a lot of stuff. 
6. John adapts some novels as well and somebody asked about novels adaptations. John: novel just has too much info and his job is to sort out what to leave and what is not worth bothering about. Recently he did an adaptation of non-fiction book on how Hitchcock worked on Psycho. So John’s pitch was to take this book and relate it to the movie as well as to the actual murderer’s life (Psycho was based on real murderer). Hitchcock had a life crisis before Psycho and at the end of the movie Hitchcock was all disillusioned and even pissed because in his view he had been giving his public “champagne” his all life and now he gave them a beer and they like it all the same. However, for the murderer the movie ends well because he is an instant celebrity in prison, away from his dead mother and carrying corpses. Anthony Hopkins is attached to that project. John said that when he adapts the novel, even though he cuts a lot, he still tries to stay faithful to what novel’s author wanted to convey, the main message. 
7. Somebody asked about different kinds of pressures a screenwriter has to deal with when working on low budget independent movie vs. block buster. John said that pressures are present in both cases, only of a different nature. 
8. Somebody asked if he writes for himself or for his audience? John replied that “I can do what I respond to; you cannot predict what audience will like”. First draft usually has a lot of his writing for himself, but during production a lot of that got striped down. His strategy is to tell as little as possible and write it mainly in a way he likes it, hoping that producers will like the finished product as well. He said that every person involved in movie making process has a vision how the movie should be but he usually tries to go along with director’s vision. 
9. Somebody asked what was excluded from the “Black Swan” and he thinks it was wrong. John replied that during their research they spent a lot of time in Ballet Theater and discovered very strange sub-culture. There are tons of people hanging around the back stage, including moms with kids waiting for autographs. However, there is also a group of “stalkerish” people who are truly devoted to the ballet, know all people by names, always carry with them thick books with photos of each dancer, every program and every autograph, and they keep asking for more autographs. These people creeped out Darren and him, but the scene did not end up in the movie. 
9. Somebody asked about his training, his path and what advice he has for young screenwriters.
He replied that it is extremely hard to find a screenwriter who likes how profession works. Screenwriters are bitter people, who trade money for their artistic freedom. He also added that there are 3 things that are extremely important for every screenwriter:
a) Connections. Everybody in Hollywood is a son or a daughter of some celebrity or at least some rich and powerful person. Very tight club, so one has to connect with as many people as possible.
b) Write a lot. And make sure you finish scripts Even if you hate it still finish it regardless. The more you do it the better it gets.
c) Do not be afraid of being screwed. Do not refuse to sell a script for 5000 USD or even for 5. Let them screw you, you get screwed and you get recognized. If you write a lot and have a lot of scripts you can get screwed. Start small and make connections.
10. Someone asked how he deals with writer’s block. He usually goes and sees one very BAD movie, while watching it he thinks what he can do differently and by the time he is home he is so angry about that shitty movie that he starts writing. He also suggested writing in the morning, before you go to bathroom, that way you can be sure that you’ll write at least something.

Why does everything seem so loosely connected?


How do structure your best dialogue and where does it come from?

Do you do any prewriting exercises?

How much do you outline beforehand?

How do you build on your best ideas and where do they come from?

If you write everyday to create something, what are you writing?

How do you build scenes?

Are there any methods you have to approaching anything specific that comes up during writing or even rewriting?

I recently stumbled upon screenwriting by accident, and have fallen in love with it. If the instructors at the Vancouver Film School are to be trusted I'm actually a Natural Born Screenwriter. 

Here's the deal: I have a family to look after and have a full-time job, which means moving to L.A. is out of the question. I'm also near-broke, so even a trip to L.A. to meet execs would be a financial burden - for the moment, at least. 

Is it too late for me to dream the screenwriter dream? All the blogs, books, etc that I've read seem to underline that moving to L.A. is a must. Is it impossible to get an agent while not living in L.A.? Does anybody know of any good agents in Vancouver? And I don't know anybody in the film industry, including in Vancouver... how should I approach this networking crisis?

I'm currently working on a number of scripts and trying to learn my craft as best as I can. I've read ""Story"", ""Save the Cat!"", ""Save the Cat Goes to the Movies"", ""The Portable Film School""... you name it. I'm also working on a number of script ideas, hopefully enough for a portfolio. But my logistic restraints have me stumped. Any advice/pointers would be much appreciated))

1352129244.0,27,self.Screenwriting,12o4li,Black List 3.0 -- after further review,32,5,32,http://www.reddit.com/r/Screenwriting/comments/12o4li/black_list_30_after_further_review/,"I got into some heated back and forth with a few of you a few days ago, and while I still take serious issue with the site I believe there is one very important tool it can offer to the aspiring writer that I did not acknowledge previously:

It will tell you how good you are.

As an example, I've been reading a lot of commentary elsewhere wherein writers are SHOCKED at how low their scores are turning out. Like 1s and 2s (out of 10). And these writers are shocked because these are scripts that have gotten great feedback from notes services and placed well or even won contests elsewhere. But that's the problem isn't it -- even with those resources it's nearly impossible to tell if our scripts are truly good or just better than most of what's out there. And so while positive feedback from these places is a great short-term ego boost, it's also a soul crusher in the long run when nothing ever seems to get traction in ""the real world.""

Thus, a reality-check may be the most valuable thing BL3.0 has to offer to the aspiring writer. Current commentary suggests that an average of 7.0, but more likely 8.0, from at least two readers (paid or otherwise) is what it takes to garner serious attention. I've heard enough success stories already to believe that such attention can pay off, and quickly (i.e. no need for multi-month, automatically renewed hosting, which, for the record, is still my biggest gripe with the site).

Those scripts that are rated 8s and above are getting the heat. So if your script scores a 1 or 2 from a reader you know it's a long way away (or maybe you just need a second opinion at $50 a pop -- though Franklin indicates that almost all reader scores are nearly identical or within 2 ""points"" of each other). So 1s and 2s mean back to the drawing board. A 5 or 6, you're doing great but still ""high-level amateur"". And a 7,8, or 9 -- get thee some Ray-Bans because LA is hella sunny.

And that's great information to have. You can know with certainty where you stand on the totem pole. And you can put confidence in your ""grade"" because it appears that the site is accurately reflecting industry taste. Not the taste of a contest panel, not the taste of a script doctor, not the taste of your college professor. If you want to know exactly where you stand in the eyes of the people who really count, then this site may offer the quickest path to that knowledge.

For that reason alone it may be worth considering. As for me, $75-$125 is too hefty a premium just to know how I stack up. But ask me again in a few years...

Please take note of the [following](http://www.reddit.com/r/Screenwriting/comments/nnq3e/reddit_send_me_your_scripts/c3akvkk):

We see far too many threads pop up requesting scripts without any identifying information. While it's been unofficial policy to remove these (and we've never once had a submitter follow-up regarding a removed post), it appears time to make it official and add a disclaimer on the sidebar.

If you want to solicit redditors for scripts for contests or other *professional* reasons, please either a) include official contact or identifying information in your post (and use your professional email address) or b) verify with the moderators (e.g., send us an email from your organization or some other form of verification). Failure to do so will result in removal. 

The WIN A TICKET TO PITCHFEST contest (see header bar) is an example of a contest done right.

If you want to solicit redditors for scripts for *personal* reasons (e.g., to find a writing partner, etc.), feel free to do so as long as you make it clear that your reasons are personal. 

Thoughts from you guys and gals?

Anyone opposed to this stance? In favor?

This is a small, disciplined writing group that's existed for seven months with minimal turnover.

The rules are simple:

Declare the project you're working on. Every week you owe 5-10 pages on that project at 2:00 PM Saturday. We meet at 7 PM Sunday for 2 hours. During that time, we take turns commenting on each other's material.


If you fail to meet either obligation, you owe the group coffee. It's simple and fun. It's a tough pace to work at, but by joining, you'll gain discipline, a reason for writing, an audience, and kickass notes from some awesome redditors.


The group is a good was to instill discipline, set achievable deadlines, and get a gut check as to whether your story is working or not. Four first scripts, a second draft polish screenplays and two TV specs. All of us say that the group has made us more efficient than we've ever been before.
If you're in checking us out on Sunday, PM me a paragraph describing yourself and your relevant screenwriting experience.

EDIT: I'm out of slots for this week, but I'm replying to everyone individually.  If you're interested, hit me up next week.

Another thing to announce! **Upcoming AMAs!**

But I need your help to make them a success.

I want to host them here, rather than in /r/iama -- and so we have to find a way of ensuring that they get as much attention as possible (we're still a relatively small subreddit, after all).

What I've decided is that we'll make the specific AMA thread beforehand (see below), and put the link in the new sticky bar at the top. 

That way, you can leave your questions in advance, as well as ask them live -- and hopefully by the time the person comes online, there'll already be a host of questions ready for them.

###**So *please* try and populate the AMA threads with questions.** 

The success of these early AMAs will decide whether we make the effort to try and get more people. 

We have the possibility to get some **really big** people to come and talk to us (like, seriously big) - **but we have to make sure it's worth their while**. 

It takes a lot of energy to do an AMA (and to set one up), and they're so stressful if the person is online and waiting for questions.

This means thinking up some decent ones!

---

So -- the announcement! The first AMA of the new series: --

* **Gary Goldstein, (Producer - PRETTY WOMAN, THE MOTHMAN PROPHECIES, UNDER SIEGE) -- Wednesday 15th May at 10:30am PDT.**

**-- [CLICK HERE FOR THE AMA THREAD](http://www.reddit.com/r/Screenwriting/comments/1e6m2r/i_am_gary_goldstein_producer_of_pretty_woman_the/) --** please help fill it with questions before Wednesday!

--- 

*(If you have any suggestions for future AMAs - and have a way that I can contact the person  - or even just their publicist/assistant - put it in a comment here, and I'll see what I can do!)*

*(And this is a self-post, so please upvote for visibility.)*

**EDIT: -** I forgot to mention, huge thanks once again to /u/MayorPoopenmeyer for helping set this one up!

Came across this article earlier this week and it got me thinking of how flat my scenes seem to fall. (http://movieline.com/2010/03/23/david-mamets-memo-to-the-writers-of-the-unit/) Really hit on what should be part of a scene, but what I am looking for are possible exercises that you have seen, or have found to work in the past, that could help improve someone's ability to write good scenes. Anything that could help in either the development and planning of a scene, or the writing of the scene itself.

Hope this helps out others who are experiencing the same problem I am.

I was thinking maybe we could use this as our  first topic [""But I've Seen Everything."" ](http://youtu.be/Fg_cwI1Xj4M?t=50s)   
  
Purely for shits and giggles but I think this would be fun.

**EDIT**: Alright guys well I've messaged the moderators to hopefully get some more people in on this. User [MayorPoopenmeyer](http://www.reddit.com/r/Screenwriting/comments/leofq/would_anyone_be_interested_in_a_screenwriting/c2s9l2c?context=3) offered a prize of a ticket to [PitchFest](http://pitchfest.com/index.shtml) next year for a full-length script. I'm trying to organize things on my end before we decide what direction we'll take this in. If we do decide to use the prize then I feel the parameters of the contest should fall on MayorPoopenMeyer. If anyone has any suggestions please message me or comment and let me know. I've never started a contest so bear with me and if anyone feels they can do a better job I am all ears baby.

  
**EDIT 2**: I talked a bit more with user MayorPoopenmeyer and anyone can reach him at Bob@pitchfest.com. Please don't bother him with questions you think I could answer. Wish him luck for his film screening! Tomorrow I'll post a new thread discussing suggestions and the like so we can set up the parameters. I have yet to hear from the mods so hopefully they get back to me soon. Try to think about rules on topics, deadlines, and whether we go by anonymous vote or we try to assemble a panel of judges. I wanted to Xpost to r/writing and r/movies but I'm not so sure now. It's going to depend on how we go about choosing the winner.  
 
  **EDIT 3**: Well if we go by a panel of judges then Xposting might work against us because we'd have a lot more writers but maybe not so many judges. And if we go by anonymous voting well i don't think some writers would appreciate their work out in the open unprotected. I'll link everyone to the new thread tomorrow. Most likely around noon or a bit afterwards. If someone wants to go ahead and do it before make sure to link everyone in this thread. EVERYONE. We got a good size here and I don't want anyone to miss out.
  
**EDIT 4**: This started as a silly contest but now we have an awesome prize. It's just the ticket so you would need to fond your own lodging and travel but you'll have until next June I believe to save. No one is making money off this and there is not going to be an entrance fee! Well maybe if you're idea gets picked up at PitchFest you stand to make a little money;)

**EDIT 5**: This will have to be a full-length screenplay, we'll discuss this some more later, and the topic will be open. We discussed having a closed topic but it would be better to use your best work if you were hoping to pitch it. We want you to pitch it!

1352087583.0,24,self.Screenwriting,12neaw,On improving this subreddit,27,3,21,http://www.reddit.com/r/Screenwriting/comments/12neaw/on_improving_this_subreddit/,"Hey all,

Nice to see folks wanting to improve things. Just responding to state of screenwriting thread so that this response is visible.

* Blogspam. What's your definition of blogspam? Users choose what makes it on the front page through upvoting/downvoting. It's a slippery slope if moderators start deciding which posts become visible. This is one of few subreddits where it's encouraged to promote your own material. I have noticed a few posters posting more frequently than others but they all seem to be posting original content. It might not be of the highest quality but it seems to me like an abuse of power if we started actively blocking what we feel is poor quality. I do remove posts that have no content but it's rare since the spam filter does a pretty good job of blocking true spam. What we remove most are posts requesting scripts without any identifying information (also rare). Redditors also have the ability to label posts as spam though that rarely happens. I have mentioned to some of the frequent posters to try to limit their posting but they control how much they post. 

* ""I personally feel as if this sub should act as a place for screenwriting discussion and also a place for people to submit their work for constructive criticism."" I wasn't aware that this wasn't that. If you want things improved, you can start by submitting high quality links, generating your own unique content, reading people's scripts and giving constructive criticism and so on. That's the job of everyone not the moderators. A community is only as good as its members. We as moderators used to be more active, for example with the SOTM series, but it fell apart due to lack of participation. Anyone can start a series like that on their own. Just make a post. Such threads are great to enjoy and learn from but someone still needs to own it (i.e., do the hard work). 

* Flair. There was a suggestion for professional-based flair but it seemed kind of purposeless. The professional folk here seem to prefer anonymity (I'm basing this on the many threads that asked if there were any professional writers on this subreddit; of all the responses, very few redditors actually gave their identities when asked). What benefit is it for them to have flair next to their name? Besides, the logistics are difficult to implement (e.g., how do we verify?). And where do we draw the line (e.g., a production credit is hardly a good measuring stick)? Finally, we already have a flair system and anyone can add whatever they want next to their name (there are pre-set genre tags but you can enter custom text; so professional writers wishing to distinguish themselves can already do so; then again they could be lying). This is my general sense but I could be wrong. 

* AMAs. You want AMAs? Awesome. Find someone to do an AMA. I've asked a few people in my time but had no luck. Anyone can arrange an AMA; if you want it to be visible, just contact a moderator. 

* Sidebar. I've updated the sidebar. Any other suggestions? Unfortunately it's limited by word count. What isn't clear about it? It would be great to keep it clean but these issues kept recurring and I feel that the text helps answer recurring questions to some effect. Thoughts?

All that said, things have stumbled recently so I'm not trying to make excuses. I've been pretty busy and it appears the other mods have as well. But to be transparent, we've received almost no messages contacting the moderators so we've been fairly passive. These suggestion threads pop up all the time but are quickly forgotten because no one wants to do the work of owning a suggestion (we are to blame in that too). If you're passionate about something, champion it, make a thread, then just contact one of us and we'd be happy to help. But that's really all we can do. We have limited powers.

But yeah, let's keep the discussion going. I'm open to suggestions. 

*Just remember* -- if you suggest something, be prepared to own it. 

EDIT: 

A few action items:

1. Limit blogspam or over-active posters.

2. Remove beginner posts and point them to the common questions thread.

3. Remove ""I just finished my script!"" posts.

4. Find a solution to /r/readmyscript. I propose keeping /r/readmyscript open but having Feedback Fridays on /r/screenwriting where script critiques are posted on Fridays only and are otherwise removed.

5. Add more mods.

6. Write great script.

Every couple of days, someone will make a post in r/screenwriting with a misguided attempt at asking for something along the lines of a response to the script they wrote.

And every time, screenwriter/redditors will tear them to pieces and rip them apart for making such an amateur post, probably discouraging them from ever attempting to write again. (this is good because it weeds out the weak writers, and eliminate future competition, but I really hope r/screenwriting would be a bit more supportive than that.)

So to prevent this from happening, please follow these rules when making future self posts:

* Figure out exactly what you want out of this post, and STATE IT AS SUCH. If you are a beginning writer working on your first script, this might take some soul searching to do. If you're looking for a writing partner, then say that. If you're looking for some feedback and response, then say that. There is plenty of people ready to give you advice on your script, and discuss the many merits of the craft, but remember that this is NOT a screenwriting school. And no one here is going to hand-held you through it when they have plenty of their own scripts to work on.

*No one here is criticizing you. But we are criticizing your work, and only through that will your work and writing get better. So when you receive advice, please don't just shut off and become defensive. The ability to listen and understand response to your work is an acquired skill of a great screenwriter. If everyone is saying it, then maybe there is something wrong. And we may not always be able to tell you exactly how to fix it, because that's kind of up to you.

*No one here is going to steal your idea/script. Paranoia about other people stealing your ideas is the mark of an amateur screenwriter. If you really feel unsafe about it, then register it. If someone did stole your script and turn it into a movie (chances of happening would be like hitting the lottery), then be glad that you can sue, or that your script turned into a movie and you can now write an even better one. Everyone here is working on their OWN idea and probably has a whole drawer full of more ideas waiting to be worked on. Your idea is no better than theirs.

That's all I can think of for now. Anyone has anything else they want to add?

My friend is a assistant producer and we are looking to make something together, the budget will not be great, but due to my years of editing i will know how to shoot for the edit and overall picture, unlike other directors who dont have plan for bringing it all together! 

My influence is pretty much the David Fincher school of film, where a single shot can tell a thousand words! 

If there are any questions please ask, mostly this week i will be watching render bars!

EDIT: Run Time - less than 15 really, due to the natural of the low budget i would rather put my money in to something that looks great and is really tight for 15 minutes then spread over 20+

1. Ultra sensitivity to those around you, or knowing why people do what they do instinctively 

2. A great long term memory. Remembering details about people and the world is necessary to create something that feels real.

3. Something to say.

4. The knowledge of what makes a great story.

4. The technique to put it all down on paper.

5. Dedication.

To:   [REDACTED] and [REDACTED]
Date:  February 20, 2013

Dear Messrs. [REDACTED]

It has recently come to our attention that you have an independent short film project under development using the name “Paradox.”  It is our understanding that the story line for your film involves the invention of time travel and a mysterious stranger who seeks to prevent the use of this invention.

Please be advised that on May 21, 2012 [REDACTED] registered with the Writers Guild of America, West, a screenplay for a feature length film with the title “Paradox,” which has a similar story line to yours.  The WGA Registration Number for this screenplay is 1582719.  A copy of the WGA Certificate is attached for your information.

Ms. [REDACTED] and her co-producer are presently developing her screenplay for professional production.  We must ask, therefore, that you immediately desist from using the title “Paradox” for your project.  

We will be grateful if you would favor us with a reply confirming your receipt of this communication and your compliance with our request.

We apologize that the only method of communicating with you that we have found is informally via your Facebook email addresses.

We wish you the very best of luck with your re-titled project.  

Sincerely yours,

[REDACTED]
Attorney for [REDACTED] and [REDACTED] Film, LLC
[REDACTED]@aol.com

I plan on submitting my student film to various festivals and am wondering what would happen if I just kept using the name. Surely I'm not required to comply without more information, at least an official synopsis?

---

**EDIT** - My mistake, the warning was NOT from the WGA, but rather the Director of the film's relative who claims to be a lawyer for the project. They DID upload a scan of a WGA certificate for a film called ""Paradox"" however, and according to an indiegogo made 3 weeks after mine, the plot IS similar-ish.


But, didn't they only register the title of the SCRIPT? My movie is going into production next week, doesn't that give me the leg up on the title of the FILM, unless they registered said film with the MPAA?",,False,self,t5_2qupf,1361418520.0,,,True,t3_18xgb0,http://www.reddit.com/r/Screenwriting/comments/18xgb0/i_received_a_legal_notice_from_the_wga_in_regards/,

I'm also wondering how critical formatting is.  I am not too familiar with it, although I have been reading screenplays all week., If I get the majority of it down on paper how hard would it be able to find someone to reformat it properly, and what I have to give credit for it (ideally I would just like to flat pay for it)?",,False,self,t5_2qupf,False,,,True,t3_1af9rz,http://www.reddit.com/r/Screenwriting/comments/1af9rz/any_disabled_screenwriters_out_there_using_dragon/,

A year ago, the only scripts I ""read"" were those read aloud in my college class. This semester, I was in a serious writing slump. From January to two weeks ago, I couldn't write or think up anything I liked. 

Then, I started reading scripts. I put about twenty scripts on my Kindle and read six or seven in one week. A week ago, I had with an idea for a short and wrote the ten pages for it the next night. I spent the next week rewriting and revising. 

My college class loved it. I get more joy out of writing it than I have from any other script. And now I want to read scripts more than play video games or watch movies. **Just like exercise, it's about establishing a habit and sticking to it.** You're exercising your mind to think in different ways by reading, then putting it into practice when you write. 

tl;dr: Reading screenplays might help you get out of a writing slump (or give you some extra inspiration.) It worked for me and now I want to read scripts whenever I have free time.

When we started our writing partnership, we agreed to split everything  50/50. However, my partner is part of the company and is essentially asking me to sign my rights away to him and the producer. Is this standard operating procedure?

1327444033.0,22,self.Screenwriting,ov3hi,Craig Mazin's concept of Central Dramatic Argument,23,1,10,http://www.reddit.com/r/Screenwriting/comments/ov3hi/craig_mazins_concept_of_central_dramatic_argument/,"Anyone who's listened to the Scriptnotes podcast will know that Mazin is vehemently against plot structure mechanics as put forth by the various screenwriting gurus.  

I was browsing the [Done Deal Pro](http://messageboard.donedealpro.com/boards/) boards (an awesome resource if you haven't been there), and came across a [heated discussion](http://messageboard.donedealpro.com/boards/showthread.php?t=65716) on plot points.  

Mazin explains in the thread that he believes structural mechanics are fine for analyzing screenplays, but useless when you actually need to write something - that there is a huge difference between reading/analyzing and writing. He laid out his own method, based around the concept of a Central Dramatic Argument. I find stuff like this gold; while I think the various guru-methods do have their uses in learning to analyze stories, I think learning from actual, successful screenwriters trumps them any day. 

Anyway, without further ado:  


&gt;I begin with questions.

&gt;What is my central dramatic argument? What's the point of the movie?

&gt;How can I show my character in conflict with that in the beginning? How can I make it interesting? Real? Honest? Funny? Broad? Scary? (whatever the tone of the piece demands)

&gt;What would be a dramatically satisfying ending for that character? Who else in his or her life is meaningful?

&gt;Now... what's the most difficult journey from A to B? How can I season that journey with pitfalls and turns? How can I lead them astray, challenge them, tempt them, taunt them, scare them? How can the world they're in change and inform them? How will the other characters instruct them, confront them, fail them, betray them?

&gt;I don't worry about page counts, counting ""plot points"" or any of that nonsense. There are no plot points to me. There are sequences imbued with meaning to the character.

&gt;There are movements that connect theme to character to narrative to relationships.

&gt;I don't care what page any of this **** happens on. That just falls into place once you start thinking about your structure in terms of what your character's true development is over the course of your narrative. I don't care how many things happen. I don't care about nonsense ""pinch points"" or ""middle of the movie revelation"" or any of that crap.

&gt;I just work on torturing my character toward perfection.

&gt;That's my job. I'm God. I'm doing this to my character because the idiot needs me to. It's going to hurt. I want him to curse me, then consider that I might be on to something, then trust me, and finally become me.


And further on...


&gt;The importance of this (CDA) isn't pedagogical. We're not lecturing the audience. The importance is that this argument HELPS US FIGURE OUT WHAT TO WRITE AND HOW.

&gt;What should the hero do in the end?

&gt;Why?

&gt;And it's important and interesting because?

&gt;What's the right trap to force him to become something more than he was?

&gt;What kind of ""more""?

&gt;What was his problem to start with?

&gt;Once you understand that the CDA of Nemo is ""parents must let their children go,"" you understand why:

&gt;1. It was a GOOD CHOICE to kill Marlin's wife and all his kids but one.
&gt;2. It was a GOOD CHOICE to make Nemo handicapped.
&gt;3. It was a GOOD CHOICE to pair Marlin with a character who can't remember anything.
&gt;4. It was a GOOD CHOICE to have Marlin find Nemo *before* the actual climax.
&gt;5. It was a GOOD CHOICE to create a climax in which the protagonist only had one single thing to do, which was allow Nemo to actually do the heroics.

&gt;These good choices aren't there because they're fun or exciting, although they are. They are there because they specifically reinforce Marlin's progression from someone who believes parents should *never* let their children go, into someone who believes they *must* EVEN AT THE RISK OF DEATH.

&gt;Everything in the movie, literally everything, flows from the central dramatic argument. I'll argue that Pixar movies do this without fail, each and every time, in an incredibly consistent manner.

&gt;Point being: I don't point this out so we can all pull our puds while diagramming movies in a brand new way.

&gt;I point this out because this will help you WRITE a movie with intention and structure related to DRAMA and CHARACTER and PHILOSOPHICAL INTENTION as opposed to MECHANICS and EXPECTATIONS and CONVENTION.


So, what I take from that is finding a theme, and being able to put it in the form of a dramatic argument that you can work towards, is what will help you write an engaging story. So something like ""friendship"" or ""hope"" is not a CDA - it should be a statement, your position on something.

I hope to go from getting to know the craft to having my first script finished a year from now. I am not dependent on screenwriting to earn a living thus I can spend time learning from this subreddit, books, classes etc without the additional pressure of churning something out quickly. I figured if I put myself out there and tell as many people as possible what I am trying to do, I would be held accountable to deliver. This post is a form of self-motivation. I hope to come back to it in Nov 2013 and talk about my first finished script. 

As some additional background, I am turning 35 in a few months and make a decent living working relatively long hours, which makes me feel like this whole endeavor might just be a pipedream. But it will become a reality. 

Thanks for reading. 

EDIT (Dec 10th 2012): Just finished reading ""rebel without a crew"" and am certainly motivated. As everyone keeps saying... your first script is going to be crap.. well.. i am still going to bust my ass on it and not only will i write it i will produce, edit and direct it. If nothing else i'll have something to show for it at the end and it may just make me a better scriptwriter. Going to budget 10 to 20 grand for now..

My name is Rob, known 'round these parts as TomHagen. I post some of [my analysis and beat sheets](http://screenplayhowto.com) from time-to-time. I'm helping out my friend, Dan, from Act Four. He's hosting a Writers Store webinar on Christopher Nolan films this Wednesday. I'm a big fan of Dan's Story Maps method. If you guys know my site, I use his method for my beat sheets. He's knowledgable guy -- I'm positive the webinar will offer an insightful look into some of Nolan's films.

[Here's some info on the webinar](http://www.writersstore.com/story-mapping-the-films-of-christopher-nolan/).

Dan talked with the folks over at the Writers Store and they agreed to give out 5 free seats to r/Screenwriting. For a chance to win, all you gotta do is send Dan an email tell him why your favorite Nolan film is *your favorite Nolan film*. It can be as simple as a paragraph if you want. He won't share your email with anybody or SPAM you. You guys have been good to both of our sites and this is a small way to say thanks.

Here's Dan's email: storymapsgreatscreenplay@gmail.com

Oh, one last thing: Make sure you put ""NOLAN-WEBINAR"" in the subject line.

Thanks!

Congratulations!  You have a chance to join the greatest writing group ever devised.  Kudos you!

This writing group is not like others.  This group isn't a social club, and it's not a venue for navel-gazing and notes.  This is a group that's about discipline and providing you with the tools that will guarantee the completion of your script.

The group will meet on Sundays at 7:00 @ the Stir Crazy coffee shop (6903 Melrose Ave, 90038).

Our first meeting will be a meet and greet this Sunday (July 15th), so you can stop by and see if the group, the people, and the concept are to your liking.

The rules are simple:

1.  Once the group starts, each member owes five pages of their draft by Thursday at noon.  Preferably, these pages will all be sequential and related to one project.
2.  Each member is responsible for reading everyone else's pages by the meeting.
3. Should a member fail to meet their obligations, they owe the group a pizza.

The purpose of the group and the rules are to ensure that everyone has a carrot to motivate them (discipline and a captive audience for their imagined world) and a consequence for failing.  Skill level here is less important than in other groups, as the principal purpose is to keep people motivated, productive, and on task.

MEMBERS SO FAR:

Matt, who has worked at Creative Artists Agency and at Platinum Studios (Cowboys and Aliens).  He's been a script reader for 9 years and is a WGA member who's sold two scripts. 

Supriya, who is the Director of Acquisitions at Film Festival Flix.

If you're interested, come to the introductory meeting at Stir Crazy.  For more information, contact mattjlazarus@gmail.com.",,False,self,t5_2qupf,False,,,True,t3_wc4a6,http://www.reddit.com/r/Screenwriting/comments/wc4a6/im_starting_a_screenwriting_group_there_will_be/,

So after working in script development for a while now, I can say that this document is 100% accurate. I've read literally hundreds of submissions -- all scripts that come from agents representing their writers (production companies NEVER read an unsolicited submissions). And the more you read, the easier it becomes to dismiss people's work based on quick judgements. 

A bad first impression can SINK a screenplay. Rarely have I read a script that I ended up liking after its dreary, frustrating first few pages.

How do you make a good first impression, you ask? Do NOT let these ""pet peeves,"" the marks of amateur (or overconfident) writers, plague your story. Let your characters and story speak for themselves. The LESS your writing tries to do, the MORE your story is free to do. 

Read this article and adhere to its wisdom. I've seen each of these ""pet peeves"" time after time. And 90% of the time, the bad screenplays are the ones that feature them.


***EDIT***

After reading numerous comments, I feel like I should say, obviously, there are exceptions to the rules. Notice I said **90% of the time** in the post.

As takeheed pointed out in his comment, though, if you are an unknown writer, you absolutely SHOULD NOT use these things. Readers will look for any excuse to dismiss an unknown writer's submission. Don't give the reader any reason to pass beyond whether or not he or she likes your story. 

Like it or not, if your story is amazing but you did something to piss a reader off early on, he or she may breeze through the thing as quick as possible and write it off as a pass. Readers are opinionated and easily offended (judging from the comments, we're all readers ;) )

I've been thinking a lot about writing a comedy sitcom script, and so for starters I have bought a small A5 book to write down any funny things I can think of (situations, dialogue, jokes etc.). These normally come into my head during the day - I write them on my phone - and then when I get home I write them in my book.

After a little bit of research, I have heard that before writing a script you should write a 'bible' containing; character descriptions, settings etc., and I plan to do this once I'm comfortable that my A5 book has enough to push into a script.

However, after reading a few scripts on Reddit, it has occured to me that I don't know a single thing about writing a script. For example, in a few scripts that I've read, I've come across ""(Beat)"" in the script, and I haven't got a clue what it means.

So my question to you is; Do you have any decent guides to read for total beginners to scriptwriting?

And if you have any further tips to throw at me, the more the better :)

I know that it is ridiculous to think that anything will happen with this idea before I have any kind of experience. My question is - is it possible to write and submit specs and so forth (to gain experience in writing) to American shows while living in Australia? My show idea is Australian in nature and I would want it to be made in Australia, but I feel I would have more chance getting anywhere if I have feedback and so on from American TV people. Is this ridiculous? Should I focus more on Australian producers/whoever if that's where I want to head eventually?

If you need a screenwriting partner, look here!",21,2,12,http://www.reddit.com/r/Screenwriting/comments/uxezx/im_looking_for_other_beginners_to_learn_with/,"UPDATE: I've found two great partners and am looking for a few more. Please continue to message me and let's get this ball rolling.

I'm looking for a partner so that I can learn and progress more efficiently as a screenwriter. A little about me:

- Graduating from college very soon and starting a full time job right after
- Passionate about film since young age but only recently decided to take the plunge into screenwriting
- I've read two screenwriting books and written a (shitty) half of my first feature length
- Friendly, outgoing, highly motivated in both personal and professional endeavors, and have been told I'm a great team mate

As for what I'm looking for a partner, I'm looking for a team mate with the right attitude. I want someone who is excited about learning and mastering the craft, and not just someone looking to write a script and get famous. I want someone who is willing to keep in touch on a consistent basis and is fun to talk to and get along with. Someone who reads scripts regularly and also keeps a half decent writing schedule. I'm a strong believer in practice makes perfect, and that natural talent will always get overshadowed by mindset and hard work. And also, I live in LA, so if we have great synergy then we can always meet up and hang out, have weekend writing sessions, etc.

Basically, I'm trying to get into screenwriting seriously and I want to find a partner that is also a novice so that we can talk about the craft, motivate each other, give honest feedback on each others work,  and overall just find another person who loves watching and writing film. We would keep in contact over e-mail, skype, text, whatever mediums as long as we are a good fit both personally and artistically.

Please private message me if you want to grow as a screenwriter and need a partner!

Edit: Really appreciate the upvotes, thanks a bunch. Still looking! Someone private messaged me asking about my previous experience with screenwriting so I'll save everyone's time and post it here:

I went to UCLA for the Film Program but I didn't know how hard it was to get in (15 people per year, can only apply your third year). I've since pursued another degree. I think graduation and securing a job after college has finally given me ""permission"" to fully dive into screenwriting. I started around 3 months ago, have read Save the Cat and Syd Field's Screenplay. I also have a little background already from the Film classes I took my first two years at UCLA, including a screenwriting class based on Walter's Screenwriting book.

I've also written around 40 pages of my first feature length, which I axed about a month ago because I realized that I couldn't approach it in this manner. Since then, I've just been analyzing films, reading scripts, and forming my game plan. Finalizing this game plan is actually the reason I decided to make this thread, because now I feel like I have a methodical way about improving and I want a partner to go back and forth with. I haven't been screenwriting for long/haven't accomplished much, but I have a strong work ethic and am going to be taking this very seriously.",,False,self,t5_2qupf,1339489066.0,,,True,t3_uxezx,http://www.reddit.com/r/Screenwriting/comments/uxezx/im_looking_for_other_beginners_to_learn_with/,

FEET - What do they look like? Family history. Where have they lived? Factual details.

GROIN - What do they want? How does their sexuality manifest itself? What are their base wants? Impulses?

HEART - What do they need? What do they need that will make them a better person?

THROAT - How do they sound? How do they project themselves? How do others see them? What's their surface vibe?

LEFT CHEEK - What is their intelligence? How does it manifest itself? How do they problem solve?

RIGHT CHEEK - What's their idealistic/artistic capacity? Conscience, morality.

CROWN - Defining memories? Pathology? Who is this person? Put them together here.

Tonight -- 07-31-13 Any and everyone should meet here and we all get a random premise and a random word. We then have 60 minutes to write a 3-5 page script with as few or as many characters as you like. The finished scripts are then uploaded to scribd.com and the links posted (as a new comment) back here.

Scripts will be the posted in the order they are finished.

To keep things honest the script should begin, end, and more or less be about the random topic and include the random word. 

Beyond that, anything goes. There is no prize except the satisfaction of completing the challenge and having a nifty short film or scene. 

Since we all have the same premise and the same limitations, it's truly up to you how bad or good the script turns out.

This post will be updated with the random word and topic after they are selected. See you then!

**UPDATE #1 10:45pm EST** About to get started. Quick note, I keep the comments sorted by newest, so I see those first. At 11pm will start asking for choices in the random selection (usually picking a number or random word). Be sure to refresh this page in case I pick you. Thx! 

**UPDATE #2 11p EST** Making random selections now, standby...

**UPDATE # 3 11:10 EST** Time starts at quarter past the hour. We have 60 minutes to write a 3-5 page script based on **this article:** http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2013-07-31/apple-s-cook-meets-china-mobile-chairman-to-discuss-cooperation.html (selected in google news, section 4, article 11)

When your done upload the script to scribd.com and post the link *as a new comment.* 

Other than that, anything goes (*don't forget the phrase, it's the number 1 mistake*). **Timer starts at 11:15pm.** Good writing!

You have until **THURSDAY APRIL 11TH** to submit your completed screenplays to the 2013 r/Screenwriting Screenplay Contest.

*[Original announcement post with full submission details is [HERE](http://www.reddit.com/r/Screenwriting/comments/1a32wd/announcement_rscreenwriting_screenplay/)]*

Email your pdfs (with personal information removed, as per the rules in the announcement post), to redditscreenwriting2013@gmail.com.

The contest is entirely **free to enter**, and the prize is a ticket to [The Great American PitchFest](https://pitchfest.com/) (worth $275) -- so there's no excuse for not entering. There are almost 13,000 of you, and we have about a dozen entries so far. (As an aside: - it's still worth entering even if you can't get to Pitchfest this year - Bob has said you can defer your ticket until next year, or even donate it to another winner who is able to go).

A post by last year's winner about his experience at Pitchfest is in the original announcement link.

The contest is open to **any finished screenplay** of any (reasonable) length in any genre.

We're still looking for a couple of extra judges - so if you feel qualified, send me a PM.

You still have ten days! Good luck to all who have already entered - I'll be confirming your entries by email very soon.

If you have any questions at all, feel free to ask!

**EDIT:** -- I realise I should probably have posted this yesterday to avoid doing it on April 1st ...

**EDIT 2:** -- By request, here's a list of the scripts we've received so far (as of now, 11pm UK time): - *'Gerry Buck Says Buck You', 'Blood Stains Red', 'Luka and Iso', 'Best Budz', 'Heart of a Lyon', 'The Dead', 'Death In The Family', 'Zoo', 'The Terrible Gennas', 'Fair Play', 'Eager/Or', 'Pretty Faces', 'Super Groovy', 'Press Start'.* I'll still be confirming that you've all properly anonymised the scripts soon, and I'll also send you all a proper email confirmation once we have all the entries in - just so we keep a log of everything and keep it all completely fair.",,False,self,t5_2qupf,1364853872.0,,,True,t3_1bf43i,http://www.reddit.com/r/Screenwriting/comments/1bf43i/reddit_screenwriting_contest_updatereminder/,moderator

More importantly, would I see feedback/ratings at all if I just opt for the $25 service? I can definitely afford the $75 service, but I don't want to spend more than I should.

Assuming I can dedicate 40hrs/wk to it, what do I need to be doing over the next 6 months to become a professional screenwriter?",27,9,62,http://www.reddit.com/r/Screenwriting/comments/10r5yf/im_considering_a_career_change_assuming_i_can/,"I may be losing my job, but have stock-options and severance so finding a new job isn't an immediate concern. If I were to change careers it would be to be as a screenwriter.

I've been a marketing communications manager (re: copywriter) for 7 years, have an M.A in Journalism. I've written - and gotten paid for - short narrative scripts, but only in conjunction with my established position. (i.e., I'm on salary.) I'm an indie filmmaker as well, currently working on co-producing a Latino coming of age film, and though I've edited the script, I didn't write it. So I know about shots, compositing, etc.  

What do I need to do *now* to make screenwriting a full-time, viable career option in 6-12 months? I may be able to devote a full 40hrs/wk to it for at least 3 months.  I currently live in Austin, Texas, though I am willing to relocate to NYC or Southern California (Southern cali preferred).  I'm also willing to consider going to film school.  University of Texas at Austin has a screenwriting MFA, but it takes two years, and they only accept 7 people per year.  

One program that looks interesting is the UCLA Professional Program in Screenwriting (Online.)  It can be done in an academic year, costs only $4500, and I do not have to relocate.  I may even be able to start immediately.  

http://www.filmprograms.ucla.edu/index.cfm?action=os_pps&amp;side=os

$4500 is CHEAP compared to a 2-year Masters program.  So, I'm interested in that, surely. 

To be specific, my goals are:

A) To be able to make at least $3500/mo before taxes screenwriting.  That's what I need to keep the mortgage paid, the belly full, and the parents happy I can visit them for Thanksgiving.  
B) To be eligible for WGA membership

Keep in mind, this is a *career change* first and foremost.  I don't have a ""great story I need to tell.""  Hell, I find I do much better when someone else has the story and they just want me to make it nice and gussy it up.  I think I'd do well doing book adaptations.  

-------------------

**UPDATE**

Okay, this plan isn't feasible.  Which is what I came to find out.  

My new plan is to finish up some things here in Austin, then in January, head to LA for three months to take the UCLA film production classes.  While there, I'll try to get some sort of internship or PA job or something, and take the classes at night.  I'll return to Austin on April 1, 2013, and re-evaluate my plans. Next September, I'll take the online screenwriting class, but with no other pretentions other than becoming a better, well-rounded filmmaker.

Now I'm seeing trailers for things like [At Any Price](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MnpRJKNhXzw) and [The Big Wedding](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bTGvnMQe9a4), both of which cram a shitload of content into their 2+minute trailers.

I saw *Admission* on Thursday, and it did the same thing, with the following storylines:

- Budding romantic relationship between Tina Fey &amp; Paul Rudd

- Ending romantic relationship between Tina Fey &amp; Martin Sheen (ended by another woman entering the picture)

- Maternal relationship between Tina Fey &amp; a kid who might be her child

- Rivalry between Tina Fey &amp; a co-worker, both after the same promotion

- Conflict between Tina Fey and her mother, with a whole lot of backstory delivered in two scenes

- Paul Rudd's relationship with his adopted son

I mean it was A LOT, and it's not the only recent movie to do it.  *The Incredible Burt Wonderstone* had the following plotlines:

- Steve Carell &amp; Olivia Wilde romantic subplot

- Steve Carell &amp; Steve Buscemi as old friends whose friendship falls apart and is rebuilt by the end

- Steve Carell &amp; Steve Buscemi's rivalry with Jim Carrey

- Steve Carell's mentor/mentee relationship with Alan Arkin

It, like *Admission,* seemed to go all over the place, touching on various plots that could have been entire movies unto themselves.  *Admission* did it somewhat successfully (but didn't balance comedy/drama as well as Woody Allen or Judd Apatow or Alexander Payne), but *The Incredible Burt Wonderstone* was a mess.

Just wanted to know if anyone else has noticed this.  It seems like a lot of films are attempting this kind of structure and failing to hit the mark -- falling short of the great ensemble pieces that actually manage to include multiple storylines with a sense of unity (like stuff by Guillermo Arriaga and PTA's *Magnolia.*)",,False,self,t5_2qupf,False,,,True,t3_1aujlr,http://www.reddit.com/r/Screenwriting/comments/1aujlr/too_many_plotlines_in_recent_films_anyone/,

Even if you don't remember the actual article (I don't expect anyone to), maybe someone knows who the writer was or a similar guide. I read at least half a dozen screenwriting books back then, and this little guide was my favorite.

It was an article in a film magazine of some sort. On the surface it was a cheesy ""How to write a screenplay in X days,"" or something like that, but it turned out to be full of solid advice. There were maybe two pages of the magazine devoted to it. The author's byline picture was a guy with a beard and thinning hair and I believe it was an artist's portrait, black &amp; white. Anyone know who that might be? Or does anyone know of a filmmaking magazine that had author's pictures drawn instead of photographed?

To that end, we host a variety of screenwriting panels, where aspiring writers can come to hear folks like Eric Roth, Tom McCarthy, Dan Harmon and others talk about the craft and the business. We also organize writing workshops for high school students and military veterans.

We're thinking about doing an AMA to talk about the various things we've learned from our many interactions with working writers. But we're unsure whether to post it here in r/screenwriting (where we feel it'll draw the most relevant audience) as opposed to r/AMA (which wouldn't necessarily be a bad idea, but it's less focused and we wouldn't want to get lost in the shuffle).

What does r/screenwriting think? Would that be something you guys would be into?

EDIT: In light of the [Woody Harrelson situation](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/p9a1v/im_woody_harrelson_ama/), we want to make totally clear that we'd honestly love to use the info we've gleaned to answer any questions you all might have about The Craft. This is a great community and we'd love to be a part of it, and to offer any insight we can that might be valuable.

1359470499.0,15,self.Screenwriting,17hw54,Am I in the right sub?,22,7,24,http://www.reddit.com/r/Screenwriting/comments/17hw54/am_i_in_the_right_sub/,"I just stumbled across this sub recently and I want to know if this is the right sub for someone like me. I'm just a standard 23 year old who loves to write. There's nothing special about me, I haven't written or sold a screenplay, I don't know anyone in the business, I don't have a college degree in writing or screenwriting, or anything like that, but it's been a passion of mine since I was very young. Now usually when I write it's in more of just 'regular' writing format, and not like a screenplay. Now lately (I say lately, but I really mean for some time now) I've been really wanting to write TV shows/cartoons/movies. 

My dream/goal is to write a sitcom styled TV show; like, *actually* write one. My best friend shares this very passion and is currently going to school for directing. Not to a 'top' school - or even a 'middle' one - but currently just to a community college now and then plans to attend a better one afterwards. He isn't great in a lot of things, and I say that as a friend, but he's darn good when it comes to *appreciating and understanding* movies - and what makes movies great. We've always shared the same (and IMO, great) taste in movies, but it wasn't until I sat down and watched movies with him and commentated on them, did I really notice this. 

Now I know everyone says that there's a bunch of crap on TV and that they could write a much better show given the chance and blah blah blah, everything like that, so I'm not even going to sit here and say that. But c'mon, *I can write a much better show than the crap that's on TV now!* 

All this being said, I decided to actually do something about it. He and I (starting about two years ago) sat down and just wrote. We came up with an idea for a show and all of the characters and relationships and plot lines drawn out for multiple episodes. I think all in all I came up with enough episodes for two complete seasons. We then wrote about 3-4 page synopses of each episode (in a very similar format/style to this post) and then walked away. We wrote this all in the span of about a week, and the whole time I was writing it, I felt like this was the funniest thing ever - and that's why I needed to just set it aside and walk away from it. I reread it about half a year later and hated *every. last. word.* of it. It was horrible.

So I rewrote it; changed characters, relationships, interactions, locations, keeping some things here and there. After awhile we looked it over again and... rewrote it again. We finally rewrote it a third time and absolutely loved it. It had glimpses of The Office, Seinfeld, IASIP, and Modern Family in it. I went back and looked it over after a couple of months and I actually still loved it, so I started to rewrite the pilot into a screenplay format. 

Last week, though, I woke up in the middle of the night and realized that I needed to rewrite it again. I had the main group of characters in their late 20s (27-28) but they were acting like 23 year olds. I had Guy 1 and Guy 2 living together in an apartment while Girl 1 (who Guy 1 is with) and Girl 2 (Girl 1's cousin) also lived together and I was never able to properly tie Guy 3 in to *anything*, quite honestly. So I made Guy 1 and Girl 1 married, and living together. I also made Girl 1 pregnant which gave me a reason for Girl 2 (who's now a mid wife) to come live with them. This then allowed me to make Guy 2 and Guy 3 live together, which helps me incorporate and solidify Guy 3 as a main  (or at least a supporting) character, instead of just a 'reoccurring' one. 

So I'm now currently *re*writing the screenplay for the pilot, which I'll put on here (or /r/ReadMyScript) for you guys to read and critique once I'm done with it.

1333660933.0,16,self.Screenwriting,rv92p,1sheets and one sheets.  Let's talk about them.,29,13,9,http://www.reddit.com/r/Screenwriting/comments/rv92p/1sheets_and_one_sheets_lets_talk_about_them/,"A few mentions about 1-sheets in the thread about pitchfests.  Apparently none of you have ever seen one.  This isn't surprising because they aren't commonly available.  As such, there is no set format for them.  So, much like treatments, you will be judged on your ability to generate one without having the faintest clue what you're going for.  Welcome to Hollywood, kid.

A truism of Hollywood, however, is that victory belongs to the bold.  I was unable to find any examples of onesheets three years ago so I set out to create my own.  [The one I'm sharing, in anonymized format, nearly got a graphic novel made.](http://i.imgur.com/iCy4w.jpg)  It's for a script that was commissioned by a production company (for enough money to make me ineligible for screenwriting contests, thank god) whose option has lapsed and which I'm currently converting to a novel, based on the advice and counsel of a NYT-bestselling author.  No you may not read the script or the novel, thanks for asking, I'm flattered, really I am.  I will, however, share with you my reasoning in creating its format; I have five more of these for other projects and have found it to be a useful tool.  One of them *did* lead directly to another option (which means the other four didn't, so take that into account).  Not only that, but if after writing one of these for the script you find *yourself* uncompelled by the 1-sheet, know that it isn't the 1-sheet.  It's the script.  Start over.

*  *   *  

A 1sheet, more than any other document you will be asked to generate as a screenwriter, is a **sales tool.** Think of it as if it were a resume for your script.  Think of it as a flyer for a condo.  Think of it as a playbill stuffed under your windshield wiper to get you to come out to some skanky rave.  The purpose is not to tell your target audience everything about your script, the purpose is to leave them wanting to read it.  

It must, therefore, be appealing, slick, and confident.  It must give your reader the impression you know what you're doing, you've written a kick-ass story, and at a bare minimum, they won't regret giving it (and you) an hour or two of their time.  Remember - anyone who actually has the power to nudge your script *an inch* closer to production is *buried* under screenplays.  You aren't in their stack yet.  This document you're about to craft is the tool you're going to use to shove yourself to the head of the line.  Keep that in mind: your goal is to step on the faces of several dozen other screenwriters as you scratch and claw your way to the top.  Now is not the time to be coy, now is not the time to be demure.  One foot in the gutter, one fist in the goal.

Hollywood is the uneasy intersection of art and commerce.  So is the 1-sheet.  You're telling a story about a story and you're doing it in such a way to indicate that untold riches lie in wait for those willing to believe in the tale you're about to tell.  As such, your language is not one of arcs, it is one of demographics.  It is not one of concepts, it is one of locations.  Theme does not matter.  Casting does.  The 1-sheet is where you take that long, hard look at your script and find all the marketable gems so that your reader doesn't have to.  Can't find any?  Start over.  You've written a script.  Congratulations.  **Now you have to sell it.**

Start with the title.  I put my company logo in the upper left because I do this on my stationery.  Everything I do I do on stationery because the stuff I send out is generally not the first thing people see from me.  May you be as lucky.  The big block, though, is the title.  

Know how you write everything in CourierFD?  Yeah, 1sheets aren't like that.  Now's a good time to pull out all the stops.  Somewhere there's a font that encapsulates your title.  I use dafont.com.  If the title card of your movie came up, what font would it be in?  Use that.  What, you haven't thought about it?  Bullshit.  You dream about it at night.  We all do.  

**This is the first place you can lose your audience.** Don't give them any excuses.

Below the title you put your logline.  Know all the tricks they tell you about coming up with a kick-ass logline?  Use them.  

**This is the 2nd place you can lose your audience.** Don't give them any excuses.

Immediately below is the paragraph synopsis.  Note that it leaves a lot of shit hanging.  Should you eradicate all mystery, your audience will stop reading.  This is your ""elevator pitch.""  I write this part before I even start outlining.  It's easier that way - if it's exciting in a paragraph it's that much more likely to be exciting in a feature.

**This is the 3rd place you can lose your audience.**  Don't give them any excuses.

So now you have their attention.  They've read your title, they've read your logline, they've read your synopsis and somehow, they're still here.  Now you give them a basic journey through the arc of the script - NO SPOILERS.  Again, you're giving them a taste and leaving them wanting more.  End on a teaser.  

**This is the 4th place you can lose your audience.** Don't give them any excuses.

Now we get into the sausage-making.  What kind of movie is this.  Where can you see it being shot.  Who is likely to be in it.  What other movies are like it.  PICK SUCCESSFUL MOVIES.  Nobody cares about your GATTACA-meets-SKY CAPTAIN crossover - both movies lost money hand over fist and if you seek to emulate them you will find no one wants to spend money on your ideas.  Many of my 1sheets contain guesses at budget - ""sag indie"" ""ultra-low-budget"" ""conventional studio budgets"" etc.  You likely don't know what your movie will cost but you know if it's a $10m or $100m film, don't you?

Below that is your contact info.  Don't put the WGA number or anything stupid like that.  Don't put ""available on request.""  Of course it is. Put your name (I don't, I have my company name - but then, I have a company and you may not) and a way for them to contact you.   Email address works fine.

Oh, yeah.  The picture.  The picture matters.  It's as close to a movie poster as you dare to get.  It should make a fair amount of sense in the context of what you've just written, but not so much that it's more than window dressing.  That image should encapsulate the basic ""vibe"" of the script.  You're selling a motion picture - use an image.  

*  *   * 

I can't emphasize this enough:  This is **A** format, not **THE** format.  You're probably better off doing something of your own.  This wasn't cribbed from a book, this wasn't cribbed from a production company.  This is something that the-powers-that-be have decided spec screenwriters need to come up with, so use some creativity and come up with your own.  You can probably beat the tar off of mine.  Give it a shot.  Be creative.  Use another font for once in your life and revel in it.

But it's just the story structure with a lot of placeholder dialog; and mainly, it's very joke-lacking. It needs an influx of jokes and punching up. (Other constructive criticism is welcome - it's just me writing down an episode idea).

Is it possible for just a few people to animate and voice an entire 22 minute sitcom?
Yes. [This is a sitcom](http://www.uni-form.co.uk/) produced by just five people (two really). Technically, it's complete and quite good. It would be TV quality- unfortunately it just isn't funny enough. Not that the jokes aren't funny, it just doesn't have enough jokes. Also the story is a little unbelievable. And it's not that sharp with its timing. But mainly, it just doesn't have that Joke Per Minute rate that keeps you watching. But it just shows you what you can do.

So, for our sitcom, I'd say each episode should:

1. Have separate story lines that eventually collide resulting in a mind-bendingly funny confrontation/situation at the end.

2. Have a high JPM (Joke Per Minute) rate (i.e. Big Bang Theory style, about one joke per two lines). They don't have to be super jokes, they can be just be
[simple gags](http://thedoghousediaries.com/comics/uncategorized/2012-01-25-ef4f1f8.png). But keeping them coming is the key. 

3. Be realistic - just like a live action show - it just so happens that it's animated. Think of any animated show (Family Guy, etc), compared to a live action show (i.e. Seinfeld). Let's make it like live-action, so it's very relatable.

So once we have that script written, we can put the script up on Kickstarter, with a plan.

How do we actually animate it?
Some stats:

- Each Community episode takes about $1 million dollars to produce. Can't do that!

- Each Simpsons, Futurama, Family Guy etc episode take 9-12 months to produce. That style of animation is quite expensive to make. Can't do that!

- One ""sitcom"" has cracked the code for cheap production though: It takes ten people less than one week to produce each South Park episode. But it looks a bit... childish.

- There's a nice middle ground with Archer ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archer_(TV_series) ) though. Each takes a couple of months to produce and look great.

- There are many [online](http://www.wreckamovie.com/) [efforts](http://studios.amazon.com/) to create movies, but not really any for sitcoms.

- Another possibility is to actually have it live-action, acted out by YouTube stars i.e. from [Maker Studios](http://www.nytimes.com/2011/04/11/business/media/11youtube.html?pagewanted=all). If it's a great script, then bam, them in front of greenscreens - the internet's first sitcom that's not awful!

- I say we find a nice middle ground of the animation. I quite like [this combo CG/drawn style](http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/537261515/least-i-could-do-the-pilot), similar to Futurama.

We can animate it. I've started [animating](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mrGIxv6Gq10) a [Futurama spec script](http://www.scribd.com/ben_joseph_11/d/62353876-Benjoseph-Futurama-Spec) I found, and it's do-able. (And much better with actual funding). So that's not the problem. Keeping the jokes coming and having a great story each episode is!

These are my inspirations:
[Seinfeld](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mX1hgyMGuAE),
[Curb your Enthusiasm](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZK1vNTjJWTU),
[Fawlty Towers](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXjwbzViN9M),

I had started reading scripts from http://script-o-rama.com when I was a junior in high school -- I first read DOGMA on there and loved the format.

In the end of 2000, I caught wind of the first Project Greenlight contest, and I hammered out my first screenplay in 12 days. I had read a few more scripts and tried to learn the Industry Standard Format as fast as I could. It was a fun process, but writing a feature in MS Word is a pain in the ass.

**Ninja Edit** Once I picked up Final Draft, everything was a lot easier.

Throughout film school, I wrote shorts and scenes for my projects, and usually hammered out the scripts for my friend's projects. After that, I've been contracted to write a few features. In the process I've had two features produced, and I'm working on building my career here in Hollywood.

But I think something where we are all participating in writing *and* critiquing would get more interest. 

What if we all decided on a short story in the public domain, then shared our own adapted scripts and workshopped them? 

It would give everyone a short-term goal that they could potentially keep for their portfolios, but the real benefit would be in discussing the choices each of us made. A winner could be chosen, though that would hardly be the point.

Any interest? 

**[Edit]**

**There's interest!** Okay, so a few common things have been brought up, so let's discuss.

1. I think length should be 5-20 pages. If we did full-length scripts, we'd get almost no participation, and most shorts are 5-15 minutes, anyway. 

2. A lot of people didn't realize that I meant for us to all adapt the same existing short story. I think this would be best for seeing the choices we all made as screenwriters with form, technique and creative choices, rather than as original storytellers and dialogue-writers. Speaking for myself, I would be most interested in doing this if we're literally adapting an existing story.

3. It has been suggested that people might steal each others' ideas if we do what I outlined above. This is a common fear amongst screenwriters in writing groups, but I suppose in this case it's much more warranted. If we're all adapting the same short story, and all sharing/workshopping them, second drafts across the board might start looking alike. In my opinion, we should be able to trust each other not to adopt the more *original* variances of other adaptations into our own. Besides, it would take one of us actually producing the short for that to matter anyway; however, if we're not considering actually doing something with our scripts, why use something in the public domain from Project Gutenberg?

4. So we could decide to adapt the same *non*-public domain story, making it a pure workshop, or

5. We could follow troublef's idea and all create original works based on the same basic story/setting/conflict outline that we make up as a group.

Flashback 10+ years ago. [The Angry Beavers](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Angry_Beavers) was a popular cartoon on Nickelodeon. One morning I decided I wanted to write a script for a new episode, even though I knew the show wasn't going to stay on the air forever. I wrote a script for a single 10 minute episode within a few hours that day and shared it with a friend, then forgot about the file for years until I was looking through my old hard drive. Reading it again, I think it's pretty funny and could have made a decent episode.

I'm thinking of maybe adapting it to something else since Angry Beavers was cancelled forever ago, but I can't think of another way to use it so I'm posting it here for review in hopes someone else could give me some feedback on it.

This ""rule"" also completely disregards messiah characters, such as Cool Hand Luke, who never undergo a character arc themselves but their actions inspire the other characters in the film to change.

Of course this is considered a ""rule"" because the majority of movies feature a main character who learns and grows throughout the course of the story, but it still bothers me that many people consider this to be the only way to approach creating a strong protagonist.

We need judges!,21,6,73,http://www.reddit.com/r/Screenwriting/comments/lg983/screenwriting_contest_update_and_discussion_we/,"So I requested to start a small silly screenwriting contest [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/Screenwriting/comments/leofq/would_anyone_be_interested_in_a_screenwriting/) but it quickly covered ground. User [MayorPoopenmeyer](http://www.reddit.com/r/Screenwriting/comments/leofq/would_anyone_be_interested_in_a_screenwriting/c2s7rnz) offered a reward of a ticket to [PitchFest](http://pitchfest.com/index.shtml) for next year for the winner on the grounds that it has to be a feature-length screenplay. It would only be the ticket to PitchFest so you would have to pay your own lodging and travel but it's not until next year so the winner could start saving early!

So far we've decided on it being open topic, any genre. We were going to choose a topic at first but the winner will get to pitch their idea so we figured it might as well be their best work. PitchFest is not until [June 2-3](http://www.reddit.com/r/Screenwriting/comments/lg983/screenwriting_contest_update_and_discussion_we/c2sgbfl) next year at the Marriott in Burbank, California.
 
So for a deadline I was thinking 8 weeks. If you think that's too short or too long please voice your opinion.**EDIT**: The crowd favorite seems to be 12 weeks. I'll leave it like that for now.

For judging we wanted at first to post all the scripts anonymously somewhere and have the community vote on them but that might not be the smartest move. So I think we're set on a panel of judges alongside MayorPoopenmeyer who will read the scripts and possibly use a simplified version of [Script Coverage](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Script_coverage) to judge them.
  
 We'll need a way for the judges to choose the winner easily. Maybe they can each read a few and chose their favorite, share it amongst each other and choose one from all those. I don't think they would be interested in reading all the scripts. We also need to decide how many judges we would have. I'd prefer if the judges were established writers if we could find some or someone in the film making business.  
  
I think that's all so far. Please post suggestions, requests to be a judge in the comments, tips or info on how to be safe with your material. Pm me if you have any more questions. You can reach MayorPoopenmeyer at bob@pitchfest.com if it's important but he's busy this week at a screening for his film(wish him luck). So let's discuss this and get the ball rolling!

**EDIT**: I'm debating Xposting this to r/writing and r/movies. It would gather a lot more attention but it might make it unmanageable. What do you think? I xposted to r/ReadMyScript and r/Filmmakers already. EDIT: I've xposted to r/writing.

**EDIT 2**: I think it would be alright if you submitted a script you've already written so long as it has not garnered any awards. What's your opinion?

**SO FAR** it seems it's going to be 12 weeks. 90-120 pages seems to be the agreed amount but they're not definitive. A panel of 5 judges sounds good. So far we have the host of our prize and two other volunteers have stepped up. I'll run them by our judge. I think the preferred method would be in a pdf format. You can use celtx, freeware, to write your script. I'll most likely have the official starting date this friday or monday it all depends on how quick I can gather the rest of the judges and if I can gather more prizes. If you know of any companies that would be willing to donate software or something similar as a prize let me know. I will keep everyone posted. Thank you.

**UPDATE** So we got a runner up prize of a judge running consultation on your screenplay and providing notes so far. I'm in the process of looking for something else. I'm going to crosspost this to r/movies and see if we can grab some more folks. I will keep you all updated!

  
**UPDATE2** Nothing new to report as of Sunday 10/23. I'm still waiting on some emails. I'll be doing a X-post to r/movies on Monday. Get your brainstorming and your character sheets or whatever you use to help you write ready. I want this thing started by the end of the week.

**UPDATE3** Hi guys. I hope everyone is still interested. I'm having a busy week but I'm still working hard on trying to contact everyone!

So, here's the story. A person I know, henceforth referred to as Idea Guy, came up with a concept for a TV show he wanted written. He is not a writer and approached me about helping him out. Being interested in the idea and wanting to be involved, I wrote a TV pilot and registered it with the Writers Guild under my name (I have a ""written by"" and ""story by"" credit while Idea Guy has a ""story by"" credit)

Through random providence, a director got his hands on it, loved it, and now wants to work with us on making it. The director is known in Hollywood, so he'll be the one putting together the package and shopping it to networks. Since my name carries zero weight, he's also looking to attach a name writer to the project to better sell it and says he has several candidates lined up. He's asked me to sign a ""standard writer's contract"" with Idea Guy from whom director will also obtain Chain of Title.

The contract he's put together is titled ""Screenwriter Work-For-Hire Agreement"" and is to be an agreement between myself and Idea Guy. I'd like to sign it, but it has some clauses in it that worry me.

In the clauses below, Idea Guy is referred to as Producer. I am, of course, the Writer.

Clause 1: *Conditioned upon Writer’s full performance of his/her obligations hereunder, Producer shall pay Writer, as full compensation for all services rendered and rights granted, fixed compensation in the amount of FIVE HUNDRED CAD DOLLARS (CAD $500), payable upon execution of this Agreement. The Writer acknowledges that as of the signing of this agreement, the Writer has been compensated in full and has no other monetary claims against the Producer.*

Clause 2: *Writer acknowledges and agrees that the results and proceeds of Writer's services hereunder and any and all material, works, writings, ideas, gags, or dialogue or other matter written, composed, prepared, submitted, suggested or interpolated by Writer in connection with the Picture, or its preparation or production (collectively, the Material), shall automatically become the exclusive property of Producer as a “work made for hire"" as defined by United States copyright law and Canadian Copyright Law. Producer shall, for copyright and all other purposes, be deemed the sole author thereof and shall have the right to obtain copyright therefor and for the Picture in its own name or otherwise, and to renew such copyrights, in its own name and for its own benefit or otherwise, free of any claims thereto by Writer.*

Clause 3: *Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, in the event Writer's services hereunder, for any reason, are deemed not to be a “work made for hire” under the United States and Canada copyright law, Writer acknowledges and agrees that by the terms hereof, Writer hereby irrevocably grants, sets over and assigns to Producer throughout the universe, exclusively and in perpetuity, free and clear of any and all claims, liens and encumbrances, all right, title and interest of every kind whatsoever, whether now known or unknown, in and to the Material and all other results and proceeds of Writer's services hereunder.*

First off, Idea Guy is not actually paying me any money. That was an arbitrary number he threw in there because he felt ""we needed to put something down"". The work was done for free in the hopes that it would help us break into Hollywood where we might be able to kickstart new careers (me as a writer, him as an actor).

Secondly, I'm concerned that signing an agreement with these clauses included would mean I'd forfeit all my rights to this work, and therefore, any additional writing fees (as mandated by the Writers' Guild) in the event a studio decides to go forward with the project. I was told by the director that because I have ""written by"" and ""story by"" credits to my name, I'm protected in that regards, but I want to be 100% sure. While the ultimate goal is to get a job working on this project, should it be produced, I'd also like to receive some compensation for all the work I've put in.

Does anyone have any experience with this? Can you tell me if these clauses will screw me? And if so, does anyone have alternative language I can use that would better protect me?

Thanks in advance! I appreciate any advice you guys can give.",,False,self,t5_2qupf,False,,,True,t3_1iobjz,http://www.reddit.com/r/Screenwriting/comments/1iobjz/need_advice_about_signing_contract_please_help_me/,

I've taken a few screenwriting classes in college and I always received contradicting advice with this, as well as other things. Truth be told, some of these classes were focused on film screenwriting, as opposed to TV script writing. However, I'm currently trying to transform a film I've previously written into a TV series that way I would have more time to carefully mold the story.

Anyway, I was never given a conclusive answer about using the word ""then"" in action blocks. My TV script writing teacher suggested that I remove every single ""then"" that I included in my scripts simply because they don't deliver the point in the swiftest manner. While I understand her point, I always found that the word ""then"" (along with many other words) allows the writer to explain two actions in one sentence or can simply make the sentence sound better. This is opposed to what my teacher preferred, which is using multiple sentences to explain action in a rather bland, yet simple manner.

My other teacher for film screenwriting never originally mentioned the use of the word ""then"" and when I asked her, she said it was fine to use. I tended to use it quite often in my action and I much preferred the style to my other teacher's.

So there's my question. I just really want a solid answer on this that way I can make my script as perfect as possible. Below are some examples of how I use the word. While there are sometimes simple ways to remove the word ""then,"" other times it proves to be unique and useful:

ex 1) He holds a book labeled ""The finale in Appomattox."" He skims through many pages THEN starts reading.

ex 2) Cole is interrupted by the loud yelping of a man outside, yet he is unfazed by it and continues reading. He hears it again, THEN looks up.

ex 3) 
The man laughs a little, THEN begins yelling aggressively as he launches powerful punches at Cole, hitting him several times in the chest and face. The man charges his massive body at Cole, relentlessly swinging.

Cole blocks the first with his forearm, THEN dodges the second. He ducks below the third punch, sending the man's fist clashing hard against the wall.

TL;DR
As you can see in the few examples above, I like using the word ""then"" in action blocks to combine multiple actions into one sentence. One of my teachers said this was wrong because it doesn't ""get right to the point,"" and the other said it was fine to use. So can I?

Edit: Also, I've capitalized each ""then"" that way you guys could easily recognize it. Obviously, they aren't capitalized like that in the original script, lol",,False,self,t5_2qupf,False,,,True,t3_1hdr01,http://www.reddit.com/r/Screenwriting/comments/1hdr01/question_about_using_the_word_then_in_action/,

I believe the issue was that he didn't have full rights to the story because of the input from others.

If someone posts a script here, gets input, and rewrites based on that, does the author still maintain full rights? Where is the line drawn? Does it depend on the T&amp;C of the site?

Edit to add:
&gt;Techdirt reported that due to Reddit's licensing terms, Erwin may not have had full ownership of the story he wrote, and may not have been able to fully transfer those rights to Warner Brothers.[2] Concerns were raised due to Erwin's creation of the story in the Reddit forums occurring with and through participation and input from other Reddit users. The issues then became those of whether or not Erwin actually had the right to grant exclusivity to Warner, and that Reddit itself may own rights to those portions of the story created and shared on their website. While the concept of modern military forces involving themselves in conflicts with less advanced cultures is a common theme in science fiction, in order to claim exclusivity, Erwin may be required to rewrite the story to remove those portions created through input of Reddit users.[2][10][11]
Reddit have since made a statement that the licensing terms are there to protect them from potential legal action and that they do not intend to block the production of the movie.[12]

Even if the pages are rough, I feel they have potential and get across what I'm trying to get across.

But then -- maybe a few days later -- as I continue to edit the pages, I no longer feel optimistic. My writing feels stale and lazy. I find myself wanting to rewrite entire chunks just to mix things up. 

And so I've been wondering...is this something other people notice about themselves as well, or am I entirely alone in this? 

Do I feel this way as a result of viewing my pages with the hardened eye of an editor who realizes what he's reading isn't actually that good?

Or do I feel this way simply because the novelty has worn off?

I only ask because how I should react to this feeling depends on what's causing it. If my pages suck, and I only realize it until a few days have passed to think it over, it's in my best interest to rewrite them. If they only seem to suck, then changing them completely might be unnecessary or even harmful to the script.

I'll start:

While reading a script I co-wrote which desired some additional conflict, someone mentioned giving the main character a roommate he is competing against or trying to impress would solve the problem.

Although I'm no expert, I do believe writers can start adding characters to the story for the sake of filling up a few holes without understanding the consequences. Characters are far more complex than scenarios or deadlines. Sure, a roommate could add some conflict with the main character, but it's also a sticky mess (like giving birth, for instance). Now I would have to consider the ROOMMATES wants and needs within the story, along with adequate moments of exposition. That is already taking up a lot of space in my narrative and I haven't even reached the conflict yet! A character brought in for the hell of it (similar to a roommate) may only add more fat to trim later. Plus, a conflicting roommate can limit the age range of characters and can turn into a huge student film cliche. 

Don't get me wrong, an added character CAN add dynamics to the relationships your character has. But always make sure you consider the totally different reality being created once that character is born. 

tl;dr a character should have a greater purpose than filling in one problem with the story",,False,self,t5_2qupf,False,,,True,t3_wjk8y,http://www.reddit.com/r/Screenwriting/comments/wjk8y/what_is_the_worst_character_advicefeedback_youre/,

1. We are a brand new company. You will not any find any information on us online. Our website is set to launch within the next few weeks.
2. Feature length screenplays are preferred over shorts or treatments.
3. Every submission will be read. Sending the same work in multiple times will not change our verdict.
4. If you do not hear from us within a few weeks, do not resubmit your work until you have done significant revisions. 
5. If you do resubmit your work, make sure you indicate the draft version on your screenplay.

I read a lot of scripts. I will probably read some of your submissions. Here are my tips:

* 90 pages is a good length for a screenplay. If it's longer than 90, make damn sure that every extra page is crucial! Most 120 page screenplays have 30 pages of nothing happening! 
* The fate of your submission rests in the hands of an unpaid intern. If said intern thinks your work is good enough, it is passed on to the 'higher ups'. DO NOT PISS OFF THE INTERN! Although we strongly recommend that our interns read the entire screenplay before judging it, they have absolutely no incentive to do so. If they are distracted by your page-long run-on-sentences and spelling errors, THEY WILL NOT READ FURTHER THAN PAGE 10! If he/she does not like you, they will heartlessly decimate your best shot at making it into Hollywood! So proof-read your work, and keep our interns happy :)

I post a lot of shit and I get a lot of shit back but during that time, every subreddit has always had a balance to it.

There are subs that have certain loyalist fans, like a sport club sub for example. Those who tend to disagree and those who are there just to make jokes with very little contribution. However, there's always a strong backbone that pushes that sub forward. I'm not talking your shitty /r/funny or /r/adviceanimals. I mean the smaller and more articulate subs like /r/steampunk which is split between really bitter people who don't consider almost anything steampunk and those who make amazing pieces of art, much to everyone else's joy.

The point of this rant is simple: This subreddit, amongst the smaller and more artistic communities, is one of the most bitter, angry and downright whiny subs I've ever come across. The large chunk of what get's contributed here is people moaning about how this is not up to their standards or how they were ""scarred"" by this awful film. How this film caused the end of the world and how that script made their eyes bleed. As a fellow screenwriter, having to come in to see how my peers are living their lives, it's quite frankly depressing. I found myself thinking ""I want to say something but I know they'll probably deconstruct and then hate that as well"".

This sub is for screenwriters. There's a joy in our jobs. We make up worlds and we dictate what happens in those worlds. Yes, there's always going to be people who input our works but that doesn't mean that at some point, we all didn't sit down at our desks and write down what we felt via our characters. Write down concepts and scenes we thought up when we were kids and movies were the coolest fucking thing in the world to us.

Did one of these yesterday and it was too much fun. 

Today, 07-18-13, any and everyone should meet here and we all get a random premise and a random word. We then have 60 minutes to write a 3-5 page script with as few or as many characters as you like. The finished scripts are then uploaded to scribd.com and the links posted back here. 

To keep things honest the script should begin, end, and more or less be about the random topic. 

There are no rules beyond that. And there is no prize beyond the experience of the challenge.

I just don't know if I could follow through with writing a screenplay that portrays, say, my father, in a negative way. He's not a bad guy, but there are things he did that affected me negatively. And to any of my family members, it would be glaringly obvious that I was writing about him. That would definitely be a big blow to his feelings.

How do you deal with that? I believe writing from the heart is important. But I also can't imagine what it would be like to portray someone close to you in a negative light and then confront them afterwards (if they read your screenplay or it was produced).

This is one final reminder for you guys, that the deadline for the Reddit Screenwriting Contest 2013 is **TOMORROW NIGHT** (Thursday 11th April, 11:59pm).

I will email a receipt to everyone who has already submitted theirs, as soon as the deadline passes. 

(If you've submitted, and haven't received a receipt-email by Friday afternoon (GMT), then send a message to redditscreenwriting2013@gmail.com and I'll make sure nothing's gone wrong.)

As far as judging is concerned, we could *still* do with more judges. (I'm a little disappointed that nobody else has come forward, but it can't be helped). So we've created a system that'll be fair for everyone. 

**All the scripts will be read in full.** From Friday morning, I will be collating a shortlist of the best submissions. Bob will then go through this shortlist, and find his top-3. We'll then compare our scores and rankings, and then discuss any differences properly, before coming to a final decision.

* **1st prize** is the free ticket to [Pitchfest](https://pitchfest.com/)! (I'll inform the winner by email before posting the results here, giving them details on how to claim it.)

* **2nd and 3rd prize** will be a few pages of free coverage on your script. Hopefully explaining why it didn't quite win, perhaps areas to improve, and how best to continue with it. 

I'll be dedicating a large proportion of the next fortnight to reading and scoring them all (we have 23 so far, and I'm expecting more), so you'll have to bear with me. I may post another update once we've collated the shortlist, just to keep you informed of how things are going.

Unfortunately, not all scripts will get free coverage. If it's something you desperately want, then I'm sure we can sort something out - but I simply don't have time to write decent-length reports on all of them. (We're doing this for free, after all.)

However - I *will* be posting a round-up of all the scripts when we announce the winners. I'll go through the various criteria we used for judging - hopefully point out any common mistakes, any areas where lots of people fell down, hints and tips for next time, etc. That way, I hope everyone will benefit in some way from entering.

I think that's it. 

Deadline is tomorrow! We're looking forward to reading them! 

Good luck!

**EDIT 1:** -- We have one more volunteer for judging, which should make things faster and easier. If anyone else is qualified and interested, give me a PM.

**EDIT 2:** -- And we have another judge! Thanks guys. The judges names will be available when we post the results.

**EDIT 3:** -- More judges! And 29 entries so far!

As I was writing it I noticed the huge discrepancy between pure story they advocate and the absolute bollocks you see in cinemas at the moment.  I didn't care.  Fuck Hollywood.  I just wrote a story that I thought was interesting and imagined shit I wanted to see.

So a few non-pro tips:

Just write a version.  Then rewrite it.  I outlined about twenty different versions to get to the one I liked.

Dialogue was 'on the nose' for the first few passes but when you rewrite you can make it subtle and add subtext.  Don't fret that it's bad on the first few tries.

Themes change as you rewrite so don't let that be a block.

After a few print outs change the font for 'fresh eyes.'

It sometimes gets to the point where the writer wants to make the movie themself. Some of them outright mention it'll be their first short, but I'm guessing there's a whole lot more that neglect to mention it.

So what's the deal? No doubt some of their ideas might be good, but I see parody as a lazy effort. It gives the filmmaker free license to use every tired cliched story element in the book. And if someone doesn't like it, they can just point the finger back and say, 'maybe you just didn't get it'. 

Wouldn't they rather make something original that stands on its own merit, not something that needs an entire genre or sub-genre's worth of context?

Just in my head, I see it starting out with some light introductions to the characters that establish the environment coupled by some tension.  Then the inciting incident, and then focusing on one or two characters rather than trying to show absolutely everyone and flesh everyone out.

If you fail to meet either obligation, you owe the group coffee. It's simple and fun. It's a tough pace to work at, but by joining, you'll gain discipline, a reason for writing, an audience, and kickass notes from some awesome redditors.

In the 13 weeks since we've launched, our members have completed three first draft screenplays and one TV spec.  All of us say that the group has made us more efficient than we've ever been before.

On weekends and freelance jobs, I have a professional crew that I have assembled over the last 10 years.
I've been assembling some short film shoots but my main contact list of directors/writers/creatives have mostly all moved to LA and Austin ([Paul Cummings](http://www.youtube.com/user/Tetriscide?ob=0&amp;feature=results_main), [MysteryGuitarMan](http://www.youtube.com/user/mysteryguitarman?ob=4&amp;feature=results_main), [Michelle Millette](http://vimeo.com/user367205), and [Ryan Morrison](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hLNcb_ls8p0)).
I have technicians around me that want to work with me as crew, however,  **none of use are writers** and only a few of us are visually creative enough to be commercial directors.
We have a steadicam owner/operator, Assistant Camera/B cam, [VFX guru](http://www.thufford.com/), [Nuke/Roto guru](http://vimeo.com/user435047), and quite a few amazing grips/electrics/gaffers that I know from my lighting experiences in IATSE.

When you sit down and get ready to write, from page one, how do you guys start?

This is what I did:
I thought about my main story and wrote down the goals of all my characters in this format: CHARACTER: GOAL AT BEGINNING/ GOAL AS IT CHANGES.

Then I wrote down a very short backstory for each main character. just to get an idea of their personalities.

Next I took down the story lines (story A, B, C D...) My story takes place in present day and simultaneously one year in the future so I have 1A-D and 2A-D

Then I started writing out story beats with a tag as to which storyline(s) they go to.



I'm finding that this is a very neat, clean way to organize my story, BUT I'm yet to even write my first slugline on this script. I think that I'm going to be patient and stick to the beats until they are DONE, THEN start writing the screenplay.


BUT. What I want to know is how you guys go about your writing. Lets see if we can sift through all the crap and find a few really great techniques. 

I'm especially interested in hearing from those of you who have actually sold a screenplay before.

So what other films are on your personal ""unremakeable"" list?

Casablanca is always the first one I think of, but The Searchers is now a close second.

And to stir the pot further: are there any classics that some might think of as unremakeable, but that you think might actually benefit from the right remake treatment?

My main question is, when writing a spec script how important is the actual format of the script? Should it be completely identical to scripts I find online and read? So identical, that if you didn't know any better you'd think it was an actual script? 

Secondly where is a good place to find information about television scripts specifically? Things like formatting and lingo that may not be in feature length scripts.

Here is a link to one of the scripts I was reading for reference. [The Big Bang Theory #222](http://www.zen134237.zen.co.uk/Big_Bang_Theory/The_Big_Bang_Theory_2x22_-_The_Monopolar_Expedition.pdf)

I've come up with an idea for a series that is unique enough to be interesting but not wacky enough to scare away producers.

Assuming that it's a legitimately good idea that an agent, or established TV writers and producers may be interested in, what should I write? Should I write just the pilot episode? Should I outline an entire season? Or 3 or 4 seasons? Should I write scripts for a handful of episodes?

I'm not sure what the normal procedure is here, or where to go with it.

2) How bad is typecasting for screenwriters? I've heard that it's worse than it is for actors. If I do end up selling a horror script, am I stuck writing horrors for the rest of my life?
3) I really like this story, and I'm thinking of stowing it away, til after I sell a couple of scripts. Maybe then I can negotiate the details of a deal, and get final rewrite control? How much of a pipedream is this? 
4) Finally, if I'm really trying to get my foot in the door, should I be writing only scripts that would translate into super low budget films. Is this limiting myself, or giving myself a real shot?

**FOR WRITERS:** A contest (with very low stakes). One month of Reddit Gold to the most popular script. 

The rules are simple:

1. If you write, you vote (by putting the name of your favorite script in a new comment). 
 
1. Can't vote for yourself.
  
1. Since it's against this sub's rules to solicit reviews (which is why there are no rules about reviewing), *a catchy title may be advantageous*.
 
1. This time and this time only, not writing a recognizably inspired script based on the premise or omitting the random word or phrase will be a disqualification.

1374615284.0,13,self.Screenwriting,1iwuu9,So we agree that 'Save The Cat' has created some problems for writers. What points/elements/features SHOULD be in most good scripts?,25,12,27,http://www.reddit.com/r/Screenwriting/comments/1iwuu9/so_we_agree_that_save_the_cat_has_created_some/,"(and if you came here to say 'oh, no, I use STC for **everything**, I follow it like a holy text', well, good. Not arguing with you.)

I'm writing here about general, linear, traditional screenplays. I understand that a lot of the work we love is non-traditional, non-linear. Some people can pull that off and some people spend their time trying to pull it off. It's like jazz: the guys and girls on that stage can improvise around a melody and make it their own and never play it the same way twice- but that's because they've mastered their craft to a degree that it has freed them from the constraints of melody. 

**** If one were to develop a checklist of points to tick off and consider, what would that list include?****

Let's say that every script should have a beginning, a middle and an ending. And those points should flow organically from one to another. Surprises are fine and good and useful, but it's nice to let the audience smack their forehead, say 'ohhhh!' to each other, followed by a headshake and a smile and 'shoulda seen that coming...' and that last part in a good way.

A screenplay should have a relationship and that relationship should move in time or counter-time to the plot. Your hero should have a gf or bf and their relationship should be either strengthened or weakened by the events in the plot; the relationship should be seen as a 'canary in a coalmine', giving an indication of how things are going. (my protag in my latest is in the most trouble he's been in when, boom, his gf breaks up with him. That does a lot for him, allows him to grow and change, frees him to become a new person, etc.) This leads to-

Things should get WORSE for the protagonist, not better, until he or she gets on 'the true path'- and even then, things shouldn't be all sunshine and roses. Getting on that path alerts the antags that now THEY are in jeopardy, leading them to step up their efforts to stop the protag- but now our protag has a plan and the reader wants to see that plan, how it works, how it adapts.

There should be antagonists who/that are appropriately powerful enough to present a real threat to the protag. These antags should be on multiple levels and at increasing levels of danger. By fighting them, the protag should be able to learn what he needs to move to the next level.

(and gee, it just occurred to me that this is a lot like a video game. I don't play video games. Huh.)

The protagonist should end the story strong where he was weak and rich where she was poor.

I gotta go. Thoughts?

1373845174.0,12,self.Screenwriting,1iayw8,The Purge [2013] - (plot / story / theme) analysis - SPOILERS,17,5,3,http://www.reddit.com/r/Screenwriting/comments/1iayw8/the_purge_2013_plot_story_theme_analysis_spoilers/,"I'll break this down into initial thoughts on viewing and then a brief description of the plot elements that caught my attention and then I'll end it with ideas on strengths it had and weaknesses; with possible solutions to the weaknesses.

**1.) Initial thoughts.**

The premise itself, that everyone is inherently violent, is a hell of a premise. I expect that this will be challenged throughout the film. On a personal level I completely disagree with this premise. There are a lot of wars, but the vast majority of violence is done by a very small group and type of people. The average person will avoid violence at all cost.

I like how in the very beginning Ethan Hawk says, under his breath, ""Home again, home again, jiggety jig."" I'm willing to bet that wasn't in the screenplay and was adlibbed on set by Ethan. This is a line in Blade Runner and, I assume, an oblique reference to dystopian fantasies i general. A nice toss-off.

I like how it begins like Shirley Jackson's ""The Lottery"" where everything is hyper normal and rather bland. They just accept it without question. 

Of the characters in the beginning you can almost tell which ones will be enemies later on in the film. The way they smile and pat each other. I know this is supposed to be a drama and all, but it's a little . . . well, I would've gone a different direction. That's where I'm coming from, though. I know there are only so many ways to do this and I just think the path the writers took lacked finesse. 

I like the links to socio-economics. The premise has the ring of Randian / psychopathic dominance. It's nice to see that the writers took it to the next level and thought through some of the implications of free crime for a day. Wealth redistribution indeed. And at gunpoint.

The fake-out with the boyfriend was a nice touch. It was sort of obvious, but it was effective for showing that the father was, himself, capable of violence. It was also a nice way of showing how devious the behavior gets during the purge. That said, the boyfriend's reasoning is pretty retarded. I mean, from a character standpoint, it makes no sense. I think this is just lousy writing. I can't believe that he'd actually think that murdering his girl friend's father would make her anything but hostile toward him. Could you imagine someone killing your father and then assuming you'd be having sex with that person? I think this interaction could've been saved, but the execution was poor.

Okay, the roving band of killers is pretty cheesy. The head guy with the crazy eyes is just sort of lame. I would much prefer that they hadn't gone the cartoon route. It's hard to watch something like this when you hear Looney Tunes in the background of the speech.

I'd also like to add that Game Theory would clearly and simply state that you simply do not allow the roving gang inside. You keep the walls up. The idea is that you can't trust them. If you keep the bloody stranger they'll kill you. If you open the doors they'll likely kill you. So there's no benefit to doing what they tell you. I would simply ally myself with the bloody stranger and formulate a Straw Dogs style plan.

Incidentally, it seems worth mentioning that the bloody stranger may or may not be homeless. The polite leader claims the bloody stranger is homeless (which he may very well be), but this is not verified by the bloody stranger. I like that this is not confirmed partly because it doesn't really matter if he's homeless or rich. He's just some freaking guy who wants to not get killed by crazy people.

The bloody stranger is a wasted character. He serves the purpose of getting the father to become more and more violent / immoral. First the father kills the boyfriend and then he tortures the bloody stranger. He was going to sacrifice a human life i order to protect his family. Which is all fine and well, but if you're going to have this bloody stranger guy the least you can do is use him. He ends up being a kind of Deus Ex Machina by the end which comes off as cheap. 

Now that I think about it, there are multiple coincidences and deus ex machina type situations throughout the movie. The majority of the fighting and death and conflict is not thought out at all. People are literally within proximity of each other and then seem to arbitrarily decide to kill each other.

Anyway, I liked the final part about everyone sitting at a table and waiting it out. There's a real feeling that the survivors will be shamed for their willingness to commit violence. I would have played this up a bit more, but given the context of the movie it worked pretty well.

I'm of the opinion that this was a great premise that could've been used / exploited / executed way better.

**2.) Brief description of plot elements.**

I think this was written with the normal three act structure in mind. I think this is the case because it has the standard lack of focus and act two malaise. I'll go ahead and look at it from the three act structure perspective since that's very likely how it was written:

Act 1: Set up story world and characters

We meet the family and the villains in one clean sweep. With a description of the night we're about to watch.

Act 2: The night begins.

Minutes after Purge Night begins the boyfriend initiates his own vengance against the father. At the same time a bloodied stranger enters the house.

Mid-act Climax

The people from whom the bloody stranger ran arrive. They give an ultimatum to the father.

The father declines.

Act 3: World 8-4 / princess in peril

The father kills a bunch of gang members. The polite leader kills the father. The neighbors try to kill the rest of the family. The bloody stranger saves the family.

Resolution: No violence is permitted

. . .

That was fucking sloppy.

Just awful.

**3.) Weaknesses with possible solutions.**

The ending kills the father who, I assume, was supposed to be the main character of the film. He was a weak main character. None of the other characters were much better. The final fight is really just a bunch of random actions and killings that don't really serve any purpose other than to have yelling, running and squibs.

Frankly I thought it was uninteresting.

The kids could have been great protagonists, but they just sort of existed (well, the little boy wasn't just hanging out - he at lest did stuff). The father had no arc and didn't really do much other than normal survival mode. Totally uninteresting. The mother had a little more going on, but she was also left to the side. At the end she did make the rather heroic gesture of choosing non-violence. I think this is one of the better bits of writing, but it wasn't set up at all and ultimately came off as just some more random meaningless bull. And the bloody stranger. He could've been a neat character too. He wasn't just hanging out. He was out there and doing things from the get go. But he was dropped during the entire first part of act three. He just magically showed up at just the right time - missing only a white horse and a saber.

Solutions, point by points -

1.) Pick a godamn main character and give that character something to do. Simply putting people in situations and then assuming that it's a movie is a waste of fucking time and energy.

In the existing movie the mother goes the peace route, but since she was always on the peace route this is not exactly a revelation or anything. No decision making happens and she's not really the one doing anything. All the decisions are happening around her and she's completely passive. This is not really satisfying.

They had a good story-world, but if you're going to go that route you should make damned sure that your character has an arc that really takes advantage of that story world.

The story world involved violence. The end involved a movement toward non-violence. I would have made the main character a Purge enthusiast. And then I would have had that character experience the violence on a personal level. And then I would have had that character empathize with someone against whom he commits violence. Thus making the peace solution properly impactful.

It's not that they should've picked one character over another to be a protagionst; it's that they didn't have a protagonist at all. None of the characters, save the bloody stranger and the little boy, would've made interesting protagonists given the choices. And even they were rather flat.

The solution: 

Design an action that goes along with and then diametrically opposes the story world values. Have a single character perform this action. 

2.) The philosophies were not really explored.

They were discussed in exposition, but they weren't explored or shown in action There was a little implication with the neighbors trying to kill the family over money issues, but this was kinda two dimensional. It made some sense, but since all of the characters were completely flat and little decision making was happening it was just another meaingless piece within a larger pile of meaningless stuff.

Solution:

Show decision-making within the context of how this violence would effect relationships after the Purge. This is hinted at in the final scene. Otherwise it's an unused tool begging to be picked up and examined. Which is a shame. Going in this direction would have shown exactly how violence impacts society. It's never the 'In The Moment' stuff that resonates. It's what happens afterward that makes it relevant.

The reason the characters were flat and uninteresting was because they weren't really deciding to do things and their value sets weren't really in question at any point. I would have deleted all of the characters and plot points and started from scratch. The story world is interesting enough that I would have done everything possible to use it.

You want good characters? Have a good action to be performed. One character. One goal. Your character wants to do one fucking thing and that's all he or she wants to do. Now block that thing and force your character to have to overcome whatever is keeping them from reaching their goal. Move mountains if need be, Force them to make decisions. Force them to put things on the line. Force them to overcome their own problems. Do not just have a bunch of events happen around them. This sort of passivity makes characters spectators in their own lives. We may as well be filming rocks and leaves. Hell, I would have preferred that (Baraka is still a favorite of mine).

Over-all: Not bad if you have a six pack and a night to kill.

Particularly if you like to MST3K your movies.

I found a bunch of spelling and grammatical errors that I couldn't not correct.

Also, I totally messed up the author of 'The Lottery' - I thought it was Flannery O'Connor for some reason.
