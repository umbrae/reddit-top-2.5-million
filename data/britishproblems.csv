EDIT: Wow, this kind of, exploded. A lot of people seem to be misunderstanding my view on this, so I'll explain:

The title was sarcasm. I think discrimination, negative or positive, is at best detrimental and at worst despicable. As such, my problem with this news is that the bank gave their reason for adding Jane Austen to the new set as them needing to have a woman, rather than because they believed her contributions to be great enough.

My other gripe is that I personally believe Jane Austen to be a bad choice. This is not because I believe her contribution to be inferior to anyone elses' but because she is already widely famous. I remember when I first noticed Elizabeth Fry on a fiver and it compelled me to find out who she was. I believe that there are many great people, several of which have been mentioned here, that are much more in need of the unique recognition that this brings, and I feel that including Ms. Austen, who is already a household name, is wasting an opportunity to celebrate someone whose contributions would otherwise go unnoticed.

She is incredibly butch and has a comically deep voice that she exaggerates when speaking to men, which is hilarious because she's about the same height as me, at five feet nothing, and looks like a boy still in primary school. Also, it seems she does shake hands, only with the lads who live here. Apparently it's ""very firm"".

I don't know the full extent of her philistine existence but she retuned the kitchen radio from 4 to 1, has never heard of Joy Division, asked what the point of record collecting is and upon seeing a record player said that her brother does some DJ stuff at weekends and has even met Tiesto, who is a ""legend"". She hates cats. We have four.

The landlord, who lives on the property, won't actually like her anymore than we do and is only doing this as a favour to the girl's dad (who's actually really civilised) and has not met the girl yet.

And I'm glad I did

For my £11 I got a haricut, my hair washed, something with the edge of my hair with a cut-throat razor, they put cologne on me and this fire thing where they burnt the hairs on my ears... THEY BURNT THE HAIR OFF MY EARS!!!! My hair has never looked so well cut.

I feel guilty for cheating on my English barber for one of these ""turkish up starts"" but i'm also pleased I did as I got value for money and a better hair cut
