This allowed it astounding clarity into subjects that moved too slowly for human senses. Alas, as years passed, the robot was thought of as useless and discarded.

But the real excitement is the special edition challenge featuring Roy Kelly, aka Yeah_Ill_Read_That!! If you're not familiar with Roy/YIRT, he does amazing voice acts of reddit posts. [Here is a past post he has done of the top 1p submission of alll time!](http://www.reddit.com/r/OneParagraph/comments/o5yip/wandering_in_the_snow/c3ewmw5)

For challenge [2.16]...

Write ANYTHING that you think would sound fantastic read by an amazing voice actor. Write a monologue, write a scene description, write dialogue, write whatever. The emphasis for this challenge is lyrical quality. Are you the next speech writer for the president, or the next Tarantino with your engaging dialogue? Prove it!

(A caveat: Because Roy/YIRT is male he is much more comfortable reading male voices. If you include more than one POV in your 1P, be sure that there is no more than a single female voice. More than one male voices are acceptable.This isn't because we are sexist here or anything, it's only a limitation to try and make YIRT's performance more feasible and spectacular. Thanks for understanding!)

**For participants new to 1P or just reddit in general, here's some help:**

**To Enter**: Scroll down a little and click ""submit a link."" Just paste your one paragraph story in and give it a title, but in front of the title put [2.16]. That's how you tell the moderators that you want your story considered part of the contest.

**To vote for entries**: In the search field on the right side of this page, type in [2.16], making sure to keep ""limit my search to r/oneparagraph"" checked. All results starting with that 2.16 in brackets are submissions for this week's contest. You can go through them and upvote as many stories as you want.

EDIT: Clarity thanks to waltfellows

EDIT: Added instructions for Roy's youtube subscribers following his link and who wish to participate in the contest.

Hey, so of course we’re meant to start out with pleasantries since that’s what normal people do (hello, how are you etc…) but why don’t we skip that since they’re so boring and pointless. And then we should probably talk about our jobs, where we went to school, how many brothers and sisters we have, and perhaps ascertain if we have mutual tastes in food and literature. It is even possible that we will have different tastes, but that our disagreement about this will be comical, rather than unpleasant. And then, as the evening wears on, after we feel the glow of several beers, we might start to smile more, relax a bit, and then our minds will go crazy, ridiculous fantasies of beach-front weddings, lounging in the park on Sundays as our kids run around on the grass, giggling and chasing butterflies. And then when the check comes, our hands will brush, and our hearts will melt. But of course for all of that to happen, I would have to message you. And since I am a scared man, sitting amidst the filth of his apartment, staring at your okcupid profile like a lecherous sociopath, perhaps I should simply leave you alone. Let you meet the man who might actually make this fantasy come true. Not the man whose pathetic, desperate messages you ignore with only a slight twinge of guilt, and who you mock, kindly, to your girlfriends over your Thursday night margaritas.

People who refuse to release their words when it is necessary easily find themselves tearing down their own ideas, opinions, and thoughts. With every instance of chosen silence, they sap themselves of the power to change things around them. Things happen to them more and more, and they make things happen less and less.

You’d think after a time you’d forget. But you never forget. It sticks with you like a festering wound. It’s always there. Those tears on the bathroom floor. That gutwrenching pain when you realized that, in fact, you would never see that face again, would never see her smile at you in that way she did, and that you would never walk hand in hand with her down suburban streets bathed in autumnal light, pushing a baby carriage while the leaves rustled in a soft breeze. It’s still there. When you walk in the sunlight holding the new one’s hand (who is just as wonderful and just as special, if not more so). When you shower in the morning, feeling the hot water on your back, legs and head. And when you sit with friends, sharing beers and funny stories, it’s still there. You get up to go to the bathroom, look at yourself in the mirror, and feel it inside of you. The thing that snapped, taking with it all you took for granted and what felt like, for a while, your only chance at happiness. And still life goes on. Tomorrow you get up and do it all again.

Parents create safe cocoons and we hate them for it. The mugs of hot chocolate steaming on the kitchen table as we stumble back from playing in the snow. The hand placed gently on our back as we sit engrossed in our favorite novel. The overabundance of Christmas presents with the crinkly wrapping paper. The fresh-smelling new books that we glance at before relegating to a forgotten pile in our bedroom. The endless rides, the never-ending ferrying between this and that play-date, match, concert, after school activity. And we hate them and hate them and hate them and hate them. And blame them for everything. And watch their acid-tongued exchanges when they forget that we are listening, their scathing withering remarks, even as, with the same breath, they tousle your hair and tell you you’re so special. They create the most wonderful, magical, impermeable of cocoons and we cannot help hating them for it.

[TALK],16,0,1,http://www.reddit.com/r/OneParagraph/comments/jsmrb/creating_a_strong_character_without_them_ever/,"First, please watch this video by Johnny Cash called [Five Feet High And Rising](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9fpbCLNyPUA).

This song is possibly one of the greatest examples of elegantly creating a character, the papa, even though he never speaks a word in the entire song. The mother does all the explaining to the kid - she answers when the kid asks her how high the water is and again when the kid asks papa. 

Yet you can just feel papa's presence through every single note of this song. His silence is much more powerful than if he had any lines. You know he's feeling desperate at the loss due to the flood, but you also get the impression that he's a stoic man, never one to complain but always one to worry. Momma does all the talking for him because she knows how bad things are and she's trying to keep the family together. 

When Cash wrote this, he obviously made the deliberate choice to always say ""**She** said it's X feet high and rising"" no matter who the kid is asking the question to. Cash wanted to paint a picture of the typical strong, worried and silent male farmer. And he did it without giving papa anything to say or having the mother or kid describe what the father looked like, or any description of the father at all.

This is a great example of storytelling. Even though it's a song, it still applies to storytelling, especially here in 1P since we have such limited space to create a character. In just 2 min, Cash created two real, vivid characters, the setting of a farm, flood and family. He used very natural language and stayed true to how these characters would respond given the circumstances. Cash doesn't cheat us, the listener, and he doesn't try to overdo it with too much exposition or description.

Now, granted, this is not everyone's style of writing, nor am I trying to imply how I think anyone here should write. I just wanted to point out how a simple, elegant choice created a vivid character with very limited space.",,False,,t5_2rkb7,False,,,True,t3_jsmrb,http://www.reddit.com/r/OneParagraph/comments/jsmrb/creating_a_strong_character_without_them_ever/,

No one knows what it is. He doesn't. His friends don't even suspect. There are some theories as to when, though. Most chroniclers believe that it was the summer of '57, when he cracked his head open. A few believe it was the winter of '59, when he *grew up* and gave up on his childish dreams. Some point to '58 when his heart broke. Others cite the all round terrible year that was '61, when no ship found harbour in a stormy sea. But these are meager hints.

Let me guess. In social situations you always feel slightly out of place. You can’t quite engage with what’s going on around you, you can’t participate in the relaxed, joyful mirth that comes so easily to your companions in the bar or restaurant. You only truly feel yourself when reading books or by yourself. You have a job that pays the bills but you feel that there’s something missing, that a special relationship or a change in career will make you happier, make you more fulfilled, give your life a greater sense of meaning. “If only I had made better decisions when I was younger,”  you think, “I would be truly happy.” Maybe you spend a few minutes sitting on your couch staring at the ground, mulling over your life choices. You make some attempts to change. Learn an instrument, try to write a novel, but somehow life moves along about the same as it always has. You realize that all the wild fantasies you had as a high schooler and college student will never come true. You resign yourself to a certain amount of boredom, unpleasantness and pain, so long as you are safe, and have enough people around you to keep from being lonely. Occasionally you still get carried away with wild fantasies (successful novelist, award winning teacher, late-blooming professional musician). But now when the fantasies subside you don’t cry.

No trees grew out of bare ground, and every pet and livestock were bred captive in a laboratory. Every drop of our blood was contaminated with robots that engineered our metabolisms and regulated our hormones, controlling our thoughts and feelings. We faced seemingly insurmountable challenges, but we resolved them, generation by generation. It took years, but we melted down the steel beams and panels until only dirt remained. As we did this, rain would come and we were not protected from it. We built huts from the artificial trees as the dirt replenished into soil and grass grew again. As we departed from electricity, our bodies easily fell ill, and we bled out the machines while facing dangers we've never encountered. Slowly, animals traveled back as weeds and bushes sprouted. Insects resurfaced after centuries of silent absence. We finally freed ourselves when the last neon spotlight went dark. Then, we found a beautiful resolution.

At last he turned to the page he was seeking, and he scowled. The recipe called for margarine, rather than butter. Unbelievable, he thought. Martha had been cooking with margarine all these years.

Five minutes to write something. Anything. I’m jittery. My heart is pounding. It was a crazy night, running from goblins, hiding under an enormous rock while horses' hoofs pounded overhead. At one point, a great eagle swooped down and beckoned that I climb aboard. I clutched his downy feathers and we soared into the sky. When he dropped me off in the middle of the Evermore forest (towering trees that smell of soft, damp earth), I walked for six hours until my feet bled. And now I am where I am now. Scribbling these words with a quill pen on one of my few remaining scraps of paper. The poor villager who took pity on my dozes by the fire in this squallid little hovel that smells of fish and wet wool. I will rise before he wakes and tip toe out into the forest. I have a six hour head start on the goblins. And the whispering in the leaves tell me that Clora, the love of my life, the fire that ignites my soul, is shivering in a cave just a day’s journey away, tracing my name endlessly on the rough stone walls.

**Challenge [2.33]: Conspiracy**

So,

This week I discovered a subreddit called /r/hailcorporate. It's pretty interesting. Basically it's devoted to calling out posts that seem like they could be viral marketing by companies. It's all pretty conspiratorial, and that got me thinking.

How about some stories about conspiracies?!

They could be anything. 

Two kids plotting a water balloon fight? That's a conspiracy

Plot to destroy the world's largest tire to collect insurance money? Conspiracy

Covert military operation gon awry deep in enemy territory? Conspiracy

There's a lot you can do with the concept of a conspiracy, so go wild!

When I was a child I covered my bedroom walls with pictures from Sports llustrated. I would spend hours staring at them and dreaming of when I myself would stand in front of a roaring crowd, rocket a long fly ball to deep centerfield, and hear the thunderous ovation of 50,000 delirious fans. In middle school, it dawned on me that a bench warmer on his senior league baseball team would probably never make the Major Leagues. So my ambitions shifted to something more modest: professional tennis player. Fewer people played tennis (so it seemed to me) so that would give me a better shot. For six weeks after school, I placed my $25 kmart tennis racket and some squishy balls from a yard sale in my backpack and biked across the campus of the local university to hit balls against the side of a quasi-deserted building. On the way I passed actual tennis courts which had been long since abandoned, the green surface a spider web of cracks, filled with tufts of grass. No matter, in a few years, I would be stalking the pristine lawns of Wimbledon. Trying to encourage my interest, my parents paid for tennis lessons from a middle-aged man from our church. The first lesson was horrific. Despite my hours of solitary practice, I was incapable of returning a single shot that the instructor gently lobbed in my direction. After spraying hundreds of balls into the net, over the fence, and into the adjacent courts, the lesson ended and I ran home sobbing. That night I tore down every single picture on my wall and started working furiously on a novel about that day’s disappointment, stopping periodically to imagine what picture would be on the cover and how many weeks it would stay on the New York Times best-seller list.

The shock moved surprisingly swiftly to calmness  as he accepted his fate.  His eyes went to the dusty portrait of his wife on the mantelpiece.  It was not a picture of her wrinkled and weak as she was when she had died years before, it was a sepia toned portrait of her when they were married.  Her skin flawless, her best peals around her neck.  She smiled at him now across the room and across the years.  He smiled back at her.  And as the room began to dim he thought *I’m coming sweety.

I sobbed in their arms like a child but grew scared when they tried to touch me. Their hungry eyes repulsed me and eventually I ran away. Those times (the years after college) were terrifying, painful and exhilarating. Anything seemed possible. I could wake up one morning and be a famous writer. I could wake up one morning and be convinced that I would die alone, staring with agony at my ex-girlfriend’s facebook page. There would be pictures of her baking Christmas cookies with a brood of smiling children. Thankfully, this will not happen. On the downside, I am stuck inside an electric body.

Did it involve a sensation so intense that your life was changed forever, and that for the rest of your days you glided through the world with cool confidence? No, no, no, it couldn’t be so.

I want to take a chance here to reach out to readers who may not have submitted because they don't know if they're work is good enough.

My message: I don't care if you're good.

Seriously. 

The only way you get good is if you try, if you learn, and you keep writing.

[Ira Glass explains this philosophy](http://vimeo.com/24715531).

I want to see people who haven't submitted before try to do so, even if they think it's crap.

**The Week 3 Challenge**

[2.3]

""Itch Once Scratched""

This idea come from redditor [waltfellows](http://www.reddit.com/r/OneParagraph/comments/y494q/new_challenge_idea_submissions_generation_2/).

What happens when one finally takes the plunge to satisfy a temptation - was it worth it?

I want to see stories about that exact thing. We've all been there. These are feelings worth exploring because more often than not we never get satisfied in the way we wanted to be. Many times caving in to temptation takes us somewhere other than we thought it could. It takes us to places that we didn't know existed. It takes us to places that elate us, annoy us, or make us reget that our temptation ever existed. 

Take us to that place of ""So that's what it's like.""

We're jmn357 and lucidenigma and we're two new mods here. We're just getting settled in and figuring things out. In the coming weeks we're looking to reinvigorate the subreddit.

First though, let's have some introductions:

**jmn357:** 

Hey ya'll

I've been a redditor for over three years and have been a long time submitter to /r/OneParagraph. It's one of my favorite Reddit writing communities. I work full time, but I plan to devote my free time on Reddit to make this a better community.

Why mod /r/OneParagraph?

It's always been a place for me to hone specific ideas. Flash-fiction like this is a skill that makes you a better writer, a more focussed story teller, and exercises your endurance. 

As a writer I've always found it easiest to write about relationships (of all types). The simplicity of interaction is one of my favorite things to explore. As far as influences my greatest would have to be Haruki Murakami.

 

**lucidenigma:**

Hello everyone,

I'm one of the two new mods and extremely excited to spruce up this subreddit. I've been a redditor for about a year and a half now and only recently have I become involved with writing communities such as this one. I'm a college student in Cambridge so I'll have ample free time to devote to /r/oneparagraph.

I decided to join this subreddit because I believe the first step in becoming a great writer is building a sound foundation. Mastering the art of filling a single paragraph with depth is an essential part of this process. As a philosophy concentrator I love the psychological and sub-conscious struggles characters have and it is what I enjoy writing about. Authors like Faulkner and Hemingway have distinctly impacted my style in this way.

Anyways, I hope to improve this community for all the current members and try to expand it as well! Keep writing!

**We also need some help from you:** 

What we're asking for first is someone who is a CSS wizard to help make a new theme for the subreddit. I think we're edging towards a cleaner, simpler design: something that reflects the brevity and the simplicity of the material submitted here. Please message the moderators if you are the person for the job, know someone who can do it, or have seen a design you like.

We also want you to be active! 

Submit! 

Comment! 

And don't be afraid to crosspost something you post here somewhere else if it's relevant. We're looking to get traffic up a bit so more people can see the quality writing that's here, and so we can all enjoys writers that haven't submitted here yet because they don't know the subreddit exists. 

**New Challenges:**

We will backlog the first generation of weekly challenges on the sidebar. Because it's been so long since one was posted, we've decided to break the challenges up. The new ones will be part of a second generation. As such, when submitting your challenges on the main /r/oneparagraph page you should number the challenge accordingly. 

It should look something like this:

""[2.1] The title""

Now...

The actual challenge.

**[2.1]: Retail**

Retail: 

Many of us have had crappy retail jobs. You know the one, when you were in high school and you spent all summer as a cashier dealing with little old ladies trying to use coupons that expired during the first Clinton administration. Maybe you worked in a mall, or in the stockroom of a store. Maybe you've never worked retail, but you've all been to stores and had experiences in them. Some are good, some bad, and sometimes you have experiences you weren't expecting when you made that run to get AA batteries for your remote.

So, we're looking for stories about retail. Stories that tell the tale of being in a store, perhaps working there, and the realities we all deal with when we spend our money.

The bag is thrown into a garbage truck where it bursts, but the contents still make it to the city dump, where the cap rolls out and settles at the edge of a massive pile of garbage.  A gull, circling the dump with many of it's kind,  spots it and quickly scoops it off the ground and flies off to enjoy it's prize away from the other gulls.  The gull is unable to eat the cap, it being too large to swallow and impossible to break.  Still hungry and frustrated that so many of the best looking meals at the dump turn out to be inedible, it drops the cap into a stream.  The cap makes it way down the stream where many animals waste their time trying to eat it.  A few turtles chomp on the tasty looking morsel, and a raccoon turns it over in its tiny hands until reluctantly letting it go.  The cap continues on and eventually reaches the sea years later, still as bright and red as the day it was made, and it bobs among the waves until an unlucky pelican, a female out gathering food for it's young, is able to swallow the cap, where it lodges in her stomach among other bits of plastic and slowly starves her to death.  The young back at the nest , their necks extended and mouths open wide, eventually weaken until they can no longer hold their heads up, and finally lay still in a nest made up of plastic bags and drinking straws.   The red cap is found on a beach lying among the bones and feathers of the mother bird by a child who quietly contemplates the scene.  He picks up the bright red cap and brings it to his father, the same man who threw it away many years before, and who gives the son a lecture about littering and the consequences of being environmentally irresponsible.  He makes sure his son throws the cap into the garbage and then forgets about it a few seconds later.  Why wouldn't he?  It's just a bottle cap.

I needed to go reset a song on my computer and on my way back saw a hornet. It was clinging to the window, probably trying to find its way out (it was chores day, so the window was quite clean). At that moment instincts kicked in and I forcefully attacked the hornet with an arts-and-crafts project lying around of my sisters. It was a stick with some writing on it and some sinew tied to the top and it proved it self to be a poor weapon. It was too long to accuratly swing into the window area and the sinew would get wrapped around plants and such on the windowsill. At best I could fling some air at it so it would fly to some other part of the window. I quickly switched it out for a hand-towel, a personal weapon of choice. Now properly equiped I went again at the beast, first strike rendering it without flight, second strike crippiling it more severly still. Time for the kill, I grabbed a screwdriver with the intensions of crushing and severing its head, a solid plan I thought. When I placed the screwdriver something I didn't expect happened, it shook. As if to defend itself from its inevitable death. It did this continually, spasiming slightly as if to somehow get away. I couldn't figure it out, why fight? It must hurt to move like that being in the condition it was in. It was as if to the hornet that excruciating pain was better then whatever it was that came after, it fought to be alive soley because it meant being alive, no matter what condition. Feeling sorry for him I slid him onto the towel with the screwdriver. Then I set him down on the back porch, figuring that this is what it was he was looking for in the first place, to be outside. I watched him for awhile, he laid there in the sun. He didn't move after that, except for his antenna shifting slighly in the wind.

**Challenge [2.26]: Insomnia**

This week I want stories about insomnia. I don't mean that week in college you couldn't sleep, or how you don't get that many hours of sleep.

I mean real, fucking painful, no sleep at all for days insomnia. Some of us have been there and it's a strange place. After the first night you're tired, after the second you start to not feel right, and after three days without sleep you tend to enter the delirious.

I want to see stories about people struggling with true insomnia. Stories of people who can't sleep and what they do with that time. Drive the streets at 3:00 A.M., watch TV for hours, go on long trips to places and back: these are all things insomniacs do.

Take me to that place. If you've never been, read up. Incorporate those little details into your story. As the phrase goes ""show, don't tell"". Show me people who chronically can't sleep. 

I'll be waiting. Hopefully not all night.

I could tell you that when I put on John Coltrane’s version of My Favorite Things that the saxophone sounded so plaintive and haunting that something inside me burst and I just cried and cried, mourning my past, mourning the girlfriend who was no longer mine, and feeling utterly devastated, scared, alone, etc… I could tell you all of that, but what would be the point? And it would be impossible for you to understand. Or if you did understand, there would no need for the two of us to experience that together again. We’d just make quiet eye contact and then keep on talking about mundane, everyday things, the only things that really matter. I don’t know if I’ll ever know how to talk about that night.

RICHMOND - Confederate President Rick Perry has announced plans on Monday to introduce legislation intended to loosen restrictions on colored CSA citizens in exchange for medical aid from the U.S. The announcement comes on the heels of 3 week bilateral negotiations between U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Rodham and the C.S. Ambassador Jeb Bush. The rising death toll of the salmonella outbreak in the C.S. state of Chihuahua combined with the underfunded medical infrastructure of the southwestern Confederate border states gave Secretary Rodham the leverage needed to force the issue of state sanctioned racial violence with her C.S. counterparts.

Sighing, she looked in the mirror, trying to brush knots out of her long, curly red hair. She figured she should look more professional. She sat down on her bed. Her and Hail's bed, really, but Hail was never home anymore, not since there was increased reconnaissance ordered onto the Archambeau HQ. Frowning, she opened her bedside table drawer and pulled out a bundle of letters. She opened one and started reading it. It was from when they were thirteen, when Hail was still living in London. Alice had finally forgiven him for not writing her for a year, and he had forgiven her for burning his bed out of anger. Time was funny, in that way. It made some hurts ebb away, while the happiness that came with being with Hail burned brightly in her heart, and no one would ever douse that fire. Even though they had been apart nearly ten years, they had loved each other the entire time, and when he came back, an odd combination of old nostalgia and re-introduction kept her holding onto him.

Exasperated (and a bit desperate) I finally shouted “Is there anybody else who can help me?” “Yes! Step around the counter, if you please!” came a hoarse yell from the back. I stepped around the display case, past the oblivious salesman and into a backroom where I was suddenly face to face with a wild-haired old man. He had a main of greasy white hair, wore what appeared to be foul smelling rags, and himself reeked of alcohol. Before I could make my escape, he grasped my arm, pulled my face close to his and rasped “Before it’s too late son, save yourself before it’s too late. Rid yourself of material things and go off to the country to live in peace in a little shack where you learn to play the trumpet and read poetry. Go, now, now, before it’s too late!” Terrified, I wrenched myself free and ran out past the still yammering salesman into the freezing January air. Once safely on the sidewalk, I paused. Was it a message from God? On an impulse I took out my phone, wallet and apartment keys and held them over a trashcan. Should I? Was this the bold move that would make my life better and allow me to stop focusing on boring things? My fingers twitched but then I grew scared, shoved everything in my pocket and sprinted back to my apartment through the throngs of indifferent pedestrians.

Walking down the street, lost in thought, I suddenly came across  my ex-girlfriend bending over a garbage can, picking out stray bits of food. Though I had not seen her since our devastating break-up the day after our college graduation, I knew in an instant that it was her. That same face that I’d kissed thousands of times, the same hair that I had caressed as we lay in bed watching movies on her laptop, and the same back that my hand had grazed as we sat on the beach feeling warm and happy. And she was now reduced to foraging for her food like some sort of animal. She was intent on her task, peering into the can, shifting around the bits of paper, the apple cores, banana peels, empty coke bottles. Homeless, a vagrant, reduced to the extremes of poverty, because some emotionally unstable college student (myself) had broken her heart, sending her into a psychological tailspin that had ruined any chance she might have had for a normal life. I wanted to run away and die. But I could not. I had to speak. I had to somehow try and make amends for what I’d done. Even though no words, not even the offer of a hot meal, or a supermarket gift card could repair the wholesale destruction of a life, I had to try. “Karen, hey, it’s me.” She looked up and her face brightened. “Todd? Oh my God, so good to see you! I was wondering what you were up to! The most ridiculous thing, I dropped my iphone in here. God it’s gross. Do you mind helping me look?”

Now I write term papers that no one reads, but as a kid I wrote short stories that no one ever read. Alone in my room, hunched over a purloined legal pad, I waited for inspiration. In my right hand, a freshly sharpened Ticonderoga pencil, smelling sweetly of wood and graphite (I press it to my nose and inhale deeply). I get an idea, and my shaky scrawl fills the page. It is a knight. He rides through silky meadows, climbs steep and treacherous mountains, before stopping at the foot of a tall turret. He peers upwards, the sun glinting in his eye, he hears a voice…and the tip of the pencil breaks leaving nothing but a jagged, wooden socket. I pause, and terror seizes me. What if anyone I knew saw this story? I imagine the merciless mockery, recess spent sitting silently against a brick wall watching the others play. Eating lunch alone while chewing pathetically on a dry peanut butter sandwich. I rip off the page, crush it into a ball, and throw it against the wall.

That means TriAft's story will be read out loud by Reddit user Yeah_Ill_Read_That in the coming weeks. The reading will be posted here for everyone to see.

I really liked the challenge and want to give a big thanks to lucidenigma for coming up with the idea and spearheading the whole project. Really, I can not thank you enough.

---------------------

And so, we march on writing.

**Challenge [2.17]: ""I'm sorry.""**

This week I want to try a different approach. I'm giving you a piece of dialogue, and you can do whatever you want with it. The rules are it has to be the first line of the story.

So, this week start a story with the line ""I'm sorry.""

It's a powerful and vague starting line. It can take you anywhere and the subsequent story can be in any person. 

Really think it over, what have you honestly been sorry about? Was it to someone else? To yourself? Ever have anyone honestly be sorry to you?

Did you ever feign an apology to make yourself seem better in a situation?

This gives you a lot of possibilities from one specific direction.

Have fun!

Never mind that some mornings he stayed in bed until noon joylessly browsing the internet. This entry would be the first incremental step towards a life of fame and fortune. He pasted the link into facebook and, confident of the fawning reader comments he would find the next morning, he wrote “one of my best entries yet.

At last, when he deemed it late enough in the morning, he rushed to the computer in giddy anticipation, like a child bounding down the stairs to glimpse what presents had been laid ever so lovingly for him under the tree.

**Challenge [2.13]: Politics**

With the American election this week I decided to go a bit vague and ask for stories about politics. 

That could really be... anything. 

Is it a story about a politician? 

An allegory for some political doctrine you believe in or disagree with? 

A snarky tale mocking politics you see as silly? 

A cynical piece about the never-ending stream of disappoints we get from most politicians? 

A tale of a second-grade class election gone horribly wrong thanks to Julie Jenkins smear campaign accusing Timmy Thompson of being an anti-cootie vaccine nose-picker?

Get creative here, just having to have *some sort of political something* really gives you a lot of leeway. Explore. 

Whatever you do... just write.

I was sitting on a curb, huddled tentatively under an arching bush in a state of non-existence.

If you read through the material we have so far, and you don't see anything you want to build off of, go back to the original story and pick a different element to build from.  W can have multiple threads running at once, each building the world out in different directions, so to speak.

You don't have to continue the story -- in fact, it's recommended that you don't.  The point is to build up the world, so that each of the 1P stories in this thread can be said to take place in more or less the same world.

At 17, he was old enough to realize it had not been easy for her to raise him with basically no help either from his deadbeat dad or from his grumpy grandparents. Yet he told her he still didn't think he had done anything wrong. He didn't really steal anything. Sure, he'd downloaded a torrent with the CAD files. It took about 10 minutes to find and
grab it. He checked with Mr. Wolfe, his shop teacher, if it was ok to print something big on the new 3D printers. Mr. Wolfe said it was fine, they actually had about two tons of polymers they had to get rid of so the new shipment could come in. Being the CAD Shop class TA, he had the keys to the shop and lab. Printing took about two weeks. Assembling the parts about twice as much. Derek did it all himself, but it was worth it. The beautiful yellow Mustang sitting outside, every inch carefully polished by Derek, glistening in the sun. He built it. He assembled it. Every. Single. Piece. And now they wanted to take it away.

""Hey, do you want any mac n' cheese? I'm gunna make some""

I turned to see the ghostly specter of my ex-girlfriend standing, rather, floating in my kitchenette. She looked like every depiction of a ghost I'd ever seen in movies; she was light blue, barely transparent, and hovered roughly six inches above the floor. 

""err... sure?"", I replied, hesitantly. 

Was she really back from the beyond? Did she even die, for that matter? I had heard no news of her death if it had happened. But here she was, ghostly cooking my pasta. I watched her cautiously. Her hands, clearly too ethereal for this plane, were passing straight through the pot and wooden spoon that she appeared to be cooking with. She merely pantomimed cuisine. I watched as she reached toward the bowls, made an exaggerated pouring motion, and shoved an invisible meal into my hands. I humored her and pretended to eat alongside her. I took this chance to get a closer look at her. She was clearly the same girl I had known. Though she was clearly not alive, her vivacity still radiated like a warm sun. Next to her, I was scorched to desert. Her smile was a pitcher of cool water and her lips were the cup from which I craved drink. If only she knew how much I had missed her. I put my invisible meal down and kissed her. She appeared surprised but kissed me back. 

""I know those eyes"", she said. ""Hold on, I've got a surprise for you""

She leaned back and strode into my bedroom, emerging moments later in lingerie that she bought two summers ago. Beside myself, I followed her to the bed. 

""Do you have anything in mind?"" she asked. 

""No, I'll follow your lead"", I replied. 

She gave me a sad smile that, for a moment, made me wonder if perhaps she was not fully alive and I the husk of a former man. She kissed me again, so powerfully that I could almost feel her lips. She fell on to me like light on a forest floor and I receded to the bed. Instantly, she became cloudy, as though her outline had smeared. She kissed me again and, again, she became even more vaporous. I touched my face. It was wet. I wiped the tears from my eyes and the phantom was gone. I was alone again.

There was a lot of crying during that period. A lot of short stories were started and then aborted. A few novels in there too. Youtube performance art in which I covered my face with towels and neck ties, leaned in close to the camera and gave life wisdom in an exaggerated Jamaican accent.

Late night trips to the gas station to buy Doritos and Sour Patch kids which I scarfed down on the drive home, too impatient to even wait until I was parked in front of the TV listlessly flipping channels and surfing the web. There was a lot of pining for when I would be famous and when I would get back together with that girl who I used to call every day and who now was sleeping with someone else, and for all I knew, never thought about me at all.

**[2.20] Challenge: New Years**

So, this week is New Years Eve. It's the holiday of sentimentality, drunkenness, and hugging your friends tight because you've made it through another year together.

This week I want you to write stories based around the general idea of a ""new year"". This can be taken pretty broadly. You could do something specific like a story in a New Years party, or someone starting their first year of school. You can take it broader: a character recalling a year of sobriety or the years counted since their wife died.

Take it wherever you want but keep the idea of a ""new year"" in there somewhere.

On that note: enjoy the new year, stay safe out there tomorrow. See you all in 2013!

Where does this leave the grandest efforts of mankind to advance itself simply for the sake of progress?

**Challenge [2.12]: Truly Terrifying**

Halloween is upon us. That means scary movies, stories, and music. 

Scary stories can be fun. 

But that's what I want you to avoid. 

Avoid scary stuff that's fun, silly, surreal, or unreal. I don't want to see stories about vampires, ghosts, or axe-murders.

I want to see stories about things that are actually *truly terrifying*. 

The sort of shit that makes people stay up late at night. 

The sort of shit you bury deep inside. 

The sort of shit that festers within you.

The sort of shit you that makes your body tense up as you fall into a deep anxiety attack. 

What do I mean then by truly terrifying things?

*Dying unloved and alone*

*Realizing none of your friends really care about you*

*Agonizing over your fear of death*

*Crippling social phobia*

*The blinding ignorance of the masses*

*The facade you've created around yourself*

*Settling down because you stopped caring*

*An unfulfilled life* 

*Sadness that prevents you from leaving your bed*

*Regret that weighs down on you every day*






Writing story about a psychopath or some M. Night Shamalamadingdong twist... that's been done to death.

Let's hear stories about the things that scare us everyday. The fears we deal with constantly and rule us.

You think I want to be here? You really think I want to stand here and fake smile while you guys stare at your shoes and roll your eyes at everything I say? DO YOU THINK THIS MAKES ME HAPPY?! I mean, yes clearly, in an ideal world, all of our basic necessities (food production, clean water, transportation) would be taken care of by robots who did NOT take over the world and subsequently enslave us to probe us with their steely cold robot arms. And in this ideal world we would do nothing but eat pastries, play tennis, whiffle ball and go swimming and read books that we liked and occasionally have sex with beautiful women without things ever getting weird or awkward afterwards. And then in the evenings we’d play cards and music and sit around big bonfires and laugh and tell stories. But since we CAN’T have that for the love of GOD, please just throw me a bone, stop your horrific, pimply 13 year-old flirting and fill out the god damn worksheet!

**[Challenge 2.8] Standing in Line**

So this week I want to read stories about standing in line. We do it every day. Whether it's the mundane like waiting for a train or your coffee, or something more exciting like a concert or a ball game. We all stand in line all the time.

So let's see some stories about it.

This can really take you many places. Do you see something? Someone? Meet someone? Realize something?

We all have stories about seeing someone outstandingly beautiful on a line, or recognizing an ex years later. We've all met interesting people and had painfully boring introspection while waiting for a latte.

-------------------

The **[2.4]** challenge

Conventions.

I don't mean cultural norms. I mean *conventions*. You know, a bunch of people getting together because they all bond over a shared interest or idea. 

Right now in America we have the Republican convention going on, and next week will be the Democratic one. These are probably the best known conventions in the country.

But every weekend all across the country in civic centers and hotel lobbies people *convene*. 

Southern Baptists, model-railroaders, UFO buffs, comic book lovers, or swingers. They all get together and share a little piece of themselves with each other. For many it's a chance to bond with others over something they obsess about alone. It's a chance for people to come out of their shell, to meet, to talk, and to revel in something they love. It's a place for them to be vulnerable without fear. 

So, what happens when these people get together?

I remember going to the bar for my birthday and how I refused to let you pay for my beer and when I went to the latrine you payed my tab. I remember the bonfire on the beach and sharing a Shiner Bock with you, sharing a taste of our mutual home with you, sharing memories with you. I remember calling you out on your tough girl act, and how you seemed so vulnerable at that point that I couldn't help but apologize. I remember the first time we properly hugged, and our first proper date, and I remember how it was only then that we began to use the other's first name. I remember the Sox game we went to and how we both got silly drunk and shanghai'd your roommate to drive us home. I remember meeting your family, and being scared shitless of your brother, only to find out that I scared him shitless. I remember everything- every cute text, every shooting star, every kiss, every whispered nothing, every dusky glance. And then I remember how it felt when you left, how it was so unfair and how that feeling of life and wholeness I'd come to know went with you. I remember calling you selfish and regretting it immediately and I remember how it didn't matter because it was too late, because you were gone and words cannot be unsaid, even if they weren't heard. I remember how I would have sworn you were calling me at 2 am and how excited I was until I realized that where you are, there's no reception, and even if there was you wouldn't do it in the middle of the night, and I remember the heavy weight of logic crushing tears out of me until I fell asleep clutching the only two possesions in the world I care about anymore.

If you've ever posted a story to /r/1P, you're invited to add your index to the comments below. Read on for instructions on how to do that.

**Instructions:**   
In the reddit search bar, type:

So to come up with *my* index, I'd search for

    reddit:oneparagraph author:blackstar9000

If you want to exclude anything, use the *NOT* operator. To exclude more than one term, use *NOT* and include the terms in parentheses, separating them with the *OR* operator. For example, in my index, I excluded a whole slew of moderator-related terms:

    NOT ([talk] OR [game] OR challenge)

There's actually more than that, but you get the picture. That way, when you click on my index, just about all you'll find listed there are stories.

It was Melissa's Buick. I hadn't seen this pink coupe around town at all since we split up. She rolled down the passenger side window and said, ""Jeremy, you're soaking wet."" I laughed. Fuck's sake, I *laughed,* like it was a day at the fair. She quirked her painted lips down, the way she used to when I told one of my jokes, but to my surprise she didn't take off. ""Come on,"" she said, ""I'll drive you home."" I sauntered up to the door and let myself in, dripping all over the beat-up upholstery. Scent memory transported me into our old apartment, into our bedroom, back to the old days when I would bury my face in her neck and imbibe that knock-off perfume that she swore was vanilla but really smelled like Play-Doh. We sized each other up, looking for signs of prosperity. I found none in her, and I know she saw none in me. I grinned.

Critics never failed to marvel that such spectacular growth was built on nothing more sophisticated than giving contestants a mortifying task, then negotiating the lowest dollar amount they'd accept as payment for performing it on camera.  No amount of moral ambiguity could deter advertisers, even as the stunts turned from humiliating to harmful.  After one contestant on the Gambian edition accepted a mere $17 dollars to drop a cinder block from the roof of an office building into the bustling street below, market analysts predicted the shift of public opinion against the show.  But when the show's producers evaded a guilty sentence in the Gambian court system, the public was jubilant.  That failed prediction, claimed Pollette, showed the extent to which the pundits, too, had been fooled by the show's false premise.

The topic of the dispute was usually unimportant, but that did not stop the disagreements from occurring with the regularity of an alarm clock. But tomorrow would be different, for Billy had a plan. Nights were spent collecting supplies and practicing the execution of his masterpiece on loose-leaf papers. He heard the front door close and suddenly the house was quieted. Now was the time. He took his child paint set and brushes to the living room. Here stood the ultimate canvas for his magnum opus, a painting on the main wall of their stark-white living room showing him and his parents outside of their home, all smiles. Stroke, stroke, dab-dab, stroke, stroke. He continued in this fashion, sweat beading on his forehead as he carefully coaxed the image out of his mind and onto the wall. If his painting was good enough, surely it would bring peace to his cracking household, so Billy made sure to put his soul into every stroke. It was finished, and as a loving father looks proudly upon his son, fully-grown and accomplished, even so did Billy regard his painting with utmost satisfaction. It covered as far as Billy could reach and possessed all the irregular colors and inconsistent proportions of a child's drawing, but to his eye it could be presented along side the Mona Lisa in The Louvre.

I've felt certain misgivings about some of the stories that I've written lately.  Some of them, I suspect, aren't really one paragraph stories.  Take my [most recent contribution](http://www.reddit.com/r/OneParagraph/comments/bhqs4/rapunzel_redux/) (please!).  I wrote it with every intention of making it a one paragraph story, but if I had it to do over again, I'd probably throw in at least one break, like so:

&gt; Maybe because each generation owes a debt to tradition, Caroline also told the story, though not as her mother had told it to her. In the version Caroline passed on to her daughters, Rapunzel poured so much vanity on her hair that she found the notion of turning it to merely useful ends unthinkable. It was the treasure, not she, and so when the prince called, she refused to let it down. The prince was too enamored to relent, though, so he gradually began to build a magnificent castle around the tower, incorporating it so that they could be said to share the same accommodations -- in spirit, for now, and one day, hopefully, in full truth.

&gt; The final element in the design of the castle was a matching tower with traversable arch to bridge the rest of the structure to the original tower, and when the builders at last carved their door into Rapunzel's chamber they found that she had died sometime during the interval. This surprised no one since the construction of the castle had taken decades, and even the prince himself had not lived to see its completion. ""But her hair remained,"" Caroline would conclude, knowing that her mother stood in the hallway eavesdropping, ""and my! wasn't it beautiful, even in death.""

Don't get me wrong.  Given a time machine, I wouldn't go back to yesterday and tell myself, ""Stop!  That should really be two paragraphs.""  Part of what's great about this subreddit is that we get to experiment with the form, and we lose that element if we stop experimenting for fear of failing.  But on reading back over, it *does* seem clear to me that there's a natural break in the action, from ascending to descending, and that it's proper to mark that break with a new paragraph.  Am I wrong about that?

Incidentally, if anyone feels like workshopping that story, here's a challenge for you: rewrite it in such a way that it adheres more closely to the one paragraph rule.  I'm not sure it can be done, but the effort might be revealing.

But the big question I want to throw out here is this: **What are some other circumstances that might naturally call for a paragraph break?**",,False,,t5_2rkb7,False,,,True,t3_bi54j,http://www.reddit.com/r/OneParagraph/comments/bi54j/talk_when_is_a_paragraph_more_than_a_single/,

What I'm really looking for is more original material. The easy thing is murder on a train or someone driving their car to run away from something.

Let's go past that. 

Give me compelling characters. Give reasons they're moving from point A to point B. Don't give me reasons. I'm interested in what ya'll can come up with.

I can either get up, shower, get dressed, and go to school, or I could just stay here, sitting on the line between sleeping and waking. I get up. The bathroom door opens with a groan that sounds like how I feel. Bathroom lights are decidedly brighter than lamps. They glare at me, when I flip them on, and I glare back. I turn the shower on to let it warm up while I stare at myself in the mirror. ""Who are you?"" I ask my reflection, ""Why do you even get out of bed?"" The man in the mirror has no answer, all the while the shower drums on, water beating the bottom of the tub. Those burning, yellow lights highlight the imperfections in my face like somebody editing a rough draft. ""You could be better,"" they whisper to me. I stare sadly into the eyes of this poor man stuck in the glass, turn, and get into the shower. Once I'm done cleaning myself, I leave the bathroom and head back to my room. The lamplight is warm against my eyes like a blanket to cold toes. Very slowly, I get dressed; t-shirt, jeans, socks, shoes. I grab my wallet, phone, and keys, as I head for the front door. To the right of the doorway, my backpack sits, waiting for its chance to burden my shoulders. Grudgingly, I grab it and sling it across one shoulder. My little car rusts in the front yard. It doesn't shine for the ladies, but it does its job. I unlock the door and toss my backpack to the passenger seat, which probably would not appreciate the backpack to the face, if it weren't an inanimate object. My body drops into the driver's seat, and I slide the key into the ignition. Now, I sit again, motionless and still. This is the second half of that moment I was telling you about earlier. Again, I'm faced with a decision: start my car and drive to school like a good little boy, or I could just drive away - from school, from home, from everything. I look at myself in the rear-view mirror. That sad man in the bathroom mirror has followed me out here. Maybe he needs a ride. I look him dead in the eyes and ask, ""Where do you want to go?"" But, once again, the man in the mirror has no answer. Sadly, I look away from the mirror, start my car, and drive to school like a good little boy who secretly wants to disobey.

After the Office, we watched National Geographic. A bloody, battered fish carcass was thrown into the water, and was soon surrounded by ravenous, thrashing sharks. We both agreed that it was gross but sort of cool.

the local pizzeria, run by three brothers, two blocks away, but one continious stretch of sidewalk. Maybe if Mrs.Bay was absent that day and Jacob wasn't assigned any homework
he would have stayed home. Maybe if streets had to be crossed, his mother would have thought
differently than to let her ambitious, bright ten year old go all alone. Maybe if there was even the slightest hint of crime in the neighborhood, she would have been more 
hesitant. But there was no such thing. Not even a pencil was reported missing in the fifteen years Rebecca lived in Portland. The air was fresh, had no bitter taste to it,
no sense that it would allow for a thirsty bee, let alone a bullet, soar through it. But Rebeccas senses only sensed what made sense in her head, and ignored the scent of tragedy that was sent to leave her son dead.

One of the most ancient stories known is *The Epic of Gilgamesh*.  It was written at least four thousand years ago.  It was pieced together by fragments of stone tablets found at several archaeological sites.  Not all of it has been found, but there is enough to follow the story.

It is the story of the king Gilgamesh's friendship with the wild man Enkidu and their adventures together.  At the climax of the story, Enkidu is killed, and Gilgamesh begins a downward spiral into madness in which he roams the world searching for immortality.

Gilgamesh's love for Enkidu is a bond that enriches him during their time together.  It emboldens him to adventure across the world and defeat evil monsters.  Their friendship is his greatest strength.  But when Enkidu dies, that love between them binds him in a different way.  It cripples him.  The once great and mighty King becomes a hollow shell of a man who abandons his kingdom and squanders his life trying to escape his inevitable death.  The ties that bind them together are a double-edged sword.
