1327937349.0,132,self.cincinnati,p32g4,Almost Robbed by Bouncer at Whisky Bar Cincinnati,147,15,131,http://www.reddit.com/r/cincinnati/comments/p32g4/almost_robbed_by_bouncer_at_whisky_bar_cincinnati/,"Plan to visit the new venue, Whisky Bar Cincinnati?  Watch your valuables.  Apparently it's common practice to steal from and bully customers at Whisky Bar, and condoned by the owner.  

Went to the Whisky Bar with the girlfriend on Friday night.  Realized I didn't have my iPhone on me.  Used the Find My iPhone app to play a sound and looked around while the girlfriend asked staff about it.  I caught up with them, and was told one was found.  I was asked my password so that he could go verify it was mine.  Comes back holding an iPhone and says, ""nope this one is not yours.""  Since mine is jailbroken and I have a unique lockscreen, I asked him to push the home button to see if it really wasn't mine.  He said no and held it out of my reach.  I explained that if it were mine I would recognize it.  He still says no, it's not mine and puts it in his pocket.  He then tells me I'm causing a disturbance and I need to leave or will be removed.  The girlfriend and I go to my car.  I use her iPhone to track mine using Find My iPhone app.  I see that it's still at the bar.  I then think of checking my email from her iPhone.  I have the iCaughtU Pro Cydia app, and it snaps a photo, saves it and sends it to my email of anyone typing in the wrong password.  Turns out, I have a photo of the very bouncer who kicked me out.  The girlfriend goes back in to talk to the owner, which she happens to know, and shows him the photo.  She retrieves my phone but the Otterbox Defender case was missing.  I go back in to tell the owner and see if it can be found.  He proceeds to yell at me.  Tells me it must have fallen off and I should just be happy I got my phone back.  :/  Since when is this acceptable customer service?

Photo of the [douche bag](http://i.imgur.com/HWbxr)  This photo was snapped before I even realized I lost my iPhone.  Looks pretty happy with his new find.


EDIT: Addition of possible relevant information.

The theft of the case wasn't the intention.  It was likely only removed so that I wouldn't recognize the phone as mine.

I was dumb enough to give him my password, after which he went to a back office to ""get the phone and see if it was mine.""  

I catch up with him not long after and he says, no the phone is not yours.  I asked him if he'd try the password again in front of me and he pulls the phone out of his pocket and says see, it's not yours.

I asked him to at least just touch the home button, because if it were mine I'd recognize the [lockscreen](http://i.imgur.com/aLksN.png).  He says no, because he's not going to waste anymore time with me and just come back tomorrow to check.

I go back out the main floor to look around again and soon after he is at my side telling me I'm creating a disturbance and that I need to leave.  I said I'm not leaving until I have my phone.  He threatens force and my girlfriend and I exit to my car to continue to track my phone and make it play a sound with the Find my iPhone app 25 times.

Then I think of checking my email with her phone.  I found the Photo.  The girlfriend went in to get the phone and comes back with my phone without it's case and turned off (which is probably why I could never find it by having it make a sound with Find My iPhone app).

I go back in to see if the owner can come up with my case and shamefulness on the owners part ensues and I start recording video.

EDIT: At [1:38](http://i.imgur.com/rsbsU) his photo was taken.  A few minutes later I realized my phone was missing.  From [1:43am](http://i.imgur.com/J91Zh) to 2:09am I used the Find My iPhone app to play a sound on my phone 24 times until I thought of checking my email and the girlfriend went in to get my phone.  At [2:45am](http://i.imgur.com/avv4v) I used the Find My iPhone app to play a sound on my phone 1 more time when I went in to look for my girlfriend when she was taking too long.

Lost on 12/23/2012 - Her name is Sadie.

She's about one year old and weighs ~45lbs. She's almost entirely white with orange flecks through her fur on her back, an orange crescent moon over the base of her tail, with an all white tail. Her head is white, she has two orange ears with one of them stretching down to her eye. Her feet and legs have tiny orange spots. Her legs are also scarred and missing patches of fur where mites and fleas chewed it off when she was a puppy. Her tail is broken into a hook, just at the very tip and hardly noticeable unless you're looking at it closely or feeling it. She is spayed. 

She was an abused rescue and is extremely skittish, not at all aggressive; just scared of everything and everyone. She doesn't respond to treats or food, unless you drop them and walk away. Do not chase or yell, as she will almost 100% run away with even normal behavior. She does not have her tags or collar, she managed to pull out of them on a bathroom break. She isn't yet microchipped either, unfortunately. If you SEE her, please PM me (I'm checking religiously) or call the humane society (Normal hours: 513-541-6100 After hours: 513-825-2280) if you feel as though she has a chance to get away. They're very good at what they do. If you do manage to catch her, she has a tendency to relieve herself if she's frightened or threatened-so keep her off the carpet as it is a reflex and she really can't help it. She's a very sweet and loving dog, she just has a ton of trust issues with humans. 

She escaped in the Mariemont/Madisonville (45227) area. The closest major intersection would be around Plainville and Bramble. 

We're offering a reward if anyone finds our doggie and the reward will be directly exchanged as we pick her up. We just want her home. ]: 

Pictures: http://imgur.com/a/xwOUY#0

*Edit 12/26/12: We haven't found her yet, unfortunately. As all of the shelters and vet offices open after the holidays for at least semi-normal hours, I'm hoping our chances of finding our Sadie improve. I appreciate the extra eyes and the support that's been given, it really means more than I can express. Thank you again. 

*Edit 12/30/12: Still no sign or calls. We've talked with a dog tracker and he seems to think that she's probably hanging out in the wooded area east of our house. We're going to try some humane traps and see what happens if we can locate where she's hanging out. There's also a pack of coyotes at the top of that hill, though. The unfortunate reality is that she could be in a lot of danger. ]: She's not a small dog by any means, but she's still in danger.

EDIT: just wanted to add that the $1 Southbank Shuttle Trolley is how I got around.  Conference was across the river, but I shuttled it over.  I heard that this was a bit of a controversy, b/c it's owned by a Kentucky company.  However this was agreed upon, excellent choice to allow it.  For me, and I'd guess most visitors, it made the trip into Cincy a snap.  Cheaper than a cab, and no need to decipher another city's transit routes.

We did everything we could think of to get the word out and try and find her. About 1:00 am this morning I got a call from a lady (whom I thanked profusely) saying she spotted Sadie, remembered our poster and saw her about 10 minutes ago heading into the woods up the hill from our house. We immediately got dressed, drove up there and took our other dog Diego to help find his sister. She ran away from us at first, but we waited and called her name. About 15 minutes into standing out there we see a big white ball come and roll over on the ground about 50ft in front of us. She ran around us in a circle, came and jumped on her brother and jumped in my lap. She's so skinny, has a ton of burrs stuck in her fur, desperately needs a bath and is absolutely exhausted, but is elated to be home again and passed out on our couch (where she's been for the past few hours). She's getting spoiled special treatment and all the food she wants to eat for a little while.

Thank you everyone! She's home and we're so stupidly thankful she's alright. I really cannot express how much I appreciate all the help and ideas we received from our other post. Thanks for being such an amazing community!

I am asking for a favor /r/Cincinnati. I have had the worst winter of my life. I have lost a pair of grandparents, my job, and liquidated my savings to make ends meet. Through all this my beautiful girlfriend has stood by my side, been a shoulder to cry on, and become a beacon of positive energy that keeps me looking forward to the future. 

A few weeks ago she registered us, probably a bit optimistically, for Cincinnati’s cutest couple. I say optimistically not because I don’t think she is adorable or that we aren’t cute, but because neither of us has thousands of Facebook friends or Twitter followers to skew the scale in our favor.  

The prizes for winning are two iPads and a $2500 gift card to Diamond’s Rock. While an iPad would be so awesome to give her since I wasn’t able to get her a single Christmas present except a cheesy hand made one, what I would really love to do is put a ring on her finger. That Diamond Rock gift card would allow me to turn the best girlfriend in the world into the greatest wife I could ever dream of. I don’t know that there are any words to really say what that would mean to us, to me, so I won’t try. 

The contest is being run by Kiss 107 and the link to vote for us is [here](http://www.kiss107.com/cc-common/contests/photo_contest.php?id=218646&amp;image_id=307053). Can you help /r/Cincinnati?

So if anyone knows of someone who needs a pretty awesome roommate/someone to rent an apartment, here's a copy of my craigslist ad:

Hi! I'm a gainfully employed preschool teacher/daycare cook looking to relocate closer to work. I work full-time, have no pets, never have smoked, no criminal record, am not a scam, and have a monthly veteran's pension that would more than cover my rent/bills/food should anything happen to my job.

I just can't afford moving to West Chester/Mason/Liberty Township on my own right now and would like to save some money.

I have two teenage kids who currently live with their dad (so they can be in the Lakota School District/special needs programs) that would visit me every other weekend. They're respectful, awesome kids. My daughter is high functioning autistic and is pretty quiet. My son is sweet and goofy, mostly just wants to watch anime or play video games ...when we're not out doing family/Fun Mom Weekend stuff. No drama and they'd only be there every other weekend.

I'm quiet, nerdy, artsy and (I'm told) funny. I'm a cook who became a daycare teacher by happenstance. I cook, I don't party, and I pitch in around the house. I'm into computers, movies, anime, comic books, sewing and general geekery.

Text me at (will PM number) or email me at (will PM email address).

I would love to move around the end of March/beginning of April. Thanks!

I can also be messaged on Facebook. https://www.facebook.com/fuzzybluelogic

1371221296.0,46,self.cincinnati,1gc9et,Cincinnati Foodie Bucket List (by Polly Campbell) (Text copied into comment) I like this list very much.,53,7,42,http://www.reddit.com/r/cincinnati/comments/1gc9et/cincinnati_foodie_bucket_list_by_polly_campbell/,"1. Findlay Market

It’s surprising how often I meet people who have never been to Findlay Market, the historic public market in Over-the-Rhine. But it’s a must-visit, a microcosm of eating in Cincinnati. It still has direct connections to its roots as a public market founded in 1855. The preponderance of pork in the butcher cases speaks to German heritage, but also to the Southern roots of the many regular African-American shoppers here. There are the stands run by multi-generational families. But there are also up-and-coming food entrepreneurs who look to it as a place to launch something new. There are plenty of ways in which the market could be shined up, but its well-worn traditions make it a true Cincinnati experience. 1801 Race St., Over-the-Rhine, 513-665-4839, www.findlaymarket.org.

2. Tucker’s

This little diner on Vine Street, not far from Findlay Market, is a true neighborhood gathering place in one of the city’s most colorful and troubled neighborhoods. Just hang out here over eggs and toast, or a veggie burger, watch who comes in, and see how everyone’s on the same footing here and gets the same love from the Tuckers, and you’ll get it. 1637 Vine St., Over-the-Rhine, 513-721-7123.

3. Orchids

As glamorous as you can get in this city -- or many other cities. It’s a peak dining experience: the creative food, the grand French Art Deco atmosphere and the fine service all combine for a knock-out evening. For the cost of two or three far more more mundane dinners you can splurge here and it will be worth it. 35 W. Fifth St., Downtown, 513-421-9100, orchidsatpalmcourt.com.

4. Putz’s

Every time my Jewish father-in-law drove into town via I-74, he was incredulous all over again that there was a place here called Putz’s Creamy Whip. To him, that was a somewhat vulgar pejorative. (Now that people “putz around” it seems fine.) I don’t think we ever actually went there with him, but I’m pretty sure he would have liked the squeaky-clean, summer wholesomeness of the place, where you can get a soft-serve cone with a little smiley face on it, a Par-Fay or a giant float and a foot-long coney and eat it on a picnic table. It’s family Cincinnati. (P.S.: He also couldn’t get over the fact that we had a bank called Fifth Third. ) 2673 Putz Place (at West Fork Road), Cumminsville. 513-681-8668, www.putzscreamywhip.com

5. Surf and Turf at The Precinct 

Jeff Ruby grew up in New Jersey, and you could say that he does not have a Cincinnati style. But the kind of glitz and glamour he generated when he opened his first restaurant found a natural place to thrive here. With his attention to detail, his eye for the big gesture, and his relentless guest-satisfying attitude, he’s one of our big successes. Even at prices that can get up into the $50s and $60s, many Cincinnatians think of a steak here as a good value. Since we’re putting this on a bucket list, get the big filet with bearnaise sauce and crabmeat and -- what the heck -- a lobster tail. 311 Delta Ave., Columbia-Tusculum, 513-321-5454, www.jeffruby.com/precinct.

6. Aglamesis Brothers’ banana split

If you can’t indulge on the level of a steak and lobster tail, you can probably afford to get a banana split at Aglamesis Brothers in Oakley or Montgomery. You’re going to have to share it -- maybe with your sweetheart, sitting in the pink parlor with its old-fashioned counter and stained-glass lamps. They make all the ice cream there, and if a banana split isn’t enough, pick out a selection of hand-made chocolates as you leave. 3046 Madison Road, Oakley, 513-531-5196, 9899 Montgomery Road; Montgomery, 513-791-7082, www.aglamesis.com.

7. Picnic in a park

When my husband and I first moved to Cincinnati, we would combine Saturday morning errands with a lunch we would make or pick up. We would eat it in one of the parks on a list that we were planning to make it all the way through. Thirty years later, we’ve been to most of them, though there are so many that we still have a few to check off. Parks here are a great place to eat. Try lunch in Fountain Square, where the people-watching is good, or a picnic on a blanket in Mt. Echo Park, with its expansive view of the city. It could be an evening picnic in Covington’s Devou Park, a barbecue on a grill in French Park on a nippy October afternoon, or a family reunion in a reserved Hamilton County parks shelter.

8. Oktoberfest

Yes, we’re a heavily German-influenced city. Cincinnati’s more conservative attributes are chalked up to this historic and demographic fact. Which is kind of funny -- because in the 19th and early 20th centuries, the Germans were good-time beer drinkers who scandalized teetotalers and Prohibitionists by drinking beer after church. Oktoberfest is the fun side of being German, when eating comically large cream puffs, drinking comically large amounts of beer, and wearing lederhosen and doing the chicken dance take over the city for a weekend.

9. Beer 

Speaking of German: we had it, we lost it, but we’re getting it back in a big way. Your bucket list assignment is to visit the tap room of one of the local breweries that are finding success in the craft beer world. For extra credit, make a list within the bucket list and drink beer from all of them: Mad Tree, Rivertown, Listermann’s, Mt. Carmel, Blank Slate, 50 West, and Moerlein, which is bringing back some of the old brands and Cincinnati styles.

10. Grippos Bar-B-Q potato chips

Just grab a bag and eat them. Or crush them up and use the crumbs to coat chicken, or put them in meatloaf. Or just get the spice mixture in the shaker and use it as a rub or seasoning. The chips are made on Colerain Avenue by a company still owned by descendants of the founders. It’s not the chips themselves that people love: it’s the barbecue spice. Look on YouTube for kids rapping about that very particular Cincinnati flavor, or on restaurant menus where Grippos are used to fill grilled cheese sandwiches or dust french fries.

11. Farmers markets

The Ohio Valley has some of the best agricultural land on earth. The economics of farming in the 20th century have meant much of it is used for commodity crops -- soybeans and corn -- rather than food we eat directly from the farm. But that’s changing as people realize that tomatoes, strawberries, cucumbers and apples taste great when grown nearby. All you have to do is visit a farmers market to see it. There’s one every day of the week; the one in Burlington is open daily. You will find good Ohio and Kentucky produce, plus small cottage producers of bread, hummus, gelato, cookies, sauerkraut and more.

12. Italian time travel 

One of the great things about Cincinnati is that it’s easy to step back in time here. There are blocks in Covington or Wyoming where you can squint and imagine that it’s 1910. Other direct portals to the past can be found in Italian restaurants. At Pompilios, Scotti’s, Campanello’s, or Sorrento’s, the menu and the decor haven’t changed much over the years. Lesser-known is Rusty’s Ristorante in Deer Park. It’s next door to a bowling alley, and the feel inside is vintage -- maybe the ’50s or ’60s. Order a good stiff cocktail, then the “winterized” mushrooms, covered with a blanket of cheese. I’ve had some delicious chicken livers on toast here, and the clam spaghetti ain’t bad. 8028 Blue Ash Road, Deer Park, 513-793-6881, www.rustysristorantedeerpark.com

13. Terry’s Turf Club / Tom &amp; Chee

I put these together because, thanks to the power of national TV’s food obsession, they are the most likely places that out-of-towners know about. If you’re in some other city and you tell someone you’re from Cincinnati, when they ask if Terry’s is as good as they’ve heard, you don’t want to have to fake it. And you will want to know firsthand whether you can recommend the donut grilled cheese sandwich. (Or the various chip-filled sandwiches: see “Grippos” above.) Terry’s Turf Club: 4618 Eastern Ave., Linwood, 513-533-4222. Tom + Chee: 133 E Court St., Downtown, 513-721-2433; 420 Walnut St., Downtown, 513-381-2433; Newport on the Levee, 1 Levee Way Newport, 859-291-2433; www.tomandchee.com.

14. Vine Street from Central Parkway to 14th Street on a Saturday night 

Where did all these people come from? When did these restaurants open? There’s something of a fairy-tale enchantment about what’s happened in the south end of Over-the-Rhine. Of course, it actually took some doing, a concerted effort by big guns in the city as well as hard-working restaurateurs, and is not without controversy. But it’s thrilling to walk a street of restaurants that weren’t even a concept a few years ago. Every one is locally owned. That’s an accomplishment for this kind of development. If you haven’t been to Kaze or Taste of Belgium, Lavomatic or Abigail Street, or the other bars and restaurants drawing in crowds here, then you don’t know Cincinnati 2013.

15. Japanese in Northern Kentucky

Procter &amp; Gamble is the most influential corporation in town. But if you love Japanese food, you have to be more focused on the fact that Toyota has its North American headquarters an exit away from the Cincinnati/Northern Kentucky International Airport. Much business at Toyota is done in the restaurants Miyoshi, Jo An and Matsuya. That’s great for anyone who loves sushi, ochazuki, zara soba or hirami usuzukuri. Miyoshi: 8660 Bankers St., Florence, 859-525-6564; Jo An Japanese: 3940 Olympic Blvd. #135, Erlanger, 859-746-2634; Matsuya: 7149 Manderlay Drive, Florence, 859-746-1199.

16. Fried fish during Lent at Immaculate Heart of Mary 

We will also accept Our Lady of the Rosary, St. Margaret of York, Holy Cross High School, St. Joseph or the Woodlawn Fire Department, but if you haven’t stood in line to get into a church basement, fire house or veterans hall to eat fried fish and coleslaw and macaroni and cheese, then you haven’t dined in Cincinnati. Or, if you need some fried fish right this minute, pick up some at Alabama Fish Bar at the corner of Race and Liberty. (Get the peppers and onions.)

17. Avril-Bleh Meat Market

One of our great strengths is good butchers. I could mention Wassler’s or Bridgetown Finer Meats or the great Stehlin’s in Colerain Township, where you should get a cottage ham sometime. But Avril’s has the longest pedigree, and surely the longest list of made-in-house specialties. I love their old-fashioned ham, double-smoked bacon, beef metts and olive loaf. The dried beef here makes chipped beef on toast that’s truly worth eating. In a wonderful turn of events, after about 120 years, Avril’s is hip again -- they make sausages and hot dogs for many restaurants around town who do fancy sausage sandwiches. And they set up a grill outside during the summer. 33 E. Court St., Downtown, 513-241-2333

18. Jean-Robert’s Table

A Frenchman comes to Cincinnati for a job at a five-star French restaurant, not sure what he’s getting into and not at all sure about Cincinnati. Over the years, he is embraced and becomes legitimately beloved in town -- crazy hair, heavy French accent and all, and despite legal problems with a former partner. He returns the affection, mentors many of the best chefs in town, and starts a successful charity for (Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS). Now Jean-Robert de Cavel owns his own restaurant, still busy after two years despite a sudden tidal wave of competition Downtown. Kind of a nice Cincinnati love story. 713 Vine St., Downtown, 513-621-4777, jrtable.com.

19. Cincinnati Museum Center’s Rookwood Ice Cream Parlor

You must eat in this little room that is completely covered in cheerful, flower-covered Rookwood tiles in the rotunda of our grandest building. These art tiles were one of Cincinnati’s claims to fame from 1880- 1960. If you want to see where the tiles were made, have a meal at the Rookwood restaurant in Mount Adams, once the Rookwood studio and factory. If you want to see the work of the new, revived Rookwood, dine at Lavomatic, where they line the wall behind the bar.

20. The cheese pocket

Or a cheese crown, or a double-butter coffee cake or schnecken. There are so many favorite coffee cakes from local bakeries that they deserve their own bucket list. (Also, they are made with buckets of butter.) The cheese pocket is yeast cake folded up over a filling of sweetened cream cheese. Get them at Busken, Graeter’s, Servatii, Bonomini Bakery, Wyoming Pastry Shop, or the scattering of independent bakeries still serving neighborhoods.

Asian Food Fest (AFF) is being held this weekend (May 18-19) down at the Banks on Freedom Way behind the Freedom Center next to Paul Brown Stadium.  AFF is a non profit event with all proceeds going towards future Asian cultural events and the charity of choice this year Thrivera.   

Exactly what it sounds like but what makes it unique is that half of the food is what you would recognize at restaurant whereas the other half is homemade authentic Asian cuisine.  There is also going to be local craft beer/Asian Beer, wine, local bands, cultural dances/entertainment, fireworks at 9pm on Saturday, children's games, and some merchandise.    


Sorry for the self promoting post.  We love Cincy (OTR resident) and we are trying to spread our culture through food and cultural entertainment.  Hope you guys can go.  Any questions about AFF (set-up, events, food, beer, etc), post here and I will answer (almost) anything.

1361635413.0,44,self.cincinnati,192zlt,A friend just posted this on FB.,62,18,23,http://www.reddit.com/r/cincinnati/comments/192zlt/a_friend_just_posted_this_on_fb/,"***for those who requested to share from Claire's boutique in regards to the incident involving my daughter Isabella on 2/10/2013...here's the entire summary***

Claire's..... as if it wasn't enough that you wrongfully and admittedly falsely accused my daughter of shoplifting, had her sign a document stating she was banned from your store and Florence Mall for a year without a parent present to oversee this signature, kept her in the display window of your store, crying her eyes out, with a Florence Police officer standing over her.......now.....you are SUING us? Questionable business practices. In that day, witnesses saw you accuse 3 different kids of shoplifting. I wonder if you make more $ in lawsuits than you do in sales. Very sad. Very sad day for my family. My daughter. And now the time and effort it's going to take to deal with this civil lawsuit for $260.50 you are filing against me.

Let me summarize to those reading, what happened on 2/10/2013.

My daughter went to the mall with her friends and her friends mom, Lisa Beeler. Purchased some items at Claire's. My youngest daughter was excited about her purchase and put her new earrings on in the store...to which she was accused of shoplifting, but the receipt verified that her items were purchased. They girls shopped around the mall for a bit then returned to Claire's after asking me if they could get their ears double pierced.

They spoke with one of your employees who told them to pick out earrings and that they needed a parental signature allowing the piercing.

Your assistant manager overheard my daughter saying she was scared. She assumed my daughter was scared of shoplifting. She followed my daughter around, and as my daughter neared the front of your store waiting for the parent to get there, she realized the earrings she had just picked out were in her hands, in full view. She turned around and put the earrings on the rack. 

At this point, your 'assistant manager' approached my daughter and instructed her to pick the earrings back up off the rack. She then stated ""Do you know you just shoplifted?""

The earrings were never concealed, and never removed from the store. There was no intent to shoplift, she had plenty of $, she simply got close to the entry waiting for a parent to witness her getting her ear pierced.

I receive a phone call from your manager who then states that my daughter was caught shoplifting and i need to pick her up.

I explained that this didn't make sense because she had just asked me if she could get her ears pierced, and I said yes....she had plenty of $ and quite honestly, this kid does not steal. I informed this assistant manager that we would be there immediately, and that I will write a letter about the mistreatment my daughter received.

In the meantime, my daughter called me, crying her eyes out, scared out of her mind trying to tell me the story. Her friends and her friends parent were not allowed with her in the store. They had her sitting in the front display window where all of the patrons from the mall and the store could see her.

When I arrived, I saw a Florence Police officer standing over her......and my daughter crouched down in the front window, tears streaming down her face, afraid and alone while other shoppers peered at her....and many many people from outside of the mall and from the 2nd floor watching what was happening.

Upon talking with the assistant manager, she stated that she doesn't believe my daughter stole, but it was her policy to call security when this is suspected.

Florence Mall Security, then had my daughter sign a document stating she was banned from the mall and all surrounding areas for a year. My daughter is only 13 and there was no parent present to approve this signature.

This is the only mall close to us, and one she frequents with her friends and family...imagine the dispair in knowing you are banned from it for a year, for a crime that was never committed.

In front of several witnesses, the assistant manager admitted that my daughter did not steal.

Fast forward to today........

Not only did they harrass and embarrass and interrogate my daughter, they falsely accused her of stealing, put her on display for the whole mall to see for approximately 45 minutes until we arrived...

They took down my husbands information 'in order to verify that he was the parent'.........

And then they filed a lawsuit against us for $260.50.

Unacceptable, and extremely sad.

My daughter has had to deal with being banned from a mall she loved for no reason, the humiliation she endured for no reason, and now her family has to take time out of our work days to deal with the legalities being sent our way.

It is sad to me that your store trains it's employees to harrass and entrap young girls that love your store. It is sad to me that you make money by filing civil lawsuits like this.

The day this happened to my daughter, there were three other kids within those few hours that were also accused of shoplifting.

How many kids per day are being falsely accused of shoplifting, then later sued?

How much $ does Claire's make per day on lawsuits?

This is very disappointing. Very unfortunately. Very tiring. My daughter is a good kid, who does a lot for the community........and now for a year she has this mess hanging over her head for a crime she didn't commit. She doesn't understand and nor do we. We teach our kids to uphold the law, respect their elders and take responsibility for their actions. She did not steal. She did not intend to steal. 

She was tricked by the manager. The manager admitted to all of us that when she overheard my daughter say she was 'scared' she assumed that meant she was scared to shoplift......but later realized after interrogating her that my daughter was scared to get her ears pierced.

Tell me, why would a kid who had been saving her money since Christmas for this shopping trip she looked so forward to steal?

Please train your staff appropriately so other children do not experience the harrassment, humilation and embarrassment my 13 year old daughter received and will remember for the rest of her life.

Shameful Claire's. Shameful. I've never considered boycotting a store before, or spreading the word on the terrible business practices...but this is absolutely unacceptable and sad. A store that I shopped at as a kid, and one that my daughter adored.........poor poor treatment.

Not to mention, my daughter still hears that manager labeling her and referring to her as 'my shoplifter' as she gloated around the store while she sat there, in the front display window, mascara streaming down her face, feeling utterly defeated and frightened while a Florence Police officer stood over her.....for no reason. For no crime. This is something she will remember for the rest of her life.

This past weekend, I met up with a bunch of friends from college in Cincinnati (I now live in Pittsburgh) and had the best time. I totally forgot that the meetup on Saturday was at Neon's, but that didn't matter because we ended up going to Neon's by chance! It was incredible to see so many Redditors there - I love that bar anyways, but quite the amazing site.

So, the purpose of this post is just a public exclamation that I really, really miss Cincinnati and I continue to be amazed at how the city has worked hard to offer more and more to its citizens. When I get back there, as my wife and I are planning on doing eventually, I can't wait to attend the Meetup as a Cincinnatian and see all of you.

You all rule - enjoy the city while you are there. There is so much to do and the people are really, really great. You're all very lucky to be there - it's hard to remember when you've adjusted to living somewhere, but just trust me. You've got a hell of a city.",,False,,t5_2qt1k,False,,,True,t3_vl6x1,http://www.reddit.com/r/cincinnati/comments/vl6x1/visited_cincinnati_this_past_weekend_and_had_a/,

**Hey you guys!** You like board games, I like board games. You like wine, I am wine. You like yourselves, and I like you all even more! We should get together and celebrate these things!

**WHO:** You! Maybe a couple of your friends! Maybe a small zoo animal you've...acquired (Red pandas are the key to my heart, for all you interested ladies). *If you have an opinion about underage Redditors attending this meetup, [voice it!](http://www.reddit.com/r/cincinnati/comments/yv2wp/september_meetup_board_games_for_bored/c5z80pn).*

**WHEN:** SATURDAY, SEPTEMBER 15th, 8:00PM.

**WHAT:** A wide variety of board games. Also, booze will ~~probably~~ happen (including some homebrewed goodness.) If you hate fun, there will be corners for you to stare at. Something for everyone.

**WHERE:** 2310 Flora St. butterfree666's ""big box"" in Clifton. (thank him with presentz if you want)

**WHY:** Because we're more socially functional than you might expect! Because WaitDontGo is totally buying you a drink (legally, too!) Because we're not all that great at Madonna-themed bar trivia, apparently. 

I know we had a planning thread before, but now that September's right around the corner, let's start setting it into more stone, eh?

**TL;DR: board games and booze on September 15th, held at butterfree666's Clifton box. You should really come.**

**What We've Got and What We Need**

* I can bring Apples to Apples, Scrabble, and Settlers of Catan. Also a rainbow cake and some boozes.
* Welchy111 is bringing Munchkin. 
* comment23 can bring Cards Against Humanity (home-made edition)
* awxomecross514 is bringing homemade beer. Yeah. Holy shit, right?
* tomitone is bringing Ticket to Ride and Power Grid.
* genericname12345 has [a metric shit-ton of games](http://www.reddit.com/r/cincinnati/comments/yv2wp/september_meetup_board_games_for_bored/c5z7dok) and needs feedback on what to bring!

I helped set a lot of the stuff up and helped out in the brewing process a little bit so far. 

DISCLAIMER: I just work there. I wasnt asked to do this and I dont speak officially for them. I've just seen some questions posted around and thought i would try to help answer them in one place. 

MUG CLUBS:
Mug Club; $30 a year. you get to use a special 22oz mug we keep at the bar (everybody gets the same, not your own special one). You basically get to buy 22oz beers for the price of 16oz for Moerlein beers only. You also get a $10 gift card for your next visit, invites to monthly tappings, discounts in the gift shop (yes we have one!), special news updates, etc.

Old Jug Society; This one is intense. $395 gets you all of the above PLUS invites to private beer dinners and a specially commissioned Rookwood Pottery stein($250 value) that you can keep in your own private locker at the Lager House. I have pictures of these I will upload later, they are beautiful. This is capped at 250 or 350 people per year, I forget which. It will fill up though, we've already had a few dozen people try to purchase it. You should be able to buy it Monday. There are a few more benefits to both, but those are the main ones.

DRAFT BEERS:
Christian Moerlein; OTR, Bock, Northern Liberties, Lager House, Barbarossa, Hudy Amber + 2 seasonals(seasonals not on yet). Also note that even though we have CM beer in house it is not the beer that has been brewed there yet. We started brewing last sunday and were still at least a week out from having the first brew ready to serve.

Guest Taps;
Dogfish 60 minute, Bells 2 hearted, Victory Prima Pils, Left Hand Milk Stout, Founders Breakfast Stout, Chimay Blue, Duchess de Borgone, Rivertown Hop Bomber, Fullers London Pride

EDIT: Added current draft beers, disclaimer, &amp; mug club info.

The warrant-less wiretapping. I fear that if we dilute the message then we risk not getting our point across.

Basically, I was hanging out with my friends and we decided to check this place out. Turns out it was a *fantastic* idea. It's an internet/gaming cafe and it's pretty great. The manager was great to talk to, and everyone there in general was just all around friendly. They do charge to play games obviously, but have a good collection and also have a great selection of smoothies and coffees to choose from (many named after Nintendo properties, such as smoothies called 'Metroid' and 'Mario Sunshine', which is just the 'mario' smoothie, but with coconut and pineapple added, how awesome is that?) 

The place has been around now since ~March, apparently, but the guy said they've had trouble getting traffic in, and I can see why, I mean, I've never heard of the place before tonight (it's fairly obscure and tiny) and it was pretty great. Me and some friends may go back next week some time to play some TF2 together on their gaming PCs.

Anyway, anyone else heard of this place before? Like I said, new to me, thought I'd share if anyone was into that.

My friend John recently had a stroke and is in bad shape. He's only in his 30's and he's battling quite a bit as he regains his health and spirit. In the meantime, a situation has arisen. John's best friend and loyal companion of 11 years, Asia, was placed with another family while John recovers. This new family neglected to inform the landlord and now Asia must leave her current residence TOMORROW, October 2nd. I need a miracle for my friend. Asia deserves to be in a home and not in a shelter. She's already shaken up by the loss of her home and owner, and now the prospect of a shelter is overwhelming. John is willing to pay $150 a month for someone to board and care for Asia. Hopefully, when John is back to 100%, he and Asia can reunite. For now though, she needs a warm, loving home. Please have compassion for John and Asia in their times of need. Asia is an affectionate, loving dog. She is a mutt, but loves other pets and children as well. She's housebroken as long as you don't neglect letting her out for extended stretches. She can also open a fridge, so a $2 child safety latch may be in order, as well as a covered trash can. With the recent moves, she has gotten a bit anxious and curious about her new surroundings, but once you get accustomed to one another, the joy, love, and companionship is unprecedented. Again, John will pay $150 a month to cover food, toys, your time, whatever you feel necessary to enjoy your time with Asia. Please have a heart. Ask a friend. Please help me make this happen. John is troubled enough just getting his health back and the stress of finding a home for Asia hasn't been helping. So please, I am searching for the kindness of a stranger to help my friend and his dog. You can call John at XXX-XXX-XXXX Please give an AWESOME dog a chance to thrive in her golden years. Thank you. (If you search Asia Possman on Facebook, she has a webpage there...sorry) 


UPDATE....

Asia has been placed.  John asked me to personally thank everyone who sent in offers and is happy he can focus on his therapy and rehabilitation.  He's had a stressful day and sounded so relieved to have Asia safe until their reunion in a month or so (hopefully if John keeps kicking ass!).  Also my faith in the kindness of strangers and the goodness in humanity has been restored, and my cynicism and normal negativity has been replaced by warm fuzzy feelings about the great folks that offered to help a stranger in a serious time of need.  May good fortune return to you a thousand fold.   Asia, John and ""Team Re-Home"" are humbled by your generosity and kind spirit.

Story is: a team of football players were on there way to a fooball game and the bus flipped over the cliff.And from what was told if you turn your car off and put it in neutral and flash your lights 3 times the team of football players will come put and push your car up the hill about 10 inches.

The GPS location is 39.085719,-84.52975, Near Devour Park. 

I went to this location the other day, put the car in neutral and the car did move forward and apparently up the hill. (Secret: This is an optical illusion and the slope is actually downhill) The slope is not much and the experience was kinda disappointing, but the sides of the road were covered in the yellow flowers we see everywhere now. It made for a beautiful photo.

Hi folks, 

I volunteer over at the Ohio Alleycat Resouce (OAR) shelter and last night someone stole an air conditioner unit.  We've all been working hard to keep the little ones cool as we're trying to keep cool with a portable A/C unit for the time being.  

Since we are going to have to not only buy a new unit, we also are going to move it to the roof (so it's incredibly more difficult to take).

If you want to help us, we could really use donations to offset the cost.

While walking today through Over The Rhine I stumbled upon an 8GB Micro-SD card on the sidewalk. With no one around to claim it, I grabbed it up and took it home to investigate.

At best, I thought it would be empty or perhaps broken, so it would either be trash, or a free extra 8GB to tote around data on. If there was any data on board to indicate who it belongs to, I'd get it back. (Such data could be found if there was a document such as schoolwork, etc.)

At worst, I figured I'd better check it out in case something highly illegal was on it.

SO, drumroll please, I loaded it up on the Hackbook Pro, a sterile environment in case the card was corrupted or had a virus on it, etc... And what did I find?

It's a data card from an Android phone, chock full of photos and self-shot pornographic videos of the fella and his... Uh... Baby Mama. Okay, before you downvote me for that, this guy is straight up out of a gangster rap video. Tattoos all over talking about how many people he's hurt, etc. gang affiliation all over the board on this dude. Probably a low level drug dealer if I have to guess. Platinum or silver teeth, lots of jewelry, etc.

When I get back home I'll post some photos (SFW) from the disk on IMGUR and put a reply to this.

I'm not sure what the Reddit rules are to this, as far as posting data that isn't necessarily yours, but the way I think of it, I found the card so the data is therefore mine.

Consider this the official planning thread.  By Thursday this week, I'd like to have things pinned down.  Because this is reddit (and I've met enough of you at other meetups/drinkups to know what we enjoy), the meetup needs to include drinking at some point.  This doesn't need to be the focus of the event, but it's inevitably going to end up at a bar later in the evening, even if it doesn't start there.  I have no way to know the age breakdown of the active redditors in Cincinnati, but I assume there is a not insignificant number of sub 21 redditors who want to do something, so whatever we decide should be inclusive for at least part of the day!

Of the ideas previously posted, starting in a park making some food and maybe playing some cornhole and other outdoor picnic stuff, then moving to bars after a few hours seems like a popular idea that doesn't prohibit any redditors from joining in.

As a way to promote our animals and find them homes, I was wondering how r/cincinnati would feel about regluar posts featuring one or two of our adoptable animals.  

Basically, I would like to highlight some of our dogs and cats to help them get adopted.  Posts would include a picture, bio, age, what kind of household might be the best fit, or anything else people would like to see.  I don't want to be too spammy, so I want to tailor the frequency and content to that you guys would like to see (assuming the community is open to this at all).  

So I guess it boils down to a couple of questions:

* Would the community be into this?  It *would* involve cute pictures...

* If so, how often? Once a week, every two weeks, once a month?

* Is there any specific info you want included?

* One pet at a time, or one dog and one cat at a time?

So, r/cincinnati, what do you think?

**Edit:**  Thanks so much for the feedback and support, guys.  It's really awesome to see!  Most of you don't hate the idea of a weekly post, so I'll start with that just because it's easiest to remember to do, but if it gets to be too much just let me know and we can cut it back to biweekly.  Fridays seem ideal to me, so I'll try to get to first one out next week.  You guys rock.

Katrina is a ~5 year old, ~40lb, spayed and UTD gorgeous shepherd/chow mix. She was adopted at 5 months old and has lived with my cousin and her family until late last week. She is a wonderfully mellow girl who is content to lie at your feet for hours upon end, but who also loves a good long hike through the woods or a swim in the pond. She would do just as good in an apartment as she would on a farm. She is extremely well behaved and knows basic commands—she loves to please her humans. She whines a bit in the crate because she loves being around people so much she simply can't stand it, but is otherwise fully crate trained, and would probably do just fine if not crated at all.  She pulls a bit on the leash at times but has responded wonderfully to the Easy-Walk Harness that she is currently being walked on. She’s a bit hesitant around new people, especially men, but she’s easily won over and once you have her trust she is incredibly loyal and protective. She would make a wonderful guard dog. She has grown up with a now 5 year old little girl and is used to being poked and prodded by sticky little fingers.  She pays no mind to the cats or the smaller dog, but got into her third serious altercation with another large dog in the home last week and was almost put down before I stepped in and brought her home. Due to this, she absolutely must be an only dog or go to a multi-dog home with *lots* of dog experience!  

I've emailed about a thousand rescues and plastered her all over my Facebook, but I just want to cover all my bases and get her as much exposure as I can.  She's staying in our spare room for now, separated from my three dogs, and is getting quite lonely in there by herself.  My boyfriend has given me three weeks to find her a new home and then I must return her to my cousin, who's husband will undoubtedly have her put to sleep.  

If you think you or anyone you know might be interested in adopting Kat, shoot me a PM and I'd be happy to give a more detailed history on her as well as the events that lead to this poor girl not having a home.  I'm also looking for leads on any rescues that may be able to take her in!

This is because I like intrigue and mystery. Sorry for those who were frazzed because of this silliness.

Anyway, DEETS:

* **WHERE: 2310 Flora St. In Clifton.** Parking might be a tiny bit difficult with the UC football game that night as well, so try to carpool/bike/walk/bus/scooter your way over if you can. (I'll be coming from the East Side, and would be glad to split rides.)

* **WHEN: TOMORROW (Sat, Sept. 15). 7:30? 8:00?** Don't come before 5 or 6, essentially. Probably not before 7, either, because I'm not sure how many of us can be there that early. The sooner you get there, however, your chances of getting some really great free beer from me/whoever else brings libations are much higher.

* **WHAT: Board games, drinking, mistakes.** Come one, come all. Bring drinks for attendees, *bring tokens of appreciation for our hosts,* bring stolen red pandas for me. If you said you'd bring a game or a booze or a booze game, you should bring it. If you didn't volunteer to bring anything, it'd still be awesome if you did! (But no pressure)

* **WHY SHOULD I GO?** Because I'm practically bribing you with friendship and booze and board games and (if I can find the time to make it tonight) *rainbow cake*, for heaven's sake.

* **WHAT HAPPENS WHEN BUTTERFREE666 AND HIS ROOMMATES KICK US OUT?** We find a nearby watering hole. Fries has been suggested.

* **WHAT IF I HAVE MORE QUESTIONS?** You should post them as a comment reply so that other people with similar questions can give you free karma.

- Currently climbing 5.8/5.9
