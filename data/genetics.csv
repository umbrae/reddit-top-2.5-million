1370880972.0,37,self.genetics,1g1vqr,GMO vs Organic: Do Geneticists agree?,43,6,54,http://www.reddit.com/r/genetics/comments/1g1vqr/gmo_vs_organic_do_geneticists_agree/,"I am working on a B.S. in Biology and plan to go to grad school and eventually get a PhD in Molecular Genetics. I really want to be a genetic engineer and read a lot about it in my free time. However, I used to work on an organic farm before studying Genetics. With my time studying genetics I think that GMOs are a great way to improve farm yields in less developed countries and increase nutrition as well. While everything has its ups and downs, I have been slammed recently for using my knowledge of science (and my University's access to free academic journals) to support GMOs as opposed to the large corporate organic farms. The literature that I find published in academic journals often overwhelmingly shows that GMOs are safe and that makes sense, seeing as we have been eating them for thousands of years (corn, chicken, tomatoes all are transgenic organisms) and that we have Pancreatic DNAse to break down the transgenic gene just like we would metabolize any DNA from cells we ear (fruit, vegetables, meat, etc).

However, the media, many websites that show up on google searches, and books/documentaries that have no scientific citations on the issue are increasing in popularity and causing the issue to become blown out of proportion (in my opinion), often with a lack of respect for the science put into the safety and sustainablilty of GMOs. 

I was wondering what other geneticists though about this issue? I could not find anything on here yet that discussed/debated this issue.
I feel that there is mostly a consensus between geneticists that GMOs are not as harmful as the uninformed public thinks they are, but I was curious to hear from some genetics redditers.

1353625103.0,19,self.genetics,13n2s4,Big Bad Monsanto,24,5,14,http://www.reddit.com/r/genetics/comments/13n2s4/big_bad_monsanto/,"I happened across an old article tonight about how evil and destructive Monsanto is. It reminded me about an argument I had a few years ago about GM. Some guy sitting next to me in college told me about how Monsanto sued a farmer in Canada called [Schmeiser](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monsanto_Canada_Inc._v._Schmeiser) because his field was accidently contaminated by a small amount of GM seed. I had to concede the point and admit that was terrible. I looked it up later and it turns out Schmeiser intentionally planted his field with Monsanto seed, so that &gt;95% of the crops were GM. Seems like a fairly cut-and-dry case of patent violation.

So I started looking for other reasons Monsanto and GM are evil. A Reddit article calling Monsanto the most evil corporation in the world linked to [this article](http://endthelie.com/2011/07/10/the-worlds-largest-human-experiment-gmos-roundup-and-the-monsanto-monstrosity-part-one-2/) and about how toxic RoundUp herbicide is. Which I accept I suppose, even if the author confuses toxic herbicide with toxic GM crop, and that [virtually all herbicides are toxic](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herbicide#Health_and_environmental_effects). It could still do with more independent research though.

People seem to be most irate at the idea Monsanto of suing farmers whose fields were accidently contaminated by their crops however. There's certainly ample Google results for it. The thing is, I can't find any objective reference to them. Google is so flooded with indignant blogs with names like [CorpWatch](http://www.corpwatch.org/article.php?id=11796) and even articles from reputable media. Here's one from [CBS News](http://www.cbsnews.com/8301-18563_162-4048288.html);

&gt;""74-year-old Mo Parr is a seed cleaner; he is hired by farmers to separate debris from the seed to be replanted. Monsanto sued him claiming he was ""aiding and abetting"" farmers, helping them to violate the patent. 

&gt;""There's no way that I could be held responsible,"" Parr said.

But that's not what the [court documents say](http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=10716318230859406779&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=2&amp;as_vis=1&amp;oi=scholarr) (check out the ""Finding of Fact"", it's quite short). Parr expressly states he refutes Monsanto's patents and encouraged others to replant saved seed, against their licencing agreement, despite receiving a cease-and-desist letter from Monsanto.

Apparently, an average of 11 suits are filed by Monsanto every year and only 11 in total have gone all the way, all being found in [Monsanto's favor](http://www.monsanto.com/newsviews/Pages/saved-seed-farmer-lawsuits.aspx) (reference is the Monsanto website but I reckon those facts are pretty undeniable).

So, question remains, why all the hate? I know crops sold to Indian farmers were [unreliable](http://www.hindu.com/2009/08/25/stories/2009082554841400.htm), although this was at least partly due to drought conditions. Still, maybe farmers should have been more adequately informed about the crop's increased susceptibility to drought, if that's the case. I know they made Agent Orange, which was a seriously harmful substance. They should absolutely face the consequences for that. As should [Dow Chemical](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agent_Orange#Vietnamese_victims_class_action_lawsuit_in_U.S._courts), who are equally responsible and don't seem to garner the same vitriol. On the topic of proportional anger, let's not forget [Union Carbide and Bhopal](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bhopal_disaster), [Nestle](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nestl%C3%A9#Controversy_and_criticism) or [the Nazis](http://www.cracked.com/article_15767_third-reich-to-fortune-500-five-popular-brands-nazis-gave-us.html).

I'm not saying Monsanto are good or pleasant. I'm not agreeing with the overarching concept of corporatism. But all this hate directed at Monsanto seem to be the result of general dissatisfaction with negative capitalism combined with vague anti-GM sentiment and misinformation. Maybe I'm wrong, but it doesn't matter how many blogs agree with you if none of them cite the original, objective facts. It's not like there aren't corporations that don't objectively deserve your ire. And you can keep targetting genetics if you want. Look at [Myriad Genetics](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myriad_Genetics) and what they're trying to do with the BRCA genes.

There were a decent number of responses indicating interest, so I figured we could give this a shot.  

Since I don't really know what kind of crowd we have in here, I just kind of made up this approach as I went along.  We can definitely change it up in the future.  But for now, this is what I thought we could try:

1) I picked a paper.  I chose one from PLoS Genetics because they're open access, so anyone should be able to access it.  The paper is [Analysis of the 10q11 Cancer Risk Locus Implicates MSMB and NCOA4 in Human Prostate Tumorigenesis](http://www.plosgenetics.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pgen.1001204).  I also like PLoS Genetics because they have an abstract (that is supposed to be) written in layman's terms - their Author Summary.  So I thought that could help make it more accessible to any amateur geneticists we might have in here.  

2) I figured we could take this slow and mainly discuss general questions people have about the article at first.  So if you don't know a lot about genetics, now's the time to ask!  If you don't understand parts of the paper, ask here, and the more experienced members will try to answer questions as best as we can.  So, let's say we'll have a kind of a general Q&amp;A period until the end of the day on Monday (12/6, whatever time zone you're in). 

3) Then, maybe Tue-Thurs next week we can discuss the paper's strengths and weaknesses, implications for future research, etc.  

I can kind of help facilitate it this round, and then if people seem to like the idea of a journal club in general, someone else can volunteer to pick a paper and facilitate the next time around.  And he/she can totally change the format and everything - like I said, I'm mostly making it up as I go along this time.  

One note - since this whole process might take awhile, I recommend that people save this post or bookmark it or something.  Even if it makes it to your personal frontpage at some point, it'll probably vanish quickly, as this subreddit isn't exactly hopping with activity.  And, not to karmawhore or anything, but upvotes would help, too.  ",,False,,t5_2qi3y,False,,,True,t3_efdmc,http://www.reddit.com/r/genetics/comments/efdmc/rgenetics_journal_club_paper_1/,

My wife and I did 23andMe and got back some strange results. 

My wife got hers back and her haplo group is Native American. This came as a big surprise since she looks very European and her family doesn't have any record of Native Americans in her immediate tree. Her ""ancestry composition"" is 99.5% European, per the Genetic background report. My question is: how does a haplo group work with her ancestry composition if they don't really match? Any literature or links pointing to some additional reading would be appreciated, if any of you have anything handy.

My own background is also super strange. My family is all from Iran, yet, I seem to have some Finnish genetics in my Ancestry Composition. Finnish as in, from Finland. Does this mean that somewhere in my background, one of my blood relatives was a Finnish person?

The have now spoken to the local genetics expert. She said that she was surprised that test even showed the deletion since the deletion is so small, but due to a lack of data and research its very difficult to say what effect, if any, this will have on our child. She said that she simply didn't know, but based upon her reading the effects were likely to be mild? However this is not the definitive answer we were hoping for, and what does 'mild' mean?

We are now aware that deletions on the short arm of chromosome 5 can result in Cri Du Chat Syndrome, and that this can be a very severe condition, however we are unsure as to whether out relatively small deletion will result in this? We are both confused and frightened about this, and we sadly we don't feel we have enough evidence to make sense of this situation.

Therefore if there are any genetics experts out there that can help us make sense of this, then we'd be eternally grateful!

He said at one point that DNA is very tightly wrapped around the histone octamers, so tightly, in fact, that the side that is pressed up against the protein is inaccessible to RNA polymerase. This means, therefore, that it can not be transcribed. However, I was under the distinct impression that RNA polymerases are able to loosen histones as they go. I know that they bind to promoters located in linker regions between histones, so don't talk about that. What I don't understand is what happens when it gets to the histone. Does it push all the histones in front of it until the gene ends? This seems unlikely. Does it loosen them up and get around? This seems plausible. Or can it not loosen them and does the RNA polymerase...fall off? I don't even know what to think.

In other words, extroverts need MORE dopamine to get the same effects from it!

More interestingly, this gene is more common in Nomadic people, people who would have lead more dangerous lives, in more hostile conditions, and which necessitated them to move around frequently, always in search of resources and shelter. 

From the [article](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dopamine_receptor_D4#48-base_pair_VNTR):

&gt; The 7R allele appears to have been selected for about 40,000 years ago.[7] In 1999 Chen and colleagues[10] observed that populations who migrated farther in the past 30,000 to 1,000 years ago had a higher frequency of 7R/long alleles. They also showed that nomadic populations had higher frequencies of 7R alleles than sedentary ones. More recently it was observed that the health status of nomadic Ariaal men was higher if they had 7R alleles. However in recently sedentary (non-nomadic) Ariaal those with 7R alleles seemed to have slightly deteriorated health.

Amazing!

I'm going to incorporate some of this new computer knowledge towards scientific research and eventually return to school to pursue a PhD. Luckily enough, I've met this professor online who was kind enough to let me in on some of his projects to help him where I can. The problem I'm running into however is that I'm rusty as hell.

What I'm asking everyone here is if they know of any good quality genetics courses for the more advanced crowd. There are a ton of courses labeled ""genetics"" on iTunes U, and that's great, but just finding the right one could be a very time consuming task in itself.

I've recently been devouring books on evolutionary biology, which inevitable talk a fair bit about molecular genetics and related fields.  I'll tell you what, I'm absolutely GRIPPED by it.  So so fascinating.  One thing has left me scratching my head though.  

My question is regarding the crossing-over process during meiosis. 

So you have your two chromosomes, one from mum and one from dad.  They then undergo crossing over before being split up at recombining (these details I'm a little fuzzy on but that's not really the crux of my question - learning this stuff comes next!)

So in the example I'm thinking about, crossing over involves a section of the father chromosome swapping places with the equivalent section in the mother chromosome.  Alleles that were on the section from the father chromosome are therefore now combined with those from the mothers chromosome, thus creating a new combination of alleles. 

Right so far?

Now, lets say for the sake of argument that the length of code for a specific allele is a few thousand letters long... what happens when, during crossing over, the chromosome splits in the MIDDLE of that section of code?  Say you have the mother allele for blue eyes and the father allele for green eyes (I know this probably is a very simple example, but for the sake of argument...).   If the allele splits in the middle of the relevant coding regions, after recombination you'll end up with half-blue, half-green allele on the same leg of new chromosome?  Would this section of DNA in general be viable?  Or would the manifested phenotype just be determined by the equivalent section of code on other chromosomes other leg (arm? what do you call the two bits of a chromosome?!) 

I hope this makes sense... my knowledge of the terminology is skant to say the least, but hopefully I've conveyed my query enough that someone might be able to help!

It's obvious when you look at me that I'm mixed, but I recently was told by a loved one that they have wondered if my father is my father--I look and act nothing like anybody on that side of the family.

There's a good reason/context to why this came up, so that's not my question. She feels horrible for putting it in my head but it's something that's crossed my mind before.

So my question is, does this just happen? We have a similar dimple in our legs when we stand that all the men in my family have. Our mouth impressions (from braces) look identical, both with unusually high roofs in our mouths (dentists comment on it all the time).

I think our heads are similarly shaped--flat in the back--too.

I'm starting to have doubts now though, bc my mom lied to my older half-brother (39) about who his father was. She told him it was the same as my oldest half brother but it turns out that wasn't true. Regardless, the timeline and everything seems to fit me perfectly.

The other strange thing is that I'm 6'1, my dad is 5'7 and my mom is 5'4.

I would love to hear some feedback on this from anyone that knows something about genetics, because I have a lot of anxiety right now.

So after years of mistakes and switching majors I think I've finally decided what I want to do. Went from a math major, to chem ed, to regular chemistry, to nursing and now I think I've finally found something I'm actually passionate about.  Realized it through a class about the technological singularity of all things, but it finally clicked and I'm almost positive this is what I want to do. It actually feels right unlike all the other majors I was doing just because I had to do something.

I started school at a public school in Illinois, but financial issues caused me to have to drop out and move all the way down to Florida. I took a year off to establish residency and buy a car. Now at 22 I'm finally back in school.  First question my grades at my first school weren't that great because of all the family, financial issues, and perhaps from a bit too much partying in college. ;)  My gpa was about a 2.4.  The new school I'm going to isn't really as good of a school as I would have liked, but it's another public university and it was one of the best schools within driving distance from my parents house, which I'm staying at right now to save money. It's still almost an hour away.  GPA doesn't transfer to the school, so it starts all over, but the old grades would still be on my transcript.  I'm assuming I'll probably have to go to grad school.  How much would these schools look at the former gpa?  

I know I need to get some lab experience, and I'm totally okay with it being unpaid.  Where are good places to look for lab experience that would help me obtain a job in genetics.  I tried googling things but there don't seem to be any genetic related labs near where I live. I have a meeting with my counselor, so I'll talk to her about it. But, I don't really expect her have much information for me.  Most of my classes right now are trying to catch up on gen eds, since the curriculum at this school is different, so there isn't really a science teacher at the school I could ask yet. Would any chem or bio lab research be good? Or, should I definitely try to find something more related to what I want to do?  There's a few hospitals around here would those be a good place to ask?

Also the school I'm going to doesn't have an actual genetics major.  So I was thinking bio major with a chem minor?  Or is there something that would be better than that? Obviously I would try to take a lot of genetics related classes for electives.

So basically if someone can give me a bit of a roadmap of what the best way to go about this is it would be extremely appreciated.  No one I know has any experience with science or even medicine, so I've just been trying to do research online.  Thank you so much to anyone that actually reads this post!

TLDR;

1. As a transfer student how much do grad schools look at the previous schools GPA?
2. Where are good place to look for research jobs?
3. Is chem or bio research sufficient, or should I try to find something more related to genetics?
4. Is a bio major with a chem minor an alright substitute if my school doesn't offer genetics?
5. How important is grad school to find a job? Is there a big difference in salary?",,False,,t5_2qi3y,False,,,True,t3_11qj0l,http://www.reddit.com/r/genetics/comments/11qj0l/i_think_i_want_to_become_a_genetic_engineer_help/,

I am in a relationship with a girl who I love very much - in fact, the first girl I have met whom I could actually see myself starting a family with. Every time I picture our hypothetical future together however, I keep thinking about her genetics (yeah, so I'm a hopeless romantic).

She has two brothers - one with ADHD and one with Aspergers. As a result they are both very developmentally impared. Her father has two sisters, both of whom are developmentally impared to the point of requiring help with daily tasks. I'm not sure of the particular syndrome; the physical traits have the appearance of Downs, however.

As far as my girlfriend goes, she has been fairly lucky, considering. She was diagnosed with Hirschsprung's disease (HD) as a child, and has had part of her lower intestine removed as a result, however this does not affect her in any significant way. I have done a bit of research on HD, and it seems that the affected gene is the same gene responsible for Down's syndrome. So I guess my first question is - how much of an indicator is HD of potential genetic problems in offspring (e.g. Downs)?

My main question, however, is the likelyhood of having developmentally impared children. I know this probably takes a genetic councilor to resolve properly, but I thought I would throw it out there anyway. As much as I love my girlfriend, and as much as I hate to admit it to myself, I'm not sure how well I would handle being a father to severely developmentally impared children.",,False,,t5_2qi3y,False,,,True,t3_osof6,http://www.reddit.com/r/genetics/comments/osof6/how_likely_am_i_to_have_normal_offspring/,

Since women has got two X chromosomes, they'd have to be homozygote to get the disease, However:

I recently learned that women has one of their X-chromosomes inactive in every cell ([Dappled female cats](http://shadowstarsden.webs.com/mystra_cat_white_orange_black.jpg)  is an example of this, the X-chromosomes carries different genes for hair-color). Which X-chromosome goes inactive varies, and is apparently random. The shut-down of one of the X-chromosomes in every cell happens when the fetus is 3 weeks old (at a diameter of aprox 0.2 mm). Every daughter-cell has the same active X-Chromosome as their mother-cell. This leads me to my question.

Would it be possible for a woman with only one of her x-chromosomes diseased to still get colorblind, if all of the cones in her eyes had the infected X-chromosome active? 

As a follow up question, Would it be possible for a woman to have one colorblind eye, and one healthy one?

1359399444.0,8,self.genetics,17fygu,Could someone explain why this is the accepted technique for introducing mutations into my yeast strains?,11,3,0,http://www.reddit.com/r/genetics/comments/17fygu/could_someone_explain_why_this_is_the_accepted/,"I have been out of lab for a few months for various reasons, and I just got back today. However, the logic behind the following sequences of experiments/reactions/techniques seems a bit unclear to me, and it's driving me crazy.

So, say we have 2 strains of yeast. Strain 1, and Strain 2. Strain 1 has 3 of the 4 mutations I want, and Strain 2 has the other mutation, but with the wrong marker. So, to get a strain of yeast with all 4 mutations, I do as follows:

Find the plasmid with the marker I want Strain 2 to have. PCR this plasmid (it has loxP sites flanking the marker I want). Transform this PCR product into Strain 2 to get mutation 4 with the appropriate marker. PCR the knocked out gene just created in Strain 2, and transform Strain 1 with the PCR product from Strain 2. You now have ""Strain 3"" - essentially just Strain 1 with an added mutation that has the desired marker.

Why is this the chosen methodology? The best I could come up with is as follows:

1)PCR the plasmid because you want a different marker - this plasmid has the marker you need.

2)Transform this PCR product into the yeast strain that has *only* the mutation of interest, but simply has the wrong marker. Transforming the plasmid product into a strain with multiple mutations could cause the loxP sites to pop in/pop out a marker in the wrong gene/mutation of interest.

3) PCR the yeast strain you just placed a new marker into.

4) Take PCR product from (3) and transform it into the strain with many mutations. Because the 2 strains are the same background (barring any mutations), homologous regions will guide the PCR product (a knocked out gene) to the proper location (even though the gene is *not* knocked out in the strain you are transforming?), and recombination will occur, knocking out the gene in the strain you are transforming.

I googled, called other breeders, and asked in /r/rats and nobody else had either!
My most recent litter had agouti (wild type), black, light blue and slate blue pups (some with white, some without). However, one pup has a black hood and a grey facial marking, which shouldn't be possible.  
Rats come in either self (solid) or any color and white, excepting the agouti coat which has evenly mixed hairs of various colors.  
So for two colors to present in one animal, it must be some sort of anomaly. Chimerism is a possibility because the secondary color is present in the rest of the litter. Other than that, I'm not sure what it could be, but am very curious. Are their any health issues I should be looking out for in case it is chimerism?
Anyway, I'm mostly looking for more information, either on how this could occur with normal genetics, what type of anomaly could cause this, or how to tell whether this could be chimerism or not. Any info appreciated!

A little about me, first: I'm 29, working in IT (with a BS in IT) which I am not at all passionate about. I never get excited about new technology the way I do about new dinosaur discoveries/research, so I'm looking at going back to school to change careers.

I'm really interested in dinosaurs, primarily their evolution into birds. I think the new discoveries about feather color and purpose are really fascinating. My absolutely favorite, though, is the research on turning chickens back into more dinosaur-like animals. My ridiculous dream job is running a dinosaur-poultry farm and the more I read the less ridiculous/implausible it seems. Originally I'd been looking at paleontology, but was advised that, based on my interests, I'd be better suited for bio/chem, specifically molecular phylogenetics.

Any suggestions on what sort of education I should look into for that?

Does that sound like a good starting point? Is there anything additional that would be helpful/required? Specific math requirements?

Background: 

My father has uniformly black hair (though it's now turning grey as he ages). My mother has dark brown hair, now turning white. My maternal grandmother had blonde hair, and my maternal aunt and uncle have red-brown hair (english, scottish, irish, german, and a bunch of other northern european heritages). Paternally, my family consistently has black/very dark brown hair (strict mediterranean descent).

My sister has very dark brown/black hair with a single stripe of solid white (like rogue from the x-men, or like a badger :P). This white hair began to grow when she was a teenager, and after several decades it has not expanded beyond a 2-3 inch area.

I have brown head hair, black eyebrows, and a strange beard. The portion of my beard that makes up a traditional goatee+moustache (directly surrounding my mouth and the ""soul-patch"") is very light blonde and white (not grey). My cheeks, sideburns and neck are a calico mix of dark brown and ginger (in noticeable splotches). This coloring was also present as a teenager.

Questions:
1. What are possible reasons for this ""mixing"" experienced by myself and my sister? (none of our cousins are like this).
2. Can someone ELI5 the process behind hair color inheritance, and in general the reason why hair color might differ based on physical placement (facial vs. top of the head in particular).

So this past May I received a B.S. in Physics. I'm looking to change my concentration to genetics, particularly in genetic engineering. I know I'm lacking in some of the undergraduate courses and will need to finish them before starting anything to content heavy. I'm taking this year off to work but I am planning on taking classes during the spring and summer semesters. 

At first I was considering getting a second B.S., this one in genetics and then moving to the masters program. I've talked with a few people, some from colleges and others from careers in bio. The consensus was that getting a second B.S. was a waste of time and money. Their advice was just get into grad-school and then you can back track to get the necessary courses before getting into the heart of the grad stuff. 

As a result from using gradschools.com and searching through their various grad programs I've found that they set the requirements for the programs as needing, well, basically a B.S. in bio or genetics. As long as you have the classes, and a B.S. in a science field they'll be happy. 

So enough of the back story. I was wondering what the people of r/genetics has to say. Also if you know some great schools for me in the New York / Pennsylvania/ Ohio area, or some awesome scholarships to help pay for all, this I would absolutely love to hear about them.

&gt;The so-called ""gay uncle"" hypothesis posits that people who themselves do not have children may nonetheless increase the prevalence of their family's genes in future generations by providing resources (food, supervision, defense, shelter, etc.) to the offspring of their closest relatives.

I had never really thought about this before but I read something on a blog that made me wonder if this idea makes any sense.

Let's just say that the hypothesis that gays *do* provide extra resources for their nephews and nieces is true (I'm not saying it is, but just pretend it is).

Since people are 50% related to their children and 25% related to their nephews/nieces, does this mean that to keep up with heterosexuals, gays on average would need to provide protection for twice the average number of children of heterosexual couples?

E.g. straight couples providing protection for two children (50%, 50%) is equivalent to a gay uncle providing protection for four children (25%, 25%, 25%, 25%).

But that's just to keep up with heteros, so for the gay genes to actually spread (rather than just exist), they'd need to provide for *more* than twice the average for heteros?

My former PI and I did some work on population genetics together some time ago. We're looking for a paper I once read whose title and authors we seem to have lost.

The authors developed a model for interpolating between the extremes of ""hard"" and ""soft"" selection. I don't recall all the details, but it seems they treat the number of offspring of each individual as determined by a function $\Lambda$ of the population mean fitness (1 + $\sigma$). This function contains a parameter that appears in the exponent of the denominator (it exponentiates the mean fitness), meaning it affects whether fitness is evaluated relative to the mean or not. Setting this parameter equal to 1 corresponds to ""soft"" selection (i.e., fitness evaluated relative to the mean) and setting it equal to 0 corresponds to ""hard"" selection (i.e., fitness evaluated absolutely).

There seems to be a divide in opinion between genetic specialists, like counselors, and more general physicians.

Most of the specialists that I've heard from are saying that Myriad's data isn't that important because (1) their VUS advantage is only particular to a fraction of patients, (2) open data initiatives like ClinVar will slowly eat away at this data, and (3) they won't provide panel testing with their BRCA1+2 until later this year. But some definitely prefer the benefits seen in interpretation that is derived from a larger VUS database.

On the other hand, the genetically uninformed, general practitioner is much more likely to miss the truth to the above and s/he doesn't really care because Myriad is the brand-name and they have nice sales reps. Myriad seems to like this just fine seeing that these guys over-test for BRCA since they don't have the genetic expertise to discern when and when not a patient should get tested.

Are these 2 camps a fairly even, 50/50 mix of BRCA test ""orderers""? How long will it take for competition to really be up to Myriad's level, and how fast will people adopt these newer options? Right now, as you probably know, they're charging 2x the price of Ambry's BRCA1+2 that also includes a panel; what price premium is Myriad's data worth?",,False,,t5_2qi3y,False,,,True,t3_1ipelj,http://www.reddit.com/r/genetics/comments/1ipelj/any_geneticists_with_opinions_on_postscotus/,

There comes a time in everyone's life where bullshitting through papers doesn't do journal club justice anymore. I'm an engineer by background but have taken genetics through medical school. I'd venture to say I have the conceptual/theoretical background to understand most genetics papers (or their premises at least). I've patch-worked up a recognition of the lingo and symbology as well.

The problem? Pathwork isn't working for some cases. I need to catch up on how to read these papers, get familiar with *very basic* paper-reading skills. Are there any resources I could consult online?

ie (and I'm sure I should be embarrassed by this) what *exactly* does -/- mean? I assume it means knockout, but what do the first and second parts signify? Google searching for ""-/- meaning"" returns the results for ""meaning"", so you can understand my frustration. One means gene is missing, the other means expression is lacking?

Questions in the same vein creep up pretty often, but I've yet to find a reliable resource I can count on for on-demand consultation.

Help... (would be greatly appreciated)

Lately we have gotten a couple of comments from his pediatrician and foot specialist about the length of his femur, his neck and his thorax

Now, we are worried he will grow with some kind physical deformation that is not only aesthetic but will cause other complications. There is a good chance of this because of his early diagnosis, which I must say was only clinical and we haven't done any other type of tests.

He is a healthy 11lbs and 56 cm, his only issues are trouble when breathing and sucking on his bottle, apparent constant discomfort and club foot but he's already begun treatment for that.

Our doctors are not able to give us a prognosis because this is simple something that they hadn't dealt with before our case so I would like to see if through this sub you can help me find more information not only on freeman-sheldon but also on what I should be looking for in my baby's growth bone and muscle wise.

the question is:

You have been called as an expert witness at a murder trial.  The prosecutor claims that a sample of DNA isolated at the crime scene, a farm, is human DNA and is demanding the suspect take a DNA test to see if there is a match. The defense claims that the sample is bovine DNA collected by mistake by poor police work and is resisting the test.  You have been asked by the judge to determine whether this is human DNA or bovine DNA.  To convince the judge you need to do two different tests. Explain what tests you would do, including the controls you would need, what results you would expect if the sample is uncontaminated human DNA, and why you believe these results are conclusive.

There seems to be some confusion about what the ""common drug"" is that was used to inhibit aging in the muscle.  The top comment says it's Tamoxifen but I don't think that's the case; Tamoxifen I think is just being used to activate Cre to delete Spry.  After reading through the whole paper I'm still a bit confused.  [This comment](http://www.reddit.com/r/science/comments/10k8ml/scientists_make_old_muscles_young_again_in/c6e8v45) says the drug used to inhibit Fgf is SU5402 which I think may be correct, but I don't think this is a common drug.

Has anyone else read [the paper](http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/vaop/ncurrent/full/nature11438.html) and can explain what's going on?  I wrote this in another comment in that thread but I might be misunderstanding the paper:

&gt;Fgf2 is both good and bad for muscle cells.  It's good for making them proliferate but bad for maintaining stem cells.  Old cells have too much Fgf2 and therefore not enough stem cells.  I think they used the chemical SU5402 to inhibit Fgf2 signalling as pointed out in [this comment](http://www.reddit.com/r/science/comments/10k8ml/scientists_make_old_muscles_young_again_in/c6e8v45).  But I don't think that is a common drug and I don't think that is what the press release is referring to.  I don't even know if that chemical is used as a drug at all, I think it's only been tested in lab settings so far.  But it's definitely not (or it should not be) referring to Tamoxifen as Tamoxifen was still just used as a tool to manipulate some other genes, not to actually treat the muscle.

&gt;So I think *a* drug was used to halt the aging of muscle, but the person who wrote the press release mixed up that drug, which is uncommon, with Tamoxifen, which is common but was only used as a genetic manipulation tool.",,False,,t5_2qi3y,False,,,True,t3_10luie,http://www.reddit.com/r/genetics/comments/10luie/re_the_link_scientists_make_old_muscles_young/,

What are the limits? 

Is it safe to say that in order to get from one certain place on the tree of life, to another certain place on the tree of life, via a process like breeding, that it would sometimes be necessary to go back to a much simpler form to do so?

I know it is possible for genes to shut off, but are there instances of information being removed from the genome? 

In truth I don't think I have ever heard this discussed.

To the best of my knowledge, you can not de-evolve (a misuse of terms on my part, I admit) anything, and I mean that in the sense that once a simple form of life has evolved into something more complicated (single cell -&gt; multi-cell), it will not evolve into something similar to its old simpler form ( multi-cell -/-&gt; single cell), if this is true, does that mean that in some cases it is impossible to go from a particular place in gene-space to another? 

Is there no number of generations that would allow you to get anything from anything? Especially given the premise that evolution is not a reversible process, and reverting to a simpler form requires removal of information from the genome.

Finishing up my genetics class and I've got a problem that's giving me a hell of a time. Pretty much all inheritance patterns are on the table. I don't really want anyone to spoon feed me the answer but if they could point me in the right direction that would be helpful.

There are five dragon phenotypes (green, gold, brown, bronze, blue). Females are either gold or green; gold dragons are the largest of all as well as the most rare dragons of either sex, while green dragons are the smallest of all and the most common.  Males are either bronze, brown, or blue.  Bronze dragons are the largest, followed by browns, and finally by blues.  As with females, the smallest types are the most common.
Only the gold queens are fertile, though it is possible that the greens might be fertile if they did not imbibe the phosphine-laden firestone that allows them to breathe fire.  Presumably all types of males are fertile, though only the bronzes (and rarely the browns) are successful in the competition for mating access to the golden queens.  The offspring of matings between gold and bronze dragons are a mixture of all of the different dragon types, in approximately the following percentages: &lt;1% gold, 5% bronze, 15% brown, 30% blue, and 50% green.


So far I know there's some obvious sex limited phenotypes and the Mendelian inhertiance isn't panning out. Again, if you could just point me in the right direction that would be appreciated.

I know when people ask me what I'm majoring in, I just say genetics usually even though its really psychology/biology. So is everyone else doing the same thing? Or did your school actually offer a degree in genetics?

Edit: thank you everyone for the awesome advice, but I think maybe I should have worded my question different. I'm not worried that my degree wont get me into the program. I actually decided to do a bachelors in psychology. I'm just curious who actually went to a school that offered a major in genetics. Because I haven't found any. Any school I look at just has something called a ""genetics track"" for a biology major, along with other tracks for different interests. But the actual degree is in biology.

She then mentioned that she has suffered from sleep paralysis, which triggered a thought: people who have suffered from episodes of sleep paralysis often suffer narcolepsy to one degree or another. 

Narcolepsy, is of course an autonomic physiological response. Research at the moment suggests a link with HLA-DQB1, HLA-DR2 and HLA-DQ1.

It's a mad train of thought, but there are two conditions that can both be described as the central nervous system misbehaving, and a shared experience of sleep paralysis.

As a train of thought from a layman, I'm wondering if there isn't a chance that her genetics would show up something in her HLA that would not only help answer some questions about her own condition, but also about narcolepsy. Like I say, I'm not a geneticist (just fascinated as a layman), but does this sound like something researchers might want to look into?

Nonetheless, there is considerable genetic variation in our species. The human genome comprises about 3 x 109 base pairs of DNA, and the extent of human genetic variation is such that no two humans, save identical twins, ever have been or will be genetically identical. Between any two humans, the amount of genetic variation—biochemical individuality—is about 0.1 percent.

Above is an article, 4 pages down it shows two histograms B) and C), I want to be able to explain exactly what they mean but I'm struggling with some concepts. From what I can gather, they are inferring that while affected and unaffected individual alleles share quite a lot of SNPs, B) is simply showing that the more SNPs, specifically heterozygous SNPs, the greater the contribution towards a pathogenic channotype. 

In chart C) again it shows a lot of similarity among healthy controls and affected individuals except for the large cluster of controls who notably only have a small number of SNPs compared to most affected, does this mean that it requires a certain pathogenic SNP load to achieve an epileptic phenotype?

I´m a computationally challenged geneticist, and have used Merlin (from Abecasis et al) a lot for my linkage studies. Am now getting a new Mac computer (Intel-based obviously, latest OSX version &amp; 64bits) and will for a while not have access to my usual server-based versions of Merlin.

Checking the [Merlin website](http://www.sph.umich.edu/csg/abecasis/Merlin/index.html)  I see that you can use the precompiled versions they have there (but they only have it for PowerPC Macs), or compile it yourself. Since I don´t have knowledge (or maybe even user rights) to do the compiling myself, I wonder if there´s anyone else out there that has this already done? Or can do it in 5 minutes for me? 
I did email the Merlin authors to ask, but have not received a reply.

1278541041.0,1,self.genetics,cn1x3,Self: how does imprinted genes escaping the demethylation of their cytosine prevents cloning of mammals?,1,0,3,http://www.reddit.com/r/genetics/comments/cn1x3/self_how_does_imprinted_genes_escaping_the/,"So, I'm reading Matt Ridley's excellent work ""Genome: The Autobiography of a Species in 23 Chapters"", and I'm having trouble with the chapter on imprinted genes.

To recap what I (think I) know:

Certain genes can ""remember"" whether they are of paternal or maternal origin, and can switch off the corresponding gene from the other parent - therefore, the busy expresses only the paternal or maternal copy of the gene in question. The chromosomal ""mark"" that is used is methylation of cytosine.

Ridley says (In chapter 15, page 212) that this methylation is normally reversed during the development of the blastocyst, and then reinstated during the next stage (gastrulation), but that imprinted genes somehow escape the DEmethylation, and this is what messes with cloning using somatic cell transfers.

Here's what I don't understand: he goes onto say that if you used a female body cell to clone, certain critical genes would be switched off by methylation, and if you used a male cell, all the imprinted genes would be turned off. From there, he says ""A cloned mammal would be born with all its imprinted genes either on or off on both chromosomes, [...] causing development to fail.""

But here's where I'm confused - why would they all be (individually?) switched on or off on both chromosomes?  And what difference does it make whether the donor cell comes from a male or a female? Further, if you're using an adult cell, all the imprinted genes will be expressing only the paternal or maternal genes already - and isn't that what normally happens during embryonic development anyway?

I feel like I'm missing something blindingly obvious here, but I'm not sure what it is. I've been researching via Google, but the answers are incomplete and sometimes contradictory. Geneticists of reddit, can you help explain genomic imprinting to a silly little lighting designer?

[edit] Sorry about the grammatically-incorrect title. Also, I do know about reprogramming, but that just deepens the mystery. Wouldn't the egg reprogramming the methylation make cloning not a problem at all, at least from an imprinting standpoint?]",,False,,t5_2qi3y,True,,,True,t3_cn1x3,http://www.reddit.com/r/genetics/comments/cn1x3/self_how_does_imprinted_genes_escaping_the/,

We know there was a population bottleneck of at most 10,000 humans at this time--is there any evidence that it definitely was never below 1000, or perhaps never as low as eight individuals?

**What genetic evidence is there that would contradict an 8-person human population bottleneck**? I would genuinely like to know and consider the most direct evidence that proves that there was never a bottleneck of 8 individuals in the population of Homo sapiens sapiens, without assuming a priori that common descent is true. (I am not wanting to debate--just want to find the best evidence to consider.)

There may be much wrong with Creationism, but I'd like it if you could focus your responses to the questions above. I really hope to focus on one thing at a time so that, if I am to reject Creationism, I know a few aspects of it that are contradicted by evidence.

I've looked and cannot find anything good on this.

Long term memories are essentially proteins created by the body in response to certain events.  Here's my thought: In response to the memory creating process what if our body updated our DNA to include instructions on regenerating these proteins under certain circumstances (sort of a boot-up sequence, triggered by conception for instance) and thereby providing a way of propagating experience from one generation or another.  Think of it as really long term storage.  From an evolutionary standpoint it would be beneficial to to pass on to subsequent generations experiences gained by the current generation that would increase chances of survival. In this sense you could argue that your ""soul"", be it your experience/memories/knowledge that thus uniquely defines ""you"" could conceivably be passed on to subsequent generations.  Considering the timeline of evolution you would expect the process would be far from perfect, given our brief history on the planet, and therefore you would expect discrepancies on the type of information passed on and possibly even who in your genealogical history's information becomes active in the current iteration.
