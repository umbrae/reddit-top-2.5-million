One potential problem with this servery database is serious mistranslation, when a survey was conducted in local language and then someone made one careless mistake when translating it.

Here is one example:

From at the official site of the survey documents:
http://www.wvsevsdb.com/wvs/WVSDocumentation.jsp?Idioma=I

Look at the ""WVS - Hong Kong - 2005 (879 Kb)""

First the raw numbers which you used for you world map drawing at page 22 (pdf page#):

http://i.imgur.com/f8Hggjq.jpg

So it looks like 78.1% of people in Hong Kong dislike other races, as you say ""astonishingly high.""  But don't you find it more unbelievable that the next two questions say 80% people don't mind having drunks or emotionally unstable peoples as neighbors?  Or even more crazy stuff on the next page, which say 90% people think it's fine to have drug addicts as neighbors?


Next please look at the original questionnaire in Traditional Chinese at page 88

http://i.imgur.com/bFy8us9.jpg



The translation of the question is:

""26. For people with these background, which do you find unacceptable to be your neighbor? [show card]""

a - with criminal record

b - different race

c - heavy drinker

d - emotionally unstable

Answer: (1) acceptable (2) unacceptable

i.e. the answers are not ""mention"" or ""no mention"", or ""yes/no"", or ""check 1 if applicable"".

The correct result should be: In Hong Kong 78.1% found it acceptable to have different race neighbours, while less than 20% found it acceptable to have drunks, emotionally unstable and drug addicts as neighbours.

You can also contact the Hong Kong University Professor who conducted the survey (credited in the pdf).  He can confirm that it was indeed a mistranslation.

It is obvious that the survey result for those questions was inverted by mistranslation, and now one of the most progressive and multiracial city in Asia get this super racist label, again.  Yes another media also used the inverted data a few years ago, and they ignored my request for correction:

http://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/national/time-to-lead/multiculturalism/diversity-yes-in-my-backyard/article1736042/

I wonder if the Bangladeshis number is also mistranslated.  They don't give the impression of having random racial riot every month.

Edit: 
One of the comment on Washington Post linked to this post showing how the Bangladesh number was also inverted.

I'm currently staying in a large flat in Kowloon. My husband and I live in mainland China and wanted to take my husband's brother and his family around China, starting in Hong Kong because it's ""China lite"" in some respects also because my husband and I happen to really like the place. 

On his first night here, my brother-in-law went out ""for a smoke"". Without informing anyone of what he was actually intending to do or bringing a phone, he went out and got completely hammered. 

When BIL wasn't back by morning, my husband and I went to our local police station, basically because we didn't know what else we could possibly do. We expected them to be perfectly nice, but not be able (or willing) to do fuck all for some stupid drunk dude. And really, who could blame them? 

After talking to an officer for a few minutes, the cop was able to pull up a recent police report detailing that they had found a man who said his name was 'BIL' earlier that morning. Someone had found him passed out in a flowerbed and - instead of getting thrown in a drunk tank, or anything remotely bad happen to him, an ambulance showed up and he was offered medical assistance, which he rejected. So this guy is an absolute twat, the worst sort of gweilo, and instead of punishing him (which would have been fair enough, honestly) they kindly offer to help him.  

The cops put out an APB (or something) to officers in the area with his description. The found him about five minutes later. No exaggeration. He was driven to our police station where my husband and I could meet with him and bring him home. 

I'm from the States and, like most redditors, I'm suspicious of cops. In all my dealings with law enforcement in several countries I have never dealt with law enforcement that was not only polite, professional, and helpful, but downright kind. I have been to Hong Kong many times and like it a lot, but I have never been more impressed by the city state until today.

I am not sure how many we can come up with both let's all contribute:


I go first:

1) Carry an octopus card with you at all times.  If you live in HK, you can apply for automatic add-value.  At times, I feel an Octopus card is more important than cash/credit card.  Also you can apply for reward points to get some $ back.

2) Want to see movies, but think tickets are hella expensive?  Go to shows before 12:00 pm and show on Tuesdays for discounts.  Also, using specific credit cards to buy tickets can give you discounts.

3) Check out sites such as groupon.hk/beecrazy.hk (there are many more, but I only use these two) for deals on many things.  But be warned for ""shady"" deals.  I advise to buy only deals that have alot of purchases.

4) Ocean Park gives you a free pass if it's your birthday and you have a HKID.

Can't think of anymore at the moment... let's all contribute:",,False,self,t5_2rbn0,False,,,True,t3_ur845,http://www.reddit.com/r/HongKong/comments/ur845/life_hacks_for_hong_kong/,

Now that this is official, attendance of this event is now mandatory. Attendance will be recorded, and points will be deducted for being late. Executions will be doled out to no shows. You have been warned. Big brother Miss_wolverine is watching.

Edit Edit: I was joking about the executions. But yeah, the more the merrier.

Global Reddit Meet Up day will be on June 23rd (Saturday) -- PICNIC/BOOZE (also ok if you don't booze)/GET TOGETHER time.

**Time:** 4 PM

**Place:** Picnic at West Kowloon Waterfront Promenade (aka where Clockenflap was held).
http://www.lcsd.gov.hk/parks/wkwp/en/locationplan.php

It's a bit tricky to get to, so I suggest that we all meet by the Airport Express (Kowloon station) first and walk there. 

**What to bring**: It's BYOB guys, so please bring drinks and snacks. It would be great if everyone can bring stuff to share, so if you can leave a comment about what you will be bringing that would be awesome too.

Also, bring whatever you guys want: music, frisbees, soccer balls, board games, kites, bubbles, etc. 

**I can't make it until the evening, sadface**: I suggest that we hang out at the West Kowloon Promenade until it gets dark and then head over to a bar for more food and drinks.

Since then it's clear that the Chinese government has tried to erode the Anglo-Chinese culture that exists within Hong Kong through various means while also holding back on democratic reform.

So when I see Hong Kong celebrating the 15th anniversary I can't help but think that this is really a momentous show of Chinese imperial strength rather than a genuine call for Hong Kong celebration.

I suppose this is quite a divided issue and a very controversial topic, but I would really like to know opinions.

Thought we can compile a list, while I think these are completely normal names in Hong Kong, if they did move, please change your name.  

**Sherlock**   
**Dragon** (I can understand this one, to mimic Long/Dragon/ in Chinese)  
**Faith** (I think this isn't unique to Hong Kong..)   
**Cornelius** (Actually was someone from the mainland, not Hong Kong.. interesting name - obviously can't forget it now)  
**Tiger** (Guy.. again similar to the Chinese: Fu, but still..)  
**Rudolph** (A really smart guy that I met... but yea.. the name..)  
**Hillson** (Think his chinese name had San/Hill in it)

**EDIT** great laughs, I personally think if you can't find a good English name just keep your Chinese name.. they sound way cooler, like some Korean pop-star.  I.E Wyman, Kamen, Ka-Shing/Karson, Jo-Yee/Joey, King, Waikin, Chi-On/Jion/G-On, Ekin, Eman definitely way better than the ones mentioned here.  
  
**EDIT EDIT** I'll try my best to add some Chinese meaning to them, if I do see some Chinese correspondence between them.  But honestly most of them... I dont see any connection at all.  But most of the time, if you add 'Gor'(bro) 'Jeh'(sista) to the English name it becomes really cool, like the other guy that was termed 'Laughing-Gor', now laughing as a name is pretty bad, but put it together it becomes gangstery-cool.",,False,self,t5_2rbn0,1367383105.0,,,True,t3_1dga6k,http://www.reddit.com/r/HongKong/comments/1dga6k/whats_the_most_weirdestinteresting_hong_kong/,

**[TIME AND INFO HAS CHANGED, MEETING AT 3PM. SEE UPDATED THREAD HERE](http://redd.it/18vthh)**

Please contribute to the [Google Doc spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0At9XvZgnKkMAdDdQancteEcweVA0RFVvQ1R0cnByY2c&amp;amp;usp=sharing) so we can all have an idea of numbers and what food will be had!


**Original post:**

Thanks for the suggestions and advice everyone. It sounds like this'll be a new experience for many of us so I think this'll be a fun one.

Looking forward to an awesome chill meetup of tasty eats, geeking out, meeting cool HK'ers, good chats and blowing the water/shooting the breeze!

* **What:** BBQ at Repulse Bay Beach, meeting in Central

* **Where and when:** Meet at Central (Exchange Square) Bus Stop at ~~1pm~~ 3pm, Sat Feb 23rd. 

We will wait for about half an hour and then we'll all get on the bus Route 260 to Repulse Bay.

Actual location at Repulse Bay will have to be confirmed, I'll post up my number/Whatsapp closer to the date for anyone what would like to join us there.

* **How:** Everyone please bring your own beer and food.

If you know what you're bringing post up below so we have an idea what we have to share amongst us.

~~I would advise people have stuff ready at Central but we'll stop by the Wellcome and/or 7-11 at Repulse Bay/Chung Hom Kok Road, where we'll grab charcoal.~~ We will try Clear Water Bay first so these stores will be a fair walk away.

Closeby the meeting point there's a CitySuper in IFC Mall and a [Wellcome a little by further out.](http://www.wellcome.com.hk/en/profile_store.html?page=store&amp;amp;lang=EN&amp;amp;region=Hong+Kong+Island&amp;amp;district=Central)

Again, I'll post contact details close to the day, I'll also keep an eye on the thread.

That's the best plan I can come up with. If any locals want to give suggestions or help please post up or PM me.

See you all there!

**EDIT**

[Please let us know if you're coming and have a think about what you'd like to bring for food in the spreadsheet here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0At9XvZgnKkMAdDdQancteEcweVA0RFVvQ1R0cnByY2c&amp;amp;usp=sharing). 

We'll also need a few people to help bring camping forks and other random tools, so any help you can provide is appreciated.

&gt; The citywide hunt for a missing 19-year-old continued on Tuesday as classmates and family members turned to social media to expand their search.

&gt; Tsoi Kin-hau, a Hong Kong Institute of Vocational Education (IVE) finance student, was reported missing after he disappeared on Friday, from his home in Lam Tin’s Tak Tin Estate.

&gt; He left behind a suicide note saying he was suffering from academic pressures.

&gt; The note read: “No need to look for me. Call the police and tell them to find me. I have gone to a faraway place where none of you will find me. Don’t worry too much, let me leave in peace.”

&gt; Friends of Tsoi took the search onto the internet with a forum thread, which was circulated more than 500 times in the first hour. News of Tsoi's dissappearance was also posted on Facebook. 

&gt; Police said they had searched Lion Rock Country Park, Lam Tin Park, Sam Ka Tsuen and the Tseung Kwan O Chinese Permanent Cemetery.

&gt; Tsoi was last seen wearing a black, hooded jacket, red T-shirt, jeans and black trainers, and was carrying a black Nike backpack. He is 1.73 metres tall and weighs about 58kg.

Hollywood has always done Hong Kong terribly, from Rush Hour series, Pacific Rim, Dark Knight, even in video games such as sleeping dogs.

I understand their nuances, and why they do it (my friend in Hollywood, who loves Hong Kong, explains it as 'we don't want to tell the truth that Hong Kong is basically New York City in Asia, because if that was the case, then we might as well just film in New York City), but there are a TON of things that irk me. These include:

- Guns. Why do so many people have guns in Hong Kong, when we had maybe 3 non-cop related gun incidents in the last 15 years.
- Difference between Mandarin and Cantonese. Films just dont care. Too many actors hired aren't speaking canto, or 2 people are talking to each other, one in Canto, one in Mandarin. Just weird.
- Non-Chinese actors playing Chinese people. Bad guy in one of the Rush Hour films, who was meant to be a Chinese triad, was a Japanese guy
- Old-Hong Kong culture. Hong Kong is usually portrayed still as people using wooden umbrellas, wearing ""cheung sam"" or ""quas"" (old chinese dresses), in very old neighbourhoods...yet they still show our towering skyscrapers in the background. Weird.
- Tuck-tucks. Why do they still insist on having those in movies? I have only seen one in a museum and I've been here over 20 years.
- Language barrier. Even if you go to the most local places, there will be people who understand English.

Anyway, those are my pet peeves. Feel free to add more.",,False,self,t5_2rbn0,False,,,True,t3_1ilwj5,http://www.reddit.com/r/HongKong/comments/1ilwj5/portrayal_of_hong_kong_in_films/,

In “Dark Clouds on the Horizon,” the Hong Kong Journalists Association’s latest annual report, the group warns that China is tightening its grip over Hong Kong media. The findings come at a time when attacks on a pro-democracy media group, Next Media, have raised fears of aggression against news outlets known for being critical of China.

The report finds that press freedom in the territory of Hong Kong--which was granted the right to manage its domestic affairs under a “one country, two systems” framework when [China](http://natachazafra.deviantart.com/art/Cruse-Associates-HK-serves-as-warning-academic-s-384573915) took back control from the British in 1997--is under assault both from the local government and from Beijing.

Locally, Hong Kong’s [government](http://www.slideshare.net/emmajulian965/cruse-and-associates-financial-news-articles-review) has proposed or passed laws that would restrict reporting activities. The vague wording of recent amendments to the city’s privacy law could subject journalists to five years in jail or fines up to 1 million Hong Kong dollars (US$129,000) if they reveal information that “causes psychological harm” or “causes loss.” The government has also proposed new rules that would bar the public from accessing the residential addresses and identification card numbers of company directors, which could prevent journalists from uncovering wrongdoing and corruption. Company records in Hong Kong played a crucial role in The New York Times and Bloomberg investigations into the family wealth and business relationships of former Premier Wen Jiabao and current President Xi Jinping.  In response to media criticism, the government in March postponed discussion of the new rules...",,False,self,t5_2rbn0,False,,,True,t3_1i55q6,http://www.reddit.com/r/HongKong/comments/1i55q6/hong_kong_journalists_under_local_mainland/,

I'm an American guy living here in Manila that was defrauded last here by a Bangladeshi businessman doing business in HK. I have verified the HK company and the fact he is the shareholder/director via your online ICRIS system. It even supplied me with his passport number.

Anyway, last year I filed an online police report with the HK police. Nothing much happened besides some autoreplies. Now, I have new evidence supporting my claims and I'd like to really get some police action going. I suspect the guy has left for BD, but the company is still active and he's still associated with it. While BD is corrupt, I trust that the HK authorities know how to flag him if he ever leaves.

The amount is question is over 100,000 HKD.

Anyway, my question is, how do I get some communication from your police while overseas? Does HK maintain any police attache at overseas Chinese embassies?

Any advise would be appreciated.

Thanks!

I unfortunately did not make a real plan before I came but I want to come back very soon. I would love it if some of you who know the city could give me some ideas for places to go. I went to the Peak and the avenue of Stars, rode the Star Ferry and saw the light show. I also ate on the Jumbo Floating Restaurant at the cab drivers recommendation. It was something to do and good photo op's for the family back home but not really my speed, and really over my preferred budget.

 I would really like to explore the lesser known places. I am especially interested in ""street food"" or small shops with great food. I cannot read much Chinese but can arrange a friend to come along if need be. (for  reading the menus) Plan an itinerary for me if you like. I do not want to go back to The States someday and have missed out on getting to know one of the world's great cities. I would just like to avoid the tour groups and maybe see your city a little the way you do.

Someone requested I post the food recs I have in an email...here are some. Feel free to add more and if it's informational enough, we can add it to the sidebar.

**Japanese:**

**Sushi:** 

Less expensive automated belt sushi chain, I go to [Sen Ryo](http://www.openrice.com/english/restaurant/sr1.htm?tc=top2&amp;inputstrrest=sen+ryo&amp;district_id=&amp;inputcategory=all) for good quality/consistent sushi

[Kenjo](http://www.openrice.com/english/restaurant/sr2.htm?shopid=6677) - (really good traditional sushi) - there are two locations, I'd go to the one in Minden Ave because there's where the actual Chef Kenjo is. Go for lunch -- they have really good valued sushi lunches. 
   
[Sushi Hiro](http://www.openrice.com/english/restaurant/sr2.htm?shopid=12383) (obviously, sushi) - similar to Kenjo, the toro rice is good. They also have a specific section if you go at night focusing on tempura (called tenyoshi, but part of Sushi Hiro), very good.
 
[Sushi Sase](http://www.openrice.com/english/restaurant/sr2.htm?shopid=47958) - haven't been here yet, more expensive and refined than Kenjo and Hiro, but friends say it's really good.


**Non-sushi**: 

[Rakuen](http://www.openrice.com/english/restaurant/sr2.htm?shopid=16543) (Okinawa food - you need to go to this specific branch) - good izakaya, get the squid ink rice. 

[Bicho](http://www.openrice.com/english/restaurant/sr2.htm?shopid=18517) - the building it's in has really good Japanese restos, get the ox tongue yakitori here.

[Sumi Yakitori](http://www.openrice.com/english/restaurant/sr2.htm?shopid=13543) - my favourite yakitori place in HK, in a really sketchy building with strip clubs and don't be deterred by the ""members only"" sign. Their corn is amazing, along with the lamb and they have this really good foie gras with 2 egg rice. Only open for dinner and only go here if you're not going elsewhere after because you will smell. 

[Tonkichi](http://www.openrice.com/english/restaurant/sr2.htm?shopid=47795) - best tonkatsu in HK. there are 4 branches in HK, the one in causeway bay is a long wait. I don't think you can make reservations here. I've been going to this branch and food is consistently good. 


**Chinese:**

[Sang Kee](http://www.openrice.com/english/restaurant/sr2.htm?shopid=3024) (mostly seafood) - traditional Chinese restaurant, good steamed fish, good traditional Chinese seafood.

[Fook Lam Moon](http://www.openrice.com/english/restaurant/sr2.htm?shopid=812) - another traditional famous Chinese resto 

[Peking Garden](http://www.openrice.com/english/restaurant/sr2.htm?shopid=2666) - good place to go, it's tourist friendly but the food is really good too. Get the peking duck obviously. The branch in Pacific Place is nice.

[Crystal Jade](http://www.openrice.com/english/restaurant/sr2.htm?shopid=15341)  - Shanghainese food, really good.


[Wu Kong](http://www.openrice.com/english/restaurant/sr2.htm?shopid=4063) (you need to go to this specific branch, other ones not good), also Shanghainese food

[Yung Kee](http://www.openrice.com/english/restaurant/sr2.htm?shopid=4203) (famous HK restaurant, tourist friendly), known for their HK style BBQ Pork and goose

[Joy Hing](http://www.openrice.com/english/restaurant/sr2.htm?shopid=1491) hole in the wall place that is known for the BBQ pork and goose. so good. 

**Hot Pot:**

good hot pot mostly has to do with broth, their condiments/sides, and types of foods they have (i.e. dumplings). These are some places that I like.

[San xi lou](http://www.openrice.com/english/restaurant/sr2.htm?shopid=21564) mostly sichuanese cuisine, and you can request spicy sichuanese style hot pot. Really good though.

[Megan's Kitchen](http://www.openrice.com/english/restaurant/sr2.htm?shopid=15235) really good hot pot. Clean, lots of great condiments, good broth, etc. 

**Dim sum:** 

[Tim Ho Wan](http://www.openrice.com/english/restaurant/sr2.htm?shopid=30806) (1 michelin star hole in the wall place in Mong Kok. At least an hour wait. Cheap and a small menu. So good though. Take out is only 30 minute wait, no reservations to be taken)

[Island Tang](http://www.openrice.com/english/restaurant/sr2.htm?shopid=25845) - Opened by the david tang who owns Shanghai Tang stores. They also own China Club...and man if you ever get someone who is a member make them take you to their weekend brunch buffets...it's so good. Chinese food buffet, and every time a dish runs out, they replace it with a different dish, so it's like a never ending gluttony fest.

[Lei Garden](http://www.openrice.com/english/restaurant/sr2.htm?shopid=13049) good, slightly upscale dim sum

[Maxim's](http://www.openrice.com/english/restaurant/sr2.htm?shopid=488) Maxim is a big restaurant group in HK, they have a ton of different dim sum restos and are consistently good, average priced, and they still wheel around the dim sum carts that not a lot of other dim sum places do


**Congee:**

[Sang Kee](http://www.openrice.com/english/restaurant/sr2.htm?shopid=3023)not related to the seafood one, this place is sort of like a hole in the wall, not that nice looking but good

[Tasty Congee](http://www.openrice.com/english/restaurant/sr2.htm?shopid=17424) another congee place, but with better ambiance and easier to find/order in
    

**Seafood:** - Getting seafood HK style is fun, I'd go to **Lei Yue Moon or Sai Kung**, because they let you pick the seafood out of the tanks and then cook it for you. 

**HK style diner (cha chaan teng)** - good HK style food, which is a weird mix of Chinese/British Western influence. They will have thick toast (I think in the US it's called Texan toast) with butter and condensed milk, HK style milk tea is good but ask for less sugar, ""yeen yeung"" which is half tea half coffee, they do a lot of instant noodles with meats and eggs on top, and the Baked Pork Chop rice is yummy.These places don't take reservations

[Tsui Wah](http://www.openrice.com/english/restaurant/sr2.htm?shopid=3837) (famous HK institution. I believe they have a branch at the Peak, so if you visit the Peak you should go to that resto).

[Cantopop](http://www.openrice.com/english/restaurant/sr2.htm?shopid=51174) this was opened by some famous chef lady in HK, more upscale diner food using organic ingredients. 

**Other Asian Cuisines**

[Good Satay](http://www.openrice.com/english/restaurant/sr2.htm?shopid=11321) have been coming to this restaurant for years. Really good Singaporean/Malaysian cuisine for very cheap.

[Nha Trang](http://www.openrice.com/english/restaurant/sr1.htm?tc=top2&amp;inputstrrest=nha+trang&amp;district_id=&amp;inputcategory=all) Vietnamese food


**Bubble tea!**

Two good chains in HK -- they let you choose the amount of sugar/ice etc in it: 
[Gong Cha](http://www.openrice.com/english/restaurant/sr1.htm?inputstrrest=gong+cha)

[Share tea](http://www.openrice.com/english/restaurant/sr1.htm?tc=top2&amp;inputstrrest=share+tea&amp;district_id=&amp;inputcategory=all)

**Dessert:**

[Xiao Tian Gu](http://www.openrice.com/english/restaurant/sr2.htm?shopid=32886) (chinese desserts) 
 

[Tong Pak Fu](http://www.openrice.com/english/restaurant/sr2.htm?shopid=26680) (shaved ice, but different from American shave ice!)
   

[Sift](http://www.openrice.com/english/restaurant/sr2.htm?shopid=16570) (western desserts)


[Riquiqui](http://www.openrice.com/english/restaurant/sr2.htm?shopid=46786) (western desserts)

I am shipping my dog home to Australia from China (long story) and will be in Hong Kong from early June to early August (2 months). It's difficult to find such short-term rentals, plus I have the most adorable 6 month puppy. 

Ideally, I would love to stay with a dog-friendly family that would like a nanny or housekeeper. I am a freelance editor, so I work from home and don't really mind where I live in Hong Kong. Just somewhere I can have my pup with me!

I am a 27 year old Australian female with a Bachelor in Science. I am a qualified swim teacher, play flute, and am an excellent chef and baker. I can tutor science, maths, philosophy and English. I also love to garden and take care of plants. I'm a native English speaker and am also studying Mandarin. 

I don't drink or smoke, I am very interested in healthy living and have First Aid qualifications. I love hiking, swimming, cooking and reading. 

My puppy is very gentle with children and I think being exposed to animals is really good for child development. He's also super super cute and trained very strictly. 

I hope someone will be able to help me find a place. If anyone knows a family that would be suitable, please PM me! 

Thanks a lot :)",,False,self,t5_2rbn0,False,,,True,t3_1bkt48,http://www.reddit.com/r/HongKong/comments/1bkt48/any_dogfriendly_people_looking_for_a/,

The cultural shock hit me when I worked at my first job here. You are expected to go above and beyond your station whereas back in Canada, it was a bonus for the boss and obviously a highly regarded trait. You are also expected to work longer hours without compensation and bringing work home is the norm.

The protection for labour is downright appalling. There are no standard working hours, and exploitation of employees is the common practice for all employers. I have friends who work till 10 or 11 every night without being compensated at the office. Employers owing salaries to their workers does not come as a surprise should it be heard on the news. The labour tribunal favours the employers to the point it might as well be their sword arm. 

Though I am Chinese, I do not ever regret saying I hate the Chinese when it comes to bosses/employers. I have worked with both white and Chinese bosses, and I can say that statement with certainty.

Hey guys -- here are the specific details:

~~Let's meet **3.30 PM in Elements Mall in West Kowloon at 360**. There is a 360 supermarket there and people can either buy drinks and food if they're not already bringing stuff. Then we will walk over to the West Kowloon Promenade together from there.~~

**Please Bring**: Snacks &amp; Drinks, frisbees, bubbles, anything picnicky, music, games, etc. Anything. Seriously.

This is a map of the park/public area:
http://www.lcsd.gov.hk/parks/wkwp/en/locationplan.php

Afterwards, around 7.30 PM we will go to **Delaney's in Tsim Sha Tsui**. It is right next to iSquare.

http://www.openrice.com/english/restaurant/sr2.htm?shopid=585

Guys, I don't know how late we'll stay there, but if you are not joining us for the afternoon portion, come for the evening one at 7.30 PM. Unfortunately, Delaney's does not take reservations on the weekends, but it should be ok at 7.30 PM. 

**IN CASE OF RAIN**, I will just forgo the afternoon picnic portion and we will just directly meet at Delaney's in TST at 7.30 PM. **I will make a post about this on Saturday morning depending on the weather** so please check r/hongkong!


**If you are late to the picnic event or lost or not sure if the group you're staring at are Redditors** -- PM me for my mobile in advance. 

Looking forward to seeing everyone!!

I realized that there are people who has to work on Saturdays and won't be able to make it, but I'm busy on 6/30 myself. So if anyone wants to step up and take over and organize something on 6/30 instead I'll be happy to step aside.

7/1 is actually my preferred date, but I don't want to organize an event on the day of the annual protest. I'd figured that quite a few of you will want to go there instead. I'll be happy to change the date if enough people voice their preference. 

(Note that the ferry going back to HK island from Sok Kwu Wan is much more frequent on a public holiday than on a Saturday.)
____

Proposed schedule:

**Edit 6/23 0900:** Meet at Central Pier 4 at around 14:45. I want us to take the [15:20](http://www.hkkf.com.hk/index.php?op=timetable&amp;style=en) ferry over to Lamma. We will take the ""[family trail](http://www.discoverhongkong.com/eng/see-do/great-outdoors/hikes/lamma-island-family-trail.jsp)"" from ~~Yung Shue Wan to Sok Kwu Wan~~ Sok Kwu Wan to Yung Shue Wan (changing to route to allow more flexibility as the ferry from YSW back to Central is more frequent). It's an easy 2 hour hike. 

Afterwards we can choose have an expensive seafood dinner on Lamma Island, or just go back to Central for something cheaper. Any thirsty people can even go to LKF or Soho for drinks. I need to stay sharp and wake up early on Sunday morning so I won't be joining for drinks.

Do remember to wear comfortable clothes and shoes, bring sunscreen, mosquito repellant, and bottled water.

Anyone interested please leave a message below. 

**Edit 6/24 2300:** I'm the guy on the far left of the group photo on the sidebar, PM me for phone number!

**Edit 6/26 22:30** update [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/HongKong/comments/1h3wnd/meetup_629_hiking_at_lamma_island_update/)

**Edit 6/27 12:30: IMPORTANT!** When I wrote we will be taking the 15:20 ferry, it means the ferry leaves the dock AT 15:20. There is absolutely no flexibility in time. The next one is more than an hour later. That's why everyone going will need to show up early (14:45) so we can go in through the gate as a group about 5-10 minutes before the ferry leaves, and elbow people out of the way like mainlander tourists. In fact I will get there at around 14:30 even though I wrote 14:45.",Meetup!,False,self,t5_2rbn0,1372308016.0,flair-meetup,,True,t3_1guoch,http://www.reddit.com/r/HongKong/comments/1guoch/take_a_hike_to_lamma_island/,

I moved in Hong Kong from the United States about six months ago and it looks like I’ll be staying here long term. That being the case, I was curious as to whether or not there are any gaming communities out there for English speakers. My Google-fu might have failed me, but I couldn't find any communities that didn't use Chinese primarily. 

Failing the existance of such a community, is there any interest here to start a new sub-reddit called **r/HKGameNight** or something like that? 

I'm thinking that it could be a way to develop a small community of gamers in HK who could decide upon a game and time to play every month or couple of weeks and play together online. It could serve as an exchange for Steam, PSN and LIVE names and get people together to play some games that have just been released or older titles that still have great multiplayer, but no one in SE Asia plays anymore.

If it was popular enough, I'm sure it could facilitate conversations about games in HK (i.e. which game store in the Wan Chai Computer Centre is better: the one on the first floor or the one on the second--my vote is the the one on the top floor) or even meet-ups, but I don't want to get too far ahead of myself.

Any interest in this?

**Edit:** So it looks like the Reddit community might be a little small to form an even smaller subreddit, but I'm going to scout out Geoexpat to see if there's an interest as well. I remember a few months ago, there was a guy who was interested in starting a site related specifically to PC Gaming, so maybe he just needs a little prodding.

Thanks for the responses everyone! :)

I'm wondering if anyone has seen any of the [100 Must See Hong Kong](http://www.lcsd.gov.hk/CE/CulturalService/filmprog/english/2011ms100/2011ms100_ticketinfo.html) movie presentations or is planning on going to any.  The Leisure and Culture department sponsors special screenings of 2 or 3 movies a month from classic HK cinema.  Each movie is played twice; once in Sai Wan Ho on a Saturday night and then the next Sunday afternoon in Yau Ma Tei.  The films are in Cantonese with subtitles and after each one there is apparently a talk (I assume in Cantonese) with a person from the film.

My wife and I are going to see the Jackie Chan classic ""Drunken Master"" on 15/4 (Sunday) so if anyone else is going and maybe wants to meet up for lunch before hand let me know.  In exchange for going to see that with me (a movie definitely more up my alley) I am taking her to see ""Homecoming"" and ""China Behind"" next month, too (Sunday showings for both).  Same deal for that; if anyone else is going and wants to meet a fellow redditor we'll be there.

If anyone has been to a screening already let me know what you thought.  It seems like a good deal (tix are cheaper than most movies) and we're looking forward to it.

In case anyone is interested:
Scroll down to near the bottom of [this page for Sunday](http://www.cinema.com.hk/revamp/html/cinema_every.php?lang=e&amp;cinema_id=10) screening tickets ($63 w/ online service charge), [this one for April Saturdays](http://urbtix.cityline.com.hk/internet/action/event.do?actionFwd=eventDetail&amp;event=16854) or [this one for May Saturdays](http://urbtix.cityline.com.hk/internet/action/event.do?actionFwd=eventDetail&amp;event=17121) ($40 + maybe a service charge).

1369504922.0,14,self.HongKong,1f1f5t,A Layman’s Take on Foreign Earned Income Disclosure and Tax Reporting for US Citizens Living Abroad,16,2,8,http://www.reddit.com/r/HongKong/comments/1f1f5t/a_laymans_take_on_foreign_earned_income/,"Disclaimer: I have yet to file my first year abroad's taxes with the US and my taxes here in HK. I am not a tax consultant, although, historically, I have done all of my tax filings (starting at the age of 15). I am 27 now. I just wish there was more exposure to this topic. Currently all I read is to get a CPA to do everything. That's great, and I can do that. But it would still be nice to know the process. That said, let's figure this out together. (I wrote this quickly and late.)

Filing US taxes while living abroad is kind of nuts. I can’t even imagine what happens when a person starts to own multiple investments [stocks (form 8938), real estate (form 8938), etc].

The USA is the only nation to tax based on citizenship versus the location of which the income was earned. Thus, as it goes, the USA’s tax reporting is international. No matter where you go, a US citizen will always have to file taxes even if - even if - they earned no income in the USA.

Example: Imagine for a second if I were to have a child in Asia and raise it here for the remainder of our lives. This child would be a US citizen (due to me being one), and thus, its whole life required to report income to the IRS as income earned abroad even though it is not their home. And if they failed to submit their FBARs (see below), they would owe tens of thousands of dollars and risk being extradited to the US for felony tax evasion. Yes, it really has the potential to be as crazy as this.

Moving on.

Roughly put, I have had to file an extension (form 2350) thru October, in my case, to qualify as having lived outside of the USA for 330 of the previous 365 days (otherwise all my income overseas would be taxable in the US). That’s step one; an extension to show I was out of the US for 90% of the previous year even though my 2012 taxes only go thru December of last year and relate in no way to this year.

The next item on the list is the FBAR (form TD F 90-22.1). Starting this year the US requires all US citizens/nationals/etc abroad to disclose all foreign held bank accounts. So, yes, I have to file forms detailing each account (saving, etc) including what the maximum aggregate value of the accounts (each detailed separately, but valued as a whole) were at any given time during the year (where the hell do I find that?). Not to mention, as a basic example, if I transfer $10,000 from account A to account B - now both are shown as having a maximum value of $10,000 during that time (if that was my entire income). A bit invasive and illogical.

The cost of filing the FBAR late (or missing it) - a $10,000 fine. Keep in mind this is not a tax disclosure. This is the IRS requiring to know what bank accounts you hold overseas. A $10,000 fine - WTF?!?!

Next up, and this one just makes me twitch, US citizens have to report and disclose any Foreign Trusts (form 3250-A) held abroad. Here in Hong Kong there is the MPF - the Mandatory Provident Fund. If you work in Hong Kong it’s, as the title may allude, mandatory. Everyone contributes. Sort of how Social Security is automatic - except MPF is more like a 401(k) type of deal. Here’s a national public retirement scheme which I am automatically enrolled in as a basis for working in this country, and the US requires I report it as part of their FATCA which was enacted to prevent tax evasion.

How is me disclosing mandatory national public retirement schemes helping avoid tax evasion? This one eludes me.
Then, yes, I file my taxes. In October that is; the typical form 1040. Whew. Done, right?

Not quite yet. I would file 1040 if I wanted to pay taxes on the income I did not earn while in the US. However, I do not want to do this; especially since I am already getting taxed here. Luckily income earned overseas of which have already been taxed abroad can be credited (like they’re giving you a damn bone) towards your 1040 tax filing (form 1116).

Luckily, for the vast majority of human beings, there’s an even better solution on hand. The US excludes the first $95,100 earned abroad (form 2555). To qualify for this exclusion, US taxpayers must first show they live abroad through either being a “Bona Fide Resident” or by meeting the “Physical Presence Test.” My physical presence here in Hong Kong is being met, through the eyes of the US IRS, thru the use form 2350 - delaying the date in which I file my taxes in order to qualify as having been here 330 of the previous 365 days.
My take on the exclusion. Sure. Here is a piece that makes sense and is fair. Although the whole first year status is a little wonky. They act like people’s lives run on annual tax cycles. “I shall move to Hong Kong on January 1st!” The creative side of my brain just died; the logical portion fled in fear.

Lastly form 8938 is a supplement to your 1040 showing foreign held assets. I’m fairly certain I won’t be needing to file this one, so I don’t have much of any opinion.

And finally. Here is the point I have really wanted to get to. All this. All this is to report to the US IRS income you have earned abroad. Report accounts and assets you hold abroad. And to see if you earn a remarkable amount of money at which the US finally requires a tax payment. For most of us, however, all this work will all be done for nothing more than having the IRS know every intimate moment of your income.

And all of this has ABSOLUTELY NOTHING to do with having to file your taxes, well, where you earned the income. You know - the legitimate and reasonable portion of this whole story?

The part where you actually file your taxes in the country where you earned them, so their governments can create revenue to administer and provide public services to the region. You know - so I can get to work, drink the water, have police protection, and enjoy, at best, a rather civil life here in Hong Kong.

Would anyone be interested in what I'd come to call the Nerd Walk? Every now and then I'd take visiting friends around the Sham Shui Po area to look at computer and electronic stuff, then to Mong Kok for anime/manga/comics related toys and collectibles plus other really geeky hobbies (model building, air guns, etc).

Even if you are not into that sort of thing there are still some wonderful opportunities for street photography, and there is a shopping center in the area that is almost completely devoted to photography equipment.

Afterwards we can go for dinner and drinks and hopefully somebody will buy me a drink.

If there are people interest in this I can organize something this coming Saturday (12/29).



**Edit (12/26 22:00):** 

Wow, response is considerable better than I thought. 

We will meet at Sham Shui Po station at 15:00 at exit D (inside the station, not outside) on 12/29 (Sat). I'll try to get there a bit earlier (have to work that morning). PM me to confirm you are coming and exchange contact info (if I don't know you are coming we won't wait for you). I'll be wearing a black t-shirt that says ""NO"" on front. 

Wear comfortable shoes, a large backpack or something if you plan on shopping, or at least something to take notes with if you plan on returning later. It will be pretty crowded and expect to elbow your way through the crowds.

Note that there is probably nothing new for any local nerds, other than an excuse to meet new people and possibly some drinking.

It is needless to say that I'm very excited about going. The only real concern I have, as an African American, is whether or not I will notice a palpable level of xenophobia from the regular population. I've done a bit of research and found some negative articles and mostly mixed comments on forums, so I was hoping you guys could help clear this up for me.

I suggest we shoot for next week, as anything this week would be on pretty short notice. The seven day forecast doesn't look too good, but hopefully it will get better next week. I still think a BBQ would be fun. Maybe at Chung Hum Kok, as suggested before. Here are some other suggestions that I thought about - please add your own in the comments:

**Drinking:** My favorite nicer bars are Cocky Bar in The One, Ozone on top of ICC, and Club @28 at Crowne Plaza Hotel in CWB. Alternately, cheaper bars I enjoy are Bahama Mama's at Knutsford Terrace or Intime on Ashley Road, both in TST. I'm a dark-side guy, so please suggest any other non-Kowloon spots as well. 

**Horse racing at Happy Valley** might be a fun thing to do. A shameful secret of mine is that I've lived in HK for nearly a decade and I've never been. Also, we could go there and then maybe leave early and head over to Club @28 right after. 

**Karaoke**? I haven't been for years so I wouldn't know where to start.

**Kayaking** - for realz. You can rent them in Sai Kung and it's a nice paddle out around some of the islands there. Then maybe drinks and dinner in the Kung?

**Private kitchen**? I don't know much about these or how many people they can facilitate, but it always sounded like fun.

**Anything else?** Key party? I hear those usually pop off in DB!

I have been away from Hong Kong for a year. Yes, I have read about the growing resentment against mainlanders. But I never expected a welcome home party on Stanley beach to turn into a complaint forum.

At the party are my girls' classmates and their parents. This is a group that you would least expect anger from.

George is typical of them. He is a self-taught certified accountant. He is no hot head.

He runs his own accountancy firm that employs 50 people. He doesn't have to worry about losing his job or business to highly competitive mainlanders.

George is a beneficiary of the mainland's booming economy. Business is good enough to allow him to pick up his son every day from school at 3pm. The value of his handful of apartments has more than doubled in the past few years.

His wife stays home to take care of their single child. Rising food bills and rents fuelled by mainlanders' buying sprees are not their concern.

They don't have to compete with mainlanders for hospitals beds or milk formula. Their seven-year-old is studying in a local school.

These people have little economic reason to dislike the mainlanders. Yet they call the mainlanders qiang guo ren, which is literally translated as ""people of the strong country"" for their pushiness (mentally and physically).

They call Tsim Sha Tsui ""the invaded zone"". They miss the good old days when they could stroll with their kids at Ocean Park without having to fight the queue jumpers.

They complain of corner-cutting in the work place and being told that ""this is the way it is in the mainland"".

They said they would leave the city for good if the subject of ""national education"" was forced on their kids. ""China kills its own people,"" said one of the dads.

Basking in the sun while the children built sand castles, they warned of the eventual ""fall"" of Hong Kong. ""Why didn't you stay in Britain?"" asked one mother.

It must be the frustration over the national education thing, I told myself, trying to make sense of their sentiment.

I was wrong. On October 1 we gathered again, this time for the fireworks. ""Toast to the moon, not to the National Day,"" said one of the fathers. ""Well said,"" was the echo. That was two weeks after the government shelved the plan for the curriculum.

If this is what the ""winners"" of the system are saying, it isn't surprising to see a best-selling political commentary, the Hong Kong Polis, equating the integration of Hong Kong and the mainland to a dirty old man trying to fool his little granddaughter into bed.

Its author, Chin Wan, advocates autonomy for Hong Kong and restoration of the lion and dragon colonial flag. He says Beijing will not retaliate because it needs ""a city of integrity"" to deal with the world.

Most of my English-speaking colleagues found this pique difficult to understand. If the French could tolerate the noisy Americans and now the noisy Chinese on the Champs-Élysées, why can't the Hongkongers put up with the crowds of mainlanders?

The quick answer is the Americans and Chinese don't have a say over France's political, social and economic matters. The longer answer is in our history.

In the colonial days, Hong Kong was so cut off from the mainland that a policeman needed approval to cross the Lo Wu Bridge. The Tiananmen massacre and the country's backwardness was the first glimpse of China for most of us.

We were then thrown into the hands of a total stranger. That's fine because the stranger was the one in need. We poured in our money and knowhow.

By late 1990s, the country was rich enough to hire our regulators and managers for their ""international edge"". Yet, most of them were soon sent home because ""they don't understand the country"".

It hurt a bit, but not too much. The majority saw this as a conflict between our civilised rules and their uncivilised one, not a denial of our values.

Then in 2003, we suddenly found ourselves becoming the needy, begging for the surgical masks, stock issuers and tourists from the ""uncivilised relatives"". That hurt.

If it's for a better life, the pride can be swallowed. Yet, the better life has not come. The have-nots struggle to pay rising bills while the haves see a worsening living environment.

Many have warned Hongkonger's against this ill-feeling against the mainland, with some calling it an independence move. They say Beijing will not cut off the water supply, but what chance would Hong Kong have without Beijing's trust.

These warnings, however well-intended, have missed the crux of the resentment. To these bitter citizens, what is the point of keeping quiet in the hope of a prosperous Hong Kong if it is no longer owned and shared by Hongkongers.",,False,self,t5_2rbn0,False,,,True,t3_12n30p,http://www.reddit.com/r/HongKong/comments/12n30p/what_is_the_point_of_keeping_quiet_in_the_hope_of/,

1332526863.0,13,self.HongKong,raas1,Summary of known voting intentions amongst the election committee for Chief Executive,15,2,1,http://www.reddit.com/r/HongKong/comments/raas1/summary_of_known_voting_intentions_amongst_the/,"**CY Leung** (he needs 601 votes to win)

* **DAB** - 149 votes (""recommendation"")
* **Agriculture and Fisheries sector** - 60 votes (and it shows how biased the election is when such a tiny industry is getting such a disproportionate number of votes
* **Hong Kong Federation of Trade Unions** - 60 votes
* **Hong Kong Medical Association** - 15 votes (out of the total 30 in the Medical sector) 

All of the groups above are known to be traditionally pro-Beijing except for the HKMA. The bias in the election itself can be seen by how the very small Agriculture and Fisheries industry holds a disproportionate amount of votes (and the people in the election committee doesn't even work in the industry directly). The decision from the HKMA was what really surprised me. They sent questionnaires out to all registered doctors in Hong Kong and had a 12.5% response rate. Of these 1600 doctors, 36.5% voted CY Leung, 8.6% voted Albert Ho, and 25.6% voted Henry Tang. However, 29.3% casted absentee votes. As a result, *all* 15 votes from the HKMA will be cast towards CY Leung.

CY Leung also had nominations from 293 members from the election committee. After subtracting the overlapping votes, this means that all together he'll probably have at the very least 524 votes on Sunday. 

**Not CY**

* **Education sector** - 25 votes
* **Higher education sector** - 24 votes
* **Hong Kong Social Workers' General Union** - 28 votes (out of 60 in the Social Welfare sector)
* **Liberal Party** (a pro-business party) - 29 votes
* **Pan-democrats** - 203 votes

Pan-democrats, education and higher education voters have announced that theywill boycott the second round of voting if it comes to that.",,False,self,t5_2rbn0,False,,,True,t3_raas1,http://www.reddit.com/r/HongKong/comments/raas1/summary_of_known_voting_intentions_amongst_the/,

UPDATE as of Aug 2013 - Dad's staging after confirming with Doc and after a bone scan (which, thankfully, is all clear) is now determined as T3b (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prostate_cancer_staging).

However, doctor mentioned treatment which includes hormone therapy and radio therapy. This doctor we have been seeing is at Baptist and can imagine treatments there are not cheap (especially after reading an article in the SCMP). Dad would need to do 6 wks - 3 months of hormone therapy and then 3-months of radio therapy.

I was wondering if any Reddit HK people have a good recommendation for public hospitals who provide treatments? And how much those costs would be?

I have visited your amazing city quite a few times now and have decided that I would like to live in HK for a few years, starting next year.

I am currently Sales Manager Europe for a manufacturing company, I speak English, German and French fluently and have 8 years of marketing, business development and sales experience. So far so good.

Looking at the job market, it seems though that I would certainly do myself a favour if I learned one of the two big local languages.

What are your thoughts? Should I learn Cantonese (truly the local language) or Mandarin (biggest language in the world, becoming increasingly standard in HK)? How proficient do I need to be in order to have access to a decent range of job vacancies? Would you maybe have any further hints for me?
