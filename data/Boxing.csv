1366142498.0,514,self.Boxing,1chdpt,The sorry state that is women's boxing,596,82,155,http://www.reddit.com/r/Boxing/comments/1chdpt/the_sorry_state_that_is_womens_boxing/,"5 months ago, I was in a banquet hall to see a local fight card. The promoter said it was just like being in Las Vegas, but it clearly wasn't. For $50, I had near-ringside seats because, well... why not?

The co-main event was a fight between two female boxers. Jaime Ward vs. Alisah McPhee. 

While I never watched her previously, I knew *about* Jaime Ward. Having been a 2x member of the Canadian National team, she had a somewhat decorated amateur career (by Canadian standards). 

Ward had *some* hype behind her. She was a bona fide human specimen as she entered the ring. [This is a picture of her the previous day at weigh-in](http://i.imgur.com/Qenub5s.jpg).

Alisah McPhee was clearly there to be an opponent. As she made her way to the ring, she seemed the opposite of Ward. At 5'2"", she was tiny compared to Ward. Despite having a bit of softness near her midsection, it looked like McPhee weighed nowhere close to Ward.

As McPhee made her ring walk, another woman scuttled herself close to me. Nudging me, she asked, ""Do you mind if I sit here and watch?""

""Go ahead,"" I said.

As the ring announcer was being prepped, the woman moved her head close to me. ""You see that girl in the pink trunks?"" she beamed as she pointed to McPhee, ""That's my girlfriend.""

My ears perked up. ""How do you feel about her making her pro debut tonight?""

""Scared,"" she replied, ""I've never seen her fight.""

I had to ask her a question that was burning through my mind.

""Is she really 135lbs?"" I asked, ""Because she looks nowhere close.""

""Oh God no,"" McPhee's girlfriend answered, ""She was about 124lbs at weigh-in.""

""What's she doing fighting a lightweight then?""

McPhee's girlfriend tilted her head as though it should all be obvious. ""Well, she couldn't find anyone near her size so she decided to fight someone bigger.""

I nearly fell out of my chair. I was sure this was going to be a massacre. How dare the promoters put this poor girl in with the beast that is Jaime Ward!

The fight started. Over the course of the fight, the unthinkable happened. McPhee outhustled, outworked, and outboxed Ward. Using superior speed and footwork, McPhee made Ward look foolish. 

The judges gave a split decision to McPhee, but from where I sat, I thought the scores should have been wider. McPhee put on a boxing clinic.

***
Fast forward four months later. Once again, I watched a local card featuring the formerly IBF-ranked #11 middleweight contender Adam Trupich. Trupich was taking on Dashon Johnson — a guy who lost his last 6 fights.

On the co-main event, there was Alisah McPhee against Wendy Roy who was 1-8. 

Both Trupich and McPhee were taking on opponents who had soft records. But who won against their soft opponent that night? McPhee. Trupich got KOed by Johnson. Who was the fighter who dazzled with skill? It was McPhee.

***
Now I'll tell you something else that's interesting about McPhee. Despite not being a lightweight and having only fought as a pro twice, she's ranked the #48 lightweight in the world according to Boxrec.

Shockingly, Boxrec only records 108 women fighting as lightweights.

In the featherweight division, McPhee's natural weight class, there's only 119 women who fight as pros.

If McPhee cut weight, I'm positive she could compete as a bantamweight — which means she'd have a pool of 103 women to fight.

For comparison's sake, there are 935 men who compete as bantamweights, 1299 men who compete as featherweights, and 1589 men who compete as lightweights.

***
The reason I mention all this is because women's boxing has a very small talent pool. It's essentially what allows girls like McPhee to be the #48 lightweight in the world despite being a featherweight (who doesn't cut weight) and only fighting twice as a pro.

This small talent pool means the talent gap is wide. For instance, while the #1 lightweight is 16(9)-0, the #8 is 9-8-3.

Simply put, if there's any sport where the best *really do* need to fight the best, women's boxing is it.

***
Sadly, the best in women's boxing really *don't* fight the best.

Yesica Bopp, who is the #1 at light flyweight, has a record 24(11)-0. She only has a pool of 88 women to fight. Despite this, she has not fought #2 Esmeralda Moreno or #3 Jessica Sanchez. The highest ranked opponent Bopp has fought is current #6 Ibeth Zamora Silva.

Bopp has never challenged herself, yet he's a star in Argentina. People pay good money to watch the very sexy Bopp pulverize some hapless wench. I mention that Bopp is sexy because it seems Bopp is more concerned with [looking sexy](http://www.pregon.com.ar/uploads/2013/02/22/79760_Foto_22_de_febrero_2013_19.jpg) than challenging herself. 

If women's boxing is to be taken seriously, talented women like Bopp need to take themselves seriously.

***
Which brings us to the best possible fight in women's boxing. 

The two best female boxers in the world are Holly Holm and Cecilia Braekhus. Holm is a light welterweight while Braekhus is a welterweight. There's no question each woman is incredibly talented.

If either woman was to fight each other, this would put women's boxing on the map. The winner would be boxing's equivalent to Ronda Rousey. She'd become an international icon that transcends women's boxing.

But that fight is not happening.

Only 77 women fight in the light welterweight division, and only 36 women fight in the welterweight division. There really isn't a whole lot of opponents either Holm or Braekhus can fight. So what could possibly keep either woman from fighting each other?

There's only one answer: a complete unwillingness to step up, to prove themselves, to define their legacies.

***
Before I end this, I don't want to make it seem like *no* women in boxing are challenging themselves. 

Jackie Nava and Ana Maria Torres challenged each other — twice! —and fought two of the best fights I've ever seen!

Ava Knight stepped up and defeated the highly regarded Mariana Juarez. The lady is a class act and conducts herself with dignity inside and outside of the ring too.

Finally, there will always be the Alisah McPhees of the world — girls who are more than willing to beat up women who are bigger than them.

Sadly, elite women who are willing to challenge themselves are too few and far between.",,False,,t5_2qj0l,1366162817.0,,,True,t3_1chdpt,http://www.reddit.com/r/Boxing/comments/1chdpt/the_sorry_state_that_is_womens_boxing/,

His thinking was that since Trout had an argument for a win, he should keep his belt. 

Rather than giving him the exhaustive answer through PM, I thought I'd make this post for everyone to see. Here I will exhaustively answer if ""to be a champion you have to clearly and without controversy beat the champion"" is, in fact, a boxing tradition.

**If you want the TL;DR:** it's yes and no :P

When people refer to championships in boxing, they're potentially referring to three things:

* Lineal championship - the oldest ""type"" of championship, and established by public acclamation
* Alphabet organization championship - mandated by sanctioning bodies like the WBC, IBO, WBU, etc.
* Undisputed championship - the champion who holds all the titles of the ""major"" sanctioning organizations


## A Short History

The first lineal boxing champion on record is James Figg who became so in 1719. Until 1910, there was no organization that claimed to be an international governing body for boxing. 

That means that some of the greatest champions in boxing history did not receive their championship by a sanctioning organization but by public acclamation. 

Daniel Mendoza, John Jackson, and James L. Sullivan never carried belts because no organization gave them one. The first ""official"" belt on record is the Lonsdale Belt - and that is not a world championship belt.

In 1910, the IBU became the first organization that claimed to govern professional boxing on a worldwide scale. They later morphed into the EBU - a regional body that continues to this day.

In the 1920s, the NBA and the NYSAC established a rivalry, with both sanctioning organizations recognizing world champions.

The NBA became the WBA in 1962.

In 1963, the WBC sought to end the alphabet soup madness by inviting numerous national organizations under its umbrella. The EBU was one such organization that joined it. 

NYSAC ceased recognition of world champions in the 1970s to focus solely on sanctioning fights in New York State.

There was a leadership dispute inside the WBA, so a bunch of members split and formed the IBF in 1983. The same thing happened again in 1988, and therefore the WBO was formed.

Hence the four ""major"" sanctioning bodies are:

* WBC
* WBA
* IBF
* WBO


The most major of the ""minor"" sanctioning bodies is the IBO which remains the only sanctioning body to institute computerized rankings.

In the 1970s, it was easy to become an undisputed champion. All you needed was to hold the WBC and WBA titles. From the 1980s-2006, you were considered an undisputed champion if you held the WBC, WBA, and IBF belts. In the late 2000s, the WBO was considered a ""major"" organization as well — so now you have to hold the WBC, WBA, IBF, and WBO belts to be the undisputed champion. 

Naturally, there are no undisputed champions today.

## The Lineal Championship

Traditionally, if you wanted to be the lineal champion, you had to beat The Man, and you had to do so clearly. Just who was The Man? The Man was the man who beat the man who beat the man.

What would happen in the event The Man retired before he got beat? The lineal championship would be up for grabs when the universally recognized #1 fought the universally recognized #2. 

Now before we go trying to apply this tradition to modern boxing and modern MMA, there's some information we all need to know. 

Traditionally, a fight wouldn't be stopped until there was a KO or one of the fighters was knocked down and couldn't beat the count. Hence, there were no limits on the amount of rounds that would be fought.

This is why when we look at fights from the Jack Johnson era, they would sometimes fight for 20-40 rounds. There was no scoring system. 

Once they put a limit on the amount of rounds that could be fought, sanctioning bodies ruled that fights could be won by decision. The decision was decided simply with the referee raising the arm of who he thought won. This is still the practice in the UK, except for championship fights.

Obviously, with one man deciding the fight, decisions were often controversial, so efforts were underway to create some sort of scoring system that was judged by observers outside the ring. 

At first, judges included the ref and two observers seated at ringside. Within the past 50 years, however, the referee no longer has the responsibilities of judging. That's placed in the hands of three judges placed at ringside.

The most commonly used scoring system right now is the 10-Point Must system - named as such because judges must award one fighter 10 points (before deductions for fouls).

I mention the evolution of boxing's rules because even though to gain the lineal championship, you had to beat the champion convincingly, that was true under a completely different set of rules.

Current lineal champions have to adhere to current rules, so the old tradition does not apply.

For the record, there's only 5 lineal champions in boxing today. They are:

* Akira Yaegashi (Flyweight)
* Guillermo Rigondeaux (Super Bantamweight)
* Sergio Martinez (Middleweight)
* Andre Ward (Super middleweight)
* Chad Dawson (Light Heavyweight)


All these lineal champions became so convincingly — so even if the old tradition does not apply, their championships adhered to the spirit of the old tradition.

## Alphabet organization championship

The alphabet organizations are the ones who award belts — and frankly, anyone can create an alphabet organization. There's highly-regarded organizations (like the IBF) and lightly-regarded organizations (like the WBU).

The only requirement for being recognized as a champion by an alphabet organization is that they recognize you as such. In fact, you don't even have to win a fight. Sometimes they'll just award them to fighters.

The other side of the coin, of course, is that they'll often remove their recognition of a world champion if the world champion does not pay the required sanctioning fee. This is one major reason why alphabet championships are often ""vacated"".

Under the system of the alphabet organizations, you definitely don't need to beat the champion to become the champion.

## Undisputed championship

In the 80s, the term ""undisputed champion"" became something to strive for because the thought was that if you were universally recognized as champion by all major sanctioning bodies, you must be legit. 

Of course, the problem with this is that the major organizations increased from 2 to 4 sanctioning bodies in the course of 30 years. 

Yet another problem was that the alphabet organizations could remove their recognition of a champion for any reason whatsoever. In fact, Graciano Rocchigiani sued the WBC for removing him from championship recognition for reasons that contravened their own rules. The courts ruled in Rocchigiani's favour — awarding him $30 million.

Instead of paying him, the WBC sought Chapter 7 bankruptcy liquidation — essentially ending its existence. Rocchigiani settled with the WBC outside of court. WBC therefore continues.

Further casting doubts upon the ""undisputed championship"" legitimacy was something that happened during Lennox Lewis' undisputed championship reign. Don King paid Lennox Lewis $1 million to vacate his IBF title. Lewis accepted the money, did as King asked — and Lewis was no longer the undisputed champion.

## Conclusion

Traditionally, to be a champion in boxing you had to beat the champion without controversy. This was because the only championship that mattered was the lineal championship. Before the advent of sanctioning organizations, fights were not won by decision.

As rules have changed, this tradition no longer applies.",,False,,t5_2qj0l,1366840156.0,,,True,t3_1d0xrj,http://www.reddit.com/r/Boxing/comments/1d0xrj/traditionally_in_boxing_did_you_have_to_beat_the/,

10-9 Gamboa, 49-45 Gamboa

***Round 6:*** Blood really streaming down Farenas' face. Gamboa back to dictating the pace. Farenas' waiting patiently — tees off, and misses. Good hook by Farenas! Gamboa just picking off Farenas', though.

1373836175.0,133,self.Boxing,1iaofm,In light of Marquez turning down VADA and USADA testing...,152,19,86,http://www.reddit.com/r/Boxing/comments/1iaofm/in_light_of_marquez_turning_down_vada_and_usada/,"On November 08, 2011 in anticipation of the Pacquiao-Marquez III fight, Deadspin writer Barry Petchesky drops an article titled [What Do Usain Bolt And Juan Manuel Marquez Have In Common? They Train With The Same Admitted Steroids Dealer](http://deadspin.com/5857439/what-do-usain-bolt-and-juan-manuel-marquez-have-in-common-they-train-with-the-same-admitted-steroids-dealer) which even features footage from a German documentary that shows Memo shooting PEDs into his stomach and purchasing them in Mexico City. This is a fantastic article. 

What is Heredia's connection to Usain Bolt, the fastest man in the planet at the 100m set the world record in 2009 at 9.58 and Olympic record (9.63) at the 2012 London games. Here is a link from 8/12/12 which reveals [Bolt using Heredia](http://chicago.cbslocal.com/2012/08/12/bernstein-usain-bolt-is-probably-doping-and-you-know-it/). It also has quotes from Carl Lewis saying:

&gt;“When people ask me about Bolt, I say he could be the greatest athlete of all time,” Carl Lewis told the Times of London. “But for someone to run 10.03 one year and 9.69 the next, if you don’t question that in a sport that has the reputation it has right now, you’re a fool. Period.”

Here's my other evidence which is not exactly 100% backed up.. but kind of implicates all of the Jamaican sprinting team. 

[Raymond Stewart was caught and banished for obtaining and distributing performance-enhancing drugs to his athletes.](http://www.examiner.com/article/olympian-and-track-coach-raymond-stewart-banned-for-life-for-drug-trafficking) Raymond Stewart and Usain Bolt [were both coached](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glen_Mills) by Glen Mills. In 2009, 2 of his athletes were [popped for using](http://www.reuters.com/article/2009/07/24/us-doping-athletics-jamaica-idUSTRE56N46420090724) stimulant Methylhexanamine (and were banned 3 months lol) Mills then stepped down. 

What does Marquez think of testing? 

&gt; “I think that you can say anything that you want, but you don’t have any proof, so what does that mean?” The Ring reported Marquez as saying. “[It means nothing](http://www.nydailynews.com/sports/more-sports/marquez-fight-swirling-doping-rumors-article-1.1217365).”


On March 30, 2013 Dennis Guillermo of Examiner.come wrote an article about his [conversation with Memo Heredia](http://www.examiner.com/article/my-training-methods-were-the-difference-conversation-with-angel-heredia). Here are some tidbits.

&gt;“What is your response to fans insisting Marquez was doped up vs. Pacquiao in the 4th fight?” I asked Heredia last week via Twitter.

&gt;“No dope. (Marquez) is a drug-free athlete,” he instantly responded.

&gt;Heredia maintained that their camp had no issues regarding blood and urine testing against Pacquiao in fights 3 and 4, and would encourage it if a fifth fight is consummated.

&gt;“We asked Pacquiao for test (blood/urine) then before 3, 4, so if he wants to do it now, please do. It will give him credibility,” he wrote then added, “Manny Paquiao has a history of denying blood sample testing, so what you (sic) say about that? Have you ask (sic) him why denying then?”

He raises a good point. If Pacquiao's camp was adamant and suspicious of the involvement, they should have asked the camp. What is Memo doing here? He's subtly pushing the responsibility and the suspicion over to Manny Pacquiao and getting the spotlight off of him. 

Now, why did Pacquiao do this? 

&gt;Pacquiao didn’t think much of Heredia’s involvement with Marquez, nor his nemesis’ enhanced physique at the fight's weigh-ins as evidenced by his comments saying “this is not a bodybuilding contest” when asked regarding the matter.

Was it Pacquiao's fault he lost? Yes, probably. He states:

&gt;“I believe if Pacquiao wouldn't (sic) skipped Ariza's training, he would have performed at a higher scale level. He needs to get to it,” Heredia advised.

Fair enough... but what about Marquez. Could he have won without Memo?

&gt; “No. Juan developed speed &amp; power with my training. My training methods made a tremendous difference - that difference was the KO.”

Heredia is caught in more lies than Victor Ortiz. 

&gt;Heredia has been caught in numerous lies over the past six months. I personally asked him, “Are you working with or have you worked with Brandon Rios?” His answer was “No, I have not worked with Rios.” Not true.


&gt;They were seen together weeks ago and both denied that they were working together. In other words, Rios and Heredia both lied about their relationship recently. Rios, in his typical classy manner, said, “Honestly, who gives a (crap) if I didn’t tell nobody?”

&gt;Brandon Rios told BoxingScene.com, “I’m working with Angel because he’s helping me with strength and conditioning and nothing else. I never did morning runs and conditioning work until I worked with Angel. I feel a lot stronger because of the endurance work we’ve done.” Apparently, Memo has one hell of a morning run routine.

What about his involvement with Guillermo Rigondeaux?

&gt;Here he is quoted as [saying he is](https://twitter.com/Ortiz_BoxingNBA/status/280479938635784193) (dated 16 Dec 12) per Team Rigondeaux [he's not](http://www.abs-cbnnews.com/sports/02/25/13/team-rigondeaux-denies-working-memo) 

What is Memo's contribution to designer drugs and what is his opinion on doping in sports?

&gt;“Designer drugs are composed of several different chemicals that trigger the desired reaction. At the end of the chain, I change one or two molecules in such a way that the entire structure is undetectable for the doping testers.

&gt;“Track and field, swimming, cross-country skiing and cycling can no longer be saved. Golf? Not clean, either. Soccer? Soccer players come to me and say they have to be able to run up and down the touchline without becoming tired, and they have to play every three days. Basketball players take fat burners like amphetamines, ephedrine. Baseball? Ha ha. Steroids in preseason, amphetamines during the games. Even archers take downers so that their arm remains steady. Everyone dopes.”

**What effect or benefit does working with Memo grant you? Said another way, what's the difference between Memo and someone else?**

On July 18th, 2007 Bolt's 100m time at the Vardinoyiannia was a personal best 10.03s . Less than a year later, May 3rd, 2008 he bests that with a 9.76s. That kind of elevation in performance in sprinting is suspect. One year later he set the world record with a 9.58s in Berlin. 

On November 11, 2011 Juan Manuel Marquez landed several overhand rights on the chin as he previously did against his nemesis Manny Pacquiao. Never once did Pacquiao go down or appear to be hurt. 1 year and 28 days later, on December 8, 2012 Pacquiao was out for the count and is still sound asleep in the MGM Grand. 

Okay now, May 21, 2013

Bradley is quoted by boxingscene.com as saying:

&gt;""If anyone was worried on either side, don't be. There will be double drug testing in this fight,"" Bradley told the paper. ""We'll do two drug tests so everyone will know we're clean athletes and that 100 percent of our heart is in our training and there's no cheating going on."" 

Excellent! Finally, when Marquez beats Bradley we'll know Marquez is a true GOAT and a clean athlete... or knows how to cycle properly. 

June 20, 2013, one month later nearly to the day. 

Marquez [speaks out](http://www.boxingscene.com/marquez-bradley-battle-over-rehydration-clause-testing--66837) (again via boxingscene): 

&gt;""Bradley he wants to do the anti-doping test. I'm ready for that. But this is not a rule for the fight. I want after the weigh in, I want Bradley not to [weigh] more than 10 pounds more because he is heavy. He's too big. This is not a rule but if he wants anti-doping test, I want him [not to weigh over] 10 pounds [after the weigh in]""

Why? At 5'6 Bradley is damn near exactly the same size as Marquez with only 2 fights at 147 (and Bradley nearly lost both by stoppage.) Let's compare their size.

Let's compare them to Pacquiao...

More from Marquez:

&gt;""Right now, a lot of fighters have tested positive and I'm against that situation because if you are, you are one step ahead of your opponent. So it's perfect. It's not a rule. He's asking for the anti-doping testing and I want that after the official weigh in that he doesn't weigh more than 10 pounds. I see him as a bigger fighter [and] that doesn't worry me but that could be an advantage for him the day of the fight.""

On June 21st, relentless Elie Seckbach [caught up with Tim.](http://youtu.be/nb7BOtwj684?t=1m26s) 

Bradley is quoted as saying:

&gt;If he wins, he's pursuing another Pacquiao fight. He'll fight anywhere but Asia. Pacquiao will KO Rios. **That's dumb. That ain't in my contract. He's gonna get tested. If Marquez did not get tested by VADA or USADA, both companies, NO FIGHT. The fight is over. That's what I said right now. He gotta get tested.** 

Are you saying Marquez is on PEDs (he's asked. 

&gt;**""No, I'm just saying. Shit, if I'm gonna do both, he's gotta do USADA and VADA. It's both companies in my contract. I don't give a shit what Bob say.**

Respect for Bradley. Hopefully he stays strong. Provodnikov needs a fight in the fall.

Because boxing is scored round by round it's really easy to have scores that differ from your overall reaction of the fight.

I'm curious if all of the people who are saying that the scores were bullshit and that 116-112 from one judge is unreasonable actually scored the fight.  I'm betting you didn't.

I scored this 114-114 with **six** rounds marked as basically even rounds that could have gone either way.  Looking at my scorecard that means I could easily have scored the fight anywhere from 9-3 Marquez to 9-3 Pacquiao and not thought twice about it.  

That means on my scorecard if I happened to call all of the razor thin rounds one way or the other I could **easily** scored this 117-111 to **either guy** and not been upset with it.  

Seeing a score of 116-112 means that one of the judges, who score the fight at ringside from one angle with no replay or commentary, saw two tossup rounds differently than I did.

Can you seriously watch that fight and tell me that there were no rounds you thought were basically even?  Can you tell me there was a decisive winner to the first round for instance?

At the end of the day this fight was amazingly close and the scores reflected that.  I don't see how anyone who is a serious boxing fan or who follows the sport and is not biased can call the outcome bullshit one way or the other.",,False,,t5_2qj0l,False,,,True,t3_mb0af,http://www.reddit.com/r/Boxing/comments/mb0af/this_is_why_i_always_score_big_fights/,

1365017420.0,88,self.Boxing,1blvp8,"This Saturday, history is being made...",101,13,39,http://www.reddit.com/r/Boxing/comments/1blvp8/this_saturday_history_is_being_made/,"This weekend marks something historic. Zou Shiming is making his professional boxing debut in Macao. It is a debut that will be watched by an estimated 500 million Chinese people. 

But the significance of this event has ramifications beyond one individual’s potential to be a superstar. To explain these ramifications, I must give a bit of a history lesson.

Different cultures like England, Russia, and Greece have an indigenous tradition of pugilism. Likewise, China also has such a tradition. 

About 2,000 years ago, a Chinese book entitled *The Combat Arts of Two Hands* appeared. It was a book exclusively about boxing techniques. Unfortunately, this book disappeared from print. Nevertheless, traditional Chinese martial arts such as Xingyiquan, Choi Lai Fat, and Wing Chun — while implementing techniques *beyond* boxing — place special emphasis on fist techniques. 

When Westerners came to China, they brought Western boxing with them.  At first, the sport in China appeared as an unregulated street sport pitting foreign sailers against local fighters who had experience in Chinese traditional martial arts. Western boxing became popular, and the sport grew rapidly.

In the 1920s, a book entitled *The Technique of Western Boxing* was translated into Chinese. This was followed up with sports academies putting Western boxing classes in their major curriculum. At the 1936 Berlin Olympics, China assigned 69 athletes as participants. Two of them were boxers. 

Then after World War II, boxing competitions began popping up in all major Chinese cities. The grandest boxing tournament in Chinese history had 142 participants show up in Beijing. The legendary Bruce Lee is known to have participated in an amateur boxing tournament.

Unfortunately, Western boxing was banned in China in 1959. It was believed that boxing was too brutal and too worthless — and had characteristics of capitalism. An entire generation of Chinese boxers were forced to hang up the gloves. 

Then in 1979, something changed. At the invitation of Chairman Deng Xiaoping, Muhammad Ali paid a visit to China. In their visit, Ali was seen hugging Deng. After this visit, Deng exclaimed, “If we want to win friends, if we want to win respect, we have to win medals”.

Boxing in China was reborn in 1987 when the ban was lifted. Chinese boxers began training again. Lacking the proper equipment, they used sandbags instead of boxing gloves. There was an obvious gulf in quality between China and the rest of the world, but with persistent effort, once again China competed in boxing at the 1992 Barcelona Olympics. 

Then in 2004, Zou Shiming won bronze at the Athens Olympics. In doing so, he became the first Chinese to actually medal. If this was Shiming’s lone achievement, it would be significant. But he was just getting started.

In 2005 and 2007, Shiming won gold in the World Amateur Championships. It became apparent that Shiming was someone truly special. During this time, he developed a rivalry with Pürevdorjiin Serdamba of Mongolia — who beat Shiming in the 2007 Asian Championship Games.

Then 2008 Beijing Olympics came. Shiming met Serdamba in the finals. Millions of Chinese tuned to watch these rivals compete. In the course of the fight, Serdamba was forced to retire due to injury. Zou burst into tears. He had won China’s first ever Olympic boxing gold medal.

China would win another boxing gold medal in the 2008 Olympics. Zhang Xiaoping would win one at light heavyweight. These two medals marked China's arrival as a power in amateur boxing.

But there was no doubt that Shiming was Chinese boxing’s biggest star. After the 2008 Olympics, Shiming would win gold 2010 Asian Games as well as the 2011 World Amateur Championships. Many began to wonder if Shiming could pull off a rarity and win another Olympic gold medal in London.

At 31-years-old, Shiming entered the finals against Kaeo Pongprayoon of Thailand. With controversy, Shiming narrowly won with scores of 13-10. In this, he won his second Olympic gold medal.

Which now brings us to this moment in time. Zou Shiming, China’s most famous combat sports athlete, is making his debut this Saturday. 

China already has a championship fighter in Ziong Zhao Zhong who holds the WBC title at minimumweight. They also have several exciting prospects in the pro ranks — one of whom is Rex Tso who’s promoted by Ricky Hatton.

But just as Zou Shiming marked China as a great power in amateur boxing, his debut next Saturday may potentially mark them as a great power in professional boxing. The whole world will be watching him — including America where the event will be broadcast on HBO2. 

What will the future hold? Brian Viloria, who’s also fighting on the card, holds the WBA and WBO flyweight titles. Shiming and Viloria are primed for a showdown in 2014.

Should a Shiming-Viloria fight happen, this will be one of the most watched fights in boxing history.",,False,,t5_2qj0l,1365021614.0,,,True,t3_1blvp8,http://www.reddit.com/r/Boxing/comments/1blvp8/this_saturday_history_is_being_made/,

Vid to follow but not for a week or so (tech).

I definitely out boxed him and was fitter than him but the guy punches so so fucking hard it isn't true. Also from the first time he hit me my plan went out the window and we brawled. Also I kept letting him have straight rights down the pipe into my face: I have bad head movement anyway and after the first one I stopped boxing smart - also I thought I could wear it and come back with an overhand right and I did do this quite impressively a few times - but dukeing it out with someone who has about two stone on you is a pretty stupid move

Won the first round and some people think if it had gone on for thirty seconds longer I would have had him out of there. I think that is a very very generous assessment.

Second round he hit me the way a train hits you - blood everywhere, and it was all I could do to get out of the round. Indeed I am very very proud of myself for not quitting there and then. I didn't even go down, although maybe I should have.

Third round we were both very gunshy - him because he was knackered and me because I was still seriously hurting from the second round. So we stalked each other for a while and then when we finally closed it all got very messy but he definitely got the better of it with his power and with my total inability to get my face out of harm's way. Judges gave it to him 29-28 which is totally fair.

Anyway:

* Thanks for all your advice, energy wise I think I got it totally right so thanks to all of you esp [u/12_rounds](http://www.reddit.com/user/12_rounds) whose plan I followed. I enjoyed that fucking banana
* I've always had a lot of respect for anyone who steps into the ring - especially the pros - even if they are not very good. That respect has just gone up to a whole other level. Jesus guys how do you wear those kind of shots for 12 rounds? You are supermen.
* I don't feel at all bad about losing. I gave it my all and I'm not going to die wondering.

What happened next was incredible. This year's first Fight of the Year candidate! [SPOILER]",83,8,15,http://www.reddit.com/r/Boxing/comments/16xw7c/on_last_nights_offtv_undercard_a_no_hope_italian/,"First, if you want to watch the fight, Top Rank has archived [video of last night's undercard](http://www.toprank.tv/shared/media/player/entry.jsp?view_key=TOPRANK_TV&amp;source=TOPRANK&amp;sponsor=TOPRANK_MEDIAPLAYER&amp;media_type=video&amp;fight_key=2013_01_19_salido_garcia&amp;calendar_event_id=195-104483&amp;content_id=25557499) on their website. Fast forward ahead if you want to see this in all its gruesome detail.

Now to talk about what happened. Coming into the fight, Ferrante had every disadvantage in the world. 

He was at a height disadvantage: Ferrante is 5'11"" compared to Akberbayev who is 6'3"". Ferrante also had a reach disadvantage: 73"" compared to Akberbayev's 75 1/2"". Finally, this was Ferrante's first time ever fighting as a full blown cruiserweight — every other fight was at or near light heavyweight.

Ferrante was also coming off two straight losses in a row: to Dhafir Smith (25-22-7) and Omar Sheika (31-11-0). His record of 12(7)-4 wasn't as pretty as Akberbayev's 10(7)-0. 

Watching both men enter the ring, it was apparent that Ferrante was booked to be beat — like every other b-side on the off-TV undercard. The thing is, nobody told Ferrante this.

In R1, Ferrante shocked everybody by knocking Akberbayev to the canvas. Right after Akberbayev finished his mandatory 8 count, he got up and swiftly knocked down Ferrante. It was apparent this was going to be a fight.

Akberbayev knew afterwards that he had impose his will on Ferrante. In R2, he visibly hurt Ferrante with a series of straight right hands in the corner, but Ferrante hung on until the bell ended the round. Finally, it looked like things were going to script.

R3-5 were all Akberbayev. He was punishing Ferrante for R1's insolence. How dare Ferrante come to fight! Yet, in all this excitement Ferrante seemed to find Akberbayev's weakness. He couldn't miss with right hand counters. It didn't matter, though. Akberbayev's activity and aggression seemed to be winning him the fight.

But things changed in R6. A right hook by Ferrante opened a large gash over Akberbayev's eye. The sight of his own blood seemed to incite terror in Akberbayev — sapping all his aggression. 

Ferrante seized the moment. From that moment on, he did not let up. Pumping the jab, he worked the cut until it was so big, you could visibly see the bone. The tide had turned!

In R9, it was apparent Akberbayev no longer wanted to engage. He continued running from corner to corner — prompting Ferrante to say, ""I could chase you all day!"" Akberbayev finally threw some punches but Ferrante got the best of him even then.

Right before the final round came, Ferrante's corner implored him to finish the fight. ""You're clearly winning this,"" they said, ""but the judges won't let you! You got to knock him out!""

Watching this fight, I knew this to be correct. There's a reason a no hoper is a no hoper — not only do you have to beat your opponent, you have to beat the judges too!

Was Ferrante going to heed his corner's advice or was he just going to survive? At the start of R10, it looked like the latter. But then, Ferrante pinned Akberbayev to the corner. He unloaded with vicious hooks all over Akberbayev's head and body. In all this excitement Akberbayev seemed to have regained his aggression — but it was all for nought.

At 1:19 of R10 (the final round), Ferrante threw a perfect yet terrible short right hook to Akberbayev's head.

Akberbayev collapsed to the canvas face first — cold! The sight was both chilling and sensational. For several minutes, Akberbayev remained motionless as doctors and cornermen attempted to revive him. Eventually, Akberbayev was able to regain consciousness and walk out of the arena on his own two feet.

With this win, Ferrante did the complete unexpected. A no hope Italian kid from Philadelphia won a no hope fight. ",,False,,t5_2qj0l,False,,,True,t3_16xw7c,http://www.reddit.com/r/Boxing/comments/16xw7c/on_last_nights_offtv_undercard_a_no_hope_italian/,

1321327643.0,72,self.Boxing,mcm92,The Beginner's Guide to Watching Good Boxing Fights,78,6,26,http://www.reddit.com/r/Boxing/comments/mcm92/the_beginners_guide_to_watching_good_boxing_fights/,"*I've noticed we're getting quite a few new boxing fans in this subreddit. As a service to these new fans, I wanted to create this simple guide to finding good fights. This will save you time and misery, and will make your viewing experience that much more enjoyable.*

""Every time I attempt to get into boxing, I come away disappointed,"" is a common complaint that's echoed amongst prospective new fans, along with, ""Do the good fights ever happen?""

Be assured that they do happen, but as with any sport, it takes a bit of knowledge to find a good match up. If you want a more rewarding boxing experience, here's a handy guide on how to separate the wheat from the chaff.

But first, let me answer what seems to be the most obvious question:

**Why am I not watching the good fights?**

If you're from North America, the juggernaut of boxing broadcasting is HBO. For the past few years the content on HBO has been suffering. The reason for this is due to Ross Greenburg, president of HBO Sports from 2000-2011. 

Ross Greenburg has never been a boxing fan, and has never liked dealing with boxing promoters. In fact, it's commonly known in the boxing world that Greenburg loathed building good boxing match-ups, and gave boxers who didn't deserve it high paydays -- even though they didn't bring in high ratings.

Thankfully, Greenburg has been fired from HBO, replaced by Ken Hershman -- the guy responsible for take Showtime from zero to hero in the boxing world, despite having a significantly lower budget than HBO. This means better fights are on the horizon.

Unfortunately, the fights booked on HBO are still on the agenda for the rest of the year -- the good fights won't be seen till 2012.

**Where can I find the good fights now?**

For American viewers, the best boxing fights are broadcast on Showtime, followed by ESPN2. While the talent is not necessarily top tier, it is *near* top tier -- and offers more entertainment value than the heavily hyped fights on HBO.

But if you're unconcerned about top level talent, and just want to see a good show, there's more options. Telemundo, Fox Deportes, and TeleFutura are all American Spanish TV networks that regularly match up-and-comers with grizzled vets. The result is often KOs, upsets, and assorted fireworks.

If you are more adventurous, and want to seek out what the International scene has to offer, find a BoxNation stream -- a British TV channel that offers 24 hours boxing content. Other great channels are TyC in Argentina, Main Event in Australia, TV Azteca in Mexico, and RTL in Germany.

**Do talented fighters make good fights?**

Not necessarily. Good fights are about good styles match-ups, not good fighters. If you put two fighters in the ring, and their styles don't ""gel"", the result will be a snoozer. What you need to find are two fighters with opposing styles that complement each other.

Understanding styles may take time, but for a good introduction to this topic, please see [Wikipedia's article on boxing styles](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boxing#Boxing_styles).

**How often do good fights happen?**

Literally every week. Nearly a hundred fights happen each week, so there's bound to be a few of them.

The reason why these fights don't necessarily get a whole lot of love is because boxing is a sport with international appeal, so finding a good fight is kind of like globetrotting. Thankfully, with the Internet, every high profile international fight is a click a way, and is often available on YouTube within 24 hours.

**What's the profile of a good fight?**

Before tuning in to a fight, see if the fighters in question are out to prove themselves or just want a payday. If one fighter is on the edge of retirement and has successive losses, the fights not going to be good. On the other hand, if there's a lot on the line, and a win promises bigger and better things -- chances are there will be fireworks.

Another factor (as previously alluded) is styles. If you match to counterpunchers together, as in Mayweather-Marquez, the result will be a snoozefest. However, if you match a boxer-puncher against a counterpuncher, as in Pacquiao-Marquez, the result will be fireworks. Brawlers are almost always crowdpleasers, even against themselves -- as was the case with the Gatti-Ward trilogy.

Finally, look at a fighter's resume. If you see that a particular fighter fought a few noteworthy names -- even if the result was a few losses -- it may be because he leaves it all in the ring every time. One example of such a fighter is Michael Katsidis. Though he's had consecutive losses against Juan Manuel Marquez, Robert Guerrero, and Ricky Burns, he always pushes his opponents to bring out their best.

**If a fight is a Pay Per view, does that mean it will live up to the hype?**

No. Pay-per-views are based on the names on the main event, not the quality of fight. As mentioned before, good fights are based on styles match-ups, not names. This is why certain high profile PPVs, such as Pacquiao-Clottey, ended up as disappointments. 

In contrast, there are fights between no-name fighters, broadcast on free TV, that become legendary. A good example of this would be Wolak-Rodriguez I, which was broadcast on ESPN2 for free. This was a classic styles match-up between an out-boxer and swarmer.

So am I saying that it's never worth it to buy a PPV? Not at all. Look for main events that are sequels, as well as an undercard with good styles match-ups. This will insure that your PPV is enjoyable every time.

**What about potential legendary superfights?**

Sadly, few of them ever live up to the hype. Lennox Lewis vs. Mike Tyson was a potential superfight that broke pay per view records. It resulted in a ho hum fight. Oscar de la Hoya vs. Floyd Mayweather broke Tyson-Lewis' record, but has since been lowly regarded due to de la Hoya being over-the-hill.

That said, there are a few that do live up to the hype. Marvin Hagler vs. Thomas Hearns has since been regarded as the definitive fight of the 80s. Likewise, Muhammad Ali vs. Joe Frazier has attained mythical status.

The key, as in all fights, is the styles match-ups.

**How do I get started?**

Keep informed. The best way to start is by gauging what boxing *fans* think of a fight, not what the promoters think of it.

Beyond that, check up on post fight analyses, then keep them under your hat for future reference. A good place to start is [Boxing Scene](http://boxingscene.com) as well as [Fight News](http://fightnews.com).

Finally, go into a fight with an open mind, and be prepared for anything.",,False,,t5_2qj0l,False,,,True,t3_mcm92,http://www.reddit.com/r/Boxing/comments/mcm92/the_beginners_guide_to_watching_good_boxing_fights/,

1360021415.0,64,self.Boxing,17wc58,Prepare to have some myths shattered! A Statistical Breakdown of the Heavyweight Division,70,6,43,http://www.reddit.com/r/Boxing/comments/17wc58/prepare_to_have_some_myths_shattered_a/,"I decided to do an analytical breakdown of where the heavyweight division is now and where it is going. Why? Because the heavyweight division remains boxing’s glamour division. It is the division with the most casual appeal. 

The best means of assessing boxing’s health is to therefore assess the heavyweight division.

As you’ll see next, I’m about to bust a few myths about the heavyweight division. The most prominent thought from armchair analysts is that all the talent that *would* have gone into heavyweight boxing is now concentrated in American football and basketball. Why put in the risk for heavyweight boxing when the rewards of American football are so much greater?

This simply is not true. In fact, the “fall” of American heavyweight talent actually presents a quite different story.

I will now present an overall analysis of the world heavyweight scene, along with upcoming prospects in order to gauge where the division is moving towards.

First, it is almost worthless to gauge the rankings from the “Big Four” ranking bodies (WBA, WBC, IBF, WBO). The reason is that much of what you see there is quite political, and much of their rankings are contingent upon geography. For instance, why is Kyotaro Fujimoto ranked 25th by the WBC when he has a 5-1 record? It's because he recently challenged for an OPBF belt — a regional title that counts for little in today’s heavyweight scene.

In order to assess who is the highest quality heavyweights, I therefore had to turn to two sources: unbiased computerized ranking systems (Boxrec and IBO) and editorial journalism (ESPN, Badlefthook.com, RING Magazine). 

As well, nationality is a sticky point in regards to boxing. I’ve therefore decided to list both a fighter’s country of origin as well as country of residence. Finally, I’ve decided *not* to list the Klitschkos. The reason for this is that they’re the champs, and they’ll probably remain so until they retire.

Without further adieu:

RING Magazine:

	1.	Alexander Povetkin - Russia
	2.	David Haye - UK
	3.	Kubrat Pulev - Bulgaria
	4.	Tomasz Adamek - Poland / USA
	5.	Robert Helenius - Finland / Germany
	6.	Denis Boytsov - Russia / Germany
	7.	Chris Arreola - USA
	8.	Tyson Fury - UK

As you can see here, all five sources are consistent in who’s at the top of the division. The only notable differences are RING Magazine ranking Boytsov in their top 10 and ESPN ranking Arreola as #2 and Pulev as #7.

Now a few interesting facts pop out at me:

*	Apart from Robert Helenius, everyone in the top 10 is either from the USA, the UK, or a communist/post-communist state. In Odlanier Solis’ case, he’s from Cuba yet resides in the USA.
*	In the top 25, here’s the fighters who *aren’t* from the USA / UK / (post-)communist state: Robert Helenius, Francesco Pianeta, Manuel Charr, Jean Marc Mormeck.
*	Even as the media mourns the death of American heavyweights, the USA still has great representation in the division. Nearly half of today’s heavyweights either originate in the USA or have their place of residence there.
*	It is easy to surmise that almost half of today’s heavyweights wouldn’t be able to compete if there was still an iron curtain.
*	A prominent number of heavyweights who originate in (post-)communist countries now reside in the USA. Examples: Tomasz Adamek, Odlanier Solis, Vyacheslav Glazkov
*	While there are many elite heavyweights that reside in Germany, none place Germany as their country of origin. Most originate from (post-)communist countries. Only Robert Helenius and Manuel Charr don’t originate from a (post-)communist state.

This is all well and good, but what would the heavyweight division look like if we completely *removed* fighters who originated from a (post-)communist state? Using Boxrec as the metric: this is what it would look like

	1.	David Haye - UK
	2.	Tyson Fury - UK
	3.	Robert Helenius - Germany / Finland
	4.	Johnathan Banks - USA
	5.	Tony Thompson - USA
	6.	David Price - UK
	7.	Steve Cunningham - USA
	8.	Chris Arreola - USA
	9.	Francesco Pianeta - Germany / Italy
	10.	 Franklin Lawrence - USA
	11.	 Seth Mitchell - USA
	12.	 Dereck Chisora - UK
	13.	 Manuel Charr - Lebanon / Germany
	14.	 Bryant Jennings - USA
	15.	 Amir Mansour - USA
	16.	 Deontay Wilder - USA
	17.	 Carlos Takam - Cameroon / France
	18.	 Michael Sprott - UK
	19.	 Fabio Moli - Argentina
	20.	 Tony Grano - USA
	21.	 Bermaine Stiverne - Canada / USA
	22.	 Edmund Gerber - Germany
	23.	 Malik Scott - USA
	24.	 Travis Walker - USA
	25.	 Maurice Harris - USA

As you can see above, not factoring (post-)communist countries, there are 5 Americans in the top 10. As far as the top 25 is concerned, 13 originate in the USA. The only other country with large representation is the UK: 3 are in the top 10 and 5 are in the top 25. Curiously, Edmund Gerber is the only one who both resides in Germany and originates in Germany. 
Thus, I deduce that America is not doing badly whatsoever regarding heavyweights. Rather, now that fighters who originate in (post-)communist states are able to compete as pros, they’re doing pretty well for themselves.

This is all interesting as a snapshot for *now*, but what about the future? I decided to take a look at heavyweight prospects. To determine who is/is not a heavyweight prospect, I used a crude metric:

*	Must be undefeated
*	Must be 30-years-old or younger

According to Boxrec, these are the highest rated prospects:

	1.	Tyson Fury - UK
	2.	Robert Helenius - Finland / Germany
	3.	Vyacheslav Glazkov - Ukraine / USA
	4.	David Price - UK
	5.	Francesco Pianeta - Italy / Germany
	6.	Denis Boytsov - Russia / Germany
	7.	Bryant Jennings - USA
	8.	Andrzej Wawrzyk - Poland
	9.	Deontay Wilder - USA
	10.	 Artur Szpilka - Poland
	11.	 Andy Ruiz Jr. - Mexico / USA
	12.	 Joe Hanks - USA
	13.	 Erkan Teper - Germany
	14.	 Alexander Flores - USA
	15.	 Oscar Rivas - Colombia / Canada
	16.	 Vincent Thompson - USA
	17.	 Ahror Muralimov - Uzbekistan
	18.	 Matteo Modugno - Italy
	19.	 Arnold Gjergjaj - Switzerland
	20.	 Andriy Rudenko - Ukraine / USA
	21.	 Fred Allen - USA
	22.	 Richard Carmack - USA
	23.	 Bogdan Dinu - Romania
	24.	 Tomasz Hutkowski - Poland
	25.	 Newfel Ouata - France

The IBO shows a similar picture. Please note that because the IBO only ranks 100 fighters per division on their website, here’s the only fighters who fit my metric:

	1.	Robert Helenius - Finland / USA
	2.	Tyson Fury - UK
	3.	Vyacheslav Glazkov - Ukraine / USA
	4.	Francesco Pianeta - Italy / Germany
	5.	David Price - UK
	6.	Bryant Jennings - USA
	7.	Andrzej Wawrzyk - Poland
	8.	Deontay Wilder - USA
	9.	Denis Boytsov - Russia / Germany
	10.	 Artur Szpilka - Poland
	11.	 Erkan Teper - Germany
	12.	 Andriy Rudenko - Ukraine / USA
	13.	 Joe Hanks - USA
	14.	 Andy Ruiz Jr - Mexico / USA

Boxrec shows 7 Americans that originate in the USA are far as the top 25 prospects are concerned. The IBO shows 3 fighters who originate in the USA as country of origin. 

Yet what’s also interesting here is that, according to Boxrec, 10 heavyweight prospects *reside* in the USA. What’s going on here? 

As it turns out, a (post-)communist prospect is now just as likely to reside in the USA as Germany. In the case of Vyacheslav Glazkov, he’s becoming a genuine American draw who’s now featured on NBC Sports Network *twice* in three months!

All across the eastern seaboard of the US, there’s been a surge of Eastern European immigration. In their new homeland, these immigrants are passionate about boxing. It’s this fanbase that has made Tomasz Adamek a star, Artur Szpilka an emerging star, and Vyacheslav Glazkov a soon-to-be star. 

The split between the USA and Eastern European scene is soon going to blur.

But just for shits and giggles, what would the top 25 prospects look like if we removed (post-)communist fighters from the equation? Here you go:

	1.	Tyson Fury - UK
	2.	Robert Helenius - Finland / Germany
	3.	David Price - UK
	4.	Francesco Pianeta - Italy / Germany
	5.	Bryant Jennings - USA
	6.	Deontay Wilder - USA
	7.	 Andy Ruiz Jr. - Mexico / USA
	8.	 Joe Hanks - USA
	9.	 Erkan Teper - Germany
	10.	 Alexander Flores - USA
	11.	 Oscar Rivas - Colombia / Canada
	12.	 Vincent Thompson - USA
	13.	 Matteo Modugno - Italy
	14.	 Arnold Gjergjaj - Switzerland
	15.	 Fred Allen - USA
	16.	 Richard Carmack - USA
	17.	 Newfel Ouata - France
	18.	 Gary Cornish - UK
	19.	 Michael Wallisch - Germany
	20.	 Daniel Martz - USA
	21.	 Justin Jones - USA
	22.	 Dillian Whyte - UK
	23.	 Aaron Green - USA
	24.	 Didier Bence - Canada
	25.	 Jordan Shimmell - USA

Removing (post-)communist countries from the equation, here’s the breakdown of country of origin:

	*	11 Americans
	*	4 British
	*	2 Italians
	*	2 Germans
	*	1 Mexican
	*	1 Colombian
	*	1 Finn
	*	1 Canadian
	*	1 French
	*	1 Swiss

The continental breakdown is as follows:

	*	13 North Americans
	*	11 Europeans
	*	1 South American

What’s the point of all this? Simply this: Americans are probably doing just as good as they did before. However, now that fighters originating from a (post-)communist country are able to compete, American domination is no longer a certainty.

Even as Eastern Europeans now compete professionally, a good number of them have opted to reside in the USA — taking advantage of the zeal that Eastern European immigrants have for boxing. 

These are interesting times for the heavyweight division.",,False,,t5_2qj0l,1360098306.0,,,True,t3_17wc58,http://www.reddit.com/r/Boxing/comments/17wc58/prepare_to_have_some_myths_shattered_a/,

1359000394.0,66,self.Boxing,1765io,Had an interesting run in with Floyd this morning...,78,12,43,http://www.reddit.com/r/Boxing/comments/1765io/had_an_interesting_run_in_with_floyd_this_morning/,"...at an airport. He was in baggage claim with The Money Team. They were fetching the luggage (Miss Jackson included) from the carousel and his huge body guy was with him against the wall. I politely ask the body guy if I can take a pic. He said no, which is cool--I figured my odds were slim. Floyd looks at me and flashes the #1 sign as I turn to walk away--he heard my request as he was an arms length from said huge body guy. I quietly but enthusiastically say, ""Big fan. Good luck against Guerrero"" as I'm walking away. He immediately changes his face from a tired 'acknowledgement to a fan type of face' to a confused face. He repeatedly barks at me, ""Who's Guerrero?!"" I'm immediately confused by his mood change. He waves his white body guy--who I've seen in 24/7 eps--over and I slide away to the carousel. I look back and they're looking at me.

I'm smirking away from them. I just got the Mayweather mouth barking at me!  Haha how bizarre? But wait...what's even more bizarre is his reversal of mood at the mention of Guerrero. Shit did I mix up oponents? It's early and before I went to his body guy I had to remind myself Guerrero, not Castillo :). Nope, definitely said Guerrero. Just googled and it lookes like GBP was going to lock him up this week. Okay so why the denial? Maybe he's worn out from the flight, pissed at Guerrero, pissed that I'd wish him luck or is it off with Guerrero?

Call me crazy, but the last case may be the reason. He had no reason to acknowledge me, so to do that and then get salty so early in the morning tells me I struck a nerve. Mind you, I was in his presence for like five seconds. Something with Guerrero has to be up.

It's likely none of the above. We'll see. Regardless, I figured r/boxing would enjoy an anecdote about the #1 p4p fighter! 

**edit**: I wrote this draft this morning, but didn't post...and then THIS came out:

http://sports.yahoo.com/news/floyd-mayweather-robert-guerrero-bout-just-rumor-004200679--box.html

I totally struck a nerve this morning. Fucking crazy! 

FWIW, I'm a Floyd fan and wouldn't be too interested in a Guerrero fight. I don't think Canelo is likely, but IMHO Guerrero would be easily outmatched.

&gt;All we know is that Mayweather felt the need to make his statement directly to the public while Schaefer apparently felt the need to go directly to the media in response. Of course, the timing could all be a coincidence, but that would be unlikely.

Did I necessitate this statement? Ha--again how bizarre.

1357725762.0,63,self.Boxing,168q7m,"Boxing 101: Champions, Titles, and Rankings",70,7,25,http://www.reddit.com/r/Boxing/comments/168q7m/boxing_101_champions_titles_and_rankings/,"The question of who the ""true"" boxing champion gets asked a lot. However, there has never been a universal sanctioning body that decides this — just common consensus of who the champion should be. 

In this post, I'm going to help you make sense of boxing's somewhat confusing labyrinth of championships, titles, and rankings.

### So how is it that there's a lineage of champions stretching down from 18th century England?

Simple. The ""championship"" is decided when the two best acknowledged fighters step in the ring. This is called the [lineal championship](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lineal_championship).

### Who are the acknowledged lineal champions today?
The acknowledged lineal championship list is quite short. The lineal champions today are:

* Wladimir Klitschko — Heavyweight
* Chad Dawson — Light heavyweight 
* Andre Ward — Super middleweight
* Sergio Martinez — Middleweight
* Nonito Donaire — Super bantamweight
* Toshiyuki Igarashi — Flyweight

### So is the lineal champion the best in his division?
No. For example, Igarashi is the lineal flyweight champion mostly out of luck. 

Igarashi won it in a close split decision win against Sonny Boy Jaro — a journeyman fighter who himself won the lineal championship by beating Pongsaklek Wonjongkam just as Pongsaklek got old.

The best flyweight, doubtlessly, is WBA and WBO titlist Brian Viloria — who has beaten Hernan Marquez, Omar Nino Romero, Giovani Segura, and Julio Cesar Miranda.

### What's the deal with sanctioning body titles?
Think of titles simply as a trophy that some organizations (of variable prestige) award fighters. The best comparison I can make is to tennis.

In tennis, there is various tournaments like the Wimbledon. You play in matches, win enough of them, until you reach the final. Whoever wins the final wins the Wimbledon.

Boxing works generally the same way. The IBF, for instance, creates eliminators for fighters they rank highly. These eliminators are essentially tournaments to decide who gets to fight for their title. The winner of the tournament becames the mandatory opponent for the IBF title.

Mind you, it doesn't always work this way. Each sanctioning body has their own qualificatons and guidelines for who gets to fight for their title — each with variable consistency.

### But what's more important: the championship or a title?
Becoming a recognized lineal champion is much more prestigious than holding a title. The lineal championship happens because ""the man beat the man"". However, there's no canonical lineal championship — just a general appraisal.

A title, especially from a reputable sanctioning body, is still a tremendous achievement. It's glitter around your waist. Moreover, it has an organization that gives a fighter recognition. To a fighter, holding a title is the difference between getting attention and not getting attention — so it's still damn important.

### What about rankings?
Each sanctioning body has their own rankings. However, most of them are quite political in nature and subject to questionable lobbying.

Traditionally, the most reputable rankings were done by RING Magazine — so much so that the RING championship was generally indistinguishable from the lineal championship. However, with RING Magazine being bought by Golden Boy Promotions, RING Magazine's quality has slipped.

Recently, Boxrec's rankings have increased in reputedness due to being both computerized and having an exhaustive array of data. However, even Boxrec isn't immune from criticism. That said, Boxrec is generally less biased than the sanctioning bodies and promoters.

### Why isn't there a boxing league like there is with football or basketball?
Actually, there is. It's called the [World Series of Boxing](http://www.worldseriesboxing.com/) and it's run by AIBA. The talent there is generally top notch with many boxers having participated in the Olympics.

However, the WSB has thus failed to capture the imagination of boxing fans. The majority of pro boxing, though anarchic, is still competitive and has given us some of the most memorable fights in combat sports.

Until the WSB gives us the equivalent of the Gatti-Ward trilogy or the Pacquiao-Marquez quadrilogy, nobody's going to care about whoever wins their championships. The best championship will remain the acclaimed consensus lineal championship.",,False,,t5_2qj0l,1357755065.0,,,True,t3_168q7m,http://www.reddit.com/r/Boxing/comments/168q7m/boxing_101_champions_titles_and_rankings/,

* Daniel Geale defeated Felix Sturm, uniting the IBF and WBA titles in the process
* Gennady Golovkin KOed Grzegorz Proksa in 4 rounds live on HBO
* Legit Super Middleweight champion Andre Ward wins against Legit Light Heavyweight champion Chad Dawson by TKO victory
* After getting knocked down, Tomasz Adamek goes to war against Travis Walker, stopping Walker in the 5th round
* Potential FOTY happens with Marcos Maidana going to war against Jesus Soto Karass
* Legit Middleweight champion Sergio Martinez dominates Julio Cesar Chavez Jr for 11 1/2 rounds before *almost* getting stopped at the last minute, but manages to stay on his feet.
* Ricky Burns makes his case as the best Lightweight in the world by stopping Kevin Mitchell in the 4th round.
* After being knocked down, and trailing on the cards, Juan Carlos Sanchez blasts Rodel Mayol *through* the ropes, out of the ring, and onto the broadcasting table!
* Cecilia Braekhus stakes her claim as the world's best female boxer with a dominant win against Anne Sophie Mathis

Holy shit! By any stretch of the imagination, this was an eventful month in boxing. 

Yet, despite all this exciting activity, a whole lot of people would rather talk about a fight that will *never* happen: Mayweather-Pacquiao. While this fight would have been interesting back in 2009, years have past by, and I'm no longer convinced we'll see either fighter at their best if it happened now.

There's no reason to get excited about fights that won't happen. 

I'm not excited about Sergio Martinez vs. Andre Ward,  Canelo Alvarez vs. Julio Cesar Chavez Jr., or Vitali Klitschko vs. Wladimir Klitschko. These are all fights *not* happening, so there's just no good reason to discuss them.

Boxing is much more interesting when you tune in to the fights that *are* happening. Donaire is going to fight Nishioka. Brandon Rios is going to fight Mike Alvarado. Brian Viloria is going to fight Hernan Marquez.

Williams keeping his distance and launching hard jabs whenever Johnson gets into the killzone.

*10-9 Williams*

***Round 2:*** Williams and Johnson both exchanging at the center of the ring. Williams looks to be hurting Johnson with his hard combos. Things getting slightly scrappy here as both fight on the inside. Johnson gets a few shots in, but they're not troubling Williams. Ref stops the fight so Johnson can gather his mouthpiece. Both exchanging at the ring, with Johnson beginning to trouble Williams.

*10-9 Williams, 20-18 Williams*

***Round 3:*** Johnson hurts Williams causing Williams to do a jig at the center of the ring. Now both these men are going toe-to-toe, banging each other up again and again. Williams now crowding Johnson, hoping to suffocate his offence. Johnson, for his part, is tiring but still able to get in his shots. Wild shot by Williams gets in! Johnson falls into the ropes! Williams pounces! The ref stops the fight!

**Official Results:** Williams TKO3 Johnson.

## Omar Figueroa vs. Abner Cotto
***Round 1:*** Figueroa going for the kill early. He pounces on Cotto and doesn't let up. Left hook brings down Cotto. Once Cotto gets to his feat and beats the count, Figueroa hits him with a body shot. Cotto goes down again. He can't get up.

**Official Results:** Figueroa KO1 Cotto.

## Jermall Charlo vs. Orlando Lora
***Round 1:*** Charlo pumping the jab, waiting for Lora to come forward. And as Lora, comes in, Charlo nails him. Charlo keeps pumping the jab, dinging Lora over and over again. Lora to the body. Now Charlo comes at Lora with a chopping right. Lora keeps coming forward, not adjusting, and Charlo is more than happy to hurt him as he comes in.

*10-9 Charlo*

***Round 2:*** Lora's face is already busted up. I can't imagine this going for very long either. Lora is trying to be more careful, though, but Charlo's jab continues to find the target. Lora finds himself inside, is able to mix things up, but Charlo is replying with his own shots. Charlo is now doubling down with the hooks, and Lora's not reacting well to them.

*10-9 Charlo, 20-18 Charlo*

***Round 3:*** Charlo's jabs are setting him up nicely for the left hook. Lora keeps getting dinged as he comes forward. You got to wonder how many of these jabs and hooks Lora's going to eat. Points for Lors for toughness since he just keeps coming forward and closing the distance. 

*10-9 Charlo, 30-27 Charlo*

***Round 4:*** Lora keeps coming forward, never letting off the gas pedal. As he comes forward, Charlo lets off one of his vicious hooks. Even when Lora comes in close, Charlo's defense makes it hard for him to connect cleanly. As the round goes on, Lora's eye looks more and more messed up.

*10-9 Charlo, 40-36 Charlo*

**Official Results:** Ref takes a look at Lora's eye and stops the fight. Charlo TKO4 Lora.

## Austin Trout vs. Canelo Alvarez
***Round 1:*** Trout moves first, feeling Canelo out with the jab. Canelo couterpunches with his own. Trout staying on the outside, then follows his jabs with a straight to the body. Canelo backs Trout up to the ropes, gets a few off. Trout now with a hook gets in cleanly. Canelo tries to get his own in, lunges, and Trout makes him pay. Then Canelo swarms Trout, tries for the body, but doesn't hit Trout cleanly.

*10-9 Trout*

***Round 2:*** Trout keeps pumping the jab at the center of the ring. Canelo gets one to the body, but he's not getting as many punches off as Trout. Canelo moves Trout to the corner and hopes to get a few off, but Trout landed the straight. Canelo just got in a nice punch! The crowd goes wild, but Trout takes it well. Canelo doing a better job of measuring the distance. Trout continues with the jab, but Canelo is beginning to time Trout.

*10-9 Canelo, 19-19*

***Round 3:*** Trout continues with the jab. Canelo is now trying with his own jab, but Trout lets off some combos. Canelo lunges, then Trout turns him at the ropes. 1-2 by Canelo, and he follows that up with a straight. Trout now unloads with jabs, and straights to the body. They're beginning to mix it up. Trouts jabs keeping Canelo honest, as he's not able to get inside. But he does get in one body shot. The exchange at the bell.

*10-9 Trout, 29-28 Trout*

***Round 4:*** Canelo stalking Trout. With a stiff jab, Trout rocks Canelo's head back. Canelo replies with his own. Canelo now powering up his volume. Trout now sending more jabs to the body.

*10-9 Canelo, 38-38*

##Sergio Martinez vs. Martin Murray
**Round 1:** Mostly a feeling out round. Both fighters eemingly trying to find their range. Sergio was slightly busier.

*10-9 Martinez, 10-9 Martinez*

**Round 2:** Murray did very little. Easy round for Martinez. Nothing huge landed though.

*10-9 Martinez, 20-18 Marintez*

**Round 3:** Close round. Probably a slight edge to Martinez. Murray throwing a little more. Martinez may be getting frustrated a little by Martin's defense. Could probably go either way.

*10-9 Martinez, 30-27 Martinez*

**Round 4:** Martin making contact more. Accidental low blow by Martin. Murray coming out of his shell and showing aggressive. Slight edge to Murray.

*10-9 Murray, 39-37 Martinez*

**Round 5:** Very close round. Both fighters landing a few decent shots. Could go either way but I'll give a slight edge to Murray for his early work in the round.

*10-9 Murray, 48-47 Martinez*

**Round 6:** Martinez bleeding outside left eye. Good round for Murray. Murray is really disrupting Martinez's rhythm.

*10-9 Murray, 57-57 Even* 

**Round 7:** Close round. Murray starting to fight dirty. Close but slight edge to Martinez but could go either way.

*10-9 Martinez, 67-66 Martinez*

**Round 8:** Martinez was doing good early but then knocked down half way through. Even when Sergio connects, Murray comes right back.

*10-8 Murray, 75-76 Murray*

**Round 9:** Very close round. Murray did more early but Martinez finished strong. I'll give it to Murray though. Sergio bleeding from back of his head now too.

*10-9 Murray, 84-86 Murray*

**Round 10:** Another Murray round. May have knocked Martinez down but it was ruled a slip.

*10-9 Murray, 93-96 Murray*

**Round 11:** Sergio looking more like his old self. Showing some life and a little more defense. Still a close round though. Sergio's left hand may be broken or injured.

*10-9 Martinez, 103-105 Murray*

**Round 12:** Relatively strong finish by Martinez.

*10-9 Martinez, 113-114 Murray*

Great fight could have gone either way. I'd like to see a draw.

**OFFICIAL RESULT:** Sergio by UD. I believe all 3 cards were 115-113.

I understand what it's like to be born under punches. I understand what it's like to have opportunity yanked from underneath you, to overcome tremendous odds, to have to — though sheer force of will — take what is yours even if by sheer luck.

Though wit and wile, I have come to support my family. I own a house and a car. I have investments. I have some semblance of security — enough that allows my wife to look after my daughter full time. These are not outstanding achievements, but a whole lot of people thought I'd have no future.

I understand what it's like to come from nothing: shivering in a garage with no heat on a Christmas day, spending it alone with no family, smiling because I at least had a harmonica to keep me entertained. In those days, there was no safety net. I had no answer should disaster have struck.

Thankfully, it never did. Oh, on several occasions I came close — but if I saw a single shred of hope, I'd seize it.

For this reason, boxing appeals to me. Boxing is hard work and dedication. You don't play it. You live it.

Boxing is an unquenchable desire, a thirst to succeed, a passion driven by a truth: that you must face fear, and you must face it alone.

Kessler now counters! Kessler knows he has Froch hurt! He moves foward and bangs Froch's body! Looks like a cut from Froch's left eye! Froch coming back with his own hard shots to Kessler's body! WHOA!

*10-9 Kessler, 106-103 Froch*

***Round 12:*** At the center of the ring, both exchange. Both are sending jabs. Both throwing everything and the kitchen sink! Kessler with some inside body shots! Right hand by Kessler! Froch with a left hook! Froch gets in with a left hook that staggers Kessler! Oh damn! Kessler with a left-right hook to Froch's head! These guys are going to war! Froch chasing after Kessler! Kessler is hurt — but still exchanging! What a final round!

*10-9 Froch, 116-112 Froch*

Also - why don't most official fight records include this in his record, making him 44-0?

1362526101.0,45,self.Boxing,19qm7q,"Cultural Shock: the difference between what boxing fans want to see, and what they SHOULD see",49,4,41,http://www.reddit.com/r/Boxing/comments/19qm7q/cultural_shock_the_difference_between_what_boxing/,"Last week was a great week for boxing. It truly had some great fights but unfortunately too many of them will remain obscure. 

In contrast, Russell-Gusev was the one fight everyone wanted to see but it ended up being one of the worst fights of the week. This isn't a slam against Russell. I rated that fight ★ ★ by virtue of Russell's skill and gritty determination over adversity. 

But let's face it. Russell-Gusev was nowhere near the best fight of the week. Hell, no fight broadcast on American television was close to being amongst the best fights. 

The best fights last week that I saw were the following:

* [Javier Garcia Roche vs Ivan Sanchez](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C8wLW_Q1WzI)
* [Carlos Cuadras vs. Victor Zaleta](http://www.dailymotion.com/video/xxx4ve_2013-03-02-carlos-cuadras-vs-victor-zaleta_sport#.UTVRues4WjE)
* [Donnie Nietes vs. Moises Fuentes](http://www.dailymotion.com/video/xxyd3o_2013-03-02-donnie-nietes-vs-moises-fuentes-abs-cbn_sport#.UTVSqus4WjE)

I love all three of these fights for differing reasons. 

Roche-Sanchez featured Sanchez getting knocked down twice in R2 only to work his ass off for a TKO5 victory. The fight was recorded at ringside with a handycam. It was a war between two Spanish domestics who'll be lucky if they'll ever reach continental title contention.

Cuadras-Zaleta was a showcase for Cuadras, one of the best damn Mexican prospects — but one who'll probably never make noise in America because he fights in a weight division Americans can't give a half-ass about. Unlike Russell-Gusev, however, Cuadras was very much fighting a live dog who came to fight. Zaleta was knocked down — hard! — by Cuadras and was saved from obliteration by a merciful ref.

As for Nietes-Fuentes? It was a war. Not a brawl, mind you. It was a war between too highly skilled practitioners of the sweet science with ebbs and flows as well as twists and turns. The result was a draw which was controversial but was by no means a robbery.

If I compare these three fights to Russell-Gusev, there's a big difference. While Russell-Gusev was watchable, Nietes-Fuentes (for example) was head-turning.

So... what's going on here? Two things:

1. **In America, most promoters are just not developing their prospects as they should.** What's the point of putting in great talents like Russell in with patsies for 20+ fights? For the most part, GBP isn't bothering with giving Russell adequate tests. Fans are therefore in the terrible situation of *knowing* that they're seeing someone special but having to suffer through shit fights.

2. **The best fights almost never have hype.** Pacquiao-Marquez IV was an oddity. It was a fight that actually lived up to the hype and perhaps surpassed it. The majority of great fights, however, happen with no fanfare, and often out of sight of most fight fans. To amend the words of Chuck D, it's not just that you *shouldn't* believe the hype, it's that you *should* believe the un-hype.

So how, in advance, is it possible to know which fights will possibly be good out of the hundreds that are booked every week? I previously wrote [The Beginner's Guide to Watching Good Fights](http://redd.it/mcm92) but let me simplify things further into this simple formula:

    Good records + Comparable ratings = Great fights

This isn't always true but it's often more true than not. 

""It sure looks like you have to do a lot of research to know what good fights are coming up,"" you might be thinking.

You are correct. But I have good news for you. You don't have to do any research because I've done it all for you. Every week, I post [fight previews](http://www.reddit.com/r/Boxing/comments/19p5lw/fight_previews_part_1_victor_manuel_cayo_vs/) of what I believe will be the best possible fights. Granted, I'm not psychic, but I often find that a *little* research allows me to unlock a world where fights are excellent every single week.

In closing, I just want to mention one more thing. There's a fight that happened last week that I *believe* eclipses everything else. Pungluang Sor Singyu vs. Paulus Ambunda happened in Namibia. I've only seen three rounds of that fight — but of those three rounds, it looks like it was an excellent fight. I hope to one day see it in its entirety because it looks that good.

But, like too many fights, it will probably never be seen by fight fans.",,False,,t5_2qj0l,1362526381.0,,,True,t3_19qm7q,http://www.reddit.com/r/Boxing/comments/19qm7q/cultural_shock_the_difference_between_what_boxing/,

1367358345.0,41,self.Boxing,1dftlh,"[META] Hey /r/Boxing, it's Mayweather fight week! Here's a few things you should know...",50,9,42,http://www.reddit.com/r/Boxing/comments/1dftlh/meta_hey_rboxing_its_mayweather_fight_week_heres/,"Hey everyone,

My past experience with Mayweather and Pacquiao fights has shown me what to expect from this subreddit. So for those of you who haven't been subscribed to /r/Boxing during superfight weeks, let me tell you what's in store. 

Lots of casual and even non-fans of boxing are going to make their way to this subreddit because a Mayweather fight is boxing's equivalent to a Superbowl event. Even for those who don't care about the fight itself, they still know a party's going on.

Without any adieu...

## Ground Rules

They're not much different from the way our rules typically are, but since some people sometimes miss reading the sidebar, let me reiterate them.

* Keep spoilers out of the titles of submissions for at least 24 hours after an event airs.
* When a submission is going to contain spoiler filled discussion inside please have some form of spoiler warning in the submission title. Exceptions are made for Official Fight Threads.
* Threads comparing boxing to MMA will immediately be removed.
* Do not request streams of fights.

As well, while these are not rules, they're general principles for getting the most out of /r/Boxing:

* Discuss whatever you want. Trash talk but keep it civil.
* Please adhere to [Reddiquette](http://en.reddit.com/wiki/reddiquette)
* Have fun, and don't take things too seriously

Remember the Golden Rule, don't be a dick, and remember that everyone here is looking to have a good time.

## If you're new to /r/Boxing
There's lots that happens here on a weekly basis that you might want to check out.

For instance, our fight threads ([here's an example](http://www.reddit.com/r/Boxing/comments/1d8r60/fight_thread_danny_garcia_vs_zab_judah_peter/)) offer a fact sheet, *cough*info on where to view*cough*, and live round-by-round coverage. The comment threads are fairly active. It's a regular party.

Beyond that, regular /r/Boxing posters are fairly knowledgeable. They submit lots of news, offer analysis, and often assist those who are new to the sport of boxing.

I'd like to think that, as far as boxing forums are concerned, we're *very* welcoming.

## If you're a longtime /r/Boxing subscriber

Remember that Mayweather/Pacquiao fight weeks are *always* different from other weeks here. As such, for one week, /r/Boxing is going to be a different place.

There will be many people who are unaware of how boxing works. Many visitors here may not know how to score a fight, or may see controversy where there is none. When this happens, take it as an opportunity to educate.

As well, superfight weeks almost always bring in people whose passions are strongly stirred. There will be haters and there will be defenders. There will also be trolls who arrive purely to enflame the haters and defenders ;)

Take it all in stride. If someone goes a little too far, use the Report button to notify me.

## Finally

I love superfight weeks. It's not because I love superfights, but it's because I always see them as an opportunity to bring more people into the cult of boxing fandom. Much as I sometimes criticize this sport, at the bottom of my heart, I believe boxing offers action that cannot be found elsewhere. 

Hopefully, a great fight breaks out on Saturday, because nothing is better than a good fight!",,False,,t5_2qj0l,False,,,True,t3_1dftlh,http://www.reddit.com/r/Boxing/comments/1dftlh/meta_hey_rboxing_its_mayweather_fight_week_heres/,moderator

## Jessie Vargas vs. Wale Omotoso
***Round 1:*** Fascinatingly, Omotoso looks to keep this on the outside. Both trade jabs. Then when Omotoso gives him leather, Vargas counterpunches him. Vargas then follows up with combos. Omotoso looks to now be biding his time waiting for an opening. Both trade punches at the center of the ring. Omotoso then moves Vargas to the ropes and sends a punch that momentarily wobble Vargas. Great round!

10-9 Omotoso

***Round 2:*** Good right hand by Omotoso gets in on Vargas! Vargas is trying to respond with volume, but they don't seem to be as purposeful! Oh damn! I spoke too soon! Vargas had a hook that really troubled Omotoso! OH GOD! THEY'RE TRADING! VARGAS IS DOWN FROM A BODY SHOT! HE GETS UP! Let's see how he responds! Right by Omotoso wobbles Vargas again! Both going toe-to-toe near the ropes! Wow!

10-8 Omotoso, 30-27 Omotoso

***Round 3:*** Both once again dancing at the center of the ring and trading shots. For a moment, both seem to be in a chess match. Omotoso tries with a stiff jab, then gets countered by Vargas. Vargas is backing up — clearly leery of going toe-to-toe again. Then he moves forward, gets troubled for his efforts. Omotoso sends in a right overhand that gets ""oohs"" from the audience! He the repeats with a hook that cuts up Vargas! I'm loving this fight!

10-9 Omotoso, 30-26 Omotoso

***Round 4:*** Omotoso continues to walk Vargas down. Vargas looks to be looking to counter, but he's sure taking punishment when he tries. Good right by Omotoso connects! Well, again I spoke too soon! Vargas is now countering the Omotoso right! He folllows up with jabs to the body! He's now replying with overhands — they barely connect but are hurting! Omotoso now going with the right! The go toe-to-toe! Hook by Vargas! Right by Omotoso! Bell rings!

10-9 Vargas, 39-36 Omotoso

***Round 5:*** Vargas isn't back up as much. He's circling around and going with the jab followed by the left hook. Omotoso then rushes Omotoso! They exchange! VARGAS STUNS OMOTOSO! OMOTOSO RESPONDS WITH A SHUFFLE! HE GOES WITH A HOOK! OMOTOSO ALMOST FALLS BUT IS STILL ON HIS FEET! OMOTOSO REPLYING! AT THE ROPES THEY BASH EACH OTHER! HOLY SHIT! WHAT A FUCKING ROUND!

10-9 Vargas, 48-46 Omotoso

***Round 6:*** These guys are beasts! They trading once again! This is a phone both war now! Things calm down and Vargas outjabs Omotoso. Omotoso tries rushing in, and gets countered by Vargas. Not a whole lot happening, but I'm still on the edge of my seat. Right hook by Omotoso just narrowly misses Vargas.

***Round 8:*** Both go to trading hard punches! Omotoso bullies Vargas to the ropes, but Vargas looks to be handling Omotoso just fine. Things calm down again. Both exchange shots. Good left hook then gets in and moves Vargas back! I think that stole the round for Omotoso!

10-9 Omotoso, 77-74 Omotoso

***Round 9:*** Omotoso tries with a hook, but gets countered with the right! Omotoso then lands and overhand right over Vargas jab! Vargas with two left hooks!

## Timothy Bradley vs. Ruslan Provodnikov
***Round 1:*** As predicted, Provodnikov comes forward. Bradley countering with the hook. Provodnikov looking to catch Bradley, but Bradley's head movement prevailing. Both now going toe-to-toe at the center of the ring! Provodnikov and Bradley look to be in a phone booth war! Bradley with uppercuts on the inside! Provodnikov with flurries to Bradley's head! Big right hand by Provodnikov!  Bradley is on the floor! Ref rules it a slip! Bradley is lucky that he made it out!

1361916981.0,40,self.Boxing,19ab0g,Puerto Rico vs Mexico; A Boxing Rivalry (Part 1) ,43,3,18,http://www.reddit.com/r/Boxing/comments/19ab0g/puerto_rico_vs_mexico_a_boxing_rivalry_part_1/,"**History**

The atmosphere is something special as two fighters walk into the ring followed by the support of their people, and every time each fighter lands a punch the crowd cheers at the incredible fight being displayed.

The two fighters trade blows, one moves around the other while the other continues to stalk down his opponent. And the crowd continues to cheer, suddenly the stalking fighter traps the moving boxer, and then, suddenly half crowd begins to chant;

*Mexico, Mexico, Mexico!*

The Mexican lands powerful blows against his opponents, and the other fighter on instinct fights back and then with a punch backs away the Mexican, the fighter maybe senses the Mexican is hurt as he launches forward, sending blow after blow.

Now the chanting crowd goes silent as the other half suddenly takes control of the arena as the chants of *Puerto Rico, Puerto Rico, Puerto Rico!* suddenly overwhelm the arena and the two fighters in them.

The Puerto Rican-Mexican Rivalry is an incredible rivalry, a rivalry that has led these two boxing nations to clash various of times, almost always resulting in an epic duel between two fighters and the support of their people. 

It was 1960, Carlos Ortiz was 30-2 and was the reigning Light Welterweight Champion and was set to face a Mexican Bull; Battling Torres. One first few notable boxer to come out of Mexico, Torres was quite puncher, 32-0, and it was set to be quite a match. 

But Torres was surprisingly outclassed by his Puerto Rican opponent before being knocked out in the tenth round. It was the first major bout between a Puerto Rican and Mexican Fighter. 


**Wilfredo Gomez and Salvador Sanchez**

The rivalry would officially begin to take shape more than a decade after that bout when another Puerto Rican Fighter simply was blowing away a the 122 division. 

In his prime he would be 32-0-1, all his wins would ended by knockout, the draw avenged, by knockout. The man was named Wilfredo Gomez, and he was the perfect fighter at 122. He had cleaned up the division, his victims included Mexican Fighters Tirado, Lopez and Medel. 

And for one of his notable bouts, Gomez was set to face a Mexican Legend; Carlos Zarate; 52-0, all but one of his wins ended by knockout. 

Zarate was easily sent to the canvas four times as he was defeated in the fifth round by his opponent. Though many had expected it, not many expected it to be in the way Gomez had done so as he outmaneuvered and out punched his opponent in excellent fashion.

But Gomez's win streak. Enter another Mexican Legend, Salvador Sanchez, 41-1. 

Gomez moved up in weight to face the Mexican Sanchez who interestingly enough was on a win streak against Puerto Ricans, beating tough Juan Laporte and Felix Trinidad Sr. 

Mexicans tuned in to the fight, remembering the defeat of Carlos Zarate, and Wilfredo Gomez, already a popular fighter in Puerto Rico drew thousands of Puerto Ricans to watch in the fight. 

The two Latin Americans rushed to the middle of the ring for the first, major epic battle between their nations.

And after eight, incredible rounds the Puerto Rican Gomez simply had no more to give as he fell to the canvas, losing for the first time in his career against the Mexican Salvador Sanchez.

The defeat of Gomez, and the victory of Sanchez set off the rivalry, a long, and epic rivalry that would soon heat up once more with the arrival of a an All-Time-Great.

Julio Cesar Chavez. 


**Top Five Mexicans and Puerto Rican Fighters of All Time**


**#5 Mexican Fighter**

Juan Manuel Marquez - A modern All Time Great who needs no introduction in today's boxing world. Winning seven World Titles in four different divisions. Having a record of 55-6, a true Mexican Great who simply keeps on giving. Victories over Marco Antonio Bandera, Joel Casamayor, Orlando Salido, and of course his epic rivalry and victory over Manny Pacquiao. His six losses come against tough opposition, including his pro debut, and later in his career which includes Floyd Mayweather, Chris John, Freddie Norwood and Manny Pacquiao. A master of the counter-punching technique; many actually consider Marquez the greatest Mexican Fighter of All Time.


**#5 Puerto Rican Fighter of All Time**


Juan Laporte- Mentioned in the first part of the history segment, Juan Laporte's career is filled with misfortune and tragedy. In the beginning of his career as he today is one of the most underrated fighter ever, his record itself deceiving which stands at 40-17. Starting his career not many analyst believed he would become a world champion, yet with grit and courage Laporte racked up enough wins to challenge Salvador Sanchez. Sanchez had 40 wins, while Laporte had only 15 wins, and one loss. Sanchez though was surprised, as the two fighters fought it out for 15 rounds, making the Mexican Legend work and won a handful of rounds though he ultimately lost.

He beat Rocky Lockridge and lost once more at his second World Title Shot, losing to legendary Eusebio Pedroza by controversial decision. 
After racking up more wins he fought for a vacant title against Mario Miranda, he was finally a World Champion at 45-5, though he would later lose it to Wilfredo Gomez. 

He kept fighting, losing and winning, mostly winning until he got a shot to face Julio Cesar Chavez, in a very close decision Chavez triumphed over Laporte, and many believed that Laporte actually deserved the decision. 

In 1989 his son died, Laporte buried his son along with a minor title of his; he would continue with a few fights in his career, but he was no longer the fighter he was when he fought against Chavez, Gomez, Sanchez or all the other greats he came so close to beating.

1371995023.0,38,self.Boxing,1gwoyw,Thoughts on Broner-Malignaggi,39,1,82,http://www.reddit.com/r/Boxing/comments/1gwoyw/thoughts_on_bronermalignaggi/,"I'm going to check in as a huge Malignaggi fan born in NJ, living in CT and hating everything about Broner as a person. I often score for work rate. I've scored my bouts for the past year or so. Even as a biased person, I had this fight scored 115-113 for Broner. It was incredibly close. You could have theoretically gone either way.
A few thoughts on last night’s fight:

1.)	Work rate and ring generalship are subtly different things. Malignaggi won rounds by workrate, but what made this fight difficult to score is that some people would say that workrate is negated when the other fighter is slowly, calmly stalking you. That's how I saw this fight - Paulie was patting and moving, while Broner was limiting his real estate to do so. It wasn't a black and white accomplishment, but what helped him foil Malignaggi's ideal plan and win the fight.

2.)	Yes, you have to take the title from the champion.  But you can only do that through giving that champion the benefit of the doubt in close rounds.  There is no fair way otherwise, I did that and still had Broner 115-113.

3.)	Malignaggi may have indeed presented a (I’m sure there are other ways) blueprint to beating Broner.  If he had more power, the body blows would have accumulated much more gradual damage.  In short, it’s pretty clear how open Broner is to getting hit to the body.  The fighter would need to be able to throw crisp punches, have a good chin, and get off fast.

4.)	Broner is asking the fans to choose who he fights next.
Let’s face the fact that Paulie’s true home is 140.  He got bigger over the course of his career, but could still likely make 140 if better habits were there between fights.  Look at him in the promo video for the fight against Cano for proof.  That’s one of the reasons why this fight was considered by many to be hand-picked (that and lack of power plus free Malignaggi promos).
Some might say – but wait a minute!  Broner skipped a weight class to win this fight.  Yes.  And he was still the bigger man in the ring.  I have no idea how he was managing to make weight before.  Boggles my mind.  In all fairness, he didn’t always.  The next opponent should be a big punching 147.

5.)	Malignaggi says he’s financially OK without having to fight again.  Did this fight leave too much of a bad taste in the mouth to retire now?  He hurt his hand yet again, and I have always compared Paulie to a lobster who lost a claw in battle yet fights behind just one, huge claw.  That left jab – who else can make an entire career with one hand?  Some fighters survive with it, but as one dimensional as that makes him, I love watching his style knowing that he is risking his life behind a punch most fighters use to establish distance and timing.  But who’s next if anyone?  Or has he become too bitter...

1360635945.0,36,self.Boxing,18cn8c,Who's going to be boxing's next breakout star? Perhaps some statistical analysis might shed light!,41,5,30,http://www.reddit.com/r/Boxing/comments/18cn8c/whos_going_to_be_boxings_next_breakout_star/,"Now that the Floyd Mayweather/Manny Pacquiao era of boxing is beginning to close, boxing fans often ask the question: who will be boxing’s next big star? 

I, too, wonder about this question, so I decided to do a statistical breakdown to see if I’m able to predict any star-making trends. To do this, I decided to take a look at three major sources: Nielsen Ratings, Google Trends, and social media. I attempted to be as exhaustive as possible while not neglecting the bird’s eye view.

I’d like to offer one additional caveat. Futurists have a saying: “He who looks through crystal ball shall later eat glass.” So though these statistics show a broader trend, anything can happen at any time to upset current trends.

### Nielsen Ratings

Let’s now look at the strongest metric for star-making: Nielsen Ratings. For this study, I decided to study only the A-sides of any fight that attracted more than 1 million viewers. According to [Yahoo Sports](http://sports.yahoo.com/blogs/boxing/boxing-cable-2012-lots-fights-lots-viewers-lots-210146022--box.html), here’s each broadcast that reached over 1 million views during 2012:

	1. Julio Cesar Chavez Jr.-Marco Antonio Rubio, Feb. 4, HBO, 1.9 million
	2. Bernard Hopkins-Chad Dawson, April 28, HBO, 1.6 million
	3. Chavez Jr.-Andy Lee, June 16, HBO, 1.4 million
	4. Adrien Broner-Vicente Escobedo, July 21, HBO, 1.4 million
	5. Miguel Cotto-Austin Trout, Dec. 1, Showtime, 1.4 million
	6. Nonito Donaire-Jorge Arce, Dec. 15, HBO, 1.3 million
	7. Andre Ward-Chad Dawson, Sept. 8, HBO, 1.3 million
	8. Floyd Mayweather-Cotto PPV replay, May 12, HBO, 1.3 million
	9. Manny Pacquiao-Juan Manuel Marquez PPV replay, Dec. 15, HBO, 1.3 million
	10. Danny Garcia-Amir Khan, July 14, HBO, 1.3 million
	11. Erik Morales-Garcia I, March 24, HBO, 1.2 million
	12. Robert Guerrero-Andre Berto, Nov. 24, HBO, 1.1 million
	13. Marcos Maidana-Devon Alexander, Feb. 25, HBO, 1.1 million
	14. Broner-Antonio Demarco, Nov. 17, HBO, 1.1 million
	15. Sergio Martinez-Matthew Macklin, March 17, HBO, 1.1 million
	16. Canelo Alvarez-Josesito Lopez, Sept. 15, Showtime, 1.0 million

We can safely surmise that Hopkins, Martinez, and Cotto are not boxing’s future. As well, Manny Pacquiao and Floyd Mayweather Jr. are already stars. 

Moreover, I decided to eliminate the following fighters from study for the following reasons:

* Julio Cesar Chavez Jr. - faced a loss to Sergio Martinez. It is doubtful whether his career momentum can be sustained.
* Danny Garcia - faced a fighter (Amir Khan) with greater name value than himself. It would be better to assess a fight in which he is the definitive A-side.
* Marcos Maidana - he’s got a cult following, but clearly lost to Devon Alexander. It is unlikely he’ll ever become an A-side on HBO ever again.

I have therefore distilled these fighters as ones who are “the future” while also attracting more than 1 million viewers:

1. Adrien Broner
2. Nonito Donaire
3. Andre Ward
4. Robert Guerrero
5. Canelo Alvarez

Some important notes to consider:

*	On this list, only Adrien Broner appears twice
*	Nonito Donaire was on HBO four times, but finally cracked 1 million viewers *after* Pacquiao-Marquez IV
*	Ward-Dawson was Andre Ward’s first fight on HBO as an A-lister — having spent the bulk of his career on Showtime
*	Alvarez-Lopez was shown during the exact same night as the Chavez-Martinez PPV

So that settles it, right? Broner is the future of boxing — being the only one to pull in 1 million viewers. Not so fast. There’s more things to consider.

### Google Trends

Next, I decided to look at [Google Trends](http://www.google.com/trends/explore#q=nonito%20donaire%2C%20robert%20guerrero%2C%20adrien%20broner%2C%20andre%20ward%2C%20canelo%20alvarez&amp;date=1%2F2010%2037m&amp;cmpt=q) to see what else might be going on. According to Google, interest is as follows:

| Name | Average Volume |
|:-----------|------------:|
| Canelo Alvarez | 10 |
| Nonito Donaire | 5 |
| Andre Ward | 3 |
| Adrien Broner | 3 |
| Robert Guerrero | 2 |

Now for peak volume:

| Name | Peak Volume | Date |
|:-----------|------------:|:------------:|
| Canelo Alvarez | 100 | September 2012 |
| Nonito Donaire | 56 | December 2012 |
| Andre Ward | 39 | September 2012 | 
| Adrien Broner | 29 | July 2012 |
| Robert Guerrero | 16 | July 2012 |

To summarize Google Trends, Canelo has far more volume than anyone else, with twice as much volume as Nonito Donaire, his closest competitor. Ward and Broner have identical volumes, but Ward’s volume is due to a larger peak date than Broner’s. As for Guerrero, why did July find more volume than November?

To answer this question, we need to look at each fighter’s regional interest.

## Canelo Alvarez - Regional Interest

	1.	Mexico - 100
	2.	United States - 30
	3.	Argentina - 11
	4.	Spain - 4
	5.	United Kingsom - 3

As we can see here, Alvarez’ appeal in Mexico far outweighs his appeal in the United States — although there is genuine crossover interest in the United States as well.

## Nonito Donaire - Regional Interest

	1.	Philippines - 100
	2.	Mexico - 19
	3.	Saudi Arabia - 6
	4.	Spain - 5
	5.	United States - 5

Popularity in the Philippines is expected. After all, Donaire is Filipino so that’s where the bulk of his fanbase would be. But why Saudi Arabia? The answer is that Saudi Arabia has a sizable amount of Filipino migrant workers. 

The other surprising point of interest here is that Mexico has far more interest in Donaire than the United States. I suspect that this has to do with Donaire’s wins over Fernando Montiel and Jorge Arce — both fighters who are hugely popular in Mexico. In addition, the United States rarely has interest in fighters below 135lbs.

## Andre Ward - Regional Interest

	1.	United Kingdom - 100
	2.	Romania - 97
	3.	United States - 77
	4.	Canada - 48

Amusingly, Ward has far more regional interest in Europe than the United States. Why is this? 

For the United Kingdom, it has to do with Carl Froch — a rival to Andre Ward who has grown in popularity. Ward-Froch was the final fight in the Super Six tournament. Indeed, Froch’s P4P status amongst many is due to how well he did against Ward (though he lost).

As for interest in Romania and Canada, this is due to Lucian Bute, a Romanian super middleweight who fights out of Montreal. It was once thought that Bute would fight Ward, but this hope was dashed after his decimation by Froch.

Ward did not have much appeal in the United States, but after his domination of lineal light heavyweight champion Chad Dawson, this might change soon.

## Adrien Broner - Regional Interest

	1.	United States - 100
	2.	United Kingdom - 75
	3.	Canada - 35

Surprisingly, Broner is not really popular outside the anglosphere. It’s obvious why so many Americans and Canadians like Broner: he reminds them of Floyd Mayweather Jr.

But why the interest in the United Kingdom? The answer is that there’s been much hype of an eventual showdown against Scotsman Ricky Burns who’s often considered Broner’s equal in the lightweight division.

## Robert Guerrero - Regional Interest

	1.	Turkey - 100
	2.	Mexico - 55
	3.	United States - 54
	4.	United Kingdom - 34

The reason for Turkey’s high interest is simple. In July 2012, he fought Selcuk Aydin — who is Turkey’s biggest boxing draw. 

As for Mexico, I’m assuming it’s due to Guerrero’s Mexican-American background. But I’m not entirely sure.

### Social Media

I’m now going to cast my eye towards three social media sources: Twitter, Facebook, and YouTube. 

Twitter is particularly useful because much of the data is public, and I’m able to use [3rd party tools](http://ow.ly/d/13lX) to better assess what’s going on. First, I’m going to look at the most simple metric of all: follower count.


| Name | Follower Count |
|:-----------|------------:|
| Guerrero | 162,690 |
| Canelo | 161,799 |
| Ward | 152,252 |
| Donaire | 84,924 |
| Broner | 67,777 |

Right here, it looks like Guerrero is the most popular fighter on Twitter, followed by Canelo. However, it is easy to monkey around with Twitter follower counts. If you have the money, you can buy them. 

Follower count should therefore be balanced with keyword comparison as well as mentions count. Here’s the drilldown of each fighter by keyword and mentions during the past few weeks.

| Keyword | Hits |
|:-----------|------------:|
| “nonito donaire” | 33% (1,657) |
| “adrien broner” | 25.2% (1,262) |
| “robert guerrero” | 23.6% (1,185) |
| “canelo alvarez” | 12.3% (618) |
| “andre ward” | 5.9% (294) |


| Twitter Handle | Mentions |
|:-----------|------------:|
| @filipinoflash | 33.3% (2,098) |
| @adrienbroner | 25.5% (1,609) |
| @canelooficial | 18.1% (1,137) |
| @ghostboxing | 12.1% (764) |
| @andreward | 11% (691) |

(If you’re curious why I only have data for the past few weeks, it’s due to Twitter only caching their data for a two week period. To gauge interest for longer, I would have to use some archiving tools — which are not retroactive.)

What’s interesting here is that though Donaire and Broner have far less followers than Guerrero, Canelo, and Ward, they have far more keyword and mentions counts. In fact, for both Donaire and Broner, the numbers are consistent: 33% and 25% of keyword hits and Twitter handle mentions.

The next thing to look at is Facebook Page likes. I like to compare Facebook to Twitter due to the userbase of Facebook being more casual than Twitter’s. Fans on Facebook are different from fans on Twitter.

| Name | Facebook Likes |
|:-----------|------------:|
| Canelo | 310,105 |
| Donaire | 154,736 |
| Ward | 24,403 |
| Broner | 5,067 |
| Guerrero | 4,754 |

As you can see, Canelo and Donaire have far more Facebook fans than Twitter followers. Ward, Broner, and Guerrero’s likes are far lower than their Twitter follower count.

It’s easy to see why Broner has a lower follower count on Facebook. He’s more active on Twitter, and he heavily encourages his fans to follow him there. His Facebook Page, meanwhile, is a ghost town.

Finally, let’s take a look at YouTube. The great thing about YouTube is that most of the content is user-generated. Moreover, since boxing is a very *visual* experience, one of the most visual social media sites should therefore be assessed.

| YouTube Keyword | # of Results | View Count of Most Popular Video | 
|:-----------|------------:|:------------:|
| “nonito donaire” | 6,550 | 1,149,025 |
| “andre ward” | 4,640 | 210,744 |
| “canelo alvarez” | 4,510 | 829,055 |
| “adrien broner” | 2,290 |  308,650 |
| “robert guerrero” | 1,720 | 226,745 |

Nonito Donaire not only has the most videos uploaded of him, he also has the video with the highest view count. Meanwhile, Andre Ward has the second largest number of results, but his most popular video only has 210,744 views — which has the smallest view count. 

Canelo, whose most popular video has 829,055, is in 3rd place by number of results.

### Bird’s Eye View of Trends

What should we make of all of this? It’s clear that though Adrien Broner has brought in the highest ratings during 2012, the two fighters with the most star appeal are Canelo Alvarez and Nonito Donaire. It is no coincidence that both their regional interest of appeal is *outside* the United States in countries which there is no HBO presence (at least officially).

It’s also my personal belief that Canelo has more casual appeal while Donaire has more hardcore appeal. I deduce Canelo’s casual appeal by Twitter follower and Facebook likes count, while I can decipher Donaire’s hardcore appeal by Twitter mentions as well as YouTube video uploads.

So what to make of Broner? There is no doubt that he has appeal amongst Americans. As well, he has a passionate and vocal fan base. However, it is questionable that he will  have the global appeal of Canelo and Donaire.",,False,,t5_2qj0l,1360880690.0,,,True,t3_18cn8c,http://www.reddit.com/r/Boxing/comments/18cn8c/whos_going_to_be_boxings_next_breakout_star/,

1368385148.0,38,self.Boxing,1e734e,Hi Boxing fan in China here I was reading comments regarding Macau and why Manny's boxing there... I think there's a lot of misconceptions on this place.,45,7,41,http://www.reddit.com/r/Boxing/comments/1e734e/hi_boxing_fan_in_china_here_i_was_reading/,"Boxing is a growing sport in China. But it has a long ways to go. However promoting a huge fight in Macau is definitely the way to go. 

I'm reading a lot of comments on how bad Macau is, and how it's not as good as Vegas. I also read some comments on how they should host events at MBS in Singapore instead. I believe someone even said ""the big money spenders go to Singapore"". Having been to both places I must say Macau blows MBS out of the water. [As of Dec 2012 Marina Bay Sands is the least profitable LV Sands Casino operating](http://exposingsingapore.wordpress.com/2012/12/02/singapores-marina-bay-sands-worst-performing-las-vegas-sands-gambling-site/)

I must disagree and say all these statements are in accurate and based off of some older stereotypes. A simple google search will reveal that Macau in 2008 or so started generating as much revenue as Vegas. And fast forward to 2012 Macau now generates 5 times the revenue as Las Vegas. All the wealthiest people in China go to Macau.

If Las Vegas is Sin City. Macau is the Devil's playground for the rich and elite. You can do things there that you would never get away with in Singapore (wanna orgy in a hot tub with 100 hookers from all over the world? Go to Macau). You see many of the wealthy (who are connected to the government which also happen to be the biggest spenders) choose to go Macau because they simply can't be caught splurging their money overseas.

[TL;DR](http://www.businessinsider.com/these-casinos-in-macau-make-las-vegas-look-like-a-dump-2012-7?op=1) 

Edit: If you're not into gambling then Macau is kinda lame. I'd rather go to Vegas and enjoy the nightlife/shows. Macau is purely made for gambling/prostitutes and honestly not much else. Hong Kong is only a boat ride away though.

1365993001.0,35,self.Boxing,1cd4rz,On Purists and Blood-thirsty Ghouls,42,7,32,http://www.reddit.com/r/Boxing/comments/1cd4rz/on_purists_and_bloodthirsty_ghouls/,"Donaire-Rigondeaux has generated a lot of discussion here on /r/boxing. 

In fact, we haven't seen activity like this since Pacquiao-Marquez IV. At the crux of this discussion is a debate: was Donaire-Rigondeaux a good fight?

There seems to be two factions regarding the ""goodness"" of Donaire-Rigondeaux: purists and blood-thirsty ghouls. To the purist, boxing is about ring I.Q., technique, and execution. To the blood-thirsty ghoul, boxing is about the action, the viciousness, the wars.

Purists think blood-thirsty ghouls don't know what they're seeing. Blood-thirsty ghouls think purists are full of elitist crap.

Frankly, I think this is a good discussion to have because it allows others to gain perspective. What exactly makes for a great fight? What counts for ""good"" boxing?

### The Sweet Science: The Purist's Perspective

""Boxing is like jazz. The better it is, the less people appreciate it."" ~George Forman

And if good boxing is like jazz, Guillermo Rigondeaux is like [Sun Ra](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sun_ra). The purist looks for artistry and innovation in boxing. He looks for creative ways in which to ""hit and not get hit"". 

It's not just about punches — it's about what happens between punches. The purist looks for ring generalship, footwork, feinting, and precision. 

Purists love watching fighters like Floyd Mayweather Jr., Pernell Whitaker, and Muhammad Ali because they display *craftsmanship*. Though boxing is a violent sport, to the purist, it is artful violence. 

### The Cruelest Sport: The Blood-Thirsty Ghoul's Perspective

""Boxing is just show business with blood."" ~Frank Bruno

Supposedly, the blood-thirsty ghoul just cares about the violence but I believe this is the furthest thing from the truth. There's blood, but the blood in boxing is not enough. 

Boxing is about so much more than technique. It is a metaphor for life: both men entering the ring, facing fear — and doing so alone. Nothing is determined. The round goes on. Within those three minutes of hell, there's jabs, missed punches — and Hail Mary haymakers capable of snuffing out consciousness.

The blood-thirsty ghoul loves the war because it tests each fighter's character. He is thirsty for blood not because of morbid curiosity, but because blood is an honest and true thing.

### The Irony

The irony, of course, is that the promise of a ""pure"" boxing match often attracts more onlookers than an all-out war.

Two weeks ago, Rios-Alvarado II could not sell out the MGM Grand — despite a guaranteed Fight Of The Year candidate about to take place. Barely 4,500 people showed up to watch blood being spilled. And as much as people here discussed the fight, it barely made a dent in the media.

Contrast this with Donaire-Rigondeaux. Radio City Music Hall was sold out — filled to capacity. The fight was a top trend on Twitter. As much as journalists — and some posters here — complained about the fight being ""boring"", it was one of the few fights that had its highlights broadcast in mainstream media.

The further irony is that as much ""purists"" seem to be the only ones interested in seeing a ""pure"" boxing match, a whole lot of others seem to want to see one too — even if they boo. Likewise, the blood-thirsty ghouls *seem* to speak for the common fan, but when an all out war is about to happen, it seems they're the only ones excited enough to buy tickets.

The purists aren't so elite. The blood-thirsty ghouls seem to be the only ones who know what they're seeing.",,False,,t5_2qj0l,1365994168.0,,,True,t3_1cd4rz,http://www.reddit.com/r/Boxing/comments/1cd4rz/on_purists_and_bloodthirsty_ghouls/,

This allegory explains everything.",45,10,26,http://www.reddit.com/r/Boxing/comments/180rr3/what_exactly_is_going_on_with_mayweather/,"Many of you are probably wondering, “What the hell is going on with Mayweather?”

To answer this question, I’m going to tell you an allegory with the full acknowledgement that the business of boxing contains many elements with differing concerns. For benefit of simplicity, I’m going to keep this whole thing devoted to sanctioning bodies and their relationships with fighters. 

Picture the sport of boxing to be a high school in a Middle American suburb with each major sanctioning body as somebody notable on campus. 

* WBC — The celebrated quarterback who drives around in a yellow convertible Camaro blasting Pitball songs. He often hooks up with members of the cheerleader squad while all the while having a not-so-secret penchant for hot Latinas.
* WBA — The college boy hanging around at all the hot parties who everybody thinks is cool but is really just there to bang as many semi-attractive high school chicks as possible — and keeps lowering his standards.
* IBF — The hipster who rides around on a fixie, listens to vinyl records while sipping microbrews, and hopes to God he’ll meet a magic manic pixie girl who will help him escape his boring life. Someday, they will escape to New York City together.
* WBO — The new kid who just immigrated from Puerto Rico. He just wants to be liked by *any* somewhat attractive girl, so keeps a stockpile of sparkly jewelry around just in case.

Mayweather is the buxom lead cheerleader who is “officially” an item with the WBC but who everyone knows has fooled around with the WBA. That’s all cool with the WBC, though, since Mayweather’s pretty bitchin’ and everyone else is jealous.

However, the prom is coming up and rather than doing the expected thing by showing up with the WBC, wouldn’t it be cool if everyone was thrown for a loop? What if Mayweather went with... the IBF?!

What Mayweather may not know is that the IBF is *totally* not up for it.

The IBF wants someone he can share mix CDs with. The IBF wants someone he can twirl around in the rain at midnight with. The IBF wants someone who can help him understand what it’s truly like to be *in the moment*.

The IBF wants... Kell Brook.

Complicating all of this is that the IBF is currently going out with the gawky, *hideously* unfashionable Devon Alexander. But the IBF is *only* going out with Alexander because Alexander is in the high school drama club with Kell Brook. *Maybe* if he picks up Alexander after class, he *might* be introduced to Brook.

Unbeknown to the IBF, though, is that Alexander has aspirations of becoming one of the popular kids — and will *totally* let Mayweather have the IBF as prom date if it means being liked.

What exactly will happen at the prom? I guess we’ll just have to wait and see.",,False,,t5_2qj0l,1360188359.0,,,True,t3_180rr3,http://www.reddit.com/r/Boxing/comments/180rr3/what_exactly_is_going_on_with_mayweather/,

1343157968.0,33,self.Boxing,x376s,r/Boxing's Official Heavyweight Rankings,37,4,11,http://www.reddit.com/r/Boxing/comments/x376s/rboxings_official_heavyweight_rankings/,"Here are the official rankings for **r/Boxing's Heavyweight** (combined Heavy + Cruiser) **Division**.

We will use these rankings as a starting point.  In the future, when updating rankings, any updates will be based upon this initial ranking order.  I've yet to decide how often to update the rankings. I'll likely do the first round of updates after we get all 10 divisions settled.  Ranking updates will be discussed and reviewed openly, although official decisions may or may not be left up entirely to group vote.  

Without further ado:

**r/Boxing's Heavyweight Division:**

**CHAMPION: Wladimir Klitschko 58 - 3 (51 KO's)**: Our champion, through a combination of longevity and dominance earned the vacant crown the only way he knows how--by beating every man (not related to him) in his way.  While many of us may think that Vitali would put the little brother in his place, none of us can deny the absolute stranglehold with which Wladimir holds the division.  From Chagaev to Haye, every possible challenger willing to step up has been either devastatingly or embarassingly turned away.  Having notched his 15th defense without breaking a sweat, Little Brother Klitschko is walking down the same path as Joe Louis and Larry Holmes.

1. **Vitali Klitschko 44 - 2 (40 KO's)**: If lineal championships were as fractured as the sanctioning bodies would like you to believe, then Vitali would  be sharing a seat at the top with his brother.  However, historian's fortune is Vitali's bane, as the elder Klitschko settles for 1st runner-up.  That's not as bad as it sounds.  The Klitschko's thirst for belt dominance has been quenched, and as Vitali nears retirement, he'll have quite a healthy career to look back on.  With one of the highest KO percentages in heavyweight boxing, Vitali's resume is supplemented by the fact that his only two losses were freak results that shortened fights he was winning.  That's something our #2 man would like to change...

2. **David Haye 26 - 2 (24 KO's)**: For once, David Haye walked the walk in walking down and stopping the durable and rugged Derek Chisora.  While many (myself included) are not yet ready to forgive his horrible showing against Wladimir Klitschko, a highlight reel KO goes a long way towards making amends and preparing us to accept a showdown against Vitali.  Considering Chisora's relative success against the giant, one has to give Haye a bit of credit as a ""live underdog"" in that potential bout.

3. **Alexander Povetkin 24 - 0 (16 KO's)**: As a heavyweight beltholder with Olympic Gold pedigree, Alexander Povetkin was tabbed as many to be the next champion after the Klitschkos.  After a prospect phase comparable to Julio Cesar Chavez, Jr.'s in length, Povetkin nabbed an ""interim"" title beneath our Champion and has avoided Wladimir ever since. But, while his skills don't necessarily negate his stature when compared to a Klitschko, Povetkin does the next best thing.  He beats almost everyone else.

4. **Tomasz Adamek 46 - 2 (28 KO's)**:  The former champion will probably never make it to the top of these rankings, and one has to wonder if he even cares anymore.  With a second home in New Jersey, and a rabid fan base willing to sell out his venues, Tomasz Adamek uses his relative hand speed, (mostly) granite chin, and respectable power to keep himself in perennial contention.  His performance was a bit flat against Chambers, but despite Chambers' injury, Adamek did his job in securing another victory and another step towards a title shot.

5. **Yoan Pablo Hernandez 26 - 1 (13 KO's)**:  If you don't recognize this name, you'd be forgiven.  Yoan Pablo Hernandez spent the most recent years surfing near the bottom of the division's rankings until surging this year with repeat defeats of top contender Steve Cunningham.  When the first fight ended in controversy, the Cuban expat sealed the deal with a solid thumping of Cunningham in the rematch, earning some belts along the way. But his reign might be short lived, as his follow-up defense comes against the skilled ex-Contender Winner, Troy Ross.

6. **Marco Huck 34 - 2 (25 KO's)**:  He talks a lot of trash, but you can't help but kind of believe it.  Marco Huck, through a previous loss and narrow victories, seemed destined for the B-tier until he stepped up to the plate against Alexander Povetkin.  In a gutsy, dogged performance, Huck controversially lost to the favored Povetkin.  Since then, he's talked a lot about his desire to fight Vitali, but his sights might be better aimed at a smaller, less potent opponent, if not Povetkin again. 

7. **Cristobal Arreola 35 - 2 (30 KO's)**: Let's get this out of the way.  Arreola is fat. He's always going to be fat. But he's also always going to be entertaining.  He fights like light heavyweight, throws combinations like a welterweight, but definitely hits like a heavyweight, as his KO percentage suggests.  

8. **Denis Lebedev 24 - 1 (18 KO's)**: After a strong showing in his split-decision loss to Marco Huck, Lebedev has looked as good as a prospect can in trouncing faded legends and future journeymen.  Surprise, surprise, he knocked out Roy Jones, Jr. and outworked James Toney.  But that doesn't mean he's not worth watching.  He likes to fight, and he packs enough of a punch to make things interesting.

9. **Robert Helenius 17 - 0 (11 KO's)**: While many fighters could be here in the place of Helenius, it might be easier to swallow his position in these rankings if you simply recall [this](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hF1-RsxElk). Nice KO's aside, Sam Peter, Lamon Brewster, and Sergei Liakhovich make for decent scalps on this growing prospect's resume.

10. **Eddie Chambers 36 -3 (18 KO's)**: Eddie Chambers is highly skilled but low-powered.  He wins fights with speed and footwork. Despite his physique, he shows up in shape and can put on a clinic against lower-tier opponents and prospects, like he did against former Klitschko-in-training Alexander Dimitrenko.  But does he have heart? Well, in his last fight, he injured his left arm, losing his jab, and fought competitively against Adamek for 12 rounds using only 1 arm.  Guts.   **NOTE**: Eddie Chambers and Krzysztof Wlodarczyk received the same amount of points, but Eddie Chambers received more votes, thus narrowly earning the position.

For instance, who other than a boxing fan knows who Timothy Bradley (maybe as the guy who robbed Pacquiao but that is all (even though he has nothing to do with judging...) is, Erislandy Lara, Delvin Rodriguez, Austin Trout, Abner Mares, Leo Santa Cruz, Nonito Donaire... ect. Shit who knows who Andre Ward is or GGG. Who knows who Juan Manuel Marquez is (maybe people know him as the guy Pacquiao always fights), but do they appreciate his skill?

Now with that out of the way, it seems like boxing fans know who all these wonderful fighters are. What the fuck is a casual fan? It seems like this term would be described as ""someone who watches Mayweather and Pacquiao PPV fights."" AKA the annual biggest money making boxing events.

My point is this, WE know who these fighters are, a casual fan may watch boxing if they see it on TV. It's not casual fans who watch these fights, it's boxing fans... In my opinion, its the PROMOTERS job to PROMOTE their fighters. Will every boxer be a star like Mayweather, Pacquiao or Canelo (If you have red hair and box maybe), no, not likely but there is NO reason Rigondeaux doesn't deserve air play... the guy just SHITTED on Donaire. Straight befuddled his ass. Mind you I'm a huge Donaire fan, I was PISSED watching that fight as a Donaire fan.

1. Donaire is better than that performance (Me and my Girlfriend were yelling at our computer monitor...)

2. Yes Rigo danced a lot and didn't initiate action but he's a counter puncher/boxer.. STYLES make fights. Donaire respected him too much to take a risk and catch him... thats not Rigo's fault. You have a elite boxing technician counterpuncher versus and elite boxing technician counterpuncher (who adapted his style to make KO's). But he's fighting a world class A+++ technical guru sooooo that adaptation may not work aaaaaand as we saw, didn't.


3. Rigo turned up the heat later on, yeah he maybe could of finished him, Nonito was blind in one eye but cmon... We've seen Mayweather decimate people and in the last 20 seconds of the 12th start dancing around with his fist in the air.


4. This is Rigo's first ""co-headliner"" I say this because Nonito was the main attraction. Ward has shitty ratings and he's just as classy of a boxer. 


Moral of the story is I think it's bullshit. He wasn't given another fight to adjust his style to ""enterain"" the ""casual"" fans. The dude left his family behind in Cuba to seek out his dream of being a professional figther... won a billion gold medals, how is there no story to sell here...? FUCKING ELIAN GONZALES RIDING DOLPHINS was plastered all over the media... They could make a boxing special and throw it on HBO, a mini documentary about Rigo's life in COMMUNIST CASTRO RUN CUBA... How the fuck is none of this interesting?! It's fucking bullshit. (They do this shit for Mayweather and Pacquiao even when they were already stars... yeah I know they did something like this for Rigo but do more... throw it up on a news show or maybe be Showtime and have better network deals... lol)

It's like Andre Ward, when he was a child the dude's father just out of the blue has a heart attack and dies after dropping him off at practice, he then goes on to win a gold medal and the super six, P4P #2 only under Mayweather (WHICH you could argue however Mayweather has more ""Stripes"" than him). Why the fuck isn't he more popular. Majority of America is Christian, he's a devout Christian... all around good person. You know how many children don't have fathers and could be influenced by Andre Ward...? The dude could be a beacon of hope and inspiration... Shit's rediculous, he grew up in OAKLAND, not a pretty city and is now the 2nd best fighter in the world... No story there.. nah. People LOVE Pacquiao, he's a sweet heart in the public's image, despite the adultery, cock fights, and gambling...


Anyway fuck this bullshit, Promoters can and should promote fighters better, if HBO promoted their boxers half as much as they promoted their shitty TV shows they'd have better ratings for fighters...

Pros: This stance almost leaves no room for the straight right to hit you. And almost all jabs and uppercuts are useless because they can be easily dodged. The stance also allows for the fighter to easily lean back to avoid a flurry. 

Cons: Only VERY FAST fighters can use it properly. A power puncher almost has no chance using it. The stance opens a possibility of hitting the body/kidney of the side facing the boxer.

*""I'm ready for Trout. I'm ready to not let my fans down. I'm ready to win.""* ~Canelo Alvarez

***
As Canelo-Trout gets closer, the story behind this fight gets more interesting. 

Some fans believe a fight should be judged by what happens inside the ring, but I believe that no fight happens in a vacuum. There are always events outside the ring that makes what happens inside it *more* interesting. No matter what happens in the ring — whether there's fireworks or not — what's already transpired outside makes this a must see fight.

***
I like Austin Trout. He's one of the few elite boxers who knows where he comes from. He appreciates the fans. On Twitter, he often shoots the shit. He's sometimes up for Call of Duty on Xbox Live with a few of his social media followers.

Though he's fighting in front of a crowd of 38,000 people at the Alamodome, he knows that if he loses this fight, it's back to fighting in front of smokey community halls of a few hundred people. In boxing, you're only as good as your last win. Even though he has a 26(14)-0 record, if he were to lose on Saturday, everything he's fought for could evaporate. 

In this, he's not so different from other fighters with blown-up records, but I can tell you this: Trout doesn't have a blown up record. He's worked damn hard to keep his ""0"". In numerous situations, he was supposed to be the opponent, but Trout pulled out the win — often in front of hostile crowds.

Trout still struggles for attention. 

Being a slick African-American from New Mexico who refuses to talk trash, the mainstream media just doesn't feel compelled to write about him. There's no scandal with Trout. He'd rather renovate his house and take care of his children than show up at a strip joint and blow thousands of dollars in a single night. 

Hence, some people believe there's no story with Trout — but like many compelling stories, there is one if you know where to look.

***
As I said, Trout had to earn his wins. The toughest fight of Trout's career happened on September 5, 2009, in Panama against Nilson Julio Tapia. 16,000 fans were packed into the Roberto Duran Arena. 

Who was in Tapia's corner? Roberto Duran.

""He's an American,"" said Duran to Tapia between rounds, ""He's got bitch in him.""

But Trout was no bitch. Dispensing with his usual slick counterpunching style, Trout turned aggressor. Tapia found *himself* in the position of having to box, but when he felt Trout's left hand, he had difficulty answering Trout's aggression.

The weird thing about that fight was that it was only for 11 rounds, and the WBA allowed 1/2 point scoring system. It was supposed to discourage draws, but one judge scored it 105-105. It ended up being a majority decision win for Trout.

***
A year and a half later, Trout found himself in hostile territory once again. This time he was facing Rigoberto Alvarez in Mexico for the WBA title. Many believed that though Alvarez didn't have as much talent as his older brother Canelo, he should have had enough talent to beat Trout.

And why wouldn't he? Trout was inactive for 15 months. Alvarez, meanwhile, had just come off a win against Nobuhiro Ishida who had been on a 12 fight unbeaten streak and hadn't lost a fight in 6 years. If Alvarez beat Ishida, Trout should have been beatable too.

But Trout put on a boxing clinic. At first he used his jab to keep Alvarez off balance, but as the fight progressed, Trout used a vast arsenal to impress his will. With rapid activity, Trout nailed Alvarez with left-right combos to Alvarez' head and body.

The crowd was stunned. Trout won the fight. Sitting in the audience was Rigoberto's brother and Austin's future opponent: Canelo Alvarez.

***
Last December, Trout was supposed to lose again, but this time on one of the biggest stages in boxing — Madison Square Garden. Miguel Cotto wanted a belt and Trout had one. After fighting a competitive match with Floyd Mayweather Jr., this was supposed to be an easy win.

Trout turned the tables on the largely Puerto Rican crowd that night. As Cotto tried to stalk Trout, Trout used his jab and slick defensive skills to maximum effect. Cotto tried to outbully Trout, but Trout would not be bullied. Each time Cotto tried to take the fight to the ropes, Trout would outmuscle and outhustle him. The result was a unanimous decision win for Trout.

The win was so definitive, the entire arena went quiet. As everyone took it in, you could hear women and children crying. Shocked and dismayed, Cotto left the ring without giving reporters an interview.

***
Meanwhile, Canelo began capturing the imagination of Mexicans. With his unique look and exciting style, Canelo was drawing millions of TV views whenever he fought. Even before 2010, Alvarez drew well over 60 million Mexican TV viewers. He looked like the future of Mexican boxing — and indeed he still does.

But it wasn't until his KO of Carlos Baldomir that Canelo began receiving notice in the USA. At that point, Baldomir was 39-years-old and was clearly slowing down, but seeing how Baldomir was a name Americans were familiar with, they sat up and took notice.

The Baldomir fight, unfortunately, gave Canelo the reptuation of fighting prominent names past their expiry date to build up his resume. In a way, this is unfair to Canelo since he's only 22-years-old, but facing the likes of Kermit Cintron and Shane Mosley didn't do him any favours either.

Nonetheless, Canelo found himself with the WBC belt and rated highly by esteemed boxing publications like RING Magazine.

***
A large part of Canelo's appeal wrests on his good looks and wholesome personality. He has the same appeal in Mexico as Oscar De La Hoya has in America — but with a style that appeals to Mexicans. This wholesome persona began to crumble with an alleged altercation outside the ring.

It was October 2011, In Guadalajara, Mexico, IBF light flyweight titlist Jorge Solis was going for a run when he claimed to have encountered Canelo. Canelo, angry with Solis' involvement with one of his ex-girlfriends, punched Solis — hard! Solis broke his jaw, lost a few teeth, and had to get surgery.

Because of this, Solis was out of commission. His inactivity led to the IBF stripping Solis of his title. Solis, as a result, lost out on a lot of potential opportunities.

Solis filed charges against Canelo. Canelo, for his part, denied involvement in the altercation and claimed it was his brother Juan who broke Solis' jaw. The WBC rushed to Canelo's defense, Canelo pressed on with his career, and it was thought that Solis was never going to get justice.

***
It's a known fact that Canelo was pressing for a Cotto fight. Canelo-Cotto would have generated big money, and if Canelo beat Cotto, it would have proved his legitimacy.

As it happened, though, Trout beat Cotto.

Golden Boy therefore looked to set Canelo up with Alfredo Angulo. Angulo, a made-for-TV fighter, knows no other way but to move forward and punch hard. Though an Angulo fight would have attracted viewers, Angulo would have been cannon fodder for Canelo. 

But Canelo didn't want to fight Angulo. He wanted to fight Trout. While Schaefer wanted to ""explore more options"", Canelo wouldn't take any other opponent. He absolutely insisted on fighting Trout.

Why did he insist so emphatically? Revenge.

Canelo could not forget Trout's fight against Rigoberto — a fight that derailed Rigoberto's career.

Many people question the revenge angle. They think it's a product of marketing. However, I believe Canelo really is out for revenge. Golden Boy isn't making this about revenge; Canelo is. And while Trout wonders if Canelo plans to beat up everyone who's ever beat up his brother, I have no question that Canelo's doing this for revenge.

Why? Because if Canelo's the kind of person to break Solis' jaw due to baby momma drama, why wouldn't he risk his entire career just to avenge his brother? On the same token, one may wonder why he blamed *another* brother for the altercation with Solis while also trying to defend family honour against Trout.

But that all implies that Canelo's a completely rational human being — which I don't think he is.

***
Yesterday, authorities in Jalisco requested that an arrest warrant be made against Canelo. This request stems from the altercation with Solis. Though it's been a year and a half removed from the physical altercation, Mexican authorities are now moving forward with the case. 

It is now two days before the fight and you got to wonder if the prospect of jail time is weighing heavy on Canelo. 

Canelo has yet to comment on his impending arrest, but he claims to be entirely focused on Trout.

“On Saturday, after defeating Trout,"" Canelo is quoted as saying, ""I will raise my hand and my belt and will be thinking of my brother.  That belt is his.""

One wonders if Canelo is also thinking of his *other* brother. Juan Alvarez, along with Canelo, is facing jail time for making false statements to police about the incident with Solis.

***
Canelo-Trout isn't a fight that exists in a vacuum. It's as much interesting for the stories that have happened outside the ring for what may potentially happen inside of it.

Canelo better be ready to fight Trout. If he's not ready, he may never be ready.

Because Trout is the kind of man who finds a way to win even when he shouldn't.",,False,,t5_2qj0l,1366337523.0,,,True,t3_1cn9on,http://www.reddit.com/r/Boxing/comments/1cn9on/canelotrout_penicillin_out_of_moldy_bread/,

As a reminder, **keep spoilers out of the titles of submissions for the first 48 hours after after an event airs**.  There will be threads dedicated (with ""Spoiler"" tags) to the discussion and thoughts on all the fights for today, so don't sumbit a link like ""OMZ I CAN'T BELIEVE THAT DECISION!"" or ""DID YOU SEE THAT KO?!?!"".  These posts will be dealt with swiftly.  Don't be a ruiner.

Here's a list of the fights and card start times for today:

*  Vitali Klitschko vs. Manuel Charr (2:30pm EST and on HBO at 9:45 EST)
*  Tony Bellew vs. Edison Miranda (3:30pm EST)
*  Lucas Matthysse vs Ajose Olusegun (9:00pm EST on Showtime)
*  Antonio DeMarco vs. John Molina (on the undercard of Ward/Dawson)
*  Andre Ward vs. Chad Dawson (9:45pm EST on HBO)


There are five high-level, (mostly) highly competitive bouts for today.  Here's the rundown on them:

**Klitschko/Charr**
While this fight will probably not be competitive as Vitali looks to be in great shape and has barely lost a round in almost 10 years, this could be the champ's last fight.  There have been rumors that Vitali will hang up the gloves in favor of his aspiring political career.  Either way, it's fun to watch a very dominant fighter do what he does best: dominate.  This fight should not last the distance as Charr has been fighting the leftovers of the B/C-level fighter's leftovers.  Charr will be completely overmatched against Vitali, and I see him getting stopped in about 5-6 rounds. The pick:  Vitali Klitschko TKO6 Manuel Charr.

**Bellew/Miranda**
This fight may not be high-profile, but it has the makings of a good (B-/C)-level fight action fight.  Bellew's only loss came against Nathan Cleverly, and Miranda has lost in every step-up fight he's had.  Miranda could be on his way out of the sport if he doesn't look good in this fight.  Bellew comes to fight and isn't afraid to take a punch if it means he gets to land one.  Bellew seems to be either leveling out at this point in his career and Miranda is gradually declining.  Bellew probably doesn't have the power to stop Miranda, so the pick here is Tony Bellew UD10 Edison Miranda.

**Matthysse/Olusegun**
This fight became the headliner for this Showtime date after Randall Bailey pulled out of his fight with Devon Alexander, and it looks to be a very entertaining fight.  I'm pretty high on Matthysse after his performances against Alexander (robbed in Alexander's backyard) and Humberto Soto.  This is Olusegun's 2nd fight outside of the UK, and it's against one of the top 3 guys in the 140lb division.  Matthysse comes into the ring to knock you out, and if Olusegun can weather an early storm, he might be able to last into the middle rounds.  Olusegun doesn't have the power to keep Matthysse at bay, and I don't see this fight going the distance.  The pick here is Lucan Matthysse KO 7 Ajose Olusegun.

**DeMarco/Molina**
If you need any indication of DeMarco's ability to turn a fight around, go to youtube and look up Jorge Linares vs. Antonio DeMarco, then come back and read the rest.  Wow.  Antonio DeMarco was getting outboxed for the first 9.5 rounds.  He never lost his cool, got frustrated, or made dumb mistakes, but he took his time and wore his man down.  Every time I think of that fight, my mind immediately goes to Linares bending over with rivers of blood streaming from his face.  It was a sight.  DeMarco is a very good southpaw boxer-puncher.  His only stoppage loss was to Edwin Valero and who can blame him for that?  Molina is no slouch either.  He's got the power to end a fight and the skill-set to use that power efficiently.  This is a very good lightweight match-up.  Expect fireworks.  Also expect DeMarco to get a couple of tough spots early on in the fight to eventually win a close decision.  The pick is Antonio DeMarco UD12 John Molina.

**Ward/Dawson**
This is the fight of the weekend.  This is a huge fight.  It is not often that two lineal belt holders from two different weight division get in the ring together and go at it.  The last time this happened was when Ricky Hatton (140lbs) stepped up to fight Floyd Mayweather Jr. (147lbs).  That was 4 years and 9 months ago (thanks Boxingscene).  This type of thing does not happen often, but when it does, we need to step up and take note.  Even though this could be a devastatingly boring fight, it's a big deal.  Ward is fresh off winning the Showtime Super Six Tournament and Dawson just captured the lineal Light Heavyweight title from Bernard Hopkins this past April in dominating fashion.  Dawson challenged Ward to this fight in the post-fight interview and the fight was made very quickly.  If Dawson comes forward behind his jab using combinations, Ward will have a very, very tough night.  But if Dawson plays it like the first 10 rounds in his fight with Jean Pascal, Ward is going to be able to jump in and out with ease while tagging Dawson with 1 and 2 punch combinations.  Neither fighter has shown the ability to produce knockouts at this level, so it very safe to assume that we are in for a 47-minute affair with these two.  The smart money (and mine) is on Andre Ward with a decision tonight, but it's hard to say that when you see Chad Dawson throw these 3,4,5-punch combinations so fluidly.  I think that Ward takes the first 3-4 rounds, Dawson comes on in the middle rounds but loses focus as the fight wears on.  Both fighters employ dirty tactics in the ring, so watch out for headbutts, elbows, and the Dawson Slam.  The pick here is Andre Ward UD12 Chad Dawson.

If you don't have HBO or Showtime but want to watch these fights, learn how to use the internet.  Thanks for reading and watch out for spoilers in the title posts tonight!

*Arreola vs Mitchell* - After Seth Mitchell avenged his only loss in a long, slow paced rematch against Jonathan Banks he immediately takes a larger test. Enter Chris Arreola, coming off a decision loss he looks to get replace himself as a solid contender.

*Chavez Jr vs Vera* - Coming off a decision loss to Middleweight King Martinez, Chavez Jr takes a catch weight bout against the 31 year old Brian Vera, Vera has a streak of wins, those wins include Dzinziruik and Sergio Mora. Chavez Jr always has entertaining fight, Vera will make it entertaining.

**September 14**

*Mayweather - Canelo* - I do not believe a bigger fight has been made since De La Hoya - Mayweather, even with that, I think it may be bigger. Canelo, the young, undefeated fighter touted as the next P4P King, and Floyd Mayweather, the P4P King, a fight of the crossroads. Sure, there may not be fireworks or knockdowns, but it's a massive event, one so massive I doubt we'll see anything like it until the next few years.

*Mathysse - Garcia* - The top dogs of the dangerous 140 division. Expect fireworks, knockdowns, may it be a one sided beat down or an epic war is another concern.

**September 28**

*Fury - Haye* - Many observing the heavyweight division pointed towards English prospects David Price and Tyson Fury, touting them as possible world champions, those same people suggested a match between the two prospects to see which was superior. This became unneeded when Price was upset twice by Tony Thompson. Now Fury takes a massive step-up to face David Haye, arguably one of the best heavyweights in the world, third only to the Klitschkos. This is a massive step-up for Fury, but it should be an entertaining fight.

**October 5**

*Klitschko - Povetkin* - Speaking of heavyweights, Wladimir Klitschko and his brother, Vitali Klitschko stand alone at the top of the heavyweight division. Unless your name is David Haye, any opponent hoping to beat either Klitschkos, especially Wladimir Klitschko, would have to pull off the boxing upset of the year. And then enters Povetkin, the number one contender, many give the rugged Russian Olympian a solid chance to defeat Wladimir, if anybody can hope to dethrone the Klitschko rein as of now, it's Povetkin.

*Cotto - Rodriguez* - Continuing the action that very day, future Hall of Famer Miguel Cotto takes on Delvin Rodriguez, Cotto and Rodriguez have a common lost to Trout, the winner here will have a solid title shot once more, Cotto always an exciting fighter, and Rodriguez, hoping to take the opportunity Cotto has given to many will hope to upset the Puerto Rican star.

**October 12**

*Bradley - Marquez* - Marquez is coming off one of the most stunning knockouts in boxing history. Finally settling the score with rival Pacquiao, he hopes to claim another belt in another division by challenging Bradley. Bradley is a strong boxer, who many know, he came off an exciting win over Prodovnik in a Fight of the Year Contender.

**October 19**

*Prodovnik - Alvarado* - Fireworks, lots, and lots of firework.

**October 26**

*Hopkins - Murat* - Hopkins continues to flip off Father Time as he breaks his own record for being the oldest champion in boxing history, now he faces fringe contender Karo Murat. This fight is interesting to see what Hopkins can do, and what Hopkins can do may give us a peak at what lies in the ageless career of the 148 year old Bernard Hopkins.

*Kell Brook - Vyacheslav Senchenko* - Kell Brook has been a solid welterweight contender for a while now, the only reason he's seen as a joke by many is because he continues to fight inferior opposition that don't exactly have much of a chance to beat him. Senchenko on the other hand is a strong contender who fights anyone he can, in his last outing he put the ends of Ricky Hatton comeback dream by knocking the Hall of Famer out in the last rounds of his comeback bout. This is an interesting fight between two contenders which may lead them to a title shot, and it has the potential to be explosive.

**November 23**

*Froch - Groves* - When Andre Ward ~~abused~~ decisively defeated Carl Froch, he was momentary stepping stone to what appeared to be a top P4P fighter, fights later when Froch avenged his other only loss to Kessler, Ward was left out in the dark. Froch stubbornly refused a rematch even though Ward gave into every demand, and for some reason decided to fight Groves. And while Ward is annoyingly left in the dark, Groves get a shot of a life time, he impressed me in his last outing and he has the potential to upset Froch, fireworks will go off. But not just in England.

*Manny Pacquiao - Brandon Rios* - When Pacquiao was suddenly knocked out cold by rival Marquez, I'm sure Marquez himself, along with the entire boxing world was shocked at the devastating loss to the boxing superstar. On the admittedly end of his career, Pacquiao prepares for a final run against the always tough and strong Brandon Rios. Fireworks will definitely go off here, a fitting way to end November and all the epic boxing fights September, October and November will have.

It's a little bit rudimentary for this community, but I thought it might be well-received.

Muhammad Ali was six foot three, and in 1960 people were about an inch shorter than they are now: so he was a tall guy with a pretty lanky build. Here's a pair of videos with him in them, watch closely as you read the following paragraph: 

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RmaHGY7BEog
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H56dQ5Lm298

Muhammad Ali's weight is often over his back foot, his stance is bladed, his hands are kept low. The weight distribution permits quick retreat and lateral movement, the stance puts his hip behind his cross, his low hands tempt an opponent to throw shots at his seemingly exposed head, even when not quite in range. Offensively, he throws plenty of straight punches from a distance, and his chief knockout punch is the right straight- often thrown while moving backwards. Defensively, he emphasized footwork and distance primarily, and head movement secondarily- often rocking back and away from an opponent's punch and coming back with a counter straight. 
His body is built for this: keeping someone at the end of a long straight punch as he dances out of their way on his long legs.

Mike Tyson, by contrast, was built like a fireplug. He was five foot ten with T-Rex arms, and regularly fought people half a foot taller than him. Here's some video, watch it as you read:

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FgS3kCv79I

Mike Tyson's weight is often over his front foot, his stance is square, his hands kept glued to his cheeks. The weight distribution primes him to charge forward, the stance puts his hip behind his left hook, his hands provide a shield against an opponent's jab. Offensively, he was at his best when he overwhelmed his opponent with short, compact hooks and uppercuts from the inside. Defensively, he emphasized head movement primarily- often slipping to the side of an opponent's shot and using it as an opening to get him into close range- and a tight guard secondarily.
His body is built for that: getting in and overwhelming his opponent with the power he can get out of those short, compact arms.",,False,,t5_2qj0l,1365646989.0,,,True,t3_1c3x5f,http://www.reddit.com/r/Boxing/comments/1c3x5f/body_type_and_boxing_style_two_case_studies/,

1349030351.0,32,self.Boxing,10pxzu,5 Most Overrated Fighters in Boxing,45,13,41,http://www.reddit.com/r/Boxing/comments/10pxzu/5_most_overrated_fighters_in_boxing/,"After writing the [5 Most Underrated Fighters in Boxing](http://www.reddit.com/r/Boxing/comments/10k15o/5_most_underrated_fighters_in_boxing/), someone asked me to do a follow-up list. In general, I don't like to be negative about any fighter. After all, they are putting their lives in the ring. However, I thought this would be an interesting challenge because there clearly are fighters more highly regarded than they deserve to be.

One thing before I start: I'm not putting Mayweather or Pacquiao on this list. In both cases, they are P4P fighters. It is clear to me they are overrated by their respective fans, and underrated by their detractors.

Without further ado, here's my list:

5. **Nathan Cleverly**. *The* worst champion in boxing today. This is in a division that includes Beibut Shumenov as a fellow champion. Why does he have a fanbase? Because he's a) Welsh and b) compared to Joe Calzaghe. Yet, Cleverly is no Joe Calzaghe. For one, Calzaghe probably never would have struggled so badly against the likes of Tony Bellew.

4. **Alexander Povetkin**. Yeah, he's WBA ""champion"", but this is the definition of a paper belt if I've ever heard of one — seeing how Wladimir Klitschko holds the WBA ""super"" championship belt. Anyway, how is it that Povetkin goes life and death with a Marco Huck? It was Huck's first ever heavyweight fight. He came in at 209lbs to Povetkin's 230lbs. Yet, Povetkin won only because something was fishy with the scorecards. Okay — maybe this was an anomaly. Yet, last night, Povetkin fought a barely mobile Hasim Rahman and managed to get hit. How do you get hit by a man who has trouble getting down the stairs?

3. **Andre Dirrell**. If you listen to some fans, you'd think that Dirrell is the only fighter right now who could possibly beat Andre Ward. Yet, Dirrell *lost* a split decision to Carl Froch (sidenote: isn't it crazy that Froch doesn't get more credit for winning this match). Granted, Dirrell has some talent, but his last win was against a guy currently rated 102 on Boxrec. I don't care how talented you are. If you haven't fought elite competition in 2 1/2 years, there's no way you're beating Andre Ward.

2. **Adrien Broner**. People are already trumpeting Broner as the next Floyd Mayweather, but has America been sold a Jeff Lacy-style hypejob? Perhaps. Broner's best wins come against a coked-out Eloy Perez, and Vicente Escobedo. In the latter fight, he completely blew off making weight — rendering the results of the fight suspect. The only time he's fought a top 5 man in his division was against Daniel Ponce de Leon, a fight in which not only was he thoroughly outboxed, but was gifted a decision. (Sidenote: if you want to know how to beat the Philly Shell, watch Broner's fight against Ponce de Leon). So why is Broner not #1 on this list? Because he's fighting Antonio DeMarco in November. If he wins that fight, my hat goes off to him.

1. **Canelo Alvarez**. Alvarez is the WBC titlist for 154lbs. Yet, go through his record, and what do you see? Alvarez beating up Welterweights. Hell, his last fight was against a guy who is a natural *Jr. Welterweight*. If he's primarily fighting Welterweights, why is he being ranked so highly as a Jr. Middleweight? I don't know. What I do know is, there's only two semi-elite Jr. Middleweight's he's beaten legitimately: old and faded Kermit Cintron, and old and faded Ryan Rhodes. Of the two, Rhodes truly was Alvarez' best win. Is that win good enough to justify Canelo's hype? I don't think so. But maybe it will be if Canelo ever has the cojones to fight Erislandy Lara, Carlos Molina, Vanes Martirosyan, Cornelius Bundrage, etc.

**History: Julio Cesar Chavez and the Puerto Ricans of His Era**

Standing at not-threatening 1.71 meter, Julio Cesar Chavez has a long shadow that stretches through most of Latin America. A fighter that seemed capable of facing a truck, body punching it, and knocking it down. 

A very capable fighter to say the least. 

Julio Cesar Chavez, would in-fact face many notable opponents, yet in his glorious record of **116** fights, he faced many mediocre opponents. 

The first Puerto Rican Fighter Julio Cesar Chavez, at the time having a record of 36-0 faced was named Javier Fragoso was **0-2**.

Many of these early fights of the Mexican Warrior usually ended by knockout, and were they something special. The small man would stalk his opponents down, tearing them inside out with his monstrous body-shots; and don't even begin to speculate you could knock him down, he would simply absorb all his opponent's punches and simply increase the pressure. 

Out boxing him wasn't easy either, his movements were something spectacular, and he would always find a way to get back on the inside, as he slowed you down with his painful body shots that simply weren't human. 

Julio Cesar Chavez at 43-0 was an underdog against 33-1-2 Mario Martinez, who unlike Chavez had taken on tough opposition, and had now worked his way up to alongside Chavez to fight for the vacant Super Featherweight Title, some expected the untested Chavez to be outclassed by the Martinez, but these doubters and critics of Chavez's record were proven wrong as he defeated Martinez by technical decision in the eighth round, proving he was a truly skilled fighter.

Chavez was improving every fight he went through and to top it off, he was a World Titlist and he was defeating contenders of his division with relative ease.

Ironically, it would be a fighter with an ugly record that would give the young Chavez one of his toughest fight. 

A fighter holding a record of 53-0 against one which was...27-6. The fighter at 27-6 was the same fighter whose first title shot was against Wilfredo Gomez, the same one suffered a controversial loss against a legendary Featherweight Fighter.

Juan Laporte was not expected win. 

The Puerto Rican Fighter, as young as Chavez, yet slightly past his prime wound give the Mexican Fighter, still young still hadn't reached his prime, his toughest bout. 

It was an all-out war between a Mexican Fighter and Puerto Rican Fighter, Laporte would be one of the few fighters in who would find an outside to battle the Mexican Warrior. Taking an early lead against the slower Chavez, Laporte defiantly surprised a number of people.

Chavez as the bout continued would slow down Laporte with his monstrous body shots, and in general, his power punches, and somehow Laporte refused to fall down as he continued his attempt to break the perfect record of 53-0. 

In the end of the bout, both still seemed to hold much of their energy, with much of their energy, Chavez more confident and energetic as he had taken the last few rounds, Laporte looking battered yet still seemed confident. 

It's a bout that seemed at the time it could head both-ways, and Chavez was the one to receive the nod from the judges. Due to many people believing Laporte deserved the win, Chavez was quoted to say; ""I would not have complained if he had won the decision.""

But in the end, the Mexican Warrior's record stood at 54-0, with another notable win to his resume.

Chavez would later move up to Lightweight were he encounter another Puerto Rican Fighter who stood at a near-dominant position in the Lightweight Division.  

Enter Edwin Rosario, 31-2, nearly all his wins had come by the way of knockout, a fighter that somehow stayed increasingly competitive in all his bouts. Even when past his best, he somehow nearly defeated Hector Camacho, practically ruining the flashy Puerto Rican with a single power punch that made Camacho change his whole style. 

Chavez was coming up his date, and Rosario had won his last few fights by knockdown. 

Though Chavez was considered a favorite questions lingered. How would Chavez, moving up in weight handle the power-punching Rosario? Many Puerto Ricans eagerly tuned-in to the fight, hoping that Rosario, a fan-favorite along with Hector Camacho to defeat and avenge the controversial loss of Juan Laporte, and people all around Mexico similarly tuned-in to see the rising Mexican Star who had gained the support of his people.

It was supposed to be an exciting and competitive bout between the two Latinos, yet only one of the rival nations cheered on as the fight went on, and it wasn't Puerto Rico. 

Julio Cesar Chavez entered his prime in his 57th bout. Rosario, who had promised to send Chavez back to Mexico in a cabin was silenced, as he was tossed around for 11 rounds until the referee stopped the fight.

Not just Mexico, but the world was awe'd. Sports Illustrated: **""Time To Hail César: WBA Lightweight Champion César Chávez of Mexico may be the world's best fighter.""**

Chavez later gained another title at the division as he continued to win and defeat contenders at Lightweight, he later went onto Super Lightweight, easily defeating Roger Mayweather and defeating future Puerto Rican Champion Sammy Fuentes.

But there were more challenges at Light Welterweight, after spectacularly defeating the lightning-fast Meldrick Taylor, behind on points and knocking him down in the last few seconds of the last round, with the referee stopping the fight, in a fight that would later earn Fight of the Decade Honor, Julio Cesar Chavez gained the respect of the Boxing World. Or their ire at the controversial stoppage of Meldrick Taylor.

Ire or respect, an island's view did not change. 

Nor did the view of the flamboyant Hector Camacho.

Hector Camacho had defeated Mexican Rafael Limons and Mexican Jose Luis Ramirez with his blazing speed and movement. His wild acts outside and inside the ring captured many people's attention. 

And he had not lost to a Mexican like Chavez had not lost to a Puerto Rican. 

It is to be noted, though Chavez had reached a breathtaking record of 82-0, nor Camacho, with a small record of 39-1, were not in their primes when they fought. Though Chavez had clearly aged better than most fighters, still good enough to be considered one of the best in the world, Camacho had not. 

In his win over Puerto Rican Rival Rosario, Rosario clearly hurt Camacho. And badly. The single shot would change Camacho's entire style, to that of moving backwards and using his speed to his advantage, on the contrary to his offensive style which he would make his opponents fold due to the pressure of his speed.

This would one of the first few Mexican-Puerto Rican Fights labeled as a...well, Mexican-Puerto Rican Fight. The rivalry of the two nations was now well-known in the boxing world, especially in the two nations which once again tuned in to the fight.

In the build-up to the fight, Camacho claimed to have hired a witch, and put a curse of Julio Cesar Chavez, Chavez in response due to superstition, hired another witch and countered Camacho's curse by wearing a red bandanna to the fight. The trash-talking Camacho quickly got on the nerves of Chavez, both almost attacking each other in the press conference. Chavez, angered, promise over, and over, and over again in the fight buildup, swearing he would knockout Camacho.

And with shades of Rosario-Chavez, a fight billed as competitive fight soon became a one-sided beating. Hector Camacho's style clearly was not suited to against the hard-punching come forward style of Chavez. His power was not enough to trouble Chavez, his blazing speed was negated by Chavez's movement pressure style, and even held back by Camacho's own defensive style which he had now adopted. 

And in the end, Chavez was was the victor. And what was to be expected? It was a fight that when it was happening, most quickly realized it was mismatch. 

Yet Camacho raised his hands in victory, Chavez knew why.

Because Chavez didn't knock him out

In the end, Chavez would come out as popularly Mexico's greatest fighter, he would later draw with Pernell Whitaker, in which many believed Whitaker should have won. He would also lose a decision against Frankie Randall.

Yet in the end, the toughest challenge against a Puerto Rican Fighter was against Juan Laporte.

And in the end he was never defeated by a Puerto Rican Fighter.

The era of the late 80's and early 90's slowly began to fade, the stories of Juan Laporte, Julio Cesar Chavez and Hector Camacho began to fade. 

New fighters began to rise.

Enter Felix Trinidad and Oscar De La Hoya.

**The Fourth Best Mexican Fighter of All Time**

**Salvador Sanchez**- This will definitely have one or two eyebrows raised. Salvador Sanchez was 23 when he died in a tragic accident. Yet his record does not need words to describe. Wins over Juan Laporte, Wilfredo Gomez, Felix Trinidad Sr., 47-1 Ruben Castillo, 43-1 Roberto Castanon, Azumah Nelson and many others. With a record of 44-1, 32 of those wins by way of knockout, his relentless pressure and incredible chin could have possibly led this 23 year old to be the greatest Featherweight Fighter of All Time.

**The Fourth Best Puerto Rican Fighter of All Time**

This will not go without controversy.



**Felix Trinidad**

Felix Trinidad Jr debuted at 17 and having an incredible career, he was mainly known for his exciting fight, and dear lord his godly power. That godly power was simply, well, godly, he knocked people who've never been knocked down with no problems. He would face people known to have chins as hard as granite, yet with a few punches he knock them down to the point where they had nothing left. 

He has wins over Hector Camacho, 56-0 Yori Boys Campas, Maurice Blocker, Oba Carr, Pernell Whitaker, William Joppy, Ricardo Mayorga, a trademark win over Fernando Vargas, and a controversial victory over Oscar De La Hoya.

His fights always seemed to be excited has he was frequently knocked down, yet would somehow get up with his chin suddenly increasing in resistance. Felix Trinidad with a record of 42-3 may just be the greatest Puerto Rican Fighter of All Time.",,False,,t5_2qj0l,False,,,True,t3_19jdsp,http://www.reddit.com/r/Boxing/comments/19jdsp/puerto_rico_vs_mexico_a_boxing_rivalry_part_2/,

1320996524.0,32,self.Boxing,m8hge,PREVIEW: Manny Pacquiao vs. Juan Manuel Marquez,36,4,21,http://www.reddit.com/r/Boxing/comments/m8hge/preview_manny_pacquiao_vs_juan_manuel_marquez/,"*I'm thinking about doing previews of all the big boxing events. If you like this one, please let me know*

**When is it?** Nov 12, 2011 at  9:00 PM EST

**Where is it?** MGM Grand - Las Vegas, Nevada

**What's the big deal?** This is the third fight in what will probably be seen as the defining boxing trilogy of our generation. In the first fight, Juan Manuel Marquez was knocked down early in the fight -- then fought his way to a draw. In the second fight, Pacquiao won by split decision -- with many people saying Marquez deserved the win.

This fight is supposed to be the one that ""settles questions"", with the most prominent being, ""Who's better?""

**What about the undercard?** Because most people who are tuning in are casual fans who just want to see Manny, the pickings are slim. That said, Timothy Bradley vs. Joel Casamayor is the most prominent. This is Bradley's first fight with new promoter Top Rank, and serves as a comeback of sorts (though he's undefeated with a 27-0 record). 

If Bradley wins with flying colors, he will either be Pacquiao's next opponent, or will fight Amir Khan for the undisputed Jr. Welterweight championship.

**Predictions** While Marquez has unquestionably figured out Pacquiao's style, there's likely too many hurdles for him to overcome. For one, while Marquez is the legit Lightweight champion of the world, he'll be fighting at Welterweight. The last time he fought at this division -- when he fought Mayweather -- he looked sluggish and slow. On top of this, Marquez is 38-years-old and is nearing the end of this career. Pacquiao will probably win by late round TKO.

Regarding Bradley-Casamayor, there's no question Bradley will probably win this -- though Casamayor will probably do his damnedest to make it look ugly. Still, Bradley will need to look good if he's going to impress those casual fans who only buy Pacquiao fights. I still have it Bradley by UD.

**Should I buy this fight?** Buying Pacquiao-Marquez III is pretty much like watching Return of the Jedi. If you don't watch the previous episodes, you're missing a lot. 

If you buy this fight, make sure you watch the first two fights beforehand. If haven't seen the previous two fights -- and don't plan on seeing them -- spend your money on Cotto-Margarito II.

**Rating:** B+. If it had a better undercard, I'd rate it higher. As it is, the whole card must be judged by the main event. If Marquez hasn't aged over night, this could be pretty decent. If it's obvious he's passed his prime, this card is bound to disappoint.",,False,,t5_2qj0l,True,,,True,t3_m8hge,http://www.reddit.com/r/Boxing/comments/m8hge/preview_manny_pacquiao_vs_juan_manuel_marquez/,

1376665491.0,31,self.Boxing,1khowr,"Lucas Matthysse: When I look at myself in the ring, I get scared. Best interview I've ever translated.",35,4,21,http://www.reddit.com/r/Boxing/comments/1khowr/lucas_matthysse_when_i_look_at_myself_in_the_ring/,"Meet Jose Acebal, the carpenter, and his rise to stardom. 

When did you start boxing?

When I was 10 or 11. When my mom divorced my dad, I left with her and my sister Jennifer. After, I moved to Rafaela, where I lived with Juan Keller, a greengrocer who wanted to host boxers. He treated me like his son. It was in that house where I also met Marcos Maidana.

How (did you meet him/did this happen)?

- We helped Keller with his greengrocery shop. We used to go get vegetables in the truck, and go out to different towns. First, we'd sell the vegetables, then we would fight in the sports clubs (of the towns). By that time, I had already fought professionally in Rafaela, but with another name, because I was a minor (less than 16 years old), and they wouldn't give me a license. My name was José Acebal. It was crazy, cuz I had a tattoo on my chest that said ""Lucas"". That year, I was selected to the national team. Like I had done various times in the past, I packed my bag without looking back and traveled to Buenos Aires.

What did you pack everytime you left?

The very little things I had. A picture of my family, if I had any. My mom worked a lot, and she gave me a camera when I was 16, as a present. Those are unforgettable memories. 

How was life at the Cenard (the national team barracks)?

It was complicated, because I lost touch with many people. Sometimes my mom would come visit me, and she'd stay there, hiding unnoticed. She was the mom for everyone there, everyone would tell her how they felt. The team would ask for extra rations so that we could give them to my mom, and little by little, we filled her plate. 

Do you still have that close relationship with your mom?

Yeah, of course, I am very good mate. Now in training camp, I sleep next to her. She's my mom, and I love her: I thank her that she's always with me. 

How was it living with Marcos Maidana?

Very quiet, because we don't talk a lot, haha. We lived many things together, since we were kids, and we respect each other. When people say that they want to see us in the ring, I say that I don't have a problem, that if we have to fight, we'll fight. But there are so many others to fight, why do they have to bust my balls with trying to make us fight? We fought in the amateurs. He beat me 3 times, and we tied 1. Then we sparred in the national team. We both hit the canvas, I know how hard he hits, and he knows my hand too. I know what kind of punch he'll throw, and what kind of movement he'll follow with after. 

Is he the one that hit you the hardest (ever)?

No. It was Humberto ""La Zorrita"" Soto the one who made me feel his hand the most. But I think I have a good chin, because none could tell that I was hurt.

Have you ever thought about leaving boxing?

Yeah, a bunch of times. When I lost against Judah, I felt very tired. Then with Alexander, same thing. But my daughter, Priscilla told me: ""Dad, keep going, because you fight well"". And I kept going because she requested it.

If you hadn't done that, what would have done?

Probably a carpenter. When I was a kid, I learned how to use tools very well. I also like tattoos. I started with a needle and some average ink. Then I made a homemade tattoo machine and I learned. Now, I have all the right tools, though. I learned how to make them when I was in the national team. If you ever look at Maidana's first tattoo, it's in his back, and I made it for him. 

What happens if you beat Danny Garcia ...?

(Interrupts) i WILL beat him.

Ok, so you beat him, and then names come down raining. When are you ever going to get tired of this?

I'm still going to be the same. Maybe it'll get tougher in my everyday life. My career will change, but not me. I'm grateful to everyone who follows my career and what I'm doing. But if it was up to me, I would really like it if nobody knew me. If i go to a restaurant and they say ""Lucas Matthysse, the champion"" I don't go there anymore. Or if I go to the store, and they tell me ""Just take it free of charge, champ"", I feel bad. I work, just like everybody. I like paying for myself, I don't like gifts. I like it when people call me Lucas, not ""Champ"". I'm a champion on the ring, but on the ground, I'm just myself. Sometimes the guys from the gym call me ""Champ"" just to get my blood boiling. 

How are you at home? What do you do at home?

I'm quiet, very indoor person. I don't go out to clubs. I like being at home, with my dog watching tv. Now that I have a big TV, I watch many documentaries of animals or aliens. I like war movies, but horror movies scare me a little bit, haha. If there are things on tv that don't impress me, I just change the channel. 

Ha!, so you're a softie, then!

Hahaha, yeah. I transform, I'm someone else. Up in the ring, because my daughter's future my family's and my team's is in jeopardy. But when I come down, I'm like a puppy.

Carlos Monzon used to say that his opponents were thieves that came to steal his sons' bread and that's why he hated them so much.

When they tell me to go in that ring, I transform. Don't ask me what happens to me, I don't see anything. After, I watch the videos of what I do in the fight, and when I look at what I do in the ring, I get scared of myself. I get scared of how forward I am and how I hit.

Talking about fear, did you see Garcia's face after your fight with Peterson?

His face changed. More than one person that night came to see me lose. And Garcia was one of them. Before the fight, he was bragging and waving at ringside. And after I knocked Peterson out, they zoomed him in, and he looked as pale as a ghost. If I was in his place, my ass would be full of questions and doubt. Because if I go see a future rival, and he knocks someone out like I did it, I'd be as worried as he looked.

Kays is still throwing the jab, but it doesn't look as sharp as it was earlier. Sykes aggression looks to be overwhelming Kays. Now kays is trying to double up on the jab, but Sykes just cam in and landed a left.

*10-9 Sykes, 68-65 Sykes*

***Round 8:*** Some good exchanges now! Kays must realize that he needs to do more to win this fight, because he's dialling up his aggression.

***Round 1:*** Khan throws his first punches, misses Fidore, and gets countered. Khan looks tese. Oh! Khan just droves Fidore to the ropes, and unleashes a good head shot. Love Khan's ring generalship so far. Some good hooks by Khan so far. Fidore tries to go for his own head shot, but Khan rolled with it, then unleashed a combo to the body.

***Round 3:*** So far, I think Khan has a lot of promise. He just got caught by Fidore's right hand, though. Left hand by Khan just snapped Fidore's head back — that generated a cheer from the crowd. Right hand by Fidore just caught Khan right again, but Khan countered and did well. Fidore doing better this round and Khan is showing defensive lapses right now.

The bell rings.

**Official Results** Score: 40-36. Khan PTS Fidore.

## Deontay Wilder vs. Audley Harrison

## Amir Khan vs. Julio Diaz
***Round 1:*** Khan keeping his right hand closer to his chin than usualy. He pumps the jab at a distance, and keeps Diaz at bay. Khan now gets some combos in for the first time. Diaz tries to counter Khan... and Khan actually slipped it. Khan remaining cagey, not letting Diaz get inside. Diaz comes in with a sneaky right that does nothing but touches Khan. Khan with jabs to the body. Good right hand hits Diaz cleanly on the chin. Khan not so reckless with his combos so far!

*10-9 Khan*

***Round 2:*** Khan's jabs are earning him respect from Diaz. Diaz trying to counter Khan, but Khan's head movement prevented him from being caught. Right by Diaz lets Khan know he's still in this. Khan then explodes with a body shot that drives Diaz to the corner. Diaz catches Khan with a right, but it doesn't phase Khan. Khan picking his shots very carefully at a distance.

It was an amazing display of heart and determination for both fighters. We should be taking our hat off because the fight, in almost all ways, was incredible.

But what's happening across the Internet? Tears. Lots of them. Because Bradley's fall in R1 was not ruled a knockdown. 

So let's go over this. Even if all judges ruled R1 as 10-8, Bradley would still be leaving the ring with his belt. Why? Because it would be a draw. To take someone's belt, you have to win the fight.

But this ""controversy"" says more about boxing ""fans"" than it does about the fight.

It is true that boxing has controversy, but whiners do just as much harm for boxing. We should all be celebrating great fights, trumpeting truly awesome performances like Bradley-Provodnikov — not moaning and complaining every time a fight isn't *just so*. Bradley-Provodnikov wasn't Campillo-Cloud. It wasn't even Usmanee-Barthelemy. 

It's okay, to disagree with scoring, but be reasonable about it. Calling Bradley-Provodnikov a robbery does a disservice to *real* robberies like Alexander-Matthysse. There was real corruption going on with Alexander-Matthysse. With Bradley-Provodnikov, what you got is a close fight that went Bradley's way. 

Last night, we saw boxing get overshadowed by an over-hyped, non-competitive, man-hugging competition that took *all* the buzz on Twitter and Facebook. Bradley-Provodnikov got no hype, no buzz, no talk. Do you know why? 

Because instead of screaming to the rafters about what a *great* fucking fight this was, we have anti-social dicks scream about a ""robbery"" that was anything but.",,False,,t5_2qj0l,1363539777.0,,,True,t3_1agx3v,http://www.reddit.com/r/Boxing/comments/1agx3v/spoiler_the_butthurt_is_fantastic/,

## Devon Alexander vs. Lee Purdy
***Round 1:*** Alexander strikes first with body shots. Purdy is biding his time, waiting for an opening. So far, Purdy's doing his best impression of a punching bag. Finally, Purdy comes close and rips his own body shots. Compared to Alexander's body shots, though, they're insignificant. Finally, Purdy taps Alexander's chin. They both exchange. Looks like a fight might actually break out. Alexander then bangs Purdy with the uppercut right at the bell!

*10-9 Alexander*

***Round 2:*** Alexander continues to pick his shots well. Great body shots. Purdy keeps moving forward, but he's shelled up. Alexander splits the guard with an uppercut. Alexander's really loading up with some combos now. So far Purdy's landed nothing of consequence. Looks like there's a difference in class.

*10-9 Alexander, 20-18 Alexander*

***Round 3:*** Alexander is just banging him up. I don't think Alexander will KO Purdy, but he sure as hell will blow him out over 12 rounds. Finally, Purdy responds with a few heavy hands, but Alexander replies with his own. Looks like some swelling under Alexander's eye. Maybe that will make this fight more interesting.

*10-9 Alexander, 30-27 Alexander*

***Round 4:*** Purdy gets in one uppercut. But though he got in an uppercut, Alexander bagned him up with man, many shots. Good right hand by Alexander hurts Purdy. So far, Purdy looks to me like a walking meat rack.

*10-9 Alexander, 40-36 Alexander*

***Round 5:*** Purdy got in some nice, choice uppercuts. He can bang Alexander all he likes. Alexander has a Grade-A chin. Unfortunately, he's not hitting Alexander enough to neutralize Alexander's activity. A better round for Purdy, but not enough to win it.

*10-9 Alexander, 50-45 Alexander*

***Round 6:*** You know, though Alexander is winning this fight clearly, I think it should be clear to everyone at this point that he's not a banger. Purdy's in no danger, it seems, of being KOed. He just keeps on moving forward even though Alexander is throwing the kitchen sink at him. Note: Alexander's left hand *may* be injured.

*10-9 Alexander, 60-54 Alexander*

***Round 7:*** Yep, Alexander's left is broken. Purdy gets in a chopping left. It looks like Alexander is tiring even though his activity is still high. Even though Alexander is fighting one-handed (mostly), he's bossing Purdy around. Purdy with uppercuts. Alexander replies with his own combos.

*10-9 Alexander, 70-63 Alexander*

**Official Results** Alexander RTD7 Purdy. Purdy's corner stops the fight.

## Lamont Peterson vs. Lucas Martin Matthysse 
***Round 1:*** Peterson actually staying on the outside. Matthysse, you can tell, is looking to land a big shot. He jabs Peterson's body. Good left hand gets on Peterson! Peterson rides it! Peterson staying on the outside, trying to make Matthysse miss. Two solid punches by Matthysse get in near the bell, with a solid headshot landing *at* the bell!

*10-9 Matthysse*

***Round 2:*** Matthysse trying to bring in pressure, but Peterson stay out of range. Matthysse got in a rabbit punch. Matthysse to the body. Peterson needs to adjust his strategy because he's not getting in enough this round. Right hand rocks back Peterson! MATTHYSSE TO THE BODY THEN THE HEAD! PETERSON TO THE FLOOR! HE GETS UP AND BEATS THE COUNT! Peterson is now clinching hard! 

*10-8 Matthysse, 30-27 Matthysse*

***Round 3:*** Matthysse swings for the fences, and ends up slipping down. Peterson remaining cagey. He gets in an uppercut to Matthysse! Matthysse with a body shot! Peterson now moving in close on the inside! This is now becoming a toe-to-toe war! Lucas with a left, and Matthysse counters with a right! PETERSON GOES DOWN! He gets up and Smoger allows it to continue! PETERSON GOES DOWN AGAINST MATTHYSSE HARD SHORT SHOT! SMOGER STOPS THE FIGHT!

It got me thinking about how my trainer almost always has us attack with the opposite hand or foot when kickboxing. i.e.: You almost always throw a left kick or punch after throwing a right kick or punch. This led me to thinking about slipping and bobbing &amp; weaving. As a general rule, if I throw a jab (from the orthodox stance), I'm going to slip left afterwards, and if I throw a left hook, I'm going to bob and weave back to the left because that's the way my body ""rolls ."" Sorry for being long winded but I had the ""aha!"" moment of thinking this is why people slip left then right and dodge punches, and it gave me the idea to start a thread for others who actually train to throw out some points that should be obvious, but maybe people hadn't thought of before. A couple others:

-When you throw a combo like a basic 1-2, don't think of them as two separate movements. Instead, try thinking of the fact you're going to throw your rear hand AS you rotate your hips to bring your lead hand back. This combines what I previously thought of as two movements into one and makes it much more efficient.

-Learn to slip at the same time as you punch on occasion. If you can throw a double jab while slipping during the second, you'll be more prepared to throw your next combo. 

-If you fight someone whose stance is opposite yours, lead more with your rear hand than your lead hand (otherwise, you'll end up hitting them in the lead shoulder with your jab).

-RUN ON DAYS OFF. 'Nuff said.

-Think of your opponent as having crosshairs on his head or body. As my trainer says ""think like a sniper."" If he moves left, you turn with him. No matter what, keep him in front of you, or you'll open yourself up to attack, and will never get off powerful punches.

-Something not enough fighters do, IMO: MOVE!!!! After you throw a combo, move left, move right, move out, just move somewhere! Sometimes, even if you can throw a combo, move out (instead of slipping or bob and weave), then come right back in and throw another punch or combo, you'll be surprised how often it will catch your opponent off guard. Kind of like the double jab.

-SHADOW BOX. Just like any other sport, muscle memory will serve you well, and if you're not practicing the movements on your own on off days (even 15-20 minutes without breaking a sweat), you're doing yourself a huge disservice. I've even started rolling back and forth while I'm alone at my desk to practice movement, It's helped a lot.

Anyway, sorry if this is too long and/or boring. I just thought it might be a good idea to see what other people who train have learned, and what has worked for them that may have been overlooked by others. I realize my list is pretty basic, but sometimes you just have these very simple realizations when you're training that make everything ""click"" and I was interested to hear some of yours.

1323413946.0,29,self.Boxing,n5zt2,PREVIEW: Amir Khan vs. Lamont Peterson,29,0,20,http://www.reddit.com/r/Boxing/comments/n5zt2/preview_amir_khan_vs_lamont_peterson/,"**When is it?** Dec 10, 2011 9:00 PM EST

**Where is it?** Convention Center - Washington, DC

**TV Network/Show** HBO - World Championship Boxing

**What's the big deal?** I'll be blunt: I'm a *huge* Khan fan. He's got the complete package of skill, speed, ring savvy, and heart. Everything that is great in a fighter can be found in Khan.

But what makes me a fan is he's got a flaw -- Amir Khan is *vulnerable*. As shown in his 2008 fight against Breidis Prescott, his chin is suspect. It is entirely possible that everything that makes Khan great could be neutralized with *one punch*.

Since 2008, this scenario his proven less likely. After recruiting Freddie Roach as his trainer, Khan's drastically improved his defense -- protecting his chin like it's the holy grail. Due to this, apart from a few rounds last year, Khan's been unstoppable.

Khan has stopped a parade of notable names since 2008: Marco Antonio Barrera, Andriy Kotelnik, Paul Malignaggi, Marcos Maidana, Zab Judah. He is now arguably the best Jr. Welterweight in the world -- and on the cusp of worldwide superstardom (he already *is* a superstar in Great Britain).

Which brings us to Lamont Peterson. He's no slouch himself, and is actually pretty good. He dominated Victor Cayo during his last fight, bounced back from an early knockdown to score a draw against Victor Ortiz, and gave Willy Blain his first defeat. In fact, Peterson's only defeat was against Timothy Bradley -- there is no shame in that.

Still, Peterson is no Khan -- but even though he's no Khan, Peterson will give Khan problems:

* Khan does his best work on the outside. However, Peterson has a 3"" reach advantage over Khan.

* Khan has been able to use his height advantage to dominate his opposition. Peterson only gives up 1"" in height.

* Khan wins fights due to high volume punches and speed. Peterson, though, is crafty and slick -- taking apart his opposition with surgical precision.

Peterson doesn't need to be convincing to win, he just needs to make the fight *close*. This is because the fight is taking place in Washington, DC -- Peterson's hometown. Hometown robberies happen -- and just because Khan is a unified champion, doesn't mean judges won't gift those belts to Peterson.

The only way Khan is going to leave D.C. with his belts is if he either knocks Peterson out, or obliterates him out of the water.

**What about the undercard?** I'm actually more excited about the undercard than the main event. It's a heavyweight bout. Seth Mitchell is battling Timur Ibragimov. 

We haven't had an exciting American heavyweight in years -- but we *might* have one in Seth Mitchell. The only way we'll know for certain, though, is if Mitchell is convincing against Ibragimov.

Mitchell has compiled an undefeated 23-0-1 record -- with eight of his last fights ending by KO. He's fast, puts together devastating combinations, and *mauls* his opposition. In short, he's the kind of heavyweight people like to watch.

Ibragimov, for his part, is a sturdy veteran who's only lost to Jean-Marc Mormeck, Tony Thompson, and Calvin Brock. If you're not an elite boxer, you're probably going to lose against Ibragimov. This is why he's such a good test against Mitchell.

So is Mitchell the real deal? I sure *hope* so. If Mitchell's not, he'll be Ibragimov's lunch.

**Predictions** Khan will need to close the deal. From the moment the bell rings, Khan will come roaring out of the corner through a high volume of punches -- and because of his high stamina, he's not going to let up. Peterson will attempt to neutralize Khan's volume through inside fighting, perhaps attempting to tag Khan's chin.

The difference maker though will be speed. Khan has that *much* more speed than Peterson -- this will result is a late stoppage for Khan. **TKO10 Khan**

As for Mitchell-Ibragimov, this fight will be about size. Though Ibragimov is taller than Mitchell, and has a longer reach, Mitchell weighs 20lbs more than Ibragimov. Unlike most heavyweights, Mitchell's mass is due to muscle -- not fat. 

Because of Mitchell's size and chiseled physique, it is unlikely Ibragimov will be able to keep Mitchell away. Ultimately, I believe Ibragimov will succumb to Mitchell's pressure. **KO3 Mitchell**

**Rating** B. Khan should win. Mitchell should win. The only thing that is questionable is whether Peterson could make this close -- enough for him to steal Khan's belts via hometown robbery.",,False,,t5_2qj0l,False,,,True,t3_n5zt2,http://www.reddit.com/r/Boxing/comments/n5zt2/preview_amir_khan_vs_lamont_peterson/,

I probably would have hit with the left hook but not with the follow right. Got 2 keep protected at all times but try 2 keep sportsmanship.

Eddie Chambers:
Victor Ortiz should of never dropped his guard... &amp; always know u are never friend while u in that ring!!

Click on the pic of him - 6th of 7 pics.  Bottom right.  He looks purty chunky there.  And look at his left eye too.  It looks a bit permanently swollen.  Damn.  Already starting to show the signs of the rigors of fights and having to starve himself to make weight.  He has a LOT of weight to loose to even get close to the 165 catchweight he's contracted for by 9/7/13.

*And* he's no longer going to have Freddie in his corner?  I wonder if he'll be w/Nacho Beristain or if he's going to have some cat he can tell what to do and end up coming in way under-trained.

1372022937.0,27,self.Boxing,1gxghk,Too big to fail,46,19,31,http://www.reddit.com/r/Boxing/comments/1gxghk/too_big_to_fail/,"**Boxing is dying**

A phrase similarly uttered and heard countless times by boxing fans both diehard and casual. But what does this soundbyte **really** mean? Ask the average 18-25 year old male, and they'll tell you that boxing is obsolete, a relic from an age with rules and values irrelevant to the modern man. People don't want to see standing eight counts, they want blood.

Or, you can ask a man like my father, who sneaked out of school to watch Foreman and Ali go toe-to-toe, or my boxing coach who went ten rounds with Floyd Mayweather. Do this and you'll hear that boxing isn't what it used to be. ""There's no fire"" they'll say, ""they aren't hungry anymore"".

And while I don't think boxing is dying, I think I can say with surety that it is surely changing, and I think last night showed that. I like to think that Malignaggi vs Broner was a historic fight, not in ppv sales or gate numbers, but instead in what the two men represented. 

                                                          
                                                    Talent vs Heart

                                                     Old vs New

You all know the score; Malignaggi came up hard against real champions like a 140lb Miguel Cotto. Plagued by hand injuries and a serious lack of power made him far from a betting favourite, yet somehow he found success. This kid from Brooklyn may have had more bark than bite, but he also had more heart than all the trees in Central Park put together. Though known as a trash-talker, Paulie has never shown anything but support for his fellow Brooklynites, and the local boxing scene. All in all, it's safe to say that he's a stand up guy.

His opponent across the ring last night represented the other side of the coin. Broner has everything a young fighter could dream of. Hand speed, punching power, a tremendous boxing IQ, a great team, three belts, and Golden Boy in his corner. In the ring he is a pleasure to watch, unfortunately Adrien doesn't live in Barclay's arena.  He gets in trouble with the law, he acts like a fool on t.v, and he makes the trash-talk too personal. He didn't have to fight the kind of opposition Paulie did, he has never been to the brink. Adrien Broner is no role model, but his fans don't know that. 

I could be overreacting, perhaps Boxing could use a facelift. We need to connect with the younger crowd, But that's what scares me. The way Broner disrespects his opponents, the flagrant fouls in the ring, the shout outs to Worldstarhiphop. I don't want this to be way boxing is, I don't want up and coming fighter's to act like Adrien Broner. I want to go back to the old way.

But the old way didn't prevail last night, heart wasn't enough. Out with the old and in with the new as they say.  Broner is here to stay. But he won't fight somebody like Thurman or Matthyse like we dream about, Golden Boy owns him and they won't jeopardize their cashcow, that way is here to stay as well. People don't take dangerous fights anymore, Manny and Floyd showed us that. Going life and death is a thing of the past, like the 15 rounder, or the American Heavyweight. This is the way things are done now, kids don’t want to grow up to be like Paulie, they want to be like Broner.  “You never got me down ray” words spoken by the great Jake LaMotta. A harkening to a day when it was more about how much you could take, than how much you could dish out. But heart isn't cool anymore, it doesn't get you laid, you can't instagram it.

Seth Mitchell was on the verge of being knocked out every time Banks let his hands go, but after the third round he just stopped. Why? He was so close to victory and he let it slip away. Was he tired? Maybe he injured his hands. I don't know why, but the Kronk fighter gave it away. It might be the conspiracy theorist in me, but perhaps we aren't so far removed form the days of Sonny Liston after all, where back room deals and shady happenings decide the future of a fighter who wants nothing more than to fight. Sure we have more commissions now, but just like Commissioner Gordon said: ""we get body armor, they get armor piercing rounds"". More and more fighters sign with Golden Boy and Al Haymon everyday, you can't win a decision against an Al Haymon fighter, and a loss in boxing can ruin a career. So why not sign with him, you have a family to feed. I wonder what Emmanuel Steward would have said to Banks.

I have a feeling the tectonics is boxing shifted visibly last night. I’ve been called a romantic, and I’d be hard pressed to argue. Maybe boxing has always been like this. But watching the fight yesterday made me feel as though guys like Seth Mitchell, Adrien Broner, and Al Haymon, are the future, and I’m sad for it.

1369204363.0,29,self.Boxing,1etjj9,How my first time watching a boxing fight was live at Boardwalk Hall - Lamont Peterson vs. Lucas Matthysse . One word: Amazing.,32,3,21,http://www.reddit.com/r/Boxing/comments/1etjj9/how_my_first_time_watching_a_boxing_fight_was/,"Hi everyone! a while ago I posted about what kind of things you guys recommend me to do at my first boxing fight watching it live. Needless to say, it was amazing. My family and I got there early, early enough for the Griffin-Williams fight. We had the 75$ seats which were pretty good, they were in the center, not too far not too close. It would have been a nicer if we were closer though. 

Then, we watched Haroon Khan vs Vincente Medellin, and I must say, for some reason I felt so fucking sad for Medellin because he got KO'ed in the first rounds within the first 50 seconds or so. I just felt so sad for him I started cheering for him to get up and stuff, I have no idea why, I have no connection to the fighter and he wasn't my favorite, I just felt bad for the dude. I also felt disgusted and enraged at Haroon Khan for picking on such a little guy, but yeah I understand they're both the same weight and he's a prospect so he needed this fight, whatever. Anyway, then I watched Porter and LoGreco go at it, my dad said he liked how Porter move, very slick, to which I agreed. I thought LoGreco was much better than what he fought, but hey, who knows.

By now, some guy from Showtime comes to us and says they need to fill the seats in the first rows, so he offers us seats really close to ringside so we all take it. Watching the Alexander Purdy fight wasn't that cool, I could have given a less of a shit about Alexander, all I was waiting for was for the entry of my fellow countryman, Lucas the Machine Matthysse. 

So it's about that time of the main event, and before he enters with the camera and stuff, I see a little boxer a little far away next to the bleachers with his trainers, and my mom goes like: That's Lucas!!! so I go with my argentinean flag and say Lucas, you'll KO him (Peterson) in 10 let's go baby!!!(all in Spanish) and he points his glove at me and his trainer gives me a thumbs up. I felt like dying. It was awesome. So he makes his way in, and the Showtime cameras are all on me because I have this Argentinean flag and I am suddenly on TV! i was on showtime right after they announce ""Lucas La Maquina Argentina Matthysse"". so that was really cool. After Lucas TKO's LP, I go right to the ringside i'm like 10 steps away from this dude, and Lucas comes to the cheering Argentinean crowd and I SHOOK HANDS WITH HIM!!! I got to touch Matthysse's back and I was like: Man you did a great job! Let's get Garcia next! and he goes like: Yeah, hopefully if they make it happen. Then, my mom goes like you're the champion Lucas! and he just goes ahead and hugs her!!!! like a full on hug!!! she teared up a little bit, as she was wearing this argentinean jersey. 

Then I did something pretty stupid, which I kinda regret. Because of my super excitement, I decide to start yelling where's Garcia at? and my dad pointed him out. With all my strength, I yell: YO, GARCIA. And I swear to god, he looks back at me and I go like: YOU'RE NEXT and I point at Lucas while doing the ""you're dead"" hand sign (thumb cutting my neck). Garcia gave me a super frightening look and then he mumbled something to his dad, and now both Angel and Danny were looking at me with some black guy next to them. I became completely horrified cuz I thought they were going to whoop my ass and just stab me right there and then I dont' know why I thought that.But my dad later pointed out that i should have chilled out and just not say that at all, to which I agreed. 

Last, I saw Peter, Paulie Malignaggi's cornerman holding the belt, and I went like: Yo Peter! Broner's next baby, trust me on this one! to which he started laughing. He seemed like a nice guy, I like him. I also like Paulie better than Broner, but I doubt he'll beat him.

Anyway, that's all I gotta say about that. Thanks everyone",,False,,t5_2qj0l,False,,,True,t3_1etjj9,http://www.reddit.com/r/Boxing/comments/1etjj9/how_my_first_time_watching_a_boxing_fight_was/,

## Keith Thurman vs. Jan Zaveck
***Round 1:*** Both fighters are feeling each other out. Thurman's purposely hitting the guard to see if it holds — it does. Zaveck hits Thurman with an overhand, but Thurman hits back. Zaveck's eye begins to swell. 1-2 by 
Zaveck gets in. Thurman then catches Zaveck when he tries a right hook. This is a close round, but Thurman takes it slightly.

10-9 Thurman

***Round 2:*** Thurman pumping the jab effectively. Then Zaveck rushes Thurman, and attempts to pound him in the corner. Zaveck doing well with pressure. But now both of these guys are exchanging. Zaveck is now countering Thurman's hooks. Clearly, he's able to absorb more punishment than Thurman's previous opponents. Thurman is being workmanlike in his approach and is winning this with his jab.

10-9 Thurman, 20-18 Thurman

***Round 3:*** Thurman's clearly found that Zaveck doesn't like the outside. So he's hitting him with jabs and crosses. Zaveck is biding his time, waiting for his chance. But now Thurman's delivered body shots that are hurting Zaveck. Nice adjustment! Zaveck attempts to move Thurman to the ropes and crowd him, but Thurman moves out of the way and continues to body work.

10-9 Thurman, 30-27 Thurman

***Round 4:*** Thurman continues to target the body. Zaveck's got a whole lot of heart. But Zaveck every so often crowds Thurman and tries to bully him by the ropes. Now Thurman is loading up with combos that first go to the body, then follow up to the head. Flashy right hook by Thurman rocks back Zaveck. Zaveck is still up, and he's still trying to win.

10-9 Thurman, 40-36 Thurman

***Round 5:*** Man, I'm not sure if Zaveck can do anything any more. I mean, he's up. He's trying. Body Thurman's body combos are clearly taking their toll. Zaveck is slowing down.

10-9 Thurman, 50-45 Thurman

***Round 6:*** Good counter left by Zaveck momentarily knocks Thurman off-balance. This seems to encourage him with some tremendous left hooks. Well, looks like the old man still has fight in him! Zaveck is now moving forward, looking to time Thurman. Zaveck's now not letting up — even though Thurman knocked his mouthpiece out. The action is paused since *both* their mouthpieces came out. When it resumes, both trade.

10-9 Zaveck, 59-55 Thurman

***Round 7:*** Hard right hook by connects cleanly on Thurman! Thurman seems unhurt and continues to throw at Zaveck. Thurman then rocks Zaveck with a left! He follows this up with a body shot and uppercut! Zaveck not letting up, though! He's continuing with his hard right hook! He's really giving Thurman a fight!

10-9 Zaveck, 68-65 Thurman

***Round 8:*** Looks like both men are tired. Thurman has less pepper in his shots, while Zaveck's spit out his mouthpiece to bide time. Zaveck is is really coming forward now. He's moving Thurman to the ropes, and roughing him up. Thurman is getting in a few shots, and I don't want to make it seems like he doesn't have an argument, but I like how Zaveck continues his aggression.

10-9 Zaveck, 77-75 Thurman

***Round 9:*** Thurman's now having to box like he's never boxed before. Zaveck might last the distance. As it is, he's bullying himself in. Uppercuts by Thurman are really impressing now. This gives Zaveck something to think about. But Zaveck just barely misses an overhand right. Thurman takes advantage by responding with an uppercut.

10-9 Thurman, 87-84 Thurman

***Round 10:*** Zaveck's now going to the body. He's also continuing to find success with the overhand right. Thurman's now countering him with left body shots. Thurman's hooks now causing Zaveck to stumble! His left eye is opening up! Thurman tries again with the hook, but Zaveck counters him at the bell!

10-9 Thurman, 97-93 Thurman

***Round 11:*** Zaveck is really tentative this round. He's neither bullying Thurman, nor engaging him. Thurman takes advantage with body shot combos. Finally, in close, Zaveck goes to the body, but there's no pepper on them. Uppercut by Thurman looks falshy, but they were glancing. Thurman won this on the jab.

10-9 Thurman, 107-102 Thurman

***Round 12:*** Zaveck now back to pressuring, but he's still not as aggressive as in the previous round. Zaveck gets in a left hook, while Thurman works the double jab. Zaveck lands a looping left, but Thurman responds with the right. Zaveck showing heart. He's not letting Zaveck off the hook. Overhand right lands on Thurman cleanly, but I still give this to Thurman.

10-9 Thurman, 117-111 Thurman

**Official Results** Scores: 120-108, 120-108, 120-108. Thurman UD Zaveck.

## Bernard Hopkins vs. Tavoris Cloud

***Round 1:*** Doesn't look like Cloud plans to overpower Dawson. Dawson' so far, is able to do what he's often done in his other fights. The fans are booing — but have they ever seen Hopkins fight? Hopkins right now, is using excellent defense to befuddle Cloud, and is able to sneak in some punches. Let's see if Hopkins is able to repeat this with the next rounds.

10-9 Hopkins

***Round 2:*** Love Hopkins defense. He knows just the distance for where to walk in. Cloud tries to punch, but it's all shoulders. Hopkins moves Cloud to the ropes, and sneaks in a shot. Cloud responds with a body shot that draws ""ooohs"" from the audience. Hopkins then forces Cloud to miss, and then makes Cloud pay. Closer round, but still Hopkins for me.

10-9 Hopkins, 20-18 Hopkins

***Round 3:*** Hopkins now attempting to make this an inside fight, but Cloud not letting him. He's preferring the distance. Hopkins now pumping the jab, which follows up with the right. Cloud trying with body shots, but Hopkins just sophicates them, then follows with a hook to the head. Good exchange at the bell.

10-9 Hopkins, 30-27 Hopkins

***Round 4:*** Cloud tries with a right to the head, which gives Hopkins the opportunity to counter with his own. Hopkins gets off a double jab then follows it with a right! Cloud tries for a hook to the head, but this gets blocked by Hopkins — which prompts Hopkins to stick out his tongue. Cloud tries but he's going against a master!

10-9 Hopkins, 40-36 Hopkins

***Round 5:*** Cloud tried to corner Hopkins, but ends up eating a right for his efforts. Cloud just isn't able to boss Hopkins around. Hopkins then presses to Cloud's body. Cloud responds with his own body shots. These Hopkins jabs are finding their target. And while Cloud attempts to throw hooks, he's coming up with air. He's hitting Hopkins every now and then, but Hopkins is disrupting his timing.

10-9 Hopkins, 50-45 Hopkins

***Round 6:*** Hopkins maneuvers Cloud to the ropes, then gets off a left-right hook combo. Cloud is dialing up the aggression. Looks like a cut has opened on his eyelid! Oh man! Cloud's now get a sense of desperation. The ref is getting the doctor to look at the cut! It's ugly! He's calling it an accidental headbutt. Cloud now amping up the volume! Hopkins getting a few combos! I almost had this for Cloud, but I think Hopkins is stealing the round!

10-9 Hopkins, 60-54 Hopkins

***Round 7:*** Good rights by Cloud ding Hopkins body. He then corners Hopkins. But now Hopkins is now pouring it on with combos — taunting Cloud! Hopkins is countering Cloud whenever Cloud tries a shot! Love this round!

10-9 Hopkins, 70-63 Hopkins

***Round 8:*** So far, Cloud doing well in the opening minute with jabs. Hopkins trying to counter, but Cloud's caught him. Cloud now gets off a hook on the inside. Hopkins then responds with his own body shots. Hard right hand stuns Hopkins! Hopkins for the first time doesn't look good! But he's still fighting! He's still in this fight!

10-9 Cloud, 79-73 Hopkins

***Round 9:*** A right by Cloud just connects with Hopkins. But Hopkins responds with two to the body. A hook by Hopkins gets in. Cloud tries to counter, but misses — wildly. Hopkins now back to moving, disrupting Cloud's rhythm. Hopkins now getting off combos that get the crowd's attention. Hopkins is back in the game!

10-9 Hopkins, 89-82 Hopkins

***Round 10:*** Left-right catches Cloud at the center of the ring. Hopkins follows this again with a combo to the head! Love how Hopkins just makes himself unpredictable. Cloud's trying again with the jab, but he's not catching Hopkins. Hopkins is continuously mystifying Cloud!

10-9 Hopkins, 99-91 Hopkins

***Round 11:*** Hopkins just knows how to pop the jab in an unpredictable manner. Cloud then tries to corner Hopkins at the ropes, but Hopkins then replies with fantastic inside work! We're watching a true master at work!  Just as there's a lull, Hopkins goes with a left-right-left forward! That was almost a Wing Chun chain punch! Cloud's hooks just aren't finding their target!

10-9 Hopkins, 109-100 Hopkins

***Round 12:*** Left-right by Hopkins thuds at the center of the ring! Cloud tries to go to the body, but Hopkins then launches an uppercut. Now Cloud has cuts on the left and right eye! Hopkins is just whipping Cloud's ass! What a performance by Hopkins!

10-9 Hopkins, 119-109 Hopkins

I saw what's wrong with boxing. It's really simple. In boxing, there is WAY WAY WAY WAY too much emphasis on the unbeaten record. Look at these guys fighting in UFC and you can see with the exception of Anderson Silva (the Floyd Mayweather of MMA as far as I saw, if you disagree know that I don't know dick about MMA) these guys got losses, still get big fights. 

In boxing we are robbed of great fights because guys want to protect their records (Canelo, Mayweather). The record does not make the fight!

###Andre Berto 28(22)-2 vs Jesus Soto Karass 27(17)-8-3
### Pre-fight rating: ★ ★ ★ ★ ★
### vacant NABF welterweight title
### 12 Rounds

This fight is as much about Virgil Hunter as it is about Andre Berto. If Berto wins here and does so in a way that has us forget about his directionless fighting in the past few years we could be hailing Virgil Hunter as a real fight whisperer. And that’s not because he whispers in the corner. This is Berto’s first fight with new trainer Virgil Hunter. Hunter, also the trainer of pound-for-pound contender Andre Ward and Amir Khan, has his work cut-out for him. In Berto’s last fight, he came out using the half-guard defense against Robert Guerrero who mauled him and bulldozed his way right through it. The result was Berto dropped twice in the first 2 rounds and losing a decision. Once again, Berto was left in the dark while the victor went on to a career payday against Floyd Mayweather Jr. 

Berto at one point was being promoted as a tiny Tyson. He has one of the most vicious uppercuts in boxing right now. When he lands that punch, it is a thing of beauty. Not for it’s smoothness, that title belongs to Devon Alexander, but rather because of the ferocity behind it. Berto, like Gamboa, also carries a lot of bulk muscle to the ring which may be cause of his poor stamina. 

Jesus Soto Karass has the distinction of being one of the best pound-for-pound fighters out there with an ugly record. Karass, originally from Mexico, has earned his shot. He took a beating from Marcos Maidana in one of the uglier fights of recent memory. At the time of the stoppage, it could be argued that it was called a little too early. His last fight out was against Selcuk Aydin, 23-1 at the time. That was on the undercard of Matthysse-Dallas Jr card this past January.. Karass is an adaptable fighter who’s style varies from fight to fight. He’s not the most technical, but he does what he needs to win. He’s got losses to Maidana, Gabriel Rosado (Karass moved up to 154 for the fight), Mike Jones twice, Alfonso Gomez, and Yuri Foreman. 
Expect to see a slugfest. Both fighters have been in highly competitive and entertaining brawls. Berto with both Ortiz and Guerrero and Karass with Maidana. 

Here’s an interesting statistic that I got from @shostats: Berto’s recent opponents landed 42% of power punches, while Soto Karass’ opponents landed 45% of their power shots. Berto connects at 43.5% compared to 32.4% for Karass when they’re throwing power punches. Berto throws on average 43.1 punches while Karass throws 94.7. Berto has never been stopped before. He’s been dropped plenty of times including twice against Guerrero, twice against Ortiz, and once against Cosme Rivera. Karass has been stopped twice by Maidana and Rosado. In my research, Maidana is the only one on record to have dropped him. I don’t expect a knockout here. It’s certainly possible given their records, but unlikely their hearts we’ve seen in the past.

The welterweight division is stacked. Here are the notable welterweights: Floyd Mayweather Jr, Juan Manuel Marquez, Manny Pacquiao*, Timothy Bradley*, Devon Alexander, Adrien Broner, Robert Guerrero, Amir Khan, Kell Brook, Marcos Maidana, Luis Carlos Abregu*, Keith Thurman, Jessie Vargas*, Paulie Malignaggi, Josesito Lopez, Shane Mosley, Frankie Gavin, and Vyacheslav Senchenko.

*Top Rank fighters

*My prediction: Berto TKO9*

### Keith Thurman 20(18)-0 vs Diego Gabriel Chaves 22(18)-0
### Pre-fight rating: ★ ★ ★ 
### interim WBA World welterweight title
### 12 Rounds

Keith “One Time” Thurman is the reigning prospect of the year. In March he fought Jan Zaveck who previously was stopped by Andre Berto due to swelling. He won a 12 round decision where all three judges scorecards ruled it 12 rounds to none. In the fight, Thurman did not knock Zaveck down or even appear to hurt him. He may not have lost a round on the judges scorecards, but he certainly had to work to earn them. Zaveck was a trick fighter that night and exposed the inexperience of the 24 year old power punching prodigy. Was it enough to create a gameplan to beat Keith Thurman? Unlikely. 

On the other side however, is Diego Gabriel Chaves. I truly believe this to be a trap fight. Chaves is 27 years old from San Miguel, Buenos Aires, Argentina. These Argentines are rugged and recently on a roll with Sergio Martinez, Lucas Matthysse, Marcos Maidana, and Luis Carlos Abregu leading the way. His career as an amateur was not particularly outstanding. He was shut out in one fight against Demetrius Andrade 22-0. It appears that his style has adjusted well since turning pro. This is going to be his second fight outside of Argentina and only the first time outside his homeland since 2010. He has not gone 12 rounds since 2011, with every fight since then ending in an early stoppage in his favor. He’s been dropped twice in his career. The first time was in his 10th fight. He was knocked down in the second fight and went on to win a unanimous decision.  In 2011 he was also dropped and went on to win a unanimous decision as well. 

Thurman should be favored in this fight. You gotta think Golden Boy wouldn’t put the prospect of the year in with a fighter they know could derail everything… but Chaves has a similar record with the same amount of KO’s. Thurman has steadily been improving with each fight and possess raw power we’ve seen, but in his last fight against a tough welterweight he couldn’t finish the show. 

*My prediction: Thurman UD*

***

###Omar Figueroa Jr. 21(17)-0-1 vs Nihito Arakawa 24(16)-2-1
###Pre-fight rating: ★ ★ ★ ★
###interim WBC lightweight title
###12 Rounds

Omar Figueroa Jr is a young, good-looking kid coming off a 1st round KO over previously undefeated Abner Cotto. His combination of skill and power, along with being managed by Al Haymon may take Figueroa to the top of the lightweight division. Arakawa has fought outside of Japan once and it was a loss where the referee stopped the fight due to a cut. Expect Figueroa to look spectacular tonight. 

*My prediction: Figueroa KO3*

Here's some basic facts about Guerrero that are worth considering:

* Multi-division world titlist at featherweight, super featherweight, lightweight, and welterweight
* Wins over:

    * Andre Berto
    * Selcuk Aydin
    * Michael Katsidis
    * Joel Casamayor
    * Spend Abazi
    * Malcolm Klassen
* Can adjust his style from fight to fight, showing range from pure boxing to brawling
* Has power that carries over to welterweight
* Shows willingness to get a win at all costs
* Chin's been tested and found durable

There's one other fact many fans may not want to admit: out of all welterweights, Guerrero is the one most deserving of a shot against Mayweather.

1316696688.0,28,self.Boxing,knuva,Just wanted to share some (9)experiences/things I've learned from my latest sparring match. ,32,4,31,http://www.reddit.com/r/Boxing/comments/knuva/just_wanted_to_share_some_9experiencesthings_ive/,"Well, I just had a ""placement"" match today with one of our newest pro fighters. We were scheduled for 3 rounds to determine if I'm ready for a ""smokers"" tournament coming up. Kaicho (president of my boxing gym) hasn't made an official decision, but I ""won"" by stoppage. 2:20 of the second. That's not what this post is about though, as much as I'd love to go on and on about how I should have gotten my ass kicked. 

Well in no particular order, these are some of the things I've reaffirmed and find time and time again to be truest. 

1) Cardio. Mother fucking never get enough of it cardio. Don't just do sprints, or HIIT, or long distance. You need to hit up all 3 forms of energy production (ATP/CP, Non-ox Glycosis, Ox Glycosis.) I took some real body shots today, by (arguably) the strongest hitter in my gym. The road under my feet was plenty this time around, and I was able to get my wind back.

2) Head movement motherfuckers, but with your guard up. I don't care if you can dodge like RJ Jr. or FM Jr. or Sweat Pea or Ali. I was moving around like a fiend, slipping left and right, and then BAM, I got rocked. My slip bag helped A LOT though. 

3) Distance and timing. After reviewing a lot of great fighters, and being told by a few, distance and timing are more important than me being able to throw millions of punches with power. I focused my training on these two traits, and tonight I was a completely different fighter. My footwork has always been great, but today, I turned into a beast. 

4) My gas mask training doesn't simulate HAT. The science has proved that for a while. But anyone try Tabata's in mask, and keeping the mask on to recover after will know that the mental game is something fierce. I got rocked twice tonight, and KNEW that I was okay, and could recover. Your mentality, your heart, needs training just like your body. 

5) Tabata's are KILLER, and great if you can accomplish them. Other forms of HIIT is great, and 3-5 miles is great. You can't have just one form of cardio though. You need to vary it; to become more efficient in all three means that you're able to last, recover, and burst like a beast. 

6) Weights are great. Look up (not to endorse) but Ross Enamait, Strong Lifts, Starter Strength, or Convict Conditioning. Hell CrossFit wouldn't hurt either. Pick your poison and integrate it as your General Physical Preparation. 

7) Recovery and diet is very important too. Just like any physical activity, you need to rest. If you can't afford massages, or don't have a willing SO, look into foam rolling. It's made a huge difference in my performance. Diet wise, I've learned a lot studying for my personal training classes, but the tl;dr version is eat healthy and maintain your calories and nutrients. 

8) Don't practice stupid fucking things you see on t.v. or in movies. My opponent tried a bolo today, and I capitalized on it. I tried raising my hands after getting rocked and got hit to the body. Stupid fucking bullshit leads to stupid fucking bullshit. 

9) Cardio. Learn to love it, don't get enough of it, and you must always want more of it. Track your times, work more than just your legs. Figure out how to breathe, and break through the wall. 

Anyway, sorry for the rant. Best of luck to everyone out there. If you have any S&amp;C questions I at least know the right direction to get you going in. Train hard everyone!!!

1316439368.0,25,self.Boxing,kkgf1,Mayweather - Ortiz: Aftermath,41,16,71,http://www.reddit.com/r/Boxing/comments/kkgf1/mayweather_ortiz_aftermath/,"	
	“Worst Fight Ever.”  “Boxing is dead.”  “I’ll never buy a PPV again.”

But our subreddit, for better or for worse, has never been so active.  And our subscriber count is rising steadily.  
Love him or hate him, Mayweather puts asses in seats, eyes on screens, and dollars in the bank.	

On Sept. 17th, boxing’s former undisputed pound-for-pound king returned to the ring and reclaimed a relinquished welterweight title in not-undisputed fashion.  Following a point deduction by the ever ceremonious referee, Joe Cortez, for intentional headbutting, Victor Ortiz walked from his neutral corner at Cortez’s request, and began to initiate a conversation with Mayweather.  With a gestured huddle, and gently touched gloves, Ortiz began to apologize to Mayweather.  Playing along, Mayweather held out both hands in an amicable gesture, only to quickly nail Ortiz with a left-hook while Cortez was literally turned away from the action, once again solidifying the Hall-of-Fame merits of the often critiqued third man.  Cortez turned around just in time to see Mayweather unload his laser-like right hand directly into Ortiz’s confused, almost innocent face.  Cortez, having been forced to pay attention to the events unfolding immediately in front of him, began the 10-count, which Ortiz was unable to answer.

Since then, emotions have run high.  With many of the sports casual fans divided in their approval of the fight’s ending, some have reiterated the phrase we hear after nearly every controversial PPV or high profile boxing event:  “This is the nail in the coffin of boxing!”  Needless to say, there’s a lot to discuss.

So, let’s begin with the particulars of the knockout.  After the point deduction, Cortez brought the fighters together, and in his slurred speech and feeble hand gestures, he insinuated the the fighters might want to begin fighting again, if they feel so inclined, with a quiet “Let’s go,” and a gentle wave of his hands.  It is at this point, when the fighters are removed from the neutral corners and instructed to fight again, that they are once again free to engage in contact.  In this light, it is almost impossible to argue the legality of Mayweather’s finishing blows.  What is not impossible to argue against is the nature with which Cortez commanded the fight.  In a relatively cut-and-dry scenario in boxing, Joe Cortez completely lost control with indecisive behavior and unclear communication.

Outside of legitimacy, we should look at the behavior surrounding the knockout.  It is this boxing fan’s opinion that Mayweather’s behavior, while unsurprisingly reprehensible in terms of class, does not deserve the scorn with which it’s been met by many boxing fans (or ex-fans, if message board comments are to be believed).  

While we always like a competitive fight, we must remember that boxing matches are multifaceted in terms of the necessary skillsets required to compete.  We often compare fighters in terms of power and speed, defense and offense, and overall heart, but we sometimes forget the crucial significance of mental sharpness and toughness.  I love the quote by Jack Dempsey, “All the time he was thinking, I was hitting him,” but it belies the degree to which mentality shapes a fight’s outcome and a fighter’s success.  In the ring, Mayweather is as sharp and tough as they come.  And if there was one thing we were concerned about with Victor Ortiz ever since his surrender to Maidana, it was his mental toughness.

Ortiz' greatest weakness as a fighter was his callow, inexperienced nature. Just as in any sport, you need to exploit your opponent's weakness.  And Mayweather was fully within his right to do so.  When Lennox Lewis fought against Oliver McCall in order to regain his title, Oliver McCall began to have a mental breakdown in the ring, often dropping his hands, turning away, and openly crying, but Lennox Lewis did not stop throwing punches.  And this didn’t surprise anyone!  It was the middle of a championship boxing match!  Why should he hold back?

Think about it this way: if Mayweather hadn't knocked out Ortiz, but instead only threw the first punch, how would the boxing community look at it? I'll tell you exactly how they'd look at it. ""Protect yourself at all times!  Ortiz shouldn’t have been so stupid!""

How do I know this? Because it's exactly what happened to Mosley when he fought Mayweather. The ref broke up a clinch, and Shane Mosley began gabbin' at Mayweather, and Mayweather began gabbin' back. Mosley began to respond in turn and let his guard down for a split second, giving Mayweather all the time he needed to stuff a right hand in Mosley’s face.

Did he do this because he's a jerk? Yeah, maybe a bit. But the real reason he did this is because it is boxing. Boxing, unlike other sports, relies on its barbarism and brutality just as much as its finesse and skill. The name of the game is ""hit and not get hit."" It's ""get off first."" And, unfortunately for Ortiz, it's ""Protect yourself at all times, and come out fighting.""  

It was inexperience that felled Ortiz as much as it was Mayweather’s right hand.

As for the future health of boxing, the aftermath hasn’t left me too concerned.  In preparation for this fight, I watched a handful of old Mayweather fights and eventually got around to his HBO Countdown with Arturo Gatti.  In the episode, many writers and experts commented on how Floyd Mayweather’s “bad boy” persona is working against him, limiting him from being the true, breakout star that his skills would enable him to be.  If only they could see him now. (They can.)

Mayweather, having gone against the advice of Bob Arum and nearly every other adviser/promoter/friend in boxing, has turned his villain status into an unstoppable force of PPV sales, having regularly sold to millions of households since his appearance against the unanimaously loved Oscar De la Hoya.  Since then, he’s been brash, arrogant, and downright rude in all pre-fight buildup, and it has always delivered.  This time it was no different.

So when casual sports fans and boxing fans alike declare their hatred for Mayweather, they, perhaps unknowingly, continue to act as a constant in a formula that has been consistently working in Mayweather’s favor.  They hate him.  Their families probably hate him, too.  And they’ll all be there, whether they like it or not, to see the next guy attempt to knock him off his tower.

Looking at the Victor Ortiz, aside from the headbutt and gullibility, he gave as good an account of himself as anyone else who has stepped in the ring with Mayweather recently.  And afterwards, he showed that he can look at a loss as just that, a loss.  Not the end of a career.  His smile, tinged with disappointment after the fight, showed us his spirits were still high after such a high profile loss, a far cry from the behavior he displayed after the Maidana debacle.  In the end he can at least hold his head high knowing that he was outsmarted, but not outfought.  

Ortiz will likely hold a title again in the near future.  Would anyone be stupid enough to say no to Berto-Ortiz II for Berto’s new belt? 

With regards to the decrees of “Worst Fight Ever,” and “Boxing’s Ultimate Failure,” I can only remark that, for the first time in years, the a fight’s outcome as set ablaze the sports community.  Hearkening back to Tyson-Holyfield II, the infamous “Bite Fight,” everyone remotely interested in boxing are discussing the seemingly controversial nature of the fight’s conclusion.  And with more people talking, there will be more people hating Mayweather.  And with more people hating Mayweather, there will be that many more people tuning in to see the fight that we thought couldn’t possibly get any bigger.  


Let’s hope Pacquiao protects himself.

12 Rounds

Marcos Rene Maidana 33(30)-3 vs. Josesito Lopez 30(18)-5-1

There isn't much to be said about these guys other than the fact that they leave it all in the ring. They aren't savvy ring generals like Erislandy Lara who will fight before them. They are guys that go to the center and will out a victory using grit and heart. They have both been down in fights. Lopez has 1 loss out of his 5 that was by way of TKO. Maidana has lost 3 times in his career. His loss to Devon Alexander can be argued as the only legitimate loss on his record. Kotelnik was a fight in German that was a split decison. Khan managed to get by with the help of Joe Cortez and al dente legs. Maidana has recently begun taking boxing lessons and flaunted them early in the Soto Kartass fight. That fight was also on pace to have the lowest score total in a 12 round fight ever, given the deductions. Andrew Golota was quoted as saying, ""Damn, these are some dirty fucking fighters.""

All in all, expect the winner of this fight to become the most avoided fighter in the welterweight division next to Keith Thurman. Which means the winner of this fight will get Andre Berto in early 2013. 

My prediction: Maidana TKO 9



**Prefight Rating:** 3 STARS
interim WBA World light middleweight title
12 Rounds

Erislandy Lara 17(11)-1-2 vs. Alfredo Angulo 22(18)-2

Erislandy should very well be an undefeated fighter. He's got pure talent that seems to be in the water of Guantanamo, Cuba. Lara's lone loss may well have been robbery of the century as Donald Givens, Hilton Whitaker III, and Al Bennett are still at large and yet to be detained. 

That doesn't explain Lara's 2 draws so I'll attempt to do that. Lara is a defense first fighter who fights off the back foot and would rather be a ring general than take a risk. Thus, there tend to be a lot of close rounds in his fights. I believe that Angulo might be a style nightmare for him. Angulo's head down come forward style may get outclassed by his slick defense, but will that be enough to win round? A few clean counters might not be enough to sway judges who like action and activity. This fight will be a huge test for Lara to determine if he really is an elite fighter at 154. This has been a good year for Cubans with Rigondeaux schooling Donaire and Yaisel Puig electrifying baseball. Expect a boring fight. It's unlikely Lara will give in to Angulo's war style. Angulo must be able to avoid clean counters and not get thrown off by Lara's jab on his way in. Angulo's 2 losses are to Kermit Cintron (a fairly close fight, but he clearly lost) and to James ""Houdini"" Kirkland. The first round against Kirkland was an absolute heart-pounding thriller and I predict we won't be seeing that tonight. Not with Virgil Hunter in Angulo's corner. 

My prediction: Lara UD

Jermell Charlo 20(10)-0 vs. Demetrius Hopkins 33(13)20-1

Charlo is a twin and to be honest I don't know which one I'm talking about. I do know that I've seen them both fight and they are both pretty good. They have a ways to go, but the future is bright. Should he get past Hopkins. If the name of Hopkins sounds familar it's because he's the newphew of Bernard, the current 75 year old light heavyweight titlist. 

Expect both fighters to fight a disciplined boxing match.

My prediction: Charlo by UD.

**Fight Stream:**

**Round by Round coverage **

**Charlo vs Hopkins**

**Round 1** 

Hopkins with Naazim Richardson in his corner, here we go. Charlo lands a good straight right, the first clean landed shot od the fight   Hopkins lands a combo. charlo backing Hopkins up, looking to land his jab . good 1-2 for Charlo. Charlo needs to avoid moving back in a straight line.

Charlo 10-9

**Round 2**

Charlo is beginning to land the jab. Charlo beginning to use distance. The crowd is booing what the fuck. Charlo amping up the attack, don't get reckless. Hopkins is not pushing the action and giving away rounds.

Charlo 10-9

**Round 3**

Slow round, Hopkins landed a few clean shots. Charlo is very predictable, throwing a jab jab straight like Pacquiao.  

Hopkins 10-9

**Round 4** 

Charlo is not accurate enough to win rounds decisively. 

Hopkins 10-9

**Round 5** 

more action in this round. Hopkins cant miss his overhand right. 

Charlo 10-9

**Round 6** 

Hopkins countered with a huge right on the chin. Charlo is landing, but not cleanly. The Hopkins family has the overhand straight right trademarked. Charlo's offense is not varied enough for the experienced Hopkins. 

Hopkins 10-9

**Round 7**

Charlo's straight line movement is allowing for Hopkins to land his right far too often.

Charlo 10-9

**Round 8** 

Neither is establishing themselves in the fight. Hopkins is winning this fight with that counter right  

Hopkins 10-9

**Round 9**

it's heating up with both taking some. Hopkins landed a few nice shots at the end, but Charlo seemed in control.

Charlo 10-9

**Round 10**

Charlo is landing shots and avoiding the counter. Charlo has finally established a rhythm. 

Charlo 10-9

**Round 11**

Quiet round through 1st two minutes with Charlo landing more significant punches. Hopkins has inherited from his uncle the ability to make a guy look bad through slick defense. 

Charlo 10-9

**Round 12** 

Charlo turns it on and turns it into a fight he's more comfortable with, while getting tagged a bit. Still, Charlo was more active and probably pulls out a UD. 

Charlo 10-9 117-111

Charlo wins UD 115-113x3

It opened at
WILL GO 10 FULL ROUNDS **+165**
WON'T GO 10 FULL ROUNDS **-210**


I thought this was freaking crazy, so I put $100 on Will go because I know for sure it will go the distance.


Checked yesterday and the current lines are
WILL GO 10 FULL ROUNDS **-350**
WON'T GO 10 FULL ROUNDS **+250**


It completely flipped big time.  Now this is either due to a huge error on MGM Grand's part, or somehow, they reallllly thought someone would get knocked out and someone much smarter put a lot of money on it moving the line. I've never seen a line move that much over 3 days so I am thinking it was a very big mistake.  


So I put $75 on WON'T Go 10 Full rounds.  This will allow me to win $90 no matter the outcome(except for DQ/NC then I get all my money back).


I anticipate the sports book is going to lose a lotttt of money on this since they created the greatest Arbitrage and I am sure some professional gamblers caught it when it was +165


I've never seen this happen.  I just wish I put more money on the +165

1360352671.0,24,self.Boxing,185d9l,What can we ACTUALLY do to decrease controversy in boxing? Some real proposals for common problems.,28,4,22,http://www.reddit.com/r/Boxing/comments/185d9l/what_can_we_actually_do_to_decrease_controversy/,"Whenever a controversy happens in boxing, someone comes along and says, “Something needs to change in boxing.” Yet, few people have come along with *practical* solutions other than saying that boxing needs an equivalent of a UFC like there is in MMA. 

But having a UFC in boxing is worthless since that organization is a regional (yet popular) sanctioning organization. 

Boxing is an international sport with deep international talent. World champions are produced from Brooklyn, NY to Kakogawa, Japan, to [Bukom, Ghana](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-21180321). It is one of the most followed international sports on the globe. Surely, there is *another* way to accommodate its global talent *and* its global fanbase while addressing global matters of controversy.

This post will address ideas I have regarding controversy. But first, what do people actually mean when they say that a fight is controversial? Usually, it’s the following:

* **There is disagreement on the results.** Example: every Pacquiao-Marquez fight except IV.
* **The officials displayed gross incompetence.** Example: Mares-Agbeko I. In this fight, Mares continuously gave Agbeko low blows over the course of 12 rounds, with referee Russell Mora actually starting a count when one of those low blows forced Agbeko to the canvas.
* **There’s clear organized corruption.** Example: Williams-Botha. In this fight, Williams was dominating the rounds until he essentially lost his legs. Botha was nearing a KO when the number of rounds “mysteriously” changed from 12 to 10. 

**Disagreement on Results**

Regarding disagreement of results, if the fight doesn’t end by KO, judging comes down to an official’s subjective opinion. Sometimes a fight is close, sometimes it looks like a fighter has won by a wide margin, but when you leave the results in the hands of judges, anything can happen. 

So why don’t we scrap the current judging system? Believe me, others have tried.

Due to Roy Jones Jr.‘s infamous loss in the 1988 Olympics, AIBA already tried switching to computerized scoring. The result was fights with little fan appeal, with several athletes who would have considered a career in boxing no longer attracted to the sport. 

Even worse, even though scoring was computerized, anyone who saw Olympic boxing between 1988-1012 could tell you that controversial scoring *still* continued. For the 2016 Olympics, [AIBA is now switching to the 10-point scoring system used in the pros](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/huff-wires/20120809/oly-box-aiba-scoring-system/).

Clearly, the current system used in the pros is better than other proposed — and implemented systems. So how can we make the current system better?

Retired referee Joe Cortez has a simple solution: [elevate the judges from ringside allowing them a clearer view of what’s happening during the fight](http://ringtv.craveonline.com/blog/175657-from-the-pages-of-the-ring-magazine-a-new-perspective). According to Cortez, much of the problems with judging within boxing is due to judges not being able to see the action. Visual distractions such as ropes, the ref, and bright lights, will no longer be a hindrance for judging. 

Could this work? Absolutely. I don’t think most judges who score a fight do so with the intent to rob a fighter’s good efforts.

**The officials displayed gross incompetence.** 

This occurs most often with officials who have little practical experience. The solution therefore is simple: don’t give fights carrying worldwide significance to refs that haven’t built their resume.

But in the case of Russell Mora, this wasn’t the case. Mora is typically a respected referee but on this night, he had a tremendous lapse in standards. What can be done about officials like Mora?

Simple. Every point deduction or disqualification should be reviewed by video replay. If it works in football, why can’t it work boxing? In order to deduct a point, refs need to pause the action anyway. Give it a review. If the action passes the snuff test, *then* deduct a point.

**There’s clear organized corruption.**

This can’t easily be helped because if there’s clear organization corruption, the problem is malignant. There’s no band-aid solution that will be of help.

The good news for boxing is that there isn’t one singular organization that runs the sport. There are sanctioning bodies and commissions that are clearly corrupt — but there’s also ones that have integrity. 

The problem, as far as the USA is concerned, is that if a promoter wants a specific fighter to win, he has no problem of moving the fight to a corrupt jurisdiction. Here, matters of PEDs and hometown decisions are swept under the rug. A good example of this is Texas — a state that has become infamous for controversy.

I therefore propose three solutions to this problem:

1. Scrap all regional / state commissions, and put everything into one big national commission. *Nationalize* everything. Put rules, officialdom, drug testing, rankings under the scope of one national organization that governs the sport. Make this body one that is backed up by the US government.
2. To kill charges of bias, all sanctioning bodies should adopt computerized rankings. The IBO already does this, and the results have been (mostly) effective. Using computerized rankings, elite boxers are often titlists with the IBO before they’re titlists with the “major” sanctioning bodies.
3. I personally don’t like this proposal, but if I’m being fair, it’s worth thinking about. Move all pro boxing under the jurisdiction of [AIBA Professional Boxing](http://www.aiba.org/en-US/APBintro.aspx) (a.k.a., the APB). This will allow professional boxers to perform under the jurisdiction of an organization that has international sway, while maintaining their Olympic eligibility. 

Regarding Proposal 3, I’m reluctant to suggest this because AIBA hasn’t actually been a shining light of integrity. However, is the WBC and WBA — the two oldest, most “prestigious” sanctioning bodies — any better? I think not.

One advantage the APB has that current alphabet organizations don’t have is that it has support from a countries wherein fighters who don’t often go pro can *easily* go pro. For instance, Cuba is now allowing their boxers to go pro *if* they do so under the jurisdiction of the APB.

On the flipside, this “solution” could also mean a polarized pro world. Countries that are already established within the current status quo will not likely find broad support for the APB. Countries that are not will easily find the APB to be a great alternative to the current system.

Any which way you see it, though, whatever system demonstrates the *most* integrity and the *least* corruption is the system that will eventually win.",,False,,t5_2qj0l,1360358943.0,,,True,t3_185d9l,http://www.reddit.com/r/Boxing/comments/185d9l/what_can_we_actually_do_to_decrease_controversy/,

In fact, I even thought his arrogance going into and coming out of the Maidana fight was acceptable. Maybe even warranted. After all, it was us who called him a glass jaw pretender. So, he went out and showed everyone he had the heart, will, and grit to squeak out a victory over one of the biggest punchers in boxing. Fast forward to the Lamont Peterson bout. Going in, I knew this was going to be way tougher than anyone imagined, especially with the talk of the Mayweather fight being next on Amir's hitlist. He lost and it was controversial. He called bullshit saying it was home cooking. After that statement from Amir, I called bullshit as did many in the community. He may have done enough to win, as far as clean shots go, but this was a wake up call. Amir was exposed, not for his lack of a chin this time. Actually, he proved he could take several shots. What he also proved, more importantly, is he doesn't have the defense to avoid having his chin checked. He defense amounted to bouncing around the ring, pushing, and running. Then Garcia happened, and really what's there to say. When a guy counters you because you're overly aggressive, what can you say? Well, in Khan's case there's a lot. One is that his trainer didn't teach him defense. Another is that he wasn't the main focus of his training camp. And now, just recently, that his trainer's illness is holding him back. That he's not pushing him as far as he can go and getting the most out of him.Amir has really lived up to his name. As cheesy as it sounds, the guy is a con. He takes no responsibility for his short comings. I understand that he may want a trainer who's going to give him his whole attention... except he's now with Virgil Hunter, the most sought after trainer in boxing who's current main focus is one of the top pound-for-pound fighters in the world. What? This sounds familiar...Amir Khan needs to take some responsibility for his career. He's failing because he lacks discipline. He fails because he thinks the circumstances around his training and fighting will dictate the outcome. That's a nice try, but the only one who's going to produce the wins is Amir himself. When he finally understands that, we'll see a responsible and mature man in the ring who can execute a gameplan and use his amazing talents to best pull off a victory. Until then, will we continue to follow the trend of excuses and changes to his camp to explain why he's not winning?",,False,,t5_2qj0l,False,,,True,t3_12em49,http://www.reddit.com/r/Boxing/comments/12em49/amir_khan/,

Let's begin.

* British boxing has always been exciting to watch and today will be no different.  Kell Brook (Ring rated #4 welterweight) squares off against Carson Jones (six months younger than me...making me feel worthless).  Jones has 8 stoppages in his last 8 fights but has not been able to make it into the upper echelon of fighters.  Kell Brook seems to be a special talent coming out of the UK, and while slowly building his credentials across the pond, he has become a British superstar.  Brook's speed and athleticism should prove to be too much against Jones.  Look for Brook to stop Jones in about 8 rounds.  

* In British Heavyweight boxing, Tyson ""named after Mike Tyson"" Fury takes on Vinny Maddalone.  Fury's most notable win has come over Dereck Chisora in 2011 but has really failed to impress me otherwise.  He's an extremely tall heavyweight (6'9""), but he doesn't always use his height advantage wisely.  This is just another ""gimme"" fight for Fury, since Maddalone is still probably reeling from the extended beating he recieved from Tomasz Adamek in 2010.  Look for Fury to stop Maddalone in similar fashion.  Fury TKO5 Maddalone.

* Also across the way, the Ring, IBO, IBF, WBO, WBA Heavyweight Champion of the World"" Wladimir Klitschko puts his titles on the line"" against  Tony ""The Tiger"" Thompson.  W. Klit beat Thompson in 2008 via TKO in the 11th, but Thompson didn't make it easy for Klitschko.  Thompson has come back with 5 stoppages against C+/B- level opposition since the loss.  Klitschko has a habit of doing better in rematches, so the pick here is Klitschko KO7 Thompson.

* Finally, on HBO at 10EST, former Middleweight Champion of the World Kelly ""The Ghost"" Pavlik continues his comeback against Will ""Power"" Rosinsky.  Pavlik lost his middleweight crown in a 2011 decision loss to Sergio Martinez which showed us that Pavlik cannot deal with slick, quick boxers, and luckily for him, Rosinsky is *not* that.  Don't get me wrong Rosinsky had solid skills, and he's seemed to come into the fight in better shape than Pavlik, but Pavlik should have enough in his arsenal to overcome ""Power"".  I think Rosinsky will last the distance with Pavlik and Pavlik will walk away with a close decision win.  Pavlik UD10 Rosinsky.  

* On that same card, WBO Super Bantanweight champion Nonitio Donaire continues his plans for title unification against IBF champion Jeffrey Mathebula.  Donaire looked especially vulnerable in his last fight against Wilfredo Vasquez Jr., where he won via split decision (should have been a UD).  Mathebula has decent boxing skills (dropped a split decision loss against Celestino Caballero in 2009 when Caballero was climbing the P4P rankings), and with a 5.5 inch height advantage, he will be the tallest opponent Donaire has faced.  Donaire is believed by many to be top 5 P4P and should be too much for Mathebula to handle.  I see it being a tougher fight for Donaire with Donaire walking away with a close split decision win.

We are back with another Throwback Thursday. In my absence I have traveled coast to coast in the United States on a business trip. Typically not exciting; however, in my travels I manage to find boxing fans everywhere, and from showing a cab driver how to turn against a southpaw to a desk clerk showing me pictures of famous boxers he met at the hotel, one thing was a common theme and that is excitement about the upcoming Olympics. I have to confess I knew very little about the Olympic team but there is excitement brewing. So I promise to do some digging and maybe come up with a Reddit Cheat sheet for the upcoming games. In the interim, I decided to educate myself a little more on Olympic boxing, and in my search I discovered a real interesting character who never entered the professional scene, Teofilo Stevenson  

The olympic boxing world is largely different then the world of the prizefighting pugilist, it is a world with less glamour, but a heavy focus on pure boxing skill. The future Picasso's of the ring almost always manage to excel in the olympics and the amateurs, and some that do excel at this level never make it through the riggers of the professional circuit, and some simply decided never to join. Perhaps the most skilled and amazing of those fighters the cuban Teofilo Stevens. Teofilo Stevens is perhaps the most skilled Cuban to have ever entered the olympics, which is an accomplishment considering the small island is second only to the United states in number of Gold Medals and total medals. Only three fighters in the world have managed to capture the gold three times one from Hungary, and the other Felix Savon, another Cuban. Teofilo Stevenson never got a chance to compete for his fourth, but if he had, it is a near certainty he would have won.

Stevenson is perhaps most famous for one thing, and that is refusing to fight Ali. In 1976 Stevens dominated the Olympics held in Montreal pushing him to the top of everyone’s list of prospects, we was unpaid for his efforts in the olympics but he seemed to enjoy himself tremendously. After dominating in such a marvelous fashion boxing promoters put together a deal he could not refuse, a million dollars to face Ali for the belt. 

Stevenson did not take the money or the offer, stating, “but what’s a million dollars compared to the love of eight million cubans.” This is a powerful statement considering the problems we are still facing today when it comes to Cuban fighters entering the professional circle. In cuba the belief is that a fighter’s talents are the property of the country, so the only way for stevenson to take the deal would be for him to leave the country. I don’t think this was in anyway an attempt to get out of the fight either. Ali was 35 at the time and soon to lose to Leon Spinks. 

It wasn’t a case Stevenson being brainwashed or held against his will, he wanted to stay in his native Cuba, and he was not willing to give up his home to be a famous athlete. he goes further to say that Ali is his brother, and that they were fantastic friends. 

However, I like to imagine that Stevenson would have been a great professional, he was bigger then Forman as fast as Ali and he was clearly a thinking man’s fighter. Even George Forman said that Stevenson was the best he had seen in a very long time and that he would certainly have been a champion if he had turned professional. Looking at footage and photos, one can only imagine what he could have done as a professional. He moved like a Welterweight but he was built not like the heavyweights of his era but more like the human monsters that make up the elite of this era. 

Stevenson vs John Tate was sensational and the commentary by Foreman is really a testament to what could have been(4:25 if you want to see someone out on their feet): 
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nW7MkLz6vxs

Here is the full Olympic fight between Tyrell Biggs and Stevenson
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bTiqc8TaTnk

You can see just how amazing he looks for a big man, he was fluid fast, massive, and powerful. Tyrell Biggs was a very accomplished fighter with 108-6-4 record in the amateurs including two wins over Francesco Damiani, Damiani would later get his revenge in the professional circuit: 
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYJgMxWuduM

Biggs was a very talented fighter who struggled with drug and alcohol but he managed to have a win over lennox Lewis and he won a gold in the olympics, mainly due to the fact that the cubans were out of the olympics due to the Russian Boycott. 
Here is Biggs vs Lewis great Olympic quarter final: 
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yjUC6xys_QA

When you think about the timing of around Stevenson Career if he had been a professional he would have certainly faced Ali who would have had an amazing fight. He would have faced Larry Holmes, Perhaps George Foreman, and maybe even a Young Mike Tyson. On paper, I can see him winning any of these fights, but certainly not all Olympic fighters do well at the professional level.  

Watching video’s of him, I think he would have done just fine as a professional but you can see here he was also a sensational human being, first he beats a man bloody, with a helmet on, then victorious he raises his opponent in the air out of respect. Sensational: 
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ULqfYxzxcd4&amp;feature=related

When Tyson broke down in an interview it was when he was asked what he missed about boxing, “when it wasn’t about the money.” This was the magic that Stevenson always kept. He never once fought for Money, he fought for himself and for his country. I cannot wrap my head around that concept, no matter how much I try to sympathize, even by today’s standard I can’t imagine turning down a million, out of national pride, but that is exactly what Stevenson did, and that is what makes him an amazing human. Stevenson was given the honor of being the country's national Amateur coach by Fidel Castro who also gave him a place to live.

##Roman Martinez vs. Juan Carlos Burgos
***Round 1:*** Both guys already getting busy. Martinez to the body, and Burgos counters. Both fighters throwing like they mean it. Good left hook by Burgos taps Martinez' chin. at the 50 second mark, Burgos lands a significant combo. Martinez then steps in and slightly wobbles Burgos. Really love how the styles mesh with this fight.

10-9 Burgos

***Round 2:*** Burgos showing supreme ring generalship. He's moving Martinez to where he wants and engaging in range. Martinez then manages to corner Burgos and send shots to the body. Combos to the head and body at the one minute mark by Burgos. Good engagement by Martinez at the end nearly steals him this round. Nearly.

10-9 Burgos, 20-18 Burgos

***Round 3:*** Damn. Burgos hooks to the body are just beautiful — this will be a great investment for the later rounds. These body shots are just vicious. Martinez finally gets close and send some shots on the inside. That's the kind of work he needs to do if he wants success.

10-9 Burgos, 30-27 Burgos

***Round 4:*** It seems to me as though Burgos body shots are successfully slowing Martinez down Martinez pushes Burgos to the ropes. He's just unleashing everything he can — but Burgos is replying well. Burgos Looks to me that if Martinez is to win this, he needs to move Burgos to the ropes more often. Every time this is on the outside, it's Burgos' game.

10-9 Burgos, 40-36 Burgos

***Round 5:*** Same story for this round. As long as Burgos is away from the ropes, he does well. If he's at the ropes, not so much. Most of this round isn't near the ropes — but this is closer for Martinez.

10-9 Burgos, 50-45 Burgos

***Round 6:*** Burgos amps up the activity. He's now beating the crap out of Martinez — and these shots are landing just a little too cleanly. Martinez is attempting to get Burgos to the ropes, but Burgos is more active there too. Oh God. Martinez is one tough bastard. I'm just amazed that he's still able to reply. Martinez now corners Burgos and rips Burgos hard — Burgos replying with bad intentions.

10-9 Burgos, 60-54 Burgos

***Round 7:*** Martinez to he ropes, bullying Burgos — but Burgos fights his way out with a low blow. He gets warned by the ref for that. Well, Martinez not letting any low blows stop him. He pushes Burgos back to the ropes and smothers him. Burgos with a shot to Martinez head — he's clearly dazed! He follows up with more jabs and Martinez ain't responding well! My God, this would have been a Martinez round if he didn't get caught!

10-9 Burgos, 70-63 Burgos

***Round 8:*** Martinez launches himself trying to overcome Burgos, but Burgos dealt with it well with well placed accurate body shots. Burgos now to the head. Martinez moves Burgos to the ropes and now throws leather at him. This is his most definitive round.

10-9 Martinez, 79-73 Burgos

***Round 9:*** Martinez realizes he's losing so immediately sends Burgos to the ropes where he unleashes his power shots. Burgos waiting till Martinez tires before replying with his own body shots. Burgos now dancing away from Martinez wide looping shots. Better shots by Burgos, but Martinez is the aggressor.

10-9 Burgos, 89-82 Burgos

***Round 10:*** Burgos now treating Martinez body like a pinball machine. Martinez do all he can, but Burgos knows just the range to deliver his body shots. Martinez looks like he's going for a home run punch. However, Burgos isn't staying still.

10-9 Burgos, 99-91 Burgos

***Round 11:*** Even though Martinez is way down on my scorecards, I got to appreciate his will to win. Martinez moving Burgos to the ropes and does his work, but just as Martinez runs out of steam, Burgos replies to the body. Martinez amps up his activity. He's getting more meaningful shots this round. 

10-9 Martinez, 108-101 Burgos

***Round 12:*** Both guys giving it them all. Burgos is trying to close the show, and Martinez is going for that home run punch. Burgos continuing those vicious shots to the body. Martinez getting a few shots in that stun Burgos. 10 seconds left. Both go all out. The bell rings. I think Burgos just nicked this round.

10-9 Burgos, 118-110 Burgos

**Official Result** Scores: 117-111 for Burgos, 116-112 for Martinez, 114-114. This fight is a split draw. Roman Martinez is still the WBO super featherweight titlist.

## Gennady Golovkin vs. Gabriel Rosado
***Round 1:*** Well, Golovkin's not wasting time. He pressures Rosado out of the gate. Golovkin popping him with the jab. Rosado replying but not catching Golovkin cleanly. Good short right at the ropes by Golovkin. 

10-9 Golovkin

***Round 2:*** Good body shot by Rosado gets through — but Golovkin is dictating the pace. Golovkin just beginning to turn up the punch volume. Right hand tags Rosado hard! There's an ugly cut opening on Rosado's left eye! I just can't imagine this lasting long. Rosado being more active, but is the activity effective? I think not. 

10-9 Golovkin, 20-18 Golovkin

***Round 3:*** Right hand by Rosado actually hurts Golovkin! Well, Rosado — if anything — is game. Right hand hurts Rosado! He follows up! Rosado wobbles! Golovkin now walking Rosado down to see if he can end this! Rosado now replying.  Fuck! Golvokin just countered Rosado hard! Rosado's such a mess right now with blood pouring down his face! 

10-9 Golovkin, 30-27 Golovkin

***Round 4:*** SMH. Nothing but admiration for Rosado. Admiration. Golovkin still patient, walks Rosado down. Right rocks Rosado's head back! Rosado trying to win Golovkin's respect — tags him at the end of the round. Still Golovkin's round, though.

10-9 Golovkin, 40-36 Golovkin

***Round 5:*** Good right hand by Rosado hurts Golovkin — with Golovkin nodding his head. Rosado now coming forward pressuring Golovking now! Golovkin now retreating. Golovkin amping it up with a left hook to the body! Both trade now. Not entirely sure if I should, but I'm giving this to Rosado.

10-9 Rosado, 49-46 Golovkin

***Round 6:*** Round begins but Smoger pauses the fight so the doctor can look at Rosado's eye.  They deem him good. Action starts. Righ hook rocks back Rosado! He's not looking good in there! Somehow, though, he replies though with his own shots! Golovkin hits Rosado with a rabbit punch. Smoger calls a halt so he can walk it off. Damn! That cut looks hideous! Golovkin popping hard — Rosado going to the body and getting some head shots on Golovkin. Golovkin now stepping into it! He launches a hard shot to Rosado's mouth! Blood is streaming everywhere! What a round!

10-9 Golovkin, 59-55 Golovkin

***Round 7:*** The doctor looks at Rosado's eye again. Somehow, they allow him to fight. Golovkin hooking Rosado everywhere. Good God! This is a massacre! Maybe the ref should stop the fight. Golovkin just playing target practice right now. A jab by Golovkin causes Rosado's eyes to roll back. Rosado's corner stops the fight! They saved his life!

**Official Results** Golovkin TKO7 Rosado

## Orlando Salido vs. Mikey Garcia
***Round 1:*** Good styles match-up so far. Salido coming forward while Garcia calculating his distance. OH GOD! SALIDO GOES DOWN! Did not see that coming! Salido is hurt! Garcia patiently not forcing anything — knowing there may be more to Salido. Salid moves inside, and Garcia punishes him for it. Left hook rocks Salido! He goes down! Saved by the bell!

10-7 Garcia

***Round 2:*** Good combo by Garcia stuns Salido. Salido, like the warrior he is, still moves forward. Salid attempting to slow down Garcia with shots to the body but this isn't a problem of speed but of distance. Salido rushed Garcia to the ropes — Garcia moves away, though. 

10-9 Garcia, 20-16 Garcia

***Round 3:*** Salido attempting to get inside. Garcia is using his legs and his jab to keep him at bay. RIGHT UPPERCUT TO THE CHIN FORCES SALIDO DOWN! Somehow he gets up! Still, Garcia keep his patience — not trying to force anything. Wow. Garcia is making a legit titlist look like an amateur.

10-8 Garcia, 30-24 Garcia

***Round 4:*** STRAIGHT RIGHT TAGS SALIDO'S CHIN AND HE'S DOWN FOR A FOURTH TIME! This is as dominant a debut title fight from anyone I've seen! Garcia is like a Bible of boxing! Salido now marches forward! He gets inside and manages some body shots! Garcia still patient waiting for Salido to just get into distance. Looping right hand by Salido gets in followed by combos. Garcia ties him up. For a guy who's been knocked down four times, Salido's still a live dog.

10-8 Garcia, 40-32 Garcia

***Round 5:*** Right hand rocks Salido! Salido still patient! Garcia sends a jab followed by a right that rocks Salido again! Garcia just does a dominant job of taking Salido apart again and again. Salido's eye is getting swollen.

10-9 Garcia, 50-42 Garcia

***Round 6:*** Salido manages to get a looping shot in, but it doesn't affect Garcia at all. Garcia still exhibiting great patience as he measures distance. Every time Garcia hits Salido, Salido looks visibly hurt. Salido now corners Garcia to the corner — unleashes some flurries that don't connect.

10-9 Garcia, 60-50 Garcia

***Round 7:*** Salido with a few looping right hands manages to catch Garcia! Garcia now countering with his own vicious shots! Salido attempting to pressure Garcia! Uppercut by Garcia! Salido still lively here — and actually has more punches this round. In last 10 seconds, Garcia unleashes some combos — this steals him the round.

10-9 Garcia, 70-59 Garcia

***Round 8:*** Big right hand shakes up Salido! Garcia with a wide hook tags Salido hard! Salido may be losing, but he's going out on his shield. Good right by Garcia to Salido's body! Salido jumps in with his head and knocks Garcia's head. Looks like he broke Garcia's nose with that. Still a Garcia round.

10-9 Garcia, 80-68 Garcia

**Official Result** Doctor is stopping the fight due to the ""accidental"" headbutt causing Garcia's broken nose. This therefore goes to the score cards. Scores: 79-70, 79-69, 79-69. Mikey Garcia is the new WBO featherweight titlist.",,False,,t5_2qj0l,1358659392.0,,,True,t3_16wm36,http://www.reddit.com/r/Boxing/comments/16wm36/fight_thread_orlando_salido_vs_mikey_garcia/,moderator

1349708445.0,25,self.Boxing,1151e2,Am I the only one who thinks the attitudes of the media about this 4th Pacquiao/Marquez are completely insane?,32,7,37,http://www.reddit.com/r/Boxing/comments/1151e2/am_i_the_only_one_who_thinks_the_attitudes_of_the/,"It seems like nearly every article I've read since the announcement is full of bitching about Pacquiao's decision to fight Marquez again, and I honestly don't get it.  Now, I scored all 3 of their fights so far for Marquez so I'm personally happy he's getting another shot to hopefully get the ""W"" I feel he's been wrongfully denied, but no matter how you scored the first 3 the one thing I think everyone can universally agree on is that they were all incredible fights!  So what's the problem here? 

Ya know, I can understand how the casual fan could be so frustrated by the inability to yet again make the Mayweather fight and channel that into shortchanging another Marquez fight but I expect better from professional journalists who should be able to appreciate what's almost guaranteed to be another excellent fight.  All I hear is Manny being accused of going to the same well too many times, but no one's giving him any credit for taking what has to be seen as the riskiest possible (non Mayweather) fight for him at this point... this is the one guy who's consistently been able to figure him out, who he's barely scraped by previously, and if he he loses this time will mean he's lost twice in a row and virtually kills the Mayweather fight... on top of all that, ya gotta figure the judges are gonna probably be extra-Marquez sympathetic after the last one.

I dunno, just strikes me as some seriously lackluster journalism and more or less a collective temper-tantrum over not getting the Mayweather fight they want...",,False,,t5_2qj0l,False,,,True,t3_1151e2,http://www.reddit.com/r/Boxing/comments/1151e2/am_i_the_only_one_who_thinks_the_attitudes_of_the/,

1375098897.0,25,self.Boxing,1j9rw8,A begging email - making my white collar debut for charity on Friday,32,7,6,http://www.reddit.com/r/Boxing/comments/1j9rw8/a_begging_email_making_my_white_collar_debut_for/,"Hi,

So, first of all, if you consider this spam I am sorry and feel free to read no further. I messaged /nerve back when I was first going to do this and he was ok with it then so hope that still holds. You might have seen I've been around this forum a fair bit over the last year or so so I'm not just some spammer.

So I'm making my white collar boxing debut on Friday. I'm 6'1"" and around 88kg and I'm fighting a guy who is 6'2"" and was 106kg when he started training - he's a bit lighter now but he's still a good deal heavier than me. But our relative experience should cancel out that advantage. When he started training 10 weeks ago he'd never been in a boxing gym before whereas I've been doing a bit of sparring (nothing serious) and been in and out of boxing gyms on and off for about 5 years - not to mention that I did the full 10 weeks training for a white collar show in March only to have my fight cancelled at the last minute.

So it should be a good fair fight, I think I can beat him - but I think it will be close. It also could get a bit Ward Gatti as we both have a lot of heart and absolutely shocking defence (my favourite boxer might be JMM but in the ring I'm nothing like that!). Anyway he's a nice bloke and we've already agreed the first drink will be on the winner so there won't be any hard feelings once the fight is over. You can read more about the bloke I'm fighting on [his blog](http://theboxingbear.blogspot.co.uk/) and please do consider donating to [his charity](http://uk.virginmoneygiving.com/fundraiser-web/fundraiser/showFundraiserPage.action?userUrl=thebearboxes&amp;faId=329837&amp;isTeam=false).

(Also if any of you are in London [this is the event](https://www.facebook.com/events/426171674156804/) and it should be a cracker. My tickets are all sold out but if you're quick you might be able to get some off the organisers).

**Anyway** the reason I'm taking up your time with this is because I'm doing it for charity too. Mine is the [Sri Lanka Campaign for Peace and Justice](http://www.srilankacampaign.org/welcome.htm) and in the interests of full disclosure I should point out I work for them. But they really are an incredible organisation, doing what they can to sort out one of the most under-the-radar fucked up countries on the planet. Torture and murder are everyday occurrences in Sri Lanka and if you get on the wrong side of the Government you simply disappear - thousands, honestly thousands, have already. The Sri Lanka Campaign are an absolutely tiny organisation, but one which has real clout. I love them to bits and by making them the charity I'm fighting for I like to think I'm joining the long line of pacifist boxers with Ali in the middle of it.

**So if you are feeling generous [please send me a couple of quid, whatever you can afford, here.](http://everydayhero.co.uk/fred_carver_boxing)**

I really appreciate it, thanks. And I'll post the youtube to [r/amateur_boxing](http://reddit.com/r/amateur_boxing) (and to here if you want) so you can see if I was any good.",,False,,t5_2qj0l,1375099108.0,,,True,t3_1j9rw8,http://www.reddit.com/r/Boxing/comments/1j9rw8/a_begging_email_making_my_white_collar_debut_for/,

Trout was really an unknown quantity, and easily brushed off the boos of the crowd, fought TOTALLY clean, fought smart.  Remained really humble in the post fight interview, and gave his praise to Cotto and Jesus (I didn't care about the Jesus part, but it sure was a crowd pleaser).

I'll also say that all the ""should Cotto retire?"" talk is nonsense.  It's easy to say now because we know nothing about Trout, but lets imagine the following scenario: say Trout takes his victory over Cotto and parlays into in a fight with Canelo Alvarez and wins that too.  Maybe after that he fights Martirosyan.  After that maybe he beefs up and fights Ward, and after that Mayweather is really the only good option.  If two or three years from now Trout fights Mayweather and wins, no one will look back of Trout/Cotto as an embarrasment—they'll look back and say ""Wow, can you believe Cotto lasted 12 rounds with Trout who was bigger and five years younger?"" and they'll be right.

Now, maybe none of that happens, but the point is we wont know what this means until we know more about Trout.",,False,,t5_2qj0l,False,,,True,t3_145rug,http://www.reddit.com/r/Boxing/comments/145rug/i_was_at_the_garden_last_night_for_cotto_v_trout/,

Yet, as great as Muhammad Ali is, many ask, ""What would have happened if Ali fought Teófilo Stevenson?""

Ali fought Liston, Frazier, Foreman, Norton. Yet, the one notable name he did not fight was perhaps one of the *other* all time greats: Teófilo Stevenson. Who was Stevenson?

Quite simply, Stevenson is one of the few boxers to have won 3 Olympic gold medals. He *could* have won 4 if Cuba had not boycotted the 1984 Olympics. Stevenson also won 3 gold medals at the World Amateur Champsions, as well as 2 gold medals and 1 bronze at the Pan American games.

By no means am I saying either Ali or Stevenson were *less* great because they did not fight each other — but the fight came agonizingly close to happening. In 1976, a promoter offered Stevenson $5 million to fight Ali. Stevenson refused the offer, stating ""What is one million dollars compared to the love of eight million Cubans?""

***

I highlight the above story to explain why *I* think Donaire-Rigondeaux is a big deal. 

Rigondeaux is one of the greatest amateur boxers of all time, and now he is doing what Stevenson did not. Rigondeaux went professional, won a world title, and is fighting *the* best boxer below 140lbs in Nonito Donaire. Should he win against Donaire, we should consider whether Rigondeaux is, in fact, one of the greatest fighters of all time — *regardless* of amateur or professional status.

What of Donaire then? What if he does what he's expected to do — and wins by spectacular KO?

Even as Donaire is considered a top 5 P4P boxer, he hasn't had a fight that makes a case for greatness. Yes, he won against the likes of Darchinyan, Sydorenko, Montiel, and Nishioka — but as good as these fighters are, none of them should be considered *great*. In 20 years, nobody will look in the history books and be comparing *those* guys to the likes of Flash Elorde, Carlos Zarate, and Marco Antonio Barrera. 

But they will talk about Rigondeaux — even as Rigondeaux has yet to make a definitive mark in pro boxing. 

***
In the future, will either fighter get their just due? Who knows. But no matter the eventual outcome, either fighter should get their just due *now*. 

Greatness is defined by the ability to meet big challenges head on, and rise above them. In this match up, both fighters are rising to the occasion, each anxious to prove he is the better man, willing to test the limits of his own self-belief.

This is what you have to do in order to be considered ""great"".",,False,,t5_2qj0l,1365715987.0,,,True,t3_1c5ug5,http://www.reddit.com/r/Boxing/comments/1c5ug5/on_greatness/,

**CHAMPION: Sergio Martinez 50 - 2 - 2 (28 KO’s)**

It’s great to have a middleweight champion.  Aside from the heavyweights, no other division embodies the history of the sport quite like the middleweight division.  With a crown that can be traced back through greats like Hopkins, Hagler, Leonard, and Robinson, the Middleweight crown is one of the most prized possessions in our sport.  And we’re lucky to have such a proud owner.  Since earning his seat on the throne with a decisively bloody victory over Kelly Pavlik, Martinez has done nearly everything in his power to do his 160 lb forefathers proud.  Not only has he grown into the weight once thought too large for the natural Jr. Middleweight, but Martinez has also managed to grow a punch as well, having dispatched nearly all contenders in violent fashion.  On top of that, his marketability has reached new heights with his brilliant schooling of Julio Cesar Chavez, Jr. that almost crumbled in the dramatic 12th round.  At 38, and with injuries seemingly becoming more common, it’s not sure how long Martinez will stay atop his throne what with the new rising threats. But one thing’s for sure--he’ll give us a hell of a show until then.

1.    **Daniel Geale 29 - 1 (15 KO’s)**  - In an almost textbook case of prospect-to-contender-to-titlist progression, Geale has consistently and gradually upped his game and met the challenge. Having just hammered home a revenge victory over his only previous conqueror, Anthony Mundine, Geale is a unified titlist who can be credited with ending the lengthy, uneventful reigns of two of Germany’s most protected titlists, Sturm and Sylvester.  Now that he’s got two belts in his possession, it will be exciting to see who will finally challenge the meteoric rise of this contender.

2.   **Gennady Golovkin 25 - 0 (22 KO’s)** - We’ve heard the hype and-more importantly-we’ve heard the punches.  Golovkin arrived in the states not with a literal bang as his brick-like hands thudded into the poor flesh of a game Proksa.  And with the beating of the prospect came the beating of the war drums.  Everyone wants to see Golovkin fight, and everyone wants to see him fight everyone.  The former amateur star has obvious talent and real dynamite in his punches that, combined with a seeming lack of desire to defend himself completely, make him a promoter’s dream.  If only he wasn’t every other promoter’s nightmare.

3.   **Austin Trout 26 - 0 (14 KO’s)** - After seeing his boring but clear victory over Delvin Rodriguez, it was hard to make the case that Austin Trout was going to be a fan favorite any time soon.  But after following that up with an impressive underdog victory over an aged, but not entirely washed-up Miguel Cotto, Austin Trout’s gained the appreciation of most boxing fans.  And that appreciation has helped bolster his case for a long awaited and lucrative match-up against everyone’s favorite Opie, Saul Alvarez.  It’s a fight that was impossible 2 years ago, highly unlikely years ago, and all but certain today.  And he’s got more than a fighting chance.

4.   **Saul Alvarez 41 - 0 - 1 (30 KO’s)** - The Ginger Goose that lays Golden Boy Eggs has gradually fought his way into the approval of his peers.  What once many deemed a young, highly protected prospect who beats up on undersized, over-aged B-sides has somehow transformed into a future Pound-for-Pound star if he keeps making the right steps.  The surprisingly young (22 years old?!) Mexican has theoretically a decade of fighting ahead of him before father time catches up to him, and one could argue he still isn’t in his prime.  And with 42 fights already under his belt, he might have the veteran experience already waiting for his body to catch up.  Regardless of whether he wins or loses in his pick’em bout with Austin Trout, Alvarez has near limitless potential.

5.   **Floyd Mayweather, Jr. 43 - 0 (26 KO’s)** - In a somewhat contested appearance, Floyd shows up exactly in the middle, indicating the polarity with which fight fans approach Floyd’s resume.  While half of the boxing community at large praises Floyd’s accomplishments and recognizes him as the #1 contender of this division after his victory over Cotto, the other half of the community expectedly and understandably believes his ventures and status as a Middleweight to be momentary and over-blown.  While the work he’s done at the weight is scarce, it is definitive, as he is effectively now a two-time 154 lb titlist.  His next fight will take place at welterweight, but if everyone’s wish comes true, we’ll likely see him return to this weight in September.

6.   **Peter Quillin 28 - 0 (20 KO’s)** - With a nickname like Kid Chocolate, Peter Quillin has some pretty big shoes to fill.  And he just might be on his way to filling them.  After a long road of contenders, former champs, and fellow prospects, Quillin finally lived up to his hype in an exciting and impressive performance against N’Jikam.  In a fight that had him pitted against an athletic, elusive, and undefeated opponent, Quillin’s poise and power saved the day as he dropped his man six times to pick up his middleweight title.  Now that he has a belt, though, it’s going to be interesting to see whether or not he continues his upward march through the rankings, or whether he’ll get complacent behind easy defenses and a name.

7.   **Julio Cesar Chavez, Jr. 46 - 1 - 1 (32 KO’s)** - Boxing fans hated his rich upbringing, they hated his awkward style, they hated his padded record, and they hated the snotty way he believed he’d live up to his name.  But then he gave Marco Antonio Rubio a drubbing, and he absolutely ran through Andy Lee, and then we started respecting.  And as we smugly sat back, watching our champion pick and hack at Chavez, Jr’s face for 11 and half rounds, we approvingly nodded as the young prospect proved to be exactly what we thought he would be.  But when he drove Martinez into the ropes and onto the canvas in that last round, we saw not only glimpses of Chavez, Jr.’s potential, but glimpses of Chavez, Sr. himself.  But a few seconds short and a failed marijuana test later, Jr. found himself belt-less and suspended.  Luckily, there’s a very lucrative rematch waiting for him with the champion of his division.

8.   **Carlos Molina 21 - 5 - 2 (6 KO’s)** - Even with an ugly style and and uglier record, fight fans have to love Carlos Molina. After a dark period that saw him fail in two outs against Chavez, Jr. among other people, Molina compiled a decent run of victories that was capped with a victory over Kermit Cintron and other prospects.  But when you have a record like his and a burgeoning well of talent, it gets hard to find fights.  Luckily, after losing via contested DQ to Kirkland, Molina bounced back with a victory over Cory Spinks to get his name back up there.  

9.   **Dmitry Pirog  20 - 0 (15 KO’s)** - What began with a breakout performance over the highly touted Danny Jacobs ended in a troubling series of uninspired performances and injuries.  After pulling out of too many high profile bouts, Pirog’s found himself beltless with no leg to stand on.  He’s lucky that his explosive HBO debut was so memorable that we’re still willing to watch.

10. **Ishe Smith     25 - 5 (11 KO’s)** - Like Carlos Molina above, Ishe Smith’s road to the top has been circuitous and ugly.  While some of his losses could be chalked up as bad decisions, others are just the result of his own inconsistency. However, unlike Carlos Molina, Ishe Smith’s road to the top has netted him a major title.  Will the new belt and new promoter help him keep his “elite” pants up?  We can only wait and see.


Next up is the combined Welterweight and Junior Welterweight Division.  I think we're going to leave the division uncrowned, as there are heavy arguments at Welterweight and a tumultuous past at Junior Welterweight for the lineal championship.  This should be one of the harder, but more entertaining divisions to rank, as it plays host to so much P4P Talent and power.",,False,,t5_2qj0l,False,,,True,t3_19ohws,http://www.reddit.com/r/Boxing/comments/19ohws/rboxings_official_middleweight_rankings/,

1376509739.0,23,self.Boxing,1kdbe7,Upcoming AMA with Ray Beltran this Sunday at Noon PST/2pm central time,27,4,4,http://www.reddit.com/r/Boxing/comments/1kdbe7/upcoming_ama_with_ray_beltran_this_sunday_at_noon/,"Hey all, /u/emilyboxing will be typing on behalf of Ray for his AMA which will be this Sunday at Noon PST. It will last approximately one hour and will be right here on /r/boxing, not one of the AMA subs. This is our first AMA, and while we don’t have official rules regarding these, here are some points from /r/iama’s rules to keep in mind.

14. Voting Etiquette
________________________________________
1. You should vote on comments from users based on:
•	The value of the question: Questions should be original and on topic. They aren’t required to be, but AMAs are a unique opportunity and it is sad to squander them by asking 100 iterations of “if you could fight 1 horse sized duck or 100 duck sized horses.” Please try to encourage thought-provoking, discussion-inspiring questions that OP would not likely be asked anywhere else.
•	Civility and Politeness: users are free to (and encouraged to) ask tough questions. But this should be done in a respectful and polite way. There’s no need to use harsh language, and a comment that treats the OP like a person is much more likely to be answered.
•	Asking for Proof: having legitimate posts is vital to maintain the integrity of /r/iama, and makes it much easier for everyone to see the legitimacy of the post.
•	You should downvote insults and rude behavior (“F__k you because X”). This is not to say that you shouldn’t ask tough questions. But do it in a civil, polite matter, no matter how much you disagree with them. The OP took the time to come and share their thoughts, and they shouldn’t be harassed for doing so.
•	You should downvote non-questions and other “substanceless” comments that don’t make an interesting point or ask a good question (Ex: “I love you!”, “No questions, just wanted to say hi”). This also applies to child comments and reply to the OP. Followup questions, remarks on their answers, etc. are all encouraged, but jokes and puns should not be. 
•	You should downvote joke questions that aren’t intended to get a real answer, especially in threads where the OP probably won’t be able to respond to everyone. For example, “Do you even lift?” in every single AMA about athletics.
•	You should downvote attempts to back the OP into a corner; asking tough questions is fine, but don’t specifically try to put them into an uncomfortable or awkward position. This is a place to get information and learn about someone else’s opinions, not score points or further your own agenda. 
________________________________________
2. You should vote on an OP’s comments based on:
•	A response that addresses the question(s) being asked: The OP’s answer is pretty much always relevant to the discussion (it is their topic, after all) and it should rarely be downvoted, even if you disagree with what they say.
•	A thorough and detailed answer: If the OP is just using one-word answers or giving flippant responses, then feel free to downvote them. The answers in Woody Harrelson’s AMA are a great example of this: if the OP doesn’t answer a question well, then feel free to downvote it
•	Good humor and playing along with friendly banter
•	If you disagree with the OP’s opinion, offer a reply with your reasoned thoughts. This way, you can open a dialogue with op and potentially debate the differing points of view. This is much better than than downvoting, which just hides the comment from being seen by anyone and makes the AMA harder to navigate.
________________________________________
3. Voting on IAmAs
•	Whether the OP has interesting information or experiences, regardless of your personal opinion of that person or their experiences. The Westboro Baptist Church is a good example; even if you vehemently disagree with their viewpoint, they still have a very uncommon perspective to share. Downvoting the OP just cause you disagree with them will only result in an undesirable atmosphere and will likely end up with OP ending the AMA early, or not put effort into answering questions. Rather than downvoting, which just hides the comment from being seen by anyone, offer a reply with your reasoned thoughts. This way, you can open a dialogue with op and potentially debate the differing points of view.
•	Upvote for providing proof in the post. If there is no proof, ask for it! If the OP ignores requests for proof, or just dismisses it, then report it to the mods. 
•	Once it has started, how they are responding to questions overall. If you feel that they are only here to plug a product and didn’t take the time to interact with the community, then feel free to downvote it. 

Thanks again to Emily for making this happen!

Let’s set a good example, hopefully this can become a regular thing on this sub. ",,False,,t5_2qj0l,False,,,True,t3_1kdbe7,http://www.reddit.com/r/Boxing/comments/1kdbe7/upcoming_ama_with_ray_beltran_this_sunday_at_noon/,moderator

Going back and watching the Sergio fight, I'm honestly shocked this kid had the balls and spirit in him to not quit in that fight; absolutely pummeled each round and still getting off his stool for the next. For a guy who is getting stoned and eating cereal in his underwear during training camp, not to mention simply not showing up to train, the fact he is even remotely successful at a championship level is incredible. 

I may be speaking as an amateur boxer myself at this point, but boxing is devastatingly difficult at times. It's simply not easy getting smashed in the face again and again. More than that, the fact this guy can go 12 rounds is a miracle. I think people sometimes don't realize just how long &amp; hard 12 rounds can be, especially for a guy who apparently doesn't train that hard.

This isn't to say Jr. is some prodigy that needs some discipline, just that pro boxing isn't a career for the lazy or weak, and the fact he has made it to the level he has (father's name or not, it's not his dad getting his face pounded in the ring) is somewhat impressive to me.

## Curtis Stevens vs. Derrick Findley
***Round 1:*** This fight immediately starts as an inside fight near the ropes. First Findley pours on pressure, then when Findley tires, Stevens takes over. While both are clearly punchers, they sure get hit a lot too. Stevens, though seems to have the edge on speed. Findley, at the end of the round, bullies Stevens near the ropes. 

*10-9 Stevens*

***Round 2:*** Findley coming on strong, mauling Stevens to the ropes. Stevens covers up in his shell, waits for Findley to tire before replying with his own. Stevens with the left hook touches Findley's head. But Findley keeps coming forward, cuts off the ring, and bangs the body. Stevens to the center of the ring begins exchanging, but Findley is also returning leather. Good round for Findley.

*10-9 Findley, 19-19*

***Round 3:*** Findley ain't letting up on the pressure. He keeps marching Stevens to the ropes, forcing Stevens to act as the counterpuncher. Findley's overhands and body shots are beginning to hurt Stevens. Stevens firing off combos to keep Findley at bay. Findley, though, ain't letting up. He's bullying Stevens to the ropes. 

*10-9 Findley, 29-28 Findley*

***Round 4:*** Both men exchange at the center of the ring, with Stevens getting the better of it with combos punctuated by the left hook. Stevens beginning to manage the distance, calculate where Findley is going to enter the killzone. Findley tries to bully Stevens to the ropes, but Stevens just bangs him HARD with the left counter.

You do not need to:

* Post predictions every week
* Post predictions of *every* fight that’s qualified in the weekly [Prediction League] post

***
### Participation
To participate, post your fight prediction to a weekly thread posted each Wednesday tagged as [Prediction League].

When submitting a preview, include the following information:

* Name of fight
* Predicted outcome (e.g., W, L, or D)
* Predicted result (e.g., UD, SD, MD, KO, etc.)
* Specific round of KO prediction (e.g., KO1, KO2, etc.) [if applicable]
* Predicted score of one of the judges [if applicable]

Please note: TKOs are considered to be the same as KOs, and technical draws (TDs) before the 4th round are considered the same as no contests (NCs).

***

* Predicted scores of one of the judges for a UD, MD, SD, and D is worth 3 points

* If you do not predict the winner of a SD but guessed the correct score of one of the judges, you will be awarded 1 point
* Technical draws and no contests are considered 0 points

Points for outcomes, results, and rounds are considered exclusive. For instance, if you predict the correct outcome, results, and scores, you are awarded 3 points.

If a fight is controversial by a vast majority of /r/Boxing, an asterisk will appear next to the results. This doesn't change the standing in the Prediction League but simply points out that there is controversy.

***Round 6:*** Grachev to Bute's body. Grachev follows up with a jab. Grachev corners Bute to the ropes, then delivers three unanswered hooks. Grachev returns to the middle of the ring to jab. Grachev clearly has no respect for Bute's power, and keeps getting into Bute's space. Good left from Bute buckles Grachev for a moment. At the corner, Grachev hammers Bute to the body. Uppercut to the chin, Grachev takes it well.

10-9 Grachev, 57-57

***Round 7:*** Right hand from Grachev, followed by a body shot. Both trade shots at the center of the ring. Grachev sends Bute to the corner, and goes to the body again. Straight left from Bute connects. You know, the more Bute stays at the ropes, the more damage Grachev is able to get done. Good hook from Bute draws cheers from the crowd. 

10-9 Grachev, 67-66 Grachev

***Round 8:*** Four answered shots by Grachev near the ropes! Both circle at the cneter of the ring and exchange. Good uppercut by Bute! He follows up with a left straight and right hook! Good straight from Bute staggers Grachev! Grachev has a cut opened under his right eye! Bute is back in the game!

Bute 10-9, 76-76

***Round 9:*** Grachev backs Bute to the ropes, and sends to the body. Two right hands by Grachev. More damage being done by Grachev near the ropes. Nice uppercuts by Bute! Good right by Grachev. Left inside by Grachev. Bute's left eye looks terrible. Hook then jab by Bute. Good combos drill Grachev, but Grachev steps forward, pushes Bute to the ropes, and both exchange.

10-9 Grachev, 86-85 Grachev

***Round 10:*** Bute jabbing from the center of the ring. Grachev drives Bute to the ropes once again. Straight by Bute, followed by a combo. Grachev tags Bute with a right. Good uppercut by Bute! Grachev responds with a right. Bute delivers a straight left to Grachev's jaw. Uppercut by Bute results in a right hand by Grachev to end the round.

10-9 Bute, 95-95

***Round 11:*** Grachev getting more aggressive, and for some reason, Bute is too willing to let Grachev move him to the ropes. Bute delivers an uppercut, but Grachev delivers a body shot. Good hook by Bute, followed by a left to the body. Grachev again tags Bute with a right over at the ropes. Both are now exchanging at the end of the round.

10-9 Bute, 105-104 Bute

***Round 12:*** Last round. Grachev to the body yet again. Grachev delivers and uppercut at the ropes. Uppercut but Bute now. At the ropes, Grachev goes again and again to the body. Both deliver hard shots near the corner. Good right, then left by Bute! Tremendous action at the center of the ring. Bute now drilling Grachev to the jaw! Both exchanging hard! Neither man is holding up much defense. Each are punching till the bell!

10-9 Bute, 115-113 Bute

Hockey players and figure-skaters both ice-skate, but no one ever confuses the two sports. A figure skater specializes in skating and can do crazy shit that a hockey player could never do on the ice without extensive training, whereas a hockey player has to combine skating with a variety of other skills, again something a figure-skater probably couldn't do easily or well.

""Daniel who?"" you might be asking. I admit it. In America, if you were to mention Daniel Geale, chances are you will elicit blank stares.

Yet, of all middleweights *not* named Martinez, Geale has composed the best middleweight resume. He's already held the WBA, IBF, and IBO titles. In addition, here's who he's beaten:

* Anthony Mundine
* Felix Sturm
* Sebastian Sylvester
* Osumanu Adama
* Roman Karmazin

To put things into perspective, 4 of these fighters are former world titlists. One of them (Adama) is a perpetual contender who *could* still win a title in the right circumstances. 

But I'm not writing this post to pump up Geale but to note something interesting about HBO's schedule. With Geale added to the line-up, HBO now has 4 of the 5 best middleweights in the world in their stable: Sergio Martinez, Gennady Golovkin, Julio Cesar Chavez Jr., and Daniel Geale. Peter Quillin — who I regard to be better than Chavez — is a Showtime fighter.

When you factor is the super middleweight division, things get more interesting. Andre Ward has cleared out the super middleweight division. Other than a rematch with Carl Froch, who's he going to fight?

The opportunity for additional rivalries is exciting. We all know that Golovkin packs a punch, but how will he do against the superhuman chin of Chavez Jr.? Or what will happen when the counterpunching of Martinez meets the volume punching of Geale? If one man clears out the division, are we bound for a superfight against Ward?

Either way, now that Showtime essentially owns the 140-154lb weight divisions, it looks like HBO is locking up anything between 160-175lbs. Do you think this tactic will work?",,False,,t5_2qj0l,False,,,True,t3_1kfugn,http://www.reddit.com/r/Boxing/comments/1kfugn/this_weekend_the_middleweight_division_is_about/,

I'd love for him to move up in weight class and murder Froch.  After he takes care of the englishman I think we could see a fight vs Ward sometime in early 2014.  

I know these are pretty big weight jumps, but he looks like he has the frame for it, and the man is an absolute animal.  The Martinez fight is not something I want to see.  2002-2007 Martinez might have had a shot, but the broken down nearly 40 year old version would get carried out of the ring on a stretcher.

edit: GGG has said he will fight anyone from junior to super middleweight (154-168).  Obviously to get up to 168 he'd need a little bit extra training time, but at his height and with his arm length we aren't dealing with an undersized guy jumping weight classes (ala yuriorkis gamboa)

edit2:  Peter Quillan (29-0 21 kos) calls GGG out and says fight should be on pay per view (agreed on quality, but neither guy sells so this is destined for HBO saturday night fights if it happens)

Like many physical activities it also boosts fitness level, keep kids active, boosts, self-esteem and improves confidence levels.

**TO MY MAIN POINT**

With those facts in mind, how would I bring boxing as a **supervised** and **extracurricular** sport to a few highschools as a trial to prove that when under a careful watch and with proper equipment boxing can be just as productive as: football, soccer, hockey, baseball, and other contact or non-contact sports.

**EDIT**
According to the website I was provided thank you: [youhavethenerve](http://www.reddit.com/user/youhavethenerve) there have been no injuries (other than minor nose bleeds) in the four month span Frankilin Highschool boxing classes were open. This is the quote directly from the page: 

**Should I be worried about getting hurt?**

""No.  In our first year, we had roughly twenty members.  Over a four-month span, we have not had a single injury.  Our only health concern has been the occasional bloody nose.  In these cases, the match is stopped immediately so that bleeding does not continue and the blood can be dealt with in a medically appropriate manner.  Boxing club members train and spar under the direct supervision of Mr. Bickford, who is trained in first aid.  Students are not allowed to spar without the appropriate protective equipment (mouth guard, headgear, gloves, and athletic supporter).  Students have the option of stopping a match at any time they feel unable to continue.  As an additional precaution, students are required to have a sport physical and the appropriate insurance paperwork filled out prior to the season to insure that they are fit to participate.""

It's not about how often you win or lose, it's *who* you fight and *how* you win or lose.

Case in point: last week, Delvin Rodriguez 26(14)-6-3 fought George Tahdooahnippah 31-0-1. I predicted that Rodriguez was going to win by wide margins. A few people were surprised. How is it that I would pick the fellow with 6 losses over the guy who's undefeated? I'll tell you how. I knew how good of a fighter Rodriguez was.

Not only did Rodriguez win last week, he scored a TKO6 — and many thought the fight should have ended sooner.

This anecdote aside, there's lots of fighters who are surprisingly good but have ugly-looking records. There's many reasons for this. They may be late bloomers, or they were robbed a few times on the scorecards, or they didn't have a manager who brought them up carefully. 

Think of this list, therefore, as the anti-Floyd list. These guys have been defeated — but they've kept fighting and proved their worth. Most of these guys are either current titlists, recent titlists, or serious contenders.

The recent WBO titlist who KOed Juan Manuel Lopez in one of the most stunning upsets in recent memory. One year later, he repeated the same feat.

**2. Sam Soliman - 43(17)-11**

On an 8 fight win streak, capped by defeating Felix Sturm for the final IBF eliminator. This guy earned his shot!

**3. Gamaliel Diaz - 37(17)-9-2**

Current WBC super featherweight titlist who recently shocked the world by defeating Takahiro Ao. Also the only man to have defeated Robert Guerrero.

**4. Mario Rodriguez - 15(11)-6-4**

Current IBF minimumweight titlist, and ranked #1 by Boxrec. His 4 last fights were won by KO, capped by a KO7 win against former #1 Nkosinathi Joyi.

**5. Sonny Boy Jaro - 34(24)-11-5**

Former lineal flyweight champion who KOed the legendary Pongsaklek Wonjongkam. He then lost his WBC title to Toshiyuki Igarashi by SD — some would say controversially.

**6. Jesus Soto Karass - 27(17)-8-3**

Gave Mike Jones all he could handle, went to war against Marcos Maidana and Gabriel Rosado, then recently outboxed former WBC Silver titlist Selcuk Aydin.

**7. Rolly Matsushita - 31(19)-8**

Current OPBF titlist who's on a 6 fight win streak, winning all by KO. He and Shinsuke Yamanaka are on a collision course.

**8. Carson Jones - 34(24)-9-3**

The dude responsible for wrecking Said Ouali and Ricardo Williams Jr.'s careers. He almost did the same to Kell Brook when he lost be close MD in an IBF eliminator.

**9. Michael Domingo - 45(24)-16-2**

This guy hasn't had a clear loss since 2006. His losses to Drian Francisco and Vusi Malinga were to close for comfort. Constantly hovering near title contention.

**10. Raymundo Beltran - 27(17)-6**

Famous as Manny Pacquiao's sparring partner. Lately, he's claimed big victories over Hank Lundy and Ji-Hoon Kim. His last two losses against Luis Ramos Jr. and Sharif Bogere were close and controversial. Hopefully, he'll get his shot at a title soon.",,False,,t5_2qj0l,False,,,True,t3_190inr,http://www.reddit.com/r/Boxing/comments/190inr/top_10_p4p_fighters_with_uglylooking_records/,

## Jermell Charlo vs. Harry Joe Yorgey
***Round 1:*** Thus far, this is a battle of the jabs. Both men believe in theirs, and are utilizing it to create their openings. Got to give this to Charlo because he's landed more.

10-9 Charlo

***Round 2:*** Charlo with more great jabs. And then Yorgey goes down! Only for the second time in his career! Yorgey gets up, but Charlo begins blasting him with tremendous handspeed. Great round!

10-8 Charlo, 20-17 Charlo

***Round 3:*** Yorgey now getting more cautious. He's barely moving beyond his high guard. But impressively, Charlo's jab is stiff enough to get through. If this is your first time watching Charlo, you're in for a treat.

10-9 Charlo, 30-26 Charlo

***Round 4:*** Yorgey is amping up his aggressiveness with some lateral movement. Bad idea. Charlo's stiff jabs get through and stagger him to the corner. Charlo is getting aggressive now — much more aggressive than in previous fights. I think he can close the show.

10-9 Charlo, 40-35 Charlo

***Round 5:*** Got to agree with Bernstein. Charlo is getting a little too patient here — to his detriment. In fact, he's letting Yorgey back into this fight. However, got to say, Charlo's still win this on workrate and accuracy.

10-9 Charlo, 50-44 Charlo

***Round 6:*** Great right hands to start the round by Charlo. Yorgey ain't reacting well to it. But to his credit, Yorgey continues to come forward and look for opportunities. Charlo pumping that jab whenever he comes close, though.

10-9 Charlo, 60-53 Charlo

***Round 7:*** What can I say? Another great round by Charlo. If I were to criticize Charlo it would be that he seems to lack a killer instinct. He doesn't seem all that eager to end the fight.

10-9 Charlo, 70-62 Charlo

***Round 8:*** Looks like Charlo's patience payed off. He sent a few jabs, followed up with a right, and — BAM! — knockdown! Yorgey stays down, hopes to collect his senses, rises just at the count of eight, but it's clear his head isn't clear. Bayless stops the fight.

**Official Result** Charlo KO8 Yorgey

## Selcuk Aydin vs Jesus Soto Karass
***Round 1:*** Both fighters are doing excellent work. For Karass to win this, he'll have to stay at range. Yeah, good luck with that. Aydin has dinosaur arms, so he has no hope but to go inside. Shouldn't be a problem with Karass, though. I'm liking Karass' body work here. Giving this round to him.

10-9 Karass

***Round 2:*** Karass with the first meaningful punch — a hard right that connects with Aydin's head. Aydin's jab being unexistent. Looks like he's always loading up on the right. Karass having much more of an arsenal here with jabs and good work to the body.

10-9 Karass, 20-18 Karass

***Round 3:*** Aydin doing better work this round. He's begun to find his range, utilize his jab, and find a home for his right. If he can be a little bit more active, he could actually start winning this fight. As it is, though, Karass is still coming forward and being more busy.

10-9 Karass, 30-27 Karass

***Round 4:*** I think I got to disagree with the SHO announcers. I think Aydin's doing the better work this time. He's got a great hook that's connecting to Karass, and he's hitting him hard with the overhand right. Still, I admit that Karass is busier and the aggressor.

10-9 Aydin, 39-37 Karass

***Round 5:*** Both are doing what they're supposed to do. But since Karass has an enormous physical advantage, it's obvious that he's able to do better things at a distance. But once again, I love Aydin's overhands.

10-9 Karass, 49-46 Karass

***Round 6:*** Karass with the greater arsenal here. I'm not going to say what has already been said in other rounds.

10-9 Karass, 59-55 Karass

***Round 7:*** Malignaggi makes a good point about Aydin. Usually, Aydin forces the fight. He gets in, he does his work. But this fight, Aydin for some reason is trying to fight at the distance — despite being the shorter fighter with the shorter reach.

10-9 Karass, 69-64 Karass

***Round 8:*** This is clearly Aydin's best round. He got some hard combos on Karass' head. Not once, but quite a few times in this round. What's more, he's also beginning to time when Karass is coming in then get in his own licks.

10-9 Aydin, 78-74 Karass

***Round 9:*** Great round for both! Yet, I think Aydin's done an excellent job of outboxing Karass this time. He's got the 1-2 combo well. He's pivoting away from the ropes. And he's timing Karass. Wish he did this earlier.

10-9 Aydin, 87-84 Karass

***Round 10:*** Call me a coward, but I think both of them did excellent. Karass had great jabs and body shots. As for Aydin, great hooks and timing, and some tremendous footwork causes Karass to work. To make it harder to score, both had some money shots right at the end. I'm scoring it for both.

10-10, 97-94 Karass

**Official Results** Scores: 95-95, 97-93, 97-93. Karass MD Aydin

## Lucas Matthysse vs. Mike Dallas Jr.
***Round 1:*** Dallas Jr starting off the round tactfully. Using his jab, he attempts to keep Matthysse at bay. When Matthysse corners him, Dallas Jr., holds. Just as it seems as though Dallas Jr. looks to survive the round — BAM! — a short counter right by Matthysse connects. Lights out for Dallas Jr. WOW! What a statement!

There's not a week that goes by where there's not some discussion on /r/Boxing about who would win and how. Well, I think it's time to put up or shut up. Think you know lots about boxing? Let's see how you do in an /r/Boxing Prediction League.

Here's the preliminary rules (to be further fleshed out later with feedback from all of you):

1. If you predict the correct outcome (W-L-D), that's worth 1 point.
2. If you predict the correct result (UD, SD, MD, KO, etc.), that's worth 2 points.
3. If you predict the correct round a KO happens, that's worth 3 points.
4. If you predict the correct score of one of the judges, that's worth 3 points.
5. ~~If you predict the correct score of two judges, that's worth 6 points.~~
6. ~~If you predict the correct score of all three judges, that's worth 9 points.~~
7. Results will be published weekly.
8. The winner will be declared at the end of each month.
9. Any altered comment or prediction will be discarded.

To keep things simple, all fights eligible for the /r/Boxing Prediction League will be posted in each weekly Fight Previews post (located on the sidebar).

Participating is simply a matter of posting your predictions on each official /r/Boxing Prediction League thread — posted every Wednesday.

Let me know if you're interested, and what further adjustments should be made to these (very) barebones rules.

Cheers!
***
**EDIT:** As per noiragent's suggestion, I'm striking off rules 5 and 6.

I'm also adding another rule per Sonoluminescent's feedback: 

10. any altered predictions (e.g., ones with asterisks) shall be discarded.

***
**Edit2:** 

11. For a fight to be eligible, it must be broadcast on television and accessible by /r/Boxing *before* results are tabulated.


**Edit3:**

12. If a fight is controversial by a vast majority of /r/Boxing, put an asterisk next to the results. This doesn't change the standing in the Prediction League but simply points out that there is controversy.",,False,,t5_2qj0l,1354313328.0,,,True,t3_1403vp,http://www.reddit.com/r/Boxing/comments/1403vp/whos_interested_in_an_rboxing_prediction_league/,moderator

## Wladimir Klitschko vs. Mariusz Wach

***Round 1:*** Klitschko's not monkeying around today. He's already throwing the right at Wach, tagging him hard on the chin. Wach seems to slow and sluggish to land anything of consequence, though he got in a few jabs. Klitschko's dominating.

10-9 Klitschko

***Round 2:*** Wach gets in a few lucky shots here and there, but nothing of consequence. Klitschko gets in more great right hands, a few down the middle. Klitschko's putting on a clinic here. Just amazing defense.

10-9 Klitschko, 20-18 Klitschko

***Round 3:*** I'm impressed Wach finished the round. Klitschko's sending out more jabs to soften Wach up for the right. He's also got in some decent left hooks too. Wach isn't able to touch Klitschko with the jab, but he's surviving.

10-9 Klitschko, 30-27 Klitschko

***Round 4:*** This is just target practice for Klitschko. Not that Wach isn't trying, but when he tries to get inside, Klitschko ties him up. Wach expressed frustration by rabbit punching Klitschko — perhaps trying to make this a dirty fight. But Klitschko is beating him clean.

10-9 Klitschko, 40-36 Klitschko

***Round 5:*** Wach does his best impression of a human punching bag when — WHOA! WACH TAGS KLITSCHKO! GOOD GOD! HE WAS SAVED BY THE BELL!

10-9 Wach, 49-46 Klitschko

***Round 6:*** Wow. This fight has gotten more dramatic. Wach has quite a chin, just waiting for the right opportunity before coming in with the chopping right. Klitschko's hitting Wach with everything he has — trying to end this fight early. He's winning it on workrate now.

10-9 Klitschko, 59-55 Klitschko

***Round 7:*** You can tell that Wach feels his chin holds up to Klitschko's power. He's waking right into Klitschko's punches to counterpunch with his own right. When he connects, it's pretty hard. But Klitschko is blitzing him with beautiful combos. He's beating Wach cleanly once again

10-9 Klitschko, 69-64 Klitschko

***Round 8:*** This is like Rocky — and Wach is like Rocky. He's finished the round while Klitschko throws everything at him. Wach isn't thowing enough, but Klitschko's trying to end this. Now.

10-8 Klitscho, 79-72 Klitschko

***Round 9:*** Well, Klitschko's either tired or he's taking a breather. Or both. Still dominating. Still hurting Wach. But Wach is now getting more punches in and being pretty damn competitive. Wach's got quite the chin.

10-9 Klitschko, 89-81 Klitschko

***Round 10:*** Klitschko's changing his tactics. He's now on the back foot, waiting for Wach to come in range, and unleash his right. Wach continues to walk forward and get his licks in. More domination by Klitschko.

10-9 Klitschko, 99-90 Klitschko

***Round 11:*** Well, Wach ain't being KOed tonight. He's nowhere close to Klitschko's level, though. Klitschko is peppering him with 1-2s, jabs, rights, and the occasional hook. Boxing beautifully.

10-9 Klitschko, 109-99 Klitschko

***Round 12:*** Klitschko resigns to Wach not being KOed. He's boxing, getting out of range, peppering Wach with good hard shots. Wach keeps coming forward, trying to fight back — but let's be honest. Klitschko wins this.

10-9 Klitschko, 119-108 Klitschko

I normally watch fights either in a nearby sports bar or by ordering with a few friends at someone's house. This time I decided to go to watch it at a movie theater when I saw Dan Rafael of ESPN write about it.

Bought the ticket online a few days in advance to make sure I could get in. Ticket cost $18 plus some processing/tax BS, so it was just shy of $20. A little more than I though it'd be, but still cheaper than the $20 cover the bar usually charges. This was at a big theater in the metro-DC area, so the theater itself was relatively full (I'd say 90% of the seats were taken) with lots of Mayweather fans. Showed up just after 9pm, start of the 2nd round of the Latimore-Quintana fight, and were able to find some decent seats though the place was already filling up.

The whole experience was pretty awesome, really. Huge screen with high quality, great audio, and a comfortable chair to sit in. Lots of knowledgeable boxing folks around (since most casual fans probably just go to a bar, the theater crowd seemed like more dedicated boxing enthusiasts), so the place was full even for the undercards.

The only thing that sucked a little bit about it is food wasn't as easily available and there's no alcohol served, of course. Didn't bother me much because I'm not a big drinker, but if you're the type that likes to watch fights with an enormous pile of nachos and a constant flow of beer, this might not be for you (or you'll have to find a place that serves alcohol too).

So all in all, thumbs up for the experience and I'd recommend it for anyone who doesn't care about drinking while watching.",,False,,t5_2qj0l,False,,,True,t3_tb6pb,http://www.reddit.com/r/Boxing/comments/tb6pb/my_experience_watching_mayweathercotto_in_a_movie/,

He's got speed -- and speed is a killer. He puts together beautiful combos. And more importantly, he can swarm.

His two weaknesses are:

* Lack of defense. Thankfully, this can be fixed.

* Short stature -- but this can actually be beneficial for his style.

So is Seth legit? He might if he's able to beat Timur Ibragimov this Saturday. While Ibragimov is not a world beater, he's a dangerous gatekeeper who can separate the wheat from the chaff.

If Mitchell wins, he'll be my leading prospect -- especially now that Robert Helenius was gifted a decision over Chisora, and Tyson Fury has given me question marks during his past two bouts.

**Where is it?** Reliant Arena - Houston, TX

**TV Network/Show** HBO - Boxing After Dark

**What's the big deal?** What if Mike Tyson had a son who became a professional boxer? Picture this son having a prestigious WBC world title belt, a 43-0-1 record, with 30 KOs. Now imagine on top of that if Mike Tyson's son was bigger than his father, and was not afraid to take a few shots in order to dish out his own. Would you watch his next fight?

Well, of course you would. Hence why Mexicans want to watch Julio Cesar Chavez Jr. -- whose father is considered *the* greatest Mexican fighter in history.

Here's the dirty secret about JCC Jr., though: he's not that great. Don't get me wrong, he's not that bad either -- but he's definitely not as good as his record indicates. JCC Jr. has been coddled for most of his career, protected from fighters who might expose his weaknesses -- with Top Rank milking his family name for all its worth in the hope that they can get an enormous payout of it.

Normally, this would make for a terrible fight, but in matching JCC Jr with Peter Manfredo Jr., they might have made a terrible mistake.

Peter Manfredo Jr. is what I like to call a ""lunch pail"" fighter. He holds a day job as a labourer, supporting his wife and three children. Most famous for being a contestant on the first season of *The Contender*, Manfredo has simply been that his whole career -- challenging for titles again and again during his career, but (almost) always coming up short. His most famous try was in 2007 against Joe Calzaghe.

Manfredo has been in the ring with some great fighters -- and he knows JCC Jr. isn't one of them. He believes he can beat JCC Jr., that he can be the spoiler, the one who pops the hype bubble.

This is probably Manfredo's last chance at a title. It also may be the last time he gets a payday like this. If he fails against JCC Jr., his career is over -- and may retire. If he wins, it will be the greatest moment in his career.

**What about the undercard?** Won't lie, the undercard sucks. It's Joshua Clottey vs. Calvin Green. Clottey hasn't fought since his March 2010 PPV against Manny Pacquiao. As for Green, his last two fights were losses against Alfonso Gomez and Sergio Mora.

One decent thing about this fight is that Green gives his all every time and tries to make it a fight. Good luck trying to do that against Clottey, though.

**Predictions** Let's face it, a whole bunch of people want JCC Jr. to win. If he does, his next fight could very well be against Saul Alvarez -- Mexico's other big name draw. For this reason if it goes to the cards, it's probably a win for JCC Jr.

With a KO rate of 47%, it's not beyond the realm of possibility that Manfredo could gain a win by stoppage. That's what he'll need to do to win this. However, due to Chavez' decent chin, this is unlikely.

As for Clottey-Green, Clottey will have had to grow old overnight to lose that fight.

**Rating** B-. The actual fight might not deliver. The undercard sucks. But what can I say? I'm a sucker for a good story -- and the story behind this fight is pretty compelling.",,False,,t5_2qj0l,True,,,True,t3_mgkys,http://www.reddit.com/r/Boxing/comments/mgkys/preview_julio_cesar_chavez_jr_vs_peter_manfredo_jr/,

Immediate rematch with Floyd (I'd reckon thats in the contract). Say it happens, he beats him again. Canelo is pronounced Lord Jehova of the Boxing Ring. Who does Canelo fight? He has like 10-15 more  years of boxing left.

is GGG signed with top rank? What if GGG fights Martinez, wins, around the same time as ""Mayweather vs Canelo, Number Two's battle versus Number One to become the One, one more time."" 

Martinez retires after the loss to GGG. GGG is middleweight king, Canelo the young hungry lion wants to fight GGG because he's like bitch I just beat Floyd Mayweather, you aint shit. Around the same time as the GGG Canelo Showdown, Andre Ward beats JCC Jr for the second time.

Golden Gennady Golovkin versus the Golden Goose of Golden Boy happens. GGG KO's Canelo in the later rounds. 

GGG in a gentleman-like fashion tells the world, ""Canelo is a good, great, strong boy, ehhh he's good boy, but today I great strong man, (laughs). No I joke but he's great fighter, good champion, Andre Ward motha fucka we finna fight in Oakland.""

GGG vs Andre Ward,  The Son of God versus the Khazak King, there can only be One, One, and we'll find out which One is the ONE. GGG KO's Ward in round one, Virgil Hunter says he threw a thumb at him. Matthysse is in the crowd and secretly moved up to 160 LBs ( He has already ended Khans and Garcia's Careers, twice); maintaining his strength, speed, and conditioning. He walks into the ring and looks GGG in the eyes, GGG looks him in the eyes and they both know it must happen.

The Machine versus The Glorious Golden Gennady Golovkin. It is virtually even fight, every reporter and judge has it tied. In the final 12 seconds of the 12th round, Matthysse and Golovkin land twelve blows at 12:12 leading to the KO of each other. Their bodies ascend from the ring and they Walk through the Sky and traverse Mount Olympus. 

They Challenge Zeus and Ares. They both land hooks that crush Zeus' and Ares' rib cages, leading to uppercuts which rip their jaws off. Matthysse and Golovkin pick up the fallen Gods bodies and cast them out of the heavens. A new Era is born.

Anyone else think that this is going to happen?

1353031565.0,18,self.Boxing,139x8x,Prospect Watch: Seth Mitchell,22,4,3,http://www.reddit.com/r/Boxing/comments/139x8x/prospect_watch_seth_mitchell/,"If you're a fan of American heavyweights, there's not much to cheer for recently. Deontay Wilder's been busy fighting tomato cans, Joe Hanks is receiving almost no hype, and Dominic Breazeale just turned pro. 

For now, the Great American Hope is Seth Mitchell who's moving ever close to title contention. But who is he?

Mitchell's first love is actually not boxing, but football. He was a linebacker for Michigan State, recording 103 tackles in a single season. Unfortunately for him, his dreams of being a pro football player were quashed in 2005 due to damaged cartilage in his knee.

It looked like Mitchell's athletic career was over, but fate intervened when he saw a former opponent, Tom Zbikowski, have success in his boxing debut. Sensing that he too could have success as a boxer, in 2006, he stepped in the boxing ring for the first time as an amateur — eventually compiling a record of 9(9)-1. 

In 2008, Mitchell turned pro. He began turning heads, and after his 2nd pro fight, he signed with Golden Boy Promotions. The next two years were spent testing his mettle against veteran journeymen Andrew Greeley, Jermell Barnes, and Zack Page — and continuing his undefeated record.

Then in 2010, on the undercard of Khan-Maidana, Mitchell gained more exposure in the public eye by KOing Taurus Sykes in the 5th round. Boxing enthusiasts began salivating about the possibility that — finally — there *might* be an American prospect capable of winning a heavyweight title.

Mitchell followed this up in 2011 with KO wins against Evans Quinn, Hector Ferreyro, and Timur Ibragimov.

In his last fight against Chazz Witherspoon, Mitchell encountered adversity for the first time in his career. Witherspoon hurt Mitchell midway through Round 1 with a right hand and connected with a few more. This resulted in Mitchell being on wobbly legs and being *close* to a stoppage defeat. Thankfully, he had the wherewithal to hold on and stay on his feet until the bell rang.

After recovering, Mitchell came back with hardworking aggression, punishing Witherspoon to the body. The work eventually paid off in Rd. 3 when Mitchell sent Witherspoon down with a left hook. While Witherspoon was able to beat the count, the ref was eventually forced to stop the fight when it was apparent that Witherspoon was defenseless.

Having fought through adversity, the question now is whether Mitchell has learned from the experience. It's apparent that Mitchell has all the physical tools, but does he have the mental tools to compete at the elite level?

We will find out when Mitchell faces off against Johnathan Banks (28(18)-1) this Saturday on the undercard of HBO's Broner-DeMarco main event. Mitchell is facing off against a former IBO cruiserweight with a formidable ring IQ — a boxing intellect appreciated by Wladimir Klitschko who hired Banks to man his corner during his last fight. Banks does not lose easily — his only loss being to Tomasz Adamek (right now rated as the #3 heavyweight by RING Magazine). 

As stated, Mitchell has tremendous physical gifts. In his last fight, he weighed 241½lbs with not an ounce of fat on him. He has a 73% KO ratio, with 12 of his 13 last fights ending by stoppage. If he can match ring wits with Johnathan Banks, he probably has a tremendous future in boxing.

On Saturday, more boxing fans will see if the Great American Hope is good enough to offer them hope.",,False,,t5_2qj0l,1353031747.0,,,True,t3_139x8x,http://www.reddit.com/r/Boxing/comments/139x8x/prospect_watch_seth_mitchell/,

Basically, I'm going to tell you what the schedule is for this week's fights and give you a few notes.

##Friday, August 16
# **Network:** ESPN2 @ 9PM ET
# **Matches:** Andrzej Fonfara vs Gabriel Campillo; Artur Szpilka vs Mike Mollo II

Fonfara is a local Chicago favourite who's holding the IBO title. Here he's hoping to gain some credibility against the very capable Campillo who's performed well against the likes of Tavoris Cloud and Beibut Shumenov. Problem is, his last match against Tommy Karpency left a lot to be desired.

But the real reason to tune into ESPN2 is for Szpilka-Mollo II. [The first fight was a humdinger](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gmhoMtkOa8s). If it is only half as good as the first fight, it will be worth it.

## Saturday, August 17
# **Network:** BoxNation (UK) @ 2:00PM ET
# **Match:** Nathan Cleverly vs Sergey Kovalev

I got to be honest with you. I feel Kovalev is going to starch Cleverly. To me, Cleverly is one of the weakest titlists in boxing — so I'm really expecting Kovalev by KO3.

BUT... perhaps I'm wrong about Cleverly. After all, he's taking a really risky fight here because he's convinced this will be his ""Lacy moment"". So props to him.

***
# **Network:** HBO / Sky Sports (UK) @ 9:45 pm EDT 
# **Match:** Daniel Geale vs Darren Barker

The middleweight with the best resume after Sergio Martinez is *not* Gennady Golovkin, it's Daniel Geale. He has beaten both Sebastian Sylvester and Felix Sturm in Germany — and gained the WBA and IBF titles in the process. This is impressive stuff. 

So now he's making his American debut on HBO. Perhaps he's lined up for an eventual showdown against Martinez or Gennady Golovkin. 

But first, he must convincingly beat the very capable Darren Barker — who performed exceedingly well against Martinez previously.

*Cleverly-Kovalev will also be shown on tape delay.*

# **Network:** FOX Deportes / Televisa (MEX) @ 10:00 pm EDT
# **Match:** Takashi Miura vs Sergio Thompson

Fuck yeah! Thompson is the guy who essentially ended Jorge Linares career. Previously, he was thought to be a career journeyman but it's quickly become apparent he is a formidable puncher. 

He's getting his first title shot too, and he might just win it. Miura is a credible WBC super featherweight titlist, but Thompson has game-changing power.",,False,,t5_2qj0l,False,,,True,t3_1kejbd,http://www.reddit.com/r/Boxing/comments/1kejbd/this_weeks_boxing_schedule/,
