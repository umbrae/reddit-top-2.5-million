In the scene where Hans Landa is eating the strudel with Shoshanna, (link [here](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lydYhl1982Y)), there's one little detail that seems... off to me.

Take a look at [fork etiquette](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eating_utensil_etiquette#Fork_etiquette), courtesy of Wikipedia.  There's the European style:

&gt;The European style, also called the continental style, is to hold the fork in the left hand and the knife in the right. Once a bite-sized piece of food has been cut, it is conducted straight to the mouth by the left hand. The tines remain pointing down.

And the American style:

&gt;In the American style, also called the zig-zag method, the knife is initially held in the right hand and the fork in the left. Holding food to the plate with the fork tines-down, a single bite-sized piece is cut with the knife. The knife is then set down on the plate, the fork transferred from the left hand to the right hand, and the food is brought to the mouth for consumption. The fork is then transferred back to the left hand and the knife is picked up with the right.[3][7] In contrast to the European hidden handle grip, in the American style the fork is held much like a spoon or pen once it is transferred to the right hand to convey food to the mouth.

Now, there's nothing right or wrong with either method, but watch that scene (go to right about two minutes in).  The waiter puts the cream on top of the strudel.  We see Shoshanna take a bite, using the European style of utensil-handling, as expected.  Then the camera switches to Hans Landa, SS officer, ""Jew Hunter,"" 100% pure German, and there he is with the fork pointed up in his right hand, shoveling strudel into his mouth like he was having Apple Pie on a Fourth of July picnic.  The American style.

My first thought was that this was an accident, which was disappointing for this movie; there's so much attention to regional dialects, customs, even the finger placement to make a ""three"" was a major plot point.  And yet here's the primary German character eating like an American.  Must have been an oversight.

*However*, I then realized that the actor who plays Hans Landa, [Christoph Waltz](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christoph_Waltz), is Austrian-German.  I don't know how universal this European fork etiquette is, but it seems safe to guess that if Christoph Waltz is out of character and eating a strudel, he's got his fork firmly planted in his left hand.

So why the American style fork etiquette for Hans Landa?  My only other idea, and this is just an idea, is that maybe it goes back to the start of the movie, when he's talking about why he's so good at hunting Jews.  He talks about his ability to ""think like a Jew,"" and ""get inside their head.""  Maybe here he's trying to find the Basterds now, and to do that he needs to think like an American, which for him means doing everything possible in the American fashion?  I don't know.  Just speculation.

It could be nothing, but it's a little detail that bugs me every time I watch this movie, and I'd love to hear some other opinions on it.",,False,self,t5_2s9pe,False,,,True,t3_1c1is0,http://www.reddit.com/r/plotholes/comments/1c1is0/inglourious_basterds_strudel_scene/,
1360912756.0,53,self.plotholes,18kk79,Men In Black Movies. Several Issues. ,62,9,34,http://www.reddit.com/r/plotholes/comments/18kk79/men_in_black_movies_several_issues/,"Recently rewatched these. Noticed a few issues, mostly discrepancies between 1 and 3.

* So in 3, present day K is grumpy, never laughs or anything, so much so that it annoys J. In 1, he smiles/jokes a lot. Tells him jokes at a Chinese place, chats with worm guys, laughs at Zedd's ""bring a sponge"" line. If anything, J is the grumpy one in 1.  3 blames K's grumpiness on an event that predates J... so he should be quite grumpy at the beginning of 1. Given, he's no bag of sunshine, but he's not the emotionless rock we see in the beginning of 3. 


* Agent O. Where is she in 1 &amp; 2? Supposedly she and K were an ""item"" and old friends. Strange she wasn't around for 1 or 2, and if K was so into O, then why is he zooming in on the lady he never brought flowers to? Why isn't young K sad about her? 


* Agent D. (Guy K neuralizes at the beginning of 1) Where is he in 3?  Supposedly he's a founding member, but nowhere to be found when it shows MIB in the 60's.



* In 2, K is known as J's mentor... ""the guy who taught him everything he knows,"" -Frank the pug.  J was in MIB for 2 days before he neuralized K. Not much of a mentor. 



* There is a sequence in 3 that, according to the movie's own rules of time travel, couldn't have worked out the way it did.  It's when J and Boris the animal are fighting on top of the launch tower in Cape Canaveral. At one point J runs at him, times out his spike launch attacks, grabs him, jumps off, time jumps (with Boris) roughly one minute backwards, the scene resets, and he is able to dodge Boris's spike attacks.  What would have really happened is upon arrival into one minute ago, there would have been two Js (one with spikes in his arms, one about to receive them) and two Bor... Bori? Borises? :)  Either way, that bit was a flagrant error.  They would have come upon themselves about to jump off... not just reset. It's an individual time machine, not a universe rewind thing like in Click.   I mean of course time travel ALWAYS has faults in movies, I just though this one was crazy. Heck, even if it could happen that way, say the little gadget has modes, Boris would remember traveling back one minute and attack differently... AND EVEN IF he had forgotten, J would have as well, and things would have worked the exact same as if they'd never time jumped.

It's implied in the movie that they extracted some information about Clark from her mind because she says something to the effect of ""Sorry, I didn't mean to tell them but, they read my mind"".  But we find out that is completely pointless because Clark responds with ""It's OK, they did the same thing to me"".

If you could read Supermans mind, why would they even bother picking up Lois and locking her up in a room where she had access to fuck with their computer?

Also, Zod has already decided that they need to kill all the humans and make a new Krypton. Why do they bother locking Lois up? Why wouldn't they just kill her? 


2.Also, JorEl gave some pretty flimsy pretext for why they couldn't accompany their 3 hour old son on his interstellar trip.   
He apparently thought it was important enough for him to transfer his entire consciousness onto the railroad-spike USB dongle that he sent with his son, which he had no way of using unless he on the off-chance managed to stumble across the 20,000 year old scout ship frozen in ice in the Arctic, see a trianglular hole, and go ""I'd better shove my necklace into that thing and see what happens"". 

If it was important enough for you to save your consciousness to send with him, then he would have gotten off his high-horse and traveled to Earth with him. Or at least sent a note explaining what that weird metal spike was and how to use it, because apparently Kryptonians speak English as their native language. (Which I'm surprised they would call attention to this by showing Zod's transmission alternating in several Earth languages, highlighting the fact that they speak English arbitrarily)


3.Zod immediately decides that genocide is the only way to go, and his justification for this is that his people would ""spend years suffering"" trying to adapt to Earth's conditions even though Zod takes all of 30 seconds to get used to having xray vision and hearing for miles.


4.So... what are the rules of Supermans powers again?  

JorEl said that when his son absorbed the radiation from the yellow sun, he would have super powers. Ok cool.  

Zod shows up and takes Superman and Lois on board... Superman loses powers because of the atmosphere. Um.. Ok. I thought the powers were from the sun.  Ok, I guess you have to have Sun + Earth atmosphere to have super powers.

Zod and crew on Earth with respirators on, and have super powers. Ok, I fucking give up. Kryptonians have powers whenever it is convenient to the story.

Problem: to the extent that ""infiltration"" involves more than simply ""entering undetected"" -- the T-101 is a ridiculous design.

* despite its veneer of fake human skin, the machine still weighs a bajillion pounds; I may even remember the film playing this up for a laugh at one point by having him get into a car or something and having it tilt comically;

* Schwarzenegger barely passed for a human back then: he was about as big as a barn, and sounded like a neanderthal;

So, what's the ""infiltration"" scenario look like here?

Enormous, lumbering guy that nobody has ever seen before walks in from nowhere.

He (somehow) gets chummy with another guy, who then introduces him to the rest of the group.

""Hey guys, I want to you meet my new friend. He's great! He can do about a million push-ups, and he weighs more than all of us combined, but he asked for a 'hu-man beer' so he's alright in my book!""

""Cool! Let's take him back into the base and introduce him to the commander.""

""Yeah! And leave him unguarded!""

""Oh, hey, you better warn him about those new infiltration models headquarters just told us about -- I guess they look *just like us.*""

Now, I'm not a nuclear physicist so I'm going to accept those numbers as fact.

Batman says his goodbye to Catwoman, and then hops in his little helicopter/flying thing (hovercraft?). Do you remember what Fox said to Batman when he gave it to him? It was something along the lines of the fact that it was made for urban crowd control. He said urban something, which is what's going to be important in a moment. When he gets inside this thing, there's a shot of the clock on the bomb. It says something like 1:30, give or take 5-10 seconds. Okay. 

Batman flies out of the city, he gets over water. It's been around 30 seconds since we've seen the clock. 

Now, Batman flies out over the water and the bomb detonates. The thing he was flying was made for urban environments and there's no way it was built to go 360 miles per hour. The world record for the fastest helicopter is 299 mph and was set by the Sikorski X2.

There's a second plot hole tangentially related to this one. Let's say he get's six miles away and the bomb doesn't blow up over Gotham. Yippee.

People tend to forget that bombs explode in all directions because they're almost always just dropped from a plane or on the ground already at detonation; they ave nowhere to *go* but out.

So, it seems to me anyone with even a minimal training as a fighter would recognise these fights were too important for them to divide their strength between them.

Firstly: So, if Kryptonians can adapt within a few hours to Earth's atmosphere, why did Zod need to use that machine to transform it? He was a General, which means it's safe to assume he had some level of education, and that he would see the tactical advantage to inhabiting a planet on which Kryptonians were capable of flying and punching through rock.

Second, what was responsible for Kryptonians be able to perform those superhuman feats? Was it the atmosphere or the yellow sun radiation? Why would Superman get weaker just because of the Kryptonian atmosphere being created around the gravity machine? Wasn't he still being subjected to yellow sun radiation?

To that end, did the masks that Zod and his cohort of Kryptonian criminals wore block out the atmosphere, thereby preventing them from achieving the super-senses, or did the masks filter out the sounds, sights, and smells since they already had powers granted by the radiation of the yellow sun.

To me this seems ill defined in the movie, and the fact that Snyder and Nolan are both notorious for short sighted plot contrivances like this makes me think it's just not very well thought out.

BONUS: In the scene where Jim West shoots the assassins in the paintings, there is a gag where one assassin falls from the ceiling as Jim leaves. I'm pretty sure Jim never fires upwards.

After the Scarecrow sprays Rachel with the panic-inducing drug, we see Batman rushing her over to his Batcave as fast possible to give her the antidote. After he does so (just before he sedates her), he tells her that if he had taken any more time, she might have gone permanently insane.

Now, this took place approximately in the span of an hour. Later on, though, Ra's al-Ghul infects an entire island with the toxin, and we know from Fox that developing the antidote from the little vial will take several WEEKS. Gotham not only has to deal with an island full of panicked mofos and criminals until the antidote arrives, but the victims would have turned far insane by then.

Yoda consoled Anakin about his nightmares, so perhaps Yoda did a bit of one-on-one with everyone, therefore technically ""instructing"" them.

The time machine is unlike most similar sci-fi devices in that it relies on quantum technology and [multiverse theory](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiverse_theory). Basically, the device scans you and rebuilds you in France in an alternate universe where it happens to be the 14th century. The machine uses a quantum computer to do all the calculations, which achieves massive computational power by distributing the work onto a large number of computers in alternate universes.

1) *Timeline* contradicts itself as to whether there really are multiple universes.

The whole premise of the movie is that the company that built the machine stumbled upon an parallel universe 600 years in our past and decided to make the most of it. However the protagonists become involved when their professor travels through the machine and leaves them a message in their dig site.

Huge problem: How did anything he did in ""the past"" remain in place for them to find, since it all happened in an alternate universe/timeline? This isn't nitpicking. This is the inciting event for the entire story, based on details about the fiction provided by the author.

2) A quantum computer is used as a McGuffin and mostly ignored.

A quantum computer, if it actually existed, would change the world. It would break cryptography in half. It would perform currently-impossible calculations in short time. If a computer scientist invented the Holy Grail of computers, he would immediately (i) win international acclaim and prestige, (ii) drop all of these stupid side experiments with medieval France, (iii) become fabulously rich, and (iv) spend the rest of his career exploring and developing quantum technology.

* It's medieval Germany. They're using paper money.
* It's medieval Germany. Did they really have to put Gretel in pants? They couldn't find some kind of kickass medieval dress for her to wear? There is no way anyone would take her seriously when she's dressed like that.
* The newspapers are written in Early Modern English. I can overlook the English part, but judging by the architecture of the town, we're in a year that pre-dates Early Modern English.
* If being a Grant White Witch (or whatever it is that Hansel and Gretel's mother was) is inherited, why do the bad witches have to have Gretel's heart and not Hansel's? In the witches' sabbath scene, you can clearly see male witches so they obviously exist, and the ending implies that Hansel has magical powers, too. Is his poor diabetic heart just not good enough for the evil witches?

Anyway, what is the point of Deckard trying to kill the Nexus-6s? Tyrell knows they are almost at the end of their life and with Roy dying at the end it appears that all of them would have been dead within basically the same time frame had they just been left alone.

Is the implication that Tyrell was lying about there being no ""cure"" and without Deckard's harassment the replicants would have found it? If not, it seems like a pretty big plothole since the entire action of the movie is basically pointless and the characters knew it going in. The Nexus-6s were literally dropping dead within a few days of the start of the movie anyway.

I don't buy any kind of, ""it was all a test of the Nexus-7"" explanations, because I really think Tyrell would have planned it in a way that he lived.

Held up a lot better than I expected. But there's one thing that bugs me.

At the beginning of III, when *Enterprise* returns to Earth, Kirk makes it clear immediately that he wants to fix up the ship and take it back to Genesis. Soon after that, McCoy, in his addled, half-Spock state, tries to illegally hire a charter ship to take him back to Genesis.

But why do they want to go back? They're not expecting to get Spocks' body back; as far as they know, at this point it is currently scattered throughout Genesis's atmosphere. Remember, the crew of the *Grissom* was shocked to find the torpedo casing intact on the surface (""the gravity fields were in flux; it must have soft-landed""). As far as anyone knew, it should have burned up on entry. So what is on Genesis that they want?

When Sarek visits Kirk at his home, looking for Spock's *katra*, he wants Kirk to take it back to Vulcan. Why? I'm not sure. He obviously wasn't expecting to re-fuse Spock's soul with his body, because: a) Nobody knew at that point that Spock's body still existed, and b) as the high priestess said at the end of the movie, the re-fusion ritual ""has not been done since times past, and even then only in legend"". So I don't know exactly what Sarek planned. Perhaps the Vulcans have some sort of storage location where *katras* can be deposited, allowing the living to ""commune"" with the dead. But whatever his plans were, he clearly did not intend Kirk to go to Genesis.

So if the characters had behaved according to what they knew at the time, Kirk and McCoy would have hitched a ride to Vulcan, which would not have put anyone's career in jeopardy (they were all on shore leave anyway), and the young, resurrected Spock would have died on Genesis as it tore itself apart.

But that's not what happened. Kirk, McCoy and the crew stole the *Enterprise* and flew straight to Genesis, and only then did they discover that Spock had been brought back to life, at which point (after the nastiness with Kruge and the destruction of the *Enterprise*), they took him back to Vulcan and re-joined him with his *katra*.

But on the ship's first outing, on it's first enounter with an American sub, the American sub's sonar officer hears the unique sound and produces a strategy for tracking it, and not much later shows his ship's captain how he was able to detect the ship at various points across the sea.

Around the same time, Jack Ryan speaks to a US Submarine expert who tells him that ""We tried to build a caterpillar drive a few years ago, but were unable to make it work"".

He doesn't say it didn't make the ship move. He didn't say it was catastrophically unreliable. He just says that it didn't work.

Wouldn't *not being undetectable* fit into the category of ""not working""?

So yeah, it feels good that the Americans helped a few Russian Naval Officers defect.

But taking custody of the boat is completely pointless. It doesn't work because Dallas tracks it quite easily, and possibly it's exactly like something the US tried, but found that it was pointless.

OK, maybe just taking *any* Typhoon class sub into custody would be a victory for the US. But it's not like they scored some awesome new stealth weapon. They already know how to track it. And if the Russians figure out that the US grabbed it, then Typhoon 8 will probably have changes made to make it more undetectable.

Seems like it would be better to just let it go, let the Russians think they still have a prototype of an untrackable (but actually easily trackable) submarine drive system.

And as for worrying that he was going to ""approach the coast"" to fire on Washington or New York, that's pointless, because at the point where Dallas made actual contact with the Red October at the end of Red Route One, the Red October *was already* in range of NY and DC.

It feels like they needed to have the Daniels explosion scene, but then hit the 'reset' button on the action by separating Desh and Bourne in a really unnatural way.  With them separated, Desh can be chasing Parsons while Bourne follows and you can set up a really interesting chase scene.

We know that young Joe can't shoot old Joe at this distance. It's been stated earlier in the movie that young Joe's rifle has a range of up to 15 feet, but will miss everything further than that.

Then young Joe does some projection in his mind, and figures that if old Joe shoots Sara to try to get at Cid, that will give Cid enough time to run into the field, get on a train, and escape, eventually becoming the Rainmaker due to pent-up Looper rage.

This is not an updated memory or anything like that -- old Joe gets new memories when young Joe does something significantly different than the previous timeline, but it doesn't work the other way around. Young Joe certainly can't see the future. What's displayed is just young Joe's best guess as to what will happen.

It is also all kinds of stupid. Are we to believe that old Joe, who just murdered an entire building's worth of armed career gangsters, will be incapable of tracking down and shooting a five year old in a beet field? 

And even before we get to that, why can't old Joe just pistol whip that Sara bitch real quick and shoot Cid before he gets into the beet field?

And even before we get to that, assuming young Joe's objective is to prevent old Joe from killing Cid (he's warmed up to the little murderous monster for whatever reason) why doesn't he just shoot off his own hand? That will stump old Joe long enough to let Cid escape in the stupid universe of the movie.

And even before we get to that, young Joe's suicide doesn't really solve anything. At the beginning of the movie, before young Joe has allowed old Joe to escape from his Looper execution, the Rainmaker was already known to close all the loops in the future. So Cid's Rainmaker transformation has nothing to do with old Joe and young Joe. He's going to become the Rainmaker regardless of what happens in that field.

Ok, so the plot of Tron was the fact a computer was able to download **matter into data**, demonstrated by the opening of the movie when they download and upload an apple, later that night Flynn attempts to prove his programming prowess, interferes with Master Control so he downloads him into the computer to play the games.  

Movie happens, Flynn wins,  takes control of the company (for whatever reason, I mean he only made like 5 arcade games at the height of the 80's.  This company seems to be diversified into experimental physics, hyper intelligent artificial intelligence,  and arcade games.... But whatever). 

Now we ^effectively start the second movie, with a guy riding recklessly on a motorcycle weaving in and out of traffic, trucks, what have you.  Then he stops his company from releasing windows 8 for free or something (something completely inconsequential), and Allen telling him that his father attempted to contact him w/magic (No really the pager has been disconnected for years, and I doubt the same radio towers that comply with those frequencies still exist w/out some sort of HAM radio botnet.... Again whatever).

He enters [""The Grid""](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DdIdZwDqkmg&amp;hd=1#) ^bwoump ^bwoump^bwaum fights the bad guys from releasing his army of tracker cookies on the world.  Get's out, saving the ISO(Disney could have seriously gone to fucking anyone to come up with a better name instead of just goggling the file extension for a burned DVD image... But again whatever).

Did you catch that, not only did they just wash over the fact you cant create mass ([As stated here](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conservation_of_energy)), but they did not address the fact that teleportation technology exists in this universe.

Why are cars still around, why are people not teleporting all over the place.  Why has this tech not influenced society at all...  Really, why?

**TL/DR** Teleportation exists in this universe, but nobody cares... Not even FedEx.

They have spaceships and dropships(which don't even appear to have weapons themselves), but not a single goddamn tank. Although the plasma/acid shooting bugs would be able to eventually kill tanks, the most common bug uses its simple melee to kill humans, and would never be able to crack a tank.

Also, the invasion of the bug homeworld. I can only think of it in one way. It's as if on D-day the allies pointed at a random coast and said ""let's land there,"" they sent in nothing but marines without any naval or air support, and the Germans new they were coming.

That's great, that a 'kick' can transcend dreams [much like weather and gravity]

**SPOILERS**

While the show was very well done, ambitious and aesthetically pleasing, the story makes absolutely no sense to me! for just a FEW examples, how is it, that when the daughter dies, the weeks following NO one attempts to locate her (officials). A truant officer had come to the house before, saying that since she was missing school she would have to go to juvenile court if she wasn't back TOMORROW. weeks passed and nobody looked. And when the fumigator, or bug killer guy was killed in the crawlspace? his employer didn't think to check maybe at the LAST place he was? and the dad never thought it suspicious that the guy never came back to say that the job was done? and WHY could the ghosts kill people? that ruined the story! if the ghosts could cause physical harm to the living, why didn't they simply just kill everyone? i understand that some of them kept them there because they wanted the baby from the mom. But i mean there was a psychotic mass murderer living in the basement, I'm sure he would not have a specific agenda other than hack hack hack. they act autonomously for the most part, yet only the agenda of a select few out of the MANY are actually enacted! and if the dead can also communicate, verbally, physically with the living WHY DIDNT the maid just TELL someone that she wanted her body dug up from the back yard? would it have been that hard? that was her main want for most of the story, and she would beat around the bush, and try to conniving ploys to get people to make it so (the armenian guy). Also WHAT was the deal with the psychic lady? she came in like 3 episodes, and at the climax of her involvement with the principle characters, she offers some advice to the dead daughter, on how to rid some of the spirits of the house. Aaannnnnnddd. it doesn't fucking work, not only that but the spirit mocks her for trying stating it is an archaic play, and that it is superstitious silliness, so great so the psychic (I'm sorry medium) was a fraud. oh wait except for the fact that they spent the entire episode, showing her communicating telepathically with the dead girl, and knowing that she was dead, thus proving her as genuine. and on Halloween night, when they can all go out and run amok, how do they not kill anyone? or even get noticed? again going back to the original owner of the house, who was deranged, and psychotic, and enjoyed hacking up people. Also the ghosts could go into the yard, and interact with people passing in the street! how haven't people noticed? or why don't they stand in the street and yell for someone to come help them (i am referring to the once that have not yet realized that they are dead.  I have never been more infuriated, and captivated by a show in my whole life. someone any insight please?? maybe i just missed something, but yeah.

I feel like the show would have been perfect, if they would have made it so that the ghosts could not physically interact with their environments (with the ""Special"" exception of 2 or 3). and if once they had reached their individual needs, they would simply dissipate. for instance at the end when the woman who was was looking for her baby FINALLY gets a baby, she realizes that she is a terrible mother and perhaps, having a baby wasn't ACTUALLY what she needed. at this point she had her spiritual awakening, and then should have disappeared forever, moving on to the next world/ heaven/ afterlife what have you. same with Tate, who finally learned to love another person, and the root of his anger, and when the maid, finally had her body found, or when the mad doctor, was finally on the news for the boy dahlia (his dream was to become famous) same with the boy dahlia himself. Or when the gay couple realize that they do love each other, but just because they love each other doesn't mean that they belong together. i feel like this would have been a simple and effective solution, but for some reason they convoluted it, to the point that the story no longer held its own weight. Aaaand I'm done.

* When Jafar asks to be ""most powerful sorcerer in the world"", are we just meant to assume that there are other, more-powerful sorcerers than Jafar, because I thought that hypnosis thing with the staff was some pretty good magic. In our world (where I always believed the film took place), this wish would be tantamount to asking for a rabbit and a top hat with a false bottom, so why does Jafar become so powerful? No one else in the movie is even remotely magically-inclined, the only real difference are the magical artifacts (lamp, staff, carpet, etc).

* Jasmine already knew ""Prince Ali"" was Aladdin and she acts incredibly surprised when Jafar points it out again, even though all that actually happens is Aladdin's clothes change? I guess if Jafar had put him in an elephant costume, Jasmine would have believed he was a gross furry?

* So then, I guess tigers are just really well-behaved for princesses? Kind of seems like Jasmine would have been mauled a long time ago.

* When Aladdin was drowning, why couldn't Genie ""cheat on this one""? What would have happened? Clearly it's within his power to save Aladdin without him wishing for it and without repercussions, so what's the difference in this scenario? Does Genie really just want to go back into his lamp, so he needs Aladdin to finish off his wishes ASAP?

And the classic:

* Aladdin wished to be a prince (not to look or smell like a prince, but to BE a prince) with his first wish and in the end he is revealed to be ""nothing more than a common street rat"" by Jafar, shouldn't he have gotten a refund for that wish not coming true or comp points or something?

Why not check out the last place he was known to be? It's like no one even notices the guard disappeared. We then learn the guard has a family. Is anyone on earth interested in what happened to this man???

2) This is one of my all time favorite plot holes.

Naaah, nothing suspicious about five male adults who all appear to be shaken or nervous buying this stuff in presumabaly the middle of the night. Nothing to see here.

3) Boyd claims that bc he ""called the stripper personally"" that means no one knows she's there. Huh?? How does he come to that conclusion?? I'm no stripper expert but it seems logical that she would tell a girlfriend or fellow stripper that she's going to a vegas hotel room. But even if she didn't, it makes zero sense for Boyd to assume this.

4) The aformentioned electric saws? They definitely don't look like the type of electric saw it would take to dismember a human being. They looked more like something you would use to carve a turkey!

5) The guys were making so much noise that security was called. However, when the guard himself was screaming at the top of his lungs as he died, and the five guys screaming at the top of THEIR lungs as he died, that didn't seem to annoy anyone.

How did no one see Tony emerge from the water? granted the Helicopter that attacked was facing the other direction, but what about the multiple media helicopters that filmed his house crumble, that also filmed the missile hit his house, don't forget Pepper was standing overlooking the ocean the whole time, he wasn't exactly subtle it, loud rocket boosters in a shiny red and gold suit.

Another point that was never mentioned is why are the henchmen evil?, they were simply wounded army veterans who received traumatic injuries, who signed up to be part of a breakthrough scientific experiment to help regrow lost limbs, last time i checked that doesn't make you a psychotic murdering terrorist. and if this treatment did affect their minds, why was Pepper not affected, and why was nothing done to help them, they were after all people who suffered horrific injury's protecting their countries.

Also why was War Machine allowed onto air-force one with out any clearance especially after he was hacked prior, you think they would learn, since it was the president who was at risk after all.

Also since the attack on Tony's home was even caught on National television you would think jets would at least be scrambled into the air?

If he had an army of Automated suits in his house, why didn't he use those when fighting the mandarin, or at least us them when he was first attacked.

Lastly just a minor annoyance, if the bad guys had powers to heat them selves to 3000 degrees, how fortunate it was that they all were wearing fire retardant clothing.

So the first part of the film is the trailer that most people saw. Enterprise and crew are all on the planet Nibiru. Trying to save the planet from some form of volcano that is threatening the planet. Spock gets stuck in the volcano and the Enterprise could rescue him but would need to expose itself to native civilization to do so. Spock says, fuck that, it would violate the Prime Directive, just leave me. Naturally Kirk and Co blow it off and rescue Spock.  

Now at this point, I expected it to be revealed that the volcanic activity was caused by Starfleet by accident or that an enemy had done this to sabotage Starfleet in some way, which would mean that saving the planet wouldn't violate the Prime Directive, but no, turns out, they were on a survey mission. So wtf, did Spock just decide half way through the mission that he believes in the Prime Directive so much that he will give his life for it? I doubt he was reluctantly participating in the mission since he was the one who setup and delivered the cold fusion device to stop the volcanic activity?

While we're on that, how does a cold fusion device stop all volcanic activity?!? A cold fusion process theoretically isn't cold, its just not as hot as say the sun. And if it was fusing all that magma all at once, the amount of energy would be massive, so it probably destroy the planet anyway, so its not freezing the stuff, its not fusing it. What does it do?

The alien who watches the Enterprise takes off then proceeds to draw a PERFECT plan drawing of the Enterprise despite only seeing it for about 30 seconds from a handful of drawings. Ok fine, he's a alien, he can see holographic projections of everything in their head. But that's two times this film has used the ""its science fiction magic"" already in the first 5 minutes.

So then the main part of the film actually starts. Kirk gets removed from command of the Enterprise and is due to be sent back to the academy. From Captain to Cadet in 10 seconds, pretty impressive really, only matched by his going from Cadet to Captain in the time it takes to make a couple of slices of toast in the first film but whatever.  Bomb explodes in London, Starfleet, which by the way has been militarized since the last film as demonstrated by their new [Nazi-esque style uniforms] (http://scifanatic.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/stid-img-34.jpg) similar to the job that [ starship troopers uniforms](http://www.cinemaview.sk/fotogaleria/Hviezdna_pechota/obr4.jpg) did as a plot device used to communicate how serious their military is. The bombing results in a super secret meeting of Starfleets top brass, all the captains of the local ships etc, you know, the head of the snake... which would be a very tempting target... Now it seems that Kirk (who by the way, has managed to go from being a Cadet to Commander and first officer of the Enterprise in the time it took him to leave his debriefing and fall into the nearest bar and have a quick shot) is the only one with half a brain here, that they are actually the main target in the bombers. Cool, but I mean, they are in Starfleet HQ. They'd have at least a minimum level of security considering they're now the big bad military outfit, well maybe not big bad military, but maybe wanna-be big bad military. Nope. No defenses what-so-ever. The bomber flies up in a shuttle to their huge window, view able from anywhere in the city really, and fires on the room. Not a single vehicle in the air to defend them, nothing. No fixed defences. Great. Naturally the task of doing something other than be a living corpse falls to Kirk. Pike dies in the exchange, deadly says Kirk, he manages to beat his previous record of Cadet to Captain. So wtf is the story with Starfleet, are they badass? Or are they so incompetent that they couldn't organise a piss up in a brewery?


So the bomber fucks off to ~~Pakistan~~ Kronos to hide in an isolated part of some province. Admiral says he's worried about sending a starship to Kronos because it could potentially start a war, which he says is inevitable anyway. So lets fire a fuck ton of newly developed and super secret ~~cruise missiles~~ advanced photon torpedoes at Kronos, because you know, the Klingons wont mind that. Kirk agrees. Spock freaks out on several points, not least of which is that they are executing someone without trial, Kirk disagrees with him. Meanwhile Scotty is freaking out that there are 72 ~~cruise missiles~~ advanced photon torpedoes which he has no idea whats in them and how they could potentially affect the warp core... or something, resigns his commission and fucks off to the nearest bar with his monkey sidekick. Fine. On the way to Kronos, Kirk decides he's been following orders for too long and decides to alter the plan, he's going to sit the Enterprise in the Neutral zone (a violation of the Klingon Federation peace treaty/truce)
and send a strike team to catch the bomber in a ~~blackhawk~~ shuttle. They get there, catch the bomber, yada yada yada, he implies all is not right with the 72 missiles (as if we haven't already figured that out ourselves). They crack open one of the missles and they discover its got a person in it in cryo-stasis. They can't take them out though because technobabble....without knowing the exact frequency. Cool. Turns out, the bomber is Khan, (there are more obvious signs that he is Khan but they aren't relevant to the plot holes) and the people in the torpedoes are his crew. Turns out the Admiral wanted to kill Khan and his crew at the same time as starting a war with the Klingons. But why did he go out of his way to setup one of the most elaborate ways of accomplishing those 3 tasks all in the same move. Its so completely unnecessary, why could he not kill the crew separately, they were already in his control, why bother loading them up in as a bomb if not to make some poetic ending for Khan. Why would he bother to go to all that bother...

A few others that I wont go into more detail because I've already put in a wall of text already...

* Chekhov seems to forget how to transport people who are moving targets like he did in [this scene](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QGNfrNJZin4) in the previous film.

* Kirk survives long enough from direct exposure to a matter antimatter reaction to slowly die of a radiation poisoning.

* [This scene](http://cdn.mos.totalfilm.com/images/s/star-trek-into-darkness-reveals-a-new-poster-130705-a-1363882502-470-75.jpg)

* Who sabotaged the Enterprise?

* Spock has more emotions than Data in Star Trek Generations

* How did Scotty manage to remain undetected despite the at least half dozen ships that were in the convoy he snuck into, did none of them detect him?

* How did they avoid a war with the Klingons despite the fact that there was an attack on one of their patrols that left most if not all dead, if most of them died but some survived they would have reported it. All of that happened with a Federation starship sitting in the neutral zone which transmitted a message saying they were gonna launch missiles and a strike team at Kronos.

* How did they suddenly realise they could detach the bodies in the torpedoes successfully without killing them?

* Why did Old Spock say ""I told you I wouldn't tell you anything from the future, but fuck that, wait till you hear this...""

Some of these might be more really poor writing, but they all really annoyed me and made no sense in the grander scheme of things.

They had so much riding on that seduction and getting him drunk, he spent a good portion of the evening with her the first time, surely he would at least remember her face if not the full events of the evening.

2) Speaking of the hooker. Why was Stamper so afraid of her blackmail? They regularly fight tooth and nail against some of the most powerful men in the world, yet a hooker with a blackmail note was not only enough to frighten them, but characters who are usually ruthless also decided to put her up, take care of her, etc. It can be said that they knew she would be needed soon but it's in the dumbest way (see #1)

3: Speaking of Russo, this is more of an inaccuracy rather than a plothole but the day after he joins AA, he calls to make amends to his ex. It isn't til the 9th step of AA that you do that, and that would be WAAAAY down the line for him

Let us say that both pairings were at an even score before those two putts. The judge made par, leaving them at E, but his partner's miss put them at +1. Danny and his partner were also at E, and had the same result, meaning both pairings should be at +1.

But in this post, I'd like to focus on just one big one.  

I'll skip the usual time-travel multiple-universe garbage even though this game screws that up in all the usual ways, it's not very interesting.  Leaving out anything that's not mentioned specifically in the game itself, there's still a big error on the part of the writers.  This is your last chance to stop reading if you haven't yet finished the game.

So, in the end, the story goes, Comstock (henceforth: ""bad you"") is killed by Dewitt (henceforth: ""good you"") but that's not good enough, so ""good you"" decides that the only solution is to go back in time to your baptism and kill yourself before it happens (or doesn't happen) so that ""bad you"" can never exist.  Which is exactly what happens.... but it makes literally no sense.

It's already been established in the game that when you travel to a place/time when you already exist, both instances of you are separate entities (although the aren't completely consistent about this...)  Throughout the entire game, it's ""good you"" having traveled to another place to do battle with ""bad you"" making it clear that the two yous remain distinct people.  Yet halfway through the game you travel again to a place there are THREE yous, ""good you, ""dead you"" (Dewitt the Vox martyr), and ""bad you""... and ""good you"" specifically says he is confused because he suddenly has the memories of ""dead you"" as well.  If that's so, why doesn't he also have the memories of ""bad you?""

But that's not the plot hole I'm getting to, just incidental information leading up to it.  When ""good you"" then travels to the past and is killed, that's just killing ""good you.""  Specifically, ""past you"" should, by the logic above, still be alive and kicking, headed to his baptism, ready to create ""bad you.""  ""Good you"" died for nothing because ""past you"" is still alive and nothing has been done to prevent ""bad you"" at all.  

TL;DR:  you go back in time and kill the you that went back in time, not the you that was existing at that time, ready to make the mistake -- and you can't say that that you 'merge' after the travel, because if you did, you would have 'merged' with the antagonist at the beginning of the game, or (and?) the dead you in the middle.

At the end, when Joseph Gordon-Levitt (Joe) kills himself, it first shows what happens if he doesn't kill himself, Bruce Willis (Future Joe) shoots the mother and she dies.  Did this event actually happen or was it just a vision in Joe's mind?

Two scenarios:

1.  It was just a vision in Joe's mind and end of thread. 

2.  Future Joe actually shoots the mother and then Real Joe shoots himself, effectively saving the mother because Future Joe would never have grown up to travel back in time.  Is that how it would work though?  OR since everything is happening in the present, would Future Joe have existed long enough to shoot the mother and then disappear once Real Joe shoots himself?  So Real Joe is dead and the mother is dead even though she was killed by Future Joe, who never would have existed.

Odin then whispers some magical spell into Mjolnir, saying something along the lines of ""Whoever possesses the hammer will have all the powers of Thor."" When Thor lands on Earth, he is without his powers and cannot lift Mjolnir. 

Stay with me as I jump ahead...

The Destroyer is sent to Earth to kill Thor &amp; Friends. The Destroyer kicks everyone's ass, so Thor convinces them all to retreat while he goes to talk to The Destroyer. At this point, Thor still does not have his powers yet. He talks The Destroyer down, but before it leaves, The Destroyer gives Thor a good old fashioned hard backhand to the face. This knocks Thor back and injures him so severely that Thor dies. Meanwhile, Odin is in some type of coma back in Asgard. Somehow he ""knows"" when Thor dies, and sheds a single tear from his coma. Then we flashback to Odin whispering that spell into the hammer. Then back on Earth, Mjolnir flies out of the ground and goes *straight* to Thor's body. Thor's hand shoots into the air to catch Mjolnir (all while Thor is still dead), lightning strikes the hammer/Thor and voila! Thor is alive! And he's got his powers back! Ta-da!

We won't let them go. Oh, wait, there they are, 150 feet away on that hillside, shit I guess we missed them."" … and ""Why didn't the eagles just fucking drop them off 10 minutes later at the mountain they can now SEE in the distance?""… and I was vaguely annoyed by the sequence where the 12 or 13 of them outran a hundred fucking thousand orcs by simply running forward and swinging sticks, still had time for quips, then fell down a goddamned chasm and magically appeared at the exit... and then once they were out (whew) stopped to say ""Wait a sec, is someone missing?"" whereupon the missing person shows up directly after being lost and stumbling around inside of a fucking MOUNTAIN... and then we had our stock ""I respect you now"" moment that apparently needs to be in every goddamned single one of these movies now… and there was all the fake danger moments like when the they're riding the mountain giants and crash into the mountainside: ""Nooooooo!"" says one of the dwarves but (oh, whew) they're all okay after all…

All in all an amazing technical feat, but I really think we're forgetting how to tell or watch a good story and instead are replacing that with a 'good ride'. And apparently we're also forgetting how to sustain or create real suspense, instead are substituting a kind 'Harlequin romance' type of momentary tension where we know there's no reason to worry but the story demands a moment of action so we agree to pretend that one of the characters who we KNOW makes it to the finale is in danger, hanging from the cliff or from that tree...
