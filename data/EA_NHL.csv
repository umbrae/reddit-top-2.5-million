1348966989.0,61,self.EA_NHL,10owjg,Must Read NHL 13 Tips,79,18,24,http://www.reddit.com/r/EA_NHL/comments/10owjg/must_read_nhl_13_tips/,"Alright guys.  I was complaining about struggling with scoring but I've already come a long way and I have started scoring a lot of goals.  I've always played Defense well, but I'll touch on that for you.

Here's some things you need to understand before getting frustrated.

**NHL 13 is the most realistic hockey game ever.**  I promise you that it understands hockey intelligence and player roles.

Here's what you need to take from that statement:  When you're a 75 overall fourth-liner, you don't belong rushing up the ice on a break-away throwing cross-passes to your shitty fourth-line mate.  You aren't going to get it past Henrik Lundqvist with that shit.  You have a much better scoring opportunity on a 2-1 breakaway with Kane and Toews than you do with Jamal Mayers and Dan Carcillo. 

So pick corners and snipe one-timers with your top line, and dump and chase and play gritty hockey with your fourth-line.  If you have big dumb John Scott at the point, don't expect him to come anywhere close to the net with his horrible shooting stats.  If you have Jason Garrison taking a wide-open one timer from Henrik Sedin, through traffic, someone will redirect that right into the net, or Garrison will pick a corner.  The game recognizes that you are playing to your line-ups strengths and it rewards you.  How do I know this?  When you build your AI for sims, you have the ability to create roles for your lines, adjust sliders for dumps, shooting frequency, finish checks etc... and assign roles to players based on their strengths.  Prolific scorers are snipers and playmakers.  This means something in NHL 13.  It didn't mean anything in NHL 12 or earlier.

The other area I have had trouble in is skating and protecting the puck.  Especially in EASHL where multiple defenders attack aggressively with the overpowering poke check.

Here's how I have gotten over it.  **I GLIDE!**   When you glide you have several options available to avoid defenders, and you can actually make an accurate pass or shot.  The way I played NHL 12 and earlier was to skate full throttle.  I got in the habit of pressing hustle to chase after every loose puck, and then skate right up the ice past the defenders and pass it.  Guess what!?  That doesn't happen in real hockey.  NHL 13 has it right.  You need to be much more deliberate with your decisions.  

The ""45 degree cut"" is a move you can execute if you slow your roll as you enter the zone.  Skate as fast as you can towards the blue line and then let go of the left stick.  When your defender tries to line you up and takes his first step towards you, push the left stick inside, and up or down, so thats 1-2 o'clock and 4:30 (if you will), or 7:30 and 10:30.  Your skater will make a quick move that leaves you in control to make an accurate pass or shot.  The inside/down move (7:30 or 4:30) is a tighter turn and it creates a lot of distance between you and a defender giving you space (typically AI).  The inside/up move (1:30 or 10:30) is very subtle, but it really just puts you one step ahead of where your defender thought you would be.  So use this one to get past an attacking aggressive defender.  Every time I use these moves I feel like I'm better than every single person on the ice in EASHL.  They are effective and like I said, they leave you in control to make a good pass or shot afterwards.  I usually score, or set someone up for a nice play after I beat the defender.

Even when a defender does get his stick on you, or hit you, you are in control and stay upright more often than not, and you usually end up with the puck.

When you are skating at full-stride like you did in NHL 12, and shoot or pass without letting off the left stick, your shot will miss the net by a foot and your pass will miss it's target.  It affects everything and I'm fucking tired of watching you idiots skate in EASHL with your Rookie 2 card and throwing a rushed pass into the crease where two defenders are ready to intercept your pass.  As a Rookie 2 with low overall rating, you should just enter the zone and shoot a wrister at the pads and hope for a rebound.  The goalies in EASHL are capable of stopping almost anything a Pro 3 shoots at them.  Once you get some real attributes, go ahead and set your player to Sniper and start lighting the lamp with some razzle dazzle.  Until then, play like the piece of shit fourth liner you are.

When you're skating off the puck, gliding is just as effective.  Your hits are more ""magnetic"" and you typically hit your target.  You are capable of chopping the puck.  You need to be gliding to chop the puck.  You can't just rush towards the puck poke it, you miss and leave the puck there for a nice free pizza.

EA HEAVILY PROMOTED THIS GLIDING TECHNIQUE.  I am surprised I don't see anyone utilizing it yet.  It's everything.


TL;DR

* Glide.  Glide like a motherfucker.",,False,,t5_2ry2z,False,,,True,t3_10owjg,http://www.reddit.com/r/EA_NHL/comments/10owjg/must_read_nhl_13_tips/,

I was recently invited to the EA SPORTS studios (along with Scarface &amp; Luger) to get some time in with NHL 13. Eventually we will be able to discuss all aspects of the game, but for now we are limited to just the skating portion of the title.

If you have any questions/concerns regarding the engine, ask away!

**** PLEASE REMEMBER ****

The game was in an alpha state and there are a lot of aspects of the title that will be changed and altered throughout the development process. My impressions of the skating are based off of an unfinished product in which tons of feedback was generated from our group alone. So things will undoubtedly change.

1) The key to offense is not passing the puck. A lot of people misunderstand this, but a good team consists of one all-star who is solely responsible for generating all of his teams offense. The job of the other players on the ice is to distract the defense so the all star can take bad angle shots on goal. If for some reason a decoy player gets the puck, the should immediately pass it back to the All-Star, as evidenced by immedite stick tapping.  
  
2) Despite the above, sometimes passing IS neccesary in a game, as follows:  
a:
&gt;If the computer player ends up with the puck, immediately call for a pass. The best way to make sure you get a good pass is to be at least a zone and a half away from the play with at least 2 defenders between you and the puck.  

b:  
&gt;Let's face it, some players just like to move the puck, and if you're one of them here's what to do. A good All-Star will know to park himself right in front of the net, and it's your job to force a pass to him no matter how many defenders are in the way. Eventually it HAS to get through, right?  
  
  
This brings me to my next point:  
  
**Defense**  
I know how real hockey is played, but this is a video game, and positions are for idiots.  
1) The key to defense is for you and your teammates to all crowd together in front of the net. That way, if someone tries to pass cross crease, you can all lay on the ice and get in the way of that one idiot on your team who is actually in position to intercept it. Fool.
2) An added bonus of the above is that the goalie never has to worry about seeing shots, which can be annoying for him. Even better, sometimes the crowd will block a shot, and your goalie will have enough time to commit to a move. That way, when the rebound is laying there on the ice and the offense gets it, he won't get hit by the puck when they are scoring.  
  
**Goaltending**  
This position exists purly to scorn your teammates when they don't let you play forward. The key here is to get in fights and let in lots of goals. Oh and if someone on your team chooses goalie, it's best to leave the game entirely.",,False,,t5_2ry2z,False,,,True,t3_lgz4k,http://www.reddit.com/r/EA_NHL/comments/lgz4k/things_ive_learned_about_hockey_from_playing_nhl/,

* Faster simulation for PS3.

* Teams should be able to trade to save cap.

* Trade players rights (like when Washington traded Wideman's rights to the Flames).

* Trade conditional draft picks.

* Change the potential system. It would be better if a player picked in like the 7th round becomes a franchise player. That NEVER happens in NHL 13. Look at Lundqvist and Rinne for example.

* Move the ""now simulating"" box so that it doesn't block the transaction news.

* Players drafted from European leagues shouldn't be forced to play in the AHL directly, they should be able to go back to their old teams and play for a couple of seasons to develop.

* You should be able to see how your players not playing in the NHL or AHL is doing in their respective league.

* Put the Winter Classic in the the gm mode.

* Bonuses in contracts.

* There should be some sort of loyalty stat. Alfredsson is always traded in the first season, and that would never happen in real life.

* Leadership stat. How much the captain affect the team.

* You should be able to see the goalies consistency stat in the GM mode.

* You should be able to go back and check who got goals/assist/PIMs and other stats from specific previous games.

* There should be like world juniors/world cup included. The scouting should be more effective during these tournaments.

* You should be able to postpone trades, not cancel them just to check other trade request and have to memorise them.

* Injuries should be more realistic. Played as the sharks once and Thornton, Marleau, Couture, Niemi, Boyle and Pavelski were all injured for months all at the same time. I mean it could possibly happen, but seriously??

* Players should be able to request trades, if for example he doesn't get enough ice time or PP time or whatever.

* There should be like morale/fatigue/form like in FIFA

* I'd be cool if there was like an imaginary twitter feed like in Madden. It would really make the GM experience in depth. For example if you're doing a GM mode as let's say Calgary, it'd be really nice to see what else is happening around the league like ""Stamkos amazing 5 point night against the Hurricanes!"" or ""Rick Nash on his way out? Nash has requested to be traded to a team with higher chance of winning a cup."" etc.

* Real in-depth scouting reports on specific drafted/undrafted prospects. Like: ""Sam Reinhert has the potential to become a superstar, although he should work on his faceoff skills and his discipline. Takes a lot of unnecessary penalties. Plays better under a lot of pressure and scores clutch goals in big games"". 

* Faceoff and discipline stats should be able to increase/decrease. (See next point).

* Player training. You should be able to for the type of team you want. You should be able to train you players to be the type of player you want. You want a team that is a defensive juggernaut like the Bruins or an offensive tic-tac-toe type team like the Canucks? You should be able to focus on developing different aspects of players.

* Change players positions to fit your team better. If there is a player that you really like in the draft that is for example a center, but already have a lot of centers, you should be able to change him into a rightwing for example. His stats may go down at first, but should go back to normal after a while.

* Short cut button to switch goalies. Like triangle or what not. Very annoying to go into edit lines to switch goalies.

* More variations in the ""new generated"" players that are created when you have played a few years. It is always the case that the first overall is the only decent player in the draft, and the rest are just dead weight. They are always humongous and have faceoff ratings of 67 or 68. Once in a while a 5-star player should appear. Has never happened to me.

* You should be able to interact with players more, tell them that they are doing good/bad, discuss whether they'd resign in the offseason, so that you can actually prepare to trade away salary in the trade deadline/draft.

* Players shouldn't always resign. If they feel they want to go to a more successful team or what not.

* Include various clauses in contracts, like a ""no trade clause"".

* Player search. Instead of having to go through every team, you should be able just to search the actual name in like the trading block. ",,False,,t5_2ry2z,1373304954.0,,,True,t3_15qd7g,http://www.reddit.com/r/EA_NHL/comments/15qd7g/gm_mode_for_nhl_14_request/,

[You can download the pack via Operations Sports...](http://www.operationsports.com/forums/ea-sports-nhl-sounds-forum/486011-nhl-12-sound-pack.html)

I've ran across these a bunch of times (even [jmallet74](http://www.reddit.com/user/jmallet74) has reminded us of their existence [not long ago](http://redd.it/kdwml)), but every time I downloaded a section of it and listened to the music -- it sounded like utter shit because the creator increased the volume on the tracks using MP3Gain. 

However, when played through the console -- even the ""recorded off of Youtube..."" stuff used to simulate some of the crowd chants -- sounds great when mixed in with the game sound effects, the roar of the in-game crowd, and yes...even the announcers.

Some of the music is absolute shit...and that's awesome! It's exactly what you'd expect to hear at a live game. The Off Play and Intermission packs alone (boasting 512 song clips, yo) are worth the effort in making a quick addition. If you want more, grab last year's Intermission and Off Plays (also 512 songs each) to mix it up even more.

Going further with Penalty Kill songs, Power Play songs, custom Team Intros, as crazy as you want to get...Oh Holy Hell It's Great. It might not be for everybody, but if you're the kind of person that played NHL 11 all year long and will do the same for 12 -- you owe it to your game experience to try this out.

We hit 2,000 readers late last week, so if you're new, consider this your official WELCOME TO THE BEST EA SPORTS NHL COMMUNITY EVER post. For those of you that have been with us for awhile, well, thanks for making it all that it is.* 

**SOME UPDATES AND OTHER INFO:**

* *The EASHL Hockey Clubs for NHL 12 were removed from the sidebar and FAQ.* If your club plans to give NHL 13 the finger and keep on keeping on in 12, let me know and I'l find a place to shine a spotlight on your commitment to excellence and your dedication to cross-creases.

* *If you form an EASHL Hockey Club for NHL 13 and want to have it listed on the sidebar, send a message to modmail.* I will need a link to your EASHL Page on EA's website and the reddit usernames of your GMs. There's no super rule on this, but we expect that clubs listed here are at least somewhat part of the general community around here. If you just want to brag about your success, make a post. DON'TFORGETTOSLOWDOWNTHEREPLAYTIMEONYOURVIDEO.

* *FYI: The best way to get into an EASHL league is to join your console's OTP Night.* The organizers of such events will post details soon, but if you are new or recently returned: PSN OTP IS TUESDAY and XBL OPT NIGHT IS WEDNESDAY. Both get started @ 8:30pm EST. Keep an eye on the subreddit for details.

* *A community has been recently created to focus solely on GM CONNECTED.* It's called /r/RGMC and you should probably check it out. There are two leagues created for PS3 within and others will probably follow shortly. I've also seen sporadic postings of other GM Connected League subreddits... so if you want them linked, message me some details.

* *If you have good sources of information for the community, post it up.* If you think it's sidebar worthy and I haven't already put it there, let me know. If you think it should be part of the FAQ, feel free to place it in. If you don't want to handle the edit, again, let me know and I'll do it for you.

* *If you're new to /r/EA_NHL, you'll notice that I rule the subreddit with an iron fist, which should be readily apparent by [the massive list of rules I've put in place](http://insidescoop.areavoices.com/files/2012/02/no-rules.jpg) and expect all members to follow.* Nah, what really makes this community the best of this franchise is that it is led by its kickass membership, . That, and we steal everybody else's shit. Let's keep it that way and have another kickass year.

I was just going to post a link to it on the forums there, but apparently it's gone.

Reposting the whole thing in one post would probably make everyone TL;DR hard, so here's the first player type.  If there's interest I'll post the others.

Without further ado...



**#1: Dangles McDangler**

*What He Does:*

* First off, let's talk about Dangles McDangler.  You know who you are.  You're that guy who will, during the breakout, suddenly start twirling around in the neutral zone for ten seconds trying to carry the puck in yourself, rather than pass it to either of the other forwards or flip/slap it in, which would have caused all three of us (and possibly a D man) to enter the zone at full speed, therefore giving us a massively awesome forecheck and good chance of picking that puck up.

*Why It's Bad:*

* But no, we have you, D McD.  When you do your thing, you completely destroy any momentum we had going on the breakout.  And, since you've already destroyed our momentum, I have no problem carefully going offside every time you try to carry the puck in when passing or dumping would obviously have been better.  Hopefully you will figure it out by the middle of the second period, but let's face it... you probably won't, and will continually rage about that stupid winger who seems to always go offside when you've finally managed to get close enough to the offensive blue line to go over it (even thought you're going to get crushed as soon as you do).  I'll take a faceoff just outside the offensive zone over you turning it over and sending the puck back the other way every time.

*How He Can Be Less Annoying:*

* Unless you have clear ice in front of you, ALWAYS look to pass or dump the puck in.  They're gonna get you.  Every time.  And when they do, we're all backskating yet AGAIN, so that we can pass it up to you again and have you stall us in the neutral zone again.  And again.  And again.

**Selecting a Build**

* **Stand up** The build which gifts you the highest and most useful attributes by default. I would highly recommend this build for everyone until you are at least Legend 1 + almost all boosts unlocked. The reason is that until you can get more points and boosts you can't make the butterfly/hybrid compete with what you'd have as a stand up. Personally I find myself switching between this and the butterfly, I dislike some of the stand up animations. I don't like how it gets up from the butterfly, but most of all the stupid over exaggerated high blocker save has cost my a few goals short side. The animations for a few of the other saves differ, but not drastically. 

* **Butterfly** Once again I wouldn't suggest this until you have more points. The animations though are superior in my opinion to that of the stand up, and if you are playing a lot of tight games it may save you here and there. Once again default attributes are lower so with the same experience your stand up would be rated better, but this is still likely my favourite build. 

* **Hybrid** Not a ton of experience in this one, not a fan of some of the animations and default attributes are not as good as you'd get with stand up. 

**What attributes to spend points on**

* Angles: Normally very cheap to upgrade, they determine how quickly your goalie changes direction and re-adjusts to passes. Because EA is somewhat difficult, your goalie will always struggle adjusting when your team has the puck or when no one has it. This attribute does matter though, and if you keep it low you'll see a ton of goals go in off you and into the net as you were facing the wrong way. Most successful goalies will keep this over 90. 

* Breakaway: An agility modifier that only works on breakaways. Used to keep it high, now don't put much into it at all. Seems fairly useless as most people challenge or don't move much on the breakaway anyway. 

* Five Hole: Not many shooters go five hole, you are most victimized when you go VHS against the post. Ideally if you are above 6' 5"" as a goalie keep this above 80. Otherwise spend extra points here.

* Glove High: Aim to get this into the high 90s, shooters almost always go here and it makes a huge difference.

* Glove Low: If you are playing a butterfly style get this real high into the 90s as well, frequently targeted. 

* Stick High: Shooters often go for the corners, so once again try and get it high if possible.

* Stick Low: The most useless of the 4, but try to aim to get all of them into the mid low 90s.

* Passing: determines how strong you clear the puck - useless don't change unless extra points.

* Poke Check: CPU only don't add anything

* Rebound Control: Either keep it 75 or below or 87 or higher. Depends entirely on your defense. If they'll clear front of the net for you, keep it high. If the other player will get there first this makes easy taps ins for them. This really determines a lot in the game, more than people think so pick what you think works best.

* Shot Recovery: I'm not really sure here. Some people say it doesn't matter at all, I didn't think so the first few months. Lately I've kept it higher and feel like it makes a big difference, but not sure if it really does.

* Aggressiveness: Community is also split on how useful this is, some say it'll make your goalie auto cover the puck more even if it's further away from them. Not sure, but sometimes worth left over points.

* Agility: How quick you make saves, likely the most important stat in this category. Aim for middle to high 90s, its absolutely vital.

* Durability: Doesn't matter

* Endurance: Doesn't matter

* Speed: I used to keep this low as not to over slide. If you are just starting maybe it's worth keeping it on the lower end. I've been experimenting more with keeping it above 80 and like it quite a bit. This lets you get across the crease quickly for those amazing saves, and I do find it quite useful.

* Vision: Second most important stat in this category, determines how easily your goalie can see through screens and their general puck tracking ability. Aim for it to get to at least 90 if not higher.

* Spend Boosts on the most expensive categories for points, this varies based on your build. Normally though I'd suggest Glove High + Low, Stick High + Low, Agility, Vision and then it's up to you a bit. 



**General Tips**

* Aim to have a goalie between 6'2 and 6'8, bigger you the easier it is to reach corners but bigger the five hole gets especially on VHS. 

* Weight should be between 200 and 225 ideally, lighter and you'll go flying on contact and heavier you'll slide too slowly around. Start with it heavier if you over slide too much

* Do NOT play goalie unless you have a good internet connection or you will have a bad time. 

* When you start you'll almost always over commit and bite on dekes, playing goalie is almost as much about not doing anything as it is about moving. Know when to move and when not to. Ideally don't move a ton till the puck is around the circles, or you'll be way out of position. A lot of this is simple experience, and learning to read the play

* Find and pick a view you like between Low, High, Fixed and Classic. I'm normally on high or fixed. I've tried classic but felt too far away from it, especially on scrambles. Low swings around and moves too much. All of these views except classic do suck in that the player who starts from behind the net is your worst enemy. You can't see the cross crease player in your vision, so you don't know if one is there and it makes it difficult to tell how far he's swung out in front of the net. You need to switch from the VHS to free butterfly to go from protecting short side to the middle and far side of the net as well. Shooters have a great advantage here, especially if they can nail you on short side the second you let go of VHS. Defense you really need to cover the posts and help your goalie out.

* Cross crease: how to play them depends. If it happens slow enough you can slide across standing or in your butterfly so your goalie makes the save if the puck is shot in that time. Otherwise VHS across, your goalie will move across in the stupid VHS animation but it is definitely the quickest way from side to side of the net. 

* Unless your D is top notch you can't play goal line camper. I've seen some top elite teams do it, and it works if you can limit where the shots come from. But a good shooter in the slot or close in will destroy your goal line camper no matter how big you make your goalie. Learn to come out and challenge the shooter in the butterfly or stand up depending how you play. 

* Anyone that's beside the net learn the angles on when to play the VHS and when to let go, stand up goalies will get nailed short side here a lot, but you have to know when the player truly has nothing to shoot at and when they do. 

* Experience is the best teacher, see more shooters and how they play and where most people go

* Breakaways if you haven't done it once this game try the diving poke check, if you have do it again or simply follow them with the butterfly. Get in too close? VHS to the side they are on, most players try to get the goalie into the butterfly and go on short side between goalie and the post. VHS and their opportunity disappears, be careful about doing this too much if they are still too far out as they'll make you look silly (happens to me a lot still). 

* Defense strategies either do protect net/staggered or tight point or high pressure/tight point. Protect the net will stop the cross crease but they will do nothing on the rush for you, and you need to cover short side as shooter comes in wide. If a team generates most of its offense once they establish a zone looking for passing lanes this is the way to go. If most of their offense is on the rush and sneaking in, then use high pressure. Other human players know what kind of setting you are on, and don't go over to the computers side if they aren't doing anything to help as you'll confuse the AI and leave a man open. Change it up during the game based off how the other team is playing, you can make good use of AI defenders. 





I think that covers most of what I've learned over the last few months. **I'm leaving next week and will be back in August or NHL 13 not sure which yet. Want to say thanks to all the guys on the PSN side who've been awesome.** 

Also there is a ton of great goalies on the PSN side in sibs, wild, bean, rob, soups and others who are all pretty damn good at the position as well, I'd ask beginners to see how they play and learn from them.

The metagame needs to change. Collectively we as players were spoiled for the past couple of years with stick lifts.  Stick lifts are not meant to be a viable defensive tool one on one with the offensive player facing you.


If you try to stick lift the player in this situation you will either take a penalty or the player will just pick up the puck and keep going.

This is realistic. How often do you seem defenders stick lift an offensive player on the rush in a real game in the NHL? Maybe once?  Try stick lifting a talented hockey player in real life while he is skating towards you.  He will laugh as he skates around you when he puts his stick back on the ice. How often did we see it in NHL 11 (for me I used it more than poke checks...)  Now tying up an opponents stick is something completely difference and not a feature that is in NHL 12 (yet).

This does not mean it is no longer a useful tool.  It has just become the same tool that it is in REAL LIFE HOCKEY.

Situations where the stick lift is useful.

The Pick Pocket.
This is when the player with the puck has HIS BACK TO YOU.  Normally done on the backcheck.  You may see Datsyuk use this move a lot.  It is more effective if the player is the opposite handiness as you (this reduces the chance of a penalty as it is directly stick on stick).  This allows you to come up behind lift his stick and take the puck with him being unaware of you.  An important note here is that you must be skating FASTER than the opponent or else he will just out skate you and carry on.


Interrupt the pass.
When a player is about to receive the pass you can lift his stick and he will be unable to receive it.  This works quite well with snipers who sit in the slot.  

Race for a loose puck.
You and a player of the other team are neck and neck racing for the puck against the boards.  By lifting his stick just before you reach the puck you will increase your chance to come away with the loose puck.

Double Team
You lift his stick. Team mate gets the puck. Useful for those damn puck hogs with 99 puck control!
(thanks to beerbaron7)

I'm sick of people taking penalties from stick lifts at inappropriate times. (I am very guilty of this) I think everyone has a bad habit from NHL 11/10 and instead of complaining about how stick lifts never work any more we need to get away of the bad habit of using them as a face to face defensive tool.

TL;DR Stick lifts are not broken they are just much more realistic.",,False,,t5_2ry2z,True,,psn,True,t3_kkif6,http://www.reddit.com/r/EA_NHL/comments/kkif6/the_purpose_of_stick_lifts/,

Let's get Rammer's attention.,28,4,63,http://www.reddit.com/r/EA_NHL/comments/q2aex/eashl_needs_a_facelift_lets_get_rammers_attention/,"Hey guys, its NHLVet here from Youtube. I play this game religiously, a few hours a night pretty much every night since NHL 09 introduced the addictive game type known to us as EASHL. For the past few years it has been, to put quite bluntly, the same sh*t. You can tell they didn't put much thought into EASHL becuase when you create custom jerseys for your team, you get the old RBK logo on the back instead of the new ""Reebok"" logo. Who can blame EA anyways really, the casuals that buy NHL for a few versus games online and Be a GM mode are the main market for them, why bother catering to a relatively small market that just want to play EASHL/OTP? That's what EA thinks at least.

Anyways, back to the point. I am going to make a youtube video pretty much calling out EA on some things that just absolutely NEED to change that get overlooked every year, I am sure I could come up with a 10 minute rant on EASHL on my own but I would love to hear what you guys think needs to change, or what you would like to see included in future additions. Here is a snippet of what I thought up for the playoff system.

---


PLAYOFFS:
Playoffs are awesome in EASHL, so much wasted potential. Teams will literally play 2 games in the 26 day long season, but everyone manages to come on in the last 4 days to play their 4 playoff games. The atmosphere is awesome and the crowd chanting is sweet, everyone has a great time playing playoffs. 

But it sucks when you win. You win, you get a banner ceremony EVERY HOME GAME FOR THE NEXT 30 DAYS letting the other team know that you are one of the best teams in the elite division. 75% of the teams you face quit immediately after seeing your banner, not only that it is PAINTED ON YOUR ICE, what NHL team paints that they are cup champions on their ice the whole season? Just show the banner for about a week and let it never be shown again, or maybe just have it so the away team sees the standard intro no matter what and the home team can see their banner if they won. Also, instead of re-raising the same banner every month, how about adding a month to the bottom of it and seeing it raise to the top next to all the other months you've won?

Now the actual playing the playoffs can be kind of a let down too, we've won a 1-0 game in the EASHL Elite finals in 3OT and all we did was celebrate and go into the locker room, here is where EAs chance to shine really is. Give us what EA is so good at, PRESENTATION! Have virtual Rammer come out and present playoff MVP, hand out the EASHL Trophy, let the players pick up the trophy, skate around with it, press face buttons to interact with the trophy (Press B to raise and pump trophy, X to kiss trophy, etc). Winning the playoffs is a legit accomplishment but it just feels like an empty punishment as is.

Also, how cool would it be if you got an avatar award for winning the playoffs? An ""EASHL Elite Champions"" Tshirt+Hat for your avatar would be amazing, maybe a little trophy prop too

---

Shoot your ideas at me, I know Rammer is pretty active on twitter and will respond (or at least read) any tweets at him, as I have interacted with him twitter a few times, He is a very nice guy and is good with the community. I don't think this will really make a huge impact on next year's addition but man, just to have them HEAR the ideas would be great.

********
**How momentum works**

We have not programmed momentum into the game, though I'm sure most of you will still not believe that. There are specific situations that occur during the game which would make it seem like momentum but those instances happen in real games as well. I'll list the situations below 

**Icing** - We have fatigue in our game, so if you ice the puck, your team will have more fatigue and this could result in being slow to the puck at times (just like in real life) 

**Fatigue** - In general fatigue can be a factor. If you constantly take penalties, your PK lines will get fatigued 

**Intimidation** - Getting hit, specifically big hits, will cause you players to be intimidated. This will cause the CPU to make bad passes/dumps or clearances when under pressure, or when about to receive another hit. 

**Injury** - When a player is injured, his stats will be lowered and depending on this type/location of the injury this could cause the player to shoot less accurately, skate slower. 

**CPU strategy changes** - Nearing the end of the game, the CPU will change their defensive and offensive strategies to try to tie up the game. This is why you may thing that there is come back logic, but in fact they are pressing hard for another goal. 

In short, real momentum is based on, on ice events and we try to simulate those events and we do not make up some arbitrary momentum meter/stats that take effect at a flip of a switch. 

********

**Can you get intimidated after the whistle?**

No, you are currently not intimidated when being hit in post whistle scrums. 

**How are grades calculated?**

For each position, we look at your last 20 games for that position and determine your grade (again for that specific position), and we weigh the more recent games more heavily than the 20th game. Having said that, your Skater overall grade is determined on an average of all of your grades for each position, weighing more heavily on the position that has more games played. 

The weighting itself is pretty simple. We look at your Center grade x Center GP / Skater GP + RW grade x RW GP / Skater GP + LW grade x LW GP / Skater GP + D grade x D GP / Skater GP 

This way we weigh more heavily on the position that you play most

*Rob_c's note: This is mostly bullshit. They weigh the most played position a bit more heavily, but that doesn't mean you can neglect other positions with a low overall grade just because you don't have many games played*

********

**Goalie Controls:** There is an option in the controller settings in the Main Menu screens to turn off auto stick sweeps and auto puck covers when being a human goalie, so you can try either of those.

********

**How to improve Goalie Team play score:**

-Get a shutout period or shutout 

-Make rebound saves 

-Penalty shot saves or breakaway saves 

-""Big"" saves, like huge glove saves 

-desperation saves (though attempting them is pretty risky)

********

**How to improve Hitting:**

Aggressiveness does not help you hit any better. You need checking, strength, speed, acceleration, endurance, and balance to be a great hitter. None of our tuners reduced hitting, we only removed hip check exploiting.

If you hit without speed you won't knock the players over. Also your opponents balence and strength and size matter. 

********

**How to improve Speed**

You need high accel and speed to be fast. If your accel isn't even close to your speed that is why your guy is slow.

For those of you that are new the sub-reddit and/or new to the game here are a few things you should know about OTP night:

1. To get to our lobby it goes as follows (From the NHL 13 main menu) Online&gt; Community&gt;Lobby&gt; Games modes&gt; REDDIT. Once you find the reddit room you will find out that it is password protected. To solve this problem enter the password which is ""bacon"". This will be the password from now until the end of time.

2. We DO NOT use the standard PlayStation 3 headsets. We use **Teamspeak 3**, so we can talk to everybody during the game and talk a little fun trash. You can find the application [---&gt;HERE!!!&lt;---](http://www.teamspeak.com/?page=downloads) The server is hosted on a default port and the server address is mikeal.com. If you can't get Team Speak 3 for PC there are also Teamspeak clients for IOS and Android. The IOS client is $5, and the Android client is free for now but it is also in BETA.

3. We play for fun, but participants are expected to play realistic sim hockey. So please, keep the glitch goals to a minimum. Also, on that note be respectful to other people. Some others will not be as good, due to being new, as a community we will do our best to help you become a better player. TL;DR - Don't be a chode.

4. The Games begin at 8:30 EST/5:30 PST. It's recommended to get on Teamspeak(Details above) and in the Reddit room before it starts to guarantee your spot in the first game(s). That being said, if you miss a game don't panic, there will be another game in 15-30 minutes max.

5. The way teams are picked during OTP night is by captains, so if you're picked last don't worry. If you do not have teamspeak it gets a little hard to figure out which side you're going to play on. IF you cannot get teamspeak for some reason, wait until everybody else is picked and go to the last team.

&gt;We did a few small tweaks to the EASHL Pro regarding player types and how you can spend your XP. NHL is always tuned using NHL players and teams and we do not have separate gameplay for EASHL specifically. This year we have decided that you can no longer be better than an NHL player in any stats for EASHL, that way we don’t see 99 wrist shot accuracy and power being able to blow shots past goalies as easily. You will no longer be able to have 99 of any stat. We tuned the values based on real life NHL players within their respective player types. For example, for snipers, we have a hard cap at 95 for wrist shot accuracy. The cap depends on the player type and what they “Should” be good and bad at. A Playmaker for example, would be able to get up to a 95 passing, but not up to a 90 rating shooting. We feel that by adding a cap for each stat based on player type does remove some of the freedoms you once had, but also forces people to choose a player type that more or less suites their style of play. We want NHL 13 to feel different with the new skating system, and we do not want people to have unbalanced players by being able to have 99 speed and agility for example. 

&gt;You will also notice the player overall ratings will be much lower. This is somewhat of an unwanted result of the offline player rating separation that happened, but really the EASHL Pro’s overall rating doesn’t mean anything. The individual stats are the most important. 

&gt;Also note that these caps were set while using the Boost Slots applied so we ensured that even while using boosts you could not go over an unwanted level. This will result in some people thinking some of the caps are set too low, but you must factor in the +8 boost you would apply to your pro. 

&gt;...this also applies to goalies. We looked at Miller and Lundqvist's stats to see what their rates were and determined that we won't allow goalies to go above a 92 in any given category.

&gt;...There is a cap on faceoffs, and I think the best player build for faceoffs is Grinder. We made their cap a little higher than other player types because the best faceoff players in the NHL are normally grinders. Plus it ads a little perk to be a player type that may not get used as often.",,False,,t5_2ry2z,False,,psnxbl,True,t3_xlvmk,http://www.reddit.com/r/EA_NHL/comments/xlvmk/no_more_999999_eashl_builds/,

**For Goalies**

* Get used to pressing L2 for butterfly, can't see the puck press L2, lot of activity around the net press L2 etc. 
* Don't be overactive, 90% of being goalie is being there, your player will make the save most of the time for you. 
* Be aware of the L2 + R2 Combination to do the VHL technique against the post, its very effective but watch the fivehole. Also practice going post to post with it, its one of the quickest ways to get across. 
* Whenever someone is behind the net be in a VHL or standup against the post, watch for the pass in front and be ready to let go of R2 in a hurry to get across to make the save
* On breakaways try not to move much or overreact, its very easy for good shooters to make you look silly. Also try not to back yourself into the net, makes it way too easy for shooters (I still struggle with this constantly). Also watch getting your butterfly style as it'll get your pad up against the post and leave a huge short side gap exposed if you push yourself back and don't switch to the VHL. 
* ALWAYS follow the puck when its in your zone, including when your defender has it, one quick poke check later and its in the net.
* Make sure to follow the puck not just horizontally but vertically, point shots will beat you easily if you aren't out to challenge, your defenders should help you on the backdoor passes. 
* Always be aware of the pass, most players will try to pass it on a 2 on 1 or 2 on 0, keep check of it and try and cheat without getting caught out obviously. 
* In controller settings turn on auto cover
* Never leave the net to play the puck unless you are super comfortable with it and theres no pressure, its a back breaking goal when it happens otherwise. 
* Fight when you need to. Simply put if their best skater challenges you to a fight, go for it. If you can get him off the ice for 5 minutes or longer, its worth it if your team doesn't lose anyone
* Don't be an idiot. Concentrate, don't skate out to center and take unsportsmanlike penalties your teammates will all think your an idiot (they're right). I've also had opposing goalies do this in the middle of an offensive chance for their team, I simply hit triangle fight the other guy and ruin the chance. Don't press the R1 + direction desperation saves when its a wrist shot etc.
* Watch out pressing triangle! Its to cover the puck, if you miss and dive out your out of position. Also if its a weak shot on net.. NEVER hit it.. Your goalie will try to smother the puck, it'll go through him like an idiot and you just pulled a Toskala. If its a scramble and you think the puck is near you, press it just be careful on the long shots etc. 
* Really bored because your team of redditors is awesome? Press select and your camera will follow around the puck and you can watch the play from a normal view instead, just remember to press it again when your team loses possession. 

**Designing your goalie**

* I prefer a standup style to stand just because of where the attributes go
* Spend points on Glove High and Blocker High, its where a lot of shooters prefer to go. Also spend what you can on Agility. 
* Don't waste points on Poke Check (applies only to CPU), shot recovery (doesn't do anything), Aggressiveness, Durability, or Endurance.

**Tips for Teammates**

* If its CPU defenceman turn it to high pressure, and tight point or staggered, or else they sit back and do nothing. 2 CPU d men often will provide excellent defence in my experience. The worst mix is 1 CPU 1 Human IMO. 
* Try to intercept passes, get in passing lanes and get in shooting lanes (common sense)
* All defenseman want offensive points, its simple to understand.. But please please don't pinch on a forecheck when its a 5 on 3 penalty kill.. 
* Play your position and try and not be a total dick to your goalie, they are doing their best, and its easy to get caught over reacting or having a lapse in concentration. 
* If you can stop the 2 on 0s, cross creases and breakaways a good human goalie will let in 0-2 goals a game, good defense will make a goalie spectacular. 
* I've always maintained a good human goalie is better than the cpu one just because they can keep you in plays and read the game a lot better, just don't abandon them out there.

**Tips for Shooters**
I shouldn't be doing this section.. but.. 

* On breakaways if you back the goalie in you have a lot of the net to shoot at, also when the goalie butterflies if you bring him out to the post he'll have his pad stuck against the post, if you can get the puck above the pad on either the glove or blocker side its nearly an automatic goal
* Get control of the puck behind the net! The moves it takes to deal with a good pass from behind the net to out front (Letting go of R2, holding or letting go of L2, then coming across to challenge vertically and horizontally and getting set) make it very easy to score like this. 
* Even on breakaways if you notice the goalie is too far in the net, snipe a corner. 
* Goalies will try to cheat on 2 on 1s and 2 on 0s, you can get them shortside if they do
* Shoot.. seriously if you take shots that you can get through even from just inside the blue line you'll catch a lot of goalies who are sitting way too deep in their net for easy goals. 
* The game gives out easy goalie interference calls, don't put your team down a man for no reason

Thats all I can think of.. Please add any tips/tricks you have on your own. I hope some of you guys found it helpful. Enjoy.

The return of Reddit OTP!,31,11,40,http://www.reddit.com/r/EA_NHL/comments/1ir53x/xbl_breaking_news_the_lockout_is_over_the_return/,"After many months of CBA debates (mostly just laying in piles of money complaining how we want more), we've decided to return to weekly(?) Reddit OTP nights to help motivate everyone as to why NHL 13 sucks and to look forward to NHL 14.

**FAQ**

&gt;What is OTP? 

OTP Night is a weekly EASHL / OTP game.

&gt;Why would I like Reddit OTP?

Because drop in players suck, and Reddit players *USUALLY* have some knowledge as to what they are doing.

&gt;Any other benefits?

Well, the games are ranked. So if you're having trouble leveling up a card, here's your chance to get some good grades in. Or if you want to try out a new position, here's a chance to do so!

&gt;**Why did you stop these?**

Because OTP night was a Wednesday night, and in the fall, I work nearly 60 hours a week. That includes Wednesday nights. And if I wasn't around making posts and the room, nobody else was. So what I need from you (the EANHLPA) is to make sure *SOMEONE* sets up a room, and the reminder post. (It really isn't that difficult. Paul Bissonnette could do it)

That's it for now! Get fucking pumped, cause Wednesday is gonna be pretty standard probably.",,False,,t5_2ry2z,False,,xbl,True,t3_1ir53x,http://www.reddit.com/r/EA_NHL/comments/1ir53x/xbl_breaking_news_the_lockout_is_over_the_return/,

GM Connected Trading Players:

I felt that this has gotten a bit out of control so I talked to the developers to get a clear answer on the whole idea of trading players. Here's the response:

*There is no trading of users as part of the features in GM Connected but if a league wanted to play that way they could arrange that by having players move from one team to another when they agree on a trade.*
 
*There is no mechanism in the game itself to allow you to trade a user to another team. This would be run by the league you are participating in.*",,False,,t5_2ry2z,1343320775.0,,xbl,True,t3_x591p,http://www.reddit.com/r/EA_NHL/comments/x591p/nhl_13_gm_connected_ask_me_anything/,

Now, I'm sitting at about 900.  If you want to point out that I'm ranting because I'm losing, well you might be right, but I think there is some reason as to why.

I honestly think the reason I've been losing is due to having the NHL back and actually watching hockey.  I think that I'm attempting to play my games too much like an NHL team would, and not what wins games in NHL 13.  But, I think that makes NHL 13 have a lot of realism issues when you boil it down.

Firstoff, in an NHL hockey game, teams get rewarded for dumping and chasing, funneling the puck around the zone, behind the net, and putting shots on net, getting deflections, rebound goals, etc.  In NHL 13, teams get rewarded for the same moves, sniping the shortside corner, and really that's about it.

Secondly, I think that pucks are basically glued to the players sticks.  In hockey, just the slightest bump is going to make the player lose the puck, or attempting to skate in a circular motion is going to slow down the player.  I think many players have puck control which is almost unreal, acceleration which is basically unreal, and turning motions which are impossible to make on a consistent basis like they are in the game.  Attempting to pin someone against the boards never works, and just the way that pinning someone against the boards is a one on one thing is flawed in so many ways.

As for goalies, they are way too strong against deflections, and I think the five hole is basically non existent on zone offense and breakaways.  Look how often on a break away a player attempts to shoot five hole, it works quite often.  Also, I think that screening the goalie basically does nothing in Ranked games.

The game relies too much on flashy goals instead of strong team play and good strategy in transition offense and in the offensive zone; hardly ever is an ugly goal scored.

If you agree of disagree I would like to know, but I wish the online games were a bit more simulation of the NHL than having an arcade style hockey (which I know, many people complain about this every year).

Honestly, I could go on and on, but I'm rather curious to know other peoples position on the matter.",,False,,t5_2ry2z,1359471559.0,,xbl,True,t3_17hwqe,http://www.reddit.com/r/EA_NHL/comments/17hwqe/just_a_little_rant_about_the_nonrealisticness_of/,

1342083015.0,20,self.EA_NHL,wfmil,How NHL 13 Should Structure Its Matchmaking in EASHL,24,4,18,http://www.reddit.com/r/EA_NHL/comments/wfmil/how_nhl_13_should_structure_its_matchmaking_in/,"Ok, I just thought about this, and it would make perfect sense. 

EA has already confirmed changes to its matchmaking system, but what could they improve upon? Currently, EA allows you to 
Drop-In"" to a game, or, in English, enter a room. This room fills with players around your level, and when the entire room ready-s up (or the game timer reaches 0:00), you enter a player position selection screen, choose and then you're off to your game. 

What is the biggest problem with this system? As a user, the most notable is that, since character selection comes **after** the player sorting process, the odds that each player in the game will be able to choose their preferred position are 1:1440 [6!*2]. 

Since this does not usually happen, many players drop prematurely from games (oftentimes without leaving the player position select screen where resolution can usually be resolved.) This causes a string of games to happen (especially late night) where it is near impossible to play a full 12player game without wasting too much time in menus or settling for less-than-full games. 

So, how can EA fix this never-ending loop of just 2-4 players jumping from game to game? If I were calling the shots, I'd reverse the whole matchmaking process. Instead of starting in a game room, start with  FIFO preference-based queue. Allow users to select the positions that they would be willing to play, then hit search. While this is searching, a player would be free to roam his club/edit pro menus/chat with friends in party until the search had completed. After this amount of time (depending on available online users), the player (and possibly his party) would be notified and matched up anonymously into an already full room filled with other users who used the same interface and had compatible preferences. Once the team readies (If not readied after *x* seconds, allow system to find a replacement ASAP), the team would be transferred to a quick screen (15 sec. max) where they would learn their team and player position (in accordance to the positions they marked earlier before entering the queue) and have the ability to choose team and jerseys, strategies, exchange phone numbers/sexual fantasies, etc. At this point, the game can start.

So, what are the advantages to this system?

1. The most obvious advantage is that it allows players to play their preferred position, rather than the current ""fastest finger"" method of determining character roles once in-game. This allows players to focus on and develop specific characters with ease. 

2. This method would allow for large parties of players playing together to enter a game on the same team, a feature which is possible, but difficult under the ""Join, Not Create"" room situation we have in NHL 12. 

3. This would give rise to the number of drop-in games played in a full 6v6 Sim-Hockey format. 

One of the only downsides I can come up with against this idea is the likelihood that, especially late night, a lack of volunteers for a specific position could cause new game creation to slow or come to a halt. Other than allowing characters to preference more than one position, EA could counter this measure by adding a ""Random Character"" preference that, when checked, would place the character in whatever slot that is in need. While I would place some kind of minor-moderate bonus on a skater who is chosen this way (for the affected game only), we all know EA can be sticklers when it comes to freebies. 

I'd like to go into the aspects of time from ""I want to play"" to ""I'm playing"", but there are too many variables at play here. On the argument of time, it currently takes, at most, 3 minutes to enter an online game from ""Drop In"" to 6v6 face-off. This is assuming that no one quit during character selection, you didn't have to search for multiple games, etc. During peak times, this new system will undoubtably lower times from ""Want to Play"" to ""Play"". During late night, low use times, the wait might be a little longer. But, as a player, I would rather have a high quality game I had to wait 5 minutes for than a 2v3 all offense game that I had to wait 3 minutes for.

I know this was a long read, but what do you guys think? Could you see EA implementing some features of this into their new matchmaking?

A couple controls I learned that others and n00bs might not know:

1.
L1 to cancel a pass if you're still holding it, and if someone tries to fight you (be the bigger man and walk away) haven't thought of what other actions the L1 button might cancel

2.
L1+Triangle to hack at someone.

3.
**Select** to change the view between following the puck/your player. Tested on Ice/Classic/Goalie view.  Haven't tested for Action(ew) or Broadcast(double ew).

4.
L2 vision control (can't imagine playing without it!) makes your player face the puck.  Can be used to wind up for a one-timer &amp; performing spin-o-rama.
 
Also, can anyone give me advice on how to ""hustle"" with L3, I read you have to click it 3 times but I'm not sure if my player is suppose to actually hustle like a computer player does chasing the puck.

Updated with mostly all the +3's and +5's. I tried to take a lot of typing shortcuts, each boost has an offline req listed first, seperated by // then the online requirement (only have to meet 1 of them to unlock). 

All of the offline ones to do with BAP have to be done with a created skater, if it says 40GP then u have to have played 40 games urself (can sim the last bit of a game to get it to register i believe) 

Online EASHL reqs, some require you to meet a certain stat (blocks, goals, assists, etc) with a games played req also. For ex. if it says score 100 goals in at least 150 GP, you have to score 100 goals, AND have to have 150GP to have met that req.

Figured if you haven't got an EA Season Pass, or were still on the fence about buying NHL 13, this stream will help you decide.
I'll be taking questions about player ratings..modes, and getting into a few games with friends (1 vs 1, OTP, maybe GM Connected).

Edit - First streamed game will probably be Flyers vs. Penguins.
Edit 2 - Stream should start around 7:00pm ET
Edit 3 - Looks like the download is taking forever, so let's say 8:00PM ET

1335749875.0,17,self.EA_NHL,sz11d,NHL 13 suggestions ,28,11,74,http://www.reddit.com/r/EA_NHL/comments/sz11d/nhl_13_suggestions/,"Even though some of you may not agree with me and it's not like EA would listen to suggestions wherever those would even be sent I think the NHL series still has more to be added to it so dicussion? I'll list some things I think should be added. (not in any order of importance)

1.) Playoff beards for the players that would/can grow them

2.) More to the pre-game like adding more showing of warming up or a national anthem or 2 although most of you would probably skip that I think it would be cool to hear Oh Canada and/or the star spangled banner before I got my game on, and to the warming up I think it would be cool to have a shootaround while the game loads or on the main menu being able to back out and shoot some pucks like how you can in the Fifa arena on fifa 12 (for reference) 

3.) GOALIE ATTIRE gah I get so annoyed when I wear the retro jerseys but the goalie will be sporting the same pads as normal, also the goalie masks I think it would be cool if they matched the same graphics that the goalie has in real life and put them on the game. 

4.) Although this may not be allowed by 2k for whatever reason but Hot/Cold streaks and have them effect the ratings of players and more player roles like ""Team Leader"" ""Shoutout Artist"" ""Goon"" and stuff like that although they do have Snipers and Tough guys I still think there could be more.

5.) The commentators mixing it up I, I don't want to hear the same story everytime season after season as in if they could comment on how my team did the previous season and how they're doing currently. For example, if I'm the Blue Jackets and I get them into the playoffs next season talk about how I got into the playoffs after having a horrible season the year before. 

6.) Draft picks and the lottery like how edmonton got the 1st pick but weren't the worst team idk how else to explain it but they use it in NBA 2k12 

7.) Players faces, if players faces could resemble the actual person more so than they already do. 

8.) Faceoffs and players getting kicked out of the faceoff. 

9.) On-the fly line changing for those times you need the freshest and best players. 

10.) Blood during fights and brawls for when you're playing in a heated rivalry like the aves and the wings.

11.) Hockey night in canada previews of games and stuff like that. Don Cherry on NHL 13 oh god it would be beautiful or at least put Barry Melrose on there along with NHL.COM stuff afterall they did mention nhl.com a lot in the game. 

12.) Less Assistant coach involvement, I swear they're always messing with my line-ups on purpose. 

13.) Add the US Juniors and teams like that to be playable like how the CHL is and the BE A PRO mode by being able to be in other leagues like Sweden's Elite league. 

14.) Add the KHL 

15.) These are a lot of points.

16.) More color in the stands like how the coyotes have their whiteouts. 

17.) Have there be the arena annoucer saying that row 123 won a pizza like how they did in NHL 99, really just because Nostalgia and that stuff happens.

18.) Close-ups on star players right before the faceoff. 

19.) Suspensions and Fines should also be added because they do play a part in real life. 

20.) More legends, legendary teams. Oh god playing with the old wings with Probert, Shanahan, Mccarthy, Yzerman, and Fedorov oh boy that would be so much fun to battle with the old aves ohhhhhhhhhhh just think about it man how awesome that would be. 

21.) That's all I can think of tell me if you agree/disagree/have things to add/know a way to get EA on to this stuff.",,False,,t5_2ry2z,True,,xbl,True,t3_sz11d,http://www.reddit.com/r/EA_NHL/comments/sz11d/nhl_13_suggestions/,

It seemed like we had all the math worked out, and many people used it sucessfully, but something always bothered me.

On the EA forums, one of the developers mentioned that your grades are weighted heavier on the position you play the most.

""Impossible"" I thought, ""my method works perfectly, and it doesn't take in to account games played by position. The EA developer must be wrong"". How young and foolish I was.

Thankfully Daiyuki of the EA forums took the time to work me through the proper method of calculating grades, and thanks to him I present a new spreadsheet, [the proper way to get your grades to A-](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0AmBBf8nv_Cd5dFlUUDJmVm1JbmNfaEdfRExCZGVNVVE#gid=0).

It works on the same principle as the old one, just go to your performance tracker for each position, count the number of filled bubbles, input games played and the spreadsheet will tell you the position you should be playing to get your grades up. It will also help you identify your weakest categories. 

If you want to give it a try, just open the spreadsheet, hit File &gt; Make a Copy. I've been wrong once before, so it wouldn't hurt to have a few people try it out to make sure it's accurate.

PSN Players make a habit of gathering the masses together for a night of OTP every Tuesday Night at 8:30pm EST. To find us, go to *Online &gt; Community &gt; Lobby &gt; Game Modes* and look for the **reddit** room. The password is always **bacon**!

2. New to NHL 12 ~~are goalie fights~~ is the establishment of a PSN EA NHL TeamSpeak 3 server, brought to you by ~~Verizon~~ [Mikealcl.](http://www.reddit.com/user/Mikealcl) You can download TeamSpeak 3 for your computer, android, or iPhone [on their main site.](http://www.teamspeak.com/?page=downloads) Unfortunately, the iPhone version is $4.99. 

3. We use the TeamSpeak server for Tuesday OTP Night, but we're also using it to coordinate random drop-in games, random all-reddit OTP, and whatever else. There's a a main lobby, two OTP channels, and a channel for each PSN Team. If you're playing NHL 12 on PS3, pop into the channel when you want some company. **Server:** *mikeal.com* / **port:** *default*

4. If you're looking for an EASHL Club to join, we probably have you covered too. Check out the list on the sidebar for more details and contact a club to see if they have room or talk to some of the regulars on TeamSpeak. If the clubs are full, maybe you can post and create your own? They're a lot of ~~forever alone~~ free agents out there...

Preferably an EA programmer.

The bug is when you lose a player off the roster, due to injury or trade, and when you go to roster moves/lines to fix it, it puts you in the wrong league and then refuses to let you switch. So you're looking at your AHL roster, it's the NHL one that has the problem, and you can't switch leagues or leave the screen. Only choice is Best Lines, and then I spend ten minutes resetting my lines on both teams.. and then next game I get an injury and have to do it all again. 

I ..I don't even have anything productive to say. I just hate this. And lazy fucking ea, not play testing or issuing patches. 12 had its qwirks, but this, this is a fucking 18 year old bug that's back.

Does anyone else notice how slow the GM Connected menu system is?  It is completely unbearable for me.  Every time I change a screen it takes about 30 seconds.  Even switching up and down between menu options is slow.  

I am a computer programmer by day and I can't believe this is how they coded it.  Why do they need to load irrelevant data on certain screens?  Also, they should store the data that they do load in a cache somewhere, that way when I come back to it, it only needs to be updated if something has changed using a check bit or rsync method.  For example, it keeps telling me it is downloading match data.  Why don't you put that shit on another screen so you don't waste my time while I am just trying to mess with my rosters?  I feel like they could have stored a lot more of this information locally instead of wasting bandwidth and load times.

At this point, if it doesn't get fixed, it's broken to me and I won't be able to play GM Connected.  Absolutely ludicrous. 

Note: I realize that the slowness may because the servers are overloaded because of the release.  Also they may still be trying to work out the bugs.  At this point however, it's basically unusable for me.

+ No more bullshit ballet on the ice.

+ Goalies seem to be solid. There's also finally a noticeable difference between star goalies and scrubs.

+ There's a huge difference in how the players feel depending on how good they are at certain things. This is a GREAT thing.

+ Scoring is finally done right more or less. We are supposed to score most of the goals on good shots from good position by good shooters,and that's what I'm seeing so far. 

+ It's finally possible to play D. Stay in position and you'll be fine.

+ A nice little touch is passing. You almost never will be able to receive a fully charged pass,while feathers always connect unless intercepted. You have to time yourself right.

I'd like to hear your opinions and discussion as well, whether you prefer the old or new system.

Like most of my friends I play both NHL and Fifa. We play a lot together but many of us have also had ultimate teams. Everyone has always loved the HUT system while FUT was ""worse but the best available option for football ultimate team"".

Now they've gone and copied the shitty FUT system to HUT 13. I can't even imagine who's idea it was and why.

Cons of the new system:  
- No career limit. Once you get a superstar player he'll be in your lineup until the release of NHL 14. Less changes in roster. Makes building a team more boring.  
- No salary cap. Promising rookies are worthless. No point in searching for not as well known players with good potential when you might as well fill your team with today's superstars. This makes trading more dull than before. Also you don't have to choose between focusing on offense or defense. Paying for cards is even more beneficial than before.     
- Contracts are useless. Before they were tied to the training and salary cap. Now they're just a tax for playing the game. Contracts don't benefit you in any way.  

Pros:  
- Injuries, though this would be entirely possible to implement with the old system as well.   
- Reassigning player positions. Same as above.   
Can't think of anything else. If you have something to add please comment.

**edit.** Also, why the hell are you not able to see your opponent's roster or even the star ratings before a game? It's ridiculous. Like they're purposfully hidden.

I spent a good deal of time managing San Jose; they accounted for 15 of my 20 seasons. One of my top guys in the AHL was a young forward named Geordie Wudrick.

Now, you're probably wondering where I'm going with this. I arrived at my university's game tonight about 30mins before puck drop, and as usual I looked over the roster for each team - and one name leapt off the page. Wearing #18 for the home team was Wudrick. It seems he's come back from playing in Europe and has started his degree.

As if it wasn't enough the be the defending CIS champs, #1 ranked team in the CIS and getting a guy who was playing pro in Europe, they added another new player to the roster - Shayne Wiebe, who recorded 4 points in 12 games with the St John's IceCaps this season.

But here are a couple things that really grind my gears.  First and foremost, the inability to pick your position before starting a drop in game.  I'm tired of playing with five forwards, and a goalie who thinks its cool to do nothing but desperation saves.  Its infuriating.  Let me pick the position I want to play **before** I get into a locker room.  This would eliminate people who normally play forward ""getting stuck"" playing defense, and generally make it a better experience.  

Now that I've got that off of my chest, my second gripe...  When playing an EASHL game (non drop-in), I would really liked to be matched up against people who have a similar skill level to myself.  I'm sorry but we really don't stand a chance against guys who have 200 games played and 600 points under their belt.  

I'm not a terrible player, I'm averaging about a point and a half a game, roughly.  So why would an average player in the Amateur league be put up against an Elite Playoff Champs team???  I have no problems losing, but when its 7-1, fuck everything about that.

What if the goalie controlled that skater for the period of time?

I would assume the only reason it hasn't been done is because it is too much of a hassle for the little time the goalie is off the ice, but how cool would it be to skate to the bench, have YOUR PERSONAL FORWARD come out and score with an empty net?

Now I'm not here to place blame on EA but rather point out that the silent majority in this community would like a more sim based experience. Sony has mastered the sports sim with mlb the show, and because of this many of us feel like ea is lacking or falling behind. We as a community should push for a more sim style approach for this franchise before it goes the way of COD. 13 showed a lot of potential early on but the lack of updates past November allowed players to find and abuse the ai in the game, this is the one thing that is holding this game back, and it needs to be addressed.

VERY CHEAP PLUG FOR /r/EA_FIFA brought to you by our fearless ~~dictator~~ leader SHANE_SOLO

Welcome everybody to OTP night!
For those of you that are new the sub-reddit and/or new to the game here are a few things you should know about OTP night:

1. To get to our lobby it goes as follows (From the NHL 13 main menu) Online&gt; Community&gt;Lobby&gt; Games modes&gt; REDDIT. Once you find the reddit room you will find out that it is password protected. To solve this problem enter the password which is ""bacon"". This will be the password from now until the end of time.

2. We DO NOT use the standard PlayStation 3 headsets. We use Teamspeak 3, so we can talk to everybody during the game and talk a little fun trash. You can find the application [---&gt;HERE!!!&lt;---](http://www.teamspeak.com/?page=downloads) The server is hosted on a default port and the server address is mikeal.com. If you can't get Team Speak 3 for PC there are also Teamspeak clients for IOS and Android. The IOS client is $5, and the Android client is free for now but it is also in BETA.

3. We play for fun, but participants are expected to play realistic sim hockey. So please, keep the glitch goals to a minimum. Also, on that note be respectful to other people. Some others will not be as good, due to being new, as a community we will do our best to help you become a better player. TL;DR - Don't be a chode.

4. The Games begin at 8:30 EST/5:30 PST. It's recommended to get on Teamspeak(Details above) and in the Reddit room before it starts to guarantee your spot in the first game(s). That being said, if you miss a game don't panic, there will be another game in 15-30 minutes max.

5. The way teams are picked during OTP night is by captains picks, so if you're picked last don't worry. If you do not have teamspeak it gets a little hard to figure out which side you're going to play on. IF you cannot get teamspeak for some reason, wait until everybody else is picked and go to the last team.

* One of the things that I've found is that tapping the passing button -as the puck is winging around the boards- will set your player in ""hold the puck in"" mode...which has been sorely missing. 

* I've also noticed that while the defense is overall vastly improved, the player don't have eyes in the pack of their heads. Passes to the slot, or tops of the circles, are there for the taking. 

* Deke-wise, some of the more complicated loose puck dekes have been made simpler/less sensitive. Most notable the Datsyukian shift (backhand, LB, quickly flip both sticks in, and then out). 

* The cycle...a much, much more effective/realistic strategy. The player battles really bring this strategy to the forefront (as well as one timers). 

* And lastly, good skaters do not fall down after pulling 2 180s in a row...


Edit
* One Touch passing is greatly improved. A simple tap will now push the 2nd pass at a reasonable speed...HUGE CHANGE",,False,,t5_2ry2z,True,,,True,t3_judxs,http://www.reddit.com/r/EA_NHL/comments/judxs/reddit_nhl_12_tips_what_youve_found_so_far/,

&gt;With this setting on, it will enable the on-ice visual guides that show where a selected player should properly position during a forecheck.

So far it's pretty cool... when the puck is loose or in the other team's possession below their hash marks, you see a few on ice indicators.  One shows the ideal ""target"" area for body position/pokechecking (yellow circle with the area behind the player in red, possibly to indicate an area where you can't get the puck or potential for a tripping penalty).

A grid will also pop up showing where your player *should* be, which seems especially handy when you are relinquishing control of the puck and getting ready to stop the opposing team's breakout.

1344877019.0,14,self.EA_NHL,y5haw,Can we have a real discussion about “glitch” goals?,24,10,57,http://www.reddit.com/r/EA_NHL/comments/y5haw/can_we_have_a_real_discussion_about_glitch_goals/,"I see a lot a talk about glitch goals all the time, but I think that the main cause is that the people who continuously suffer from them are just bad at hockey, not the video game just understanding the sport. 

First I will say there is some area I think the AI should improve on, and with NHL13 I think the whole ice awareness will actually help in those aspects, but of course that remains to be seen. I think it will turn out that people will no longer be able to score because the AI will be too good, and most human players are pretty terrible and they will have to turn it down. BUT like I said we will see.

The thing that absolutely pisses me off to no end is that some people cannot grasp that there is a difference between a high probability scoring opportunity in real life and the game and a pure video game glitch goal. 

2 on 1s are a high probability scoring chance; you should score on a lot of them. It was addressed in the new game because now the goalie will sometimes cheat over, which will make the player with the puck have to decided between passing or shooting where before passing was almost always the best chance to score because the goalie wouldn’t even know the other players was there. I never considered this a glitch goal, because it was something that happened in real life all the time, it’s a good scoring chance and people get so pissed off when it was there fault it was a 2 on 1 to begin with.

Another one that I always get annoyed with is the wrap around goals. They happen in real life all the time when the player just moves faster than the goalie, and if you chased me around the net and left the whole front of it open I should probably be able to score easily. 

The only thing I ever really thought was a total glitch goal was the curve shot because it was really just a long range wrist shot that had no business going in 80% of the time when it should have been stopped 90% of the time. 

I think part of the problem comes when people are able to build their online characters to 99 when the NHL players are never that high, and it creates a large skill mismatch between the generic online players and those weaker human players which I cant really see how it can be avoided while still rewarding the better and more experienced players.

The more reason why I have this opinion is that when playing offline on superstar, the game is genuinely hard. The AI reacts really well and it should only get better with the new game. Save for the curve shot nothing really works all the time because the computer plays good defense where as most players online are god awful at it which I think is where the whole “I’m not terrible, it’s a glitch mindset comes from.”

Also one final thing, I never thought there were glitch goals that could be scored on human goalies because they always involved the AI doing the wrong reactions, but some people online keep trying to tell me there are. Are there any in your opinion?

OTP night was designed to be a way to kick back and play some casual hockey with redditors.  The main thing was that it be lighthearted and fun.  No arguing, or yelling at someone for making a mistake.  And it has been that for the most part, and I thank everyone for that.

However, it was also designed to be a way to get away from the general OTP/Drop-In crowd of people that refuse to play their position and grief their own team.  It feels like our OTP night has started to get a little bit of that creeping in.  I am not the only person who has noticed it.  Several have complained about it.

Mistakes are OK in OTP night, but consistently playing out of position is not.  OTP Night games are ranked, which means that they affect your grades.  It kinda sucks when you are near your next card and a bad OTP game knocks you back in grades.  Before I get any, ""Calm down, it's just a game"" comments, I'm not upset, yes it is just a game but I think most people want to play the game right and not have their game affected by someone else refusing to play as a team.  If you want to do your own thing and not be a team player, you need to be playing online versus, not OTP.  If you play OTP you need to consider your teammates, it's not too much to ask.

So, what does everyone think?  Should we make OTP Night unranked so we don't have to worry about it? Or would everyone prefer to keep it ranked, but call someone out when they are constantly out of position.  ***I am NOT talking about trashing someone or yelling at them for making a mistake, but when someone is frequently out of position, kindly request that they correct themselves.  I think we can all act like adults about this right?  Please don't call anyone out specifically in this thread, save it for during the game if needed***

OTP night for me has been the best thing about this game since it started back in NHL11 and I hope it stays that way.

It seems like you can take any team, no matter how terrible, and turn them into a Stanley Cup contender, even on hard, within 2-5 years.

This boils down to the fact that there are just far too many good prospects. There's absolutely no reason to even bother with players below three stars, because there are so many three star and three and a half star players in the game. If you keep your system down to 8-9 players in each forward position, and 12-14 in defense, everybody develops quickly. When you draft somebody with more potential as a replacement, you can generally trade your 3/3.5 star guys who are developing for decent draft picks, or bundled together for higher potential players......

Prospects at 4 stars or higher.....even 3.5 stars are far too common. There's also no real variance in how stars develop, or at least it doesn't seem that way. There's no Alexander Daigles that seem like sure things, but end up as busts. There are also no Daniel Alfredsson's, that get picked in the later rounds, and come out of the abyss to become franchise stars. 

Also because of how useless anybody under three stars is, any draft picks beyond the second or third round are useless. You can just bundle up later picks, or prospects drafted in the later rounds who aren't on contracts and try to work your way into turning 5 later picks into a third round pick, or a few third round picks into a first round pick.

Unless I'm missing something, there doesn't seem to be any ""No Trade Clause"", which would be a great way to add some actual risk to resigning stars. It'd be cool to see them add that, or some sort of element where the players are dicks and request trades if you refuse to play them on higher lines, or just because they think the citizens in your city are pricks.

This is my first NHL game in years. I'm not sure if this GM mode is a lot different than past years....and I understand I'm a bit late to the party. But is this a common sentiment, that the GM mode is far too easy?

### Calling All NHL13 Free Agents!

We - Puck Goes First (PGF) - are looking to add a few active players to our roster. We've ran into problems with inactivity over the past few months and, as anyone will attest to, 2- and 3-man games can get pretty frustrating if the AI Gods go against you.

We are pretty flexible with our definition of ""active"" so if you've got stuff going on that might limit your activeness, either temporarily *(ex: a vacation)* or longer term *(ex: school)*, that's fine... just let us know before-hand. As long as you make an attempt to be active, you'll be fine.

If you're interested in joining, here's how you can get a tryout:

1. Message one of our GMs *([myself](/u/radapex), [Mikealcl](/u/mikealcl) or [MoNDoGuY](/u/MoNDoGuY))* to arrange an individual tryout via OTP or club invite. *(club invite tryouts for the rest of November only)*; or
2. Attend our open tryout this weekend. More information will be posted later this week.

If you have any questions, please feel free to ask.",,False,,t5_2ry2z,False,,psn,True,t3_13wlnn,http://www.reddit.com/r/EA_NHL/comments/13wlnn/psn_puck_goes_first_looking_to_recruit_active/,

Last night in drop-in was the most awesome comeback I've been a part of. We were down 3-0 early in the 1st period against a much better team and managed to hold them off while getting shut out through the 2nd and most of the 3rd. With 32 seconds left, we got an icing on them and took the faceoff in the offensive zone. I turned up our forecheck just hoping to not get shut out and we managed to score 3 goals in the next 14 seconds!

How to Adjust Volume Levels using MP3Gain

This is useful if you like to adjust the volume level of your tracks. I put all the songs at 102-103DB. This is a setting that generally works well when the songs are transferred to the video game.


Here is a tool that I use to do this. The program is called MP3Gain It's free on their site and it's completely safe. This is what I use to increase the volume levels of multiple song clips. It's really easy to use and the reason I want you guys to use it is because it saves me time. This way you can just download my files at my custom DB levels (Usually 102-103DB) and then if you want to adjust you can just use this program.

In the game it this is how it generally sounds at these various sound levels.

99-100 Decibels = Soft (Generally low to very low levels of sound in game)

101-102 Decibels = Medium (Generally low to medium levels of sound in game)

103-104 Decibels = Loud (Generally medium to loud levels of sound in game)

105-106 Decibels = Very Loud (Generally loud to very loud levels of sound in game)

Part 2: Intermission

What are intermission tunes?
Intermission tunes are song clips that are played in between periods. When playing an OTP/EASHL games the break can last up to 90 seconds at times so having these clips helps simulate the music played during NHL intermission. These are useful in all game modes though. There are 512 clips at 90 seconds each. I split this into 3 downloads since the whole thing is 1.35GB. Each file below is about 450MB each.

Part 3: Organ

What are organ tunes?
Organ tunes have many uses. You can make a playlist and combine them with the break in play tunes. You can just choose to only use organ tunes. You can apply team specific organ tunes to the teams who have it. It's really all up to you on how you want to customize your music experience in NHL 12.

CD: How to put the goal horn songs on your Xbox 360 using Itunes

*You will need a program called WinRar. To download this, go to this link http://www.rarlab.com/ and scroll down until you see the 3.93 release. Download in the language you want (English for most).

*Some people say you can use a USB flashdrive to transfer music to your Xbox 360 but I do not know how (any help appreciated)

1. Download the files.
2. Once the folder is open in WinRar, click on ""WIZARD"" to ""unpack"" the files to your desktop.
3. Open up Itunes
4. Click File
5. Under File click Import
6. Import the playlist(The HMP one)
7. Create a new playlist in itunes(under file)
8. Put all the horns/songs into that playlist(right click add to playlis *enter name here*)
9. Burn it
10. Put the Disc into your Xbox
11. Rip it
12. Rename the songs properly
13. Once they are on your Xbox load up the NHL game
14. Go to the the menus and look for the custom music section
15. Apply the sounds to the appropriate areas

If you do not like the games default horn AND song
What I usually do is when the goal horn doesn't sound right in the game I use the GHS (goal horn song). This clip contains a custom horn and song together. I insert that in the horn slot and then disable the default song slot. The end result is that the custom goal horn song clip plays all the way through.

If you like default horns but want custom songs
You can also ONLY use the song. If you like the games default horn all you would have to do is just take the song clip and put it in the song slot.

I wanted to know which player type was the best for the stats which I valued the most. I noticed that depending on the player type, the cost to raise a point would go from 10 to 20 to 30 at different rates.

I used this graph to calculate how much XP was needed to raise each stat to 90, for each player type, and compiled the data in this spreadsheet. I suggest you open the sheet now and try to follow my line of thinking:

Look in the top right corner, cells A/B, 1-5.
This shows a Power Forward. His deking skill starts at 70. Every 10 points you raise it, the ""cost"" goes up 10. So once a PWF has a deking of 80, it costs 20 XP to raise it one more point. In total, to have a PWF with a deking of 90, it costs 300 XP.

I hope your still following my line thought, we're almost there.
If you look in the deking column, you can see the coloured cells going down: Sniper: 200, Playmaker: 200, Grinder: 900, etc

With this, you can determine whoever has the lowest value, is the best for that given stat.

If you look over to cells AA and beyond, I sorted all of the player types under the different attributes, so you can see at a glance who has the most skill for a given attribute. I gave them each a colour, so you can quickly scan across and see the advantages and disadvantages of each one.

I spent a good few days, and many beers making this, I hope people out there find it useful.

So I've had every game since 09. But there are 5 things I really disliked this year, and wanna know how the community feels about these things.

1. Simulation Engine: I feel NHL has a really bad simulation engine for Be a GM. Like, teams with 4 1/2 stars at every spot (Off, Def, Goalie) will get 13th in the conference while a team with 3 1/2 Stars offense, 4 Star D, and 3 1/2 Goalie will get a top 4 seed. Plus Ovechkin scores like 60 goals every season when I sim, except when I control the Caps.

2. Goalie BS: When I play offline BAP, my goalie will give up the most bullshit goals. Like, he won't stick to the post from a centimeter outside the crease and they'll take a slapshot into the .001"" of room between me and the post.

3. Defense, AI and User: AI will just grab the puck all willy nilly, no problem. And try to pass the puck, you fucking can't. But with your d-man, you can't poke the puck off for shit and they just skate around and eventually get into the slot. It's a joke.

4. GM Reputation: Like, I lose reputation for no reason. On medium I start off by not playing the Junior game and I only have one phone after the draft. wut?

5. Online bulkiness: It's so bulky with your pro online. Like, I don't play a lot which is why he's so bulky and hard to navigate, but that's the reason I don't play. Why make your players impossible to navigate? What's the point of having 6's when the big defenseman are faster than your 5'8"" forward you put all your points into speed and agility?

Is it just me or is this game absolutely  shite? I loved NHL 12, and I was alright. I don't know what's going on in this game with me, but something isn't driving home.


To start off, I'm constantly losing possession on a little bump from an opponent. Conversely, when I straight up slam into some tiny little motherfucker at mach fucking 5, not only does he not fall down (or react, for that matter) but he doesn't lose possession of the fucking puck. And that fucking happens more often that not.


I don't think I need to address the goalies, because I'm pretty sure it's an issue for everyone. The weird thing is, when I play a guy, he absolutely shits on my goalie, no matter what. And on my end, I'm getting blanked. I honestly think I had the record for most shutouts-against in my GM League. 


Any poke-check an opponent throws in my general direction makes me flail from the puck like a fucking bitch. If I remotely glance at my R1 button, I either get penalized or fucked out of position. 


Are there some mechanics that I'm not getting? It feels like I can't keep possession of the god damn puck in any of my games. 


My rebounds are fuck-all. It can go through about three of my own guys and then get to some random ass winger on the opposing team who sets fire to his cock rocket and blasts one by my goaltender with some weak ass backhander from the point. The fuck is that shit?


Also, when I play GM league games, for some reason unbeknownst to me, regardless of if I win or lose a faceoff my defenders skate into each other... And then the defender/winger on their team passes it to the center who skated past my defense and poops one into the net. 


I guess it is entirely possible that I'm just really really bad at this game, but that doesn't make any fucking sense. 


On top of my incredibly special defense, it seems like whoever I play against has some secret knowledge of puck possession. Not that I haven't already mentioned this, but between my actions and my computer's, the opposing team seems to keep their puck. I've had so many situations where the motherfucker literally skates into/through half my fucking team and gotten some crazy bullshit scoring chances.


I know all of the basics, etc. but when I apply them, I am constantly shit on. I'm practically up to my neck in steamy shit, and it's starting to really get under my skin. (In case you didn't gather)



Sorry for blowing up and a wall of text. I really have no idea what the fuck to do anymore. I want to be able to enjoy this game, but constantly losing with all this bullfuckingshit can really start to piss a guy off.",,False,,t5_2ry2z,False,,,True,t3_18fpjx,http://www.reddit.com/r/EA_NHL/comments/18fpjx/i_need_some_serious_help_and_the_problem_is_im/,

Come join us this week on your respective platforms! Details below!     
      

*****

##XBL

This is a weekly EA_SHL / OTP game done every Wednesday at 8:30 EST. The name of the game is EA's EASHL/OTP pick up games with your own custom made player. These games do count towards your overall performance tracker record so it is a great way to pad your stats in a comfortable, exploit free, and noob friendly environment. We take all skill levels and this is a great way to learn the game. No experience required but we do ask that you pre-make your character ahead of time as we don't wait for you. Games start at 8:35 EST. If you don't make it by that time, we are starting without you and you'll have to wait till the first game is over. Usually 20 minutes or so

* The room disappears when we make a game so don't look for it at 8:40 if you are late. If you can, feel free to make the room yourself and wait there for us! Additionally, shoot a message to WendingoPSU and we'll cue you up when we are making the next round of games.

* We typically do a party chat. XBL has an 8 person limit for party chat which we often hit. If you can't get into the party don't fret, everyone goes to game chat during the game(s) so it isn't a big deal. I type in game chat and will be looking to get a speaking server for next week 2/15.

* We typically get 4-5 games in and usually run till about 10-10:30 at night. You can find the room we play in by going to Xbox Live -&gt; Community -&gt; Lobby: Then cycling downwards till you see a room called 'Reddit'

* Remember... If it is your first night, you have to fight.

* Room name: Reddit Password: **narwhal** (note the lack of e, and lowercase n)

**New for This Week**

* Reddit EA_SHL Draft League: Given the success of the last time we did this, we're going to be holding another draft and play series. This will be a little different then the last time we did it.

* We're thinking 4 teams of 4. Round Robin league play over 1 night, with memorial cup style playoff system (maybe the final is best of 3?) This enables us to complete this over 2 weeks.

* Other options are to play a double round robin over 2 weeks and have a 3 team playoff on week three) or simply play a traditional best of 5 playoff series over 2 weeks. Any thoughts? I'm looking for feedback.
Start thinking XBL-ers!

**Mumble is optional but for the sake of organizing we'll be using it.**      

XBL uses Mumble to communicate during OTP night. The server is *eanhl.servebeer.com* . You can download the mumble client at these links:      
[* Mumble](http://mumble.sourceforge.net/)       
[* Mumble for Android](http://www.appbrain.com/app/mumble-for-android-beta/org.pcgod.mumbleclient)       
[* Mumble for iOS](http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/mumble/id443472808?ls=1&amp;mt=8http://mumble.sourceforge.net/)

##PSN

   
**Here is how you join us this week!**    
    
* Look for the reddit room in the Game Modes lobby (from the NHL12 main menu: Online &gt; Community &gt; Lobby &gt; Game Modes). As always, the password will be **bacon**    
* Don't forget to complete the OTP night experience by joining us on Teamspeak 3, as well. The server is hosted on the default port at mikeal.com. If you don't already have the TS3 client, you can download the normal client for free [HERE](http://www.teamspeak.com)    
* There are also mobile TS3 clients available for Android or iPhone. I don't personally own either, so this may be inaccurate, but my understanding is that the Android beta client is currently free but the iPhone client costs $5.
* This is also a great way to join one of the Reddit teams or meet others who want to join/form teams! Make sure to post here if you are new and see what happens!    
    
  
**Basic Info**    

* Get here at 8:25 EST to ensure you get in on the first game(s) and to help make it easier to plan games. First game(s) starts at 8:30 EST so be there!    
* Make sure you are on Teamspeak (details above). We try to split up games so everyone can play, but those with out team speak don't know this! Sometimes people have their PS3 mics hooked up too, but don't count on it! Same happens when we pick captains...    
* Room makers! Make sure we have decided on how many people are ready to play, and how many are in each game if there are more than one, and make the room max out at that number! Sometimes people get impatient (understood) and make a 12 man game, and then 4 people sit in the lobby, when we could have played 2 4v4 games...

Come join us this week on your respective platforms! Details below!

##XBL

This is a weekly EA_SHL / OTP game done every Wednesday at 8:30 EST. The name of the game is EA's EASHL/OTP pick up games with your own custom made player. These games do count towards your overall performance tracker record so it is a great way to pad your stats in a comfortable, exploit free, and noob friendly environment. We take all skill levels and this is a great way to learn the game. No experience required but we do ask that you pre-make your character ahead of time as we don't wait for you. Games start at 8:35 EST. If you don't make it by that time, we are starting without you and you'll have to wait till the first game is over. Usually 20 minutes or so

* The room disappears when we make a game so don't look for it at 8:40 if you are late. If you can, feel free to make the room yourself and wait there for us! Additionally, shoot a message to WendingoPSU and we'll cue you up when we are making the next round of games.

* We typically do a party chat. XBL has an 8 person limit for party chat which we often hit. If you can't get into the party don't fret, everyone goes to game chat during the game(s) so it isn't a big deal. I type in game chat and will be looking to get a speaking server for next week 2/15.

* We typically get 4-5 games in and usually run till about 10-10:30 at night. You can find the room we play in by going to Xbox Live -&gt; Community -&gt; Lobby: Then cycling downwards till you see a room called 'Reddit'

* Remember... If it is your first night, you have to fight.

* Room name: Reddit Password: Narwhal (note the lack of e!)

**XBL is trying out a new voice chat option using mumble this week.** *eanhl.servebeer.com* **is the address and you can download the mumble client @ http://mumble.sourceforge.net/.**

##PSN

   
**Here is how you join us this week!**    
    
* Look for the reddit room in the Game Modes lobby (from the NHL12 main menu: Online &gt; Community &gt; Lobby &gt; Game Modes). As always, the password will be **bacon**    
* Don't forget to complete the OTP night experience by joining us on Teamspeak 3, as well. The server is hosted on the default port at mikeal.com. If you don't already have the TS3 client, you can download the normal client for free at http://www.teamspeak.com    
* There are also mobile TS3 clients available for Android or iPhone. I don't personally own either, so this may be inaccurate, but my understanding is that the Android beta client is currently free but the iPhone client costs $5.
* This is also a great way to join one of the Reddit teams or meet others who want to join/form teams! Make sure to post here if you are new and see what happens!    
    
  
**Basic Info**    

* Get here at 8:25 EST to ensure you get in on the first game(s) and to help make it easier to plan games. First game(s) starts at 8:30 EST so be there!    
* Make sure you are on Teamspeak (details below). We try to split up games so everyone can play, but those with out team speak don't know this! Sometimes people have their PS3 mics hooked up too, but don't count on it! Same happens when we pick captains...    
* Room makers! Make sure we have decided on how many people are ready to play, and how many are in each game if there are more than one, and make the room max out at that number! Sometimes people get impatient (understood) and make a 12 man game, and then 4 people sit in the lobby, when we could have played 2 4v4 games...    
* Once a game is started, jump down to one of the OTP rooms on teamspeak so that all the new people coming in are in the lobby and it is easy for them to see and talk to other people waiting. If we play in the lobby, I have a feeling new people sign on, can't get a word in or are timid, and leave.    
* Be patient! If you miss a game, there will be another in 20 minutes or less if there are 2 staggered games going on so come back!    
* While OTP night is not highly competitive and more about having fun, players are still expected to play Sim style hockey. Play your position and pass the puck. Above all, be respectful.

Hopefully you've noticed that I've updated the CSS Stylesheet of EA_NHL. I'm hoping you like it as much as I do, though there may be some tweaks happening over the next few days. I'd like to point out that I owe redditor [nerdigurumi](http://www.reddit.com/user/nerdigurumi) for most of the work. If you want to drop her a PM to thank her for it, please do. If you have complaints, please send those to ME.

**Now with Reddit Flair...**


In other news, the reddit admins have created an easy way for subreddits to incorporate ""reddit flair"" next to your username. This is perfect for a subreddit like ours, as you won't have to keep telling people which system you play on and what your ID/Gamertag is. I am only going to implement a text based ID for starters, but if you guys would like icons for your console type -- we can look into doing that in the coming weeks.

**A Simple Survey...**


To make it easier for me to add the flair to the subreddit, I created a survey for you to give me some feedback. You can then input your information for reddit flair so I can make that happen for you. The other questions are not required, but I'd appreciate your input. If you just want flair, hit up the last 4 questions.

**Please make sure you input your CONSOLE NAMEand REDDIT USERNAME exactly as it needs to appear! If you realized you messed up after sending the form, just send it again!**

* vote to kick players from your drop-in team.

* When someone presses pause during a game it puts them in to ""take a break mode"" (ai takes over your player) instead of stopping the game for everyone

* Goalies who can pick up the puck when it gets stuck on the side of the net. For the matter, give the goalie the ability to cover the puck sitting in front of them. Too many times I've seen them try to cover the ice nowhere near the puck. [Exactly like this](http://www.myspace.com/video/vid/8350616)

* List of the PSN id's of who you're playing with.

* **EDIT: Instead of disable goalie pass, have a button ""hold puck"", which would negate any call for pass from your teammates. This could apply to any skater, not just the goalie.**

* Voice chat that works

* Pre-select your position, get matched up in a game based on skill/position, instead of a race to get what you want

* Decent xp earning system instead of ""play x games""

I scored the 4 goals to tie the game and made it to OT. About a minute into OT the Kings make a long cross ice pass through the neutral zone and Carter collects the pass BEHIND him, with both feet about 2 feet offsides. He then proceeds to skate down the left wing boards, shrug off a pretty vicious hit and let fly with a lazily bouncing backhander. As if the 2 feet offsides part wasn't dumb enough, the puck bounces in on Brodeur who's in the butterfly position, hits the toe of his skate as he slides forward just enough to leave a puck sized opening between himself and the post. The puck loses all forward momentum, hovers/wobbles a few inches in front of the goal line, and then darts forward and stops just over the line. All the while Brodeur shuffles around on his knees and barely even blinks when the puck goes in, ending his hopes to win the Stanley Cup.

It's a pretty basic show).  So from here on out, I'll take subtitle recommendations each week!  This week's comes from Gibsons 12 Year!

It's OTP night tonight on Xbox Live!

What is OTP?  OTP Night is a weekly EASHL / OTP game done every Wednesday at 8:30 EST. These games do count towards your overall performance tracker record so it is a great way to pad your stats in a comfortable, exploit free, and n00b friendly environment. We take all skill levels and this is a great way to learn the game.

No experience required but we do ask that you pre-make your characters ahead of time as we don't wait for you. Games start at 8:30 EST and can last up to 5 hours or more if there's enough players.  If you don't make it to the room by that time, we might start without you and you'll have to wait till the first game is over. Usually 20 minutes or so.

You can find the room by going to Xbox Live -&gt; Community

Slide over to the ""Lounge"" area and find the room named ""reddit"".  Password will be ""nhl""

That's it!  Any questions, leave them in the comments here, and someone will get back to you at some point!

AND REMEMBER!  If it's your first night, **YOU HAVE TO FIGHT**

For those of you that are new the sub-reddit and/or new to the game here are a few things you should know about OTP night:

1. To get to our lobby it goes as follows (From the NHL 13 main menu) Online&gt; Community&gt;Lobby&gt; Games modes&gt; REDDIT. Once you find the reddit room you will find out that it is password protected. To solve this problem enter the password which is ""bacon"". This will be the password from now until the end of time.

2. We DO NOT use the standard PlayStation 3 headsets. We use Teamspeak 3, so we can talk to everybody during the game and talk a little fun trash. You can find the application [---&gt;HERE!!!&lt;---](http://www.teamspeak.com/?page=downloads) The server is hosted on a default port and the server address is mikeal.com. If you can't get Team Speak 3 for PC there are also Teamspeak clients for IOS and Android. The IOS client is $5, and the Android client is free for now but it is also in BETA.

3. We play for fun, but participants are expected to play realistic sim hockey. So please, keep the glitch goals to a minimum. Also, on that note be respectful to other people. Some others will not be as good, due to being new, as a community we will do our best to help you become a better player. TL;DR - Don't be a chode.

4. The Games begin at 8:30 EST/5:30 PST. It's recommended to get on Teamspeak(Details above) and in the Reddit room before it starts to guarantee your spot in the first game(s). That being said, if you miss a game don't panic, there will be another game in 15-30 minutes max.

5. The way teams are picked during OTP night is by captains picks, so if you're picked last don't worry. If you do not have teamspeak it gets a little hard to figure out which side you're going to play on. IF you cannot get teamspeak for some reason, wait until everybody else is picked and go to the last team.

We need more GMs and lots more Players! 


As of right now there are:

18 people who want to be GMs.

2 people who want to be Assistant/Co-GMs

5 people who want to be players on a team run by a GM

Assuming the Assistant/Co-GMs are willing to run a team until a replacement comes, that makes 20 GMs.  Not bad so far but I hope we can attract more.  Much more! 

Currently there are 10 GMs who are planning to run a team of only themselves and AI.  
There are also 10 GMs who want to run a team with themselves and other human players. 
An even split.  

I just want to make sure it is clear to everyone there are [5 ways to play games in GM Connected:](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gf52GpMVh5I&amp;feature=player_detailpage#t=82s)

1. Player vs Computer

2. Head-to-Head

3. Co-op Online Team Play 

4. Coach Your Team

5. Build Your Own AI

**Season length.**  
I hadn't even considered this yet but Mewen has suggested either having the season follow the entire year or breaking up the year in to 4 seasons with Playoffs and all.  
I like the idea of having 4 seasons over the year.  Everything is still up for discussion.  I can create another poll later on when I know what else needs to be asked. 

**Starting Rosters** 
&gt; EA chose against including fantasy draft because it didn't want the barrier of entry to be a tedious 45-round draft. If you want to mix up the teams so no one is forced to play with the Edmonton Oilers (zing!) you can randomize the rosters when starting the league. ([source](http://www.gameinformer.com/games/nhl_13/b/xbox360/archive/2012/06/01/everything-we-know-about-nhl-13-39-s-gm-connected-mode.aspx))

I am assuming we'll have to randomize the rosters, but this will be included on the next poll too. 

**Scheduling** games, and a **Salary Cap system for Human Players** also need to be discussed, but need more people first!

Draft challenge is still underway!

Its the finals this week with **Team Seanahue** vs. **Team Above Average**   


**Draft Links:**

**Regular OTP Info:**
     
This is a weekly EA_SHL / OTP game done every Wednesday at 8:30 EST. The name of the game is EA's EASHL/OTP pick up games with your own custom made player. These games do count towards your overall performance tracker record so it is a great way to pad your stats in a comfortable, exploit free, and noob friendly environment. We take all skill levels and this is a great way to learn the game. No experience required but we do ask that you pre-make your character ahead of time as we don't wait for you. Games start at 8:35 EST. If you don't make it by that time, we are starting without you and you'll have to wait till the first game is over. Usually 20 minutes or so

* The room disappears when we make a game so don't look for it at 8:40 if you are late. If you can, feel free to make the room yourself and wait there for us! Additionally, shoot a message to WendingoPSU and we'll cue you up when we are making the next round of games.

* We typically do a party chat. XBL has an 8 person limit for party chat which we often hit. If you can't get into the party don't fret, everyone goes to game chat during the game(s) so it isn't a big deal. I type in game chat and will be looking to get a speaking server for next week 2/15.

* We typically get 4-5 games in and usually run till about 10-10:30 at night. You can find the room we play in by going to Xbox Live -&gt; Community -&gt; Lobby: Then cycling downwards till you see a room called 'Reddit'

* Remember... If it is your first night, you have to fight.

* Room name: Reddit Password: **narwhal** (note the lack of e, and lowercase n)

##PSN

**Woooo!**
   
**Here is how you join us this week!**    
    
* Look for the reddit room in the Game Modes lobby (from the NHL12 main menu: Online &gt; Community &gt; Lobby &gt; Game Modes). As always, the password will be **bacon**

Five lucky winners from the Facebook contest will join up with myself and a few other moderators from the forums at the studio in Vancouver and get an early look at NHL 13.

One of the common issues I find with events like these is that when the embargo finally lifts, there are many questions asked to the attendees in regards to areas of the game that weren't touched and/or forgotten by the people playing. 

I would like to compile a list of the more common requests, and take them along with me in order to do my best to be ready for the questions that will be asked in the coming weeks/months.

Remember that I will be under an embargo after the event, and will be unable to address these questions/suggestions until after it is lifted. 

Please be specific in some of the things that you would like an experienced member of this community to test and address in NHL 13.

I'll be tweeting from the event as well - [@KidShowtime](http://www.twitter.com/kidshowtime)",,False,,t5_2ry2z,False,,xbl,True,t3_tbura,http://www.reddit.com/r/EA_NHL/comments/tbura/nhl_13_community_event/,

I make 30 custom teams with their own farm teams (AHL) and make custom players. What I REALLY want to see is more creativity. The fans wearing custom jerseys. Using real Nhl uniforms/jereseys as templates (EX. A San Jose sharks uniform with the colors Maroon, White, Black, and Blue instead of the normal Sharks uniform) and the ability to have an Alternate and/or﻿ Vintage jersey. It would also be cool to name your arena (EX. Telus Center).

For all leagues it would be cool to choose the fan base of teams playing (EX. Kings/home- 78%... Red Wings/away- 22%)(You can change the percents in the settings). Minumum Home percent- 65%, Maximum Home percent- 90%. 

Of course like alot of people I would like to see more refs on the ice. So would I.

What I dont like about be a GM mode is that you can only be one team through 25 years and I would like to see that changed. But if that is something you guys (or EA Sports) likes, then in Season mode you can extend the league to run 25 years thus creating team/league/player records when controlling all teams.

Also in Season mode, after every period or 2 periods (You can decide in the settings), the user can decide a player on the winning team (if tied, the home team) to be interviewed where they will be asked questions and the user can choose one of  three options to answer.

Before each game in every mode it should show the locker room and the players getting ready (like in some of the Madden NFL games).

EA Sports has been successful for making a lot of things in the arena live... except for the fans. It would be nice to see a small majority or fans get out of their seats and leave 1 minute before the game ends if one team has no chance of winning.

For each custom team you should be able to choose an Official Team colour for playoffs when the fans are waving their towels, for the pads on the sides of glass, etc.

If a player decides to not play as either team and just watch from the broadcast camera angle (which I do a lot), it should feel more like your watching T.V. That means a more realistic broadcast angles.

Thank you for reading. I just want to see a more realistic game that will pull more consumers and hockey fans into playing this. You have nothing to lose by adding in more great features. You can only gain from it.

Sincerly, Greydon Ginter

P.S- If anyone knows how to contact EA Sports with these ideas please tell me in the comments.

**It's the first non-segregated Reddit OTP Night (thread)!**

Come join us this week on your respective platforms! Details below!     
      

*****

##XBL

This is a weekly EA_SHL / OTP game done every Wednesday at 8:30 EST. The name of the game is EA's EASHL/OTP pick up games with your own custom made player. These games do count towards your overall performance tracker record so it is a great way to pad your stats in a comfortable, exploit free, and noob friendly environment. We take all skill levels and this is a great way to learn the game. No experience required but we do ask that you pre-make your character ahead of time as we don't wait for you. Games start at 8:35 EST. If you don't make it by that time, we are starting without you and you'll have to wait till the first game is over. Usually 20 minutes or so

* The room disappears when we make a game so don't look for it at 8:40 if you are late. If you can, feel free to make the room yourself and wait there for us! Additionally, shoot a message to WendingoPSU and we'll cue you up when we are making the next round of games.

* We typically do a party chat. XBL has an 8 person limit for party chat which we often hit. If you can't get into the party don't fret, everyone goes to game chat during the game(s) so it isn't a big deal. I type in game chat and will be looking to get a speaking server for next week 2/15.

* We typically get 4-5 games in and usually run till about 10-10:30 at night. You can find the room we play in by going to Xbox Live -&gt; Community -&gt; Lobby: Then cycling downwards till you see a room called 'Reddit'

* Remember... If it is your first night, you have to fight.

* Room name: Reddit Password: Narwhal (note the lack of e!)

**XBL is trying out a new voice chat option using mumble this week.** *eanhl.servebeer.com* **is the address and you can download the mumble client @ http://mumble.sourceforge.net/.**

I've been playing with the same group of guys for 3 years now and we have a blast. We love to be competitive and we have a blast playing. There is nothing more satisfying than talking over a play right before a faceoff and having it execute perfectly and score a goal as a result of the good team work and communication.

The game has inspired me to buy a Black Magic Intensity capture card and set up my own Youtube Channel to teach people how to play better, and has since branched into an all around nhl 12 entertainment channel ( http://www.youtube.com/nhlvet )

Anyways, what I'm leading to is that I would LOVE for NHL 12 to get a little more support on the competitive side. Match making is fun and all, but playing teams that have 20 games played and winning 12-0 can only be fun for so long. I love when we get matched up against another top team and we play a hard, 60 minute battle where the better team defense wins. So satisfying to win those games.

What I'm planning on doing is creating an EASHL tournament for my youtube viewers/redditors/whoever wants in. However though, being a realist, I know things like this never go as planned. Gamebattles/MLG actually DO have a section of a ladder for EASHL (albeit no one uses it since EASHL matchmaking is so darn good). What I planned on doing was having teams/players register their teams/rosters on gamebattles in the case that a dispute arises where a team complains about a no report or a roster issue, there are gamebattles refs to deal with it.

The tournament itself would be done outside of gamebattles though, just using gamebattles to keep it organized.

My goal of this tournament is to just try and raise awareness for the competitive scene of NHL 12 EASHL players.

Would any of you guys be interested in this? Is this a totally far fetched, dumb idea? Let me know guys, thanks!

1) Reduced goof-off time (post whistle) in OTP/clubs to prevent the repeated abuse of the goalies. We weren't able to increase goalie interference penalties during goof-off time without increasing them overall. 

2) Increased the penalty for not selecting a side during a face-off. Some users were rapidly changing sides or not choosing a side and still winning a high frequency of face-offs. Now you will be more likely to lose the face-off if you aren't selecting a side and holding that side until the puck drops.

A quick shout out to **Duefs** who is currently the goal leader with 4 goals and to **radicalapex** who is leading the pack in assists with 5.  Both Duefs and radicalapex are tied for the point leaders in the tournament (so far) with 5 points.  Also, some props go to **Prongs911** who is making his presence known with 22 PIMs in 3 games.

As stated before, this is the first of many inter sub-reddit tournaments and therefore is a bit of a testing ground.  Tourney organizers have discussed a couple things and have put forward the following rule changes effective immediately.

  


**Team rosters will stay flexible throughout the Round Robin**  

-Teams can add and remove players to their roster as they see fit throughout the Round Robin.  Once Round Robin play is complete, the rosters will be set for the elimination and finals.

His generosity went even further as he was willing to deal with my multiple PM's and tweak his creator even more to get the data to come out as a reddit formatted table -- perfect for posting build threads in r/EA_NHL and all related club subreddits.

Pretty fucking sweet, huh? 

I find building my pro to a constant process, and nothing helps out like sharing and critiquing builds with other players. So what's your favorite build? What build are you most proud of? What build could you use some input on to make it work best for you?

I'll start with my current most used build -- my Defensive D-Man. I don't have much to say about it, except for that I keep tweaking the fuck out of it so this is just the current state. Defense has been a bitch for me this year, so I'm down with any and all critiques. I've been stuck at a solid B overall for so long: I just need a little bit more in my stats grade to get my B+ and jump straight to Superstar 3.

**EDIT: Some corrections were made to the layout recently, so you may want to refresh the page and/or clear your cache if it doesn't look right. I'll let Mike know about concerns that the overall might be off.**

**EDIT 2: AngryMike knows all about the overall being off. It's not his fault. More information regarding the Player Creator can be found at the [GITHUB PAGE](https://github.com/AngryMikeGrrrr/NHL-12-Player-Creator)**

*Q: I created a player with your tool but my overall isn't the same as what's reported in the game.* 

*A: This is a known issue. The overall calculation inside of NHL 12 includes some attributes that 
you cannot edit (i.e. Poise). If someone were to give me the hidden attributes and their values, then
I may update the tool to accurately calculate the average.*

The choice is yours!


**Here's how it's going to go down.**


* 3 teams - Herpaderps, Puck Goes First and The Kalashnikovs

* **Round Robin** - Every team will play 6 games in the Round Robin (3 against each opposing team). Your team will get 3 points for a win, 2 points for an OT win, 1 point for an OT loss, and a big fat 0 for a loss.

* After the Round Robin is complete, teams will be seeded based on their points. The team with the highest points in the Round Robin gets the **1st SEED** and a free pass to the finals. The **2nd SEED** and **3rd SEED** will play an Elimination Round to get to the Finals.

* **The Elimination Round** begins with the 2nd SEED and the 3rd SEED playing a best of 3 series to determine who goes to the finals.

* **The Finals** - The winner of the Elimination Round and the 1st SEED play a best of 3 series for the Final to determine which team wins the tournament and therefore has the largest testicles.



We are just finishing the development of a bad ass tournament spreadsheet which will track the progress of the tournament as well as track individual player stats.  Work is still in progress but here is the link if you want to check it out. 

[https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0Ap9E9FtikXsGdEZaZVVGb1g4dTEzQ2Ztb0w3NEttMGc&amp;output=html](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0Ap9E9FtikXsGdEZaZVVGb1g4dTEzQ2Ztb0w3NEttMGc&amp;output=html)


**A couple housekeeping items:**


* The tournament can start immediately.  Teams start by organizing your Round Robin games.

* All Round Robin games will be organized and scheduled by team captains. They do not have to be played in any particular order however all Round Robin games do have to be played within 2 weeks from the beginning of the tournament.

* A minimum of 3 human players (preferably more) must be present on each team to participate in a tournament match.

* All players must be on their team's roster at the beginning of the tournament to participate in any tournament games (no ringers for the finals, etc.)

* It is the responsibility of each team captain to record game scores and stats at the end of every game. A score sheet will be provided to you before the tournament starts.


More details will be provided shortly.

Notice: This is the last Monday game for a while. We'll do a survey to see what day works best for everyone later because we've gotten a few people asking if we could move the date due to Monday Night Football. Stay tuned!

Tonight's Agenda: Grinding games for leveling up. Bring your own suds because I'll be drinking hard.

We MIGHT get a party going just for management organization purposes. However, if you don't get invited, don't fret, we'll post messages in the chat room.

Drop party chat (not the whole party!) for in the game chat once the game starts so you can chat with your teammates.

2-Realistic contracts (front loaded deals to created a desired AAV)

3- FA negation window at the end of the season

4- Player rating fluctuation (as seen somewhat in Madden) a player may be a 89 overall at LW but a 83 overall at RW and 77 overall at C - cant just plug whoever wherever you fit - must build a team of solid players, not just have a line of Sid/Giroux/Stamkos. 

5- line chemistry: some players work well together while others do not eg: 3 playmakers wont work as well as 1 playmaker 1 sniper 1 power-forward

6- Free Agent AI - Fa do not always go for the biggest contract, they look at the team and see where they fit in. Maybe not as much as Player X wants to play in a smaller market while Player Y wants to play in Canada, but the on ice product and 'where do I fit in'. Some players who are getting odler will chase teams that did well the previous season and have a 2/3 line role open while young guys may look to build on a core of an up and coming team, etc.

We will be using current team rosters (no fantasy draft). This makes it more realistic, I believe. 

I would also like to get a subreddit going as kind of a trade negotiation platform (in addition to all the in-game features), a place to coordinate games (because messaging through PSN can be annoying and messaging through EA is basically impossible, at least in my experience), and just a place for general league information. 

I am located in the United States (EST). I'm sure game times could be worked out on an individual basis among competitors? Shouldn't be too difficult to deal with time zone differences.

I think I would like to start the league officially this weekend. Take the first few days to get used to the new game and get the league set up.

Come join us this week on your respective platforms! 

**What is OTP Night you ask?**

Don't be intimidated, it's easy and a great time (like your mother). This is a weekly EA_SHL / OTP game done every Wednesday at 8:30 EST. The name of the game is EA's EASHL/OTP pick up games with your own custom made player. These games do count towards your overall performance tracker record so it is a great way to pad your stats in a comfortable, exploit free, and noob friendly environment. We take all skill levels and this is a great way to learn the game. 

No experience required but we do ask that you pre-make your character ahead of time as we don't wait for you. Games start at 8:30 EST. If you don't make it by that time, we are starting without you and you'll have to wait till the first game is over. Usually 20 minutes or so.

##XBL

**New for This Week**

Nothing!

**Regular OTP Info:**
     
* The room disappears when we make a game so don't look for it at 8:40 if you are late. If you can, feel free to make the room yourself and wait there for us! Additionally, shoot a message to WendingoPSU and we'll cue you up when we are making the next round of games.

* We typically do a party chat. XBL has an 8 person limit for party chat which we often hit. If you can't get into the party don't fret, everyone goes to game chat during the game(s) so it isn't a big deal. I type in game chat and will be looking to get a speaking server for next week 2/15.

* We typically get 4-5 games in and usually run till about 10-10:30 at night. You can find the room we play in by going to Xbox Live -&gt; Community -&gt; Lobby: Then cycling downwards till you see a room called 'Reddit'

* Remember... If it is your first night, you have to fight.

* Room name: Reddit Password: **narwhal** (note the lack of e, and lowercase n)

**New for This Week**

Nothing!
   
**Here is how you join us this week!**    
    
* Look for the reddit room in the Game Modes lobby (from the NHL12 main menu: Online &gt; Community &gt; Lobby &gt; Game Modes). As always, the password will be **bacon**    
* Don't forget to complete the OTP night experience by joining us on Teamspeak 3, as well. The server is hosted on the default port at mikeal.com. If you don't already have the TS3 client, you can download the normal client for free [HERE](http://www.teamspeak.com)    
* There are also mobile TS3 clients available for Android or iPhone. I don't personally own either, so this may be inaccurate, but my understanding is that the Android beta client is currently free but the iPhone client costs $5.
* This is also a great way to join one of the Reddit teams or meet others who want to join/form teams! Make sure to post here if you are new and see what happens!    
    
  
**Basic Info**    

* Get here at 8:25 EST to ensure you get in on the first game(s) and to help make it easier to plan games. First game(s) starts at 8:30 EST so be there!    
* Make sure you are on Teamspeak (details above). We try to split up games so everyone can play, but those with out team speak don't know this! Sometimes people have their PS3 mics hooked up too, but don't count on it! Same happens when we pick captains...    
* Room makers! Make sure we have decided on how many people are ready to play, and how many are in each game if there are more than one, and make the room max out at that number! Sometimes people get impatient (understood) and make a 12 man game, and then 4 people sit in the lobby, when we could have played 2 4v4 games... Keep that in mind!   
* Once a game is started, jump down to one of the OTP rooms on teamspeak so that all the new people coming in are in the lobby and it is easy for them to see and talk to other people waiting. If we play in the lobby, I have a feeling new people sign on, can't get a word in or are timid, and leave.    
* Be patient! If you miss a game, there will be another in 20 minutes or less if there are 2 staggered games going on so come back!

*While OTP night is not highly competitive and more about having fun, players are still expected to play Sim style hockey. Play your position and pass the puck. Above all, be respectful.*

A mix of collector's game with RPG with fantasy hockey with good old fashioned hockey sim. Great! 

And I've even dropped my fair share of cash on the previous few years' versions... maybe $10-15/yr. 

But it has always been a flawed system -- tiers of impossibly good teams from those who pump cash into the game vs. ""the rest,"" players who get new packs via in-game pucks currency. It was always frustrating, and intentionally left imbalanced so that EA collects extra $$$.

And it was fair enough... deal with the frustrations, perhaps put down a few bucks of your own, or else don't play it. 

But this year, the whole concept of HUT is a non-starter (to borrow a buzzword from our beloved CBA talks). And the reason is simple:

If you purchase EA Season Ticket, you get 24 Gold Premium Packs for Hockey Ultimate Team for free.
-

What the fuck - this is huge. The time it takes to earn 24 of the top-tier packs in HUT via pucks is insane -- likely, with average playtime, several months of playing each day.

And the dollar value is over $30 on its own.

This is a slap in the face to anyone who wanted to play ""fair,"" and it's a bold new endeavor of the pay-to-play model EA has been developing.

These guys have won 280 games out of 285 so far this month, with approximately 250 of those via DNF (no joke).

The guys benefit by use of DDoS/synflood attacks if they get you into a party chat before the game. I saw it myself (lost 3-0 on a DNF earlier this week), and heard similar accusations from several opponents. The team may even benefit from a new pause glitch or loop; I messaged a couple of teams that were ahead in games against ""EA x Servers x"" that faced sudden disconnects and/or DNF losses.

It's a hard team to avoid as they have changed logos and abbreviations several times this week. Previously, they used Boston, Philly, and now Toronto. Team abbreviations were ExA, ppp, and now zzz. The roster has gained and lost about 10 players since the beginning of the month so the gamertags you'll potentially face are always changing.

I know, I know.. I sound awful butthurt. There are some great EASHL clubs on this subreddit that enjoy playing NHL 12 with real hockey in mind. It absolutely sucks to get in against a team that is taking exploits and cheating to a new level like these guys.

&gt;*Q: Are you planning to look into the ""stick through legs/puck through* *post"" non-solid object issue that the game has?*

&gt;SR: This is a great question…we’ve tried not allowing sticks to go through legs but the end result was a pretty frustrating gameplay experience where you would continuously keep losing the puck. Our conclusion was that until there was much more fidelity in the stickhandling/deking control, it was a better experience to allow the sticks to penetrate through legs and not lose the puck unless the defensive player did something such as pokecheck.

One of the posts in reply summed up how I feel pretty nicely:

""By 'Frustrating' you mean, realistic, yes? 

You realize that any of us who want an experience that this game is trying to advertise WANT that level of ""frustration"" right? 

Its VASTLY more frustrating to watch a player exploit this lack of collision detection game after game after game than it would be to lose the puck because you put it somewhere stupid. I bolded that because its important. Players should be punished with losing possession if they don't protect the puck properly, rewarding them for the opposite is poor game design.""

From [this producer post](http://www.operationsports.com/features/1306/nhl-12-producer-blog-signature-traits/)

&gt;Player differentiation has been somewhat limited within the NHL series and the team has taken great strides to ensure that we address this for NHL 12.

...

&gt;We knew that we were on the right track when we received positive feedback from community members who had the opportunity to play early versions of NHL 12 at our EA SPORTS Canada studio in May. They noticed how traits affected gameplay and felt that many of the tendencies were spot on.

...

&gt; To put it bluntly, players will position themselves in areas and go to areas on the ice where they tend to go in real life and when a player has the puck, he’ll tend to favor certain moves over others... From a positional standpoint, expect to see players like Joe Thornton set up down low more often; Steven Stamkos, favor the slot and half boards; or Tomas Holmstrom position himself in front of the net. 

They even [made a low quality video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZEsqfqUOlcM&amp;feature=youtu.be) showing off this new, more dynamic AI.

...Wait a minute, that's not Sedin-specific. That's the [overload setup](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHM5dYNOh8o&amp;t=3m18s). ANY player will go to the corner.

As far as I'm concerned, it was all bullshit. Other than differences in stats, I haven't noticed any kind of player differentiation. Sedin, Gomez and Chara will all make the exact same plays. I've yet to see an AI make a play and be surprised by their creativity, and think ""That's classic xxxxx"".

Many franchises carry more salary than the salary cap, the key limitation is that they must be salary cap floor/ceiling compliant on their main roster *by the start of the regular season.* Look at the Rangers with Redden in the minors earning 6 million but not hurting their cap space whatsoever. 

So, unless I'm mistaken, teams in the real NHL can make offers to players (one way or otherwise) that would put their total salary above the cap ceiling during the off season, for stuff like sign/trades or burying players in the minors, as long as they are cap compliant by season start.

Theme of the week: All-Star Draft Challenge: Week 1: The Tryout

Because PSN are doing an All-Star weekend, we're gonna do something similar spread out over 3 weeks. 

The first week is the tryout week. Show up tonight, play your heart out, and take notes of player's names and their skill. 

Over the next 24 hours, I'll assign 2 captains and have the captains an draft all-star teams like the NHL does it. Next week, we'll play a best 3 of 5 series with those locked teams. I'll look into getting something for the winning team if everything works out.

So if you are interested I ask that you do two things. Post your XBL name, favorite position, second favorite position and progression level. It should look like this:

WendingoPSU - SuperStar 3 - C, LW

**Next, I ask that you CHANGE YOUR PLAYER'S NAME to that of your xbl user name for just tonight. It makes knowing who is who so much easier. If you have time, please test this out because EA likes to censor player names very liberally** 

If you are interested in being a captain. Please let me know ASAP. 

This is a 2 weeks commitment. If we get more then 12 signed up, we'll have have a rotation required between games for the 3/5 series. 


Oh! Almost forgot. Week 3! We'll do a skill challenge similar to how the PS3 folks are doing it. Details to come soon.

As for this week's games, here's the standard rules:


&gt;This is a weekly EA_SHL / OTP game done every Wednesday at 8:30 EST. The name of the game is EA's EASHL/OTP pick up games with your own custom made player. These games do count towards your overall performance tracker record so it is a great way to pad your stats in a comfortable, exploit free, and noob friendly environment. We take all skill levels and this is a great way to learn the game. No experience required but we do ask that you pre-make your character ahead of time as we don't wait for you.

* Games start at 8:35 EST. If you don't make it by that time, we are starting without you and you'll have to wait till the first game is over. Usually 20 minutes or so 

* The room disappears when we make a game so don't look for it at 8:40 if you are late. If you can, feel free to make the room yourself and wait there for us! Additionally, shoot a message to WendingoPSU and we'll cue you up when we are making the next round of games.

* We typically do a party chat. XBL has an 8 person limit for party chat which we often hit. If you can't get into the party don't fret, everyone goes to game chat during the game(s) so it isn't a big deal. (I'll investigate for TS next week since we're starting to get big)

* And Remember... If it is your first night, you have to fight.

We typically get 4-5 games in and usually run till about 10-10:30 at night. You can find the room we play in by going to Xbox Live -&gt; Community -&gt; Lobby: Then cycling downwards till you see a room called 'Reddit'

**#2: Guy Who Skates Directly Into Largest Concentration of Opposing Players**

*What He Does:*

No less annoying is Guy Who Skates Directly Into Largest Concentration of Opposing Players.  The breakout is actually looking good for once through the neutral zone, but whichever forward is about to cross into the offensive zone makes a beeline for the net and the nearest opposing players, because offensive ice is LAVA and spending more than three seconds in it will KILL YOU.  What happens?  Well, in the neutral zone, GWSDILCOP will try to get into the zone right at the boards, despite between one and three defending players all lining up a devastating hit, and get laid out by the defender EVERY SINGLE TIME.  This of course turns the puck over AND keeps GWSDILCOP out of the play for three or four seconds, which is plenty of time for the other team to set something up.

*Why It's Bad:*

If, by some chance, GWSDILCOP does manage to get into the zone (you can expect this about 1/8th of the time or so), he will immediately skate directly towards the net, where one thing will happen: He will try to toe drag around the defender, and get stick lifted or laid out, thus turning over the puck once again.  Ten repetitions of this dance will not get GWSDILCOP to EVER try to do anything else, like ring it around the boards or flip dump it in and chase it.  It's turnover after turnover after turnover, with the puck constantly coming back the other way.

*How He Can Be Less Annoying:*

When you're about to get smashed into the boards, flip the puck in, or, my favorite, ring it around the boards.  The flip dump is RB+wrist shot, and the ring around the boards is RB+slap shot.  I'm convinced some of you didn't actually know those controls, but now you do.  Look--assume you're going to get destroyed trying to carry the puck into the zone, and instead of padding your turnover numbers, get the stupid puck in the zone and hope that one of us can snag it by the time you pick yourself up off the ice.  Oh, and stop skating directly at the largest concentration of opposing players.  Please.

It's already pretty comprehensive, but I'm looking for some other ideas on what other kinds of stats I can track/calculate using just what's available from the club page on easports.com (I'm too lazy to go into the game and look at everyone's performance tracker individually).

1318509358.0,9,self.EA_NHL,lar48,"Has EA fixed any real line change ""bugs"" from NHL 11/NHL 10",11,2,15,http://www.reddit.com/r/EA_NHL/comments/lar48/has_ea_fixed_any_real_line_change_bugs_from_nhl/,"I'm curious if you guys have noticed if they fixed any bugs that were in NHL 11, and even some from NHL 10. I feel as though they made several changes that make the game very very frustrating...and i'm not even talking gameplay changes.

The first is when you try to change your line after a pk/pp. If you change the forward/defense line then the entire line changes.Often if the other team is coming down on a slow rush i'll get a quick change in for my forwards and let me D take the 2-on-2 rush by themselves only to find that both of my defenseman are headed to the bench. This has been a problem since NHL 10.

The next is similar, after a penalty kill if the player coming out of the box is a defenseman he'll be playing a wing in place of the empty spot. But after you change lines...he remains on the wing, or his substitute remains on the wing, or he simply won't change. This forces you to cover the puck or attempt to get a whistle in order to get your dying player off the ice because he's unable to change for the last 10 minutes.

Next is the time it takes to bring up the line change overlay to manually change your line. For whatever reason they made it extremely slow in NHL 11 and even slower now in NHL 12. It does look nicer but when I want to make a change, i want to make a change, I don't care if it looks awesome when it comes up. I just want to change my line ASAP.

On the manul line change note, over half the time i manually change my line during a stoppage of play the overlay still remains visible. This also happens for strategies (breakout aggressiveness, forecheck, etc).The only cure i've found is to hit the line change button again and wait for it to go but usually by the time you realize that the overlay is stuck there the faceoff has already commenced, then you have to hit the line change button and wait 15 seconds for it to go away...so frustrating.

Still on the line change overlays and most appearant after a goal is the complete inhability to change your line. Most common with the defense lines after you push the button to bring up the overlay...nothing happens, or if it does the overlay is only up for a short period of time

And new to NHL 12 they decided it was a bad idea to take out the ability to adjust strategies during the introduction of the teams. Even just to tweak a teams forecheck to your liking you have to wait for the opening faceoff, taking time away from setting up your initial faceoff for the start of the game. I often have to concede the first faceoff because the strategy overlays take so long to pop up.

These are all extremly frustrating glitches that really take away from the experience. Changing lines and adjusting strategies should be simple button presses and shouldn't be so tedious. It's almost like they're punishing people that prefer to select their own line or play from a different strategy than the default.

tl;dr line change overlays are broken since NHL 10",,False,,t5_2ry2z,False,,,True,t3_lar48,http://www.reddit.com/r/EA_NHL/comments/lar48/has_ea_fixed_any_real_line_change_bugs_from_nhl/,

1317497257.0,10,self.EA_NHL,kxp8h,Connection advantage and you (or why this game seems to sometimes hate you).,12,2,9,http://www.reddit.com/r/EA_NHL/comments/kxp8h/connection_advantage_and_you_or_why_this_game/,"Decided to post a bit of a clarification when it comes to the connection advantage one player will have when playing online. I've been gaming online since I was 8 years old (I'm 23 now) and have been somewhat of a gaming geek since then. One **truth** I've learned over these years is about the *host advantage*.

Basically, NHL 12 and most other online console games use a P2P connection (also known as client-side hosting). In the simplest terms this means that when you play a versus game (or any other game mode) one player is assigned to be the connection host. All the information and actions in the game are registered on that player's console. If you are not the host, every action you make is sent via the internet to the host's console; it applies those actions to the game and then sends back the reactions. Your console is sending millions of data packets to the host's console every second, and the host's console is sending data packets back to you as well.

The transfer of data from one console to another is what creates ""lag"". All actions need to be sent to the host's console to be applied to the current game. This means that the host has no lag; all the actions he makes are immediately registered on his console. His actions receive an immediate and accurate response while others are dependent on the internet connection to send and receive data.

The game picks a user to host without showing who it picked; which is why many people are completely unaware of a host advantage. It most likely picks the user with the most suitable connection to host; however this I am not certain of. The biggest three factors influencing host advantage are the speed of both users' connections, the reliability (making sure no data is lost) of both connections, and the distance between the two (or more) players.

The player with the host connection will always have the advantage; the size of that advantage depends on the three factors mentioned above. Sometimes a match-up can be pretty even given both players have great connections and live close to each other. Other times, one player will be severely crippled in how the game plays out.

Some symptoms of host advantage (assuming you're not the host):

- Your team cannot hold onto the puck; you lose the puck when simply skating near an opponent

- You cannot separate an opponent from the puck (poking, stick-lifting, hitting, etc); anytime a puck is separated it goes right back to the opponent

- Your players feel sluggish and unresponsive

- The opponent skates through your defense without any trouble

- The game basically feels like it took a bribe from your opponent

The game that you see and play on your screen is a split-second behind what is actually going on. If you try and line up a check, you are probably lining up where your opponent was just under a second ago. The host, however, sees and plays the game in real-time. The more the advantage for the host, the further behind the opponent.

On the flip-side, you are most likely the host if you see your opponent suffering from these symptoms, but you seem to be dominating.

Here's a video showing what I'm talking about. I know, it's Call of Duty; however it uses the same connection (P2P) and shows the same type of lag experienced in NHL 12 (and any other P2P game).

Forgot to mention that when you connect to EA servers, you are simply connecting to their database. The EA servers store all your statistics/records. After every game you'll notice it will upload the information to the EA servers; this allows your statistics to be online and visible 24/7 as long as the servers are running smoothly.

I messaged shane_solo yesterday, inquiring about starting up an official PSN online versus league. After dropping Shane a line, I took the preliminary measure of starting the league (named the ""**Reddit Hockey League [RHL]**"" ... yeah, I'm a beacon of creativity).

If you are interested in joining, there are still 30 spots left (Sabres, Capitals have all ready been nabbed by myself and shane_solo, respectively).

I will attempt to find a night during the week when we can consistently meet up (seeing as Tuesday at 8:30 EST rarely works for me). At the moment, I'm considering Wednesday @ 8:30 to correspond with the schedule all ready presented for OTP nights, but maybe we can make it more flexible. I'm not totally sure, I haven't done this before, so bear with me.

finished off the third season of a Winnipeg Jets franchise we've been playing on and off for the last few months. Hadn't won a cup yet, kind of frustrated with the roster. Half-way through year three, annoyed at the marginal goaltending and impressed by some talent we've scouted on other rosters, we blow up the roster (more or less). We go crazy young and get players with potential, some usable stats at the pro-level, etc. Pick up four prospects with the intention to turn them into our new core players: a center, a winger, a d-man and a goalie. We trade for Erik Karlsson/Gabriel Landeskog. Having signed Henrik Sedin in the off season, we have a decent roster, with our four new prospects playing in first and second line roles they aren't quite ready for yet. We pretty much spend all our draft picks and valuable young players trying to do this. Managed to do this all while keeping Evander Kane, with the rest of the roster being niche players or fourth line garbage that never sees the ice anyway.

We go on to win the cup (finally), send some guys back to the minors and manage to get a Calder cup win (four guys on the roster win both championships in the same year). Then we get through to the off season. Now, back to those four core young players we traded for... let's see how they've grown.

The center was an 84 overall 20 year old with 4.5 star potential. Good, solid player. After the off-season he's an 89 overall center. Great pickup.

The winger was... a 79 overall 20 year old with 4 star potential, and the oddest stat mix I've seen in NHL 13. Low-to-mid 90's in his shot categories, low 70's in his skating, and he's a big power forward. After the off-season, he's still a 79 overall, but his shot is now mid-to-high 90's across the board.

The d-man... oh the d-man. OFD, goes from 80-ish to 88, shot statistics are 99 across the board. He's got 99's in several of his defensive stats (shot block, poke check), 90's in passing and puck control, good stats elsewhere. High 80's skating. He's now a better Erik Karlsson.

And finally, the goalie. He was an 80 overall 5 star green potential 24 year old, and was unquestionably the most expensive and difficult trade to pull off. We over-paid so hard. In a single off-season, he went from an 80 rated goalie with some less than stellar reflexive stats (his 80's rating was almost entirely from his high athletics) to a 95 rated goalie. And we still have him under contract for a year at 0.850 mil on a two way. 15 full overall points. Most of his stats went from high 70's and low 80's to the low-to-mid 90's. He's, unquestionably, the best goalie in the league.

If any players from the free agency pool would like to form their own team, now is the time to do so.  

Format for this tournament will start with 2 Divisions of randomly selected teams.  Team will play 1 game vs each team in their division to determine rank. Top 4 teams from each division move on to playoffs,  while teams who failed to reach top 4 will play in relegation games.

  **Looking for input** - should Playoffs be single elimination? Or Beat of 3?

**Playoff format will be as such:**
1st Div A vs 4th Div B
1st Div B vs 4th Div A
2nd Div A vs 3rd Div B
2nd Div B vs 3rd Div A

**OR**

If we get + 12 teams,  we may use a different playoff format, where top 2 teams in each division get a bye to second round,  while the bottom 4 in each division play crossover games:
3rd Div A vs 6th Div B
4th Div A vs 5th Div B
3rd Div B vs 6th Div A
4th Div B vs 5th Div A


Winners move on, while losers play relegation games, and so on and so forth.

I'm not sure if its wise to set a schedule for games to be played, so it's up to each team to contact your opponents and schedule a time to play your games. That said,  there will be a date set to have these games completed by.
As Rob C mentioned, any teams who are inactive will forfeit any games not played.
A thread or perhaps even a subreddit will be created for posting game results.

 
Anyone else have any ideas or something to add?

In response to the NHL Lockout, a group of us are starting a simulation GM Connected League that will make use of the current NHL rosters. The only requirement for joining the league is that the GM must be a redditor, as we will be communicating league news via reddit.

1. The schedule will move ahead by 2 weeks every odd numbered day, completing an NHL season and the subsequent run for the Stanley Cup in just over a month's time.

2. All GMs have the option of playing their games outright (OTP or VS style) if both GMs agree to complete the matchup between sim days. The max # of user players is set at 3 to make it fair for those who don't have the ability to formulate a whole team and for those who will play against those teams VS style. We may or may not increase this number depending on the consensus of the league.

3. Negotiations are still being made regarding playoffs, but most current GMs would like them to be played outright as a Best of 3. If this becomes the rule, OTP GMs may fill ranks with non-playoff GMs if they don't have enough user players to formulate a team.

4. Since we don't know how active/inactive a current roster sim league will make us, the league will come to a decision at the end of the first season to either continue with the league as is or disband and reform as a ""random rosters"" league. Most of us are wanting this to be a side-game to our regular HUT or EASHL play though, so we're interesting in seeing what an alternate NHL will look like after, say, 6 seasons.

5. After completing the second season of this league, the GM's will vote in a new Commissioner and will do so every 2 season after that. 

*IF YOU ARE INTERESTED IN TAKING ON A TEAM IN THE Alt-HL, APPLY WITHIN THE COMMENTS.* 

*I will need you to include your PSN ID if you don't have it in your flair.*

I'm mainly going to talk about Team Finland because I'm most familiar with their roster but I'm sure the situation is no different for other teams. I know Finland is not a huge country but the team has won a medal 4 out of last 5 olympics and the World Championship in 2011 and it's ranked 2nd in the world by [IIHF](http://www.iihf.com/home-of-hockey/championships/world-ranking/mens-world-ranking/2012-ranking.html) for it's steady performance so I'd consider it a pretty relevant team in international hockey. Not to mention a big market for the NHL game.

The team hasn't changed at all in years. There has been **one change** to the roster since NHL **09**. Jere Lehtinen retired in 2010 and was removed in a roster update of NHL 11.

Mikael Granlund is probably the most noticable player missing. He scored 9 points in WC 2011 including the [iconic goal](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JazGHYDwp-s) against Russia in the semi-finals and was a huge factor in winning the championship. He also participated in WC 2012 and even most of the less important national team tournaments during the season. Yet he's still missing from the team, even with the newest online roster update.

Do you think EA should pay better attention to their National team rosters? After all they're probably the most used teams after NHL.",,False,,t5_2ry2z,False,,,True,t3_10gj1f,http://www.reddit.com/r/EA_NHL/comments/10gj1f/nhl_13_and_lacking_national_rosters/,

Please inform me if this oversteps anyone's boundaries and I'll delete the post and let you reap the credit for posting it.

**It's OTP Night for XBox Live!**

What is OTP Night you ask?

Don't be intimidated, it's easy and a great time for all. This is a weekly EASHL / OTP game done every Wednesday at 8:30 EST. These games do count towards your overall performance tracker record so it is a great way to pad your stats in a comfortable, exploit free, and noob friendly environment. We take all skill levels and this is a great way to learn the game.

No experience required but we do ask that you pre-make your characters ahead of time as we don't wait for you. Games start at 8:30 EST. (This may change in the future) If you don't make it to the room by that time, we are starting without you and you'll have to wait till the first game is over. Usually 20 minutes or so.

Regular OTP Info:
    The room will disappear when we make a game so you might not find it if you are late.  If you are early, feel free to make the room yourself and wait there for us! Additionally, shoot a message to **jumpyg1258** and we'll cue you up when we are making the next round of games.

    We typically do a party chat while waiting to start games. XBL has an 8 person limit for party chat which we often hit. If you can't get into the party don't fret, everyone goes to game chat during the game(s) so it isn't a big deal. 

    We typically get 2-3 games in and usually run till about 10:30 EST at night. 

    You can find the room we play in by going to Xbox Live -&gt; Community -&gt; Lobby: Then cycling downwards till you see a room called 'Reddit'

Room name: *Reddit*

Password: **nhl**

~~HEY EVERYONE, the EA servers are down for ""emergency maintenance"".  I do not know when they will be back up, but as soon as they are, I'm sure a room will be created.  Just check back every now and then to see if you can log in, I guess.~~

This grinder build is really good for being able to play a two-way game. It requires a lot of the boosts unlocked, but seems to be very effective.  You can't really snipe wicked wristers on the rush, but the offensive awareness + strength help make the shot more accurate and powerful than the 73/73 attributes may lead you to believe.  The puck control sucks, but the high agility helps you bob and weave to dodge people pokechecking you.
