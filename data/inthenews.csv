**Ricin Letter man [arrested and unrelated to Boston Bombing](http://www.cbc.ca/news/world/story/2013/04/17/obama-letter-suspicious-subtance.html) so there is no need to talk about it!!** 

**Also aware of the explosion in Texas, although there is nothing that even remotely connects the two incidents so please stop including that in the thread.**

Not news, but [really touching video from the Boston Bruins game tonight](http://video.bruins.nhl.com/videocenter/console?catid=0&amp;id=240032&amp;cmpid=embed-share-video). I'm a hockey fan so I'm going to add it here for those interested. If I get enough flack for it from ya'll I'll take it down! 

**Update 277** (**22:06 EDT**) So with regards to Hannity(on  fox) and now CNN as well, photos of 2 persons of interest being circulated by FBI. CNN is saying that for the integrity of the case they are not showing the pictures. Fox (local affiliate) is showing a picture of the Blue shirt man with his Black sweatered friend with the white hat.

The FBI and BPD will be holding a press conference at **9:30 AM ET** to discuss their investigation. **[A live stream of this event can be viewed at the links here.](http://www.wwhdtv.com/category/country/usa/)**

**Update 171 (8:47 AM ET)** [Russian President Vladimir Putin has expressed his condolences and offered his nation's full support in the wake of this terrible tragedy.](http://eng.kremlin.ru/news/5277)

**Update 172 (8:50 AM ET)** User /u/uberalice has offered [4,000 miles with American Airlines](http://www.reddit.com/r/inthenews/comments/1cggwa/boston_marathon_explosions_live_update_thread_6/c9g8sfg) if anyone is in need. In addition, users of /r/Boston have offered significant amounts of airline miles and hotel points to anybody in need.

**Update 176 (10:00 AM ET)** Since this is an ongoing investigation, official comments on the components of this case are not expected to be forthcoming. I will continue to update as the day goes on, but I would not expect the volume of updates we experienced yesterday.

**Update 177 (10:05 AM ET)** 176 injured is the best estimate of casualties stemming from the blasts, according to investigators. 

**Update 178 (10: AM ET)** The press conference has concluded.

**Update 180 (10:45 AM ET)** Dr. Don Walls, Brigham Chair of Emergency Medicine, has described removing projectiles from several patients. Round, manufactured shrapnel, of similar constitution to a BB, was removed from several patients. Nails (described as carpenter nails) were embedded in several other bodies. 

**Reminder** [Police are insisting that all photos, videos, and information that may help establish a timeline for this attack should be shared with investigators.](https://twitter.com/Boston_Police)

&gt;As a little background as to why any information/photos/videos could be helpful:
I'm not sure if they touched on this, but even if you have only one photo from somewhere in Copley over the course of the day, it could be useful. Those photos and videos can be used in conjunction with store/ATM cameras and traffic cameras as well as additional eye-witness testimony and photographic evidence to create a map of who was at the scene, and where they went. With the amount of coverage the marathon got, it is very likely that the person who placed the device is on camera several times. As an investigator looking at this situation you could perhaps follow somebody by seeing them first on a traffic camera looking suspicious. You could then follow them through several different peoples photos and see where they went and over what time span they went there. You could gather enough evidence to justify putting out BOLOs for specific people needed for questioning.

&gt;If you have ANYTHING; a photo of yourself eating breakfast in Copley, an instagrammed photo of Copley prior to the race beginning, a panorama of the finish line, a picture of your friend or family member as they finish the race... all of it is useful or potentially useful.

**Update 187 (12:00 PM ET)** I just received this notification from a member of the Boston medical community:

&gt;A Message from the DFCI/BWH Blood Donor Center:

&gt;The tragic events at the Boston Marathon have led to an overwhelming outpouring of support to the Blood Donor Center. If you’re considering donating blood or platelets, the center requests that you call to schedule a blood or platelet donation and consider scheduling your donation in the coming weeks to help us replenish and maintain the supply of blood products to meet the needs of patients at both Brigham and Women’s Hospital and Dana-Farber Cancer Institute. To schedule a donation, email **blooddonor@partners.org** with your preferred donation type (blood or platelets), days you prefer to donate and a phone number.

This is unverifiable information due to the anonymity of the source, but the accuracy of the AP so far leads me to believe they do in fact have a credible inside source. 

**Update 189 (1:00 PM ET)** Foreign Affairs Canada has reported that no Canadian Citizens were injured in the explosions. Thanks to /u/crazyexgirlfriend for this information.

Hey everyone! After requests to create a live update thread, I will keep this post up to date.

After the Boston Bombings and similar, I ask you to keep speculation to a minimum as to avoid forcing this thread into a read-only page, should things increase.


**Updates**

* **[12:23 pm GMT] Hareetz has quoted the Lebanese Foreign Minister in saying ""Resistance forces will respond to the Israeli aggression… Iran will not allow to Israel destabilize the region."" Whilst residents of the Northern city of Kiryat have been calling in asking about shelters and whether or not classes are still on. It is clear they are concerned but officials are telling the public to trust in their defense force.**

* **[11:39 am GMT] Hareetz is reporting that the the Israeli Fighter Jets fired on the Syrian targets from the airspace above Lebanon, avoiding entering Syrian Airspace.**

* **[11:06 am GMT] Syria's Deputy Foreign Minister Faisal al Mekdad said on CNN that the attack on the Syrian military facility near Damascus is a 'declaration of war' by Israel. In an interview with CNN correspondent Frederik Pleitgen in Damascus, al Mekdad, an official considered close to President Assad, said the attack is evidence to an alliance between Islamic terrorists and Israel. He added that Syria would choose the time and way of retaliation. Note the similarities that this has with the North Korean sabre rattling - Just an observation.**

* **[9:32 am GMT] The Prime Minister, Benjamin Netanyahu is still scheduled for his visit to China. This is good news.**

* **[9:10 am GMT] Reuters is also reporting Iran condemning the attack (expected) and calling for the region to stand against the action. [Source] (http://www.reuters.com/article/2013/05/05/us-syria-crisis-iran-idUSBRE94402820130505)**

* **[9:06 am GMT] Reuters is reporting a senior Israeli official on Syria's Chemical Stock pile as ""Not wanted"" by the Hezbollah rebels. This is very good news for the region, instead Hezbollah is after conventional weapon systems. [Source] (http://www.reuters.com/article/2013/05/04/us-syria-crisis-chemical-israel-idUSBRE94309720130504)**

* [8:59 am GMT] An expansion on the previous update, an IDF official has been quoted as saying ""Iron Dome batteries are deployed from time to time in different locations across the country according to security assessments. The system is currently being deployed in the northern region.""

* [8:48 am GMT] Haaretz is reporting the deployment of two Iron Dome Battery systems (Anti missile systems) near the cities of Haifa and Safed, to address tension along the country's northern border.

* [8:40 am GMT] CNN is saying there are reports of Iraqi Shiites fighting in Syria with Iranian Revolutionary Guards providing intellectual and advisory report. Israels Defense Force has still yet to comment.

* [8:29 am GMT] Israel's Prime Minister, Benjamin Netanyahu has not commented on the matter at the opening of the cabinet meeting.

* [8:24 am GMT] According to [Haaretz] (http://www.haaretz.com/news/diplomacy-defense/live-blog-israel-launches-second-syria-strike-in-three-days-sources-say-1.519250), Israeli forces attacked a weapons and ammunition storehouses and air defense centers, the research facility remains unharmed. They are also quoting Lebanon television as reporting Syrian Air Defense succeeded in hitting an enemy aircraft. This information is from a Hezbollah (Israel's opponents/rebels) and thus is likely to be biased.

* [7:21 am GMT] After talking with /u/NewsCrowd, it is clear there is a slow down in information currently.

* [6:52 am GMT] Reuters is quoting a source in saying the targets are Fateh-110 missiles in transit from Iran to Hezbollah. [Here] (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fateh-110) is the wiki page on the missile.

* [5:47 am GMT] A few of you are questioning the Iranian presence in the Golans. This is not confirmed and instead is simply there to answer people's questions as the rumors spread. There is no evidence as to Iranian presence in the region and thus cannot be verified or confirmed. Apologies over any mis-communication. It seems only rumor websites in the region are being updated, one source has mentioned the possibility of a media black out. I will keep this updated.

* [5:20 am GMT] Talking with some of my sources, the Israelis contacted are feeling calm about this and are ready to roll, but believe this to blow over quickly as of current. Still no comment from Assad. The previous rumor about an armed convoy has not provided any evidence.

* [5:04 am GMT] Reports that Iranian Military [5:35 am GMT] is possibly (Israeli Radio) on the Syrian side of the Golan Mountain Range - This is unconfirmed and speculative. I am mentioning this to keep track of all information.

* [4:14 am GMT] Thank you to those offering help, this is greatly appreciated. Also check out this [Reddit-Stream] (http://reddit-stream.com/comments/1dpog2/) to stay up to date.

* [4:06 am GMT] BBC World News is talking to a journalist who has said this could be the biggest attack on the Syrian Military in years.

* [4:04 am GMT] Thanks to /u/edwardunknown for more video angles. [One angle] (http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4r0peaesxu4) and [another] (http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Se5s6C0P38).

* [4:02 am GMT] BBC World News has reported the strike location is also a prime artillery position that a lot of strikes come out of.

* [3:37 am GMT] Assad has yet to officially declare war as [The Commentator] (http://www.thecommentator.com/article/3447/assad_to_declare_war_on_israel_following_fresh_airstrikes) has been reporting.

* [3:21 am GMT] I would like to take the time to address a few rumors. No reports on this 'nuke' that is trending on twitter, the blast would have been larger and the coverage worldwide. There are twitter reports that Syria is sending forces to the Israel/Syria Border - This cannot be confirmed at all. Assad has yet to comment on this, no sites are quoting him on this attack. I would also like to ask people to check the articles they are linking in the news subreddits, quite a few are from the Friday Strike.

* [3:12 am GMT] RT is citing a local journalist reporting 300 people dead and a total of 4 blasts striking the area.

* [3:04 am GMT] The BBC is currently playing a phone interview to a local journalist(?) of people experiencing a minor earthquake before the blast. In his words this could indicate an underground structure being attacked. This is not confirmed - Just the latest on BBC news.

* [3:02 am GMT] Reports coming in of multiple casualties as expected.

* [3:01 am GMT] The BBC is reporting multiple attacks on local military bases, stating locals as sources.

* [2:59 am GMT] [Here] (http://i.imgur.com/k1VROAP.jpg) is a resource on where the strikes have occurred provided by /u/crybabypeepants.

* [2:54 am GMT] It was pointed out to me the ABC link I have linked to is on the Friday Attack - The information about the missile strike is only valid about the Friday strike. Today's strike is against the military research center. Apologies over any confusion. Thank you Lt-Derp.

**The Story so far** [2:47 am GMT]

* An Israeli Air Strike has hit a Missile shipment headed towards Hezbollah.

* The strike itself occurred near a Ammunition depot and Military Research Center.

* The missiles are being reported to be 'game changing' and include ground to ground missiles. **This is from an ABC article that I was linked to addressing the Friday Strike. Today's target is the Military Research Center. No reports of other targets. Apologies over confusion caused.**

* The White House is transferring all questions to the Israeli Embassy.

* A lot of speculation on possible war between the two countries - No official word as of yet.

* Assad has yet to address this attack.

Let's Find Their Son.,1211,178,165,http://www.reddit.com/r/inthenews/comments/1co5o1/we_owe_sunil_tripathis_family_an_outpouring_of/,"Sunil Tripathi has been accused of being Suspect 2 in the Boston Marathon bombings for hours on reddit and all over Twitter.


His name has been trending for the past 4 hours. 

Many posts and tweets have been calling for his death or pain on his family.


We did this.


Maybe we didn't mean to, or even want to, but we did. 


The downside of instant journalism is that we sometimes get things wrong. And sometimes media outlets can take this false information and run with it.



Hours before the media blitz and craziness of this night posts in /r/FindBostonBombers called Sunil out by name, speculating that he was involved. Even if the circumstances were too coincidental to ignore, what's the benefit of posting his name and picture to an online community instead of discretely calling the FBI?



When did imaginary internet points become more important than helping an investigation, or not jumping to conclusions and causing a witch hunt?



The point is, this family has suffered far too much. Well before we as a community stuck our ugly neck beards in their business.



Reddit, we owe them.

Twitter Page: [Finding Sunny](https://twitter.com/findingsunny) #FindSunny




**EDIT:** The supposed originator of the Suspect 2/Sunil comparison photo has apologized on Twitter. Hopefully more media outlets will follow suit.



**EDIT 2:** [Sunil's family posted this on Facebook a few minutes ago](https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=417287098368653&amp;amp;amp;l=55bda423e6)

&gt;A tremendous and painful amount of attention has been cast on our beloved Sunil Tripathi in the past twelve hours.

&gt;We have known unequivocally all along that neither individual suspected as responsible for the Boston Marathon bombings was Sunil.

&gt;We are grateful to all of you who have followed us on Facebook, Twitter, and Reddit—supporting us over the recent hours.

&gt;Now more than ever our greatest strength comes from your enduring support. We thank all of you who have reached out to our family and ask that you continue to raise awareness and to help us find our gentle, loving, and thoughtful Sunil.


**EDIT 3:** Buzzfeed and various contributors who initially posted on Twitter false confirmations that Sunil was Suspect 2 has scrubbed their twitter pages and refuse to apologize for inadvertently hurting an innocent family. @BuzzFeedAndrew ",,False,,t5_2rgzp,1366417734.0,,,True,t3_1co5o1,http://www.reddit.com/r/inthenews/comments/1co5o1/we_owe_sunil_tripathis_family_an_outpouring_of/,

""Boston Marathon bombing suspect Tamerlan Tsarnaev flew in and out of John F. Kennedy Airport last year and was out of the country for six months, and investigators said they want to know if he received any terror training while he was overseas, NBC 4 New York has learned.

Travel records obtained by NBC 4 New York show Tsarnaev left New York on Jan. 12, 2012 for Sheremetyevo, Russia. He stayed overseas and returned to JFK on July 17.

The travel documents show a photo of a bearded Tsarnaev. The documents show the terror suspect was born on Oct. 21, 1986 and first entered the U.S. through JFK on July 19, 2003.

The documents show it was not until Friday that U.S. officials determined he was “a person or instrument that may pose a threat to the security of the United States.”

Tsarnaev was killed amid the shootout with police early Friday. The manhunt was continuing for his brother, Dzhokhar Tsarnaev.

Dzhokhar Tsarnaev was born on July 22, 1993, the records show. They also said he flew to the U.S. on April 12, 2002 with his family, which applied for asylum. The family was granted legal permanent residence on March 2, 2007.
The documents show there is no record of Dzhokhar Tsarnaev leaving the United States.""

***

* [7:00 pm GMT+1] Reports coming in that the crowd have medical students mixed in who happen to be prepared for the gas. They have gas masks and home made remedies to counter act the spray. This has seemingly slowed the police down. Reports that the Taksim military hospital is handing out gas masks to the protesters. It's 6:00 am here, so I'll be heading to bed in a few. G'Night all!

***

* [6:40 pm GMT+1] [This] (http://www.ustream.tv/channel/emekdunyasitv) live thread is showing a woman with a bad head injury, they're trying to get her to the hospital/ambulance but she has been put in a car to get her on the move.

***

* [6:35 pm GMT+1] The large crowd in Istanbul has been separated into three groups with the police planning charges to drive the protesters back.

***

***

* [5:48 pm GMT+1] [Here] (http://imgur.com/a/m6HZU#26EyCE1) is an album from someone in the crowd currently. He is reporting live in the [IRC chat] (https://kiwiirc.com/client/irc.snoonet.org/news?settings=dd892af474749b032ba39bb88a8894d9) - If you do join, please keep the channel free when required as to allow me to gather updates quickly.

***

* [5:43 pm GMT+1] Another source on the ground has suggested major football clubs who normally hold a bitter rivalry have moved in together to force the police back and support those who are exposed and defenseless. There is a large column of people in Istanbul which the police are aiming to divide and gas. 

***

* [5:35 pm GMT+1] Talking to someone on the ground in Istanbul - He has unconfirmed reports that the Government has shut down the only agency reporting on the rioting whilst warning the other agencies not to report or the same will happen to them. Protesters are using black paint against the gas masks of police as to force them to take them off and be exposed to the spray.

Thanks to /u/douglasmacarthur and /u/odinsbrotherinlaw

***

* [5:13 pm GMT+1] [A collage of riot images] (https://twitter.com/hsyinblt/status/340496036390912000/photo/1) show the extent of which the police are going to as to remove the unrest from the streets. BBC UK is reporting people hospitalized due to respiratory illnesses caused by the tear gas and pepper spray. 

***

* [5:10 pm GMT+1] The large amount of cameras and journalists suggest a large media presence, yet the lack of coverage suggests otherwise. Another good point raised by a resident - The park is where people gather after earthquakes, if it was removed, we would only have the street where we can be hurt. A very good point in terms of public safety.

***

* [5:07 pm GMT+1] Reports of traffic cameras being shutdown in the protest areas - Some businesses and homes are opening up their wifi to protesters as to allow communication and export of footage/images of the situation. Finally there are tweets from people saying they are trapped by police and cannot move without having tear gas fired upon them - [Here is a tweet in question] (https://twitter.com/girlaboutalot/status/340499392127696898/photo/1)

***

***

* [4:55 pm GMT+1] Reports coming in of large crowds in Izmir - [This photo] (https://twitter.com/izmirajanda/status/340494052527058945/photo/1) shows a crowd forming outside of the pier. If this is any sign of what's to come, we'll be in for a long night.

***

* [4:48 pm GMT+1] [A New Imgur Album] (http://imgur.com/a/1S08D) shows a collection of images and the story behind them of events from the protests, well worth a look at before the news picks up again.

***

* [4:37 pm GMT+1] It is currently 6:37 pm in Turkey, with many of the planned protests beginning at 7:00 pm. Over the next hour or so, it is likely we will see a large number of people showing their opposition to current policies and political figures.

***

* [4:33 pm GMT+1] [The picture] (https://twitter.com/mirkoschaefer/status/340446801981214722/photo/1) that currently stands as the image that represents the protests has gone viral. A woman stands against the pepper spray of a riot policeman. 

***

* [4:23 pm GMT+1] A [new] (https://twitter.com/popartbiziandy/status/340476961388367872/photo/1) photo shows a suggested combat plan to the water cannons that have been controlling the crowds. [Here] (http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wm0VKv2C2TA) is the next update video. 

***

* [4:17 pm GMT+1] Unconfirmed twitter reports that the police have issued a widespread arrest warrant for anyone wearing a gas mask. This would obviously change the landscape of this protest hugely, giving the protesters the option between getting arrested or being peppersprayed/gassed. 

***

* [4:14 pm GMT+1] [OccupyGezi.tumblr] (http://occupygezipics.tumblr.com/) is showing a brand new pic of a bloodied man being tended to in shelter. [This] (https://twitter.com/aycaorer/status/340477522309419009/photo/1) photo shows police clearing a street of protesters.

***

* [4:08 pm GMT+1] The latest waves of vocal twitter opinion is now questioning the media and how they cannot cover this event when it is happening in the most populous city in the country. The situation in Turkey is seemingly worse than previous thought.

***

* [4:05 pm GMT+1] WARNING - GORE: A [new photo] (https://twitter.com/dilantoplu/status/340483621561454592/photo/1) has surfaced showing a woman on a stretcher, inside an ambulance with a bloody head wound. No information on how she received the wound - From previous images of injuries, it would not surprise me personally if the injury was sustained from a head shot from a gas canister.

*** 

* [4:01 pm GMT+1] Reports that the Health Minister has said ""You cannot protest and expect an ambulance."" - Reports that Amnesty International is beginning to mobilize members to help provide attention to the situation.

***

* [3:51 pm GMT+1] NewsBreaker has just tweeted [this photo] (https://twitter.com/CanYayinlari/status/340477667054858242/photo/1) out - Not sure on how genuine it is considering the time (5:51 pm)

***

* [3:47 pm GMT+1] Twitter feeds are suggesting hidden numbers of severe injuries, much larger than the 'minor injury' toll a doctor gave Reuters earlier. The situation is apparently much worse than what we are currently seeing - Wishing them the best.

***

* [3:44 pm GMT+1] Increased support from international sources - #OccupyGezi is now trending with many chiming in with their thoughts on the situation. Many more young turks are out on the streets tonight trying to make their voices heard - Their choice of tool being twitter.

***

* [3:41 pm GMT+1] Reported kissing protests for Istanbul and Ankara are just a few ways the activists are acting out against the government. The Prime Minister does not hide the fact he will be running for President when his current role expires, making the opposition fearful of his power.

***

* [3:38 pm GMT+1] [This] (http://ximoberna.tumblr.com/image/51805004470) image is starting to be retweeted more and more - Showing the locations of planned protests and times to arrive.

***

* [3:36 pm GMT+1] Reuters is reporting 100+ people are now injured from this protest - Further protests are set to form in other population centers around the country. Apologies over the space of the update, I was quickly producing an update video for those users wanting a video.

***

* [3:24 pm GMT+1] [The first rebellion] (https://twitter.com/emraheski/status/340472034045857792/photo/1) images are starting to pop up on twitter - How long this will last is yet to be determined.

**Details**

***

The event itself is a peaceful sit in, protesting the demolition of the 'last green space' in Istanbul. The protest is now in it's fourth day with protesters calling on social media to get the story out due to the heavy control the government holds on the mainstream media. 

There has been countless reports and claims of police brutality, even going so far as closing the metro gates after firing tear gas canisters into the area. One woman who was able to get on the radio found trouble breathing and was in great discomfort. 

Amnesty international is reporting 'the use of excessive force' by police, in their response to the sit in. It should be noted however, that the park is one of many issues this protest has grown to cover. Many protesters have joined in to respond to new laws threatening 'liberal lifestyles' such as a reduced tolerance of public affection and further limiting alcohol laws. Some are even protesting the handling of the situation in neighboring Syria.

Some are concerned that this could be Turkey's Arab Spring Protest, bringing the three term party of Prime Minister Tayyip Erdogan to an end. The Prime Minister has jailed hundreds of military officers, academics, journalists etc jailed and put on trial for alleged failed coups. 

The current situation involves 10,000's of protesters with the potential for this unrest to spread further. This poses a danger to those who have been inadvertently caught up in the event.

**TL;DR:** Hundreds of people were likely injured in a fiery explosion on Wednesday night at a fertilizer plant near Waco, Texas, that damaged or destroyed numerous buildings including a school and nursing home, authorities said. The blast was reported at about 8 p.m. CDT (0100 GMT on Thursday) in West, a town of some 2,700 people about 80 miles south of Dallas and 20 miles north of Waco. All times listed below are CST, as per my location. I apologize if this causes any confusion. Town of West Evacuated, all injuries are now at area hospitals.  Fire and PD dealing with flareups, doing another House-by-House search. Many local assisting fire departments from neighboring counties have been cleared and sent back to their districts. Other anhydrous tanks on site are reported to be stable for the moment. The Rest Haven nursing home has been damaged. 150 survivors from the nursing home have been taken to the West community center.

**UPDATES** (Times in CDT)

**2:42** Eyewitnesses have reported a dark curtain of soot and dust covering the area, with debris lying across roads, buildings destroyed and several fires still raging.

**2:47** @youranonnews: Fires at the plant are now under control and the threat of further explosion has been downgraded.

**2:53** The fertilizer plant where the explosion occurred was [cited for failing to obtain or to qualify for a permit in 2006.](http://www.khou.com/home/Fertilizer-plant-cited-for-06-permit-violation--203542181.html)

**3:56** New images of Apartment Damage: http://imgur.com/a/nXxzg

**4:03**  The town of West's mayor Tommy Muska: ""This is not the end of the world. This is a big ol' cut that we got across our hearts right now. But... we are strong. We will rebuild.""

**4:32** WFAA just spoke to Dr. Smith (West EMS Director) live, and he **confirmed the deaths of at least 2 EMS workers.**

**4:41** An emergency crew spokesman has now confirmed that there were no fatalities at a nursing home badly damaged in the blast. The home is close to the plant, and all residents were evacuated in the immediate aftermath of the incident. It is understood that 10 residents of the home were initially reported missing, but they have since been accounted for.

**4:46** Three hospitals are dealing with nearly 200 injuries. Several firefighters that were fighting the fire when the blast occurred remain missing, as does a law enforcement official. 

**BREAKING** The death toll is estimated to be between **5 and 15** at this stage. 

**4:49** Police said they had labelled the incident a crime scene, but they have ""heard no indication that it was anything other than an accidental fire"". Because crime scene investigators have not yet been able to get inside the plant, there is so far no information about how the fire started. Smoldering fires continue in the plant, and in buildings surrounding it, so the search operation is in some cases a slow process. Emergency crews will work their way through ""every individual home"" to check whether any casualties are inside. Police confirmed the smoke from the fire is not believed to be harmful. City officials will give further details on the latest situation at **10am** local time.

**5:01** **BREAKING/UNCONFIRMED** A spokesman for ambulance teams on scene told CBS that **two paramedics and six firefighters had been killed.** In addition, **one person** in an apartment block destroyed in the blast also died.

**5:05** Police said the air quality in the area is ""not an issue, it is not a concern"".

**5:22** Belgian news channel is seeking a french speaker to talk to them about the explosion. If anyone here on reddit can help with this, please contact 0032 2 737 40 32 or infos@rtbf.be.

**5:44** No nursing home residents were killed, and all have been accounted for and they are moved to a safe place.

**5:52** @WacoPolice: Area law enforcement, fire, first responders,etc. continue search and rescue ops. 160+ injured, numerous homes destroyed.  |   Missing Persons Number: **254-826-4115**

**11:29** Texas Task Force 1 (TX-TF1) was activated just before 1:00 am this morning by the Governor through the Texas Division of Emergency Management (TDEM) and deployed from their facility in College Station to West, Texas around 6:00 am to assist the jurisdiction in search and rescue operations after a large explosion at a fertilizer plant. The 80 member TX-TF1 “Red” Team is a Type 1 Urban Search &amp; Rescue (US&amp;R) Team consisting of Technical and Canine Search components along with Heavy Rescue personnel and equipment.

**11:31** Latest Presser [HERE](http://dfw.cbslocal.com/video/8787720-1000am-update-from-west/) from 1 hour ago.

**11:32** From 10:00 AM Presser - Sheriff Spokesman - 160+ Injuries treated, anywhere from 5 to 15 Dead so far (not confirmed on # of dead), Search and Rescue are still going on in ""continuation mode"". State and Fed SAR resources are with them, including Texas TF1 &amp; TF2, Burleson FD SAR, and Ft. Hood SAR. Many areas searching are having to be stabilized and shored up with heavy equipment before they can access the structures to search. It is tedious, time-consuming, but they are being very methodical in order to make sure lives are safe. As buildings are cleared, they are being marked as clear. There has been only 1 incident of looting, from very early in the situation - it has been dealt with, and the neighborhoods are completely secured currently.

**11:40** More info from Presser - Officials from the company are on site assisting with operations, but no statement is expected soon as they are quite busy. 24 minutes elapsed from initial fire call to explosion. Injuries and bodies were taken first to a ball field for triage, then moved to a community center when the cloud of anhydrous forced them to move.  State Fire Marshalls are on site and investigating cause of fire. Officials say no worries about environmental dangers in aftermath of #westtx explosion, thanks largely to wind and rain. Evacuees can NOT yet access their homes at this time.

**11:47** Sheriff's Dept Rep: Damage is widespread and severe. There are homes and buildings that are no longer there, for all practical purposes. There is nothing to indicate that this was intentional. ATF and State Fire Marshalls are investigating the cause of the fire.

**11:51** Gov. Rick Perry Press Conference live NOW [Here](http://www.breakingnews.com/topic/texas-fertilizer-plant-explosion-april-2013)

**11:55**  From Governor's Press Conference: At this time, we have no ""unmet needs"" in West at this time, and thank the other communities who have helped. The TX legislature is prepared to do anything needed to help West move forward from this incident, Our Prayers go out to them. If there are questions about missing family members, the Red Cross is point of access, please call **211.**

**12:00** There has not been a complaint on the fertilizer plant since 2006. The facility has been there since 1962. About 75 Homes have either minor to substantial damage. A school also has a substantial amount of damage. The number of employees at the plant is not known at this time. Gas pipelines being monitored, gas turned off to homes in the area.

**12:07** Cannot speculate on cause of explosion, and cannot say whether water used in the fire caused the ammonium nitrate to kick off,  Firefighters use water to cool the tanks in situations frequently. Keep an eye on the Governor's website for information on charitable opportunities to help those in West.

**12:19** Texas Commission on Environmental Quality: Plant in West had average compliance history - @KXAN_News

**3:32** New Press Conference [HERE](http://www.nbcnews.com/video/nbcnews.com/51587393)

**3:36** From Presser: Price Gouging rules activated in Texas. Anyone attempting to price gouge will be facing a lawsuit from the TX Atty. General.  TX DPS reports: they are still in SAR phase, looking for anyone still in rubble. For Security reasons, ATF has requested that nobody enter the affected areas.  The old library has been opened as a community assistance building for residents of West. A post office has also been opened for the residents.  Perishable items are not needed, please donate money to red cross instead.  Exact number of fatalities is not known. Cannot confirm mayor's statement of 30-40. Will not speak on issues regarding possible criminal negligence by the plant.  

**3:42** From Presser: Chief Deputy Sheriff reports: area is devastated, they are working with ATF and Fire Marshalls to determine cause. The investigation is volatile because of the presence of Ammonia at the site. EPA and TX Environmental are looking at the scene to determine the safety situation. Cannot speak about missing firefighters.   From Texas AG: Will not confirm numbers of missing firefighters at this time. Another press conference at 6 PM tonight.

**3:55** In response to the devastation in West, Texas, CBS 11, TXA 21 and CBS RADIO Dallas-Fort Worth stations NewsRadio 1080 KRLD, 98.7 KLUV, 100.3 Jack FM, 103.7 Lite FM, 105.3 The Fan and Mega 107.5 FM are partnering with Albertson’s Market and The Dallas Cowboys to support The Salvation Army’s disaster relief efforts.

Monetary donations will also be accepted at the registers at all Dallas-Fort Worth Area Albertson’s Market stores.

**3:55** While not official (we consider ""official"" based upon what is posted by USFA/NFFF) - details from reliable and involved fire service leadership at the scene in West, Texas (20 miles north of Waco) are indicating that, at this time it appears that: 5 West Firefighters, 4 EMS Medics, 1 Off Duty Fire Captain from Dallas (who was in town at the time and was assisting) and 1 unconfirmed (unknown agency at this point) Firefighter have been killed in the Line of Duty. Active search and rescue operations are continuing. **Dallas Captain Kenny ""Luckey"" Harris reported deceased by family.**

To all of the people worried about posting the terrorist's photographs: where were you during the Dorner manhunt? Oh right, he wasn't a Muslim. You can't censor an international news story.

&gt;From what I understand, once they had them in cuffs they radioed in about looking in the trunk of the cab. BPD said no, and to wait. Once EOD was sent out the officer(s) at that scene were told to call in on a cell phone.
It went private. Before it did, they radioed about taking pictures and trying to ID the three individuals that where in the cab (driver and two suspects). One photo matched records and then two others did not (??)
Cannot say for sure what that meant.

**Details**

***

Today is the fifth day of protesting in Istanbul and now, the first day of protest in other cities. The protesting started peacefully opposing the demolition of the 'central park' of Istanbul. Police responded with force and thus inflamed the situation.

Yesterday (day four) upwards of 10,000 people protested in Istanbul whilst other cities in Turkey and around the world joined in to show their solidarity for those standing up against the police and government.

The police have been using tear gas, pepper spray, rubber bullets, water cannons and charge tactics - Common crowd control methods, however usually only used when the crowd is violent or threatening. The crowd was none of which.

Mainstream media is not covering the events. Local media are afraid of being shut down by the government whilst international networks are using other stories to fill the gap and providing repeat pieces. There is no answer to why they are doing this.

The injury toll stands at 100+ whilst the death toll is at least 1. Amnesty International has called for a halt to the police brutality whilst  social media spreads the word of the Turks protest.

When questioned about this, the government ascertained that they are only collecting data on foreign nationals, which basically pissed off the planet, and only U.S. citizens that have a foreign link (so if you have an acquaintance who is a non-US-citizen, into the database you go).

The [Washington Post](http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/special/politics/prism-collection-documents/), learning that the Guardian was breaking the story, concurrently also broke the story. The WP shares the Guardians reporter in the byline.

Its as real as it gets. They have secured internal NSA training slides.

**REACTION:**

Former Clinton administration Chief Counselor for Privacy Peter Swire, CIPP/US, has written a [Privacy Perspectives blog post](https://www.privacyassociation.org/privacy_perspectives/post/telephone_records_and_prismthe_first_job_for_the_privacy_civil_liberties_ov) calling for the Privacy and Civil Liberties Oversight Board to make the NSA programs a top priority.

Foreign governments are in uproar. The European Union in particular has rules about data protections for civilians and privacy rights, which this appears to entirely disregard despite these companies operating in their territories, on the basis that anyone that is non-American is a suspect and can be datamined. Germany has called for the establishment of an EU-centric tech industry and the boycott of American services. 

German Federal Data Protection Commissioner Peter Schaar wrote [a blog post](https://www.bfdi.bund.de/bfdi_forum/showthread.php?t=4233) (in German) on the issue. He notes that the NSA program bolsters the need for a strong EU data protection regime. The EU-US data treaty that has been in negotiation for a few years is [now in jeopardy](http://euobserver.com/justice/120412). 

Several privacy advocates have chimed in, expressing concern about the program. [Alexander Hanff has written to](http://www.alexanderhanff.com/Revoke-Safe-Harbour-Status) European Commission President José Manuel Barroso calling for immediate revocation of the U.S. Safe Harbor status.

The UK government is [cross-examining GCHQ involvement](http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/2013/jun/07/prism-gchq-access-covert-operation) as it appear the UK also received some intel from PRISM.

The [companies involved flatly deny](http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2013/jun/07/prism-tech-giants-shock-nsa-data-mining) all knowledges at the executive level, however the nature of FISA orders is that no person may disclose or allow another person to disclose knowledge of the orders, so they may just be following orders. Facebook and Google official statements are [disturbingly similar](http://mashable.com/2013/06/06/facebook-google-apple-prism/). Business week also has a [nice summary / comparison](http://www.businessweek.com/articles/2013-06-07/the-companies-lines-on-prism) if you want an alternative source.

The Washington Post began [expanding and hedging](http://www.forbes.com/sites/jonathanhall/2013/06/07/washington-post-updates-hedges-on-initial-prism-report/) its article expecting a  legal / governmental shitstorm, while the Guardian (being out of US oversight) has stuck to its guns.

A [media spin war](http://blog.foreignpolicy.com/posts/2013/06/07/the_prism_spin_war_has_begun) over what direct access means has begun.

Here is a [Raw Story breakdown](http://www.rawstory.com/rs/2013/06/08/prism-europe-reacts-to-u-s-surveillance-revelations-with-anger/) of world reaction.

Twitter appears to be the only major social media to [not be a part of the program](http://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/2013/06/07/nsa-prism-twitter/2401605/), and its employees [reacted with shock](http://storify.com/EliLanger/twitter-employees-react-to-prism-the-nsa-s-surveil) - and as one can expect, Twitter users themselves were incredibly [vocally opposed to PRISM](https://twitter.com/search?q=%23prism).

This is a self-post so it doesn't count for karma.

If Reddit can raise $600,000 for a bus driver that Reddit users never harmed, then surely Reddit can also raise money to hire one or more dedicated private investigators with experience/expertise in finding missing persons to help Sunil's family find him as reparations for Reddit's part in libeling his name? 

I don't have the expertise / time / connections to start such a campaign myself, so someone else please take this idea and run with it.

[Here is the original post and discussion about the pressure cooker model.] (http://www.reddit.com/r/inthenews/comments/1chphe/boston_marathon_explosion_live_update_thread_8/c9glrom)  

My updates aren't necessarily in chronological order in each section (because I am editing information about each fact to make it current as we learn more) but rather in the order of importance for someone just coming to the thread to read.  I apologize if that makes it difficult for people to see what has been recently added, but hopefully it cuts down on people reading out-of-date information.

This is a thread for discussion of the released photos of the pressure cooker remnants as shown [here (original leak)](http://www.myfoxatlanta.com/story/21996004/exclusive-photos-boston-marathon-bomb) and [here (higher res, identifies the remains as having been found at SECOND site due to the granite tile)](http://imgur.com/a/RkOwk).  ""You must assume that the bad guy is standing right next to you. Use discretion."" - /u/MastersInDisasters.  Think before you post something that could be a direct lead to real, tenable information on the case.  We all want this guy caught and punished to the full extent of the law ASAP.  Feel free to PM me if you are not sure if you should post something or go directly to the authorities with it.

Basically, we are trying to identify which 6L models (and which dates of production of those models) have [this imprint and this information stamped on the bottom](http://i.ebayimg.com/t/Fagor-Duo-18-10-Stainless-Steel-6QT-Pressure-Cooker-Olla-de-Presion-Presto-/00/s/NDc4WDY0MA==/z/xBkAAOxyyF5RPkGN/$T2eC16ZHJGIE9nnWrPtqBRPkGNmHow~~60_3.JPG).  Notice the INOX lined up with ELECTRIC, and the two different pressure levels (.55/1.05 bar) listed.  (6L = 6 liter version) 

[This is a different stamp](http://imageshack.us/a/img203/5258/stamp2b.jpg).  This is also [a different stamp.](http://imageshack.us/a/img221/9132/stamp3.jpg)

Please correct me if anything I say below is wrong!  I've tried to identify speculation where it occurs. 

------------------

**What We Know About The Mystery Cooker(s):**

* Verified that one bomb was a pressure cooker.  Looks to be the second bomb, due to granite tile in the background of the base photos that is only present outside of Forum.  Still waiting for multiple verifications that both were.

* From the [Fox photos](http://www.myfoxatlanta.com/story/21996004/exclusive-photos-boston-marathon-bomb), we can see that the bottom of the pressure cooker, where it says [GAS ELECTRIC](http://waga.images.worldnow.com/images/2424731_G.jpg), shows the remains of FAGOR (a manufacturer) and that the imprint and [printed text](http://waga.images.worldnow.com/images/2424732_G.jpg) are identical to several models of FAGOR cookers (more below).

* A pressure cooker lid has been found on a nearby roof according to CNN's [""Breaking News""](http://www.cnn.com/?hpt=sitenav).  It is unclear from CNN's newsflash (accompanied by the photo of the mangled lid that we'd already seen) whether this is a NEW lid or they are just reporting where the FIRST lid (pictured) was found.  [AP is reporting](http://hosted.ap.org/dynamic/stories/U/US_BOSTON_MARATHON_EXPLOSIONS?SITE=AP&amp;SECTION=HOME&amp;TEMPLATE=DEFAULT&amp;CTIME=2013-04-17-03-10-06) that they were two pressure cookers, but they could be premature.  I'll stay on top of this as it develops.

* WAS THE HANDLE REMOVED?  I believe so.  [The bolts with the square nuts in the photos of the cooker from the second bomb](http://images.derstandard.at/2013/04/17/1363808799782-bombe8.jpg) are [bolts](http://i.imgur.com/osUfQNZ.jpg) that are designed to go into the upper section of a [handle](http://i.imgur.com/9y3n1lR.jpg).  Look how far away they are from the bolt head in the intact cooker as compared to the ones in the crime scene photo (which look like they were snugged right up against the lid).  During explosions, how often do nuts TIGHTEN?  I'm still waiting for user confirmation that those metallic slots actually are the position of the nuts (but it makes sense for [handle replacements](http://www.amazon.com/Fagor-Old-Elite-Splendid-Handle/dp/B00581WF2M)...unscrew the bolt from the inside of the lid and the nut falls out of the slot.  Doesn't even have to be held in place).  Speculation says that the fact that these bolts are still here (instead of removed) is interesting, if indeed the handles were removed.  Maybe the culprit just thought if he screwed them on tightly that it would keep that hole in the lid sealed?  We cannot verify from the photos that the Mystery Cooker's bolts are Phillips head (which if they were would support the theory that they are the original handle bolts.)

* The two pressure ratings listed (.55/1.05 bar) means that it was a two-setting model and those pressures are its low/high settings.  The PS number (1.6 bar) is a safety value of the pressure it would take to warp the base of the cooker (thank you to our resident pressure cooker expert!)

* It was 6 liters in volume.

* The [inside of the lid](http://waga.images.worldnow.com/images/2424729_G.jpg) matches the inside lid of all FAGOR cooker models I have seen so far and does not appear to be of great use in identifying the model.  (The Chef may be different.) We do not have the silicone lid seal present and/or visible, which might have otherwise helped differentiate models.   It does appear like instead of the [safety valve seal and port](http://i.imgur.com/osUfQNZh.jpg), there is a [bolt and nut instead](http://waga.images.worldnow.com/images/2424729_G.jpg).  From the [Elite manual](http://www.fagoramerica.com/content/download/9881/65850/file/Elite%20Pressure%20Cooker%20Manual.pdf) pages 7 and 8, we see that this valve is supposed to help pressure escape in excess conditions.  It makes sense that the culprit would try and plug this valve to build up as high a pressure as possible.

* A two-setting model is expensive (significantly more so than a one-setting model).  A detonation of this type should not require an expensive or very good pressure vessel (the walls would blow out regardless of a small hole or leak in the seal).  Speculation says that it is likely that the cooker(s) was purchased secondhand for cheap or already owned (either that or the culprit THOUGHT that a more expensive pressure cooker would perform better...)

---------------------

**What We Know About FAGOR Cooker Models:**

* From [FAGOR'S website](http://www.fagoramerica.com/cookware/pressure_cookers/rapid_express_line/rapid_express) we know that their current production line has only four two-setting models: the Duo, the Elite, the Futuro, and the Chef.  We have seen Duos and Elites with identical printings and stamps on their bases, but I haven't seen a Chef yet.

* FAGOR changes base-imprints often in the same line.  It is difficult to tell from online photos and eBay how old the cookers are, so it's hard to tell whether that's a chronological change or based on a factory or some other imprint.  

* Splendids say Splendid on the handle.  Elites say FAGOR on the handle.  Unless, of course, the Splendid's handle was [replaced.](http://www.amazon.com/Fagor-Old-Elite-Splendid-Handle/dp/B00581WF2M).  (Not supremely relevant given that we don't appear to have a handle for the Mystery Cooker, but might help identify your cooker if you don't have a manual/box.)

* Different models have different colour switches.  You can see the current line's colours on [FAGOR'S website](http://www.fagoramerica.com/cookware/pressure_cookers/rapid_express_line/rapid_express).  There also appears to be variation in the internal silicone gasket colour.

* /u/JohnnyP pointed out that though the handle halves lock together, the little ""wings"" around the lid circumference also [rotate into place when closing the cooker to prevent opening](http://youtu.be/nmuGX7pwjTE?t=4m24s).  Thus, the handle is not necessary to seal the cooler (though it certainly is if you want to cook with it!) as shown in [another brand of pressure cooker without the same kind of handle](https://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_detailpage&amp;v=E-DcgYqop-U#t=262s).

--------------------
**Things That Would Be Useful To Know/Have:**

* Information on how the base imprints change over time in the same model line.  Did they change in a certain year?  Is it based on something else?  We can get this information primarily by crowdsourcing people's cookers, so if you have a FAGOR cooker, please upload photos and any info you have on date of purchase!  Remember, we are both trying to rule out and identify models as possibilities, so everything helps!

* Information on whether any of the current one-setting models used to be two setting or the two-setting models one setting.  For example, /u/soupisawesome's Elites only have one pressure setting, contrary to the current Elite line, and it's because they were manufactured before July '11, as stated by [this Amazon replacement handle for ""Splendids and Old Elites""](http://www.amazon.com/Fagor-Old-Elite-Splendid-Handle/dp/B00581WF2M). 

* ""If someone has one of these similar [6L] models, stick it in a backpack and take a pic from a few angles on someones back. From a distance if you can. Maybe we can spot it then. "" - /u/leaknoil  If you can add something heavy, like sand (don't damage your cooker on our behalf!) to it to show us what that would look like, that would also be great!

* Are those bolts with the square nuts hardware that is actually found in the FAGOR lids, or is that ""Aftermarket""?  This info could help tell us if the handle was removed or not!  From [this photo](http://i.imgur.com/osUfQNZh.jpg) of a user's Elite, it's clear that these screws do go into the upper section of the handle and are Phillips head screws.  We cannot see such detail from the Mystery Cooker photos as of yet (photos from wrong angle).

**User-Submitted Photos and Information:**

*I will clean up this section tomorrow because I am tired now, so for now, I will paste what I had in the old thread.  Tomorrow I'll try and make a table out of anything I receive.*

TCanDaMan's FAGOR Elite 4L [imprint and pressure ratings](http://imgur.com/a/YBvAX#2XLPapK) as well as [lid-handle attachment](http://imgur.com/a/XdyfZ) seem to match that of the 6L pressure cooker in the evidence photos.  His was purchased at Macy's new at Christmas.  The Splendid also has a [virtually identical lid interior](http://i.ebayimg.com/t/Fagor-Pressure-Cooker-4pc-Set-Includes-4L-and-6L-Cookers-/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/tgAAAMXQLbVRa4J4/$T2eC16dHJFwFFZ8hL!tdBR,4J3kqQg~~60_57.JPG) from [this Splendid Ebay listing](http://www.ebay.com/itm/Fagor-Pressure-Cooker-4pc-Set-Includes-4L-and-6L-Cookers-/271190208011?pt=Small_Kitchen_Appliances_US&amp;hash=item3f24322e0b) but the bottom imprints do not match.  However, the imprints on [this ""vintage"" Splendid do](http://www.ebay.com/itm/Fagor-918060803-Splendid-Pressure-Cooker-/261098348609?pt=Small_Kitchen_Appliances_US&amp;hash=item3ccaaca041), though the jury's out on whether or not there is a hyphen between Gas and Electric on the evidence photos. 

UPDATES AS I CONTINUE CHECKING OTHER MODELS TO MAKE SURE THESE ARE THE ONLY TWO POSSIBILITIES: [The Rapida in this Ebay auction](http://www.ebay.com/itm/New-Fagor-4-Quart-Pressure-Cooker-18-10-Stainless-Steel-/171004240128?pt=Small_Kitchen_Appliances_US&amp;hash=item27d0a5a100) appears to have the same imprint on the bottom but not the same format of listing the pressure ratings as the evidence photos.  Other Rapidas have different imprints.  Also not consistent.

[This 6L Duo](http://www.ebay.com/itm/Fagor-Duo-18-10-Stainless-Steel-6QT-Pressure-Cooker-Olla-de-Presion-Presto-/130876567802?pt=Small_Kitchen_Appliances_US&amp;hash=item1e78d9f0fa) has the same imprint and pressure rating format, as does [FacepalmNapalm's 8L Duo](http://imgur.com/a/Tj3gP) purchased a year ago.  

[sixbluntsdeep's 6L Rapid Express](http://imgur.com/a/ToiAz) has the same imprint but only one pressure level on its base.

As stated before, soupisawesome's Elites are of a pre 2011 edition with only one pressure level, a gift from three years ago.

I have said some pretty terrible things about you in my life.  I'm a Yankees fan.  A big one.  I'm sure you've said some pretty terrible things about me and my kind too.  What exists between our two cities is a fabled rivalry.  We scream and we cheer and we fight for our cities, for our teams.  It's a passion that without which, this rivalry could never be.  Does anyone think that this sort of fan could be in a rivalry with anyone less passionate than themselves? No shot. It wouldn't hold up.

I was there when you guys beat us and went on the break records and win the World Series for the first time since 1918.  To myself, and certainly not out loud, I was glad for you.  You played well and you deserved it.  As a dedicated sports fan, I knew how much that meant.  As a Yankees fan, having seen my team win the World Series before, I couldn't even begin to fathom how amazing this must be for you, Boston fans, a first in most of your lifetimes.  I came to learn later that this was the opinion of a majority of Yankee fans.  We weren't happy.  Far from it.  But you are fans, long suffering, loyal fans.  And you deserved it.  And we got that.

I was in New York on 9/11.  The fear, the confusion, the panic, all of it is burned into my memory.  What happened yesterday, Boston, what happened to you and your city, and in the moments after and what will come to be the days and months and years after, it's not ok, and it’s not easy.  I'm not going to tell you that you will rise above and see the good in the people and your city, because it's been less than 24 hours and it's already evident.  It's very evident.

But here's what I do know.  Here's what I've learned from Red Sox fans and Yankees fans.  Boston and New York have this in common; we are strong, we are passionate, we don't hold back, we love our cities.  We love our people.   You come to our town, and you try to break us?  F you.  We will mourn the losses and we will clean up our streets.  We will cry and we try to explain to our children why this happened.  But have no doubt, no one comes into our towns and breaks us.  

For 86 years, you believed, almost every year, that your Red Sox were going to win the World Series.  You want to mess with that sort of passion?  I've watched you proudly march into our stadium with your Boston gear and cheer with definitive belief that you were champions with nothing more sometimes than faith and love for your city and your players.  These are the people of Boston.  

My heart hurts for you right now Boston.  But you know what?  There's this thought that keeps coming back to me.  I just keep thinking, as evil as the person or people are that did this, they are just as stupid.  You're gonna mess with that city?? On their day?  I'm certain there's a special place in hell for the perpetrator of this attack, but what I'm even more certain of is this city just got stronger.  And I didn't think that was possible.  My sports analogy might seem trite but if I have learned anything as a lifetime Yankees fan, it's that Boston will not take this lying down.  You are proud and you are strong.   Go Boston.  Go Sox.  Go Celtics.  Go Bruins.  Go Patriots.  I'm with you Boston.  We all are.  We are the same.  

Sincerely, 
Yankees fan, Boston rival, and friend.

1366457059.0,47,self.inthenews,1cqina,Is it possible that suspect #2 is more innocent than we think he is? [opinion],115,68,183,http://www.reddit.com/r/inthenews/comments/1cqina/is_it_possible_that_suspect_2_is_more_innocent/,"This might be an incredibly dumb and unpopular opinion here on reddit and I understand if you think differently but I can't help but feel, after reading countless articles about the two suspects, that there might be much more to the story that we don't know about. Almost all of suspect #2's relatives and friends (besides the uncle who hadn't been in contact with them for a while) said that he was a very smart, happy, and good kid. They say that they would have never ever thought that he could do something like this. In the videos at the marathon he's seen trailing behind his older brother, setting down his backpack, and smiling at his surroundings. I feel like someone who knew he was going to kill the people around him wouldn't be smiling at all and I really feel like there could have been a really slight possibility that he didn't know that he was carrying the bomb in his backpack that would end up killing and wounding so many people. I know it sounds sort really soft and stupid but I can't help but think that this guy was more innocent than we think. Everybody who knew him said so many great things about him and good kids don't all of a sudden decide to attack people. On the other hand, according to some things online, his brother more extremist feelings about America and recently had Jihadist ties. Apparently suspect #2 went back to class at the university on wednesday and attended school normally, went to the gym, and went to a party, and it was around Thursday or friday that he and his brother set off. Maybe this sounds like an idiotic conspiracy theory but could it be possible that he was just a pawn to his brother? Though, yeah, it is difficult to understand why someone would randomly set down a backpack and leave it there. Soon, after seeing the photos online his brother realizes they have to go and they make an escape. Suspect #2 must have realized that he had to go along with his brother because of family ties and perhaps he got caught up in the moment. His brother is wearing a suicide vest which means he was completely ready to die if he had to but suspect #2 seemed like he wasn't. After his brother came out of the car and was shot several times, instead of staying he fled the scene but he didn't kill himself. 

Reading back on this it sounds  ridiculous but I can't help but feel like we're all jumping so hard for this. We're all cheering and happy that Boston is safe again. We all call him scum and if he knowingly put the bomb there, he is worse than scum. But what if there is something that we're completely missing? I just feel that normal well adjusted kids don't set off bombs at a whim. I'm not sympathizing with him or his brother at all. I just feel that we have such little information and so much passion that it all comes together very badly. 

I apologize for this severely unpopular opinion but I just had to get it out there. Tell me what you guys think and feel free to completely shut me down and disprove my ideas. I'm also sorry for all of the gramatical errors and bad writing. I have no excuse except for the fact that I am a bad writer. 

My prayers go out to the families of the victims at the boston bombings. I hope the truth can come out. 

EDIT: The fucking backpack!! I just can't get over the fact that we really don't have hard evidence that THIS was the man who set it down. Yes, there is a picture of A backpack at his feet near the bombings but read this interesting take by reddit user mc-recovery:
[When I look at the pictures of them with their backpacks on, before the blasts, the packs don’t look heavy or “rounded” as I would expect if they were carrying pressure pots loaded with bb’s and nails and gunpowder. The younger one has his slung casually over one shoulder. I have carried heavy backpacks before, and they sag at the bottom and are “tighter” at the top. Carrying a heavy backpack over one shoulder causes one to lean to the opposite direction for balance, especially for a skinny person like the younger. He does not look like he is compensating in that way.]

I don't know anything but I just have a bad feeling about this. Great answers everybody! I am seeing both sides. Sympathizing with the suspect because of his age is really stupid I think but the older brother dynamic is interesting.

My son attends [redacted] as a kindergartner.  Like you, I was horrified by the shooting in Connecticut.  So I read with interest the email sent out by [redacted] with the new security procedures for the school.
 
I have some concerns.  Overall I don't believe that the new measures intended to increase security will be effective.  The new name badges and locked classroom doors would not have stopped the shooter in Sandy Hook.  But what they will do is scare our children and make the school feel like a prison.  
 
A quick look at crime statistics tells a different story then our 24 hour news cycle headlines:  ""In 1992 the violent crime rate per 100,000 residents was 758. In 2012, it was 386. Between 2000 and 2009; use of firearms in violent crime had decreased from a rate of 2.4 per 1,000 to 1.4 per 1,000."" 
 
And, ""During the school year of 1992-93 the number of on-location murders of students and staff at K-12 public schools was 47 (out of population of millions). In 2009-2010 (the latest year for which data is listed), the number was 25. Over the same period, the rate on victimizations per 1,000 students for theft dropped from 101 to 18. For violent crimes, the rate dropped from 53 to 14. And for ""serious violent"" crimes, the rate dropped from 8 to 4.""
 
On the use of name badges, I've heard stories of other [redacted] schools that have tried them.  They get lost easily and by mid-year no one used them anymore.  I have a hard time believing that my five year old will be very good at keeping up with his, which will only serve to increase his stress levels.  
 
In closing, our children didn't do anything wrong, let's not punish them.  Crime has been decreasing in our schools for decades.  Let's not let fear allow us to turn our schools into a prison.     
 
Thanks for your time and let me know if you want to discuss further.

I spoke with 'terrorists' and learned their point of view.,51,9,7,http://www.reddit.com/r/inthenews/comments/1i4jlb/today_i_travelled_to_the_west_bankpalestine_where/,"I travelled there alone, on an Arab bus, and met a Christian Palestinian woman who was born there. We went to the areas deemed unsafe, (H-1, where it is illegal for Israelis to go). I saw the other side, a Palestinian viewpoint, the Palestinian propaganda which I have never even had a chance to be exposed to, and I must say, it is very powerful. 

I met Issa Amro, a man labeled a terrorist 
(Proof of terrorist) http://blogs.jpost.com/content/fun-and-games-issa-amru-hebron, though his telling of the story is very different, as he says he is a completely peaceful, non-violent protestor. 

While in the area, I asked very little, but listened a lot. When I met this man, he asked me to ask him questions, so I asked him 2.

1. Why did the people of the West Bank and Gaza elect Hamas?
(not verbatim, but close) - The Palestinian Authority has been in power for many years, and the situation has only become worse. We live in a military state, more homes are taken every day, and we do not have the simple freedom to move from place to place. A trip to Ramallah used to take 20 minutes. Now, that same trip takes 2-3 hours. There are 4 checkpoints on the way, where they can hold me up to three hours (at each), and it has taken me 10 hours to travel there. All in all, under their leadership, they have not been able to improve our lives in the least. Hamas on the other hand, are great negotiators. Look at Gilad Shalit. They were able to take one captured soldier and exchange him for over 1000 captured patriots. While I do not agree with the methods they use, they are strategic and get things done. I can understand why the people voted them in. That being said, I did not vote for them. 

2. What is the resolution? A 2-state solution, etc.?
There can be no 2-state solution, no compromise, no anything, while I have guns continuously pointed at my head. Israelis live under civil law, we here in the West Bank live under Israeli Military law. I cannot negotiate when I have nothing. I am oppressed, and Israel is the oppressor. How can a person in a giant jail negotiate for their freedom. Until we are given our basic rights, like freedom of privacy, speech, movement, and others, we can not begin to consider anything. (I, Daniel, view this as very similar to our duress laws. For instance, if I have a gun pointed at my head and I sign a contract, that contract is not legally enforceable.)

He spoke about much more, like the reason the walls have been put up, and in his eyes, to systematically take control of the area (even though it is illegal under international law - a quick interesting read that explains the basics on both sides, http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israeli_West_Bank_barrier).

What an AMAZING day. There was SOO much more that I saw, but I think this post is long enough. 

I have heard the extremists on both sides, and I believe they both have valid points.

Updates:  License Plate 137-NZ1

Vehicle spotted in nearby Watertown.

Officers reporting suspects in posession of explosives, possibly grenades.

Reports of 2 officers down as well as automatic gunfire.

Bomb squad robot sent in to examine vehicle and package in street.

1 suspect at gunpoint, obeying orders.  2nd suspect in custody, police unsure if it's correct person.

Officers now reporting they DO NOT have the 2nd suspect.

According to CNN, FBI has arrived on scene.

Mount Auburn Hospital has issued a Code Black which, according to Ask.com, can mean anything from someone dying, to a bomb threat, to someone threatening himself or others.

CNN now reporting one suspect shot and taken to local hospital.

7News is reporting that suspect in custody has died.  Unconfirmed as of yet.

Final Edit:  Police seem to think 2nd suspect is ""White Hat"" suspect circulated in FBI pics.  News reporting both suspects are now in custody.  All is speculation at this point.

Together. We pooled our respective resources, talents, skills and knowledge - ourselves - into one common goal: making information available.

Whatever our background, culture, or point of view, we shared a unique experience unprecedented in human history. There have been previous harbingers, as the internet vehicles commonly referred to as ""social media"" have become available to, and been adapted by, an increasing number of the world's population.

But this was different. We knew that we were making history, writing, with each line of text we typed, each time we ""hit reload,"" a new chapter in the story of human communication. We felt it, and even in the midst of mourning the tragedy that was its genesis, it was a high like no drug or extreme sport could give us.

The making of that history was inevitable. That this chapter was written by our keyboards is pure chance. We were in the right place at the right time. 

Each of us will apply the things we learned and thought and felt, the mistakes we made, in our own way, to our own lives.

For some of us, it is only now that our ""Live Updating"" experience comes to a close that we will be facing and working through our emotions about the event itself. 

Especially for Redditors who have spent their lives in the US, that the bombing happened at all will be a very new and disorienting fact to process. For others, such occurrences are sadly not so uncommon.

However we handle the changing and shifting of our respective realities will depend on our individual personalities and life experience, but there are a few things that can help us all:

To secularize the famous Reinhold Niebuhr quote, separate the things that we can control from those we cannot, and focus on the former.

Appreciate the present for the great gift it is. That is very much within our control to do. Whatever the future may hold, we all have **now**, and nothing and no one can take it away from us.


Little children sometimes give us [very wise advice](http://i.imgur.com/iDwORnF.jpg) , profound in its simplicity, that if we will only heed it, can result in many more ""nows"" for us all to enjoy.

* **The Story So Far:**
****

* **The Mirror** 

&gt;The FBI was last night hunting a 12-strong terrorist “sleeper cell” linked to the Boston marathon bomb brothers.

&gt;Police believe Tamerlan and Dzhokhar Tsarnaev were specially trained to carry out the devastating attack.

&gt;More than 1,000 FBI agents were last night working to track down the cell and arrested a man and two women 60 miles from Boston in the hours before Dzhokhar’s dramatic capture after a bloody shootout on Friday.

&gt;A source close to the investigation said: “We have no doubt the brothers were not acting alone. The devices used to detonate the two bombs were highly sophisticated and not the kind of thing people learn from Google.

&gt;“They were too advanced. Someone gave the brothers the skills and it is now our job to find out just who they were. Agents think the sleeper cell has up to a dozen members and has been waiting several years for their day to come.”

&gt;A specialist team of CIA and FBI interrogators was yesterday flown to a Boston hospital to grill wounded Dzhokhar, 19, about the secret group. The University of Massachusetts student was caught on Friday after hiding out in a boat parked in a garden in locked down Watertown the day after a gun battle with police left his 26-year-old brother and a rookie cop dead.

1371160631.0,29,self.inthenews,1gapx5,Police: Father didn't report missing 9 month old for two weeks,33,4,3,http://www.reddit.com/r/inthenews/comments/1gapx5/police_father_didnt_report_missing_9_month_old/,"UTICA, N.Y. (WKTV) - Authorities are continuing to search for a missing nine month old baby in the City of Utica, a baby whose father, police say, didn't report missing for two weeks.

At a press conference held Wednesday morning, police said nine month old Levon Wameling was last seen on the doorstep of his home at 748 Jay Street in East Utica wearing a diaper, according to the child's father.

Police say the father, Jevon Wameling, 27, was confronted by the child's grandmother regarding the baby's disappearance and the grandparents then went directly to the Oneida County District Attorney's Office. Wameling is not currently being charged, but police say he is being questioned.

Police say the Levon's mother checked into rehab for drug use around the time of the disappearance.

Utica Police along with New York State Police canine units have been searching the area around the 748 Jay Street apartment where the Wameling family lived, even using posters in hopes of finding baby Levon.

""Right now our goal is to find the kid,"" said Utica Police Chief Mark Williams.

Jevon Wameling tells police that he isn't sure what happened to his child.

""He had a difficult time getting into his residence,"" said Sgt. Steve Hauck of what Jevon told police. ""He left the child on the front steps and went around to the back of the house and when he went to get the child the child was gone.""

Police are not currently treating Jevon as a suspect, but they do admit his story doesn't add up.

""I can't say exactly what went on during the interview, but suffice it to say that there is essentially no explanation for why you wouldn't report a child missing after two weeks,"" Sgt. Hauck said.

Many outside services have been called to aid in the investigation such as Child Protective Services and the National Center for Missing Children.

Police say they will continue searching day and night until baby Levon is found.

http://www.cbc.ca/player/News/ID/2229371544/

&gt;April 22: 2 individuals charged under terrorism sections of criminal code

&gt;Target: via passenger train
&gt;Al-Qaeda supported attack

&gt;Investigation began August 2012

&gt;The suspects did not post an imminent threat

&gt;Worked with FBI

****
&gt;Police reiterate that there was no imminent threat (no bombs had been produced, for example). 

&gt;Charges have been laid; terrorism related offenses.

&gt;Police stress that our resopnse to terrorism has to happen in our communities and in our homes. 
Keep your eyes open, Canadian redditors.

&gt;Warrants executed in Montreal, Toronto.

&gt;Suspects: ages 30 and 35

&gt;Evidence of conspiracy to attack Via rail passenger rail train in Toronto

&gt;Took steps to initiate terrorist attack

&gt; Surveillance trains/rail systems in Toronto.

&gt; Toronto Police, OPP, CBSA, CSIS, Via Rail and CN Police, + more, all supported investigation. 


&gt; Charges laid described as important. Suspects related to Al-Qaeda. Montreal was not a target. One suspect lived and worked in Montreal for a few years. 


&gt;Police monitored suspects closely enough that public safety was never in jeopardy. Police feel they have preemptively stopped the attack. 

* **Questions now being taken:**

&gt;Search warrants have been executed in the past hour.

&gt;At this time the investigation is ongoing. 

&gt;Two individuals are not Canadian citizens. 

&gt; Police will not discuss when the suspects came, or where they came from. 

&gt;Individuals were receiving support from AQ elements located in Iran. No indication that this plot was state sponsored. 

&gt; AQ elements in *IRAN*. Police state this again after reporter makes sure he heard correctly.

&gt;The support being received was in the form of direction and guidance. 

&gt;Suspects plotted to derail a train. A threat to the safety of people and infrastructure.

* **From the CBC:**

****
&gt;Canadian police say they have arrested two men and thwarted a plot to carry out a major terrorist attack on a Via passenger train in the Greater Toronto Area.

&gt;The two accused are Chiheb Esseghaier, 30, of Montreal, and Raed Jaser, 35, from Toronto. They have been charged with conspiracy to carry out a terrorist attack and ""conspiring to murder persons unknownn for the benefit of, at the direction of, or in association with a terrorist group.""

&gt;The two men arrested are not Canadian citizens, police said Monday, but would not provide any details about their nationality.

&gt;The RCMP accuses the two men of conspiring to commit an ""al-Qaeda-supported"" attack.

&gt;Police said the two accused were getting ""direction and guidance"" from al-Qaeda elements in Iran. There was no information to suggest the attacks were state sponsored, police said.

Assuming it is legitimate, it answers a few lingering questions from the events leading up to and following the bombing.

These include:

1.  Video of Bomber 2 setting down his backpack does in fact exist.  This video originates from the security camera above the Forum restaurant.  Bomber 2 is seen standing with the bag at his feet for several minutes, before eventually leaving the bag after the first explosion.

2.  A photograph taken from across the street confirms the bag on the ground.  (in all likelihood, this is the photograph reddit was scrutinizing with the bag clearly visible behind the Tufts girls)

3.  When Bomber 2 fled the scene of the early morning shootout in Watertown, he did so in the same stolen car in which the bombers arrived to that scene.  (this contradicts earlier reports that he fled in a stolen police SUV)  An IED was found undetonated in the trunk of this car when the car was later located sans Bomber 2.

I remember back when the Supreme Court announced their decision regarding Obama's health care bill, and you were quick to post a headline which said ""Obamacare struck down."" Of course it was soon revealed that you had failed to actually read the decision, instead opting to read one paragraph and extrapolate from that. You know what, whatever. That's fine. Wasn't a big deal. Just made you a laughingstock for a good week or so.

But earlier today, I receive a text from CNN Breaking News which says that the man responsible for the Boston Marathon bombing had been arrested. And of course that headline was on your front page for a long period of time. I can't imagine how many victims and survivors and the families of victims were overjoyed when they heard the news that this terrible man had been brought to justice. Oh, oops! Turns out he wasn't arrested. Once again, you failed to do an adequate check. You heard from one source that the man was arrested and you, a mainstream news channel that is funded with millions of dollars to report the actual news, decided that one source was enough.

I wouldn't be mad if this was just another silly slip-up like your Obamacare mishap. But this time, you may have actually caused victims' families real damage. I can't imagine the emotional roller coaster that comes with learning the person that hurt your family has been caught, only to hear an hour later that you were lied to by a channel that is supposed to report the truth. How about instead of jumping to conclusions so that you can be the first one to report, you have some common courtesy for the people that have a very personal interest in seeing the perpetrator of this horrific crime brought to justice? Like how when the bomb first went off, you and other news channels were reporting that there were other bombs scattered all around Boston, which presumably sent people into a panic, and it turned out to (surprise!) not be true. How about instead of focusing on drumming up sensationalist headlines with flimsy sources, you focus on being a responsible news source?

Sincerely, Racedogg2

It's a train wreck. Martin Savage noted that they were going ""totally unscripted"" and it shows. 

I know I can just turn it off if I don't like it or change the channel but watching it reminds me how journalism is falling apart right now. Here's CNN: an organization that has recently eliminated its investigative journalism unit. Their news coverage has turned to reading tweets, uninformative interviews, and just regurgitating what they read off the wire. A simple mention and maybe a quick live look at passengers exiting the ship would be more than enough for the Triumph incident. Interviewing every single passenger that steps off the ship is a recipe for bad tv. They're getting beat up on social media right now and rightfully so. At some point people have to turn off their televisions and ask for in-depth coverage of the issues that shape our lives. Enough with social media reaction. Enough with beating stories into the ground until they become a joke. 

I realize CNN can't go full investigative journalism 24 hours a day. That's unrealistic. They don't have the resources and no one would watch. But the balance has shifted way too far to the side of laziness and talking heads. You have a news story introduced, and then for the next 10 minutes you get a Republican/Democrat talking heads reaction. It doesn't inform us. It isn't even that entertaining.

I'm reminded of a quote I heard awhile ago when I worked in the media. I'm not sure who said it originally but it sums up how I view the role of the media: ""It isn't our jobs to report the stories people want to hear. It's our job to report the stories people NEED to hear.""

1366472680.0,19,self.inthenews,1cqu6l,"Did the Tsarnaev brothers blunder into an unrelated robbery of a 7-11 in Cambridge, MA?",27,8,15,http://www.reddit.com/r/inthenews/comments/1cqu6l/did_the_tsarnaev_brothers_blunder_into_an/,"The reports about the big manhunt Thursday night in Boston began with the news of a 7-11 robbery in Cambridge near MIT, followed by the shooting of the MIT police officer in the Stata center.  Apparently, police disputed the idea that the Tsarnaev's robbed a 7-11 at a Friday night press conference.  But pretty much everything I've read about this is contradictory, and I'm curious to figure out what happened.

There are some suggestions that the Tsarnaev's were present at robbery at a 7-11 which they did not commit.

During a Friday morning press conference, the Boston police commissioner 

&gt; showed a security-video image from a 7-Eleven which, he said, the brothers had tried to rob—one of the suggestions of the later part of the day was that this wasn’the case; somehow, they had just been there around the time of a robbery [New Yorker article, paragraph 3](http://www.newyorker.com/online/blogs/closeread/2013/04/gunfire-in-cambridge-and-watertown.html).

According to this [Business insider article](http://www.businessinsider.com/boston-manhunt-dzhokar-tsarnaev-escape-fled-foot-marathon-bombings-2013-4), 

&gt; In a crazy twist, Dzhokhar and Tamerlan Tsarnaev happened to be in the 7-Eleven that was robbed late Thursday night. It's not clear yet who the suspects are (or if there are any) in that case. Earlier reports said that the pair had been the ones robbing the convenience store.

This is a remarkable suggestion: the Tsarnaev brothers somehow blundered into an unrelated robbery.  Since the probably already knew that the FBI had put out fuzzy pictures of them, they would likely have panicked, knowing surveillence footage at the 7-11 would be soon be scrutinized and they'd be discovered.  Perhaps that what led to their shooting of the MIT officer (in his car; possibly a failed carjacking attempt.)

On the other hand, 7-11 denies that the Tsarnaev's robbed a location [MacLean's article](http://www2.macleans.ca/2013/04/19/tsarnaev-brothers-didnt-rob-a-7-eleven-spokesperson/):

&gt; Chabris told Maclean’s that a 7-Eleven location at 750 Massachusetts Ave. in Cambridge did experience a robbery last night, but the Tsarnaev brothers are not the suspects. She said widely released surveillance photos that feature Dzhokhar Tsarnaev do not resemble the interior of any 7-Eleven location in the area.

&gt; “I’ve seen the picture of the guy who did rob a Cambridge 7-Eleven store last night at 10:30, and let me tell you, he looks totally different than the [Tsarnaev brothers],” she said. “Not only that, the picture of the suspect that is on the news websites is taken from a store that is not ours.”

This (USA Today story)[http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2013/04/19/7-eleven-robbery-boston/2097915/] tells a similar story, though it's a bit confusing. It also says:

&gt; The suspects were at the 7-Eleven around the time of the robbery but they did not rob the store said, State Police Superintendent Timothy Alban at an evening press conference on Friday.

Note that 750 Mass Ave in in Central Square, which is a good 15-20 minutes to MIT on foot.  If the timing is accurate, and if this is the right store (there are other 7-11s closer to MIT), there's no way the Tsarnaev's could have shot Officer Collier at approximately 10:30 or earlier, which is what seems to be suggested [here](http://www.cambridgema.gov/cpd/Alerts/citizenalerts/policedainvestigatingfatalshooting.aspx).

So what's going on here? The best guess is just confusion: there was a robbery at a 7-11, and the Tsarnaev's were caught on video at some time at some other convenience store (possibly a 7-11, possibly not), and some police and  reporters have confused the events.  

But given the multiple suggestions that the Tsarnaevs were in the 7-11 at the time of the robbery, I can't be sure of that.  Has anyone seen anything reliable about this?

In the trial for the mass murder and bombings by the surviving brother of those two disgusting excuses for human beings, the term ""WMD"" (weapons of mass destruction) is used in the [description of charges] (http://www.bostonglobe.com/metro/2013/07/10/marathon-bombing-suspect-dzhohkar-tsarnaev-arrives-boston-federal-court-for-arraignment/Sg7AKqw9Y9XsayxeF9zUNJ/story.html) (note, this Boston Globe link has an subscription ad you can collapse).

Can someone explain why this term is being used?  I know these two awful terrorists blew up bombs that killed and hurt a lot of innocent people, but I always thought WMD referred to nuclear, biological, chemical weapons or ""NBC"".  It did when I was a soldier in the 80s and 90s, anyway.

In the meantime, let's hope this guy gets what he deserves and fast.

Thanks very much in advance for helping me with this.

While it has been amazingly informative, there has also been the very real situation of OPs of threads having to monitor people who were veering from discussion of events over into borderline witch hunt territory, and also people who were posting links to personal FB pages, etc. 

I see the potential for this sub to really become a useful source of breaking news info for 10s of thousands of people (as opposed to the other news subs which are really more geared for one post coverage rather than multiple update threads), but I think there should be some kind of way to label ""trusted"" users who will be the OPs of update threads. Not the same as being Moderators, but some flair or something that only the mods could award, which proves that a person has been a good participant in or poster of breaking news updates, so we don't have some situation where a person no one knows volunteers to take over a new post and then uses it to allow a witch hunt/etc to go on unchecked. Perhaps this has already been discussed by people who have subbed here longer than three days, but I wanted to bring it up, in case it hasn't?

To be clear, I think people have been doing a great job with the update threads and tamping down out of line behaviour, I just wondered what will happen if the sub blows up to a lot more people in the future.",,False,,t5_2rgzp,False,,,True,t3_1cm0bl,http://www.reddit.com/r/inthenews/comments/1cm0bl/meta_a_suggestion_if_this_subreddit_grows_after/,

To make things worse, sources say the judge claimed Jeremy did not show enough remorse for the woman who was bitten and sentenced him to 20 days in jail.

There was no context, but some other things were mentioned like ""three IDs"" and IIRC also some numbers which sounded like they might be drivers license numbers. Since there was media reporting of 3 arrests, I think perhaps it was assumed the ""three IDs"" tied to that.

Later in the night, when people were falsely saying the scanner had named Sunil Tripathi as suspect #2, a big part of why some people believed it is that they were saying ""Mike Mulugeta"" was suspect #1, and that *was* a name many of us had heard come over the scanner.

I know there was some other random traffic over the radio at that time, but what *was* the reason that name went over the scanner? Was he, prehaps, ""naked guy"", the bystander mistakenly arrested?

Since then, we haven't recieved much new information. A few news agencies have picked up the story. We've been slamming CNN/FoxNews/MSNBC with emails in hopes they may pick up the story to give much more exposure.
I'm asking, again, for help by spreading the news.

[Petition on We are the people...] (https://petitions.whitehouse.gov/petition/demand-release-former-marine-armando-torres/lcJbHhZ6) A petition created to get exposure from the government. Has about 400 signatures but needs to reach 100,000 for an official response

[Link to CNN feedback page] (http://www.cnn.com/feedback/show/?s=newstip) Coming from employees at CNN, this is the best way to get the network to pick up the story. Just shoot them a message demanding coverage of Armando Torres.

Olivia Hammar said this is the best to email.

I know this is asking a lot of everyone, but any help is greatly appreciated. It's been nearly 2 weeks since his disappearance. Family and friends are desperate for some type of info.

First, I want to begin by saying that the process to obtain tax exempt status is an extremely rigorous and intensive process whereby the IRS will examine the business purpose and how it will benefit the general public, and meet a variety of specific requirements.  And this is entirely appropriate, as the government should not just hand out tax exempt status freely.  

Secondly, organizations founded for political purposes are subject to additional guidelines and requirements, and the tax exempt status is often in question; Political organizations often have very close ties to large corporations, lobbying groups, and specific candidates, and it is improper to have a tax exempt group with a single beneficiary.

The IRS has a history of focusing audits and scrutiny on specific tax forms, businesses and individuals that are the highest risk for misusing/circumventing tax law (Either accidentally or on purpose).  This is entirely normal and logical business operations.  You would want to target the potential problem areas in order to have the most efficient results.  

It is my argument that groups with ""Tea Party"" or ""Patriot"" in the name are normally (somewhat radical) conservative groups.  These  groups have a clear anti-government and anti-tax agenda.  They are therefore obvious candidates to misuse the US Tax code, not out of an attempt to fraud the government necessarily, but more likely out of a different ""interpretation"" of the laws and guidelines.  Conservative Political Organizations applying for Tax Exempt status are inherently subject to high scrutiny.

I don't find a significant news story out of this.  I read this as the IRS doing its job, and targeting groups who are the highest risk of illegitimately avoiding paying taxes.  The issue at hand, is one that I've argued for years.  There needs to be more transparency at the IRS specifically (and the political process, including government, as a whole), and a simpler tax code.  

Source: I am a Tax Accountant and CPA, familiar with IRS Procedure

TL;DR The IRS is merely doing its job, and targeting groups who are the highest risk of illegitimately avoiding paying taxes. ",,False,,t5_2rgzp,False,,,True,t3_1e8vlj,http://www.reddit.com/r/inthenews/comments/1e8vlj/some_perspective_about_the_irs_tax_exempt_scandal/,
