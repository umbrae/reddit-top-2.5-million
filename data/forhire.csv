",377,32,75,http://www.reddit.com/r/forhire/comments/14cwyd/for_free_pm_if_you_need_help_with_your_resumes/,"I've been in HR for years, and screened thousands and thousands of resumes. I've hosted hundreds of interviews, and if you need help with dusting off your resume and revamping it, or need some pointers during an interview, PM me. 

""unfuck the world.""

EDIT: apologies for any misspellings in my replies, have no time to proofread. But I proof (twice) any of the resumes people have PM'd me. 

EDIT2: Thank you for all the PM's. I'm doing my best to review, read, correct, and PM you all back as soon as possible. thank you for your patience.

EDIT3: Clocking out for the night as soon as I finish a couple more PM's requesting resume help. I'll be back in the morning to post up some general pointers and clear up some common resume/interview questions a lot of you are asking in the PM's. 

EDIT4: Still got some unanswered PM's. I noticed a lot of similar issues in a lot of resumes I got, so here are some general rules to follow:

#1- Proper format calls for work-experience to be at the top of the resume. Why? Because we're cross checking the requirements of the position to your qualifications. We want to know HOW/WHERE you've utilized the skills you claim you have in an office/work setting. Listing off skills is easy. Giving examples of where and how you used those skills is more useful. 

#2- Layout. 
DATE-------Organization Name-----Location [next line]
(Position) [next line]
-Duty
-Duty
-Duty

#3: Skill summaries/ Personal summaries: These are mostly out of date. You don't need to include them in your resume. First, they take up space that could otherwise be used to add more duties under your work EXP. Second, most of what you cover in a summary is what we want to see in a cover letter. No point having it in two place. BUT, if you feel that it is necessary, by all means leave it, no harm done - it's not a red flag or anything...

#4. Consistency. Lots of redditors resumes have job positions in multiple industries, but they were working the same profession/tasks. You need to show that. If you worked at a marketing firm and you were making coffee, making copies, and you wrote ""Staff Assistant."" But now you're applying for a Marketing Coordinator position, you need to change it up. For ""Staff Assistant,"" you write, ""Marketing Staff Assistant."" Why? Because the word ""Marketing"" matters if you're applying to a Marketing job! 

Same thing for random, oddball jobs. Oh, for three years you did yard work for a local gardening company, and now you're applying to an office job? Guess what you're now a ""Customer Service Representative."" It's not lying. You dealt with customers. You represented their interests...you serviced them. Done. That's the game.

#5: A lot of graphic designers out there looking for work. I keep referring to www.elance.com. great place to make a portfolio or market your portfolio.

#6: Organizations Category. If you've volunteers anywhere, are part of a club, a frat, a sorority...this is the category that those things go under. Regardless if you did IT work for them, were a leader, or managed a group of 30 people. This is the place for NON-PAYING positions to go. 

#7. Dates. Write your dates! I can't begin to tell you how important this is. Write your dates so that we know when you worked, how longed you worked for. This helps us calculate your experience, and to ask about any gaps that we might find between work places. Proper format? Try to remember the month. For Example: January 2009- December 2011. If the full month takes too much space on a line, abbreviate to Jan., Feb., etc. 

I'm still getting around to more PM's and answering on here so that I can clear up any general questions you might have.  Thank you for your patience. 

EDIT5: Going on a 2 day hiatus. No, not cause of PM's. Planned a camping trip =D  BUT, I answered as many as I could. If I didn't get to yours, I will on Sunday or Monday.

I took the last post down because LoveMHz agreed to have the project completed by that Wednesday Aug. 29th (with a revision by me beforehand), and because he was getting harassing phone calls from people which I felt bad about.  
  
I did not receive the project by that Wednesday, and was away in LA/Vegas from the 30th - 4th, which I gave him as additional time to complete the work. Not only was he still late, but he has been downright abhorrent in the way he has acted to me. The final product did not work at all ([screenshots here](http://imgur.com/a/fiesY) -- there was absolutely no function, resizing, or anything -- just the red square you see). LoveMHz then tried to blame me for ruining his progress because I couldn't add the widget to my phone (it did not show up on my widget list on my first install, I possibly missed it because he incorrectly named it ""StackWidget""; could not even pay enough mind to spell ""Stock"" properly). It was a 3-4 day delay on my part, after 4 months of delay from him, and it should not excuse the app being absolutely incomplete. Anyway, I'll let [our correspondence do all of the talking, you can see it here](http://i.imgur.com/1xysO.jpg).  
  
**I've also found very similar feedback here [in which he screwed somebody else over on assemblergames.com](http://www.assemblergames.com/forums/showthread.php?31333-Negative-feedback-LoveMHz).**  
  
**Recap of original post:** Hired LoveMHz for $2,600 on May 12th to make widget for me which he confidently said would take less than 2 weeks. I gave him a $2,200 (85%) deposit because he was desperate to pay for school, he had good feedback from other redditors, and I felt like being kind and helping someone out. After multiple excuses, emergencies, and issues he stopped answering me until I made the post which finally captured his attention. He also made a promise to refund money if he was not finished by July 6, which he obviously did not meet, and revoked his offer of giving the refund.  
[Full Contents of First Post Here](http://i.imgur.com/O94up.gif)  
  
**What now:** I will be filing a legal claim against LoveMHz, as suggested by many redditors who kindly took their time to reach out to me. My state has a long arm statute which will require LoveMHz to appear for court here. I will also be getting back to some of you about doing the job or doing other work. I appreciate the support and do acknowledge that not everybody on here or out there is there to scheme people out of their money. I have had good experiences on /r/forhire, including a programmer who I have worked with consistently for over 8 months (and we are now partners on one of our endeavors).

I have made the source code he sent my other programmer available for anyone who wants to inspect it and see how much work was done. I am not a programmer and have no idea what %age of the work was done.

*Edited to change the Source Code link, since LoveMHz had it removed due to Copyright claim.

I tried the usual career sites with little sucess and a lot of annoying calls and emails from people who didn't read my resume. I then decided to try reddit.

Here is my original post:
[r/forhire post](http://www.reddit.com/r/forhire/comments/n5jzx/for_hire_software_developer_5_years_of_experience/)

The response I got was completely unexpected. I was contacted by some very nice companies, much better quality responses than any career site. One of those responses was from a recruiter, [Adam Steinberg](http://www.reddit.com/user/JSP_NYC_MWD), with [Jobspring Partners](http://www.jobspringpartners.com/) in New York. How did that work out for me? Well, I am typing this from a hotel in New York, 1300 miles from my home in Louisiana, looking for an apartment to rent before I start work here in 2 weeks!

Adam and Cole did a great job matching me with companies looking for my skills and working with me being halfway across the country. I ended up getting hired by the company at the top of my list.

Thanks to reddit, r/forhire, Adam, and Cole I am now pursuing a dream, moving to a new city, and getting ready to continue my career at a great company. If you are hesitant to post here, don't be.

1358824733.0,242,self.forhire,1716w0,[META] I propose that we prohibit hiring posts which pay in anything other than currency.,261,19,47,http://www.reddit.com/r/forhire/comments/1716w0/meta_i_propose_that_we_prohibit_hiring_posts/,"I've been seeing a lot of posts here offering equity in lieu of payment. While this type of posting may sometimes be beneficial to all involved, it's usually something along the lines of ""I have a great idea, all I need is a programmer to build it"". My position is that such activities aren't hiring. There's /r/startups and /r/entrepreneur for building a company, but it seems to me that this would be more for people looking to pay to having work done and other people getting paid to do it. 

Most every developer I've met (myself included) gets approached about implementing half baked ideas for free often enough in real life. I think it would be nice to have a place where we can offer our services and be found by serious customers without being spammed by ""idea guys"" looking to build ""facebook meets twitter and google"". 

So my questions are: 

Are any of the developers or designers here ok with working for equity or are you mostly interested in cash? 

If you're only interested in cash, are you ok with restricting the sub to paying jobs and gigs only?

**Edit**

This has been accepted as a rule for the sub and linked to in the sidebar. For anyone who does want to post equity-only jobs try:

 * /r/startups 
 * /r/Entrepreneur 

An even better idea would be to pick out a small part of your project, offer cash only and find out if it will be a good fit. Then use that pre-existing relationship to bring them on as a founder.

I'm a recent first-time employer from /r/forhire/ and I wanted to share my experiences, as I would have appreciated reading something like this before jumping into this.

Let me begin by saying that I am extremely pleased with what I found. I was looking for an experienced PHP/javascript guy ([post here](http://www.reddit.com/r/forhire/comments/h0184/hiring_parttime_php_javascript_mad_scientist/)), and ended up with just that + 20 years experience with SQL as an added bonus.

Almost all the messages I received were serious, and I got a total of 13 amazing candidates. I went forward talking with 3 of them, and from them my savior emerged. I'm paying him twice as much pr hour as my last devs (who weren't cheap either - but were hustlers and didn't deserve it), but he's still cheaper than my last team, because he is extremely fast - and he even takes time to clean up old code and make it easier to maintain. 

In short - I'm not using Odesk or the likes ever again. Even though Reddit has grown to the size it has, the sense of community still seems to influence attitude and sense of obligation. Or maybe I'm just overjoyed with my first experience, and seeing everything through rosy-tinted glasses :D So I guess caveat emptor still applies as it always does. But for my next opening, I'm looking on /r/forhire before anything else.

The guy I ended up hiring was fandacious - I can highly recommend him for anything PHP/Javascript/SQL, but he has many other skills (he set up my VPS in no time). PM me if you want a detailed recommendation, or just give the guy a ping. 

PS: Any PR-people out there with contacts in Market Research publications?

After going over his /r/forhire post and portfolio @ [Studio WANDER](http://www.studiowander.net) we scheduled a meetup at Starbucks and went over the whole project and discussed the deliverables from his end.

Long story short, after further deliberation we finally came to an understanding that he would provide us with everything within 4 weeks (give or take a week based on revisions). He sent over the invoice on September 4th and half the payment was made right away on the same day with an agreement that the remaining half would be paid upon completion.

5 weeks later... here we are. InfraggableKrunk has ONLY managed to send me 3 logo samples (the quality of work... a 6th grader could have done that for me within 20-30 mins on photoshop)... He submitted those 3 logo samples roughly 3-4 weeks ago... He has since ignored all email communication and phone calls.

It's disappointing to come across these scammers on reddit but what can you do.

I would really appreciate it if everyone who reads this can upvote it for exposure. I am already aware that I am most likely not going to see my money again but I want to make sure that InfraggableKrunk does not get a chance to SCAM anyone else on here.


**Update 1** - My apologies for the delayed reply. I just got home from work. Thank you to everyone for the support and advice. We tried calling him again today hoping that the post here would have made some difference but he is still ignoring all communication.

By popular demand -- [http://i.imgur.com/kNSol.png](http://i.imgur.com/kNSol.png)... that is the work he submitted to us (3 logo concepts). He was hired to do the logo, branding and a concept for the landing page.

I also want to thank everyone who replied by pm offering to help finish the designs. I am going to try and get back to everyone of you by tonight.

Yes, I paid the $350 balance on the project meatsnack did for me. Why? Just look at all those comments baby. Did I want to? No.

I'll admit I was a dick for not responding to her. I've been busy with work and traveling. No excuse. I should have responded as soon as I received the email from meatsnack with the final product. To be honest, I still don't know what to say? What I was sent and what was agreed upon are two completely different things.

Let's start with the photos I sent her for reference for the project. I can't seem to find the post now? But I recall her saying I didn't send proper photos to work from? Here's her email response to my email after I sent her 9 photos to work from,

**""Wonderful! Great images to work with. I'll let you know if I need anyone in another position, but I can probably make it work with this. I just got back into NYC after a brief FL trip, otherwise I would have confirmed that I received these sooner. I might be able to find a visual reference to help draw her holding baby, it shouldn't be too difficult. I'm really tall, so if all else fails, I'll get a doll or stuffed animal, hold it on my hip and take a picture of myself to get the positioning perfect.""**

As far as no contact from a client wondering about a mock up? or direction of the project? Here you go.

Ok. Let's preface this with her other response that she has turned down work inorder to get these, at least my, product done. Who turns down business?

As far as no contact? Here's an email I sent her after she requested the text for the poster,

**""How about just a big 40 with an asterisk 40* Then time to party at the bottom somewhere. Not sure if that would work as I don't know the layout? Thoughts??? 40 *Time to party. 5.5.2012 Something like that. I guess thats movie poster like?""**

And that's the last email I sent her before she sent the finished product over and demanded payment before any revisions would be done, (within reason) her words. Revisions within reason for a $650 poster.
I have more if anyone cares to see? Do I feel like I got fucked big time? Yep. Am I pissed she sent a letter personally addressed to my wife with all the context of our emails and the project? Yep.

I always pay and follow through on projects, I'm a designer myself. I know what it's like to be shafted. I've worked with tons of creatives and have had some ups and downs.

I know this is a long shot, but I am getting to be desperate now.  On May 11th we received notice that the place we were living was set up illegally and we had to leave by June 1.  I have done everything I can to find a new place, and in the end we have a unit coming available June 25th that we can afford to move to.  The problem is that between June 1 and June 25th we have nowhere to go.  'We' being my husband, myself, and my four week old son.  

I am not working at the moment because I am having a hard time healing from the C-section surgery to bring my beautiful son into the world.  For the last week I have been looking for work anyway because I can't have my family on the street.  Yes, my husband works but he doesn't earn much and it will all go towards bills that are due at the beginning of the month.  If there were a day labor office in this town, I would be there yesterday.  But I have not been able to find work fast enough.

So here is the deal: I am willing to do anything and everything to earn money. I will answer your phones, type up reports, set up excel worksheets or Access databases.  I can do HTML editing, minor (very minor) php work, set up CMS systems, write contents for websites, and more.  If you are in the immediate area of Newport, OR I will even do manual labor for you until my fingers bleed.  I will even call and break up with your girlfriend/boyfriend for you if I can earn money for it.  I am willing to do anything it takes to get money to keep us off the street.  If it were just my husband and I it would not be such a big deal, but four weeks old is much too young to be homeless. Please, if you have any work I will take it.

I stretched his developer knowledge and he came through by researching on the net how to implement certain things (object specific caching and lazy load).

She just graduated college in May, and is taking an extra year to continue her studies on her own.

The past two months I've been living as frugally as is possible, while maintaining my internship and supporting her... but in the absolute worst case scenario, last night as we were sleeping, a burgular broke into the very bedroom we were sleeping in and both of our absolute most valuable material things. From her: an ipad, a laptop (with extremely sensitive documents), and an electric dictionary.  The burgular also took my laptop (also quite sensitive documents), my iphone, and all of the money in our wallets combined (about $115). Both of our bank accounts are totally empty right now.  She is absolutely devasted and is even toying with the idea break up, but nothing decided yet.  I'm soooo worried :(

With my current job, I have no chance in the world to make enough money to replace even one of the lost items in any sort of reasonable time, much less eat for the next month and pay rent, so I'm looking for some extra work.

Of these, only one [Marion Serenio](http://www.marionserenio.com/), had the right experience, a nice portfolio, and good prices*. 

He delivered quickly, with great communication and really nice code and up to date code implementations.

For reference I received prices ranging from $80-$4000. I won't mention the specific price because I want Marion to be able to set his own prices and be competitive as he sees fit; it will suffice to say that for what he created I felt like I got a great deal.

The Killian’s Pint Master:

Wanna get paid to Facebook during the day, bar hop at night and travel around the country? Right on, well what about starring in entertaining videos directed by all your “Friends” on Facebook and Twitter?

OK, this could work. We also need someone who loves making people laugh ...and talking about beer. In other words, we’d like to hire the life of the party. So if you’re shy or embarrass easily, stop reading. We want someone that’s up for anything, like making awesome videos you’d actually want to share with your friends.

Jacobson Rost, the advertising agency for George Killian’s Irish Red, basically just needs a hyper-social being with an infectious sense of humor to become the face and voice of Killian’s. Somebody that can handle talking to consumers online, in bars, at sporting events and even at grocery stores ...the pint master. So if everything here just screams (your name) apply for this position. Now.

I got scammed from someone I found on ForHire,108,12,59,http://www.reddit.com/r/forhire/comments/s6h1j/forhire_warning_i_got_scammed_from_someone_i/,"Unfortunately, as much as I thought everyone on this subreddit was an honest 'redditor' looking for work, I was wrong.

Summary:
Posted an ad for help updating my ecommerce site. Got a lot of responses. Went with this fellow from Texas. Sent him $300 to make sure he knew I wasn't going to stiff him. Flash forward 2 months, dozens of excuses and ""should be finished up this week"" and ""sorry, I was sick"", and I have nothing. 

I was more than patient with this person and spent a lot of time outlining EVERY aspect of the site. (I hate when people give you no guidance in a project).

He either doesn't really have the capabilities to do the site or just wanted to take the $300, thinking nothing will come of it. 

I asked him for some of the money back (thinking that he did spend some time on the project) but he won't give back anything. And he won't finish the site. So, 2 months later and I have nothing to show for my $300. 

So, this is just a warning. This subreddit has a very honest/safe feel to it, but unfortunately, I have a feeling there might be scumbags on here. I'm out $300 because I entered into an business agreement honestly and wanted to make sure someone was confident they wouldn't get stiff. So I got stiffed. 

Specifically. This guy's name [Deleted by OP]

He is associated with this site:
http://adstounding.c_m/

Edit: I want to thank everyone for their help/advice and kind words. A few Redditors even offered to help finish the site to show that not everyone is a dick. That's really cool.

I was able to find someone via ForHire that did the site exactly as discussed and did a great job in about 3 days. Unbelievable guy. So, this Edit should serve to show that this is still an awesome place to find great help.

I basically wanted this to serve as a kind of 'warning' to those people looking for help with a project. I think because this is Reddit we all think that everyone here is like-minded/honest. But just wanted to warn everyone to be careful out there and do your due diligence. 

Edit: Okay, some people have said that I shouldn't post personal information about this person. I see their point, so I took it down. I do, however, think that if you are operating immorally in a business situation than you should expect that others spread the word. Regardless, it is down.

Edit: On a **POSITIVE NOTE** and since someone mentioned, I thought I would give the info to the guy that actually did exactly what he said he would do and completed the site in 2 days. Amazing fella. I would recommend this guy to anyone. http://alexander-carroll.com/

I believe that posting outright the amount that I am willing/capable to pay is the most effective method to get applicants that are actually relevant to me, and some readers of this reddit seem to think that by doing so I'm trying to rip someone off of their dignity, money, time, or whatever it is that makes you mad by my posts.

Every time I've posted something with low pay I've got so much hate mail from this subreddit but I always take it on the light side, **knowing** that some readers actually find my posts useful considering the amount of replies I'm getting most of the time.

I think you guys should consider the following facts:

A) Not everyone in this subreddit are US Americans

B) Not everyone in this subreddit makes a $80k per year doing whatever it is that they are doing

C) Not everyone in this subreddit can make even a third of that in a year

D) As a result of A, B, and C, there are those in this subreddit who consider a $20k a year job to be something worth while

That being said, there are literally dozens of posts I see all over reddit complaining about not being able to find a job, and worse, not being able to find ANY job, and yet when offered a job with a lower pay reddit seems to consider that blasphemy.

People are sitting for months on end trying to land a job, and when they do, they celebrate it with a over-the-top post on reddit, and yet in this subreddit, some jobs are just considered not worth the effort, and some redditors deem these jobs unworthy not just for themselves (which is perfectly acceptable) but for the entire community by downvoting the posts, even if they are 100% legit.

Why does this subreddit behaves like that? Why are some job propositions are considered ok while others are not? Are you so morally and monetary objective that you can deem other posts and people irrelevant? Are you so full of yourself that you post up the minimum wage of the US as to show me what a dick I am that I'm willing to pay only what I am able to pay?

You are not only offending people like me, time and time again, over and over again, but you are causing the people who look for jobs like the ones I publish to find this subreddit irrelevant, because my kind of posts are dowvoted despite [these kind of talks](http://www.reddit.com/r/forhire/comments/szcjz/revenge_of_the_downvote_tldr_only_downvote_scams/) we had before.

I've been part of this subreddit almost from the day it was established, I'm participating by posting jobs, posting [for hire] when I'm looking for work, replying and contributing to others posting and saying constructive things when I can, but yet my posts are not welcome here.

To the mods: I feel like you are cohering that kind of behavior among the users of this subreddit by not deleting/warning offensive and/or irrelevant comments. Could you please also be a part of this discussions so that some of us get a clear view of what this subreddit suppose to be?

If this subreddit is US centric, and jobs should be posted based on the US income tables, or otherwise they are considered a scam, please let me know, I will try to find a *global* forhire subreddit where these kind of posts are acceptable.",,False,,t5_2qzbh,False,,,True,t3_t6yzq,http://www.reddit.com/r/forhire/comments/t6yzq/ok_guys_and_girls_we_need_to_talk/,

First, I found someone that completed the site for me before I made the post. This person I also found on ForHire. He did a great job and we are very happy with the result. (www.bloomsimports.com)

Second, I had at least 3 people PM me and offer their help. 2 for a reduced fee and one person for free (as much as he could reasonably help with). The site was done, so I didn't take them up on the offer, but it's the thought that counts.

Third, in an attempt to work out the situation with the original guy who screwed me over, I told him that I would take back half of what I paid and we would call it a wash. Prior to the post (which in the beginning contained his person info) he wanted nothing to do with that. After the post, however, I received an email that he would like to move forward with the proposal of sending back the $150. He has since sent me $100. I don't expect the rest, but if he does send it, I will let everyone know.

So, as crappy as the situation turned out. I just wanted everyone to know how the overall experience was.

1344310636.0,80,self.forhire,xszp0,"[For Hire] 25yo FELON in San Jose, California!",100,20,72,http://www.reddit.com/r/forhire/comments/xszp0/for_hire_25yo_felon_in_san_jose_california/,"Yeah, I'm putting it all out there up front. I am a felon and have been for the past 8 years (since 18.) My crime was burglary, I stole some things out of an open garage and got caught, which here in California amounts to burglary in the first degree, which I was subsequently convicted of. I can provide full details of the crime to anyone interested in giving me a shot, but for the sake of some privacy, that's all I'm willing to tell publicly.

I've had jobs since then but they've always been menial (Starbucks and various restaurants and retail work) but never jobs or a career that were going to get me anywhere short of a place to live. 

Job searching as a felon is a soul-sucking, mind numbing experience. I can't tell you how many interviews I've nailed at such amazing companies here in Silicon Valley (Apple, Sprint, a contractor for Google, just to name a few) only to be turned down because the next guy isn't a liability on paper. It truly is incredibly depressing to feel in my heart I'm meant for more than has been afforded me. I've made mistakes and they don't define how I view myself. After years of ramming my head against the brick wall that is job searching, last year I made the decision to go back to school. All I feel I can do is overshadow my past transgression in the form of self improvement and education, so that's what I'm doing. 

A few weeks ago, I heard about r/forhire. Immediately I felt it might be the perfect venue to air it all out there, somewhat anonymously, with NO terrible feeling coming out of the interview thinking ""I'm perfect for this job, they practically told me so; yet it's not happening, I'm banned from society."" and I am proven right. They never tell you it's because of your record, they legally *can't.* I'm told something like, ""We decided to go with another candidate,"" or something of that matter. Just thinking about it hurts. 

So I'm looking for basically any job that can be taught on-site, in or around San Jose, California. I am extremely customer service oriented, very personable, always on time, organized and give my best at everything I do because I take pride in my work. I understand how fortunate I am to have a job when I do, most felons are in fact. 

So there it is! All on the table, if you'd like to know more about me, PM me or leave a comment. I will be checking this regularly over the next few days. If you've even read this far, I thank you. If there's one thing I can leave you with it's that if there's one principle you live by, be it one of humility and non-judgment of others. Thank you! 

Edit:This received a lot of attention and I've been thrilled with the response. No job offers yet but that's okay, it its been worth it. The discussion it opened as well as the advice I've received has been one of the most rejuvenating experiences I've had in a while and I thank you all tremendously. I love reddit to pieces.

1370740544.0,74,self.forhire,1fygxl,[INFO] How to protect yourself in a contract work situation (as a contractor or a client),86,12,14,http://www.reddit.com/r/forhire/comments/1fygxl/info_how_to_protect_yourself_in_a_contract_work/,"In the time I've been around this sub, I have unfortunately seen several stories from redditors about getting burned by their client or contractor.

Most of these cases involve similar themes-- non-communication from the other party after money or completed work changes hands.

While people can and do post testimonials in this subreddit, they are easily buried, and nobody keeps much track of who is recommended or who didn't follow through. I don't see much of a problem with that, because a compiled list of people with ""black marks"" against them would be difficult to verify in the first place and could easily be manipulated.  The real onus should always on the parties involved in a contract-work situation to verify the reputation of the other person involved.

To that end, I decided to write this list of tips for contractors and clients on how to protect themselves in a work-for-hire situation.  Since I have been on both sides of this coin (contractor and client), I hope my experiences will prove helpful.

**For Everyone**

* Get as much contact information as possible. Just a reddit handle is not enough. Get email addresses, phone numbers, company affiliation information (if any), skype ID, website url, etc.  This contact information will be vital if the other person ghosts on you.
* TALK to the person before beginning work. Sometimes I even break this rule if it's a rush job or a very simple one, but it is always best to speak to the other person on the phone or through skype. That way the objectives of the job can be discussed verbally to ensure there is NO confusion about the requirements. This is especially important if you are working with someone who does not have English as their first language, as the meaning of words may vary or be confused in a written job description.
* Verify their reputation (if possible). You wouldn't trust an essentially anonymous person you know nothing about to perform work in your home, so why would you in an online-only situation?  Check out their website, portfolio, references, contact information, business they work for, etc.
* Communicate. Before, during, and after.  Touch base once a day, or at least once every other day. Don't give the other person a chance to forget about the project or fall off the radar. Agree with the person up front about a communication schedule, and stick to it.  
*  Use PayPal or some other payment system with dispute resolution. Cash, Check and Money Order have no way for you to get paid, or get a refund.  
* Get a contract. It doesn't matter if your job is a piddly 1-hour task. Have a contract anyway. Make sure to be specific, so there is no room for creative interpretation of the terms. Depending on the work to be performed, the contract could be very complex or very simple. But all should contain the following sections:   

**Who**: Who are the parties involved in the contract?  
**Where**: Where will the work be performed (for example, if it is for a website, mention the domain name involved here).  
**Plan**:  What is the objective of the work? Is it to develop new branding via a logo? Is it to redesign a website? Is it to copy and paste 50k cells in Excel to a PDF document? Give a generic summary of what is to be done here.  
**Deliverables**: This should be a bullet-pointed list of what will be performed. If it's a logo, this should include how many specs will be provided, how many revisions, etc. If it's a website, this should be a comprehensive list of what will be done, from designing the theme to installing plugins or writing custom programming elements. Anyone reading this section should be able to tell immediately what they are getting.  
**Payment**: Simply put-- how much, when, and payment method. If it is to be 50% up front, 50% on delivery-- put that and the exact $$ amounts. If it's hourly, include the hourly rate and payment schedule. Make sure to specify how the money will change hands (via Paypal, Credit Card, Check, etc).  
**Notes/Add-ons**: Any stipulations, notes, etc should go here. For instance if the agreement is that the hours should not go above 20 hours, then put that here.  
**Signature and Date**: There are many digital signing programs available to allow you to sign a document digitally. Use them. A contract is useless if it is not signed by both parties.  

I have made a sample contract as a public Google Doc available [HERE](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ZKEnoSwc-7WFrxinzVXPU0J_Txgwt6E8jYOotrrANug/edit?usp=sharing) to help you out. This is an ACTUAL contract I have written, with the client name and prices removed. Take it, copy it, use it however you'd like.

**For Contractors**  

* Get paid up front. This doesn't mean you have to bill 100% up front, but get at least some initial compensation for your time, so you aren't completely out of luck if the client disappears. Work on a milestone system, with at least 33% up front on fixed price jobs. If you're doing work hourly, estimate the number of hours it will take you to complete the project, and require that you be paid for 1/3 to 1/2 of the estimated time up front. Some clients may be worried about being out THEIR money as well, and hesitant to pay. While this is understandable, you need to give the client confidence in your abilities and reliability. Keep a list of references they can contact, or a link to your online feedback at a freelancing website like oDesk. Make it clear beyond a doubt that you are worthy of their trust, and thereby, their money.    
* Log your time.  Even if you are doing a fixed-price contract, keep track of your time using something like [Toggl.com](https://www.toggl.com/).  In the event a client wants to negotiate the price after the fact, you can use the time-tracking records as proof of how much time you have invested into the project and why your price is justifiable.  
* Be organized.  Nothing is worse for your reputation or for your clients than when you accidentally space on a deadline. Use a project management system to keep track of deadlines, leads, and projects. I personally use [Trello](http://www.trello.com) to handle my projects.  
* When possible, deliver final products after final payment.  For some situations, this may not be possible, like when doing copywriting, marketing, or other services.  But for things like graphics and logo design in particular, ONLY provide the client with watermarked, low resolution proofs until you have approval and final payment. Then you can deliver the final product. For situations where this is not possible, make sure you have plenty of payment milestones marked out along the way to ensure you don't do a TON of work and then end up not being paid with no recourse (unless you want to be a dick and take down their site/article/SEO work, which I don't agree with.)  
* Get and give feedback. After a successful project is done, ask the client to post a testimonial here on /r/forhire, or write you a reference for use in the future. Reciprocate by writing one for them, recommending them as a client. It's good for both of you!  

**For Clients**  

* Be specific. Make sure your job description and communications with potential contractors are specific and leave no question about what you expect to be done, when you expect it, and how much will be paid for it. (See my ""contract"" note in the first section)  
* Cheaper does NOT mean better. You get what you pay for, essentially. Sure, you may find someone who will do your website for $200, or your logo for $20, but do not expect the experience to be easy or fun. If you want a contractor that knows their stuff, will deliver you quality results, and will not have to be micromanaged and/or you'll have to get someone else to fix the problems they leave behind-- raise your standards and your budget (if possible).  
* Be selective. Don't choose the first person that responds to your /r/forhire post. Many quality contractors on here only have time to check this sub once or twice a day, and many times Hiring posts from only a few hours before are already filled.  If you have a rush job, of course this doesn't apply-- but if you have a day, or two-- use it! Yes, you will be flooded by tons of PMs that you will have to sort through and find who will fit you best. But consider it like a normal job; you wouldn't normally hire the first person who walks through after posting a help wanted sign in your window-- why would you do the same for an online contract?  Take the time to carefully vet the people who apply and interview them.  Come up with a list of qualifications your ideal contractor would have, and a list of questions they should each be able to answer.  This will make the hiring process much easier for you, and you are more likely to end up with a great contractor that will provide you with excellent service.  
* Be open-minded. You may have a specific vision for your end result you'd like to see. Communicate that to the contractor, but be open to suggestions from them. You are hiring this person for their expertise, so trust them when they say that red text on a black background will look awful, or that you most definitely do need an SSL certificate to take credit cards on your new website.  
* Protect your investment by staying involved.  Give useful and constructive feedback, so the contractor can help you realize your vision. Make sure you have access to all assets along the way, such as passwords to your new website, database, etc.  You don't want to be stuck in a situation where you have no control over what is going on.  

**Problem Resolution (For Everyone)**

* Be amicable. If you have a dispute, start with an open mind and keep the goal of resolving everything to all parties satisfaction. Don't immediately get angry or defensive.  
* Use all channels of communication. At the start of this post, I emphasized getting as much contact info as possible. If the other person becomes non-responsive, use each of those channels to reach out. Do not just send one email and assume they have ghosted when you don't get a reply.  
* Be persistent. If someone is non-responsive, they will eventually HAVE to answer you if you're calling every day. If they know your number, call from a different number like Skype click to call, or Google Voice.  Reach out to others in their company.  Be a google sleuth and find other means of contacting them, such as Facebook, Twitter, or LinkedIn. It won't take many posts on a public business Facebook page about ""resolving our dispute"" for them to contact you back.  
* If all else fails, take action. This may mean attempting to get a refund through PayPal or charging back on your Credit Card, or it could mean Small Claims court.  Keep all communication and documentation (remember that contract I talked about?) handy, so you have the paper trail on your side.  
*  Don't be vindictive. If you have a bad experience, it's fine to post a warning on /r/forhire, but don't go out of your way to slander the other person any way you can. That just makes YOU look unprofessional, as well. This also goes for holding assets hostage and/or removing websites from the internet until you get paid. Yes, you can do it, but I personally don't think anyone *should*.    
*  Remember that one bad apple does not ruin the bunch. If you've had a bad experience in a contract work situation-- that sucks, but you have to move on.  There are MANY more qualified and experienced contractors as well as awesome and responsive clients on reddit than there are deadbeats and wannabes.  Don't let a bad experience sour you on /r/forhire-- it's a great resource to hire great people, IF you take the time to prepare yourself and your project correctly.  

If there's anything I've left out, please let me know and I will add it.  I'd also be happy to answer any questions, either as a contractor or in a client capacity.

**Suggested additions to contract (some may only be needed for major contracts):**

* That payment of initial deposit indicates agreement, even if unsigned. (need to find out legality of this one).
* Intellectual Property rights do not transfer until final payment has been made. This way if they use any of your work without paying you, you can sue. (Thanks to the Mike Monteiro video above).
* Firing offenses - on BOTH sides (yes, you can fire a client). What constitutes firing offense by both parties that would merit ending the contract immediately.
* Kill Fee - if the client terminates the contract early without good cause (outlined in contract), or if you have to fire the client for any reason listed in the firing offenses, this is a fee you are entitled to in order to offset your monetary and time losses.

5 Years ago my father closed his custom cabinetry shop in NJ which he owned and operated for nearly 25 years because of the rough economy. Since then he has been working various odd jobs doing home repairs, custom cabinetry, and re-fabricating older cabinetry. He also has done some work building houses. It's not enough to cut it- 5 years and he's pushing broke, having lost a lot of money he was saving for retirement.

He tried for a while to find government jobs as he had worked for the government in buildings management prior to owning his business, but it was to no luck. About a year ago, around the time of his 60th birthday, he stopped applying to jobs all together, pretty much giving up on account of his age.

Please help my father find a job.

His credentials:

* -University of Rochester Graduate- B.A. History &amp; Political Science

* -About 6 years as a buildings manager for real estate companies and the government

* -Almost 30 years as a custom cabinet maker (highly skilled), 25 of them running his own small business, typically 1 or 2 employees at a time

* -Certified NJ Home Inspector

* -Current Commissioner of a multi-county Sewerage Authority

* -Strong Writer, being a frequent letter to the editor contributor as well as having his own blog on our town's patch.com website.

* -Migrant workers have commented that my father is a hard worker (Now that is a compliment!)

This is his LinkedIn Summary:

I am particularly interested in neighborhood preservation through the repair and remodeling of existing one to three unit structures. I also hope to use these projects to provide job training opportunities in the building 
trades and to apply LEED and ""green collar"" principles to renovation.

Specialties
Expertise in building management including: general administration; maintenance, repair and replacement of building systems and equipment; general management and supervision of interior alterations and exterior cosmetic repairs.

1)	I am looking for any way to negatively differentiate you from the other 1000 resumes I have to read. If you make it hard for me to understand why I should hire you, I am not going to try… I just throw your resume out

2)	If you take the time to personally write me a note, or show me some sign that you care about getting THIS job it will go a long way to get you through the first screen. I can’t count how many resumes I have tossed when the “objective” said something totally un-related to the job they were applying for. If I can’t trust you to get your own resume right I won’t trust you to work here. 

3)	Get your phone # and email right. I will not try hard to figure it out.


4)	LISTEN to the question I ask in the interview… clarifying questions about what I am asking you are not just fine they are appreciated… rambling on about something I did not ask you costs you points

5)	Make it as easy for me to contact you as possible. If I get an auto-reply from your spam filter that says: “Your message about ""Job XYZ"" was waitlisted. Please add yourself to my Guest List so your messages will be delivered to my Inbox. Use the link below.”  I will not be clicking it and you will not get an interview. 
These are just a few things to keep in mind. I know it makes me sound crass, but it just ends up being reality; I have a day job and can only put so much effort into hiring and I want to invest that effort into hiring only the best. I cut 95% of the resumes I see and then put real effort into understanding the candidates behind the remaining 5%. Then I hire ~0.5%.  

I’ll throw out an offer to review resumes for any of you out there looking for jobs in Finance, Accounting, etc.  PM me and I’ll let you know how.

Work from home!,95,24,61,http://www.reddit.com/r/forhire/comments/vx8po/hiring_chat_in_english_with_high_school_kids_in/,"This online English-tutoring job entails 20-minute one-on-one Skype sessions where you will engage in ""free talk"" conversations with high school students living in Korea.  The purpose is to help improve their speaking, listening, and grammatical skills.  You don't need to know any Korean, but it is VERY IMPORTANT to have a good grasp on English grammar, as well as the ability to catch and correct their mistakes.

Due to the time zone differences, the classes can only take place from 6AM to 11AM EST, Monday through Friday, but you can schedule your classes however you'd like based on your availability within that time frame.

There are no textbooks or curriculum, so you will have to come up with your own game plan for these conversational sessions.  There will, however, be a shared list of topics and reading passages made available on Google Docs for ideas and listening exercises.

Each 20-minute session will pay $5.50 and the payment will be sent to you monthly via PayPal (if you don't have an account set up it's very easy and free to create one).  Teachers must keep their own timesheets and send them in monthly.  When a student informs you of an upcoming absence, they should be marked as excused and there will be no payment.  However, when a student is absent without notice and you are online, you will be paid for your time.  

If this sounds like something you're interested in and can commit to, please send me a PM to set up an online interview.  You will need a Skype account, a webcam and microphone, a small headshot photo, and a brief blurb about your background (a resume is beneficial but not necessary).

The job will begin next week on July 9 so the sooner I hear from you, the better.

One thing I want to stress is that **this job should not be seen as a main source of income** due to the few hours (4 hours a day at most) and the nature of the position (work is not guaranteed as students occasionally drop, although we do try to keep the best teachers' schedules filled).

I'm currently a web designer/ecommerce director for a manufacturer. The location where I work is not the corporate office, and corporate just went dark on us the other day. They sent out a new company structure spreadsheet and our location was not on it. My boss here has tried to get some answers, but has not received any yet. The sales guy at our location is friends with a lot of the corporate offices, and when questioned about anything going on, he clams up.

Normally I would say that as the only developer the company still needs me, but we got a new CEO back in June, and he could care less about having the company on the Internet (he's an old-school industrial guy), so I can't count on even being offered a relocation.

I'll gladly send a full resume if requested, but here are some relevant highlights - for the record, this is professional experience, not me starting at 12 playing around with things. I'm currently 33 years old.

* Over 10 years experience with HTML/CSS
* Over 8 years experience with PHP/MySql
* Over 8 years experience with Photoshop
* I've concurrently used Mac, Linux, and Windows throughout my life
* Over 10 years experience with troubleshooting/help desk
* Over seven years experience in management (I was a LPO in the Navy, and managed a Gamestop for four years)
* I was the hiring director for a year at the call center for one of the big tax-prep companies. I interviewed and hired over 400 individuals.
* I spent a year as an online magazine editor, and another year writing daily articles for another online magazine.
* In the Navy I wrote over 700 SIGINT reports, using current journalistic standards.
* I speak Hebrew fluently.
* I taught computer science for a year at a small community college.

In general, I'm a laid back guy who loves to work with a close-knit team, but I can also work alone if the job calls for it. I'm very intuitive, and in almost every company I've worked for I end up being more involved than my job requires. A lot of my supervisors have come to trust my instinct and opinion.

I'm not asking for a lot. I have a wife and kids. All I need is a job that pays enough to support them. Not looking to be rich. I'm willing to do almost anything, even if it's outside of my current skill sets. I'm a very quick learner, and I enjoy the learning process.

As mentioned in the title, I am willing to relocate. There are some places I have zero desire to live, but beggars can't be choosers.

If you're interested, please send me a PM. Even if things go south in the next few days, I don't think I'll be out of a job right away. If this location is shut down, there is still a lot to do to get us out of here.

Thanks for reading.

**1) If you're looking to hire someone, preface your headline with [hiring].**

**2) If you're looking to *be* hired, preface your headline with [for hire].**

/r/forhire is open to any sort of job postings, from c-level execs to yard work, and anything in between. Realistically, though, most of the postings are IT/web/design, because Reddit generally indexes high against those groups.

**if you're hiring**:

- preface your headline with [hiring]

- be specific.  include a job description (or a link to one), requirements etc. in the top text.

- put the basics in the headline.  what's the job? where is it located? etc.

- indicate how you would like interested parties to follow up.  pm? email? phone?

- preface your headline with [for hire]

- be specific.  include a portfolio or resume (or a link to one) in the top text.

- put the basics in the headline.  what do you do? where can you do it? etc.

- indicate how you would like interested parties to follow up.  pm? email? phone?

More interesting than the traffic is the resulting spike in subscribers from each of these events: [Exhibit C](http://i.imgur.com/n4UpyYs.png). 

You can see that while the traffic spike this week was ~10x larger than the spike from the blog post in April, the new subscribers gained was about the same.

1304614464.0,60,self.forhire,h4xkw,Looking for work? I recommend recruiters.,80,20,58,http://www.reddit.com/r/forhire/comments/h4xkw/looking_for_work_i_recommend_recruiters/,"*It always surprises me to find out that a lot of people haven't even considered using recruiters or headhunters when looking for work. I'm not sure if they are just unaware of what the recruiter game is all about- or if they had a bad experience. I have had mostly good- sometimes mediocre results with recruiters- but always better results than simply looking for work on my own. Here are some of the pros and cons I have had with recruiters over the past 3-4 years:*

----------------
**Pros**

----------------

**Recruiters know people.** Very often, recruiters have direct connections to the hiring managers at various companies- people that you would never be able to get an audience with otherwise. These hiring managers get 100 resumes on their desk every week, but when the recruiter they know and trust calls, they pick up. Recruiters are dialed in to the specific roles these hiring managers are looking to fill, so they have their pulse on what's available right now.

**Recruiters are hungry.** Since recruiters get paid when they get you work- they work hard to get you employed. You don't pay them a dime during any part of the process- that's all handled by the employer. All you have to do is be a rockstar and get hired. Because you don't have to pay to use recruiters, you can have as many recruiters working for you as you want simultaneously. You can then inform each recruiter of your other recruiters and they will begin to compete with other recruiters to get you work. It's all a big game, but you- as the human resource- are at the advantage.

**Using recruiters is a better use of your time.** You could talk to 3 companies in a week, or have 3 recruiters talk to 20 companies. It's strictly a resources thing- you only have so many hours in a day- and you have other obligations to take care of. Recruiters are working 8 hours a day trying to get people like you hired. They will spend as much time as they are able to trying to do that- working sometimes weeks to get a single person hired.

**Interview less.** Many times, going into an interview- you will realize that you aren't even qualified for a job. You might also realize you're a small fish in a big pond or vice-a-versa. Recruiters tend to do some of the filtering for you before you even get to an interview. The company has probably shared information with the recruiter that wasn't in their job posting such as 'won't take a candidate that wants more than this dollar amount' or 'please don't send us any more candidates from this educational background.' Since the recruiter knows these things when they look over your resume, they can decide if you should even be in that interview in the first place. Your interviews will end up being a lot more focused and relevant to your skillset.

**Make more money (possibly).** This one isn't a guaranteed, but a lot of times recruiters can negotiate pay more effectively than you can. They do this because then THEY can make more money. Recruiters make the most money off of hourly employees (in the long run), but they do make a flat fee if they get you a job as a full time salaried employee. Be careful though: It is the recruiter's determination to undersell your skills to you, and oversell you to their client so they can receive the best possible margin. Know what you're worth and be reasonable with your salary expectations. Talk to 5 different recruiters and see what they're willing to submit you at and you'll get a clear average of your monetary worth.

----------------
**Cons**

----------------

**Recruiters may try to undersell you.** There's always a chance a recruiter will try to inch you in at the same amount or just a tiny bit more than what you were making at your last job when you really deserve more. The best way to prevent this from happening is to talk to multiple recruiters to find out what you are worth. If you talk to 5 recruiters and one of them is pitching you far below the other 4, you can take that as a good indicator that that 5th one is trying to take you for a ride. It's for this reason I don't tell recruiters what I made at previous jobs. They will press you for that information- but it's not necessary for you to share that if you don't want to. Your best response is to say something like, ""I would like to be submitted at this amount- do you feel that this is reasonable?"" If you get pressured to share salary history, just tell them something like, ""I have made it a personal policy not to share that info with recruiters"" and move on with the conversation as quickly as you can. Be courteous with recruiters, but be firm. They work for you and you can drop them if you don't feel like they are looking out for your best interest.

**Recruiters may try to place you where you don't belong.** Sometimes, a recruiter that is hungry enough to get someone hired will have you interview for a position you have no business interviewing for. If you are in the interview or on the phone with the company and realize this- courteously tell the potential employer that you may not be suited for the position they're hiring for with your skillset or experience. The interviewers will appreciate your honesty and may even pass you on to a different department where you are qualified. DO NOT attempt to talk your way into a position you're not qualified for. It will only backfire when you lose your job 2 weeks down the road for not being able to complete the requirements.

----------------
**How to find a recruiter and what to expect**

----------------

Finding recruiters is easy nowadays. Just hop on the google and do searches in your local area for 'recruiting agency,' 'staffing agency,' 'headhunter,' and so on. See what comes up. Don't be afraid to go with small agencies- sometimes small firms can fish up big jobs! Also don't be afraid to talk to recruiters that aren't exactly in your job sector. Perhaps you are a systems admin- it's not wrong to talk to a corporate finance recruiter. They are friends or coworkers with other recruiters- or they have a financial client that is looking for a systems admin. It's never wrong to contact a recruiter- you may just have to hop around until you find the right person within a given staffing agency.

Once you go in to see a recruiter, expect to have passed on your resume to them- and if you are in certain fields (such as creative), expect to sometimes be given a proficiency test so that they can gauge your skill level in the programs required for the job. Treat your meeting with the recruiter the same as you would a job interview. Attempt to sell your skillset and experience to the recruiter so that they know how to best present you to their clients. But relax- interviewing with a recruiter is a lot less nerve wracking than meeting with a potential employer. For one, it doesn't matter if the recruiter thinks you're a doof. If they like your resume and think you're qualified, they're going to try to place you. They may even give you pointers on how to better interview when you do go in to talk to a potential employer.

----------------
**Conclusion**

----------------

I hope these thoughts have been insightful for you in your job hunt. My most recent 2 jobs were the result of recruiters and they were jobs that very specifically fit with my skillset. I am back out on the market again- going on interviews- some referred from recruiters, and some of my own efforts. It's a good idea to do both when you're job hunting- but getting recruiters moving for you is a far more efficient use of your time and resources than flying solo. Good luck and happy job hunting!

Hey there, I'm Nathan Young, and I am a Remote Services Technician for Support.com. First off, I want to say that I am not a recruiter; I am a regular employee who stands to gain a small bonus for each person hired and retained on staff for at least a few months, if not permanently. Because of this, I'm NOT an official source of info, but I'm ALSO not a fire-and-forget poster. I have REAL experience working in the same position you will be applying for, and I've been a redditor for a long time. I'll be around to answer questions, find you answers, and so on.

That said, Support.com is hiring a huge (seriously, massive) number of tier 1 technicians right now. We're preparing to expand one of our projects and we need the man power to do so. This position:

 * Is available to **US Citizens** living in the United States only
 * Is 100% **work from home**
 * Pays $11.00 per hour
 * Is **full time** with occasional overtime or voluntary time off available
 * Is available with a variety of scheduling options to fit your needs
 * Includes medical, dental, and vision **benefits**, as well as a 401k plan, and paid time off
 * Requires only basic tech experience; we'll train you, seriously, and it's paid training
 * Is not temporary or seasonal. We're not going to cut you loose after a few months.

**THE DAY TO DAY**
*****
To give you a rough idea of what working at SDC is like, shifts are usually 8 hours long, 5 days a week. You'll turn on your computer a few minutes early, get clocked in and two or three tools turned on and ready to go. When your shift starts, you mark yourself as ready to take calls and wait. On busy days and times of day, you might get a call instantly. I think my busiest day ever was about 15-20 people in the queue for probably around 3 hours. It was back to back. On slow days, you might be sitting there doing very little for upwards of 15 minutes. Most days, the time between calls is around 5 minutes. Most calls last 10-20 minutes.

The customers we get have one of several services which they have already paid for. Typically, their issue is related to their wireless network and one or more devices that they are unable to connect. Windows laptops and iPads are by far the most common, but we see the full array of computers, game consoles, mobile devices, and even some weird stuff on occasion. Familiarity with these will certainly help you out when you're working with them, but no, you do not have to already know how to use all of those.

We have very well-developed flow charts to guide you through the troubleshooting process for almost every issue. We don't do ""scripts"", but we do have bullet points that we like our technicians to hit. Things like making sure you mention how long you expect the process to take and then summarizing what you did at the end.

We also have a regularly updated wiki-based knowledge base with information on almost everything you'll need to know. Weird problems that are brought to our attention by our customers or the companies we work with are added here and made known to the entire project's staff via email.

We also have very, VERY populated text chat rooms that we use internally to communicate amongst the entire program, amongst your team, directly with peers, or directly with supervisors. Responses are usually instantaneous when help is requested, and it's not uncommon for discussions to get a little bit off topic when things are slow.

**HOW TO APPLY**
*****
If you are interested in this position, please make sure you follow the below steps **precisely**. I've verified with Human Resources that this is indeed how things need to be done, and deviation from these steps may result in a less-than-ideal outcome for either you, or me, or both of us.

1. Go to [this website](http://www.support.com/about/careers/openings) and select Remote Services Technician. It's the featured position.

2. During stage 1, when asked ""How did you hear about us?"" please select **Other** and then put down my legal name, **Nathaniel Young**. This will benefit both you and me, increasing the attention paid to your application and also potentially giving me a small bonus for finding you.

3. Proceed as normal through the resume section and other hiring info. There may or may not be a tech knowledge quiz involved. There was when I was hired, but I've heard that they are either thinking about doing away with it or already have.

**QUESTIONS?**
*****
Please ask! I am on reddit daily, oftentimes during slow periods of time at work. I will be checking this thread regularly and responding to questions as they come up.

	I was wondering if you guys could help my Dad get a job, because the circumstances he is currently in are baffling and unfair.

My Dad was a jewelry contractor and the owner of Metro Cardan LLC, and he had his own jewelry factory on West 46th street in Manhattan.

He eventually had to shut down his productions, nearly 10 years ago now, because all of his contracts stopped using him. The bigger contracts (such as David Yeurman, Tiffany, Frederrick Goldman etc.) outsourced all their labor and productions overseas.

With the jewelry industry dwindling within the states, and with only a handful of companies producing within the nation, my Dad’s career is becoming faint.

He had an excellent reputation within the industry, and the saddest part is that he is even overqualified for most jobs in the industry. However, modern day employment refuses to believe in most cases that experience supersedes education, and that all most companies care for is a diploma. **He has been in the industry since he was 18!**

He has bounced from a couple companies within the past years, all eventually laying him off.

Might I add that he has excellent managerial skills, as he ran an entire production factory practically single handedly!


I am doing this without him knowing, If any of you have a connection within the jewelry industry and could help get him a job, that would be fantastic!

Attached is his Resume with my personal phone number and email for those who can help =)

1367632096.0,60,self.forhire,1dnn0u,[For Hire] Need some help. Artist struggling to make rent after medical expenses. Pay me to make you some art!,66,6,19,http://www.reddit.com/r/forhire/comments/1dnn0u/for_hire_need_some_help_artist_struggling_to_make/,"Hello /r/forhire.

So I'm a freelance artist who has recently become a cliche of the ""starving artist.""  I normally don't do that bad, but a couple months ago I had to stay in the hospital because of some heart issues that came out of nowhere.  I'm better now, however because of my medical expenses I have been behind on bills pretty much constantly since then.

The bill I'm really worried about is paying my rent.  It was due on the 1st, but I spoke to the manager.  She said there is a 5 day grace period, but if I need a couple more days, she'll wave the late fee since I've never missed a payment before.  However, I'm having a terrible time finding enough work to catch up.  I'm about $600 short for my rent payment, and I need to get it within the next few days.

So, I thought I'd take a shot in the dark here and offer my art services to anyone who may be interested in commissioning some art work from me.  Here is a sample of some of my work:

[Art samples](http://imgur.com/a/9pF5M)

As you can see, I can work in a wide variety of styles, so I can do pretty much anything you might need.  Do you want me to do an illustration of your favorite comic book, video game or cartoon character?  Done.  Portrait of a friend or family member for a gift?  I can do that too.  Portraits of pets, whatever you want really.  I can do pretty much any kind of illustration you need done.  I can even do logos for your business, custom Facebook covers, photo retouching for old family photos, etc.

Primarily I work digitally, and then I would email you a high resolution file that you can have a nice high quality print done at your local printers.  It usually only costs about a dollar to get a high quality full color print on glossy card stock.

However, if you prefer to have me to take care of the high quality print and ship it to you, I can do that too for an extra small fee.  (Prices depending on where I'm shipping it to)

For these commissions, here is what I'm charging:

$50 - A black and white sketch.

$100 - A finished, black and white illustration.

$150 - A fully finished, full color illustration. (These tend to be the most popular for commissions.)

These are my discounted prices.  I usually charge a bit more, but I'm desperate to make rent.  I don't want to be sleeping in my car next week.  Haha.

If you need anything with detailed backgrounds, or multiple people in it, I usually charge a bit more for that since they take a bit longer to finish.  In that case just get in touch with me and we can figure something out for the pricing.  If you have any art jobs for me that don't really fit what's described above, please just let me know what it is and I can give you a quote.

I receive all payments through PayPal.  You don't need a PayPal account to pay, you can pay with credit/debit card, and since it's through PayPal it's all completely secure.

I take payments upfront and work on the commissions in the order that I receive payment.  (I no longer take payment after the work is finished, I've unfortunately been stiffed too many times).  Upon receiving payment, it usually takes only a day or two for me to finish unless of course I get lucky and have a lot of commissions heading my way.  In that case I'd make sure to let everyone know where they are in line and give them an estimate to when I'd finish there's, and of course I'd keep you updated throughout the process.

So, please, if you've ever wanted any kind of artwork done for any reason, let me know.  I can use some help from my fellow Redditors.  I'm not looking for handouts, I want to work for it, but I'm just a little desperate finding some work right now.

Anything - please help me out.",67,12,17,http://www.reddit.com/r/forhire/comments/q4taq/for_hire_urgently_need_to_make_100_or_so_tonight/,"Hello r/forhire,

I've posted in r/assistance before and did some work for a few people in the past. I have other redditors that can vouch for my work.

I really need to get some money together this evening, or suffer a terrible fate at the hands of an evil empire.

I'm willing to do a good amount of work on something for someone that can help me out - I just need the funds ASAP, as I'm in a tight spot. I'm actually in a spot where I can lose my vehicle if I don't come up with these funds. That would kill my family and I.

I basically need $100, but really $150 would be SO much better for us. I'll take what I can get. Anything right now would be better than nothing. :(

I've been developing software on and off of the web for 15+ years, and have some moderate graphics capabilities. While I wouldn't necessarily be the guy you'd want to design your pages using PhotoShop, I can certainly use PhotoShop to do some light-duty graphics.

I just need a few hours of work OR get started really well on something before you pay me this evening, give you what I got at that moment, and hand in what I finish as soon as it's done.

I have a resume on request regarding actual work. If you just want my resume, I'll pass, but if you have some work I could do that I could get paid on this evening, I'm on it. I'm just out of time, and need some help.

Unfortunately, I'm a corporate code-monkey by trade, so I really don't have an online portfolio to show off, but again, I can offer some trade refs if necessary, identification, whatever other proof you need.

If you need me to write a quick function to prove skill even... it's yours as long as it's not a hand-out. Not that I wouldn't help someone, I'm just really, really short on time. Right now it's 7:04EST - I need to be done really by 9:30pm, or at least get some cash in-house by then.

Can anyone help me out here?

I'm really desperate. I think that goes without saying at this point. :(

Thanks for reading reddit! :)

**EDIT**

Hey there reddit. It's 9:15pm. Was definitely hoping to have a solution by now. :(

If anyone has any work, please PM me, and I'll get right on it. For the moment, I'll leave my email/paypal up (no, I'm not asking for money up-front, don't be silly). If anyone has some work they can throw at me, please do.

Thanks folks for reading. :)

**I'll be frank, I need a job.** I have 8 years experience in advertising and video production, but in the last year, my industry has dried up almost completely. I have plans on going back to college to learn a new trade, maybe engineering, or maybe becoming a flight instructor. But for now I just need to do basically anything. 

I'm a smart guy, a pilot, 2nd lieutenant in the CT Civil Air Patrol, and have years of experience making television commercials for people all over the country. I'm also a martial arts and self defense expert. 

I'm also strong- 6'4"" 250, I am very healthy, and could probably lift 100 pounds over my head all day long without really being bothered by it. I'm willing to do any job that's out there, whether it's sitting at a desk all day, or working my tail off on the side of the highway. 

I know that people hiring aren't interested in desperate people looking for jobs, but I have tried almost everything except honesty during my job search, and now I just need to get busy. I don't care. 

I have a clean driving record and NO criminal history. I'm a good person, fun to be around, and a reliable human being you can count on to do whatever you need. Thanks for your time. Please PM me if you would be interested in hiring me!

Rhode Island is okay too.

Took him to lunch, looked at a project he was working on, etc.

The long-story-short is that he has been struggling to find work here and there for years now, and when he does, people are always late to pay him and he's constantly having to cut things out of his life to make up for their ineptitude. Sell X to cover Y, trade W to cover Z; always just to make it to the next time he finally gets cut a check.

I'm sick of it. I am a high-school drop out and I currently work in HVAC&amp;R controls and I make more than he does. This isn't right, and I can't just sit back anymore and watch him and my mom struggle.

My dad is a licensed General Contractor who has been building houses and whatnot for longer than I've been alive. On top of being a GC, he has a multitude of licensing for things like Lead testing, blower door testing, and a whole swath of shit that I couldn't even begin to list. He also has his class A for trucks, but he'd MUCH rather be building than driving trucks.

That's the thing about my dad...He can do anything, but he wants to do what he loves. He loves building things and he busts his fucking ass every day, rain or shine, sweltering heat or blowing snow. It doesn't matter. He's the guy who wakes up at 5 AM to snow-blow everyone's drive-ways before they have to leave for work, because it's the nice thing to do and he likes to keep busy. He's the hardest worker I know, and he knows his shit. When I was growing up, he watched ""This Old House"" to yell at the guy on the TV for the mistakes he was making while building things, or telling him how he could do it differently with a better outcome. It drove me crazy when I was a kid, but now I get that it was because he knew his shit.

When he builds houses, he doesn't just build a house hap-hazardly and call it ""done"" like a lot of GC's do; using the cheapest shit, cheapest labor, etc. He does everything right, to a T, all to code, everything. He doesn't build houses; he builds meticulous masterpieces that you can live in. Where one GC will build a house with a creaky floor board here and a leaking pipe there, he will not only *not* allow that to be called ""done"", but if it does happen, he'll come fix it at the owners request, because it's the right thing to do.

He's the nicest, funniest guy, the hardest worker, and one of the most knowledgeable people in his field. It destroys me that he has to fight every day just to fill his truck up, and that he's slowly had to sell off everything he's work for over my life just to be able to do so.

So I'm just throwing this out there. If you are, or know someone who has a well-paying job for a guy like my dad, throw me a line here, and I'll get you a resume. It doesn't matter where you are; my parents lost their house at the end of last year and they aren't anchored real tightly anymore. If you're in MN, ND, SC or FL though, that'd surely be a bonus to him.

I don't know what else to do. Thanks for listening. I hope someone out there has *something*.",,False,,t5_2qzbh,False,,,True,t3_1givr5,http://www.reddit.com/r/forhire/comments/1givr5/this_isnt_for_me_its_for_my_dadnationwide_general/,

I needed some basic changes made to an HTML/CSS/jQuery template that I bought for use as a personal website.  He make the changes very quickly (from getting in touch to everything being complete was less than 30 minutes - again these were small but necessary changes, I had spent a couple of hours trying to figure them out myself before looking for someone to do it for me) and he also sent me a screenshot to approve before saving the files and sending them to me.

His rates are very reasonable (I'm not going to say what he charged me since his rates probably vary depending on the complexity of the job, but I will say that they were less than I would have expected to pay for such quality work and if I need him for anything else in the future I'll offer him more than what I paid him this time, and still consider it reasonable, now that I know what to expect).  He's just starting out (and still in highschool) so now is probably a good time to hire this guy since his rates will only go up (and up...and up).  If you check out his website you'll see that he's not just doing copy/paste coding, he's created some really cool websites and definitely knows his stuff - a real self starter.

He has a website at [ankurk.com](http://ankurk.com) where you can get in touch with him. We did everything over Skype which made it all a very painless experience.

So that's it. I thought if anyone sees him offering his services on here were skeptical this might serve as a bit of a reference for Ankur. Feel free to look at my comment history and you'll see that I'm not some kind of shill, just someone who was really happy with the results of a /r/forhire experience and wanted to pass it on.

In Los Angeles.  Tons of people need jobs, and I'm not necessarily any more worthy or qualified than the next person, but I am desperate.

So, in exchange for your help finding me a job, I will offer something in return:  **I'll donate a percentage of my salary to the charity of your choice*.  For at least a year.**

I'm not even that picky.  My criteria are simply that it be at least a step above retail (I'm fine with office work or customer service), and that after all the money is given to charity, my take home is at least $15,000 (which is actually a little more than I'm living on now).

**Now for the important stuff: The percentage given to charity:**

* 5% Just for getting me a job
* 5% If it's in the film industry
* 5% If it's within 3 miles of me, 4% for 4 miles, 3% for 5 miles, etc. (La Cienega &amp; the 10)

This can easily turn into a couple grand going to charity.

^(*I retain veto rights if you suggest something like the KKK or NAMBLA.)

**About me:** I'm a smart, hard-working 28-year-old who's never been fired from a job.  I don't do drugs, if that matters to you.  The reason (I believe) that I'm having trouble finding a job is that I've been working freelance for 4 years and almost all of my references have expired.

Right now I make money as a freelance script reader/editor.  I love this, am very confident in my skills and would love to continue in this industry.  I've worked on film sets, helped out at production companies and done just about everything to scripts that you can.  However, I didn't go to school for it, so it's hard to get my foot in the door.

I also have a history in over-the-phone customer service and office work.  While I'm most passionate about film, I've done well working jobs like these.  As much as I love my freelance business, the fluctuations and dry spells are wearing thin, so a straightforward steady employment sounds really welcome right now.  I'm a quick learner and can adapt to about any job you guys can find for me.

I don't think Reddit is my personal army, or that this is the best way to get a job.  As I mentioned before, I'm desperate.  I've been applying for jobs daily for months now.  I've thrown myself out there in every way I can think of.  I'd have been schmoozing at GRMuD if I hadn't found work on Craigslist cleaning out some very creepy guy's garage for $50.  I make enough money to pay rent and eat, but I'm getting close to the breaking point.  I've got a bank account with less than $10, and due to some medical issues, my parents aren't a safety net.  I don't want to give up and leave this city, or the people that I love who live here.  Since I had this idea, I've held off on asking for your help for months, until it's finally hit the point that my ""worry"" side of the scale outweighs the ""look like an entitled ass"" side.

Writing samples for my script coverage, resumes, references, etc. are available on request.  Please ask me if you have any questions.  And since Los Angeles is all about headshots, [here I am] (http://i.imgur.com/mdtxJ.jpg), so you know you won't be hiring a terrifying internet stranger.  Beard is optional.

1. Agree as a community to downvote these posts. (forgot we don't have downvotes)
2. Make it a re-portable offense and have moderators remove them.
3. Add a new Tag [Freebie] or [HandOut] or [Trade] or even [Proposal].
4. Promote a different subreddit for this.

I've been struggling just to find odd jobs/online work/etc (even 10 cent jobs on Mechanical Turk!), *whatever* just to make ends meet. So... needless to say, there has not been a lot of extra money. *BUT* I worked my butt off, scrimped and saved, and in the last few months I managed to get a stove, fridge, AND a decent vehicle for the family. 

I knew that the finances were going to be tight for awhile, because of the car, and I thought that we would be ok even if we had to eat a lot of ramen and give up any extras for awhile, but then they found a mass in my neck during a routine MRI for something else, and last week I ended up having pretty major surgery with only about a week's notice. Then my (autistic) son accidentally set his closet, and all his clothes, on fire. In the meantime, I'm still waiting for post-op test results to find out if I have to have chemo or not. &amp;#3232;\_&amp;#3232; 

The bills are piling up and I am facing a disconnect on the water bill, not to mention the credit cards that are all over limit, empty gas tank, dwindling food supply, and the fact that my new and ongoing medical problems/appointments, as well as my children's, are NOT going to get any easier to deal with any time soon. My youngest son may have to go BACK down to Riley for testicular surgery (his 3rd), and both he and his twin sister just got orthotics (braces for their feet/legs), which they are SUPER excited about, but I can't even afford to buy them the special shoes they need to fit over the braces... and that's seriously not even the half of it. With everything going bonkers and Christmas coming up I REALLY need to find some work to do to help us stay afloat.

I'm at my wits end, and I don't have much left to sell, though I'm trying to throw together a last-minute garage sale before winter hits... it's not looking very hopeful at this point. =/

I'm looking for work of just about any kind, though I have a limited skill set... I can do a little of everything, but I'm no superhero at most of them, by any stretch of the imagination. My profile on Fiverr is [**here**](http://fiverr.com/mystic_koolaid) to give you an idea of the types of things I can do/am good at/was able to think of as acceptable options for a $4 payout. If anyone has any potential jobs available, wants to order one of my fiverr jobs, can help me think of other fiverr jobs (or otherwise) that might actually get ordered, or WHATEVER... please get ahold of me via comment, pm, or even through my fiverr profile.

Sorry for the long, hard to follow rant... it's been a really rough few weeks and I'm just struggling to maintain right now. 

TLDR; Single mom, family is in dire straits, please hire me to do *something*. I'd rather do small online jobs than stand on the corner with a cardboard sign!

My car broke down, lost my minimum wage job (through my own stupidity, I wont lie) and I broke my hand.  

I managed to receive 2 local jobs cooking, but since I broke my hand they both felt I would be a liability. I don't blame them, they were both locally owned and operated. If my injury became exacerbated by working there, I would hate to cause their insurance rates to go up.  

So, what can I do? Well, I can still type decently and noted the time at which I started typing this at the beginning and will do so again at the end. I can try to make you laugh or console you if you are feeling down, I have a phone with unlimited talk and text in the U.S. as well as many instant messengers. 

I will write you a story. Give me a noun or two to start with.  

I will try a poem or two as well although I find my own personal poetry lame for the most part.  

Basically, I am getting to my wits end. I have a cat. If I lost my apt. I will lose him.  

I do not like donations. I wont say no of course but would rather not. I am sure there is something I can do for you.  

I have above average English skill with writing and typing.  

I did a lot of acting in high school and have a webcam.

PM me if there is anything you want me to do. Please think of the kitten! (He is actually a six year old cat.) [8:28PM]  

EDIT: My WPM doesn't look too impressive with these times, but I also deleted a few things for clarity/redundancy.  

** EDIT:  Thanks to everyone who have helped me, I made it!! **  

My offer still stands too, so if any of you want me to do anything at for you, let me know! I feel my real life karma level is in the negative and I need to make up for it! Don't be shy, I will do anything in my power!

1305951454.0,44,self.forhire,hgg75,[Hiring] Looking for young folks wanting and willing to learn web development,48,4,42,http://www.reddit.com/r/forhire/comments/hgg75/hiring_looking_for_young_folks_wanting_and/,"The simple way of saying it: I'm looking to teach 1-3 people some of my skills in the world of web development in exchange for writing code for me.

I have a few projects up my sleeve that I don't really have time to sit down and code myself. I really enjoy teaching people and passing on my skills, so I came up with this bright idea, which I'm hoping will be beneficial for all of the parties involved.

Currently I'm an entrepreneur and a freelancer doing web applications for some big-name companies, and I'm making a pretty decent living. In the past I've mentored a couple of younger guys on the subjects of HTML, CSS, Javascript, and PHP on the back-end.

If you have free time on your hands, and you are interested in learning the basics of web development, I'll do my best to teach the best techniques I know, and in return, you'll be *learning* while you code for me.

I don't know if anyone has done this before, to me it seems like a carpenter who's taking an apprentice for a while to teach him the ins and outs of carpentry, so I hope people won't take this the wrong way...

As soon as you *graduate*, I'll also be able to employ you in full or part time doing web development, and as soon as my rates will seem to low for you (and they will rise with your experience) you will go to do whatever you want, no strings attached.

If you're interested, well, you know what to do...

------------

Skills that would be involved:

HTML (Old-and-new school, including HTML 5), CSS (and CSS 3), Javascript (jQuery is just tiny drop in the massive ocean that is Javascript), PHP (From spaghetti to full-fledged scalable apps), Photoshop (those designs won't cut themselves), HTTP and some basic networking protocols.

*Edit:* Some Source Control (SVN/GIT) will be learned also, essential for having hair after a couple of months coding for IE.

--------

To give you some idea on what people are paying for developers these days:

A junior (some experience) Web Developer (HTML/CSS/Javascript/PHP) will earn around $15-$25 per hour, a senior (4+ years of experience) developer will earn $25-$60 per hour, the gurus will get anything between $60 and $150 an hour.

-------

*Edit:* The buzz words are there for a reason, you may be familiar with some, others I'll teach along the way.

-------

*Edit:* Wow! I didn't expect people to be so enthusiastic about the idea, again, thanks for the warm words, I hope to reply to all of you who PM'ed me, but at the moment I'm afraid I'm going to stop taking on new *""students""*.

That being said, I'm expecting a few drop-outs along the way (no one particular, it's just that this field is not for everyone even if they are very enthusiastic at first), if that does happen I may or may not look for new people right away as I'm not expecting this to be extremely time consuming, so if you're interested, again, send me your email in a PM and I'll sure to contact you if and when that time comes.

If this works out as I plan, I promise I'll do it again latter on this year, so if you're interested send me your email address in a PM and I'll sure to let you know what's up with that.",,False,,t5_2qzbh,True,,,True,t3_hgg75,http://www.reddit.com/r/forhire/comments/hgg75/hiring_looking_for_young_folks_wanting_and/,

I wanted to share my perspectives on who I hire,  who I don't and why.   


1. Differentiate yourself -- for a hiring post that I recently did on reddit, many people responded to the ad with the minimum (ie. resume, cover, etc.)  A handful went and did a ""Hello World"" example link that I had posted and told me so.  Guess who I responded to. Remember, most people have little time and a lot of resumes.

2. Of the people that make it past the crowd, what next? I gave them other issues disguised as normal activities. I want to see how people respond to a problem. Why? This is how I rank the people who work for me:  


#- if you find a problem/issue and tell me, you are BELOW-average
#- if you find a problem/issue and have a solution, you are AVERAGE  
#- if you find a problem/issue, have a solution, and implement it, you are ABOVE-average  



Here's a real example: Of the people that differentiated themselves in their responses to me, I sent an NDA with no file extension. A few people came back and told me they couldn't open the file while others figured it out and sent it back.  Guess who I responded to.

It's tough, being rude, etc. but that's how the world works. Remember the people that are hiring have to look at hundreds of resumes. It's like looking at hundreds of reposts. Originality always gets you karma :)

This is definitely an odd post.... but basically my LDR bf and I are looking for a bluetooth controlled vibe that he can control with his phone while I wear it around and go about my day. We're looking for something similar to the [Vibease](https://www.google.ca/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=1&amp;cad=rja&amp;ved=0CDAQFjAA&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.vibease.com%2F&amp;ei=GSPKUKuULKWS2QXY4oHoCg&amp;usg=AFQjCNEvNnnuRn0H0atFGpXJC-4ZYso6og&amp;bvm=bv.1355272958,d.b2I) that we saw on [this post](http://www.reddit.com/r/BDSMcommunity/comments/13mxwh/are_there_any_good_remote_eg_usb_controllable_toys/), but that will go inside me. If anyone can build us one, please let me know! It also doesn't have to be controlled via bluetooth....as long as it can be controlled from a thousand miles away, we'd be content! 

I'm also not sure how much something like this would cost, how much time would potentially be needed, or anything like that, so if you could let me know what you would require as compensation or how much you'd charge as well, that would be fantastic. 

Thank you in advance!  



**Edit:** Hi everyone, it appears I wasn't very clear, as [TwistedTek](http://www.reddit.com/user/Twistedtek) wrote below, I'm looking for something that will allow the vibe to connect to my cell via Bluetooth (keeping it well within range) but will also allow for control of the device via an App or something similar to allow for longer distance. I have an android with unlimited data.... if that helps? 

**Tl;dr** I am looking to ""hack the Vibease into what would be a ""bullet"" or egg type"" vibrator. Thank you [Senacharim](http://www.reddit.com/user/Senacharim) for the clarification!

1343851828.0,48,self.forhire,xiv5e,"[Hiring] Two teaching positions at a private school in Tianjin, China",53,5,26,http://www.reddit.com/r/forhire/comments/xiv5e/hiring_two_teaching_positions_at_a_private_school/,"Hi all,

I do consulting and occasional teaching work for Fortune Education, a private school in Tianjin, China. We're expanding our classes this fall, and would like to hire at least 2 new teachers to work at our center and to possibly do some external work at an area middle/high school. 

Details:

* 8k RMB starting monthly salary (about $1200 USD) with a raise to 10K RMB ($1570) after 2-3 months (depends on performance)

* Housing provided, housing stipend available 

* Transportation stipend as required for work

* Health insurance

* Airfare to and from China (provided upfront, none of this ""you pay, we pay you back"" nonsense I've seen at other schools)

* Free vacation after completion of a 1 year contract

Requirements:

* Bachelor's degree (any discipline) and two years work experience (does not need to be related to teaching)

* At least 25 years of age (required for a Chinese work visa)

* Native speaker of English, with good speaking, writing, grammar, and spelling skills

* Valid passport with a couple empty pages (Chinese visas take up an entire page, sigh) and at least a year of validity remaining

* Be willing to undergo and finance a physical (including chest x-ray and EKG) as required for a Chinese work visa. Prices on this can vary. (We will reimburse you or pay the bill after you arrive in China, so this may not be an immediate out-of-pocket expense, but it depends on the policies of your medical provider)

* Pay for the work visa and consulate fees up-front (reimbursed after you arrive)

* Be willing to commit to a 1 year contract term

* **Most importantly:** Be interested in working with ESL students. Enjoy working with kids. Have a sense of adventure and adaptability. Be creative and enthusiastic. View unfamiliar surroundings as interesting and exciting.

I know from experience that getting a job in China can be sketchy, so we try to be very open about the experience and expectations with potential hires. I've been working with this company since 2008 and I've hired around a dozen other people for short and long term contracts. Most of them opted to renew their contracts after a year, and have been pretty happy with their employment. I think they'd probably be willing to answer questions about their experiences for anyone who has a serious interest. 

My experience has been pretty awesome. I had an opportunity to study Chinese, which gave me a leg up in university courses, and every day I spend over there seems to be a new adventure. The students are mostly in high school or pre-college, so they are lots of fun and already speak decent English. The starting salary, while not terrific by US standards (most of the non-Chinese employees, including me, are American) is more than enough to live on. With housing included it ends up being pretty easy to put away $1k USD a month in savings, and  the income is tax free in the US (the Chinese income taxes are factored into your salary). 

If this sounds like something you would be interested in pursuing, please pm me and we can go from there, or feel free to post questions in the comments.

I only gave Devon a short explanation of what I wanted but that was more than enough. Right from the initial mocks, each concept was right in line with what I wanted of my new logo. I picked one, and we refined it over a couple of iterations before it looked just like how I wanted.

What stood out for me throughout this interaction, is Devon's commitment to get things done on time. A ""couple of hours"" means just that.

I'm a software engineer for a major US company who is looking to fill a unique looking position:  Space Vehicle Controller Mission Operations Planner (imagine putting THAT on your resume!).  The position only requires a Bachelors in engineering, computer science, mathematics, physics or chemistry!

Sounds pretty cool, yeah?  The only hiccup I've found is that they won't start you until you've completed some paperwork to get a security clearance, which could take 4-6 months to process.

Anyway, reply here or msg me for more information.  I'll get you the info for applying as soon as I can (probably later this evening, if you're asking on the same day I posted this).  Also, full disclosure:  I might get a referral bonus if you get hired, but only if you list me as a reference when you make an account on the website - I'll give you the relevant information when you ask for more information.  What you do with that is up to you, but help me out for helping you out?  :)

I messaged the mods of /r/Favors, and they pointed me here. I have a unique situation.

I'm a very amateur sculptress, and I'd like to change that. I'm also struggling financially. I'd love nothing else than to get paid full time for my sculpting - but for now, I need more experience.

I'm offering to make a medium sized (about 5"" tall) sculpture of your choice for $100. If you would like something larger or smaller, I'm more than willing to talk about price vs. size / time. Materials do not matter, and I will pack and ship on my dime.

The unique situation - I would really like to have the money ASAP (which is why I tried to see if I could Trade in /r/favors). My bank account is in the hole because of an automatic CC payment, and I haven't been paid since then. Today they started tacking on the daily $15 extended overdraft fee that will continue until I pay them.

I work hourly and I work for family which means I get ZERO holiday pay; I'll get 20 hours on this next check. I'll have to figure out how I'm going to pay my $90 bank fee, put gas in my car, pay my phone bill, and there is this nasty habit of eating that I'm plagued with. I'll be able to squeeze by if I can get this bank account sorted out. I know how to be poor, I don't know how to be in debt.

But I do know how to sculpt! Human forms are tough for me (an anatomy class is in my future..) I prefer creatures, bugs, objects but of course I'm willing to try to make ANYTHING. I'd love to make a weapon of some sort, but I haven't quite figured out how to replicate a nice looking blade with polymer clay.

[Here is some of my completed work](http://imgur.com/a/G8frj#0)

I know it's not a lot, but it is all I have completed. I also make Christmas Statues for my whole family. Last year I made everyone 2011 Snowmen, and this year it was 2012 Penguins. I probably made 150 of each.

Other Current projects I have - 
* ""Realistic"" Enderman from Minecraft (this is where anatomy would come in handy, I've remade his arms about 3 or 4 times.)
* Cylon Centurion Bust from BSG (BY YOUR COMMAND)

Future projects I will be doing - 
* The Eragon Dragon (I forget the name - it is a gift for a friend)
* The Silence from Doctor Who (I'm excited to start this one! But I have other things to do first... including *your* sculpture!)

Even if I can't get the money in time, this is something I've been wanting to do for a while now. Money comes and goes - I'd really like to make things for people.

If you're not familiar with us, we print your images directly on glass, and create a final product that is picture, frame, and mount all-in-one.

Here's some stuff:

 * Looking for full-time positions, and want to hire ASAP
 * But we'd also consider an internship position for students with only a few hours a week to spare
 * Need people interested in being part of a company culture, not just grabbing a great paycheck
 * Attention to detail, and a knack for problem solving
 * No telecommuting or remote work. We're needy and we want to see your pretty (and/or handsome) face in our office every day. That means we'd be happy to relocate the right person(s)
 * Only interested in people capable of self-managing and who excel at taking initiative and constantly looking out for opportunities to improve themselves and the company
 * Located in Gainesville, FL (Thanks High_Priest!)

Positions/Roles:

 * **Make things look good** - designer, creative director, beautificator; I don't care what you call yourself, but you've got an eye for design, a love of adobe software, a knack for understanding what us non-creative folks are trying to describe (and the confidence to tell us when we're wrong), insane talent, and a desire to see your designs on the web, on packaging, and in offices/homes all over the world.
 * **Python/Php/Ruby** - developer. Maybe not all three, but at least some mastery of python or ruby. Be prepared to show us some code samples and/or a github page.
 * **Web Leader** - you know what separates a good website from a bad one, and you love leading a team of people to make that happen. Some ecommerce experience preferred, but not required. Also, looking for an understanding of UI/UX principals, and familiarity with mobile.
 * **Lover of Data** - some people call this a 'growth hacker', and some other people puke when they hear that term. What matters is that you feel at home in databases, analytics, and excel spreadsheets, and you love applying data to practical applications and digestible action items.
 * **Marketing/PR** - you're an excellent communicator, can't live without your daily dose of social media, and you love using technology to connect with people. You live, breathe, and bleed customer acquisition and retention. 
 * **Customer Service** - you're a natural born empath. Nothing makes you happier than brightening someone's day, and the idea of spending your days talking to people from all over the US excites you. You exude positivity, and are the best communicator you know.

Some perks:

 * Awesome startup with awesome people (mean age 25)
 * Awesome product that you get for free (featured on TechCrunch, BusinessWeek, Groupon, NBC Today Show)
 * Stock options 
 * Awesome office (we won a KILLER office redecoration from Turnstone - [video here](http://myturnstone.com/stories/makeover-fracture/))
 * Creative freedom; ownership of role
 * Wild, roaming packs of office dogs
 * Nap couch (for napping)

I dropped out of society last year and lived on the streets in Venice Beach and San Francisco, where I helped start a non-profit called The Instrument Library and attempted to make a documentary.  After realizing that no one cared about it and I'd have to fund it my own self, I took a job at a start-up company in the media industry in Manhattan.  It was swanky--the VPs all told me I would make millions with them if only I'd accompany them to Hong Kong and buy hookers and do cocaine.  Unfortunately, I dislike speedy things, paying for sex, and capitalism, so I got really down and ended up getting fired when I laid out of work for a week in protest of new bullshit organizational changes.  Basically, I have a hard time submitting to authority, especially when they're overgrown frat boys.

Then I went to live with my best friend and her family for a bit in PA, where I cooked magnificent meals for her parents every night while her mother was going through chemotherapy.  But then her brother and his girlfriend had to move in, and her mother got better, so I had to leave.

Now I'm staying with my parents in Georgia.  It's a pretty miserable experience, and I would probably off myself if I didn't have my ukulele.  I have to leave as soon as possible, as my dad is a Vietnam veteran with PTSD who likes to use the excuse of murdering countless ""gooks"" in order to threaten to kill me for being gay or taking the lord's name in vain.  My mother is bipolar, so sometimes she instigates it.  I have a midnight curfew, no money, and no car (although I'm selling this sweet rare 1915 Coca-Cola bottle for $300 soon--*crosses fingers*). No one around here will hire me because I'm overqualified or gay or don't go to church, and I failed the ridiculous subjective test for the Lionbridge Internet Assessors search rating telecommuting scam-job.

I had this great plan for starting my own non-profit website called e-busking.com, which would help support street musicians with electronic tipping, but it's not something I feel confident enough to do by myself, so I guess you could call it a pipe dream.

Basically I'm just looking for a way out of here before I lose my sanity.  I would hitchhike back to California or something, but it's getting cold, and I don't really like doing things like that by myself.

I don't really care what kind of work I get, as long as it's with cool people.  I really enjoy helping people, researching antiques, digging in the dirt, playing the ukulele and singing, writing, philosophizing, cooking, and traveling.  So if you have something you think I'd be a good fit for, please let me know.  I don't care about money, as long as I make enough to support myself and travel a little.  The only things I ever buy are cigarettes, the occasional joint, and food.

I am teetering on whether to stay in or not depending on my ability to find a job. 

My Goal: Get out of the Navy, get a job that challenges me and can support my family, and use the Montgomery G.I. Bill to attend college for Web Development/CIS. 

~~In looking at my civilian counterparts, it's amazing how poor of a work ethic many people have.~~ I have acquired a mindset in the military that would make me valuable to your company. 
So, why should you hire me?

**1)** Punctuality: I am conditioned to be on time. In the military, if you aren't early then you are late. 

**2)** Dedication: I work hard until the job is done. I'm no stranger to putting in an 18 hour workday, and I have worked up to 48 hours straight during high stress operations at sea.

**3)** Aptitude: My ability to learn is accelerated by my curiosity and drive to better myself. I acquire new skills daily and at a much faster rate than many other people.

**4)** Communication: I can translate advanced technical jargon into laymen's terms for clients, communicate with a team, and mitigate communication up and down the management hierarchy. 

**5)** Integrity: I have learned to always do what is right and not to take shortcuts. I am honest and have a quality work ethic. In the Navy, we live by the code - Honor, Courage, and Commitment.

I was not born deaf and I speak with proper enunciation. However, I am unable to hear via phone and unfortunately, that has reduced my employment opportunities considerably. I am a hard worker and would be a great asset to any company -- please give me a chance!

I have a B.S. in Computer Science and 2.5 years of professional experience with software development, but I have been programming since I was 8 years old -- it has been my hobby as well as my profession. I think I have a somewhat unusual set of skills and I'd like to put them to good use. I have been previously employed in both the game industry and the telecommunications industry.

I have experience using the following:

* C++, C#, Assembly (x86), Python, Perl, Java, VB6, ColdFusion, JavaScript
* Linux, Windows, Android, OpenWRT, FreeBSD, OpenBSD (I can perform most minor sysadmin tasks as well)
* IDA Pro (Reverse Engineering), Wireshark, OllyDbg
* STL, Win32, COM, ATL, DirectX, .NET/Mono
* SQL Server, SQLite, PostgreSQL, MySQL
* RF signal propagation (splat!)
* Google Maps APIs

I've used most debuggers, profilers, and version control systems (including Perforce) and I am familiar with how computers work at both the low and high levels. I can disassemble executables to patch opcodes with a hex editor, and I know how to write code injection libraries. 

I'm also a competent system integrator -- my last job had me create a complete Google Maps based web front-end for checking RF line of sight between possible locations. The actual programs ran on a dedicated server and returned both images and a PDF from the results. Before that, I worked on **Dungeons and Dragons Online** where I was responsible for making improvements to the new player experience (tutorial), hunting down both client and server bugs on Bugzilla, and creating a test harness to automate the most time consuming testing tasks to reduce the load on the software testers.

This is a bit of a repost; I posted similar job openings a couple months ago. For the sake of ease, I'm going to copypasta the details, as they have not changed. 

I work as a consultant for a couple of schools in northeastern China, specifically Fortune Education. They recently opened a new center and have a few positions they would like to fill ASAP. I had a great response last time I posted. 


Details:

8k RMB starting monthly salary (about $1200 USD) with a raise to 10K 
RMB ($1500) after 2-3 months (depends on performance and qualifications)

Housing provided, housing stipend available

Transportation stipend as required for work

Health insurance

Airfare to and from China (provided upfront, none of this ""you pay, we pay you back"" nonsense I've seen at other schools)

Free vacation after completion of a 1 year contract

Requirements:
Bachelor's degree (any discipline) and two years work experience (does not need to be related to teaching)

At least 25 years of age (Sadly, this is a provincial requirement for a work visa and we have not found a way to get around it. If you're a few months shy of 25, we're happy to consider you.)

Native speaker of English, with good speaking, writing, grammar, and spelling skills

Valid passport with a couple empty pages (Chinese visas take up an entire page, sigh) and at least a year of validity remaining

Be willing to undergo and finance a physical (including chest x-ray and EKG) as required for a Chinese work visa. Prices on this can vary. (We will reimburse you or pay the bill after you arrive in China, so this may not be an immediate out-of-pocket expense, but it depends on the policies of your medical provider)

Pay for the work visa and consulate fees up-front (reimbursed after you arrive)

Be willing to commit to a 1 year contract term

Most importantly: Be interested in working with ESL students. Enjoy working with kids. Have a sense of adventure and adaptability. Be creative and enthusiastic. View unfamiliar surroundings as interesting and exciting.

I know from experience that getting a job in China can be sketchy, so we try to be very open about the experience and expectations with potential hires. I've been working with this company since 2008 and I've hired around a dozen other people for short and long term contracts. Most of them opted to renew their contracts after a year, and have been pretty happy with their employment. I think they'd probably be willing to answer questions about their experiences for anyone who has a serious interest.

My experience has been pretty awesome. I had an opportunity to study Chinese, which gave me a leg up in university courses, and every day I spend over there seems to be a new adventure. The students are mostly in high school or pre-college, so they are lots of fun and already speak decent English. The starting salary, while not terrific by US standards (most of the non-Chinese employees, including me, are American) is more than enough to live on. With housing included it ends up being pretty easy to put away $1k USD a month in savings, and the income is tax free in the US (the Chinese income taxes are factored into your salary).

If this sounds like something you would be interested in pursuing, please pm me and we can go from there, or feel free to post questions in the comments.

I want to do what I love but most of the large scale outfits around will not use climbers and the smaller outfits that do tree surgery have a difficult time lining up a full week of work with any consistency. I am tall, fit, safety minded, have both a high school diploma and college degree, a hard worker, and have a flawless record for no injuries and no destruction of private or public property. I have climbed and taken down, well over, a thousand trees and am proud of my consistency, speed and ,most of all, safety. I want a job with a company that likes to stay busy and I'm willing to go just about anywhere to do what I love.

I was quite certain my money would be gone and that I would never hear from him again. To my surprise he came online and responded to my IMs. We spoke for a bit and he thankfully **DID SEND MY MONEY BACK!!!** 

I respect this user a whole lot more now for owning up to his mistake and correcting the problem. Heck, I might even consider hiring him again. 

My read on this user is that he is a good kid and wants to be hired and do work for people. However, I think he has a bad habit of taking on jobs that might be beyond his capabilities. I may be completely wrong, but I just think he is a bit timid about telling a potential client that he can't figure something out. 

The biggest thing that makes a community like this thrive (especially with no escrow or rating system built in) is COMMUNICATION. And unfortunately during our work together we did not have great communication about the status of my project.

Anyway, I just wanted to report to the community that this user did indeed pay, and own up to his mistake. So I think he should be considered again when applying for jobs on /forhire. Milestone payments would work best with this user as it would keep him motivated to finish. But if he can't do the task he just shouldn't apply.

1337124397.0,34,self.forhire,tp1fw,A new subreddit for requesting and offering skills and projects,43,9,9,http://www.reddit.com/r/forhire/comments/tp1fw/a_new_subreddit_for_requesting_and_offering/,"I've been trying to come up with a theme for a place where one could offer skills and request work very similarly to how r/forhire operates - a mishmash of providers and consumers that works in a very interesting way. I'm not going to elaborate on my observations and conclusions, suffice to say I love this place, and I feel like it's one of the most important communities in reddit.

That being said I've created [r/icando](/r/icando) as an experiment on publishing detailed work requests and offering specific skills *with the price tag visible to all*.

One of the things that are something of a divider in r/forhire's community is the debate about cheap labor and how cheap is cheap, while [r/icando](/r/icando) is not for cheap projects per se, but it does encourages users to state their financial compensation (or otherwise) up front - if I'm looking for a new profile website for $600 dollars or less - I know exactly what I'm willing to pay, and I know pretty well what I want.

The fact that the price is displayed upfront I hope will bring the best quality of work to the best price possible - because I as a web developer that usually takes between $70 and $100 per hour might see an interesting offer to build something that will take me 2 hours, and I will be paid for it $600, while the same task can take two days for other developers.

-----

Like in r/forhire the subreddit will have *offers* and *reuqests*.

*Offers* are created by developers, designers, film makers, artists, car washers, *Doers*, offering their *product* or *service* to the subreddit - the posts should include **[Offer]**/**[For hire]** in the title with a clear and understandable skill/product offer, and the post body should contain as detailed as possible description of the offer and *how much it costs*, it can be hourly/daily/weekly wage ($30 per hour, $1,200 per month), items-based pricing (3 pages = $100), or any other payment method you chose. The important thing is that you describe **all of the costs** up front, don't hide fees and such. If you full or partial payment upfront - state so.

*Requests* are created by those who need something done - web pages, custom painting, app design - *Needers*. These follow similar guidelines with **[Request]**/**[Hiring]** in the title with a clear objective and urgency (if needed). The post body should have as much information as possible for the *doer* to get a good idea of the scope of the work you need [without disclosing what it is that you don't want disclosing...] and a clear target payment, which can be one or more exact amounts you are willing to pay for the thing you need. For example I could request a new web site portfolio and I want to pay $200 for it, but I can go as high as $400 depending on the circumstances and the offered quality/finish. Some redditors will chose to offer to do the job for the $200, other swill offer for $300 and $400. Or so I hope.

The idea is to create a sort of r/forhire where everything is very clear from the get go, and the financial question gets out of the way, everybody knows what they want and how much they want for it. I hope that both big and small projects will flourish in [r/icando](/r/icando), and even micro projects [for example: I need a custom designed wallpaper and I'm willing to pay $5 for it].

I hope that in a distant future the subreddit will become a small repository for offered jobs and skills, where it's easy to find a designer for your next project, or get a quick job on the weekend when you're late on bills.

I came up with a pretty piss-poor design on my own using some little $30 logo creator software, but it wouldn't export anything of any quality for a print shop to use. I contacted a few local graphics companies and was subjected to their B-team, at best. I was getting pretty frustrated; it's been near a month and I just have a temp sign on my storefront, with no solution in sight.

Enter /r/forhire, and a logo design post by a Redditor named 'meteors'. Decided to give him and forhire a chance, and I do not regret it. This guy is top-notch in both talent and professionalism. I got the finished version of my logo today. I was able to get it tweaked until it was just perfect, and it looks awesome.

I am trying to save money for the trip, but I really really want a Kindle. I've wanted one for a while, and obviously it would be perfect for the plane ride over to pass the time.

So, my proposition is this: I design and build you a quick but very professional one-page site for your business/hobby/whatever, you pay me $139 and I get the 3G jobby with the special offers. OR, you get a 2 page site, and you pay me $189 so I can get the ad free one like a civilized human being. I can even hook this puppy up so you can make your own updates to it.

This is a one time chance to get a decently designed web site for a very reasonable price. This is way lower than most developers (including me) would charge, but again, this is a **one time deal**, so fellow developers, *please* don't think I'm trying to undercut anyone or lower the value of our profession.

I have nothing but good things to say about him. Not only was the project done extremely quickly, but he was extremely accommodating to anything I requested.

Perhaps the best thing was that he was understanding of my minimal knowledge in building a website. He took the time to confirm what i wanted and discussed what would/wouldn't work.

1321915748.0,30,self.forhire,mkp7r,WIRED is hiring editorial fellows in San Francisco,37,7,10,http://www.reddit.com/r/forhire/comments/mkp7r/wired_is_hiring_editorial_fellows_in_san_francisco/,"NOW ACCEPTING APPLICATIONS: WIRED MAGAZINE/EDITORIAL/SAN FRANCISCO
WIRED magazine seeks four editorial fellows for its San Francisco office. The full-time fellowships will run from January 3, 2012 to June 29, 2012 and focus on the Play section, gadgets research, fact-checking, and the Start section. All four positions involve working closely with senior editors. We do not offer summer internships, and since our fellowships are full-time, they are not appropriate for matriculated students.

Applicants must be pursuing journalism as a career and have experience working in a deadline-oriented environment. You should also be enthusiastic, highly organized, and have a demonstrable interest in technology. A passion for great reporting and writing is essential.

Because these fellowships are full-time, they are not appropriate for matriculated undergraduate or graduate students. We do not offer summer internships.

WIRED PLAY EDITORIAL FELLOW
This position is best suited to a college graduate with entry-level reporting and writing experience in the field of journalism. Responsibilities include pitching ideas to Play section editors and assisting them with research and special projects. Geek-savvy pop culture knowledge is a must; the ideal candidate has a favorite band that we’ve never heard of, a favorite comic book that we’ve never read, and a long rant on why Ender’s Game was better than the Harry Potter books (or vice versa). The job also involves fielding email, mail, faxes, and phone submissions received by the editorial department as well as mailing issues to authors. Facility with multimedia and podcasting equipment, especially ProTools and GarageBand, are a plus.

WIRED REVIEWS EDITORIAL FELLOW 
This position is best suited to a college graduate with entry-level reporting and writing experience plus a strong interest in consumer electronics, design, and technology. Responsibilities include reviewing products and assisting with editorial production for both WIRED magazine and Wired.com. Interns also assist with research for features and packages. This is a great opportunity for bylined writing as well as for getting your hands on the latest tech before everyone else does. There are light clerical duties as well, such as responding to story and product pitches and ordering products for review.

WIRED RESEARCH EDITORIAL FELLOW
This position is for someone with great reporting skills and a supreme attention to detail — ideally a college graduate with prior fact-checking or professional reporting experience. The primary duty is checking the accuracy of magazine content. In this capacity, the research intern works closely with senior editors, copy editors, designers, photo editors, and writers, primarily on the magazine’s Play section, so an affinity for geeky pop culture is a must. Other responsibilities include Nexis searches and some administrative duties.

WIRED START EDITORIAL FELLOW 
This position is best suited to a college graduate with journalism experience; preferably reporting and writing experience about science, technology, and business. Humor writing experience also a plus. The ideal candidate is creative, curious, eager, and interested in news and technology. Responsibilities include pitching story ideas to Start section editors, writing items, and assisting editors with research and special projects. The reporting intern is involved in idea generation for recurring Start items such as Q&amp;A, Alpha Geek, Best lists, Datastreams, etc. There are administrative duties as well, such as mailing, updating databases, and preparing for section meetings. Experience with Garage Band/ProTools, video editing, and podcasting preferred, but not necessary.

The pay: $12 per hour. The hours: 9 am to 5 pm, Monday through Friday.

To apply: Send a cover letter, resume, and links to three clips within the body of an email message to internships@wiredmag.com. DO NOT SEND EMAIL ATTACHMENTS – WE WON’T READ THEM IF YOU DO. Please put your name and which internship you’re applying for in the subject line of the email. You may only apply for one position; however, you will be considered for others as we deem appropriate.

Applications are due Wednesday, November 23, 2011. Absolutely no phone calls, please.

+ I studied Creative Writing at Whittier College.
+ I've had 5 of my theatrical plays staged in productions.
+ I currently work as a freelance writer. You can find some examples of my creative writing work at [Tractor Beam Tuesdays](http://tractorbeamtuesdays.tumblr.com/) and you can find examples of my gaming content writing on my game design analysis blog [Roll To Not Die.](http://rolltonotdie.com/)

I'm looking for any writing job you are offering.

If you have a writing job for your game in development, I'm **extremely** interested so let's get in touch. I'm also an aspiring game designer, which you may or may not find useful in your project based on your needs.

He is /u/jeremywick from wickvideo.com. I strongly suggest you hire him if you are looking for good quality, professional work with a speedy turn around time.

As soon as I hired him he immediately went to work writing a script which he allowed me to make revisions to. Then we moved on to the story board where I again gave my input and he made the changes. He then sent over samples of the voice over guy which I approved and also did the music for the video in house. 

I think he originally quoted a 2 week turn-around time for the video but he ended up delivering it to me in just 6 days! And that includes the weekend not just business days. 

I was extremely satisfied and had an awesome experience. And it's great to know that there are a lot of awesome people that are available for hire here.

So now we’ve got a long list of customers waiting for us to deliver and a pile of investors breathing down our necks, ready to slap us around if we don’t.

We may have gotten a little sauced one night (read: week) and now have some brilliant ideas in the queue.

We just gotta build ‘em, market test ‘em and rebuild ‘em a few more times. Our current dev team is a little under-staffed and over-intoxicated so we want some fresh blood. Your blood. (BLOOD!)

We’re not looking for anything specific beyond ‘developer’, so you tell us why we want you. Love PHP? Awesome, we use that. Rather spend your days tweaking jQuery until every animation makes your pants wet? Cool, bro. Even if you’re one of those freaks who gets aroused at a 0.2ms database query-time reduction, we wanna talk to you.

Perks include cool work, beer in the fridge and unlimited free hugs from a handsome Mexican.

We’ll also pay you and stuff so you can buy food and whatnot.

If you’d like to apply, get out your resume, throw it away, and talk to us like we’re human. Send us something cool you made or a long rant on how terrible the app stores are right now and how, if you were in charge, everything would be better.

Of all the work I've ever done - the easiest by far was the work that was well defined. I mean descriptions, pictures, inputs and outputs defined well, etc. Most work is ""easy"" if we know what we're trying to accomplish. Some jobs take more hours than others, but the really hard ones are the jobs where we feel like we're playing pin the tail on the donkey in the dark.

You have to look at it from the perspective of the freelancer...being dropped into a new system to do a small job is sort of like drinking all night, getting hit in the head with a baseball bat, then dropped from a helicopter in the middle of the jungle being told ""now find your way back"". We do it (most of the time) but it's tough.

With that said - even for truly easy jobs, posting a job and calling it easy is sort of like how we used to say in the old days ""don't post a question to a forum and call it simple - nobody wants to answer a simple question"".

And I've got a varied resume to boot -- everything from helpdesk monkey to graphic designer to ESL teacher to my current job as a proposal writer/social media maven/event organizer/in-house designer/content management system expert. It's a decent gig, but for one minor issue. It's in Minnesota, and I'm moving to the Bay Area anytime between now-ish (assuming I get an offer) and May 31.

In short, I'm something of a geeky creative.

Though I best thrive in positions that let me utilize both sides of my brain, I'm not opposed to roles like office manager/customer service, particularly in environments where creativity and innovation are valued. For that reason, I'm especially interested in roles in the tech industry (start-up or otherwise), but I'm not opposed to other industries either. Anything is good by me really, provided it's approximately full time and has benefits. 

Right now is probably a good time to mention that while freelance/contract work is normally welcomed and loved, I'm putting all my energy into finding a FT gig in another state, so I don't have much time for freelancing now. Unless like, you're going to slide a nice fat author advance check at me to write and illustrate a whimsical childrens' book about octohogs and lobstersquirrels. Because in that case, I'm all yours.

I am a burden to my friends and family, and it's a terrible feeling.

I have two gross misdemeanors, 4th degree assault, which in Washington you can get for spitting on somebody's shoes, if they had the ass to press charges. I got it because, when I was 15 and in high school, I got in a fight with a kid, he pulled a knife (It was a bad school), and I broke his arm in self-defense. I didn't get in trouble then, but he was sent to juvenile detention and got expelled. Somehow, 5 years later (2009), he was able to press assault charges because he wasn't able to use his arm properly as a result of me breaking it. All the paperwork that the school had on hand was ""lost"", and all the teachers who were present at the time had transferred out of district or, in two cases, had died. I had no defense and was forced to take an Alford plea.

I wouldn't bring that up if it hadn't been screwing me over in my job hunting, which last week it did. Apparently Walmart has no problem employing former drug dealers and other felons, but 4th degree gross misdemeanor assault is a no-go.

I specialize in tech support, fixing computers, data recovery, etc. I've been doing that independently for 7 years and I am quite good at it.

1310610188.0,30,self.forhire,ip1jw,tips for getting hired (i'm a geek who hires geeks),44,14,44,http://www.reddit.com/r/forhire/comments/ip1jw/tips_for_getting_hired_im_a_geek_who_hires_geeks/,"i'm director of engineering at a pretty big web company.  i get to see a lot of resumes.  i don't have a lot of time to read all 3+ pages of your resume.  most of the time, i gloss them over looking for keywords, and that's after some secretary has looked at it and a computer has filtered it.  so here are a few tips to make both of our lives easier.

1) objectives / personal statements are a waste of space.  you're not a fucking CEO and you have no idea what real objectives are.  when writing about your experience, don't even use complete sentences.  ""Engineered &amp; implemented custom CMS.  Linux/Apache/MySQL/PHP/Jquery"".  that's all.  i don't need a paragraph.  for every single word on your resume, ask yourself ""does this make the hiring associate like me more?""  if not, get rid of it.

2) get to your projects quicker and focus on YOUR contributions to each project.  if you did a lot of projects at a single company, list each project as it's own line, and then list the stack/languages/frameworks you used.  do not say ""LAMP"" only, because while I know what LAMP is, there's always some hiring fucktard who doesn't.  if the job listing says LAMP, say ""Linux/Apache/MySQL PHP (LAMP)"" at least once.  that gets you by filters.  INCLUDE LINKS IF POSSIBLE.  if you do backend work, set up a dummy section on one of your own sites.  dummy systems tell me a lot (that you know how to go out of your way to demonstrate competence).

3)   **this is probably one of the most important things on your resume: STATS GET YOU HIRED**... db size, traffic, active user count, bounce rate, conversions, signup rate, open rate, CPM, CPC, CPA.  ""Increased newsletter signup rate from 1% to 1.5% for 100k visit/month site"" means a lot.  it often doesn't even matter what those numbers are.  anyone who does business instantly knows the value of your work ***AND that you know what is important***.  i'm willing to pay you 20x what i'd pay an asian because you're supposed to know more than just how to type in some text editor.

4) if you're a US citizen, say so, especially for entry/junior level jobs (just put it in the corner ""US Citizen"").  candidates who are not US citizens usually need a visa sponsored by the company.  in most cases, that substantially increases the cost to hire and retain the non-citizen (or at least for companies like ours that actually comply with immigration laws).  that means in many cases, even if you're slightly shittier than a foreigner, i'll hire you.  it's not even salaries.  no one has to pay a fucking lawyer.  we don't have risk in the H1-B lottery.  it's just better all around.  a lot of the time, i'm stuck guessing by your name and universities.  don't make me guess.

* I had a paper route when I was a wee lad.

All I want is a chance to prove myself again. I was let go from my previous job because I was unable to meet production quotas. I accept that this was my sole responsibility; **but** there is a compelling (IMO) reason why.

The last six months with my prior employer saw warehouse capacity above 94%. Anytime capacity rises above 89%, there will be significant problems finding slots in warehouse racking for full pallets of freight. The majority of the loads I saw while putting freight to the racks were full pallets measuring 2m long x 1m wide x 1.5m high that weighed between 300-500kg.

My coworkers were afraid to take these pallets because they knew that it would be a fight to find a slot to put them away to. I didn't care; if the freight needed to go I took it, quotas be damned. 

I had also asked questions about how the plant's computers manged inventory, and through tria and error I figured out how to move freight around both physically in the warehouse and also move it in the system so that the computer knew where the freight was, along with the accurate quantity.

**TL; DR:** Older, sharp, blue-collar guy with a strong skill set needs a job to support his family and start rebuilding his sense of self-worth.

Thank you for your attention.

It's really discouraging, as an unemployed college student in a struggling labor market, to put in so much effort on these applications only to be left second guessing my qualifications and collegiate achievements. I show you the respect of searching through countless job listings and drafting up individual resumes and cover letters, and you can't even do a simple task of saying no?

I know that I'm in no position to say this, but please, for the sake of my sanity and for that of many in my position, take the time to just respond. I honestly don't care that it's a rejection.

I've posted job openings on here a couple times before [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/forhire/comments/xiv5e/hiring_two_teaching_positions_at_a_private_school/) and [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/forhire/comments/18j72v/hiring_teaching_positions_in_beijing_and_tianjin/), and the response has been pretty great. I've got another round of hiring going on right now, with two positions in Beijing and three or four in Tianjin. The details are largely the same as last time:

8k RMB starting monthly salary (about $1200 USD) with a raise to 10K RMB ($1500) after 2-3 months (depends on performance and qualifications)

Housing provided, housing stipend available

Transportation stipend as required for work

Health insurance

Airfare to and from China (provided upfront, none of this ""you pay, we pay you back"" nonsense I've seen at other schools)

Free vacation after completion of a 1 year contract


Requirements: Bachelor's degree (any discipline) and two years work experience (does not need to be related to teaching)

At least 25 years of age (Sadly, this is a provincial requirement for a work visa and we have not found a way to get around it. If you're a few months shy of 25, we're happy to consider you.) There is no age minimum for the positions in Beijing.

Native speaker of English, with good speaking, writing, grammar, and spelling skills

Valid passport with a couple empty pages (Chinese visas take up an entire page, sigh) and at least a year of validity remaining

Be willing to undergo and finance a physical (including chest x-ray and EKG) as required for a Chinese work visa. Prices on this can vary. (We will reimburse you or pay the bill after you arrive in China, so this may not be an immediate out-of-pocket expense, but it depends on the policies of your medical provider)

Pay for the work visa and consulate fees up-front (reimbursed after you arrive)

Be willing to commit to a 1 year contract term

Most importantly: Be interested in working with ESL students. Enjoy working with kids. Have a sense of adventure and adaptability. Be creative and enthusiastic. View unfamiliar surroundings as interesting and exciting.

I know from experience that getting a job in China can be sketchy, so we try to be very open about the experience and expectations with potential hires. I've been working with this company since 2008 and I've hired around a dozen other people for short and long term contracts. Most of them opted to renew their contracts after a year, and have been pretty happy with their employment. I think they'd probably be willing to answer questions about their experiences for anyone who has a serious interest.

My experience has been pretty awesome. I had an opportunity to study Chinese, which gave me a leg up in university courses, and every day I spend over there seems to be a new adventure. The students are mostly in high school or pre-college, so they are lots of fun and already speak decent English. The starting salary, while not terrific by US standards (most of the non-Chinese employees, including me, are American) is more than enough to live on. With housing included it ends up being pretty easy to put away $1k USD a month in savings, and the income is tax free in the US (the Chinese income taxes are factored into your salary).

If this sounds like something you would be interested in pursuing, please pm me and we can go from there, or feel free to post questions in the comments.

I'm relocating to D.C. due to a great opportunity for my wife.  I've been with my current employer for nearly 6 years.  In that time I've earned my MBA part-time -- specializing in strategy and pricing -- and have been involved in numerous internal ""high-potential"" programs.  I have attempted to craft (expand) my role over the years from what was once traditionally a pure finance role to one that is involved in product strategy, development, and a little marketing.  I have experience doing competitive marketplace analysis, complex financial modeling, developing strategic pricing models, and presenting to senior management on a regular basis.  I also have have a few years of computer science under my belt (before I switched to economics), so I'm not scared of the technical side of the business.

The best part of my current job is working with product management and acting as if the product line is my own small business.  I figured I would use this relocation as an opportunity to try and move into product/brand management or something similarly strategic in nature.  I currently work in telecom, but my preferred industry would be something tech/software/gaming/web-based.

We're looking for several writers to produce product descriptions and general articles. This is a regular paying freelance gig. This is not a full-time employment. 

A little about us- Nerdy With Children is the premiere site for alternative parents who want their children to inherit the same awesomely nerdy ways. Our goal is to feature cool products, publish nerd-worthy stories and advice, and create a community where like-minded parents can interact to share thoughts, ideas, and experiences with one another.

Product Descriptions: We specifically need someone who can write product descriptions for parents who have kids between the ages of fertilization to 12 years old in our rocker and/or sci-fi&amp;fantasy category. We provide the products, (but we're open to suggestions) you give us an awesome, witty description of at least 200 words. Check out our site for examples. 

Articles: We need a couple people who can write at least 500 words that involve some kind of geeky, nerdy subject directed at parents whose kids are between the ages of fertilization to 12 years old. We work with you on story ideas. We really like people who have lots of ideas. 


**Requirements:** 
Expert in proper grammar/spelling/punctuation/. Experienced with AP Style a plus.
Your writing style needs to be witty, extra ""nerdy"", entertaining. You must have a thorough knowledge of the category you write in. No squares allowed in the Rocker category. 
Knowledge of Google Drive, formerly Google Docs. 
Have been a kid at some point in your life. Possessing kids is certainly a plus, but not mandatory. Please do not kidnap a child. 
Have or have the ability to accept Paypal. 


**How to apply?** Use our trusty [contact form](http://nerdywithchildren.com/contact).

Please send us links to your resume (we'll reply if you need to attach it) and writing samples. Feel free to include links to parenting blogs that you like or other nerdy sites. 
If you send us a generic email it will be deleted. Impress us with your vast knowledge. Ex. You want to write in Rocker? List your favorite bands/songs/genres. You have some ideas for articles? Then let us know. Take the time to look at our current [articles](http://nerdywithchildren.com/articles).

Mods: I didn't know where to post this, people in /r/assistance have way bigger problems than I, so if this is the wrong place please move it. I coudn't find another reddit more fitting.

Okay reddit, I have a problem and I'm asking for some help, but I'm not asking for a handout. What I am asking is to perform a service in return for a donation to my cause and hopefully the results will be epic, so bear with me for a minute.

The situation: 

In an attempt to live a life less ordinary I've planned an epic journey to spend Dec. 21, 2012 at the Mayan temple complex of Tikal, the birthplace of Mayan astronomy. Yes, I know it's not the end of the world, it's a celebration of a new beginning and a new era, the 14th B'aktun of the Long Count Calendar and it's a major celebration in the Mayan culture. I try to live the life of adventure as much as possible and travel when I can, but I've not left the US since I was 5 and I don't even really remember that trip.

The problem:

Where the trouble comes in is that I have failed to raise the money for the trip. I live on the road on the Renaissance Faire circuit and the depressed economy is killing my sales so I've just made enough to live on, not enough to travel on. It's only eight days away from my target date to leave and I'm desperately seeking some aid.

The proposal:

I am offering my service to anyone who will help me achieve this dream of mine. In exchange for a donation I will perform any task you appoint me and provide proof of accomplishing the task, as long as it's legal. For a small donation I will perform one task and provide a picture proving I did it. For a larger donation I will provide pics and video of a more complex or lengthy task. Make a generous donation and your wish is my
 command! (Oh, man. This is opening a can of worms!)

I submit myself to your will, the reddit community will dictate the terms of this arrangement. The most upvoted posts that set the parameters of this arrangement will be the rule and law.

My target to successfully reach is $1500.00, of which half is airfare. 

I'll be couch surfing and camping during this trip so lodging is not an issue. Just food and travel money.

The details: 

If this works out and I make it there my itinerary will be thus:
12/15/12 Arrive in Guatemala city
12/16/12 GC
12/17/12 GC
12/18/12 Lanquin in the highlands
12/19/12 Lanquin caves/Semuc Champey waterfalls/Grutas Las Marias
12/20/12 Tikal
12/21/12 Tikal and Volcan Pacayan
12/22/12 Antiqua
12/23/12 Return to the US

I will happily perform any task in any of these places, locations on route, or anyplace nearby that I can get to by conventional means.

Do you need a love letter to an old flame or a note to your grandma hand-delivered in the region?
Do you want a picture of me with a shoe on my head at Tikal?
Does your Uncle need a couch moved?
Want to watch a video of a guy almost break his neck in an Ostrich rodeo?
Just want to live vicariously through a random person? 

I'm your man.

I'll take donations via paypal, or something else if the community prefers it. It's up to you guys. I will return all money donated to me if I don't reach my goal. As I said, I don't want handouts, I want an adventure. Whatever proof or verification of identity you guys demand, I will provide. This is not a throwaway, this is my real account. I'll also provide FB details, email, whatever you think you need.

I'll check in on this post every 1-2 hours as long as my connection holds out. I'm on faire site and the wifi here is very spotty, so if I don't respond for a bit I'll get back as soon as I can.

I leave my fate in your hands, reddit. If you think this is all a terrible idea and I'm a jackass for asking, then it's in your power to down vote this into oblivion.

Help me Obi-wan Kenobi, you're my only hope!

TL/DR: Help me get to Tikal on Dec. 21, 2012 and I will do any task you give me.

1354663542.0,29,self.forhire,14af9v,HR specialists--a few questions about cover letters.,32,3,19,http://www.reddit.com/r/forhire/comments/14af9v/hr_specialistsa_few_questions_about_cover_letters/,"Hello,

First and foremost, thank you for taking your time to read this, and double thanks for replying. 

So I have been (unsuccessfully) writing cover letters for far too long. I'd like to ask you what HR specialists look for in cover letters. For example, in regards to tone, do you prefer cover letters that talk about one's accomplishments/experience in a personal or impersonal manner? To be more clear, is it better to come across as as a reliable worker bee, or is it better to come across as more personable. What I am trying to get it is, should I describe myself in terms of ""I did x, then I did y, my responsibilities included z, and I am proficient in xyz"", or is it better to make it more of a narrative; ""I did X because of y which led me to learn z."" I'm never sure how personal a cover letter should get. Obviously not too personal, but I find it hard to get the balance between worker bee and individual and I'm not sure which of those two is actually desirable. 

Also, what are your thoughts on the word ""I"". I find it difficult to write about myself without showering my cover letter in ""I, me, and my"". Is this standard, or am I simply bad at writing these things?

How aggressive/assertive should I be? Should I tell potential employers that ""I know I'll be a good fit"", or that ""I believe I'll be a good fit"". Alternatively, ""you should hire me because..."" or ""I believe I can be a valuable asset because..."" Again, this is a balance I'm finding hard to strike since I don't know if I should come at it with a sort of cocky attitude or if I should be humble.

Should my cover letter reflect my CV, or should my cover letter be an addition to my CV? For example, should I use my cover letter to describe the accomplishments listed in my CV, or should I use my cover letter to talk about things that are not in my CV? 

I've been told that in writing a cover letter I should try and tell the employer what I can offer their company/organization/etc., but I also find this hard to do since I feel like I am sort of boxing myself in with that. What are your suggestions?        

In closing, what are some standout cover letters you have read? What made them good? What made them stand out? On the flip side, what are some of the worst cover letters you have read? What made them bad? What could they have done better? 

Thanks again for taking your time here, I really do appreciate your input :-D

See, the catch is that these websites require you to pay a significant amount of money up front (this one asks for 85 Canadian dollars), and they all say it's refundable, but I see a big catch in the refunding process: They say it's only refundable within ten days of deposit, and that the job offers might look on your resume within two to three months. Which means more likely than not, you'll get a yes or no answer in the end of that timeline.

What do you think, is this and other similar sites trustworthy, or are they just a scam to fish money out of CV givers looking for jobs?

hoping to get some feedback from the /r/forhire community and see how we can improve things.

in january we had a few hundred subscribers and were doing ~2k pageviews/month.  ending february we're at nearly 2,300 subscribers and pushing 50k PVs/month. huge growth. 

so.. questions:

1) **is the subreddit working?** i'd love to hear success/horror stories.  have you actually found any work here? have you hired someone? how did it work out?

2) **what can we do better?** should we change the formatting for posts? require more/less info? 

3) **do you think we need more moderators?** it's myself and pyro2927 right now, and it's pretty under control, but i'm thinking more mods might help us spread the word a little better.

4) **anything else?**

I am Dave Stiles, and I just recently moved into the Houston Texas area. I am looking for work down here and saw that reddit might help.
I have an Associates degree in ACT focusing on Green Design. I got my degree from Baker College in Muskegon Michigan. When I was at Baker College there were no programs for green design. As a result I began the research and devlopment for the courswork for green concepts and green technology and presented it to the Academic Advisary board for the ACT program. Because of my presentation the board asked me to join them as a student advisor for the Baker College ACT program. Ultimately Baker College incorporated green design and technology into the ACT curriculum.
I also have experience in 3D CAD design for private manufacturars and residential/small commercial construction. Several of my designs have been bought by private clients. 
I also have 20 years experience in the field. My specialty is drywall installation, finishing and repair. I also have experience in roofing, siding, framing, landscaping, minor elecrical and plumbing, paintng, cabinetry, doors and windows, trim work and flooring, and geneal facilities maintence. Basically I can build anything given the chance.
Recently I moved my family from Muskegon Michigan to Houston looking for employment. Bringing the family is also bringing more experience. My son and daughter have been working by my side since they could swing a hammer. My son has 10 years experience and my daughter has 7. My son's fiance has also been in the family business for 5 years, and my wife is my office manager.
We are all currently living in an RV and we are looking to find a place to call home. Right now we need any opportunity. The ideal place would be a place that would accomidate our RV with electrical and water hook ups as well as a laundry and shower facility and a place where our dogs can roam. We are more than willing to work at a place for rent and a bit of a paycheck. But until we find jobs we have no income to sustain our residency. I am looking for any assistance on work leads and I am also looking for any day labor in the Houston, Sugarland area. We have a friend who is letting us use his truck but we cannt take it far, so I would also like to look for car-pooling. Please feel free to look at my webiste to further delve into what I do.

I got a pretty decent response from a recent post looking for freelance web developers.

It put me in touch with a fair number of people and small businesses who are established and who I will almost certainly be working with in the future.

Unfortunately, the one I chose (based on budget and size of project, as well as portfolio) just straight up bailed.

Here's what happened:

We set a due date of the following Monday (about a week, I believe).
A couple of days before the due date, I emailed to inquire about progress and was told that things were progressing great, and asking for more of the asset files.

I had forgotten to provide these files, which were important, but work could definitely progress without them. At the freelancer's request, we extended the deadline to Wednesday. I had no problem with this.

A day before the deadline (Tuesday), I was provided with a link to the work-in-progress. I'd estimate that it was at less than 50% completion. Additionally, the freelancer stated (not asked) that the deadline was going to be extended again due to ""personal issues"" that had come up, but that he could ""get it done by the end of this week"".

I mentioned that Friday by 5pm was still acceptable, but that communication was poor and that I was not pleased to be pushing a deadline three times in a single week.

I ended my email by asking again if Friday by 5pm worked for the freelancer.

The freelancer responded that Friday at 5 was acceptable and apologized for the lackluster communication.

One additional email was received later that day, clarifying an aspect of the project and that's the last I heard from him.

No completed work, no further communication, nothing.

Anyway, I'm not looking to call the guy out publicly, I just thought it was bad form.

[Front-end Developer](http://startuply.com/Jobs/Front_end_Developer_6339_3.aspx)  
  
[LAMP/LAMoP Developer](http://startuply.com/Jobs/LAMP_LAMoP_Developer_6339_2.aspx)  
  
[Graphic/Web/UI/UX Designer](http://startuply.com/Jobs/Graphic_Web_Designer_6339_1.aspx)
  
They were put up by our CTO, who is cool and more professional.  Read them over to get the official feel for the position.  
  
Ok, all done?  I'm the lead developer.  I'm also cool, but more laid-back, so I'll give you guys the conversational low-down:
  
A few caveats... First this is an on-site position and we're in Midtown West, near the Javits Center.  We are a startup with funding, but we're not going to relocate you or fly you out for an interview.  If you live farther away and want to work from home, you'll need to (wo)man-up first and have faith we'll get there eventually... trust me, I commute from the NJ shore area and would love to work from home, but nothing can beat the spontaneous, in-person, collaboration we have now.
  
Second, we want full-time team members who are looking for a sense of ownership over their work and want to cultivate it and see it grow to it's full magnificence.  So no freelancers or Web Dev shops.  
  
Lastly, no headhunters or agencies... unless you have a Jerry Maguire type relationship with your prospect and I've never met any in this space that have.
  
Right now we have an existing product we are looking to refactor using more advanced technology and a different framework from what we have currently implemented.  We're looking to split our all-in-one, bulky app in to smaller, distributed applications which can scale independently (we're also looking at Node.js to possibly build out some of those distributed application components).  We have a big PHP backend component using MongoDB, a large Javascript front-end application and a heavy stylesheet.  All need refactoring and we need somebodies who can jump on board to help out without needing a hand-holding.

What we're really looking for in new team members are smart, critical problem solvers who aren't full of shit and are interested in taking an awesome product which can have an amazing market impact and making it even more awesome.  That means:  
  
- You like to solve problems, it's in your nature, the words ""I don't know"" exist merely as a segue-way in to a possible solution or set of questions designed to elicit more information to find the best solution to the given problem.
  
- You are dynamic, learn quickly, can adapt and are willing to step outside your comfort zone.  If you need to learn something which isn't in your job description, you see it as an opportunity or a necessary evil.  If a given solution you worked on for many hours is rendered obsolete by a business decision, you can handle it (limited bitching is always allowed within reason).  New technology excites, rather than intimidates you.
  
- You take pride in your work, but can balance trying to build the perfect implementation with the realities of every-present time and business constraints.  You strive to build the best solution for the given situation.  
  
- You engage with your team, you don't work in isolation (but you know when to focus down).  You care about what you're doing, why and how it achieves the overall goal of making the product better.  
  
- You take responsibility for yourself, your mistakes and you learn from them, then move on.  You seek to solve the problem, not find someone to blame.  
  
If that sounds like you and you'd like to work with some like-minded people on a cool project, then send an email to techjobs@newlio.com (we like cover letters with resumes) or respond to the Startuply posts listed above.

1320811800.0,26,self.forhire,m5pdj,[For Hire] DC/Bethesda/Rockville. Seeking Moss and Roy. I'm your Jen. Not as creepy as it sounds. And I can computer!,30,4,9,http://www.reddit.com/r/forhire/comments/m5pdj/for_hire_dcbethesdarockville_seeking_moss_and_roy/,"(Reposting because I totally forgot to put my location in the title, sorry!)

You know the IT Crowd environment? Nerdy programmers in a basement? Get work done, but do it while wearing the same shirt you wore three days in a row?

I look like I belong in a corporate environment, I've worked in corporate environments. I hate corporate environments. And I've seen too many IT Crowd episodes not to find myself thinking, ""I could totally work in that environment.""

Sadly, I'm in the DC area, and it seems like the only jobs available are corporate, typically-DC, HR up the ass, 9-5 types of jobs. I'm looking for something different. I have this feeling that there are amazing jobs hidden in secret nooks of DC/Bethesda/Rockville, but how does one even find them? They probably don't have enough money to throw at a recruiter, and they're probably so comfortable that they don't even necessarily want to hire someone new. Hmm, how 'bout Reddit?

Please hire me. Or at least, can we talk? Even if you're not hiring right now, wanna grab a coffee?

I'll cut to the chase. I've been with a firm in DC for 4 years and I'm ready to get out. I'm a front end web developer with 4+ years of professional experience (I've been building sites since I was a teenager. I'm in my late 20's). I do XHTML/CSS, PHP/MySQL, JavaScript (jQuery, MooTools), WordPress, C5, SEO, HTML emails, other stuff. I use CS3 &amp; 5.5, Word, Notepad++. Windows Vista/7, Ubuntu. I have a good eye for design. I build sites from the ground up, start to finish, and I am responsible for all maintenance. I'm the sole developer at my firm. Looooottttts of responsibility. I've built many very complex (details, details) sites with gorgeous, top notch designs (I'm not a designer, but I know how to build from complex mockups). I work really hard. I work overtime. I stay till 7, 8PM, I work on pro bono projects till the early hours of the morning, then I go home and work some more. I write and edit copy too (B.A. in English).

I'm in love with what I do. I seriously love it. I get excited about it. I'm completely self-taught and very driven, but I'm a really laid back person, an introvert who is often mistaken for an extrovert, I like everyone as long as they're not total assholes, and I'm a really good sport. I like teams and I like working alone.

Basically I just want to work, but in a great environment with other people who value their freedom in the workplace, and who value their work. If I have the tools I need, headphones and cup of coffee, I can make wonderful things happen. I'm really terrible at selling myself, but I'm going to give it a shot. I'm a REALLY GOOD DEVELOPER, and people in general seem to like me.

Anyone out there who kinda gets what I'm talking about, and is hiring? This is a really informal post, I know. I'm wiped out after a long day of work, freelance projects, and phone interviews. Just thought I'd post this and see if anyone goes, ""Hey! That's us!""

This internship is a six month position with the option of moving to a paid salary position based upon your performance.

Whilst it's an unpaid internship, we'll cover your expenses, get you the necessary equipment and help you out if needed. If times are rough and you need help, let us know.

Looking for a responsive web designer - to completely redesign a corporate website that's also used to sell product (not an ecommerce site like amazon, we only sell one product).

**Broad Strokes**

Looking for a completely new design for my company's website. While most of the design will be completely up to your discretion you will have to follow our branding guidelines and may end up working with a few other groups with vested interests. Our site is, in short, not small, we're talking about at least 30 pages each with unique challenges we're hoping a good designer can address.

**What I'm looking for**

I'm looking for portfolios and examples, specifically ones that show your approach to a common features or interesting solutions to challenges. Some of our services are not easy to lay out on a website without looking someone gave up and threw all the crayons on the ground, so having examples of good design solving skills will greatly influence who I will end up contacting.

**We pay**

This isn't for street cred, unless you can somehow find a way to feed your family with that. Our business is in the states and we prefer to if you were too so we can mail the check to you. If you prefer payment by other means (ie paypal) we could arrange that as well. Otherwise, we'd resort to wiring money and you will not believe how much that upsets the people upstairs.


**What to expect**

After sending me your proposal I will review your portfolio.  This process will take awhile as I want to be thorough.  So I may not reply right away.

Thanks for taking a look.

**My thoughts so far**

I'm goddamn lazy.  I've had to copy and paste every proposal off reddit so I can go through them and take notes in an editable document.

I'm asking because I have had no luck getting a job although I have had a few interviews and I've heard that the stigma that guys with long hair are hippies and such might be part of the reason.

*Important Info up front:* NDA and 1yr non-compete agreements ultimately required from you, along with a copy of your state photo ID and photo of yourself which matches it. Payment by your chosen method. Hourly ($10) or per product ($5).

Please creepily stalk my reddit history if you need more proof I'm a normal trustworthy guy. I’m sure you can find out more through there than I would feel comfortable revealing to you. *Awkward smirk* 

I will, of course, prove my trustworthiness to you as I hold up my end of the bargain and our relationship becomes ongoing. To help take the edge off trusting a random stranger over the internet, while we get started I can even pay you as often as daily for your work. I would prefer we change that to weekly or biweekly, however (less work for me is good)

So with that out of the way: 

---------------

**I had a great idea recently!!** You see, I run a website that sells somewhat-less-popular electronics. They are cutting edge and verrry cool, they are however not very mainstream. (Yet!)

I want(need) to expand it more quickly than I can right now, as I’m responsible for other parts of the business as well. Therefore I would love to offload some of my work to you and benefit myself as well as my redditing friends!!!! 
 
I need you to list new products on my website. (and update old ones) I have a spreadsheet of the items available to add, but it does not have any info about the products themselves, aside from part number, manufacturer, short description. For the rest, you will find the info available on amazon, manufacturer, and a few niche-related websites (our partners). I will provide these resources to you. 

You will be responsible for reviewing the information, understanding the products well enough to write(actually rewrite) a 50-80%+ UNIQUE and 100% ACCURATE description, along with resources like images, instruction manuals, related items, etc. I will answer any questions you have about the product lines and product themselves (as I am an expert in this regard and do it full-time). Finally you will need to categorize the products so visitors can find and browse them logically. 


We can discuss whether you prefer payment-per-results ($5/product) or hourly ($10/hour). I’m looking for 10-30 hours or 20-60 products per week right now. Expected time necessary per product is roughly 30 minutes. The amount of work I can give you will go up if this works out for us both. We won't run out anytime soon with about 20k individual products that can be added.

---------

**SOME GUIDELINES:**

-	REQUIRED: Know how to write HTML! Not whole websites! My website is template driven, you just need general HTML formatting, image placement, etc. More ability is fine but won’t be required.
-	Understand some basic SEO as far as content goes (its not complicated)
-	Be interested in technology and electronics-inclined. Not just into buying cool products, but having a pretty good understanding of how they do what they do. Also, knowing how to install and configure them perfectly is a massive plus. 
-	Have acceptable grammar, and writing skills somewhere between “really good” and “freakin awesome” (perfection is not required but will get you more work sooner)
-	Very light Photoshop work (mostly resizing or changing filetype) required
-	Experience with beginner level electronic components, and/or household electricity a plus. (Spend any time on hackaday?) **The niche aligns closely to some of their content. computers, the internet, residential electricity, lighting, security, climate, telephone/cable, and entertainment**
-	All work will be done through an online admin panel interface. (WORK FROM ANYWHERE) I will teach you the ropes as necessary, by IM, chat, or email. Or phone/audio/video if you need to. Any questions about the products etc will be answered in an hour or less (but most often immediately).
-	If you have experience with ecommerce or web development, and can offer any useful suggestions, they would be appreciated and may also deepen our work relationship (I’m always open to talking about it)
-	Payment by electronic funds transfer (preferred), check, money order, gift card, or whatever the heck it is you prefer.
-	NOTE I am not a huge corporation, I’m a single person. I don’t operate as a separate legal entity so you will be dealing directly with me. You are responsible for paying your own taxes and blah blah. I will pay you for your work even if it sucks (But if it sucks I will tell you, and will eventually not give you any more). I’m the judge on what is a good job and I am fair and reasonable.

-    This is part-time work. IF you are looking for something reliable and very long-term, this is not for you. I’m looking to convert your free-time to money, so unemployed/freelancers/bored people will probably want to apply. If you are full-time and stressed as it is, please dont!

-------

Sound like something for you? Tell me a little about your experience with consumer/household electronics, websites, HTML, etc. A formal resume and/or real examples of your work/experience/interests will be huge pluses. 
I will tell you as much as I feel comfortable revealing, but keep in mind I would like to retain as much of my privacy as possible. Once you agree to identify your (real) self, sign my hobble-cobbled (but legally binding) NDA and a 1 year “do not compete in this niche” (it won’t be hard to fulfill that one..), then I will tell you every single thing you want to know as well as give you access to the data and website(s) of our partners.


**I hope this can help someone** because I know finding the right person will be helping me. I really can’t believe I waited this long to come to reddit with the idea of using it for outsourcing!! I’ve been struggling through it myself all this time….. I was also considering using elance or amazon turk etc but that would not be as flexible methinks.  I think Reddit is where it’s at! 

Now it’s your turn to prove I’m right! PM or email me with info and questions: easyisle@gmail.com and we'll get crackin ASAP. That was long! Thanks for reading :)

Today I was informed my last day at my current job will be the 15th, but a little history is in order. 

I graduated from TCU last December and have been on the job hunt since then. I have a degree in Poli Sci and a Spanish minor. I paid my way through that institution with federal and private loans, I'm not a trust fund baby.  As I have once again began my job hunt, I am confronted with many positions I was turned down for originally.

The job I am losing was working for a concrete company in the DFW area as sales/marketing.  I have no desire to return to my previous job in retail and I need a higher paying job for my student loans.

So with that, Reddit, I could use some help. I'm great at troubleshooting, repairing, building computers and I have over 10 years of experience in retail. I just feel lost right now. I'm not looking for handouts or anything like that. 

I want a job I will be challenged at, something I have yet to experience. Any suggestions?

If you think you're a decent programmer who has some experience tinkering with technologies like node.js, python, C#, C++, or ruby, then give me a shout. If you're willing to work for a $18/hr, that probably means you don't have a lot of work experience. I'm fine with this as long as you're confident in your ability. I just need somebody who knows good programming when it stares them in the face. I need someone who has instinctual knowledge of object-oriented programming. Someone who has played around enough in their field to at least know of popular libraries and frameworks in the language of their choice.

The project is fairly straight forward. We have computers out in the field power by solar energy and connected via 3g. The computer grabs some data from an embedded system (RS-232 Interface) and provides an interface for that data. An application that lives on the server will periodically query all of the field computers for data and provide a more extensive interface for that data. Then there is a front-end web interface that serves up this data in a pretty way.

I need somebody that can not only perform the tasks I outline for them, but advise me on processes we could be doing more efficiently. On technologies that I've overlooked. I'm looking for someone to collaborate with, not be a boss of.

Hopefully we can learn together and make some really good money in the process. The start-up is growing everyday and its main target is the oil and gas industry, so there's no shortage of work or money.

In addition, if you feel like you ARE a rockstar programmer who would like to work for maybe $25/hr, give me a shout too. I'm fairly flexible.

I understand this posting is a little vague, but if you're in Dallas and you can program, just shoot me an email with your name and the languages you're proficient in.

Less than an hour from DIA.",29,7,0,http://www.reddit.com/r/forhire/comments/1i0t8c/for_hire_13_years_of_it_experience_including/,"I'm a long time IT professional and I miss traveling.  Here's my /r/forhire post from six months ago: 

&gt;I've worked with Linux, OS X and Windows, mostly in small business environments. I used to be head of IT for a company that supported nuclear gamma cameras for cardiologists and other medical imaging clinics all over the country and that was about 30% to 50% travel time. Most of that travel was onsite support on imaging computers and small networks. I also worked in hospitals from time to time. I miss the traveling a lot and would probably still be at that job if they'd made me 70% to 80% travel time. But there was too much time sitting isolated in the IT room by myself to keep me happy. I'm kind of a people person.

&gt;I have a good job here as a small business IT consultant, but really miss the travel and want to do that again. I'm also really clear that I want to help and teach people, not sit in a cubical and write code and reboot servers. I've done that and while solving problems is what drew me to IT, helping people, face to face is what's kept me here.

&gt;I can't relocate because my ex-wife is here with my three year old son and he's the most important thing in my world. I'd want to be back in Colorado at least on weekends in order to spend time with him. But I'd be happy to work with a company based pretty much anywhere as long as they didn't mind me traveling from here.

&gt;I want to be really clear: I'm willing (eager) to travel full time or close to full time. I want to work with people, preferably doing high level customer support and onsite repair and training. I have experience with fairly complex hardware and software (nuclear gamma cameras, linux clusters for doing image processing, OS X server based medium sized networks, just to name a few). I'm even passingly familiar with AIX and Solaris.

&gt;I've supported highly intelligent, demanding users (medical professionals and nuclear imaging techs). And I'm not in a hurry, I'm happy enough where I am that I'm just going to spend as long as it takes keeping my eyes peeled for the right fit.

&gt;If that might be you, I'd really love to hear from you.

I'm looking for a hardcore gamer whom I can partner with for making and publishing videos on YouTube which I can then promote using some social media pages and accounts I have access to.

I'm looking for a guy who's friendly, knows his way around Youtube, is able to edit videos (You don't need to be a pro), and have access to a fast internet connection.

But, most importantly, you need to be a passionate gamer, especially having access to a PS3, and having knowledge about the system. I'm looking to upload most of the latest trailers, do some reviews as well as make some original content that we can publish and promote.

This will be a fully paid job and the person as I said would become my partner. Whatever we make, a portion of it will go directly to him. So, the opportunity to earn is huge.

If you're interested in discussing this further, please send me a private message and I'll direct you how we can connect.

If you're interested you can [apply here](http://www.kingcontent.com.au/writers/) and tell us of your specialities. I'll be hoping to get back to the writers I like the look of in the next couple of weeks, but depending on the response it may be after the Christmas break before I'm in touch.

He emailed me a ""webstile"", which is a template that establishes a color scheme, font choice, and general aesthetic. After a bit of back-and-forth tweaking, we were ready to make the first design.

Namanyay prepared v1 in one night. He was responsive and patient throughout the entire process, and implemented my ideas tastefully and  promptly. It wasn't long before we had a finished website, and I think it's really beautiful.

From there, we moved on to graphic design. He promptly made mockups and heeded my input. I now have a finished website and a complete set of graphic design material for social media. I couldn't be more pleased with Namanyay, and I couldn't recommend him more highly. I look forward to working with him in the future.",,False,,t5_2qzbh,False,,,True,t3_1ad0ke,http://www.reddit.com/r/forhire/comments/1ad0ke/testimonial_very_positive_experienced_with_a/,

I didn't expect to have to take on projects today. I turned on flair for links so I could tag posts where people forgot to do it themselves. Then people all of a sudden [wanted it to get all fancy](/r/forhire/comments/174vk2) with updates on if the position has been filled and if it's still open and the like.  ThePoopsmith helped out with that. And I realized that redirecting people to the local subs myself is a waste of time, so I fixed up the wiki and now we've got a list of local subreddits. I stuck it next to filter since it's a type of filter. Go click it.

We also had a lively thread on [jobs being for currency, not equity](/r/forhire/comments/1716w0), which I thought made sense and it was silly that people would think a 'for hire' subreddit could ever be used to find partners. But since it's weird, I linked to the thread in the sidebar by the suggestion.  We also had people suggest a budget be required for posts that aren't hiring a long term position. I made it a suggestion instead, to keep from scaring off people who are just unsure of the value of the job.

TL;DR: Link flair, new suggestions to keep the cash flowing, and a wiki page to list local 'for hire' type subreddits to expand your reach.

I am a the hardest working individual you will ever meet, and I pride myself on that fact. I am willing to go beyond the highest set of expectations to ensure that the work I produce is that which is considered exemplary. I guarantee that my most recent employer, and any of my previous employers for that matter, would attest to these facts.

To clarify why I am currently seeking employment, I regretfully had to resign from my most recent position in order to return to the Boston area address personal family issues, and am now looking for the chance to prove once again that I am more than capable as a laboratory technician, or in a comparable entry level lab position. With that said I would like to point out that although my resume may not be extensive, it does not speak to my true value as an employee. 

I learn and adapt quickly, I am able to work under extreme pressure, and despite how this post may read, my professionalism is unmatched. As I have already stated, I am simply looking for an opportunity to prove my worth once again as an employee who possess unrivaled work ethic and a desire to succeed, to the benefit of himself as well as his employer.   

If my attitude sounds like that of the type of employee you would want to add to your organization I implore you to view my resume, and to contact me in order to further discuss my qualifications. At the bottom of the post I have attached a link to it via monster.com.

I needed welfare to come thru so i would have some health insurance to keep seeing my dietitian. I'm not a big slob or anything like that. I just cant do work that requires a lot of labor or standing for 8 hours straight. I know that's a big draw back and i know being big sucks ( no need to remind me ). I do have experience in loss prevention ,3 years worth and 6 years in ems. I also do publicity and public relations for my volunteer ambulance corps. I am a very quick learner. I know how to use a computer. From doing EMS I have developed skills on how to work under pressure , multi-task , gather vital information , make difficult decisions , and work with the public. I am decent man , I am just looking for some help. I've been helping people my whole life just because I feel like I have to , its just human nature to me. I come to you guys because I love the reddit community. ( even thou i will see a lot of negative comments, I love you guys too. ) By the way this is a throw away account I been on reddit for over 2 years now anyone that would like a resume or just talk hit me up and I can also show you my other account.

Quickly I just want to mention these openings with my company are only available for people who live in the United States for taxing purposes at the moment (sorry EU, still love ya).

Down to the quick and dirty.  I am looking for some more graphics designers and Front end designers to help with oncoming jobs for my team.  At the moment its more of a seasonal thing where we are starting to get more than we can handle.  If you perform well enough then we can keep trying to grab more jobs to keep you on the team officially.  The pay will be based on each job, and the amount of work required for each job.  Right now the primary job is for a logo design website that needs a basic WP site w/ woocomerence that can do some simple blog post stuff, and offer their services w/ different price packages.

To give people an idea on who we are and what we do, here are are some sites from our portfolio:

* http://www.lokaboards.com/ - Snowboard company site.  They design and sell snowboards based on their patented design.  This site was just recently completed and built using WP and woocomerence.
* http://www.tinyuploads.com/ – Image hosting website completely design and coded on the backend by us. This is our own personal product that we use and have some of the websites we have designed use.
* http://www.intrinsicnature.net/ – We are one of the owners of Intrinsic Nature which is a well-known Art Collective that has been featured in magazines and recently redid the website.
* http://www.lolsummoners.com/ – This is a new project that we started recently for League of Legends, one of the most popular games on the market. It is relatively new but getting some design work improved upon it such as this: http://www.tinyuploads.com/images/dPQc1z.jpg

Our website itself is still under construction, as we are always slammed with work and still haven't been able to complete it.  www.tinywebteam.com  Our team handles everything from the graphics design, to the HTML/CSS/Javascript, to the back-end coding, to the hosting.  As a side note, if anyone is interested in just having us host their portfolios/websites/clients, we will do it for 25% cheaper than what you are currently paying.  Just a small side note.

If you are interested in finding out if you are a good fit for our team, send your resume/portfolio to adam [at] tinywebteam [dot] com.  If we feel you are a good fit for our team we will reach out to you to schedule an interview.  We are looking for good potential graphics designers and front end designers.

Hello r/forhire. I'm graduating college in late May, and I'm looking for a job after graduating. I'm looking for a job in Canada, ideally in Ontario, but honestly I'd be happy with anything in the country.

Quick overview of my experience: I've spent two years working as support for both staff and students at my university. This current year is being spent as a supervisor of that helpdesk. I've done both phone support as well as face to face and onsite support, and I would say that my support and customer service skills are both pretty excellent. To validate this, I intend to take the A+ certification exam in mid-March, and don't anticipate any problems with passing it.

Here's my one major issue - I'm a US citizen, and I will need to apply for a work visa/work permit. This should not preclude you from hiring me, however! I've already filled out all of the forms I need to, and as soon as I have a written job offer I can submit them to the Canadian government (average processing time as of this post: 49 days).

If you're interested in hiring me, I will be available starting in early June (have to graduate college before I move!). Please contact me through anything listed on [my LinkedIn profile](http://www.linkedin.com/profile/view?id=208012239) or on [my resume.](https://docs.google.com/file/d/0B5QW-In6_PoLTFpycE5JcmQ0QWM/edit?usp=sharing)

Hi there,

We're a language learning company (http://eurotalk.com) that needs a whole load (~2500) of words and phrases translating from British English to American English. For example, instances of 'petrol' need replacing with 'gas'. They are mostly single nouns and short phrases.

The vast majority of the content will translate as exactly the same but we need each phrase checking to make sure nothing is missed. Everything is done on our web-based translation system (we'll give you a login).

So if you…

* Are a native English (American) speaker.
* Know British English (colourful car boots full of biscuits).
* Have a few hours spare.

Then get in touch: *EDIT* as noted above, we've filled the position, thanks for your interest.

We'll pay on completion via PayPal (or bank transfer if you'd rather). We've hired people for short tasks like this on reddit before and it's worked out really well.

Greetings. I direct an educational non profit in San Francisco and also happen to be almost terminally unfocused. I have found that my ability to actually concentrate on things and not spend five hours researching tardigrades is greatly improved when I have someone to converse with.

In short, the main responsibilities would involve confrence calls, emails, and some light dictation, all with the overall goal of helping to keep me intellectually honest.

There is a fair degree of flexibility as to when these various tasks get done, although my preference would be to have morning check in and goal setting calls on a daily basis in the neighborhood of nine to ten am PST. 

Considering the flexibility of scheduling and the fact that I am completely comfortable with you performing these tasks in your pajamas, the starting pay will be $10/hr, for approximately ten to fifteen hours a week.

This job is ideal for college students, or anyone else with some free time looking to make some extra income. The main qualities I am looking for are highly motivated, organized people with a positive disposition and a good sense of humor.

I'm going to be honest here; I'm sick of struggling. I'm in university at the moment, I am not going to lie; I do really enjoy it! It has helped me grow up so much and I've met and befriended an array of people, that I did not ever think I would socialise with. 



Currently, I'm working at my parents restaurant. But business has not been that great, and they're actually migrating to Cyprus/Iraq (mum's going to Cyprus, dad's going to Iraq) because there are a lot of jobs over there that require their skills.



I digress. When the restaurant gets shut down, I'll be out of work and competing with the huge influx of students, that need a job. I know that my situation is not unique, ~~there are probably~~ it's more than likely there are other students. in much dire situations; and comparing my situation to theirs, this is just a slight nuisance. 




I understand the consequences of making the decision to go to university, and that it is my own doing -I wanted to go, because I have a strong belief in education, not because it was the next milestone after high school.



So basically, I came to reddit -and see if there is anyone out there, that could offer me some work experience/apprenticeship/on the job learning.




I have multiple interests, probably far too many which is why I'm ultimately struggling with what I want to do with my life.

These are my interests:

*Drawing

*Designing

*Music

*Programming (HTML, XHTML, CSS, PHP, Lua, C#)

*Building Computers

*Setting up servers/architecture 

*Linux/Unix



I have a lot of interests that I would like to develop properly, and encompass them into a job that I would enjoy. I don't care if the pay is low; as long as I can afford a decent apartment and food, I'll be all right.



If there is anyone out their that runs their own company (can be ANYWHERE, UK, US, mainland Europe), and feels that they could take on a guy, that's willing to learn, has guts, eager to please, is not afraid of jumping into something that's out of his comfort zone (High School drop out, studying genetics and biochemistry at Aberystwyth University, just because at the time I could, can verify with my university e-mail.)



I'm a good person; anyone whom has encountered me;  always has something good to say about me (I'm not just saying that) I can provide a ton of glowing character references.



If you have managed to put up with my huge wall of text, I thank thee and I hope that if you are a potential employer, you could PM me.

Yours sincerely

If you want, you can check out my company here: wordsmithessays.com. I also have a profile on elance I'm happy to provide you if you want to make sure that I actually pay people.

I am looking for responsible college students at any brick and mortar school in the country who are willing to put up flyers for me. I will pay you $25 via paypal (or send you a game through Steam if that's your thing--from the list of what I currently have available) for posting 40 or more flyers throughout your campus in the fall. You don't have to post all the flyers at once, but you don't get paid until you do. You are going to need to take pictures of the flyers you post. I ask that you only post in places you are allowed to post, so no spamming people's parked cars or shoving stuff in mailboxes. You are responsible for the costs of printing, though most schools offer at least some amount of free printing so if you aren't sure whether yours does or not, ask around.

You will also get 10% from any essay that comes in from your campus. I create unique discount codes for each campus so that I can track where submissions are coming from.

You will also get a 20% discount that will never expire if you want to make use of our editing services. You can use the coupon code I give you twice, and if you want you can transfer it to a friend, too.

I am also interested in hiring an editor comfortable with the hard sciences and technical documents. The combo of comfort with science and good writing/editing ability is hard to find. If you want to work as an editor, you will need an elance profile (free to create).

**About Me/Us**

I work for one of the largest Wheelchair Accessible Vehicle dealers in the country. We are building our marketing department and part of that is writing more blogs, especially ones that really capitalize on SEO keywords. Our market is in Wheelchair Accessible Vans and Trucks, wheelchair and scooter lifts, vehicle modifications (i.e. hand controls, break/accelerator adjustments, etc.)


**About the Gig**

I am a blogger and writer myself and, though I love doing it, I just don’t have time for it in my daily routine. I need someone who I can export this too who will get it done with relative speed (I’ll never give you crazy deadlines) and capture the voice of our company. All while paying attention to SEO (this is really important to us.)

So basically what I need is for someone to do that for me. Our content ranges anywhere from things that can help families who have a disabled family member, to information on diseases that affect our customers, to product reviews and helpful tips. The options are basically endless, as long as it relates to our industry and can contain links back to our site. We already blog directly on our site, and yours may end up there as well, but mostly your blogs serve the purpose of being posted on outside sites and linking back to ours. We want to drive traffic to the website that we can grow our customer base.

We’d like roughly two blogs per week, but would possibly be interested in doing more as time goes on. If you can prove that you’re blogs are driving traffic, chances are we will ask you to do much more. We really want someone that will work for us in the long term. Someone that we can develop a personal relationship with, who understands what we need, and has a passion for writing as well as one for helping people.

**To Apply**

I’m sure I’ve forgotten some things and if you’re reading this you probably have some questions. Feel free to ask whatever you like and I’ll answer as best I can. To apply, PM me, include your rates and examples, and we will see what we can do for you! I will check this is frequently as I can and answer any questions as quickly as possible.

It was really amazing to see genuine and significant increases in productivity when a task with clearly defined patterns was made 90-100% automated.

For example, every month one member of the team would spend about 3 full days working on reports for each division of the organisation. The Human Resource Management System (HRMS) would output data in CSV files for a range of things (employee snapshot, leave, terminations, etc) and this person would have to manually filter and edit the data in Excel. They would then work out the number of employees (full-time equivalent and headcount) for each division, as well as commencements, terminations, excessive leave balances, and a few other things. This was done by filtering the data from the HRMS over and over and saving it into countless spreadsheets. Then this data would be sorted and copied into a template Word document for each division.

Within about a week I was able to turn this into a 20 minute process by creating an Access database. The team member now uses an easy form to import the HRMS data files and Access will generate all the reports and save all the data in tables for later reference. I was able to exactly mimic the Word documents that were being created before by hand, except now not only did it take a lot less time but it was impeccably consistent.

So this process would previously take 24 hours (3*8 hour days). The team member is paid about $35/hr (Australian wages are higher than our US counterparts). Creating these monthly reports manually is costing the organisation about $840 each month, or $10,080 a year. Now it costs about $140 a year. I don’t know if this is how you would normally put a value on productivity, but I think it at least gives an indication of worth.

Now of course that is a fairly extreme example. A smaller example is a process I have automated for another team. The team creates relatively formulaic written reports (not data like the other one) about four times a week. These reports don’t take a long time to complete, about 20 minutes each time. I created a pretty simple form in Word that takes the data (mostly checkboxes) and generates the report from that. The process is now about 5 minutes. The team saves approximately 1 man hour each week from the small automation, which is worth about $1,820 per year.

These were done in VBA using Microsoft Office because that was the easiest tool to use with that organisation, but I can also custom develop software in many other languages if it suits the purpose.
So now I’ve decided to do this freelance for other businesses in my spare time. A one-man operation with a full-time day job means I won’t be able to take on anything ridiculously large, although I’m happy to give advice on what options someone has for a large project. Right now I’m looking to make a reputation and get some clients under my belt, so I’m ridiculously cheap for this kind of work. I just finished a project for my first client (a redditor) and I may be able to convince him to be a reference if you want one.

If you have any processes that you do all the time that might have enough of a pattern to automate, or you have ideas for a custom developed program (e.g. to store client information and case notes) or even need some web development (but not design – I’m not artistic!) it might be worth your while to contact me. Your staff could be doing something more than the tedious process work that is best done by a computer.

She worked so hard on my paintings to make them specific to my liking and they came out great. Both my father and I were astonished at her craft work and how similar they look to the actual cats. I believe she has true artistic talent and work ethic so if you ever need something painted, ask her!

The site will basically be like www.khaccounts.net. I know this job is simple enough, I just need someone to make it as minimal and aesthetic as possible. 


I need the site to -

* A) Be a place where I can list the accounts I have currently in stock. This is the main goal of the site

* B) Be a place where I can also have sellers offer their accounts to me, just a simple form that emails me the information they input. (see khaccounts.net)

* C) Lastly, a place where I can clearly layout all of my contact information, as well as list my policies.

I am willing to pay some money upfront, and I will draft a contract myself for your services. I feel this is important as it will ensure that you receive the money, and I receive the services I am purchasing.

I am not purely looking for aerospace positions, my interest in engineering is fairly broad. As a result, not only have I applied to Sikorsky, Beoing and Agusta Westland, I've also applied to Redbull racing and Mclaren, among others.

If you want to contact me please do so via PM, I can give you a copy of my CV or answer any questions.

**Edit** More detail. I have dual US and British citizenship. I do not have a GPA since British universities don't do GPA, but I achieved a first with a 72% average in my first year.

Some of the modules for the first two years I've covered include; Structural Mechanics, Thermodynamics, Aerospace Structural Mechanics and Materials, Circuit analysis, Computer Aided Engineering, Airframe Structures, Dynamic Systems, Aerodynamics and many others.

A project I worked on in the first year was to design and build a rocket assisted glider which would carry a payload of one egg and construct a business proposal for it. 
We had a number of set backs within the team, one member had a close family member die so was unable to attend for a while, another was ill for a few weeks and one simply stopped attending anything university related. This left me and one other to do the vast majority of the project. We had to consider weight balance do flight calculation, CAD drawing and think about sourcing the material (the actual material was provided). When the glider was constructed we were very proud of it, she was a real beauty. When it finally came to testing it we attached the rocket and put in the egg and I pressed to button to launch. It went seven meters along the ground and literally exploded a little.
I thought about the reason for a while and came up with a reason. Because the project was rushed with such a small work force we had neglected to consider how the rocket was attached and our improvised solution was two rubber bands and some tape. The rocket immediately tilted the glider nose down. Also there was an ejection charge on the rocket we had forgotten about, its path was blocked by the rudder, so pressure built up and there was a small explosion.

TL;DR, rocket assisted glider, team issues and it exploded.",,False,,t5_2qzbh,True,,,True,t3_mmt0r,http://www.reddit.com/r/forhire/comments/mmt0r/for_hire_aerospace_engineer_undergrad_for_year_in/,

Curious? Send an electronic message to Justin Pot (at) makeuseof (dot) com and we can talk. I'm going to need: 

-links to your recent writing, anywhere on the web.

Problem is - we're game designers, not web or graphic designers. It'd be helpful if we were both of these, but alas... So that's why we need you.

We have some general ideas on the logo and what not, but the website is totally in the air and we want to work with someone from the ground up. 

To start the work won't be steady after the initial load of creating everything, but hopefully that'll change as business picks up. I assure you, this won't be the highest paying job you've ever had, but hopefully it is fulfilling and rewarding and at least a steady source of some moneys for awhile.

We have a set of 50 articles that we are distributing across a network of blogs and such but we have too many projects for our in-house writers to sit around retooling this content so that we can publish it as widely as we need to.

That's pretty much it. Some other info: 

* Articles are ~150-300 words 

* If you get in a groove and get up to 4 an hour, that's $16/hr (this is about the maximum pace I used to work at, though never for more than a few hours straight)

(x-post from r/gaming),23,5,8,http://www.reddit.com/r/forhire/comments/l8m0c/i_am_graduating_in_december_with_an_economics/,"Reddit, I've grown rather fond of you all over the past months.  So fond, that I'm posting all of the noteworthy accomplishments in my lifetime to date (that are relevant to the career issue, anyway).

Let's start.

I am a senior at the University of North Carolina at Charlotte, with a GPA ~3.4, and in-major GPA of ~3.8.
I will soon have a BS in Economics with a Liberal Arts emphasis, and a Minor in Political Science.  I love economics.  I love the entire field of study.  I am incredibly interested in why people behave the way that they do, how incentives matter among groups and individuals, and how consumers react to the many factors of the market.  Economics, to me, is the study of how to live in a world of **limited resources** with an **infinite number of wants and needs of it's inhabitants**.  Too cool for words.
 
I worked two techie jobs (Classroom support and then A/V technician) for the school, and eventually after two years became a production manager at the Student Union.  We have nearly 70,000 visitors through our building per week, and it is easily the most poppin' building on campus.  A year ago I was promoted to the  ""Ambassador of the Student Union"".  Since then, I have represented the union on numerous occasions throughout campus, gave orientation to many new employees, orientation to thousands of incoming freshmen and transfer students, and have been on the planning board to host an extremely large (Association of College Unions United) conference at UNC Charlotte's Union this weekend.

[Here is my resume.  More details there.](https://docs.google.com/viewer?a=v&amp;pid=explorer&amp;chrome=true&amp;srcid=0B0JGOdLMSJzZYmI2Yjk0NTgtMDkxMi00MGQxLWE4MzMtM2FmMzQ5ZmQzZmIw&amp;hl=en)

During my time at University I have accrued 180 hours of community service with our disability services organization.  I won an essay contest hosted by [Mont Blanc](http://www.montblanc.com/flash/#/) called the ""Signature for Good"" competition, where I wrote about how we should deal with (what I thought were) the most prevalent problems in developing nations.  I have also been an awesome employee.

I have recently obtained my *CrossFit Level 1 Trainer Certification*, for those who are not enlightened to [CrossFit, check this video.](http://games.crossfit.com/about-games)  We are a fitness program based on performance.  We train in constantly varied, high intensity, functional movement.  We train to develop an increased work capacity across broad time, modal domains and age.  *Please watch that video!*  I love CrossFit.

I am also pretty darn good at cooking.  [Here is my website](www.nerdpluspaleo.com) - disclaimer: I am a poor college student.  Everything tastes good, but may not be presented like you see it on fancy websites.

**Why am I posting this in r/gaming might you ask?**
Because I am a nerd.  I am a nerd at heart, and I always will be.  I love video games.  More than most.  I love eSports.  I LOVE THE RISE OF ESPORTS IN THE PAST YEAR!  I watch StarCraft 2 every day.  I WANT TO PARTICIPATE IN HELPING ESPORTS GROW!  
I would love to find a team that wants a cook and trainer for their atheletes!  THAT IS ME!  I am the answer!

I don't know what else to write here, Reddit.  I suppose I'm making an effort to reach out to a prospective employer on here, team or clan, whoever, and say ""HEY THERE, I would love to work for you!""  

Advice, suggestions, comments, concerns, curse words?  Leave 'em.

**TL;DR** I want a job that is awesome and involves my passion.  [Here is my resume](https://docs.google.com/viewer?a=v&amp;pid=explorer&amp;chrome=true&amp;srcid=0B0JGOdLMSJzZYmI2Yjk0NTgtMDkxMi00MGQxLWE4MzMtM2FmMzQ5ZmQzZmIw&amp;hl=en)

At the time I was moving a lot so I was looking for a company to cheaply forward my mail, scan it, and email it to me.   Unfortunately that company did not exist in Canada so that's the project I started.  After a few months of graphic designing, figuring out mail sorting systems and budgeting for a scanning machine, everything turned out better than expected.

I Learned to program PHP to make a really basic shopping basket and PHP order form.  Now the business is getting bigger and my crappy webdesign skills and programming skills are making the company look amateurish.

The biggest problem a lot of our would-be clients have is the issue of security.  Will their mail be secure.  Unfortunately I just wanted to draw funny pictures of snails and I didn't consider making the site look like fort knox.  So I need somebody to make the website look really professional and give the customers a feeling of security.  

Separately I need a back end for the site, where the clients can log in and review their invoices, mail and request their mail be forwarded to them.  

I'm looking at about $500 for the website redesign, even better if that included programming.  I'm not sure how much to offer for designing the back end.  

I really hope someone can help me with this and keep my fridge full of beer.  I'd even be willing to offer a percentage of the sales for a limited period if the designer has a bulletproof portfolio.

Thanks reddit!

Stephan

p.s.  here's the website.   http://www.esnail.ca
p.p.s don't be super harsh on the design, many professional designers have told me it's kind of ugly.  I'm not a designer, I'm just a guy who was out of work and happens to like drawing snails.  But please give me suggestions on how you would improve it.

You will be working with a designer who will be developing the UI and visual design of the site, but you should be familiar with front end development best practice guidelines  i.e. YSlow rules, unobtrusive javascript, etc.

We’re based in Southern California, but we have no problem working with someone remotely.

Key Responsibilities:

* Work as part of the development team to support our objectives
* Write clean, secure code
* Develop backend
* Provide sound technical recommendations and advice

Requirements and Qualifications:

* 3-5 years of Python, PHP or ASP development experience.
* MySQL
* XHTML/CSS/Javascript and web standards
* Detail oriented and able adhere to deadlines
* Familiarity with Web development best practices, i.e. YSlow rules, unobtrusive javascript, etc
* Proven ability to produce clean and quality code.
* Sense of humor

Nice to have:

* AJAX

I have informed them that this post is online and to look out for it.  I’ll answer general questions if there are any.  Otherwise I have just a few words of praise, inspired by a recent successful hire from /r/forhire.  
  
A Wordpress plugin I’m using needed some special customizations, and I needed an expert programmer to handle the task.  Outplug was able to take my existing plugin and modify it with a very clever and intuitive solution.  Dealing with outplug was a fantastic experience.      
  
The modification they designed does exactly what I needed it to do, and working with them to make this happen was easy.  Outplug communicated on a level that was pretty easy to follow- like I said I’m not an expert with programming, and they were great at communicating with me on my level.  
  
Total turnaround time from when we first discussed the project until completion was about one week.  We were able to communicate effectively and outplug was always available to answer emails within a few hours at most.
  
I don’t know if it’s customary to discuss costs here, so for now I’ll refrain from giving details beyond saying that I found their prices to be very fair.

I moved to southeast Dallas with my roommates a couple of months ago because it looked like there'd be more opportunity for better money here than in Abilene.  However, I found that not to be the case without a car, a college degree, and/or years of experience with a trade skill.  I've filled out hundreds of applications since arriving and have only gotten 2 interviews in 2 months, both yielding nothing.  My nearly depleted savings forced me to accept a job at a warehouse in Irving via a staffing agency, but the commute is brutal - in addition to 4 trains &amp; 2 buses a day, I've also had to walk over 25 miles in 4 days just getting to &amp; from work, where I spend 6-8 hours a night on my feet in a hectic warehouse.  The cherry on top of all this is that I've only eaten a sandwich &amp; 2 dollar menu burgers in the last week because all of my money has to be saved for weekly bus passes.  So...yeah...*desperate*.

I would like to get into something IT-related, but I know it'd be unlikely, at best, to get an internship/apprenticeship where I can learn *and* get paid.  I've got a sharp eye for detail, I type over 100 words per minute, I'm a very fast learner, I'm never late or absent unless seriously ill, I've got the strongest work ethic of anyone I know, and I'm great with scheduling, filing, &amp; other clerical/office work.  I've spent most of my adult life working in hotels, specifically behind the front desk, but I'm really hoping for something different.  My objectives at the moment are fairly simple:  I'm seeking career stability that pays well enough to where I can afford to finally stop relying on public transportation &amp; where I don't end up eating ramen or starving myself every month.

There are only 3 things I really require:

- Nothing that would put me near human bodily waste/garbage at all (I have a severe mysophobia &amp; those things send me into panic attacks).
- Something that I can commute to without physically exhausting myself before I even show up and, thus, reducing my productivity.
- Something that I can get to during DART hours, preferably a 9-to-5 kind of morning shift or an overnight one.

In fact I am very open to the idea of a job that would allow me to move somewhere near taylorsville to make things easier with SLCC. I've only had one serious job in the past which I held for two years after graduating a year early from high school. The job was a part time sweeper where I did daily maintenance sweeping and cleaning of all the hallways, classrooms, and bathrooms in the building as well as seasonal deep cleaning using autoscrubbers and the like, and doing security of the campus to open and close it.


I'm rather frustrated right now because I've had no option but to leave my latest job which I've only had for three weeks now. I was misled into thinking it would be a full time position, so I was gung ho and for 3 weeks now I've been biking 12 miles a day just for that job despite they offered very meager hours. It was a position that simply was not worth keeping for me, sadly.


The very bottom line is that I need a full time job, one that has hours flexible enough to still allow me to attend the classes I do. The only exception is that I am not interested in any general labor, unless the pay was absolutely incredible. Ideally it would be a job that would last at least five years to help me through college.

I have a food handlers permit, I can easily get CPR and BLS re-certified -- I've been experienced with first aid for a very long time. I would not be opposed to getting phlebotomy, CNA, or EKG certification if it meant employment though I do not desire to stay in healthcare  as a lifetime career. I am someone who never shirks from my obligations or duty, if you ask my old boss Mr. Stott there was a time where I went in on a shift on one lung. And well, right now I really could use a full time job


Since it is not an EOCC protected status in this state, I'd rather be up front with it and if there is any issue just be blatant about it and I will look no further: I'm transgender and I'm actively trying to transition my life towards one where I can find happiness. My ideal job would also be one that could offer a friendly environment for me to do so

The other is a willingness to spend a lot of time doing stuff on a computer. It's primarily a phone-based job, but you'll be searching for your own leads. We use a number of services and will train you thoroughly how to use them, but being the kind of person who knows how to effectively screw around on the internet and look things up on their own initiative is a good quality.

General description of the job: Cold calling B2B inside sales. A salesperson is responsible for sourcing, contacting, and initially qualifying leads. This is all business-to-business, so there's no calling people at home at dinner time. It's a great place to work, family owned, mid-size business. In business for more than 60 years.

For each car, we're looking for some interesting factoids written up about the car in general and about one or two of its notable features. For example, for the Corvette ZR1, the overview might be:

&gt; As they say, there's no replacement for displacement. The decked out ZR1 is proof of that: its supercharged 6.2L engine makes an insane 648 hp at the redline, allowing it to sprint to 60mph in only 3.3 seconds, despite weighing in at over a ton and a half and being loaded with creature comforts in the cab.  The 2011 edition of the ZR1 proves once more why the Corvette is the ultimate American sports car.

And two factoids about interesting features might be:

&gt; Peak HP is reached with the help of a supercharger so big that Chevy engineers needed to split its output into two channels to avoid having an unsightly hood bulge.

&gt; Starting with the 2011 model year, Chevy offers lucky purchasers the chance to hand-build their engine in GM's performance build center--closely supervised, of course. Don't worry: you won't void the warranty.

You'd be on the hook for the research and the writing. Excellent writing skills are a plus, but so long as the content is interesting, we could handle the copy editing.

This is a telecommute position and pay would be per car completed. You don't need to sign up for all 300 cars, we'd assign batches of them and pay on completion of the batch. PM if you're interested.

I'm currently an active duty USAF Captain that's looking to separate later this year.  My wife and I have a baby on the way, and after already living 2 out of the last 4 years apart, I'm looking to try and have a more stable work environment.  My wife is active duty as well, so we're tied to the San Antonio, TX area for the next few years.  
  
Here's a brief summary of my experience:  
  
* BS (2002) and MS (2004) in Mechanical Engineering  
* ~2 years manufacturing engineering experience (aircraft parts)  
* Commissioned in USAF in 2006  
* ~2 years developmental engineering experience (rocket engines &amp; missile defense tech)  
* 1 year as an executive officer  
* ~3 years as a Special Agent with AFOSI (with the security clearance that comes with that) 
  
So, right now my separation would likely be in the September timeframe, and I would be looking for something either in the San Antonio, TX area, or something that can be done from home.  Please PM for more details, as I've left quite a bit out for brevity.  
  
Thanks!

     Cooking dinner
     Driving him to Tae Kwon Do class two evenings a week

     Enclosed parking or access to my car
          The latter requires you take me to and from the airport
     A weekly stipend to be negotiated based upon experience

This job will be ""on the books"" which means I will be your employer, withholding your taxes, and reporting income to the IRS. You will be expected to sign a 6-12 month contract with a no-fault 30 day trial period during which either side may cancel without penalty. There will be a bonus of 5%-12% (depending on the term) after successfully completing the contract.

I will be verifying identity and require at least two character references (at least one from a former nanny/au pair/babysitting client or a respected member of the community such as a teacher, clergyman, etc). I will also be performing a 50 state background check for final candidates.

About me:
I am 40 years old, non-religious, and also a Tae Kwon Do student with my son. I drink rarely and do not smoke. I generally travel Monday morning through Thursday night, but when I work on the west coast my flights usually arrive Friday early morning. I am NOT looking for a girlfriend or any sort of ""benefits"" as this will be strictly a professional relationship.

About you:
You must be at least 18 (over 21 preferred) and a non-smoker. Social drinking is acceptable which I define as one beer / glass of wine a day on average. I understand that mostly women are looking for au pair positions, but I am open to interviewing a man for the job. You must be fit enough to regularly handle stairs as I live in a two-story home.

The goal is 2 things. A: Have an image that we can have rights to print and frame for our house. B: Have the image stretch over 3 monitors for our battle stations. (1920x1080) x 3

This is a big project that will require lots of specific details and needs to be well done. 

If this sounds like something you would be interested in. PM me (Level 21) with a portfolio of previous work and a rough cost estimate on how much this undertaking will be.

I enjoy attending security and hacker conferences like C3 or [BerlinSides](http://www.berlinsides.org) and in my free time I spend a lot of time working on projects at the [Stuttgart Hackerspace](http://www.shackspace.de) where I've also given several talks and held a workshop on the basics of reverse engineering.

As the CTO at Etsy said, “[*In an environment where it’s incredibly difficult to hire and retain engineers, culture can be everything*](https://www.path.to/inspiration/kellan-elliott-mccrea-etsy).”

As engineers, we feed off of intellectual stimulation and energy from one another. If every effort is made to promote this type of culture, then there is no doubt that great things *will* happen. With passion and dedication come success. How lucky are we to enjoy our jobs as much as we do?

If you ever have the opportunity for /u/scratchy_cigarilloes to moonlight on a project for you, **take it!** We started out by giving him a freelance project with an unfortunately tight deadline. He was exceptionally communicative, keeping us comfortable throughout the lifecycle of the project, and delivered a perfectly coded website right on time. He's a truly great guy to work with, and has made me really glad that we started recruiting on reddit.

[San Francisco, CA]",19,2,19,http://www.reddit.com/r/forhire/comments/18exi7/hiring_paid_digital_marketing_internship_with/,"LEWIS Pulse is a Silicon Valley public relations and digital marketing firm that caters to the B2B industry. Our digital marketing team has been growing rapidly, and we’re looking for a Social Media and Digital Marketing Intern hire to add to our team, with the potential to transition to full-time employment.

We’re looking for someone with 1-2 years of professional experience in social media/digital fields or marketing. This includes, but is not limited to, running corporate channels (Twitter, Facebook, company blogs, etc.). We want a candidate with *proven* writing ability, polished reporting/analytical skills, and ideally some experience running social media advertising (Twitter Promoted Products, Facebook Ads, LinkedIn Ads). Brownie points for SEO/SEM or design experience. 

**Job Requirements:**

* 1-2 years experience in marketing, public relations, advertising or related communications field;
* Proven ability to concisely articulate complex ideas through writing, with meticulous attention to detail;
* Proven experience in social media techniques and strategy (e.g. polished personal blog, YouTube channel, previous internship or professional experience);
* Ability to successfully manage the social media channels (Twitter, Facebook, YouTube, etc.) of large B2B accounts;
* Exceptional organization and written and verbal communication skills;
* Interest in working with highly technical accounts;
* Ability to contribute individually and participate in cross-functional teams;
* Four-year university degree;
* Enthusiasm and willingness to learn.

If you are interested in a career at LEWIS Pulse, email a resume, cover letter, and **writing sample** to intern@lewispulse.com. Become an Internet sleuth and stalk our website, the social media services we offer, and our clients - then let us know why you think you'd be a good addition to our team. 

Note that applications without a cover letter or writing sample **will not be considered**, and your writing sample can be submitted in the form of a Word document, PDF document, or a link to published online content or a personal blog. 

**Some tips for submitting your application:**

* Make sure your resume and cover letter are free of errors. Hopefully this should go without saying, but attention to detail is crucial when drafting content for a corporate social media page. Grammar counts.
* Emphasize skills, hobbies, and work experience that are relevant to online communications. For example, a built-out personal blog will be more impressive on your application than a Fulbright. We need team members who are already well-versed in online etiquette, including reddiquette. 
* Our team is a young, enthusiastic, and hardworking group. We're looking for someone who fits in with our team dynamic - someone who has demonstrated tenacity in moments of crisis and the ability to think on the fly.
* If you don't have 1 year of professional experience under your belt, don't freak out. OP started at LEWIS straight out of college with only a personal blog and YouTube channel to impress the higher-ups. Emphasize your experience, and don't sell yourself short.

Current employees of the LEWIS Pulse digital team include a prolific blogger and sex columnist published in the Huffington Post, an ex-marathon runner who coordinated an insanely popular campus-wide social media campaign using only lolcats, and a fashionista with extensive experience organizing online charities. 

If this sounds awesome to you, email your application to intern@lewispulse.com.

* **Location:** Intern must be able to commute daily to downtown San Francisco, CA

I used to be head of IT for a company that supported nuclear gamma cameras for cardiologists and other medical imaging clinics all over the country and that was about 30% to 50% travel time.  Most of that travel was onsite support on imaging computers and small networks.  I also worked in hospitals from time to time.  I miss the traveling a lot and would probably still be at that job if they'd made me 70% to 80% travel time.  But there was too much time sitting isolated in the IT room by myself to keep me happy.  I'm kind of a people person.

I have a good job here as a small business IT consultant, but really miss the travel and want to do that again.  I'm also really clear that I want to help and teach people, not sit in a cubical and write code and reboot servers.  I've done that and while solving problems is what drew me to IT, helping people, face to face is what's kept me here.

I can't relocate because my ex-wife is here with my three year old son and he's the most important thing in my world.  I'd want to be back in Colorado at least on weekends in order to spend time with him.  But I'd be happy to work with a company based pretty much anywhere as long as they didn't mind me traveling from here.

I have experience with fairly complex hardware and software (nuclear gamma cameras, linux clusters for doing image processing, OS X server based medium sized networks, just to name a few).  I'm even *passingly* familiar with AIX and Solaris.

I'm a very intelligent 22 year old male who has backpacked China, worked Security for a Texas folk festival, snuck into Mt. Rushmore, professionally read Tarot, and done a lot more. I write a [blog](http://www.dakotahnorton.com), but we all know how profitable that is, and I'm very good at playing ukulele and spinning poi, just don't ask me to sing. I have never had a driver's license or a car and ride my bike everywhere. I currently live in North Chicagoland but would be willing to relocate practically anywhere in the world, though I'm limited by bicycle to North/South America. I am a hard worker with out-of-the-box critical thinking skills. I love all rock n roll.

This sounds lame, probably, but I really need some direction in life. If you're reading this and have an opportunity for some random dude on the internet to prove himself, please share it. I feel I would make a very good personal assistant or butler or something, as well as just a work hand. I do yoga and take very good care of my body. I made a lot of bad choices in my youth that led me to become somewhat unemployable, especially in the current economy where far more qualified people are applying for the minimum wage jobs I could potentially get.

Something I'd really like to do is that whole sign-spinning thing that's going on. I'm really good with poi, and decent with a bow-staff, so I have exercised the area of my brain that deals with that type of motion. If you have a business that could use some marketing, you should look into sign-spinning and then hire me to spin for you. I can also play very angelic music on my ukulele as background noise for a party or social event (luau).

**tl;dr-- I need some income and will do most anything I can. If you want to help a desperate redditor, please send me a pm**",,False,,t5_2qzbh,False,,,True,t3_10qb00,http://www.reddit.com/r/forhire/comments/10qb00/for_hire_desperate_vagabond_in_chicagoland/,

A full time job to me is the most important issue right now.

My work history include working at a movie theater, a pizza place, a gas station, and joining the military.  I have 6+ years of customer service and sales, 2+ years working phones for my various employees (answering phone calls, taking down messages and orders properly). 

I'm an honors student majoring in engineering at Valencia College.  My goals right now are to be accepted into their new BS program for engineering (either Electrical Engineering, Computer System Engineering, or Laser and Photonics Engineering). I have excellent diction and can type at 100wpm with 98% accuracy.  

At the movie theater (Cinemark) I was an Usher Supervisor, a Studio Eats employee (fast food restaurant inside the movie theater), a concession employee and also worked box office. I worked there from **2004 to 2010**


My duties were as follows:

* Clean and sanitize movie theater as quickly as possible within the given time frame before customers have seated.

* Clean and sanitize all work areas in my related department whenever possible and at end of night.

* Serve fresh food items (concession or Studio Eats) that customer's order as fast as possible as well as in accordance to health code and company standards. 

* Quickly, Accurately, and Honestly operate Point of Service terminal (cash register) 

* Extra duties included ensuring disruptions are kept to a minimal as well as loss prevention. 

* Inform management if emergency situation ever arouse.

At the gas station (Circle K) I was a simple cashier labeled ""customer service representative"" from 10pm-7am.  I worked there from **2007-2008**

My duties were as follows

* To properly clean and sanitize the storefront

* Properly receive daily shipments of inventory as well as correct any related mistakes 

* Stock the inventor properly on the storefront

* Accurately count and record storefront items

* Accurately record any cash drops into the safe I may do on my shift, while making sure I have $50.00 in the register in cash.

At the pizza place I currently work at from (5pm to 1am or later) I am a deilvery driver. I've worked there since **2010**

My duties are:

* Deliver pizza in a timely and safe manner (obeying all traffic laws) 

* Help prep the food items (cut pizza toppings, mix pizza sauce and dough correctly) according to health codes

* Take down orders properly whether it be by phone or walk-in

* Responsible for the proper amount of cash at the end of the night for cash out

* Clean and sanitize the restaurant at the end of the night

* Assist the cook whenever needed and as directed.

I served 7 months in the US Army as the MOS 68W - Health Care Specialist (combat medic). I did successfully complete basic training, I did not successfully complete AIT due to a condition I developed during that time.  The condition does not affect any aspect of my education or work ethic.

I'm well versed in Microsoft Office, it's been several years since I've done any HTML or XML work. I'm also First Aid certified by the Red Cross, and was formerly CPR certified by both the Red Cross and American Heart Association.

I am currently in the market for a full time job either in Orlando and the surrounding area or online, and salary-wise I'm looking for $10.00/hr at 40 hours a week. 

I am very hard and honest worker, and I am seeking a change from the kinds of jobs I've had in the past, and if any job I get as a result of this post turns into a career, I more than welcome it. I am also a very fast and resourceful learning, and have always said that ""If I can learn it, I can do it"".

I've recently launched my new photography blog: www.expertphotography.com and we're looking for writers to help take the load off as far as writing is concerned.

The pay ranges between $50-$150 per post with a minimum of 500 words. The base pay is $50 but goes up depending on how good it is, and how much content there is.

We maintain a fairly high standard of content and (this is something i've found a lot of photo blogs lack) rely heavily on photos to demonstrate out points. You would be responsible for providing photos for posts, but i may include my own as well if it's required. Photos must fit within 600x600px, but i'll go into further detail with anyone wishing to contribute.

To illustrate my point, here's a link to one of my latest posts ['The Definitive Guide To Corporate Event Photography'](http://www.expertphotography.com/the-definitive-guide-to-corporate-event-photography). This one would certainly be worth $150 at about 2300 words, but this post on [The Rule Of Thirds](http://www.expertphotography.com/basic-composition-techniques-the-rule-of-thirds) would be more like $50-$70.

Categories would be tutorials, news, reviews, photoshop etc. 

Accurate, well written content, with lots of good photos is what we're looking for. If you think you can help, email me at josh@expertphotography.com 
It's not essential, but please link to any work like this you've done before.

You will also have the opportunity to link to your own website/flickr at the end of each post so as the website grows, you should be able to get some interest out of it.

I currently commute an hour to get to my department, so I'm not able to respond to many calls. I want an opportunity where I can make more of a difference for patients. This is really important to me. I'd also like some room for advancement, and also a position that helps me strive to better myself. I don't quit on myself and I take my goals and aspirations very seriously. I have an Ohio firefighter 240 certification, CPR certified, NREMT-B, and also a Bachelor's degree in ""environmental studies."" I like staying productive and busy. My schedule is flexible and currently working third shift. It's important to me that I'm able to take pride in my work. I can, of course, apply for certification reciprocity. I've been sending job applications within the Seattle, Washington area. But I'm also looking at Colorado, Wyoming, and Oregon. I've applied to fire departments, private ambulance companies, and emergency departments. It really doesn't matter to me what kind of place will take me, so long as I'm able to help others and better myself. Please feel free to contact me with any questions, concerns, or for my resume.

She's also gone above and beyond the scope of the project in helping us with some follow-up work (minor edits, mostly), and she's been so polite and helpful throughout the entire process.

I'm a freelance artist based out of California.  Ever since some surprise heart issues landed me in the hospital for a few days last February, I've been struggling every month to get my bills paid.  Health-wise, I'm doing much better, but it seems this time every month I'm scrambling to figure out how I'm going to pay rent and other bills while still covering my medical expenses.  I had some luck on here last month by offering my services at discounted prices, so I thought I'd try again.

Here is a sample of my work (some new stuff added since last time I posted a thread on here):

[My art samples.](http://imgur.com/a/QO0hw)

As you can see, I work in a wide variety of styles and have worked for many different types of clients.  Whether you need something done for a professional project, a gift for a friend, or just something to hang on your wall, I can help you out.

Primarily I work digitally.  I send you a high resolution file that you can take to your local printers for a high quality print on glossy cardstock.

However, if you prefer to have me to take care of the high quality print and ship it to you, I can do that too for an extra small fee. (Prices depending on where I'm shipping it to)

Here are my discounted prices (about half of what I normally charge) that are only available through this thread:

$50 - A black and white sketch.

$100 - A finished, black and white illustration.

$150 - A fully finished, full color illustration. (These tend to be the most popular for commissions.)

If you need anything with a detailed background or multiple subjects in it, I have to charge a bit more for the extra time it will take.  Please just get in touch with me for a quote.  Same goes if you need me for a larger project or something.  Just get in touch so we can work something out.

I receive all payments through PayPal. You don't need a PayPal account to pay, you can pay with credit/debit card, and since it's through PayPal it's all completely secure.

I take payments upfront and work on the commissions in the order that I receive payment. (I no longer take payment after the work is finished, I've unfortunately been stiffed too many times). Upon receiving payment, it usually takes only a day or two for me to finish most pieces unless you need something more elaborate done or a lot of paid clients are ahead of you.

I speak my native language Filipino (Tagalog) fluently, so I can easily translate between English and Filipino; I can do both directions. ANYTHING at all, even text messages, if necessary, I will be able to translate for you. (Text message slang in Filipino is notoriously difficult to read.)

I am looking for work down here and saw that reddit might help. I have an Associates degree in ACT focusing on Green Design. I got my degree from Baker College in Muskegon Michigan. When I was at Baker College there were no programs for green design. As a result I began the research and devlopment for the courswork for green concepts and green technology and presented it to the Academic Advisary board for the ACT program. Because of my presentation the board asked me to join them as a student advisor for the Baker College ACT program. Ultimately Baker College incorporated green design and technology into the ACT curriculum. I also have experience in 3D CAD design for private manufacturars and residential/small commercial construction. Several of my designs have been bought by private clients. I also have 20 years experience in the field. My specialty is drywall installation, finishing and repair. I also have experience in roofing, siding, framing, landscaping, minor elecrical and plumbing, paintng, cabinetry, doors and windows, trim work and flooring, and geneal facilities maintence. Basically I can build anything given the chance. Recently I moved my family from Muskegon Michigan to Houston looking for employment. Bringing the family is also bringing more experience. My son and daughter have been working by my side since they could swing a hammer. My son has 10 years experience and my daughter has 7. My son's fiance has also been in the family business for 5 years, and my wife is my office manager. We are all currently living in an RV and we are looking to find a place to call home. Right now we need any opportunity. The ideal place would be a place that would accomidate our RV with electrical and water hook ups as well as a laundry and shower facility and a place where our dogs can roam. We are more than willing to work at a place for rent and a bit of a paycheck. But until we find jobs we have no income to sustain our residency. I am looking for any assistance on work leads and I am also looking for any day labor in the Houston, Sugarland area. We have a friend who is letting us use his truck but we cannt take it far, so I would also like to look for car-pooling.

[Jiahua Language School](http://www.jiahuaschool.com/) is an adult training center in Shenzhen that teaches both Mandarin and English.  Founded in 2009 by an experienced Canadian EFL teacher and Chinese Mandarin teacher, we have recently expanded into our second branch in Nanshan and are looking at further expansion opportunities. 

Jiahua is located in the CBD of Futian, and we strive to create a relaxed, friendly, atmosphere for our students to study.  We are passionate about consistently improving both our teaching abilities and curricula, attempting to deliver a premium product to our customers.

What we can offer that sets us apart from many schools is: (1) foreign management which treats foreign teachers as valuable additions to the company; (2) curriculum is fluid and we're consistently trying to improve - the teacher gets ultimate say of what goes into the class and can make permanent changes to the school's curriculum; (3) once people have experience within the company, the path is wide open for further career development. 

**The position:**

We are looking for a motivated self-starter who is interested in working in China.  This is a one year recent-graduate contract, but those who would like to stay longer and transition into a permanent teaching position are welcome and given preference.

The primary responsibilities of the position include:

- Teaching English (between 15-25 hours per week), both in formal classes as well as English Corners and other extra-curricular classes
- Organizing events and participating in the creation of marketing strategies
- Level testing of new customers
- Helping craft course curriculum

In addition, we are interested in utilizing your skills in whatever facet can help grow the company.  While teaching is the primary role, we would also be interested in those with skills and interests in art (in particular, line drawings), graphic design, IT, sales, or event planning.

If you have a knowledge of Mandarin Chinese (B1 or higher), we would also like to utilize those skills by involving you in our promotional activities and also in teaching lower level English courses.

**Requirements:**

This is an entry-level position.  Recent graduates are welcome to apply.

Candidates should be a native English speaker (candidates with a English ability of C2 and a minimal accent could also be considered) and hold a Bachelor's degree.  

Candidates that have teaching experience, have obtained certification, or have knowledge of Mandarin will be given priority.

**The contract:**

We provide group accommodation in a modern, high-rise style apartment, as well as *gratis* Mandarin classes, up to four hours per week.

Remuneration is RMB6500 per month, with a round trip plane ticket home upon completion of the contract.  Two weeks paid vacation are given which accrue along with the contract.

Interested applicants should send a resume and cover letter to:

Why don’t you take a second, click on this post, and see what I can do for you!",19,5,4,http://www.reddit.com/r/forhire/comments/sayz0/for_hire_howdy_im_looking_for_weekend_work_in/,"Hello! Allow me to introduce myself: my name is Jon and, like the title of this post states, I am looking for weekend work in Albuquerque.


“Well that’s awfully vague.  What kind of work? What are your skills? Why should I hire you?”


Good questions! 


Let me tell you about my work history and education so you have a better understanding of who I am, what I can do for you, and what kind of work I am interested in.


First, I was lucky to receive a great education - I have BA from the University of New Mexico with a double major in English and Philosophy.  The pursuit of this degree helped me to develop great writing techniques, superb critical thinking skills, and an appreciation for the 
importance of time management.


Secondly, I have a varied and interesting work history.  Most recently, I was employed as a manager and bartender at one of Albuquerque’s premier nightclubs and also as the general manager at the number one music venue and restaurant in Santa Fe.  My success in the entertainment and hospitality field stems from three things: my superb customer service approach, my loyalty to the organizations I work for, and my outstanding communication skills.


Before my work as a manager and a bartender, I spent some time as a bicycle courier in London.  This work demanded that I possess the ability to work independently, required me to meet absolutely critical deadlines, and necessitated that I always take the initiative.  Because I was able to consistently demonstrate these skills, I quickly became the number one courier for the firm that I rode for.


In addition to my time in the bar and my tenure on the bicycle, I have also worked as a copy-writer for an SEO firm, warehouse clerk at a casino, banquet cook, and more.  As you can see from this diverse work and education history, I am the kind of person who loves to try new things and learn new skills – in fact, that might be my most valuable attribute for any employer: I just really enjoy learning.


Currently, I am working to start my own bicycle courier company in Albuquerque.  This is another exciting chapter of my career history – I now have the chance to create something from the ground up, learn the skills to make it run, and watch as it, I hope, blossoms.  However, being an optimistic entrepreneur still leaves me with weekends free and I would like to fill that time by working for you!


So, if you need someone to fill that weekend entry-level or management shift at your store; if you need someone to knock out a couple hundred words worth of copy on weekends; if you need someone to run errands, walk the dogs, clean your shop, or wait tables at your restaurant – I could be just the guy you’re looking for!


Warmest regards and I look forward to hearing from you!

I analyze team requirements and workflows, then show you how to produce twice the work for half the cost while actually reducing staff stress *and* maintaining (or improving!) quality. I've collectively saved companies around twenty million dollars with this approach.

My advantage over other business analysts and consulting groups is that I don't, by default, charge per time unit. I therefore have no stake in stretching out a consultation or improvement for weeks or months. I do, however, have a stake in doing things right and doing them effectively. Consequently, I'll be available as long as you need me, at no cost to you.

I don't charge for meetings, or initial consultations, or basic analysis. They're freebies. Anything that is charged, or paid for up front or during the analysis process, becomes a 150% discount on the final invoice, so it's in my own interest to keep upfront costs low. And while I prefer working purely on commission, that's negotiable too.

In your own case, you have at least one team of six or more people whose duties and job descriptions are largely identical, and most of their work is both mental (administrative, scheduling, troubleshooting, customer service etc) and piecemeal (between five and five hundred items per day per person, one after another).

On average, I will be able to cut your running costs by 30% or more in two to four weeks. 50% is not uncommon, and I have achieved up to 80% in larger organizations with long-running teams.

I'm based out of gloriously sunny Perth, in Western Australia, but as I can operate anywhere with a hotel room and laptop, I can be onsite in 48 hours. And yes, I'm happy to telecommute or Skype if that's your preference.

The code is not incredibly difficult to wade through although most of it is 5 or 6 years old. You'll have the opportunity at some point in the future to rewrite from scratch as well.

They have a flexible schedule and benefit packages are average. SOME work from home, but of course we have that one douchebag who lives it up charging 40 hours of Farmville...I mean WORK so you have to prove yourself trustworthy.

 - Junior: $60-$80k, 3+ years java experience
 - Senior: $85-$120k, 5+ years java experience

The qualifications are being a decent Java developer and not being an ass. Experience valued over degree, examples of work are super-dee-duper.

There is a technical interview on the phone and it's pretty standard. I do the in person tech interview with another guy, my questions are pretty standard and more geared toward creative than definitions like the phone interview.

Our company's HR has only passed along 5 resumes in the last two months for these positions, so I was given the go ahead to see if there were more people out there. Contact me through PMs which I will check throughout the day/week if you're up for it.

I'm almost an Industrial Engineer (I'm on the last year, and I can prove it if you need me to) and I need some money to finish my studies. I can't apply for a scholarship because my parents are too rich, so I don't qualify, but they disowned me (there should be an exemption for this but Spanish bureaucracy is a joke and all the scholarships are public here, there's nobody to turn to). I have absolutely no professional (as in paid) experience. There's a big depression here and it's very hard to find a job. To make things worse people here is very sexist, when it comes to the artistic aspect everybody seems to assume girls can be very creative but they also think that I will be stuck if there's a technical challenge, or that we can't be good programmers, or that we don't like to learn new things. (Which isn't true, I love to tinker and try new stuff). Please understand that I'm just justifying why I have no experience, I'm not asking for charity or anything just because I'm a girl. I know I won't have any problem with that when I get my degree, but for the kind of companies that hire freelance web designers here it seems to be an issue. Other reason it's hard to find a job is that nepotism is out of control in Spain. Everybody knows somebody and that's how people get jobs. I don't know anybody, though, and my parents' contacts are no good cause they don't talk to me. I've tried freelance sites but the competition is overwhelming for a person without paid experience. (All my experience is doing things for practice, personal projects, school projects, and mainly coding and maintaining websites for WoW guilds and stuff like that.)

Here is my rant: I'm currently working in inventory planning for a major corporation and after my temp agency's commission I make TWELVE dollars an hour. I was temped for data entry and after they realized how smart I was they gave me harder and harder work. No other temps do the type of work I am doing (maintaining inventory levels, creating purchase orders on a very large scale,etc), and I am told daily that soon I will get hired full time with benefits. I'm tired of waiting, Reddit! I stopped going out for lunch and have accepted working a 9 hour day to get paid for 8. I do not complain about these things but I am looking for a job where my hard work will correlate to my salary. I do not want to be discriminated on by my age (24) or experience, cause quite frankly I am very smart and adaptable to almost every imaginable situation. So trust me, I would make a great addition to your team too!

Here is my sales pitch: I have B.A.s in accounting and history from Rutgers College. I'm well rounded. I can find adapt to working in many departments of many different types of businesses. I'm a hard worker. I'm efficient. I am excellent with numbers and visualize them in a way I cannot describe. I tend to get along well with people. People tend to get along well with me. I know how to keep my work life and my personal life separate. I listen, I communicate, and I am not afraid to speak my mind or ask questions. I proritize work, and working on challenging projects makes me feel rewarded. I will work for a lesser salary than people with experience ask for. I'm a fast learner. After I learn something once, I will repeat the task faster the next time. I am always looking for ways to improve at my methods of doing work. I'm well above average intelligence.

**World's laziest video game studio.**

Well, this one is pretty easy. We make games for mobile and handheld platforms, and have a console title planned for late 2012. Previously, our titles were mostly of the casual pick up and play persuasion, nowadays? Soul crushing 80+ hour RPG's.

We're looking for artists of both a concept and level based nature (think of beautiful 2D sprites, then make it sexier) as well as for people who want to get involved with the character sprite creation process.

We also want people who can make sexy music. If you couldn't beat Nobuo Uematsu in a jamming session, then you're not what we want.

This entity is a UK based LTD entity, but we're open to remote hiring for it (as well as on-site).


**The most awesome IT solutions company in the world.**

This company has been around for 14 months and whilst previously dealing with the horrible world that is corporate development and hosting (the clients list is pretty impressive), it's now moving in to the end user market. It's got long term contracts and money to burn, so expansion is coming!

It's an IT infrastructure company similar to giffgaff in the way that it rewards user for contributing. Basically, help a user with a support question? Get free money. It also provides numerous next generation services such as cloud based Zend Framework systems (think Heroku for Zend), hosted NoSQL solutions (Couch, Mongo, e.t.c) and other sexy things.

Now, what are we hiring here? Sales and support, mostly. There's also a marketing manager position available, but we're already interviewing 7 people for this role later in the week. We need both basic support (derp answer ticket derp) and people who are essentially kick ass Linux administrators who think the people at Rackspace and co would be better off sticking to a calculator.

Sales is simple enough, sell things; drum up sales. You'll get basic plus commission, nice and easy.

Oh, we're also recruiting a PA to essentially be management's slave for both of the afore-mentioned companies.

Now, beyond all of this - we're not too fussed if you don't have experience or are still in college. If we can train you to be f'n awesome, that's better for us in the long run, right? So, apply now!


**Big scary telco.**

This one is simple, recruiting PHP and API developers for a major UK telco. On-site London based project, £300 - £350 per day including agency rates.

I don't have many marketable skills, but I'm a damn good writer. This is all I can do, and I'll do it until I have carpal tunnel if I can make a difference.

Supported and mentored by our growing network of 1,000+ local and global business leaders, these entrepreneurs have created over 200,000 high-value jobs and generate more than $5 billion in annual revenues.

For more information on our model, please visit: [endeavor.org/model/ourmodel](http://endeavor.org/model/ourmodel)

Below is a more formal job description/posting. If this is something you would be interested in, please get in touch with me at bmoztalay(at)tabusnine(dot)com.



The main responsibilities will include Android/iOS app development in a small team, producing clean and maintainable code, and meeting clients' development needs.

Code reviews and semi-daily planning sessions will be part of the development cycle, just to make sure everything stays on track.

A good sense of humor and the ability to adapt to new platforms and situations is a big plus. We'll be introducing you to new tools and methodologies

She is my hero, and her track record with local law enforcement and national children's protective organizations speaks to the truth of this statement.

If you are a recent graduate, you must demonstrate real-world Java or web development (JQuery, CSS, etc) knowledge to be considered. Thanks!

**What we do**

We develop 911 emergency and public safety software. Our software revolutionizes the way emergency first responders receive calls, react, and deliver critical emergency services to the public. We believe that by applying innovation to the public safety sector, we can make a difference in people’s lives. Our products include next generation VoIP 911 communication (voice, sms text, and video), computer-aided dispatch, GPS enabled mobile units for fire/police/EMS, maps and live data delivery, police and fire post incident management/investigations, and data mining/reporting.

**How we do it**

We believe in agile software development. Our well defined and efficient processes are backed by the best tooling we can find. Some of the tools we use include JIRA, GreenHopper, FishEye, Confluence, SpiraTest, Balsamiq, Subversion, and Jenkins. We believe in continuous integration, unit testing, and automated testing. We like clean code.

Developer happiness is important to us. Work areas are quiet, spacious, window-facing, and all developers get fast boxes with dual 24” monitors. We have our own development lab to run load tests or bask in the warm hum of the server racks. Our systems engineers ensure that production issue distractions are kept to a minimum. Our QA group keeps us in check and even helps with the automated testing.

**What we’re looking for**

We’re looking for people passionate about software development. If you have side projects, contribute to open source, or enjoy reading about and discussing technology, then you sound like a great fit. We believe a strong foundation of data structures, algorithms, and design patterns is important. Our product line covers many diverse development areas such as distributed soa, web, backend, mobile, maps/gis, databases, caching, reporting, data indexing, and high availability. Each of these areas in a mission critical environment contains their own unique and difficult problems to solve. As such, a strong foundation coupled with the desire to learn, grow, and solve hard problems would make for a strong addition to our team.

**Junior Developer**

You have the passion and are ready for a challenge but are still getting started with less than a few years experience. You have exposure to some of the technologies listed, and are very eager to learn more while becoming stronger in the areas you already know. 

**Mid-Level Developer**

You are a seasoned developer with 2 to 5 years experience that can solve tough problems. You’re strong in at least one area of the software stack and are eager to expand into others. You are familiar with best practices and know how to write clean code.

**Senior Developer**

You are a very strong developer with over 5 years of experience. You are adept at breaking down and solving very complex and difficult problems. You’ve been exposed to most areas in the software stack and very strong in a few of them. You’re able to learn and integrate new technologies independently. You enjoy mentoring and guiding the more junior engineers.

**Technologies and Frameworks**

All of our developers have the freedom to pick the best tools to solve the problem at hand. Some specific technologies we like to use include Java 6 (soon to be 7), Spring, JPA/Hibernate, EHCache, PostgreSQL, H2, Web Services (SOAP and REST), Asynchronous messaging, Apache Lucene/Solr/Elastic Search, Java Server Faces 2, Primefaces, HTML 5, CSS 3, WebSockets, JQuery, Android, Swing, TestNG, Selenium, Maven, JasperReports, Jython, Bash, Geoserver, OpenLayers.

There was a post asking for the ability 2 years ago, but still nothing.

We are on extremely limited bandwidth and testing rar vs 7z the difference is enough to save month on bandwidth overages if we can reduce the uploads even more.

As it currently stands, you can submit a file containing a list of files to be archived as such

    ""C:\Program Files\7-Zip\7zG.exe"" a -mx9 C:\test.7z @C:\fileList.txt

If those files are in the following format, they will only backup the file.exe and none of the directory structure.

    C:\Program Files......\file.exe

BUT if you remove the C:\ portion, the entire structure is saved accordingly. That, unfortunately does not solve the issue 100% because we have files just like the one above on other drive letters, and since the backup is completely relative there is no way to me to backup both identically named folders on drive C and E and keeping the structure inside the archive separated.

Could i do two 7z files, yes but i think this is something a lot of people that want to use 7-Zip could benefit from.

1. Is is possible? I use 7zG.exe via command line (so i get the gui view) so a switch would be best to trigger the full-path ability.
2. How much and how long to implement?
3. I would request it be submitted to 7-Zip if they would be willing to implement it.

Thoughts and ideas on other ways to implement this are welcomed. If anyone knows it's possible and can give me a quote, PM please.

Równość rozumiemy w takim znaczeniu, iż my wszyscy otrzymujemy taką samą szansę wykazania się naszą błyskotliwością i również sami myjemy nasze filiżanki po kawie. Preferujemy współpracę z ludźmi, którzy regularnie robią jedno i drugie. Szansa oznacza, że Państwa głos może być skutecznie brany pod uwagę. Dajemy szansę, by się uczyć. Dajemy szansę, by nauczać. Nadzwyczajność stanie się jednak faktem, dla tych, którzy będą robić jednocześnie te wszystkie trzy rzeczy. Specjalnie podkreślany to w szczególny sposób, gdyż nie bylibyśmy tym, czym jesteśmy, gdybyśmy nie wierzyli w ogromny potencjał naszych pracowników. Naszym pracownikom pomagamy także w ich czasie wolnym: jeśli sądzicie Państwo, że macie właśnie TEN pomysł na kolejnej generacji web 2.0, to proszę dać nam znać, a my zrobimy wszystko, aby pomóc Państwu w realizacji swojej wizji. 


Lokalizacja:

W Krakowie odkryliśmy nie tylko potencjał ekonomiczny, ale także licznych utalentowanych ludzi i chcielibyśmy poszerzyć nasz zespół o tak wielu błyskotliwych programistów i projektantów, ilu tylko uda nam się znaleźć. Nasze nowe biura mieszczą się w Krakowskim Parku Technologicznym. Krakowski Park Technologiczny oddalony jest od centrum miasta o 15 minut jazdy jedną, bezpośrednią linią tramwajową (linia numer 10). W bezpośrednim sąsiedztwie znajdują się również inne młode firmy oraz przedsiębiorstwa bazujące na działalności internetowej, tak więc można mieć nadzieję, że w przyszłości na tym obszarze powstanie silna wspólnota developerska.

My buddy and I have all but finishing an application and we are looking for someone to assist us with the vision of the graphical aspect of the app.

**Background**

You can check us out at [Bromance Labs](http://www.bromancelabs.com) for a better description of who we are and what we're up to.
 
*TL;DC (didn't click):* We just two lowly, helpdesk dudes that like to code on our spare time and would like to get some projects off the ground but we can't design/draw for crap.

**The Current App Project**

Long story, short - it's a sleep calculator that tells you optimum times to go to bed or wake up.

**The Job**

We are looking for someone to hire either freelance for this specific project or as a long term freelancer as a ""creative director"" of sorts. We are working our tutorial and we'd like it to be heavily graphical to engage our users. There's also some other app specific designs we're looking to implement. The ideal person would be able to respond to emails or phone calls in a timely fashion!

**Compensation**

I have NO IDEA what the going rate for something like this is. We are two tight budgeted people, but we understand the value of the work we are asking for. So all the dough is coming straight out of our bank accounts from our budgets from a meager salary. But we're happy to do it for someone who has the same enthusiasm as we do, someone that's proud of their work! Additionally, all your work will be credited. Heck, we'd put you on our website if you let us.

We don't need portfolios (talented amateurs welcome), you don't need to know any code, you can do your work from anywhere, you don't even need to have a website. A computer with email, a phone and whatever design tools you have is fine by us. We're looking for someone whom we could potentially partner up with for more work (such as graphical web site tweaks, branding, other apps) but if you're just looking for a single job to do for right now, that's fine, too.

I am a busy photographer in need of two or three editors. You will be editing wedding shots 90% of the time.


I am looking for someone with experience, who considers themselves to be ""good"" at post processing. You will be working mostly out of light room, however some photoshop will also need to be done, so you will need to have the appropriate software (preferably CS 5 and lightroom 3).


I am going to pay **$125.00** per wedding. you will have approx 600 images to edit and you will have a weeks time to do it. WITH THAT SAID, the editing I require is fairly simple, as I personally will handle the other ""time consuming"" edits from the wedding. the 600 or so edits you will be asked to do take me around 8-10 hrs to do, therefore, I am technically paying around $13.00 /hr (and remember, you will have a whole week to get them done.). Also, after you have edited 3 weddings for me, your rate will go up to **$150.00** per wedding.


The reason I can do 600 edits in 8 hrs is because I A) know what I am doing, and B) I have presets, ect that help speed up the process. I also do small batch edits. If you don't know what I'm talking about, or you think there is still no way you can tackle 600 QUALITY edits in 8-10 hrs, then this position is probably not for you.


Please message me telling me about yourself and your background. I will contact the people I'm interested in and ask for samples of your work. We will then go from there.

If we end up working together, you will be payed under the table.

We work with a small team of writers who earn a 20% royalty on all published material. We have an established record, which can be proven on request. 

What we want:
1) Talented ENGLISH writers
2) Reliable writers with excellent grammar and spelling
3) 2 - 3 stories per week
4) 5000 - 6000 word stories
5) Long term partnerships

What we offer:
1) 20% net Royalty based payment after fees
2) Full graphic design and ongoing marketing of your book
3) Publishing worldwide on Amazon.com and other markets
4) Translation into most popular languages of your stories
5) Recording of audio for audio books based on your content
6) Life time residual royalties from ALL your work

We have places open on our team, after an awesome Christmas. We experienced excellent growth, and had THREE best sellers in our portfolio, resulting in hundreds of sales for us and our authors. We can take a book from a standing start to average 1.6 sales a day within 14 days. Usually, its more like 3 sales per day average. You can expect a residual 20% of $2.79 for your works.

We will send you an author royalty agreement, which should be signed and returned. As soon as we receive this, you can start submitting work. We then design a cover and begin selling your work within 48hrs. We produce audio books and translate your book. We then begin promoting and marketing worldwide.

We can put you in touch with our other authors, and provide proof of earnings if required.

Thanks!

NOTE: We occasionally have paid work available for one off works. Let us know if this is of interest too.

EDIT:
Our authors get 20% after fees. Meaning Amazon, Apple iBookstore and such have delivery/royalty fees in place which are paid before we get a penny. Amazon, for example, charge $0.01 for delivery + 30% on our $3.99 and $2.99 books. Our authors are paid on the net royalties after paying such fees. Hope that clarifies...

___________________________
Today was the last day of my 6 month contract. It was rather uneventful. Most of my time was spent in meetings or on putting all of the work I've been doing up on the server. Throughout the day, I've had to step out for a few minutes to field callbacks from recruiters (I have now lost track of how many I have contacted- but it's a lot). Things have gone fairly well on that front. I now have 2 interviews lined up for Monday, and 2 meetings with recruiters. I'll be hot footing it all over the city of Chicago throughout the day, peddling my abilities as a designer.
___________________________
Today I did something I hadn't ever done before when leaving a job- I wrote a thoughtful thank you email to everyone I have worked with in the past 6 months. I kept it rather general, but bullet pointed some of the specific people I wanted to recognize for excellent collaborative skills. I included a link to [my linkedin profile](http://www.linkedin.com/in/danieldallen) as well as my cell and gchat information. I told them that it was looking probable that I will end up back in the city for work and if they were ever out there to text me and we'd meet up for lunch.
___________________________
This already paid off as I got a couple of linkedin requests and one of my coworkers sent me an email with some potential job listings. Relationships pay off. I will also be tapping into this group of people for referrals that I can put on my linkedin profile and portfolio.
___________________________
While I have had a few rocky times during my contract, I have forged a number of strong relationships here that I hope to take with me into the future years. Who knows? I may end up getting a job a few years down the line because I was willing to take the time to write a meaningful thank you email.
___________________________
In about 20 minutes I'm going to be heading down to the bar where some of my coworkers said they planned on buying me a drink or two. That's pretty fantastic. I may be out of work, but I'm not out of friends.
___________________________
So much for sleep. I will be waking up bright and early on Monday to embark on my next job hunting journey. It would be nice to take some time off and catch up on Z's, but job hunting is a job that requires relentless, tireless dedication. You can't stop- can't even take a breath until you're employed again.

Only a day and a half now of work and I'll be back on the market. The agency owner got back to me today via email and I will be on an interview with him and his CTO on Monday afternoon. That means I'll be on 2 agency interviews and one real interview the next business day after being out of work. Don't want to waste any time!
__________________________________
I slacked off last night and didn't get my business cards done. I'll probably end up paying for it in shipping costs to get them overnighted to me, but it will be worth it to go into an interview with business cards.
__________________________________
Something else interesting happened today: I got paid some money for my work on [Reddit Enhancement Suite](http://redditenhancementsuite.com). We ask for donations for the work that we do and I got a cut of our most recent round of donations. It wasn't a terrible lot- but will at least help me make my transition into unemployment. I don't plan on being unemployed long enough to collect unemployment, so a few bucks to make the transition easier is nice. Goes to show that side work can pay off. The amount wasn't high- but the timing was perfect, so it all worked out.

I'm looking to hire someone with a solid foundation in networking and Linux to help perform support for our ISP billing/network management product (www.powercode.com)

You need to be able to handle managing Linux servers (e.g. you should know how to find a file on the operating system, use a package manager, find a process using the most CPU time, use vim/emacs/some other editor, know how to check where a partition is being mounted) as well as understand some basic networking (Layer2 vs Layer3, basic subnetting, TCP vs UDP, ports, switching vs routing, etc)

Short term, you'd be supporting our customers, helping customers implement our product into their network, etc.

Long term, there is potential to move into a development position if that's something that interests you or software testing, a management role, development of our router product or something else. We're a pretty loose team from the perspective of responsibility - if you are interested in doing something, you'll have the opportunity to do it here.

Other useful skills (but not required) to have would be:

* Some knowledge of PHP/MySQL
* Bash scripting ability
* Cisco/Mikrotik/other router configuration experience
* Prior experience in the wireless ISP industry

What I'm *really* looking for is someone that enjoys this kind of work - if you sit at home messing with Arduino boards, building websites, installing Linux for fun or building home networks, I want to talk to you.

Pay range is negotiable but will be something like 15-20$ an hour depending on experience. If you have additional skills to offer, hit me up with your salary requirements and let's talk. We do offer insurance, 401k and other benefits. We're a profitable, solid company in no danger of disappearing.

I still have bills to pay though - and even though my girlfriend says she will support me - my machismo won't let me do that. As well, I am not fond on tapping my savings.

So here is my offer. I would like to give myself to someone as a personal assistant, an office admin, a computer guru (I can do your networking, run Cat5e cable, fix the spyware and make everything generally better), your companies online marketing, web design, a part time sales person or whatever. The key is - I need 25 hours a week at $20/hr. I'd prefer to work 8 am to 1 PM M-F (I don't take breaks - just need coffee and classical music - or some opera). And if I was working in Western Broward near Commercial - that'd be great - but I am flexible. I am presentable - especially when I am clean shaven, and have a great phone voice. The largest deal I've ever closed was for $2.75 million a month for 18 months. As well, I babysit. :-)

You'd be giving me a great freedom to chase my dream - and I'd be giving you a damn awesome tool to apply as you see fit.

1306024347.0,16,self.forhire,hh017,[For Hire] Recent Law School Graduate,17,1,5,http://www.reddit.com/r/forhire/comments/hh017/for_hire_recent_law_school_graduate/,"Greetings,

My name is Kash, I recently graduated from law school. I am looking for a job in the legal industry, preferably as a Law Clerk or Legal Assistant. Of course, I am open to other positions that fit my skill set. While I would prefer a position in Orange County, I am open to the possibility of relocating to anywhere else within California. 

**Experience**

I have worked for two solo practitioners as a Law Clerk. The first specialized in bankruptcy law, and the second specialized in transactional/business law and estate planning/probate law. At both of these positions I performed legal research, drafted briefs and memos, managed documents, assisted in client interviews and performed other administrative work. 

I was an extern at California Superior Court, Orange County in the summer after my 1L year. There I conducted legal research on search and seizure and other constitutional issues, discussed pending cases and rulings on both criminal and civil matters with judges, and attended all court proceedings. I had the opportunity to shadow two judges during the summer, as opposed to the one judge most externs get to shadow. 

I was a Research Assistant for the Department of Political Science back in college. My research focused primarily on demographics and immigration patterns that would be used by the Governor for his then upcoming trip to India. 

I have assisted my family in forming a food services company. We started with a restaurant and banquet facility, quickly growing into one of the largest caterers for Indian/Pakistani food in the Northeast. Within the last few years, we have been focusing on a line of frozen food. We sell the products across the entire country and can barely keep up with the demand. I assisted in reviewing, drafting, and modifying most of the relevant contracts, and I orchestrated the design and launch of the company's website. 

**Education**

I just received my Juris Doctorate, where I also earned a Certificate in Intellectual Property. I graduated college with a major in Political Science, and minors in English and Psychology. I spent the first two years of college on a Pre-Med curriculum; I have taken courses in Biology, Chemistry, Organic Chemistry, Physics, and all of their respective labs. 

At law school, I was on the boards of several student organizations, most notably the Student Bar Association. In college, I helped form a new student organization that focused on philanthropic work. I believe this showcases my leadership ability and that I am a highly personable individual.
 
**Skills**

I have LexisNexis Professional Research Certification. I can speak Urdu/Hindi and have a rudimentary grasp of Spanish (I am learning to become more proficient in Spanish). As a Redditor, I also have above average computer skills (though of course, nowhere near as advanced as many Redditors).
