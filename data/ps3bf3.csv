I believe recons who selflessly set up SOFLAMs - so that their fellow engineers teammates can get massive amounts of points with Javelin hits - should be better rewarded, let's say a 100 points per successful Javelin-related vehicle/player kills. Sometimes I will play a whole conquest round as a recon and set up SOFLAMs which result in maximum team joy, but puts me in the bottom of the scoreboard with like 1-2 kills and like 900 pts (most of the points were gotten from capping flags to get great SOFLAM locations, e.g. very top of C on Kharg Island, hehehe).

2. Spotters should get more than 10pts a spot. 25 pts would be a better reward and would encourage more people to spot. It would also increase the SOFLAM usage as it is also a great spotting tool.

1333632635.0,133,self.ps3bf3,rukp7,"How to play hardcore, and why you should. [x-post from r/Battlefield3]",149,16,44,http://www.reddit.com/r/ps3bf3/comments/rukp7/how_to_play_hardcore_and_why_you_should_xpost/,"If you've never given hardcore a decent shot, you're missing out.  Dice didn't just remove stuff and lower health, they carefully considered their choices. Just about everything in hardcore is cleverly designed to make the game more realistic, less random, and more rewarding of teamwork.  Here are a few things to remember when going into the fray:

**1. Friendly Fire:** No more magically shooting through your team mates head! If you shoot a team mate, they go down like anyone else. This may sound like a pain in the ass, but it changes everything about how you control your sectors.  You can't randomly toss grenades into crowded rooms (no grenade spam!), you can't casually run into contested hallways, and you can't just blow up and entire building filled with team mates in hopes of catching that one guy you know is in there somewhere.  Everything you do has to be considered a little more carefully, and your whole team has to always be aware of their fields of fire.  No matter what you do, you are going to have team mates who run right into a grenade you just tossed, or run right into a hallway you're firing down.  Don't worry -- they'll learn soon :)

**2. Deadlier Gunfights:** Even with body armor, it shouldn't take 7 bullets at medium range to put someone on the ground.  In HC, whoever first gets a bead on their target generally wins the gunfight.  A miss is a miss, so spraying wildly still doesn't work.  Winning your firefights will take skill and control.  What you *don't* have are those goofy dances of death where both people hop around around at close range while unloading a full clip, then a pistol clip, then start knifing (OK so I'm exaggerating, but you know it happens).  You can, however pop around a corner that has three or four people on the other side, and spray them down in one volley if you take them unaware, which you should be able to.  Just make sure you're not spraying into team mates!

**3. No 3d Spotting:**  In hardcore, spotting enemies still puts them on the mini map and calls out an audio cue (""Be advised, tank spotted in your AO"", etc.), but it no longer fills your screen with little orange triangles to shoot at.  By now, you may be accustomed to firing at those helpful little doritos, and the thought of not having them might freak you out, but this is actually a very good thing for several reasons.  First, it makes the audio cues much more important, and less like background chatter.  When you hear there's a tank in your area, you damn well start looking around for it frantically.  It also rewards people for using mics to communicate enemy movements and positions.  You will find a much higher percentage of people using mics to communicate on HC servers, and good teamwork is what makes BF3 great.  Lastly, *you* don't have a dorito floating over your head all the damn time.  Remember, those spotting triangles actually *follow* you around, they don't just give the position you occupied at the time you were spotted.  This isn't only unrealistic, it's incredible annoying.  You might not realize it, but there are probably a tremendous number of times you've been taken out because some yahoo could magically see what side of the rock you were going to pop out of -- likely from across the map.

**4. No HUD:**  This isn't a huge deal, but it does clean up the screen.  Your health info, targeting recticle/shotgun circle, and other small things don't appear on screen in front of you. This gives a surprising boost to the immersion factor (especially when combined with the absence of flying doritos).  Rather than thinking: I'm at ""42.57 percent health"" (whatever that means), you start thinking in terms of ""I'm hurt, I need a freaking medic.""  And you *will* need to find a medic when you get hurt, since health does not magically regenerate on its own.  Fear not, though, because people tend to be listening and watching more carefully in HC, so find yourself a medic and press that select/back/q key.  Or even better, call out for one over your mic.   They'll come running.

**Final Thoughts:**  While it may take a little getting used to, playing in HC can be a more rewarding experience than softcore.  It encourages and rewards teamwork, and makes you think and move more deliberately.  If you haven't given it a decent shot yet, give it a try -- especially if you got into Battlefield because you were looking for something a little more ""tactical"" or ""realistic"" than the other shooters out there.  Try to find a squad that's talking -- it makes all the difference.  Use a mic if you can, and if not, listen to your squadmates and work together.  Have fun out there.

**Edit:** Someone mentioned something that I completely forgot about, but LOVE (though I think it's a preference thing, really). I drives me crazy in Softcore that the guy in the tank can magically see a ten foot radius in all directions around him. No outside view for vehicles makes it possible to sneak up behind a tank and plant C4 (which is so satisfying), or run past behind them when they're facing the other way. Same goes for jets, etc. We've even successfully pulled off running people out as decoys to get the tank's attention while someone else plants the C4 and blows the sucker to bits. Teamworkgasm.  I can see how that would be aggravating for people *in* the tank, and why some wouldn't like it, but low mobility/visibility seems to be the trade off for armor and firepower.

I will keep the server private for a few days to see how it goes.  It's currently unranked too.  

I have rented it for a month, in order to allow for us to raise funds if needed or wanted.  It's hosted in Europe (sorry USA &amp; Canada) but let's discuss further options for second servers if and when we decide to go there.

Right now the map rotation is just the basic combination of Rush / Conquest.  I will tweak the settings later, when I get back from work.

Any suggestions for settings, please leave them here.

That is all.

I know there were mixed view on this as some people can't access their laptop, PC, or use their smartphone -- but for many of you, this is gonna solve a lot of problems. Even if DICE does fix the in-game chat, this is still a great way to organize yourselves before getting out there. Hey, you can even start meeting members of *other* platoons, exchange PSN IDs, and GO GO GO!

1. **DOWNLOAD TEAMSPEAK:** [For your laptop, PC, Mac, Android or iPhone.](http://www.teamspeak.com/?page=downloads) I have personally used the PC version on my laptop and the Android Beta and they are both excellent. The phone version, however, lacks text chatting. I do apologize that the iPhone version is paid only. 

2. **CREATE YOUR BOOKMARK:** In the setup, input *ps3bf3ts.dyndns.org* as the server. The password for the server is *redditisfun* If you have any trouble server address, you can input the IP directly: *66.172.10.107*

3. **FIND A CHANNEL:** The main lobby is called *The Kitchen Sink.* After this, each *BF3 Platoon* has their own lobby and 6 different subchannels (*Alpha - Foxtrot)* for different squads/games. After this, several other games played by members of rdt clan have a specific channel. The Void is another lobby. More like the back room. Heh. 

Let [me](http://www.reddit.com/user/shane_solo) or 
[WhyUNoCompile](http://www.reddit.com/user/WhyUNoCompile) know if you have any issues or feel any extra channels need to be added.

**4.** Rub gf's back gently while show is playing, and talk to her soothingly so she is slowly and happily lulled to sleep. If all else fails pretend you want to make out (trust me she should be too tired by then).
**5.** Once gf is asleep, turn on PS3 and begin playing BF3, being mindful to keep your voice and headset sound low in the first 15min so as not to wake her up from early sleep.

The patch had just come out and I came onto your empty and unranked server to test all the weapons, attachments etc. You were running Norshair Canals, one of my favourite maps and a great place to have a little alone time.

Spawning as US to use the carrier as my platform, I emptied countless magazines to come to terms with the revised mechanics. Each time I ran out of ammo, I'd hop into one of the littlebirds to hone those skills, and you know, fuck around doing ""stunts"".

After about an hour, you, the server host, joined me on the desolate map as Russian. I was standing on the carrier deck as I heard the faint sound of another helicopter. You came flying over, I thought my time was up. But as you came closer I realized that no attack was imminent, so I gave you all the greetings I could give, meaning a few ill-animated jumps and a toss of my medkit.

You gave me a friendly wave with the tail of your helo and went back towards the Russian camp, doing whatever. But I knew we had an understanding, if I could've I would have gladly invited you over to my ""testing site"".

All was well in our merry land, when a friend of mine came to join up. He's still fairly new to BF3 and knows just about nothing of the basics, so I thought it would be a great place to show him some things and give some dearly needed flying lessons. I had just crashed my littlebird trying to go through the warehouse buildings at the shorefront and was walking around aimlessly on the mainland. While in the process of directing my buddy to pick me up with the other bird, I failed to realise the situation that was brewing up. You had made your way towards the US side in your helo, maybe to say hello to the new arrival, and I could see the two of you ""meeting"" right overhead. Standing there, I could only watch as you exploded, thanks to my slightly clueless friend. At that moment, I knew the fun really was over. 

By the time we got back to the US base you had reappeared in your heli and shot both of us down, right before banning us. I didn't even have the will to fight back.

With all the hate hosts are getting, I just wanted to take the time to say I'm sorry for not properly instructing my friend on our cease-fire agreement. Because I can't access the battle report, if there even was one, don't know your name or the server's, this is really all I got. 

I was your guest and ruined the party. Sorry.",,False,self,t5_2sbem,False,,Europe,True,t3_rsz8p,http://www.reddit.com/r/ps3bf3/comments/rsz8p/maybe_itll_reach_you/,

Without making myself sound like too much of a sad bastard and without getting too personal, the last year has mostly been me, alone with my PS3 and my laptop, pulling the world apart and trying to see it's fabric.

I have few things constant. Arsenal is one, my friends(the ones I still choose to see/talk to), my internetz schedule and YOU GUYS.

Seriously, I have said it before, maybe too much, maybe not enough but I truly love this community. It is a daily necessity almost, to log in and see what's going down here, lol at your stories or your rants or your whiny bitch-ass posts. It gets my day started, breakfast, spliff rolled, brew on(that's tea to you Yankees) and check into rdt and my favourite sub.my day has started like that for some time now and I hope it continues to start my day because it rarely fails to make me smile in some regard.

Despite our differences, our arguments, our flaming/raging I still believe we have something really special here.
No other subs I frequent seem to have a sense of camaraderie that we have, r/gunners is a clusterfuck of seperatist factions, it seems. Here mostly we seem to sing from the same hymnsheet.

I love you all, have a great day and a better weekend. 

Thanks for making my days that little bit more awesome.

HOOAH you sexy buggers.

I tried to get back into them with Halo 3, but found I just couldn't be bothered with the endless aggro and stupidity. 

Last month I borrowed my friends PS3 while he's abroad, and got a free trial for PS+. Of course, BF3 popped up on the IGC, and I thought I'd give the singleplayer a go. Yeah, learnt my lesson there. So I thought fuck it, it's been a while, lets try multiplayer. 

Now I'm addicted all over again. Team Deathmatch providing frantic firefights in Paris, fighting to defend checkpoints in Rush while an air battle rages overhead, parachuting from a plane to capture a flag in Conquest. It's been years since I've had so much fun, and I'll be buying the premium content as soon as I can afford it. So, thanks to all the brilliant players on this game, you've restored my faith in multiplayer gaming.

Played a game on Gulf of Oman as US, not a rdt server, where the carrier was constantly camped by the jets and attack helo. 

Now, the actual game was normal, bases were captured and lost etc. But those guys just kept shooting at the vehicles on our carrier, which I grow tired of very quickly. So I spawn in a vehicle that's being shot, get out, run across the deck under fire and make it into the stationary AA. Rather than backing the fuck off, they keep doing their spiel. Bad decision, as one by one they all get taken down. Being weary, I stay put a little longer, to see if they learned their lesson, but noooooooooo, they are back as soon as they can, taking aim at me... 

Why would you do this? It's almost impossible to take out the AA, and no matter how good you think you are, flying a jet or heli straight at the damn thing isn't a viable tactic. I could actually facepalm myself with one hand while firing with the other, killing them. Hovering behind the carrier tower to hide might also seem like a good idea. It isn't. But it sure looks funny.

This kept going for the rest of the round.

I'm sorry I ruined your stupid game and got you all pissed off, but you really must be an idiot. And a bad player.",,False,self,t5_2sbem,False,,Europe,True,t3_shtg8,http://www.reddit.com/r/ps3bf3/comments/shtg8/people_base_camping_in_air_vehicles_must_really/,

*EDIT 3:  So here's how this is gonna go down.*

**Step 1** Rent a server for one week.  See how it goes. Collect data. Gather information. Sleuth about.

**Step 2** Nominate a server admin (or admins, depending)

**Step 3** Start a cash collection. Send money to nominated admin.

With the latest patch and the release of custom servers we have seen quite a change in our community that I think has really been a lot of fun. As most of you are aware we now have the option to [rent a server](http://www.battlefield.com/battlefield3/1/rent-a-server) on consoles and many users have already done so. With all the servers that people have been getting it can be hard to keep track of them all so I have been trying to think of a way to organize them. 

**I created a list for all our servers that you can view [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0AvyaWfCOnEqedE9wZ010V25HbmRDZ09GWkJrSlhEZnc#gid=0).** 

**Server owners please add your server to the list using [this form](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/viewform?formkey=dE9wZ010V25HbmRDZ09GWkJrSlhEZnc6MQ#gid=0).**

To make things simple, we are strongly encouraging owners to include ""PS3BF3"" somewhere in the title of your server so that people can easily search and find them. 

**A note to all server owners adding to the list:** Please PM me (spiralout154) your email address so that i can give you access to edit the document. We are making server owners responsible for keeping the list up to date with the correct information. Notice that in the form I have made some room for you to leave comments. If your server settings are custom or change often, just try and explain it in those comments. 

I have updated the sidebar to include the links to the server lists and eventually I will put it in the information guide.

Since so many users are renting their own servers I think this is the best we can do to try and keep it organized. I'm sure  it won't be perfect, but it should be better than trying to remember everyone's server. If you have any thoughts how to improve it just let me know. 

**Please note:** In case you didn't know, you can favorite a server by pressing ""square"" when looking at that server. I highly recommend you favorite all the reddit servers so you don't have to search for them every time.

As far as ""official"" [/r/ps3bf3](/r/ps3bf3) servers go, I don't think we really have any right now. Once this first round of rentals is about to get renewed we may discuss setting up official servers that users can help contribute money to. Right now all servers are up to the discretion of the owner. However we do suggest you try to keep a certain level of professionalism when managing your server. We want to maintain a good reputation with servers associated with our subreddit, so please make sure you follow the [EA Online Terms](https://help.ea.com/article/bf3-rules-of-conduct). While we cannot tell you how to run your server, please try and send a warning message to players before kicking them and be fair with your admin abilities. Typically the servers I have been involved with admining have kicked/banned people for repeatedly and intentionally team killing, team killing for vehicles, or deliberately spawn camping vehicles.


Overall I think these custom servers are really adding a great aspect to our community so check them out if you have not already. Happy gaming!",,False,self,t5_2sbem,False,,USACtrl,True,t3_sqobd,http://www.reddit.com/r/ps3bf3/comments/sqobd/community_update_rented_servers/,

Press x to switch to the gunner seat, deploy flares as the gunner and switch back to the driver seat. If done properly you will have lost no momentum and have dodged a rocket. Your driver flares should also reload in time to keep doing this constantly.

For anyone not knowing me - short introduction - I am Luetin and have been gaming for over 20 years now for the past 6 I've been solidly focused on fps gaming and in this last year my youtube channel has grown and grown, Ive been featured on Battlelog multiple times I work with Pixelenemy and produce a series with other large youtube players like Levelcap, Matimio, rivalX, Dcru Colin and so on.

So with that over my Question of the day is should stats be removed from FPS games (I am obviously leaning this towards BF4). Now this is a theoretical question more than anything I find it unlikely that it would actually happen, but I do think its interesting to consider and discuss. Do you think stats actually effect games negatively or is it just a useful guide to track your performance in game. I would argue personally the former and heres why. The fact that DICE actually introduced a stat reset feature pretty much immediately highlights just how much a % of the community care about their stats. I have discussed this with other people before in the community and most well established players agreed that stats for the most part are irrelevant and cause more negative impact to the game than positive.

When you get people who are obsessed with the one stat everyone never stops hearing about your KD, but also other things like accuracy, Score per minute, win loss and so on. When people focus on these things or are so concerned about them that they are terrified to take risks in game it can start to really effect the experience players have in game. You may have a real opportunity to push for an attack but half your team are just too worried about losing a couple of % from their KD. You could be in a defensive situation but people worrying about their SPM or Accuracy% wont wait around to cover a quiet area or lay down suppressing fire.

I am not in favor of removing stats completely I think an end of round summary would be nice to give people an idea of how they performed in a round. But I think the long term tracking system that has now become the norm will only continue to negatively effect how players think.

Regardless of any opinions here today though one thing I am sure of is that its here to stay as its now part of the form and function of nearly every online MP Fps release.

Look forward to your thoughts and opinions everyone, be sure to check me for more tactical/gaming videos and everything BF3 on my other media channels

Can we not enjoy the fact we get to sit smoking spliffs and drinking beers and stroking our dicks in safe, comfortable environments playing one of the greatest and lets be honest, for the PS3+Xbox, pretty fucking unbelievable games of all time, with people from all around the FOOKIN WORLD without feeling the need to get worked up about some of the things I listed in the title?
can we not workaround these things ourselves? Can we not look for another server when people are glitch exploiting?
If noobz are using M320 instead of medipacks in HC and it's pissing you off, can you not just loadout with your own and lead by example?
Can we not give DICE a break? they were untouchable when we were playing BC2
Can we not agree that with the massive influx of players new to THE SERIES is gonna cause all of the above 'problems' and if ya don't like it and are stupid enough to hang around..All I can offer is go try that silly ARMA thingy.
Imagine a BF series evolved to this day without all the FUN stuff people have come up with by being creative, playing their own way.
My most important point is EVRYONE paid the same money to play this game and if you have ever ONCE jihad'd a jeep, purposely crashed a vehicle, team-killed, not PTFO, or generally not played the game the way 'You think it should be played' you have ZERO right to question anyone else...

Deal with it...AND please please... Spare me!

enjoy what we got...it's a fucking special thing.

love y'all.

Infantrymen love machine guns. It is the life blood of the platoon and needs to be used correctly.  Taking real world tactics and applying them in BF3 seemed to work so here is some advice:  

Take a belt fed MG, I like the 240B.  Use bipod, holo or some kind of optic with an open sight picture, and extended mag or flash suppressor (comes in handy when bipod not deployed) and move with your team close to the objective.  Look for what we used to call OCOKA (pronouced ""o-coke-a""):

Observation and fields of fire: 

you know where the enemy is coming from, find a good spot with some cover, plant some well placed claymores to cover you and your teams rear or a flank. Scan your sector being mindful of where your team is.  I play HC so this is paramount. Lay down suppressing fire to corners, intersections, etc. Find their vulnerabilities and exploit them.   Where you would go if you were then enemy?  

Cover and concealment: 

Try to deploy the bipod from a kneeling position if possible.  Standing is okay too.  Having more most of your body covered will make the enemy have to get headshots to bring you down. Plus you will be able to see more than in a prone position.  On open maps going prone is easier and more beneficial than on closer ones like metro or seine.  

Obstacles: 

What will they have to move around to get to you? What is in the way of your teams advance? What direction will they have to travel to get around? Cover that area. If the enemy has to move, where will they probably go? Cover that area.  Where to enemy usually bunch up? Cover that area.  When you see a medic reviving someone, let him, them waste them both. Use 6-9 round bursts when you can.

Key terrain:

What key parts of the map will provide a good tactical advantage? A good spawn for your team closer to the objective where they wont have to waste minutes running across the map. Where will the enemy try to flank you from? Put a claymore there. 

Avenues of approach:

This is a route of travel.  Kind of repetitive but basically where will the enemy be coming from? Where will your team try to go? Cover those areas. Scanning your sector is identifying your left and right most limits and holding down everything between those two points.  Sometimes a wall or simply how far you can rotate with the bipod deployed will decide these points.  Be aware of where you cannot see.

A good machine gunner knows he needs to control his rate of fire as well.  If you're laying down hate, and a few enemy rounds hit you it will throw off your sight picture. Take your finger off the trigger button and reacquire your sight picture or get down, crawl a bit to the side and attempt to reestablish fire dominance.  When you reload GO PRONE BEHIND COVER.

BE ADVISED: making all that noise with the MG will make you the most shot at target.  But let your teammates know what you are doing and more often than not a medic will join you or stick close to keep you alive while others arm the objective.

Machine guns are referred to as the ""Life blood of the platoon"" in an infantry platoon because it is the most casualty producing weapon.  It usually will take a MG team of up to 3 men (gunner, ag, ammo bearer).  When used correctly this weapon can provide limitless advantages to your team. Finding a good spot to set up and lay suppressing fire is not camping, hiding in a corner waiting for people to run past you is.  Hope this helps.

Im sick of it and have decided I might as well cough up a few dollars to enjoy the comfort of playing the maps I payed for (I have premium and can almost never find rotations that feature B2K, AK and Aftermath)
Anyway I've been thinking about this for a few days and the only thing I see being an issue is getting the server going (the initial 15~ players) and am trying to get some players who would be willing to jump into a game with me and a few friends to kick off a server.

**RULES**

* Rush, most maps from applicable expansions.

* 100% Tickets- This will always be true, I don't want to be on the same map for 3 hours.

* No Hardcore- I don't like hardcore, sorry.

* Anything goes- there are few issues I have with this game ATM, stingers annoy the living hell out of me, but its part of the game so whatever. If you want to put C4 on a crate and blow someone up be my guest, if you're helping win you're doing it right.

The one thing that I sincerely ask of anyone playing is that you play the objective. I am one of those players who HATES losing, and even if it looks like my team can't win, ill still try to. My friends are the same way, and there is a chance that if you're being a useless scumbag camping in the attackers spawn as our tickets deplete and you are deemed useless that you'll be kicked. Making an effort counts for alot in my eyes.
Anyway if you like the idea of a rush server with map variety and no stupid rules or admins ( I cannot stress this enough, you will NEVER be kicked because you kill me, unless you glitched to do so) just drop a comment and add me on PSN. Im looking to get the server set up BEFORE END GAME, so I can add the maps to the rotation when it comes out and wont be wasting time.

I look forward to meeting and playing with you all.

It's not too hard to find weapons, but take half a sec to check what you're picking up, or you're gonna have a bad time. Ran into an actiony area only to find out I had a bolt action; you can guess the result. They're pretty varied, lots of iron sight PDWs, laser-sighted shotguns, ACOG SVD, suppressed reflex MK MOD, some submachine guns. Don't think I picked up any LMGs though, or even assault rifles. 

The XBOW is hard! 0 kills so far (some kill assists though). Only got the scoped one, hard to judge arrow drop. Tough to aim in close quarters or hit moving targets from afar. 

Most Important Thing: equip squad AMMO perk!!! Bullets are hard to come by, normally you have 2 mags' worth, with ammo perk you get 3. It makes a ton of difference, and you'll still run out quick! Next most important is grenades, similarly the diff between 2 and 1 is noticeable.",,False,self,t5_2sbem,False,,Europe,True,t3_13vzp4,http://www.reddit.com/r/ps3bf3/comments/13vzp4/after_a_few_rounds_of_scavenger/,

Anyway, I just joined this server with my friends and we were getting dominated a few maps in a row by the other team. They quit halfway through this map (at least the few who didn't leave the server anyway). 

The map was Operation Firestorm. Out of spawn, I took a tank and was just getting pretty lucky with my cannon shots hitting my intended targets. Made it up to 7-0 before I had to ditch the tank (was surrounded by three guys, one who had C4). Managed to kill two and an assist on the third for 9-0. After that, I was on foot at B and had an awesome stretch that brought me to 17-0. It included a SIGLA transport helo kill (2). My previous best kill streak was 13. 

At this point, I ran up on foot to C and jumped in the gunner seat of a non-squadmate's tank. He jumped out and ended up commandeering an enemy tank after they bailed, leaving his tank to me. My squadmate (thebigthing313) jumped in the gunner seat and we started wreaking havoc at C and B. Our other friend, SentencerOfDeath, had lost connection at the beginning of the map but was now in a different squad. I was too nervous to pause and switch squads, and ours was full. He ends up jumping in our tank, too, in the CITV seat. 

For the remainder of the 600 ticket map, we just dominated in the tank. I had a few guided kills, I took out a Jet with my cannon, etc. It was unreal. I've never had this kind of luck before. I had a few close calls with death here, too -- in my ground streak, I had been down to 2% at one point. Our tank team had the tank down to 30% at one point, too, but we repaired it. I've just never done this. I was so nervous at the end. Some jackass on their team tried to jetram our tank twice to end my streak, but to no avail.

My last week has been spent trying to wrangle people into playing fairly. I have 1 rule- don't base camp. It happens when I'm not there and I come home to a message box full of complaints. It happens when I'm there, people get kicked, then I get an inbox full of insults. My w/l ratio has gone down because I'm constantly switching teams trying to communicate or turn the tides. Just look at my battlelog. I've lost 90% of the games on my server. The worst: I'm starting to hate this game.

People want CQ, Rush, TDM, high tickets, low tickets, etc.


What I've learned: 

1. You can't please all the people all of the time so don't even try.

2. NO ONE will follow the rules. Kick people for not following the rules and they will send you messages like ""F U KID."" As I approach 30, this makes me laugh but it's shitty, too.

3. Very few people will appreciate that you have laid out cash so that you and they can play together.


I am pretty fuckin close to just letting this server die or make it completely private. FUCK!

EDIT: Wow. That was quite cathartic and your messages- well, thank you. I really wanted to contribute to the BF3 community as a whole. One of my highlights on my server was turning over the coveted chopper to a kid who sounded like he was 10. It was awesome to see how much he enjoyed it. THAT is what I love about gaming. Joy and sharing joy with others- and shooting faces. You know what I mean. I just wish that the community, as a whole, would share the same sentiment. I think fair play is a big part of that.

**[INTRODUCTION]** This is basically an updated version of my former guide that outlines several things that I take into consideration when I play. It's been spread throughout and learned incrementally over my time playing with other players (reddit and not).  It's one thing to be a good shooter. To have good reflexes in a game like BF3 can make you a potent player to challenge, but the brawn is nothing without the brains--something that BF3 greatly rewards. This is a guide on how to conduct warfare as a squad of infantry--I am not good with vehicles at all, so don't bark up that tree. If you're wondering what makes me a man worth listening to, I can only ask you to speak to those whom I play with often. They should hopefully vouch for me. If that isn't enough, there's also my [battlelog]( http://battlelog.battlefield.com/bf3/soldier/MaKeNsHiZeR0/stats/201188001/ps3/).
&gt; The Spawning Period
Even before the bullets start flying, the war begins. Squad perks, class choice, and weapon loadout are what should be worked out here. Of course, if you're playing with/against pubbers it's not that big of a problem, but this is the period where your squad decides its play-style. Are you the frontline soldiers? Are you the Solid Snakes?

**Squad Perks** are very important in this part of the game because of their massive benefits over time. Also, squad perks only work if you spawn in on a teammate who is still alive and has it active (thanks for letting me know about this, Director_Alpha). Here my breakdown of the squad perks in terms of usefulness. Understand that even though I may disvalue some perks over others, the worth of each may change depending on the situation of the game. Change your perks accordingly.

1. Squad Sprint - When you're trying to do objectives, this perk is a must-have. The increased speed will not only let you get to the points and other fortifying positions quicker, it will also save your ass when darting to cover or escaping a losing gunfight. This should be on at all times.

2. Squad Suppress - That blurry shit that happens whenever something flies at you? This does that to everyone you shoot. It's good and it totally ruins the other person's ability to shoot. Why the hell would you NOT want this perk on?

3. Squad Cover - This should always be on. It stops your screen from getting all blurry when a pigeon shits next to you, thus allowing your character to aim better and shoot bullets that actually go where you're aiming. Do it.

4. Squad Frags - This is, to me, the most important squad perk of all the other ""Extra Ammo"" perks in the game because frags take forever to reload, and are good tools in flushing people out of cover and into your bullets. If everyone had 2x frag grenades, you can easily blow up cover, force the enemy to relocate, and cover your retreat.

5. Squad Flak - A.K.A. the perk you put on when everyone starts USAS Fragging. Regardless about how I feel about the subject (ps3bf3 is very touchy about this stuff), put this on if the enemy team is heavily engineers or USAS fraggers. It'll save you from the rage when a guy shoots into the wall 5m away from you and manages to kill you.

6. Squad Explosives - It's just squad ammo, but for your rockets. Its main benefit is if you're defending with mines, as stocking up and laying mines is already time-consuming enough. However, I still don't see much use to this besides it making life more convenient without a support.

7. Squad Ammo - This, I feel, is the most useless perk in the game. Surely, ammo comes in handy when the enemy is bearing down on you, but there is a high chance that other dead supports will be lying around somewhere. Pick up the kit, drop an ammo box, get points. You just nullified squad ammo.

**Class Loadouts** I don't really want to go into the talk about what the ""perfect"" squad makeup should be for classes right now, so we'll hopefully save that conversation for the comments or another day. Here are some important points to consider in terms of the four classes and their versatile loadouts.

1. **[ASSAULT]** - Your basic rifleman. You are the grunt who can revive people (PREFERABLY WHEN THE ENEMIES ARE ALREADY DEAD) and wields a very reliable gun. Now, the X-factor which allows variance with the assault class is with his special weapons package:

- *Grenade Launchers* are extremely useful. If not to fire quickly to blow up walls and make entrances for your team, then for killing or damaging enemies to the point where you can look at them and make them fall dead. Smokes are highly underappreciated as well, which could be used wonderfully to cause confusion with the enemy. Also, the shotgun attachments are beautiful to use when clearing out tight rooms.

- *Health Pack* are useful too. It takes a while for the auto-heal to kick in for games and if you're holding up a position behind cover, the healthpack practically adds another 30 health to your character and makes you more daunting. Think of it as how a boxer loads up after the weigh-in to a fight and comes in with extra pounds to punch with. That'd be you. This time, it's totally okay to bite off ears.

2. **[ENGINEER]** - The only anti-vehicle class that doesn't require you to Leroy Jenkins it up. Their weapons have a high firing rate and are on par with much of the assault classes.

- *RPG/Javelin/Stinger* take cars, tanks, choppers, and all that good stuff. It is your job to break those toys. These are what you use for them. Also know that RPGs are also wonderful insta-suppress on enemy positions. You don't even need to hit people with it. As long as you fire it in their general direction, you suppress them and scare the shit out of them, thus allowing your squaddies to pounce on the cowards.

- *Repair Tool* Repair repair repair. If your armor survives, then your team should be fine. I can go on about all the games I've joined where nobody gave care to our armor, thus allowing enemy armor to just punch through our lines and make us look like a bunch of bastards running around in a house-on-fire.

- *Mines* A little does a lot. Place them randomly or in 3-packs in shadows or around corners, where vehicles will be unlikely to look for them. They don't even need to actually kill anyone. Once the enemy realizes that there are mines about, they will be extremely careful and slow in moving their armor, thus allowing your rockets to pierce them when they switch to thermal and are looking for little Pac-Man pellets. YOU ARE THE GHOST.

3. **[SUPPORT]** - The most used and most versatile class thus far because of its high ammo capacity (especially useful when aiming in this game is still very easy). It has c4 explosives to take down tanks or to set up traps, mortars to fire on enemy positions and really mess up the back snipers, and claymores to water down the enemy when you're defending a point. Oh, also this class is 3 perks in one: squad ammo, squad explosives, and squad frags. Whenever you spawn in, make it a habit to drop a damn ammo box. **DROP AN AMMO BOX EVERY TIME YOU SPAWN IN**. People need ammo. You're not Upham from Saving Private Ryan, are you? Don't go turning us into Tom Hanks and the rest of the squad. Also, cover fire. Cover fire every goddamn enemy unless you're not supposed to be loud and belligerent.

4. **[RECON]** - A very polarizing class which, if used correctly, can be very useful. I know we always joke about the idiot snipers hanging in the back and not being useful, but they CAN be useful. There are 2 play-styles for recons which can be very useful:

- *Aggressive Forward Recon* is the one who puts on a SMG, Shotgun, or Holo-Scope MK11 MOD (my personal favorite) and forces his massive reconnaissance penis down the virgin throats of the enemy. You become a massive damage dealer and another squadmate who is not a liability.

- *The Mid-range Wookie* is not always a bad thing. Notice how I wrote ""mid-range"". That means that you are not running to the highest mountain on the map to try to pick people off. Get to a safe distance away from all the action and COVER your teammates as they advance. Watch their six, relay information of their whereabouts to them, and spot the enemy. You are their living, breathing spawn beacon. Which reminds me of the next few things that recon should think about:
- PLACE SPAWN BEACONS
- USE TUGS/MAVS to spot and give your teammates more information on their surroundings
- PLACE SPAWN BEACONS
- DON'T BE A DOUCHEBAG
- PLACE SPAWN BEACONS

Air Superiority. I've been dreading this mode since I'm the worst jet pilot ever and have lost every 1v1 I've ever been in (probably). I imagined getting killed to shit constantly and calmly putting my controller down, fashioning a noose out of my bedsheets, and hanging myself. But! after a few minutes of it, I was having the time of my life! You gotta keep in mind, for every expert jet pilot there's a bunch of tardmonkeys like me (although to be fair, it was a mixed mode server, AS only servers will most likely have better overall pilots). There's 24 planes up in the air, so you're pretty free to roam about without getting locked on every 5 seconds. I even got 3 kills!! This is unheard of. You don't even have to engage, you can just cap flags to help out. Our team won despite the enemies absolutely owning the shit out of us, kill-wise 94-43 ([battle report](http://battlelog.battlefield.com/bf3/battlereport/show/4/83870573/251819592/)). So don't be afraid, check it! Protip: hit detection on the ground was really iffy for me, I thought I was flying high enough but I'd say half my deaths were due to exploding while flying over ground, so watch out for that. Edit moar protip: if you fly as engineer, any kills count towards the ""destroy vehicles as engi"" new assignment

tl;dr epic

edit: I played some TDM, it's a crazy meat grinder. Regarding the bikes...the only bad thing is that in the passenger seat, you can't swivel 360. I know, it wouldn't be ""realistic"", but it's stupid as shit when you want to fire at something on the behind-sides, and have to turn all the way around 340 (or whatever) back and forth, left and right, if someone is for example chasing you...",,False,self,t5_2sbem,1362510299.0,,Europe,True,t3_19pl30,http://www.reddit.com/r/ps3bf3/comments/19pl30/end_game_first_impressions/,

Engineers often are thought of as the vehicle or anit-vehicle class with much of the game play happening in or near vehicles.  This guide will detail an alternate approach to traditional Engi game play that focuses on medium to long range Engi game play


Load out:


AS val, extended mags


Javelin (or RPG) 


AT Mines


Squad explosives and squad ammo required (join a friend or ask a squadmate); other perks recommended:  Squad sprint for changing positions, squad suppression for engaging enemy infantry.


Overview:


Taking a less aggressive stance on capturing objectives and focusing on eliminating armor, slowing armor progress, and eliminating enemy infantry of all classes at range.


The overall strategy is to provide overwatch and protection for your squad while destroying or slowing down armor.  Essentially a mix of Recon and Engi duties.  This game play style consists of positioning your character on places that are less traveled and farther away than most engagements.  For example, setting up on Firestorm from the roofs or the platform scaffolding located at C.   It is advised to have several areas in mind to choose and change from as discussed later.


Though commonly used and widely known, we will start with the equipment.  


AT mine placement is fairly basic.  Hide them in places they will not be seen such as around corners, in debris, in crevasses, and at the top of hills (where a tank cannot aim down enough to destroy them). Using an over watch style of game play can allow you to see the enemy's routes and place accordingly.  Working edges of the maps, roofs, and less traveled paths mostly you can find a place mines in areas to get kills, slow down vehicles, and most importantly dictate the paths of enemy armor.  Enemy tanks are likely to take different routes in response to your mining attempts.  



Javelin is my ideal load out; however, due to IR smoke it can be less effective.  RPG is a good choice in this instance, but I will go over some techniques to use with the Javelin.  You can use the Javelin in coordination with a team mate using the CITV, laser painter, or Soflam for anti-air duties.  CITV works wonderfully and your Jav will allow the tankers to focus more on ground battles. Javelin use combined with AT Mines can essentially take an enemy tank out of combat without killing them.  Every time they pop smoke they need to wait for it to recharge or you will be able to lock, fire, and hit them.  Forcing the enemy tanks to pop IR smoke also blinds them from other attackers as well.  Tankers will have to decide to use Thermal to detect AT mines or IR smoke to avoid Javelin.  Most will choose IR smoke and try to spot for mines so remember this in your placement.  Others will try to use Thermal and hope the Reactive Armor will take the brunt of Javelins while they take routes they feel they will be out of your Javelin's range or line-of-sight.  As mentioned, RPG can be a good choice, but I prefer the game within a game of the AT mines/Javelin combo.   



It is important to be in a squad with at least one other player so you can have both the explosives perk and the ammo perk.  A Support player is recommended for ammo crates if using Javelin.





Finally, the 'unloved' gun, the AS Val.  


Initial stats:  RoF of 900, Max Damage 20, min damage 18.4, extended magazines unlocked at 200 kills (required).


To contrast vs. using a standard Engi weapon I've included a spread comparison of the [AS Val](http://i.imgur.com/IoAzn.png) and an [M4A1](http://i.imgur.com/fmu20.png) with heavy barrel as seen in this [comparison](http://i.imgur.com/WtfL3.png).  The reason I prefer the AS Val in this match up is the smaller spread.  You'll notice the spread of the M4A1 isn't as tight of a bullet grouping through the first 3 shots.  The AS Val has a tighter first shot and the second and third shots tend to land in a very tight circle around the first.  This is mostly due to the one thing that is truly unique to the AS Val.  First shot vertical recoil multiplier.  Since you've been diligent in reading so far I will share what few know:  The AS Val is the only weapon in the game with a first shot recoil multiplier of less than 1.0.  It's [mulitiplier of .5](http://symthic.com/charts.php?class=5&amp;sort=Class&amp;adsc=ASC&amp;attc=-) means that the first shot of the AS Vals will have less recoil than sucessive shots.  Again, this is unique to the AS Val and it is the primary reason burst fire is so effective at long rang with this weapon.  The downside to using the AS Val at long range is the low bullet velocity.  However, with a little leading you will find due to the tight spread and high RoF it's fairly easy to land two or even three shots on a target per burst.  The initial recoil makes staying on target and target reacquisition fairly easy compared to other weapons.  You can land a total of 36.8 damage per burst when landing two shots or 55.2 damage when landing three shots per burst at long range.  Using 3 quick bursts is my preferred technique, but you may want to use 4 bursts until you get the leading right.


The AS Val can win close range engagement as well, but like the G3, it is a gun that requires the player stay clam when firing.  The recoil when going full auto takes a different technique for reasons listed above, but can be easily learned with some practice.  The added benefit of a built-in silencer keeps the player off the maps.  Players are advised to consider places to move to after firing Javelins though.  Keep in mind that enemies will be able to find your location farily easily after a Javelin is shot due to the smoke trail.  It is beneficial for the player to have a second, third, or even a fourth 'spot' to relocate to after being discovered.  Consider having your new location overlook your old location for easy kills on enemies that come to find you in your old spot. Using this overwatch play style should allow the player to determine likely routes enemies will take.  Use this information when choosing your new spot.   



Using a strategy based on the above a player should be able to destroy or slow enemy armor, counter-snipe snipers, suppress or kill enemy infantry, while obtaining a high k/d and SPM.  Keep in mind this isn't something you must do the entire round.  Breaking from this strategy to capture uncontested or lightly contested bases, defend bases, planting and replanting AT mines, and other way you can help your team in a strategic way are recommended.        



Never forget to spot.  Your positions should allow you to obtain a Javelin lock.  If you can lock it, you can usually spot it.  Keep in mind when engaging an enemy tank with a Javelin that by spotting them and forcing them to use IR smoke you can give your teammates the ability to get first shot on them, better positions, and generally a better chance of winning the confrontation with minimal damage or at the very least escaping alive.


Other important points to note:  You have limited amounts of Javelin so choose your shots wisely.  If you know the enemy tank has IR smoke wait until they are approaching a friendly tank to lock and shoot.  This will give the friendly tank an advantage in the fire fight.  Again, remember to spot so the friendly can know there is an enemy tank.


If you choose to spawn as a Support and drop ammo for your Javelin or have a team mate spawn on you to drop ammo consider the placement of the ammo box.  While having an ammo box directly under your feet as you fire your Javelin or RPG is nice, this box will likely be destroyed by the enemies that will come for you.  Consider placing in a more hidden spot or between the two most popular points you will be using.  One good strategy is to have the ammo box at location 2 and use position 1 as a primary point you fire your Javelin from.  Making point 2 a good place to fire on infantry is also an idea to consider as the AS Val's silencer will keep you off the map allowing you to take out enemies undetected as you replenish your explosives.  


This isn't a play style for every game and it is not recommended for more than one or two players to use this style per team.  However, one good player using this play style on a team can be helpful in the right circumstances.

Recently I have been spending more time browsing /r/Battlefield in addition to the other Battlefield subs. I began to think that a generic PlayStation sub might be a good idea.

With BF4 coming out, as well as the PS4, I think it may start to feel disconnected and overly complicated with all the different subs out there. 

Currently there is 

* /r/ps3bc2 

* /r/ps3bf3 

* /r/ps3bf4 

* /r/ps4bf4 




**r/psbf**

The idea is to have one place that people on both current and next gen PlayStation platforms can meet and discuss any Battlefield game. I really like some of the features /r/Battlefield uses such as the submission tags next to each post, and the filter option. This would allow for each post to easily be identified with the correct game on the correct platform. A filter option would even allow people to only view posts with content about one specific game. So if people only wanted to see posts about BF3 for instance, they wouldn't have to look through posts from all the other games.

So what I am looking for now is input. Would you guys be in favor of something like this? Would you still use the current subs we have now? Who would be able to help with the CSS and mod duties? Who from the community do you feel should be in charge? Tell me your opinions.

As I have told some people, I may eventually be leaving console gaming and sticking to PC. Therefore if this idea takes off, I may hand the psbf sub over to other people.

**UPDATE:** Wow! That was quick. Already we've got ~~17~~ a lot of interested people for organizing VOIP people into matches, etc. That's great! So, to build on what we've got so far, any and all future VOIP-related events or threads will have [VOIP] in the title so you can quickly identify what we're doing. Stay tuned!

**UPDATE:** Reddit VOIP platoon created: http://battlelog.battlefield.com/bf3/platoon/2832655241305523347/. See also: 

**UPDATE:** foss333 was gracious enough to mention his server, perhaps we may be able to work something out!

*Original Post*

There's already a ton of active people on here that use TeamSpeak, but I rarely see any action from the VOIP users out there.  So I think it's well past due since VOIP has been fixed to get together and organize ourselves!

So, I decided to open this brainstorm thread for the VOIP players out there. Basically, I am trying to figure out the best way for VOIP users to get together and who might be interested in doing so. Some ideas that have been suggested previously:

* Separate VOIP platoon
 * Active Platoon leaders (Volunteers needed)
 * Optional custom tag ([RdtV]?)

* Weekly events for VOIP peeps

* VOIP-only servers (Volunteers/hosts needed)

* VOIP player list/timezone availability

Already there is a VOIP vs. TS event planned (I believe the reschedule is for this upcoming weekend on the 14th) so this would be a great idea to gather together 12 peeps for the upcoming match. Maybe we can get some practice before the match? 

Interested? Let's start by getting some names. If we can get to 20, I'll start a platoon. Then we can start organizing.

The last 34 games I played were rush. I (about half of the time with random pubbers and half of the games with a couple rdts or people I know) won 32 of them.

---------------
*On defense:*

On the first set of mcoms, you test the enemy team. Go recon and place a spawn beacon in a safe place about 10 meters ahead of the objective (this allows you to spawn in and get the armers in the back). Make sure the beacon is under a roof so you don't parachute in. Stay recon and keep replacing the spawn beacon. Put away the soflam and pick up the mav. The aerial eye is amazing in rush. It stops flankers getting by and can save your team when hope is lost. Make sure you stay high up so you don't get taken down and see everybody. Use a bolt action at the beginning to take long range shots and then switch to a close range weapon after the enemy's first push.

If this doesn't work and the enemy do take the base, then you know the enemy team is ptfoing hard. Switch to assault and use something powerful for rushing like the f2000 or famas. Don't be afraid to stray towards the enemy as long as you have reliable squad mates near the objectives. Deplete the enemy tickets as fast as possible. **Turn your sensitivity up.** Many people tend to just hang back as defense, but I find it incredibly effective to play aggressively even on defense. The faster you reduce the enemy tickets, the better you stand.

*On offense:*

Rush. It's in the name. Get to the objectives as fast as possible. Have a designated recon in your team placing spawn beacons close to the mcoms. **However, do not blindly run at the objective with the letters ptfo screaming through your head.** That will just get you killed. Rush to the objective area, but once you get there, don't rush at the mcoms before you know nobody's looking at them. Go around them and clear out the campers and anyone straying by and then arm it. Don't try to do it all by yourself. It may feel cool, but you'll usually fail. **Have a couple of teammates with you as you go to arm** - this is essential. Most snipers can't get all 3 of you in the time it takes to arm and you're almost guaranteed an arm if you outnumber the enemy near the mcoms.

If your pushes keep failing, switch to medic and try to get others to do so too. Revive as much as you can without getting yourself killed to keep the ticket count up. If you're under 15 tickets, rambo revive everyone. **Use smoke.** In most maps, smoke is very useful in rush. Pop a few canisters ahead of you and allow your squad to move up through the smoke cover.

And lastly, **flank**. Whenever you find chokepoints stopping you, try to find a good flank and get everyone in the back and free up the chokepoint and let your team to move up.

If your run HDMI to your TV or Monitor you may want to consider trying them. I did and was amazed at the difference it made.  

First is [RGB Full Range](http://manuals.playstation.net/document/en/ps3/current/settings/rgbfullrange.html) and the other is [Super-White (HDMI)](http://manuals.playstation.net/document/en/ps3/current/settings/superwhite.html).  

The colors really pop and the graphics look much better to me now that I turned both on. Even the PS3 menus and Netflix shows look better.  

One thing to note, however, is that I play on a 24"" computer monitor with an HDMI In Port which has full support for the settings. I read up on a few forums and people state that many televisions or older monitors don't support the higher RGB range and Blacks and grays will mix making it difficult to see in dark areas or on dark maps so it might be advisable to give it a try on your TV/Monitor before leaving it like that.  

Anyhow, just thought I'd share as it gave the game and general PS3 usage a noticeable visual enhancement for myself.  

EDIT: As a side note, even on my Monitor (ASUS) I needed to set it to *game mode* to see all the squares in the [test image](http://www.nicolaspeople.com/ch3rokeesblog/?p=16) I found. If you use a monitor and it's like mine, it has several display mode presets and *game* mode appears to be the one that doesn't do any post processing.  

According to [This fella](http://forums.guru3d.com/showthread.php?t=365595) all HDMI compliant Televisions DO HAVE Full RGB capabilities according to law/standards.

In bf3, every single firefight and battle feels forced due to the map design. Almost all the bf3 maps are tiny in comparison, thus making enemy encounters inevitable every minute or so.

BF3 patch Nov. 27 - Summary (input lag fixed, weapons balancing, and audio fixes)
",31,1,35,http://www.reddit.com/r/ps3bf3/comments/13tnga/bf3_patch_nov_27_summary_input_lag_fixed_weapons/,"**Addressed “input lag” on PS3**

* If you have been experiencing “input lag” playing Battlefield 3 on PlayStation 3, we now believe we have significantly improved this situation for all players.
 
**Improved audio stability on PS3**

* The audio dropouts reported by some PlayStation 3 gamers playing Battlefield 3 should now be fixed for the majority of players .
 
**Weapons balancing**

* Based on detailed community feedback and data analysis we have made some minor weapon tweaks to recoil and accuracy. The goal of these tweaks, and the overall goal in Battlefield 3, is to give each weapon a unique feel and competitive performance to other weapons of a similar type.

* M416: First shot and horizontal recoil slightly increased. This should make the choice between M16 and M416 more interesting again.

* L85A2: Slightly reduced horizontal recoil.

* AUG: first shot recoil slightly to increase weapon controllability.

* FAMAS: Slightly reduced horizontal recoil.

* G53: Vertical recoil reduced to make this weapon more controllable.

* QBZ-95B: Slightly reduced horizontal recoil.

* LSAT: Hip accuracy has been increased to highlight the weapon’s role as a highly mobile LMG.

* Type88 LMG: Recoil has been decreased to make it a viable option when compared to the M249.

* M5K: Increased horizontal recoil and decreased vertical recoil to focus this weapon as a high damage, low control PDW.

* UMP45: Decreased fully automatic fire to differentiate this weapon from the PP2000.

* MP412: Increased its accuracy to better distinguish it from the .44 Magnum.

* M26: Increased aimed accuracy to be in line with the other shotguns.

 
**Weapons bug fixes**

* Fixed the MTAR’s range not being correctly reduced when equipped with the sound suppressor.

* Fixed a bug where suppressive fire had reduced effect on the M16 and M5K when compared with other weapons.

* Fixed a bug where the M5K’s Flash Suppressor had no effect on accuracy.

* Fixed the L86A2 Heavy Barrel’s hip accuracy penalty being far larger than other weapons.

* Fixed an issue with the Mk3 shotgun’s ACOG being low resolution.

**Gunship balancing changes**

* We have now removed the gunship FLIR view (the position is still available, just not the black/white view) and decreased the damage radius of cannon explosions. This was done because of balancing reasons. Previously it was too easy for the gunner to get visual contact on enemy soldiers on the maps, and the splash damage is reduced to make it harder to kill infantry from the cannon seat.

The one thing that bugs me is that they basically made two different games. One game for consoles and one for PC's. I would of preferred everyone got stuck with the console version because I'm a scumbag steve [and don't like it when people have things I can't have](http://qkme.me/35o0zm). 

The 3 map conquest assault irritates me. I don't really enjoy playing CQA. The larger map of Gulf of Oman is a blast to play though. I see a small detail like this as the same thing as our 4 flag large map Oman compared to their [7 \(**SEVEN!!!!!**\) map Oman.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lel1179Wp9o) It's pretty much a whole new game. 

It also bug the hell out of me how slow some games are. They need more players on each team. 12 man teams just makes some of the big maps lonely. My and my squad on one game stayed in the jeep the entire time game and just capped flags. We ended up winning the game with the highest scores. This shouldn't be possible. We shouldn't be able to drive around freely without any resistance. But that's what happens on the larger maps. Metro and Grand B are perfect maps for smaller teams, but Caspian, Karkand, and other bigger maps feel too isolated. Whenever I haul ass to E on Karkand, it's so simple to Cap E, D, C because everyone's at A and B. There just isn't enough man power to defend the flags properly.

I've put a lot of serious consideration into building a new PC that could handle the graphics (on Ultra) for BF3. The fact that I like playing with you guys is the one major thing holding me back. If I hadn't found r/PS3BF3 I would of bought a PC by now. Well, that and all that shit that's still pretty broken with the game and keeping it from its full potential.

I used to constantly be pressing tab to check on my score/rank, and I eventually realized it was driving me crazy and sucking some of the fun out of the experience.  I would  do something of value to the team that didn't really earn me many points or kills, and all the satisfaction would deflate. For instance, Let's say you're the only one at a capture point that is being attacked, and you manage to distract/harass a tank with three guys in it long enough for some of my teamates to get to the capture point and make a successful push/destroy the tank.  It's very possible that your team would have lost that flag (and maybe even more flags because of it) if it weren't for your intervention, but you earned zero actual points for it.  As soon as I would press that tab key and see that, after all that, I've fallen a few ranks in the team, I would go from ""Fyea"" guy to ""OK"" guy.  Getting myself out of that habit has made a surprising difference.  I even went so far as to just disable the key that brings up the scoreboard, and I find that I get a lot less frustrated now.

Side note: I find this is especially true when it comes to harassing choppers.  I used to never run a stinger because I would rarely get a kill with it, especially against a good chopper pilot.  What I've found, though, is that even if you *never* actually score a hit, the fact that you are constantly locking on and firing away forces the heli to deal with it by deploying flares, dropping out of lock, or getting the heck out of dodge.  Often, a jet will come in and get a kill that it normally wouldn't have, because the chopper has used its flares.  I've also seen lots of choppers smash into the ground/side of a mountain when desperately trying to get out of radar range.  Other times you'll see people panic bail, which is always hilarious.  In any of those situations, you may not have earned a single point, but you still managed to wipe out a potentially big threat for 2 minutes, and kept two or three of their guys occupied with just you, which is a nice trade-off.  Time they spend dealing with you is time they don't spend destroying your vehicles and wreaking havoc.",,False,self,t5_2sbem,False,,USACtrl,True,t3_uy4zw,http://www.reddit.com/r/ps3bf3/comments/uy4zw/one_simple_thing_i_did_that_made_bf3_more/,

&gt; US guided missile has the damage values swapped.

It looks like DICE accidentally switched the damage values between **laser**-guided shells and plain-old guided shells—but only for the Abrams. So that means that the Abrams will actually do *more* damage if the target **isn't** lased.

It also means that the T-90 *should* be getting crushed in a 1 vs. 1 with an Abrams (although, I feel like almost everyone does better in the T-90).

I will be playing, revive someone, and immediately they start shrieking over the mic ""DON'T REVIVE ME BRO!!"". I can understand if I was rambo reviving (which I admit I do on occasion, but I really try not to), but mostly it's in situations where I will clear the threat first, and then revive once it's safe. Personally, I'm always hoping someone will revive me, because that means one less death on my record, and keeps me close to the action and my teammates. So it seems like a win-win to me. I don't even get mad when people rambo revive me, because even if I get a couple more shots at the enemy I'm happy. It only counts as one death for me anyways, so what's the problem?

So I'm just looking for some reasoning for this. If someone shows me some situations where reviving a teammate is hurting the team, I will gladly stop and asses the situation before pulling out my medic paddels too quickly.

1363475628.0,28,self.ps3bf3,1afnez,"Things I would like to see improved in BF4, because I would doubt they are going to make changes to BF3 now.",33,5,50,http://www.reddit.com/r/ps3bf3/comments/1afnez/things_i_would_like_to_see_improved_in_bf4/,"This is not really a ""What I want in BF4"" post, rather a post about things that they should have done in BF3 which would have improved the quality of the game. I've played this for 18 months and they tweak a bit but not much, usually just weapon fix, map fixes etc. But I think there are some heavy flaws which DICE need to improve on to make a better quality game. These include:

 - Remove ticket count modifiers on Gamemodes like Rush and Capture The Flag. The game mode is unable when The Attackers have less than 100% and defence is a nightmare when The Attackers have more than 100%. I understand having different level set for number players (i.e PC's 32, 48, 64 Players have different Ticket counts) but being able to change it is ridiculously unfair to one team.

 - Remove the ability for enemy team to be able to fly over the enemy deployment. This is pretty much the ability to steal vehicles and games become unbalanced way too easy. I like how in End Game you spawn in a Jet already in Flight, so it cannot be taken, but The Noshahr Canals Map on Conquest can be a nightmare if you spawn US side and the enemy has taken all the scout helicopters. This will also remove the need for AA guns in the deployment.

 - Focus more on Infantry. I found this game (with the DLC combined) lacked on infantry quite a bit. Operation Metro was the only 24 player all mode Infantry Map given. I find that rather sad. Seine Crossing,  Grand Bazaar and Epicenter are close second places, but I find too many people wiould run and jump (or wait) for MBTs and IFVs than do some gun on gun fun. I'm not saying don't use vehicles, they just don't need to be used 24/7. Close Quarters DLC was a fail IMHO; it provided gun on gun but restricted on sniping and distant shooting/destruction. It didn't provide the variety like Op Metro did.

 - Add an enhanced level of BFBC2 Destruction. There a few buildings you can completely demolish and it sucks. The Rubble from shooting buildings is good, but there should also be buildings you can absolutely flatten out and just drive right over it. Also disappointed in Aftermath the lack of being able to get any rubble kills/the earthquakes not creating deadly rubble. 

 - Use Assignments to promote overlooked/forgotten elements. I think DICE did this a little in BF3, but then lost focus. Make Assignments focusing on SQDM for the L85A2 was an awesome idea, and the EOD Bot kill (although a tad annoying) for the MTAR made me change the way I had to play and think about the game. I found they eventually turned out to be 'Make them do something similar to what they are unlocking'.

 - Create Deployments which can not be seen into/seen out from. I know many people who play Caspian Border CQ and play on the Russian side (the team closest to D Flag). They Bipod at their deployment with a 12x Sniper and shoot into the enemy deployment, The aim at the attack chopper and shoot the pilot/gunner because of the downtime to start it up. 5 Kills 6000 points for no objective work, come on! 

 - Remove the ability to Switch Teams during Game/Add a Switch Teams button during the end game summary. I have seen too many people change teams to keep a win streak. That way, people still want to play with their friends can, they just have to finish the round, then they can Squad up. I would also like to see the server rotation in the end game summary so I know if I want to play the next map or not.

Its 99.99999% sure there will be Server Rental options again at some point in BF4 so either:

 - Restrict Server Admin abilities to only picking Map Rotation, Server Settings (i.e. Hardcore, Core, Infantry, Normal, Private, Public, Password Protected etc) and picking VIPs. There is no need (for console at least) to kick or ban players from servers. ""Kicks for Friends/Admins"" is the stupidest thing I have ever read in a server description.

 - Have More DICE/EA Servers than Rented Servers. Because Badmins.

 - If players use the Quick Match feature, prioritise them in DICE/EA Servers before a Rented Server. I'm not a fan of Quickmatch because It usually puts me in a server in a different region where I would lag constantly, but people still use it.

 - Require Admins to adhere to an agreement before renting/purchasing a server. This would help to remove admin abuse on fair players. Players should have the ability to report servers/admins, who are breaking EAs rules in regards to rentable servers. If found being breaking rules, servers owners could lose their server. 

 - Change several DICE/EA servers to what's popular within the community. I see so many Infantry (i.e. Vehicles removed) servers which are and have always been vacant and its rather a waste of a server in my opinion. They should think and go ""okay a lot of people like jets, so how about we make a Caspian/Kharg/Firestorm/Alborz/Wake/Gulf/Bandar/etc server"".

Also included are general rules which players should try to adhere to all the time, but especially when playing with others from this community.",33,4,42,http://www.reddit.com/r/ps3bf3/comments/vs8aw/rps3bf3_general_guidelines_for_server_admins_and/,"**Server Owner and Admin Guidelines**

* Move players at the beginning of a match. Nobody wants to get moved over in the middle of play. Wait until the next match if a player you want to play with is on the other team.
* Kicking is acceptable if players are spawn camping, base raping with vehicles, intentionally team killing, and glitching the maps/cheating. Spawn camping is shooting into a base that is out of bounds. Base rape is using a vehicle (usually a jet or chopper) to destroy enemy vehicles while they are in spawn. Glitching the maps is when a player gets above or below a map. An intentional team kill is pretty self-explanitory, but it would be smart to let the first one slide.
* Warn a player if they are jet ramming. If they continue, feel free to kick.
* Make custom rules known in the server description. If you are going to give priority to TeamSpeak, VOIP, faction, or clan users, make sure it says so in the description. It would be wise to repeat this as the server greeting.
* Make it known that your clan/platoon/faction is practicing. If you are filling your server to do this, make it private and unranked. Message those who are in before the server is set so that they at least know why. You can delegate this out to players involved so that it can be done quickly and efficiently. It takes 2 minutes.
* Server owners, choose admins who are mature enough to handle such responsibility. It's your name on the server and you'll be getting most of the hate mail. Minimize this by making good decisions about who you give admin privileges to.

**Player Guidelines**

* Don't spawn camp. There's no reason to shoot into the enemy spawn. It makes the game boring and kills a server quickly. Instead, hang out at the nearest objective to the spawn. That way, you even get defender points and the enemy at least has a shot to make the game interesting.
* Don't base rape. You don't get any points for blowing up empty vehicles. It is pathetic to do and ruins the fun for everyone else. This also leads to people avoiding servers.
* Don't team kill intentionally. Be a big boy and deal with it. Getting killed by a teammate happens. Move along. If they are doing it to you, report it to an admin and let them handle it.
* Don't glitch the map in any ranked games. This is probably considered to be worse than everything else. This is cheating. It is what the scum of Battlefield players do. If you want to test a glitch out, do it on an unranked server. Doing this is widely considered ban-worthy.
* Look at the server description while the maps are loading. This is an easy one. There is likely vital information about who may get moved or kicked and why.
* If you are playing on a server with ps3bf3 in the name, make sure to run [rdt] tags, reddit faction tags, or reddit platoon tags. There is no way to know if you are a redditor unless you are rocking some identifying tags. Don't complain that you got kicked from a server for no reason when you are maintaining anonymity by not using reddit tags.
* Don't message something vulgar to an admin if you get a warning. That's the fastest way to get kicked/banned. A warning isn't the end of the world.

1333242515.0,27,self.ps3bf3,rn4nt,Hosted a 24-hour server. Here's what I've learned:,30,3,18,http://www.reddit.com/r/ps3bf3/comments/rn4nt/hosted_a_24hour_server_heres_what_ive_learned/,"Hey guys, I seem to be the only one too pussy (or broke) to commit to a 90-day server, so I rented one for 24 hours. 

**I'll give you the TL;DR now:** Best $1.60 I've ever spent.

**What I've learned:**

— **It appears settings WILL be saved.** At the end of my 24 hour period (and a bonus round), the message said I had until April 30th to add time to my server. Presumably, this means when I re-up the custom settings will still be there. I didn't want to spend a ton of time on tweaking if it was just going to be erased at the end.

— **You can manually shuffle people around from the pause menu.** This was helpful to get all us TS'ers on the same side. I'm going to add to the disclaimer that you may be shuffled at the beginning of the round. *Note:* Clicking on yourself in this list will move the person above you instead (Sorry zInfinityz :-/)
&gt;Moving a live player shows them they were killed by an admin. Then when they respawn they are on the other team. Technically, instead of banning a player you could kill them over and over by switching them from team to team. 

— **Uhhhh...** Honestly, I thought I had learned more. If anyone else has something to add, fire away and I'll edit it in. My main concern was that the settings would wipe if I didn't keep feeding it quarters.

In conclusion, I will rent again. If you and a friend can't find a good server, why not drop a buck and a half and make your own? If the ticket count is above a certain threshold you'll get quick-match pubbers. 

**THINGS LEARNED BY OTHERS:**

— **Setting the server to private with a password does not mean its actually private.** If the presets are set to ranked it can still be accessed by randoms via quick match options. Ensure preset is set to unranked.

— **If the server is private with a password people on your friends list can still follow you onto the server without a password by using the Join Session option.** Worse yet people on their friends list and so on can also join without the password.

— **If you assign someone as an Admin they can make as much changes to the server as you can** such as changing the map rotation, setting up new rules etc. Ensure you trust your admin before handing over control.

— **If you rent a server your profile can be accessed via the main server screen and random people can send you messages.** Change your PS3 account privacy settings to only allow friends to send you messages (this means no more hate mail though).

*PROTIP:* Start your rotation with Metro and your tickets above 50% and you'll more than likely fill up quick with eager would-be-parisian smurfs.

For those guys looking for something fresh to play, a few friends and I came up with a paintball mode similar to the one from Goldeneye on the N64, where weapons deal enough damage to kill in one hit.  The way we have it set up is with no mini-map, hud, or 3-D spotting to make a full hardcore experience.  To balance weapons so nobody is spamming bullets at 900 RPM, players can only choose between the MP7 and PP2000 without attachments apart from optics and the laser sight, since the laser helps hipfire on target without any HUD and the extended mags and suppressor can break the game mode and must use the semi-automatic fire mode.  The reason we use the MP7 and PP2000 is because they are easy to unlock move quickly in ADS, which is important in paintball mode because you move quietly yet quickly in ADS.

Being a subscriber to this sub reddit (which I love) I notice a lot of posts with people complaining their 400-500 SPM is horrible and I cringe as I tend to hover around 200 SPM. So I'm curious... is everyone really that good, or are there more like me who just don't pipe in as there scores aren't on par with the top-guns here in PS3BF3.  

On a final note. My stats are climbing even though it's taking ages. I think for the first month, my accuracy was around 3% and I got one kill for every four times I got killed. I guess the one stat I can be proud of is my 4% quit stat. I generally tend to stick to a game no matter how bad it is unless my friends want to switch servers which drives me nuts because I don't want that stat to climb.

Teamspeak is cool, but it's hard for me to be on Teamspeak and BF3 at the same time, and people just tend to hang around in the lobby BSing (which is great fun, but not exactly what I'm looking for) I'd prefer a HC conquest server, but I'll take all votes from anyone interested.

**[DISCLAIMER]** I am not saying that these are the best strategies to employ, I am merely trying to offer advice to those who would find this information helpful and, more than anything, clash it with the philosophies of everyone else in this subreddit so that we may actually have some meaningful discussion about important aspects in the game. If I come off as an arrogant prick, then you have me summed up about right.

**[INTRODUCTION]** This is basically a written guide that outlines several things that I take into consideration when I play. It's been spread throughout and learned incrementally over my time playing with other players like Pteryldactl, GodAmoungMen, Duende, and many other rdts that I don't usually squad up with. It's one thing to be a good shooter. To have good reflexes in a game like BF3 can make you a potent player to challenge, but the brawn is nothing without the brains--something that BF3 greatly rewards. Feel free to discuss these points and even refute them with your own. I figured this is definitely a better change in pace than the recent trend of whining about spawn camping and how you should quit or join the winning team rather than take on a challenge and turn the tide of battle. This is a guide on how to conduct warfare as a squad of infantry--I'm no good with vehicles so I hope another wonderful [R&amp;D] can step up and provide useful insight.

&gt; The Initial Phase - Before you even spawn, there are several things that you should take into consideration several things:

1. **Assess the map and objectives** - There is a variety of maps that BF3 offers that call for different things in your squad. Maps like metro require more close-range and mid-range gunfighting without the assistance of vehicles. Tehran Highway is still mainly infantry combat with the tide-turning capabilities of some tanks, APCs, and light jeeps/humvees/Russian ice cream truck troop transports. You want to realize what your squad needs to do to compliment the team and what role you all should play. Is your objective to be the head of the spear and smash and hold B? Are you leading the charge on Rush? Or is your squad's task to remain behind enemy lines with very little assistance and cause havoc? You want your loadouts to complement the task at hand, so think about that and discuss it with your squadmates beforehand.

2. **Squad Attributes** Not everyone has these unlocked, but I'm going to assume that you all do because I'm like an Asian parent: I know you have all the tools for success. You've got: Squad Sprint, Squad Cover, Squad Explosives, Squad Flak, Squad Grenades, Squad Suppress, and Squad Ammo. Never get squad ammo unless you won't have a support. It is the most useless squad attribute because 1 support negates it. Want to bust tanks? Get Flak, Grenades, Cover, and Explosives. So your squad is going to be the big boys with big guns spraying lead all over the battlefield? Suppress, Grenades, Cover, and Sprint. Wookie squad? You get the picture. Work with your squadmates to discern the best squad attributes for your objectives.

&gt; Keeping the Future in Mind - There are several things that you should do with your first life that may come in handy.

3. **Engineer AT Mines and Recon Spawn Beacons** - You should spawn either as a recon or engineer to begin with for two reasons: AT Mines and Spawn Beacons. This is mainly for people who do not play these classes, as you can just spawn as recon, put up a spawn beacon, and upon death just respawn as another class (the spawn beacon only disappears when you spawn in as a recon class). If your entire squad lays AT Mines on a map, that's a potential 24 AT Mines scattered throughout already that will not disappear unless they're blown up. Your squad has already contributed to the team without even seeing a single enemy. Do this, and you can spawn after a death as your favored Assault or Support class and all will be normal in the world.

4. **Suppressors, Flashlights, Lasers** - Useful. Very useful. Suppressors do not make you appear on radar when you shoot (which to a skilled player, is practically a beacon shouting out ""my butthole is so tight and needs a good romp. Please oh please satisfy my carnal urges!"") Flashlights are good for clearing corner campers and just causing panic in the scrubs. Laser pointers are similar to flashlights, but not as effective.

&gt; So the game begins. These are now general tips to follow as the battle rages on.

5. **Stick With Your Squad** - Why squad up if you're all going to spread yourselves out throughout the map the entire time? There's nothing wrong with going after separate objectives (especially when your team blows), but it's typically best to stick with your squad so that your communication will provide a situational radar for your squadmates to engage with. This does not mean HUMP THE SHIT out of your squadmates. Keep a considerable distance and just keep this thought in mind when advancing as a squad: ""If a support with a trigger finger comes spraying down at me... will my entire squad die?"" If the answer is yes, then you're doing it wrong.

6. **Trust your squad, watch where they're not watching** - Look at the radar. See where everyone's looking if you're capping/protecting a point. Check the exits/entrances that they are not looking at, or cover their entrance as another line of defense if they are to fall. Imagine how the situation changes once one of your squaddies watching a point goes down. Where will the enemy come from? Whom will they see first? Compensate for this and be ready.

7. **Always Spot, Sometimes Engage** - Do not give the position of your squad away just because you see this baddie running down the street across from you. If you don't have a suppressor, you're pretty much announcing to the enemy where your entire squad is, thus compromising your position. You spot so that your team can take that information and pick up the kill, or you spot so that you can see where that person is heading and hope to cut him off and mow down his buddies (because unless they're incompetent, most people will travel together). Pick your battles. Win them.

8. **Use Your Radar** - This is why I find hardcore to be stupid. It takes out the most useful tool in the game: the radar. Press start when you're safe to see the flow of the battle. Which side of the map is the enemy pushing? Which side is your team pushing? Compensate for your idiot team by taking your squad to strengthen the weakest link in your defense/attack. Flanking is key.

9. **Drop HP and Ammo Often** - Do it. You don't need to wait for someone to stare at you and shoot you, asking for ammo/HP. Not everyone notices the call signals on the radar. Drop it after your squad just mowed down the enemy team. Drop it after you spawn. Drop it. Drop it. Drop it.

10. **Revive Like You're Not Brain-Dead** - There are moments where reviving in the middle of a gunfight is a good idea; maybe when your team is engaging in a big firefight and could use the extra gun firing off. Do not rush out into the open when you KNOW the enemy is watching you to revive someone. You screw over yourself with a meaningless death and you get your squad/teammate killed and further delay their spawn time. Son, you could possibly lose the war with your stupidity. Do you hate Freedom and Liberty that much?

11. **COVER FUCKING FIRE** - The suppression system is amazing. Have you ever been on LSD? I haven't, but when some mother fucker lights up my cover, I feel like I'm on it. Suppressing fire is heavily under appreciated in this game, and support should do it more often. What the hell does accuracy matter? If you do this right, your K/D will improve because these assholes that you're blinding aren't going to kill you and you're going to get points because you're covering for your team. Cover the advance. Shoot down a corridor if you notice your teammates need help. Just because your eyes do not see the enemy does not mean that you can't help. Shoot their cover, blind and disorient them, and let your squaddies take care of the business.

12. **Think like the enemy** - This comes with reading the radar and the flow of the battle. Try to think of what a typical college-aged loser is going to do in a situation where his team just capped B. Where is the enemy pushing from? Where are they most likely to go? What route are they most likely to traverse? Think like them and get a step ahead. Let them know that you understand their pain, and that they should rage more when they get pounded by a RPG when crossing the corner.

13. **Plan An Escape** - When you know you're going to enter a gunfight, think about points where you can fall back to and cover your retreating teammates. This isn't Sparta; you don't need to die for your cause. In fact, dying has a detrimental effect on the outcome of your team. Your squaddies can't spawn on you, they no longer have your eyes for information, and you just wasted a ticket because you think that you're gung-ho and want some 5 second glory against a 14-year-old boy. Live to fight again. This goes along with picking your battles.

14. **Situational Awareness is Key** - Everything can change in a battle. So you're losing tickets? Come back as assault and revive some people. Too many tanks and not enough firepower to deal with them? Change your packages. Understand the situation and address it accordingly. Use your brain.

Anyways, that's all I have for now. Feel free to discuss, tell me how much of an asshole I am, or provide sufficient fellatio to my ego.

Unfortunately, I feel that this subreddit has evolved into something I am not happy with. Posts are littered with down votes due to bias, and disliking a certain member. Down votes for disagreeing on opinions. Nasty, condescending remarks to unworthy users. Imagine walking into reddit completely new and not knowing how anything works. You come on this subreddit asking a simple question or trying to find some new people to play with. Having the best remark being ""look on the sidebar"". That is a post that should have **zero** downvotes. Actually, the only downvote that should be distributed is due to inappropriate content to the subreddit. Along with all the cheerleader drama initiated with some of the TS3 group on teamspeak, I have come to a dead end with this subreddit. 


I know I am not alone on this either. So, DCeighty8, Necron 2009, pizz246 &amp; myself have created a new community called [Wrecked Reddit](http://www.reddit.com/r/wreckedrdt/). This is a community for anybody who likes to play video games in general. Everyone is welcome, regardless of your gaming style, choice of gaming platform, or choice of game in general. We have purchased a teamspeak server, with the info in the subreddit. Although, we encourage using all communication tools.

There will be no bans. There will be no racism. There will be no unfriendly remarks from frequent community users to new or any users.

I will continue to play with all of you and I hope you continue to play with all of us. But I personally will not be posting here any more.  Please stop by and check us out, or send any one of us a message if you have any questions. Hope to see you guys there.

1342143296.0,26,self.ps3bf3,wh4gp,Tips on shooting down air support using unguided rockets.,35,9,10,http://www.reddit.com/r/ps3bf3/comments/wh4gp/tips_on_shooting_down_air_support_using_unguided/,"I decided to make a thread about this since it's one of my favorite past times... And because I've been missing more frequently now that I'm back to playing BF3. So here is my list of tips and (I hope) other's on how to take down that one heli that just won't leave you alone. Note: This is mostly for unguided rockets (SMAW, RPG), however I will accept lock-on rocket tips even though I personally hate them.

The number one issue is the speed of the rockets. They are painfully slow and it's one of the main reasons I'm missing more frequently. If a heli isn't flying directly at you it's going to be a pain to hit them. You're going to want to aim uncomfortably far ahead of them if they are moving even at a distance of 40 meters.

When dealing with jets, the only way you'll hit them is if you're directly below their path. Attempting to shoot a jet that's to your side is damn near impossible. Since jets also move significantly faster than helis, you'll have to quickly shoot above you instead of watching the jet come towards you and taking your time to aim.

I've found that twitch shots, or shots that are quickly determined, hit more than slow and stalker-ish shots. Kinda like how you should always go with your first answer on a test since it's usually right.

I don't know why, but I think the RPG is better than the SMAW at shooting down air support. I just get more hits with the RPG than the SMAW. 

When an aircraft is coming towards you directly, do not aim at the center of the heli/jet. Instead, aim a tiny bit to the side of it's face and you should hit it more. I have no idea why, but every time I aimed right at the center, the rocket would go off to the side and miss by a sliver. 

Finally, do not be like me and be an asshat that focuses too much on shooting down air support when your team is struggling. Lol.",,False,self,t5_2sbem,False,,USANEast,True,t3_wh4gp,http://www.reddit.com/r/ps3bf3/comments/wh4gp/tips_on_shooting_down_air_support_using_unguided/,

I think *most* maps on PS3BF3 have been perfect for 24 players. Any more and the whole idea of team/squad tactics flies out the window for maps like Metro/Bazaar/Damavand/Canals/etc. Have you seen PC vids for Metro? It's about how well you can flank and shoot 20 guys in the back with an LMG. That's stupid. I like the idea of maps where one good squad can singlehandedly take control of the match and win it through beacons or flanking or similar. Having vehicle and/or infantry clusterfucks at every flag lessens the importance of the individual effort. 

It could just be my style of play, but I like being one of the game-changers. Not through KDR or MVP but through helping the team in other thankless ways, whether it's a sweet beacon or massive reps/prox scan on a good tank driver or just lone wolfing it undetected and capping a flag whilst both teams are going at it elsewhere. More players per map will lessen this potential impact and turn you into just soldier #X, with a limited amount you can do in the context of the whole match. 

It looks like the maps will be bigger (at least from the one we've seen) and that just proves my point -- if there's enough players around for every flag to be contested all the time, why ever leave a flag? Does this not breed camping mentality? I dunno. Any input from people who play both PC&amp;PS3 (spiralout?) would be appreciated, regarding the difference in approaching matches on different platforms currently.

I'd be happy enough with 32 or even 48 in a pinch. The idea of 64 though...god...the blueberries...the team stacking...game over man, game over!

Attackers use boats, and you can use the gun on the boat only. Amtrak can be used also as transport and spawn point only, **no firing the amtracks weapons**.

To all the BC2 guys, remember how crucially useful 40mm smoke was in bc2? Yeah, this is pretty much the same and yet, its presence on the BF3 Rush battlefield is way less than it was in BC2.

And bf3 is way more chokepointy than bc2. It's even more beneficial to equip this thing in bf3.

So, I've got a buttload of videos recorded of BF3 gameplay. But before I waste time editing out boring footage let me save some time and just ask three questions - 

**WHAT DO YOU WANT TO SEE on PS3BF3 in regards to PS3BF3 gameplay video?** I have linked examples to each type (none of them are mine!)


* Multi kill Montages (won't be coming from me lol, but I might follow some l33t hackers around if it was something people wanted) - http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kje3DROhkhY
* Just having fun, crazy shit, bloopers - http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=taz41PGNo1c

* Continous RDT group gameplays or highlights (bacon battles - wrecked reddit) 
* Myself (you narcissistic bastard)
* Anything and everything (I just want to see some videos on a regular basis)
* Tips and tricks and exploits


I have a lot of group gameplay, but I am not sure if you guys just want to see the exciting parts, or longer clips. I imagine you prefer videos under 5 minutes.

**Will you watch videos over 5 minutes? 10 minutes? 20 minute?**

**Music on videos - Do you want your video with gameplay sound only - or do you like some soundtrack playing in the background?** (the hard part is that you may not agree with the soundtrack... which could or could not ruin the experience for you..

I played BC2 but it stressed me out, big time - too much going on.  I played the HELL out of BF1943 - best $15 I've EVER spent on a game - and I was looking forward to getting into the modern shooter.

Well, BF3 was stressing me the fuck out - I could stand to play maybe one or two games before I'd start to get really anxious and I'd need a breather.  I figured it was just because I'm getting old and slow and I couldn't hang. (I'm almost 42.)

Anyhow, I joined the rdt clan, quietly, and bought teamspeak for my iphone, quietly, and eventually carved out the time to set them both up.  Well, the very first time I played a game with my rdt tag was this past weekend.  And I went 17/10 and was the nest player in that match in both score and kills (Conquest, Wake I.).

Since then it's all clicked,a nd I'm starting, slowly, to pwn.  I've found tons of great tips and seen tons of exciting vids.  I don't have a mic, but I'm totally down to play with a real squad sometime.  Feel free to add me: overmonkey

So GAM and I were talking about all the potentially awesome and stupid things that could happen with BF3 that haven't exactly been done yet. They can be incredibly tactical or just plain fun and ridiculous. We'll test out some next-level stuff and go from there.

There is only one requirement for recruitment:

- Must have desire to push the boundaries and not adhere to what may be considered conventional.

We're talking establishing and figuring out the effectiveness of a mortar team, carpet bombing from a Little Bird, or creating a bullet hell with a bunch of LMGs and intimidating the enemy! So sign up rats! I cannot guarantee that you'll be able to pad your ratios.

Anyways, the first project that I want to head sometime this week or next is the effectiveness of a mortar team.

So... who's down? Add me on PSN and join the [PLATOON](http://battlelog.battlefield.com/bf3/platoon/2832655391400059262/)!

Also use this to propose ideas or things that we should test out! RnD would be glad to give this stuff a shot!

**RESOURCES/GUIDES**

[Infantry Warfare Guide](http://www.reddit.com/r/ps3bf3/comments/meoui/rd_report_makenshis_guide_to_squad_infantry/)

[Synith's Jet Warfare Guide](http://www.reddit.com/r/ps3bf3/comments/m01a3/scumbag_syntihs_pilot_things_to_be_known/) is a good read.

**PROJECTS**


- **TEST 1: MORTAR TEAM**

Squad loadout:

1. Recon with MAV
2. Support with Mortar and Squad Flak
3. Support with Mortar and Squad Cover
4. Support with Mortar and Squad Suppress

Objective? Simple. The entire squad finds a safe spot to set up and be able to rain hell on possible enemy positions. The recon flies the MAV to scout and pick targets for the mortar team and the mortar team can either A) alternate fire to provide a consistent and never-ending barrage of mortar fire on a target, or B) fire all at once to create a wall of hurt to cause substantial damage to a target or target area.

I want to try this out because I really think that a mortar team can really provide a lot of support and cover for advancing allies on the point. You may not be the one doing the capping, but this should definitely be helping the team cap/defend the point by giving the enemy a hard time.

- **Carpet Bombing Choppers**, we're going to try and place some ammo packs on a Little Bird with 2 supports with C4 and Squad Explosives equipped and drop strategic C4 over the right places and targets.

- **Efficient Use of SOFLAM**, we at the RnD labs will investigate first-hand proper usage of SOFLAMs and good combinations so that our soldiers may use it in the war against productivity and doing something with your lives!

- Launching an EOD bot with c4

- **SWARM**, using MAVs only, we will create a giant cloud of MAVs that will rain upon metal blades upon the enemy infantry. This is going to probably be a troll match since there's no real way we can win a game like this.

- **Spawn Beacon**, this will be an ongoing project, but we will constantly mess around with spawn beacons and see what we can figure out about them.

- **Your suggestion here!!** Feel free to request that we try something out! We may not be Mythbusters, but I think it's always fun to try something new in games regardless of how ridiculous they may be.

More to come!

We all know that bf3 has some problems on the ps3, either glitches or hardware limitation, but the game itself is enjoyable and fun. 

Battlefield 3 single-player campaign, in my opinion of course, is brilliant. The game managed to get me attached to its *many* protagonists, get me hating on the villains and some side characters, and got me sad or happy in specific occasions.

This happens rarely nowadays, especially to me. Let me get this straight: **battlefield itself doesn't do or introruce anything new singleplayer wise**, but it managed to get those few things right.

Each character has a well defined personality, and the narration will have you hate or love them in a very specific way - which is the whoole point of the story.
The soundtrack helps you get immersed in what is happening, especially in those tragic and sad moments (vladimir anyone)?

I liked the level design, the night maps were fabulous.

battlefield 3's SP is one of those few campaign that doesn't play as a tutorial for the Mp, it has its own 'soul'. 

**tl;dr:** If you are like me and rarely play single-player do yourself a favour and start bf3 campaign: ou won't regret it.

Sure, some will say ""I love that gun"" or ""It's a good weapon,"" but no one makes it their first choice or pulls it out as their go-to gun when things get tough. 


**G3A3 is the ultimate close to medium range weapon in hardcore**


The G3A3 should always be equipped with the heavy barrel.  According to symthic.com the G3A3 has the lowest muzzle velocity of all the assault rifles at [500 m/s](http://symthic.com/charts.php?class=1&amp;sort=Class&amp;adsc=ASC&amp;attc=-).  However when coupled with the heavy barrel the velocity goes from 500 to a wonderful [650 m/s](http://symthic.com/comparison.php?wep1=G3A3&amp;attc1=Heavy+Barrel&amp;wep2=AEK-971&amp;attc2=Heavy+Barrel) putting it on par with or above all other assault weapons except for the AUG's 670 m/s.  The heavy barrel does add recoil to the weapon; however, to use it to it's full extent you will need to use this attachment.  Getting the feel for the recoil will take practice, but you can do it.  One thing that is important with this weapon is to remember not to panic.  The G3A3 gives no generosity to spray and pray.


Another interesting thing to notice is the G3A3 has a [faster TTK than the AEK-971](http://symthic.com/comparison.php?wep1=G3A3&amp;attc1=Heavy+Barrel&amp;wep2=AEK-971&amp;attc2=Heavy+Barrel) up to 35 meters in hardcore.  


It is my position that the G3A3, due to it's high recoil and higher damage is, in fact, a frontal assault close and medium combat weapon.  The two key factors to pure hardcore ownage with this gun are the user's skill with aiming and the player's ability to predict the flow of enemies. With these two things in mind the player can prepare themselves for fast ADS and target acquisition and become fairly efficient at one-hit-kill (OHK) headshots.  


OHK assault rifle?  Yes, and with the heavy barrel the G3A3 has amazing accuracy and an incredible range to get OHK headshots.  How far out you ask?  **35 Meters!**  That's around 115 feet.  Not too shabby, IMO.


""But how do I use it?"" you ask... Nearing 2,500 kill with this weapon I've found two ways that work the best.  



1) Basic bursting.  Try for 2 rounds, maybe 3.  The first round should hit the enemy's chest.  With the HB attachment the recoil of the second shot should put it on the enemy's head and finish them quickly. You may need to make small adjustments to how high up on the torso to aim to get the second shot to land on the head, but this will come with a little practice.  The reasoning for short bursts is the G3A3 loses quite a bit of it's accuracy from sustained fire. Holding the trigger if the first few shots do not hit render the gun less accurate than other rifles in the assault class during sustained fire. The 4th bullet and after will have a spread greater than that of the same bullets from an M16A3.  Also remember this weapon has a maximum of 21 bullets.  Even with a low RoF they can go quick.  This is my preferred method of firing when enemies are directly in front and moving directly towards or away from you. Once you are comfortable with this method (or if you are seasoned enough already) you may want to contrast it against going only for headshots.  I've found my headshot percentage for this weapon is 50% higher than any of the other assault rifles, you may find the same.



2) Single shot.  This is more akin to using the G3A3 like an SKS.  I find this mode better for targets moving in a more perpendicular path or when going for headshots only.  Note: you do not have to switch to single shot mode on the gun.  It's better to tap the trigger quick enough to fire a single shot.  Interesting to note is, according to symtic.com, the G3A3 with heavy barrel has a [faster bullet velocity, RoF, and overall TTK than the SKS](http://symthic.com/comparison.php?wep1=G3A3&amp;attc1=Heavy+Barrel&amp;wep2=SKS&amp;attc2=Flash+Suppressor)  



You may also alternate between quick single-shot taps and slower bursting taps depending on the situation.  



How is this gun at long range?  Fair, but depends on the situation.  If you spot an enemy sniper at long range and burst or single shot the enemy it will work.  However, I've had instances where the G3A3 felt a little weak at distances when compared to similar shots made by bursting guns such as the M16 and KH2002.  The G3A3's recoil combined with its increasing spread when fired full auto make for difficult target tracking and target re-acquisition for follow up shots.  The M16 will fire more shots per burst and generally land more with lower recoil.  This leads to faster targeting for follow up shots and a faster TTK.  Using a bipod is recommended for longer engagements.  That said and even though the gun is often referred to as a long-range weapon, I stick to my beliefs this gun excels at close to medium range for hardcore game modes and is only fair at longer ranges.  To further support this reasoning we can also look at weapon comparisons on symthic.com to compare TTK at longer distances.  


So, that's my take on the G3A3.  It's not the long range weapon it's made out to be due to the high recoil and 4th bullet+ spread.  It is a fantastic and devastating close to mid range weapon capable of OHK and devastatingly quick TTKs.

1338904428.0,25,self.ps3bf3,um24f,First Impressions of BF3: Close Quarters and Premium,27,2,52,http://www.reddit.com/r/ps3bf3/comments/um24f/first_impressions_of_bf3_close_quarters_and/,"Hi all, thought I'd report back on my experiences with Close Quarters and Premium on the PS3. I've played six or seven games, plus some time on an empty server having a look around and doing little experiments. 

(**Edit 3:**

As others have said already, DO NOT, UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES, BUY THE CLOSE QUARTERS DLC FROM THE PLAYSTATION STORE. Instead, you should buy it from the BF3 in-game store. You WILL be charged twice if you download it from the PSN store, this is apparently some sort of glitch on the PSN, although it is well documented and is mentioned on the PSN download page. Once you have bought the game, you can download it from the in-game store or the PSN store, whatever you fancy. You will not be charged twice if you download it from the PSN store. For more information and clarification, you can find video explanations on Youtube.)

Firstly, the download was very slow but stable, and installed on the first try with no freezes or pauses, so everything seems to be alright there. On the Multiplayer server browser, it was easy to find many, many severs running Close Quarters maps. There is no shortage of players online at the moment. 

Straight away, you can see that the new maps are very good looking, with occasional problems in terms of textures and lighting. Textures on vertical surfaces will occasionally blur or shimmer as though there is a light source directly above them, it is not a major issue and only seems to show up on indoor areas. 

The destruction physics are nice, there is still no B:BC2-worthy destruction, but interior walls (like office cubicle dividers) deteriorate and fall apart under fire and offer good opportunities to attack the enemy while still staying reasonably well protected. Two of the maps have a real surplus of glass... For a few minutes at most. 

Occasionally the destruction physics will barf, such as: when you shoot a particular type of indoor plant, most of the pot will be shot away, leaving the dirt floating there...

The new maps are indeed quite vertical, incorporating stairwells and occasional glass ceilings/floors. Falling damage is now a common concern - do I shoot the glass out from underneath me and attack this objective, or would the fall damage put me at a disadvantage if an enemy turns up?

In some maps, there are surplus areas that don't enhance the map much, like long, empty corridors and underground car parks. I will mostly keep quiet about that, as everybody is new to these maps and strategies will change as players work out new flanking routes, etc. 

One of the new guns in particular needs a mention - the AUG. It is awarded to the player on completion of a new, Premium-exclusive contract (Assault class). It's a very good gun and is fairly common amongst players now. I'm hesitant to come to conclusions right now, but it seems a little overpowered. It might be nothing, it might not. One thing is for certain - people are being idiots with revives now. This may be partly due to the fact that the assignment for the AUG requires 20 squad revives. Maybe people are just not thinking... Maybe they are going for revives ASAP, who knows? You can generally rely on being revived when you die, and you can generally rely on dying again shortly afterwards. This might just be a player reaction to the pressure that the new maps place you under. 

There are few players around using the spot feature now, or squad commands, because there is too little advantage. You really do need your hands on the sticks at all times, as you are under a lot of pressure most of the time.

The new maps are fairly small, with a 16-player cap. You can almost always hear gunfire, explosives such as C4 are not common, occasionally you will be nailed by a claymore. Shotguns are not common, surprisingly, and very few players choose the Recon class. I'd say that 2/3 of players are using the Assault class, 1/3 are using Support, with the occasional Engineer dotted about. 

I have not played Gun Masters yet, but the deathmatch modes work really well on the small maps, and the new itty-bitty conquest mode is well executed and fun if you're into that. The time to neutralise a flag in Close Quarters Conquest is something like 5 seconds, with 3 seconds needed to capture a flag from neutral. 

I was initially concerned that Close Quarters would make BF3 feel more like COD... It does, a little. The maps are small but not claustrophobic, and very vertical, features that COD maps lack. Despite the lack of spotting and squad commands, there is still a reasonable amount of teamwork. 

**Overall:**

Good, yes. But not worth £40.

I'll be around for a little while, anyone have any questions?

**EDIT:**

There is a new knife available in Close Quarters, it looks OK and is stat identical to the basic knife. The Premium dog tag is a right-hand tag, looks fairly cool, but there's not much to it. The server queue prioritisation is not really relevant at the moment, but it seems to work, I haven't tested it on regular maps or B2K yet. 

**EDIT 2:**

According to the schedule shown under the shiny new ""Premium"" option on the main menu, Premium Events have already been planned out and so has exclusive in-game content. These will apparently be done once per class on a pre-determined schedule.

**EDITS 4-NaN:**

Constantly uploading grammar corrections.

**EDIT 5**

Somebody else has mentioned - there IS a sound glitch, sorry, I forgot. Horizontally, the sound works perfectly. Direction, orientation, obstacles and type of weapon all make a difference in the sound you hear. Vertically, it seems there is no code to support this sort of thing yet. If somebody is firing from directly above or below you, it sounds as if they are right there next to you, regardless of what is in the way. Hearing an LMG with perfect clarity through six feet of concrete roof isn't normal, but on Close Quarters it is. This is very clearly a glitch and will probably be patched as soon as DICE can cool their servers.

1325864796.0,24,self.ps3bf3,o5ibe,BF3 Expansion ? – Operation Shikra - Storming/defending a biochem lab facility on the Afgh-Iran border. ,31,7,23,http://www.reddit.com/r/ps3bf3/comments/o5ibe/bf3_expansion_operation_shikra_stormingdefending/,"**Storyline**: The Americans have been covertly assisting the PLR, which has built an underground biochemical weapons lab facility high atop a mountain pass on the Afghanistan-Iranian border near Herat, Afghanistan. Your job as Americans is to defend this lab facility at all cost so that the PLR succeeds in developing biochemical weapons to unleash on the rear of the Russian 5th Calvary Corps engaged on the Caspian border war theater, causing mass casualties and cutting off vital supplies. Your job as the Russians is to storm this lab facility by going up the mountainside, first securing the mountain forest roads so supplies can get to this theater, then storming underground hideouts, securing more roads, then storming through a canyon where the PLR have massed heavy ground and air vehicles to defend the entrance to the sprawling lab complex. Once through the canyon the Russians then storms the remaining outside defenses of the lab facility and goes deep underground in the lab to destroy key lab equipment and chemicals to stave off a deadly attack. Good luck soldier!   


**Map 1 – Mountain Forest – Starts as day map, then night map halfway through match, little bit of snow**


Move infantry and some vehicles (jeeps, Amtracs, and little birds only) up through mountainous terrain thick with forest to capture/defend strategic bases at foothill of mountain (bases spread out laterally and in semi-circle fashion). Lots of good sniping outposts, forest cover, forest roads for jeeps and Amtracs, good map for setting up ambushes! – Medium map – 3 flags


**Map 2 – Underground Hideouts – Night map (with daylight outside hideouts exits, and snow)**


Move infantry through a series of caves and tunnels up the mountainside to capture/defend strategic hideouts (flags), with some caves and tunnels exiting onto clearings once in a while to mix it up, then back underground, some roads and open terrain for ground and air vehicles combat above ground.  Objectives are to capture/defend strategic hideouts halfway up the mountain (tunnels and caves’ complex bases spread out laterally and in semi-circle fashion) – Medium map - 3 flags


**Map 3 – Canyon – Day map with atmospheric weather (dust, wind, debris, snow)**


Move jeeps, Amtracs, littlebirds, Kashtuyas and infantry through wide canyon to capture/defend two secondary vehicle bases (tanks, helis except Havoc) a quarter of the way in for each team, and an airstrip/Havoc base in the middle of canyon, lots of cover with containers, small outposts, sniping towers, medium sized bunkers, suspended bridges linking strategic ledges on canyon wall, ladders, etc. Canyon would we linear but with twists and turns, and with a few tunnels and switchback canyons to provide flanking routes – Large map – 5 flags


**Map 4 – Biochemical Weapons Lab – Day map outside with snowy &amp; stormy weather and night map underground**


Infiltrate/defend a sprawling weapons lab above and below ground, and secure strategic areas of the lab to prevent release of biochemical weapons. Initially Russia is moving infantry, tanks and helis to storm above ground portion of lab while American/PLR defenders have AA guns, AT weapons, and a few M1 Abrams to help them defend. Once at lab, attackers have to climb up to top of lab structure then manoeuver downward through a maze of ladders, metal footbridges, platforms, and ledges to get to underground lab, where they have to manoeuver through dark hallways fraught with narrow footbridges suspended over deep chasms (if you fall in you die!). Underground portion would be interesting with flashlights and IRNV. Map would have 2 flags outside lab facilities and 2 flags deep in underground lab – Large Map – 4 flags


*Note that the following idea for an expansion pack is based on Conquest. Portions of the maps could be modified to play Rush and other modes.  For those who are curious, Shikra is a bird of prey found in Afghanistan and Iran.

Due to recent douchebaggery, you will see one minor change to the Reddit.  The mod's agreed that rules for this Reddit need to be posted and a link will be added for them in the sidebar.  These rules are;

* **Reddiquette will be followed.** Anyone who is not familiar with it can find It [**HERE**](http://www.reddit.com/help/reddiquette)

* As for rules specific to this Reddit, we now have only this - **You may not command other Redditors to post somewhere else** and  **You may not tell Redditors what they can and cannot post in here.** Asking, suggesting, and demanding are different things.  Stick to the first two.  If we mod's feel a post is not pertinent to this Reddit we may pull it at our discretion. 

Other rules may be added by the moderators of this Reddit later.

----

** *Your Platoons* **

For ALL those wanting to have their Platoons listed (even those with admission requirements), I will be adding a form and a doc to the sidebar so our Redditors can find you, find out about you, and have a link to your Platoon.  rdt clan Platoons will be moved to that form/list as well.

** *Answer one question for me regarding Reddit* **

~~I need to know the best way to keep you all updated so [**please check an answer in this ONE QUESTION survey**](http://www.google.com/moderator/#1/e=10cb88&amp;t=10cb88.40).~~  *Survey is borked.*  Also, here is another reminder to please check the sidebar every so often. I update it constantly.  

----
and finally

** *about rdt clan* ** - DO NOT TLDR THIS

As you may know, I created rdt clan during the heyday of Battlefield Bad Company 2 and r/ps3bc2.  I have worked to ensure that it is a lasting resource for ALL Redditors who are into multi-player games (especially on PS3). I have worked to make it the *best* resource available for gaming Redditors (with a lot of help from others). This is why I also created r/rdtclan among other things.  

Here we are in BF3.  I have tried to make it clear how *this* Reddit and rdt clan are not the same thing. We are two different groups that share some of the same members/subscribers.  I'll also honestly say that I (and several other good people) will not go through the effort to set up this huge collection of resources for ALL Redditors and then do it again JUST for r/ps3bf3.  Why? It's already been done with the same purpose in mind.   Unfortunately, someone who doesn't get this has accused me of using r/ps3bf3 as my personal advertisement for rdt clan.  To this....person's... credit they did point out I/we had not made rules and the inclusion of rdt clan clear to the Reddit.

Therefore with the interests of r/ps3bf3 in mind *and without having spoken to my fellow Leaders of rdt clan about this*, I am asking YOU, the subscribers of this Reddit, to make a decision for our Reddit.  **CHOOSE WHICH STATEMENT YOU AGREE WITH**, post your vote, and I will act accordingly;


* **It's not fine**. *rdt clan needs to be toned down in this Reddit*

OR

* **It's fine**. *rdt clan is a resource for all of Reddit and it makes sense to include it*

Four squads, each on it's own quest for glory, in the war-torn Death Valley. I had my brothers in arms at my side; Looney, Spiral, Tmark, Marmoy, and our enemy informant, Potroast.  

The war raged like a hornet's nest on fire. One squad gained a substantial edge against all others by holding their positions and providing medical attention to their fallen. Yet we were unafraid. We fought our way closer and closer to them. They felt their edge slowly turning dull. It was then that they revealed their secret weapon.

Black magic. Looney was the first to go. Cowardly banished from the realm in which we fought. The fight trudged on. Potroast, disguised as the enemy, sacrificed his own victory and gave reconnaissance. His intell and armor reinforcements helped continue to turn the tide of battle. The remaining few of us continued to close the gap between us and the winning squad. Then, just as victory was in our reach, the rest of my brothers fell from the realm, one after the other. Until it was only me. Me and them.

It was now that fear found me. I knew not what to do. The enemy needed but one more kill to ensure victory. But I needed two. My heart was racing, my controller shaking, and my soul overcome with grief at the loss of my friends. I hid. Trying to escape the horror. Trying to black it out.

Suddenly, bullets. Bullets tore past me like...like fucking bullets. I popped smoke and ran. I felt several violent smacks on my body. I dove to the ground and suicided. It was there, at the deployment screen, I realized something. Cowardice can not be fought with cowardice. 

I devised a plan and spawned as support with C4. I carefully and silently laid out explosives along the road. Then, I went on the hunt. The cowardly quartet had occupied the tank and were patrolling for me. I saw them in the distance and tried to draw them closer to my trap. While a safe distance away, I ran by their plain of sight. They followed. It was working. I watched and waited for them to cross my welcome mat of vengeance but they stopped, blasted my explosives, and moved on.

I had to regroup. I moved to a new position and paused for a moment to check the enemy's position. As I left the pause menu, I felt a single brutal jolt, followed my many. And as my war-soaked body fell to the ground, I saw the sniper behind me. All grew black now. Cue the music of defeat.

Defeat. That word gained new meaning for me that night. Yes, I felt the cutting clutch of defeat raining on my heart. Then, I remembered my fallen comrades. Spiral, Looney, Tmark, Mamory, Potroast. All worthy soldiers, banned for their valor, their accolades, their honor, their...clan tag too, probably. This is not defeat.

Truly understanding it can take some time and most people don't want to constantly lose at it. If you stick it out, though, you are likely to be one of the people in the running for the win, almost regardless of your ability.

So how do you win? Well, it helps to be a twitchy player, so Call of Duty players are likely to do well. You also have to be somewhat decent with each different type of gun, so the guys who have 100 hours played and have only used 5 guns are going to have a sharper learning curve. The real key to this game mode is to learn the spawns. 

Just as in TDM, the spawns like to flip locations when enemy players are deemed to be too close to it. Just by playing this game, you will learn where the enemy spawns. The key is to attempt to run between spawns because you will run into people. Novice players might not know this and it does throw the game for a loop because they are all over the map instead of where the action is. Let me get a little more in depth with each map.

**Ziba Tower**

Spawn locations will be referred to based on CQ Dom flag locations. The spawn locations are at Bravo flag, Alpha flag, and Charlie flag. Sometimes you will spawn nearby these locations. Typically, all the action occurs in the courtyard and between Bravo and Charlie on both floors. The long hallway that runs the width of the map near charlie is where you will almost always find people. Then it's just a matter of getting the kills and avoiding being knifed.


**Operation 925**

This is a big map and it can be hard to get close enough to someone who is using automatic weapons. On this game, the spawns aren't as important. You will find most action in the under construction area of the main floor as well as the cubicle area of the first floor and near Alpha flag. You will not find anyone in the basement, so avoid it. Many times, you will find people between Alpha and the long hallway in the cubicle area. Many people also stay near the stairwell to the basement in order to get those coming up. This map tends to be a more luck-based one. Sometimes you spawn away from everything and running to the action takes a fair amount of time.

**Scrapmetal**

Spawns occur at Bravo, the large stairwell near Alpha and Charlie, and also on the bottom floor near the yellow stairs that go up to Alpha. Nobody goes to Bravo or Alpha. All the action takes place between the lowest floor below Alpha and the floor below Bravo. If you spawn at Bravo, either get down a floor and go through Charlie or get down and move to the slanted walkway. You will run into people doing this and if you don't, head up the big stairwell leading up to Alpha. On occasion you will find people camping big time in certain areas, like the balcony areas. 

**Donya Fortress**

This is a moderately sized map. Action is typically found at and around Charlie. Spawns are often in the two courtyards, and at Bravo. Stay around Charlie and you are bound to run into people. Running towards the closest courtyard will usually get you a kill or two. This one is straight forward and probably the easiest to win. Keep an eye on the entrances to Charlie and you'll probably do well. Don't forget about the second floor, though. That is the best place to get kills and wait for people to come running in, but keep an eye to your left and right. because of the stairs.


There you go. It isn't super easy to win, but you can absolutely be in the running for the win if you follow these tactics. Obviously, try not to get knifed, but it isn't the end of the world.

At first it's running around like a headless chicken hoping to come across someone. I'm only now starting to understand the tactics involved which change from map to map, weapon to weapon, and even match to match. You react in a specific way to all of the above, and also take into account where you are on the gunlist in relation to other players. Each map has 2-3 areas (usually) where people inevitably congregate where you're going to get more kills than if you're randomly going around. The ""C flag"" (from DOM mode) area on Donya Fortress comes to mind, as it's pretty much the mid-ground between the spawn points, that place is always active. 

Anyway, all that aside, last night I was treated to something new. I've never seen teams or squads working together, the most you usually come across is two enemies traveling together who are probably so by chance (myself, when I see a teammate I usually go the other way because 1. I don't want to steal his kill 2. I don't want him to steal my kill. Makes sense, no? After all, the game is about individual victory, rising by yourself to the top. But I was in a set of full (8 on 8) games vs this one squad who were obviously working together. And they PWNED. I was so jealous! And pissed off (I was meant to sleep after 1-2 rounds but I got it in my brain that I HAD TO BEAT THEM so I ended up doing 5 rounds -- won 1, placed high in *most* others). Think about it: If you travel in a group of 2-4, anyone you come across will have a very slim chance of getting the kill as you're all pummeling them with bullets. One of you will get the kill, and over the course of roaming around shooting at lone wolves, your kills will even out. You rank up weapons quicker and do massive and instant damage to any poor souls you come across. Side-tactic (which they employed on the downstairs of ""flag A"" of Scrapmetal): take up opposing corner positions in a large room together, so when someone wanders in, they'll be spotted by someone, and wham bam thank you ma'am, hail of fire from all directions. I was raging at these motherfuckers, but in a good way, much respect.

We should try this sometimes.

**You need to score two Nemesis Streak Bonuses in a row to get a Nemesis Ribbon.** This ribbon shows that where you go, grown men rage and cry in frustration and curse your tag-name. This is very good.

You will obtain a Nemesis Streak Bonus on the fifth time you kill some poor guy without him killing you back. You’ll then earn a Nemesis Streak Bonus for every kill you make on the poor sap if he still can’t get you back. There are therefore two options to earn a ribbon (which is why it’s been a source of endless confusion; goddamn).

**Option I**

You get the ribbon after killing a player 6 times in a row, without them killing you – in the same round. 

Kill 5 = first Nemesis Streak Bonus. 

Kill 6 = second Nemesis Streak Bonus = Nemesis Ribbon. 

See it happen in this video: (http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BWMkef67c2I). It's a terrible video, by the way, but it's proof.

You’ll get a new ribbon each time you kill that player twice more, without them breaking your streak. So more ribbons appear on the 8th kill, the 10th, etc., until the round ends or they finally get you, eyes red with tears.

You can be shot dead in between those kills as many times as necessary but not by the hand of your nemesis victim. If they kill you, the counter resets and you need to get ‘em 6 more times in a row to earn the ribbon.

**Option II**

Double the amount of hurt feelings by killing two guys, 5 times each, without them being able to kill you back – in one round. 

5th kill on poor sap #1 = 1 Nemesis Streak Bonus.

5th kill on poor sap #2 = 1 Nemesis Streak Bonus.

2 Nemesis Streak Bonus = 1 Nemesis Ribbon and a proud Momma.

And on and on if you’re really mean, which you should be if you’re firing weapons and playing with explosives. 

Let me know if I got it right, will ‘ya?

2)  **Mortar Guns** If you don't spot, your mortar support will have no idea where to shoot.  (Mortars are aimed on a mini map).  If, on the other hand, you spot religiously, you will help get the other team killed. And you get points.

3)  **Tank Drivers** Nothing is more frustrating than a tank gunner that shoots at enemies but doesn't spot them.  Please help your driver out, and spot those pesky fucks.  It means you don't die, and you get points.

4)  You get points.

Personally, I spot instantly when I see someone / vehicle etc.  And yes, I do use [this technique](http://imgur.com/L5j16).",,False,self,t5_2sbem,False,,Europe,True,t3_lz5qz,http://www.reddit.com/r/ps3bf3/comments/lz5qz/psa_press_select_to_spot_plus_a_few_things_you/,

Some of you I'm sure remember when I [posted before](http://www.reddit.com/r/ps3bf3/comments/1grchc/rpsbf/) about making a new sub /r/psbf. 

Well the day has come and /r/psbf is now working with a full mod team and a nice new layout. 

/r/ps3bf4 and /r/ps4bf4 have both had submissions restricted and redirect to /r/psbf. In the near future (a few weeks before BF4 is released) this sub will do the same thing and we will have one sub to post all Battlefield content.

So make sure you go subscribe and feel free to start posting in the new sub. During this transition time it may be awkward having two places to post, but I suggest that people slowly start to move to the new sub to get used to the change. 

There are still things we are working on such as a filter system, link flair, updating the [wiki page](http://www.reddit.com/r/PSBF/wiki/), and general styling. 

Also feel free to make suggetsions for new user flair, things you would like to see in the sidebar or wiki, contests for custom flair, or anything else you can think of. 

If you have questions or concerns you can [let us know](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2FPSBF). I have selected the same mods that were picked for /r/ps3bf4 and /r/ps4bf4. These are people that I have seen active in the community, are calm and trustworthy, have experience being mods, know css and photo editing, or a combination thereof.

[rdtV] is an active, in-game VOIP-based platoon. We are semi-casual group that likes to communicate, PTFO, and most of all, have fun. If you've got a mic and use it in game, and are looking to play with a large group of like-minded redditors, look no further!



**Recruiting**

As always, we are always looking for new recruits to fill the ranks. What do you have to do to join the platoon? Well, head on over to [our platoon page](http://battlelog.battlefield.com/bf3/platoon/2832655391669455186/). Our first platoon (Alpha Company) is at max capacity, so we are happy to announce that we now have a brand new roster for the [rdtV], Echo Company! 

If you're interested, please apply and request access to our subreddit to become a member. We especially need more people in Europe, Asia and the West Coast. So what are you waiting for? You can find more information and a non-member FAQ on our platoon pages as well.

Your Battlelog application will be processed once you're [requested access](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2Fps3bf3voip) to our subreddit. Apply today!

We have graciously been granted the use of several servers for official events and general play:

* **Hardcore (US):**[The Number 6 Dance (CQ)](http://bf3stats.com/server/ps3_e4560392-6570-4e29-8346-efdb0a942d73)(Shade369)

In addition to the servers above, we have a [very active subreddit](http://www.reddit.com/r/ps3bf3voip) for all of our members to talk tactics, plan events, or discuss anything else on their mind. We also have a leaderboard to compare stats and improve our gameplay, a platoon event calendar to coordinate events, and a member map to show where everyone is located!

**Regular Events**

This week was particularly busy, and with the addition of so many new members we were able to hold our first internal civil war. This weekend was also time to hold some custom game modes on private servers. We are constantly looking for fun things to do in-game, so if you're looking for a break from the norm, I'm sure you'll find something you like. 

Our next planned event is the upcoming Ultracore Squad Rush tournament for squads of 4 to compete for the title. If you haven't played Ultracore Squad Rush, then you're truly missing out. The ruleset and game mode combine to produce a completely different spin on the traditional Battlefield game. Assemble your squad and see if you can make it to the top!

**Looking for Scrims**

We are actively looking for other PS3 communities to hold regular or one-time scrimmages for a little casual fun or friendly competition. We currently have an upcoming battle this weekend against the formidible JERB crew, and are currently in communication with other groups as well (including the much anticipated rematch with the TeamSpeak crew.)

So heaps of kiwi's showed up and the teams are balanced for now. Still enough room for 5 more each team, but there is over a week left so I think we will be fine.
Also, we'll use my server for simplicity. There will be a password on the day, but i will let everyone know what it is before then and ill post a reminder a few days before.

Search ""The Doctors 24/7"" or ""r/ps3bf3"". 


It looks like we'll be playing Rush. Games don't last too long so I think we should do attackers/defenders on 2 maps, so thats 4 games. and then TDM or CQ for a tie-breaker? Idk, we still have a week to figure that out. Let me know.

Sorry for the grammer/spelling and shit. Also, the incredibly long post.

EDIT: If you can't find my server it's because it has expired. Will buy another months sub on Wednesday and it will be back up. Also, teams look like they will be changed a little.

1337122830.0,22,self.ps3bf3,tp02u,Attention Noobz!!! Were you recently introduced to this Reddit and/or this game? Did you have no friends on PSN before you came here? --- WE WANT YOUR INPUT!,27,5,67,http://www.reddit.com/r/ps3bf3/comments/tp02u/attention_noobz_were_you_recently_introduced_to/,"Recently we have been trying to come up with the best way of organizing things so that new players can get more involved and find other people to play with. If you currently are or recently did go through the process of coming here and trying to find people to play with, *please give us some feedback!*

---

**The basic idea**

What was the best way you found to make friends? Did you use the regional platoons at all? Did you hop on teamspeak? Did you check out our [players list](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0Atws_ujVnGoXdGRvbW5LT0o1MzE2Vkx6VVg0Ql8wWFE)?


A lot of us trying to organize things already had a group of people that we played with so it is hard for us to know exactly what the most effective way for new players has been. 

*Please share your experience of making new friends and what you think the easiest way to find new players is.*

---

**The more in depth explanation**

The thinking right now is to make a list of players that have room on their friends list and are willing to accept new people, we are calling these people *Coordinators*. When people first come to our subreddit they can look at the list and add people that play around the same time. Another way new people can get involved is to jump into one of [our servers listed in the sidebar](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0AvyaWfCOnEqedE9wZ010V25HbmRDZ09GWkJrSlhEZnc#gid=0). If all the new players are playing on the same handful of servers, it should make it easier for them to find each other. Just add ""rdt"" as your clan tag on battlelog and then new players will know who to start adding. We will also be making a list of *""factions""* (platoons) that users have created. These factions can be made by anyone and they can be exlusive to super leet tactics or they can be as general as ""35 year olds that live in nebraska"". (Any active regional platoons will be added to the list of factions too.) New players can go through the list of factions and see if any of them seem interesting and if so apply to join. There is also TeamSpeak for those who have the ability to hook it up. New users can jump on TeamSpeak and see who is currently playing and easily jump in their game. 

So those are the ideas we have right now. As a new person, how do those ideas sound to you? From the experience you went through of finding new friends in a sea of 2800 people, do these seem effective?

I was so excited afterwards, I drove around with him limply attached to my grill hoping that a team mate would recognize. Then I remembered, he left me a repaired attack chopper back by the hanger.

[xpost from r/battlefield3]",28,4,12,http://www.reddit.com/r/ps3bf3/comments/rq5kn/i_dont_have_gear_to_record_my_games_but_i_felt/,"I'll try the best I can to portray the epicness that it was.

Use your imagination.  The US Marines are deployed onto Wake Island.  The objective, capture and maintain points of interest.  I deploy alone, as my squad has already been eliminated.  I'm sprinting through the trees down a hill to reach the objective.  It is silent all around except for the pounding of my boots and the clatter of my MG36 against my ammo supplies.  I slow down as I near the objective and deploy my machine gun on a concrete barrier.  I'm scanning the area for any hostiles.  I can hear the nearby waves crashing along the shoreline and the sun is high, casting shadows off the nearby buildings.  A hostile runs by and I line him up in my 4x scope and squeeze the trigger.  It only takes a couple rounds and he is down.  I hesitate for a second as I wait to see if he was alone or if there are others.  Area seems clear so I advance on the objective. 

As I slowly capture the objective, the calming sound of the waves and distant battles becomes fainter and fainter as another sound begins to drone them out.  The very familiar sound of air being chopped at repeatedly, it is a sound that reminds you of a nice warm day sitting in your room with the balcony door open and the ceiling fan on high while you sip on a glass of single malt scotch on the rocks while reading a book. Then reality comes crashing back at me.  Shit.  An enemy helicopter emerges from the top of a nearby hill coming straight towards me.  The pilot adjusts his nose towards me.  Suddenly rockets come blaring straight towards me leaving a cloud of smoke behind.  I begin sprinting forward and the rockets fly right over my head and explode in my footsteps.  I've taken some damage and need to think quickly as he turns around to make a second pass.  I see a nearby abandoned tank and manage to make it in.  The entire earth feels like it is trembling as the helicopter makes his second pass and begins to fire at my tank.  Luckily I have reactive armor and my tank is still functioning.  I have to act quick, his third pass will surely finish me off.  I see him turning around in the distance. He is flying low and straight at me, he won't miss a single shot this time.  I switch to thermal imaging to get a better sighting of my target.  I carefully aim above him and as he gets closer I wait for him to fly into my crosshairs.  Boom! I fire at the helicopter and send a tank shell straight through his windshield.  Enemy killed.  The helicopter flies right over my tank and explodes on impact.

Just as I thought the coast was clear I noticed that during all the excitement, a transport helicopter had landed in the objective and stolen it right underneath my nose.  I see three hostiles sprinting back to the helicopter for an evac and with my thermal imaging I easily target one.  Boom! Enemy down.  As I furiously reload my tank, the other two hostiles manage to make it back to their chopper and the pilot begins to take off obviously realizing that he is outmatched by my tank.  I won't let them get away though.  As he starts to fly away I line my crosshair just in front of the nose of his helicopter.  I'm pacing his speed with the barrel of my cannon.  Boom! Perfect shot.  The tank shell rips through the side of the helicopter and the pilot loses control.  The flaming helicopter wildly flies straight into a group of palm trees and the helicopter plummets to the ground with a spectacular explosion killing all three enemy soldiers inside.  There is a sudden stillness as I re capture the objective while the waves continue to crash onto the beach.  It is done, the objective has been captured and my reinforcements have arrived.  I drive off in my tank leaving a trail of dust behind as I head to the next objective to do it all over again.

I think it would be fun to have a few different events once in a while. I'm thinking 500% tickets on caspian. Epic battles that last a long time. Get proper squads together to have super organized games.

Since classes have just started for me, my schedule is going to be very random and unpredictable during the week, leaving only the weekends free for any type of scheduled gaming. With Wrecked Reddit already being on a friday, I'm quite used to staying home and playing BF3 every friday night; it's a great way to destress after the week. I'm going to start holding regular playing times on friday nights so people can start to work together and finally get to know others in the central platoon. This can be open to anyone from Central 1 as well since it's going to be pretty casual. Not really sure what time things will start every week (after 7 maybe? I play pretty late into the hours of the morning), again this is going to just be a casual thing. The whole point is to know others in your area will be playing and to try and get some good teamwork going so that in the future we can try to take on other platoons. **Please leave feedback on how friday nights work for you**. If a large number of people can't do fridays, anyone can feel free to organize something else, this is just when I'm available. And for those who don't know, my friends list is full so I won't be able to accept any more new people. I will be on teamspeak though so there should be other people on that you can add. 



To make things less confusing, try and use the clan tag "" ***rdtC*** "" since everyone does not know each other and people from other platoons will eventually join on me and others with large friends lists.



Depending how many people show up we may have to change servers throughout the night to let people in, but I'm guessing most nights will lose any form of structure the later the night gets.

The Bacon Battle MUST be Wednesday evening after 6PM for the latest Time Zone in your region.  Try to make this the regular time for the Wednesday night events.

For example, rdt clan USA SouthEast will start at 9PM EST

Platoon Leaders need to invite their platoon members into this event.  Make sure not to invite others outside your region.

.


-----

**rdt soldiers** In order to participate, do these things **before Wednesday night**;

* Join rdt clan by entering your info in the player database [**at this link**](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/viewform?formkey=dE5LNXllZkl3U0drb1czSGlvUi1fQ3c6MQ)

* Join BattleLog and then Join the Platoon for your Region (see list in sidebar)

* Start PSN friending others in your Region - Friend your Platoon Leaders first. Then friend others in your Region.  Look at the player list [**at this link**](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/lv?key=0Ap7RntrmbXZJdE5LNXllZkl3U0drb1czSGlvUi1fQ3c&amp;authkey=CPDks3M&amp;authkey=CPDks3M&amp;hl=en_US&amp;f=0&amp;rm=full#gid=0) to find other players who normally play when you do. It may help to filter the list by Region using the pull down at the top of the page.  When you send the PSN friend request mention Reddit and your Region, for example ""rdt clan USA SouthEast"" or ""rdt USA SE"".   ALSO Shunt made a great suggestion; ""If you want to add people as friends on PSN, add them as friends in BattleLog first, then in-game look at your Battlefeed and press Triangle on their name.""

rdt clan is WAY too big for people to try to friend everyone.  Please limit your efforts to your Region only.  Those Players who continue to join multiple Regions will find themselves booted soon.  They can rejoin, but only for their resident Region. 

*You will probably want to download teamspeak3 for your computer or phone. More info on that in a day or two.*

----

**On Wednesday**; 

* check the post for your regions time and timezone in here OR check posts in BattleLog

* Join your Region's Leaders at the designated time by going to the Multiplayer Menu, hit the start button on your controller, find one of their names in your friends list, and press 'x' to join them.

* Anyone who is a squad leader (you'll have a star next to your ID in the HUD) needs to change the squad to 'public'.  The default is 'private' which doesn't help us to gather together.

-----

**RULES**

YOU MUST READ THE RULES FOR THE WEDNESDAY NIGHT BACON BATTLE TO JOIN IN.

For this first match, The rules are simple.  **PLAY CONQUEST AND USE ONLY KNIVES, REPAIR TORCHES, EOD BOTS for the first hour** unless you are trying to take out a vehicle in which case you can use whatever you need to kill a vehicle.  Figure out how to squad up.  You can change squads if you land with non-rdt's.  After the first hour, go all weapons and work on talking to the people in your squad about where enemies are and how you should be taking flags.

If your Region's game is full, try to join others from your Region and get in another game and knife some pubbers!

knifing is more difficult and more fun that most people think.  If we do manage to get mostly full games of rdt clan, you may have the pleasure of seeing a zombie horde of soldiers chasing each other down.  Laughter guaranteed.

-----

**Check back here Wednesday afternoon for any updates.**   I promise there will be at least one change/addition you'll need to know.

-----

**UPDATES**

The TeamSpeak3 server just for rdt clan has been set up.  [**See this post for details**](http://www.reddit.com/r/ps3bf3/comments/lx1h8/be_advised_mcomm_station_rdt_is_online_teamspeak_3/) on getting hooked into our MComm station.  There is a main room for an all rdt clan chat. Every Region has their own chat room.  AND Every Region *also* has 6 sub-chat rooms just for squads.

As for setting up the games, the Leadership group has figured out how to join empty (or low population) servers.  There's still a little weird shit going on so please be patient if it takes more than one try.  It'll be worth it.

[**The new rdt clan resource website can be found here**](https://sites.google.com/site/rdtclanresources/). It's a one-stop location for all our gaming resources; player database, events calendar, how-to's and much much more.

We are semi-casual group that likes to communicate, PTFO, and most of all, have fun. Two weeks ago we [engaged in epic battle](http://redd.it/txhid) with the TeamSpeak crew and have since gained new members and experience alike.

**Recruiting**

As always, we are looking for new recruits to fill the ranks. What do you have to do to join the platoon? Well, head on over to [our platoon page](http://battlelog.battlefield.com/bf3/platoon/2832655241305523347/). We have a few simple rules:

1. PTFO
2. No spawn camping/base raping
3. Have fun
4. PTFO
5. When in doubt, refer to rules 1, 3 &amp; 4.
We're always looking for friendly people that like to work together towards a common objective.

**Weekly Events**

This week we saw a lot of action on our regular servers, as well as some very interesting and unique events. 

The best of them all was probably our Ultracore Squad Rush event. For those of you who have never played Squad Rush, squad tactics are a must and communication is key. It turned out to be an excellent exercise in teamwork. Add to that the challenge of only having 8 tickets, every death counted that much more. Most of all, it was probably the most fun I've personally had playing BF3 in a long time.

Huge thanks to andersonic for hosting and planning the event. There will be many more events like this in the near future.

**Resources**

We currently use three servers for events and general play, in addition to the normal PS3BF3 servers we typically hang out on.

* ***Hardcore (US):*** [Smokey Herbs 420 (Epic Battles)](http://bf3stats.com/server/ps3_7e8d827d-a43f-49d8-be70-2580265bc1e8) (foss333)
* ***Normal (EU):*** [The Baconator - PS3BF3 (Conquest/Ultracore Squad Rush)](http://bf3stats.com/server/ps3_1775ce44-e720-4cf4-8bc9-51b7c78bf337) (andersonic)
* ***Normal (EU):***  [PS3BF3 EU flyingdodo (Rush)](http://bf3stats.com/server/ps3_2709a6da-8fc2-424d-b4fa-d430f4bf58a6) (flyingdodo)

If you can't find us there, we're typically on any of the [other PS3BF3 servers listed here.](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0AvyaWfCOnEqedE9wZ010V25HbmRDZ09GWkJrSlhEZnc#gid=0)

In addition to servers, we have recently added a platoon calendar for events which we encourage all our members to plan and coordinate. We also have a very active subreddit all of our own for members to discuss pretty much anything on their mind.

**Still curious?**

Feel free to give myself or any of our platoon leaders a message if you're interested or have any questions at all. 

* **jumboness** *(PSN:Nesstickle)* (US/EST)
* **foss333** *(PSN:foss333)* (US/CST)
* **nino1124** *(PSN:nino511)* (US/EST)
* **ShootingScarz** *(PSN:ShootingScarz)* (US)
* **sickman** *(PSN:andersonic)* (EU) 
* **frogsaregreen** *(PSN:whonosewhoknows)* (APAC) 

**Looking for Scrims**

Lastly, we are looking for other PS3 communities to hold regular or one-time casual scrimmages for a little fun and friendly competition. If you're interested, please contact myself or the leaders listed above.

So was playing a few games on a server, things are going well, my team is good and we hold down Kharg Island, no sweat.  Next game, Gulf of Oman, spawn and instantly get admin killed... then admin switched to other team... weird, but no biggie. game is early, fight on!  My team quickly captures every flag but B and I am en route with one of my squadmates.  As I drive over there, my squadmate, who was gunning for me, just disappears.  Again, I'm like, huh... but no biggie, keep on fighting.  At this point I see that we are losing all bases and then I am killed by a Jet or Heli, dont recall.   So as I am about to respawn, I notice I don't have a squad anymore, then I bring up the team screen, and my entire team consists of 4 people!  The other team completely full.  

At this point I am finally realizing that something douchey is going on, but refuse to quit.  I squad up with the only other person who appears to still be playing and we wreck shop!  Just the two of us are able to hold off a team of 12 until reinforcements arrive, eventually more people join the server and we are back up to a 9-10 man team.  But the damage was done, we were down like 240-140 tickets.  But with a team back behind us, me and my new squadmate (I hope you're out there somewhere) continue our epic under dog comeback and soon have the game back close, then tied and then finally back on top!  We are up, 75-50 tickets, holding down 3/4 bases, when all of a sudden... screen freezes, LOADING... [YOU HAVE BEEN BANNED FROM THIS SERVER].

Damn.

So all I can do is try and spread the word.  Don't play this guys server.

(it's a contest... commence shit talkin'!),22,1,114,http://www.reddit.com/r/ps3bf3/comments/osoc0/rps3bf3_platoon_points_whoring_showdown_to_the/,"A contest to challenge even the most seasoned Battlefield veterans… teamwork, dedication, skill, precision and shameless points whoring… have you got what it takes? This is open to everyone and there is no obligation to join a clan, be on any list or be part of any regional platoon.

To participate, organize and create a platoon of 5 players (four main one alternate although the alternate is optional), then [submit your players’ information](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/viewform?formkey=dFhSMENPejU0SDE4YWl0ZDQxQmczS0E6MQ#gid=0), platoon name and intended clan tag using the form below, prior to 11:59 pm EST on 28 January 12.  For the purposes of this contest, players may only join one participating platoon.

Squads will play BF3, that’s it, just fucking play, have a good time, and submit one image/screenshot of their single highest score attained during a single match. This should be screenshot of the final scoreboard of a match or screencaps of the battlelog of that match from their battlelog (keep in mind battlelog only saves the last 15 so take the screencap soon after the match ends just to be sure) or both. The squad with the single highest squad score in a single match will win.  Some sort of time stamp demonstrating when the photo was taken should be present in the screencap (holding a phone with date/time showing in the photo you take or other cretinous means of verification is acceptable).

**The rules** (simple as hell folks)

At least 2 registered squad members must be playing in the squad for the high score to qualify. This is limited to a minimum of 2 because timings and life things can make it difficult to get together.

While squadding up and playing within your own platoon is highly encouraged, submitting a high score for your platoon with competing squad members or randoms included in the squad is acceptable. Competing squad members however must understand that squadding up with two or more members from an opposing squad for casual play creates the risk that their performance may potentially contribute to the win of the opposing squad. If you wish to avoid that risk, do not play with two or more folks from the same opposing squad.

Platoons should identify themselves using their clan tag at all times so opposing players who may drop in know they are playing with their competition.

A player is a winner if their squad obtains the highest submitted score. This will be the case even if they were not present at the time the winning score was achieved.

In cases of only 2 registered squad members present when a high score that is being submitted was captured, original registered squad members must have earned at least 60% of the total submitted high score in order for the submission to count.

Squads will have a bit over 2 weeks to play and record their high scores, starting from the registration deadline (28 January 12) to play the shit out of BF3 and try to improve their scores, and submit their highest score.

Any mode can be played however honest play without boosting is a must.

High scores must be submitted no later than 11:59 pm on 13 February 12 by screencaps uploaded to imgur.com. Links to the screencaps are to be sent by PM to reddit username nerdigurumi. Platoons should wait until they have reached their absolute highest score and only submit their very highest but if there is a case of premature submission, please PM nerdigurumi to update your submission.

Example scenario clarification for anyone confused about squad composition:

Alpha, Squint, Bean-Circles and dxdydz are in Platoon A

Pudge, Bizkit, snackled and eazeu are in Platoon B

A winning score is submitted for Platoon A where Alpha and Squint played with a random player and Eazeu. That means that Platoon A (Alpha, Squint, Bean-Circles and dxdydz ) are prize and contest winners and Eazeu is not a winner and gets the shaft.

[Again, the signup form is here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/viewform?formkey=dFhSMENPejU0SDE4YWl0ZDQxQmczS0E6MQ#gid=0), comment below if you have any questions.

And I think an innocent bystander is the best way to do it without any drama. ,27,7,92,http://www.reddit.com/r/ps3bf3/comments/oome3/hi_guys_please_take_a_look_here_some_interesting/,"Soundnerd has stepped down as mod here. I don't really understand the state of rdtclan at this time but he owns those subs. He has asked that we no longer associate ourselves with it. He has decided to completly close rdtclanhq which is where the region leaders meet to set up events and rules. 

Regardless of everything - us playing together will not change! Before someone comes and tries to create ANOTHER gaming group to spread us out even more I propose the following:

* Events for us playing together should be posted here in r/ps3bf3. We already do this anyway.

* Region clans should stay together. I think this is the best idea to come out of rdtclan. If you want to take your region and go make r/rdtregion so that you can talk about events and strategy  AWESOME. rdt west already did so. But we should still keep posting events and news here! R/ps3bf3 should remain our core. 

* I have put a lot of time into rdtclan and a bit peeved that everyone had to be so whiny about everything.  Edited: deleted information that really doesn't matter. 

* Mods I hope this isn't a problem. You guys haven't said anything about us posting rdtclan events in here before so us just posting normal events shouldn't make any difference. 

* PLEASE DO NOT MAKE ANOTHER GAMING GROUP. It's hard enough to find people to play with already. I will not be leaving the shelter of ps3bf3 until r/ps3bf4 is up and thriving. hmmmmm.... brb. ok i didn't want some karma whore going and making it so this one is donated to r/ps3bf3. 

That is all. ~~Maybe edits~~. I dunno. Go back to playing. 

EDIT: I am no longer able to access r/rdtclanhq. If you were a part of it and didn't see the post please message me. 

EDIT EDIT: I don't think we should have to change our region clan tags. Instead of rdt we are rdtregion. Our tags already strike fear in the heart of our opponents and fuck you I ain't changing it. 


Edit Edt edit: clarified what I meant about creating your own sub.

I understand why a lot of people aren't any good at capture the flag. It is a very difficult game to follow....
Just a couple tips:
1. Your flag must be present at your base to score.
2. It helps to have a team of defensive and offensive players.
3. Use the crap out of your mines. 
4. If you have the enemy flag, and the enemy has your flag; bring the enemy flag back to your base and get in a spot where you can be defended. If I see someone with the enemy flag running around like an idiot trying to play offense again I'm goin to freak out!

Mainly chaotic mayhem, but it was so casual that no one really got too messed up about it.  I did have a few observations that might help to keep things on the up and up though:

[Smoke 'n Knives - Operation Metro TDM - Knife, M320 smoke \(not under-barrelled\):](http://battlelog.battlefield.com/bf3/battlereport/show/59385524/4/307405213/) Absolute mayhem!  This was our first match of the night and it was perfect for getting settled in to the feel of the night.  There was a little confusion about some of the minor rules, like is it ok to drop ammo and medpacks(it was), or whether revives were ok(also legit).  If you've never set up this game, try it, it was a great icebreaker.

[Fraglight mode - Scrapmetal DOM Auto shotgun with frag rounds, tac light](http://battlelog.battlefield.com/bf3/battlereport/show/59386681/4/307405213/): Same deal with the medpacks/ammo boxes and revives. It took a little time to remember that we were also capping flags!  Spawn beacons and sensors seem to be alright too. 

[Battlefield 1861 - Caspian Border TDM - Bolt-action rifle with no attachments, .44 magnum, knife](http://battlelog.battlefield.com/bf3/battlereport/show/59387958/4/307405213/):  This is probably where there was the most confusion.  Technically speaking, it's basically straight up bolt action, ie. no straight pull or other gadgets including spawn beacons or sensors.  It's supposed to be 1861, so to see people setting motion sensors or parachuting in was a little out of place, but for future reference, these are a nono.  A great setup though, we all had a blast

[Torch 'n Paddles - Donya Fortress DOM](http://battlelog.battlefield.com/bf3/battlereport/show/59389258/4/307405213/) - Repair tool, defib:  This was a total CLUSTERFUCK! imagine 12 people jumping around, trying to repair torch each other!  I laughed til I cried!  Trying to capture flags and avoid a firey death was hilarious!  It seemed that the torch people were doing most of the capturing, and the paddle people were doing most of the reviving.  So hard to concentrate on capping flags, but so fun!

[Scope with it - Operation Firestorm TDM - .44 Scoped](http://battlelog.battlefield.com/bf3/battlereport/show/59390391/4/307405213/). So fun!  A wide open match with a close quarters weapon.  A very close match, revives, ammo, and beacons/sensors seem to be allowed, so it made the strategy side a little more interesting.

[Elton John mode - Operation 925 DOM - SMAW, RPG](http://battlelog.battlefield.com/bf3/battlereport/show/59391280/4/307405213/):  Also a very challenging mode, where revives, medpacks, and other gadgets were allowed except for MAVs and TUGS, as far as we could see.  Unfortunately, a lot of people crashed out of the server at this point and for many of us this was the end of the evening.  Still, a great night.

[Litter Bugs - Grand Bazaar TDM](http://battlelog.battlefield.com/bf3/battlereport/show/59402532/4/331578563/) - No restrictions, but you must pick up the kit of the person you just killed before you kill again.

[Resident Evil - Ziba Tower DOM](http://battlelog.battlefield.com/bf3/battlereport/show/59403285/4/331578563/) - Shotgun (iron sights, buckshot), PDW (iron sights, laser), pistol. You cannot move and shoot or ADS.

All in all, a fantastic night.  We JERB's have a couple of servers that we would be happy to set up parallel to #6D if more people were interested in joining.  What might help would be to establish a few common rules, some things that we noticed did or did not work.  Everyone had fun, and we would like to see more people turn out for these unusual game formats.

If you're not familiar with TeamSpeak then check out the [Info Guide](https://docs.google.com/document/pub?id=1sxEWQG5iAoSo4fdT2npUaXMyBzxq9y5eBKGdMTZ6kdE).

For my current set up I use the [Sony Wireless Stero Headset](http://store.sony.com/webapp/wcs/stores/servlet/ProductDisplay?catalogId=10551&amp;storeId=10151&amp;langId=-1&amp;partNumber=PS398085) and connect them to my computer for TeamSpeak (with my PS3 audio running to my computer). Pretty standard TeamSpeak set up that I think others may have as well. The problem was how to use this and VOIP at the same time. It's simple actually, and pretty cheap too.

What I bought:

* [USB External Soundcard Adapter](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0027EMHM6/ref=s9_simh_gw_p147_d1_i2?pf_rd_m=ATVPDKIKX0DER&amp;pf_rd_s=center-2&amp;pf_rd_r=0Y93YWTYGG1EX5999YZY&amp;pf_rd_t=101&amp;pf_rd_p=470938631&amp;pf_rd_i=507846)
* [3.5 mm clip on mic](http://www.amazon.com/3-5mm-Hands-Computer-Lapel-Microphone/dp/B005DJNRQM/ref=pd_ybh_15)

The whole thing costs about $6 

Just plug them all together and plug the USB into your PS3. Go to your mic settings and make sure the USB device is selected as your mic input. Now it's possible to use that mic for VOIP while still using the existing headset I already have for TeamSpeak. 

I use the clip-on to mount it to my Sony headset [like this](http://i.imgur.com/EWL3v.jpg) so that both mics are right by each other. The USB adapter also has a mic mute button so I can always have this set up and choose when to turn my VOIP on or off.

Knowing that you practically one man Armied a game is kinda bad ass, but I find its not how many kills you get, but how many deaths you prevent.

I like being a sniper in this game. It can bring a overwhelming sense of satisfaction if you help your team by placing well placed shots that kill the enemy and save your team mates.  The nicest thing about being a sniper is that on hardcore 1 hit kills with the bolt actions make you a force to be reckoned with. You can literally save a squad from getting wiped out with that one perfect shot on to a target killin' him before he kills your team mates. If you have a good hide you can be a one man defense on you Flag or M-Comm. I digress though.

As I was saying Actions are loudest thing in this game. I love saving team mates or reviving team mates. Kills are nice, but Medical Efficiency Ribbons are nicer or how bout resupply efficiency or that Repair Ribbon? I feel the more of those you have the better of a value you are to your team. Lets not forget about the Flag Cap or Flag Defense Ribbons either or the M-Comm attacker or Defender ribbons. 

This game is nice when a guy or gal just kills tango's left and right, but how bout those unsung hero's the ones that revived supplied and repaired. Lets give it up for those guys they deserve the thanks.

UPDATE 3: For those of you unwilling to use google, here's how you put your ps3 into recovery mode:

OK. If you have an original PS3, do the following:

* Turn off the PS3 System
* Hold down the power button until you hear 2 quick consecutive beeps
* It should boot into recovery
* Plug in a controller with the USB cable
* Select ""Restore Filesystem""

If you are on a PS3 Slim, there's an extra step:

* Turn off the PS3
* Hold down the power button. You should hear 3 equally spaced beeps, and your system will turn off
* Release the power button, then hold it again until you hear 2 quick consecutive beeps.
* You should now be in recovery mode, and the screen should tell you to plug in a controller with your USB cable.

But just wanted to ask around if people think the game is worth buying now for someone like me who hasn't played any Battlefield games before.

Is the learning curve steep? Do a lot of people still play? Is it easy to find a game? Does it run well on the PS3? Is the game rewarding? How long can I expect to play multiplayer before it becomes a ghost town?

I'd love to hear input from anyone.

I have been working with Nismo210 to develop some fun ideas for a tournament that everyone here can participate in. We have come up with two events that we think will be fun. Both events will be focused on vehicles and teamwork!

---

**THE FIRST EVENT**

*RHIB BOAT CHALLENGE*

    Rules:
   * Teams of 2. One driver and one gunner
   * Cannot get out of boat
   * Gunner can use boat gun or RPG/SMAW only
   * Driver cannot switch seats unless gunner dies
   * Gunner cannot drive unless driver dies
   * Repairs/health/ammo are fine 
   * First team to have both players die loses round (no respawning)
   * After each round, teams will restart at their deployment's boat spawn
   * After 3 rounds, the team with the most wins will advance in the bracket
   
This event will take place on an unranked server on Kharg Island. Settings will be custom with normal settings except for no minimap and no 3D spotting. Events will be moderated so that there are no disputes about winners. Exact times of events will be determined when we know how many people are participating. We should be able to figure out a way so that everyone can participate. We may have a few match times for people in various timezones. A tournament bracket will be set up and a winning team will be determined elimination style (winning teams will face off until only 1 team remains).


---

**THE SECOND EVENT**

Will be announced in the future near the end of the RHIB Boat challenge. Stay tuned ;)

---

**WHAT DO YOU GET FOR WINNING?**

FLAIR! Glorious flair! Similar to the one you see next to my name, we will make custom flair that only the winning team will get to have. There is also a high chance I will record the matches and make a video of the winner.

**WHAT YOU SHOULD DO RIGHT NOW!**

Reply to this post saying if you are interested or not. We need to know how many people are interested before we can iron out the finer details. Apply to [the platoon](http://battlelog.battlefield.com/bf3/platoon/2832655241491718048/) and follow the instructions there. I will make another post with more details after we see how many people are interested.

Most wielders would probably just go to the old sneaky run and gun Suppressor or flash, (anyoptics) and foregrip. I must say there is another way that works and this is to use heavy barrel, foregrip and kobra RDS(my choice) since when you aim down sights you get a significant amount of accuracy,although it adds recoil the foregrip compensates with it and it also has a more tighter spread. It will also take down short to mid range targets and burst for long ranges. Lastly, even though the description says that the heavy barrel decreases the hip fire accuracy, I bellive this is false since i'm able to hip fire targets about 2-6 metres away from me.

We are semi-casual group that likes to communicate, PTFO, and most of all, have fun. Three weeks ago we [engaged in epic battle](http://redd.it/txhid) with the TeamSpeak crew and have since gained new members and experience alike.

**Close Quarters**

The new DLC is here and some of you have already been enjoying the new maps and game modes. Throughout this week those with Premium or CQ content can head over to [one](http://bf3stats.com/server/ps3_b5f68621-a576-484d-b590-f7b45b6a059d) of our [CQ servers](http://bf3stats.com/server/ps3_18bb4401-09a2-43c7-b877-46007472564c) (Hardcore) or team up with other platoon members to tackle the new content. Of course this is a transitionary period, and some people may not have the DLC as of yet. For those of you who don't, there are plenty of us that still play on normal vanilla and Karkand maps.

We're eager to test our mettle on the new game modes and maps. Join us!

**Recruiting**

As always, we are looking for new recruits to fill the ranks. What do you have to do to join the platoon? Well, head on over to [our platoon page](http://battlelog.battlefield.com/bf3/platoon/2832655241305523347/). Currently our platoon is at max capacity, and on June 15th we'll be making adjustments to our rosters to make room for active players. In the mean time, please apply and request access to our subreddit to become a member. A slot will be made available for you once we've made the roster adjustments.

We have a few simple rules:

1. PTFO
2. No spawn camping/base raping
3. Have fun
4. PTFO
5. When in doubt, refer to rules 1, 3 &amp; 4.
We're always looking for friendly people that like to work together towards a common objective.

**Resources**

We have graciously been granted the use of three servers for official events and general play, in addition to the normal PS3BF3 servers we typically hang out on.

* ***Normal (EU):***  [PS3BF3 EU flyingdodo (CQ DLC)](http://bf3stats.com/server/ps3_2709a6da-8fc2-424d-b4fa-d430f4bf58a6) (flyingdodo)

If you can't find us there, we're typically on any of the [other PS3BF3 servers listed here.](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0AvyaWfCOnEqedE9wZ010V25HbmRDZ09GWkJrSlhEZnc#gid=0)

In addition to the servers above, we have recently added a platoon event calendar which we encourage all our members to plan and coordinate. We also have a [very active subreddit](http://www.reddit.com/r/ps3bf3voip) for all of our members to discuss the game or anything else on their mind. Lastly, we've created a leaderboard on [BF3Stats.com](www.bf3stats.com) to compare stats and improve our gameplay. Where do *you* stack up?

**Still curious?**

Feel free to give myself or any of our platoon leaders a message if you're interested or have any questions at all.

**Looking for Scrims**

Finally, we are looking for other PS3 communities to hold regular or one-time casual scrimmages for a little fun and friendly competition.

**Hump Day Meet and Greet**

We'll continue to hold weekly VOIP events, and this week is no exception. We'll continue with our Hump Day meetup on Wednesday nights, and we'll have several more upcoming regular events planned for the weekends. Right now you can find us on the following servers:

* ***Hardcore:*** [Smokey Herbs 420 (Civil War Mix)](http://bf3stats.com/server/ps3_7e8d827d-a43f-49d8-be70-2580265bc1e8) (foss333)

We're also looking into holding events this Friday and Saturday, and I'm hoping we should have a good turnout for the Memorial Day Weekend. Details on our Hump Day Meet and Greet event coming SOON!!!

**Leading the way**

Have you met our platoon leaders? If not, feel free to say hi! They've been crucial in getting this platoon off the ground and continue to be active and supporting of all things VOIP:

* **jumboness** (*PSN:Nesstickle*) (US/EST)
* **foss333** (*PSN:foss333*) (US/CST)
* **nino1124** (*PSN:nino511*) (US/EST)
* **ShootingScarz** (*PSN:ShootingScarz*) (US) 

We also have two new platoon leaders!

* **sickman** (*PSN:andersonic2525*) (EU) - Andersonic has not only been kind enough to lend us his server, rumor has it he's got some sweet scheduled events in the works. Stay tuned!
* **frogsaregreen** (*PSN:whonosewhoknows*) (APAC) - Did you know we have players on the other side of the planet? Well, it's true, and frogs is the guy to talk to if you're looking to play in the APAC region.

These guys have stepped up to help out and delivered. If you're looking to get active in VOIP matches or joining the platoon, PM me or any of the guys above. We're happy to help.

*I am also looking for a US West-coast member to help coordinate with our friends in the PST zone. PM me if you're a member of the platoon and interested.*

**Reporting for Duty**

We are still actively recruiting, so head over to [our platoon page](http://battlelog.battlefield.com/bf3/platoon/2832655241305523347/) and apply if you're looking to play with some fellow VOIP users. If you have any questions about our platoon PM myself or any of our platoon leaders above for more information.

We've also created a subreddit for all the latest news and posts from the platoon. Head over to /r/ps3bf3voip if you want to join in on the action. Platoon members only, please.

So Caspian Border starts up...at about 4 minutes in, I luck out and spawn at base camp with the attack helicopter unoccupied.  I get in start it up, and begin to take off, when I notice a new spawner below me.  (You can probably see where this is going...)

So Good Guy haldex9000 (me) lands the helicopter so my teammate can jump in and be a gunner.  (Mind you, I most certainly did NOT need to do this).  The smurf pulls out his hand gun and proceeds to shoot me in the head, killing me.  He jumps up and down a few times, gets in the helicopter, and takes off.

I was speechless.  I wasn't even angry, I was.... stunned.

As many of you know, Battlefield 4 is set to come out later this year, and as expected we will have a new sub for it. [u/dmanwithnoname](http://www.reddit.com/user/dmanwithnoname) secured the subs for /r/ps3bf4 and /r/ps4bf4 nearly a year ago so luckily we do not have to deal with the trolling that happened in /r/battlefield4. 


**What we are looking for**

We need mods for a few different reasons. There are the obvious mod duties such as going through the spam folder and watching out for inappropriate content. We also need some good CSS wizards that can make the sub look nice and create a nice sidebar and wiki. I feel it is also important to have mods that are active in the community. For this reason I wanted to ask for users already involved in this community that I know will do a good job getting players involved in the game. It is my hope that some of the new mods will be able to help create official events, reward custom flair, and keep players involved in the game!

You don't have to meet all these requirements to apply. If you just want to help in one area then let me know. You can either reply here or send me a PM if you have any personal concerns. Also if anyone knows of someone that is a god at coding but isn't involved here, we could still use their help.

1348725913.0,18,self.ps3bf3,10jve8,ps3bc2 seems so far away.,35,17,108,http://www.reddit.com/r/ps3bf3/comments/10jve8/ps3bc2_seems_so_far_away/,"so tonight was a bit of a bummer.  it started in bc2 with a bunch of old school guys...pez, buddha, looney, bean, and syntih.  it was great playing with so many of the guys from the ps3bc2 days and a lot of the newer guys got in on the action.  everything was going great for a while.  

once we moved over to bf3 things changed dramatically.  at this point most of the older guys had moved on.  there seemed to be a lot more unwarranted shit talking.  some of it was pointed at me and i'm not really sure why.  

i think we just have a new guard that seems unwilling to conform to the values we used to carry.  i'm obviously not directing this at everyone, as not everyone was involved, but things have obviously changed.  shit talking, without any sort of context, can only be taken as offensive.  

that being said, i've got thick enough skin, i could care less if people don't like me or want to talk down to me.  no biggie.  my main problem was with the ridiculous amount of racism.  this wasn't just joking around kind of stuff.  it was pure, unfiltered racism.  the ""n"" word was uttered more than just a couple of times and it wasn't always in a playing manner (not that it should matter).

i'm not here to throw anyone under the bus, but there was one person in particular who used the word like it was going out of style.  

do we need to talk like that while we're playing together?  and what does it say about our community that it was being said on our teamspeak channels?  i'm sure that not everyone in this community is ok with that kind of language.  what if new people were to join our teamspeak channels in hopes of finding a welcoming community and instead found racists?  i for one would not be ok with that.

i hope this can be cleaned up soon, but i'm quickly losing faith in what used to be an amazing community.  that being said, i still value the friendships i've made with a lot of you, and i hope that all of you can agree that we need to clean up our act.",,False,self,t5_2sbem,False,,USASEast,True,t3_10jve8,http://www.reddit.com/r/ps3bf3/comments/10jve8/ps3bc2_seems_so_far_away/,

I came in a little late to the party and only caught the back end of these, taking part in probably half a dozen or so Smoke'n'Knives matches.

As some of you know, BC2 did not have the wonderful server functions that bless us now yet still these 'events' happened with some regularity and success. Before the days of Team VOIP and TS we used to use the PS3 chat room function to organise.

Anyhow, I don't recall seeing any such match since we moved house and was just casually wondering if any were on the cards. They would be much easier to 'manage' now...especially with this new 'Match Function' that seems to be on the horizon.(forgive my lack of knowledge on this..I just wait for you lot to tell me anything new now)

The End, was an old idea I had back in those BC2 days when I believe MuzFuz was asking for game ideas..It went something like this:

One of my favourite gaming experiences was the first time I played 'The End' in MGS3.. ( I won't say anything about it for fear of spoilers but I would guess that most of you know the drill)

In BC2, 'Heavy Metal' was a map I rarely played but it always stunned me a little when I did. 

Running through that vast green valley one day, with the wookies hiding on either side, taking potshots from seemingly miles away..I was inspired to recall my battle with The End, hiding, running, hiding, running, sneaking, hiding, running, looking, listening, noticing, running, hiding[well, you get the picture] and I started to develop the idea of an homage in a custom BF game.

The idea was never formed fully, like most I have and we never put it into practise but I had an idea of a lone Snake having to traverse the entire map whilst everyone else hunts. I was thinking along the lines of Bolt Action Snipers Rifles only, no vehicles.

The hunter who kills snake, becomes snake and we continue. Hunters would have a certain territory they could move freely in.. [ya know someone with knowledge of maps and gaming strategy could work that bit out]... but would only be able to communicate with another hunter if within earshot(would have taken great trust in BC2, could now be monitored on TS).

At the far end of Heavy Metal was a warehousey type building that I imagined could either contain someone to kill FTW(maybe if Snake gets there all Hunters put down there weapons and converge on the building where Snake takes on the Final Hunter--The Big Boss?? in a knife fight) or just have it as the end point.

For BF3: The End, I think Caspian would be the best alternative..Deployment to Deployment.

Anyway that was my idea..but I'd be happy to try some Zombies or some more Smoke'n'Knives.",,False,self,t5_2sbem,False,,Europe,True,t3_wrrxc,http://www.reddit.com/r/ps3bf3/comments/wrrxc/the_end_a_battlefieldcustom_idea/,

Following objects or taking quick aim is very much a random affair and it's sucking away all my confidence. If I come into a straight firefight with anybody I'm dead. It's slowly ruining a game that I enjoy quite a lot.
A quick look at my [battlelog](http://battlelog.battlefield.com/bf3/soldier/DonDDL/stats/306277729/ps3/) will show just that. Most of my kills are with tanks, because their slower, more considered movements and shots work better for me and the controller.

Now the obvious and best answer is practice practice practice, but I'm neither 14 nor unemployed, and just don't have hundreds of hours to hone the craft. Playing around with sensitivity hasn't really helped.

So the question is, are there any tips/tricks that people have picked up over time? Certain training regimens that are more time efficient than just straight playing? All the skills from playing in a CS 1.6 clan over a decade ago don't translate too well.

I'm not looking for cheap tricks, or to become a pro player, just some help so I can enter the battlefield with confidence and be more helpful.

I noticed something yesterday that I wanted to share.  In the server browser, you can limit your view to DICE run servers only. (There is a check box in the filter that's accessable by pressing R3 to ""show running games from Official EA servers."" Uncheck that, get the DICE servers only.) Why would you want to do this?..  Because the game play seems to be better.  I know this is my own opinion, however let me give some examples as to why I think the EA servers are crap.

First, the EA servers seem to be an older version of the server.  The DICE servers all allow you to queue up to a game on a specific server from the server browser.  When you attempt to join a game on a DICE server that's full (or a friend's game) it adds you to a queue for that server.  When someone quites, you join in!  Secondly, The labels of kit specializations on squad-mates (like ""SPRNT"" or ""FLAK"") appear on the respawn screen.  This isn't something that I have seen on every DICE server, but it is there on most.  Lastly, the game doesn't jump around as much. 

Well, that last one does seem to be opinion based, but you get the point:  Limit yourself to DICE servers in your region only and get a better gaming experience!

This is also my suggestion for our bacon matches on Wednesday, use the DICE servers only.  If we pick a server in each region that's run by DICE, we can simply queue up on that server and take it over... One. By. One.

You DON'T have to be good (they let me play).  It's about hitting the Battlefield with Redditors, chatting away (text and/or voice), and helping each other kick some ass.

Please also understand that rdt clan and r/ps3bf3 are not the same.  rdt clan has several Reddits and several games we are dedicated to.  We like to think of it as *assisting* Game Reddits.

**How does this work**

* enter your info in the player list [**here**](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/viewform?formkey=dE5LNXllZkl3U0drb1czSGlvUi1fQ3c6MQ)

* join the Platoon for your region - DO NOT join more than one rdt clan platoon, you may get booted from the wrong region.  See the sidebar for links to the Platoons

* PSN friend everyone in your region, especially the Leaders.  Include in the friend invite that you are from Reddit and what region you are in.

* Be BRAVE!!! Join these new friends (FELLOW REDDITORS mind you so they are all cool people like you) when you play Battlefield 3.  You should also invite these new friends into your games/squad.

* For now you will battle WITH each other and if your Platoon Leader (we sometimes call them Region Group Leaders or RGLs) is up for it, they may organize some battles for you to mix it up amongst yourselves.

* In about three weeks, I will have figured out how we are going to start having Region vs Region Battles.

------

**Next week should be the start of two other rdt clan events.**

* I host what I call 'soundnerd's Wednesday Night Bacon Battles' - sometimes I even set up special challenges where you can win Bacon.  There is a link in the bottom of the sidebar where you can suggest types of Battles and vote on them.

* PeZoAm0 hosts Friday night's Wrecked Reddit - the point is to play trashed and just have fun.  This is EPIC shit and always freakin hilarious.

Please do not ask us to change event details after we post about them.  You can PM us if you have requests.

These will be added to the [**rdt clan calendar of events**](https://www.google.com/calendar/embed?src=7ro2cbrtoq9kvhc5n818r7iqj0%40group.calendar.google.com&amp;ctz=America/New_York) which is also listed in the sidebar.

This time it will be a rematch of the EPIC battle's that took place between myself, and Cryptic-Panter.  If you weren't there for the first meeting, Team Don't Die BARELY squeezed by on a 3-2 victory with some amazingly tense moments.  

The maps and details are the same, and are all listed below.  If you'd like to take part in this, please comment here or PM either of us.  This is first come, first serve so get in fast!


**Details**

9 months ago we organised a AUS vs NZ scrim. (original thread [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/ps3bf3/comments/uxkbr/aus_vs_nz_upcoming_match_info_its_not_too_late_to/) and [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/ps3bf3/comments/vgyix/congratulations_to_new_zealand_ps3bf3_team_who/)) NZ came out on top but overall it was a ton of fun and I wish we had done this again sooner.


Please let me know if you are keen to play for either AUS or NZ, what day and what time, and most importantly what expansions you have. 

 Also please suggest what maps and game modes you are keen to play as everything below is really just a template until we figure out what works best for everyone. Suggest maps/modes by writing a comment with your suggestion and nothing else (eg, Operation Metro - Rush) and if you agree please upvote. **DO NOT** downvote if you disagree. 


We will play **1** warm up round, but this will mainly just give us time to let everyone join and get the teams sorted, and **3** other rounds, playing each rush map twice to give everyone a fair go at attacking/defending. I would love to play more but I'm not sure if everyone will have time as this could take between 1-2 hours.

I'm also hoping we can have a practice round the Sunday with whoever is available.  

So far I am planning it for **SUNDAY APRIL 7TH 2013. 12pm Perth GMT +8. 3pm Sydney. 5pm NZ. ** (please let me know if this time/date does/doesn't work for you.)

More than likely the game will feature on Rokkuranx server. On the day before the name will be changed  to something like **AUS V NZ r/ps3bf3**. Server will be locked with the password **reddit**. Currently it is named **rokk's** server if you wish to play. Rokks will most likely use Battlelogs Match feature to help sort teams/create certain access to players, and for those who have a bad day, stats won't be recorded.

*I edited that last part. See rokkuranx comment below.




I hope we can get enough people together to get this going. Last time was a blast. Keep an eye on this post as I will be updating it.

The recent US Presidential election has laid out the battle lines...

I would like the battle to take place in an urban environment without vehicles. It will be hand-to-hand street fighting! Conquest on Bazaar, Seine, or Sharqi come to my mind.
After reviewing the map to determine if you are Red or Blue, reply to one of the comments below for the team you will play with. Also, be sure that you are Battle Log friends with LieGuy (Red Leader) or Sauza704 (Blue Leader)

**Recruiting**

We have over 125 members currently, but are always looking for more! What do you have to do to join the platoon? 

* Head on over to [our Echo platoon page](http://battlelog.battlefield.com/bf3/platoon/2832655391669455186/) and apply, for starters. 
* Once you've applied, [send a message to the mods](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2Fps3bf3voip) and we'll get you all taken care of!

We're always looking for friendly people that like to work together towards a common objective. [Contact us!](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2Fps3bf3voip)

**Resources**

We have graciously been granted the use of multiple servers for official events and general play, in addition to the normal PS3BF3 servers we typically hang out on. 

The most popular server by far is The Number 6 Dance, which runs weekly events as follows:

* Mondays are Manic: Normal 100% conquest, rush and tdm. Your admin is shade.
* Try Hard Tuesday: Hardcore Conquest Domination, Gun master and your admin is doinwork
* Wednesday Hump Day RdtV vs RdtV with Competition rules: 
  * 200% Conquest
  * 100% Health
  * Health regeneration: off
  * 3D spotting: off
  * Friendly fire: on
  * Kill cam: off
  * (This is basically hardcore with 100% health. Your admin is rudigha.)
* Try and Stay Alive on Thursday: Squad based combat mix of squad deathmatch, conquest domination, and squad rush. Your admin is huevosgrande.
* Fuck around Friday: goof games, smoke and knives, 1861. Kopparberg and tequila fueled idiocy the likes of which won't be repeated until next week. Maybe your admin will be andersonic but if you need some adult supervision you might want to seek your pleasure elsewhere on Fridays. 
* Empty nights will generally default back to the 200% hardcore conquest rotation.

In addition to the events above, we have regular internal events and we encourage all our members to plan and coordinate. We also have a [very active subreddit](http://www.reddit.com/r/ps3bf3voip) for all of our members to discuss the game or anything else on their mind. On our subreddit, you'll find a detailed platoon roster, player map, lively discussions, guidelines, an event calendar, leaderboard and more! 

**Looking for Scrims**

Finally, we are looking for other PS3 communities to hold regular or one-time casual scrimmages for a little fun and friendly competition. We've had multiple scrims against various other groups, and are always interesting in new challenges. If you're interested, please head on over to our public board here: http://www.reddit.com/r/ps3bf3voip_public/

See you on the battlefield!

Pointers inside.",27,9,21,http://www.reddit.com/r/ps3bf3/comments/twc4j/so_just_how_did_teamspeak_beat_voip_pointers/,"Basically, many of us have played together since day one, but not so much tactically or competitively. Just by virtue of having so much time in the system probably gave us an advantage. It gets better with time. The more you play with people, the more you know their tendencies.

**What tactics did we employ?**

* We really just got ourselves situated in the Tehran Highway game. It was our first ""practice."" We specifically tailored squads to 3 instead of 4. This gave us a squad per conquest flag and 2 squads on each MCOM. It made much more sense to do this. In the event of a spawn camp, if someone has broken through, it left space for someone to join the squad, spawn on the other leader, then move back to their squad. This never happened in-game, but was part of the 3-man squad design.
* Weapon loadouts were kept similar. Everyone in the squad ran the same perk regardless of class. This avoided a need to change loadouts altogether and keep us in the game quicker. This was done in the practice round.
* Vehicle loadouts were kept different. We did this in order to maximize the perks available in vehicles. If one is running reactive armor, someone else was running proximity scan. This makes it much easier to spot enemies.
* Air superiority was not emphasized much. We didn't know how things would role out, so we discussed having multiple jets in the air and once targets were eliminated, move to having just one jet in the air. This tactic worked well and once VOIP started using jets as taxis, we shut down usage of them altogether.

That's pretty much it. We didn't have many tactics for rush other than smoke and coordinated attacks. Team deathmatch involved no tactics other than communication. Revives were a priority.

**Tactics that didn't work for VOIP**

* Mortaring was just not a good plan. Having assault players running smoke or regular 320 would do the same amount of good. 
* MAV usage was too much. I think I saw 3-4 MAVs up in the air at a time sometimes and that just takes all those guys out of the game. One is more than enough.
* C4 on the MCOMS is not a bad idea and usually good for one or two kills/defends, but you are waiting for someone to move up there to get them and you can't die. The problem was that TeamSpeak knew about just by looking. They were everywhere. Perhaps put them in more concealed locations instead of just on the wall next to the MCOM. Claymores do the same as C4, except they are self-detonating.

Outside of these things, the games were VERY entertaining. The scoreboard was misleading and nobody got spawn camped, which is awesome.

I figured I would share it with you all.

When you arrive at a capture point and begin to wind the counter down you will hear a chime equivalent to what I imagine the flag sounds like when its coming down the metal pole. You will ONLY hear this chime if no enemy players are in the area you are capturing.

For instance, if you and a squad mate move onto ""A"" to capture it, as the opposing team currently owns it. If the two of you are uncontested you will hear the audio chime I explained as the flag winds down the pole and you come closer to capturing the objective.

In contrast if the same two people head to capture ""A"" and arrive but there is a camper hidden on the flag, yet is outnumbered on the capture point you will notice the flag winding down just the same just there will be no chime, no beeping as you capture. This is a sign that although you may not see the enemy, there is at least one combatant currently contesting the area you are capturing.

The custom servers are awesome, the gameplay seems much smoother and more fluid for me (not sure if they changed something here or if it is due to the servers I have been picking). I'm starting to have fun again like I did way back when with the [rdt] og in BC2.  
   
That is all I wanted to say really. If you haven't played in a while I would suggest you give it another chance, the game has evolved.",,False,self,t5_2sbem,False,,USAWest,True,t3_rurzx,http://www.reddit.com/r/ps3bf3/comments/rurzx/what_a_difference/,
