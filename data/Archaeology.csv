1358943467.0,217,self.Archaeology,174a3l,"Getting along with the public is a BIG part of archaeology, and not all collecting is ""looting.""  Knock off the ignorant attacking of posters who put up photos of artifacts they found.",254,37,75,http://www.reddit.com/r/Archaeology/comments/174a3l/getting_along_with_the_public_is_a_big_part_of/,"There have been a number of threads in this subreddit over the past few months that went in the following way:

1) OP posts picture of artifact he/she (or a relative) found in a plowed field, streambed, or inherited from someone in the family.

2) A stream of posters flood into the thread to tell the OP that he/she is going to hell for picking up / having that artifact, or to lecture on the necessity of recording context.

Let's get this out there right now: **many of you seem to be unaware of what ""context"" really means in archaeology.**

*Primary context* refers to the position of an artifact (or artifacts) in the presumed undisturbed position in which they were deposited by the people who used them.  Artifacts in primary context provide the maximum amount of information about the people who made and used them, and so locational information is *Very* important.

*Secondary context* (which also may be disturbed but otherwise in situ) means that an artifact is no longer in primary context.  It may have been dug up and redeposited prehistorically (which is actually closer to primary context in many ways), or by a farmer digging a post hole (or plowing a field), or it may be an artifact that eroded out of a streambank and ended up on the shore.

Artifacts in secondary context vary wildly in their usefulness, from just as useful as those in primary context to almost meaningless.  ""Secondary context"" is not something you can make a blanket statement about.  In general, we can still gain info from such artifacts.  They can suggest to us that a site is present nearby, and (if they're diagnostic) they can give us a clue as to the age of that site.  But they're less useful outside of a GPS coordinate, and even that is questionable.  Most archaeologists are not interested in plotting the locations of individual artifacts.

*Tertiary context* is a term I've not seen used much, but I'm using it here to refer to artifacts *far* out of depositional context.  This would include artifacts in gravel beds or gravel / sandbars in creeks, artifacts in loads of fill dirt, or artifacts inherited from a grandparent and kept in a shoebox for 50 years.

Artifacts in tertiary context provide almost **NO** significant information to archaeologists and are nearly negligible in their value in terms of understanding the past.  We don't care if someone picked up an arrowhead from a streambed or gravel bar.  That artifact could have come from directly up the bank, or been transported for many yards or even further, depending on the strength of current or scale of floods since it came out of context.

When you guys come in here guns blazing and fired up on holier-than-thou Intro to Archaeology rhetoric, you're actually doing more damage than most of the people who post artifact pictures.

**You're poisoning the well.**

These people come in here because they're interested in archaeology.  They want to share something they found (that they think is cool) with what they assume to be a friendly and knowledgeable group.  And instead they get lectured, insulted, and generally shit on and called looters.

You don't know what these folks do in their real lives.  They may be multi-millionaires who would like to meet archaeologists because they want to get involved and even fund projects.  I personally know people like that.  My friend was a collector (might even at one time have been a straight-up looter), but he reformed and got involved in archaeology.  He has millions of dollars and has done a lot of good by funding archaeological projects, including some that I've been a part of.

And he's offered to fund more projects just because he's interested in the work and likes the people involved.

I wonder... if he'd been shunned by the archaeological community when he first got involved, would he still be donating tens of thousands of dollars to archaeological research?  Probably not.

Many of the people you hassle on here will likely not talk to an archaeologist again, because they assume that we're all like you guys and will yell at them or call them names.  Which is, of course, far from the truth.

We rely on the public for funding, for information about sites that we don't know about, and even (as you can see from the PIDBA post I made earlier) even for information about artifacts that are no longer in primary context.

When you morality brigade guys go off on artifact posters, you are harming a potentially helpful relationship between the archaeological community and members of the public.

The person who posted the picture of the point next to the quarter?  She mentioned in one of her posts that she's a lawyer.  More than that, she's a public defender.  If she ran for office one day, she's probably *exactly* the kind of person who would fight for archaeology and cultural resource protection.  Now consider that in light of your attacks of her.  *She might one day be in the position to sponsor (or vote in favor of) legislation to strengthen protection of cultural resources, or even to increase funding for cultural resource management.  And she will now remember that the time she posted a picture of an artifact she found, a bunch of assholes called her a looter and told her she was a liar.*  And she might vote against the law because of that.

Think about what you say on here.  Stop calling people looters for picking up artifacts, it's not a black / white issue and you clearly don't understand the gray area.  And if you don't understand it, you shouldn't be holding forth at length on the subject, or telling people they did a bad thing.

Knock. It. Off.

**As reddit becomes even better known, there will be more folks like my friend and the lawyer who post on here.  I *urge* you - for the sake of archaeology - to consider carefully how you behave.  Your post could have actual real-world repercussions.  This isn't purely a one-way street, the people you call names on here may change their view of archaeologists based on what you do here, and the result could be a net loss for the discipline.**",,False,self,t5_2qmyp,1358950192.0,,,True,t3_174a3l,http://www.reddit.com/r/Archaeology/comments/174a3l/getting_along_with_the_public_is_a_big_part_of/,

It sounded like an interesting title so I thought I'd check it out. I couldn't believe what I was seeing. The ""forensic geologist"" Scott Wolter is claiming that ancient Phoenicians are connected to both the Stonehenge site in England, and to a pile of rocks in New Hampshire known as ""America's Stonehenge"". And he has no real evidence to back it up. Also, the entire premise for this show is that there are things the government ""doesn't want"" us to know and is covering up. 

I just can't stand this kind of thing. Ancient Aliens was bad enough, but at least that show is obviously bogus. But America Unearthed could actually seem plausible to someone who isn't educated in the field. I don't understand why History Channel has to spew all this nonsense and confuse people. Actual history and archaeology are really *really* cool, and filled with all kinds of wild discoveries. There is *no reason* to make shit like this up, except that they are lazy and can't be bothered to do any actual research.

But thankfully, I found [this guy](http://www.jasoncolavito.com/index.html), Jason Colavito. I don't know much about him, but he at least does a decent job of debunking Wolter's mumbo jumbo. He has apparently written quite a lot on the subject of ""xenoarchaeology"" (aka ""Aliens"") and why it's a load of crap. He also apparently dug up some stuff on the Wolter character, like that his [degree is fake](http://www.jasoncolavito.com/1/post/2013/01/scott-wolters-apparently-non-existent-degree.html) and that he gets [government funding](http://www.jasoncolavito.com/1/post/2013/01/america-unearthed-takes-government-money-to-accuse-government-of-cover-ups.html) for his show.*

*Edit: I feel that, in the interest of transparency, I should mention that I didn't look into Jason Colavito's claims that Scott Wolter has a fake degree and receives government funding for myself.

1333067792.0,120,self.Archaeology,rk58w,"Mod Note on r/Archaeology, anti-intellectualism, and 
'alternative theories'",135,15,61,http://www.reddit.com/r/Archaeology/comments/rk58w/mod_note_on_rarchaeology_antiintellectualism_and/,"Let me be clear that this statement is based on my experience as a qualified Egyptian archaeologist who has worked with very prominent names in the field of Egyptology, Hittitology, Sumerology, and Archaeology. I feel my experience will be echoed by other students/teachers of the field, but if it is not, please comment.

For laymen - people who do not study actively and within a traditional post-graduate framework - it is easy to be misled by all the competative theories and suggestions available through The History Network, Amazon.com, or other media source. Many books or shows are created for profit and profit can only be seen through sales, which are driven by marketing to the masses. This includes a great deal of sensationalism. ""Ancient Aliens"" has had four successful seasons on The History Channel, all of which should be viewed if only for hilarity.

For those of us in the field, it is easy for us to poke holes and even ridicule the ideas proposed by some of these shows/books - we have read enough, seen enough, studied enough to garner a fuller understanding of the language, culture, and history of the Ancients. It is therefore saddening for me to see any number of subscribers here suggesting that the academic world is purposefully ignoring ideas put forth that may have a kernel of truth - we do not do this. We do not ignore, we rule out.

Archaeologists are not part of a vast conspiracy to deny the possibility of the truth in order to promote our own theories. We do promote our own theories, but we are swiftly shredded by our colleagues if they are suspicious, unsubstantiated, or ridiculous. We disagree on many things, and sometimes quite vocally. For example, when I studied Middle Egyptian, three tenured faculty members disagreed as to whether certain tenses even existed; there was discord even on that minute level. At conferences, we listen to each other and then hastily come up with retorts and counter-examples - it is our job to tear each other down if it helps us get to the truth of history.

I am very upset to see any anti-intellectualism in this subreddit. We are here to help, not hinder, our field. If we have ignored or dismissed a topic, it is because there is not enough context, not enough  evidence that can be applied to the breadth of knowledge we already have of that time, of that place, or of that people. While there may be areas of our field that are unexplained, we do not write them off as unexplainable, neither will we accept the first explanation someone puts forth. If we don't know exactly how the pyramids were built (a longtime bone of contention between some archaeologists), we don't blindly accept that it must have been done by a civilization unknown to us or with a technology beyond us - we argue and argue and argue with each other until a definitive proposal is made that we can all agree on. We would rather leave something up for debate than come to a false conclusion. Occam's razor is utilized whenever possible (as long as it fits into our understanding of the cultural framework we know to have been present).

I apologize for rambling on, but I want you to know the following:

* I will not delete posts unless they break reddiquette
* I will not delete comments unless they break redditquette
* I will not ban users unless they are abusive

.

* I will actively discourage anti-intellectualism and anti-academic comments
* I will actively discourage anything that fits into or is adjacent to what I list in the side panel as ""What does not belong here:""
* I will trust that if you **do** want to talk *Secret Knoweledge THEY don't want you to know!!!* or *Aliens!* or whatever, you can find a better subreddit for it.
* I ask that you respect your fellow redditors, especially given there are so many people within this subreddit who have dedicated their lives to the study of Archaeology and all its specializations.

If you have genuine questions or new proposals, by all means, post - but don't be surprised if the professionals show up and offer their opinion - it is, afterall, why reddit is great. We are a resource, a discussion, and a great way to network.

**Again, if you feel that something above is incorrect or should be discussed further, I welcome it below. I also hope this doesn't come across as totally bitchy, because I don't mean it to. I adore you all - all 5k of you (even if you are a dirty, dirty sumerologist)!**",,False,self,t5_2qmyp,True,,,True,t3_rk58w,http://www.reddit.com/r/Archaeology/comments/rk58w/mod_note_on_rarchaeology_antiintellectualism_and/,moderator

1349402601.0,84,self.Archaeology,10yzd2,Why archaeologists will get mad at you if you treasure hunt with metal detectors/dig things up as a hobby,103,19,73,http://www.reddit.com/r/Archaeology/comments/10yzd2/why_archaeologists_will_get_mad_at_you_if_you/,"I'm reposting my comment in a recent thread as a self-post here in hopes that more people will read it. Many academic/professional archaeologists here, myself included, get upset or frustrated when people post here about things they've treasure hunted up. While aggressively downvoting and waving pitchforks and repeatedly commenting about context might scare those people off, it won't help them understand *why* we are angry or what they've done wrong.  
So, I attempted to write something brief, in layman's terms, that would explain context and its importance and why just digging things up with a shovel is bad.

You're walking around with a metal detector, you detect something, and you dig straight down to it with a shovel or something and grab it out of the ground. Now you have the artifact, but you've destroyed and lost any information around it, including soil layers (which are incredibly informative!) and any other delicate non-metal evidence that might have been around there. What if the coins had been under a wooden floor that had rotted away? What if they were sitting on top of a surface that was once a dirt floor? What if they had been wrapped in delicate cloth remains? What if they were in a posthole? You have the dates on the coins, but do you have a date for the soil level they were in? Do you know how or when the coins got there? All of that information is now lost and destroyed.


""Proper"" excavations are usually done in a way that finds artifacts but also gathers as much other information as possible. If you think you have an artifact underground, you mark out a big area around where you think it is, maybe something like 5x5 feet if you're a team, or like 1x2 feet if you're digging by yourself. First you carefully slice off the sod/grass layer, and then you start very slowly digging down with a trowel by scraping off dirt centimeters at a time. This allows you to watch and note any changes in the soil, look at how artifacts are arranged relative to each other, etc. For example, if you find coins from the 1700s in a soil layer that also has some artifacts that can be easily dated to, say, the 1960s, that's very interesting! Why did someone have such old coins in the 1960s and how did they end up here? Soil is much more varied and informative than you might think - what if those coins were in a little section of dirt that was a completely different texture and color of dirt than the dirt all around it? That might imply that someone dug up a hole and then reburied the coins intentionally - also very interesting and important information! But now we will never know - all of that information is lost when people excavate like treasure hunters. 

Archaeologists keep very careful notes that include not only the locations of artifacts, but detailed maps of the area, diagrams of the excavation pit, diagrams of soil stratigraphy, and in general just obnoxiously detailed notes about literally everything they touched or saw or did every day of an excavation. This is because once you dig something up, you can never put it back in exactly the same place or put the dirt back or regain any information that you missed. Being very careful and recording all information, *whether it seems useful at the time or not*, means that in the future another archaeologist can go back and look at your notes and make new conclusions or notice things that you didn't.  No one is trying to be snooty - it just makes us very sad and frustrated to hear about information being lost and destroyed like that.

**Please feel free to correct anything I got wrong or add to this or ask questions or discuss this in any way!** I just hope this provides some people with enlightenment about why the angry mob descended on their post, and maybe encourages them to seek out a field school and participate in a ""proper"" excavation some day! :)",,False,self,t5_2qmyp,False,,,True,t3_10yzd2,http://www.reddit.com/r/Archaeology/comments/10yzd2/why_archaeologists_will_get_mad_at_you_if_you/,

The site director, Philip Mihaylov, says that the site is uniquely preserved, and so far seems illogical, thus more work needs to be done to be understood better. However, the archaeologists are pressed by deadlines. The route of the highway will pass over the round and rectangular stone structures, where remains of burnt bodies of soldiers, and ammunitions, jewellery, amulets, and other grave goods were found. This site is crucial for the understanding of the burial rituals and the beliefs of the Thracians. According to the experts, the Thracians wept when a child was born, and rejoiced when a person died, much like the Celts, as they believed in the afterlife.

Archaeologists love learning about old dead people's stuff and we love telling the public about that stuff. Often (and I mean OFFFFTEN) people bring us some of their old stuff and we are asked ""What is this? What does it do? Where did it come from?"" which is ok. We like talking to you about things you are passionate about because we are as well. However it is important for that public to know (or for young archaeologists to be able to explain to them) what we can and cannot tell them and **WHY** (Protip: Never EVER tell someone with an artifact ""NO"" and walk away. They are obviously not archaeologists, and therefore they probably do not know our Codes of Ethics, so they don't know what they can and can't ask about. Help them.  

Here's an example before we get down and dirty (pun intended). Medical doctors (because some of us here are just ""normal"" doctors) can't just tell anyone private information about their patients anytime or anywhere they want--they swore an oath to ""Do No Harm"", a part of which sets up the whole ""Doctor-Patient confidentiality agreement"". Everyone in the public knows this and it helps us trust doctors more because we understand that they will keep our information private. You can think of what archaeologists do (we're real doctors, damn it!) along similar lines: we also swore an oath (in hefty membership fees) to our various organizations to ""Do No Harm"" except it's to the archaeological record and to all people--both past and present. 

We understand that the resource that we protect are meant to inform and help all of humanity, but we also know that there are individuals who would seek to destroy that record for financial gain. The ""right"" and ""wrong"" of this is contextual, but for the sake of argument let's say that we don't want that poor farmer in rural Guatemala who found an artifact in his field to sell it to a middle-man for literally pennies, while that middle-man flips it for thousands or millions of dollars--we want that poor farmer to be able to better support their family (gogo public/local archaeology!) without having to do that. I would rather see people eat and have shelter from selling artifacts than not, but I would ultimately like to enhance their situations to where that isn't even an option. See, it's a complicated subject, but hopefully I can help make it a little clearer. 

So, to make a long post short here's my guide to some (if not most) of the Codes of Ethics for practicing archaeologists or *why we can't tell you about that freakin' cool piece, but we really want to.*

* The Society for American Archaeology's (SAA) [""*Principles of Archaeological ethics"" ](http://www.saa.org/AbouttheSociety/PrinciplesofArchaeologicalEthics/tabid/203/Default.aspx) 

&gt; Principle No. 3:

Commercialization

The Society for American Archaeology has long recognized that the buying and selling of objects out of archaeological context is contributing to the destruction of the archaeological record on the American continents and around the world. The commercialization of archaeological objects - their use as commodities to be exploited for personal enjoyment or profit - results in the destruction of archaeological sites and of contextual information that is essential to understanding the archaeological record. Archaeologists should therefore **carefully weigh the benefits to scholarship of a project against the costs of potentially enhancing the commercial value of archaeological objects. Whenever possible they should discourage, and should themselves avoid, activities that enhance the commercial value of archaeological objects, especially objects that are not curated in public institutions, or readily available for scientific study, public interpretation, and display.** 


* Archaeological Institute of America [(AIA)*""Code of Professional Standards""*](http://www.archaeological.org/news/advocacy/132)  [AIA Code of Ethics](http://www.archaeological.org/pdfs/AIA_Code_of_EthicsA5S.pdf)

&gt; 2. Refuse to participate in the trade of undocumented antiquities and refrain from activities that enhance the commercial value of such objects. Undocumented antiquities are those which are not documented as belonging to a public or private collection before December 30th, 1970, when the AIA Council endorsed the UNESCO Convention on Cultural Property, or which have not been excavated and exported from the country of origin in accordance with the laws of that country; 
3. Inform appropriate authorities of threats to, or plunder of archaeological sites, and illegal import of export of archaeological material.


* The American Anthropological Association [(AAA)'s Code of Ethics.](http://www.aaanet.org/issues/policy-advocacy/upload/AAA-Ethics-Code-2009.pdf)(pdf)

&gt; C. Responsibility to the public: 
* 1. Anthropological researchers should make the results of their research appropriately available to sponsors, students, decision makers, and other nonanthropologists. In so doing, **they must be 
truthful; they are not only responsible for the factual content of their statements but also must consider carefully the social and political implications of the information they disseminate. They must do everything in their power to insure that such information is well understood, properly contextualized, and responsibly utilized.** They should make clear the empirical bases upon which their reports stand, be candid about their qualifications and philosophical or political biases, and recognize and make clear the limits of anthropological expertise. At the same time, they must be alert to possible harm their information may cause people with whom they work or colleagues.  
* 2. In relation with his or her own government, host governments, or sponsors of research, an anthropologist should be honest and candid.  **Anthropologists must not compromise their professional responsibilities and ethics and should not agree to conditions which inappropriately change the purpose, focus or intended outcomes of their research.** 
* 3. Anthropologists may choose to move beyond disseminating research results to a position of advocacy. This is an individual decision, but not an ethical responsibility


* Register of Professional Archaeologists [(RPA) *""Code of Conduct""*](http://www.rpanet.org/displaycommon.cfm?an=1&amp;subarticlenbr=3) 

&gt; The Archaeologist's Responsibility to the Public
1.1 An archaeologist shall:

* Recognize a commitment to represent Archaeology and its research results to the public in a responsible manner;
* Actively support conservation of the archaeological resource base;
* Be sensitive to, and respect the legitimate concerns of, groups whose culture histories are the subjects of archaeological investigations;
* **Avoid and discourage exaggerated, misleading, or unwarranted statements about archaeological matters that might induce others to engage in unethical or illegal activity;
* Support and comply with the terms of the UNESCO Convention on the means of prohibiting and preventing the illicit import, export, and transfer of ownership of cultural property, as adopted by the General Conference, 14 November 1970, Paris.
1.2 An archaeologist shall not:

* Engage in any illegal or unethical conduct involving archaeological matters or knowingly permit the use of his/her name in support of any illegal or unethical activity involving archaeological matters;
* Give a professional opinion, make a public report, or give legal testimony involving archaeological matters without being as thoroughly informed as might reasonably be expected;
* Engage in conduct involving dishonesty, fraud, deceit or misrepresentation about archaeological matters;
* Undertake any research that affects the archaeological resource base for which she/he is not qualified.
* Knowingly be involved in the recovery or excavation of artifacts for commercial exploitation, or knowingly be employed by or knowingly contract with an individual or entity who recovers or excavates archaeological artifacts for commercial exploitation.**


Hey, awesome person, thanks for sticking around to read the bottom!


So here's the deal: we like to talk to you about your artifact and we thank you for bringing it to our attention, but if you try to take what we tell you about **your** thing and use it to make money, then you've made us have to do something bad, which is pretty mean. People don't buy artifacts--they buy the history and the story. Archaeologists have provlidged knowledge about a great many artifacts, but we want to use our powers for good, not evil. We also get really REALLY mad when other archaeologists do this (we totally blacklist them--try getting a job after that). Ultimately it's up to the individual archaeologist say and do whatever they want, but appropriate consequences come with those actions. I can honestly say that I've had to turn down many potential jobs and projects because these considerations were not made or there may have been some ""morally gray areas"" to navigate, and I remain to this day a ""squeeky clean"" archaeologist. Everything is built on our reputations--to our peers, colleagues, and most importantly to you, the public. 

We are the stewards of our collective past and have trained very hard for a very long time (and at a significant cost to our livers and loved ones) to be the best at doing it so that everyone can enjoy our history.

I have always been deeply interested in the Minoan culture and would love to make them the focus of my career. 

It seems, however, that whenever I tell anyone of my plans I am only met with claims of how there are no jobs in archaeology and how digs are tedious and terrible. I specifically chose archaeology because ever since I was little I have had a passion for history and I've know from an early age that I need a hands-on career where I can spend time outdoors.

So my main questions are:

1. What does the lack of jobs stem from? A lack of a higher degree then Bachelor's? An unwillingness to travel or do physical labor? Or is it just that there aren't many positions?

2. What are my chances of graduating from college and being able to get a job where I can fly out to Crete and work on a dig site?

3. Are digs really all that bad? Or do people just enjoy complaining?

4. How helpful to my career will it be to volunteer for a local archaeology department in my spare time?",,False,self,t5_2qmyp,False,,,True,t3_1ajm7w,http://www.reddit.com/r/Archaeology/comments/1ajm7w/what_are_my_prospects_as_a_future_archaeologist/,

I attended my first flintknapping demonstration today (and actually managed to make a projectile point and not cut myself!), and I went looking on Reddit for other people into it, and didn't find any subreddits devoted to flintknapping.

I'm a senior in college, studying prehistoric African lithic technology, and am by no means an expert, but I really love rocks! Anyone else?

EDIT-Seems to be a resounding yes, I'll start it up tomorrow and put an intro to flintknapping post up. Thanks guys!

EDIT2-Finally got it started with a preliminary post about supplies up. Will post about techniques and safety tomorrow. Thanks for the interest! And if anyone knows a bit about this stuff and would like to co-moderate, just hit me up and I'll make you a mod! And I present: /r/knapping!

Thus I propose that we use this post to talk about the field schools we've attended/run.  Let's give the students of this subreddit a taste of what they can expect and hopefully show them the wide variety of places they can go.  Besides, I've never met an archaeologist who doesn't love to yammer on about their field school experience.

Things that should probably be covered:

Where is the school?

Who runs the school?

What is being worked on?

What skills did you learn?

Average cost of the school

Would you recommend it?

Any personal anecdotes that you want to share.

I didn't expect such a lovely, helpful and warm response from all of you.


While I seriously considered the whip and hat idea, I ended up going a little bit more practical.

I got him a membership to the Australian Archaeological society as suggested by deaconblues99 .

A write in the rain notebook as suggested by CravingSunshine
And found by my sister!

Then, while stumbling through all the links and suggestions I found a really lovely set of tiny picks and cleaning tools for lab and field work that he's super excited to learn about.

I had left it too late to get an engraved trowel, but would love to in the future.
I also got him some t-shirts, DVDs, chocolates, sun glasses and some bits and pieces.



He was so excited and I just wish I'd taken photos... maybe I'll get one of him in the t-shirt i got him that reads ""I dig archaeology"". 
Because everybody likes a pun, right?........... Right?


Thank you all once again. You've given me such wonderful advice and I can't believe how you all just jumped right in, willing to help a complete stranger. 

Archaeologists are simply wonderful.... I should know.
