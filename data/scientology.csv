I will answer any questions.",79,8,69,http://www.reddit.com/r/scientology/comments/zbwuj/iama_person_who_was_an_active_participant_of/,"I grew up Catholic and decided I was an atheist shortly before leaving for college. That didn't work for me too well so I kind of adopted a more spiritual approach, especially after taking a class on Buddhism.

Two years later, as a drop-out, I found my way into Scientology. My life was a complete wreck. Due to my lack of upbringing, I lacked a lot of basic adult skills. After one Scientology class, I was amazed at how well presented such novel, and yet useful, concepts of life were being displayed... ready to be picked up and used.

I quickly went aboard as a staff member and was fully immersed for about 1 1/2 years. Eventually, problems with my college debts forced me back into civilian life. The tools I learned did help me bootstrap myself and start a new life.

Within a few years, I was able to pay off about $10k of debt from the services I received as staff and continue with my Scientology services as a lay person.

Over the next decade or so, I did as much Scientology as I could and hold down a full-time job. I also streched all my accounts and assets to the limit to 1) make donations that served the church's causes and 2) pay for my own services, both in taking courses and receiving Scientology therapy.

Eventually, I found myself getting tired of going into the church and feeling like I had a $ on my forehead with an arrow to my wallet. I spent about a year and a half slowly backing off before formally ending things in a private manner.

My life has been 'interesting' since... not in the way you might suspect. I have had to come to terms with my own lack of spiritual identity, do a lot of soul searching, shrug off a lot of lies and relook at the world; amidst my own emotional battles.

Anyways, ask me anything and I will be at least as truthful with you as I am with myself.",,False,,t5_2qh3a,False,,,True,t3_zbwuj,http://www.reddit.com/r/scientology/comments/zbwuj/iama_person_who_was_an_active_participant_of/,

Here's why.",77,18,82,http://www.reddit.com/r/scientology/comments/bgr31/two_days_ago_scientologist2_really_wanted_to_talk/,"In the midst of a debate over whether or not the CoS spends any of its billions on humanitarian efforts, or even helping out sick, indigent, or elderly Scientologists, Scientologist two laid out several spurious examples (A variety of government-paid programs and a staff cafeteria).  He seemed especially enamored of a Narconon/Criminon hybrid called ""Second Chance.""  He really wanted my opinion of a promo video on Youtube.

He liked it so much he tried to steer the conversation back to the program three of four times that day.  So I decided to be fair and look into it.

Turns out Second Chance Albuquerque (where the video was made) was fully funded by the New Mexico government, after its owners (Joy Westrum and Rick pendery ) bragged of a 90% success rate getting prisoners of drugs and kept out of jail.

In a very short period of time, SCA began to wear out its welcome.  They'd opened in a former prison facility, and were under strict orders to accept only non-violent male offenders.  They were shortly in trouble for making modifications to the building, and the city suspected they were accepting violent offenders (they were).  The city grew concerned and examined their ""statistics,"" which turned out to be the same bogus statistics Narconon has been spreading for thirty years.  

So the city decided to evict them.  it turned out they were not just accepting violent offenders, they were accepting female prisoners and housing them together.  They let eight inmates escape.

At the time of eviction, they left owing more than half a million in unpaid taxes, rent, and utilities.  They left in the middle of the night, and stole appliances and fixtures from the property.

Local news teams followed up on the program, and discovered that the majority of Second Chance graduates returned to prison, and this number included eight staff members.  The recidivism rate was higher than it would have been if the prisoners had been released with no program.

Westrum and Pendery fled to Hawaii and tried to open a similar facility there.  Hawaii said ""No thank you.""  Joy Westrum now sells jewelry in Florida.


Strangely, after encouraging me so strongly to look into this, Scienbtologist2 won't discuss it.  In fact, ever since i showed him the fruits of my research, he's steadfastly ignored the subject of Second Chance.

(I cannot say exactly where, I want to avoid Fair Game after all.) I want a legal way to oppose them. I've considered writing members of the local government and detailing Fair Game, Snow White, Freakout, et al. and this seems to be my only real option.

 I've also heard that Scilons shut down personality tests if you flash a Guy Fawkes Mask (USEFUL!) and thankfully, masked protest is legal here. I feel as if I'm up against a corner here. I love my hometown, I don't want it to suffer under Scientology. I need all the help I can get in this matter. I don't care what people believe, but Scientology is, as an organisation, pure unadulterated evil. HELP, REDDIT!


EDIT: Thank you, everyone, for your advice. This is all very helpful. Keep it coming, friends! If I am successful in this, I hope to organise. Perhaps I can make a page, telling people how to keep the cult from integrating into their hometowns. It is my hope that eventually, through efforts similar to mine, we can stop the spread of this cult. It's a lofty goal, but hey, it can't hurt to try right? Unless I get SP'd.

Lately she has been talking about how she ""kind of admires scientology in certain ways"" and trying to give people half baked dianetics tests. At first we thought it was just some random new fascination or something but then we started to piece some things together. 

She has to pay the company she works for 1000 to advance to different ""tiers"" in her workplace that they take out of her pay check gradually. Also she has been attending some kind of seminars where she learns to see color better or something like that to help with the teeth painting ostensibly. By the way, she has to pay to go to those seminars. She also went off her lithium prescription recently and also convinced her boyfriend to stop taking some if not all of his medication for various things. She brings around little books that she got from her employer that are written by L. Ron Hubbard. Also, the person who got her the job is a ""tier 5"" and reportedly ""cant talk"" to my friend about  some of the information she has been privy to on different tiers and goes off during the seminars to do things that my friend isn't privy to.

At this point I'm pretty positive she is being lured into scientology and she seems receptive. This is someone who I NEVER expected could be taken in by a cult in a million years and she is also one of the best friends I have ever had and I'm worried about where this is going.

How am I supposed to approach her about this and is there any kind of resource out there that I should be learning about? I just dont know what to do.",,False,,t5_2qh3a,False,,,True,t3_1d2aap,http://www.reddit.com/r/scientology/comments/1d2aap/i_know_this_has_probably_been_beat_to_death_in/,

I think that there should be a MMO that is based on scientology.  You have teirs (the levels in the Scientology), that costs more and more (to the point that you basically go broke for every level).  

Missions
The missions will be, infiltraiting the IRS and other agencies, converting people, scamming people, and finally beating the shit out of people that try and leave.  

Crafting and Market
The market setup will be done by minig people with an E-Meter to create crystals that can forge different mystical weapons.  These weapons will be guns or crow bars (things you have to use to beat people up), but mostly just useless shit that looks kewl and sounds awesome.  

Spoiler
The final boss will be killing Matt Stone and Trey Parker while fending off hordes of Fans - the suprise boss will be Anon.

So, what would be the most efficient way to stop this nonsense?

I challenged him on some things I'd read about scientology on-line and he calmly and politely replied to each accusation with sane and salient responses that left me feeling as if I'd been cheated into thinking scientology isn't always treated fairly.

Then I heard that Chaka Khan's son shot someone in the face who he accused of having an affair with his girlfriend, in front of a room full of people at a party and got away with it, because he, ""Didn't mean to do it"".

Hello everybody,

So here's the deal: I'm an ex-Scientologist (sort of). I never got too far into the religion before calling BS, but I did delve. However, I grew up around the religion. So, I'm pretty familiar with the tech and how the religion works.

Anyway, my best friend is deeply involved. He's been in the SO for a few years now, and has been a Scientologist since I met him. He's a good guy. We've been through the best and the worst together.

I've kind of lost contact with him (more or less) since he joined the SO a few years ago. When he left, I wasn't as atheistic as I currently am. I thought I was just going through a phase of disbelief. I now know how sure I am in my beliefs.

So, recently, this friend of mine got back in touch with me via email, text, and phone. We've been catching up, reminiscing about all the stupid stuff we'd done as teenagers.

Well, recently, he's invited me (kind of) to debate religion. I thought I'd post this sooner than later, and update it (if anybody cares), because we've only touched one point. It's not as much of a debate as it is an attempt at recovering me. But, I will debate every point until he stops pushing his religion on me. 

I've decided that I'm not doing him any good by pretending to agree with him, which I used to do to keep the peace. In fact, I think I'm actually hurting him. I may be protecting his ego, but when he finally leaves the church, he may be fucked--both financially and mentally. Even after my *brief* delving, I feel like my psyche has been kind of 'fucked with', so to speak.

**THE JUICY STUFF:**

So, like I said, we've only hit one major point thus far; I'll summarize and keep this stuff as brief as I can: (*His voice will be Italic*)

&gt; *Why are your no longer a Scientologist?*

I don't agree with some of the fundamentals of Scientology. For example, Scientology claims that we're spiritual beings *inhabiting* bodies. I see no proof for this. In fact, if I had to choose, I'd say we see proof for the opposite--that we *are* our bodies.

&gt; *So you need PROOF that we're spiritual beings?*

Yes. To actually validate a claim, I need proof. Otherwise, how am I supposed to distinguish fiction from reality? There are infinitely many beliefs, with which I would have to agree, if I didn't use this sort of logic.

&gt; *LRH has written a lot about Theta Beings. You should read what he has to say. For example, in Chapter 7 of ""A History of Man"", titled, 'The History of the Theta Line...--*

--... Sorry, but that's exactly what I can't get past. Even the title 'The History of the Theta Line' speaks a ton about what I'm about to read. I don't believe we are spiritual beings. It just isn't logical. It might sound pleasant, but that doesn't mean it's true.

&gt; *Well, don't get hung up on that one point. Think like a scientist--like a bridge builder, for example. He needs to build a bridge, so he has to consider all the pros and cons of various bridge designs. He has to consider the idea as a whole. He can't get hung up on one point of his job.*

Well, using your analogy, I still can't get past my disbelief in spiritual beings. If a bridge builder tried to build a bridge in some distant part of outer space, he'd have a very difficult time, because he's lacking any sort of foundation.

&gt; *Alright, well, I think I see what you're saying. You need actual PROOF. I'll have to look that up and get back to you.*

... ... ...

I'm pretty proud of how this part of the conversation ended. Without my telling him to, he's going to go searching for evidence. I won't be surprised when he returns with none.

If anybody gives a shit, let me know. I'll update as the conversation progresses.",,False,,t5_2qh3a,False,,,True,t3_k0pqj,http://www.reddit.com/r/scientology/comments/k0pqj/scientologist_best_friend_a_debate/,

With that in mind, I thought I would write a little about one of the Scientology ""basics"" books - Self Analysis.

As you may know, one of the primary concepts introduced in the book Dianetics is that the best way to work through emotional (and sometimes other) problems is to find the earliest related memories you can and to keep going over that memory repeatedly until you can fully recall all of the senses associated with that memory and can essentially relive it and then to keep going over it until the emotional charge associated with the memory is gone. This is kind of a simplified interpretation of what Dianetics says but is suitable for this post.

Self Analysis opens with an overview of the theory behind the exercises that come later in the book, an explanation of the Tone Scale (which I won't go into here) and a lot of self-promotion and explanation about why nothing this awesome has ever been on the planet and other blahblah type stuff. You can pretty much skim most of this stuff up until page 107 where the exercises start.

The exercises are essentially lists of events that happen in most people's life and you trying to recall a specific sense associated with a memory of that event as clearly as possible.

 There is a list of senses on the side of each page: Sight, Smell, Touch, Color, Tone, External Motion, Emotion, Loudness, Body Position, Sound, Weight, Personal Motion.

 The idea is you you go down the list of events and apply one of the senses to that event. For instance, the first list starts with:

Can you recall a time when:
1. You were happy
2. You had just finished constructing something
3. Life was cheerful
4. Somebody had given you something
5. You ate something good
... (there are 75 items in this list, but there are a lot of these lists grouped by categories)

So lets pick number 1 and Sight. Try to remember what you saw one time that you were happy. Try to remember what you saw as clearly as possible. Go over the memory several times trying to remember what you saw even clearer, maybe there is something that you remember seeing after a few times that you didn't remember at first. 

Eventually you will get to a point where your memory of what you saw that one time you were happy doesn't get any clearer by going over it again and then you can either move on to the next item in the list, or even better stay on the same one and try to recall an earlier time you were happy and repeat the process, then try to remember an earlier time you were happy and so on as far back as you can go.

 Don't worry about the other sense while doing it, just focus on sight, or whichever sense you picked for that item. Some of the senses might be easy - recalling what it was like to feel happy at a time you felt happy might be easy, but recalling how heavy or light your body felt, or in what position your body was in might be harder and will take some time and several times going over the memory.

There are about 230 pages of lists like the above and eventually you will get to a memory which has a lot of emotion associated with it. For instance say you get to ""Recall a time when you heard a cat mewing"" and you are working on the Emotion sense and the earliest time you remember a cat mewing was right after your father died or something. 

The theory is that trying to recall that event as absolutely clearly as possible and then going over it again and again several times in detail you will get the emotional charge off of the event.

If that's the case, then the theory is that you probably also avoid cats currently because there is a part of your subconscious which always thinks ""when cats meow people die"" even if you know consciously that is silly. Going over the event until the emotional charge is gone is supposed to not only help you feel better about your fathers death, but also help your subconscious disassociate cats with death.

For me, reading this book and going through the lists it became very clear why actors would be drawn to this - a lot of it is very similar to the exercises many actors do in order to have control of their emotions on stage by recalling events from their own lives.

That's basically the whole book, nothing about aliens in this one. I personally question some of the theory but it makes sense to some degree (though I think its often taken as gospel rather than theory). If nothing else, its quite interesting to go through the lists and try to recall different senses from events in your childhood. 

 The above are my interpretations of this book and I certainly welcome comments from others who have a different interpretation - I don't claim to be an expert on this topic.",,False,,t5_2qh3a,False,,,True,t3_1hzi33,http://www.reddit.com/r/scientology/comments/1hzi33/self_analysis/,

I remember seeing a huge pirate ship on the left, and a full on i shit you not castle on the right hand side. But what interested me the most was the unmistakable scientology sigil/sign on a stained glass window in one of the buildings behind a huuuge fence.  We slowed down to look but because it was dark and we were already a bit buzzed before we hit the casino, we didn't dare stop.. The place was just too freaky for words.

Does anyone have info on what this place is, what they do? Is it some kind of indoctrination center or maybe even a type of Scientology HQ?

",17,4,13,http://www.reddit.com/r/scientology/comments/aga3u/can_any_scientologist_rationalize_the_policy_of/,"So bebnet has been urging me to read more Scientology and less ""about"" Scientology. We also discussed the idea of justice within Scientology. With that in mind, I came across this interesting HCOPL titled ""Ethics Protection,"" issued 1 Sep 1965.

The most telling section is this:

""We are not in the business of being good boys and girls. We're in the business of going free and getting the org production roaring. Nothing else is of any interest then to Ethics but (a) getting tech in, getting it run and getting it run right and (b) getting production up and the org roaring along. Therefore if a staff member is getting production up by having his own statistic excellent. Ethics sure isn't interested. But if a staff member isn't producing, shown by his bad statistic for his post, Ethics is fascinated with his smallest misdemeanor.

In short a staff member can get away with murder so long as his statistic is up and can't sneeze without a chop if it's down.""

That last bit is actually part of the policy. I'm not paraphrasing. Hubbard doesn't mince words. He's actually saying that a Scientologist in good standing is literally exempt from the normal codes of conduct for Scientologists, and even the law. Not only that, but if you dare even report the crimes of a Scientologist with good stats, you become the target of investigation yourself:

""When people do start reporting a staff member with a high statistic, what you investigate is the person who turned in the report.""

This is insanity. This is a perversion of justice and ethics of a magnitude I can't even begin to articulate, but I suppose the policy speaks for itself. There's just no ambiguity here. The more context you give it, the worse it gets. 

http://www.carolineletkeman.org/sp/images/stories/hcopl/hcopl-ethics-protection.pdf

Can someone provide a link to a more official release of this policy? I believe it was reissued 5 Oct 1985.

They misused my debit card information and instead, charged me for an annual membership. Since then I've been reading on forums about the Co$ and what they do, and today I decided to start a facebook group to hopefully spread information about the church. Most of my friends ignored the group because they don't see the potential threat that the Co$ is, and they don't understand why they are bad, So I decided to invite my fellow redditors about my group. If you feel that the Co$ is wrong in the way they treat their members, or if you're just against a cult that tries to be a religion for the tax cut, PLEASE JOIN AND INVITE YOUR FRIENDS.

This will be an update of that thread, involving a copy-pasta of our latest email conversation. Once again, his voice will be *italic*.

Critiques, insults, and advice are all welcome! ;)

&gt; *Ok cool man. How are you doing?*

I'm well. I'm making music and started school yesterday. I'm taking a marketing class and an intro to cinema class. It's a full load. Plus, I'm looking for a job.

How's it going with you? Anything new?

&gt; *Thats really cool man, marketing is a very cool subject but can become so very easily confused. All it is basically is making something known and wanted.*

&gt; *I am doing very well. I started a course yesterday called Professinal Registration, basically a course on how to reg. I am finishing my Grade 0, which is the level on the Bridge which addresses communication. Its really crazy how much communication I was not allowing or feeling wored about. Like certain words when people say them used to embarrass me or give me a nervous feeling, and sometimes I couldnt recieve any sort of communication for a certain type of person. Its handled now, pretty awesome actually. I also just always say whatever is on m mind and not what I think the other person wants to hear or if I think its cool or not. Just simply more able to give, recieve and have communication.*

&gt; *I should be going back out soon. Maybe a few days and if I come back to LA we have to have lunch or something.*

Awesome. Glad you're doing well. Call me when you come out here. We should definitely get lunch. I got my car situation handled.

All the books just arrived... I could open my own org; there are so many.

Which one did you want me to read?

&gt; *Hey, you should read Dianetics: The Modern Science of Mental Health. This is a very scientific book regarding the mind and is very thorough.*

I've actually read quite a bit of Dianetics.

I'm pretty busy right now. Is there a chapter you have in mind?

&gt; *No, but that is where you left off. The only reason a person blows from a course is misunderstood words. Go back to where you were last doing really well in the book and look just before that, you will find it.*

I think there may be other reasons a person stops doing a course. For example, I came to terms with the fact that I didn't agree with the material. It wasn't misunderstood words. I understand the idea of Theta Beings and I don't agree. I've only ever found anecdotal evidence in favor of the idea that we're spiritual beings. You know what I mean?

&gt; *Werd. Would you agree that man has aberrations and this thing called a reactive mind?*

Aberrations are insane thoughts--deviations from critical, rational, or sane thinking, right? Like when a child gets punished for cussing, he might scream and draw on his walls in response.

From what I remember, the reactive mind is supposedly the culprit in the aforementioned example. It's what causes deviations from sanity. Its awareness of the environment is animalistic and primitive.

&gt; *Pop open the Dianetics book and in the back is a glossary.*

Ok, I did that. 

I think it's a possibility that man has aberrations. Though, that depends on what one considers sane. From what I understand, through observation and studying history and anthropology, man is very selfish and insane. Those attributes degrade when we're forced to live in proximity to one another (we make laws), or when we form a community (we elect leaders).

As far as the reactive mind, I'm not so sure what I believe. The Dianetics book defines it as 'the cellular mind', in other words, the cells and neurons that make a brain. This, from what I understand of anatomy, is the only 'mind' we have. Thoughts can be mapped and traced (though the technology involved is still somewhat primitive) on a brain by setting up electrodes in specific areas. There's an entire science revolving around understanding the intricacies of the human brain. Neurology is a branch of that science.

So, to answer your question, I think it's a possibility that man has aberrations, but I think that the reactive mind, and the analytical mind, are one in the same, unless you have evidence that shows otherwise.

On another note, I read past the title of chapter 7 in 'A History of Man'. It said that the time track for the Thetan started about 70 trillion years ago. What's the basis for that claim? What test was performed to measure the length of the Theta Track?

&gt; *I am not going to tell you what to believe, neither is LRH. If it is not true for you than it is not true. This is a truism of Scientology and LRH says this many times in many texts. If you really want to find out you will have to go in session and have gains and cognitions for yourself.*

&gt; *The reason I know that I am not just a body and dont live one life and then get buried is because I have had whole track recalls and seen how engrams on the track have affected my every day life. I started having these cognitions on my Tr's and Objectives, which is actually what your next step on the Bridge is.*

I can't disagree with your personal experiences. If it's working for you, and you're happy, then I'm happy for you. I have a huge respect for your lifestyle. It takes a lot of balls to do live so monastically and minimally. It takes even more to trade personal possessions for a greater purpose.

For me, without some sort of tangible, objective, and testable foundation, I can't force myself to believe anything. There are an infinite number of possible explanations for what's going on in our universe; for what's happening in our bodies and minds; and for what happens when we die. There are answers, I'm sure. But, for now, I believe those answers aren't yet completely known. This used to trouble me, and still does occasionally. I've lost quite a bit of sleep over this eternal debate--weighing the possibilities, contemplating death, life, and free will.

I've come to think that the only valuable commodities in life are personal experiences and happiness through those experiences. No amount of money, property, or personal possession can make a man happy. It's simultaneously selfish and selfless to desire perpetuating happiness.

You dig, homie?

&gt; *Thats what I believe also. The experiencing of pleasure moments, the ultimate in pro-survival along all dynamics for the longest possible time. I think you should experience getting actual metered audting and see what its all about. You never have and never will unless you sit in that chair and pick up the cans.  You should do whats called life repair. It is a very novice actino and can be done on anyone. The action addresses all those things that are ruining you personally and helps handle them with auditing and learning. You could even do it at Flag and ask to use some of the money your dad has on account.*

I've had auditing with the cans. I can't remember enjoying it too much. By the way, have you ever seen/heard an actual, modern psychiatric auditing session?

I'm vey sure my dad won't be spending money on his account. But, I'm not interested in pursuing Scientology anymore. Like I said, it's just not for me, dude!

Anyway, I'm glad we've both arrived at the same conclusion. That's pretty neat.",,False,,t5_2qh3a,True,,,True,t3_k64oi,http://www.reddit.com/r/scientology/comments/k64oi/scientology_a_debate_update/,

**Scientology**
An example of avoiding information critical of the church:
In May, 1991 when a TIME magazine article about Scientology came out, meetings were called in Scientology organizations throughout the country, where members were told not to read the TIME article because it’s ""entheta"" (enturbulated theta - ""enturbulated"" meaning chaotic, confused and ""theta"" being the Scientology term for spirit). They were then given copies of Scientology’s 80-page ""rebuttal"" and it is incredible to think how the rebuttal would make any sense to someone who hadn’t even read the article in the first place!
 
Anyone who writes articles, books or speaks out against Scientology is, in the eyes of Scientologists, a depraved, psychotic and ""fair game"" for attacks. If a Scientologist’s concerned relative showed their loved one a critical article and the person went back to Scientology and asked about it, they would be given the standard line that the article was written by a criminal and that it was all lies.
 
To see the utterly ridiculous lengths Scientology will go to discredit criticism, visit the Church of Scientology website that seems to be dedicated to smearing their detractors:
http://www.freedommag.org/
 
**Jehovah's Witness:**
""Now, what will you do if you are confronted with apostate teaching - subtle reasonings - claiming that what you believe as one of Jehovah's Witnesses is not the truth? For example, what will you do if you receive a letter or some literature, open it, and see right away that it is from an apostate? Will curiosity cause you to read it, just to see what he has to say? You may even reason: 'It won't affect me; I'm too strong in the truth. And, besides, if we have the truth, we have nothing to fear. The truth will stand the test.' In thinking this way, some have fed their minds upon apostate reasoning and have fallen prey to serious questioning and doubt. 
...
As we go forward, building faith and keeping busy in Kingdom service, we can confidently put our trust in Jehovah, knowing that, as our loving heavenly Father, he wants the very best for us. God teaches us; he warns us. He does this through his Word and by means of clear direction provided by his visible organization.
...
Like gangrene, apostate reasoning is nothing but quick-spreading spiritual death. And since the members of the congregation are like one body, there is a danger that others may be infected. If the one spreading apostate teachings cannot be restored to spiritual health by loving but firm application of the balm of God's Word, amputation of this member (disfellowshipping) may be the only alternative for the protection of other members of the body. (Compare Titus 1:10, 11.) Do not be infected by deadly gangrene of a spiritual kind! Keep in good spiritual health by avoiding the contamination of apostate thinking.""
*-Watchtower 1986 March 15 pp.10-15 'Do Not Be Quickly Shaken From Your Reason'*

My faith did not come to me through science, and I will not permit so-called science to destroy it’.” 
*-President Thomas S Monson, (Ensign, Feb 2001)*
 
“There is a temptation for the writer or the teacher of Church history to want to tell everything, whether it is worthy or faith promoting or not.”
“Some things that are true are not very useful.”
“That historian or scholar who delights in pointing out the weaknesses and frailties of present or past leaders destroys faith. A destroyer of faith — particularly one within the Church, and more particularly one who is employed specifically to build faith — places himself in great spiritual jeopardy. He is serving the wrong master, and unless he repents, he will not be among the faithful in the eternities. ... Do not spread disease germs!""

**""Are questions and doubts permitted within the organization? A healthy spiritual environment must engage individual followers at their level of experience and should encourage them to feel and think and therefore question their beliefs and exercise good decision-making. In this way, the follower can investigate, discriminate, and test the dogma and the environment they are being asked to accept, between what his or her personal issues are and what might be an unhealthy environment. If intense pressure is used to dissuade people who wish to talk with former members or critics, it is a clear sign of information control. Controlling information is one of the most essential components of mind control.""**

A very interesting question -- a true mystery is posed: Was Scientology harassing this couple to the point that they decided death was better, or were they mentally ill and delusional? Some have even suggested that Scientologists killed them. But that seems outlandish and unlikely.

If I were a stalker for a cult whose aim was to discredit and ruin someone in revenge for their non-compliance or departure from the cult, this is probably what I would choose to do after the person, whom I had convinced to move in next door to me (finding them good lodging in a challenging real estate market, right next door, would be one favor I would do them to woo them into the cult): I would file a complaint with the police that they had been harassing me, then leak the complaint so it became public, and in the complaint I would allege something so sick and clearly mentally ill for my target to have harassed me with so as to discredit them in case they later publicly revealed my cult's unsavory activities. This is what this actual complaint said:

“On the evening of May 9, 2006,” said O’Brien’s statement, “Theresa approached my bungalow and rapped on the window. Upon opening the door I was immediately greeted with the following questions&gt;… Theresa said to me, ‘Jeremy and I have started a club where we’ve found a bunch of old men and we’re letting them fuck us in the ass, and we wanted to know if you wanted to be a part of it.’ I asked Theresa if she was joking. She said ‘no’ and repeated herself. I asked if she was trying to imply something about the age difference between my boyfriend and me.” (Schlei is 41.) “She said ‘no,’ smiled, and walked away.""

It seems like it was written in a PR shop, as part of a crisis management strategy. Your thoughts? Real or fictional complaint? Was poor Theresa a victim, or crazy, or both?",,False,,t5_2qh3a,False,,,True,t3_1gb4a5,http://www.reddit.com/r/scientology/comments/1gb4a5/did_scientologists_stalk_this_woman_or_was_she/,

Hello,

I was out a good bit of the time this past week, and unfortunately the production statistics reflect that fact.  
Number of Active Students and number of Lessons Graded were both down, and these are the
two main sub-statistics that lead to our overall statistic (extension course completions).

However, my body is now doing better, and I am looking forward to a better week.

**Success Story:**  Here is a recent Success Story from the Scientology 8-80 Extension Course.
           **""I did solo auditing in the past that involved dichotomies**^1 **but never truly understood them.  One chapter on this course
           blew that huge misunderstood away.**

**To say that my knowledge of life took a quantum leap with this course would be an understatement**.  **The knowledge I have
gained about what life is doing and about the source of life energy itself is priceless**.  **I have finally located myself as a source of life energy**.

**On the History of Man extension course I felt myself** '**get on board.**'   **Now I can see myself beginning to ""run the train!""**

^1 **dichotomy** - ""opposites or near opposites.  Two things which, when interplayed, cause action:  God and the Devil, that is a dichotomy - good and evil.
If God is just sitting there, good all the time, there is no action.  But if good and evil are interplaying, there is lots of action.  Opposites don't have to be absolute, like God and Devil.  They can be much closer together and still form a dichotomy so that there can be an interplay.""  (from Scientology 8-80, page 67)
           
**Birthday Game**:  DC Day Org finished lower than usual for the week just ended, but we are still in 4th place in the cumulative standings for the year, which goes from Ron's Birthday 2010 to Ron's Birthday 2011 (that's March 13 to March 13).  Actually we gained on the third-place Org and are now only 2 or 3 points behind them.

**Finding the positives**:  With all of the destructive individuals, groups and activities currently in bloom across our planet, it is sometimes difficult to stay focused on those things that give us hope.  
         

 **As Scientologists we take our hope and gain purpose for what we do to change things, from L. Ron Hubbard's discoveries on  the mind and spirit**.  **For example, if you look on page 23 of  Dianetics The Modern Science of Modern Health, you find that Man is basically good and it is only his aberrations that cause him to do evil**.  **And elsewhere in that book, we learn where those aberrations come from and how to get rid of them**.

**These truths become obvious to those of us who have experienced the results of Dianetics auditing (counseling)**, **and especially to those who have reached the state of CLEAR**.

 **So, evil is NOT necessary**.  **Isn't that interesting**?  **Now does it become more clear why Scientolgists are so dedicated to ensuring that EVERYONE becomes clear**.",,False,,t5_2qh3a,1341586134.0,,,True,t3_w4p4c,http://www.reddit.com/r/scientology/comments/w4p4c/org_newsletter_610/,

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Hello and well done for surviving the heat wave.  It's a bit cooler here than it was on Tuesday and Wednesday.

NEW STARTS:  [redacted]
ACTIVE STUDENTS:  [redacted]            [redacted]         [redacted][redacted]            [redacted]          [redacted]
**Where are the female students**?  **None active this week.**

COMPLETIONS:  [redacted] - Science of Survival            **[redacted]** - **The Problems of Work**   -  That's right.  [redacted] started and completed the course in less than one week.

THE BIRTHDAY GAME.  **DC day finished in second place internationally for the week just ended**, **but the Org that was first for the week** (**from Brussels**) **earned enough points to jump past us in the yearly standings**, **moving to third place and bumping us to fourth**. **Still not bad**, **but we want first place**, **so keep those lessons coming in please**.

THE THREE BIG EVENTS:  

These are powerful events that no Scientologist will want to miss.  Even if you don't consider yourself a Scientologist, it is almost certain that you will feel a renewed sense of hope for the future, once you see all **the advances that are being made by our group to improve conditions for the individual**, **the family**, **the nation and other groups**, **all of mankind**, **plants and animals and the very planet we live on**.  

**The second event (on July 24) will give many a much deeper sense of hope**, **when they see the new releases that will multiply by many fold our potential to improve conditions for everyone and everything on the planet**.

Have a great week.  Celebrate by completing a lesson or two or your entire course.",,False,,t5_2qh3a,False,,,True,t3_wgmz1,http://www.reddit.com/r/scientology/comments/wgmz1/org_newsletter_910/,

Respect and love for other people,

I'll try to get back into it. In the meantime here's a great poem from a newsletter that'll get you up higher on the tone scale. Really knock the ol' engrams loose.


A POEM TO LIVE BY:

There once was a student with confusions galore,
He simply wanted to study no more.

Then he began using the glossary in the back of the book.
Whenever there was a confusion, he would determinedly look,

until he found the word or words that were holding him back,
and when he found them he would go on the attack,

using them in sentences until they made full sense.
A clear happy feeling was his recompense.

Then he would head with a bound,
back to the passage where the misunderstood word had been found.

Lo and behold, word clearing now became his new toy,
and reading his book was a new-found joy.

So that is the story of the student who once found study confusing.
He now enjoys study and he's no longer losing.",,False,,t5_2qh3a,False,,,True,t3_zogqs,http://www.reddit.com/r/scientology/comments/zogqs/back_from_the_rpf_heres_a_poem/,

So, a survey recently popped up in a couple of subreddits on the subject of religion but people weren't too happy with the questions. I've attempted to compose a more versatile and inclusive survey. 

This survey has been created as an attempt to compile information on the various religious beliefs, and lack thereof, on Reddit. Please answer all questions with sincerity and honesty. Please note, this is not a quick ""check one and done"" survey and may take a little while to complete. Also, I have NOT included topics like abortion and homosexuality for a reason. Please do not bring them up in this survey's topic. We are collecting opinions on spirituality, not attempting to fire up yet another debate.

Please upvote this survey so that more data can be collected. This is a self post, so I'm not getting any karma. But we get the best results when many, many people take the survey.

Survey Link: http://www.screator.net/showform.php?f=620542889

A full list of the subreddits being surveyed follows:
r/Christianity, r/Atheism, r/Buddhism, r/Hinduism, r/Islam, r/Pagan, r/Judaism, r/TrueAtheism, r/Agnosticism, r/Deism, r/NeoPagan, r/Satanism, r/Scientology, r/Humanism, r/Taoism, r/Shinto, r/UUreddit, r/Pantheism, r/DebateReligion, r/ExploreReligion, r/Catholicism, r/NewAge.

If you have any subreddit suggestions, please comment! I'll probably post it there as well. The survey ends Sunday, July 22, 2012. 

Also, it may take a little while for me to get ALL of these topics up. There is a wait between submissions. But they'll all be up tonight.",,False,,t5_2qh3a,False,,,True,t3_wqplx,http://www.reddit.com/r/scientology/comments/wqplx/religions_of_reddit_survey/,

Now I have learned my lesson about judging someones religion from the media, with asking r/islam what they really believe, and found out I was totally wrong. So with that said, explain to me the following: 

what Scientology is?

What are your methods?

why you chose to believe it?

 and Why is their so much garbage about it, and do you agree with the article or what the garbage was about? (Sorry for calling it ""garbage"" hopefully doesn't offend!

Dear Steve, 

You will have received a letter from our lawyers in relation to a confidentiality agreement in place between the Church and Valeska Paris. 

Without prejudice to the Church’s rights arising under the confidentiality agreement and in view of the intended broadcast, the Church wishes to formally respond to these allegations. 

Put bluntly, your request is ridiculous. Valeska Paris was a crew member aboard a ship. All passports of crew members were held by the Port Captain in accordance with maritime regulations so they can be stamped in and out of ports as the ship sailed. 

Valeska left the ship hundreds of times to go shopping, for outings with her husband on islands such as Aruba, St. Barts and Curaçao, as well as for numerous other reasons while aboard. In 2001, she hosted six members of her husband’s family. She participated in extended projects in the UK, US and Denmark. She certainly wasn’t “forced” to be there. She was also never forced to perform labor in the engine room. 

The Freewinds is a wonderful place, as even Valeska said on numerous occasions. Her allegation that she could only leave the ship with an escort is totally false. 

Any decision Valeska made with respect to whether she communicated with her mother was her decision alone. This is a fact supported by documentation. 

Valeska was one of thousands of members of the Sea Organization, the Church’s  religious order, and was a steward in our hotel aboard the ship and in a hotel at our religious retreat in Clearwater. She was also a Scientology auditor briefly, however her certificates were cancelled for violations of the Auditor’s Code. 

As to the allegations concerning Mr. Miscavige, it is ludicrous to suggest that someone in Valeska’s position had a close and personal relationship with the ecclesiastical leader of the religion. Those allegations are denied. 

Valeska started a relationship with Chris Guider (another unreliable source) and chose to leave the Sea Organization to have a baby. She left the Church on amicable terms and the Church gave her assistance to set up her new life, care for her baby. We wished her well. 

That she now is attacking her former religion and former friends and fabricating these stories speaks volumes about her. She is a true apostate.
 
So there is no doubt as to our position: Valeska is lying to you. She is an unreliable source. It would be wholly irresponsible for Lateline to broadcast these spurious and uncorroborated claims. It would do so at its own risk.

Your source is doing this because she and Chris Guider apparently cannot get their life in order and move on. For them, it is sad. For ABC, it is dishonest to pretend this is a news story.

http://writer.lronhubbard.org/page98.htm

http://writer.lronhubbard.org/page99.htm

---

*But there is more to this: science fiction, particularly in its golden age, had a mission. I cannot, of course, speak for my friends of that period. But from Campbell and from “shooting the breeze” with other writers of the time, one got the very solid impression that they were doing a heavy job of beating the drum to get man to the stars.*

*At the beginning of that time, science fiction was regarded as a sort of awful stepchild in the world of literature. But worse than that, science itself was not getting the attention or the grants or the government expenditures it should have received. There has to be a lot of public interest and demand before politicians shell out the financing necessary to get a subject whizzing.*

*Campbell’s crew of writers were pretty stellar. They included very top-liner names. They improved the literary quality of the genre. And they began the boom of its broader popularity.*

*A year or so after the golden age began, I recall going into a major university’s science department. I wanted some data on cytology for my own serious researches. I was given a courteous reception and was being given the references when I noticed that the room had been gradually filling up. And not with students but with professors and deans. It had been whispered around the offices who was in the biology department, and the next thing I knew, I was shaking a lot of hands held out below beaming faces. And what did they want to know: What did I think of this story or that? And had I seen this or that writer lately? And how was Campbell?*

*They had a literature! Science fiction!*

*And they were proud of it!*

*For a while, before and after World War II, I was in rather steady association with the new era of scientists, the boys who built the bomb, who were beginning to get the feel of rockets. They were all science fiction buffs. And many of the hottest scientists around were also writing science fiction on the side.*

*In 1945 I attended a meeting of old scientist and science fiction friends. The meeting was at the home of my dear friend, the incomparable Bob Heinlein. And do you know what was their agenda? **How to get man into space fast enough so that he would be distracted from further wars on Earth.** And they were the lads who had the government ear and authority to do it! We are coming close to doing it. The scientists got man into space and they even had the Russians cooperating for a while.*

*One can’t go on living a naive life believing that everything happens by accident, that events simply follow events, that there is a natural order of things and that everything will come out right somehow. That isn’t science. That’s fate, kismet, and we’re back in the world of fantasy. No, things do get planned.*

*The golden age of science fiction that began with Campbell and Astounding Science Fiction gathered enough public interest and readership to help push man into space. Today, you hear top scientists talking the way we used to talk in bull sessions so long ago.*


*The golden age of science fiction that began with Campbell and Astounding Science Fiction gathered enough public interest and readership to help push man into space.*
	
*Campbell did what he set out to do. So long as he had his first wife and others around him to remind him that science was for people, that it was no use to just send machines out for the sake of machines, that there was no point in going into space unless the mission had something to do with people, too, he kept winning. For he was a very brilliant man and a great and very patient editor. After he lost his first wife, Doña, in 1949 – – she married George O. Smith – – and after he no longer had a sounding board who made him keep people in stories, and when he no longer had his old original writing crew around, he let his magazine slip back, and when it finally became named Analog, his reign was over. But the golden age had kicked it all into high gear. So Campbell won after all.*",,False,,t5_2qh3a,True,,,True,t3_9pcnq,http://www.reddit.com/r/scientology/comments/9pcnq/l_ron_hubbard_on_the_secret_agenda_of_science/,

Scientific paper published Feb 2010 in the New England Journal of Medicine:

[Willful Modulation of Brain Activity in Disorders of Consciousness](http://content.nejm.org/cgi/content/full/NEJMoa0905370)

Often scientologists will see things like this as validating Scientology. 

YMMV

just for the record, while the unconscious person assist dates back to the 1960s and earlier, the area has not been devoid of medical research. Work in the 1990s and later provides this:

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Process_Oriented_Coma_Work

*Coma work begins with the attitude that the comatose patient is capable of perceiving and relating to outer and inner experience, no matter how minimally. The coma worker therefore tries to discover what communication channels are open to the patient, and then to use these channels to relate to the patient's experience.*

*Channels of communication may be identified by noticing small, sometimes minute signals in the form of movement, eye movement, facial expressions, and vocalization by the patient. The coma worker then attempts to interact with the patient by interacting with and amplifying these signals.*

*During the interaction, the coma worker is guided by feedback from the patient. For instance, if the coma worker joins the patient in vocalizations, perhaps adding a bit of extra modulation, the patient may respond by changing his or her own vocalization. In addition, the coma worker may attempt to set up a ""binary"" communication link, inviting the patient to use available movement, like the movement of an eyelid or a finger, to answer ""yes"" or ""no"" to questions.*

which compares with the original Scientology technique.

Thus we see that there are techniques in Scientology that can get results, and which have validation in the independent research of others, who may have been totally unaware of the Scientology procedure.

brings up some of the personal dilemmas this creates for people:

*As if confirming this, in my other course—this time a class of undergraduates exploring why we believe the things we do—we happened to be exploring the question of what constitutes a person. We had just read Descartes’ famous treatise (in which he proclaims “I think, therefore I am”) and the neuroscientist Antonio Damasio’s Descartes’ Error. Based on this new MRI research, we asked the question: If your Dad can only communicate through ‘thought MRI’ like patients in this study, would you consider him alive?*

*A student answered: I’d rather pull the plug, let him die. From personal experience, I’d rather just pull the plug. Tears formed in the student’s eyes, she broke down, and ran from the room.*

I think that it is humane to have something that any person can do to help the unconscious person that they care about.",,False,,t5_2qh3a,True,,,True,t3_b2por,http://www.reddit.com/r/scientology/comments/b2por/for_a_long_time_scientology_has_had_what_is/,
