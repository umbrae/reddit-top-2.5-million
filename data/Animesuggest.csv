1367210476.0,50,self.Animesuggest,1dbi5u,[Suggestion] Airing Anime [Spring 2013],56,6,30,http://www.reddit.com/r/Animesuggest/comments/1dbi5u/suggestion_airing_anime_spring_2013/,"I'm sorry this is so late and incomplete. I've been very busy with college as the semester is coming to a close. I'll try and finish what I haven't yet completed within the next few days. Here's what I have so far:

***

As you all probably know, a knew anime season began these past few weeks. Here are the airing shows I'm following. If they seem interesting to you you should check them out:

* **[Attack on Titan](http://myanimelist.net/anime/16498/Shingeki_no_Kyojin):** Attack on Titan is amazing so far. It's set in a world where humans live in fear of giant human-like creatures called ""Titans"". Humanity lives behing three massive walls designed to keep the Titans out. However, after roughly 100 years the Titans break through. The story follows a boy named Eren as he enlists with the goal of eradicating the Titans from the face of the Earth. The show is extremely well done. The art is great, the characters are wonderful, and the story is interesting. I highly recommend it to anyone who likes action shows in a despairing setting.

* **[Hataraku Maou-sama!](http://myanimelist.net/anime/15809/Hataraku_Maou-sama!):** Hataraku Maou-sama! is currently my favorite show airing. It is about the Demon Lord Sadao who is forced to flee to another world in order to escape the hero Emilia. What world does he end up in? Modern Tokyo. Hilarity ensues. The language barrier and lack of money make things hard for him and his General, Ashiya, but they eventually get things worked out. Sadao gets a job at the universe's version of McDonalds and Ashiya spends his days trying to figure out how to get back. They get into a nice routine until, guess who... Emilia suddenly appears before them. Things get really complicated. It's a great show. The comedy is top notch, the characters are great in their interactions and development, and the premise itself is beyond amazing. I've given it a 10/10 on MAL. I highly recommend everyone check it out.

* **[Yuyushiki](http://myanimelist.net/anime/15911/Yuyushiki):** Yuyushiki is one of my favorites this season. It's a light-hearted comedy centered around 3 freshmen girls in highschool. If I had to describe it I'd call it a cross between [Nichijou](http://myanimelist.net/anime/10165/Nichijou) and [A-Channel](http://myanimelist.net/anime/9776/A-Channel). It's really funny and really relaxing. I can't recommend it enough!

* **[Aiura](http://myanimelist.net/anime/17082/Aiura):** A short SoL centered around three girls. Since it's a short (only 5 mins per episode). After two episodes I can say that I really like it. It's cute, funny, and relaxing. It reminds me, once again, of [A-Channel](http://myanimelist.net/anime/9776/A-Channel) and a bit of [Yama no Susume](http://myanimelist.net/anime/14355/Yama_no_Susume). Great little show to just watch and unwind.

* **[Suisei no Gargantia](http://myanimelist.net/anime/16524/Suisei_no_Gargantia):** Gargantia is incredible so far. I'm not exactly sure how to describe it. The main character ends up stranded on Earth, which is supposedly long dead, only to find that people are still living and thriving. The language barrier is done beautifully and he can only communicate with them through the translator the AI in his mecha has written. While he tries to figure out what to do about getting back to his ""world"" he is caught up in the struggles of the peope who found him. The art is great, the characters are well done, and the writing is amazing. I can't recommend this show enough and my little blurb here is not doing it justice at all.

* **[Toaru Kagaku no Railgun S](http://myanimelist.net/anime/16049/Toaru_Kagaku_no_Railgun_S):** I'm not going to say much about Railgun because since it's the fourth season of the Toaru Series it's most likely that everyone who would watch it already is. Basically, Railgun S is serving as the sequel to Railgun. It takes place parallel to the first season of Index. It is actually covering the Radio Noise arc (aka the SISTERS Project arc), Misaka's character arc in Index, from Misaka's point of view. Having read the manga I can say that this arc is awesome. I can't wait for The Railgun v.s. The Meltdowner! So far it's been about as good an adaptation as the first season of Railgun. it has filler but it doesn't interfere with the canon material. If you're not familiar with the Toaru Series I highly recommend it. I'd recommend watching the series in this order:
 1. [Toaru Majutsu no Index](http://myanimelist.net/anime/4654/Toaru_Majutsu_no_Index)
 2. [Toaru Kagaku no Railgun](http://myanimelist.net/anime/6213/Toaru_Kagaku_no_Railgun) (Spin-off prequel to Index)
 3. [Toaru Majutsu no Index](http://myanimelist.net/anime/8937/Toaru_Majutsu_no_Index_II) (Sequel to Index)
 4. [Toaru Kagaku no Railgun S](http://myanimelist.net/anime/16049/Toaru_Kagaku_no_Railgun_S)

     It's an incredibly fun series that builds a complex and complete world full of interesting characters. [Here is an AMV](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B88Fws5MEPs) I made to give people a feel for the show. I also highly recommend reading the [Index light novels](http://www.baka-tsuki.org/project/index.php?title=Toaru_Majutsu_no_Index#The_Toaru_Majutsu_no_Index_series) after watch the series.

* **[Namiuchigiwa no Muromi-san](http://myanimelist.net/anime/16910/Namiuchigiwa_no_Muromi-san):** A short about a mermaid named Muromi. It's very similar to [Senyuu](http://myanimelist.net/anime/15751/Senyuu.) with its ridiculous comedy mixed with some pretty awesome battle scenes.

* **[Date A Live](http://myanimelist.net/anime/15583/Date_A_Live):** Date A Live is a parody (or at least I hope it's a parody) of your typical dating sim game. For the past 30 years Earth has been plagued by strange phenomena known as ""spacequakes"". These ""spacequakes"" completely obliterate anything in the immediate area and cause major damage to the surrounding areas. They're caused by spirits coming to Earth. Now, what would be the best way to get the spirits to stop causing massive death and destruction? Did you say ""Get one to date a highschool boy so she'll fall in love and want to protect the Earth""? No? Well, too bad, because that's the plan. It's hilarious, the art is great, the characters are good, and the story is interesting to say the least. The premise actually reminds me a bit of [The World God Only Knows](http://myanimelist.net/anime/8525/Kami_nomi_zo_Shiru_Sekai), but it's not as good so far. It's nothing groundbreaking but it's a fun watch.

* **[Kakumeiki Valvrave](http://myanimelist.net/anime/16668/Kakumeiki_Valvrave):** Valvrave is one of you ""mecha series with a twist"". I'm not going to go into what the twist is because I don't want to spoil it even though you find it out in the first two episodes. What I will say is that this show is good. It has great art, good characters, and a dark feel. Also, based on the end of the third episode the ""antagonist"" just became really *really* interesting. I can't wait for more of this to come out. Anyone who likes mechas, hell even those who don't (the twist may be enough to keep you interested), should check out Valvrave.

* **[Hentai Ouji no Warawanai Neko](http://myanimelist.net/anime/15225/Hentai_Ouji_to_Warawanai_Neko.):** This show is funny and well written so far. Basically it's your typical ""be careful what you wish for"" story. In an attempt to make their lives easier the main characters end up making them hundreds of times more difficult as they completely lose their ability to effectively interact with others. People who like drama comedies will like HenNeko.

* **[Photokano](http://myanimelist.net/anime/16397/Photokano):** Photokano is another SoL show. I have to say I'm not very impressed by it so far. It's about a boy who gets a camera from his father and begins photographing things (mostly girls at school). So far it seems to be a generic school anime with your usual mix of cliched character types and fanservice. There hasn't really been much character development in the first three episodes and that's not usually a good sign. I'm finding it relatively enjoyable but it's nothing special.

* **[Ginga Kikoutai Majestic Prince](http://myanimelist.net/anime/15863/Ginga_Kikoutai_Majestic_Prince):** Like mechas? You'll probably enjoy Majestic Prince. Hate mechas? This isn't the show for you. Nothing quite special about MJP but it's enjoyable for mecha fans. Plus Sawashiro Miyuki is always a good reason to watch something. The art is so-so. The mechas are pretty cool but the characters themselves are a bit lacking, but that may just be the style. I'm enjoying it so far.

* **[Aku no Hana](http://myanimelist.net/anime/16201/Aku_no_Hana):** After the first episode this show was about the seventh lowest rated shows on MAL. Why? Because people hated the animation because it was ""ugly"". Ako no Hana is rotoscope animation. This means it was filmed live-action and then animated based on the film. I personally don't love this style but it shouldn't be condemned because of it. It fits with the show's dark atmosphere. The plot is rather interesting. The MC, in a moment of sheer stupidity, grabs his crush's gym clothes and takes them home. Unfortunately for him the class's trouble student saw him and now she's blackmailing him.  If you like different styles of animation you'll love this show.

* **[Arata Kangatari](http://myanimelist.net/anime/16518/Arata_Kangatari):** A bullied highschooler with no friends and a boy from another world who has been framed for murder. What connection could these two possibly have? Well, they have the same name and due to circumstances I won't go into their existences have been switched. Can the Arata from Japan survive while being pursued by powerful warriors who possess magic weapons? Can the other Arata survive in Japan? Can they get back to their own worlds? I personally plan to watch and find out. I know I did a horrible job with that explanation but I'm not really sure what else to say about it. it's an interesting concept, the art is nice, and I like the story so far.

* **[Mushibugyou](http://myanimelist.net/anime/17505/Mushibugyou):** This is a show about a samurai in ancient Japan who joins a group dedicated to protecting people from the giant man-eating insects that appeared 100 years earlier. In the first discussion thread over in /r/anime someone described Mushibugyou as ""So shounen it hurts"". I'm inclined to agree with this, though it's not necessarily a bad thing. It is definitely a shounen anime but it's an entertaining one. If you want a show that's just cool fight scenes and a typical shounen MC then you'll like Mushibugyou. It's a great show to just sit back and watch.

* **[Karneval](http://myanimelist.net/anime/16035/Karneval_(TV):** Karneval feels to me like a cross between [Pandora Hearts](http://myanimelist.net/anime/5530/Pandora_Hearts) and [[K]](http://myanimelist.net/anime/14467/K). The character designs are really cool, the world is wacky, and the characters are interesting. A plot hasn't really developed yet but it's pretty enjoyable even without one. It's an interesting show.

***

Very brief opinion of shows I haven't gotten around to writing up:

* **[Devil Survivor 2 The Animation](http://myanimelist.net/anime/16512/Devil_Survivor_2_The_Animation):** Adaptation of the game of the same name. It's from the same series as the Persona games. I'm liking it quite a bit.

* **[Dansai Bunri no Crime Edge](http://myanimelist.net/anime/16355/Dansai_Bunri_no_Crime_Edge):** Very original, very interesting, very good.

* **[OreImo S2](http://myanimelist.net/anime/13659/Ore_no_Imouto_ga_Konnani_Kawaii_Wake_ga_Nai.):** Second season of OreImo.

* **[Yahari Ore no Seishun Love Come wa Machigatteiru](http://myanimelist.net/anime/14813/Yahari_Ore_no_Seishun_Love_Come_wa_Machigatteiru.):** Comedy with your typical cynical MC. Good so far. Pretty funny.

* **[Zettai Bouei Leviathan](http://myanimelist.net/anime/17681/Zettai_Bouei_Leviathan):** Ok so far. Not too special. Nice art.

The protagonist is a rookie cop on hunt for a serial killer.",49,7,20,http://www.reddit.com/r/Animesuggest/comments/1i7o4a/psychopass_is_a_2012_show_written_by_urobochi_gen/,"The premise of the world is that Japan is isolated (once again) and governed by a net of supercomputers called ""Sybil System."" Sybil System can look at a person trough a special sensors that inform it whether a person is likely to commit a crime or not.

It leads to extremely safe society where you can keep your door unlocked when leaving for vacation and walk in the middle of the night anywhere with no fear of being attacked, . However, many innocent people are in (de facto) prison for something they only might do.

The cast, department of public safety bureau is diverse and each of them is interesting. The relationships with each other even more so. All undergo some form of character development and are definitely one of the most dynamic and interesting groups in anime (and any show or film in general).

The show's premise might remind you of Minority Report and Gattaca, however, I think it is much different and have few common points. Also, it is way better than any of these movies.

You could meet these people everyday and not notice anything weird about them.

The female main character, very relatable girl, discovers she can manipulate time one day. She starts to cheat the system a bit, with unpredictable results (anyone seen Butterfly Effect?). I will not spoil too much, it is a good film, enjoy it.

Here's a small list of ""beginner-friendly"" anime.",32,6,69,http://www.reddit.com/r/Animesuggest/comments/1j41b4/suggestion_brand_new_to_anime_dont_know_what_kind/,"**NOTE:** I have linked the wikipedia articles here. Be smart and don't read the entire ""plot"" section because wikipedia does not hide spoilers. Read the first few sentances of the plot to get the gist of the anime.

* [Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood:](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fullmetal_Alchemist#Fullmetal_Alchemist:_Brotherhood) This is an amazing mix of science and magic that explores the concept of Alchemy: the process of deconstructing matter and reconstructing it into a different form, shape, element, compound, or state of matter. The laws of alchemy must strictly adhere to the law that matter cannot be created or destroyed. The story follows Edward Elric: a young alchemist working for the military who is trying to find a way to restore his brother's body, which was taken when the two tried to use alchemy to transmute a human being. Anime is around 60 episodes.

* [Angel Beats:](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angel_Beats!) A shorter anime that takes place in a purgatory-ish world. The story follows a group of deceased high-school kids (specifically a boy named Otonashi, who is suffering from amnesia) who fight against Angel: a seemingly omnipotent being in the form of a high-school aged girl. Anime is around 12 episodes. Also notable is the soundtrack, which is very well done.

* [Death Note:](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death_Note) This story follows Light Yagami, an incredibly brilliant high school student who finds a notebook belonging to a Shinigami: a god of death. The Death Note is what Shinigami use to kill humans when their time comes. Light, however, soon learns that the Death Note can be used by humans, and, under the alias ""Kira"", uses it to try to rid the world of evil. This is a great anime for fans of something a bit darker and supernatural. It is very dialogue-driven and it is very interesting to observe Light planning his actions 3 moves ahead of his opponents. the anime is about 40 episodes.

* [Clannad:](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clannad_(visual_novel) This series begins very slowly as a cute high-school comedy/romance with a minor paranormal background. The first half of the first season can be very slow, but you should watch it for humor and establishment of the main characters. The second season, named Clannad: AfterStory picks up the pace and really gets the emotions going for the main characters. AfterStory follows the characters from their senior year of highschool into their adulthood and takes a more serious turn while keeping a healthy balance of humor. Both seasons are around 25 episodes each, and both have an OVA.

* [Spirited Away:](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spirited_Away) not a series, but a touching movie following a ten-year old girl as she tries to reverse the effects of a witch's spell that turned her parents into pigs. The movie has a wide array of paranormal elements and is just over 2 hours long. If you have not seen any anime movies yet, this is the one to start with. It has gotten overwhelming positive reviews from critics worldwide. 

* [Soul Eater:](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soul_Eater_(manga)) a less serious anime that still has a pretty good plot. The story follows 7 students at the DWMA, a specialized school run by Death. Students at the DWMA are trained to fight demons known as Kinshin. There are two groups of students at the DWMA: ones who can transform into a weapon, and meisters who wield said weapons. Weapon/Meister partners work together to try to collect 99 kinshin souls and the soul of a witch, at which point the weapon will be considered worthy of use by Lord Death himself. The art style in this series is great, and the series is consistently funny. The only downside is that the ending really isn't too good. The anime is about 50 episodes

* [Samurai Champloo:](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samurai_Champloo) This series lacks the supernatural elements that the other anime in this list have, making it an easier story to comprehend. It is set in the Edo period of Japan and incorperates an unusual, but fitting, influence of modern day hip-hop themes, which go surprisingly well with the anime's setting. The story follows Mugen and Jin, two incredibly skilled samurai with fighting styles and personalities that are polar opposites of each other. The two become indebted to a 15 year-old girl named Fuu, who makes them act as bodyguards for her as they journey to find a ""Samurai who smells of sunflowers."" The anime is 26 episodes, with a few of them being filler episodes intended to present alternative fictional origin stories of japanese culture (for example: a made up account of the introduction of baseball to japan).

* [Kaze No Stigma:](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kaze_no_Stigma) An anime focusing heavily on the concept of elemental magic. Great choice for anyone who enjoyed Avatar: The Last Airbender. The story follows a wind magic user who is disowned by his family because of his inability to use fire magic The series is 24 episodes and focuses heavily on the spirit world and the elements.

* [Cowboy Bebop:](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cowboy_Bebop) Cowboys in space? This series is a Western and Sci-Fi blend that is accompanied with a jazz soundtrack. The story follows Spike Spiegel, a former hitman turned bounty hunter, who travels around the solar system with his partner, Jet. Along the way they meet some interesting folks and get into tough situations when claiming bounties. The anime is 26 episodes long. *Thanks to /u/KrazyKomrade for contributing!*

* [Full Metal Panic!:](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Full_Metal_Panic!)In short it's a 'boy meets girl' type of story with the twist that the boy is a child soldier who is almost completely incapable of acting 'normally'. Add in some international espionage and giant robots and you have Full Metal Panic! It has 3 seasons with the first clocking in at 24 episodes and the other 2 clocking in at 12-13 episodes. The mecha action is pretty good, but the character relationships are more than enough to stand on their own. *Thanks to /u/Unshkblefaith for contributing!*

* [Sword Art Online:](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sword_Art_Online) Anime based on a series of light novels. The story revolves around a teenager boy named Kirito who has rejected the real world and spends his time playing a VRMMORPG (Virtual Reality Massively Multiplayer Online Role Playing Game) called Sword Art Online using a helmet called the NerveGear. One day he finds out that he and other players find out that they cannot log out of the game and must beat the game in order to log out and take the helmet off safely. Anyone who dies inside the game dies in real life. The anime is 25 episodes long and is split into two arcs each containing a separate game. Enjoyable for anyone that likes to play games or wants to see a decent action/romance combination. *Thanks to /u/LolCakeLazors for contributing!*

* [AnoHana:](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anohana:_The_Flower_We_Saw_That_Day) A short, 11 episode anime centered on a group of 6 friends who split up after the death of their friend Menma. As a result of the death, the main character, Jinta, rejects society and spends his life inside his house. Jinta soon finds that he can see the spirit of Menma who wishes to get the group of friends back together. Has a great cast of likable characters. Recommended for anyone that enjoyed Angel Beats or Clannad. **Note:**This isn't available in english, only Japanese with english subtitles *Thanks to /u/LolCakeLazors for contributing!*

* [High School of the Dead:](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Highschool_of_the_Dead) **WARNING: NSFW** This anime is set in a zombie apocalypse, where the infection starts at a high school in Japan The story follows a group of high school students, the school's nurse, and a young girl as they fight their way to safety through the deadly streets of Japan during the worldwide catastrophic event known as the ""Outbreak"". As the cast tries to survive the zombie apocalypse, they must also face the additional threats of societal collapse, in the form of dangerous fellow survivors, and the possible decay of their own moral codes. This anime is 12 episodes long. **WARNING:** This anime contains tons of nudity. Additionally, almost every other camera angle is an upskirt. The majority of anime are not this sexually explicit. Not reccomended if you are uncomfortable with cartoon boobies and upskirts distracting you from the actual story. If you're into that stuff, by all means watch for the boobies, but the anime also has a pretty decent storyline.

* [Mushishi: ""Mushi"":](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mushishi) the most basic forms of life in the world. They exist without any goals or purposes aside from simply ""being."" They are beyond the shackles of the words ""good"" and ""evil"". This is, however, just a vague definition of these entities that inhabit the vibrant world of Mushishi, as to even call them a form of life would be an oversimplification. Detailed information on Mushi is scarce because the majority of humans are unaware of their existence. So what are Mushi and why do they exist? This is the question that a ""Mushi-shi"", Ginko, ponders constantly. Mushi-shi are those who research Mushi in hopes of understanding their place in the world's hierarchy of life. Ginko chases rumors of occurrences that could be tied to Mushi, all for the sake of finding an answer. A series of 24 stand alone episodes that follow Ginko's travels and experiences, Mushishi is a beautiful and slow paced show that provides a very relaxing feeling. *Thanks to /u/JBHUTT09 for contributing!*

* [FLCL:](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fooly_Cooly) Fooly Cooly FLCL revolves around Naota Nandaba, a 12-year-old, working class boy living with his widower father and grandfather. His life in the city of Mabase is interrupted by the arrival of Haruko Haruhara, who runs over Naota with her Vespa scooter, gives him CPR, then hits him on the head with a blue vintage Rickenbacker 4001 left-handed electric bass guitar. Naota discovers that the blow to his head created an ""N.O."" portal, from which giant robots produced by a company known as Medical Mechanica emerge periodically. *Thanks to /u/sexyagentdingdong for contributing!*

* [Code Geass: Lelouch of the Rebellion:](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code_Geass) The series is set in an alternative timeline where the world is split into three superpowers, Britannia, the Chinese Federation, and the European Union. The story takes place after the Holy Britannian Empire's conquest on Japan in August 10, 2010 a.t.b., by means of Britannia's newest weapon, the ""Autonomous Armored Knight"", or Knightmare Frame. In turn, Britannia effectively strips Japan and its citizens of all rights and freedoms and renames the country Area 11 with its citizens referred to as Elevens.
Lelouch Lamperouge, the series' protagonist, is an intelligent exiled Britannian prince who was sent as a bargaining tool to Japan, along with his sister Nunnally Lamperouge, by his father, Emperor Charles zi Britannia, after his mother, Marianne vi Britannia, was murdered. When Marianne was murdered, Nunnally lost her sight and her ability to walk. After the war in the ruins of a Japanese city he then vows to his Japanese friend Suzaku Kururugi that he will one day obliterate Britannia. Seven years later, Lelouch gets caught up in a terrorist attack and finds a girl called C.C. (C2), who saves Lelouch's life from the Britannian Royal Guard, by making a contract with him that grants Lelouch a power known as Geass (ギアス giasu?). This power also known as the Power of the King (王の力 Ō no Chikara?), allows him to command anyone to do what he wants for one time, whether bending their will to live, fight, or die – though only with direct eye contact. After killing the Royal Guard with his new power, Lelouch decides to put his Geass to use and find the person who killed his mother while trying to make a better world for his sister, Nunnally. Lelouch in the process becomes the leader of the resistance movement known as The Black Knights under the alter-ego Zero, gaining popularity and support among the Japanese on his way towards rebellion. *This  is the description from Wikipedia*

* Hunter x hunter (2011): A boy called Gon decided to become a Hunter to search for his missing father, that is also a Hunter. He makes some friend that also have this objective, but to become a Hunter one must pass an long and strict Exam, that tests strength but also fast thinking and strategy. Hunters are a elite group that travels the world doing dangerous tasks and have permission to enter special areas and have access to a huge information network. Of course all kind of dangerous people also want those resources and came to take this Exam. *Thanks to /u/Ranchi for contributing!*




If anyone else has some good suggestions, feel free to add them in the comments. Alternatively, if you think that one of the series on the list should not be here, feel free to explain why in the comments.

*Note:* Remember that anime, especially ones with supernatural elements, can get a bit confusing if some of the details are lost in the translation. If there are any plot points in a series that you don't completely understand, definitely google a summary AFTER you finish the series.




EDIT: grammar, spelling, fixed links, added Cowboy Bebop, added Full Metal Panic!, added Sword Art Online, added AnoHana

EDIT 2: I'm considering adding **Highschool of the Dead** to this list. The reason being that its a short anime, the plot isn't very deep, and it has George Romero-style zombies, which is very western. I'm hesitating because of the amount of upskirts, cleavage, full-frontal nudity, bouncing titties, boob grabbing, full-rear nudity, underwear, naked females in a bathtub together, and various other fan service elements that could give newcomers the wrong impression about anime. Let me know what you guys think.

EDIT 3: Fuck it, I'm adding High School of the Dead

Edit 4: Added FLCL, Code Geass, and Mushishi. Fixed Light Yagami's misspelled name. I'll add links to those 3 tomorrow if I remember to

Also, can I just ask a favor for people if they want me to add an anime to this list? If you suggest one, please give a little description along with it. Earlier today, I had time to do all that because it was a slow work day. Now that its the weekend I won't be able to add things to the list as efficiantly. Thanks!

'nother EDIT: added links, replaced my terrible description of Geass with a better one from wikipedia

Edit 6: added  Hunter x Hunter

It is not subtle, characters often discuss philosphy that the movie references in the plot. I feel like the movie is often harshly criticized for it. Subtlety does not mean depth.

The movie has 2004 sequel called [Ghost in the Shell: Innocence](http://myanimelist.net/anime/468/Ghost_in_the_Shell_2:_Innocence). It split the fans of the show, one call it it a crap that only ripped off the original, others (including me) consider it a true successor to the firsts movie brilliance.

There is a digital retouch [Ghost in the Shell 2.0](http://myanimelist.net/anime/4672/Ghost_in_the_Shell_2.0) that you can skip. It is redundant like coloring Twelve Angry Men to feel more modern. The original classic animation is awesome, has soul and aged very well.

1350250823.0,24,self.Animesuggest,11h905,[Suggestion] Airing Anime,32,8,25,http://www.reddit.com/r/Animesuggest/comments/11h905/suggestion_airing_anime/,"As I'm sure many of you know, it's hard to catch up on anime when there are so many amazing ones out there. I used to be of the mentality that I wouldn't watch anything unless it was complete and I could marathon it. However, over the summer I started watching anime as it was airing. This method proved to be much more efficient as I could marathon shows in between watching the weekly releases. So I figured I'd post this here in the hopes that I'd make others lives easier as well.

Here are the currently airing shows that I'd highly recommend, including what type of show and what they're similar to:

* ***FINISHED*** [BTOOOM!](http://myanimelist.net/anime/14345/Btooom!) BTOOOM! is similar to [Sword Art Online](http://myanimelist.net/anime/11757/Sword_Art_Online) and [Accel World](http://myanimelist.net/anime/11759/Accel_World). In fact, I'd say that BTOOOM! is to Sword Art as Sword Art is to Accel World. While all three are centered around video games each one is a step up in terms of the stakes involved and the brutality of the game (Accel World-&gt;Sword Art-&gt;BTOOOM!). Only two episodes have aired so far but the plot and character development have been above average in my opinion. I'm looking forward to the rest of the show and recommend it to anyone who likes the survival game and video game genres.

* ***FINISHED*** [**Busou Shinki**](http://myanimelist.net/anime/14237/Busou_Shinki) If I had to describe Busou Shinki I would compare it to Pokemon with the difference being that instead of monster-like creatures, it has 15cm tall female robots. This show isn't about the fights (though it does have fights scenes which are very well done. The CGI style reminds me a lot of Black Rock Shooter.) so much as it is about what these Shinki do while their human 'masters' aren't around. I'd say the three episode rule is definitely applicable to Busou Shinki. I stated it when the first episode came out and was very put off by it for some reason. A few days ago I rewatched the first episode and the next two just to give it another chance. I have to say it grew on me. The characters are well developed and the stories are pretty good. It's not the best show ever but if you like slice-of-life comedies about out of the ordinary things you should give Busou Shinki a try.

* ***FINISHED*** [Chuunibyou demo Koi ga Shitai!](http://myanimelist.net/anime/14741/Chuunibyou_demo_Koi_ga_Shitai!) Now this one kind of angered me at first. I was all set to watch [this show](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YdYdaYBHzo) but instead I got a painfully funny slice-of-life. I still enjoy it and plan to continue it but I felt a bit cheated. KyoAni really got me good with that one. Anyway, if you enjoy painful comedies (like Curb Your Enthusiasm. I know it's not an anime but it's a perfect comparison and the best I can think of.) you'll love this show.

* ***FINISHED*** **[CØDE:BREAKER](http://myanimelist.net/anime/11703/Code:Breaker)** CØDE:BREAKER addresses the issue of whether 'evil' people should be killed as punishment for the public good. The main character encounters an eliminator who can burn anything out of existence with a touch of his left hand. She swears to follow him to try to prevent him from killing anyone as she doesn't believe what he is doing is justified. At the same time an even greater conflict begins. It's very interesting and I highly recommend it.

* [Ixion Saga DT](http://myanimelist.net/anime/14765/Ixion_Saga_DT) Now I just watched the first episode this morning without any preconceived notions about the show. I saw it on commiesubs' torrent page and though ""Ahn, what the hell?"" So I downloaded it and watched it. My god this show is funny. Imagine your typical old school cynical high school student flung into a strange fantastical world that's eerily similar to the video game he was playing only moments earlier. Shenanigans begin and hilarity ensues. A sillier version of [Zero no Tsukaima](http://myanimelist.net/anime/1195/Zero_no_Tsukaima), this show looks as though it'll be a fun and ridiculous ride.

* ***FINISHED*** [K](http://myanimelist.net/anime/14467/K) K seems to be the high production show of this season. Similar in appearance to [Guilty Crown](http://myanimelist.net/anime/10793/Guilty_Crown), K can best be described by it's elements of similarity with other titles. Combining the gang element of [Durarara!!](http://myanimelist.net/anime/6746/Durarara!!), the commonly known supernatural abilities and the not-so-far-fetched futuristic city of [Toaru Majutsu no Index](http://myanimelist.net/anime/4654/Toaru_Majutsu_no_Index), and the seemingly aloof and goofy but ultimately cool and calculating MC of [Trigun](http://myanimelist.net/anime/6/Trigun), K is a unique project. Because the first episode is largely serious and the second episode is more of a comedy, it's unclear of what this show really wants to be. The only thing I'm sure of at this point is that it'll be a fun watch. Anyone who wants beautiful artwork and music should check it out as well.

* [Little Busters!](http://myanimelist.net/anime/13655/Little_Busters!) Based on an extremely popular VN that I've never heard of, Little Busters! is a slice-of-life comedy about a group of childhood friends deciding to do one last fun thing before life ultimately throws them down their own respective paths. A heart warming story and an art style I think resembles [Angel Beats!](http://myanimelist.net/anime/6547/Angel_Beats!) this is the perfect show for anyone who wants something light-hearted to watch. At least, that's what it seems like at this early stage.

* [Magi](http://myanimelist.net/anime/14513/Magi) A new take on the Arabian Nights story. Don't know what else to say besides it's pretty and fun.

* ***FINISHED*** [**Medaka Box Abnormal**](http://myanimelist.net/anime/14527/Medaka_Box_Abnormal) Now I have not watched MBA yet but I have just started the first season, [Medaka Box](http://myanimelist.net/anime/11761/Medaka_Box), and am really enjoying it. I assume Abnormal will be of the same style so I thought I'd add it to the list. Medaka Box is very silly and very uplifting. I'm not really sure how to put it in words but it is a lot of fun to watch. A word of caution: if you can't ignore fanservice then this is not the show for you.

* [Psycho-Pass](http://myanimelist.net/anime/13601/Psycho-Pass) Now this show looks like it's gonna be one hell of a ride. A very Orwellian setting where even your thoughts could land you in ""rehabilitation"" and if the scanning system doesn't think you're worth the trouble? Well, you're gonna be turned into a mess of meat on the street. A very dark show that I can't recommend enough.

* [Robotics;Notes](http://myanimelist.net/anime/13599/Robotics;Notes) This one is an alternative setting to ChaoS;Head and Steins;Gate (the very first thing you see is a world line number). This means that it takes place in the same universe but has nothing to do with the events of the other two. The premise is pretty interesting. A high school robotics club is attempting to recreate a giant mecha from a popular anime for a robotics expo. Based on the ending scene of the first episode something strange is about to happen and shit may or may not hit the fan. If you liked the other semicolon series you should check this one out. It has nice animation and character designs as well as an awesome opening song.

* [Sakurasao no Pet na Kanjou](http://myanimelist.net/anime/13759/Sakurasou_no_Pet_na_Kanojo) Now since I am currently attending a liberal arts college in order to get a computer science degree, this show hits a little close to home. The MC is a 'normal' highschooler attending a private school that has a normal section and an art section. Through a series of circumstances he ends up living in the arts section's dorm along with all the eccentric kids. His goal is to 'escape' this dorm. Hilarity ensues.

* [Shinsekai Yori](http://myanimelist.net/anime/13125/Shinsekai_yori) From the New World is quickly becoming my favorite all time anime (a spot previously held by [Ano Natsu de Matteru](http://myanimelist.net/anime/11433/Ano_Natsu_de_Matteru) for reasons unknown even to me). This show is overflowing with a deep sense of despair the likes of which I've never felt before. As I watched the first few episodes it felt as though someone was kneeling on my chest, applying more and more weight as the episodes went on. The strange thing about this? The setting seems to be a utopia. There is nothing glaringly wrong. And yet something *is* horribly wrong. I just can't seem to pick out what that something is. Anyway, the artwork is beautiful and the story is captivating. Everyone needs to watch this show.

* ***FINISHED*** [**Sukitte Ii na yo**](http://myanimelist.net/anime/14289/Sukitte_Ii_na_yo.) 'Say ""I love you""' is a high school romance drama. There is nothing out of the ordinary and no silly shenanigans. I think the reason this show is so good is because it's so normal. It's just a story about two teens who are new to love trying to figure out just what it is they are doing. I'm really enjoying it and anyone who likes romances should check it out.

* ***FINISHED*** [Sword Art Online](http://myanimelist.net/anime/11757/Sword_Art_Online) This has been airing since July so not much really needs to be said about it I don't think. It's very good and everyone should give it a chance.

* ***FINISHED*** [Tonari no Kaibutsu-kun](http://myanimelist.net/anime/14227/Tonari_no_Kaibutsu-kun) A slice-of-life romcom. Pretty funny and very nice artwork. Anyone who wants to laugh should watch it.

* **[Zetsuen no Tempest: The Civilization Blaster](http://myanimelist.net/anime/14075/Zetsuen_no_Tempest)** If you like Accelerator from Toaru Majutsu no Index you're gonna love the co-MC of this show. Same insanity, same ruthlessness, same drive. A story about two highschool friends who must prevent a clan of mages from bringing about the end of the world, with nothing but a few talismans and the instruction of the world's most powerful mage (who currently has been stranded on a deserted island), Zetsuen no Tempest promises to be thrilling.

And that's all I have. I wrote this massive post in part because I like helping people find things they might like, but mostly because I have 3 essays due that I ***really*** don't want to do. Have fun! I hope everyone finds something they end up liking!

This anime is great for people looking for realistic or emotional anime",27,3,10,http://www.reddit.com/r/Animesuggest/comments/1i5v01/tokyo_magnitude_80_a_story_about_a_couple_kids_a/,"[MAL](http://myanimelist.net/anime/6211/Tokyo_Magnitude_8.0)    
   
I put off this anime for awhile. I figured, how much more can there be beyond the premise? I was wrong.   
    
I would recommend Tokyo Magnitude 8.0 to people looking for a realistic survival anime with many suspenseful moments as well as many heart wrenching moments. The story keeps you on your toes and pushes you through a wide range of emotions. It felt like watching a movie. In fact, I could totally picture a live action movie based off of it. 
       
The art style reminds me of a Mamoru Hosoda (Summer Wars, Girl that leapt through time) movie in that the backgrounds are very detailed, while the characters are simplistic and not as exaggerated like most anime.    
   
The characters themselves were interesting, each with their strengths and flaws. Throughout the series, you watch the two kids grow as they rub off on each other through the obstacles and trials they are forced to endure. Although, there were a few times I wanted to slap them around for being stupid.   
   
Tokyo Magnitude 8.0 was worth the watch. If you are looking for something different than the usual rom coms and action shounen, this might be for you. Even if the premise doesn't interest you, give it a shot, and make sure to stick with it to the end.

I saw the anime first and it is very good with great [soundtrack](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_zuLGYzd-U). They left out some more disturbing parts of manga, though, like drug use or child pornography, which is shame. Manga also wins in bluntness of the message and despair. I did not read the light novels but I really want to. 

Also, prepare to have very unflattering mirror shoved in your face, some people cannot even bear it.

In a second Afterword, dated April 2005, Takimoto admitted that he had not written ""a single new story"" since N.H.K. and that he was ""reduced to a NEET, ... living as a parasite on the royalties from this book.""

And I recommend it wholeheartedly.",27,5,8,http://www.reddit.com/r/Animesuggest/comments/1jn1af/quick_witted_smart_heroine_in_a_world_thats/,"This show is quite the trip. A young heroine with a quick wit and smart mouth manages to put herself into a position where an army of miniature humans with amazing technology but very little focus or attention to detail follow her around and have fun by creating a bit of a havoc. It's also her job to kind of get close and understand them, she of course did that by bribing them with sweets.  

This show's pastel art style is unique and lends a hand to all the craziness of the show itself making it that much more believable... but making it all that much more surreal. The music for the show throughout always fits and never is out of place and the antics of the fairies and the voices they have makes everything they do all the more comedic. The heroine of the story constantly playing the straight man to the other character and the army of fairies she looks over, her inner dialogue and sarcastic pokes and prods at all the situations she lands in adds to the show immensely - so much so that if you just like sarcastic characters that would be more then enough reason to watch this.  

This show isn't without any actual meaning however; it is in fact fairly interesting due to the fairies being a caricature of humanities current unsustainable personalities or how we are so easily lead into consumerism there's quite a few of these and looking out for them and noticing it can increase the enjoy-ability. The social commentary is quite damning to the way we act and in the show usually ends up with the fairies abandoning ship for greener pastures. Whether you care for this is another subject but if you do like this sort of social commentary then it can only be a plus.  

Overall the show is a bit off its rocker. I haven't even mentioned the bread, nor the chickens.   

Anyway, give it a shot if it sounds like the sort of thing you'd like.

Plot: 
One afternoon, the main character Matsutani Shu, meets a strage girl with blue hair. But before he gets a chance to talk with her, soldiers mounted on mechs appear out of nowhere. Shu tries to defend the girl from the soldiers, but they take both with them through a wormhole into a different dimension. Shu finds himself in a harsh desert world, ruled by a heartless dictator. His only thought is, to save the girl with the blue hair.


Who should watch this?
If you enjoyed Grave of the Fireflies or Hidashi no Gen this is definitely a series for you. The setting is a dark war dominated desert world with steam punk elements. Shu, the main character is a brave young boy who easily picks a fight to defend defenseless or innocent people.

 
Don’t watch this if you can’t handle depressing shows with various deaths, child soldiers, genocide and a general dark mood in every episode.

By that I do not want to hear Steins;Gate eventhough those kind of anime are great they are not what I am looking for.

To give you a couple more hints of what I am looking for:

- it should contain a serious topic (I know this one isn't hard)

- it should contain interesting characters (an awesome example would be Hisoka who is the creepiest motherfucker on earth but I wouldn't say Hunter X Hunter is what I am looking for either)

- It should be a little gruesome like Elfenlied (not that I am looking for a splatter I would prefer a non splatter but storywise it was pretty dark/mature and this was supported by the brutallity which shouldn't be the main topic though)

-I don't care about nudity, I mean if it is there it's okay and if not thats okay as well.

I hope you get a rough idea of what I am looking for.. I think Monster (not watched yet) would be the anime to watch because it seems to me to be rather dark. And if your suggestion doesn't fit this completely I still want you to post it.

This post contains brief descriptions of all the original anime (by original I mean not sequels, prequels, etc) that I'm watching this season. Hopefully you all find it helpful.

* **[Ai Mai Mi](http://myanimelist.net/anime/16169/Ai_Mai_Mi)** Ai Mai Mi is a comedic short (3 min per episode) about three girls who draw manga... or at least that's what they're *supposed* to be doing. It's fairly funny and the art is definitely different, but good. It's your classic comedy composed of ridiculous back-and-forths and funny reactions.

* **[AMESIA](http://myanimelist.net/anime/15085/Amnesia)** I really like AMNESIA based on the first episode. The premise is simple enough: A girl suddenly becomes self-aware and realizes she has no memories at all. A spirit named Orion informs her that her amnesia is a result of his screw up and that he intends to help her regain her memories. The catch is that for her to regain her memories she must interact with people. This means she can't let anyone know she has amnesia or she'll risk being confined to a hospital where her memory will continue to degrade. The art is really nice (I'd say it looks like a cross between [Pandora Hearts](http://myanimelist.net/anime/5530/Pandora_Hearts) and [[K]](http://myanimelist.net/anime/14467/K) and the opening is an instant favorite of mine. It's a bit confusing but I feel like that is on purpose to allow the viewer to sympathize with the Heroine's confusion. [ChäoS;HEAd](http://myanimelist.net/anime/4975/Ch%C3%A4oS;HEAd) did something very similar. I have very high hopes for this show and recommend it to anyone who likes psychological anime.

* **[Cuticle Tantei Inaba](http://myanimelist.net/anime/15109/Cuticle_Tantei_Inaba)** Cuticle Detective Inaba is... strange. Inaba is a werewolf detective who can track down people using a single strand of their hair and also gain different powers from different types of hair. He's also searching for his missing brother and trusting to a fault. Don't give up after only the first episode. The second one's humor feels much more natural and the pacing is much better as well. The comedy is beyond ridiculous and leaves you wondering ""What did I just watch?... And why did I like it?"" It moves very quickly and the humor is very out there. I'd compare it to [Joshiraku](http://myanimelist.net/anime/12679/Joshiraku) but with more physical comedy. Also [Azusa](http://i.imgur.com/I1QAy.gif) is the cutest thing I have ever seen! I want one so badly!

* **[GJ-bu](http://myanimelist.net/anime/14811/GJ-bu)** Good Job Club is another strange show. It seems to be a mash-up of many successful female protagonists from other shows and your average straight-man male. Though it's a bit formulaic I still enjoyed it. It's quite a bit of fun and just a nice relaxing show to simple watch and laugh at. I don't expect it to be ground breaking but I think it's going to be fun.

* **[Hakkenden: Touhou Hakken Ibun](http://myanimelist.net/anime/15613/Hakkenden:_Touhou_Hakken_Ibun)** Hakkenden seems to be your average shounen. That being said it's definitely not uninteresting. The MCs' seem to have some sort of spirits living inside of them and the Church seems to be after them because of it. There also seems to be a darker secret involving their past. It's exciting and action packed. I look forward to finding out more about the plot in weeks to come.

* **[Kotoura-san](http://myanimelist.net/anime/15379/Kotoura-san)** I went into Kotoura-san with no prior knowledge of it and let me tell you: the first half of episode 1 is incredibly depressing. It's one of the saddest, most heart breaking things I've ever seen. But all of a sudden it turns into a comedy. All I can say so far is that this show is very well done. If I had to describe it I'd say it's like [Another](http://myanimelist.net/anime/11111/Another) meets [Toradora!](http://myanimelist.net/anime/4224/Toradora!). I think Kotoura-san may become my favorite this season.

* **[Love Live! School Idol Project](http://myanimelist.net/anime/15051/Love_Live!_School_Idol_Project)** Love Live! is an idol show about a group of girls trying to form an idol group in order to increase applications to their highschool which is in danger of closing. So far it's cute and light-hearted. I'm not really sure what else to say about it after just one episode other than that it's piqued my interest.

* **[Mangirl!](http://myanimelist.net/anime/14045/Mangirl!)** No, Mangirl is NOT about transsexuals. It's supposed to be a combination of 'manga' and 'girl'. Like Ai Mai Mi it's about girls involved in manga. In this case, however, they are not drawing the manga themselves. They are attempting to start a manga magazine like Jump! but their lacking attention spans are hindering progress. It's another cute and funny short (3 min per episode).

* **[Maoyuu Maou Yuusha](http://myanimelist.net/anime/14833/Maoyuu_Maou_Yuusha)** Maoyuu is about medieval economics. To me it feels like a combination of [Spice and Wolf](http://myanimelist.net/anime/2966/Ookami_to_Koushinryou)'s story and [Fractale](http://myanimelist.net/anime/9314/Fractale)'s artwork. The first episode is a bit [fanservice-y](http://i.imgur.com/XhRsC.gif) but the second episode turns it way down and the plot really begins. I'm really enjoying Maoyuu and expect good things from it. Anyone who like Spice and Wolf should check it out.

* **[Mondaiji-tachi ga Isekai kara Kuru Sou Desu yo?](http://myanimelist.net/anime/15315/Mondaiji-tachi_ga_Isekai_kara_Kuru_Sou_Desu_yo)** Mondaiji feels a lot like a more serious version of [Dog Days](http://myanimelist.net/anime/10155/Dog_Days). I don't want to spoil anything so I won't say much about the plot but let me say I really REALLY like this show so far. Only one episode in and it's managed to hook me completely. It's a combination of action and comedy and I cannot wait for more.

* **[Ore no Kanojo to Osananajimi ga Shuraba Sugiru](http://myanimelist.net/anime/14749/Ore_no_Kanojo_to_Osananajimi_ga_Shuraba_Sugiru)** OreShura is a rom-com about a highschool boy, who hates love, that is blackmailed into a relationship with the school's most popular girl. Hilarity ensues as she gets her kicks by driving him and his childhood friend insane.

* **[Sasami-san@Ganbaranai](http://myanimelist.net/anime/14515/Sasami-san@Ganbaranai)** What did I just watch? No, seriously, what was that? And why exactly did I love it? Apparently it's a bit like Haruhi ([even threw in a reference](http://i.minus.com/iRS77bVJz4hQn.gif)) and it definitely has a wacky style similar to Bakemonogatari. Hopefully the later episodes will elaborate on what the hell it was I just saw, but either way this show looks like it's going to be a lot of fun. Also, [boob-zooka.](http://i.minus.com/idnoeQSbjm0Yq.gif) (*...classic Shaft...*)

* **[Senran Kagura](http://myanimelist.net/anime/15119/Senran_Kagura)** I honestly am not enjoying Senran that much. It's a lot like [Sekirei](http://myanimelist.net/anime/4063/Sekirei) but without the interesting premise that allowed me to ignore the fan-service. I'm not going to drop it because I try not to drop anything but if it doesn't pick up I'm definitely going to have to force myself to finish it. Hopefully it was just a weak first episode. However if you like busty ninjas and lots of fan-service, this is the show for you.

* **[Senyuu](http://myanimelist.net/anime/15751/Senyuu)** Another short (3 mins per episode), Senyuu is perhaps one of the funniest things I've seen in a while. It's completely ridiculous and has great back-and-forths. I can't wait for more of this.

* **[Tamako Market](http://myanimelist.net/anime/16417/Tamako_Market)** Holy crap is this bird funny. I've watched the first episode three times already it's so good. I would kill for that bird. Tamako is completely ridiculous and a lot of fun. I have really high hopes for it. Also KyoAni is as beautiful as always. Anyone who likes comedy should check it out.

* **[Vividred Operation](http://myanimelist.net/anime/14283/Vividred_Operation)** After the first episode Vividred feels like [Strike Witches](http://myanimelist.net/anime/3667/Strike_Witches) mixed with [Mahou Shoujo Lyrical Nanoha](http://myanimelist.net/anime/76/Mahou_Shoujo_Lyrical_Nanoha). Lots of [close up shots of young girls' asses](http://i.imgur.com/MgZMC.jpg ""Well that's *one* way to watch the sunrise..."") and these girls have to protect the world from some unknown enemy with a power that blurs the line between magic and technology. The enemy (called [Alones](http://i.imgur.com/zKViQ.jpg)) even look very similar to the [Neuroi](http://i.imgur.com/rQ6At.jpg) in Strike Witches, which is actually the reason I really like Strike Witches. I love the design and color scheme of these things (black/dark gray with red highlights). I'm going to continue watching just for the Alones and hopefully the plot picks up and the ass shots are toned down. This show has the potential to be something good but it's too early to tell whether it'll take full advantage of that.

* **[Yama no Susume](http://myanimelist.net/anime/14355/Yama_no_Susume) **Yama no Susume is a really cute heart warming short (3 mins per episode). It's about mountain climbing and I, being from the Adirondacks in New York, think a hiking anime is long overdue. It's very cute and a lot of fun. I look forward to each new episode.

* **[Zettai Karen Children: The Unlimited - Hyoubu Kyousuke](http://myanimelist.net/anime/16005/Zettai_Karen_Children:_The_Unlimited_-_Hyoubu_Kyousuke)** This show is awesome. It feels a lot like a combination of [CODE:BREAKER](http://myanimelist.net/anime/11703/Code:Breaker), [Jormungand](http://myanimelist.net/anime/12413/Jormungand), and the X-Men with a bit of [Code Geass](http://myanimelist.net/anime/1575/Code_Geass:_Hangyaku_no_Lelouch) or [Gundam 00](http://myanimelist.net/anime/2581/Mobile_Suit_Gundam_00) (or any show with a private armed resistance group) mixed in. The premise is interesting and the action is great. I have high hopes for this show.

Well that's all I'm watching, folks. Some of these are a little poorly written because I'm tired and it's hard to judge a show based on only one or two episodes. So all of these are merely my first impressions. Hopefully you guys find this helpful and I'll do another one a few weeks after the next season starts.

---
**EDIT:**

I figured for the hell of it I'd add shows that continued from the fall season:

* **[Ixion Saga DT](http://myanimelist.net/anime/14765/Ixion_Saga_DT)** Ixion Saga DT is funny. Funny as hell. It's utterly ridiculous. It's a parody and makes a lot of references to many popular shows but also maintains its originality. Imagine your typical old school cynical high school student flung into a strange fantastical world that's eerily similar to the video game he was playing only moments earlier. Shenanigans begin and hilarity ensues. A sillier version of [Zero no Tsukaima](http://myanimelist.net/anime/1195/Zero_no_Tsukaima), this show is a great way to relax and simply laugh your ass off.

* **[Little Busters!](http://myanimelist.net/anime/13655/Little_Busters!)** Little Busters! is extremely similar to [Angel Beats!](http://myanimelist.net/anime/6547/Angel_Beats!). I'm not saying the story is similar, it isn't, but the overall feel is very much the same. It's a mixture of comedy and drama with a bit of supernatural stuff thrown in here and there. The art is also very reminiscent of AB! and I would kill to go to a school with those uniforms (as I said above I'm a sucker for black and red). It's a great show and those who liked AB! should check it out.

* **[Magi](http://myanimelist.net/anime/14513/Magi)** Magi is an original take on The Arabian Nights. It's a lot of fun and the pacing is absolutely perfect. It has great characters and a lot of action. It's a wonderful show.

* **[Psycho-Pass](http://myanimelist.net/anime/13601/Psycho-Pass)** Oh my god this show... This show is ***NOT*** for the weak of heart. Set in an Orwellian future where a person's mental state can be quantified instantly, Psycho-Pass deals with the issues of human thought/desires versus the human will. It's one of the most brutal and disturbing things I've ever watched. I thought I was desensitized but man was I wrong. I hate this show for how it makes me feel but love it for the fact that it can.

* **[Robotics;Notes](http://myanimelist.net/anime/13599/Robotics;Notes)** The latest installment in the Semi;Colon Series, R;N takes place nine years after the events of [Steins;Gate](http://myanimelist.net/anime/9253/Steins;Gate) in a world with a different divergence ratio. R;N is incredible. It starts out a little slow but it picks up just like the other two S;C shows. It's a great watch and it's completely sucked me in. Anyone who enjoys psychological mysteries should give it a try.

* **[Sakurasou no Pet na Kanojo](http://myanimelist.net/anime/13759/Sakurasou_no_Pet_na_Kanojo)** Sakurasou is the best slice of life airing this fall season. The characters are fun, the humor is natural, the story is interesting, and the back-and-forths are the best I have ever seen. It's a story about the effect talented people have on those around them, be it crushing their spirit or inspiring them to try harder. I love it and look forward to every new episode.

* **[Shinsekai Yori](http://myanimelist.net/anime/13125/Shinsekai_yori)** From the New World is an amazing story about how a seemingly perfect world almost never is as good as it seems. Set in the far future, Shinsekai Yori is about a group of friends that discover the truths of their world and have to deal with the consequences of that knowledge. It's a wonderful show and the art (save for a few episodes) is absolutely beautiful.

* **[Zetsuen no Tempest](http://myanimelist.net/anime/14075/Zetsuen_no_Tempest)** Zetsuen is the most underrated show of the fall season in my opinion. It's an amazingly interesting story about the struggle between two sides who are fighting desperately for what they honestly believe is right. It's full of Shakespeare quotes and the main characters are even based on Hamlet and Romeo fro their respective play. The action is intense but it's the dialogue that will keep you on the edge of your seat, especially as you approach double-digit episodes. It's a truly amazing show that everyone should check out.",[Suggestion],False,self,t5_2ssl0,1358102664.0,suggest,MAL,True,t3_16h8pb,http://www.reddit.com/r/Animesuggest/comments/16h8pb/suggestion_airing_anime_winter_2013/,
1372687179.0,20,self.Animesuggest,1hfc50,"Aku no Hana: the cour is over and this show might have slipped past you. It is my favourite this season and I want to make a case for it. It is dark, awkward, cringey, unsettling and dreadful. Also absolutely brilliant and I urge you to give it a second chance.",22,2,15,http://www.reddit.com/r/Animesuggest/comments/1hfc50/aku_no_hana_the_cour_is_over_and_this_show_might/,"The show is about middle schoolers, but clearly aimed at adults. Especially adults who have gone trough really difficult puberty. This put it to the difficult spot. Fans of serious adult work skipped it because it set in school and fans of shonen stories watched first episode and did start to ridicule it, expecting another OreImo. 

I have never scoffed at characters' problems and how they are small and unimportant. Partly because they are not so for them, and partly because I felt for the characters judging everyone around them as small, tiring and conceited. It portrays teenage angst brilliantly.



The story develops slowly, relies heavily on the atmosphere in the middle of the rusty, run-down and ugly city. This is the only work that made me sit on the edge of my seat, heart beating at the sight of two middle-schoolers walking, holding hands.

The rotoscoped animation fits the tone as a glove. It is ugly, deep in uncanny valley and damn perfect. It is the source of a ridicule (Aku no Potato is the most common insult to the series) and its low success. Shame.

The anime is an adaptation of a manga, yet due to excellent atmosphere, slow pacing and experimental animation surpasses it. Oh, and music. God the music. I can't  wait for soundtrack to be released.

*So, who will like it*: People who like slowish stories and are no strangers to atmosphere-oriented work. It bears resemblance to Mamoru Oshii's works like Jin-Roh or Ghost in the Shell movies, Kotonoha no Niwa (although that used resources to make a world seem more beautiful, Aku no Hana to make it more ugly), Lars von Trier's Dogville and Antichrist, Lynch's Eraserhead and Inland Empire. As you can see, those works have little in common. There is nothing quite like Aku no Hana, I had to reach out to similar atmosphere rather than similar setting, themes or story.

*Who will not like it*: Those who find Shigneki no Kyoujin example of how anime should be made, and whose best of all time is Fullmetal Alchemist and Suzumia Haruhi no Yuutsu. 

Characters are flawed and actually behave like adolescents, so if you thought that Shinji in Neon Genesis Evangelion was just a pussy because he did not go in Rambo mode, spewing tough one liners and bravely charging at enemies you will *hate* Kasuga. Kasuga is actually a coward and that makes him an interesting character, as well as allows plot to be pushed forward.

MyAnimeList entry:  http://myanimelist.net/anime/9213/Kowarekake_no_Orgel  
  
""Kowarekake no Orgel"", or ""Half-Broken Music Box"", is a 30-minute single-episode special that was released as a fan project at Comiket in 2009, plus an additional 8-minute extra (where they really upped the production values) the following year.    
  
As far as the basic setup goes, it's quite similar to ""Chobits"", but with just half an hour to play around with, it speeds right along, before pulling hard on the heartstrings with a bittersweet ending.  In the beginning Keiichiro is simply drifting through life without purpose, but as the Summer progresses, the relentlessly-cheerful, yet thoroughly childlike draws him back to the world of the living.  Flower If you're looking for short diversion that ""hits your right in the feels"", then consider Kowarekake no Orgel.  Recommended for fans of ""Time of Eve"", but also ""Angel Beats"" and the Key/Visual Arts trilogy (Clannad, Kanon, Air).  
  
As far as I know, never licensed or released anywhere (outside of the DVD available only at Comiket).  English subtitled versions can be found online.

1374415914.0,20,self.Animesuggest,1ir0wn,Macross Frontier is an action anime about cute singers and a space fighter jet pilot confronted by aliens attacking their space colony,25,5,4,http://www.reddit.com/r/Animesuggest/comments/1ir0wn/macross_frontier_is_an_action_anime_about_cute/,"It's the year 2059, and the Macross Frontier is one of several city-size space colonies that launched from Earth on a decades-long search for other liveable planets. Ranka Lee is an aspiring singer on her way to watch a concert, and en route she meets Alto, an aspiring pilot. Alto proves to be somewhat helpful to her when hive-minded aliens attack the colony.

The series features two things prominently:

- well-animated transforming space fighter jets battling alien swarms

- catchy J-pop songs written for the series by Yoko Kanno (Cowboy Bebop, Kids on the Slope, GitS:SAC)

The songs are well integrated into the series, including the OPs and EDs, and they are sometimes used as backing for the space battles. The story revolves around Alto the aspiring pilot, a private military company that is often called to defend the colony, and Ranka the aspiring idol. Sheryl Nome, and popular idol from a nearby colony, also visits for a brief stopover on her tour and is an inspiration to Ranka.

The voice cast includes:

- Yuuichi Nakamura (Tomoya from Clannad, Kyousuke from OreImo)

- Aya Endou (episode narrator from Shinsekai Yori, Filicia from So Ra No Wo To)

- Jun Fukuyama (Yuuta from Chuunibyou, Lelouch from Code Geass)

- Hiroshi Kamiya (Otonashi from Angel Beats, Aragagi from Bakemonogatari)

Macross Frontier does not require any knowledge of the Macross universe. It's worth noting that there are two Macross Frontier films that retell the story differently, but these are inferior and can be skipped. Due to ongoing licensing complications, this series is subbed only and will likely never get an English release despite its popularity. 

I looked for some AMVs to give you a feel for the series, though it is difficult to find good ones without spoilers. Generally, I feel that it's better to go into a series without watching any scenes in advance, but [these](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wb8-G1gkxdM&amp;t=0m17s) [three](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZiU3e844cq0) [AMVs](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59R3YFrXXCw) give some indication of the visual style if you need extra motivation, though the music used in the anime is different.

High school Romance with a twist. The twist however isn't just for show. It's not a show that tacts the idea on to engage the viewer for a few quick laughs or a silly premise, it builds upon that concept and makes the former high school romance side of the story all that much better.  

The show starts a fair bit peculiarly, with the ghost introduced vying for attention from someone who can't see her, and the girl who can't see her humorously missing every detail of what happens. There's not much to say about it but it fits well the general idea, quickly establishes the rules of how the supernatural elements work and allows the watcher to understand the personality of the characters involved a little.  

That however is the start, and the show constantly pushes mystery and intrigue to the viewer, whilst building up to a main plot with scenes that may feel out of place, and are most likely done intentionally for the atmosphere and for the general lack of understanding the show wishes to impart on us; subsequently this becomes the ""fear"" or nervousness you may feel throughout the show, coupled with the absolutely [amazing](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w13s7t4HmhU) [soundtrack](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Po6kn77cKiU) and creative artwork and camera use. Several scenes with the coupling of certain camera effects and perspectives with the soundtrack can give off such a great atmosphere.  

Be prepared for heartbreak, happiness and the eerie mysterious feeling as well, the show does have great emotional weight to it. Whilst the show is not original on the general plot elements, the product is one that leaves you with a lasting impression.

I bring you...ARIA.",21,2,15,http://www.reddit.com/r/Animesuggest/comments/1idwf1/want_a_relaxed_feelgood_series_about_beautiful/,"ARIA tells the story of 15-year-old Mizunashi Akari, who is training to become a professional Undine - a gondolier tour guide - in Neo-Venezia, a recreation of Earth's Venice on Aqua (a terraformed Mars in the future). It follows her and her two other apprentice Undine friends and each of their senior mentors as they learn the tricks of their trade and explore the many wonders - big and small - their world has to offer.

ARIA has three seasons:

* [Aria the Animation](http://myanimelist.net/anime/477/Aria_the_Animation) (13 episodes)
* [Aria the Natural](http://myanimelist.net/anime/962/Aria_the_Natural) (26 episodes)
* [Aria the Origination](http://myanimelist.net/anime/3297/Aria_the_Origination) (13 episodes)

There is also an OVA, a sort of prequel to the series: [Aria the OVA: Arietta](http://myanimelist.net/anime/2563/Aria_the_OVA:_Arietta) 

I won't lie to you - this series isn't for everyone. It's very slow-paced and there isn't much drama or action to infuse the plot with adrenaline. Neo-Venezia, after all, is a true utopia. It's relaxing, heartwarming, and beautiful. You can sit back, turn off your brain for a while, and appreciate the little things in life.

What really makes the series is its cast of characters. For the most part, we follow wide-eyed idealist Akari, but she is also joined by her two friends, Aika and Alice, or her mentor, Alicia. Each of them have their own distinct personality and play off each other very well, not to mention the fact that, by the end of the third season, each of the three apprentice Undines we follow have developed and grown as characters in some way or another.

Finally, the series in general is beautiful to match its characters and setting. Neo-Venezia is a replica of Earth's Venice and the architecture drawn in this series [dutifully reflects it](http://img179.imageshack.us/img179/815/aria02.jpg) - I do believe the animators even took a trip to Venice just so they could accurately depict the city and its many gondolas. The story also finds many excuses to go exploring to find hidden gems, even places that turn into the fantastical.

Even the soundtrack is fantastic and one of the best I've heard - for example, [Mangetsu no Dolche](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Ybj6jN-Qj8).

Unfortunately, for dub-lovers out there, there is no English dub. It has been licensed and subbed by Nozomi Entertainment, but that's about it. Still, they've released the [first 2 episodes on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/show/aria), although you need an account to verify you're over 14 (I'm not sure why - there isn't really any objectionable material here). Or, [watch the official trailer here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NraaWUZxWZw).

Once you make a decision, does the universe conspire to make it happen? Is destiny a matter of chance, a matter of choice or the complex outcome of thousands of warring strands of fate? All twins Kanba and Shoma know is that when their terminally ill sister Himari collapses at the aquarium, her death is somehow temporarily reversed by the penguin hat that she had asked for. It's a provisional resurrection, however, and it comes at a price: to keep Himari alive they need to find the mysterious Penguin Drum. In order to do that, they must first find the links to a complex interlocking chain of riddles that has wrapped around their entire existence, and unravel the knots that tie them to mystifying diary and a baffling string of strangers and semi-acquaintances who all have their own secrets, agendas and ""survival strategies."" And in order for Himari to live, someone else's chosen destiny will have to change. It's a story of love, fate, life, death... and penguins!

The 1995 film is also very influential and bits of it clearly inspired Requiem for a Dream or Black Swan. Satoshi Kon was catapulted by its success on top, where he belongs.

Animation is a classic 1990's style but technically very good. I like it more than many modern ones (although less than the best modern ones). It conveys well what it is supposed to convey.

To wrap things up: a sophisticated adult thriller that will tire your brain and maybe give you nightmares.

***

**[Higurashi no Naku Koro ni](http://myanimelist.net/anime/934/Higurashi_no_Naku_Koro_ni)** and **[Higurashi no Naku Koro ni Kai](http://myanimelist.net/anime/1889/Higurashi_no_Naku_Koro_ni_Kai)**

Higurashi is a horror mystery thriller that makes you the detective. Can you piece together the seemingly random and chaotic events to figure out just *what* is going on before Kai spells it all out for you? I sure as hell couldn't.

Higurashi's first season is something a lot of people don't make it through. Whether it's the occasional graphic scenes or the apparent lack of a plot, many people drop it without realizing just what they're missing. This season is all about world building, background and mood setting, and character development. As I said above, Higurashi makes *you* the detective. When I say this I mean that it throws bits and pieces of information at you and leaves it up to you to put them together into the greater story. A piece of information you get may not be relevant to the information given directly before and after it, but chances are it fits in somewhere. As for the character development, it's top notch. You see these characters through so many different situations, and get to know them so well, that by the time Kai comes around you're pretty much able to accurately predict their actions. They really grow on you and you can't help but root for them.

Then comes Kai. Kai is all about the plot, the escalation, and the resolution. I can't say too much about it without spoiling things, but it is incredible. You'll find yourself on the edge of your seat and it'll be hard not to watch it all in one sitting.

Another great thing about Higurashi is its rewatch value. While you already know all the twists, there are little things here and there that you pick up on each time you rewatch it. You realize just how well it was actually done and how, through what you initially thought was chaos, everything ties together.

***

While I thoroughly enjoyed Higurashi while going in blind and usually recommend others do the same, if you'd like some things to consider during the first season that may help you figure out the plot a bit, then consider these questions:

1. [Mildish spoiler. Not central to the plot but will help figure out a twist prior to the reveal:](/s ""Pay attention to the eyes. When do they change? Whose eyes change at different points?"")

2. [Bigger spoiler. Will almost guarantee you will figure out the twist mentioned above before the reveal:](/s ""Who is it that is actually insane? Who is sick and who's trying to help?"") [Big tip for figuring this out. Be warned it's a decent sized spoiler:](/s ""Pay close attention to the actual content of the dialogue over the tone in which it is said."")

3. [Biggish plot spoiler. You may be able to figure out part of the plot from this question. If you can answer it before the reveal, that is:](/s ""Who is the main character? Around who are these events centered?"")

Over the decades, the water level has steadily risen to engulf the now-abandoned town.  And over the decades, an old man has built his home taller and taller, constructing a new room on top of the previous one.  Until one day, he accidentally drops his beloved pipe into the water below, and dives below to retrieve it, in the process the memories of his long life come flooding back.  
  
[La Maison en Petits Cubes](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/La_Maison_en_Petits_Cubes), or The House of Small Cubes (*Tsumiki no Ie*) is a twelve-minute animated short story by Kunio Katou, and has received multiple awards, including the Academy Award for Best Animated Short Film in 2009.  There are no words, just an old man and the bittersweet, melancholy memories of his faded past.   
  
The film is available for viewing online, including officially streaming through [Crunchyroll](http://www.crunchyroll.com/la-maison-en-petits-cubes/videos)

&gt;A dream of falling from the sky... and then birth. Rakka is born from a large cocoon into the Old Home, greeted by a group of females with small wings on their backs and shining halos above their heads. Soon Rakka’s own wings grow, a halo is placed on her head and she is told that she must work in the nearby town of Grie. She soon realizes that the town and the entire world they live in are confined behind the Wall, a tall, impenetrable wall that none except the mysterious Toga are allowed to exit.

This is a show I watched relatively recently and immensely appreciated, so I thought I would share it with you all. Haibane Renmei has a beautiful setting, earnest characters, and thoughtfully implemented symbolism throughout. Anyone who enjoyed [Welcome to the NHK](http://myanimelist.net/anime/1210/welcome_to_the_nhk!) for its mature handling of the subject matter should definitely look here for a fuller, more intelligent exploration of depressive thought.

I'm not sure how to accurately sell this for people to watch as honestly spilling any of its contents will make the ending a far bit less meaty and enjoyable.  

So I will simply talk about its start and characters. The show starts off strong and quickly establishes the two mains and a general feel for the show. I honestly fell in love with their interactions and personalities fairly quickly. If you feel even the slightest bit invested in them from the first few episodes, then this show will be a great show for you with a nice deal of emotional depth as it reaches its climax.  

The start of the show really makes it feel like a Sherlock Holmes mystery, with its locked room murder and the like, but it also shows some of the depth of the later episodes in there, and the beginning makes a quick and interesting drop into the setting of the world with its victorian streets, the maids and servants and the superstitious elites trying to do their best in keeping themselves safe.  

  
Give [Gosick](http://myanimelist.net/anime/8425/Gosick) a shot.

Well apparently you try to break their beliefs, take them out of the futon and get infuriated with them when they later refute what you say and see them crawl back into the futon.  

While the show seems to just be a joke about a girl wrapped in a futon saying she's an alien I can't help but think that the show isn't really about that, and is in fact a nod towards those who shield themselves from truth and hide away under silly beliefs that make little sense but people won't break because it might be rude or they may feel guilty for doing so.

In Sixth Place: Junk Town by Nobutaka Ito,18,4,1,http://www.reddit.com/r/Animesuggest/comments/1itdun/7_shortshorts_in_7_days_complete_anime_stories/,"While most of the focus on anime viewing is on television series and movies, there are also some short stories out there that are worth checking out. So, I decided to post suggestions of my ""Top Seven"" short-shorts over the next seven days. There are all animated stories that are **complete, stand-alone stories under fifteen minutes in length**.    
  
Yesterday, in 7th place, it was Hiroyasu Ishida's melancholy tale [Rain Town](http://www.reddit.com/r/Animesuggest/comments/1ir4b8/7_shortshorts_in_7_days_complete_anime_stories/).  
Today, in 6th place, I am featuring Nobutaka Ito's short animated tale, [Junk Town](http://anidb.net/perl-bin/animedb.pl?show=anime&amp;aid=6247).  
  
In a near-future where small robots have become commonplace, a young boy wanders the city where he comes across a small ""stray"" robot in a back alley.  But this robot only seems to be interested in one thing: eating other robots, each time growing a little bit bigger.  And it's appetite appears to be insatiable (Think: Mamimi's little robot in Furi Kuri).  And worse, it has taken a shine to the little boy.  
  
This 13-minute short story is [Nobutaka Ito's](http://www.imdb.com/name/nm1118475/) directorial debut, although he has worked as a key animator/animation director on a number of anime over the years (Wolf's Children, Kemonodzume, Mind Game, Steamboy, Ghost in the Shell: Innocence, etc).  The short story was produced by the innovative [Studio 4°C](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Studio_4%C2%B0C), as part of their direct-to-DVD compilation [Sweat Punch](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sweat_Punch).  In [Sweat Punch](http://myanimelist.net/anime/1072/Sweat_Punch), four short animated tales were released as part of a ""DVD magazine"", and then when they were compiled together into another release called Deep Imagination, this fifth story was added.  (Side note: Also worth checking out as an honorable mention is the third tale in the series, the artsy [Comedy](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comedy_%28anime%29) (Kigeki), by Kazuto Nakazawa (Kill Bill, Paradise Dolls, Animatrix, Samurai Champloo).)  
  
Online review with screenshots: http://bignanime.wordpress.com/2009/04/16/studio-4cs-junk-town/.  To the best of my knowledge, none of the shorts from the Sweat Drop/Deep Imagination compilation have been been licensed and been made available through official channels outside Japan.  Yet.  However, subtitled videos can be found by searching online.  
  
Stay tuned to see what may pop up in fifth place tomorrow!

1373806262.0,13,self.Animesuggest,1i9uz1,[Suggestion] A large list of romance anime I've enjoyed. Ranging from your normal romance to shoujo-ai/yuro to ecchi/harem/ect,15,2,11,http://www.reddit.com/r/Animesuggest/comments/1i9uz1/suggestion_a_large_list_of_romance_anime_ive/,"I see a lot of requests on here from people looking for new romance anime to watch, so I figured I'd post a list of some of the ones I enjoyed watching. A few of these are more subtle when it comes to the romance elements, but the majority have romance as the main focus of the show.

I'll separate the list into three categories. 

The first is just your normal romance, boy/girl ect.

The second is what's known as shoujo-ai/yuri. I don't know if you're familiar with it, but it's essentialy ""girls love"" or girl x girl, rather than your standard boy x girl. This might be off putting for some people, but I'd say don't knock it till you try it. It's my favorite form of romance and my favorite genre by a mile. The relationships just seem more sincere and intimate to me and more emotional in comparison to the normal boy x girl. It's not for everyone though I suppose.

The third is your ecchi/harem/ect type romances. I know not everyone likes these shows, so I'll separate them from the ""normal"" romance anime.

Samurai Champloo: All style and little substance; I tried several times to watch it but always stopped it several episodes in.

Planetes: Good show with great characters, though a couple of the episodes were cheesy (e.g. the ninja wannabes)

Death Note: Great show

Thursday, in 3rd place it's the short-short [Fumiko's Confession](http://www.reddit.com/r/Animesuggest/comments/1j2ei2/7_shortshorts_in_7_days_complete_anime_stories/) by Hiroyasu Ishida.  
Friday, in 2nd place it's the Academy Award winning [La Maison en Petits Cubes](http://www.reddit.com/r/Animesuggest/comments/1j4v9f/7_shortshorts_in_7_days_complete_anime_stories/).  
And finally today in first place (cue the trumpets) is the uplifting tale, **Out of Sight**.  
  
While walking through the town with her seeing-eye dog, a young girl is suddenly robbed of her bag. The dog gives chase, leaving the girl all alone. But with the help of a stick she finds, which “transforms” into a magical wand, she explores the street, ""seeing"" the world through her other senses, exploring a grand world by touch, by sound, and by smell.    
  
[Out of Sight](http://matthigh.wordpress.com/2011/10/07/anime-review-out-of-sight/) is a five-minute animated short produced as a graduation project by three students at the National Taiwan University of Arts.  Words like heartwarming, joyous, uplifting, inspirational -- they all apply, even though the story is conveyed without the need of any words at all.  It's just a reminder that we can 'see the world' with more than just our eyes, and a little girl's imagination can truly be a powerful thing.

A weary traveler enters the big city, where he is enticed by a food stall run by a determined, young Chinese girl.  But he also attracts the attention of another food vendor, a voluptuous Western woman.  And before you know it, it's an all-out food fight!  
  
This eight-minute, fast-paced comedy animated short was produced by [Wolf Smoke Studio](http://www.rpoani.com/eng/?p=219) from China.  Does that mean it qualifies as ""anime""?  Personally, I take a bit of a broader view, and I'm happy to watch anime from Japan, Korea, China, or anywhere else in Asia for that matter.  You can quibble over the exact definition of anime if you want (or not), but this is still worth watching regardless of the origin.  Very fun, interesting style, well-animated -- there's no deep story or meaning, just a silly little food/kung-fu fight between two women with a hapless traveler stuck in the middle.  And the amount of ""jiggle-factor"" on the western woman is *hilariously overdone*, playing into the joke of the story itself.

There are all animated stories that are **complete, stand-alone stories under fifteen minutes in length**.    
  
Today, to start the ball rolling, I start out in 7th Place with a ten-minute story titled [""Rain Town""](http://myanimelist.net/anime/10448/Rain_Town) by Hiroyasu Ishida.    
  
It's a wordless tale, set in a downtrodden city where the rain never ends.  A small, young girl goes out into the empty streets to play, and meets a robot left unmoving, sitting on a bench.  After some prodding, the robot awakens, and is reminded of another young girl from earlier, brighter, happier days...   
  
This was Hiroyasu Ishida's award-winning ""graduation film"" for Kyoto Seika University, and he spent two years working on it.  Rain Town is not meant to showcase a complex story, but more to evoke a down-tempo mood of memories past and dreams forgotten.  The attention to detail, despite the largely monochrome backgrounds, is impressive.

*Bakemontegori (I've watched Nisenmontegori as well) love them very much.  Tho i did have to watch them a few times to get the ACTUAL jist of most of whats going on.
*Durarara!!  Enjoyed it very much

*SAO [sao](/s I've enjoyed the random feels but the story is a bit lacking a LOT."")

*Guilty Crown [GC](/s ""Same as SaO loved the random feels not a HUGE fan of the ending I'd like to see the main characters together happily like SAO"")

*Black Lagoon

*Neon Gensis (some of the movies)

*Ghost in the shell series

*Gurren Lagaan very much win.

*Cowboy BeBop love it

*Hellsing
*Birdy the mighty was neat!

*H.O.D.

*Fate/zero Fate/stay~night I enjoyed them tho [fate](/s ""S/N emiya annoyed the crap out of me at times with his over the top emotional derp and overwhelming sense of right"")

*D-grey Man (just finished it 52ep up to 103) [Dgrey](/s ""It was obnoxious at times but i've enjoyed it."")
I've watched a lot of the more ""main stream"" animes/cartoons naruto/bleach/one Piece kinda meh.

I dont mind Ecchi tho I don't care for OVER THE TOP fan service like Kiss x sis or something like that.  I liked the story of Sekirei and that was borderline over the top for me lol.

I've got on the ""to watch list""

*Toradora!

*Highschool DxD

*Steins gate (Although the description doesn't appeal to me i've seen many people recommend it so i may power thru till i get into it hopefully.)

*Shuffle


I do seem to gravitate a bit more towards romance type shows, that aren't over the top campy, A sci-fi element like guilty crown is always a plus with GOOD (recent) animation. After watching ones like [like](/s ""GC i'd love to actually see the two main characters actually get/stay together instead of separated thru tragic events for ONCE."")

I'm just running out of anime that I know of, i've been reading all the posts on here that people have suggested which is how i've found most the stuff i've watched recently but i'm just running out of ideas.  I've watched a bit more anime but i don't want to list EVERYTHING i've seen lol.

I'm looking for an action/adventure anime with romance. I'm more interested in anime that have nice animation/art style and music more than the storyline. **NOT INTERESTED IN MECHA**. Also, only interested in anime that don't have like 100+ episodes like bleach/one piece.

**So far I've watched AND enjoyed**

**Guilty Crown** -&gt; Despite the circlejerk hate on it, I really enjoyed it and the OST was amazing. Even though Inori had 0 character development, she's still one of my favourite characters because she was drawn well and shes a ""cute"" character.

**Mirai Nikki** -&gt; REALLY good, just finished it yesterday. Yuno is a cute character 

**Sword Art Online** -&gt; Also really good, look forward to it every saturday

**Fate/Zero** -&gt; I enjoyed it, but since it didn't have much romance. I didn't ""miss"" it as much as the other anime that I have watched

**Anime that I dropped/will not watch**

**Accel World** -&gt; Watched first season. Couldn't get passed the fact that the anime was COMPLETELY cheesy and the main character was drawn so weird (if hes a socially awkward boy, then why draw him as a 3 foot fat midget?). Just was not enjoyable, watched first season assuming it would get better

**Code Geass** -&gt; I don't like how the main character (the guy in the mask) is drawn, and art style really matters to me in terms of naturally liking the anime. Also don't want it to ruin my love for Guilty Crown

**Anime that I MIGHT watch based on recommendations**

**Elfen Lied** -&gt; Watched 1st episode a LONG time ago, but the gore/brutality steered me away. I might pick it up again because people have been saying that its toned down after the first episode

**Another** -&gt; I heard it had no romance and I watched about 10 mins of the first episodes. Was extremely creeped out by the dolls and shit, didnt really ""catch me in""

**Eden of the East**

**Deadman Wonderland**

**Angel Beats** -&gt; Trying this one tonight because I just dropped Accel world.

Please give us your input!,13,0,6,http://www.reddit.com/r/Animesuggest/comments/zxokh/a_different_kind_of_request_some_feedback_for_the/,"**Firstly**, recently I received a request to change some of the kana back to English on this page. Here was my rationale:

&gt;I myself don't read Japanese, but I thought that using the Japanese characters for ""up"" and ""down"" rather than the traditional arrows would be a nice touch, so I consulted a Japanophone friend. The sticky note just says ""announcement"" in Japanese letters, as does the subscribe/unsubscribe button (likewise for dashboard + shortcut for [RES](http://redditenhancementsuite.com) users). The header at the top spells out Reddit in Japanese letters.

&gt;It wasn't my intention to offend people who don't know the language; like I said, I myself don't have any real knowledge of it. I do, however, recognize that people who watch anime have a higher interest in the language than the general population, and have inserted a few things with which they could perhaps practice. Have I gone slightly overboard?

What do you guys think?

**Secondly**, I think some of the design looks a bit dated, particularly the header. Is anyone in here good with drawing/Photoshop and willing to lend their talent? If not, does anyone have any ideas for a cute anime-related header?

**Thirdly**, I have at last changed the link colors for suggestions, so *don't forget to include the tags in your submissions!*

What do you all think about the colors I used for the links? What do you think about the color scheme in general of the subreddit?

**Finally**, thank you to all the frequent users of this subreddit; without you, /r/animesuggest would be lifeless! If I knew any Python, I would totally write up a bot to reward the frequent posters... alas, I do not. Anyone here know whether this would be relatively easy for a skilled programmer to do?

**Thanks in advance for your input, everyone!**

As unappealing as it might seem on first sight, do not judge a book by its cover. 

This Anime is similar to Fate/Zero in ways that the characters interact with each other in order to do ""good"" but each individual performs ""good"" in a different way. If you are looking for an anime that will give you a hell of a ride then buckle up your seat belts because I can personally guarantee that you will get constantly excited. If I had to name one thing that this anime does really well, then I would say that it would be the continuos thrill and excitement that this anime gives you.

From this anime I learnt that the the faintest star can light up the night sky. No matter how an anime looks, every single anime has the potential to deliver an exemplary story.

Synopsis (from MAL):
&gt; It is now possible to store memory data, so that the death of your body is not actually ""death"". As memories are stored in databanks, they can be ""transferred"" to new bodies. Because so-called ""memory trading"" now occurs, it is now possible to steal memories and illegally alter them.

&gt;Society has fallen apart as authority has become lost and stagnant.

&gt;One day, a man awakens in a ruined room. His name is Kaiba. He has no memories, but he does have a pendant with a picture of an unknown woman inside.

&gt;In the skies are roiling clouds and electrical storms, impossible to pass without losing one's memories; above them lies the elusive realm of the rich and powerful, who barter others' bodies and memories for their own enjoyment and longevity. Below lies a troubled and dangerous world where good bodies are hard to come by and real money is scarce.

&gt;After suddenly being attacked, Kaiba escapes into space, and during his travels meets all sorts of people and regains his memories. Throughout it, he continues to be troubled by the world's problems, as well as his own existence. And what of the woman in the pendant, Neiro?


Kaiba is a truly unique work of art.  It's experimental through and through and tackles an area of anime that we don't see very often.  Very ponderous and thoughtful in nature, Kaiba attempts to explore themes of existence, sorrow and individualism and it does them very well.

The first thing about Kaiba that stands out is the [odd art style](http://thenullset.files.wordpress.com/2008/05/editkaiba31054.jpg?w=600). The art is devoid of any real textures or depth and feels very retro.  It captures a style very reminiscent to that of Osamu Tezuka.  While it seems childish and lazy at first, one should be [very careful not to be hasty in their judgments.](http://imageshack.us/a/img207/8104/bookuw8.jpg)  The animation is definitely one of the strongest points the show has going for it, the almost constant use of motion and vibrant colors combined with the music add a very wondrous atmosphere to the show that I simply could not get enough of.

The show is very much hard sci-fi and thus should not be picked up by those who do not have the patience to stick through the bizarre art or are more into lighthearted and simple shows.

We're both big thinkers and not fans of mindless violence... but violence is still pretty cool.

I don't want to watch an ecchi with my dad, so anything that focuses heavily on boobs and pantyshots (again, HotD) is a big no. He's a fan of very crass, Western humor, and I don't mind watching South Park with him, but I'd rather have something actiony than something comedic.

I'd honestly suggest something for him to watch, but I have a very limited experience with anime. I've really liked Axis Powers Hetalia, Soul Eater, and what I've read of JoJo's Bizarre Adventure.

*[Dororon Enma-kun Meeramera](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9XL35b9OjI)* - 9/10
 
Meeramera isn't really a show for everyone, hell it'd be hard to recommend it to most anime fans, but it's gold for [Go Nagai](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Go_Nagai) fans. Each episode loosely adapts a chapter from the 1973 manga, Dororon Enma-kun, while also throwing in tons or references to 1970s, Japanese pop culture and other Go Nagai and Dynamic Pro works, such as [Mazinger Z](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SyRoF689VRE), [Devilman](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTVj-4uiOt4) and [Getter Robo](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nhjds5BtY68).
 
Meeramera's story is pretty typical. The head of Hell, Enma the Great, sends his nephew, Prince Enma, along with his two friends, Princess Yukiko and Kapaeru, to unleash judgment on mischievous demons living in the human world. The story isn't really what makes Meeramera great, though it does have its moments; it's the series’ sense of humor that makes it worthwhile.
 
The series' humor is outlandish and adheres to the tone of Uncle Go's original work. To give an example of just how outlandish Meeramera's humor is, there is an episode where the Demon Patrol fight a demon named Fatty the Kid that becomes enraged when he sees skinny people. He then proceeds to transform the entire human population into globular masses with a huge case of the munchies. And in doing so, he brings about world peace, but Enma destroys him anyway and reverts everyone back to their old selves.

Aside from that, the show is also pretty perverted. It was made to appeal to people that grew up in the early 70s and watched, or read the original Dororon Enma-kun. It's definitely not for kids.

In Third Place: Fumiko's Confession by Hiroyasu Ishida (only 2 minutes long!),13,3,1,http://www.reddit.com/r/Animesuggest/comments/1j2ei2/7_shortshorts_in_7_days_complete_anime_stories/,"While most of the focus on anime viewing is on television series and movies, there are also some short stories out there that are worth checking out. So, I decided to post suggestions of my ""Top Seven"" short-shorts over the next seven days. There are all animated stories that are **complete, stand-alone stories under fifteen minutes in length**.  
  
Sunday, in 7th place, it was Hiroyasu Ishida's melancholy tale [Rain Town](http://www.reddit.com/r/Animesuggest/comments/1ir4b8/7_shortshorts_in_7_days_complete_anime_stories/).  
Monday, in 6th place, it was Nobutaka Ito's short animated tale [Junk Town](http://www.reddit.com/r/Animesuggest/comments/1itdun/7_shortshorts_in_7_days_complete_anime_stories/).  
Tuesday, in 5th place, it's Tatsuyuki Tanaka's gritty, dystopian tale [Toujin Kit](http://www.reddit.com/r/Animesuggest/comments/1ixcia/7_shortshorts_in_7_days_complete_anime_stories/).  
Wednesday, in 4th place it's the humorous short [Kung Fu Cooking Girls](http://www.reddit.com/r/Animesuggest/comments/1izvhk/7_shortshorts_in_7_days_complete_anime_stories/).    
Today in 3rd place, it's the short-short **Fumiko's Confession** by Hiroyasu Ishida.  
  
Poor little Fumiko -- as soon as she musters up the courage to confess to her crush, she immediately gets rejected in favor of...baseball.  Stupid Takashi!  But as Fumiko goes running off in frustration and dejection, things get...a little out of control.  
  
Clocking in at just over two minutes in length, [Fumiko's Confession](http://myanimelist.net/anime/8187/Fumiko_no_Kokuhaku) is barely just a snippet of a story.  It's simply a little bit of animated fun as Fumiko goes careening out of control down the mountainside, the town rushing past in a hurried menagerie of shapes and colors.    
  
What makes this so interesting is that it was entirely produced by *one person* -- a 21-year-old college student, Hiroyasu Ishida.  After winning an award for this animated short, he went on to produce another short story for his graduation project: [Rain Town](http://www.reddit.com/r/Animesuggest/comments/1ir4b8/7_shortshorts_in_7_days_complete_anime_stories/).    
  
No need to over-analyze this one -- at two minutes long you've probably spent more time reading this description.  The creator has made it available for viewing online.  See it [on Youtube](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=17Wnf7DsQng).

1346209637.0,13,self.Animesuggest,z00ig,"[Request] Anime with well-written adult characters, believable character interactions, and a cohesive, engaging plot.",13,0,85,http://www.reddit.com/r/Animesuggest/comments/z00ig/request_anime_with_wellwritten_adult_characters/,"Hey Animesuggest,
My request is pretty straightforward, based on what I've written in the title. Let me first tell you the anime I have watched, with a rating I'll assign (out of 10)
FMA:B 9.2/10
Steins;Gate (9.1/10)
A:TLA (9.1/10) It's not anime, I know, but it shows my taste.
Cowboy Bebop (8.8/10)
Samurai Champloo (7.7/10)
Baccano! (6.8/10)

What I'm looking for is an adult-aimed anime. No cutesy high school slice-of-life with no greater point. I don't mind slice-of-life if there's a greater plot going on (think S;G first 11 episodes).

I want something heavy on character development, with believable character action and interaction. If characters lack true arcs (they don't develop from the start to the end in a meaningful way), then as long as their relationships develop naturally, I'm ok. Furthermore, I like stuff heavy in themes. This is prevalent in FMA:B and A:TLA moreso than the other ones. It's not a requirement, but thinking critically about what I've just watched is nice.
Another thing is, I want the characters to look (animation-style) adult. 

The second big thing I'm looking for a cohesive plot. The plot shouldn't get in the way of the characters (this is why I didn't enjoy Baccano as much as the others; didn't care for anyone besides Isaac/Miria), but I like something cohesive that lacks plot holes, deus ex machinas, and Chekhov's guns. It can be complicated like FMA:B, or simple like Champloo, or somewhere in the middle. But I want it to be 'smart.' This is one big reason why I adore S;G. The plot is very, very clean, but it never gets in the way of the characters.  In fact, the plot is generally a medium through which character interaction occurs. 

So yeah, that's what I want. Beyond that, I thought I'd mention that I don't really like when a character gets power boosts and stuff to defeat the villain. Think Pokemon/Digimon/Naruto, etc., where you train to get stronger. I personally am not a big fan of that.

So yeah, please recommend me good stuff. Oh yeah, I'm going to be watching Clannad as we speak.

Edit: I thought I would add a little background about myself. I literally started watching anime late July. I'm just 18, so when I speak of how I want 'adult' and 'mature' anime, it's not that you need to appeal to some old guy. It's more that I'm not exactly a fan of 'anime' as a medium of art (I'm indifferent towards it), but I acknowledge there are some good/great shows (and the fact that it's anime really stretches the limits for what's possible) that are anime. That's why I'm looking for 'adult' shows, because I imagine Moe/cutesy stuff to appeal to people who like anime for the sake of it being anime.

Kotoura-San is for you!,15,3,6,http://www.reddit.com/r/Animesuggest/comments/1jzutp/want_a_great_tragicromance_that_only_lasts_4/,"Very few anime in this world know how to have a good beginning.  Some anime, like Attack on Titan, do it well.  Others, like Fullmetal Alchemist or Sword Art Online, do it incredibly.  But one show, one anime that advertised itself as a typical slice of life, did it beautifully.  One series made it a point to have what I consider to be the best beginning in all of anime: **Kotoura-San**.

Kotoura-San is an anime about a girl named Kotoura, who has the ability to read minds against her will.  And, well, that's all I'm telling you, since the show itself takes pride in making the viewers think it's a typical slice of life show.  The male lead isn't stupid, he's witty and makes the first move.  The female lead, Kotoura, isn't a hidden otaku or just average or nosebleeds at the sight of a shirtless boy; She is somebody who has the ability to read minds and has, at some points, used it for her own advantage.

**But wait, JonTheBon, isn't Kotoura-San a twelve episode series?  Why are you suggesting only four?**  The first four episodes are the best ones of the series and really the only reason to watch the show.  The rest, minus the last episode, is poor and predictable.  The beginning, however, is full of betrayal, twists and turns, and boasts a male lead so in touch with reality that he makes Araragi look like a boy who couldn't get in the robot.  The last episode is really only there if you want to tie up the loose ends the first four episodes created, but it's not mandatory watching by any means.

I really do think everybody should watch the first four episodes of this series (and optionally episode 12) if they are even remotely interested in a tragic romance, because this beginning should have been turned into a movie with how well paced it is. 

If you have any questions, ask me here and I'm more than happy to answer.

Some examples of what I have really enjoyed previously, and would consider to be in the vein of what I am talking about:

-Darker than Black

-Ghost in the Shell

-Baccano!

-Neon Genesis Evangelion

(possibly Elfen Lied, but.... that show's pretty fucked up. Still good though)



Anime that I enjoyed, but would not consider in this vein:

-Cowboy Bebop

-Trigun (I just recently finished watching Trigun, and found the more sci-fi atmospheric part seen in the later episodes INCREDIBLE. Feel free to also rec anything like this)

-Full Metal Alchemist

-Code Geass



And finally, for an example of what I do NOT want, is Kaze No Stigma. I watched it, and found it *okay*, but hated the lack of realistic violence. I want blood, gore, and death dammit!

Currently, I have started watching Texhnolyze, as it seems to be similar to what I'm looking. *EDIT* Also, I've watched a bit of Gantz, although I'm no so sure if I'll finish it. It took so fucking long for the first 'battle' to end.

1374112311.0,11,self.Animesuggest,1ij2yb,"[Suggestion]Naru Taru, a not so well-known psychological mystery drama.",12,1,5,http://www.reddit.com/r/Animesuggest/comments/1ij2yb/suggestionnaru_taru_a_not_so_wellknown/,"[Naru Taru]( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SIF5BLyh3Mk) was one of my first anime and the very first manga I read. And still after 8 years of watching anime, this one left one of the biggest impressions, so I decided to write this recommendation.  


The opening and the fact that this show was aired at “Kids Station” is the biggest deceive in anime history. The first episode suggests an easy to watch kid’s anime with some supernatural creatures like Pokemon. BUT this series is totally not for children. After 2-3 episodes the main focus changes from happy slice of life to despair, bullying, despair, suicide and despair.  




  Plot:   
The main character, a 12 year old girl named Shiina, went to her grandparents for vacation. There she meets a supernatural creature. The creature, which she names Hoshimaru, can fly and change its appearance. After returning home she realizes that there are many other kids who met creatures like Hoshimaru. 




Who should watch this?  
If you like shows such as Bokurano, Elfen Lied or Higurashi you might also like Naru Taru. Or simply, shows with the main focus on psychological pressure and good characters. I also highly recommend the manga to all who liked the anime because the anime only covers 50% of the story. Knowing the manga you will understand why the second half never made it into an anime.  


Don’t watch this show if you don’t like depressing anime with horrible things and various brutal deaths happening especially to minors.

Also please no tragic ending, if mid way through someone unimportant dies its fine with me but please no main character deaths (Also no clanned, loved that show but i can't even say the name without crying)

Enough gushing over animation and looks and style however. The show obviously has top notch action and this is where it shines. It also hints  at certain ideas, but ultimately it is up to the viewer whether they succeeded in showing these and mentioning them would ruin a part of the plot itself.    

The split between the two worlds will keep you wondering what it means and more, and if your like me you'll be throwing ideas or theories as to what it is until it is revealed, the meaning of the world how it relates to whats happening in the real world why has this just caused that, what is this. All these questions pile on and for someone who loves to figure stuff out its quite the ride piecing it together. 

Overall it is interesting and can be somewhat eerie, whether the story is good or not is up to you but I can guarantee on the stellar style and feel of the show.  

Give it a shot, I'd say to give it 2-3 episodes. As that should give you enough of an idea to judge it on your tastes.

When I first looked at Cross Game I thought: baseball, meh. I really didn't want to watch an anime about baseball. But I ended up giving it a try, and I'm glad I did. It's essentially a slice of life highschool story. Baseball played a big part in the story, but in a way that it didn't feel like baseball itself was a focus. Baseball was a Vehicle that allowed the characters to grow. It could've been another sport, or a club, or something else entirely and I think you could have essentially the same story.


Cross game is character centric. You're not going to have giant conspiracies, secret plots, aliens from space, etc.... The plot isn't full of twists and unseen turns. You watch Cross Game for the Characters. They might not be extremely complex, but I didn't ever feel as if the characters weren't compelling enough to continue to the story. I would say the character development was slow (as there are 50 episodes) but it never really *felt* that way watching it. I always wanted to go right into the next episode. 


I'd recommend this to you if you're a fan of animes like Toradora, Chu-2, or any of the highschool romcoms. Also to fans of Nodame Cantabile if you are okay with the highschool setting. I feel like it really has a more mature feel than most highschool animes I've seen. It's hard to put into words but it's just not quite as silly. It feels much more believable and down to earth. I think the best way to put it, is it doesn't feel awkward, as so often highschool animes do. There isn't a whole lot of romance in cross game, and when it's there its subtle. But it is there (more so towards the end) and it has a very nice sweet ending.


Oh, did I mention the first episode is bar-none the **best** first episode of an anime I've seen? It'll hook you in, then won't let you go. Give a shot, and hopefully it'll be a Home Run!

 - Watched this anime in 1999, but it may have been a re-run from a lot of time ago.
 - Female protagonist wearing a red dress (like, it was her dress when she ""transformed"" into a magical girl), I think she was about 14 years old.
 - Antagonist was a guy that really didn't hate her for some reason, I kind remember he wasn't really evil
 - One episode ended that the antagonist got sick, maybe a flu. The protagonist was worried about him. If I try to remember as hard as I can, I may be inventing memories in here, I think the antagonist was in the protagonist arms when he fell sick ([classic pose](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/1f/Michelangelo%27s_Pieta_5450_cropncleaned_edit.jpg)), in the roof of a building.
 - Pushing it even harder, the complexion of both the protagonist and antagonist were [like the younger characters in Card Captor Sakura](http://www.animeultima.tv/uploads/anime_photo/watch-cardcaptor-sakura-episodes-online-english-sub-thumbnailpic.jpg)


I've tried to find it since many years ago, and the closest thing I've found (also from checking the channel's anime series shown), it could be Magic Knight Rayearth, so if anyone here has seen the show (I haven't had the time to watch it D= ), please tell me if it really could be this series.

**UPDATE**: It seems it could have been Case Closed, and maybe I mixed the antagonist and the protagonist, maybe the protagonist was the kid, and the antagonist was the girl with the red dress. Looking for more info.

**UPDATE 2**: Just found more info, and now the candidates are:

 - An episode of Case Closed
 - Saint Tail
 - Oyayubi Hime
 - Mahotsukai Sally

Saint tail activates my spider sense, and that would mean I mixed the red dress by her black dress, so I'll see what else I can find.

There was a halfway decent series that came out in the 2000s called Blue Gender, but the episodes were hit or miss, especially with the whiny and ineffectual protagonist.  There was also a halfway decent mecha series that tried to be realistic, but had some really freaking weird Noh scenes intermixed. Why do the Japanese animators do that?  If it had been a straight forward military combat series it would have been great.  Thanks for the suggestions.

(EDIT 1) I went to the MyAnimeList.net website, searched for MD Geist and got these two recommendations which look familiar, but I don't really remember them after all these years:

* [Genocyber](http://myanimelist.net/anime/2775/Genocyber)
* [Biohunter](http://myanimelist.net/anime/1269/Biohunter)

Recommendations by other users are:

* Black Lagoon
* Berserk
* Kara no Kyoukai
* Hellsing
* Elfen Lied
* Another

I was surprised it didn't have any mentions here, specially after the recent Curiosity rover landing on mars.

This is a more realistic anime (seinen) and really reminds me of ""Initial D"" style.

I'm currently watching it and despite having almost no cliff hangers, I simply can't stop and this is why I'm already recommending it. At this stage even if the ending is a disaster (which I don't know), it won't matter, it will still be one of my favorite animes.

Remember this is a Seinen slice of life kind of anime, which means boring/ugly to many folks and not really targeted at younger audiences as it relies heavily on storyline and character development.

I just finished my third series, Deathnote (Went from FLCL to Cowboy Bebop to that). I'm looking for another anime that has moments that really hit you emotionally. Some CB and DN spoilers to show what I'm really looking for.

Deathnote spoilers

[In Deathnote, I was hit REALLY hard when L died. I've truly never been so depressed over a death as that one. I'm still kinda affected by it, honestly. That was really powerful.](/spoiler)

[Deathnote's ending was also really powerful. From Light's breakdown to him getting shot up, running away, all the way up to Ryuk's monologue at the end, while writing his name in the deathnote. While I was glad to see Light finally get what was coming, it was still a really powerful ending that's hard to shake off.](/spoiler)

Cowboy Bebop spoilers

[As for Cowboy Bebop, of course I'm going to talk about the end. Spike in the last two episodes really got me. Bang.](/spoiler)

That sorta stuff is what I'm looking for. [I'm not looking exclusively for death, despite the examples I gave. Just stuff that really hits you emotionally. I mean, it was more Light's demise rather than his actual death that hit me. Oh, and definitely don't tell me if people die in the series you recommend!](/spoiler)

Right now, off Wikipedia-summaries alone, I chose ""Welcome to the NHK"", ""Stein;Gate"", and ""Evangelion"". Would any of these give me what I'm looking for? Are they worth watching?

* You and Me
* Shin Sekai Yori
* Death Note
* Erin (very boring at the end)
* Naruto (I don't exactly *like* Naruto, as I find it too repetitive and slow, but I watch it)

X-post /R/Anime.,10,2,5,http://www.reddit.com/r/Animesuggest/comments/1gq34d/can_someone_help_me_with_the_titles_of_this_anime/,"I Was told that to post this over here and maybe we could figure out what the second anime was because we are having a hard time figuring it out over at /r/anime. Here is a [link to my original post](http://www.reddit.com/r/anime/comments/1glpk0/can_someone_help_me_with_the_titles_of_this_anime/) I did copy and paste the body of my text to here for you also.



I watched an anime back when I was in High School, it may have been early college. I am twenty-five now and for the life of me I can not remember the name of this anime at all, so this is where you come in. I am going to describe it, or what I remember of it and hopefully we can come up with the title!

First off: This one is a Romance, it was about a girl and a guy. This guy was suppose to meet the girl at a (bus stop/train station maybe) He ends up being late for some reason and she was hit by a car and put in the hospital. I think she went into a coma and the guy ends up dating her best friend and stopped visiting in the hospital. She then wakes up and thinks that they are still dating, he plays a long for a long while but then it finally comes out ? It is really foggy, I am sorry if my details are messed up here, its been a great long time since I have watched it. If anyone could help letting me know the name of this it would be wonderful! I am not really sure if it was subbed or dubbed, I do know it was a short series maybe 13, 24, 26 episodes long. 

I had another that I could not quite remember the name of but it eludes me on how the story even went, that is how long ago that I watched these two anime's.  All I remember is it was a similar situation girl likes boy but dating another girl, they are friends though. They also went to college or school together, I remember a scene from it: They were all sitting in a restaurant eating soup maybe? Sorry, Like I said I could just be making the first anime into two different ones, but I am pretty sure that I am not, its just been years and I just cant remember at all. 

Would there be a way to search for something like this ? I think both were romance. Thank you for all the help that people provide. I also can answer questions if need be, but remember its been years.  

**Edit: First one is Kimi ga Nozomu Eien - Thank you Silverhydra and Randomize17**

**Edit 2: UPDATE** I have been trying to think about the second Anime and have pretty much given up on trying to remember it. I think I am coming back with some information or maybe I am just blending things all together with the first one. Here is some more info: 

Setting was in College or in High School, it progressed on to after college and when they had a real job. The plot line followed a guy and he liked this girl, they were really close friends I think. He was dating another girl at the time and she was dating another guy, that was the scene in the shop of them eating soup/dinner together. I think they end up getting together/ maybe they don't. I they guy having a very important phone conversation outside in the rain/sunshine on a cellphone or phone booth. They highlighted this conversation because it was very important information on one of the parties sides. It was a serious art style and all like present day, nothing futuristic and abnormal at all. 

I am trying to provide as much information as possible. Also anything from 2010-2013 will not be it. Also the series was shorter 13-24 and its completed. 

**Edit 3:** Some of its coming back to me. Guy likes the girl but never could get the courage to ask her out maybe ? Then they were dating other people and went out for dinner together or lunch together. The second Anime was a  drama relationship anime, it was serious too. I don't remember laughing to much at all during it. It was emotional also.

Sasami-san@Ganbaranai is for you!,13,5,6,http://www.reddit.com/r/Animesuggest/comments/1a2eni/want_a_combination_of_steinsgate_and/,"[Before you read the thread, watch this and get hyped for what you're about to experience!] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rFXT6DVGpJw)  My favorite part starts ~1:20.  Don't worry about spoilers, there are no English subs in this video and the dialog is the only part important to the story.

**What is this thread about?**

Hello there!  Everybody has their favorite genre of anime.  Some prefer action, others mecha.  Me?  I like psychological anime.  The purpose of a psychological anime is to purposefully confuse the viewer in an attempt to create a ""wow"" moment when the answers are revealed later.   Higurashi no Naku Koro Ni is the obvious example, but it also stretches into other anime like Another, Mirai Nikki, and even Baccano in some cases.

For a long while now on /r/animesuggest, people have been asking for a good psychological anime.  However, that's a bit tricky to suggest towards.  On one hand, you can always say Higurashi or Mirai Nikki, but part of the experience of watching psychological anime is that you give yourself space in between each episode to build suspense.  Those who actually watched Steins;Gate while it was airing know this kind of excitement.  Rarely do I get the chance to suggest a good psychological anime while it is airing, but Sasami-san@Ganbaranai has given me that opportunity, and I'm here to suggest it to you.

**What is Sasami-san@Ganbaranai?**

Sasami-San is a psychological anime produced by SHAFT, which should sound familiar because, for those of you who don't know, they also produced Madoka Magica and the Bakemonogatari series.  It follows the life of Sasami-San (get it?  Her name is half the title!) and her brother as they fight to not only protect themselves but others in a battle against their own powers.  It has fan-service in the first few episodes, but it's almost entirely dropped about five or six episodes into the series.

Did that sound vague?  It should be, it's part of the experience!  Like I said earlier, this anime forces you to ask questions.  It's entire purpose the first four episodes is to try to WTF your mind before they get to the meat of the story in episodes 5+.  However, people sadly get the wrong idea from the anime, dismissing it as being just filler space until better anime airs since they give it up before it gets good, but you have the chance to break that chain of ignorance!

For those of you who weren't around at the time, Steins;Gate was pretty unpopular for its first 12 episodes because, like Sasami-San, people dismissed it before it had the chance to reach its climax.  Higurashi and Mirai Nikki didn't suffer from this as much since they showed their action ASAP and made the confusion happen in the middle/late end of the series.

**Isn't Sasami-san@Ganbaranai still airing?**

Yes it is, it's currently on episode 8 and planned for 13 or 14.  I'm suggesting this to you now (and even had permission from the mods to do so) because I want you to experience a psychological anime while it is airing to truly appreciate the genre.  Like fine wine, the longer you wait, the better it tastes.

**TL;DR:**  Combine some of the fanservice/supernatural of Nisemonogatari with the story-telling of Steins;Gate and you come up with a beautiful creature known as Sasami-San.  Great music, drop-dead gorgeous, and has deep Japanese mythology.

* I can't stand breaks of in universe realism. This means the show should meticulously adhere to the rules of the universe it is set in, and not drive someone with attention to detail mad. Also, if characters almost intentionally make stupid choices when there is an easy way out of a scenario I will throw things at the screen.

* I do not like predictable stories. Good should not always win, the universe is about balance, not good triumphing. If the guy gets the girl and the universe gets saved with a huge explosion, it is not for me.

* I like drama with action included not nonstop action. I like action that is preceded by anticipation first...think of the TV show Heroes. You want to see conflicts and get excited as the drama leads up to it.

* I do not like cute or giggly or kid friendly shows.

I'm looking for recommendations on behalf of somebody else, and would really appreciate some help picking a show I could show this guy to let him be more open to the idea of anime.

He's a 23 year old guy I've known for a few years. I can't remember exactly what the conversation was, but a few days ago we brought up anime for like the first time ever, and his opinions on it are pretty harsh. Namely, he's got this idea that all anime follow the dbz formula, where the heroes train and find some tough guy and get beaten up (but get better) and proceed to train til they kick the bad guy's butt and then it repeats.

I asked him what show's he's watched, and a few he's named include DBZ, Bleach and Naruto. So, he's stuck to fairly filler-heavy shounen quite a bit, which makes it understandable for him to assume all anime drags on quite a bit and has an always-rising power-curve. 

I want to show him a series or two that would help him understand that lumping all anime together is like lumping all western animation together. He's expressed interest in shows like Adventure Time and Avatar, so I think it's safe to say he doesn't hate ALL animated television. 

One other problem is simply that I'm not *hugely* into anime myself. I mean, I've watched quite a few shows that I've reallly liked, but I don't do the conventions or forums or collection of memorabilia and I don't even think I know anybody who watches anime besides myself.

So that being said, I was thinking of maybe Darker than Black or Code Geass (they're still shounen-y so he'd be used to some of the tropes, but they're very short on episodes and usually pretty action-packed which would demonstrate that not all shows are a million episodes long and about 50% dialogue between the 2 fighters). I'm not really sure how well they've aged though, or if there's been any really good newer shows I've somehow missed. 

He'd probably not want to watch shows about high school kids  or long-runner shounens like One Piece or Fairy Tail (which I consider quite good, but I doubt he'd be willing to watch right now) just yet. Maybe a good seinen or a more serious shounen.

A couple other ones I had also considered showing him were TTGL (I decided maybe to hold off til he's watched one or two other anime, so the hot-blooded screaming and absurdity doesn't turn him off it) or maybe even Madoka (it's personally one of my favorites -- I realize it's a bit of a base-splitter though. Some people don't like it or find it overrated and I get that. Two big problems I have with this one is 1)he's not really versed in the magical girl stereotypes and 2)he'd probably be against a show about high school girls)

So there we are. Sorry for the wall of text. Any help would be great! Obviously anime isn't everyone's ""thing"" and I get that, but I just think he's dismissing pretty much an entire nation's worth of media without giving it a chance!

tl;dr friend turned off by POWERLEVELS and TRAINING MONTAGES and 70% talking 30% fighting.

edit: Thanks for all the recommendations folks! Hell, I've even added some of these to my list of things to watch.

 I'm probably going to try with Cowboy Bebop. If he doesn't seem to like it after the first couple episodes I'll either switch to another one of the recommended ones or just call it quits. I just want to give him a chance at seeing other styles of anime before he decides he hates the stuff, and after a rec or two I figure I've done that.",[Request],False,self,t5_2ssl0,1355689808.0,request,,True,t3_14xd1h,http://www.reddit.com/r/Animesuggest/comments/14xd1h/an_anime_for_somebody_whos_got_a_bad_opinion_on/,

Kaiji is a no good low life, and he is in runs into a debt collector collecting a debt which he signed as a securer, or insurencer or whatever, and he can't really pay back the debt except over many years of menial labor, which he hates. So he accepts an ambiguous offer and so starts the show.

It centers around gambles and quick thinking in times of need, and you are given a lot of insight on the main character's, Kaiji's, train of thought which leads him to an epiphany in a time of need. You will like it even more if you are into anime which is about battles of the mind and psychology, a bit like the ones in Legend of the Galactic Heroes's battles.

The best way to describe Kaiji as an experience is that it is immensely tense, and has many moment of intensity and desperity, on par with death note and 2005 runescape pvp. I can't express enough how it boils up feelings that no other anime ever has, it gets really dark at times, and it cannot be clearly expressed. If you have a need to view the immense spectrum of feelings and the message the medium of anime has to offer then watch this anime.

Another thing to mention is that Kaiji has an extremely different art style. If anime where defined by art style(which it isn't, its just animations from japan) then this wouldn't be anime. It is very vibrant and colorful, yet it starts out a little annoying, but it really grows on you, and you realize that it couldn't be any other way. http://i.imgur.com/WWtFz.jpg

The last thing to mention is that Kaiji isn't perfect. Kaiji is a daring experiment in the anime world, and tries out a lot of new things. When i recommend Kaiji to you I do not mean that it will be ""good"", but very different and intense, and from a new direction. ~ZAWA~ZAWA",[Suggestion],False,self,t5_2ssl0,1355448258.0,suggest,,True,t3_14tgcx,http://www.reddit.com/r/Animesuggest/comments/14tgcx/suggestion_if_you_like_something_interesting_then/,

Kokoro connect so far has been all around great, the intriguing gimmick and the interactions between the different characters once again.

It has to be in a present day setting.

I was a huge anime fan when i was in the teens (and watched pretty much everything and type of anime genre from (1998 - 2005). From classics like Evangelion, Slam Dunk; cutesy romance types Love Hinata, Azumangah; popular ones Naruto, Bleach, FMA. I've watched so many I can't remember much of it.
But I slowly lost interest in anime as I grew older went to university and moved onto tv shows like GOT, Breaking Bad, Lost, Mad men etc.

I'm looking to try and get back into anime now and hope there's a few hidden gems thats released within the last few years I might have not known; preferably short anime that are under 24 eps.
to give some info on my taste; my favourite anime that i can recall are Cowboy Bebop, Ghost in the Shell, Last Exile, Planetes. and recently, Time of Eve.


So I'm preferring anime thats similar, especially more serious and realistic ones like Planetes.
Or dystopian setting but still serious like Cowboy Bebope or last exile.

Stuff I **like**:

* Seinen, Psychological Thriller, [Deconstruction](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Deconstruction) (Fair warning, TV Tropes link =P), Slice of Life

* Anime that make you think

* Character studies, heavy emphasis on character development

* No clear-cut good and evil

* Can be slow-paced, I don't mind at all

* For reference, the only Anime I've ever rated 10/10 are:

TV - Mushishi, Tokyo Magnitude 8.0

Movies - Mononoke Hime, Kaze no Tani no Naushika (But don't bother recommending other Ghibli Movies, I've seen them all already)

Others I liked include Steins;Gate, Mahou Shoujo Madoka Magica, Kamisama no Memochou, Aku no Hana


Stuff I **dislike**:

* Fanservice, more often than not it just doesn't do anything except ruin the mood

* The cliché Shounen art style with all that funky-colored spiky hairdo and whatnot (like Dangan Ronpa; quite a shame since the story has tons of potential). I'll take Aku no Hana art over that any day of the week.

* Non-permanent death. Unless there are very good in-universe reasons (as in Steins;Gate), death should not just be a minor inconvenience. Let them stay dead.

* While I love comedy manga, comedy anime never seem to work for me, but feel free to prove me wrong~

In Fifth Place: Toujin Kit by,10,2,1,http://www.reddit.com/r/Animesuggest/comments/1ixcia/7_shortshorts_in_7_days_complete_anime_stories/,"While most of the focus on anime viewing is on television series and movies, there are also some short stories out there that are worth checking out. So, I decided to post suggestions of my ""Top Seven"" short-shorts over the next seven days. There are all animated stories that are **complete, stand-alone stories under fifteen minutes in length**.  
  
Sunday, in 7th place, it was Hiroyasu Ishida's melancholy tale [Rain Town](http://www.reddit.com/r/Animesuggest/comments/1ir4b8/7_shortshorts_in_7_days_complete_anime_stories/).  
Monday, in 6th place, it was Nobutaka Ito's short animated tale [Junk Town](http://www.reddit.com/r/Animesuggest/comments/1itdun/7_shortshorts_in_7_days_complete_anime_stories/).    
Today, in 5th place, it's Tatsuyuki Tanaka's gritty, dystopian tale **Toujin Kit**.  
  
In a depressing back-alley apartment in a dark, run-down city of the future, a girl spends her days infusing dolls with an illicit, otherworldly substance as they spring to life.  When the government officials come knocking at her door, things go from bad to worse.  
  
This 13-minute short story by [Tatsuyuki Tanaka](http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/encyclopedia/people.php?id=9248), a lesser-known key animator on a number of older series (Akira, Riding Bean, Venus Wars, Nadia, Roujin Z).  The animated short is the fourth in the [Genius Party Beyond](http://myanimelist.net/anime/6795/Genius_Party_Beyond) collection from [Studio 4°C](http://myanimelist.net/anime.php?p=13). The anthology [Genius Party](http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/encyclopedia/anime.php?id=5010), containing twelve short, self-contained stories by a wide variety of animators, but at three hours in length it was was broken up into Genius Party (7 stories) and Genius Party Beyond (5 stories).  There are plenty of great stories here, hard to pick one to be a ""favorite"" because they are all so very different.  But I had to pick Toujin Kit as a representative sample from the Genius Party omnibus, for its perfect combination of surreal fantasy and soul-crushing realism.  Reminds me strongly of [Dark City](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0118929/).   (But if you're not into the dark atmosphere, I would recommend as a honorable mention alternative from Genius Party, the uplifting [Gala](http://psgels.net/2009/07/09/genius-party-08-gala-review-825100/) by Mahiro Maeda (Gonzo).  But frankly, it's hard to go wrong with any of them.)  
  
Some reviews by [Star Crossed Anime Blog](http://psgels.net/2009/07/11/genius-party-11-toujin-kit-review-825100/) (one of my fave reviewers) and [Anime Discovery](http://my.spill.hollywood.com/profiles/blogs/anime-discovery-genius-party-genius-party-beyond).  To the best of my knowledge, neither Genius Party or Genius Party Beyond have been licensed for official release in English (I could be wrong, though).  Subtitled versions of Toujin Kit can be found online.  
  
Stay tuned to see what ends up in fourth place tomorrow!

I'm not really sure why I've done it, but I've had a feeling that animes under rating R are aimed for slightly younger people, at least if the anime has some action in it. This probably doesn't apply to slice of life kinda stuff. An example is that Trigun though it was really good in my opinion, felt like it lacked something. Despite having a decent and serious plot, good music and great characters, the humor, sometimes, felt quite stupid or aimed for younger people and the enemies the MC fought were ranked in a rather childish feeling level system. By that i mean that each enemy was stronger and more evil than the next.

FLCL on the other hand was great despite being PG-13, yet its hard to explain why.

So you guys who watch each age rating without bias, are there major differences from R rated games to those that have been rated under R?  

Here's my MAL if anyones interested http://myanimelist.net/animelist/solidair5&amp;show=0&amp;order=4

Oh Btw I rank my shows probably a little differently than others do. They are mainly ranked from my perspective on how good they were in respect to the other animes I have seen so far. Music also easily can either bump up or down a show. I've enjoyed all the shows up (down) to 6 rated, and 5 have been adequate. And the series that I've put to planned to watch are ones I'm gonna try to save for later, since the quality of the shows i've watched have been in general decreasing due to me researching a lot of shows and picked the best one next. This lead to most shows being slightly disappointing just because the last one was better. So Im now trying to watch all the suitable series I find from adequate to great.

I don't mind slow building like Shinsekai Yori or Steins;Gate but I don't want something that is bad at start but gets good with time, those are two different things. I prefer something ""thrilling"" but not really matters while it's good, also not episodic shows they don't hook me.

Actually I'm trying Ergo Proxy but I have watched a few episodes and I'm not really liking it, plus I heard it loses itself in the middle so probably I will drop it. Also watching Gankutsuou, not really feeling it, not a fan of weird art style, probably will finish but not in the mood of watching it now.

Also I have to say to keep the series between 13-25 ep, 50 if it really deserves it. I tend to lose interest in long series really quickly.

She has done this before, the most recent situation she did this was she saw the madoka movies in the same theatre as me and my friends went to go see it.

(For clarification on that...My sister was really the person who wanted to see that, after she looked up the show and saw it was often compared to sailor moon, which she is a massive fan of.  I really don't care if they go to things like this, as long as they realize I'm spending time with friends and not with them...and if I asked them not to go, they wouldn't have, or would have went to another showing)

Surprisingly (or at least she tells me) she enjoyed it, and told me she would go see the third movie whether I went or not...though I think that's more for my sister than it was for her, who apparently adored the movie, and watched the show in its entirety twice that night, and has since bought shit tons of Madoka merch.

My mom has some experience with other magical girl shows due to my little sister, so I suppose she could enjoy the deconstruction it was to a certain extent.

I tell you this to sort of give you an idea of what experience she has with anime.  She now wants to watch something else, and my father will definitely be involved in whatever this next viewing will be.  To give you an insight on what their interests are:

My mother has never been a fan of fantasy of any kind...so I have trouble understanding why she enjoyed the madoka movies. She is very into crime dramas, and more so romantic comedies.

My father is very much into things like Harry Potter, Lord of the Rings, Star wars/trek, and various other fantasy settings.  He however is very xenophobic, so I really want to pick something without too many anime cliches.  Because of this, I am more aiming for something he would be into...since if my mother learned to enjoy the madoka movies, she will probably learn to enjoy almost anything I picked out.

Both of them are very christian, and I can't see them watching a series in their entirety, so I'm leaning towards movies, or a series that has cliffhanger after cliffhanger so they don't feel like they are really watching a massive series.

I also would prefer the series/movie be dubbed.

The things I have considered, and their reasoning are:


**TV Series**

* **Attack on Titan** - I think if my dad can get used to subtitles, he will really like this.  But I also think almost anybody can get behind this show. A bonus is that it is airing, so eventually they will catch up and won't have to watch it very frequently

* **Cowboy Bebop**  - I know for a fact my dad will enjoy this, but I really can't see my mom liking this for any reason.

* **Steins;Gate** - If I can get through the first 8 episodes as fast as possible, I know they will enjoy the latter parts of the show...but those first 8 episodes will be hell, they will hate everything about it.

* **Ghost in the Shell: Stand Alone Complex** - slightly episodic, and a crime drama, so I know they will both enjoy the premise of it...though because the major is sexualized a bit too much in parts, I am worried that will really throw them off.

* **Fate/Zero** - I know they will both find something to enjoy about this show, and once they get into it I think they will really love it. The problem is that it's a little bit overbearing.


**Movies**

* **The Wolf children Ame and Yuki** - I think they will both really like this after they adjust to the subtitles...but the beastiality undertones are going to make things really awkward for them.

* **Summer Wars** - At the moment, this is the one I am considering the most in the movie department.  A good dub, a good family show, but it's also very unbelievable...

* **The girl who leapt through time** - I'm not sure about this.  It has quite a few cliches, maybe a bit too much.  I also didn't ""love"" the movie, but I'm sure they will probably like it much more than I did.

* **Spirited Away** - Everyone always seems to suggest this one...I have a feeling they will probably LIKE it, but if I can, I want to show them something they will love.

I've watched Naruto, and when I don't consider it bad (I skip all the fillers), I don't really consider it that great either. I do however wanna now what happens next so I still follow it.

When I was done with it I picked up Steins;Gate. And after just a few episodes I was hooked. I marathoned the whole show in like 3 days, and I don't only consider the best anime I've ever seen by far, but probably one of the best shows ever. 

When I was done with it I started scouring the web for similar animes. Some people suggested Kamisama Dolls, and after watching the first episode I just didn't really feel like watching more.

I'm not looking to try to convert my mother, just something to show her that anime isn't children's cartoons. Yes there are childish anime, yes there are family friendly anime, but I want to show here that there are more than just those kind of shows.

I would prefer single season shows, or well done English dubbed shows (mainly for the sake of making it easier to convince my mother) but feel free to throw out whatever fits the first paragraph's request. But, based on comments like ""Why do you watch stuff in different languages. You'll just be reading subtitles the whole time."" I have come to the idea that it would be easier to convince her to watch a 2 season dubbed show rather than an one season subbed one. There will always be a half hour here or there, it may just take longer, but at least she'd watch it. Keeping that in mind, again don't hesitate if the show doesn't have a (good) dub.

In your suggestions, if you wouldn't mind using **bold** for single season and *italics* for dub, that would be great, but if you don't/can't no problem, just trying to save myself some time. Links are also helpful, but again, nothing I can't do on my own once I get the name.

My ideas so far (feel free to discount ones that I put here)

*Steins;Gate* (yes i know right outa the bat, breaking one of my own rules)

***Serial Experiments: Lain*** (although, due to the mindfuck that is the show i'm a but hesitant. and for the time, i thought the dub was pretty damn good)

***Baccano*** (this is my favorite as of now. its got a little bit of everything, romance, drama, comedy, tragedy, action. it doesn't hold back on the blood or gore, but its never excessive. the story doesn't hand much if anything out to the watching and it zooms by at a breakneck pace)

**Madoka Magica** (proof that even if you have a cute characters and it starts off all innocent and such that it won't stay/be that way forever.)

Fate/Zero (i guess similar to Baccano, but [a], i haven't finished it so i'm a little hesitant, [b] its 2 seasons, and [c] its sub not dub. 2 season+dub doesn't make a great combination.)

ShinSekai Yori (kinda like Madoka, but it is longer, and there is episode 8 to worry about...and also the Fate/Zero problem of 2 season+dub.)

*Welcome to the NHK* (its dark, its funny, and it might also hurt me some in that she'll attempt to stop me from watching anime. but i'm off to college in the fall so not like it would last that long anyways)

*Neon Genesis Evangelion* (well *I* thought the dub was good....however Shinji being Shinji may make her want to stop watching)

That's all I got. Thank you, in advance, to anyone for reading through this wall and putting thought into your suggestions!

**TL;DR**: Recommend me something a bit mature that would prove to my mother that anime is not just children's cartoons. Preferably something that is one season and has a above average English dub.

He's into guns, zombies, action, etc. he had a whole collection of you guns when we were kids. Plans on getting a gun sooner or later for himself. Big gun fanatic. 

So then the problem is the content. He's really iffy when it comes to romance. Any romance at all will not work out. Also, fanservice is a no-can-do. Even a random shower scene with the girls naked (even censored) will not work, as he's a first timer. 

Adding on to that, any erratic ""Japan"" elements won't work out either. I think wildly varying hair colors or styles will stretch beyond his suspense of belief, at least until he gets used to it. That goes for anything that seems a bit odd to the normal man but isn't noticed by those who watch normally. A little is fine, but too much will be too distracting. 

I don't think language will be an issue, since he knows Chinese, and listens to various Chinese, Russian, Hungarian, etc songs; language barrier shouldn't be an issue, so subs without dubs are fine. 

So I'm looking for a show with absolutely zero fanservice or non-action elements, and that is badass. Anybody have any suggestions?

Also, I don't like anime that is too long. I think 26 episodes is perfect. However, 50 episodes can be great too. I am not looking for 300+ episode animes. Last EDIT: I really do prefer original anime. I find that most manga/light novel adaptations have very poor endings due to their attempts to adhere to the manga for the exposition; they end up totally lost when they try to end the show in a reasonable number of episodes. Claymore is a good example of this.

Such scenes would be where [Mayrui died for the first time](/spoiler) and [where he thought she would be dead and went running back to the lab in that white/black fluid animation](/spoiler).

I've also liked the [the scene where Haru dies and Shu goes apeshit](/spoiler) in Guilty Crown.

In the movie of 'The Girl who Leapt Through Time' where she [wastes her last point in leaping back in time and then sees her friend just seconds away from inevitable death by the train while she can't do anything but to run behind them helplessly to try to catch them up on foot but she falls a couple of times](/spoiler) The whole scene made me so quiet and sad, I very much liked it.

In Zero No Tsukaima [where Louise loses her magical powers](/spoiler). 

All of Clannad~After Story~ made me... it changed me. The scene where [Nagisa tears down on the stage and then her dad comes in... you know the rest](/spoiler), and the [death of Nagisa](/spoiler).

To be honest, now that I look at my list, it seems I'd very enjoy [where one of the dear character of the main character dies](/spoiler) or that the anime has a huge personality development/change on the main character. For example, a person that gained a power or already had a power (or let it be love, hate, a friend.. whatever), then that person lost it so the plot will start revolving around how that person will overcome his feelings, the problems that will arise and shit.

However, I was also sometimes bored to tears by the romantic drama.

So! I'm looking for anime (or even manga) that:  

* A) focuses on **strong, compassionate, and generally awesome platonic relationships between likeable characters** (e.g., between friends/family/teammates/epic rivals/whatever), **even/especially to the exclusion of romance**; and  
* B) is **character-consistent**: it doesn't matter if the series has an overarching multi-episode plot or is broken up into self-encapsulated episodes as long as the characters develop over time; I get frustrated and lose interest when characters backslide meaninglessly or actions taken in one episode have no consequence in the next one. Actions should matter, and characters and their relationships should make sense.

Big ol' bonus points for:

* I) strong, awesome characters (especially females who aren't just eye candy/romance fodder);   
* II) a really compelling art style with sick, slick animation;    
* III) HILARITY; and  
* IV) more light-hearted than super heavy drama, though I'm fine with stakes of any size (whether saving the world or saving the high school basketball team)

The Studio Ghibli movies are my holy grail of character creation/growth, visual design, and palatable romantic elements.

I'm willing to try any genre except horror; while I tend to favor the intimacy of slice-of-life, I also fucking adore the One Piece manga so there's some wiggle-room here. Romance should be a peripheral element instead of the central focus unless it's *THE GREATEST FREAKING ROMANCE EVER*, like *DESTINED-TO-BE SAILOR MOON/TUXEDO MASK SHIT* (or at least what my nine-year-old self thought their romance was, maybe it actually sucked? it's been a while)!! Basically, romance is OK but I like it much better when love takes the form of tearful bro-hugs instead of tearful make-outs.

Anyway!

**Anime/manga I've loved because of the aforementioned elements:**  

* Hikaru no Go  
* Ookiku Furikabutte/Big Windup!
* One Piece 
* Sakamichi no Apollon/Kids on the Slope  
* anything by Studio Ghibli
* Tekkon Kinkreet 
* Yotsuba&amp;!

**Anime/manga I found OK:**  

* Baccano!  
* FMA  
* Paprika  

**Anime I gave up on a couple of episodes in:**

* Ao no Exorcist  
* Arakawa Under the Bridge   
* Giant Killing  
* Ouran High School Host Club   
* Summer Wars  

**Anime I've had recommended to me/plan on watching?:**  

* 5 Centimeters Per Second  
* Azumanga Daioh  
* Bakemonogatari
* Cowboy Bebop   
* Durarara!!  
* Eyeshield 21  
* Fate Zero  
* FLCL   
* The Girl Who Leapt Through Time  
* Gurren Lagann  
* House of Five Leaves  
* Mushishi
* Natsume Yuujincho  
* Piano Forest  
* Princess Tutu  
* Puella Magi Madoka Magica

I'm very new to the whole anime scene and as a result I've only watched 4 (well technically 3.5) series. Here's my opinion on what I've already seen, so that maybe a better suggestion can be offered:

-High School of the Dead: First recommended to me by a friend. While seeing zombie fighting was entertaining at first, once episode 6 came along the fan service got a little too ridiculous and I stopped watching.

-Death Note: This was my first full series and I found it phenomenal. The art style, the characters, the plot and the music were all absolutely incredible and I thoroughly enjoyed the series.

-Speed Grapher: The premise, while a little ridiculous, was original and overall I really loved the series. The superhero aspect was a neat change from my usual fare, and the series always had a sense of humour. I also liked the dynamic between the principle cast. Once again, I loved the music as well.

-Cowboy Bebop: A classic, not much more needed to say.

With that said there are certain criteria I'm looking for in the next series: 

-Mature art style (think Death Note, though a little less so is fine as well). I've heard good things about Clannad, for instance, but the cutesy design doesn't work for me :/ 
-No mecha. I've heard that Code Geass would be perfect for me, considering how much I enjoyed Death Note, but I can't get into mecha premises. 
-No high school. I know that's a tall order by anime standards. I'm fine if high school plays a minor role in things, but I've found it difficult to get immersed in series where it's all about the high school dynamic :/ 
-Plot. Basically, I'm not looking for mindless action (I'm looking at you, HOTD) right now. Preferably a mature plot too, something emotional. -I would also really like it (though not required) if there were a romance side-plot. I like love stories :) 
-Also, I have a thing for music so any series with great music is a plus 
-No 600 episode series please! 75 episodes is probably my limit
Now I know I've painted myself into a corner with those criteria, so I'm willing to be a little flexible with anything but the art style. I can't get into cutesy anime, as much as I wish I could.
-Completed series! Attack on Titan looks amazing, for instance, but I'd hate to power through it only to have to wait a few weeks before being able to finish it.

ANYWAYS, I'm just looking for suggestions (I know how picky I sound!). Thanks for taking the time to read this post and thanks in advance for any suggestions ^_^ !

TL;DR Looking for anime with a mature plot and art style (no mecha or high school), a love story and good music, or as much of that as possible.

I also have a priority on dubs unless it butchers the anime, I know many take subs over any dub, but I like just listening when I can, but do not mind reading subs if it's the only option.

Following this is a list of anime I have watched, with an explanation as to why I liked it in a rough order from least to most liked:

* **Code Geass** - Love everything about this anime (the entire series), the characters are great, the story is great, the action is great. I love the different Geass powers and the battles involving them, possibly most importantly I love how Lelouch uses his genius throughout to battle his enemies.

* **Death Note** - Love this one too, not as action-packed as Code Geass, but I love the concept of the story and again, most importantly, how Light uses his genius to battle N and his other enemies.

* **Full Metal Alchemist / Brotherhood** - I liked FMA on its own, watched the full series, then watched FMA: Brotherhood (which was a ton better than the first), and again like the previous two this one was for the action, and the similar but unique powers that each alchemist had. Though I feel the storyline in this was better than Bleach and Naruto.

* **Bleach** - This one was more about the action than story. Don't get me wrong, I liked the story, but the most important thing that drew me into this anime was the characters having similar but unique abilities. I am still following the manga.

* **Nartuo** - Similar to Bleach, it has a good story, but the action and ninja abilities being similar but all having their unique specialties is what drew me in. I continue to watch this with each release and even read the manga at each release.

* **Yu Yu Hakusho** - Recommended by a friend I enjoyed this quite a bit. The battles were great, the storyline was interesting (damn, why did it have to end where it did?) and once again everyone had unique powers.

* **Darker Than Black** - Very good story, good characters, and everyone had unique powers. The concept behind using the powers was interesting too, it wasn't just use your powers at-will with no drawbacks.

* **Steins;Gate** - Excellent story and an interesting take on time travel. The characters were great and while it wasn't action packed like some of the other anime I've enjoyed but the story and concept was interesting enough to me to keep me highly interested.

* **Sword Art Online** - Good story, nice action, as a gamer I enjoyed the concept....not much I can say about it but it was definitely enjoyable.

* **Mobile Suit Gundam 00** - A bit outside my normal zone (more mech focused than I generally prefer), the story was good but it was sort of annoying seeing the good guys overpower the bad guys, next episode the bad guys got a powerup, followed by the good guys getting a powerup in the following episode. I guess that's how it goes but it didn't seem like it took any effort, the powerups were just there but inactive until needed. It was enjoyable, but mech combat is not my favorite.

* **Future Diary** - Watched this on a whim, it was a bit outside the normal anime I watched but I wasn't disappointed by the end, I enjoyed the action and the concept of the future diaries.


Now for one major anime that I didn't like:

* **Monster** - Decided to give this a try, but it didn't seem to have any action like I'm used to, I've heard the story is good but I just couldn't get drawn into it.",,False,self,t5_2ssl0,1375589197.0,,,True,t3_1jnwu0,http://www.reddit.com/r/Animesuggest/comments/1jnwu0/request_looking_for_a_new_anime_to_watch/,

* Dark atmosphere overall, no lighthearted shows like Hyouka for example, also not shows that are lightheart 90% of the time and get dark in the last 2 chapters, what I mean is that you feel the something is wrong in the atmosphere, like the first episode of Higurashi or Penguindrum which start with comedy but you feel like shit is going to happen.

* Some kind of conspiracy like Chaos;Head with the next-gen or S;G with the Sern stuff

* Don't mind old shows but nothing too old, like from 1995+.

* Present or future setting, don't mind 70s or  80s, but not medieval or historical.
 
* Located in a city, Like F/Z or Kara no Kyoukai, not village out of town like Higurashi or Shiki

* If possible protagonists not to be kids. High school or older.

* Not episodical shows like cowboy bebop. I don't mind arc shows but not nosense filler, I would like not to turn aside from the main history.

* And last, not infinite not ending shows or too shounen.

1374650206.0,6,self.Animesuggest,1ixyj8,"[Suggestion] Horizon in the Middle of Nowhere (Kyoukai Senjou no Horizon) - romance, comedy, action, adventure, fantasy",9,3,1,http://www.reddit.com/r/Animesuggest/comments/1ixyj8/suggestion_horizon_in_the_middle_of_nowhere/,"So, Horizon in the Middle of Nowhere. I consider it to be one of Sunrise's masterpieces. Much time, effort, and energy was placed into this series. The animation, background, and fight scenes shine. Especially in the second season. Romance, comedy, fantasy, action, adventure. Two seasons.  

The MAL links are as follows: [Season 1](http://myanimelist.net/anime/10456/Kyoukaisenjou_no_Horizon) [Season 2](http://myanimelist.net/anime/12487/Kyoukaisenjou_no_Horizon_II)  

Based off the description, you can see they are reenacting history. While it might not be clear in the first season, in the second season they recreate the Spanish Armada attack on England. Real life historical figures play a role too: e.g. Innocentius = Pope Innocent X, Thomas Shakespeare = William Shakespeare, and so on. Also, the faction names. Tres Espana. Svet Rus. Far East. England. Hexagone Francaise. And so on.  

Aoi Toori is the main protagonist of both seasons, although some would argue Tenzou Crossunite is the main one of the second season, as he plays a very important role. Toori is a funny, happy, perverted, cheerful guy who does absolutely batshit insane things. He gropes and undresses woman without hesitation. He is literally naked the entire second season. Yet, he is very respected by his comrades. His girl, Horizon, lost her emotions and they are used to create Mortal Sin Armaments, pretty much weapons of mass destruction. Toori is committed to regain all those emotions (and weapons) for Horizon. Even if that means he has to go against the world. Because almost every faction possess a Mortal Sin Armament.  

What are the good things about this series? Cast. Absolutely huge cast. You have Musashi's crew, England, Tres Espana, P.A. Oda, and more. Not just numbers, but variety. Each user has their own rather unique ability (seriously), which is very refreshing to see.  

BGM. The soundtrack, oh my goodness. Absolutely amazing. A Few tracks are memorable in the first season. In the second season, even better, especially Tenzou's ""magnificent scene"" as I like to call it without spoiling much. The track itself is called ""Hiding Determination"".  

Animation and background. Absolutely fantastic. The fight scenes are very well done, and the background, fluidity of the animation, and action is very well done.  

Now, what are the cons? There's one that come to mind. The first few episodes (3-4) of the first season. Now, when you first start a new anime you will probably watch at least the first two or three episodes before you decide whether to continue or not right? Well the first few to some may seem confusing, weird, out of place, slow paced. And honestly, it probably is unless you read the LN's. But believe me, when you get past those first few episodes, you'll be in for a blast. If by episode, I dunno, let's say 10 of the first season and you still don't like it, then the series is probably not for you. And that's okay. Just like how Game of Thrones or Harry Potter isn't for everyone.  

So to those who have already watched this series, or for those who are wondering what this series' future is like, [the last episode of the second season](/s ""shows characters from volumes that have yet to been animated, therefore a third season (heck, probably a fourth as well since there IS that much material left. The LN's are still ongoing.) is very likely. In addition, sales are reportedly doing pretty well."")

Overall, this series is fantastic. It might not be for everyone, but I definitely think it is worth checking out. Who knows, you might get really attached to it. It's rather unique cast, story, and amazing soundtrack, fight scenes, and animation really shows what this series is all about.",[Suggestion],False,self,t5_2ssl0,False,suggest,,True,t3_1ixyj8,http://www.reddit.com/r/Animesuggest/comments/1ixyj8/suggestion_horizon_in_the_middle_of_nowhere/,

On a related note, if there's anything on my PTW list that really isn't any good, then please give me reasons why I should take it off so I can reconsider. I don't really want my PTW list to get too massive to handle so I'd like to ""trim the fat"", so to speak.

I'll explain inside the spoiler tags why I consider the anime below ""fucked up"" in order least to greatest.

[Sword Art Online](/s ""To me, this anime only has 14 episodes. The second ""Arc"" is total bullshit and I hate myself for watching it. Asuna and Kirito dying and vanishing in to nothingness was very sad, but at the same time very satisfying and I consider it as the real ending of the  show.

[Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann](/s ""Very satisfying ending, but a lot of deaths in this anime. Kamina's death early on was a massive kick in my balls. I almost lost interest in the anime after that but decided to keep watching. After the Spiral King died and the time skip happened, I was very glad with the ""happy ending"" that the show was heading for, specially after the Simon asked Nia to marry him. ""Yay, happy ending!"" - I thought. Nope. Anti-fucking-spirals. A lot of people die, and the show fills up with more feelings. I kinda entered in denial when it was hinted that Nia wouldn't survive if the anti-spirals were defeated, but I just assumed the ""power of love"" would make everything okay. I was glad up until the last few minutes when they get married and she just goes away. Again, the ending makes sense, Nia disappears, Simon can't stick around, but that doesn't make it any less sad :( "")

[Code Geass](/s ""Watching Leleouch misfiring his Geass on Euphemia, losing Euphemia, then being forced to use his Geass on Shirley, and then losing her too was hearth-breaking. To make it all worse, he never drops his act in front of other characters. I almost lost it on how he reacts to Shirley being killed. It all makes sense at the end, when his plan is revealed, but that doesn't make the anime any less fucked up, specially when only a few understood why he did what he did. I don't like remembering Code Geass that much, it messes me up so I will just stop here."")

[Death Note](/s ""The way that Light used and abused people was very sickening, specially Misa, but that was necessary for him to achieve his goals. It was pretty obvious to me that Light was never going to win, but that didn't stop me from wishing for his victory. The way that the anime wraps up is pretty cool. I'm was really okay with Light getting totally outplayed by Near, and it was very satisfying seeing Light and Mikami losing their shit. Seeing Light running with his body full of bullets and Ryuk laughing and writing his name down was pretty cool and fitting, and then, after Light dies, it cuts to Misa. God fucking dammit, why :( Seeing her just broke me. The sad song, the credits rolling and you just watch Misa jump to her death. I lost someone who committed suicide by jumping, so watching that that ending really messed me up. Great, fucked up anime, regardless of my personal experience."")

As for ""happy endings"", the only anime that I recently watched that fits what I'm looking for is is Rurouni Kenshin. It has the same elements of the anime in the ""Fucked up"" list ( great action, great story, great final battle, many tears ) but actually ends very well. I've not watched anything past the Shishio fight, since they are all fillers and I was advised to not watch the ""anime final OVA"" since according to people is complete garbage. [This image](http://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/4/25808l.jpg) alone is enough to easy my mind that everything ends well for Kenshin and I don't want to risk being proven wrong.

* Smart: Smart animes make good use of every episode. I'm okay for an anime having a few fun, laid back episodes. It's okay to deviate for the main story to have some character building going on. Code Geass did an amazing job at not having useless episodes. Every ""fun"" episode had a very strong follow up that made use of what we learned about the characters and their relationships. Declaration at the School Festival -&gt; Bloodstained Euphie and Love Attack! -&gt; Assassin from the Past for example. 

* Soul Crushing: Happy endings or sad endings, it doesn't matter. The more ""feels"" the better. Because it's so fresh in my memory, I will once again mention Code Geass, at some points in the series I just had to pause mid episode and take a walk because of the roller-coaster of emotions, specially towards the ending.

* Satisfactory ending: This is the most important thing. The anime has to have a satisfactory ending. Closure is the most important thing after watching it all. I hate how some animes make shit up to add ""depth"" to the story, but never address those issues in a satisfactory way. Claymore is an example of this ""trap"". It's pretty good overall, but I have no idea why so much time was spent mentioning some characters and places, when most of them never played a big role at the end.

I'm also not interested in ""incomplete"" animes. That means if the anime is currently airing the 1st season or the 2nd season, I'll probably wait until everything is done so I can watch it all at the same time. There are exceptions though, Psycho-Pass is one of them. I've heard that Season 2 is on the works, but S1 alone is very good. I want to know more about the anime, but if Season 2 doesn't happen for some reason, I'll be satisfied.

As for Genre, I'll watch pretty much anything. If it's good, I'll check it out.

I've watched many, many more, but just recently I started keeping track of what I watch. Here are the ones that I've finished recently: Beck, Claymore, Code Geass, Death Note, Monster, Psycho-Pass and Sword Art Online

Off the top of my head, the two shows only have two things in common: cute girls and amazing voice acting.

Kannagi is notable mostly because of how well the seiyuu displayed a wide variety of emotions through their voices, especially for the more comedic moments. It's comparable to how Kuroko from Railgun will completely change her voice at the drop of a hat. Above all, hearing Hanazawa Kana as a seductive and sadistic nun was a treat.

Dog Days, on the other hand, had a huge of cast of many renowned seiyuu, most of them pulling off weird accents to great effect. Yuuki Aoi as loli squirrel who occasionally ends her sentences with with ""nanoja"" was probably my favorite part of the show.

What are some other anime with exceptional voice acting?

Mini-recommendation: Both Dog Days and Kannagi were really good. Dog Days was a really fun harem with great action and slice of life. Also has incredibly cute girls, if you're into that kind of thing. And you definitely should be. Kannagi might look like yet another stereotypical harem, but don't be fooled.

(perhaps same writer?),11,6,27,http://www.reddit.com/r/Animesuggest/comments/1ffe85/anime_that_is_as_big_in_plottwists_and_about_as/,"So, I watched BRS, the 8-episode series, right when it came out (pure luck that after watching the OVA I noticed the TV series had episode 1 coming out), in 2012. And even though I'm not done with the massive list I got suggested last time (mostly loving it!), I really can't help but want to watch something like it again.

Now, I know this anime, and more specifically its plot, is by some people regarded as bad, simply because it's insanely intricate, has a ton of plot-twists... and I guess is rather easy to completely misunderstand. However, for me, this has been the anime with pretty much the best plot ever.



-Constantly seemingly random or even extreme things happen, but get later on explained.

-Massive amount of plottwists, of the kind that you could call mindfucks.

-Absolutely great ending, that barely gets hyped towards, is inexpected, and doesn't disappoint. (way too much anime I've seen lately near the end simply become awful plotwise.

Examples of heavily disappointing plotendings of otherwise absolutely awesome series I have watched:

[Claymore](/s ""that one special thing, that we found out we can do, let's do a whole lot more of that so the main character keeps getting  last-minute, constantly stupidly-much-stronger through that. oh and the character that the main character tries to protect conveniently runs into the antagonist"")

[Ao no exorsist](/s ""let's hype the fight with the antagonist up to no end, have someone completely unrelated to the plot so far show up and conveniently make a massive gate so that the antagonist comes to them instead, way before they're ready for him. they then proceed to only slightly proceed to beat him with the power of love and friendship"")

[Soul Eater](/s ""Let's beat the antagonist with the power of positivity/love/friendship!"")


I don't really care too much for the genre, and I think nothing ever comes close to the absolute massive mix of genre of Black Rock Shooter (""slice of schoollife"", mix of bright world and dark+grim world, drama, mindfucks, some action/fighting), but I'm not exactly looking for a pure drama/slice-of-life series, or a somewhat too childish series (unless it's insanely good maybe =3)

I don't really mind it if it's heavy on the feels (yes, I shed man-tears watching the end of Black Rock Shooter), just looking for something intriguing again =D

In the first episode kids originally built gundams for their school project out of clay, then overnight the toy/clay gundams would transform into real life gundams.

I'm sure It's not Gundam g and gundams didn't have wings.

The kids used to control the gundam via their motion, gundams would reinact what ever they did. The main gundam consist of white,blue,red i think

It could possibly be gundam or transformers but i'm not certain at all. Please help, it used to be my favorite show and i watched it while i was 6-10 in mid-late 90s. i'm trying to find this series for over a decade now.

it's like gundam g but the characters are different. bit younger i think. Gundams are big in size like they are in gundam g. In the series there are multiple gundam owners and they(kids) grew up gradually as the show goes on. I remember the first episode where they wish the gundams they created out of clay transform to become real life one. They have battles,storyline etc and i think i remember they can combine/transform with other gundams to become more powerful. I'm not 100% certain. The main character like gets lifted inside gundam and while he's standing in this empty space, he gets to direct the movements/actions of the gundam. I used to watch the show along with zorro(cartoon) sailermoon and detective conan.

It's not Gundam g, Gundam Wing nor, The Brave Fighter of legend da garn. It could be transformers but i'm not certain

I'm not necessarily talking about being physically strong (but also not denying it), but being extremely smart or witty.

I'll give some examples of characters I'm looking for:

* Usui from Kaichou wa Maid-sama!

* Rock from Black Lagoon (but only on Roberta's Blood Trail and season 2 second half)

* Hitei from Katanagatari (not main, but follows the personality I'm looking for)

* Karen and Senjougahara from monogatari series

* Yuuko from xxxHolic

* Holo from Spice&amp;Wolf

As for genre, I'd rather being a comedy or romantic comedy with a main plot. Meaning I'm not looking for titles like Azumanga Daioh or Sayonara Zetsubou Sensei.

That said, if you have a suggestion that you think I'll enjoy, even if it doesn't meet some criteria go ahead and say it.

So, after looking through many forums and suggestions, I keep reading responses that seem to strongly disagree with how fun some anime are to watch... So I come to you guys, hoping to get some good suggestions =D

Most of the anime I've watched are shounen, and I do tend to typically enjoy very simple anime, but I can appreciate a more serious anime too. Thing to note is that I never read any manga and don't plan to either, nor have I seen any OVA's besides BlackRockShooter, so no plotspoilers please :P Open for series suggestions, or good OVA's that are considered must-watch for series I already know.
_____________________________________

Some notes on SOME of the anime I watched:

FMA: Tried hard to watch that, but the plot just seems all over the place, and it just didn't feel fun to watch at all. Not sure if brotherhood would interest me enough, even though it seems to have a spot in about every top 3...

Blackrockshooter: If there's more anime with such good story and artstyle, I absolutely loved that anime, mainly because of the amounts of times I felt mindfucked.

DBZ: Only on the list because I watched it ages ago.

Bleach/OnePiece, absolutely loved both series, due to how it can combine a decent plot (bleach excels short-terms, especially the last arc was great, one piece's long-term plot for some reason intrigues me a ton, and I love how everything is connected in the end), with lots of action, and a fair bit of random fun in general. Bleach maybe became a bit dark near the end, but I actually quite liked it.

Naruto: Mainly only watching because it seems like the series will end soon, and I'm too invested in it to stop watching now :P Massive amount of fillers or semi-fillers are quite annoying.

Hunter x Hunter: Enjoying this anime a ton, after the original's lame ending (did not watch the OVAs due to 2011 existing) I was pleasantly surprised with how good the 2011 remake was, and enjoying this a ton.

Fairy Tail: Way too childish for me to pick this up again, regardless of the other qualities this anime might have.

Claymore: Was okay, but not that great for what I thought it would be.

Naruto/Shippuden, Bleach, FMA:Brotherhood, Last Exile, Inuyasha, Soul Eater (my favorite), Durarara!!, Darker Than Black, Mushi-Shi.

These are all within the last 2 months or so. Naruto has taken me a long time because I watched it weekly for about 2 years. I'm bored of it now.

I've also watched many Studio Ghibli films, namely: Castle in the Sky, My Neighbor Totoro, Kiki's Delivery Service, Porco Rosso, Whisper of the Heart, Princess Mononoke, Spirited Away, The Cat Returns, Howl's Moving Castle, Ponyo, and Arriety. I think *maybe* Grave of the Fireflies, but I don't remember.

Shows I've started/seen parts of:

Death Note-It's alright, I'll probably give it a run through.

Wolf's Rain-Same as above. I'm 11 episodes in but it's rough going.

Baccano-I don't know how I feel about it yet. I'll give it another try.

Samurai Champloo- It's OK, not my favorite. Haven't finished it yet.

Samurai 7- Eh, I could like it. 

Cowboy Bebop-Started, the first episode didn't do anything for me.

I'm looking for any and all suggestions. I really enjoyed the style of Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood and Soul Eater. The cool fights, interesting characters, out-of-control emotions leading to more badass fights, simple yet detailed art style, comedy relief during heavy moments, etc.

Chizuru (Seitokai no Ichizon)
