I never told them what was really going on, the problems their mom was having, her drug problems, the thousands I had spent in court and in the system. 

Mom used to call them up and tell them she couldn't visit because I wouldn't let her. The truth was the judge told her she had to get off coke, pay some child support, and have a drivers license. 

It's a long story but the short version is that my kids for years thought that I was keeping their mother from them, I would work my ass to the bone, and they resented me, were frustrated and angry. I didn't bad mouth their mom, I'd just say she's having a hard time right now but she loves them.


My oldest daughter moved out a while ago, she's going to be 20 soon. I got a call from her last night and she told me that she and her brother had been talking recently. 

The gist:

&gt; Dad, we are so proud of you. You have done everything a person could do to take care of us. We know that no matter what ever happens you will always be there. We know who mom is now but you never said a bad word. You've always been an example and we look up to you. Thanks for being a good Dad. 

This was coming from my prodigal daughter who was just so upset that her mom left that she used me as her ""punching bag"" for years. Years of everything you don't want to happen happening. I took it all and always tried my best to stand strong, firm, but loving. I failed often but always got up and carried on. 

I had forgotten the idea of being appreciated, and it just floored me that she called up to say that. I thought I'd share it with you guys. It was the best call I've ever gotten in my life.

An hour before I noticed that the straps for her car seat had been loosened for her comfort and besides the protest against it tightened them back to the firm, barely able to place your fingers under their shoulders setting that they should be. This probably saved my daughter from serious harm if not from being killed. I suffered severe internal bruising in my chest, whiplash and my stimulator implant sight in my back is hurt bad as well. My wife suffered cracked cheek and nasal bones, severe bruising where the seat belt in the back seat held her and at least whiplash if not possible small fractures to her neck bones. My point is, it is important that you strap your children tightly into their baby seats. I thought I was being an anal paranoid arguing and making her straps a little tighter even though she hates being so strapped in but I know that this saved her from anything serious. Please Dads, please, always strap your children in firmly to the their seats. You should barely be able to get a finger in-between the shoulders and the belt.

Maybe buy up a ton of Apple stock or invent the Sham-wow, but then go down all the other paths that you know will get you back to where you are right now, only a little richer?

Well I can't do that anymore. I can never go back to a point in time before the conception of my child because it was the single most important event in my life and I could never, *ever* recreate it. It would be impossible to isolate the single unique seed that lead to him and I just can't bear the thought of having any other child in place of him, even one of my own from the exact same batch. 

In one fell swoop this perfect little boy of mine has ruled out every possible re-do I would ever take in life, should Doc Brown ever show up at my house with a DeLorean. The fantasy of going back in time armed with more wisdom to make corrections in my life is now a dead one, because my life turned out perfect. 

These are the things I think about when I'm changing a diaper at midnight. 

Thank you [my sweet son](http://i.imgur.com/5wRTkhY.jpg), for reconciling all of my possible pasts, presents and futures. Thank you for making my reality better than any fantasy. You're the best thing that ever happened to me in any universe.

If a Dad posts a pic of himself with his kid, it's not really appropriate to then pick it apart and tell him how he's not doing a very good job as a parent. I'm willing to bet that's not what any of us come here for.

Anyway, I really enjoy how most of this subreddit celebrates the joys of being a father, and occasionally has some good tips and tricks.

I'm not sure how many people know this, as no parent I speak to IRL has known about this, however you can lockdown the hardware buttons so your kids cannot exit whatever app you put them in, and also lockdown all or part of the touchscreen. 

Go to Settings, general, accessibility and turn on guided access, and triple click the home button when in an app to lock it down. To unlock the app, triple click and enter a PIN number. 

Only works on iOS 6 and above.

The little guy then said, ""that's right I pushed her.""

I told my daughter, ""We should try to tell the teacher first but if you are being hurt it's good to defend yourself."" 

""I did tell my teacher, daddy.""

1360686719.0,233,self.daddit,18dtrb,Found out my one-year-old isn't really my child. My ex wants to take full custody. :(,261,28,111,http://www.reddit.com/r/daddit/comments/18dtrb/found_out_my_oneyearold_isnt_really_my_child_my/,"I've been through a lot in the past two years, but the past year has been wonderful simply because I've had partial custody of a wonderful little girl.  Now I think I'm going to lose her, and I don't know what to do with myself.

My wife was having an affair when she got pregnant. She admitted she didn't know whose it was, but she made it clear didn't want to be with me anymore. She filed for divorce and I paid for a non-invasive DNA test. The DNA test showed that the child was mine, but the fine print warned that if there had been a miscarriage in the past year (there was) then there was a possibility the wrong DNA had been isolated. I was so happy to be a father I didn't bother to do a follow-up test after she was born. I assumed that since I had signed her birth certificate and had partial custody it didn't matter. I guess I was wrong.

The child is now almost a year old and her mother decided that she looks like the other man. He's still dating her, although they don't live together. I've been the one paying child support and sharing custody. They went behind my back and got another DNA test done. It shows she's his child. I found out when she emailed me the results. When asked what she plans to do, she said she is going to take full custody. My lawyer thinks that due to [recent legislation](http://legislature.mi.gov/documents/2011-2012/billanalysis/House/htm/2011-HLA-5328-3.htm) she'll be able to do it.

I'm conflicted. I loved being a father, and I love her. Still, the boyfriend is around, and they've been talking about buying a home together. This is a chance for the child to have a single-family home. I feel like it would be selfish of me to try to stay in her life. A friend recommended that I make sure the court knows that if I'm ever needed I'll be there for her, but as long as her parents are both active in her life I'm willing to relinquish my parental rights for the child's benefit.

I'm heart-broken by this. I was looking forward to celebrating her first birthday this week, then her second, her third, and sharing the rest of her life. Now I feel like it's all been a strange dream. I've grown through this experience, and I'll never be the same. I don't want to not be a dad anymore, but I've learned to roll with the punches life throws at you. A friend told me ""you'll always be a dad, if someone's child dies that doesn't make them less of a dad."" That meant a lot, but in my heart I'm not convinced. I feel like I've been living a lie.

I'm not really looking for specific advice, but if anyone has any experience with losing a child to custody or finding out a child wasn't theirs, I'd appreciate knowing that I'm not alone. Right now I'm just hiding in my office trying to avoid all my co-workers who don't know what's going on and keep asking how my daughter is, and what we're doing for her birthday. I'll have to tell them soon, but I'm trying to wait until the court makes a decision next week.

Edit: I signed over all parental rights just after her first birthday. It's been difficult but I have family and friends supporting me. There are still people in my life who don't know, but telling the story is the hardest part.

(Apology in advance- long),277,44,98,http://www.reddit.com/r/daddit/comments/1anxu8/lost_our_baby_to_preterm_labor_any_chance_i_can/,"So, not sure where to start so please bear with me. I'm kind of shit at retelling this sort of thing.

My wife and I had been trying for a kid since we were married. Failed a few times due to misreading her cycles. Finally we succeeded last year.. only for her to miscarry at 6 weeks. She was hurting for awhile until, inexplicably a few weeks after the miscarriage, the test was positive again! We didn't take any chances and got a great OB-GYN to be her personal doc. He talked us through what to expect, set us up for ultrasounds, the whole shebang. He said not to get our hopes up high because it was so rare to hear of a successful pregnancy so close to a miscarriage. But the weeks (and months) went on and everything pointed to a healthy baby girl. 

Around the halfway point we started working on looking for baby-friendly apartments, parties and even settled on a name (Harley Jean, after our favorite female comic book characters). We told our families at Christmas, so the initial shock wore off and now everybody was in baby mode. Even my own mother, who is always adamant (read: a total bitch) about how we're not financially stable enough to have a kid, had come to terms with being a grandma in a few months. At the 21st week, we went to have an ultrasound and blood work done to test for Down Syndrome and a few other prenatal tests. The techs and doc laughed with us constantly that little Harley was healthy as can be, and she jumped around like a jumping bean every time somebody pressed on my wife's belly with equipment.

That following Sunday she noticed some red spotting. Of course it had to be Sunday, so her doctor's office was completely closed. I rushed her to our local hospital's ER, where they rushed her up to the maternity ward. They took blood, did a quick sonogram and put an IV on her. Harley was fine, so I assumed it was just a false alarm; maybe she strained a little too much at the gym or maybe she was just seeing some old blood that was finally flushed out. The on-call doc finally arrived, took one look at everything the nurses had done, took a look at my wife's canal, and told us she was dilated. There was no reason why, no explanation he could possibly come up with. ""Sometimes you have a bad cervix and you don't catch it until it's too late."" (I'm paraphrasing because the shock had already taken over. But that's the gist of what I heard. We had a happy healthy baby girl jumping around, but nobody knew my wife had a ticking time bomb for a cervix and now everything we had planned for was going to be lost). ""I would send you to your regular hospital if I could,"" said the doctor, ""but I fear the ride up in an ambulance might be too stressful and you could deliver in the ambulance. 21 weeks isn't a viable baby so you're better off staying here and letting us deliver it."" 

IT IT fucking IT! ""SHE is my baby girl!"" I wanted to scream. ""We have pictures where the ultrasound tech typed IT'S A GIRL! in all caps framed in my in-laws living room! You'd be delivering my little girl and there's nothing you can do!?!"" What came out was ""s-so can't you just sew up her cervix? Keep it from dilating any further?"" I became a little kid who doesn't understand medical jargon. ""You're a doctor, why can't you make them better?"" He was completely sympathetic and tried to put us at ease, but something kept telling me ""he's a stranger. He doesn't know shit. Take her home and everything will be fine."" I just held my wife's hand and cried. 

He had my wife moved to a delivery room and told her to just let it come naturally. I had sped her to the hospital ~9:00 that morning. Sometime around 6 that evening, the nurses dilated her all the way with some pills and a little later, the whole team came in to deliver our now-deceased baby. Luckily she didn't move or cry, because we agreed that might have clouded our judgement if the nurses would have wanted to try to keep her on a resuscitator. But that initial pain I felt got worse: she was just a healthy baby a little bit ago, but she wasn't a viable baby when she'd come out? If this would've just waited a few more weeks she might have survived? Nothing made sense. Since they were changing shifts, the night nurse was informed of our situation and came in to clean Harley, put her in some clothes they made specifically for pre-term babies, took a bunch of pictures and tended to everything my wife needed. I never in a million years thought I'd be okay with holding a dead child, but there I was. The nurse even took a picture of that, which irked me at first, but I guess I'm glad she was there to chronicle things, devastating as they were. We both stayed overnight but couldn't sleep. Down the hall there were new moms and crying babies, baskets and cards strewn about by celebrating families. We laid together in an empty room with a sympathy card crudely taped to the outside of the door.

We had a funeral. My wife's aunt used to work for a local funeral home so she bent a few guys' fingers to give us a deal on a tiny casket and service. She also worked with them to put Harley at the feet of my wife's grandmother's grave. I was fine with that. I never met my grandma-in-law but I heard she was awesome and would have laughed her ass off at having a great-grandkid named after comic books. The tight group of family we have showed up. My wife has a few aunts and uncles who all live in the same neighborhood so it's always easy to get the whole family together. My parents have been divorced for 11 years but they were able to be civil long enough to cry with us. An aunt I really hate showed up but this wasn't the time to shit on her. That was it. No friends came. No neighbors. No other well-wishers or people we were so sure would take an hour out of their Friday. The funeral procession looked like a group of tourists looking for a McDonald's.

So here we are now. My wife just went back to work. I lost my job because I took so much time off from the grief. She's having anxiety attacks so her doc suggested anti-depressants. She clings to me every second, which I suppose is normal, but her mood changes all the time. One minute we're happy and joking about the next time we try for a kid, the next she's angry and calling herself a horrible person because ""her body is all screwed up and fucked us out of a baby."" I'm here all day for her, at least until I can find another job (which seems impossible in this fucking redneck town I'm in). But I'm not all there. I stumble upon little things that just bring that pain in my heart right back and into a lump in my throat. The bills are stacking up. Neither of us had vacation time or bereavement time so all that time we took off was unpaid. The funeral was less than I had anticipated but still drained us. The only help we could get was from my in-laws, who cooked meals and bought us groceries for the proceeding weeks after our hospital stay; and my mother owns the house we live in so the rent hasn't had to be on time. But it's hard to explain to the electric company or the phone company ""I can't pay you for the month because I lost a baby at 21 weeks and refuse to get over it so my wife and I didn't go to work and cried like little bitches for 3 weeks and rather than let the hospital take care of her we just HAD to pay for a funeral so have some sympathy!"" etc. I'm just not sure where to go from here.

I don't know what to call this. I'm sorry it's so long and disjointed. There are support groups the nurses told my wife she can attend if she decides not to start the anti-depressants. But I don't have the luxury of that or a therapist or even a doctor (my wife has insurance but I don't). She left for work pissed at me because I'm so upset over our finances. Besides Harley, what else am I supposed to think about? I hate thinking about our dead kid as a financial burden, but that's where my mind goes every time I see an email from one of our many bill collectors or even when I have to stop at half a tank of gas in the car. Most of my family is apathetic because they don't believe she was an actual loss at such an early age. Fuckers. All I could say was ""go through it yourself first and then tell me what's a real baby"" which is weird because all my life I was pretty liberally leaning on things like abortion and the like. But this experience is turning me into a mess.

If you're still sticking with me, thank you for taking the time. I know I ramble and I format Reddit posts like shit. But I just needed an open ear from bros on Reddit and I hope you'll hug your kids once for me.

She pisses me off, I'll be nice and then I tell my wife what goof ball thing her mother said. Usually, what pisses me off is the ""shit that could always be done"" reminders. ""Does the baby need to be changed?"" Always... hes 4 months, incontinent and immediately pees in his diaper after changing. ""Can you take out the dogs?"" Sure I can, even though I let them out 30 minutes ago they could always go out. ""Do you need to go grocery shopping?"" Maybe I do need something or one thing. My mother in law praises the ground my wife walks on. My wife works 36 hours (12 hour) shifts, while I work 40-46 hours at my job. I come home after a long day and am given the child. I take care of him for a few hours to give my wife a break and then its co-care after that. When she works 12 hours at night, i watch him solely throughout the night and go to work in the morning. I bust my ass as a father and husband.

After a long weekend and long day where I watched the kid and then hung doors when my mother in law got to our house. Then watched him again and finally wife and mother in law wanted to watch some chick shows. I ask for some alone time. I go to my computer room and sit down and next thing I get is, ""can you change the baby?"" From my mother in law. I change him, nothing in diaper (no pee, no poop). 2 minutes later i hear, ""i think the dogs want to go out."" and at that point I had had it.I'm walking out of the computer room ready to tell my mother in law off when i hear, ""Babe the dogs don't need to go out."" And then ""Don't you ever tell my husband to do something again. Seriously, he busted his ass all day and you always nag him to do shit whenever he asks for his time. You don't get to tell him what to do.""

Very pleased is all I can say. Anyone have similar stories?

Edit: I should clarify the wrong way. The wrong way is when my mother in law is being a nag and I complain to my wife that what she said bothered me. Then my wife later just sucker punches her mother saying ,""STOP CHANGING THE BABY EVERY 10 MINUTES, I CAN'T AFFORD THE DIAPERS"". The problem with this tactic is that nothing positive really comes of it. My mother in law just shows up with two cases of diapers and continues what she does. My mother in law is pretty sensitive too, and this verbal K.O. pretty much throws her into a mini-depression fixed by shopping therapy (like cases of diapers). This is opposed to confronting her mother in front of me or backing me up when I say something to my mother in law (which I do) is so much more constructive and effective.",,False,self,t5_2rxue,1361296887.0,,,True,t3_18ttse,http://www.reddit.com/r/daddit/comments/18ttse/wife_stood_up_to_her_mother_for_me_the_right_way/,

He doesn't know what life waits for him outside. He was born 3 months premature in June and has still not left the hospital. He seems to be getting stronger all the time, but now there is one last step for him. He needs to have surgery today at 1:30pm central and it is going to be pretty invasive.

This is his last big step and afterwards he will be able to come home after recovery. This is both a blessing and a great fear for my wife and I. He had such a hard time getting off of the ventilator when he was first born that the idea of seeing him get put back on it is scary. We don't want a huge set back. We just want our baby to be able to come home.

I'm hoping for some well wishing. Maybe some good thoughts. It's already been a hard road and today my wife and I are so stressed we are taking it out on each other. I'm about to go cleanse myself and get things off my chest with her, but the fact is the stress will still be there until he is through with his surgery today and off the vent.

Be good to each other.

**Edit: He just got out of surgery and he is doing well. The surgeon found additional stomach issues that would have resulted in more invasive surgery. They were able to do all the work they needed to do plus fix his stomach issues. Now, aside from being out cold he is doing absolutely fine. The RT was laughing saying that he was breathing on his own already.**

**As for my wife, after I posted this I took a long breath and thought through all of my problems before going to talk to her. We apologized to each other and worked through our problems before sending him off for surgery. I appreciate all the thoughts, prayers and people offering to let me yell at them (that part made me smile). We feel very fortunate to have this little boy and to have each other.

1354730830.0,216,self.daddit,14c03n,"Meet Amelia: died at birth, brought back to life, and put into a hypothermic state. Now stable.",264,48,64,http://www.reddit.com/r/daddit/comments/14c03n/meet_amelia_died_at_birth_brought_back_to_life/,"On November 30th my wife called me at work around noon and told me she could not feel the baby move, and had not for the whole morning. She was 38 weeks pregnant and this concerned her because our baby was usually very active inside her. I rushed home to pick her up and I took her into the ER. Up in the labor and delivery unit they hooked her up to the monitors and gave her an ultrasound. The baby was not moving at all, and the ultrasound also showed that the umbilical cord was wrapped around baby's neck three times and had a knot in it. 

My wife was rushed to an operating room where an emergency C-Section occurred. Our baby Amelia was born with no breath or heartbeat. After 15 minutes of CPR the doctors were able to resucitate her. She was then rushed to the NICU while my wife was sewn adn stapled up (my wife had been put under). I was out in the waiting room, and as Amelia was rushed by I was told to follow to the NICU. In the NICU I saw that Amelia was breathing on her own but it was soon discovered that her body was in a precarious state. Her vitals were not looking promising and her levels were very low (of pretty much everything). A ventilator was put in and the doctors fought to get her glucose levels up. her heart was not working properly and her blood pressure was so low that she was put on meds for that. Other systems in her body were not functioning correctly. The doctors in our small NICU were not that experienced with cases like this (they mostly deal with premature babies). The main doctor consulted with the NICU of a larger hospital in a major city several hours away. It was discovered that Amelia qualified for an uncommon treatment where the baby is put into a hypothermic state for 72 hours that puts the body systems into a slower (sleeping) state. This allowes the doctors time to work on her, get her levels up, stabalize her vitals, and allows her brain (which was suspected of taking an insult) to receive the nutrients it needs instead of the other organs using up those nutrients.

Problem was that our hospital did not have the equipment needed to do the hypothermia treatment. So Amelia was airlifted to the larger hospital where she was started on the cooling treatment. In the meantime, my wife had woken up and was trying to recover. She was trying to understand why the baby was not there with her. We were both so afraid for the baby and worried that we might lose her.

After some convincing, my wife was discharged 24 hrs early (after day 2 past the surgery) and we drove to the hospital where Amelia was. We were not allowed to touch her because the heat of our hands could raise her body temperature by a fraction of a degree. The NICU was able to begin stabalize her, but she started having seizures. She was put on seizure meds, morphine to assist in sedating her (and pain relief), ventilator, blood pressure meds, catheter, sugars, and some other stuff I don't understand yet.

Amelia has underwent several heart echos and ultrasounds. Her belly was hard and that worried the NICU staff. Amelia was given glycerine to help flush a huge amount of stools that her bowels could not void due to the cooling treatment. (Bowels were not working). Amelia then started pooping out everything making her belly hard so that's great!

Yesterday the catheter, ventilator, morphine, and blood pressure meds were removed since assessments showed progress. Her body is finally stable but the big question now is whether she had any brain damage. Last night the 72 hours of cooling ended and she was warmed over 12 hrs to normal temps. She then had more tests and scans, including an MRI. The neurology team is reviewing the results today and we hope to hear some reports over the next day or so as to whether there is any brain damage that was detectable. 

We love this little baby girl so much. We are so afraid for her and we want her to have a happy life, even if she has problems. Crossing my fingers for the neurology report.

My pics of her are on my iPod so I will post again in the comments if I can figure out how. 


Edit: dec 6 hi everyone I promise to come back here to update. No wifi at hospital making it hard

Edit 2: 
my wife and I met with the neurologist last night. He gave us the news straight. The EEG did not show seizure activity but did show signs of a brain injury. Then he talked about the MRI results and said that Amelia's brain showed injuries on the left and right sides, at the back, cortex, deep into the brain. The results are expected to be severe. The likely outcome is called cerebral palsy which is the name of a spectrum of disorders that can range from a twitching finger all the way to wheelchair bound gross motor problems. I haven't learned much about it yet. The guy also said the part of the brain the controls vision was injured so Amelia will likely have vision loss or blindness. 

The actual extent of the disabilities won't be determined until Amelia starts to show symptoms or indications of her actual capabilities or in capabilities. 

My wife and I are quite broken up about this. We were up all night crying. Our 2 year boy is confused at our behaviour. We keep being told that there was nothing we could have done to prevent this but my wife feels overloaded with guilt at not knowing sooner that there was a problem. 

We are just afraid that our baby girl will have problems that will restrict or reduce her happiness. We want to provide her with the best life and he beer chance we can. She breastfed for the first time yesterday so that is a good sign. I am so tired I have to take a break from writing now. I read all your comments and really appreciate what you have all said l. I can't answer you all individually but I will read each comment. I will bring more updates as possible and when I have Time and energy I will put up more pics. She is so beautiful. We love her much.

Another edit: dec 6 around noon now. NICU called and said Amelia was physically well enough to ambulance her back to our home city's NICU. She has already left and we are trying to pack our stuff to follow her towards home. 

More edit: dec 9 baby Amelia is doing well, is down to one seizure med and has had her IV taken out. She is receiving all nutrients orally by bottle or breast. We are happy with her progress but are still afraid to discover what her limited abilities will be over the next weeks or months. She is still in the NICU but we hope to have her home soon.

Update Dec 14: Amelia was discharged from the NICU two nights ago. We are happy to have her home and happy to not be visiting the hospital so much. We have learned how to administer Amelia's seizure meds. We are doing exercises and stretches with Amelia's various joints to prevent stiffness and to improve range of motion and muscle tone. It's going to be a long and constant treatment process but it will be worth it I'm sure. We are doing all we can to maximize her potential. I am also grateful for healthcare system in Canada because the only cost to us for the whole thing has been food and fuel while we were on the road. The estimated actual cost of the medical care received to date tops a million USD (which includes the airlift and everything else).",,False,self,t5_2rxue,1355542619.0,,,True,t3_14c03n,http://www.reddit.com/r/daddit/comments/14c03n/meet_amelia_died_at_birth_brought_back_to_life/,

A few days after the tragedy, we're talking about increased security measures. We're not talking about mental health. We're not looking at access to health care and mental health care. As a parent, I honestly don't think stopping parents from going into the school will protect my kids. What's next, a wall around the playground?  

Finally, I think this will be a daily reminder to be afraid.

So, here's the story, and it explains the throwaway.

Yesterday my wife and I were out with the kids, just sort of window shopping and getting an idea of prices this holiday season.  Walking through the middle of the mall, we can across Santa seated on his throne, almost no kids there.  A little strange...but then I see why.  THIS Santa was only for people who were buying $40 or $50 dollar picture packages.

It's been a rough year financially.  We don't have the money for the picture packages but...it's Santa.  Santa.  The big red man himself.  Our kids, being 4 (TWINS) see him and immediately start to lose themselves in frantic ""SANTA!"" calls.  My wife, who knows my wallet contains exactly $5 for gas back home, starts to tear up and tugs them along.  My heart is broken, her heart is broken, the kids are upset.

""Santa's busy, baby,"" my wife says to one of them.

...So I look at the group that is my family, at the tears, and think about my pride.  Christ, the year had been rough, financially and emotionally.  Christmas is going to be sparse no matter what.  I just can't pull in the money we need, and we're struggling to meet bills, and none of my clients are paying what they're supposed to when they're supposed to, and now my kids don't get to see Santa because someone thought it was a great idea to only make him available to the parents with the additional funds to foot the bill...

""Hey hun,"" I say, ""Take them for a second, please...""

The family steps into a little store to look around, and I back trail to Santa.  I walk up to the ""elf"" and explain the situation:  We're broke.  We have no money for a picture package, and I can barely make ends meet much less pay for the photos...but my kids really want to see Santa.

There's a look to the big red man, who heard all of this.  A glance at the jolly old elf...who smiles and nods.  So I go get the kids and my wife.

""You can take a picture on your phone,"" one of the elves whispers to me as we walk up.  My phone?  Please.  It's a brick that barely makes phone calls, much less takes photos.

Bystander to the rescue.  An iphone is produced by a lady who overheard the whole thing.  The kids climb on Santa's lap, and we take the photo you see above.  He laughs with them, smiles, rubs their hair, tells them to be good for us, to go to bed on time.

My wife and I are both crying a little, smiling but sobbing.

As we walk off, my wife giving back the iphone and giving the lady our email address, I look at Santa and mouth ""Thank you.""

His answer is a very simple, and very genuine:  ""It'll get better.  Have a Merry Christmas.""

...We may not be able to buy them a game system, or hundreds of dollars worth of toys, but Christmas was made for my kids yesterday because of a mall Santa who I think may just be the real deal.

UPDATE:  Things got better...an this guy must have been Santa. Got a commission today for a piece, paid a grand...up front. I insisted I couldn't finish it fast enough to justify payment in full in advance. Guy told me to take my time but he knows everyone can use a little cash over the holidays. That pays the missing rent on my house and workshop, and frees up some money for Christmas...so wow...",,False,self,t5_2rxue,1354732527.0,,,True,t3_14a8ly,http://www.reddit.com/r/daddit/comments/14a8ly/santa_is_realtheres_a_story_here_and_i_really/,

""I see her head, she's coming now"" I park the car. She tells me to go get help. I sprint to the emmergency room, shouting something about baby crowning wife pt ccruiser. A gaggle of emts follow me out to my ugly mustard yellow car, where we find my wife, holding a screaming beet red little baby. 
""I gave birth"" she says (later, I would laugh at this statement and her rather relaxed , no pun intended, delivery).

They cut the cord, put the wife on the gurney, and we all went up to the maternity ward together, all happy and healthy.

I give him the bubble stick, let him dip it into the soap, and he slowly blows out a stream of tiny bubbles.  

The act of blowing bubbles requires the blower to take in a deep breath, and slowly let it out.  This is precisely how adult humans calm themselves down when emotional, right?  Take a deep breath and slowly let it go.  Blowing bubbles is basically baby-meditation.  Once I discovered this, his tantrums became pretty manageable----just let him take a few deeps breaths with the bubbles. 

It's like a baby-hack.  You force them to slow their pulse and heart rate down with breath control.  And, of course, bubbles are fun, which distracts the mind.  He has gotten very good at blowing them.

Try it Daddits, it works wonders for raging toddlers.",,False,self,t5_2rxue,False,,,True,t3_yw7o1,http://www.reddit.com/r/daddit/comments/yw7o1/a_trick_i_found_for_ending_tantrums/,

It was about 60F+ today when yesterday we had a high in the 40s or 50s.  As I biked into work, I thought about this previously cold and now immediately warm weather and remembered something my dad said when I was little.  ""You get thunderstorms and tornados when cold meets hot air.""  I knew we were supposed to get a thunderstorm this evening and low and behold we also got a tornado alert.  

I know it is simple weather stuff (my dad is not a meteorologist, just graduated from high school in the Philippines just after WWII), but it was really heart warming to have remembered something my dad told me and how appropriate that information was today.  My dad was a really savvy guy who always shared his vast knowledge with me [how to choose ripe fruit at the market, how to clean a pineapple, how to tie a tie (kind of weird because I'm a girl), how to talk to bureaucratic officials, how to parallel park, how to park on a hill, firearm usage and safety, and how to cook rice (super important because we're Asian) just to name a few], and as an adult, I am incredibly thankful for all his wisdom.  

My dad and I don't have a very emotional relationship, but the next time I talk to him, I'll have to tell him about how all the things he taught me when I was little stuck with me and has been useful at so many times in my life.  

So don't be shy about imparting knowledge to your little ones, because if they're anything like me they'll absorb and remember every thing you say and will surprise themselves later on in life with how much they learned from you.

**TL;DR**: My dad taught me a lot of things when I was little that I now really appreciate knowing.

Today...,218,46,30,http://www.reddit.com/r/daddit/comments/15rack/this_day_1231_last_year_my_wife_had_a_miscarriage/,"This day last year was full of melancholy and dread.  My wife miscarried a week after getting her first positive pregnancy test on Christmas day 2011.  We had been trying for a year, and as I'm sure most of you know, every month with a negative stick test was harder and harder to take.  But this.  This *amazing* gift of a positive test erased all that heartache.  2012 was going to be our year.  We were ecstatic to say the least.  We took the obligatory pics with the pregnancy test and started planning how long we were going to wait to tell our families, then friends, then the world.  One week later...it was over.  She went to the doctor's to be sure on 1/1/12, and found out she was indeed 4 weeks pregnant and had miscarried.  She slipped into depression and I...I had to be strong.  We were told to stop trying for a few months, but we didn't need to be told.  It was our decision.  Our choice was to avoid this pain for a while, if not completely.  We were happy in our lives together and wanted to remain so.  It wasn't until I took a personal day off from work during the first week of April that we really **talked** about it.  39 weeks later we were welcoming our beautiful [baby daughter](http://imgur.com/4yh0i) into our world.  I don't know why we're so lucky, but today, exactly one year after the lowest of the low, we get to spend NYE with the 3 week old love of our lives.  Life couldn't be better.  She's a joy.  2013 is going to be our year.  Thanks for listening.

If you can relate, brothers, then it goes without saying.  Don't take any moment with your kids for granted.  Have a great year.

My toungest twin son got sick last week. Pale and a bit less responsive. We didn't think too much of it when we drove him to the doctor, but that quickly changed and he had surgery where part of his small intestines were removed about a day later. They prepared us for the worst but he did fairly well, until they diagnosed him with epilepsy. Another blow in the face, but we were glad if he would survive and the epilepsy seemed to be under control with his medicines.

Today, brainscan results, very bad news. Severe braindamage, of recent occurrance, in cognitive and physical parts of the brain. Our son will be severely handicapped and his quality of life is unsure.

This is almost too much to handle, especially after a difficult pregnancy for my wife. She is devastated as well, obviously. 

The hardest part is that we see very little difference with how he was before. He listens and hears us, becomes calm when i sing for him and he looks at us when we're talking.

I find it amazing how much parenting has changed me as a person in many ways, but possible one of the coolest is the nearly superhuman level of awareness of my kid and the ability to predict the next 3 seconds based on her body language and surroundings. I assume I'm not the only one who has this power.  
  
I have a 15 month old girl who is a handful and a half; she is full of energy and curiosity and does not stop moving until it's time for bed. Even before she could crawl, she was a high intensity baby and would roll around often.  
As a result of this, I've saved her from certain injury so many times that it doesn't even take any effort anymore. I am able to anticipate a fall and gauge in nanoseconds whether it requires intervention or if I should treat it as a potential life lesson.  
For example, yesterday I was bathing her while my wife was in the next room. We're talking about Star Wars or something, and the kid starts to slip backward. Her head is almost completely submerged except for her face, but she is safe. I had anticipated this, and with lightning calm I was already grabbing the back of her head to stop her from going under. Meanwhile, the wife and I are still talking and I never even lost a beat.  
Another time many months ago, I was sitting on the couch with my non-breeder friend and my little roly poly baby. She leans a little too far and begins to roll off the couch; I subtly shift my leg to stop her. Nobody noticed the movement, and seemingly an eternity later, my friend gasps and leaps to grab the already-safe baby. The friend patted herself on the back, and I allowed her to feel like a hero for the day.  
So, I know this sounds like bragging, and yeah.. I guess it is. So what. I'm proud of my new superpower. ",,False,self,t5_2rxue,False,,,True,t3_17ahyc,http://www.reddit.com/r/daddit/comments/17ahyc/one_unexpected_part_of_being_a_newish_dad_is_the/,

The librarian demonstrated how to do the day's project and he asked ""do I have to do it exactly the way she wants me to?""  He was assured that he didn't, his eyes lit up and he came up with some very unique creation.  While the other kids were gluing paper hearts onto their things he cut a heart in half and used as a template to scallop the edges of his paper.

Best part of the story: there was another kid there who was mechanically following the instructions on how to do the project.  Ankle biter said ""you know, you don't have to do it exactly like she tells you to - you can do it however you want!""  The boy's eyes lit up and he asked his mom ""can I really do whatever I want with this?""  She said yes, it is a personal art project (but she was kind of reluctant about saying that) and the boy excitedly dug in making all kinds of alterations that could only come from the mind of an enthusiastic little boy.

The mom then remarked ""I've never seen him actually interested in working on one of these - he's never this excited to come here"".

This is about how we interact with our children.  It's been shown that children with both parents in their lives do better than children with one parent absent.  I think this is because the two parents see life differently and have different interests.  

There have been so many times that when I have been trying to do things with my kids and getting frustrated when it doesn't work out.  Everytime I'm like jeez it works for my wife, why didn't work for me?  For a bit I gave up trying.  That was probably the worst decision I could have made.  

After a week or two, I had to get back in there because I love my kids.  I stopped trying to be Mom and just be Dad. Whatever that meant. The hardest part was just going off and doing something with them, but without Mom.  Luckily (if you want to call it that) there are times when Mom works and I have no choice but to do something alone with them.  It started with just playing games in the basement or reading stories.  Having them help me make dinner, or clean up.  Then it branched out into outings.  Things like nature walks or trips to the zoo.   

That's how I realized that I shouldn't be trying to be Mom, but to be Dad.  I'm hoping this helps my other dadditors with their frustrations.  The good news is that you are Dad, not Mom and that's a good thing.  The bad news is you have to decide what that means for you.  The more comfortable you are in the activity that you are doing with kids, the more you will enjoy it. The more you enjoy it, the happier it will make them.  This is because instead of trying to get the activity right you will be trying to have fun with them.

I've developed a few shortcuts that I think other dads might appreciate, here you go:   

Put the kids to sleep in their clothes for tomorrow. Pajamas are overrated, bathe them, dry them, dress them in tomorrow's wear and you've cut a good 30 minutes off your morning prep.   

Frozen pepperoni, cheese, and ketchup with a dash of some sorta spice turns toast into pizza, that is what my kids prefer as their snack to take to school. 

A pressure cooker is your friend. You can throw everything you have in your fridge into the pressure cooker and 30 minutes later you've got something tasty. Way better and cheaper than fast food. 

If your kids won't eat vegetables then throw the veggies in the pressure cooker with a little moisture, blend the whole thing in the blender (don't burn yourself) with a slice of bread thrown in the blender, return to the stove and you have a silky smooth soup that any kid will eat. 

If you don't want your kids to cuss to much in public, cuss around them all the time and don't make a big deal of it when they try out the new vocabulary. The variability in usage of our most common swear words (think ""fuck"") makes it pretty hard for someone learning the language to properly implement, so kids will skip it rather than sound foolish, never realizing that there is never a bad time to say ""fuck"".  

Join the PTA, there are a lot of MILFs in the PTA. 

When you know your kids are listening, but when they think you don't know that they are, talk about how smart they are. You will have credibility, and they will have an expectation to live up to.  

Expose them to new shit all the time, don't ever allow them to think that ""different""=""bad"".  

Give your kids a sense of humor. I have often seen fathers who, when with their friends, are hilarious, but around their kids try and maintain a stern, strict demeanor (I may be overestimating the frequency of this, but it is definitely a thing, guys who were raised by a strict father who don't joke around with their kids, even though they are hilarious when with their friends). Fart jokes never get old, also, kids don't naturally do deadpan so fuck with them by often demonstrating some deadpan humor. If they pick it up, they will be the most popular kid in their school. Don't let them make jokes about you dying though, that's where you draw the line.  

Demonstrate affection. Even if you never get it anymore from your wife, you can still show them how to do it. Never fail to hug and kiss them and tell them you love them at the slightest provocation.

A team of neurologists has seen her, done MRIs, EEGs, given anti-seizure medication and other drugs. Nothing is stopping these seizures. They mentioned it might be dystonia. According to Wikipedia, ""treatment is difficult and has been limited to minimizing the symptoms of the disorder, since there is no cure available.""

She's a physical and emotional wreck. I've been shuttling back and forth between the hospital and home to care for our wonderful baby boy. She misses him terribly. We've gone from the joy of being new parents to the dread of dealing with a potentially life altering illness. 

Any words of advice for how I help my wife and son get through this?

UPDATE: Thanks so much everybody for your encouraging words and great advice. To answer the few of you who asked about bringing the baby to the hospital, they aren't allowing children to visit because of the flu epidemic. There's been no change in mom's condition. Thankfully our baby has been the sweetest, easiest infant to care for. He's a rock star. I need to be one too. Thanks again, all.

I just can't sit back anymore, I need to express somewhere and daddit seems like the place, if not Im sorry.

We're in our 30's (32/33). We'd have been trying for almost a year when we found out that my wife was finally expecting our first child.

About 2 weeks ago she started battling her typical fall allergies. This time, though seemed worse (probably because she couldn't take her usual Sudafed) mixed with the typical nausea that goes along with carrying a child. The night before Thanksgiving, it got to the point, where she could barely eat and was always on the verge of vomitting. Her OB suggested that we go to the ER and get fluids in her along with some IV anti-nausea meds. So away we went. 

Come to Tuesday, he called and wanted her in for a follow up. She went, and he did a ""lets be safe"" ultrasound, and couldn't see anything. So he sent her to our hospital where they could use (I guess) a more powerful u.s.

There the Dr, (after forcing her to look at the screen and SEE our baby) told her the horrible news that there was no heartbeat and no movement of any sort where the heart should be. She called me home, and yesterday morning they performed a D&amp;C on her.

I know it's only been a couple of days, but, every time she even looks at me, she starts bawling and apologizing (like she thinks it's her fault).

Everything I see on TV or hear on the radio has been mentioning new borns or baby names or some other variant of babies. Even while in prep for the procedure the hospital played a lullaby over the PA (they do that to signify a new birth as do most hospitals).

I've been doing my best at being as strong as possible for her. At this point I want to revert back to my early 20's, when something bad happened and drink myself to sleep every night, but, have been fighting it. 

I have been crying myself to sleep, which in turn, makes her start crying. 

Please tell me it gets better.....I feel like Im walking on egg shells, and Im afraid if it doesnt get better soon it may actually end an otherwise perfect marriage.",,False,self,t5_2rxue,False,,,True,t3_13zzss,http://www.reddit.com/r/daddit/comments/13zzss/wife_miscarried_on_tuesday_at_85_weeks/,

She is still pretty weak but has stopped using a walker to get around.

As for the cause, the neurologists have ruled out epileptic seizures and said it was more like severe muscle spasms triggered by electrical misfiring caused by a lesion deep in her brain. They have her on steroids to temporarily fix this, which has made her kind of aggressive and pissy. That was bothering me until I realized it's just the steroids and will go away as she's weaned off of them.

Basically this is like MS, but manifested in a very unusual way. The long-term treatment will be MS drugs, specifically something called Rebif. 

The neurologists actually say the pregnancy was protecting her and the end of the pregnancy and all the surging hormones caused these attacks to hit. The good news about the episodes not being classified as seizures is that she shouldn't lose her drivers license. In my state, you must be seizure free for a year before you can drive again.

We're not totally out of the woods, but we've definitely turned a corner. Thanks again to all who left such positive messages in my original post. You helped me through a really tough time.

EDIT: Now the big question we face is whether we'll try to have any more kids. At first we both said no, but now my wife is changing her mind. I might too. We'll see.

I know it may not sound like much but it was nice to feel like I could handle things and not have to rely on my wife to soothe him or whip out the boob.

First post here, and its more of a warning / vent than anything.

I'll try to keep it brief. Basically, in the mornings my wife leaves for work just as I'm waking up. We have a 2 1/2 yr old son. He wakes up while she's getting ready and he sits in bed while I'm slowly waking up or dozing between alarms. He's normally very well behaved and just hangs out in bed with me while watching his favorite cartoons. This morning I got up and went to the bathroom in our room. He normally just sits there in bed while I get ready as well. 

This morning he saw something of interest on the top of the entertainment center that holds the TV and decided he wanted to climb up and see it. We have one of those last generation big tube 32"" TVs in the entertainment center. :(

Suffice it to say, I heard a huge crash when I was in the bathroom and came running out immediately. My son was almost pinned underneath the TV. The furniture hadn't fallen, just the huge heavy TV. I scooped him up immediately and checked him all over. No bumps or cuts or anything! He was scared by the fall, but came out unscathed.

I know this may sound like horrible parenting, but in all honesty, he's never tried climbing that before and has always been very well behaved while getting ready in the mornings. I had no reason to be overly cautious when running to the bathroom quickly in the mornings. 

I just wanted to share this scary experience and remind all of you that it only takes a moment for something tragic to happen. Luckily our day moved forward with no problems, but it could have been a seriously horrible day.

Please, take a moment to check for certain dangerous things like TVs that could fall, etc. I know they make straps for flat panel screens to prevent children from pulling them over, and other safety measures like that. Just double check your surroundings when you can. I'd hate for this or something worse to happen to anyone else out there. 

Sorry for the chage in topic mood of this subreddit, but this event just happened to me and I wanted to just remind everyone of safety and checking certain things.

The hugs and kisses from my son were more sweet than anything imaginable this morning.

Be safe.",,False,self,t5_2rxue,False,,,True,t3_19mzrt,http://www.reddit.com/r/daddit/comments/19mzrt/seems_most_of_the_posts_on_here_are_nice_or_funny/,

We have a family history of very bad reactions to the pertussis vaccine. I ended up in the hospital as a child, as did my brother-in-law and my father-in-law.

Because of this. We're waiting for our little girls to get older before they receive the vaccine (so their body can handle it). My oldest daughter is 3, and we vaccinated her at 1 year old. My infant is 7 months, so we have another 5 months to go before we are willing to vaccinate her.

But thanks to the rising cases of pertussis here in WA state, and retarded mouth breathing hippie morons who don't vaccinate their children --- coupled with what the doctor was telling us, that it might be that adults need to start getting booster vaccinations so they're not carriers. Equals a recepie for sick babies.

**She'll be fine. We caught it in time and she's on antibiotics now. But still. It makes me very anxious, and worried, and very angry at the ignorant, selfish, and irresponsible nature of other human beings.**

The whole concept of ""my children aren't vaccinated and they're perfectly healthy"" is so unbelievably irresponsible and selfish it actually blows my mind. My little girl isn't really strong enough to fight any of these diseases your children may be carrying. So that's why we need to vaccinate everyone. So no one can be exposed.

Maybe vaccines worked to well? I mean think about it, they've worked so well that our generational short-term memory has completely forgot about what it was like before modern medicine and vaccinations. 

You pair that with media darlings and pseudo-science and you have a horrible comedy of errors.

Sorry for the probably ignorant rant, daddit. I'm just upset and worried about my little girl. And I guess some of that is coming out as anger. 

TL;DR: Fuck you Jenny McCarthy.

**EDIT: Thanks festering_fecolith! TIL that the whole cell DTP vaccine was what caused all my family members to be sick in the past, and that the modern acellular DTaP and TDaP is MUCH safer (but as a consequence, less effective)! If only I would have been less ignorant at the time.**

**EDIT2: After reading this CDC article: http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm6128a1.htm -- it would seem that it's a more complex problem than my initial rant (shocking right?). Not only is there a rise of pertussis cases in Washington State, but of those cases many of them *were current* on their vaccinations! This makes the problem even worse than thought. Not only is the vaccine less effective over time, but it may be even less effective to begin with. Add to that the anti-vac folks and it's a pretty terrible combination.**",,False,self,t5_2rxue,1345581661.0,,,True,t3_yl5u0,http://www.reddit.com/r/daddit/comments/yl5u0/my_infant_girl_has_pertussis_it_breaks_my_heart/,

Then he said he went to the Principal's office... I was a bit irritated because he's had a few issues at school and we've tried really hard to work through things. However, I stayed calm and asked him what happened.

He had been at lunch when he decided to ask one of the Lunch monitors if he could have a meeting with the Principal. After a while, it was time for his meeting with him and the Principal asked what he needed.

My Son said something to the effect of ""I really think we need to stop using styrofoam during lunch. When it gets incinerated (yeah... he said that) it puts poison into the air and that isn't good for us and the environment.""

The Principal said that he didn't know that and that he had taught him something new and he would like to look into it further.

I'm not sure if he will actually look into it further but one thing is for sure; My kids never ever stop amazing me.

My wife was literally holding down our 3 year-old while I administered a suppository into his little anus. He was screaming and begging us to stop, and we were both crying, knowing that we couldn't because he needed it so badly.

The kid holds in his poop like I've never seen before. His tummy is distended, and x-rays have shown compacted poop clear up into his intestines. And the response is always the same from the pediatricians, advice nurses, midwives, and others: change his diet, give him Miralax (or Senna), give him suppositories (saline or glycerin). The results of this are usually pretty rapid: he poops like a lumberjack for a couple days. We've cut out dairy, gone gluten-free, and given him gallons of prune juice.

Then he stops pooping again. I can only imagine that his anal retentiveness is due in large part to the horrid constipation followed by horrid diarrhea that has been the pattern for most of his life. I've tried to be a dad that praises farts, tooting, poops, and pee. We love biological functions at our house! But none of it helps.

I'm at my wit's end. And tonight's traumatic experience was the apex of 2.5 years of really crappy experiences. I want my son to play and be happy and not hate pooping. I want him to have one freaking day where his tummy doesn't hurt.

Out infant, who is heavily in the throes of sleep training, had already been put down for the night.  My wife was finishing rinsing a bottle when the blasted thing wrenched free from her soapy hands and bounced noisily around the empty sink.

We both cringed at the implications of the fumble, and a single ""wah"" came across the monitor.  The Mrs. and I froze, afraid to even breath lest we indicate even the slightest movement.  

In that moment, I finally made the connection: sleep training an infant is like living in Jurassic Park.  You go through great lengths to keep your presence hidden, and you make every effort to stifle your screams as you inevitably stub your toe on the damn swing that shouldn't even be in the middle of the pitch black bedroom (but I digress).  Despite your best efforts, though, you know that sometime, very soon, you will make a noise that alerts The Devourer of Sleep to your activity.  You know when you've roused it even before you hear it's fearful roar...

""Wah.""

In that moment, you rely on the only proven tactic: sheer immobility.  You stop mid-stride, and you hold your breath as you plead to any available deity.  Your fear mounts as you feel the creature's intense gaze scanning the room.  It's roars continuing until suddenly, they cease.

""Wah... Ah... eh..."" 

You have been spared, and you make no hesitation in your escape.  You breathe a sigh of relief, and you smile as you reach for the doorknob.  Unfortunately, your eyes deceive you.  Your hand connects with the door with much more force than intended, thus causing the door to vibrate loudly in the jamb.

""Wah.""

Anyways, all the kids come in and get on the stage and up walks our daughter and ""leads"" the pledge of allegiance (quotes because she asked everyone to stand and then proceeded to giggle the entire time we were reciting it). Then they do their little performance... phonetic alphabet, months in english/spanish, etc. Then they call the kids individually and give them their diplomas, say what they want to be when they grow up and give a little award for each kid (goofiest, most dramatic). Our daughter was last to be announced so the anticipation of what she was going to say she wanted to be when she grows up is building, kinda figure it's gonna be something goofy. She gets up there and they read what she said she wants to be... ""daddy's helper at work"", right in the feels! Then they give her award for brightest  in class! Hot damn!

1354899824.0,100,self.daddit,14g98r,My 2.5 y/o has been replaced by an evil midget.  Any advice?,118,18,82,http://www.reddit.com/r/daddit/comments/14g98r/my_25_yo_has_been_replaced_by_an_evil_midget_any/,"This is a kid who has always been the best kid in the room.  He's always been happy, articulate and loving.  He's impressed the hell out of me with displays of what seem like actual empathy at an age when most boys are hardwired to be sociopaths.  Every Day care staff member he was around would make it a point to whisper to me that he was their favorite kid ever.

Discipline could be handled with a sincere discussion where I could explain why we behave properly.  He would show regret for his actions, promise me it wouldn't happen anymore.  A hug later, he'd be reformed and I'd almost never have to revisit it.

About a month or two ago, we seem to have transitioned into the ""terrible twos"". 

The other night, he was spitting at his mother.  I picked him up and sat him in a corner to discuss the issue with him.  He continues to spit at me as I lean closer and let him know that I wasn't happy with his behavior.  He takes a swing at my face and spits again at me laughing devilishly the entire time.

Obviously, discipline got escalated a bit that night.

Recently, I've gotten reports from his school that he bit a friend and has been pushing smaller children.  He's been throwing tantrums and having breakdowns in ways that have been shockingly different than anything I've dealt with before.

I've had to revisit the standard rules of parenting (don't give attention to tantrums, time-outs by age, etc).  I'm told that this is a ""phase"", but that always sounds like a cop-out to me.  

What's going through his head?  Is it just an attempt to test limits?  

What can I proactively do to help him work through it?

Does everyone really go through this sort of thing? 

What can I expect moving forward?

**Edit:  I should add that while this started before, we informed him a couple of weeks ago that he was going to be a big brother.  He's only responded positively to this and while I expect to deal with regression and jealousy at some point, it seems a bit early for that.**",,False,self,t5_2rxue,1354906353.0,,,True,t3_14g98r,http://www.reddit.com/r/daddit/comments/14g98r/my_25_yo_has_been_replaced_by_an_evil_midget_any/,

At the end of the day Mom asked her ""So how does it feel to be 5?""

Tears welled up in her eyes as she responded ""I don't want to be 5, I want to be 4 forever!""

This seemed very strange as she had been very excited all day and in the preceding weeks about turning 5.  Mom asks, ""Why?  What's wrong with being 5 honey?""

An unexpected response followed, ""Well, If I keep getting older, then nana and papa keep getting older, then they are going to die and I will miss them.  I want to stay four forever.""

We both found this shocking.  What happened to our baby who's greatest life concern was the location of her favourite doll?  When did she start drawing these correlations between her passage of time and that of others?  Does she often think about the death of her elders?

I don't really have a question or anything...We've always been pretty open about death and the whole circle of life concept, it was just somewhat startling to realize that our little baby is struggling with issues of mortality.  

She grew up a lot more than I anticipated this weekend.

Our town has this star on the side of a mountain we light up every winter for about a month.  Tonight was the star lighting ceremony.  There were probably two hundred people gathered; as is tradition, we were singing Christmas carols in the run up to the actual lighting of the star.  The crowd started singing a carol I didn't know so I just ad libbed by singing a song I made up when my daughter was first born, pitched just for her ears alone (her head was nestled against my shoulder).  

After the song ended, she raised her head up and gave me the most wondrous look I've ever seen.  ""Daddy,"" she asked, ""all these people are singing about ME?""  

I can't describe well the purity of the look on her face but it was profound. She was astonished. It was utterly cute and heartbreaking at the same time.  It was a moment like you see in the movies. 

I couldn't take that moment from her, so said, ""They sure are, little one. You're a good girl and everyone knows it.  And I love you.""

I know he likes her more than me - but I cant resist asking about his dad (me) -

I say ""who is the best?"".  He thinks for a bit, then 


""What I mean is, I think there are probably better dads than you""


Perhaps should have laughed it off as the words of a 7 year old - but felt very sad, perhaps because it was christmas day.
