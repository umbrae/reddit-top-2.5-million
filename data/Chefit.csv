1375113630.0,28,self.Chefit,1ja6r2,Do's and Don'ts of posting an ad on craigslist (xpost from KitchenConfidential),33,5,14,http://www.reddit.com/r/Chefit/comments/1ja6r2/dos_and_donts_of_posting_an_ad_on_craigslist/,"I posted this in my local Craigslist not too long ago.  

Dear restaurant owners and operators, I have been browsing this section off and on for the last few years, and over that time I have noticed some things. I've heard many people complain that good help is hard to find, but let me tell you that a good ad is even more scarce. Here are a few pointers:

1. Include the name of your restaurant and its location. Most people want to know where they are applying to before they send out their resume, especially in a small area such as this. Name any restaurant from here to Boston and most restaurant employees can either name someone they know that works there or tell you about the last time they ate there. 

2. If you do not feel comfortable including your restaurant's name, at least give people a general idea of where it is. I can't tell you how many times I've seen an ad that simply lists the location as RI. I know it's a small state, but there is still a huge difference between Newport and Woonsocket. 

3. Be descriptive. Don't post an ad that simply says ""busy restaurant in Prov seeks cook."" Tell me about your place, and what you're looking for. 

4. ""Seeking an individual with experience working grill, saute, fry, and garde manger. Must be able to work independently. Starting pay is $10/hr."" If you want quality help, then you're going to have to pay for it. 

5. While we're on the subject of money, a line like ""compensation TBD"" means that I know you're going to try to talk me down to as low as I can possibly go, and ""Students welcome"" means that the pay is either pitifully low, or nonexistent. 

6. I can't pay my rent with valuable job experience, so you can't pay me with it. Don't get me wrong, I love what I do, but I also love having a roof over my head and gas in my car. You are on glue if you think that any cook out there is passionate enough about cooking to disagree with me on those points. 

7. DO NOT POST AN AD WITH ALL CAPS AND NO PUNCTUATION IT WILL MAKE ME WONDER ABOUT THE MENTAL STATUS OF THE PERSON I COULD POTENTIALLY BE WORKING FOR AND I READ IT AS IF YOURE SHOUTING AT ME.

8. Seriously, don't do that. 

9. Know the difference between a sous chef and a prep cook, and if you're looking for one, don't advertise for the other. 

10. Get back to people on time. Listen, I know that running a restaurant is a very time consuming and exhausting job, but this is 2013 and everyone except for my grandma has a smartphone. There is no reason why anyone should go three weeks without checking an e-mail, especially when you included that e-mail address in the contact info.",,False,self,t5_2s1da,False,,,True,t3_1ja6r2,http://www.reddit.com/r/Chefit/comments/1ja6r2/dos_and_donts_of_posting_an_ad_on_craigslist/,

1372556569.0,18,self.Chefit,1hcbo8,"Finally in a ""real"" kitchen and the job makes me feel guilty",21,3,26,http://www.reddit.com/r/Chefit/comments/1hcbo8/finally_in_a_real_kitchen_and_the_job_makes_me/,"So I am going to make this post rather short, I just need advice from some one who has been in a situation like this. I realize there probably isn't a answer to my problem, but still, maybe some one has something they can say to make me feel better about the situation.

First, a short bit about me: I love to cook, I love being in kitchens, I thrive on the stress of it all. Sadly, because I had no experience any time I tried to apply at a real restaurant I would always be turned down. So, because of this, I found solace working in fast food and actually enjoyed my time making fast food. Still, I wanted to work in a real kitchen and when I found my self needing a job because of a move, I applied at every place I could think of... including one of the most renown local restaurants in my new area.

Well I didn't get the job, I got an interview where I was told that since I had no experience in a kitchen of this caliber they couldn't use me. Well, I expected that and moved on with my life. I got another job which ended up being the worst I have ever had, so when I few months later I got a call from the renown restaurant I jumped at the chance of another interview.

I actually got the job this time, and have been working there for three days now, which is where the problem starts. I had expected this job to be my dream job, or if nothing else, a big stepping stone to my dream job. Any one you ask about this place goes on and on about how all the recipes are created by the owner and his wife, how the food is local and fresh etc. You know the spiel.

Turns out, none of this is true. Absolutely nothing about it is true. The food is frozen, the sauces are pre-made just add water sorts of things. The burgers are pre-formed things that they often neglect to season properly, hell the bread for their sandwiches is the cheapest bread available at the local super market and the meat they use on their sandwiches is oscar-meyer brand crap.

On top of that I am the only one there that follows proper hand washing procedures. I am currently being trained in how the store runs, but no one, not once, has mentioned cleanliness or cross contamination. Last night I watched some one make a chicken fried steak using the breading for the chicken (which I should add is a premade seasoning mixture) with out batting an eyelash. It seems like my old job in fast food was much cleaner and safer than this bloody place.

Now, being a part of this place I feel guilty being there. I feel like I am selling people the same crap I made when I did fast food, only at a huge markup. At least when I worked fast food I knew that the people that were eating it knew what they were getting, here I feel like the people are spending all this money just for the good view (the place is in a prime location).

On top of that I am worried that this place will ruin my chances in future jobs. Some day, when I leave this place, I will want to work in another real restaurant, a place that is what this place is supposed to be. Assuming I leave here with a good reference and some ""experience"" under my belt that shouldn't be too much of a problem. Yet, how do I explain when I get hired at a new place that I actually have no real experience? That the last place I worked was glorified fast food?

I know this could be stupid to post, and I hope my posting on this sub doesn't bother any one, but I just had to get it out there. I am so disappointed by this job that I almost want to apply at McDonalds and work there instead, at the very least I know a McDonalds is clean and doesn't lie about what it is... the only thing stopping me is that I really need the money.

I love having dinner parties because it is like playing pretend-chef for me; I plan my menu, make a prep list and even schedule the prep order based on needs, etc. 

It saddens me to read the amount of cynicism here, and on r/kitchen_confidential. It is clear that most of you are passionate about what you do, but the industry is terrible in terms of appreciation. I don't think I have come across a ""I want to be a chef"" thread that was met with a lot of enthusiasm for the OP, and that makes me sad.

So, chefs of reddit; I want you to know that I appreciate all the work you put into my dinner. I love eating out at all levels of restaurants, and regardless whether it is a kebab shop or a fine-dining place, if I like the food, I always tell my server to inform the chefs that it was fantastic. 

I appreciate the nuances of plating that you do, the way the sauce zig-zags to contrast the round edges of the meat, the way the mashed potatoes do not look like an anthill, the way the entire dish shows the attention to detail that you have paid. 

Those slightly different things you do? Yes, I get it. I won't even pretend to know what you did to make  your sauce so amazingly different from the other guy, but I get it and I love it.

Whenever there is an open kitchen, I try to catch the chef's eye and give him a bro-nod and a smile. Sometimes I walk up there and tell everybody behind the counter, ""you guys are amazing, my food was perfect,"" because I know you all did your little part in assembling my plate of deliciousness. 

Chefs of reddit, I can't see your open kitchens or taste your food, but I want you to know that there are people like me who really, really, appreciate you. If I could do something about your working conditions and salary, I would. I have often contemplated opening a restaurant (as a management person, I'm not even going to consider putting myself in the kitchen) and all I can say is that I will make sure my kitchen staff know I appreciate the shit out of them.

Team building and food quality/consistency are my main tasks right now, because everything else is more or less going smoothly. 

Except the executive chef is a raging alcoholic, and lately it has been causing some problems. The owners are either unaware of it, or are choosing to turn a blind eye because they feel comfortable with him. Mr. head chef has been showing up 2, sometimes 3 hours late and is continuously relying on me to pick up the slack. Now, I don't mind going above and beyond the call of duty if I have to. I have no problem with showing up an hour or two earlier so everything can get done. But I am getting sick of the chef getting hammered every night and coming in hungover, tired, and basically worthless. I'm talking 3-5 cigarette breaks an hour kind of worthless.

Considering how often he drives home drunk, it's a wonder nothing bad has happened yet. Many times when he is running late, we ""joke"" about checking the hospitals and local jails to see if this is finally the day he crashed into something/someone the night before. But lately it's been more of a serious concern, rather than a joke.

He also just hired his recovering meth addict friend who is literally going through withdrawals on the line. I feel like the chef brought this guy into a very bad environment, considering his past addiction problems. Every night I leave, I feel like I'm walking away from a slow moving train crash. 

Any thoughts on similar situations or advice is appreciated! I'm not trying to get anyone fired or anything. But I am genuinely concerned about the future of the restaurant if it continues to stay the course it's on. Thanks for reading, if you read it all.

I am perplexed. I'm finishing my externship here in Boston in two days. I enjoy reading the reviews on my externship to see if anyone talks about this or that. What I have noticed however is that mostly the bad reviews are all extremely horribly written. Misspelling the restaurants name and even the street is on. Don't get me wrong, my spelling/grammar isn't the greatest either...but how can we be judged by someone who spells swordfish as swurdphish or someone who complains that their entree was too hot?

This really got me thinking.

People love to write and read bad reviews, it gives them a sense of superiority. A false egocentric attitude that they believe is justified because of what they have experienced in their lifetime without knowing what it is like to be dying in a kitchen. A cook is nothing more than a glorified domestic servant that has transcended to be seen on the same level as an artist. Thus, we have become judged by ""foodies"" and critics who's only activities is to consume, judge, and indulge in gluttony. But who are they honestly?

I have the experience and the skillset to run this type of kitchen, but I have not opened an establishment before.

(1) What do you think the biggest priorities should be when opening a new establishment from the chef's perspective? What priorities should be secondary, tertiary?

(2) What are some ""textbook"" mistakes that people make in my situation? What are some ways to avoid these common pitfalls?

(3) What are some ""textbook"" mistakes that owners make when opening a new business? When should the alarm bells start going off?

(4) Do you have any favorite resources you use for staffing, procuring equipment, and planning the flow of your new kitchen(s)?

(5) Is there anything else I should know that is not covered by the above questions?

I am using an Excell spreadsheet with an inventory template off Restaurantowner.com.  Should I cost out each recipe and just add the values in as the order unit and price, or should I be linking the cell to a separate recipe costing sheet?

As a side note, prices at the market change frequently throughout the month (sometimes daily), this combined with the language barrier make it very time consuming to keep prices to the penny.  Any ideas for getting as close as possible without my head exploding?

When I see TV chefs cook, they just wipe their hands on a towel between ingredients, only washing if they handle chicken. I guess my main question is, is that what real chefs do too?

And if so, doesn't that leave your hands sticky and everything you touch with a residue? I feel like if I get lemon juice or oil on my hands, no amount of dry-towel wiping will get them actually clean. If don't wash my hands and touch the handle of a cupboard, or a knife, it's going to get that sticky/greasy.

I'll see a chef on tv season the meat and flip it with their hands, then go directly to grinding pepper or reaching into a bowl of kosher salt.. isn't that going to contaminate your shit? Just a TV shortcut?

I also don't know any CSS or anything like that so it's sort of hard for me to make this place look real official or whatever.

Anyway, someone recently requested that I put the list of food subreddits on the side. To be perfectly honest, I think [/r/food] and [/r/cooking] both suck and are giant circlejerks; which is the primary reason I created this subreddit. 

So I'm thinking of making a worthwhile list. KitchenConfidential, askculinary, and fooddev will definitely be there. Are there any others you'd especially like to see there?

Also, I need someone else to be a mod. With 1k people here and the spam filter filling virtually everyday and my hectic work schedule I could use a little help. Apply here. The person who makes me laugh the hardest will probably win.

It used to be situated primarily in the middle of my back but has now moved to the lower area as well as my hips and the psoas region. The kitchen I've worked in for the past four years does not have mats so there's no cushioning. I basically cycle through a bunch of cheap cast off shoes I get at thrift stores supplemented with CVS-bought sole inserts to lift my heels a bit and support my arches.

My back doesn't hurt at work but once I get home and sit down and relax it is very painful for the first 30 minutes or so. For the first time in a long time I'm looking to invest in a very good pair of shoes that will make my back feel good again, or at least keep this problem from getting worse. I don't care about how the shoes look at all. Protection would be a bonus but I've worn canvas shoes to work so obviously that's not too high up on the list.

Thoughts? Suggestions? Right now I'm looking at croc-style shoes but I have no idea how comfortable they are and whether they'd work with soles. On the plus some of the guys at work have them and they like to gather tribally at the dish washer and run their shoes through once in a while. It's kind of endearing in a David Attenborough-ought-to-narrate-this kind of way because they're all standing around on white linen napkins staring at each other trying to pretend this is what normal people do.

UPDATE: I went with the [Shoes For Crews Santa Cruz](https://www.shoesforcrews.com/sfc3/index.cfm?changeWebsite=US_en&amp;route=c_store.viewDetailsOfProduct&amp;partnumber=6044&amp;size=) model. I have pretty wide feet and usually wear extra wide skates when I play hockey, for instance, but decided to go with the regular size on these and they are very comfortable. The inserts that came with them were big and very padded but I ordered the [Powerstep Pinnacle Inserts](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001334X88/ref=oh_o01_s00_i02_details) so I replaced the SFC ones. 

The difference in my legs, back and even shoulders after 10-12 hour shifts is amazing. My lower back and hips aren't as tight - they're still pretty tight, but it isn't debilitating - and my feet feel pretty good. The arch support makes a difference. I never thought I had flat feet, and I'm still not sure if I do or not but having that support means that at the end of the day my feet feel like they're only been working for a few hours.

The difference has carried over into my sleeping patterns and my off hours. There's a lot less back pain, which in turn has allowed me to stretch much more comfortably. I have always been very flexible - splits both ways - but for the past 3-4 years it's been difficult to stretch my back simply because I felt there was no real progress plus it was very painful. My sleeping patterns have changed considerably, as well. I'm going to sleep earlier and more importantly waking up earlier.

This is just the first combination of shoes/inserts I've really put some thought into and it's only been a month, but spending $50ish on this combo was a great investment.

I’m 19 now, and I've worked in 6 different kitchens never for more than 5 months. This is the result of it being summer work, legitimately not living up to expectations (my first full-time attempt, insomnia intervention at my fourth location), or in one example an owner who fired me on the spot when he heard through the grapevine I was going to hand in my 2 weeks’ notice as I was going back to University. I’ve only worked at one establishment that ever rewarded employees with upward mobility, and while they wanted to bring me on the line I had to attend University in a different city.

At all of these places I've worked, I tried to learn as much as I possibly could, but since I was categorized as just the dishwasher other than prepping food for the line when the kitchen was buried and I've been granted any on-hand practice. I love cooking, I love this industry, and I don’t want any other job. I've let all of my employers know I want to cook, and that I’m passionate about food, but none have given me the chance. I KNOW the hours, stress, no-social life, work fast, work hard, and don’t fuck up horribly routine that is the kitchen.

My problem is that I simply can’t get work as a line cook, apprentice, garde mange, or even prep, as one look at my resume screams dishwasher, and there are always more experienced applicants getting ahead of me, even when I ace the interview. I want to work at an establishment long-term, I’m not moving anymore or switching schools or quitting because I’m a student. I live in Guelph, Ontario, where there are approximately 207 restaurants and I need to convince one of them that I will work relentlessly and learn rapaciously and that my inexperience isn't a risk. At the very least, get a dishwashing position where my employer would be willing to train me later on.

What would I put on my resume? What would my cover letter look like? Is my one reference from a previous sous chef enough? When applying in person, what are some arguments I could make in my favour?

I'm the Chef de Cuisine at a busy family restaurant in a popular tourist destination. My current pay is about $1060 / week. Our restaurant's GM (who is also a partner) recently hired a full-time manager for the dining room. I assist in doing weekly payroll for the restaurant, mostly just watching for kitchen staff getting too much o/t. Well, our internal payroll sheet has what the management makes. The information is right there and it's impossible to not see it. 

So, I just found out this new hire is making $1200 / week. I know it's petty, but I'm sitting here thinking of all the extra work I've put into making this the best restaurant it can be. Since I started at this place, we have collected more local accolades that the rest of the restaurants in our group COMBINED. You'll just have to trust me when I say the GM and the other partners have no reason to dislike me or devalue my work. 

I've worked in this industry for ten years, but only for four years as a manager. I want to defer to my older colleagues on this one. Do I dare mention this to the GM? I feel like I was just slapped in the face! Is it wrong to feel that way? Am I being an asshole? 

Thanks in advance.

EDIT: (Update 1)

Thanks for everyone's replies. I think that I will be confronting the GM about it, but it is more to satisfy my own curiosity. Why is this guy worth an extra $150 / week? What does he bring to the table that I don't? What can I do to get there?

I have two questions about spherification; one problem and one hypothetical how-to.

The problem: 

Blackberry puree thinned slightly with sugar, 3.6g calcium chloride added per 140g. When I put in a 1g alginate/100g water bath, the spheres are sticking together making them very hard to plate. Should I use the straight-up spherification (calcium bath) method instead? I'm basically making them to order, so holding isn't a concern. In addition, the caviar isn't so much forming actual spheres as it is blobs. Is more calcium the answer here?

Second question:

I'm working on a dessert which will include encapsulated chocolate folded into a mousse. The concern I'm having is, how do I keep the chocolate liquid? I figured melting and then thinning with grapeseed oil should work, but may result in an unpleasant texture on the tongue.

One afternoon I was working pantry station, and the fryer oil needed changing. After lunch I turned off the fryer, and asked the line cook where the oil was, since this was my second time doing this, and the other pantry chef had gotten it for me the first time without telling me where it was.

 He went  downstairs and came back up and told me there was ""plenty"" and he told me the location. I proceeded to empty the fryer of it's oil into the bin outside.

After thoroughly cleaning the fryer, I went downstairs to the location to discover there was no fryer oil at said location. Oh fuck. Did I fuck up? I ran upstairs and asked the location again, thinking maybe I got too high before work and I just forgot. Wrong. I was right. 

I asked him to go look again. He came back up and called me an asshole, and said to look again real hard, and if I missed it he'd hit me.

I went back down and realized his mistake; we used shortening fryer oil, we had cases of crisco next to for baking.

We unfortunately that afternoon had a party that included 3 sammiches that had a side of fries. We tried to contact all our purveyors. No one could help up. We were in a far off location so there was no way we could get to Restaurant Depot in time.

We went out to the oil canister, filled up pots of oil and filled the fryer.

It was the worst smell you could ever imagine.

I've been working in the restaurant industry for 11 years and have only held two jobs during that time.  My last position was with a very high volume restaurant as AGM.  I started out in the kitchen at both jobs and have considerable line experience.  To the best of my knowledge, I've done everything a chef would normally do, except I really haven't had the chance to create and develop recipes like I feel I need to.  I've only worked with a couple low-level chefs, and I don't feel I've had the proper 'side-by-side' with an experienced chef that I need to complement my management experience.

My first question: My management style is all-encompassing.  I like to know everything it takes to make a company run.  I've had a couple management interviews, nothing too appealing, and I've noticed a complete dissociation between BOH operations and FOH operations.  That's not to say that it didn't work, but it seemed the Executive Chef worried about the kitchen and the GM about the FOH.  Is this common in typical high-volume restaurants?  (Remember, only two jobs in my career)

My second question:  I don't have fine dining experience.  I believe I am able to put out high quality food, but I do not have the center-of-the-plate background.  I learn extremely fast and am always eager to learn.  I believe the next step in my career is to get into a fine-dining establishment, and try to maintain as a line cook instead of falling into management.  In my eyes, it might be the best way to learn and gain that fine dining experience I need to round out my résumé.  I think I could probably bullshit my way into a sous chef spot, but I think working as a line cook will be more beneficial.  I think my ultimate goal in the future is to have a company of my own.  I would like to be as good of a chef as I am (or like to think I am) a General Manager.  What would you guys suggest to be the path I take towards becoming a chef at this point in my career?

Two separate dining rooms, two different menus, one kitchen. Ok so now you get a feel for where I work and you can probably imagine the controlled chaos I manage every day. So we are short staffed. Everyone is working 12 hour days with one day off. Our head grill guy got hauled out of the kitchen by the police and is sitting in county lockup. We need to staff up fast and we have exhausted our resources. So a guy comes in looking for a job. He said he just moved to town and had experience and wanted to know if we were hiring. So my KM set up a stage for him the next night during my shift. I was going to put him through the ringer, having him do a dish on every station to see how much he knew. So he comes in early the next day (a plus) for his stage and I have him help me prep a few things and get to know him a little bit. This kid was country, I mean backwoods, uneducated, country. His name was Travis and he had about as many teeth as he did IQ points. Whatever I've worked with worse. So we start his tryout at fry and thats about as far as it got. He made his first mistake when during a lull instead of cleaning or helping out other people he stood in the corner and played with his phone. Thats a big no for me. During a stage you should be trying to show me why you deserve this job and being lazy is not the way to do that. So then he started talking about how much money he was going to make. This is another big no for me. Money shouldnt even be discussed until I offer you the job , until then your focus should be doing the best you can and learning your dishes. It didnt end there. In between leaning on the cutting board and playing on his phone he started to bug my other cooks about how much they made and stopped doing anything besides dropping fries. So I've already decided this guy is a no but decided that since he was there and we were paying him in a burger and a beer, he could at least drop a fryer. So I get out the filter cone and explain tha t we filter into the small pot and when it gets full we empty it into the big pot but not to fill the big pot up all the way, leave some in the small pot so its manageable. It took him about an hour to complete this simple task. While he was finishing up i stepped off line to do the produce order. Came back up and now hes trying to figure out how to clean it now that its empty. So I show him how to scrub and rinse out the fryer and head downstairs to get towels to clean with. The door to the room where the towels are is always locked. Only the GM has the key so you got to jimmy the lock to get it open. Im way behind schedule because of this hick in my kitchen and I couldnt find a butter knife so I grabbed the first thing I saw, a filet knife. I forgot all the house knives had been sharpened that day and as I was trying to get the door open the knife slipped and I felt it go deep in my pointer finger. So now im bleeding all over the place and go upstairs to see if FOH gas towels and I get upstairs and that stupid fuck has filled the big pot all the way to the top with hot fryer oil and now he cant lift it up. At this point I just wanted this guy out of my kitchen so I wrap a rag around my hand and told him to get one side and I grabbed the other telling him not to let go. We start to get the pot up, im bleeding bad but focused. I keep telling him not to let go. We get the pot onto the edge of the fryer and he realizes just how hot and heavy this pot is and lets go, spilling an entire fryers worth of hot oil all over the floor.  I run downstairs grab a bunch of salt and get upstairs to try and clean this mess up and when I get back I see hes dumping flour all over the place making an even bigger mess than the one we already had. At this point I just told him to get the fuck out. Stage was over. Know what he had to say? So do I still get that beer?

Some of our most popular experiences are the culinary ones. We bring on talented chefs, create an awesome themed meal and personal access to the chef that they can't get anywhere else.

The chefs we have worked with in the past love it because it takes them out of the restaurant and lets them engage with guests in a new way and help develop their personal brand (not to mention earn good money).

FYI, we are not a Groupon or Living Social type site. People pay full price for these unique experiences and we pay our chefs (and other hosts) well.

**My question to you:**

What would be the best way to go about finding new and talented chefs that would be interested in something like this?  It's a freelance / part-time gig. A lot of the chefs we have already are working in other restaurants.

I know chefs are notoriously busy and are approached every day from Groupon-like sites.  

Are there other ways to present this offer to them?  Any culinary-specific job boards that we could post on?  

Any advice you could provide would be much appreciated!",,False,self,t5_2s1da,False,,,True,t3_119e2j,http://www.reddit.com/r/Chefit/comments/119e2j/chefit_im_hiring_chefs_on_a_regularly_basis_and/,

A good friend just finished her course work at the Virginia College Culinar in Savannah GA, and is now staging at a new kitchen in Tybee Island. In doing some research I've found that it is relatively affordable. (I don't have the $60,000 for the 'same degree' at CIA) She really loved the program and seemed to learn everything she needed to know for an entry-level position at a fine establishment. I'm not here asking if I should go to culinary school, but rather asking if I should look for a more prestigious but albeit school? Or will it matter at a potential interview?

My intention was to cook it on high until the skin crisped up then reduce heat and slow cook it. Am I in any danger of overcooking it if she runs late? Should I just reduce heat or will it still dry out? What about adding liquid to the bottom of the roasting pan to braise it? Any tips for keeping me flexible would be much appreciated

2)since its just the two of us, its a small cut of belly, only about 1 1/4 lbs, all the recipes and examples I researched it was to serve 4 or 6 so I'm curious how this will affect the overall cooking time?

Problem one; too soft, melted too fast. Adding more gelatine to the next batch, should be fine.

Problem two: the acidity in the mango seems to be curdling the cream after it has been in the fridge for more than ~4 hours. I think a way around it will be to use coconut milk instead of cream. Will that also curdle? Any better suggestions?

Any Advice?

*Edit Update    Few things i have learned as a trainee.

You are always in the way..doesnt matter where you stand.  you are in the way.

The dish guy is your best friend.  Learn his favoriate drink and food.  Make them.  Offer to pay for his kids college..  You will learn his language that night.

When you hear ""Hot behind""  Do not turn, do not attempt to look,  Suck in your gut and get closer to your counter.

Here are the 30 standard recipies.  Memorize them...now.  You will never make them, Customers will customize everything, but you will know them.

Between 5:30 and 7pm on Friday,  do not attempt to help, your chef will anticipate the order before its finished printing,  he will know exactly what is on it and have it 1/2 complete before its finished printing.  And the ticket printer..its under that counter..over there, out of sight, but he will still know whats on it.

Chef language will make sailors blush.

Find the mop and broom.  That is your job.  Love it.

If you need to break down,  The back of the freezer is good spot, right under the fan where the water is dripping.  5 min there and the pain goes away.


**I never quite understood why people do this, the pain of constant moving, stress..etc.   But Now i get it.  It hurts, its hot, the orders suck....but call it whatever you want...its fun.

* are food truck meals less complicated to cook because the menus are generally simpler? 
* is the kitchen environment more hectic because of the confined space? Or is it more relaxed 'cause it's just you and maybe one other person in a truck. 
* do you have to worry less about presentation? 
* have you seen less experienced cooks or those who haven't gone to culinary school be able to handle running a food truck better than they would a restaurant kitchen?

I’m a young chef who just got fired as the Executive Chef from a local restaurant. While I was looking for a job I was approached by an investor with no professional experience and belief that starting a food cart operation with me would be successful. In return for my experience and knowledge he is fronting the upstart cost solely.
The concept:
With limited space and cooking surfaces I thought homemade gourmet sausages were a good choice. Some examples would be a tempeh sausage with a miso slaw. Wild mushroom (morel, Portobello, oyster) sausage with beef, roasted red peppers, goat cheese and finished with a honey/truffle aioli.  Jalapeno, bacon and smoked cheddar topped with full bodied red wine pickled onions. Everything would follow a similar formula: 1 healthy, 1 upscale-ish and 1 “Americana”. We would also offer black board sandwich specials and an assortment of unique fries. Sweet potato with maple ketchup, purple fingerlings with Andouille ketchup, yucca with banana ketchup ect. We would offer fresh juice, fresh brewed iced teas, house made komboocha and h2o as beverages. The fresh juices from frozen, but nothing but the h2o ordered out of house. We would work tightly with relations I have already built with local farmers and vendors. 
The request for advice:
To those of you who have worked in a street vendor situation what is the best way to get the ball rolling and what problems have you faced in the startup of the process? I live in R.I. so permits and licensing aren’t as big of a hassle as other areas in the states. How did you market your product? Do you have many repeat customers… and if so how did you choose your locations? What are the most important things to look for in my cart? Does my concept sound appealing to you as a possible patron? Can I preform my prep on site or will I need to rent space? How long did it take you to earn a profit? How many people do you serve a day on average? Please describe your area when answering this question.

You guys have been helpful before and I appreciate any input. Thanks for your time.

That may probably be a really cliche thing to say, but I really want that. I spent all of my time in high school planning to follow that dream, until my senior year when I foolishly convinced myself that it wasn't worth it and that I needed to get a degree to use for a 'real' job. Now, I'm a few years out from high school and I think I've decided that I want to chase that dream again.

I'm currently attending Georgia State University and plan on switching my major to a business degree to give myself some background and a safety net to fall back on in case things don't go as planned. After that's done, I would then plan on putting myself through culinary school. If opening my own restaurant isn't in the cards, I'd love to just work in the business in an everyday setting, using my degree.

My question is, is this the right path to achieve my goal? Getting a business degree and then putting myself through culinary school? I just got a job serving at a pretty high end restaurant that is about to open up here in Atlanta, and I hope that that can help me make connections in the industry.

The reason I ask this is because I do not have 150k to drop on the CIA and I understand that a school's reputation does not determine your skill level after graduation. I understand that you get what you put into the program.

I live in Northern NJ and NY is literally 10 minutes away and i was wondering if anyone had any experience with cooking schools in this area and what a complete novice like me can expect? 

Should I learn something or read or practice something before even applying? 

Do most culinary schools take into consideration S.A.T scores or do they not care about any of that?

I'm 24 and i have absolutely no experience in the food industry and have never gone to any school after high school. I wanna pursue a career of cooking because its something i was always interested in doing and i like cooking at home (which is apparently worthless as soon as i get into school).

So, I'm looking for advice on my situation on whether or not to pursue a career in food. I've loved cooking since I was 6 or 7, and I'm 33 now. I have not really done much in the way of anything professionally, floating from this job to that job and not really excited about any of it. A couple years ago, I did fry cook, and sous at a upscale grocery store deli, which by no accounts is as high pressure as what some of you guys go through. I got promoted to Cheesemonger after awhile there. Both positions were very fun for me, the former being a lot harder work than the latter, but much more satisfying. 

Being 33 though, I was told by one or two people that starting out being older than your average person starting I'm not going to make it and that I shouldn't try at all. 

Honestly though, nothing excites me like food does. It's something I can see myself doing in 5 years (and further out of course), no other industry has that sort of appeal to me.

I'd like to go down the route that eventually leads to executive chef, and I am willing to start at the bottom of ladder. However, due to my age, should I just bag this plan entirely? If not, what sort of things should I be careful to avoid or work harder at than the younger people in the business? Should I go really bottom of the ladder and seek dishwasher positions or would you recommend another position?",,False,self,t5_2s1da,1356674591.0,,,True,t3_15jqug,http://www.reddit.com/r/Chefit/comments/15jqug/advice_sought_for_starting_in_this_business/,

Brand new everything. Owner has zero experience operating a restaurant and has zero experience with kitchen work. I'm the weekend cook, and we have a pretty good ""chef"" for the weekdays. She controls most of what goes on as she is there most of the time. She does orders and most of the other chefly duties.

I am alone on my shift and it runs from 6am to 4pm. We open at 7 which means I have 1 hour to prep anything I need for the day. Last weekend was probably one of the worst days in my 8 year career. I managed to barely get through Saturday but Sunday was horrible. Service started at 7:30am and didn't stop until 3PM. I've never done a 7 1/2 rush. This was partly due to how slow the food was going out (Due to me only having two hands) and never really being able to catch up.

Around 2pm my prep was gone. I went through 20lbs of potatoes, half a box of bacon and I had to 86 anything with chicken. Lunch began at 11 and I had run out of thawed patties (We do scratch patties) and I was pulling from frozen for most of my items. My mise was completely drained and I had zero time to replenish any of my sauces. At this point I'm quite frazzled and I am losing my grip on any sanity. I tell the owner I need help and calls in the weekday cook. Well, there's really nothing that she could help with besides thaw the patties and prep some minor items (like romaine, slice tomatoes, ranch, etc). She takes over and I go outside for a much needed break. 

The whole attitude changes when I get back, as we were entering the tail end of the service. Nobody would really talk to me partly because I had almost completely shut down at that point. I've never run into this problem and on the surface it appears that it is possible to do with one cook, but I was just unable to. The weekday cook likely puts up with much less as we have a huge amount of traffic during the weekend.

I want to know if this load is acceptable and if I should be able to be prepared and able to complete these services. I am losing my confidence and feel very nervous going back into the fire tomorrow. I don't know how I should prepare. I've always had linemates with me during my career and I feel that it is a necessity that one be provided. Does anybody here have some advice on how I should approach this? Am I just not good enough? Because that's how I feel. I also feel like the weekday chef doesn't understand the volume I am going through. I am a third year apprentice with substantial line experience and this had made me question my abilities.

I had taken a sabbatical from my current restaurant to accept an offer to run a bar.  I was gone for about a year when I saw an ad on craigslist from my old restaurant looking for a KM.  

My old chef was gone but two of my old co-workers had been promoted to kitchen manager.  The owner was opening a third restaurant but needed more kitchen help.  He instantly hired me back as a co-KM at the restaurant I -reviously worked at.   

It was a very smooth transition because I already knew everything about the restaurant.  Things were going great for a couple of weeks until my co-manager figured out that anything he didn't do I would have to do  make up for because I actually cared about the job I was doing.  It slowly degenerated until the owner stepped in and dismissed him for not pulling his share of the load.

Now finally this is where my question for some of you more experienced chefs comes in.  When he dismissed the other co-manager a cook was promoted again to be co-manager.  Even though he makes the same amount of money as me I do all the product ordering (food and beverages), the scheduling, labor costing, menu item pricing.  

Also the same thing is happening as before, he is doing less and less and I am doing more and more.  What should I do to remedy this situation?  Ask for a pay raise and title change, instruct my co-manager who technicallly isn't a subordinate to get his shit together (not worked so far), or something else I haven't thought up yet?

Update:  Thanks for the responses.  I went to owner with issues and he had a meeting and cleared up the problem.  I am now sole kitchen manager, and have gotten a special bonus plan where if the restaurant does well enough and my costs stay low enough I'm up for monthly bonuses.

Nobody else can follow a recipe or make plates consistently, so the chef probably won't let me do anything that requires much effort from anybody else. The filigree was perfect because they just have to pop it on plates whenever they feel like, and I make it for the whole week at a time.

I'm 19 years old, and went to culinary school directly after graduating high school. After an accelerated 6 month course, I worked as an intern at a one Michelin Star restaurant, and got hired after a couple months as garde manger.

I've been working at this place for a year now. The trouble is, I'm starting to realize that I don't see a future in doing this. No matter how much I love cooking and working the line, I just don't have a dream of running a kitchen of my own-- Not a real dream, anyway, if that makes sense. I realized that the want of running a kitchen as a chef was an ""expected"" dream that I sort of ran with because I figured that's what you did later on.

Don't get me wrong, I love my job. I work the station faster than anyone, can plate three station's stuff, and help out everyone else whenever I can. I'm not lazy, I bust my ass day in and day out, and don't have too much of a problem with any aspect of work as of the moment. I have a lot of passion for what I do, and always want to learn and always am excited to see new things.

It's hard though, to see myself really running a restaurant. Not because I don't want to do it, nor that I don't think I can do it a decade down the line, but just that it's not something I jump at. It's odd, and hard to explain, but... I just don't see a happy future as a chef. I've no trouble with long hours and low pay right now, but as I hear, hours only get longer and the pay doesn't get very much better later on(though money is honestly a non-issue). I guess what I'm most scared of is never seeing friends and family and regretting it later on in life.

Should I quit out while I'm ahead, go back to college for who-knows-what with the money I've saved from working, or should I push on and hope that I'll truly want to have a kitchen of my own someday, and that it'll turn out alright?

**tl;dr Love my job and being a cook, don't see a future as a chef. Should I go back to college or stick with culinary?**

Is it better to get like an actual 4 year bachelor degree or a degree from like an 8 month program?

These are both good schools so I'm assuming that they are hard to get into, but I don't understand how they judge who gets in. Should I stick to applying to these private culinary institutes or should I go to a culinary program at a CUNY school instead? Does it honestly make a difference besides the cost of tuition and bragging rights? I have no problems taking out student loans, but of course it would be nice to have to pay less.

I've been working in the same kitchen since 2008 (summers until I graduated from a liberal arts school in 2010), and it is on the verge of closing down to reopen in a larger space in a major city. The closing is definite--I don't know when exactly--but the reopening is a bit of a variable. 

After talking to my boss tonight, it seems as though there is potential for a gap between the closing and reopening...something between 2-8 weeks.

I am young, live at home, have been saving my earnings for the past year, and (through the restaurant) have viable opportunities to stage in some some of the most reputable joints in the continental US. Yet I love to travel, and would love to find a place abroad to stage at and soak up knowledge. 

SO, after all that, my question to you is: if you were in this situation where would you go? My initial thoughts are towards France or Spain, but at the same time it might be valuable to stay local (in the country) and go to NYC. 

Ideally I'd like to find somewhere with a Michelin star or two, due to the fact that I've worked in fine dining (and will continue to at the new place), but nothing ever rated by the almighty Michelin guide. 

Anyway, I'd love some input from anyone...I'll be doing research of my own.

For the past year or so I've been seriously considering working in a kitchen part time to see if it's even something I would want to do full time.

My wife is a manager level employee at the hotel and she is very good friends with the executive chef.  She spoke to him about me wanting to work in a kitchen and he offered to allow me to shadow him for a shift.

So I really want to know if anyone has any advice about this?  I'm very excited about this opportunity.

I may not actually be that young..just turned 26.  I've been working in kitchens for almost 7 years.  My first job started as a dishwasher in a local pub.  I quickly raised ranks, the big problem was cocaine and liquor was a big part of the job.  After spending 4 years there I ended up leaving the field for a year.  Me and my nose needed a break.  My buddy needed a cook at his bar so I stepped in this is were I fell in love with cooking.  One man kitchen had free range to an extant you know cheap pun grub but I did as much as I could do from scratch.  They shit canned me by telling me I was to good for the job and couldn't afford me.  I got a job the next day at a well known establishment and next thing I knew I was running there saute station on the busiest nights, which I felt some pride in but it kicked me in my ass.  18 hour days 1500 people a night 3 man line.  I loved it!! The stress that comes from a busy service nothing like that high!  I wasn't really making that much money and I thought I could find a better restaurant (fine dinning) to work in.  Another friend hooked me up with a top 5 restaurant in my city.   So I left that place after only 3 short months.  I get to the new spot and the chef was never there it was me and his sou who knew her shit but had a bad attitude towards teh chef since he was never there.  Then my old place offered me a job as a sou.  I was gonna take it but then another bigger restaurant called me and offered me an executive sou with a nice salary! I took it.  So this is where I am at and am needing some advice.  I have 30 some employees under me, I have to play by the rules have to be nice, tell people they are doing a good job when they clearly suck.  Do subpar food (never looked into the food before I took the job).  A shit ton of paper work.  Pros weekend features I can do pretty much what ever I want place is huge and rings in about 4 million a year so product is not a problem.  what is killing me is I've never really spent time working under a chef to help sharpen my skills, I've been teaching myself as I go.  I love cooking but often im double guessing myself constantly my friends and family keep telling me I'm a great cook, but they are use to chains and shit like that.  How do you keep your heads up when you feel like this.  Sorry for the rant and any advice and or feedback I would love.  Thanks again for taking the time.  please feel free to ask any questions.

The essay i'm going to submit to admissions for college.,3,0,6,http://www.reddit.com/r/Chefit/comments/146lz4/im_leaving_the_industry_the_essay_im_going_to/,"The prompt is something along the lines of: Write about a previous work experience you benefited greatly from.

Every cook dreams to work for the best chefs in the largest city’s doing food people fly across the world to enjoy. Being regarded a top restaurant though comes with a price. Standards and discipline can’t just come from a chef that has years of experience, the cook needs to have a same vision. I was given the chance to work in a kitchen of such magnitude for a short period of time.
It was one of the best experiences I have ever had in my life because not only did I become a harder working individual from it, working in a kitchen of such unfeasible standards I realized I loved cooking but I didn’t want to become a chef.


The bar was set almost too high in most cases, the standards too extreme, and the discipline unheard of. _______________(restaurant name) made me who I am today because after months of the chasing those unrealistic virtues you begin to realize that even if they are unrealistic if you give yourself any doubt that something is unachievable you will give up. You cut short of anything you might have been able to achieve. We called this the ‘push’, a “make it happen” mentality when all resources are expended yet projects still get done. The process in which all your efforts are needed throughout the course of a day to get done, what needs to be done no matter how heavy the load. 


You might think you know what I’m talking about, and have a story to relate but you don’t. Nothing compares and that’s why ___________ is one of the greatest chefs of this century. That’s why his restaurants are always recognized as the best in the industry.  


Day in and day out, I felt like I wasn’t good enough to work there. I did my job as best I could with the standards in place, but I never really felt appreciated. My efforts where never recognized and as I looked around, no ones effort where ever really recognized. It’s twisted but no one was happy to work there. A sense of pride came along with saying, “I work at ______________________”, but the sacrifices that came along with it never really made up for that sense of pride. 


So you begin to ask yourself how much more can I sacrifice, or how much more am I willing to sacrifice? There comes a point where it all becomes too much, and that’s why cooks would walk out in the middle of service or just don’t show up one day. All those feelings bottled up all just become too much in one single moment and they break down. They can’t handle it so they take what little courage they have, look the chef in the eyes, shake his hand and walked out the back door. These individuals where never heard from again, and never spoke of because they were weak, but you envied them because you were supposed to walk out at that moment instead of them. Now you have to work double time, picking up whatever they where responsible for. You work twice as hard as you normally would and somehow you survive another day, but just like everyone else on the line your days are numbered. Just like every one else, you’re thinking to yourself who is the next to leave? 


It’s a physical and mental challenge you have to commit to, it prepares you for anything in life because of the atmosphere you are immersed in. It seems absurd but I recommend every one should experience it or something similar to it. It has me asking “Who wants’ to be complacent” and the answer should be no one. It’s what drives me day by day to push for more in life. I don’t work in kitchens anymore but what I pulled from working at ____________ is that you should never strive to be second best, you can always do more, and accidents never happen. It broke my heart to leave ________ and for months afterwards I regretted the decision, because I knew would never experience something as great as that again. It was a life changing experience that has me still looking back and wondering how I ever managed to survive it.

I had ordered an espresso based drink, sat down, pushed back the foam (to check consistency), licked the spoon and felt like spitting it out. 

I was in disgust. Being an avid coffee lover, something was wrong here. Over-extracted, all you could taste was burnt oils. Was it the beans or the barista? That's besides the point. 

After returning the drink and getting a drip coffee to calm my taste buds I was instantly at ease. The coffee was juicy, but boring. 

None of the flavors I picked up were bitter. Mainly because I taste coffee way to often to call it bitter.  

How come? Bitter is a way to express a certain characteristic of a product, but it's not a flavor. Or at least that is my view.
After cupping countless coffee's I no longer taste bitter coffee. I taste the perfections and flaws in the coffee and identify them with an accompanying flavor, and I hardly think of bitter.

What does /r/chefit think.

Help me out, guys.",4,1,9,http://www.reddit.com/r/Chefit/comments/ysihw/ive_been_offered_a_job_should_i_take_it_help_me/,"Hey there /r/chefit, I wrote a lot of stuff about some cooking related shit that I'm going through right now.

So I recently got laid off from a small italian restaurant I was working at. I have two years of cooking experience and have done various stations; garde, pizza, pasta, grill and a bit of desserts. It only took me a day or two to get in contact with an old sous chef of mine who needs cooks at his restaurant. I went today for a stage and it was alright. 

The people were cool, the atmosphere was energetic and it seemed to be awesome. But the place was kind of a mess and the workers seemed to be pretty unprofessional. I almost bumped into a few people because they forgot to call their 'behind's, or 'corner's. After the stage I sat down with my sous chef friend and he tells me he needs people for garde and pizza, two stations that I didn't really have in mind for my experience. But in general, he needs strong people. I tell him that I can be that person, but I need to think about it. I've worked in a similar environment to this one and I'm not sure if I will learn anything from it again. I constantly am trying to get to a restaurant that is 'better' in some scale to where I worked at.

Here are the pros:

- Restaurant is causal, but well known, in a central spot and it's usually very busy (this means hours, which means $$$)

- I get to 'restart' my career in some way, which is kinda neat. It's like I already know everything, but get to do it all over again... all the mistakes I've made, I could avoid. All the knowledge I've gained could be really useful. 

- I get a decent benefits package and a raise after three months (I've worked for the restaurant's company before, so this is a nice bonus)

- I could really stand out and catch the chef's eye. This could lead to maybe a tournant position or something

- the menu has a lot of variety, I could work with new foods and learn new things

cons:

- most of the people I would work with are unprofessional and emotional (I saw people bickering about each other on more than one count. I know this happens in kitchens a lot, as the people you work with slowly become your dysfunctional family, but you still have to remember to stay *professional*. Especially in front of a stagier. It's like having guests in your house and then yelling in front of them at your sister cause she forgot to shut of the fucking staircase light again.)

- Food quality could have been better. I have high standards, but I don't consider myself a perfectionist. One of the garde girls was just plopping on some shit on a plate without love (**How can you forget the love**???), getting it all over the rims and shit. She didn't even wipe her plates (or as I like to say; 'rimjobs'). 

- People didn't keep their cutting boards clean. They were covered with wet, dirty towels (ew) and fucking radishes and pickles and peppers and shit. What the fuck people, clean your boards. Keep your towels at your sides, or keep them folded in sanitized water for cleaning. 

That's all I gotta say. What do you think reddit? I'm an asshole, I know.

EDIT: I wanted to thank all you guys for commenting. Still thinking. I have a stage tomorrow at a well-known fine dining restaurant (position is commis chef). We'll see how it goes and then i'll decide what 'role' I want to play.

It's an Alto-Shaam model, one of the smaller ones (won't fit a full sheet tray) with internal probe thermometer.

The menu here is casual new American southern cuisine (BBQ pork, kobe burgers, grilled salmon, steak frites, etc). They feature lunch, dinner, and Sunday brunch (think eggs, housemade croissants, etc). I'm already encouraging them to do the BBQ pork in the combi (would cut their time, yes?).

Warning: Massive Wall of Text


I have seen similar questions asked on this subreddit before, but I haven't seen anyone in quite the position I am currently in. My dream job would be to work for a publication (magazine) or publishing company that had a main focus on food, cooking or cookbooks.


I am currently 23 years old and I have a Bachelors Degree in Journalism and Public Relations. I love to cook and I believe I am good at it. I have a job at a newspaper where I work in the creative department where I do layout and design for newspapers and magazines. I also write a weekly food column for the paper. (I have held this job for ~18 months.


I feel like it is time for me to make a move to get closer to my dream job. I applied and interviewed for (and think I was pretty close to getting) an internship position at Cooking Light Magazine, but didn't get it. That probably would have been the easiest foot in the door to my dream, but it didn't happen. (Cooking Light and Southern Living are owned by the same people.)


Another position that I think I would enjoy and be good at has the following requirements:

* BA/BS (or equivalent) in Journalism, English, or related field.

* 2+ years of experience in an editorial, publishing, or research environment.

* Culinary degree and/or research background highly desirable


I am also lucky enough to have gotten my BA without having any students loans. Also, if I wanted to go to school for a culinary degree I could do so without going in to debt.


If you are still reading, how would you go about getting your foot in the door for a position like this? Get an Associates in Culinary Arts?

It seems like an amazing chance, to try out my skills. If i try an fail, so it goes, but i'd love to kill it and make something of this. I'd love any tips or help possible.

My starting shift is the brunch shift with a menu of a handful of omelettes and eggs, bacon and latkes and thats about it, btw

I don't have experience in a restaurant kitchen, but I'm not very intimidated by the prospect.  I know how to learn on the fly, I'm good with a knife and a stove, and I can take heat and pressure.  

Any pointers on what I should expect?  What are the best things I can do to avoid being an obstacle or liability in the kitchen?  Seeing as this was dinner prep time, the guy understandably didn't have the chance to talk schedules, hours, and pay with me.  I'm taking classes at my local uni 3x per week in the early afternoons (I'm on leave from college), so that may be an obstacle.  Any tips on when and how I might go about figuring that stuff out?

It is also able to do this all visually in a nice graph. In your opinion, restaurant redditors, what are some key features this software needs in addition to what it already offers to truly help increase profits and decrease food waste and over purchasing?

    I have been cooking professionally for a year and a half.  I am only just beginning to come into my own and still have a lot to learn.

For the 4th year in a row, Columbus Food Adventures is organizing a series of special tours for Local Foods Week.  As board members of Slow Food Columbus, Columbus Food Adventures loves to show off restaurants and food businesses that emphasize local and seasonal sourcing. 
Here’s the line up for the 2013 Local Foods Week tours:

Skillet exemplifies seasonal driven and ingredient centered menu. If you haven’t tried their farm to fork comfort classics you have been missing out. Their breakfasts are famous, but did you know that they are open for dinner too?
The Coop is a popular-locavore food truck that’s found a home as a pop-up inside the historic Hey Hey bar. Talented chef Angie Theado runs the Coop and as the name suggests they explore creative preparations of poultry and game. You’ll probably even get to try some local duck eggs!
The Hills Market‘s much anticipated downtown store opened early this year. It’s a great destination to find locally produced foods of all types, since The Hills Market is very supportive of local farmers and artisans. You’ll be sampling some of their favorite local products.
Brothers Drake Meadery are passionate about local sourcing and also local selling. They don’t distribute their product outside Columbus. You will be visiting their production space and tasting room and sampling some of the meads made with local ingredients such as pawpaw and spicebush berries. If the word mead makes you think of renaissance fairs, prepare to have your preconceptions blown away by this 21st century operation.
Knead  opened in July 2010 and made it clear from the outset that they were serious about local sourcing. The name ‘Knead’ was chosen to suggest that they try to make everything from scratch from breads to pastas to sausage. They shop at the North Market, partner with local farmers and grow some of their own vegetables.
On this tour you will visit at all of these establishments in one evening, meet the chefs and owners, and learn more about the challenges and rewards of local sourcing. The tour starts at 6pm and will run for three days during Local Foods Week (August 10-18) and tickets cost $60 with a portion of the proceeds benefiting Local Matters.

I'm the Sous chef at a very busy steakhouse where our Executive is several years my junior, with an overpriced le Cordon Bleu education.

We've been working pretty well together for the last year, but going into our busy summer season I'm worried that he's more of a liability than an asset.

The mother of his child(not his current girlfriend) can't stay out of jail because of prescription pill abuse and probation violations, often leaving this stoned-out metal head ""chef"" in custody of an infant child with little to no warning. He drives drunk, without insurance, on a semi-regular basis. Since being taken off salary(due to his side work for a now failing restaurant that never paid him for his ""consultation"") he routinely forgets to clock in or sign the back-up log, so at the end of the pay-period he can just jot down his hours without any verification or accountability; which, low and behold, almost always add up to his approximate ""hours"" from his previous, salary.

The kid's had a rough life, for which I have the deepest sympathy, as does our big-hearted owner. His mother a hard drug user, and his dad succumbed to cancer after a short, brutal battle. He has overcome great odds stacked against him, and has risen above his station in life through dedication, hard work, and luck, something I respect immensely.

But the fact remains, he is at the helm of a $1m/year business and cannot type without looking at the fucking keyboard, or using more than just his index fingers.

Every sous chef aspires to someday be an Executive. It's in the job description. But don't get me wrong, I'm not gunning for this guy or his job. In fact, I wish him nothing but the best. I do not wish to see him, or this wonderful establishment fail.

However, I cannot help but see the writing on the wall. 

I'm tired of putting out his fires, and doing 75% of his job for half the pay.

 Let the seasonal rants begin!

One of the guys won't make it if it rings in at 10:01 or later.  Or at least he'll raise a big stink about it.  One of the others says wait until 10:15 to really stop but server food right at 10.  Another says that if it's after 10 customers have until we actually get it wrapped up for the night.

I'm just trying to get a gauge on where this community stands.  Plus when I'm running a place I want a specific rule in place so people get consistent service.  

Right now I'm liking the 10:15 rule, except adjusting it to 10:05 or 10:10 since our place is so small.  15 minutes can easily mean someone sits after 10 but is able to get stuff from the full menu with a bad server (that's another issue to be hit on later).  I guess you can still do that with 10 minutes but I've got to draw the line *somewhere*.

For most my volunteer gigs I quote $5 a head and usually end up a bit below that. Obviously that fluctuates based on the clients menu/desires. How much should I charge on top of that if I am doing a paid gig? the last meal I cooked was italian/pasta bar for a friends  rehearsal dinner(50 people). They had been quoted $1000 from a caterer and that was with no dietary restrictions. I had volunteered my time as my gift to the couple and it only cost $230 in supplies(2 vegan sauces, 2 non veg sauces, 4 different pastas including GF, green salad with 3 dressings, garlic bread and homemade icecream). I would have a hard time charging $700+ for the day of work it took to purchase/cook but it seems like that is the status quo. 

TLDR: have a lot of questions about becoming a personel/private chef. First thing I'd like help on is pricing.

Most of us non chefs have always been familiar with ""boil off"" and maybe ""bake off"" in reference to using heat to remove a particular element from a larger whole, whether it be water or alcohol or whatever. And maybe something like ""simmer off"" would make sense for the same reasons, or maybe rendering fat out of something. But some of these other verbs don't seem to make sense within that same pattern of removing something. 

It seems like at one point in the past chefs just said sear or saute or whatever, sans the off. So I'm idly curious when the off trend started. If there is a why, that would be good to know too, but I know sometimes these things don't necessarily have a why.

It'd be a collection of ridiculous requests/mods, a little story about the needy customer making the request, the reaction of the BOH/FOH upon receiving said request, and artwork to accompany it all. 

Example from my work:
""Hmmm, on the spinach salad, can I just add some protein, like, a scoop of chicken that can be put on top of the salad?""

Upon hearing this, I spun around and informed the patron - a mid-forties, frumpy, jewish woman, that spinach is an incredible source of protein, and that her request was superfluous. 

""Hmmm, yeah, could you just put some chicken on it. It's healthier.""

Overheard this gem the other day: ""Yeah, I'm not really into eggs. I just don't like yolks, gross...Hi, can I get the Zucchini Quiche?""

I watch a lot of Food Network and similar stuff and they always hold up this stable of chefs (particularly when it comes to something like Iron Chef more so than somebody's lame 30 minute lifestyle show) as some of the best chefs in the country. 

But it occurred to me that they could just pick any relatively successful chef and put them on a bunch of shows and turn them into personalities and hype it up like they were the best chefs ever, because how would we regular untrained folk at home know the difference, particularly when we don't eat at the tv chef's restaurants or at the super fancy places where other top non-TV chefs work.  Food Network et al have a product to sell so of course they're going to push these people like they're revered titans, just like any circus promoter would do as the mesmerized rubes gathered round. 

But I mean compared to someone like a Thomas Keller or... okay well that's the entire list of highly regarded non-TV chefs I'm aware of... how does someone like a Geoffrey Zakarian or an Alex Guarnaschelli or a Masaharu Morimoto rate in terms of culinary skill? I know there are things like Michelin stars to consider but don't know if that's what chefs consider to be the general measure of who the top dogs are or otherwise what the general echelons of skill/talent/achievement/respect are.

However I find that Master Chef tends to really annoy me, because the contestants talk about themselves in the cut away segments as if they are hot shit chefs, and the hosts of the show, two who are actual chefs, treat the contestants the same way, thus inflating the contestants ego.  An example might be where the contestants have to plan and cook for 100 people Ina restaurant for one night and they barely pull it off and the hosts will totally pat the contestants on the back, telling the that they did a great job and now they know what it is like to work in a real restaurant and how awesome they are, etc.

Personally if I was a real chef like you people on this reddit, this would totally piss me off as you all worked very hard and or many years to get where you Re and to earn the title of chef.  IMO these people are just game show contestants and yet they are getting to meet and work with all these big name famous chefs and learn skills from them first hand, work in major famous restaurants around the world, get on TV, get magazine and cookbook deals and in short many incredible opportunities you real chefs will never get in your careers.  I mean if it bugs a lay person as much as it does me, I just have to wonder if it annoys the hell out those of you who have made food your life.

I am currently living with my parents and they seem to think that higher education in any field is important, which I agree with. However to them it means going to culinary school. While I would not mind going to culinary school the general consensus on this subreddit and from other people in general is that culinary school is not worth its price tag and real world experience generally trumps this. Is this true? Is culinary school worth going to? Are other alternatives like community college courses good? I have basic knowledge from working as a line cook for a while and I am wondering how I take my experience to the next step in the most efficient way possible so that one day I can become an actual chef (maybe with my own restaurant) and not just some dude on a line. I want to learn new techniques make more food and become a better cook and eventually maybe make food of my own and being a strong member of the culinary community.

any help, knowledge and harsh criticisms would be appreciated ",,False,self,t5_2s1da,False,,,True,t3_1hx418,http://www.reddit.com/r/Chefit/comments/1hx418/culinary_school_and_gaining_experience/,

However, minestrone is traditionally a very simple recipe using simple cheap ingredients so I wonder what the key difference would be.

I always considered it would be the quality of stock, but I have tried quite a few (Swiss Vegetable Bouillon giving me the best results) and have even tried making my own stock (without a doubt the worst results).

I don't expect to replicate pro standards, but would be interested to find out if there is anything you can do to make it more similar as it is my favorite  dish!

PS: I am talking about thin minestrone specifically.
