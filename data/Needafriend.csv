My sister does nothing but call me fatty, stalker for (almost) spending time with my female friend and only calls me my flaws. She does nothing but work my selfesteem and selfconfidence down..


My parents are unsupportive. All they do is call me fat, lazy and that there is no future in me.


My best female friend (who did nothing wrong) has, since we hang out alot, only made talks about me by others increase in size. People say she hangs out with me only does it because she feels sad for me. Se says that I shouldn't listen to them.. but i have been judged all my life for who I am and saying something that simple doesn't help.


My sister, her bf, a friend and my female friend were sitting outside just now and, because i flipped out, ignored them and went to sit somewhere else where I was alone and could think. I was mad and it didn't help that they followed me and tried to talk it out with me. I didn't stare at them.. I couldn't. My sister tried to apoligise to me because she said I was just stalking my female friend but that is not nessesary since she will do the exact same thing tomorrow again. When i walked away back inside to go to bed now (on iPad now in bed) they tried to stop me to keep talking to me. It went so far that I almost threw my female friend to the fground for trying to stop me.

**2. Try to browse and reply to other posts in this subreddit.** Several posts get posted every day, so some threads get buried. You don't have to wait for people to reply to you, so you can always reach out to others instead.

 **3. You can post again another time or visit other related subreddits.** Please wait until after a week or so to post again. You can also crosspost - it's okay to make another thread in other subreddits so more people can see it. There are several links in the sidebar that you may interest you.

* /r/makenewfriendshere and /r/penpals, are also general friendship subreddits.    
* /r/r4r is more towards dating, but you may also find some friends there. It also has a large subscriber count too if you want a larger audience.
* Interested in gaming friends? Check out /r/playdate and /r/steamfriend

**4. Looking for local Redditors? Visit your local subreddit (country/city/area).** Search for subreddits on Google (search for ""reddit + location"") or http://www.reddit.com/reddits

Basically, my brother in law, Sam, is in prison for the next 4 years. While I know he enjoys getting letters from me and his brother, it would be nice if he also had someone else to correspond with. 

Ill go ahead and lay out his charge, since I know that is going to be the number one question. 

7 or so years ago he shot someone in their ass. He came home to his young daughter locked in her bedroom, and his wife having sex with someone on their bed.  The guy he shot lived, and had no complications, other than having a bullet in his bum. 

Sam was put on probation with a suspended sentence, and if he violated his probation, he went to prison. When his ex wife got wind that he had attended an out of county funeral, she called his PO, and that leaves me here, asking someone to have the heart to write to him.

About Sam: He is a country and gospel musician. [Here is his myspace music page](http://www.myspace.com/samjackson01)

Before he was sent to prison, Sam was working on opening a church for the ""Un-church like people"". He was working with a group of members that helped ex felons, homeless, addicts, etc find resources, jobs, clothes, and worship if they were inclined to wanting it. 

I know that I bias, because he is my brother in law, but I'm hoping that just one person out there will have the heart to write to him.

Originally, I had created this account for the purpose of finding a few friends with whom I could regularly correspond. After a few days of peeking into subreddits and poking around, I realized that a lot of us are looking for something, or someone, to connect to. Posting anonymously and the subsequent “I feel for ya, man” or “internet hugs” are pleasant but, sometimes, don’t quite fill the void in our hearts. I realize that many of us Redditors, myself included, are SAPs or, otherwise, socially-inept and often don’t have the support network that socially awesome penguins have. All too often, I hear stories where people kill themselves because they felt that they had no one to turn to and that makes a tragic story all the more heart-breaking. So, I’d like to offer a proverbial shoulder, to cry with you, to laugh with you, to share in both your victories and your setbacks. No need to give me your name or e-mail, use a throwaway, if it makes you more comfortable but, if there’s something you’d like to talk about or need to get off your chest, please, send me a PM : )

Due to quite a few things, I've got trust issues, self-loathing, and a rather strong dislike for men. I've also learned I'm quite weak alone, so that's why I'm posting here. I hate being alone. I break alone.

But I AM healing. I know there's a lot I have to recover from ((Many breakups, suicidal friends and girlfriends, and a low self esteem that led to a bit too much time spent camming of a dirty nature)) but hey I'm on the road to getting better.

I know a lot of you might write it off as teenage angst, but right now I'm numb.

Whelp, on a bit more happy note, I'm quite awesome. I play video games, blog, write novels and poetry, I'm mature enough to carry on conversations with people of almost any age, and I'm also always here to lend an ear to anyone that needs me.

No one need hurt alone.

If you want a friend, or want to give me that hug I mentioned in the title, PM me. Or comment. If you're Canadian or American, I'll happily give you my number.

Let's hope people notice this, hehe.

See you online, loves~

EDIT: Dear god people noticed! Isn't it ironic that basically all the people who messaged/commented were male, even though I mentioned my dislike for the male kind?

I haven't had those in a long time due to extreme lurking tendencies.

Some things I like: music (I mostly listen to older rock, jazz, and singer-songwriter type stuff), older films (sensing a pattern here?), photography, walking/hiking, video games (although I am the World's Most Patient Gamer), languages, road trips, travel in general, pizza, and cats.

I like PC gaming, outdoors (though I rarely leave the house anymore), my dog, and writing. That is to say, I like those things but the only one I have actually done in any quantity recently is gaming--and a lot of it. I guess I'm just looking for someone or some people to talk to, hopefully people who can sympathize/empathize with what I'm going through and offer support/a shoulder. In return I can offer the same and occasional nuggets of wisdom that I really should follow myself. Male or Female is fine, any age is fine, though I'd love to meet a female around my age.

I moved across the country from my parents 3 years ago and am just now feeling homesick. I just came back to my own place after 3 weeks of being home (I am in college) and it's like it just hit me that I'll never live with my family again. My mom has been bipolar and depressed my whole life and has only recently been medicated/gotten help. I think that part of this depression is that while I was home, I could see that she is now much more nurturing and ""motherly"", whereas I was often expected to be the emotional support for my mother when I was younger. I feel like I'm missing out. Then, she and my father began to discuss adopting one of her students. It makes me feel abandoned. I often feel like screaming, ""I want my mom!"" and then bawling like a little kid. This regression and emotional instability is making it hard for me to go job hunting. I was supposed to take an online class this summer and just never signed in. I just desperately grab at things that I think will make me feel better, but nothing really works.

To compound this, most of my relatives live in the same area, and seem desperate not to include me in the family. They suggested I live with my grandmother for my first year of school, which I did. It was the worst year of my life. My grandmother is an alcoholic and bipolar, and she poisons people. Namely, me. She used to be a nurse and tried to feed me strange medicines all year. She made me eggs on the day of my college orientation, during which I became violently ill. When I asked her about it, she said, ""It was the eggs. They were really old, I just wanted to get rid of them."" I bought her a cat and it ""accidentally got into"" her prozac and almost died. She once suggested that my uncle (her son)'s black wife was personally responsible for hurricane Katrina.

Once I got into a car accident, at night, in a dangerous area and my other relatives never showed up to get me after they said they would. Another time I had a kidney infection and needed a ride to the doctor because I couldn't drive. Everyone was too busy.

I suppose the central problem is my realization that despite my mom's problems, I've always been able to depend on my parents in an emergency. Now that I'm on my own, I'm realizing that they're the only people I could depend on.",,False,self,t5_2qtp9,False,,,True,t3_95sfg,http://www.reddit.com/r/Needafriend/comments/95sfg/feeling_sad_and_homesick/,

Brief biography: born and raised in CA, moved to northern South Texas/southwest Central Texas (depending on who you talk to) in 2007 (during the summer between sophomore and junior years); super nerdy, major Trekkie and Wars-ie; weirdo (in an eccentric-old-man way, not psychopathic killer way); curmudgeonly (like Andy Rooney. [RIP Andy]); cynical and jaded (a bit of a ""House""); other such things as the aforementioned

I've never had good social skills and they've only atrophied as I've gotten older. I was all but friendless in middle and high school, and, yet, everyone liked me. I was always known by people I had no damn clue who they were, and yet they knew who I was.

tl;dr: 20 year old guy who only really talks to his GF needs nerdy guy friends.

Interests: TV, movies, British TV (especially Britcoms), music, books (even though I haven't read a book in ages... /shame), anything by Shakespeare, technology, Microsoft, Apple, Star Trek, Star Wars, Halo, video games, Excel (I make spreadsheets of EVERYTHING! Just for fun. See? I told you I'm a weirdo.), writing stories &amp; fanfic, good grammar and spelling, fancy words, Internet, xkcd, CAD, Doctor Who, philosophy, politics, friendly debating, Pixar, Phineas &amp; Ferb, MLP: Friendship is Magic, religion-ology and so much else.

Not necessarily looking to meet in person, just looking for someone to chat with on AIM or something (no texting, since I don't have a data plan), or play with on XBL or PSN, so I'm not totally alone.

I live in California in the bay area. Friends near by would be a bonus, but I'm ok with just people I can chat with too. I spend a lot of time playing video games. Mainly WOW and League of Legends. Although lately I've been more bored with wow and trying to get back into league more. Although I'm a bit rusty when it comes to builds and stuff for league these days. I do enjoy playing on the new ARAM map though. Someone who enjoys those games is a big plus.

Some of my interests outside of games are crocheting, dogs, ceramics, many other arts and crafts. More recently I started watching Anime too. So farm my favorite being Cowboy Bebop. I haven't watched too many yet. I have a lot to catch up on. I don't really watch shows or tv or movies very often at all since I tend to game a lot in my free time instead. I also enjoy watching LOL esports, Although I never really kept up too much with the LCS so far. I try to watch it when I can though. 

I'm also working on my health. A little over a year ago I started going on regular walks with my dog. Over the winter time I had some stuff happen and I've been struggling more with depression since then which has made it harder to keep up with walking. That plus I was getting shin splints. I got a new pair of shoes recently so that helps and the nicer weather is also good. I want to step up my exercise and get in better shape though. 

Like I said in the title I'm going through a break up and during the time I was with him I ended up really isolating myself and he was the only real friend I had. Now that it's over I kind of feel like I have nobody anymore.

My name is Lauren. I've been horribly lonely for a very long time, and I was hoping to reach out and make a few friends. The reason is, well...

I'm a military brat. I've lived in California, Tennessee, Indiana, North Carolina, Pennsylvania, and New York. I've also lived in Okinawa, Japan, and Wiesbaden, Germany.

Right now I work two jobs and I have a lot of coworkers that I get along with, but in a lot of ways, we're all very different people. I don't know if I could be friends with them outside of the work setting.

I don't drink. I don't smoke. I don't party. I've never wanted to either.

I just like to play games.

For the computer, right now, I primarily like to play League of Legends as a support (Soraka or Nami).

I used to play Ragnarok Online, Mabinogi, and Vindictus.

I don't have an XBox360, I mostly play on my roommate's PS3 (we share everything). Right now I've been playing Okami. I get a little bored with it at times because it's too easy, but I enjoy it.

I have a horribly strong love of cetaceans and the ocean, primarily killer whales and humpback whales. I'm hoping one day to be a marine biologist, but right now I'm just getting by.

Some of my favorite games include Ocarina of Time, Majora's Mask, Shadow of the Colossus, Skyrim,  Nier, Star Ocean: Till the End of Time, and FFX. For whatever reason, I love FFX. I love the story. I don't hate Tidus the way that a lot of other people seem to, though his voice can be a bit grating. I never played FFX-2 because it ruined the story. To me, part of what made FFX so good was the way it ended.

I've read and love Harry Potter, The Black Jewels Trilogy, and The Dragonriders of Pern. I don't get to read much, though sometimes I wish I could read more. I've read the Twilight series and I didn't hate it (sorry), but I can see why it wouldn't appeal to a lot of people.

I used to watch a lot of anime, but now I spend my time reading a lot of manga. I'm a sucker for romance, but it's not all that I read or that I've read. One of my top favorites is Shin Angyo Onshi. Another one that I'm reading currently that I love is Baby Steps. Skip Beat is amazing. Oh, and Mushishi is the shit, though it took getting older to really appreciate it. Ginko is a badass.

Some of my favorite movies include 21 Jump Street, How to Train Your Dragon, Gran Torino, and God Bless America (I LOVE THIS MOVIE).

I love South Park's type of humor. Out of every humorous show, I've felt that South Park has done it the best. I loved Lie to Me and I'm pissed that it was cancelled. I also like Bones.

I essentially grew up on Sailor Moon obsessively. I still love it. I've watched the anime, read the manga, and watched the Live Action. I never got to see the musicals, but if I could have, I would have. I did see a bit on youtube.

I played Pokemon for a good portion of my childhood and still love the series, but I hate playing turn based games anymore. I get bored far too quickly and grinding makes me angry. In the end, I just like seeing a bunch of made up creatures based on real life counterparts. It's fun and cute, though no Pokemon tops Lugia or Articuno.

As for music, I'm hugely into rock, though I've never particularly followed bands until recently. If you ask me about singers or players, I will have no idea what you're talking about.

Some of my current favorite songs:

Pendulum - Self Vs Self (feat. In Flames)
Malrun - Pariah
Eyes Set to Kill - Broken Frames
Pierce the Veil - Caraphernelia, King for a Day
10 Years - Fix Me (but really, I love almost ALL THEIR SONGS)
Janus - Always Rains, Pound of Flesh
Oceana - The Family Disease
DMC3 - Devils Never Cry
Five Finger Death Punch - Coming Down
Cold Driven - The Wicked Side of Me
Celldweller - Eon
Lynyrd Skynyrd - Unbroken

I also love documentaries a buttload. Stuff like The History Channel and National Geographic are awesome, though I haven't had the chance to see them in years (I don't have cable, and they didn't have it overseas). I've seen a lot of people complain about some of these channels and what they air, which makes me sad and disappoints me greatly.

I get depressed a lot. I feel that the military stole my childhood, and although everyone touts all these amazing experiences as being a huge plus, I don't feel that it negates or overshadows the sacrifice. I have a lot of unresolved issues that I have yet to talk to a therapist about.

I'm a very picky eater. Namely because I hate vegetables. Some favorite food places include: Taco Bell, HuHot, Quaker Steak and Lube, Oishii Bento, COCO'S CURRY, El Meson, PF Changs, and a few other places that I can't remember the names to because it's been so long since I've  been able to go.
I also love to draw, though I'm out of practice. I'm very far from skilled. I mostly just ended up giving up somewhere along the way, though I've always wanted to pick it back up.

I'm not religious in any sort of way. If anything, I'd like to avoid it completely.

I do like symbolism, which is probably why I like astrology to some degree. I think it's fun. Fortune cookies are cool too. I don't think any of it is true but I still like to participate. That being said, I'm a Cancer as well as a Dragon in the Chinese zodiac.

If you find that you're interested after all this, please give me an add on Skype: lauiechan. Sorry that it was so long. For those who don't like it, I'm sorry to have wasted your time.",,False,self,t5_2qtp9,False,,,True,t3_16xj1d,http://www.reddit.com/r/Needafriend/comments/16xj1d/lost_and_lonely/,

I'm fluent in a few languages. I play the alto sax, and love to take photos, although I don't know if I'm any good. I love to sing, act, dance, write, and travel. I'm a green belt in taekwondo (ITF). I'm geekier than most, I suppose. I like most genres of music, film, and television. 

I think the concept of time is really weird and have a hard time feeling conscious, or linked to myself in reality, if that makes any sense.

The show is hilarious and I love it. There’s just been something on my mind that was caused by one of the episodes. At the end of the second episode of the first season, Manny was waiting for his dad to pick him up and take him to Disneyland. After waiting, his father calls and Jay answers, only to have Manny’s dad tell him he wasn’t coming to get Manny. Jay states that Manny’s dad does this a lot and that it crushes Manny. Jay goes talk to Manny, and covers it all up by presenting a limbo that Jay was going to use with Gloria on their get away when Manny was with his dad. But instead, he uses it to take Manny to Disneyland.

This made me depressed. Why? Because I know what it feels like to have a father that constantly cancel whatever plans he made for the two of us to do. I recently came to realize that I stopped going to my dads house as often because he always did this. I’m 19 now, so the must go every other weekend rule doesn’t apply to me anymore, but when it did, I didn’t go every other weekend. He would cancel on me, and when I did go over, I’d have to sleep on the living room couch because the other room was for the lady’s son who he married. She’s not my step-mom and he’s not my step-brother. They made no effort to try to get along with me, so therefore they are nothing to me. The only thing I will never get that Manny got is having someone cover up my father’s lack of time for me. My mom never cover up what my father was doing, she just came out and said it. “Your dads an asshole. Oh well.” It took me several years to realize it but, my father doesn’t want me in his life. I have just been a financial burden to him. He’s missed so many important moments of my life. It’s heartbreaking to think that the people who should love you the most don’t care for you. It’s also depressing to think that if I didn’t exist, a lot of people would be better off. I know that last part will make many say, “don’t say that” but in all honesty, I am a burden to the people I live with and to the people I don’t.

I just had to talk about this. I have no one to talk to about it. I don’t have a best friend, all the friends I do have feel more like acquaintance and I feel like they wouldn’t care, and my family wouldn’t understand. I’m an only child. I have no one that I could go up to and just ask them to listen to me talk about this.

But anyway we just broke up recently (again) because we had gotten to the point that I couldn't even kiss him. I just wasn't interested anymore. But I didn't realize what was going on until he told me that I was hurting him because he could feel us drifting apart. So we broke up. And I was just mostly relieved.

My ex found out about the 2 of us and flipped his shit today. He said so many mean and horrible things. Like how he regrets our entire relationship and how I am disgusting and he should never have come back.

Literally to post here. Not sure how long of a post this will be, but here goes.

I'm not depressed, I enjoy life, but I see no point to it. I've felt this way for a while. I mean, when I'm dead, the only people who will remember me will be family, which is nice I guess, but had I never existed, nothing will ever be significantly different. Sure a few friends might have been lonelier at times, but they would have gotten over it.

I live in Canada, and for the most part, the stereotype that Canadians are nice is true. I live in an OK city, but I live in the nice area. However, I work at a store that's near the worse area of the city. This being the case, we get some of the worst customers in our store, whether they're extremely impatient, rude, yell, or simply don't understand what I'm trying to explain from a technical standpoint, language barrier, or even because, frankly, they're stupid, it adds up to being trouble giving smiles out while being on customer service. 

I recently broke up with my girlfriend. It was mutual, but we dated for nearly 3 years. I'm only 20, so that's a long time for someone my age.  She wants to stay friends, but it's difficult, as I still love her, and her texting me nearly every day makes things harder. Not that I would ever tell her to stop, because I want to be friends too.

I'm still going to school, and my school of choice happens to be nearby my house. So, of course I chose to live at home. My parents are stifling though. My mom constantly makes jokes about my interests (I enjoy watching people stream video game speed runs) and although they're not intentionaly hurtful, they take their tole. My dad is reclusive (like me) and so he does not enjoy me having friends over often. They also do not like me going out and staying out for a night, which is more difficult.

I mentioned I am reclusive. Well that being the case, I don't make friends often. When I do work up the courage to talk to someone, we often get along quite well. I've been told I'm very likable. However, at the moment, my only friends I can talk to are a) my friend from school who lives an hour away and is a guy. (I don't talk about personal things with guys. I always feel women are more understanding) b) my ex. c) my friend from work who now has feelings for me so she doesn't want to see me because she has a boyfriend and d) my best friend from work who is moving farther away because she and her boyfriend broke up.

After my ex and I broke up, I realized she was the one I texted alot. nobody else that often. I haven't been texting people very often. As petty as it sounds, it's lonesome. I'm feeling lonelier then I ever have before. 

I just want someone to talk to. It would actually mean a lot to me, if even just one person took the time to read what I've never told anybody because I have trouble trusting people. I always feel my problems are petty, and nobody should have to deal with them. It's...

exhausting. I'm always tired, I'm not motivated to do anything anymore. Maybe I'm depressed, I dunno. But this has been like this for a long time.

I just need a confidant

I am a 19 year old, fully functioning and normal girl. 4 months ago, I moved in with my long term boyfriend about 30 minutes from my house. This was at a time when most of my close friends had left for college, and the ones that didn't were scattered across different towns. 

I see my friends about once a week if that. I talk to them on the computer a few times a week, but many of them are busy, or don't have as much in common with me now that we don't see each other. I have no car to see them, and I don't want to ask my boyfriend to drive an hour just to drop me off somewhere, and then an hour later to pick me up. 

As a result of all of this, I lack a lot of social contact. I'v always been a social butterfly type, so it's really hard for me to live like this. We are planning to move soon so I can have easier access to my friends, but we don't have the money right now.

To those who have found time to read this, I am a man, perhaps still a boy, who is lonely, sad, and seeks companionship of any sort. I am within a stone’s throw of graduation from University with a degree in bullshit, and a concentration in Creative Writing. I would like write (comics) for a living one day, one day, one day…

In my free time I have done many things. I try to be creative, to make and do rather than observe and absorb, but the latter tends to happen more than the former. I’m gay for music, specifically of the pop punk and heavy rock variety (http://www.last.fm/user/DrStatic). I’ve been playing various instruments since I was a teenager and am currently writing a punk/lo-fi/indie/new wave concept album about an alien sending a message to Earth in the form of an album. I read way too many comic books, but my love for spandex and capes is not as prominent as it used to be. Creator-owned comics are gifts from the heavens. I thoroughly enjoy video games and am an amateur speed runner, but who knows if I’ll ever go anywhere with that? My tastes in movies and TV are malleable and I have enjoyed many things in the past and this will probably continue into the future. I probably like whatever nerd show you like, unless it’s the Walking Dead. Sorry, I’m not into zombies.

I work a job that I hate, in a city that’s all right. I like dogs and cats, both animals offer a different type of love. My thoughts are as organized as my life, but I wish they were as organized as my record collection.

Here’s the thing, though, really, I’d like to discover who I am outside of my tastes. Largely I’ve used this to define myself and they have been the basis for the majority of my conversations for quite some time. I’ll admit that I’ve struggled with depression lately, but my major cause of anxiety is lack of social interaction. (And a bit of “fear of the future”, but that’s not something I can fix so easily.) My conversation skills have been defined as “lacking”, but I’d like to make a general effort to change that.

I am friendly to all types, all races, all genders, all sexualities. Counter-culture types are my normal friends. Punks, hippies, druggies, vegans and such. I lean to the left more than most people, but I don’t prefer to talk about politics all the time, it just makes me sad.

Who you are:
Biggest qualifier: You are willing to talk to me.
Gender: Who cares. I’m not expecting sexy replies. 
Interests: I shall forever hope to meet some nice people with similar interests to mine, but I do not care. Just been into something. I hope you’re creative. No requirements.
Personality: I tend not to get along well with people who like to start arguments. A casual conversation where we disagree is fine, but if conversing with you involves you shooting down my points one by one just so you can say I’m wrong, my self-esteem can’t handle it. I hope we can laugh together instead. People tell me I am not funny. This probably true and it is my greatest shame.

Bonus points if you can ask me a question that legitimately makes me think. 

If you decide to PM me, please include which subreddit you saw this on. I will be posting this in several places, for one can never have too many friends. (But you can have too little. That is something I learned.)

I got in contact with the mods who said it was okay to make a post here about a new subreddit you can check out /r/randomactsofcards. It's a new subreddit to either give or receive cards to anyone who wants one. It can also be a good way to make a new friend.

One of my close friendships started with a card. I sent a deployed soldier in Afghanistan a card. It took a month before he unexpectedly replied back. From there it went to Facebook friends, then text buddies when he returned, and now I have a close friend who I share a lot with even though we live in different states. Friendships can come from unexpected places if you put yourself out there.

So if you get a chance come check out /r/randomactsofcards. Make an offer or a request. Do a card swap if you like. Look through other posts to see what people's interests are and comment on it if you have something in common. You never know what might happen. :)

Happy card making,

I come here because I want a friend that I will have a long lasting relationship. I want someone when I grow up and become 20 we still talk. I don't want to grow up having no friends or social life.

Minecraft, gaming in general(strategy and puzzle games i would say are my favorites, I like baking apple pie and then eating the shit out of it, mainstream music, hipster music, nice people, youtube, reddit, soccer, debating and discussing things, being inmature, being mature, making people laugh and smile, catgifs, checking out new things.


I check reddit almost every 20 minutes, unless I'm asleep.

Graduated highschool two years ago, been freeloading and bumming about since. Fell into a bunch of comfortable distractions and learned a lot about myself, nowadays I'm pushing myself towards rediscovering the passion for life and excitement for the future I used to have pouring out my ears. Things are pretty alright and I have some good friends but I'd love to branch out.

Here's me:

* Nerd. I dig tabletop RPGs, PC gaming, cartoons and animation are cool too. I'm a kinda-okay-ish artist too, I guess, but I haven't got much to show right now that I'm proud of. I want to change that!
* I also love music, of great variety. A bunch of my favorite artists are Gorillaz, Depeche Mode, Trent Reznor, Iron &amp; Wine, Astronautalis, Beck, Macklemore, The Black Keys, and The Prodigy. I dig soundtracks too, especially from games.
* Starting college in Vancouver, Canada next year. That'll be pretty cool. I don't live in the big city but I'm only a stone's throw away.
* Came out to myself as transgendered about two months ago. Still pre-everything, but I prefer identifying as a girl. Ever wanted a trans friend? That's cool, I'm pretty open about this sorta thing.
* I'm easy to get along with. I don't take offense to things easily, and I don't really shy away from topics most would think are awkward or unpleasant.

I'd love to talk to you if any of the following applies, or not, whatever, man.

* You have some bullshit you want to get off your chest. I can't offer much besides being all ears and some sympathy, but hey, that's all that's really needed sometimes, huh?
* You're working on making a better life for yourself! I'm at the start of a long journey myself, and it'd be wonderful to have some mutual motivation.
* We have similar interests, so we can blabber on about cool stuff. I'd like something a little more personal than just a gaming buddy, but tossing this out there, if you play Borderlands 2 we have got to party sometime.
* I don't care what you look like, but I do love people who are very open to talking about themselves. It goes both ways!

PM here on reddit. I chat over skype. I'll add whomever but it'd be cool if you tell me a bit about yourself while you're at it! Don't be shy!

I enjoy humor, though I'm ""strange"" and have no limits on offensiveness. Irony/double-meanings/etc are all cool.

I'm way overly cautious.

My last post got me a great deal of friends who helped me in my recovery. I'm glad for you guys--this place gives me sincere hope in humanity.

I think I'll give you guys a rundown on my situation right now....

*Massively low self esteem from being used for my body by guys online. Self worth also took a huge hit. Very little rl experience, in case you were wondering. Last cammed four months ago, but was camming sexually since I was around fourteen. Two years now.

*My mind isn't normal. I'm a writer, and sometimes my brain gets...overwhelmed with the characters from stories. It's not uncommon for a character's own personality to overpower my own.

*Long distance relationship with a guy I've never met. Yes, we've Skyped, I have his phone number and Facebook account, I know some of his real life friends. His name's Fuzzbutt--not really, of course--and I'd be dead if not for him. He's the reason I managed to quit camming.

*Unfortunately, my LDR with Fuzzbutt has an end date of after we both graduate University. He's American, I'm Canadian. We're high schoolers.....That's an end date of seven years or so. To say I'm scared would be an understatement.

*Mainly due to the camming, I DO NOT trust well or have that great of a viewpoint on men. Nothing personal guys, but....I'm sure you understand.

I would like to find someone with my common interest like music such as surfer pop, indie/rock, oldschool rock, punk, rap, hiphop and such. I also love to play my guitar and sing. (not well, but it's pretty fun). I love books, coffee and talking about interesting facts or events happening in the world. I enjoy gaming (zelda,cod,skyrim,amnesia,etc) . I love to debate and spit up opinions and just having great ol conversation. If i could go back to the days where people would have pen pals, and write to eachother back and forth form different countries. 
Idk, If any of you want to have conversations and just chat about things, help each other out, give advice and etc, i would really like to start that. 
if any of you have any idea where i can find decent people on the internet that don't hack your computer or show me their dicks on webcam, that would be lovely and i'm open to suggestions.

I'd rather not say my real life name. So I'm oftheninetreehill and a lonely Torontonian. I don't have any childhood friends because I grew up in a military town. Everyone I was friends with left after a year or so. Later, in high school, I had friends through my church. As I became an atheist I chose to leave those friends. I wanted them to remember me as someone they liked, not someone they thought was going to hell. In university I've found it difficult to keep friends. I've had to work  full time, which means I don't get to go out as much as I'd like. I though I had a solid group of friends, but that ended last school year with drama. I did everything I could to be the better person and fix the problems, but the friendships still fell apart.

I want friends that want to listen as much as they want to be heard, and are honest without cruelty. 
So there's the ugly reasons I want friends. Here's a little about me: I love arts, specifically theatre, sculpture, poetry and fiction. I'm a huge classics nerd. I dabble in video games, but am not very good at them. I love wine, coffee and beer, but hate how pretentious that makes me sound. I have a rabbit named after a Futurama character.

Someone who actually understood me and verified I wasn't totally crazy. lol

I'm really weird, but not in the normal way people are weird, more like exceptionally complex and unique, I have an absurdly scattered personality, opinions, and tastes and that's been my big problem my whole life, I've never easily fit into any category or group. Since I've been such a troubled outcast my whole life I've dedicated it to studying philosophy, psychology, and art to try to understand and relate to all the people in the world that never made any sense to me.

I like to think of myself as a particularly intellectual and caring individual who always tries to do his best to help and please the people around me but I'm almost always left feeling like I'm unappreciated, and like a failure as a friend. Yeah I have some mood and anxiety issues, but I really try my best not to be too whiny. I'm just looking for someone else who is looking for a committed, understanding friend to share our stories with
each other. Someone willing to go through some ups and downs together.

I think I'm really cool and interesting once you get to know me, just nobody really cares enough to take the time to get to know me. This is probably a waste of time too, but what do I have to lose? If I didn't feel anxious about having posted this, I'd just feel anxious about something else instead. Trying to hold on to my last bit of hope I suppose, before that slips away from me. Anyone who thinks I don't sound lame should add my Facebook page, I like to think I've put a good amount of work into using it to express myself. http://www.facebook.com/alexanderreed (Facebook isn't even cool anymore is it? Oh, well.) 

Sidenote: Almost all of my closest friends have been females, I suppose just because I've found them to be more caring, understanding, supportive people even if they don't have as much directly in common with me. The one male best friend that I had and lived with for two years agree'd with me on almost all of my personal stances and we had a lot of fun and raised some hell, but eventually it was his hardness and my softness that clashed and drove us apart. :s 

Edit: Naturally, I don't understand how social conventions actually function or anything, so I don't know, message me or comment, or hit me up on Facebook...or you know, don't, or whatever. 8) Haha, what you'll notice right off the bat is I act, and talk really differently every little bit depending on my mood, oh and I smoke a lot of weed. And I quit smoking cigarettes yesterday after almost 4 straight years. And I'm going to try to entice you with the mystery of fascinating stories of my life. I've never written anything formally really because of my own internal quality standards preventing my from starting, but I've been known to be quite the writer/communicator. I don't know, I just need someone that likes to listen to and share personal tales for fun. Also; I was the president of my high school debate team, meaning I can go in depth on any interesting topic you're interested in, in whatever field, yeah I also like researching and learning about any new interesting things for fun.

I've recently moved to a new city and though I've been keeping pretty occupied with local activities and new acquaintances I'm feeling a bit isolated in my downtime. I've had some email penpal type stuff going in the past, and though we're all really busy and it's hard to keep at it, I found it quite rewarding when it clicks. So here's trying!

Some random tidbits about myself:

* I enjoy reading, both non-fiction (feels like I'm learning and growing as a person) and fiction (nothing like a good story, it's a human thing).
* Big into road cycling, but still a pretty raw beginner. Want to start x-country skiing later this year when it gets snowy.
* Now that I'm in my latter twenties I've gone soft and switched to a steady diet of mournful indie rock (from lots of heavy metal during high school and college).
* Interested in foreign languages and tried picking some up in the past, thinking of starting up again soon. (Maybe Dutch? Could be a neat place to do some bicycle touring.)
* Grew up playing tons of computer games (back when PC Gamer was a respectable print publication rather than an ad-ridden pamphlet). But after having saved the world dozens of times, wasted tens of thousands of evildoers, and travelled to the far corners of the universe, I'm enjoying my well-earned retirement.
* Leftist politics and inappropriate humour are two of my favourite pastimes.
* By contrast, depressive thought is certainly not a favourite, but it is also a pastime.

That's all folks!

For the past 6 months I've been taking care of my mother, who is at home but under hospice care. My dad works, so during the day it's just me and my Mom. We spend our time talking, watching TV, and playing board games. I don't have a chance to get out much these days. But even if I wanted to, literally all of my oldest and closest friends who were still in town have moved away over the past few months. So, I'm lonely, and would love to have someone to talk to about anything.

I spend most of my time reading, watching TV/movies, playing guitar, and writing. I'm currently reading Neuromancer and re-reading Watchmen. My favorite TV shows right now are Breaking Bad, The Newsroom, Vice, Veep, TWD, Parks &amp; Rec, and Dexter. I also love the Daily Show &amp; Colbert Report. My favorite subreddits are /r/psychonaut and /r/electronic_cigarette. My favorite authors are Philip K Dick, Graham Hancock, Alan Moore, and Grant Morrison. I love talking about science, religion, nutrition/food, philosophy, conspiracy theories, astronomy, ""lost"" or ""hidden"" history, and current events. I also have a small (but growing) stone collection that I started last year.

I'm just looking for someone to chat with of any age or gender that enjoys some of what I do. I'm kinda new to to chatting with people I don't know on the internet, so it might take me a bit to warm up to you, but I'm really friendly once I get to know you :)

Every weekday, I come home from work, and watch a movie to myself (sometimes my family watches with me). I make a simple dinner, check my mail, read reddit, skim over some science journals once in a while, and hit the hay.

Wash, rinse, repeat.

I have such a hard time connecting with anyone at work. I don't know, I just don't feel the 'vibe' from anyone. Maybe there's not enough I have in common with them, maybe I'm just not the right kind of personality, I have no idea. I don't think anyone at work particularly dislikes me, I just think they have no particular opinion of me *whatsoever*.

Really, there's not that many other people I can think of that I could talk to and spend time with. I wasn't really able to make any lasting friends in my latest year of undergrad studies either (prior to going on co-op, which is where I am right now). The people I've known from high school have all dispersed and found their own social niche. Suffice it to say, there's little room for me in their lives.

Anyway, I come here to /r/needafriend for obvious reasons. It's not just my loneliness issues that keep me up at night (and believe me, I've only really touched the tip of the iceberg here with that issue alone). I also have self-esteem issues, which I suppose I could describe as a chronic feeling of ""having failed at my first 21 years of life"".

I have to take effort so that I'm actually able to chat with. Even at this very moment they're having their graduation party from High School, while I'm just sitting at home, as I know it'll take too much effort for me to be able to be at the party, where it's not even remotely enjoyable for me.

I don't know why I have this idea that I have to live up to some goals, which have never actually been put for me, but this just ends me up with just sitting at home, with a few people, that I feel as if I can actually call my friends.

I also love to read but haven't had time to devour anything. I want to start reading ASOIF since I watch Game of Thrones but college and work have eaten up most of my free time.

About me, I'm from massachusetts, been here my whole life. I like to paint, draw, other art related activities (currently an illustration major).
I love video games, i actually wanted/want to go into video game design. Current favorites being battlefield3, minecraft, skyrim, borderlands, and the list goes on. I like most genres of music aside from country; my favorites being deftones, smashing pumpkins, and soad. I read a lot, but not as much as i should; current favs being song of ice and fire and most anything stephen king.

I’m in my mid-twenties and it feels like I’m stuck in quicksand, pulling me down...

I dropped out during the last year of high school. We use a different school system where I live, but I believe its equivalent. I tried to fix the last year in Municipality adult education, Folk high school and such a couple of times, but it never works out. It all just piles up in the end and I never make it past a couple of months. I believe I got some issues with concentration and learning. I’ve nearly always finished with bad grades. 

Last fall, I went in to remove a fist-sized brain tumor, and the doctors said it might affect my initiative ability and motivation. I got brain cancer, but that doesn’t really bring me down much. It’s likely to come back again, but not for a decade or three.

What this comes down to is my will to get a proper job and my own apartment. I live at home and work from home with low responsibility, few hours, and thus low payoff. It’s enough to feed me, pay my bills and save a bit, but it’s not nearly enough to make it moving out… I go to the employment agency, but we have a big lack of jobs in my country, especially with my credentials.

My social life is suffering much. I’ve lost quite a lot of friends lately due to bad social dynamics. I strongly believe I got Asperger’s syndrome and that probably plays a big part in it. I often correct people when they say things that aren’t correct, but my purpose isn’t to be a smartass. It’s like a rock in a shoe to me, hearing someone give out false facts. It’s really uncomfortable. I personally like it when people correct my faults. It might be about how it’s said though... Also I’ve heard I often interrupt, but apparently it’s only that circle of 3-4 (ex-) friends that seems to think that. I asked the few remaining friends I have, they don’t really seem to agree. However I’m aware of these two things and it feels like I’ve improved them lately.

I really want to get new friends and move on. It feels like my last circle of friends has an everlasting impression of me. Even if I stop correcting and interrupting (which it feels like I have in the past 6 months), they’re still walking on eggshells. I’ve gotten together with some people in a “meet new friends” group of Facebook recently and we’ve met a few times, but I want more. I also want people to be honest with me and tell me what I do wrong instead of talking behind my back and eliminating me.

All of these things bring me down and I've talked to a few psychologists. The last one more or less gave up on me after 6-7 times and said she can't help further, that I need to act and do something. Getting things done feels like a main concern for me...

So I want a friend but have a difficult time talking to people if they have different interests. The conversation gets stale and awkward (although to be honest I've never tried this over email).

Profile: I'm 19, a college freshman... Introverted + shy + commitment issues. I don't have very many interesting hobbies that I do daily, and I tend to give up pretty easily when things start to get hard. My maturity level is not very high; I just want to really get interested in something. That something in life that you are deeply passionate about, y'know?

So. I'd like to start talking to someone who has the following interests/who would like to start learning/improving in one/several of the following areas. Rated by current interest levels. Small - really want to do, Big - this sounds interesting

1 - **Programming** (level: beginner -- starting our own projects solo(preferred)/together, text adventures, etc.)

2 - **Playing the piano/instrument** (level: -1 -- I can play twinkle twinkle little star on one hand... Had a keyboard for a couple of years and would like to get some more use out of it. Not really sure how we would share this. Just talk about what we do occasionally I guess?)

3 - **Drawing/doodling** (level: -1 -- I draw horribly, but like looking at attractive designs. Ehhh. I'll scan mine if you share yours?)

4 - **Writing in elian script** (level: 0 -- a written language script based on english. check it out here: http://www.ccelian.com/concepca.html)

5 - **Tell me** if you've got anything interesting you'd like for us to do. I don't like outdoorsy stuff though.

Please post. And then let's share email addresses.

I've always been a bit shy, I'm the type of person that prefers to have a small tight-knit social circle, rather than tons of half-friends. But I guess that's backfired since most of my close friends have moved on with their lives.

I have one semester left in school, after which I'm going to pack up my bags and start a new life somewhere else, but for now I'm stuck in a big city with no one to really talk to.

Its pretty lengthy, so For the lazy:

tl;dr : extremely dedicated athlete wants nothing more than to play lax, gets cut.

Ever since I was 10 years old I've wanted to play lacrosse. But I live in south Florida so the sport isn't well known, there were no pewee teams or anything of the sort. Regardless i still followed the sport and my love for it grew.But when I was in my last year of middle school I found out that the high school I was going to actually had a lacrosse team (well club at the time but that didn't make a difference to me) so I immediately started my conditioning. I started running daily, waking up at 6am everyday to swim, eating healthier (haven't touched a soda/pizza/hamburger in years), etc. And this held up for years.


But I never once thought of the monetary cost of the game. And my parents wouldn't pay for it. I needed money but wasn't old enough to work. But I continued my conditioning, and even wrestled for two years to supplement that (no equipment needed). Finally a year ago I was old enough to work, so I got a shitty job at McDonald's, and endured endless hours of underpaying work, all to pay for my dream of someday getting to play lacrosse. 


Fast forward to today. I'm a senior, and we've been having ""tryouts"" over the last two weeks and there were lots of freshmen coming out for the team, but I figured that I could still outdo them. And I really feel like I did. But it didn't make a difference. The coach told me it was too late for any first year seniors to make the team, but we could still come out to practices if we so choose. 

But that doesn't help the fact that after all these years of dedication and hard work, I get nothing out of it. You could make arguments like ""oh but now your such a fit and athletic person, and you have a job, etc etc"" but that means absolutely nothing to me if I can't play. I can't help but feel like everything I've done has been wasted, so I really feel like shit right now, and I'm hoping some friendly redditor can just cheer me up.

Edit: Damn I'm surprised at the sort of response I've gotten. Similar stories from all sorts of people, how (if) they overcame it, and some generally inspiring ones.

I have always been quiet and shy. It affected my school work when I was young and how many friend I had.

When school came to an end, at the age of 16, thing's were worse than ever and now being forced to move on from the only thing I knew, things just ground to a halt... I was so far off the radar of teachers and everyone else by this point I never heard a single piece of advice on ANYTHING to do after this point.

The few people I did know obviously moved on with their lives, my best friend did what he had planned and joined the army (I see him once every 2 years) and then I was basically alone.

I had 2 relationships over the years, one from the age of 17(almost 18) up to 19 and the second from the age of 19 and a half to 21. Both started well then ended after months of extreme awkwardness... its no fun living with someone that does nothing with their life I'm sure, and when you make your partner EVERYTHING in your world they're eventually going to snap.

Since the ending of the last relationship I have had several quite unpleasant health problems... not brought on by anything other than failure to see or call a doctor within good time to nail it on the head and stop it getting worse and I'm now basically stuck with certain things for life because of that. Its just another knock to my none  existent confidence, the problems being physical and noticeable to others when they 'flare up'.

In these 8 years I have had 2 very short jobs(totalling less than 2 years combined), I can't get myself 'out there' or talk to people to ever find one. The one's I did have were found by government organisations I would have been referred to by the job centre when they couldn't do anything with me.

I keep myself to myself, I don't use things like facebook, I don't even talk to my family (despite living under their roof), I don't go out anywhere because there's no one to do anything with or even things to do... I just want to be left alone most of the time.

I can see every problem wrong with my life and I know the way to fix it is to simply 'strap on a pair' but I wouldn't even know where to start and I just can't ever do anything about it... even the people that are supposed to help me like advisor's at the Job Centre mock me for my  extremely care free attitude to everything. 
One even went so far as to advise me to never get stoned in case my brain can't be bothered to keep me breathing... for that matter several of these 'official types' even do accuse me of being stoned because of my lackadaisical attitude.

My life has been easy that's for sure, but its never even felt like it was real. I don't understand how I can make the problem, be aware of them, truly want things to be different then fail to act... I'm so scared of everything.

It's not like its even an attention seeking thing, I don't moan about anything I just hide away from everyone and everything... this is the first time I have even attempted to say anything about it.

Why am I like this ? :/

My name is Jessica. I'll be going into my Senior year (finally!) and, well, I don't come on here with the intention of filling a void because of lack of social ability, but to meet someone new. See, I have social anxiety/depression/ADD, and it's difficult to talk to someone about it/find someone to even talk to in my school. First of all, people automatically assume you have too many issues and second, no one wants to listens to your problems, even if you're always there for them.

My request? Someone around my age to just relate and talk to. I have a bit of baggage that I'm not just going to throw out on here. As far as judgement goes, that's unpredictable.

To be honest, I'm not sure what I want. I guess what I can do is pour my heart out here and wish that at least the right stranger would tag along. 

Right now I'm scared. I feel very empty and numb; sometimes I can't bring myself out of bed. This feeling of loneliness is almost paralyzing. Is this a cry for help?

I feel like, if I close my eyes and dwell on this cavern inside me, I want someone who is genuine. A person without a veil. There are no promises from me, as I am also imperfect, but I am also veiless too. 

I guess if I list my interests out here it would be easier?
I like art and drawing, movies include eternal sunshine of the spotless mind and other charlie kaufman films (I haven't seen all of his). 
My favorite band is Twin Sister for nostalgic reasons.
I like anime too! Neon genesis and Cowboy bepop. I like sleeping. I'm kind of odd (though I'm not sure if that applies here).

I'm really scared right now. And desperate.

Every day I get more and more bothered by the amount of resources that these fucking corporations are taking and turning into more CRAP that nobody really needs.  I try every day to make sure that I'm doing the best I can to cut back on waste and really, what's the fucking point of doing that when companies like walmart more than make up for the little bit that I try to conserve?  

I'm caught in this fucking machine and sometimes I feel like I'm never going to get out.  And I look around at the faces around me at my work and I realize that like 99.99% of them don't take the time to consider any of this stuff, and don't think twice about the fact that we are pumping tons and tons of plastics out of this place, not to mention all of the toxins we are releasing into the environment when we melt the shit.  

Nobody cares that our quality of life is quickly deteriorating!  Just so long as they get their paychecks so they can go out and buy more brand name clothes and eat at all of their fast-food joints and buy shit from China that they don't need.  Nobody looks around and seems to be bothered by the layer of pollution that is constantly hovering over this city, or the fact that the roads are covered with litter.   

Sometimes it's so hard to be happy and satisfied with my life when I think about all of the things that are wrong with what we're doing.  I feel like I should be doing more but I feel so caught up in it.  I want to go out and help change things but I'm too busy being concerned with the fact that I won't have a place to live or food to eat if I don't come to work every day and pay my bills.  By the time work is over I'm too exhausted to even care about these things anymore and all I want to do is relax, and I get frustrated with myself for this, like I have no business complaining because I'm not doing anything outside of what I'm already doing.  I feel stuck.  Stuck in the gears of the military-industrial complex.

I want to move away from here and live in a sustainable community somewhere.  Somewhere where I can go and have a garden and not have to work for someone else.  I'm trying to get there, but at times it seems like it's something that might never happen.  I can't even find a good place to go that hasn't already been corrupted by our fucked up culture.  If anyone has any suggestions they would be greatly appreciated.  I need to get out of this city.

So I confront him and he declines and showed me the convos they have. She sends him flirtatious messages, intimate messages, etc. she pretty much lied to me. I feel horrible.

I recently took a big step in my life with my single parent mother and moved from Georgia to Florida, to find a new life for us due to some hardships we faced in Georgia that i'm not going to go into full detail here because it will be too long here. So I basically have started my whole life over from scratch since I have never really lived anywhere else, but I did not leave much behind, cause I only had one real friend in Georgia, that I still keep in touch with anyways. A major factor being that my whole high school years, have been online schooling, due to medical problems that started to come up right when I hit puberty (great timing right?). So it does not really help that i'm not in a place where I have not been able to meet any kids my age. I have tried all kinds of things to get out there and involved and meet other kids, all with honestly no success whatsoever due to varied reasons. The only friends I have been talking to are either online, or keeping in touch with that one friend from Georgia on the phone. Other than that, I am feel extremely isolated honestly, and it only makes it harder that my mother has to work her ass off just to keep us afloat, and I have been even trying to do something part time, volunteer, intern even, anything really. I even tried seeing if any of my online friends lived in my area, but the only ones that lived even close, lived way WAAAAY south Florida while I live in the more northern area. It's now summer and it has just gotten to the point where I feel like i'm waking up doing the same thing everyday, even when I try to change things up in my daily routine. 

What I'm trying to say is I guess i'm looking for maybe some new online friends that I can hang out with, and If at all possible, maybe start meeting up IRL and stuff like that because my online friends can get as close to like brother to me but, I just need a friend I can vent, hang out and talk to face to face, even though I have been through all this I still like to be optimistic, even though I can be cynical at times. 

I guess this is where I list a bit about me so...

- I'm a big movie buff and I love the art of film, I wish to get into it someday

- I'm a Pokemon nut and I just recently got back into it, i'm also into playing other video games as well, though I have fallen out of gaming recently

- I love the shit out of Doctor Who (though i'm still in the 10th series)

- Music is a big part of my life and I usually always am listening to something, some favorite artist include Pink Floyd, Green Jelly, Queen, Daft Punk, Wavves, Biggie Smalls, Lupe Fiasco, Madeon, Frank Zappa, and etc

- Personality wise i'm pretty open minded, optimistic, brtually honest at points, I love to listen to others so I would no mind if anyone vented to me

- I like to talk about really serious things as well such as Religion or Politics (I'm Agnostic and Independent BTW)

- Other hobbies of mine are reading, experimenting in making song mashups, Walking on the Beach, swimming

- I also love watching Basketball (Big Miami Heat Fan)

Well I have pretty much written my life story here lol, sorry if it was long but I really needed to reach out for someone and just vent a little. I don't have any preference to gender here, though I would like the age to be at least a little around mine, ESPECIALLY if we are gonna meet and hang out later on. Thank you for reading this :)

I'm not the most...physically fit person ever. I'm muscular and tall (6'2) and whatnot, but I can't run. I ran about a quarter of the 400 meter track, and stopped. I walked the other 3 laps. I was walking and I had an epiphany--I am probably the biggest freshman, and I *can't run*. I can't run, don't have a girlfriend, 2 friends, and my life is on the computer. I've stopped caring now. My grades are going down, my teachers are worried, and my eating habits are going out of control. I've started back up on my adderall (Stopped taking it about a year ago, Doctor says it's fine) but it's not helping. I weigh almost 300 pounds now. I've had suicidal and murderous thoughts. For example, I'll often think ""Hm...I wonder what would happen if I brought a knife in and stabbed the people that hate me...those douche-bags with the sideways caps, and drug and/or alcohol addictions that get all the friends and girls...That'd be nice. I don't mind being locked away for a few years."" These thoughts occur daily. Anyways, an acquaintance of mine runs past me and slows down to walk with me. ""C'mon, /u/Scheidecker1, run!"" I looked at him and said with the most serious face I can give, ""I am a loser, Carlos. I can't run. I'm slow and fat, and probably the most nonathletic person in all of [Anytown, USA]. I have no friends, I have no girlfriend. Whenever I try, girls just ignore me. I can't."" He looked at me and said ""Well okay then..."" and ran ahead. I stopped and looked down.
The girl I have a crush on is in my PE class, and she gets to watch me embarrass the shit out of myself attempting to run. And I'm sure she laughs. I know she does. I asked her out once, and she surprisingly said yes, but later did I find out she had been lying to both me and her boyfriend. Needless to say, she picked him (Rather fat, loud, obnoxious and childish) over me. I cried.
Anyways, it takes me about 5 minutes to finish after everyone else. We go inside and go to the locker rooms to change, and come out about two minutes later. I stand in the hall, waiting for the bell to ring, and the next class to start. Carlos walks up to me and says ""Gee, am I bore-"" ""Shut the fuck up, Carlos."" I cut him off. He walks away, and another guy, Alex, walks up to me with all of his buddies. I'm known for my Hank Hill impersonation, and he says ""Hey, Hank. Hey, Hank. Propane."" I know he was just joking. He wanted to hear the voice. But there was a different voice present. It was a little evil one. It said ""Slap him. Slap the motherfucker right in his smug-ass face, right in front of his friends. Show them that you're not THE PUSSY THAT THEY TAKE YOU FOR!""
I'm generally a nice person, when I can be. But not now. I now know that I'm inferior to them. I warn this Alex fellow. ""Back away. Now.""
He looks at me and says, mockingly ""Yeah? What you gonna do about it?""
My rage broke. The voice was screaming! ""DOITDOITDOITDOITDOITDOIT! SLAP THE MOTHERFUCKER!"" I couldn't stop myself. Almost in slow motion, I watched my hand move itself up and make contact with his face. And it wasn't light. I say, enraged from everything ""That. Now, when I say back away, you back the hell away."" Alex and his friends walk away in shock. I hear a ""Whoa! What's goin' on over here?"" from my right. The student teacher for the Juniors (I think) walks over and says ""Well well well. You need to watch your temper. Wanna talk about it?"" I look at him for a minute. ""No. I'm fine."" He looks around and sighs ""Who's your teacher?"" ""[Teacher]."" ""I think we should go have a 'chat' with Coach [Teacher]."" I follow him back into another room, and I see my PE teacher there, along with the Junior and Sophomore PE teachers. ""You're outta shape, aren't you, /u/Scheidecker1?"" I look at him angrily. This is about me hitting someone, not my fitness. ""Yes sir."" He starts up again ""You're pretty slow."" I angrily shout ""I don't see how this is relevant!"" He stamers back a bit and says ""Who'd you hit?"" I hesitate. ""Alex. Alex Lastnamerson."" He walks back to the hall and calls for Alex. Alex walks in, his face still red. ""What happened?"" Teacher asks. I start to say something, but Alex pipes up. ""Well, I asked him to do his Hank Hill voice--He does a good King of the Hill impression--and he said to back away. I said 'What's the matter?' and he slapped me."" I shout ""That's a lie! I told you to back away, and you said 'Why? What are you gonna do?'"" We got into a rather childish 'Nuh-uh, Yeah-huh' match, and the teacher stopped us. He told Alex that he sometimes need to know when to back down, and then he turned to me. ""And you gotta know that violence isn't the answer."" Bullshit. I'm a usually docile person. ""Yes sir."" I say. ""Now the two of you shake hands and we don't have to take this to the office."" He motions to Alex. I walk to Alex and hold my hand out, and he squeezes it with the force of a thousand rhinos. I know he didn't forgive me, even though he said he did. The bell rang, and we left. I walked particularly slow, and hung my head in realization of what I'd just done.
This exile from regular society...it's killing me. I try to be funny, and nice to all, but when I am, I get treated like shit. I try the polar opposite, still more shit. I can't win here, can I?

I really wouldn't mind if I died right now.

Although I'll be happy to chat with anyone who wants to, I'm really looking for a person who would like to create an ongoing comic series with me. Personally I've got a lot of ideas and I'm really anxious to start writing scripts, but for me, there is one obstacle - I can't draw even one straight line.

I'm not really good at this but I'm going to try .I'm just a normal 18 year old guy from Germany who is still going to school and I'm looking for a friend but not just a friend someone I can talk about everything with , someone who can become important to me , a really true friendship. I don't even know what to say . I'm a lonely , weird  a little bit shy and introverted person who has no friends there was a time where I had many friends I was really outgoing and confident but that was a long time ago when I really got addicted to gaming and when my friends asked me out I neglected them every time just because I wanted to play a little more. I know it's my fault so I kind of understand why they left me since then I was always alone never had friends like that again.

 I think I already wrote to much about my past i should write more about my interest : gaming I still like playing games but not that much addicted to it like in the past , cooking and baking I know it's not normal for a guy but I think it's really fun even though I'm not that good and still inexperienced but I like it, books I love reading books even though I actually never read I just started with "" The Godfather""and I think I'm getting into it again , animes , tv shows like ""The Walking Dead"" , ""Breaking Bad"" and just recently I got into ""Doctor Who"" I really fell in love with it , my all time favorite is ""Prison Break"" I watched it like 4 times already , and I really like America I would really love to travel there it's like a dream of mine. I have many more  but I don't really want this to be so long and I can talk about anything you want :) so don't be scared if your not interested in something from the above actually I would prefer someone different than me but it would be nice too to meet someone similar :) 

Just send me a pm and please only if you're truly interested it kind of happened here that some people didn't seem that interested at all where I just got answers that were 2-3 words long and I know it's kind of weird in the beginning but for me I can write really much when i get comfortable and if you want to write somewhere else I have Kik , Whatsapp , IMessage , Skype too :)

My girlie hobbies include baking and cooking, wildlife, nature and general cute stuff. I'm all over puppies, kittens, maru and tardcat :D I enjoy postcrossing which has become my newest addiction - I love receiving snail mail from all over the world - I find sending postcards a lot easier than penpalling - I'm not very good with writing things down and composing long letters.

I'm in my 11th year in High School. I don't really have many friends since I'm shy (and not very interesting..). I like to listen to music in my free time (Different subgenres of Metal, that's it), my favorite bands are HammerFall, Morbid Angel, Stratovarius and Epica, if that gives you an idea of what genres I listen to.

I'm into PCs and phones and stuff like that (by that I mean I'm interested in the internals, how they work, etc..).

I also play video games (PS3 and PC), so if you're interested we could play together (I probably won't voice chat since I'm really shy, might voice chat if we become friends though).

If you're interested in talking or anything, shoot me a PM, and I'll give you my contact info (Steam ID, Skype, phone number, etc) if you want it.

If you live in Bahrain too then that's even better.

I relax by watching Breaking Bad, Trailer Park Boys, MXC, Sunny in Philly, and similar shows, usually with an ale.

I also enjoy trying new food and drink, watching baseball, and web development(profession).

I’m a 22-year-old girl, recently graduated from college, and I’m looking for an online friend. I don’t care about age or gender, as long as you’re not 10 or something. Sorry, kids. I’m also not looking for an online relationship. I just want someone to talk with.

I like a lot of things: video games, movies, TV shows, a bit of anime, comics, art, art history, military history, music, reading, writing. I can be more specific if someone asks. I’m a good listener and can help out if you need advice, too.

The reason I’m doing this is because I haven’t been socializing much lately, and I think it’s getting unhealthy. The friends I do have live pretty far away, and are busy with their own lives. I guess I could try to meet people in my town, but outside of work and school, I’ve never been good with spontaneous friendship-making. And now that I’m not in school and not working, it sucks.

2) Your mother and the things we do at night
3) Chick flicks (unless they're the good ones, you know which)
4) American Indians and their heinous oppression of the white man's luck at reservation casinos

Everything else is fair game. Here is a little about me, lets see how we match up:

Music
I dig on all types. Current repeats being Tom Petty, John Mayer, Steel Panther, Tegan and Sara, and Gary Clark Jr. I've also been jamming some EDM so there's that.

Movies
I saw Snakes on a Plane twice in theater.
I get misty eyed during Nacho Libre when Nacho's head is getting stepped on and he sees his little ninos from the orphanage walk in the arena to watch him fight.
I can't think of white cake without thinking of Django Unchained
Toy Story 2 was okay

Humor
The Onion
John Mulaney
Mike Birbiglia
Christopher Guest films
Less than intelligent people and their exploits on Youtube
Good Neighbor Stuff (not grouped in with the people mentioned directly above, of course)

So, now I realized that I pretty much have no friends to go to, but I've never really had any friends, but I've never had problems with it, and I don't think I do now either, cause I have a tendency to just brush things off and go along with it. I never have problem with talking to people in school, but then that's that, I've gone to this school for the past 3 years, and have barely been with them in my spare time, and now going into the next part of my education, where I'll meet a bunch of new people, which I don't really feel good with, as I know I'll have to get a bunch of new relations going, which will take a lot of effort. I've never been to a party, even though I've been invited several times, I always say no, and come with some lame reason, which I reckon will be the same in the next years.

But all of this of me having no actual friends to go to, never actually affected me too much, as I had people to go to over the internet, I'd just play with them and never really think about it too much. I didn't have to consider how I looked or how I was acting, cause they continued to play with me as they enjoyed my company. But now I'm having problems connecting to them aswell, so I'm just feeling I have no where to go.

I'm a metalhead looking for people to talk to and joke with.

I'm a pc gamer. Being South American limits a bit what I could possibly play with anyone in the US/UK but I guess there's always something. Have a [steam account](http://steamcommunity.com/id/Gungner/games?tab=all) too.

I enjoy reading tho I haven't done it in a few years. Everything from Da Vinci Code to Lovecraft. 
Loooove card games. Poker, TCG like Magic, Koi Koi (still trying to learn how to play that one correctly but find it awesome anyway!), some digital card games... Just love em.

I have a bit of trouble speaking sometimes since I'm an introvert and also a bit shy. But once I start you won't shut me up. :P Starting conversations or topics is usually hard for me. I'm also more comfortable talking to women which is weird but meh. I joke a lot when I get comfortable with people which may or may not take long at all.
Like to discuss pretty much everything and love to hear different points of view on things and try to understand them.

Personal:

Everyday I long for sleep yet I know when I sleep I will just have nightmares, and then when I wake up the real nightmare begins, everyday the same but new. I torment myself because I know when I sleep and finally wake up I will have to endure this hell again. The never ending pain, since I was 10 years of age I've had 24/7 headaches. The pain is normally a constant 8 out 10. Never going below a 8, but always shooting up to a 10. It makes me mentally and physically exhausted. Makes me non sociable, I just feel so irritable, frustrated, angry, lost, confused, dead inside, hollow, alone, detached and everyday I just wake up and try my best to finish the day. Basically I am just going through the motions yet feeling so motionless.  I've put myself through college and I am still currently in college, it's a struggle but mostly with myself and not the school work.

I've been trying to get help since I started to share my problems with my family at 17, I've seen neurologist, chiropractors, acupuncture, herbalist, and massages. I now refuse pills all together. Pills don't help, but from my understanding they just mask the pain and not fix it. I try the natural ways. But currently I do nothing really for the pain, but I happen to smoke Cannabis. It takes a lot of the pain and stress off, makes me happy and less depressed. I get soo depressed. But I understand that Cannabis just makes me even less sociable, and a lot paranoid. However, it help me self reflect and evaluate my life more.
I've spent so much time trying to figure out how to treat my pain, but I neglect the emptiness and loneliness I feel.

I feel that maybe the reason I'm not sociable, and do not really have any relationships with other people. I do not have great relationship with my parents, siblings, or friends. I've had 2 best friends, one now. But even then I just feel so detached and not a very close relationship to them. There was a lot of stuff that happened in my childhood that I just shrugged off and made decisions to cope with it as a child, and the adult me still follows those decisions that a child (me) made. Yet I was merely a child, I did not have the experience or knowledge how to deal with or cope with the problems I solved on my own, or thought I solved. The only person I ever talked to was myself. I never felt like I had a relationship with my parents growing up, the only person I was close to was my older sister, but once she hit age 10 and went through puberty she detached herself from me. (I was 8) After that the only friends I really had was whenever my mom got dogs or cats, but usually we ended up getting rid of them or a few died. So I stopped wanting pets because it just killed me even more inside having to lose them.

I want to solve why I feel so abandoned, and fix it. I go in my head and picture me trying to explain to my dad that I have abandonment issues and try to explain my past to him and how I see things. I feel like he would just say IDK to me like he usually does, or when I talk to him he just seems so vacant like I am just talking to myself. Or just say stop always blaming me for the things in the past, stop living in the past. Or just turn it into one of his silly stupid jokes. Then if I ever try to talk to my mom, she just becomes so defensive and think she is the victim for everything. I can't say anything that I seen in the past or felt about her in the past without her flipping her shit and denying any of that to ever happen... My sister... I do not know how to go about it. She just feels like a stranger to me most of the time.

Please any help, criticism or just want to be my friend ... Anything will due before I go crazy and flip my shit for once... Just saying my ""flip my ship"" has been suppressed for so long I'm scared to she what will happen if I lose it...",,False,self,t5_2qtp9,False,,,True,t3_1gamaf,http://www.reddit.com/r/Needafriend/comments/1gamaf/22m/,

I'm a student living in the Netherlands (Working on finishing my Bachelor at the moment), active in student association (I think the US/Canadian folks among you call them frats) and generally procrastinate a lot on Reddit during the day. Right now I'm looking to go study in a different field for my master; looking into environmental policy, climate change and energy systems.

The things I'm mostly into are music (I play Bass and Saxophone, listen to a wide range of music), International Affairs (I'm an armed conflict nut, like to read about them and follow their developments) but I'd also very much like to learn about daily things that you guys do in other countries than my own.

Other hobbies I have is reading and occasionally writing and hopelessly trying to be good at any video game I play. I go out with friends often so I won't be able to contact you on an hourly basis, but I'll try to make plenty of time for our conversation. I'm a bit of a blunt person, forgive me for that, but I try to develop myself into a great listener so please help me with that.

I guess it should be easier to open up for me to a stranger than to somebody who I know. Looking for someone who writes passionately about the things you do. You might have the same hobbies as I do, or just be somebody who thinks the things I do are interesting and who has some nice things to talk about him/herself.

Yes, I will most likely bring up God when we talk. Jesus/God is a large part of my life and there is no way to not bring it up in some sort of way. That being said, I'm not doing this to evangelize to you or to push God on you. It's just a part of who I am and what I'm about.

I play a lot of games, read a lot of books and watch a lot of telly. Occasionally like to take a walk through the countryside with a nice spliff. I'm trying to get into woodworking, just have to find the money for tools and supplies first.

I don't have a computer at the moment so we'd have to talk using a service I can access from my phone, but I have apps for most of the major messaging services, so that shouldn't present too much of a problem.

1361211975.0,4,self.Needafriend,18rhr8,My thoughts,6,2,4,http://www.reddit.com/r/Needafriend/comments/18rhr8/my_thoughts/,"Hi reddit, I just wanted to type some of my thoughts because life is getting at me, and it helps me when I can see them in black and white. I don't really know where to start, so we'll go from the beginning.
I often think about my upbringing, and how my life could have changed in different ways depending on how things could have gone. My parents divorced before I could remember, a lot of people's do and I know I'm not special, and my Mother and I lived alone for a few years before we moved to North Carolina so we could live with my new stepdad that was in the Air Force. He always seemed nice to me, he tried to bring me back interesting animals every night; frogs, centipedes, praying mantises, snakes, things a little kid thought would be cool. It was nice having him around because I couldn't even remember my father, I only had a small picture and a piece of a blanket that belonged to him, but I cherished them greatly. In the Carolinas my first half brother was born, and stress mounted at the house. Eventually there was a divorce and we moved back to our home in Ohio.
I started elementary in a small school, and I finally met my dad, a dark skinned, short haired man that looked just like a big version of me. I was so excited to have that void filled, he had a great sense of humor, and he always tried to make time for me. Eventually he decided that my mom didn't deserve custody and he ran away with me, we were found two months later and he went to jail for two years. My mom pushed so hard for him to go to jail, and I hated her for it, she was ripping open the void again.
Eventually my mom met a new man, her current husband, and we moved to a new town around a half hour away from our home town. My dad got out of jail, and he got me every other weekend. I remember waiting at the window at six o clock Friday nights, just waiting for his headlights to peak over the horizon. I also remember more than a handful of teary nights of him calling and telling me that the weather was too bad, or he was just feeling sick, and how it tore me up inside. But I didn't show it, big boys didn't cry, my dad never did, so why would I?
School was always shit, I never made friends, people always hurt you, so I never let anyone close enough to do it. I grew up a shut in, antisocial weirdo. People thought of me as that one kid that didn't do anything. My grades were average in K-5, but 6-12 I had a spark of intelligence, I could keep my grades high, and I was finally proud of myself. I went on my first date at age 15 with a girl a grade below me. She was nervous, I was terrified. We were both outcasts brought together by one of my cousins, she gave me my first kiss, where I was basically having a mini seizure because of how bad I was shaking.
High school was repetitive, people were assholes, and I was still with the same girl. I joined a sport and made some temporary friends that liked to lift and talk sports. I knew the friendships wouldn't last, but hanging out with someone felt good. At sixteen, I saw my girlfriends tits and vag, but we never had sex because she was too scared, even though I told people we did if they asked me. She wouldn't give bj's or hand jobs because she thought it was trashy, and I tried to ask her why she thought that. Then I found out she was sexually abused by the fourteen year old boy that loved next door when she was seven or eight. I never brought up sexual questions after that. We went on dates and made out in public a lot because we didn't have anywhere we could be by ourselves. Before we met she was very depressed, and I tried to fix her and make her happy. She seems to have gotten better, but now we constantly argue over little, unimportant things, and I've grown tired of fighting and this relationship. But, I'm afraid she'll do something drastic if I break up with her. She thinks everything is fine, and wants us to get married out of highschool, I'm graduating and she has one more year, but I want to leave her.
I always thought college would be the best path for me, smart people go to college to get high paying jobs, right? I dunno now, I like playing instruments and I always wanted to be an entertainer, odd for someone who was such a social outcast when I think about it. Even getting my first guitar shocked everyone, I just ordered one online on a whim. I've already been accepted to a college in wisconsin for game art and animation, but I feel it's more of the one thing I know that I will be successful at if I go to school for it. I don't really think that it will make me happy. Now I've been thinking about just getting in my car with my SSN and birth certificate and starting over somewhere new.
I started working at a McDonalds last November, and I met a girl there who always seemed like a total bitch. But because of the attitude that I get at work, very upbeat and sarcastic, I eventually got closer to her. She's dating a marine recruit out in basic, but she doesn't know if she wants to be with him, he proposed to her as soon as she graduated, last year, and she said no. We often talk about our lives and when I'm with her I feel comfortable, but she has a built in defense to be an asshole when there are other people around so they don't want to be around her and so they can't hurt her. She did help me with my confidence some, she even told me that if she wasn't dating someone she would've tried going out with me. I really doubt it considering I'm an emotionally confused wreck with acne and scars covering most of my body. But it does make me feel good to be around her. I don't really think she's going to break up with her boyfriend, I think she just wants someone to listen to her for once so she can stop being the punching bag.
Graduation is coming up soon and I don't really want to go to college, I want to be a musician. I know that I've come very far from picking up my first guitar two years ago, and I think my voice is decent enough that some people could enjoy me playing. Now I mainly think about breaking up with my girlfriend or getting in my car and driving until I can't drive any more. I don't really care anymore.

So, I hate talking about myself, but I'll give it a try. I'm not looking for something romantic (yet), as I just got out of a long distance relationship. Im still sort of figuring out and getting over what happened, and I dont want to jump into anything just yet. I really am looking to establish myself and a nice group of friends, even if it is just online at the moment. What I really want is just some companionship.

So, lets get to a little about me. Right now Im working as a web designer. Most of the day i sit around building websites and looking at reddit. I'm a total geek, plain and true. I love gadgets, trinkets, and gizmos. I enjoy tinkering and taking stuff apart. In my spare time I like to play video games (Mostly on PC), but occasionally at night I'll curl up with a book, usually fantasy or sci-fi. Occasionally I'll draw and doodle when Im bored. I love animals; I have a few cats, and a turtle. I like turtles.

What I'd like in a friend is someone who I can talk to naturally. Someone who shares some of my interests, but will also introduce me to some new things. Someone who can be a total geek with me, or just bitch about our days together. Someone who I can play games with, but also be okay with the silence of not talking sometimes.

As for me, I'm a 3D animator(some background in 2d), I've been working in the industry for the past 2 years. I love watching animated shows/movies. I don't go to parties, I don't do drugs and I live by myself in a tiny little apartment. It's literally a room with a kitchen in it. 

As for TV Shows, New Girl, Modern Family, Walking Dead, Adventure Time, Gravity Falls... I watch a lot of tv...

Movies: Anything really, Cloudy With a chance of meatballs, Pitch Perfect, Skyfall, Hotel Rwanda... Hard to remember these things

Games: I'm terrible at starcraft 2, but I love it. I don't have time to really keep up with all the vods.

I'm a big hockey fan. I'm glad hockey's back.

I guess I just really need someone to talk to, Doesn't matter where you're from... Sometimes you need someone to get off your chest or joke around about nothing. 

This is also my first thread thing, So hopefully I'm doing it right.

It was a lot easier online since I'm a rather socially anxious person. And sometimes it's great to have someone completely unbiased listen to your real life problems and stories just for the sake of listening/telling them or maybe to exchange some advice.

I love books (especially Terry Pratchett and Friedrich Dürrenmatt at the moment, but I read books from almost every genre and I'd like to catch up on some English classics soon as well) and have always liked games, usually RPGs. My favorite there is rather boring, DA:O, but I've spent lots of time with Oblivion, Torchlight, Minecraft, Darksiders, and Risen lately.

It's my assumption that most girls who post here get the most interest (go figure) from everyone and most guys here get little to none. That being said I'm taking my chances of this post actually drawing any attention very low.

But the truth is I am looking for someone to talk to on a Semi regular basis. I guess preferably a guy that way my girlfriend won't get jealous and pull the whole ""your talking to other girls on the Internet. Omg you'd don't love me"" card and go crazy.. Insecurities a bitch am I right?. It's happened before in the past. I just get along better with girlsI guess. never really has too many guy friends growing up .

Anyways now that we got that out if the way. Now seems to be the part where I talk a little bit about myself. ill keep it kind of short and sweet since this post is getting to be a little bit long. 

I'm 24 male living in San Diego California, dropped out of high school for a number of reasons and now I want to get my GED . I work from home, where I record music for locals. Mainly hip hop. I hate today's hip hop music btw. But it pays a decent amount. I've been getting into film scoring as well. I had an opportunity to record and produce for a small indie movie and a bigger movie that's coming out this year staring William  Defoe.

I guess you would be able to say that working on music is my passion. I don't really see it like that anymore. I've become more jaded and critical of music so much I can't seem to enjoy it anymore. I could rant about this subject and go on and on but ill save it for later.

I grew up kinda sheltered by living with my grand parents. I lived in one of those senior apartments because my grandmother managed them. So that ment friends weren't really allowed to come over. So because of that I never really developed proper social skills through out school. I was the shy kid, almost like a shadow. I observed a lot and still do about my surroundings.  I am the guy who doesn't say much. I guess it's difficult for me to make friends because of all the friends I had growing up always used to take advantage of my kindness or just wanted something from me. Even to this day I question people's motives, the little friends I do have. That's bad I guess but it is what it is.

i like movies, i like computers and building them, i like technology. 
i'm into retro video gaming. i used to like playing guitar / music.

i use the word hate a lot instead of 'don't like'.
i hate people who are fake, dishonest, and only out for themselves.
i hate most everything on tv. i feel it is programming people to get dumber.
i hate how gas is 4 something in my area.

i love the beach, but could do without the people.
i hate people who are into 'whats cool' or 'trendy' just to be accepted.
sheeple. i hate sheeple

If not then in a few days I will repost this as a female looking for friends to see if my assumption about girls getting all the comments is right.

I'm posting this here because I feel like my friendships have started to settle into a grind of sorts, and I really want to meet new people. I'm down to talk to anyone about anything, interests aren't terribly relevant, but here's a quick rundown of myself:

I live in a tiny town in the southern United States where I'm homeschooled, and those two factors in tandem have basically hampered the amount of people I have available to talk to. As far as interests go, a lot of my passion is for music. I play piano, guitar and clarinet (but I'm not really a master at any of them), and I'm almost always listening to some form of music. I predominantly listen to metal of some sort, but I like just about everything to some extent, from classic rock to twee bubblegum pop music. I'd love to have someone to chat with about music of any kind - even if you don't like metal, I love being introduced to new things to listen to!

Aside from that, I like writing the occasional poem, singing, jogging, going swimming, playing video games of various sorts, and watching whatever show finds its way to the television station I'm currently surfing. Personality-wise, I'm open and trusting and I like helping others; and while I'm not exactly depressed I have my moments of gloominess, but I try to glow as best as I can whenever I'm not stuck in those moments.

Again, I don't really have any preferences as far as actual people go - I'm willing to talk to males or females, whether they're around my age or in their twenties (most of the people I currently talk to are older than me, anyways, so it shouldn't be too awkward). Thanks in advance!

I think most people would say I've had it good in general. I consistently do well in school, I'm have no major illnesses and I live in a Western country. However, there's also something in which I have not been quite as fortunate: Family.

My parents (both refugees from war-torn countries), have never had a healthy relationship. They used to fight a lot, and my dad used to beat my mother. Not often, but it happened. When I was around 8 they divorced and my father moved to another country to be with another woman. He left us in a major debt, which devastated my mother. He still kept contact with me and my sister and frequently flew us over. However, it was just unbearable to see my mother crying everyday, working a minimum wage, going to school in the evening and not even getting a job out of it (to this very day she's a cleaner who works full-time for minimum wage). For that reason, my feelings for my father have always been ambiguous; he treats me well but he treats my mother like crap..

After a year or so my father broke up with this woman and came back to the country we resided in, but he lived in a different city, under dismal circumstances. Slowly my father came back into our lives again (he persisted) and he and my mother reconciled, but their relationship was extremely weird. A divorced couple, who would sometimes behave like a married couple (for the sake of the children) and sometimes would physically fight. Instead of helping us, they ruined a big part of my and my sister's childhood. So there were a lot of periods (which could last for months) in which my father didn't speak to my mother, and we would always have no cash. So from very young, I was tasked to go to my father and ask him for money, which I hated. I understood my mom, but I hated it. If we were low on money, I was blamed. Because my father loved me the most, I was given these tasks. 

This has caused my relationship with my mother to be strained, my relationship with my sister was also very hostile (she hates me) and I hated my father too much to bond with him. Fastforward a couple of years, and my mother and father have another such period in which they hate eachother, but this time it lasts for almost a year. He gets another girlfriend, I forgot to tell this to my mother, and as my mother was on her way to visit her dying mother abroad, she sees them together, and she is taken by surprise and it killed her inside. Naturally, she was also very mad at me; and I hated myself, my father and everybody. 

When she came back all hell broke loose and after years of problems at home, I couldn't handle this stuff anymore and I decided to move in with my father, in his studio apartment (i.e, it has 1 room + a kitchen and a bathroom). My father never really gets mad at me or bother me, but I'm breaking my mother's heart. She called me yesterday begging me to come back but I don't know what to do... on the one hand we have a home where I'm constantly having arguments and such but with my mother whom I love a lot, on the other hand we have a (shitty) home but where I can focus my energy on positive things, but I live with a father whom I see as a dirty old man and a traitor. My mother's phone call has been on my mind since yesterday and I haven't slept. Also, I can't talk about this to anyone because I don't trust anyone to keep it a secret.

&gt;Hobbies consists of gaming, writing, watching TV, comics, and biking. Although I don't do the last one quite as often anymore. In terms of games, I like to think of myself as an avid gamer. I play a wide range of games from FPS to MMORPGs, currently my more often played game is: WoW and GW2. It's a habit that I'm not too fond of, but it does make me happy. When it comes to writing, I don't do it often, but I do like to write non-fiction short stories. I did a small series back in grade 11 to get my English class credits. (I wasn't the best at school, but creating stories was something I did very well.) Watching TV is something I usually do to finish the day. I usually watch an episode of a show I'm watching a night. I watch a lot of shows but mainly in the fiction catergory (sci-fi, supernatural dramas - I'm a bit of a monster nut)

We're both natural introverts, and tend to be homebodies. She's busy with grad school, and I'm busy with work so most of the time we just want to veg out on the weekends. Combine that with the fact that we've moved a good portion away from where we grew up and any friends we had, we've been feeling pretty lonely as of late. A lot of our friends we grew up with also moved away and/or we just fell out of touch/lost interest. I'm basically in a position where I feel like, aside from her and one or two people from high school and college, I don't feel like I have any close friends anymore. :( 

Any friends I've ever made, now that I think of it, I made either from work or school, something I was forced to do. I've got enough social anxiety that prevents me from putting myself out there and going somewhere by myself to meet new people. It's not crippling in that I can't go out at all ever, but the idea of doing something as simple as going to a local comic store to play some Magic with new people for the first time is incredibly daunting and paralyzing. It's something I struggle with, and am actively working on.

Growing up, I didn't have a lot of close friends IRL, though I did have a lot of acquaintances. I had a lot of close friends online (I lost contact with all of them long ago), and thinking back its something I miss dearly. I have fond memories of many late nights staying up with them, having hours upon hours of discussion about video games, movies, problems in our lives, etc. I'd love to meet some new people and try to find that again.

In my day job I work as a Web Application Developer. I'm a geek, I'm obsessed with video games, TV, movies, any kind of entertainment medium. I used to read a lot, but not as much as I used to. I burned myself out with a lot of fiction (and trying to write some), and so I've been reading non-fiction when I can. 

This year, I've realized that making games is what I want to do with my life. I felt this a few years ago when I just started going to college for Computer Science, but felt like I didn't possess the skill set I needed to be able to do it. Seven years later, everything just clicked and I completed my first game in years last month. I'm obsessed and addicted to creating/designing, and I don't see myself ever stopping. I'm a bit of a workaholic in that regard. Games are in a very special point right now in their evolution, and its exciting to see all the creative stuff happening, especially in the indie community, to push the medium forward.

Hmm, what else. I'm obsessed with Breaking Bad, Lost, Mad Men, Arrested Development, Home Movies, and whatever classic shows were on Nick at Nite in the 90s. I'm kind of adverse to voice chat in general,  especially unless I know you IRL or we've known each other for a while. For IM I mainly use Steam and Pidgin. I'm potentially up for RL as well if you're in the Pittsburgh area.

About Me:

Interests:

* Programming
* Blackhat 
* Online Monetizing
* Philosophy
* Computers
* Gaming (Particularly enjoy Minecraft)
* Chilling

Beliefs:

* Amoral (I don't have a moral code.)
* Atheist (I don't follow a religious belief.)
* Apolitical (I don't believe that in any system whole heartily)
* Moral Nihilist (I believe morality is broken, and don't believe it exists outside of a subjective being.)

Other Notes:
*I tend to make racist/sexist jokes.* If you are sensitive to such things I believe I might offend you. *I am not racist/sexist.* As far as I know. 

*I don't tend to judge*, in that if you told me you do something people consider wrong, signs of a mental illness, or illegal I really am supportive in the sense I believe that if that is what you enjoy go at it. I am even curious so I might ask questions...

I have so much free time because I am getting into programming, that's my chosen career. So although I have a lot of free time, I do tend to me doing something that is worthwhile. Which is not to say I am not completely ready to hang out whilst doing so, or even drop what I am doing to play something with you, or help you out.

Nothing really to loose, Well anyways PM me for my AIM username if you want to give this a test drive and see if hanging out could work. I will be online all week. Most likely doing some research into something random. Drop by and if things don't work out, just say I don't think we are compatible, and we will say our goodbyes. It'z Simplez.

I was home schooled so I didn't really get a chance to be part of a social ecosystem, especially because up until a few years ago I more or less flat out refused to be social in way or another.

And don't get me wrong I've had my chances within those last couple of years. I had a job for awhile, as well as attended a community college on campus. I met quite a few people, and had many a conversation. But I just never met anyone I was interested in getting to know. 

So do I want a friend, someone to help me, just to rant, or all of the above? I'm not sure I'm a bit confused myself, for the longest time I had convinced myself that I wanted to be alone. But the longer I abstain from being social the more discontented I grow. Maybe just getting it off my chest will help who knows.

I live in the middle of the Caribbean Sea in a tiny island called Dominican Republic. I don't care about your race, religious belief or lack of, sexual preference, cultural upbringing,etc. I have learned to accept and love everyone as they are. I don't want to change you, I want to love you. No matter how strange/unusual others may find what you think/feel, I don't judge nor see the point on doing that.

I am at the same time a scientist/philosopher/artist/writer/healer/spiritualist/counselor. My #1 priority in life is to understand and figure out more about this reality we belong to. To tackle the hard question of life and find our purpose here. For me fame, money, power,etc are not appealing at all. What I care about is about love in all is manifestations, truth and wisdom.

I enjoy learning and reading a lot. I read about everything under the sun because of my curious nature. I also like good stories, no matter the medium. Be video games, movies, anime, tv-series, books, myths...it is well written I want to know about it. 

I listen to music a lot...but I don't have a particular genre although I feel draw to some instruments( piano, violin and harp). The songs I like usually tell a story and are attached to a particular memory of my life.

If my words inspire you, feel free to ask me anything. My life is an open book for those that care enough to ask. If you follow a similar path, think we could help each other :).

I spent way too long thinking about how to phrase this message, and eventually decided to start this message with what I am writing now. This creates a shared emotion with others who have done the same thing - and the apparent honesty behind writing out my motivations in doing so looks good, as does what I wrote and am writing.

Yes, I can be a little crazy. Anyway, on to my interests and passions. 

I am passionate about politics(the substantive problems of running a government more than the scheming), learning about stuff, and martial arts. I am interested in the sciences in general, pysch and other fields that relate to politics especially. Also philosophy, debate, reading, history, and a heck of a lot of other things. Basically, if it is considered to be intellectual, I probably like it.

I also enjoy watching good TV shows like Doctor who or Game of Thrones, or reading good books like a Game of Thrones or the LOTR, playing video games, and talking about more random stuff. 

People around my age would be nice, but I am also interested in the wisdom of the ancients - anyone over 20 falls into the latter category. Having someone wiser than I to guide me as I learn about the world, and especially about politics and philosophy would be awesome. You too can be a wise mentor figure who is killed a quarter of the way into the story. Especially poli-sci or international relations majors -or similiar fields. I am planning in majoring in one of those for college.

Or just peers to learn from each other and talk about stuff. Either gender is great.

1376604339.0,3,self.Needafriend,1kg4xx,[F/19/US] - I have reached a low point in my life and I am struggling to get through it without friends to talk to. Very interested in connecting with some like-minded online friends!,3,0,2,http://www.reddit.com/r/Needafriend/comments/1kg4xx/f19us_i_have_reached_a_low_point_in_my_life_and_i/,"Hello!

As the title states, I am going through some shit. I just graduated high school, and I have had a very lonely and depressing summer vacation. I recently (~2 months) ended a relationship with my boyfriend of 2.5 years, and I have found it very difficult to cope with his absence, as he was also my best friend. There are some other factors at play, including some weight and eating related issues, but I don't feel the immediate need to explain all of that unhappy stuff. :&lt; 

I know that I need someone to talk to who I can also bitch to about my life and how sorry I feel for myself, so keep that in mind, haha. I am also a very good listener, though!

My interests include cooking, fitness, reading, biology, nature-y stuff, video games, and many other things! If you are of similar interest, it would be great to get to know you. c: 

I hope this post does not read too awkwardly, I am not a frequent poster and my communication skills have deteriorated recently. :P If you made it through, I thank you.
