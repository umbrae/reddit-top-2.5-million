so the prizes we have decided on are Blackwidow Ultimate and the Death Adder from the guys at razer, and also a razer invicta supplied from our own /u/heartlessfate! big thanks to him for making this giveaway even better.

now on to how to enter yourself, to remove some stress and make the randomizing easier since reddit doesn't leave comments in chronological order, ive decided to create a Google doc to store all your information and to select a random winner on june the 4th.

A couple of weeks ago I got the idea to make some macros to make surfing the internet and my programs on my taskbar a lot quicker. The following macros were made:

* WIN-1 to 7 (for the programs located on my taskbar)
* ALT-F4 (for closing programs that are on the foreground)
* CTRL-W (for closing tabs in my browser (Chrome in my instance)
* CTRL-TAB(for toggling between full screen and maximized mode in Mediaplayer Classis)
* ENTER(for pressing ""enter"" obviously :) )
* WIN(for opening my start-menu, for reaching all the other programs I don't use very often.)

Macro placement (on side buttons 1-12):

* -1 to 7 = WIN-1 to 7
* -8 = ALT-F4
* -9 = CTRL-W
* -10 = CTRL-TAB
* -11 = ENTER
* -12 = WIN

Reasons for some of the button placement:

* -7 &amp; 10 (The seventh program on my taskbar is Mediaplayer Classic, so when I open a movie I can easily reach fullscreen by using my thumb.)
* -8 &amp; 9 (Because they're both macrod to close something it's easy to remember without looking.)
* -8 &amp; 11 (Sometimes when you close a program you get a message which asks if you are sure you want to close the program, almost always the ""OK"" or ""accept"" button is already selected and you only have to press ""ENTER"" or in my case, the side button under 8 which is 11 which is efficient in my opinion.

For me, using my computer went a lot faster because of this. I only have to use my keyboard for typing now. The reason I'm sharing this little bit of knowledge with your guys it so make 'using you PC' more fun, so... Have fun! :D

I hope this will bring you some ideas of your own, you may always use this configuration if you so please.

&gt;We've had some feedback from customers who placed their pre-orders for the Razer Blade and have not received their order despite the fact we've already started shipping and I've looked into the situation. 
&gt;
&gt;Our launch pre-orders are taken and processed on a First-In-First-Out (FIFO) basis but as our launch inventory is spread out in distribution centers throughout North America – the more popular DCs are depleted of stock faster than some of the other DCs – so if you’re based in the range of a DC with a lot of pre-orders, your order may be shipped later than someone who may have placed his order later in a DC that has fewer pre-orders. 
&gt;
&gt;If you're one of the affected parties, we apologize for this and are now manually prioritizing routing of the units on a unit by unit basis (i.e. manually processing and moving units around from DCs to you)- we should be able to pull in the schedule significantly from what has been updated to you. 
&gt;
&gt;Again - this is only for customers who placed their pre-orders and have not received their order and we apologize for this as the demand has just been incredible for the new Razer Blade. 
&gt;
&gt;This situation only applies to launch quantities as our follow up shipments from the main warehouse are done on a as-demand basis and we should be able to catch up to committed shipment dates shortly.
&gt;
&gt;We apologize for the inconvenience and we hope to address it as soon as possible.


As someone that got that same dreaded message, I'm glad to read that they're doing everything possible to fulfill the prerelease orders.

Hope that this helps relieve someone else's stress too!

This 14"" model is the newest rendition of the Razer Blade laptop and is sported as the worlds thinnest gaming laptop with only a thickness of .66 in., but do not let its small size put you off this laptop this laptop has impressive stats for it's tiny form factor so lets see what's under the hood.

    
Future 4th gen Intel® Core™
    processor (formerly codename Haswell)
   
 8GB onboard memory
    (DDR3L-1600MHz)
    
NVIDIA® GeForce®
    GTX 765M (2GB GDDR5
    VRAM, Optimus™ Technology)
    
14.0"" HD+ 16:9 Ratio, 1600x900,
    with LED backlight
    
256GB SATA III SSD

As you can see this thing is packing some heat! It has the same exact specs as it's brother the Razer Blade Pro, but with a smaller frame it couldn't fit all of the awesomeness that is on the pro it is missing the Switchblade UI and has a resolution for 1600x900, but it is still a device to not be messed with if you want portability over some functionality then this is the device for you!

So /r/Razer what do you think about the Thinnest gaming laptop in the world?

The issue im having is probably something unrelated to Razer but would still like to get an opinion or a solution even from you guys.

Ive been using the Razer Naga for 3 years now probably and this issue has just appeared around 2 weeks ago.

So basically the left click is sort of stuck, when compared to the right click it takes me much more strength to get it to click, i have a feeling that something may have gotten stuck under the left click button. Since im playing LoL almost exclusively there is no way my left click could 'die' before the right click. It still could be just something trivial or an aging issue.

For years I've been lamenting the non-existence of a mechanical version of the n52/Nostromo. After paying nearly as much as a top-of-the-line Razer keyboard, I finally got my Orbweaver. There was a moment of excitement opening the box, and then a severe disappointment.

* The thin metal connecting the thumb piece to the mainbody causes it to wobble almost a quarter of an inch either way, even when I'm just pushing the buttons normally.

* The lack of onboard settings means the device is unusable without Synapse installed, which would be a letdown *even if Synapse worked*, but it doesn't: Switching keymaps takes nearly an entire second, during which the other keys might respond to the first keymap, the second one, or their default command, more-or-less at random.

* Cherry blue switches feel *awful* for a gamepad like this. A linear switch like Cherry red switches would feel far superior. I have Cherry brown switches in my Das Keyboard which I would rather use than the blue switches. Even rubber domes don't feel as pitifully cheap as the Orbweaver's keys.

* The palm rest, while tackier than the n52/Nostromo, has a much sharper edge on the front, making it extremely uncomfortable after even fifteen minutes. The two-position adjustment doesn't help, either. You get steep and sharp, or flat and cramp-inducing.

* The joystick's tiny range of motion makes it impossible to feel the difference between neighboring directions. I had to disable the diagonals completely to avoid accidentally pressing them, and found myself subconsciously avoiding the joystick entirely. It is also completely textureless, ruining the sense of direction necessary due to the angle.

Again, I *really* wanted to love this product, but with software problems that fail to uphold even the most basic features, and hardware that feels terrible and is poorly designed, I have no other choice but to return it. I truly hope Razer makes significant and fundamental changes to this product, and I will be happy to see what they come up with. An ergonomic, mechanical gamepad has a steady market in people who take PC gaming seriously, and I respect Razer's attempt at coming up with a solution, but they missed the mark in a huge way.

My Epic Naga died before the new year and it was under warranty so I contacted Razer.  A tech quickly replied with a well put together list of things to try (updating drivers, flashing firmware, etc).  I was certain this would not fix the issue but tried everything they suggested.  The rep then tells me he is passing me to the RMA department to get my mouse swapped out.  I am then contacted by a level 1 who asks the same questions.  Then passes me to another level 1, and another until I go through 6 level 1's and finally one of them actually passes me to the RMA Dept.

The mouse they send me to replace mine is ""carved"" like if a drunk tried to make a tribal down the side of the mouse with a box cutter.  Their support is adamant that it was not them and have me ship it back and they will send me another mouse after jumping through RMA hoops (Which is fine).

Get my second RMA and this mouse is DOA.  I contact them and get the initial list, which is frustrating considering the first RMA worked fine but was cosmetically damaged. They then ask me to take a picture of the mouse with the serial clearly visible which I do and makes sense.  Then they ask for a picture of the box with a number on it, except the box is a plain white box with no useful markings.  Now they ask for my previous RMA number which is still in the trail of emails I am replying to.

Here is the kicker, when I give them the RMA number I get a canned response about sending Razer my previous tracking number to locate my lost device.  I responded twice and have not heard back from them since.

I have owned a lot of Razer products but I think I am done.  I work for a post secondary in IT and all my co workers are telling me to jump ship and buy a Logitech or Corsair mouse and I think Razer has left me no choice.  I would have gladly shelled out for a new Razer mouse once my warranty replacement died but i'm not buying a 130$ mouse that lasts 10 months when they care so little about their customers. Sad because they have the best looking stuff.

TLDR Razer tossed me in a circle 6 times through support, send me 2 bad RMA's, and then won't respond to me.

Followup - After messaging the CEO of the company on twitter, the company on twitter, and on facebook I have received an email from a floor supervisor.  I explained everything and am now waiting to see what they do.

I just got my new Razer Ouroboros and I love it. But there's something that bothers me : the right click button constantly does a horrible squeaky noise. Does anyone else have the same problem ?
I swear it's annoying. Buying an elite gaming mouse and get something that happens to sound like a $5 mouse at the mall .. If only it was a side button, but this is my most used button for SC2 and LoL ! 

I already sent a mail to Razer support, but if someone had an advice to make this stop .. I'd be happy

Thanks in anticipation !

Hey Brad,

Thank you for contacting the Razer Support Center. I am glad to hear your interest in the Razer Brand. 

As of right now we can't provide you with an exact price for replacing the battery on a Blade (since the price will be affected by the cost of labor). If the unit is within warranty, we will replace the battery free of charge.

For more information, please check our warranty terms:

I was wondering why won't Razer release glass made mouse pads. I bought an Ironclad months ago but I always get back to my glass made mousepad: Icemat 2nd which is 10 years old. The feeling, glide and quality of glass made mousepads is awesome.
I would really love to see glass made mousepads from Razer. My entire equipment is Razer based: 
	- Mouse: Deathadder 2013
	- Headset: Tiamat 7.1 and Kraken for my iPod
	- Keyboard: BlackWidow Ultimate 2013
	- etc.
But for some reason once you try out that glass glide feeling you always get back to it.


Thank you for your time and I hope you consider this idea :D

Note: ¿Any other glass made mousepad fan over here?

I work information security, and I play a lot of video games. Out of all the peripheral companies I have purchased from, I have received the MOST GRIEF from Razer. While some of their products have worked solidly for me, such as the Blackwidow Ultimate keyboard, other products have not. I had previously owned a Razer Carcharias, and when that quit I figured it was just because of the age of the headphones, about two years. Constant packing must have done them in I thought, so I went ahead and purchased a Megalodon on November 5th. About 4 months into owning it, the cable connection between the usb cable that goes from the sound unit to the computer came loose. It is now almost impossible to get sound to and from the unit without fiddling around for half an hour. While something as small as this would normally warrant me just contacting technical support and trying to get a replacement, I have had the exact same thing happen to the two nagas that I have had; namely the Naga I purchased two years ago (that the same cable came loose within the year), and after a SteelSeries stint, a Naga Epic I purchased last July. The naga epic has issues with the input cutting off randomly, like you have something stuck in the laser-well. I've contacted support multiple times on this issue, and while almost every time they sent a replacement cable for it, the issue persists. And I know it's a cable issue because if I put it into wireless mode it doesn't have the problem.

To build upon hardware issues, the Razer Synapse program also bricked my Blackwidow Ultimate during an upgrade, and it took me a few hours to download the old legacy software to re-flash the firmware back to normal and get the darn thing working again. While an issue with the keyboard, I would still chalk this up to Razer Synapse not doing its job properly. I'm not running anything special either, just plain jane ol' Windows 7 on my gaming laptop.

All in all, while I have received some customer service from Razer on these issues, I just wanted to share with you the rather lackluster performance I have gotten from these peripherals. I understand that during mass production that some units may come out a little bit off, and some may not work, and I get that. I've ordered plenty of items off the internet to have it show up dead on arrival. But no other company has really given me this many issues with all the stuff I buy from them.

I was considering buying a razer blade for my next gaming laptop, but, after losing a rather expensive battleship in EVE because my stupid mouse keeps cutting out, I've been reminded of the poor track record that Razer has given the impression of, and I will in all likelihood do some more research before purchasing another razer product.",,False,self,t5_2ssha,False,,,True,t3_1fwyzy,http://www.reddit.com/r/razer/comments/1fwyzy/nearly_every_single_razer_product_i_have_bought/,

'We’ve heard our UK fans with regards to the unauthorized UK RazerStore promo code. The community is always first and we’d like to do right by you. Hear what our CEO &amp; Chief Gamer Min-Liang Tan has to say about this.
A few days ago, a coupon code that provided a discount of 90% off Razer products at our UK Razerzone store went viral and thousands of orders were placed in the space of a couple of hours. This coupon code was NOT authorized nor approved by Razer and was generated by a third party to test our shopping cart (and left in our system unknown to us till now). When we discovered this, we had to shut down our site for a bit until we figured out what was going on.
While we have the option of cancelling the orders legally, we’ve always had a customer comes first policy at Razer and in respect of this incident, we have decided to honor the orders that were placed using the unauthorized code by Razer fans buying single products for their own use. Unfortunately, as the products are being sold well below their cost, it will likely cost us an insane amount of losses to make good on the orders which will really really hurt us as we’re still a small company - that much said, we want to do right by the community. For orders in the multiples of units for a single product, we will still give each an opportunity to purchase one item of each product ordered at the 90% off discount but not for multiple units of the same product. Our focus is on doing the right thing for our fans, the gamers and the community, not for resellers or users to profit from this. That’s not gaming, that’s not our deal.
So that’s the plan. It’s going to take a few weeks (and up to a few months in certain cases) to get all these orders processed and shipped—a lot of stuff was already back-ordered due to high demand—and we ask that customers please bear with us. We apologize to anyone miffed or confused by this week’s happenings in the U.K., we appreciate everyone’s patience, and we thank all of our customers for their support. Game on…'

I've tried other games like TF2, CS, FarCry 3 and there weren't really any issues like what I get with Dota 2.

Any ideas or anyone experience a similar problem? I really like this mouse and if I can't get it to work soon will need to return it and try a different brand but would have no idea what to get since I love the DA's!

I have a pair of the green Blacksharks I bought from the Razer online store shortly after they became available. I love the headphones, they sound great and have a nice style. However when im walking or when I tilt my head slightly they sound all loose inside. I find this infuriatingly distracting as I feel like im wearing some cheapo 5 dollar cans.

I sent them back and they said and I quote:

""I'm sorry to hear that the BlackShark is not matching your expectations. The BlackShark is heavily based on military aviation headset standards, which means a rugged headset that use a lot of metal moving parts. If you look at where the headband connects to the left and right speaker housing, you will see a metal bracket on the headband designed to limit the rotation of the ear cups. The metal-on-metal contact is what is causing your issue, and you can try to limit the metal-to-metal contact to eliminate the noise. ""

I solved the issue by putting a piece of paper on the metal part like pictured.

I was searching on how to do this because it was annoying having to tab to the Itunes player to go to the next song.  All the sources I found involved 3rd party software or something other that was unnecessary. 

To do this simply go to the Macro creator in Razer Synapse, create a new macro, press record, and enter the function key + the F key that corresponds with whatever you want the macro to be(Next or Previous).

Now normally after hitting the key a down key stroke would register after lifting your fingers, but it won't. Therefore, press and hold any random key on your keyboard. This will create a down keystroke in the recorder.  While still holding the key, press the record button again to stop recording and click the little pencil mark above the recording area. Click the down key's letter to edit that key and press the Function key + the F key with which you pressed the first time creating a down stroke for that key allowing the macro to work.

I have Next/Previous macro'd to F1 and F2 and Pause on Macro Key 3. Hope this helps someone looking for a similar way to do this and I was thorough enough in the instructions.

Also, I did this on the latest version of Razer Synapse on a Razer BlackWidow Ultimate 2013. :P",,False,self,t5_2ssha,False,,,True,t3_14j6ku,http://www.reddit.com/r/razer/comments/14j6ku/macroing_nextprevious_with_itunes_shortcuts_on/,

I had them plugged into my motherboard directly as the plugs existed however I got no control over each individual speaker. Part of this caused some things to have absolutely no bass. Upon further inspection it was only outputting through the front 2 drivers. I went to micro center and bought a basic 7.1 PCI Diamond sound card hoping the drivers for it would allow for full control and it did seem to work at first. I would bring up a bass test on youtube and it would work amazingly, then I would try a bass song on spotify and nothing. It seems to work on a per program, song, video, game, basis. I tried going to 2.0 setting in some things but that doesn't help for the bass half the time and sounds off in other cases.

Problem is that at 2.5 grand a unit...I don't know. I move around a lot so getting a high-end laptop is a definite but I'm worried that around this time next year Razer or some other company is going to come out with a laptop that has hardware superseding this one by a fair margin, etc etc etc.

What are your thoughts? Those with the first generation version: are you upset about this? Any thoughts?

Those that have the Nvidia 660 GTX on a similar system: How is the performance of this GPU compared to other mobile graphics cards?

For the record, I'm upgrading from a 1yr old Alienware with specs that are about the same as the first generation Blade and I'm really hoping for somewhat a decent performance boost in games like Guild Wars 2, Battlefield 3, etc. I'm *hoping* because this thing is so pretty and I can pre-order it now if I want to.

At the end of the day however, it's good for the consumer to have more choices. And I suppose in a year or two companies out there would have purchased the 14"" Blade tearing them down and replicating the 14"" Blade too. It's a lot easier to do something that has been done before - often, it's just copying what's already done - the harder part is creating it.

However I got a few questions, I had a G930 before this and everything could be configured easily and I could switch between stero and surround and sound was fine, also it had drivers downloaded if I remember correctly.
Now the Tiamat doesn't have any drivers I can find? It uses REALTEK HD AUDIO configuration and I don't get it.
Whenever I play Dayz, it sound really awkward compared to my G930, ofcourse this quality is different but it sounds muffled or something.
Its on surround sound.
I can't really find the headset in audio devices, it only gives me 3 options, see picture.

Also when I play league of legends I want to play that in stereo, its no surround sound game it makes it hella annoying.
But for some reason it sounds like it surround but yet it isn't, I have to stand EXACTLY on my character otherwise I can't hear him cast spells or auto attacks.
I'll put pictures of my config, anyone encountered these problems with configuration? Or am I just being a complete numnut and not looking properly.

3 options, the config is in dutch but i'll try and translate best I can.

* **Picture 2:** http://imgur.com/sgHjAXu One of the 4 configuration screens on REALTEK HD Audio configuration 

* **Picture 3:** http://imgur.com/trpvCsS 3rd config screen 1st tab, the 2nd picture is basicly the 2nd tab they are the same, just a different device or sound type? (Geen = none, omgeving = surroundings, standaard apparaat instellen = put as basic device, I tried this but I just can't figure out any differences)

* **Picture 4:** http://imgur.com/TVx1Tex I think this is the main configuration screen, all the tabs from left to right: Config of speakers/Soundeffects/Roomcorrection?/standard format, thought I'd show the tabs that I can pick from, they are all the same in settings.


Sorry for the wall of text but I hope you can help me out.
Youtube and what not is perfectly fine, normal volume and surround and stereo work just fine, however my Tiamat Volume thing is only on 3 bars not very high where I saw my friend have it half way to have decent sound.

    [HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\RAZER\0.01\{EAF2D065-37FC-4469-A5FE-0E40E6F378D7}\Profiles\{8667EC92-E941-40A5-B183-036E12686971}\KEYS]

You may already have some macro keys assigned here, but if you wish to use media keys, you will have to put these two lines at the top of the list:

    ""0000003a""=hex:01,00,00,00,3a,00,00,00,01,00,00,00,00,00,00,00,00,00,00,00,00,\
      00,00,00,00,00,00,00,00,00,00,00

Those define the macro keys using this macro (01) as virtual keycodes, ie special keys like play/pause, home, page up/down, etc. At least that's what I think is happening...  
Next come the actual macro key definitions:

    ""00000064""=hex:01,00,00,00,64,00,00,00,05,00,00,00,a2,00,00,00,00,01,00,00,00,\
      00,00,00,00,00,00,00,00,00,00,00
    ""00000065""=hex:01,00,00,00,65,00,00,00,05,00,00,00,99,00,00,00,00,01,00,00,00,\
      00,00,00,00,00,00,00,00,00,00,00
    ""00000066""=hex:01,00,00,00,66,00,00,00,05,00,00,00,90,00,00,00,00,01,00,00,00,\
      00,00,00,00,00,00,00,00,00,00,00
    ""00000067""=hex:01,00,00,00,67,00,00,00,05,00,00,00,b0,00,00,00,00,01,00,00,00,\
      00,00,00,00,00,00,00,00,00,00,00
    ""00000068""=hex:01,00,00,00,68,00,00,00,05,00,00,00,ae,00,00,00,00,01,00,00,00,\
      00,00,00,00,00,00,00,00,00,00,00

If we take a closer look at the first line, we will notice 3 things:  

    ""00000064""=hex:01,00,00,00,64,00,00,00,05,00,00,00,a2,00,00,00,00,01,00,00,00
            ^1                  ^1                     ^^2             ^3

1. Defines which macro key is defined here. m1=64, m2=65, m3=66, m4=67, m5=68
2. The actual code for the key that should be bound to the macro key
3. The 01 telling it, to use the macro defined in the first two lines

So for using special keys on the macro keys, we would only need to change ""2"".  
After long searching, I found them all:  
Play/Pause: a2  
Next Track: 99  
Previous Track: 90  
Stop: a4  
Volume Up: b0  
Volume Down: ae  
Volume Mute: a0  
   
How to actually put that to use:  

1. Export a profile with at least one macro assigned  
2. Open it in Notepad or similar  
3. Add these lines to the beginning of the last section if it isn't already there:  
`""0000003a""=hex:01,00,00,00,3a,00,00,00,01,00,00,00,00,00,00,00,00,00,00,00,00,\`
` 00,00,00,00,00,00,00,00,00,00,00`
3. Add these lines after that (replace the lines if you already assigned something to the macro key): 
`""000000YY""=hex:01,00,00,00,YY,00,00,00,05,00,00,00,XX,00,00,00,00,01,00,00,00,\`  
` 00,00,00,00,00,00,00,00,00,00,00`  
4. Change the `XX` to the code you wish to use and the `YY` to the macro key you wish to assign it to (m1=64, m2=65, m3=66, m4=67, m5=68)  
5. Save and import  
6. Voilá!  

Alternatively, you can also try using my exported profile or these exported macros!

The Razer is claimed as the ""First True Gaming Tablet""

With its dedicated Graphics card and ability to run Windows 8 Pro this has the ability to download and run any game accessible to a current windows PC, while still having the form factor of a tablet, light portable but still blazing fast.

Now that we have seen what it can do lets look at the specs.

The Razer Edge comes in two forms 

[The Razer Edge](http://www.razerzone.com/gaming-systems/razer-edge)($999.99)

And now that we have seen that lets look at why Razer calls this the First True Gaming Tablet

The Razer Edge has attachments customized specifically for the Razer Edge It has Three Seperate Attachments

Home Console-

This is used to attach your Razer Edge to your T.V and play through that it sports enough usb's to connect up to 4 people and play together through the T.V screen like a normal console

Controller Mode

This mode add a more handheld feel to the razer edge by adding two Controllers(one on each side) and lets you control games through the controller this will be beneficial to play FPS/RPG's/any indie game with a controller port.

Keyboard mode

This lets you attach a keyboard to the Edge and lets you make a mini-laptop with your device and use it on the go if needed to type reports or type notes anything you could need! However if your a big MMO this will be the style that you will use as you can attach a mouse to the device and have full control like you would with your desktop.


****These are sold apart from the actual device and will have to pay a price for each individual attachment*****

My Review

I think The Razer Edge is a great tool that can be used for anything that you would need a tablet for and have it be on the go. The specs Are pretty impressive considering what the device is. I feel like the attachments are what really make this product have full potential in the ""Worlds First True Gaming Tablet"" I really love the design that Razer went with the product it adds a range for what everyone could use and makes it so any gamer could use this device(wish it had 4g/3g connection and a better battery life (2h when running a game), but nonetheless I cant wait to pick up my edition for this and thank you for coming to This Lets Discuss of The Razer Edge

So Reddit What do you think?

Supposedly this problem is attributed to the return click's spring loosing its stiffness, and then bouncing, resulting in multiple clicks.

Does anyone have any ideas how to fix this? I googled it and the most popular answer seemed to be opening the mouse and applying Contact Cleaner, but supposedly that was only a temporary solution, and the problem would eventually resurface. 

I'm sad to say I got this mouse through an RMA, after my first Naga stopped responding entirely, so I can't do that again.

I've waited 2 days for a response but nothing yet so I'm hoping either someone here can help me or a Razer employee sees this because I'm getting pretty tired of only getting 2 to 3 hours out of the headset before it dies. (Square brackets are things I've added in this post only after reviewing my initial message.

I called a while back (in late December) about my Razer Chimera
5.1 headset, the Mass Effect 3 edition if that matters, about how the base station wouldn't recharge the battery properly. It would charge for about an hour then say it was done causing it to only last about an hour if I was lucky. 

The support person I got at the time suggested I try different batteries, which I didn't want to do really as I shouldn't have to so I returned it to the store and got a new headset and stand on the premise that the previous one was defective. When I got the new one home and went to use it, it did the exact same thing. 

This time I did go out and buy new batteries and a separate charger. I bought Energizer 900mah Ni-Mh rechargeable batteries and a charger. I tried the Energizer batteries with the charging stand and it did the same thing [I forgot to mention that the same thing happened with the new pack-in batteries]. It charged for an hour, then cut out. So then I tried the wall charger I bought, it charged both sets of batteries for 7 hours and I put them in the headset and this time it lasted for 4 hours. [I take this as there is obviously an issue, either in their advertising of the product or in the product itself]

I'm wondering what we can do about this. You say they should have an 8 hour life span and that the stand/charger should charge the batteries in 3 hours to accommodate that. Instead I have to wait 7 hours [on a separately purchased charger] to get (on average) 3 to 3.5 hours out of them. That is not satisfactory. Now I'm completely happy with my Razer Mamba and Blackwidow Ultimate, but this is really a huge mark against you guys. I know I'm still under warranty as the new set was purchased around December 26th or 27th (I'm asking my parents to send me the receipt as it was a gift from them) [confirmed the 27th], and I'd like to know what can and will be done to correct this issue.

Thanks for your time,

Steven

Am I doing something wrong/missing something or did I just get 2 defective headsets in a row?

But I was wondering if there is a way to fix it. I've tried unplugging it and plugging it back in and that doesn't help. I've uninstalled Razer Synapse 2.0 and still barely works. Then I go to razer's website and see if there is a firmware update for it. So I go to the website and when i press download it goes to a 404 page... I tried downloading it from another site but my computer detected it as a virus so I deleted it.

Again if anyone can help me with this problem that will make me fell so much better.

So, it seems as though Synapse is just a data mining tool for Razer to collect everything about me that they can and share that information with others.  This is unacceptable and I refuse to buy any Razer products that require me to use Synapse.

Tl;dr

**I picked up a Naga Epic last week and have enjoyed testing its functions. I became aware that the mouse has issues with remaining responsive. I don't know why, and would love to hear stories or feedback, and any suggestions the community here has to offer.**

After reading into what this mouse is capable of, and hearing some of the good/bad stories from across the internet, I decided to shell out the CA$140 on this mouse. Instead of ordering it online, I decided to try and get it from BestBuy so that I could easily return the model if there were problems with it from the get-go. BestBuy usually has 2-year coverage on sales, but there was nothing available for this product.

So I checked the return policy (14 days), bought it, and went to try it out during my overnight shift. I had to let it charge for almost six hours, and during that time I installed Synapse, which downloaded soem Naga Epic software updates, and I also installed Game Booster (the new open beta version).

There were no problems with the mouse on the laptop I tested it with (MacBook Pro, running Windows 7 Ultimate SP1 x64), which had no additional USB IO device drivers installed.

After some customization of the mouse's badass lights (MALIWAN would be proud), I ran it with Guild Wars 2 (without using Game Booster, to avoid any possible conflicts). It was awesome. Smooth, responsive and great to try out.

Fast forward a few days, and we're up to this past weekend. I was enjoying my day off in front of my MacPro (again, Windows 7 Ultimate SP1 x64, no additional USB input device drivers), I spent a few hours playing Guild Wars, surfin' the net, and digging holes in Minecraft (don't judge) and during some PvE on GW2 my mouse began to act up:

* The first disconnection was short, the mouse stopped responding so I did what anyone would naturally do, and lifted the mouse to look under it. I brushed my thumb across the sensor and then gently placed the mouse back onto my desk. It responded so I thought no more of it.

* The second time, the mouse locked up while in-game and I couldn't get it to reconnect. The pointer was stuck and none of the buttons on the mouse responded. Battery level right after this incident: 91%

* Third time, I was no longer in-game and the mouse froze crossing over between an active Chrome window and my Desktop. The screens flickered as if something had launched or crashed, and the Desktop took focus way from the Chrome window (even though I did not click the mouse. Again, it would not respond, and no buttons would work. Battery: 91%

During all of this the Razer Synapse 2 software was running, and my Profile remained active. The mouse was also powered, as the lights were never flickering or off, and the device was still emitting the faint humming sound. I eventually found what is hopefully not the fix, by plugging the mouse into the cable. Placing it into the dock, cycling device power and attempting to re-pair did not fix the issue. Restarting also works but is a time-consuming process, as Synapse slows the boot cycle by several minutes.

*This quote, direct from a newegg.ca customer indicates a similar experience:*
&gt; it keeps disconnecting in the middle of gameplay, and not becuase it's low on charge. i can't help but the blame the software since it keeps on freezing with my windows 7 64 bit computer that has i7 and 6gb ram.

**I'm not sure what to do now.** I have about a week before BestBuy will not accept my product return, so during the Thanksgiving break I will be returning this product for either the Razer Naga (Wired) or another model of the same product, which hopefully will not have this issue. I will return the Naga Epic for a wired one but I'd prefer not to. My primary aim when purchasing the Epic was to enjoy the freedom of a powerful wireless mouse.

* Could the Synapse software be freezing the mouse?
* Are there any documented solutions to this issue?
* Have you experienced anything similar and solved it?

**Any suggestions or solutions and feedback are most welcome at this point.** Additionally, I'll be contacting Razer directly as part of my troubleshooting. I'm not satisfied with the current performance of this expensive product, and if you're having similar experiences, you can't be happy either...

**Thanks for reading!**

I've been having some issues with the driver as of late:

1. Sometimes after exiting an application, the driver stops responding and I get the rainbow wheel over the razer icon on my top ""status"" bar (where it shows time/battery/etc.)

2. Another problem is that it will sometimes open, but access the mouse settings. It will just have the green spinning wheel. It does show that the Razer 3.5g is connected, but it just won't open the settings.

I solve both these problems by restarting my comp, but it doesn't save my settings so I have to reset the sensitivity and everything. It forgets the settings even when I'm logged into my account through the synapse.

1345754444.0,3,self.razer,yprcf,Found a fix to Windows startup lag with Razer Synapse,4,1,0,http://www.reddit.com/r/razer/comments/yprcf/found_a_fix_to_windows_startup_lag_with_razer/,"I have found a fix to the lag or intermittent freezing of the cursor during windows startup. The freezing usually lasts about a minute or two. Make sure to read the entire post first before starting. All the steps need to be done exactly as stated. The notes at the end are critical. Side note, I own a Razer Taipan.

The fix was found in the [description](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=12jrO5P2Cxw) of a youtube video. The fix is as follows

Please try the following:

* Note: A second mouse is needed*
* Disconnect
* Uninstall Synapse 2.0
* Reboot
* Uninstall .Net Framework 4
* Reboot
* Run Microsoft Updates and apply all available updates for your operating system, rebooting when prompted (This may take some time)
* Install .Net Framework 4 -Standalone from the following links
(http://www.microsoft.com/download/en/details.aspx?id=17718)
* Reboot
* Right click on the Synapse 2.0 installer and choose ""Run as Administrator""
* Reconnect

**Important notes**

* Make sure you uninstall all of framework 4. Which would be Microsoft Framework 4 extended and Microsoft Framework 4 client profile. It could be different for you I'm a developer and have Visual Studio installed so my versions may be slightly different. Just make sure to uninstall everything with "".Net framework 4"" in the name.
* When installing Windows updates do not install any of the .Net framework updates. They will be installed by the standalone installer in the next step.
* When installing synapse do not plug in the mouse yet. Do a full install and restart as asked. After you reset, double click on synapse. It should be asking you to connect a razer mouse. Disconnect the non-razer mouse and connect the razer mouse now. A UAC prompt will pop up and you will be unable to move the mouse. Press Alt+Y to select yes. If the window isn't selected use alt+Tab to select it. After Synapse installs everything it will ask you to reset.
* Make sure your firewall and antivirus is totally disabled during this entire procedure. After everything is done enable everything and add synapse to the trusted list for your firewall. 


I have done this fix myself and after several shut downs and restarts I have yet to re-encounter any lag problems. Feel free to ask questions.

So as the title of this post says I can't make up my mind concerning the new Razer laptops. 

Before I get into this, I just want to note that I'm entering college in the fall so I'm going to need a portable computer. As most Razer product users are, I'm also an avid gamer. I have a desktop that runs games flawlessly on ultra, so I was looking for a laptop that could complement that while I'm gone, and I found the Razer Blade and the Pro.

Price is not really an issue since I know I'm making an investment that will be worth 3-4 years. 

The major issue that I'm facing is the screen size and quality. 

The Pro weighs in at about 6.5 pounds (not so awesome) and sports a 17 inch screen with 1920x1080 resolution - very awesome. Will a 17 inch laptop be too large?

 To me this SHOULD be where the regular Blade comes in -- 14 inches 4.5 pounds, but the resolution isn't all that great (1650x900) and I haven't heard great things about the screen quality. However I'll be carrying it around a lot so the relatively minimal weight is a big plus for me.

I've had a Macbook Pro (13 inch) since June 2008, so either way it would be a pretty big laptop upgrade for me. I most likely will not be bringing in my gaming pc to school, since it's so damn big. 

Now, what others have suggested I do is that I should get the 14 inch Blade and bring my big monitor (I have a 27 inch display) to my dorm, so that when I'm in my room and want to game or something I can just plug it in via HDMI. (By the way, will that let me keep the 1080p resolution or will it just revert to 1650x900 ? I apologize for the noob question).

Blade Pro owners- just how portable is it? Does it feel clunky/ heavy?

Regular Blade owners- do you wish you had more screen space and higher res?

thanks, guys! Much appreciated.",,False,self,t5_2ssha,False,,,True,t3_1jlj13,http://www.reddit.com/r/razer/comments/1jlj13/i_cant_make_up_my_mind_with_the_razer_bladeshelp/,

Reached out to Razer Support US only to be rebuffed that my controller was not original (Bought it on Ebay from a store who are the leading importer of Razer Products in India – Tirupati Enterprises, with a proper invoice and serial no.) and thus not eligible for an RMA.


It seems that Clause No. 4 for Razer warranty claims states that “Razer currently has no authorized resellers on Ebay or any other online auction sites.” Well in India, they do !

Razer India has been much more gracious. They said that the Onza was out of it’s product lifecycle and has been replaced by the Sabertooth and offered me two choices : Get a credit note from the store or wait till the month’s end and go for a Razer Sabertooth and pay the difference in price (Rs. 5700 tentatively, with a 10-15% discount). While this is appreciated this does not work for me on two counts.

1.  The credit note can only be used against the store I purchased it and they have no other controllers (from any other manufacturers) in stock.
2.  The difference in cost of the Razer Onza TE and the Sabertooth is more than the price of the Onza itself, meaning I will have to pay more than double the initial investment. Just to give you an idea of the cost of the Sabertooth, I can buy nearly 4 wired Microsoft XBOX controllers at that price. It’s really going to be difficult to explain to my wife and kid, why I, a casual gamer, would need to spend that much on a controller whose price nearly equals to around the price of a Playstation Portable.
I think the Sabertooth is a wonderful product and I would love to own it, but the terms of the exchange leave a lot to be desired on my part.

As I said, I am a casual gamer and I would love to just be happy to just have a controller as a replacement without having to pay anything extra than my initial investment.

I feel Razer gets us gamers (not everyone does, sadly) and I felt dejected and sad after dealing with support for more than a week I am not sure I would invest in Razer anymore ?",,False,self,t5_2ssha,1370969290.0,,,True,t3_1g4pii,http://www.reddit.com/r/razer/comments/1g4pii/razer_support_is_my_experience_the_general_norm/,

I would like to see: 

* the 14"" still without compromise with it's power.
* a much wider viewing angle (if you look at the CNet First Look by Scott Stein, the screen gives you a narrow viewing angle and the colours wash out at unlikely angles)
* more battery life at less intensive use (Internet, Word Processing, etc.) 6 hours is good enough
* the same size power adapter

**Razer Blade Pro**

I would like to see:

* an upgradeable RAM
* the Pro version to be much more powerful than the 14"" *[EDITED]*
* second hard drive space (if possible for the form factor)


**Another Razer Blade in the lineup**

Now this Razer Blade is what I had in mind with all the new systems Razer has put on the market.
This Blade would rather be a 'traditional' gaming laptop and is a lower-end config than the Blade Pro. This would make the Blade Pro a much more premium item than this Blade.
I'm pretty sure everyone would love a budget-friendly system from Razer.

I would like to see:

* a choice of Haswell i5/Ivy Bridge i5 or i7
* upgradeable RAM
* removable backplate
* removable battery
* a 15 - 17 inch screen.
* a stockier form factor (possibly even heavier). I could go with 8 - 10 pounds and no more than 1.5 inches thick.
* a slot-load Optical Drive (sure nobody needs OD's in the US nowadays but to countries like us, New Zealand, buying a hardcopy of the game is much cheaper and more reasonable than buying stuff off Steam) *[EDITED]* or a second hard drive on the space for the slot-load OD
* a choice on whether I want the Switchblade UI or the traditional laptop keyboard layout.
* HDMI and/or VGA


**I also wan't to see the Blade Pro to be much more powerful than the Blade. People from other forums, and myself, really can't find the reason to pay more on the Blade Pro when it is the same spec as the less expensive (in Blade standards) Razer Blade**

*tell me if what I had in mind were actually useful or just plain stupid*
*Please, flame responsibly*
*Please add your own suggestions as you see fit*
*I am sorry for the bad English, i'm pretty sure some GNs out there are having a headache, I am not an English native speaker so please bear*

Dear Gary,  
  
Yes I am aware that it cannot be configured using synapse. I was merely suggesting that you work to offer synapse support. What would be really incredible, and would drive sales, is making it so you can map it to mouse and keyboard functions. By doing this you would allow people to use the gamepad with games that don't offer gamepad support. (World of Warcraft, Mass Effect, older games, etc.) Most people who want to use a gamepad for these games are going to pay for a normal controller then third party software. If you advertised that the sabertooth, not only is of superior design and functionality, but lets you use that functionality in new places that a regular controller can't. All I can get out of my sabertooth right now is the same old controller with a more convenient button arrangement. You gave me a controller with 6 extra buttons, I want to be able to use those 6 extra buttons instead of having a controller that has multiple buttons that do the same thing.

A Surface Pro with the following specs goes for $999:

* i5 Processor
* 128GB SSD
* 4GB RAM

* 10.6"" Display
* 1080p

Honestly, I don't think it's fair to compare these two devices. Both of these devices were created with completely different intentions in mind (Surface for productivity and Razer for gaming). I actually own a Surface Pro myself and it's an amazing device. But when I look at the specs of the Razer Edge Pro, I just get blown away. All the reviews that I've seen are positive, the only negatives being battery life and screen resolution. In my mind these are reasonable knocks though. You can't expect a tablet device to run a dedicated graphics card AND have enormously long battery life. That's just a ridiculous expectations with the technology that we have today. The screen resolution doesn't bother me considering that it will run all games smoothly (expecting excellent performance on 1080p on a tablet device is, once again, a ridiculous expectation). 

I just don't understand why people are having issues understanding the capabilities of this device. It's literally a gaming laptop put into tablet hardware. The price of the device itself is NOT outrageous.

Lets try to keep accessories out of this discussion. The accessories for this device, in my opinion, are priced a little steep.

I learned this by mistake, then realized that there is a ton of videos on youtube. So let’s dive right in. A symbolic link is a path... in simple terms. It is a way to tell windows to lunch apps for a different location IE flash drive or external, but acts like the file is on the Edges drive. With this you don’t have to worry about filling up your Edge with your steam games. You can follow the youtube video if you like.


First thing your going to do is open CMD in admin. You can find this by going to Run and typing CMD. Next you want to use the command /D as explained in the video, then type the location of the file and then type where the file actually is, IE your flash drive or HDD. Mine is: E as seen in My Computer. If don’t do it the right way the symbolic link &lt;====&gt; won't show up. It might be easier like the video says to pull up your program files. I know this is not in great detail but for the most part, the video explains it better then i can..



Youtube link :http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DpqzqVqR3K4
A WARNING... This is NOT my video and he uses /J... you need to use /D as your command. Also make sure you run CMD in ADMIN, one more thing you need you use ""Game File Name Here"" without the quotation marks, it won’t work.



I was able to make muti Symbolic Links on my 126GB Flash drive, so if you have any questions please feel free to ask. Also I would start with a small game like FTL, cause if you fail to copy it or the link fails, you can always redownload the game quickly.


Once again with this technique you will be able to hold more steam games on your Edge, weather it’s a 64GB or a 126GB or a 256GB. I did this with a flash drive but the same thing can be done with a HDD. A flash drive is more mobile but if you don’t have 120$ to drop on the 126GB Flash then you might want to look at a external hard drive or 64GB Flash Drive. Also if you do have the cash I think New Egg sells a 256GB Flash drive at 250$

Let me begin: I love Razer and their products. I recommend them to every one of my friends. The products I personally have is the Razer Blackwidow Ultimate 2013 keyboard and the Razer TRON mouse+pad (soon to be replaced by a Naga Hex). 

The keyboard is 2 months old, the mouse going on over a year.

So far, I have had issues with both of these products. The mouse has been RMA'd before and (is still under limited) probably will be sent in again for the same issue (double clicks for every single click...Now mind you, I game a LOT, so the connectors are probably just worn down), and my keyboard is having to get RMA'd due to a backlighting issue.

Even with these issues, I still will go with Razer and their products. I have had really fast support whenever I have had to get things fixed, and everything has gone over well. Because of this, and the build quality of their products, I'll stick to Razer.

What is everyone else's experience with their products? Have you had issues, but good support? Has your experience been a great one? Or does it seem like everything been bad?

Buy an extended warranty / no questions ask exchange policy when your purchase an item. (This would be a lot like Apple Care.. except more awesome Razer Care)

So if I buy a Razer Deathadder with this extended warranty, and the right click starts to go. I can send it in within 3 years of purchase date and Razer covers shipping both ways. If it is determined as a product defect, it doesn't go towards your 1 no questions asked exchange.

I was looking at the naga because its made for MMOs but i prefer a wireless mouse. I prefer quality though over something as easily fixed as a wire on a mouse due to the fact the sell wire holders and stuff like that. Also i need advice on a keyboard. Im thinking the deathstalker because of the touch pad on it for selecting spells and stuff like that but im not sure how good that is so it would be nice if someone could tell me about that. The other keyboard i was looking at was the orbweaver because it looks interesting and possibly helpful, but i'm not the richest person in the world so whatever keyboard i use i want to use for all my gaming.

Second off, and very unimportant: The microphone does not play back into the headset. Before this pair, I owned Turtle Beach X12's, and whenever I spoke into the microphone, I heard it in the headset. Windows does have an option for this, however it is delayed.

Is there a better Razer Headset that will last?,3,1,14,http://www.reddit.com/r/razer/comments/1jx3ue/second_razer_carcharias_to_have_mic_break_down_in/,"Bought my Carcharias in March of last year. I was happy with it, even if it did seem a little flimsy. Just have to be careful with it. And having had a Death Adder before I was pretty confident that it would be sturdy and last me a while. My last Death Adder lasted years of use and abuse and I adore it, so I was confident this headset would be okay.

Not even a year in, in December, the mic stops working. No trauma or anything just shuts down. Contacted Razer and had to drive in to Best Buy (45 minute drive for me, live out in a small town) to get it replaced. After that everything was peachy, until today where the exact same issue comes up and the mic stops working. I've contacted Razer support, but I'm pretty unhappy that I've had to replace this headset twice now.

I also have a vague memory of having to replace it for having one of the earphones stop working, though I don't have any paperwork to back that up. I might have dreamed it. If it did happen it was very soon after I got it, to where it was a simple replacement and I don't have the return receipt, just the original and the December replacement.

I've contacted Razer support, but I'm concerned since the original purchase was over a year ago, but it's been less than a year since the replacement. I'm normally very happy with Razer and their support is nothing if not exceptional. However, having to replace a headset on a yearly basis leaves me sort of jaded.

I am also starting another semester of schooling at the end of august and need a portable laptop that is also powerful enough to run hardcore games. The Razer Blade 14"" is perfect for my case, and money isn't a problem. I am going to be in Dubai for a week or so and have found a bunch of articles listing the stores that exclusively have Razer products although when I contacted said stores they said that they didn't have the Blade.

1) Is the blade available in countries outside of the US/Canada (not shipping, just resellers)

2) What has been your experience using it day to day?

3) If it isn't available outside the US/Canada, does anyone know when it will be?

4) If it is available outside the US/Canada, where? I am also able to purchase it from England.

So, if any of you more experienced customers can answer these for me; that would be awesome.

-First off; how's the longevity for Razer products? I'm going to probably use this laptop for a few years; and I expect something so expensive to endure for a while. The question is; does it? Will this sleek machine wear down within a year of purchase?

-What happens if the Laptop Breaks in some way or gets stolen? Who do I contact? I've heard some pretty bad things about Razer's customer support; too many bad things in my opinion for a company who's items are so incredibly expensive. What exactly do the warranties cover? Is customer support helpful? How long does it usually take to repair or replace a faulty or broken Razer product?

-Finally, tell me honestly, are Razer products worth the price? Does the quality of the item make up for the massive cost?

I've tried a few different brands and currently have a Chimaera 5.1, but will likely switch when I get my Xbox One. I tried the Razer Surround demo and was impressed, but as a Mac user I can't use the whole thing, and I don't do much computer gaming anymore so it doesn't really matter.

But this program does seem like it could be used, along with the high-speed data port on the Xbox One controller, to turn any pair of headphones into an Xbox One headset. My idea would be Razer makes a puck-like adaptor to plug into the controller and put a headphone jack on it, along with controls for game volume, chat volume, and mute. It also comes with a USB cable to plug the adaptor into a computer. You use Surround on your computer to set up your personal headphones, and these settings are then synced to the adaptor.

I already know the controller was designed to run game audio through that port, since the Turtle Beach XO headsets are going to work by just plugging into the controller. Mic's aren't necessary on these headsets anymore since the Kinect will function as the microphone out of the box, but being able to mute from the controller would be helpful. This system seems to make sense to me, obviously since I came up with it on the toilet.

*TL:DR* - make an adaptor you set up on a computer to use Surround and turn any headphones into an Xbox One surround headset using the controller's high-speed data port.

Out of all the peripherals at your computer i think the one that people are the most picky about are their mice. i just so happens that mice also come in all different configurations.

the first thing i'd like to discus is the different types of grips. the three types are fingertip grip, claw grip, and palm grip. 
[http://bluetoothmousedeals.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/Bluetooth-mouse-deals-palmclaw-and-fingertip-grip.png]

* Palm grip is the most common grip and is easier to control then the other grips. Since the user’s hand almost entirely rests on the mouse, many users attest this to be the most comfortable way to hold a mouse.

* Claw grip is used for people who want a bit more speed than the palm grip and a nice medium between the palm and fingertip grip.

* In the fingertip grip the user is only holding the mice by their fingers. this gives you more precision and agility compared to the other grips. Unlike the other grips this grip cannot be used on all mice. Fingertip grip requires a low profile mice. This type of grip is the most fatiguing grip. 

Now another thing i would like to talk about that isn't mentioned as much as the grip styles is the mousepad, or more specifically speed vs. control. the two ""types"" of mousepad razer offers are speed and control. Speed is very smooth and control adds a small amount of resistance and tactile feedback.

For me, i use the Razer Deathadder with a claw grip and the Razer Vespula on the speed side. i mostly play MOBAs and FPS games such as League of Legends and Battlefield and i think this setup fits me perfectly.

Essentially it keeps changing my sound for me. I understand that they are more than your run of the mill earphones, but in all honesty I would prefer if it just played the sounds normal earphones would.

Let me explain myself better and use some examples. When I play League of Legends, the music in champion select is veeeery strange. The drums are extremely loud and the rest of the song is nearly inaudible. This is an example of it kind of 'altering' the sounds more than I would like. Similarly, when I'm in a game, the sound does not work properly. I am in complete silence however I hear 'pings' and the announcer, as well as certain spell sounds (however these are all vague). This is obviously quite annoying. The last issue I'm having is that it seems to be quieting my backround programs, which might be nice in theory, however is incredibly annoying when trying to play iTunes during a game.

Essentially, is there a way to just make the headset play what normal earphones would play, without interfering with it too much (I understand you can adjust bass etc but that doesn't help me much).

The keyboard doesn't matter too much to me, so recommend me the best bang for my buck Razer keyboard.

I've been using deathadder for some time now. However about a year ago my old deathadder's mouse 4 button broke. I though it was just of old age &amp; replaced it with a new deathadder in march last year.

Now 3 weeks ago, the same issue happened. The mouse4 button broke again. It gets pushed in to far &amp; becomes impossible to properly use. Fortunatly for me, this one is still in warranty.


Regardless, it's still kinda alarming if this is going to keep on happening. I play CSGO &amp; DotA2/HoN and in CSGO I don't even have it bound, in HoN/DotA2 it's my cancel animation button. So I'd doubt it's from overusing it.

Anyone else having similar issues? I love the deathadder, it's by far the best mouse I've used in all my years of gaming, but if this keeps up, I'm not sure if I should stick around with them, since it'll get quite costly if I have to replace them every couple of years because a button of ""minor"" importance just breaks.",,False,self,t5_2ssha,False,,,True,t3_1dsegx,http://www.reddit.com/r/razer/comments/1dsegx/deathadder_mouse_4_breaking_every_time/,

I primarily play GW2 and I use the D-pad of the Nostromo to move my character around, N,NE,E,SE,S,SW,W,NW. After the update I am unable to move my character NE,SE,SW and NW.

 I can move N E S W with no issue, but when I move the D-pad so I'd run NE or SW my character doesn't move at all, he just stops as if I took my thumb off the D-Pad. 

Anyone else having this issue? Or does anyone happen to know what I can do within the synapse 2.0 to resolve this? With the new synapse I'm unable to set what to use my D-pad for. 

EDIT: I solved the problem finally.

It looks like there was some kind of setting form the old configurator that was causing the issue. I created a new keymap profile using all the buttons, and since we cant mess with the d-pad on synpase 2.0 I left it the way Razer had it set up for us.

When I used the new keymap I have zero issues.

It was before they were releasing the products with the green LED lights. I love my Blackwidow to bits, but one day the keys stopped working (A,S,D,Q,W,E,~,Tab,Caps,Shift,Ctrl,Windows Key,Alt,). I decided to return the keyboard and get a new one. I really dislike the green that Razer uses now and looked everywhere for a blue version of the Blackwidow. They went for prices between $200-300 CDN which I wouldn't pay for. I managed to find one on the Best Buy site which I assumed had a blue backlight since there were two different Blackwidows on the website. I decided to order it and when it came in the mail I saw the blue keyboard on the package. I was really happy on the way home from the post office until I noticed that there was a sticker or two that said it was for Mac and the Mac keys on the back. I have the keyboard home at the moment sitting in it's box in the corner of dissapointment in my room. It partially works for the PC bit some of the keys don't work and are confusing to figure out. I can deal with the ""reskinned"" keys but I don't like that I can't use keys like Alt and alot of the F1-19 keys. (and yes there is F19 on this keyboard) If any of you know how I could convert my Mac keyboard into a properly working PC one that would greatly be appreciated. If you can suggest a keyboard that has blue backlighting and mechanical keys that is in the price region of $100-150 CDN that would be very appreciated too

TL;DR Person with mass OCD can't deal with a green backlight like the pussy he is, has a blue backlit keyboard for mac and would like to make this keyboard fully compatible with PC.

I bought a Razer Kraken, I like the headset, it sounds good, both sides of the headset work when I plug it into my phone to listen to music.
This is the problem, when I plug it into the 3.5mm port on the side of my computer, the left speaker will either not play, or play very low, the other side will play fine. I have determined that it has to be a problem with the laptop. I have all the sound drivers updated and all the system updates done. The only way that I have found to get the headset to work perfectly while plugged into my laptop is to unplug and re-plug the headset over and over and over and over and over and over and over until it magically works on both sides. I contacted Razer support and they said it wasn't their problem and to contact Lenovo. I have been on the Lenovo forums and it seems there is no answer to my predicament.
It's just very annoying that I spend a little over 70 dollars on a headset and it doesn't work well on my laptop, and the headset manufacturer says that's my problem (which it is)
So, yea, I tried to fix it, and I have no idea what to do. I don't want to be ~70 dollars in the drain, but this problem is very stressful and not worth the pain of having to come home to a equipment problem every single damn day.
pls help, I'm sure it has something to do with the audio input on the laptop, but have no idea how to proceed.
And yea, I've been plugging it in and out for about 40 minutes now and it's not fixing itself, DAMN IT. Plug it into my phone and the headset works perfect! I'm about to ragequit.
Like, how the hell was I supposed to know that I would have these issues prior to buying the headset?

My first thought was a gaming laptop...for $3-4K I can get a 680m 512ssd i7 32gb ram my fear there really is heat...that's a lot of power to be confined in a chassis with limited cooling...kind of my same fear with the edge pro.

Then there's the windows 8 tablet market...right now the Surface Pro, Samsung 700t, and Razer Edge Pro are the only viable gaming options...there lies a massive problem for gaming...

Both the surface and samsung are 1080p...however both lack any means to plug in ethernet even none on the keyboard dock which is frustrating because that would solve my problems.

The Razer Edge Pro is the most frustrating one...it claims to be The Gaming Tablet but is riddled with problems...720p...on a dedicated graphics card is a joke...why even bother putting a tablet together if your going to skimp out on it esp when your going to charge a premium...the second part is the battery is laughable...even in non gaming mode 4 hours...sigh.

Then there's the fact for PC gamers that the keyboard dock isn't even launching for 6 months after the tablet releases...let alone any identification on if the tablet or keyboard dock will include an ethernet port..

Id love to find a Gaming tablet but it doesn't seem a true one exists...and I'm not going to be the sucker who forks out $1500 then 6 months later when they release the dock they bundle it with a 1080p Pro+ model and everyone who bought the original gets screwed.

I also want to see a true stress test on the Razer Edge Pro...give Avoidlol from from twitch tv one and let him do a 24 hour Diablo 3 farm session on it...I want to see under that kind of stress how the tablet holds up...if you don't understand what I mean just go to twitch.tv and search for avoidlol....he plays a wizard who casts non~stop spells that would lag even powerful machines today and he does it for hours on end...it'd truly test the device.

My point is I want a gaming tablet that can be gamed on all day long without issues...I want it to be 1080p with an ethernet jack...because playing anything serious over wifi is a joke.

First, The Razer Naga I have plugged into the keyboard's USB hub doesn't power up (no lights on the naga) unless I remove it and then replug it in. When I remove it, Windows 8 gives it's customary ""device removed"" sound meaning it saw something there. When I plug it back in, windows 8 does activate the mouse and it's then displayed. I can do this at the boot menu too and the mouse will start working. 

Second problem. The keyboard green backlighting doesn't always turn off when I power down the computer. It will stay on indefinitely unless I power it back up and then shut it back down after the boot menu.

I've had my razer naga epic for about two years now and everything worked fine until i decided to go wireless mode a few days ago. For some reason i used wired mode all the time. it seemed to have trouble with the battery , even after hours of sitting on the station/on the cable it would blink red after around 30 min to 1 hour, but that's not the big issue here.

yesterday i forgot to put my mouse back on the station, which resulted in an empty battery this morning. no big deal i tought and went back to wired mode. however, now the lights don't go on (not my main concern either :) ) and the buttons have a 0.5-1 second delay (i need to hold the button down to get a response), which is rendering the mouse useless. the cursor reacts just fine.

i've plugged some old logitech mouse now, no problems. i'm not sure if contacting razer is of any help here because few companies offer support where i live and razer seems not to be around. googling the problem doesn't help, most posts i've found were either old, concerning other razer mouse models or related to the well known double-click and cursor lag issues. also, i don't know if the battery/wireless problem and the delay are related.

what i tried:

* unplug mouse
* uninstall driver using CCleaner
* download and install the driver from the razer page
* re plug the mouse
* restart computer
didn't work

then

* unplug mouse
* uninstall driver using CCleaner
* remove registry key (HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE -&gt; SOFTWARE -&gt; Razer) note: i'm not very good at stuff like this so i probably deleted the wrong entry/might have overlooked something anyways
* re plug the mouse

next i will repeat the second but restart and install the drivers and everything from the razer HP before plugging the mouse.

2. About once a week (sometimes more or less), my microphone stops sending my voice and sends what can only be described as hellish static and distortion. This occurs in TeamSpeak 3 and in Steam. I have also heard the sound from Windows when someone screams at me to stop talking. The only solution has been to move the mic boon up and down until it stops.

I won this headset in a contest done by HeLLsGamers. Sadly, I can't send the headset back because I don't have the receipt. Phone support suggested it was system related, but I can reproduce it on my wife's laptop and on my computer after reinstalling Windows.

I enjoy various types of gaming and I really don't care about maxing out my machine to the highest spec possible to squeeze out an extra few FPS while sacrificing portability. Of course, I know this from experience as I currently own a 4 year old Alienware M15 that weighs just shy of a shit-ton and is about two-three macbooks thick. 

Money is not an issue as I've been saving up, have a discount due to having an email address associated with one of the schools eligible for an educational discount, and my other choice would be ""suffering"" with a MacBook Pro so I was never buying a cheap laptop to begin with.

I'm here today to ask those who own this lovely piece of machinery what your honest thoughts are on the actual portability, battery life while not gaming, build quality, overall satisfaction, any downsides/things you wished you had considered before you purchased, etc.

Thank you very much for any and all help you can provide.

Help?,2,1,4,http://www.reddit.com/r/razer/comments/1iz2jk/o_key_on_razer_blade_14_inch_keeps_going_out/,"Ok so the LED on the letter o keeps going out.  I had to reinstall the factory install of Synapse in order to update my Synaptics driver that was having some problems.  Then the O key LED went out, and I found the fix on Razer's website.  It said to delete old profiles and create new ones, as it had something to do with previous installs of synapse.  This worked for a few days, then it went out again.  I fresh installed synapse (the second synapse was uninstalled, the key came on without restarting) and it fixed.  Now, a few days later, it is doing the same thing.  Constant reinstalls of synapse will get annoying.  Im starting to think Im not completely removing Synapse from my system.  Anybody have any advice or things I could try?  I sent a ticket to Razer already too.

EDIT: This time when I reinstalled synapse, it came back on but only at about half the brightness of the other keys.  What is up with this?  Im tempted to say that the LED is just faulty, but I can't understand why messing with Synapse still affects it.  The first time when I just deleted the profiles it came back to full brightness.  The second time when I uninstalled it came back to full brightness too.  

EDIT: I think I am just going to RMA.  I can't get the key back to full brightness no matter what I do.  I tried tinkering more with Synapse, creating a new account to not have any interferance from my other account, and I just can't get it to shine normally.  It isn't hugely noticable at its current brightness, but it was totally out yesterday and today before I fixed it, and if that happens its even more obnoxious.  

EDIT (again): at least they paid for shipping.  As long as I get it back before mid august when school starts and I don't get a refurbished one that someone has already used (I would honestly just ask for a refund and buy another laptop entirely if they did that) then I guess I don't have any big complaints.

I have an SSD so my OS loads pretty quickly, but the mouse simply won't work for around 2 to 3 minutes. (internet time... feels like ages)
It will move sparingly but doesn't respond for the better part.

Razer support told me to unplug and plug it back pressing right left and scroll to update firmware, that didn't work.

What did work, was unninstalling synapse and drivers altogether. So the mouse works with whatever windows uses as a driver.

It's extremely frustrating to have a gaming mouse actually be a burden. I buy a good mouse and it turns out, a stupid 5$ mouse would't give me this much grief.

Is there any solution that lets me use razer drivers and not have this issue?

I got a problem with my recently purchased Razer Naga Hex (green edition).
 
I plugged it in and it was working, as it should do. But then I read in the instructions there is a program I can put makros und the keys and I totally wanted to use this, so I went to the Razer homepage and downloaded/installed it. 

However when I started it there was the message: ""PLEASE CONNECT A RAZER SYNAPSE 2.0 ENABLED DEVICE"", while the Naga Hex was plugged in and working.

I contacted Razer support, but obviously they do not know what to do either. They recommended me to reinstall Synapse 2.0 and enable the USB legacy support in the BIOS. I did everything they said, but it still does not work.
Would be very nice if anybody of you guys can help me out with this problem.

This could last anywhere from 10-20 minutes. During lag, the mouse is unresponsive or gives a delayed response. The pointer will move without interruption for a period of time and then just stop for a split second.

Arrows seem to be pointing towards .Net Framework 4. There is either something wrong with their implementation or there is a bug in .Net itself.

After scouring the internet I found a forum post with a supposed fix. Uninstall .Net Framework, the client profile and Razer Synapse. Then reinstall .Net first, then Synapse. This seemed to work for awhile until the latest updates dropped on both .Net and Synapse.

Now for a new solution...

This attempt involves [rebuilding .net's native images](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2947118/wpf-slow-to-start-on-x64-in-net-framework-4-0).

Open up the command prompt as admin and enter the following (the path will differ if you are on 32-bit):

    cd C:\Windows\Microsoft.NET\Framework64\v4.0.30319
    ngen update

You may get a few exceptions as the image builds. This is normal. The process takes ~1 minute. **Note that you may have to do this every time .Net updates.**

This seems to have solved the lag issue again. But for how long? Who knows. This absurdity is partially Razer's fault for making a fancy app, when all we needed was functionality. There's no solid reason for making .Net a dependency and Synapse eats 40MB of memory just sitting in the tray.

1374868894.0,1,self.razer,1j49cb,Extremely disappointed with the DA 2013,6,5,11,http://www.reddit.com/r/razer/comments/1j49cb/extremely_disappointed_with_the_da_2013/,"I've had an old Microsoft mouse for about the past 8 years or so. It's an ambidextrous mouse, but I don't know the specific model.

In that time, my Microsoft mouse has worked great. However, I decided that I wanted a mouse with adjustable DPI and perhaps one that looked/felt a little nicer, as well.

Yesterday, I drove up to my local Best Buy and picked up a DA 2013. I got them to price match it to Amazon, too. Excited, I drove home and could hardly wait to get it out of the package and kick off the first night of my summer break with some awesome gaming.

My excitement was quickly ended when I made the first of two disappointing discoveries. Upon plugging the mouse in and downloading/running Synapse, I found that internet was *required* in order to access Synapse, and thus, any mouse settings whatsoever.

Without getting into why I think that's completely asinine, absurd, ludicrous, and downright wrong, I'll just say that I was extremely put off by this choice that Razer has made.

However, what really made me decide to return the mouse was the fact that I could not comfortably rest my middle finger on the right mouse button without accidentally depressing it.

I'm in the physical therapy field, but you don't have to be in order to understand how this would be uncomfortable for any length of time. Having to keep those extensor muscles engaged is not only a mental distractor, but a physical one as well.

There is a natural phenomenon called tenodesis grasp which is something that is very important to some people with spinal cord injuries who no longer have control over their fingers (but who can still control their wrist). However, it's something that everyone can perform, injury or not. Try this: hold you hand straight out in front of you, palm down. Try to completely relax your hand/fingers and then slowly bend your wrist so that the palm of your hand becomes perpendicular with the ground. Notice how your fingers close a bit? That's tenodesis grasp.

When using a mouse, your wrist is usually going to be in at least some degree of extension, which further strengthens tenodesis grasp. This, combined with the weight of my finger, is more than enough to overcome the small amount of resistance that the right mouse button offers. Also, I think that part of the problem may stem from the fact that the top of the mouse is one piece of thin plastic, so weight applied closer to the palm of the hand is transferred to the mouse buttons, as well.

Anyways, I didn't mean to write a book here, but I'm just severely disappointed in a product which costs a fair amount of money. For 60-70 bucks, I expect that the mouse will function very well, and look/feel nice, too. It seems Razer has their priorities backwards. The mouse looks and feels nice, but it doesn't function well.

Also, I'm aware that I could contact Razer and ask for a RMA, but it's my understanding that this is a rather widespread issue. I'd rather not play ""get the mouse without the problem"" with Razer.

To that end, I am returning the DA 2013 and looking for another mouse. I've already ordered a Zowie EC1-eVo which should arrive this Wednesday. However, I've also played around with the idea of simply replacing the switches on the DA 2013. I know how to solder, I just don't know anything about the switches themselves (which ones to buy, where to buy from ,etc.). I need to do some research. But if worse comes to worse, that may be what I end up doing. I can look past the issues with Synapse if I can have a mouse which feels and functions well. Like they say, if you want something done right, do it yourself.",,False,self,t5_2ssha,1374869206.0,,,True,t3_1j49cb,http://www.reddit.com/r/razer/comments/1j49cb/extremely_disappointed_with_the_da_2013/,
