Today I began my first day of my second year of teaching with preplanning.  The whole day was just crazy nostalgic as all I could think about was the difference between today and this day a year ago.  In short, almost nothing is the same.

A year ago I was so so scared.  I didn't know how to do ANYTHING at our school. I didn't know how to use the online gradebook, I didn't know anything about the standards in that state, I didn't know anyone.  The first few weeks were a whirlwind.  The more items I could actually slash off my to do list, the longer it would get.  I was going to bed at 8 and getting up at 6 just to make it through the day.  Most of all, I was constantly plagued by the question that my very soul longed to know the answer to, ""Can I do this?""  

Now, I've made it.  That year was the hardest of my entire life.  I learned more than I've ever learned, and I worked harder than I've ever worked, and it paid off.  All of my scores came out very average (3 out of 5, normal for a first year teacher).  I laughed, I cried, I became a woman.  Most of all though, I got an answer to that question, and the answer is YES.  I can do this.  I will do this.

Today I walked into that school butterfly free. I laughed and joked with old friends I hadn't seen in a while.  The kids will be here next week, and that doesn't make me nervous either.  I've broken up a fight in the middle of my lesson.  I've consoled a kid who's friend committed suicide. I've challenged the most challenging kids and won.  Bitch, there ain't NOTHING I can't handle.  

I'm writing this as a word of encouragement from someone who has come out on the other side stronger and better.  The memory of year-ago me filled with doubts, fears, and insecurities is too fresh, so I wanted to give all of you first year teachers a virtual hug.  Please keep posting on /r/teachers because the least we can do is be there for each other.  

Everyone else too, HAVE A GREAT YEAR!

Edit: Wow! Thanks for all the responses guys! It has been great to wake up and read all these comments!

___

I wasn't always in this system, I used to go to a private, Christian school. I hated it, mostly because I was gay and not very conservative-thinking like the rest of the students and teachers. I live in the deep South and it was difficult to not kill myself, but after 9th grade I decided I had enough of it. I transferred to my local public high school to see how things would go there. I live in the deep South, so I imagined it would be just as rough. My brother said I was possessed by the devil, so things weren't much better at home than at school. But things changed, because **teachers are fucking awesome.**

I met a teacher there who changed my life. He was Catholic, but he was loving and had an open mind. He said, ""Are you religious? You don't have to answer that, but if you are, I promise you - God doesn't hate you. You're not going to hell because you're gay. God loves you all the same. If you're not religious, then you don't have to worry about that. Don't give, you're almost out of this place. You're smart, don't let people who are ignorant win - they'll stay ignorant and you'll get stronger."" 

I was clinically depressed and spent nights writing him paragraphs upon paragraphs in emails when I couldn't sleep, and he responded to each one the next morning before I was even awake. He is one of the best men I know, and I honestly believe he and my other teachers are the reason I didn't kill myself. I have had multiple teachers like this at my new school who have helped me through this rough patch in my life. They've taught me tolerance, patience, how to work hard, and how to cope with people who don't always like you, and that they don't matter.

They've taught me that money doesn't make a life worth living, and that **things get better, and high school isn't my life.** More than anything, I want to go to California for college. They've given me the drive and hope that I'll make it there, and they've kept me from dropping out and running from home, because things are literally that bad.

Anyways, I've always felt being a teacher is a relatively thankless job in comparison to how much help they give. I wanted to take my time to write here. So, in summary:

TL;DR: **Whether you realize it or not, you can save a life, you can get someone into their dream college, you can make a shitty situation at home into something that a kid can deal with. You can teach a kid something that his parents didn't care enough to teach him. You can make a kid feel like he's worth something. Teachers are the real heroes - thank you for everything you guys do.**

They also took away PE for the rest of this year and replaced it with a computer math class. They decided to hold a peaceful protest/sit-in at the school garden until the Principal came down and heard them. 
They peacefully stood there and refused to go to class, asking to be heard from the admin. The principal refused to come down and see them and so they wouldn't leave until the principal agreed to a designated meeting time and place for all voices to be heard. As we rounded them up for class, the intermediate AP told us to be quiet and ignore that it happened until 3 that day (the designated meeting time).
Instead, we turned it into a day of teachable moments which the kids mainly led. They learned to voice concerns on paper, wrote down their grievances and how they hope it could be solved together, learned of other protests and marches throughout history, and talked to us about how best to be heard without being seen like little kids. They elected leaders to voice their concerns at the meeting. 

We had nothing to do with this. The kids organized this all within hours after school and took care of this themselves. It was amazing to watch these 12-14 yr olds be empowered in a way that was pretty mature and logical. It proved what we already knew about these kids: that they are amazing and beautiful and strong despite anything going on around them (it is a really rough community with high poverty, drugs, and homeless rates) and that they are capable of so much when given the chance. 

There were, of course, people that jumped on the bandwagon and tried to use it as a way to skip class and be a rebel....but the ones that really cared went straight to class when they were promised their after school meeting and have impressed me intensely with their bravery and love of the land. 

tl;dr: All the middle schoolers at my school protested admin decisions at the school by planning a sit-in and getting a meeting with the principal. edit: They did this is an awesomely mature manner and I was super impressed by their choice of words and actions.

Today, I did a little research on Pearson, and I have to say I am quite disturbed by what I found.

A quick look at Wikipedia tells me that Pearson PLC is a British publishing company out of London.  “It is the largest education company and the largest book publisher in the world.  It has three main branches: Pearson Education, Financial Times Group, and Penguin (Book) Group.  

I’d like to take a moment here to remind us of one of the biggest complaints we hear from students: the price of textbooks.  They’re expensive, required, and already last year’s edition by the time you buy them.  We have the technology to do away with paper books to an extent- heck, we have the technology, resources, and willingness to deliver content in a much more open-source, community-centered manner through wikis and such- but we’re still using textbooks.  Hey, whose business is it to publish books?  And whose business is it to determine content?
Hmm.

Looking at their history, it picks up in the 21st century.  “In September 2000, Pearson acquired National Computer Systems (NCS, Inc.) and entered the educational assessment and school management systems market in the United states. …in 2003 it secured control of Edexcel”, which is the company that awards certifications and qualifications.   But wait, it can’t be that bad, can it?  Who awards teacher certifications?  

Let’s see, I took the New York State Teacher Certification Examinations™, which were published by… well, I couldn’t seem to find that information, but the Praxis exams which certify teachers in other states is published by the Educational Testing Service (ETS), which apparently is criticized for being a “highly competitive business operation that is as much multinational monopoly as nonprofit institution”.[38] Due to its legal status as a non-profit organization, ETS is exempt from paying federal corporate income tax on many, but not all, of its operations. Furthermore, it does not need to report financial information to the Securities and Exchange Commission. “ Well that’s bothersome.  And a quick google search of “ETS and Pearson” comes up with this:
“Beginning in January 2006, the Graduate Management Admissions Test (GMAT) will be administered by Pearson VUE, the electronic exam delivery subsidiary of the global conglomerate Pearson, which is also responsible for scoring the SAT I “Writing” exam essay section.”

So Pearson is actively acquiring other certification/qualification exams.
(http://www.fairtest.org/ets-loses-sat-writing-test-contract )

Here’s what sparked this little investigation: I received an email from Commissioner King about the current goings on in NYSED and such.  At the bottom of the message, past the fold and pretty graphics, was the headline “Notes”.  
“On June 1, 2013, NYSED released the New York City Teacher and Principal Evaluation Plan. Legislation enacted earlier this year mandated that NYSED impose an Annual Professional Performance Review (APPR) plan for any district without an approved plan in place by May 29.“

So if you don’t have an approved plan by May 29th, they’ll pick one for you.  Ok.  Then, further down, an invitation to field test the School Building Leader Assessment (SBL), which, when I go to the page (http://www.nystce.nesinc.com/fieldtest.asp )  , I find out is actually a New York State Teacher Certification Examination and- Oh no.  Oh no, oh no.  You can participate in this pilot test at Pearson Authorized Test Centers.  That can’t possibly mean that Pearson wrote the NYSTCE tests, can it?  But then, a link on the page brings me to this:

“The Evaluation Systems group of Pearson develops standards-based, criterion-referenced teacher licensure testing programs. Evaluation Systems provides states with a wide variety of teacher licensure services such as test development, administration, and scoring and collaborates with state education agencies and teacher preparation programs to provide support for prospective teachers preparing to take the exams.” (http://www.pearsonvue.com/espilot/ )

Pearson awarded me my teaching certificate.  And I’ll be teaching with Pearson’s materials, to the tests that- no, Pearson doesn’t write the standardized tests for students, does it?
But it does.  According to this article, “Pearson has a five-year, $32 million contract to create tests for the state” for students.  (http://gothamschools.org/2013/04/22/pearsons-nyc-misstep-draws-state-education-officials-concern/ )

Why is no one outraged at this?  Pearson has a monopoly- not a monopoly on goods, services, or resources, but a monopoly on minds.  They control what is taught, how it’s taught, what materials are used, and who teaches it.  Maybe there’s some wiggle room for style and personality, but in the end, we’re all playing by Pearson’s rules.

I’m horrified, and terrified. 
Thoughts?  Reassurance that it’s not that bad?

Instead of plagiarising from, for example, Anne Applebaum's column (featured on the Washington Post website), she uses the better written comments made by readers below that column. Google does not include these in its searches. If the student's paper had not been ABOUT Anne Applebaum's recent columns, I'd never have caught her.

Sometimes kids are assholes. It's blasphemy to say it in our profession so, I turn to reddit for my rant.

Today a 6th grader stole another teachers wallet, took a significant sum of cash, and discarded it. She showed no remorse and just said how poor she is and how she wanted to buy her mom a Mother's Day present. Because of this sob story, the principal (who isn't very bright) let her off the hook. 

This kid knows right from wrong; if she didn't, she wouldn't have gone to such great lengths to conceal what she did and she wouldn't have known what buttons to push to get sympathy and when to push them. 

But I feel like when I tell these types of stories to my friends and even sometimes other teachers, I get things like ""she doesn't understand"" or ""she needs more love, not harsh consequences."" Are we not doing this kid and those of similar background and behavior a disservice by not imposing consequences in the name of pity? We assume her intentions were pure (again, wrong) and then essentially teach her that if someone you love wants something (or you want to give them something), go on.

I requested that she come back in after school so that we could enjoy the cake together and when she did, she and a handful of my other students sang Happy Birthday for me.

[Birthday card from my student](http://imgur.com/qQhqHhI)

Just the day before I was hosting an after-school review session for an upcoming exam. I had nearly 25 students show up, many of whom have been struggling in class so I was very happy they came. We stayed until after 5pm. When the last three girls were packing up to leave, one of them commented: ""Asclepias_Metis, I've never done well in science until I got to your class."" She worked really hard to earn a B last semester (and is struggling a little this semester but is working hard to pull her grade back up. She’s failing almost all of her other classes). I asked, ""Why is that?"" She responded: ""It's you. You're an amazing teacher. You actually care and you love what you're doing and it shows."" That in itself almost made me start crying right there and then. The other girls chimed in with comments along the lines of how they felt that I worked so hard to create fun activities, how I was good at communicating really confusing things in ways they could understand, and that they liked that I was so willing to help them when they needed extra help. I didn't hesitate to reply that hearing that I was making that difference for them is what made it all worthwhile.

When they left, I cried. I've been working &gt; 60 hour weeks nearly all academic year. I wasn't lying when I said something as simple as getting a ""thank you"" from my students made all the difference. My students are absolutely amazing, inspiring, and motivating, and it's small things like this that make it all worthwhile.

I hope that if you’re reading this and you’re a teacher who’s struggling to get through the rest of the year like I’ve been that you can find some glimmer of hope in this message.

I had a student--let's call him Lance--and he was a genuine thug. Lance was not only a gang banger, he was a gang leader and known as a pretty a ""successful"" drug dealer. Of course he didn't do jack in the classroom and when I asked why he even bothered coming, he told me ""School is the only place that I can do my business without worrying about getting shot.""

Well sadly, he was fatally shot three times last Saturday and they had his funeral on Wednesday and I attended. During the service, they dressed him in a red jersey with a red hat and put about $1000 in his hands. Everyone was crying like one would expect, but the screams I heard weren't the, ""It wasn't his time"" or ""Take me instead"" that everyone knows.

12 and 13 year old girls were saying, ""I should've had a baby by him.""

Young men were yelling, ""We know who it was and we got somebody about to cut him down right now.""

His own mother eulogized him saying, ""He died a soldier, just like his daddy. All of y'all should hope to die the same way.""

I've spent years asking how kids could live like this and now I finally realize that it's bred into them. Moms are girl for the gangs, who aspire to have babies by the members. Dads have probably had multiple kids by multiple women. The new moms teach the boys that they should be with the gang and teach the girls to get pregnant by the gang members all over again. How do you get over this obstacle for kids when they just multiply?

I am now a 2nd year teacher...far from a pro in any means. I can almost guarantee you that had I have known some of these things (that perhaps you aren't taught in college) I would have had a much less stressful rookie year.
Please add on to the list everyone!

1.Come up with a simple method of grading homework (ex. don't grade every single problem...it will consume you.

2.Rubrics..Rubrics..Rubrics. At least have some method of grading or a model BEFORE students turn in their assignments. There is nothing worse than a pile of papers that have all veered in different directions and then you have to figure out what the hell to do. Rubrics give me the evidence I need to be able to sleep at night.
Don't bitch with others just because they are bitching...people complain A WHOLE LOT at school....if you join in you view the entire school as a negative environment...simply walk away.

3.Have a place to put extra copies of past work. When a student is absent they know where to get the copies...and you don't have to run around like a chicken with its head cut off because you can't find a copy/have to print one out...during class.

4.Understand that you can only help students that will accept it. If they aren't at least a little bit invested then there is little you can do to help them succeed. This does not mean give up on students, it simply means if it is March and that student is still refusing to do anything despite your differentiated approaches/every other trick you know then there is little that you can do to succeed.

5.One night a week leave the building and all of your work at the sound of the bell (or when you can contractually leave). And also do not feel guilty about doing this...remember this is a job...a unique one...but still a job..and you cannot always be focused on it. You need to remember to relax and enjoy life if you are going to reach your potential in this career. 

6.On the night of parent conferences, do not just stay at school and fall asleep at your desk and be woken up by the first parent four hours later ready for their meeting....this one make come from personal experience.

7.Know what you want students to learn out of a lesson before you teach it...it avoids a boring lesson/waste of everyone's time.

8.Understand that this job is one that is very unique and you deal with individuals from all different walks of life. Try to not hold a grudge against a student for a previous action they have done. Just as they are learning academics, they are also learning life lessons. If you give up on them/noticeably display a sign of displeasure with them...they will never forget that someone gave up on them when they were ____years old.

The focus of the dinner is for the students to invite a teacher of their choosing and say a few words about them. Our school has about 1,100 students, but we usually only have about a dozen who qualify for the dinner, so being invited is something of a big deal. 

This is my 5th year teaching and my second straight year being invited. This year I was invited by a student I'd had as a sophomore and a junior (different subjects) who is now the salutatorian and headed to U of M (my Alma mater) in the fall. He spoke about how he changed his mind about what he wants to do with his life because of me and how he considers me more than a teacher, but also a friend. 

At this time of year, it's easy to get burned out and frustrated with students who failed to live up to their potential, but I wanted to share how incredible I feel right now with everyone in hopes that you all remember why we're doing this. For all the talk of being unappreciated and underpaid, nothing compares to this feeling, and I'm betting most 'jobs' don't offer anything like this.

1365468599.0,99,self.Teachers,1bygvy,An open letter to elementary school parents,109,10,29,http://www.reddit.com/r/Teachers/comments/1bygvy/an_open_letter_to_elementary_school_parents/,"I mostly love the parents of the students I teach. They are good people, and most of the time thoroughly enjoyable to interact with. Every now and then, though, there's *something*... and so often the same somethings. Today was one of those ""now and thens."" To vent a little, I wrote this letter.

Dear parents of elementary-school children,

Here are some things you can do to make your child's teacher's life easier:

1. Write your child's name in or on everything she brings to school. This goes double if the school has uniforms, but even for non-uniform items, I do not recognize all 200 raincoats that my students wear.

2. Return permission slips on time. You expect your son to turn in his homework on time, right?

3. Read things teachers send to you. I know you get a lot of email; we do too. We hopefully try to send you as little as possible. That means that when we do send you something, it's important. Extra credit: Before you email me asking, ""Where can I find the permission slip you need?"" try checking for messages from me.

4. Read your child's report card. Before I write a report, I observe each student for hours and review all her work to try to get at how she is as a student. If you have a parent-teacher conference and receive the reports more than 24 hours before it, read them before you meet with the teacher.

5. If you are upset with one of your child's teachers - over a report card, an assignment, anything - contact that teacher directly. Complaining to another teacher doesn't help solve the problem, and makes that other teacher feel awkward.

6. If you are going to take your child out of school for a family trip, understand that this means he will miss some things. It is highly unlikely that we will reschedule the school play, the science fair, or the concert for one child. We also may not be able to put together ""a packet"" that will give your child the same learning experience he would have had if he had been at school for two weeks. (If we do put together work for your child to do on the trip, though, please help him find time to do it! It is extremely frustrating to spend two hours getting something ready at your request, only to hear upon your return that ""we didn't really have time."")

7. Let your children fail sometimes. Let them make mistakes. If your son leaves his homework until the last minute, let him go to school without it and face the consequences. If your daughter's idea for a science project disregards the laws of physics, let her try that and discover it for herself. She will learn so much more than if you instead guide her on an easy path.

8. Know that we love your children. We want what is best for them. We know that you do, too. We don't want an adversarial relationship with you; we want to work as a team. Give us the benefit of the doubt and come talk things over with us.

Warmly,
a teacher",,False,,t5_2qqcs,False,,,True,t3_1bygvy,http://www.reddit.com/r/Teachers/comments/1bygvy/an_open_letter_to_elementary_school_parents/,

Dad and I looked at them, saw that the lines were going up and she's above average, so we figured she was doing fine.

Today was her spring parent teacher conference. Her pre-algebra teacher explained those results to us. We know it's only one out of a slew of assessments, but he was still pretty excited. Her score went up 250 points and put her in the 99th percentile nationwide. The district average (23K kids; you can do the math to figure out how many are sixth graders) was an increase of only 50 points.

Students are encouraged to attend spring conferences, and my daughter did today. When her teacher explained what a big deal this was for her, we congratulated her, told her she was awesome, etc. Then I said to the teacher that he must be amazing too, because she'd never had results like that before. Apparently he's a pretty humble guy, because he immediately said it was all about my daughter. 

Now, I don't want to diminish her work in any way, but this is a kid who routinely used to cry over her math homework, who would argue with her dad and me when we tried to help her, who would sit at the kitchen table staring out the window and whining instead of just doing her homework. Somehow her teacher this year figured out how to connect her with math, how to interest her, how to show her that she really is good at it, how to encourage her.

I know he's not the only teacher of his kind out there, so tonight I'm telling all of you.....thank you, kudos, keep your heads up. Some of us out here understand how hard it is to do what you do, and we appreciate it.

I am a 35 years old teacher from Norway (really cold place in Northern Europe), and I've been working like a dog the past 4 years and it's finally given results. 

Before coming to my school, I came from an ""alternative"" background. It had left me debt-ridden and angry at myself for what I'd done with my life and to my wife.

I started out as a teacher substitute without a teacher education. Had to pay off some nasty bills, and didn't think I'd stay for long, but seing students rise and grow, did something to me. I was hooked, so I started studying next to working. 100% work + 100% studies left me with 4-6 hours sleep every night for the past 4 years. My debt was over 40.000$, so in order to stay alive, I accepted all extra tasks for a little extra pay.
 
About 8 months ago (after working for 3 years), I got hired for real, and thought life couldn't get any better. My debts were gone, I'd bought an appartment, and all I needed was to get a little better pay, so my wife could quit her crappy waitress job and resume her studies too. I decided to do some off-hours work to pay my school back, so I wrote a couple of teaching books that were designed to help people with reading disabilities to learn how to use a computer. A publisher read them and wanted to publish. I turned him down, and gave them to the school. They eventually replaced the standard teaching books in some of the classes.

3 weeks ago, the principal came into my office and told me she wanted me in a leader-program to take over one of the departments at school. She told me she'd been following me going from a beaten kid who offered his services for next to nothing, to a man taking charge of projects and (apparently) getting people to join in with enthusiasm.

When I returned to my wife with the news, we walked down to her job and delivered the resignation. Now she's free too! My sweetheart will never again carry plates for ungreatful customers.
Right now, It feels like ""...and they lived happily ever after"". 
Had to share! Too happy!

1365969299.0,77,self.Teachers,1ccc1i,Tips for being a good substitute teacher.,88,11,25,http://www.reddit.com/r/Teachers/comments/1ccc1i/tips_for_being_a_good_substitute_teacher/,"This topic came up in another post recently and I was asked to post a list of things I do as a substitute teacher that makes the students, teachers and administrators like having me around.

Background:  I have been working as a substitute for the last 3 years or so, and a majority of that time has been at the local public high school. *(I also subbed at charter schools and in other districts, but that is another story) In the last three years I have gained a lot of experience, formed bonds with the students, and received great recommendations from administrators.

This is a list of things that I do and that have worked for me.  I understand that everyone has their style and things that work for them. Please feel free to add your own suggestions.

* Try to learn as many students names as possible.  It creates a feeling of familiarity and respect between you and the students.  It is nice walking down the hallway and saying hello to students by name. 

* If possible get the lesson plans ahead of time.  The teachers appreciate you putting in the effort and if it is your subject area, the teachers will be more likely to trust you with actually teaching curriculum. (not to mention practice for new teachers)

* I bring my tablet with me and will plug it in to the speakers and play music for the students if they are just working on stuff or hanging out (homeroom, etc.) I usually try to relate the music to what ever class I am subbing for. So I play German pop and rap music in German class. Even though I don't speak much German, the teacher loves having me sub for her because she knows I will expose the students to German culture.  
- occasionally I will play funny (and appropriate) youtube videos. (again class related, sometimes.) Household hacker and vsauce when I am subbing for science.

* Volunteer your help during your prep period.  I help out in the library and this helps me to recognize students, interact with teachers and the administration sees that I am putting in extra effort while the other subs are just hanging out doing nothing.  

* Get to know the secretary.  This is who I talk to about scheduling the days I work. She has access to the sub system and can look up any openings before they are officially posted, and she also has a list that isn't in the computer yet.  Because of this, I am often scheduled weeks in advance.

* When it comes to discipline, I don't believe in sending students to the office unless it is absolutely necessary.  I rely more on gaining the respect of the students and respecting them in return.  I don't raise my voice, (which can be tough sometimes) and I try to find out what is wrong rather than being accusatory. 

* If students refuse to do work during class, my common response is, ""That's fine. I can't force you to do anything.  But here is the deal.  You need to write a letter to your teacher explaining why you refused to do any work in class today.  If you don't want to write it, that's fine. Then I will write it.""  Usually this will get them to take out their work and start doing something, but I have had some students opt for the note.  At this point it is out of my hands and their regular teacher can handle.  I also usually follow up with the teacher to find out how they dealt with the student.

This is all I have time to write right now. Sorry for the wall of text.  If you have any other questions, I will try to answer them when I can.

Today one of my favorite parents came to me with a screen shot of a petition to get me fired. It has 30 names on it. The issues are that I'm not teaching my students anything (I created a curriculum and they've never had one. But I'm using Kodaly and Orff. They've never heard of it.) My concerts are ruckuses and the parents don't even want to go. (We're in a gym. With no microphones. It's boomy and parents let their other children run up and down the bleachers.) We play on dumb toys (I only have those diatonic xylophones, the metal ones, and some resonator bars along with unpitched stuff. We used boom whackers at the concert and my kids worked so hard on that music. They really put their music reading skills to the test.) I could go on and on. But they are calling me incompetent and it's getting really bad. I may or may not be back next year anyway due to my husband's job and moving to Georgia, but I don't want this to get out of hand. Any suggestions? 

EDIT: elementary boss is gone on field trips for the next two days. High School principal laughed and said not to worry (I'm worried because the school board just fired our high school history teacher after the principal recommended him for another year.) I have no union here. The school is unwilling to change, because the first thing I tried to do was have smaller class concerts, but parents apparently want an in-school large concert in the gym.

I'm basing that off when I stopped feeling like a newbie (finishing my 5th year now). 

* Create a curriculum - give them a 'canned' curriculum that has been developed by a master teacher complete with assessments.
* Teach more than 2 preps
* Face classes larger than 25 - I know it seems backward, but more experienced teachers should be better equipped to deal with larger classes. It's not a punishment OR reward, it's what's best for the students. 
* Teach an AP class - the College Board recommends (requires?) teachers being 'certified' to teach AP classes by taking a 4 day workshop. Even IF a new teacher takes the workshop, it's unlikely they're ready to handle the rigor of the course.
* Be class sponsors - I'm sure it sounds like a good idea, having the new teacher develop a rapport with the students, but they've got enough on their plate without the added workload of extra-curricular activities.
* Coach sports - this one's tricky. I would say new teachers shouldn't even be allowed to coach/hold down a 2nd job, but I totally understand how bad the money is and how much more income might be needed. I just think it's damn near impossible to be absorbing all there is to teaching with attention focused elsewhere.

We have about 750 students and 50 some odd staff. Yesterday a change was made to the district print server in attempts to force print jobs to store in mailboxes. Previously, i had to touch each machine to set it to store and choose a mailbox. We were told by the copier company that if it was set to store by default on the server the user would be prompted to select their box. Nice fix, if it works. It didn't. No one in the building could print. I had 6 classes today and couldn't get out to help anyone. On a good day I have about an hour, maybe two if i come in before 7:00, for tech time. I was over whelmed with calls and teachers coming in for help. They needed the printer reinstalled and the printing preferences set to store. I turned to one of my smaller 5th grade classes. I showed 16 kids twice how to install the printer and set the preferences. I wrote the server address on several index cards and sent them out. An hour later they had swept through the building installing printers on multiple computers in each classroom and office. They worked in teams, were focused and came back if they got stuck. These 10 and 11 year olds did such great work today. I am so very proud of them. I absolutely love my job and kids like this are one of the reasons why. They were just spectacular!
Follow up: the next day I asked the kids if any of them remembered the server address, most all did and asked me to show them some other ""tricks"". I'm not a true geek, so I only know what central office has taught me to support my school. I showed them a few shortcuts and they were very excited. One student said, ""I hope something else beaks soon so we can go help again!"" And they all said ""yeah!"" I decided or reinforce the knowledge they had and we typed up the directions in Word and spent a little time on formatting. My theory as a teacher (who has taught many content areas over the years) is that any lesson, no EVERY lesson, needs to connect to something relevant to the student now but also shine a light on some big idea or life long knowledge. In short, to me, only a small part of this experience is about resolving the print issue. That would have been fixed anyway by me or the teachers or district IT.

1344703482.0,64,self.Teachers,y1wxf,Tips for interviewing -- based on my experience interviewing 12 English teachers in the last few weeks,68,4,20,http://www.reddit.com/r/Teachers/comments/y1wxf/tips_for_interviewing_based_on_my_experience/,"I'm the English department chair for a high school in VA, and after sitting through quite a few less-than-terrific interviews, I wanted to offer some suggestions to those still out there going through the process:

1.  Be specific.  When asked about your classroom management strategies, how you will differentiate for various levels/learners, or what an average class period looks like, please consider giving concrete examples.  Tell your interviewers about a particular lesson plan, activity or experience managing a rowdy crew.  We want to be able to picture you in a classroom, so the more details the better.

2.  Show your passion.  Passion for teaching and/or kids is not always something that can be learned, and oftentimes administration will hire someone with a weaker resume simply because their enthusiasm makes them believe she/he WILL learn strategies and seek professional development -- because he/she loves teaching.  I understand that sometimes nerves make this difficult, but I offer this tip: Have in mind a lesson plan you loved teaching.  When a question comes up that allows you to tell about it, you will, likely, do so with gusto.

3.  Speak to how you can/will use technology in the classroom.  Nationally, there is a push to incorporate more technology in and outside the classroom to engage learners.  Familiarize yourself with edmodo, prezi, study island, blended learning (to name a few) and be prepared to talk about how you might use them as part of your instruction or class management.

4.  When you get that pesky ""what are your strengths and weaknesses"" question, for the love of all that is holy, speak to how you work to improve your weakness.  That is what we really want to hear.  So, if your weakness is ""I tend to take a long time grading papers because I write so many comments"" then add ""but I have been looking at a variety of rubrics that I believe will allow me to grade as meaningfully in less time.""

5.  Mention what you would be willing to advise/coach/sponsor.  Most schools want teachers to be a part of their community, and one way to accomplish this is to be involved with students outside the classroom.  Additionally, this speaks to your commitment to kids and the school.  I know not everyone can advise the yearbook or coach baseball (due to skill or time commitments) but if you state that you would be willing to co-advise or co-sponsor, that sends the same message.  Bonus points if you are willing to advise something no one else seems to want to do, like the newspaper or SCA.  (On a personal note, that is how I got both of my jobs -- I was willing to advise the publications at my schools.  I don't do it anymore, but it got my foot in the door, despite never having touched design software.  If you are smarter than the average bear (and you are) you can figure out how to advise many clubs with a bit of help from the internet and colleagues).

I've been teaching for 10 years and sat on many an interview panel, and I've often wanted to suggest these tips to prospective hires.  Of course, we cannot do that, so I thought I'd toss them out here.  I'm sure others have more suggestions and I hope they are added.

Last May I was watching ""60 Minutes"" and their special on Kahn Academy and the Flipped Classroom. It was astounding to see this new theory and its application within the classroom. I was inspired to take Kahn Academy's ideas and adapt them to a Social Studies curriculum. I bought a $2.99 screen capture app on my Mac (there are free versions, but they were not very user-friendly) and spent my summer recording over 120 videos for U.S History I and II, Modern World History Since 1950 and World Geography. They were rough, but I was proud of the work I had put in. When the 2012-2013 school year came the environment in my classroom thrived and feedback from students and administration into my flipped classroom was better than I expected. Inspired by this feedback, I have created a second generation of videos for my classes as I move to a new school. These videos are for Ancient World History (Mesopotamia-The Middle Passage) and Sociology. These videos are more uniform, polished, detailed and professional. I am making these videos public and have put them on Youtube for other Social Studies teachers to use. I am not seeking money or notoriety, I only wish to help other teachers as other teachers have helped me. Our collective goal should be to help every one of our students reach their full potential, and to accomplish that we need to work together. Here is the link to my Youtube Channel.

I've developed a very dry sense of humor that's sometimes difficult for adults to catch on to and is completely inappropriate among kids. I have always loved my students, but I've had a hard time showing them how much I care because I'm not naturally outgoing. My colleagues always knew how much I cared about my students because they saw how hard I worked, and how hard I fought administrative decisions that were not in my students' best interests. However, my students didn't always understand because of my quiet, serious demeanor. 

At the beginning of the year, I resolved to bring a new kind of energy to my classroom. I resolved to smile more, to greet every student at the door, to express my excitement about learning in a more outward way, to respond to my struggling/problem students with vocal concern, to actually tell my students how much I care about them daily, especially when they're trying my patience. 

It is exhausting. I pretend to be an entirely different person 8 hours a day because I'm a low-key person who doesn't normally express her feelings. However, my attitude adjustment is working. Even the toughest kids are easier to work with when I shower them with concern, and they know that when I apply consequences, it really is because I want what's best for them.

During winter break, I'm probably going to hide in my house for two weeks with a pile of books, but during the school year, I'm the extrovert that I never knew I could be.

1376084985.0,52,self.Teachers,1k1xmj,Some suggestions for student teachers.,60,8,38,http://www.reddit.com/r/Teachers/comments/1k1xmj/some_suggestions_for_student_teachers/,"Hi /r/teachers!

I just graduated this spring with my degree in education, and got offered a job at the high school where I was student teaching. I remember student teaching being one of the most nerve-wracking experiences I had, so I thought I'd add my two cents. A lot of the steps I took (either intentionally or unintentionally) really boosted my confidence in the classroom, and I think it helped me tremendously in getting the position at my school.

1. Try to meet with your mentor teacher before the start of the semester, if at all possible. I talked with mine to compare our teaching styles/philosophies, and to talk about my role and our expectations of each other in the class. Even if you can't do this before school starts, either agree to come earlier/stay later to sit down and get acquainted with each other.

2. LEARN YOUR STUDENT'S NAMES AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE. I really can't stress this one enough. Ask you mentor teacher if you can take attendance, print out a seating chart, and study the names. It makes it so much easier to build rapport with the students, thus making them more likely to behave during your instructional time. Besides, these kids have some really interesting stories! On a side note, if you can, go to their events and show your support. Students notice when you make the effort.

3. Don't be afraid to ask questions! Not just from your mentor teacher, but survey your students, other faculty and administration, even parents and other student teachers. I learned so much from just asking questions I felt kind of stupid asking, but getting acquainted with policies, procedures, software, etc. really helped me feel like a legitimate teacher.

4. Don't be afraid to make mistakes. If you have a good mentor teacher, they will allow (and expect) you to fail with a safety net. Hopefully, this will give you honest feedback. As for the students, as long as you are candid with them and own up to your mistakes, they are usually very understanding. Kind of a given with this one - don't be afraid to try something really different. Since you have that safety net, you can test it out before you get your own class.

5. Take notes! Especially when you see something you like, write it down or you will probably forget it. For the first week, that's all I did really. It helped me  become familiar with the classroom. When you actually get up there yourself, don't be afraid to audio or video record yourself teaching. It's quite eye-opening, and a great tool for reflection. 

6. Observe as many other teachers (in all subjects) as you can. You'll get so much more information about classroom setups, organization, teaching styles, etc. A neat thing to observe is how one of your students may act in a different classroom.

7. Be prepared! Kind of a no-brainer, but some people like to wing it. That usually won't work out well for you until you really master teaching. A good rule of thumb is a section of instruction should not exceed 15 minutes or engagement will stop dropping. If you know what to move on to after that time, it is more seamless.

8. Get up in front of the class as much as you can. Exposure to teaching is the best way to really get comfortable. Make sure you have some time when your mentor teacher leaves the room. This will not only help you gain confidence, but the kids will identify you as an authority figure if they are used to you interacting with them all the time. It is a great feeling to transition from a guest to a co-teacher.

That is all I can think of at the moment. I know not every experience is going to be the same as mine; some mentor teachers may be more controlling, your student teaching program has some restrictions,  whatever. Just try to soak up as much as you can, throw yourself out of your comfort zone and have fun! Remember, learning to teach is a slow process, you are going to get frustrated, there are going to be days when you want to cry, and there will be plenty of days where everything goes wrong or you simply don't know what to do. This is your time to work out those kinks. 

As long as you are genuine reflecting and learning from your mistakes, the teacher (and even the admin) may notice your growth.",,False,,t5_2qqcs,False,,,True,t3_1k1xmj,http://www.reddit.com/r/Teachers/comments/1k1xmj/some_suggestions_for_student_teachers/,

(I'm teaching high school)",52,4,43,http://www.reddit.com/r/Teachers/comments/wc09d/rteachers_what_are_your_most_effective_behavioral/,"I've made a bunch of threads in this subreddit because I'm super nervous about starting my first year next month.

So, I'm teaching at a very large school. Apparently administration is kind of non-existent when it comes to discipline. My options as a teacher is sending them to detention or sending them to get expelled. Everything else is to be handled in the classroom.

When I was observing I noticed that the teachers kind of let the students do whatever they want. In one class I saw everyone race to the board during their bell ringer to put their name on it. I asked the teacher what it was for and she called it a bathroom list...everyone would ask to go every day so she made them get in a line. Does that seem weird? Why should the students leave the class every single day to go to the bathroom? Isn't that too much?

Also, I noticed the students cursed a lot. It doesn't really offend me but seems inappropriate. The teachers did nothing. A teacher told a student to ""get to work"" and he said ""listen here woman"" and then laughed. She didn't really react to that either. I was kind of horrified at the disrespect.

I'm teaching science and when I observed labs the students just kind of walked around not doing anything. They didn't focus on their work.

I observed four classes and only one teacher seemed to have it under control. I asked her about her discipline plan but she couldn't really explain how she got them to act appropriately for class.

I feel like I'm rambling. I am incredibly nervous.


Tl;dr: I am teaching at a high school where the administration is not very involved in discipline. How can I create a classroom environment that encourages students to act appropriately and do their work? Are there any in-class consequences that work?

I'm a Reddit regular, but this is my first time posting to /r/teachers. I created a throwaway account because some of my coworkers know my actual account.


I work as a private tutor through a tutoring agency. I love teaching despite the long hours and low pay. And I love most of my students. However, there are some bad apples... really bad apples that sometimes make me reconsider my career choice.


Today, my agency assigned a new student, a 3 year old boy. My agency previously sent a tutor to this boy (let's call him Harry), but ""it didn't work out."" So I show up as a replacement to the boy's house for our 5:00 appointment. Ring the doorbell. Nobody's home. I wait a few minutes for the family to show up. Turns out the nanny took the boy to the playground and the mother and father won't be back until later. Okay, that's fine. I'm normally a chill person so I don't feel too upset about waiting for Harry and the nanny.


Finally Harry and the nanny show up at around 5:25. Before I can even begin the lesson, Harry throws a fit because he wants to watch tv. I tell him we can watch tv after we learn a nursery rhyme. He runs over to the tv and turns it on. I walk over and turn it off. He screams and throws my purse onto the floor. When I bend down to pick up my purse, Harry throws himself at me and starts throwing punches. He lands a few solid ones and clocks me right on the nose.


Now, what I neglected to mention is my recent nose job. My nose hasn't completely healed so his punch feels like a sledgehammer to my face. I'm trying to hold back the tears and silently panicking about possible permanent damage. Meanwhile, this kid is screaming and crying because he can't watch tv. I'm thinking: ""KID, I'M THE ONE WHO GOT PUNCHED IN THE FACE. I SHOULD BE THE ONE SCREAMING AND CRYING."" But I'm not this kid's mom and he obviously doesn't know any better. So I remain calm and tell Harry that he should apologize since hitting people is wrong. Nope. He crawls under the table and continues the classy act of screaming and crying (while throwing pencils at me). The nanny is smart and stays out of the whole mess.


Finally mom comes home and I tell her what happened. By this point, my nose is pretty red and swollen. She barely reacts and does nothing to discipline Harry. Even better, she indulges Harry by turning on the cursed tv and coddles him. When the dad comes home, same deal. No reprimands, no apologies, nothing. I understand that parents these days avoid discipline for fear of upsetting their precious babies. But I’m pretty sure that children should be punished for PHYSICALLY ATTACKING STRANGERS.


Anyway, now I’m home with an ice pack to my face. I told the agency about what happened (while trying to be as professional and diplomatic as possible), and they cut the family from the client list. My nose is still swollen but there seems to be no permanent damages (fingers crossed).


Sorry about the poor grammar/incoherence/etc. I'm just fuming mad right now and I have to get everything off my chest at once.

I need help with a parent issue.,43,0,60,http://www.reddit.com/r/Teachers/comments/15z62k/first_year_teacher_here_i_need_help_with_a_parent/,"I recently changed some of my policies for my middle school band and choir kiddos.  I made sure to send home a note for parents and students to sign and turn in.  On one of the notes a parent had written me this message:

""I hope you are doing your part by learning how to select appropriate arrangements that are possible for young people to be able to successfully learn and master.  The Christmas programs were an embarassament to you personally and professionally.""

Now, I'm a first year teacher and maybe my concerts could have gone better but they were definitely not that bad.  She is also the type of parent that is involved in EVERYTHING even if her kids aren't involved in that activity or issue.  This is a very small, rural 1A school in the middle of Kansas so if I make too big of a stink it will of course go around.  

Anyways, my principal thinks I should speak up to her since this isn't the first time she has given me trouble, and I agree.  Normally I would ignore this but she just won't give up on me and at this point it is turning into bullying.  I need to stop this before it goes any further.  What should I say when I talk with her?  I don't want to send an email because to me that is a little ""cowardly"" if you will.  I want to actually call her and talk to her but still be professional.

Edit: formatting

Edit:  I am the only music teacher for the whole school (grades 1-12).

*UPDATE* : So I decided to call the parent and set up a meeting.  Not 15 minutes later she emails the counselor asking what the fine arts requirements were for freshmen (her 9th grade son is in band).  She wants to pull him out of my class even though her son loves being in band (the counselor asked the kid herself).

1367522292.0,41,self.Teachers,1dki1o,International Teaching: How to do it and why it is amazing.,49,8,27,http://www.reddit.com/r/Teachers/comments/1dki1o/international_teaching_how_to_do_it_and_why_it_is/,"Hi Reddit. This is my first post and probably my last, but I wanted to give educators who love to teach but have been screwed over by the educational system in the United States an opportunity to do what they love.

Here is some background on my story. I graduated with a degree in History Education in December of 2009. I had a 3.97 GPA, was the president of the History Honors Society, presented professional papers at historical conferences and had teaching internships on Lakota Indian Reservations, England, Scotland, North Ireland and Greece. I did everything I could in college to make myself marketable because I knew finding a teaching job for history (or most other subjects besides math) would be very difficult. Unfortunately, it was not enough. For two years I jumped around school coming in mid-year to cover a teacher for a few months and never considered for a full time teaching position. The first time was because of budget cuts, the second was due to nepotism and the third was because I could not compete with much more experienced teachers who wanted to same jobs I did. I was frustrated and angry that I could not do what I loved to do without constantly being fearful of where or how long I would be working. I explained my frustrations to a friend at the gym who told me about International Teaching. Honestly I had never heard of it, but took her advice and was offered a job in Costa Rica. It was the best decision of my life. 

I wanted to let teachers who have been struggling to find jobs that there are schools that will give you the opportunity to do what you love, and will give you a much better package than schools in the United States. First, here are a few of the larger companies that serve as a third party between teachers and International Schools:

1) [Search Associates](http://www.searchassociates.com) -This is the company I would recommend. You have your own recruiter for your area and they try very hard to help you find a position. However the cost to join is about $250, but in my opinion it is well worth it. The $250 also covers the cost for a job-fair.

2) [COIS](http://www.cois.org/) -This is a free company that is well known and has job fairs all over the world, but is a bit more like a meat-market
*There are a few more, but these are by far the best in my opinion*

So, here is how you get into International Teaching:

1) Sign up with one of the third party companies above. This may take a few days, depending on what they need you to provide (recommendations etc.).

2) Sign up for a teaching fair. These will be from the months of January to June and will be all over the world. For example, Search-Associates have fair in London, Toronto, Bangkok, Hong Kong, South Africa and Maryland to name a few. The schools that will be attending will be listed on the site. The fairs last for 3 days (Friday, Saturday, Sunday). Book your plane ticket and hotel reservation (preferable the same hotel the job-fair will be at).

AND/OR

Look at the school the company has connections with. Pick a country or region of the world you want to go to and email the school of your intentions (regardless if they have vacancies or not). This will allow you to network and may get you an interview for a position even if no vacancies are posted (I was offered a job in Kuwait through this method).

3) Go to the fair. While going to the teaching fair make sure you have numerous copies of your resume, sample lesson plans and a list of your top schools. Make sure you are dressed very professionally and get in line for your top schools first. The representatives of the school will speak with you for a few minutes, take your resume and say thank you. If they like you they will contact you for an interview. Depending on the school there may be more than one interview. By the end of the weekend a majority of people will either have accepted a job or will be offered one in the next week or two.

If this does not happen continue to email schools. My first international teaching position was offered to be in mid July, so it is never too late. The work visa process is a bitch, but the schools walk you through it very well.

Here are the benefit packages all International School will give you:
-Health Insurance
-Free transportation to and from your point of origin in the summer
-Free furnished housing (depending on the school, some are one bedroom 1 bath, some are 3 bedroom 3 bath)

Some school will offer:
-Stipends for graduate degrees
-Transportation for shopping, museums and activities
-Tax free salaries
-Housing and insurance for a spouse and dependents

The salaries for international school are varied but here are generally the salary trends:

-Latin America will pay between $17,000-$35,000.

-The Middle East will pay between $35,000-$60,000.

-African Countries will pay between $20,000-$40,000.

-European Countries will pay between $30,000-$90,000. The best paying school are in Germany, Switzerland and Austria.

-Asia schools will pay between $30,000-$90,000. The best paying schools are in Thailand and China.

The best part is that these schools do not have unions, are not driven by test results and allow you much more freedom than public schools in the United States. After getting your foot in the door you can go anywhere and save much more money than in the United States. I know it may be scary to leave everything you know and experience a whole new world, but anyone can do this. It does not matter if you are single or married, kids or no kids, secondary or elementary, young or old, anyone can do this. 

I will try to answer any relevant questions you have. I hope this post can help someone who is frustrated with the educational system in the United States to find a fulfilling, well paying and exciting teaching position.

That would be $19.50 a day (7:45 to……… 3:00 PM with 45 min. off for lunch and plan– that equals 6 1/2 hours). Each parent should pay $19.50 a day for these teachers to baby-sit their children. Now how many students do they teach in a day…maybe 30? So that’s $19.50 x 30 = $585.00 a day. However, remember they only work 180 days a year!!! I am not going to pay them for any vacations.

LET’S SEE…That’s $585 X 180= $105,300 per year. (Hold on! My calculator needs new batteries). What about those special education teachers and the ones with Master’s degrees? Well, we could pay them minimum wage ($7.75), and just to be fair, round it off to $8.00 an hour. That would be $8 X 6 1/2 hours X 30 children X 180 days = $280,800 per year. Wait a minute — there’s something wrong here! The average teacher’s salary (nation wide) is $50,000. $50,000/180 days = $277.77/per day/30 students=$9.25/6.5 hours = $1.42 per hour per student–a very inexpensive baby-sitter and they even EDUCATE your kids!

I have a student who graduated in 2012 who I became somewhat close to. He has a mild cognitive disability and was in my inclusion English class. I helped tutor him on his tests and whatnot, and would give him advice on how to deal with his sorta overbearing mom. He's a great kid, never got in trouble in class, always did his work, just very sweet. 

When he graduated, he added me on Facebook. I usually accept former students who ask, so I didn't think anything of it. Now, over a year later, every few weeks he sends me a Facebook message asking if he can meet me at school or if I can come visit him at his job. He's visited me at school probably 7 or 8 times over the past year, and chatted with me on Facebook probably every 2 weeks. It's so often that I struggle to think of things to talk about with him since nothing really seems to be new in his life. Most students I've become close to check in once in a while, but this student does it, I think, more than necessary. He also has gone through my old pictures and ""liked"" them. I don't have anything inappropriate on there, so I have nothing to hide, but I felt pretty weird about that.

I think he has had a hard time adjusting to life after high school. He's had a hard time making friends in community college and misses the personal attention he got from his high school teachers. I'm also young and relatively attractive, and I get the feeling he has a crush on me. This should go without saying, but I'm really not into that at all.

I sense that this kid doesn't have a lot of people to talk to, and I want to continue to be a positive figure in his life. I definitely don't want to hurt his feelings, but I don't want to give him the wrong idea. He's never said or done anything directly inappropriate, but because of his disability I think his social skills may not be the best. He's a great kid, but he's getting a little too close for comfort.

* You are not measured entirely by the knowledge, experience, and wisdom you have worked so hard to accumulate in your life and career. Instead, the test scores of your students and the impressions you make on your colleagues are the measure of your value.
* The people at the very top making decisions about your profession, your daily work, and the well-being of your students have no training in teaching or education. You will be evaluated by elected officials, and your principal has no power to advocate for you beyond his/her good word.
* Your work environment is predetermined by the social and economic conditions of your community, not the quality of your school's leadership. If you work in a community that is impoverished, your work environment will reflect that, and the attitudes and struggles you encounter with your students will reflect it as well.
* You may encounter some very outspoken parents that believe you are part of a system out to enslave their children because people with no experience in teaching are telling them this is happening. The media these parents watch doesn't understand what your job is, because these ""news"" organizations no longer report the news - they sensationalize events to make them sound like news when they're anything but news. 
* You may never know what it's like to live in any way other than from paycheck to paycheck. Even worse, the US Dollar is in crisis, so what you're earning may very likely be below the poverty line in the next few years. Meanwhile, since you're not measured by what you know or can do, your only hope may be winning that lottery of students that come into your classroom, score well on exams, and earn you a big bonus check. Talk about dangling a carrot... 
* Your Government is selling the education system to the huge corporations of the private sector in the form of charter schools and vouchers. The protections afforded to Teachers through labor unions are pretty much over, as they probably should be. But the Government is completely uninformed on just how important some of those protections are to the education system and are doing absolutely nothing to advocate for teachers or protect education itself. 

A Most-Important Edit:

* Teaching, as a ""profession"", is unlike any legitimate profession in the country. The Medical and Legal professions are a stark contrast to the joke that bureaucracy makes of our otherwise noble field. In medicine, doctors make medical decisions and supervisors of doctors cannot, in most cases at least, make medical decisions without a medical license; this is unethical, and the profession has influence over this circumstance. Attorneys technically cannot be supervised in their work by anyone who is not also an attorney; this is unethical, and the profession has influence over this circumstance. The US teaching profession is afforded no such influence. Our ""professional organization"" is the state government, mostly. The US Department of Education doesn't involve itself in local matters, nor should it. But the profession necessarily needs a body of experienced, professional educators in every state that can audit the classroom... not bureaucrats or consultants lacking ANY credentials in education. So, I guess the bad news is that we call it a profession, but no one seems to treat it like one... except teachers. 

But you're still here, you're hopefully still teaching, and for that selfless act, I'm happy to stand with you as a teacher. I may not be the most knowledgeable, experienced, or wisest teacher among you. But I'll be with you here in the US for as long as I can be.",,False,,t5_2qqcs,1361665172.0,,,True,t3_19366e,http://www.reddit.com/r/Teachers/comments/19366e/our_most_knowledgeable_experienced_and_wisest/,

We then give those bold enough to participate an ice cream sandwich toward the end of the year. 

Also, we introduce the challenge with one of these videos:

He walked around the class trying to get everyone to focus and do their work. Poor guy. They wouldn’t listen, of course.

While they were filling out a survey I got on my laptop and was closing windows when all of a sudden a porn pop up opened and the images were visible to one of the students. I immediately closed it hoping that he did not see it but he made an ""ew"" comment and I said ""I'm so sorry, my computer has this virus that gives me these pop ups and I need to get it fixed."" He seemed whatever about it and we went on to talk about the real issues at hand and then I took them back to class and they seemed fine..

I'm in my office right now. Freaking out. What should I do? Do I call my boss and tell her I had a weird experience with this? I'm in silent panic mode. Nothing like this has ever happened and this is literally a worst nightmare (As in I've had terrors about this kind of thing happening before) coming true.

Update: Ok. I told my boss. She just happened to be stopping by the school to check up on some cases with some other students. She was very understanding and cool about it. We both went to the principle (a fundamental christian may I add) and talked to him about it. The best thing was definitely to speak up about it as fast as I did. He said if any of the parents spoke to him about it then he would take care of it. I don't really know what taking care of it means but I do feel a bit better about it now. Luckily we have spring break starting tomorrow and I can go meditate or something. The principle seemed a whole lot more comfortable with the situation than I had felt about it so hopefully it is something smaller than I'm making it out to be.

Should I request another adult in the room? How should I structure my class differently? Should I create a general music class during chorus for students that don't want to sing? (I've done this in the past with smaller classes of 50. It is just hard to keep them on task when I am busy teaching.)

I will know my subject. I will know my kids. I don't care that it's my first year, it might as well be my last. I will pour my passion into my lessons. I will spark excitement about learning. I will play as often as we can handle. I will find ways to or, more likely, since I enjoy creating, design my days to be nothing short of interesting.

I will be fair, and let them know that fair doesn't mean equal. I will be tough with my expectations, but warm with my approach. I will respect their differences in personality, and I will make sure they respect me. I will constantly point out the good they do. If I can't find anything good, I will find something for that student to do, so that s/he will do good. I'm going to laugh, a lot, but of course only when appropriate. I'm going to do what is right, despite any pleas.

I am intelligent and I am capable, I have worked so hard to get where I am, and I will only continue to work hard to get where I want to be. I will not be let down by anything other than my own work ethic. When I pour love into my job, my job will love me.

I am a powerful person. I will directly and positively influence the lives of hundreds of students over the course of my career. I will inspire them to believe in their own powers, and their power to learn, and do, whatever it is that they truly desire.

Because, I truly desire to be the best teacher there ever was. And when my kids see that I teach out of my love for them, and for knowledge, then I know I have achieved my goal.

Aw man, sucks to be you…”

Now the completely unintentional troll. I teach World History. I do my lesson plans a month in advance (I am a coach for a spring extra-curricular activity.

- Don't collect anything until you are done. Collecting materials is a signal to your students that class is over.
- EYE CONTACT.
- Shouting to be heard above them just makes them shout to be heard above you. Attentive silence is so much more effective. Add eye contact for best results.
- It's ok to use humor. It's ok to use sarcasm. It's not ok to be mean.
- Condescention builds resentment. 
- A loud classroom is not necessarily a bad classroom. Use your authority to channel that noise into something constructive.
- Don't make threats unless you plan on following through.
- Avoid writing referrals, calling parents, getting the dean/AP/principal involved, unless it's gotten to the point where that is necessary. Deal with problems IN THE CLASSROOM. If you defer your disciplinary authority to others then you will be treated accordingly.

1331082999.0,27,self.Teachers,qkzza,Hopefully this is the place for this: I've decided to quit teaching.,34,7,26,http://www.reddit.com/r/Teachers/comments/qkzza/hopefully_this_is_the_place_for_this_ive_decided/,"I'll be the first to admit I'm not sure what I hope to achieve by writing this. I just can't deal with it anymore and I thought there might be others with similiar experiences. Or maybe I just need to bitch.

I've been teaching for almost seven years. I cut my teeth as a graduate teaching assistant teaching a few sections of freshman speech, spent a year at the same school as a full-time instructor while teaching adjunct at another nearby college, then ended up at a fairly small university as a full-time instructor. A majority of my students over these years have been freshmen right out of high school, although there have been a number of exceptions. Since it is a speech class, one of the core requirements for all state universities here, an overwhelming majority of my students do not want to be in this class at all.

So yes, I understand that there are factors here that would be trying for anyone. I'm also out of my principal area of study and don't really feel like I belong in my department. I've kept going with my current job because I needed the money, and because I assumed that eventually, I'd go back to college, earn a terminal degree, and become a full professor in a field I'm more passionate about.

But something happened a year ago. I realized that I just don't have the patience for this. It's not the students who struggle, or the students who are afraid to speak in front of the class, or the students who don't speak English as a native language. They do present their share of challenges, but they are challenges I can handle. I have the patience for them. Even the students who are just horribly irresponsible who don't adequately complete assignments--assuming they complete them at all--don't bother me *that* much. These are all hazards of the job that I've learned to expect.

It's the entitled students that drive me nuts. The ones who don't complete the assignments or do a very poor job of it, and blame *me* for their own inadequacies, or the ones that attempt to *beat the assignment itself* instead of completing it. Even the students who are very sweet but nearly break down into tears when they realize they've screwed up are driving me crazy. I'm tired of the arguments, and the broken hearts, and the general feeling that I've got to be the bad guy so frequently.

I'm tired of working my ass off on improving my course to make the material and requirements more clear, only to find out none of it works at all because the students don't do their part and read it or pay attention when it's presented or demonstrated. I'm tired of spending a half hour writing out two pages of explanation for a single assignment only to have students come to my office, already hostile because they got a low grade, and tell me that they didn't even bother to read the justification I spent that time writing.

I'm tired of society treating teachers, all teachers, like incompetent villains who are on a power trip. I'm tired of seeing the word *education* being written in quotation marks whenever people complain about any sort of school system. I'm tired of hearing parents blaming teachers for the failures of their kids (I get this on facebook, mostly). I'm tired of hearing about how teachers are slackers who don't deserve their already meager salary and benefits.

I can't deal with this shit anymore. I got into this career because I care about education. I still care about education. But I don't have the patience to deal with the inattentive, entitled students who come from parents who actually seem to encourage this attitude. Last year everything came to a head for me, and I've been in a very deep depression since then. I'm seeking help for the depression, but...it's just become apparent that I can't continue being an educator anymore.

Sorry for the long post. In closing, I just want to say that my experience has increased my respect for educators, especially those who struggle with these types of problems and still manage to carry on and devote your lives to this work. In a way, I feel like I've let the rest of the teachers in this world down by giving up, but I guess we're not all cut out for this job.

EDIT: Thanks to everyone for your kind words and support. For those who are curious, the decision was made to begin the slow process toward independent business ownership instead of continuing to teach as a full-time career. It's an old dream that I've spent a long time avoiding because of the risk involved, but given the recent struggles and developments, my wife and I decided this was the best path to take at this point.",,False,,t5_2qqcs,True,,,True,t3_qkzza,http://www.reddit.com/r/Teachers/comments/qkzza/hopefully_this_is_the_place_for_this_ive_decided/,

I'm just trying to gauge interest at the moment.

My plan is to set up a small computer and projector in a classroom in rural areas of South Africa where children have extremely limited access to good quality teachers.

Because of severe bandwidth limitations, your teaching implements would be quite spartan, unfortunately. I am working on software that will allow 2-way voice communication, along with a virtual blackboard to allow the teacher to scribble and illustrate, and have it projected for the students in real-time.

With this in mind, I have a few questions.  


1. Do you think it would be worth delivering a lesson if the children don't have access to anything but your voice and your blackboard? That means no textbook, no internet, no videos etc.  
2. Do you think that teachers would donate their time towards this? I am acutely aware that everybody's time is precious so I please be honest.  


A friend of mine runs the Kenton Youth Centre, part of the [Kariega Project](http://kariegaproject.weebly.com/) and that's where I hope to set up the first class.

It's a typical urban school and they have trouble finding teachers who will stay. It has been a hard transition for the kids because the school had them in 3 large classes. I was hired to make class sizes smaller. This means I'm coming in halfway through the year and making everything change.

Besides the obvious classroom management issues I'm working through (students shouting out, disrespect, testing me, etc), I'm also dealing with lots of sex notes I keep finding 3 of my kids writing. I have followed the school's procedure of sending the notes to the office, keeping a record of the offense, and sending the notes home, but I feel like something else might need to be done.

These notes are more than the typical ""Do you like me? Check yes or no."" I'll post a few that are pretty typical:

* ""Will you have sex with me? Check yes or no.""
* ""I want to stick my dick in your ass""
* ""When can I fuck you hard?""

I have been catching the note writing more frequently as I find out how they try to hide it. I realize children are curious about the human body and relations with each other.

Or Comic Sans for dyslexia?       

I mean academic peer reviewed research (as opposed to marketing material). It seems like a fairly trivial thing to test, fairly cheap, and fairly quick but yet the research seems somewhere between lacking to completely non-existent.    

There was some research done on the Dyslexie font and the conclusion was:     

&gt; A student thesis by Renske de Leeuw of the University of Twente found Dyslexie **had no effect on reading speed but reduced some reading errors while increasing others.** Tests compared text set in Dyslexie with text set in Arial. Sample size was 43 (21 dyslexic readers, 22 'normal' readers) - low in statistical terms. The study's conclusion states that further research needs to be done. [further](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dyslexie#Research)      

According to [this](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-19734341) BBC article no scientific research has been done on OpenDyslexic and it was created by an app designer -- not someone with any experience in the field.     

As someone who ""suffers"" from Dyslexia myself and who was at a fairly progressive school who would try out the latest research on us, I have really seen so much bullshit and nonsense in the Dyslexia space, it feels like the snake oil salesman are lined up to sell you a solution -- special pens, pen holders, coloured filters, special paper, fonts, software, exercises (seriously), etc.        

I get that dyslexia has a massive negative impact on people's learning experiences, but requiring actual scientific research on ""cures"" is the very least we should require before deploying it. Your intuition or ""feelings"" are not *as good as* the real thing.    

PS - Yes, a million people who suffer from dyslexia will now descend on this thread and say ""I find the font easier to read!!! You don't need scientific research, my anecdote is good enough!""    
PPS - I actually don't find the font easier to read, and it doesn't improve my comprehension. But, again, this is just a single anecdote, and should not form your opinion (or mine!).

There have been a few issues and I'm not sure if I'm setting the bar too high, and he's not giving me a lot of feedback. Help?",35,8,66,http://www.reddit.com/r/Teachers/comments/19ves7/i_have_a_student_teacher_and_i_have_high/,"Thanks for reading, all! I am a high school English teacher who is mentoring a student teacher for the first time.  The classes I have given him free reign over (we are reading a novel, he is planning and grading exclusively) have been some challenging classes in that they involve many students with IEPs. I have very high expectations for him because I want my students to be learning. That said, I've noticed a few issues and I'm not sure if I'm being too harsh and if these things are par for the course with student teachers. I don't want them to be happening, but I wonder if I should be more patient and cut him a little slack.

1. There isn't much of a clear established objective for each lesson. I've asked him to write objectives on the board for me to know what the students should have gotten out of the lesson. The one he has written has been somewhat vague and hasn't changed in 2 weeks. I also spoke with him about having more of a clear agenda on the board for the day for me and for the students, and that improved (instead of ""Read &lt;book title&gt;"" it's ""Read &lt;book title&gt; pp. 66-71"", etc) but I don't feel like he really knows what he wants the students to get out of the lesson each day. When I have asked he is hesitant with an answer. He went to his university supervisor and said that he is very stressed out and has no idea how to plan a novel, but I've gone over the concept of objectives with him before and given him ideas of how I structure the class period every day when we are reading a novel. Some of that, he's taken, but not all of it.

2. The class is somewhat disorganized and he isn't asserting his authority the best that he could. He tells students how they should behave but doesn't give consequences for if they do not behave this way. The students seem to like him, but he's not very good at getting them to listen and do what he wants. I've spoken to him about putting his foot down and following through with consequences, but this has only improved slightly. For example, one student moved from his assigned seat today to a seat by his friends. He went and asked him to move back, but the student didn't, and there did not seem to be a consequence for not following instructions. He does not seem to be a very authoritative person, though he tries, he seems somewhat timid with the students when it comes to redirecting them. He is fine talking to them about their interests, etc., but if they are not behaving he seems almost scared to approach them.

3. I don't think some of the grades he is giving the students reflect their performance. I noticed he gave most students As or Bs on the essay he graded, but having read their writing myself, I think they've historically performed more in the C range. Since this is a major assignment for the semester, I want their grades to accurately reflect their ability to write at grade level.

I think he is concerned too much with the students liking him and this translates to shaky classroom management. He is afraid that the students will not like him. When I bring these issues up with him he gets somewhat defensive. I think I try to keep it positive, but he understandably takes it personally when I point out weaknesses. He told his supervisor that I push him, but I'm worried I'm expecting too much. I'm in the room most of the time (school rules and they seem to behave better when I am) and it is very difficult for me to let things slide; however, I am trying to tell myself that he needs to make his own mistakes. I don't think he is willing to be 100% honest with me about my criticism for obvious reasons, so do you think I am being reasonable? We have two different personality types, so it's difficult for me to compare his experience to my own - I was always asking how I could improve when I was student teaching and he doesn't often do so. There are multiple things each lesson that I think should be improved, but I'm not sure if I should let some of it slide.

I feel most teachers can commiserate with having those select students who, no matter what you do, never come to class with their work done. However, I also know that teachers are nothing if not resourceful folk, so, I'm asking you all: what are your tricks and tips for making sure students do their work? Or maybe you come from a school with a no homework policy and want to share the pros and cons. 

Homework completion has been on my mind a lot lately because I'm starting in a district where I know many students will not be getting much support at home (many of our parents work multiple jobs). This is a factor which I know contributes to a decline in homework completion. I have an idea of what I might want to do, so maybe you can help me decide if it's a good idea or help me pick apart potential flaws before I implement anything (by the way, I teach 7th grade math):

Students are given a packet every Monday with their homework for the week (all content created by me, mostly a couple more open-ended problems rather than tightly packed practice worksheets), all packets must be put into homework section of 3-ring math binder by Friday. If students do not complete homework packet, they must fill out the Missing Assignment Tracker in homework section of binder, which asks for a brief explanation of why they did not complete their homework and will be shown as evidence to parents if homework completion is a continued problem. The reason I think this might be a good idea is that it gives students multiple days to complete the homework. Many of my students help out at home, and so it may be that they just didn't have the time on Tuesday night to finish the assignment due Wednesday. Also, I feel that remembering to turn in one packet every Friday is far easier than keeping track of which days certain things are due. I plan to keep the packets more general, based off the wider standards rather than a task that must necessarily follow the classroom activity, just in case students decide to work ahead in the packet. 

What does everyone think of this idea? Has anyone else done something similar and can help me catch some of the flaws before I bring it into the classroom? Do you think that assigning only one packet per week dampens high expectations and that students ought to be assigned more homework? Let me know what you think!

He's been struggling for a while, and I try to support and give advice and be positive, but lately things have just been so tough that I am dreading going back to school after Spring Break.

I thought going in that I might have difficulty giving over my classes to someone else, and that's been true. Especially since he isn't doing the best job teaching the class. I am required to stay in the room while he teaches and it's so hard seeing him not follow the advice I have given him and having the students be confused on what to do. I think I'd feel a lot better about it if he had more confidence and was able to give clear directions and be prepared and organized.

He also doesn't keep me in the loop on what's going on. I rarely know what he is doing each day with his classes ahead of time unless I specifically ask. I'm not sure if I should, but I don't feel right walking in to observe/help and not really knowing what is going on. He is a shy person (in contrast to me, I'm very outgoing) and rarely approaches me about anything, to the point where I feel like I have to tell him everything. For example, the other day almost all the students were sitting wherever they wanted and not following the seating chart, and he didn't even really seem to notice or be proactive with the situation until I mentioned it to him.

Before break started, he gave an assessment on the unit he taught that more than half the class got a D or F on. This wasn't the case with other teachers who gave the same test. I had no idea this happened until I went to put in grades on the weekend and saw it. I brought it up to him via email (we had been talking about our plans after break) and he seemed to brush it off saying that he followed the rubric. My evaluation for this year is tied to my student data, and if this is the case, I am really worried about whether this will reflect on me. I told him he should have let me know about this, but he hasn't said anything back, which makes me think I made a big deal out of something that shouldn't be. Not to mention, the same day, he said he was coming in to enter grades when I would be there to let him in, and then texted saying he would be there an hour after I said I was going to leave.

I am really not looking forward to going back to work. I feel like it's more work than anything to have someone else teaching your classes. I am losing motivation in trying to be positive, too. I had been having a great year, and now I am just tired and annoyed a lot of the time. I'm even having bad dreams about it. I feel like I'm being a bitch about the whole situation, but I also feel like I've had these expectations and few of them have really been met. It's been hard to even enjoy my Spring Break.

I realize I may be somewhat harsh about all of this. I just kind of want the experience to be over so I can just worry about myself. :(

While I was gone, I postponed a test I was originally going to give Monday to make sure I'd be there to answer students' questions since it's the first test we've had and covers a lot of material. Schools are closed today. That means the test will have to be postponed until tomorrow, which means I've lost another instructional day. The writing SOL is on March 19th and 20th. I've been so busy teaching the students how to organize their thinking (arguably the most important aspect of writing) that I have ignored the technology component of the test (they're all online as of this year), so that will have to be explicitly taught, which will take at least another day. That leaves 13 instructional days left to teach them to hone their sense of voice/style in their writing and cover three years worth of usage/grammar that they have either forgotten at this point or have never learned. During those instructional days, I will also be distracted by academic coaching and my duties as the yearbook adviser. We publish March 18th, the day before the test. 

My students are sweet but unmotivated. Most of them have spent their lives hovering just above or below the poverty line. These are kids who work jobs to make ends meet, or spend their time taking care of siblings and family members while their parents are working. Some of them come to me so numbed by a life of dysfunction and institutionalized failure that the only relief they can find is through drugs and alcohol. Most have a vague notion that education is important. They know, through rote memorization, that you need a diploma to get a job. Some even grasp that a bachelor's degree has become the new standard for most employment. But for the majority of them, school is something you simply get through. If you show up and do the ""work"", you will pass. But the new English standards demand more than a passive understanding of subject matter. They are, arguably, the best standards we've had in the sense that they require students to actually understand how to read and write. These standards will be tested using an assessment which include items that are not multiple choice. Even the multiple choice items will be more rigorous. They will require students to use critical thinking to unpack the meaning of the question before they can attempt to answer it. Many will assess two or more standards at a time. My current students have spent their entire educational life acclimating to the old standards. They are used to fill in the blank notes and multiple choice everything. They are happiest taking down notes in silence while someone at the front of the room talks and talks about they know not what. Fed on a steady diet of images from the time they possess the ability to speak, their minds are simultaneously over-stimulated and underfed. When asked to explain an opinion, they stare at you blankly. For them, the opinion is the evidence, and vice versa. The result of over a decade of high stakes testing is a generation who has been taught to answer, not to think. 

The speaker at the conference yesterday compared implementing the new standards to building a plane while you're flying it. I think she hit the nail on the head, but the questions remain: Who in their right mind would try to fly a plane before it's built? And who in God's name would fill it with children?

I saw a great idea on here to curb phone issues by using a plastic pocket shoe organizer to have kids put their phones in before class. I see this going poorly even if making it part of the grade, however, since most kids have smart phones and the micro USB charger is universal I'm thinking of making the pockets charging stations by soldering together USB cables (they're less than $1 on monoprice.) If I offer the kids the ability to charge their phone I think they'll be more inclined to part with it for 42 minutes. I always had kids using my charger previously so this may work. If they have a phone with a different connector then I would let them use it on the condition that they plug it in before homeroom starts and pick it up after last period.

Have any of you tried having kids surrender their phones at the door like this? Did it work? Do you think my charging station idea may work?

* I'm a male student teacher
* I've primarily interned in 5th grade, except for one semester where I interned in 1st grade (i MUCH rather work with the older kids)
* I love working with kids
* I've thoroughly enjoyed my time as a student teacher 
* I'm getting my degree in Elementary Education and will be certified for K-6 general education

So, here's my story: I originally wanted to teach art, but figured a degree certified for K-6 would be the wiser choice (looking back, I do wish I followed my passion instead of taking the ""safe"" route). Throughout the past two years, I've had reservations about continuing as a general ed elementary teacher in public schools. Suffice it to say, I DO NOT WANT to be a teacher at this point. I loved my time as a student teacher and love the kids in my 5th grade class. I often get those ""warm and fuzzies"" that make me think this job is worth it, but ultimately I've decided that those feeling aren't enough to make all the extra bullshit worth it. 

I love teaching the kids and them having ""ah-ha"" moments as well as connecting to them and being a positive role model. I LOVE that part of the job. 

What I HATE is the extensive planning, adhering to whatever crazy principle rule is next, standard after crazy standard, and all the extra bullshit (ie - committees, dealing with parents, type-a bitches surrounding me, etc etc). 

It's weird because I knew about all of this shit when I started the teaching program, but figured I'd find my niche and do my thing, but like I said before, I just know this isn't for me. If it comes down to it, and a teaching position is the only thing available, i'll take it over a fast-food career, but if I can help it at all, I want to avoid the general teaching position (especially public schools) at all costs. 

SO, my question to you all: What route could I go? Is being a tutor an easily-attained career and is it successful in the long run? Are there related careers where I can work with children to make a difference that will give me benefits and a steady pay? I really don't care about the money, as long as I can pay my bills (read: at least 25-30k a year is fine....really it is). So, I was just wondering if anyone here had the same feelings at the end of their student teaching and what did you do. Any information would be greatly appreciated. 

TL;DR - I'm done student teaching and don't want to be a general education teacher. What other options do I have?

RULE ONE: Find a place you trust, and then try trusting it for awhile.

RULE TWO: General duties of a student — pull everything out of your teacher; pull everything out of your fellow students.

RULE THREE: General duties of a teacher — pull everything out of your students.

RULE FOUR: Consider everything an experiment.

RULE FIVE: Be self-disciplined — this means finding someone wise or smart and choosing to follow them. To be disciplined is to follow in a good way. To be self-disciplined is to follow in a better way.

RULE SIX: Nothing is a mistake. There’s no win and no fail, there’s only make.

RULE SEVEN: The only rule is work. If you work it will lead to something. It’s the people who do all of the work all of the time who eventually catch on to things.

RULE EIGHT: Don’t try to create and analyze at the same time. They’re different processes.

RULE NINE: Be happy whenever you can manage it. Enjoy yourself. It’s lighter than you think.

RULE TEN: “We’re breaking all the rules. Even our own rules. And how do we do that? By leaving plenty of room for X quantities.” (John Cage)

So I am in the middle of Julius Caesar, Brutus is trying to decide whether to join the conspiracy, when I hear a zzzzzz----POP!--the lights flicker, and that kid falls out of his chair onto the ground. He got up, disoriented, holding a bent paper clip in his hand. 

He had put that paper clip in the electrical socket to ""see what would happen."" Let me remind you: tenth grade. 

So what stories do you have? Principals running down the hall like Ed Rooney from Ferris Bueller? (I've seen that). Kids getting caught having sex on a questionably upholstered theater prop couch? (not me, but I heard about it).

I'm still grading.

We had a major assessment that I paired with the Odyssey, where they were supposed to create a short epic tale using their own imaginations and various elements that we've studied from the epic poem. I organized the assignment in pieces so that it would be easy to keep up with if you stayed with me and put forth the time in class to be working on it. I took three days in the computer lab for typing since I wanted it to be typed, and since a number of students don't own computers, I gave them the option to turn in a final draft handwritten in blue or black ink.

I spent over half of the six weeks working on it with them, and kids just didn't turn it in. I even made the late penalty less discouraging, by instead chopping off 30 points for being late, just ten points per school day.

I'm just really disappointed. I feel like I did everything for these kids to be successful. We have to write a research paper next, and I feel like if they aren't going to be able to do a fun creative piece, then how are they going to be able to do something that actually requires some serious attention and effort, not a subjective assignment where they are just flying by the seats of their creativity.

**Edit:** I just wanted to say for the record that I'm not leaving because of the kids at all. I'm leaving because of lack of support and being constantly talked down to by administration. The school is disorganized and is changing what they want teachers to be doing nearly every day. I don't have to put up with this.

Since posting and getting some new ideas, I've been trying them and I have good portions to almost every day. The kids think I'm mean (which is good, I'd rather be mean than their friend), but work is getting done and the class is closer to in control. It's still far from manageable, but I can see some progress each day.

I have also finally heard back about some extra support! I will be meeting with someone Monday for in class behavior support. I really need it and am more than happy to have it.

I grew up in a Montessori schooling environment, so I learned most of my math very, very early (all of arithmetic in kindergarten, fractions in first grade, root-finding algorithms in 2nd-3rd, just to get an idea). I grew into math competitions, and I'm a math undergrad right now. Most of my tutoring experience has been at the high-school level, where I can freshly recall most of the material and a quick read reminds me of what the important ideas to convey are.

But I've got a recent case that's giving me trouble. I got convinced to tutor a family friend's struggling 11 year old. Really bright kid, can't handle math, they told me. I've spent about six months with her, and her grades have gone from 50s to mid-70s. She has no problems with concepts and problem solving, but (let's not mince words) she absolutely cannot do arithmetic that I'd expect even a kindergarten child to breeze through. Manipulating single-digit numbers, being able to break down common numbers (recognizing that 100 = 2x50 = 4x25 = 5x20 = 10x10, for example), sanity-checking answers (multiplying something by 5 should give you an answer ending in 0 or 5), etc.

I'm having a very, very, *very* hard time trying to figure out how to teach basic arithmetic all over again- because it's just something that I do so subconsciously now, and worse, I don't remember how I myself learned it!

**My question is**, how do I convey these concepts which I've forgotten how to explain? How can I relearn how to teach simple things like this?

There, I said it. It’s out in the open now. I’ve been stalking people like you for months now, even going so far as to move in with a teacher so I can pick at her brain whenever I want (it’s my mother, don’t get scared). I drive people crazy talking about CCSSI, differentiated instruction, and it’s gotten to the point that I think we need to talk…

I was once going to join your ranks. My mother is a teacher. My grandmother was a teacher (in a one room school no less). I know what it takes to be a great teacher and that’s why I decided I wasn’t cut out for it! Unfortunately, many of my friends didn’t have that generational advantage and continued on only to find out that the job wasn’t what they were expecting at all. That’s when I realized there is a real disconnect in many teaching courses between what is taught, how it’s taught, and what the career actually entails. I couldn’t find any books talking about Average Jane and Joe teacher. Loads of Chicken Soup and inner-city-kids-turned-Rhodes-scholar inspirational books, but nothing that talked about the everyday teachers that I grew up around. 

So, I’m writing that book and I’d love to talk to you. There are so many aspects to your job that people just aren’t aware of and need to be. Some of the main topics I’m covering are:

* 
Parents – sometimes a blessing, sometimes a curse. Parents play a huge part in a child’s education whether helping or hindering. Such parents include, The Hoverparent, The Invisible Mom/Dad, The Former Student, The Know-it-all, The Colleague/Parent Hybrid, and many more!

* 
Students – Learning disabilities, behavioral problems, social development, oh my! Teaching isn’t as simple as reading from a book and correcting pop quizzes. How do you get a kid to focus on fractions when his parents refuse to medicate his ADD or the one who can’t stop masturbating? What about the girl who was up all night in the car with her mother, fleeing from an abusive step-dad until school the next day (true story)? 

* 
Society – Politicians use your profession as one of their major talking points, but does anyone ever ask your opinion? What standards are you held to (perhaps that you didn’t anticipate) now that you are an educator? 

All names and identifying details will be changed to save your identity, create throwaways if you want, but everything will be done privately. I think it’s time someone writes a book about what it’s really like to work as an elementary school teacher. I want to show the good AND the bad.

-It differs from Quick Key (seen on Reddit) because it is currently available on the store NOW and can scan up to 100 question exams. Quick Key is still beta testing and has only shown the ability to scan 30 question quizzes.

To Anyone Interested: I would like to offer a subscription code for 1 month subscription free usage in the app. The code will override the 100 free scans that come normally when you download it so I suggest using it once those scans are used up.

It's tough! My student teaching mentor was a complete and total dick; would not let me teach even a period, just signed the paper and sent me away (I got plenty of practice in other places, long story).
And my mentor at my first school WAS A COMPLETE AND TOTAL DRUNK ASSHOLE AND if you're reading this, Kenji, well...I gotta calm down. Seriously, his advice consisted of 'you worry too much' and 'who gives a fuck?' No help with day to day classroom procedures, grading advice, anything, just going to Vegas and being a jerk. 
However....
After a totally fucked year at another school where 22 of us got fired after our first year!, I got this job. This is my 12th year at this school and I love it. 
The first two years sucked. I got the worst of the worst kids, the smallest classroom and my NEW mentor was about as useless as the first (but sober. and nicer). However, once I proved that I could handle a variety of students at a variety of levels and ask for more, things got so much better.
Case in point: my present room. I got it because one of our oldest and saddest teachers (may she rest in peace) was retiring, the room was a mess and she was just sitting there, ready to cry. I poked my head in - I'd helped her with some overly aggressive kids earlier in the year, telling them to be nicer- and asked her what was wrong. She looked at me and said, I don't think I can clean all of this up. I told her: you just retired! Let me do that for you, you don't have to worry about it; take the stuff that matters to you and I'll get rid of the rest. I was just trying to be nice and she looked so depressed. Took me about a week (she had DIRT in JARS from the seventies!) and I ended up with her room. Big room! at the front of the school! NEXT TO THE MEN'S ROOM! Literally, next to the men's room = doors are a foot apart = easy peeing! I have room for a couch and an extra desk (I have three places to teach from as the mood strikes me).
My administrators know me. If I send a kid to them, they KNOW I don't cry wolf, so they back me up. If they need a place to put a kid with some kinks in his cable, they know I can deal. This give and take has been built over time but it happens.
New teachers: it's tough. The first few years are tough: the kids, the administration and the other teachers will be watching you.

1329072741.0,24,self.Teachers,pmajk,I am not a teacher but my friend is and here is one of her stories that I wanted to share.,26,2,3,http://www.reddit.com/r/Teachers/comments/pmajk/i_am_not_a_teacher_but_my_friend_is_and_here_is/,"Here is a story that I got in an email from a really good friend of mine.

&gt;So for the most part, this student is pretty immature.  He makes inappropriate jokes, crawls on the floor, and does this thing where he sticks he tongue out at me and wiggles it…he says it looks like something a devil would do, lovely.Today during math, we were learning about angles, and measuring angles, and drawing angles, and estimating the measurement of an angle by looking at it.  I helped him a lot because his motor skills aren’t
&gt;really all there, so drawing a straight line is tough for him.  He also struggled with the concept of angles greater than 180 degrees. He got confused a lot, so I showed him a few things to clear everything up for him, and it seemed to work.
&gt;After the kids had finished working on their workbook page, the teacher asked the kids to think of 2 tips they would give someone if they had to draw or measure an angle.  It’s important to understand that this student does not really participate.  Unless there is something in it for him—like a sticker–or some kind of reward.  The teacher doesn’t do anything like this, so the student just sits there–and most of the time I can tell he is zoning out, thinking about football, or bay blades, or how long until gym class.  Sometimes I make him admit to it too, haha.  And if he does have something to say, he rarely raises his hand.  Sometimes he will, but if he is not called on first, he gives up, and says it is not worth it to sit there and wait to be called on.
&gt;
&gt;Today he raised his hand…and not in a lame way.  His hand was straight in the air.  And kept it raised while 2 people explained their tips. Thankfully, he got called on.  He wiggled in his seat, sat up straight, cleared his throat, and began to eloquently explain some of the things that I worked on with him.
&gt;
&gt;When he normally speaks in class, he tries to be funny.  Sometimes he will do an accent to make everyone laugh, and distract everyone.  Not this time.  He was a professor.
&gt;
&gt;He demonstrated angles by using his hands…and talked about how right angles look like the letter L. “If you put your hands together like this (wrist to wrist, palms facing each other), and bring them closer, that is an acute angle. And if you open them up wide, that is an “abuse” angle.  UGHHH, I cannot pronounce that word!!!!    And straight lines, are, well, straight.  So you put your hands like this.  And then if you make an angle bigger, your hands kind of have to go backwards.  Let’s say I look at angle like this *draws an acute angle, not realizing no one could see it but him*.  Well, I can see that it is SMALLER than a right angle, so you know, that makes it easier for me to guess how much it is, because at least I know it is less than 90 degrees….” (I was teary by this time.)
&gt;
&gt;The teacher attempted to respond…”Very good!  Boys and girls, he is saying tha—-”
&gt;
&gt;But he cuts in to go into further detail, not letting the teacher talk.   (Thatta boy!)  (I didn’t know whether to laugh or cry at this point.)
&gt;
&gt;I helped him finalize his words, and he explains that the right angle can be used as a guide to determine whether an angle is acute or obtuse and then the approximate angle.  ”And if you know these things, and that an acute angle is smaller than 90 degrees and an obtuse angle is bigger than 90 degrees, basically, you know, you will get an A on the test!”
&gt;
&gt;And then he put his hand down, and sat there, like everything he said was just no big deal, except it was, because he was 110% accurate.
&gt;
&gt; 
&gt;And he had the attention on every single kid in the room.  Because when he speaks for real–and isn’t trying to be the funny guy—he commands the room in a natural way.And after this, I just stared at the kid, in shock.  And it didn’t matter how he behaved for the rest of the day, because in my opinion, that moment was worth every time I have had to tell him to raise his hand, sit up straight, hold his pencil the right way, pay attention, write this down, write that down, writer neater, stop writing ‘poop’ in your notebook, stand still, sit still, make a better choice, show respect, no we cannot play 52 card pickup, no we cannot talk about football right now, stop calling me by my first name, give your friends some space, I don’t care if you don’t feel like doing this right now, and yes you have to listen to me, etc.  Because he had just done everything perfectly, and maturely, and like a 4th grader.
&gt;And that is why I teach.  Because nothing beats the feeling of one of your kids having a ‘light bulb moment’…where for just one moment, everything seems to click, and success is achieved…and the kids may not even notice it…but I do, because that is what we have been working towards for the past five and a half months.  And it is just enough to make you want to tackle the next obstacle the next day.  And for me, apparently it is enough to make me want to cry, because I am emotional like that.  I call it the light bulb effect.

And of course, if you guys have any questions for me feel free to ask. Thank you for your time! ^^

1.	What grade and subject do you teach and what made you want to become a teacher?

2.	Do you feel as though you aren’t appreciated for your work? Do you feel as though you have no control over what goes on in the school?

3.	How involved are you in the school? Do you try to get to know the students or do you tend to separate yourself from work as much as possible? Do you feel as though it has to do with your gender or the grade you teach?

4.	Do you tend to treat your students differently based on their race or socioeconomic background? (E.g. you’re more willing to help one student over another) If not, have you seen a colleague do so?

5.	The US is ranked 17th in education among developed nations. How can we improve our education system?

6.	I’m not sure about other states, but I know that in California a larger portion of our budget is directed towards prisons than it is for education. As a result many schools don’t have much access to resources and a large number of teachers have been laid off. Is it similar in your state? Do you believe education isn’t stressed enough in the state and national level? 

7.	Are you part of a teacher’s union? Do you feel as though it has done a sufficient job in representing you opinion as a collective whole and protecting your rights?

8.	I know teaching can be a really stressful job. What are the factors that stress you out the most? (E.g. Disruptive students, parents)

9.	Do you have enough job satisfaction that you could see yourself teaching long term? Do you ever feel yourself burning out or have you seen a colleague burn out?

EDIT: Wow! I didn't expect this many replies. Thank you very much for taking time out of your day to answer my questions. I'll do my best to incorporate everyone's answers. One of my high school teachers is actually on the edge of burning out. He taught me during his 2nd year of teaching. I went to visit him 3 years after I graduated and I saw how tired and stressed out he was. He was the teacher that taught me and inspired me the most, so, to see him so depleted was really disheartening. This may not be much coming from a stranger...however...although we may not show it, there are some students who do appreciate the amount of work you guys put in! I do agree we are ignorant for the most part though. I hope you guys can hang in there, but even if you can't no one will blame you. If that time comes, I hope you guys can find a new beginning and start fresh. Thank you once again for your help!

At first I was upset at the prospect of what's going to happen to teaching here over the next few years, but my next thought was: ""why not take them up on their offer and open my own school?""

One of the bills made it possible for students to take classes almost anywhere, and their per-pupil funding can be split as many as 6 different ways as students take classes at School A, School B and even online School C (for example). So here's my thought: open a ""Math &amp; Science Center"" that will offer 3 classes per day (and run that sequence twice a day). Students would take one math class, a corresponding science class, and an elective that is either math or science based. 

The per-pupil funding here is almost $8,000, based on a 6 hour day. So my school would get ~$3,500 per kid (because they'd only be there for half a school day). If I started small and only offered 2 ""levels"" (9th and 10th grade for example) in the first year and kept class sizes capped at 25, I could get by with 4 teachers and I would collect *~$630,000.*

I know its that time of the year where kids are getting antsy and such, but I am having a tough time. A really tough time with one of my 5 classes.

This is going to be a TL;DR

Basically, I teach 10th grade US history, 4 times a day. My 6th period is comprised of my IEP kids, some above average kids, and basically every single disruptive kid in the 10th grade.

No seating chart or arrangement works...I swear I've tried them all. They are more than willing to talk across the room right over me.

I have followed your general rule handbook guidelines. Warnings, detentions, phone calls home, one-on-one conferences, positive reinforecement, and literally nothing works.

They are not there to learn, they are there to socialize. I do not want a silent classroom. I like buzz, but this is too much.

I'm at the point where I literally just want to give them bookwork and end of section questions. I have never, ever done that. 

I can't keep teaching them like this. I try different styles of learning; Projects, lecture, hands-on, ALL THAT! I am at a loss.

The worst part is, there are great kids in there who struggle and need help...help that I can't give while babysitting. 

We have state exams coming up next week and most of these kids have not paid an ayota of attention so I am confident they will do poorly.

What can I do?? At this point I just want to focus on the kids who WANT to learn...but I can't figure out how.

Help. Please.

TL:DR I am having horrible classroom management issues with one particular class.


**Edit**  So, what I did today was pull each problem child out individually during lunch to have a very frank, firm, but caring conversation. 

I stressed making decisions. I stressed that they are responsible young adults who need to make a choice between two options. One is to come ready to learn, the other is to disrupt. Both choices have consequences that they should be ready to accept. I explained what their choices would bring them, and stressed that it was not me handing out consequences, but them choosing to earn them.

In class, I wrote ""MOVIE"" on the board, and said that at any point if I have to stop teaching to correct behavior, I erase a letter. If we keep any letters by Friday, we will watch a movie. If not, we will do bookwork to make up for the lost content. (Choices, and class policing)

I told each one that I deeply care for not only their grade but them as people. I explained that I was not yelling at them or disciplining them, but simply making them aware of where we stood as a group.

I have been here for about a month and it has only gotten worse. I have never hated my job so much.

The kids have no respect for anyone. They disrespect themselves, each other, administration, and myself. I was observed today and one child refused to cooperate and instead stood up and screamed. Instead of doing something about it, the principal said I have no control of my class and I need to work on that. Well, clearly I need help and I don't know what to do. I've worked on behavior. I make phone calls home. I have a management system set up with consequences and I am consistent with it. The kids just don't care.

I also have issues with a lack of support from administration. They aren't interested in helping, only critiquing. I have asked for advice and what I can do to get help, but they don't respond or say they can't do anything.

I'm just sick of being here. I hate coming to school every day. I loved teaching during student teaching and even when I was a substitute. I know it's what I love doing. This school has made me hate everything about it.

What would be the consequences for putting in my 2 weeks notice? How would this impact my ability to get another job in a different school? Would it be better to suffer until June?

**Edit:** I used to substitute in NY where there was a union, but now I am in NC where we do not have a union as it is illegal to form one. While talking to a union rep would be wonderful, it is sadly not an option for me.

I'm an undergraduate student at MIT working on an iPad application to be used by students and teachers, ideally those working in a 1:1 technology environment.  The goal of the application is to digitize and save teacher-to-student interactions like lectures, homework, and tests and then analyze them in order to add value for everybody in the classroom.  We haven't started development yet, and we really want to make sure that we're solving the problems that are really there, and not just the ones we're imagining.  To those of you that work with students using iPads, what have you found to be the biggest issues with having them in the classroom?  What are the largest benefits?  If you were going to try and take an iPad and add any dream feature to it for teachers (or students!) in order to maximize learning and minimize waste (of time, resources, thought, etc...), what would you add?

Aside from being confronted with the reality that a lot of my students hate reading and writing, I'm having no major problems.

Today, one of my sophomores, a boy, was rude and disrespectful to me. He didn't swear at me or anything, just talked down to me as if I was one of his peers (he's also a dick to other students and other teachers--and doesn't do his work). 

Before I could really respond to the situation, my cooperating teacher pulled him out of class and talked to him elsewhere. I continued teaching, but was left with an overall shitty feeling.

I decided that I want to have a private word with this student next time the class meets. I want to establish boundaries and make him aware of consequences--basically assert the authority he clearly doesn't think I have. I want to nip this in the bud.

I mean, part of me wanted to just be like, ""Listen. Don't ever talk to me like that again. Your attitude is terrible, and you need to learn some respect. Maybe if you shut your mouth and did your work, you wouldn't be failing this class."" And that's the clean version.

But I'm a teacher now (almost), and he's just a kid. How do I deal with this kid and his ilk without being overly threatening or mean? My other students, even the notorious ones, show me respect because I treat them like human beings and don't talk down to them--plus I obviously want them to succeed.

What's more, two people they hired after me are getting English sections and they are currently looking for someone to teach an English section. 

I passed up another offer for this job because I liked their English curriculum. I also passed up numerous job interviews after the fact because I'd made a commitment. I was really excited about finally being a real English teacher and now I feel like I'm not even sure I want to go to training tomorrow.

I'm looking to do some subbing because I can't take full-time teaching at the moment, due to family issues. I've done some googling and some research on threads here and come up with the following wall of text:

**In general**

* Get on good terms with the admin staff.
* Dress well. Look, feel and act confidently.
* Don’t be nervous and uptight, don’t get rattled.
* Be consistent.
* Don’t get involved with school politics – you’re a disposable contractor and will be the first to get cut loose.
* Lend a hand to other teachers if you’re not busy.
* Investigate classroom management strategies and find out which one works for you.
* Carry a folder of back-up games and activities.
* Don’t be afraid to ask for help.


**Pre-class**

* Get to the school early – if it’s going to be a place you want a regular gig, consider asking if you can show up beforehand at the end of a school day, when people will have more time to run you through the basics.
* Find out the names of the year level coordinators and the teachers you are subbing for.
* Get a copy of the school guidelines policy (attendance, classroom discipline, if and when students are allowed to leave the classroom [especially toilet breaks], class times and emergency procedures).
* Get a map of the school.
* Collect passwords for (1) classroom PCs (2) any software you need to log in to and (3) the photocopier, if necessary.
* Have a go-to plan in place to manage any rare crisis or major event.
* Is there a photo sheet of the class available? If not, see below.
* Collect and understand the absent teacher’s lesson material.
* If there is no lesson material available, contact the department head to see if they have anything, otherwise allow students to catch up on their own work/use some of your busy work/class games.


**Start of class**

* Sub’s name and three single word guidelines on board:

1. Respect (I have respect for you, you have respect for me and you have respect for each other.)
2. Responsibility (you are responsible for your own learning and behaviour.)
3. Routine (normal classroom rules apply, I’m not here to shake things up; however, they have to realise that things will be a little different.)

* Tell students that they should do the work assigned, or else write a letter to their class teacher explaining why they didn’t. If they won’t do that, tell them you will write the letter for them. (Sometimes they will have a very good reason why they can’t concentrate.)
* Write down the activities the students are doing on the board so they don’t have an excuse to lose focus.
* Don’t be a hard-arse or a pushover.


**Classroom management**

* Establish a routine (like a raised hand) to indicate when you need silence.
* Learn as many names as the situation allows. (This may involve marking them on a seating chart as you take roll.)
* Never shout or lose your temper.
* Respond warmly to positive interactions and coolly to negative interactions.
* As a motivator, praising good behaviour almost always trumps damning bad behaviour.
* Praise in public, discipline in private (beside them in a quiet voice, after class or in the hallway).
* If you raise your voice slightly for momentary control, lower it and softly thank the class for following directions.
* Have an established order of discipline escalation, from non-verbal body language to involving admin (as a last resort).
* Own the classroom. Walk and talk when necessary, don’t just hide behind the desk.
* Consistency: follow through with the consequences that students earn via negative behaviour.
* Discipline with ‘what’ questions rather than with more confrontational/blaming ‘why’ questions.
* The old maxim: “kids don't care what you know until they know that you care.” Of course, difficult for a sub to pull off unless they have repeated contact with a class/students.
* Remember that group work can tricky for a substitute teacher to manage. Use it as a carrot (“I think you’re responsible enough to handle working in pairs/small groups” or a stick “I need to see that you can work quietly by yourselves before I let you work in pairs/groups.”)


**Post-class**

* Make sure the classroom is left in proper shape for the next class.
* Leave the regular teacher some notes indicating what occurred during the class, including any complete refusal to do work/serious acting out, what work was or wasn’t done, and anything unusual you may have noticed.

Being that I am 26, have been married for a year, and they are all from a culture that generally has large families, they all want me to get pregnant.  The other day (in the middle of a lesson on time zones) one of the girls asks me if I will be back next year.  Since my position is permanent I told them certainly!  A couple start giggling, and I hear one whisper (in the way that only 14 year old girls can whisper so everyone can hear) ""Why wouldn't Miss be back next year?"" to which the other replied ""We think she is pregnant.""  I told them without a doubt nope, not pregnant!  I then still had to defend myself for 10 more minutes, including telling them that I ""do not have a pregnancy glow, I just started using a new foundation.""  I still don't think they believe me - I had a kid I don't even teach come up to me on the field, tell me congratulations and skip off.  This is awkward.

However much my parents think I am, I'm not a genius; however, I'm quite a bit above average in mathematics and chemistry (if I find teaching math isn't what I want to do but still want to stay in teaching, I'd love to teach chemistry or physics). My parents, as far as I can tell, want me to be a pharmacologist or a doctor of some sort, but I'm just not interested in it. I don't care nearly as much about being the next famous researcher as I do about being famous among a small group of students I've taught.

I am unsure of what I should do when students do not complete homework. 

During my student teaching, my cooperating teachers had the policy that if homework was not completed, students were asked to do it during recess. However, it did not remedy the issue for students who habitually did not complete assignments and of course, did not help behavior with no break. Some days, if many students did not complete homework, the teachers would waste time and call parents during class. 

What can I do to help my students complete their homework? I believe in positive discipline and teaching students problem solving skills so I'm thinking of talking to the student individually and maybe a form that will be stapled to their homework that includes their name, date and reason of why they did not complete it (suggestions- forgot, no time at home, doing something else, too difficult/need help, etc.) and then their idea to solve the problem: (setting a time each night for homework to be completed, asking parent/sibling for help, asking teacher for help, etc) 

What do you think? After 3 times, should the parent get involved? I'd love any feedback or suggestions you have. Thank you very much!

Anyways, now I have about 5-6 weeks left until new teacher orientation and have been trying to organize myself to be very productive over the coming weeks. I've split my work into 4 categories: Classroom Set-Up, Classroom Management, First Weeks of School, and Curriculum. 

I have a ton of things listed in each category (if you have any suggestions, I'd love and appreciate them!) But I really need help with organization.

I really **can't** afford that to happen in my first year so I am asking for advice on how to keep things like graded work organized, what kind of schedule I should be on so I don't have to panic when grades are due, how to keep parent conferences/contacts organized, and other things I just don't know about yet! I know there have been lots of ""I'm a first year teacher- what should I do?"" and I've been reading those a lot, but specific organization tips would be really helpful.

1363273640.0,17,self.Teachers,1aacqr,the difference between education reform and school reform,20,3,9,http://www.reddit.com/r/Teachers/comments/1aacqr/the_difference_between_education_reform_and/,"**nb** This was first posted in /r/education, but it never ever got posted.  So I'm trying here.  Sorry if my reddiquette is off on this one.

OK. I've had it up to here with talk of education reform in America. In my opinion, this country has yet to take any significant steps down the road to education reform. Rather, we've made insignificant gains in the realm of school reform in a reasonably pathetic attempt to mimic education reform.

Let's begin by making a mental picture of what an ideal school day would be like. A child arrives to school (I'm going to use a male as an example), well-rested, well-fed, intellectually stimulated by his home life, homework completed, self-esteem elevated by positive interactions at home, pre-frontal cortex allowed to function because he doesn't feel threatened, and in an environment that promotes a sense of calm and well-being.

Let's be honest, we'd be golden if we could get to that point. If we could get to that point, teachers would be able to teach, busywork would become a thing of the past, and classroom management would become much, much easier. Education could happen.

Let's consider what teachers across the nation tend to face. A kid comes to school not having had breakfast, having been bombarded with loud music in the car, no homework done because there is little accountability outside of the school walls for schoolwork, fearful of so many things, and clawing at self-worth by any means necessary. In an attempt to force the second child to act like the first child, we institute school reforms. We provide free food for kids, but the cost requires that we default to the lowest common nutritional denominator, so kids get sugar for breakfast.

Kids come to school unable to read, so we interpret that as kids expressing their intelligences in different ways, so we ask teachers to write, read, sing, move, and share their curricula in multimodal ways. Kids come to school feeling unsafe, so we mandate that schools reduce problem behavior without addressing the underlying causes of said behavior. Large infractions are treated harshly while the smaller infractions causing the larger ones are ignored.

A more rigorous curriculum is a great thing, but it is little more than putting brown paint on a balloon and calling it a coconut, then punishing the schools when the balloons produce no milk. At present, it's just school reform.

Real, meaningful education reform must by all means begin outside of the school. The media have to alter their messages. Nutritious food must be made available and convenient to purchase. Sleep time must be honored. Homework must be completed. Reading must occur. Accountability must flow from the inside to the outside, then back in.

tl;dr What people call education reform is largely just school reform. Education reform must occur from outside the school walls.

Hey /r/teachers,

I am currently doing a combination of tutoring and volunteering in an elementary school. The goal is to gain experience that will benefit me once I commence my Master's in Education. For the past three months I have been limited to observing the kids and running an after school tutoring group.

This quarter i received a larger group of students, and one ""problem child"", totaling five. Yesterday, during our first session together, she decided that the point system to determine rewards was unfair, and opted to not participate for the majority of the session. I ignored her and kept the rest of the kids on track, and occasionally asked her if she wanted to rejoin the group, each time receiving a negative response.

Toward the end of the hour she came over and started interacting with her peers in a way that was interfering with their ability to work. I told her to leave the classroom and go to the cafeteria, where a school staff member would watch her until her dad came and got her. 

This caused her to melt down into tears. This was followed by her throwing a pencil in my direction, and then responses in escalating volume to my instructions for her to leave. Having arranged the desks at the beginning of the hour to form a row facing my, I had no access to her, and felt that the impediment of the desk between us was emboldening her behavior. So I pulled her desk and chair out of the way and stood about 2 feet away from her, instructed her to leave in a scolding tone (which I just learned that I had), and then asked her why she wasn't leaving. This resulted in her sitting down, arms crossed, crying, at which point I told her that if she could remain quiet she could remain.

As the hour was wrapping up I sent the other kids back to cafeteria to be dismissed, and kept her behind to talk to her. She told me that she thought the point system was unfair, and i told her exactly why she got points and, consequently, no candy. We went back and forth on this for a minute, and then I called it as our time was up.

As we were leaving the classroom, one of the other students came running up and asked me if the problem student needed to be written up, saying that the school staff needed to know. This caused the problem child to melt down all over again, as she was now in actual trouble. In this state of tears, I walked her back to the cafeteria where her father was waiting for her. I calmly introduced myself to him, explained the events that led to his daughter in tears and hugging his legs, and told him that I was looking forward to having a better day tomorrow. 

We all left after that. On the drive home, all night at work, and even now as I am preparing to return to school, where I will see this child, I have felt like hell for disciplining this kid. It was the first time that something like this had happened, and it caught me by surprised in terms of how fast things escalated. 

My questions for you all are as follows:

1. How do you come back, in terms of a relationship, from such a negative experience with a kid you have to work with?

2. Is it normal to feel really bad the first this happens? Will it get easier to be the disciplinarian? 

3. Finally, can you point me toward some resources which address constructive ways to deal with a defiant child?

Thanks!

A month ago during the parent-teacher conference the teacher said she was behind all the other students, couldn't focus and she thought she had ADD.  I said I would do whatever was necessary but I insisted that she be seen by a doctor and tested.  Apparently the school didn't like this and asked me to come into a meeting with the teacher, school psych and the Principal.  I didn't have any test results but they insisted.  During this conference I found out the teacher was allowing my granddaugther to:  

Play with a toy during class lessons, color pictures while she was giving her teaching and allowing her to leave her desk and walk around the classroom as long as she didn't disturb the other children.  This is just an example.  I was shocked because I thought she should not be allowing her to do this.  Am I wrong?  I am afraid this will do damage when she moves up to first grade?  The other 2 ""professionals"" in the room didn't question this at all. Is this okay?

Oh and when the meeting was over, I told them I would get them the test results as soon as I could.  They said it didn't matter if she had ADD because she was doing fine academically and they wouldn't give her another other services even if she did have it. 

Edit: I cannot thank you all enough for all your advice.  I feel so much better now just reading the responses. Her teacher is really nice.  Her teacher did say she really liked playing on the IPad they have in the classroom.  They asked me if I had one and I said no so they suggested I buy one.  I told them those were too expensive.  Then they asked if I had a Wii or Xbox.  And I said no again.  They suggested I get one of them when I am more ""Financially stable"".

Yesterday she asked me to be the supervisor when his dad comes for visitation twice a week, and I am most definitely not in a position to be doing that. I don't want to be her minion/spy. 

She has cameras in every room and it's unacceptable if he gets even one question wrong. She's asian, if that makes any difference. I've never encountered anything like this, but I don't know exactly what to do.

1360435309.0,16,self.Teachers,187bqj,In defense of the elementary teacher (or what I would tell Junior High and High School teachers),18,2,36,http://www.reddit.com/r/Teachers/comments/187bqj/in_defense_of_the_elementary_teacher_or_what_i/,"I appreciate what you do, secondary teachers, and I understand how hard your job is, how many kids you see in a day, and how much diversity of skill and preparedness you students arrive with. 

I just don't want to be blamed for the student's failings.  

For background, I have taught at the elementary level for 17 years.  The only grades I haven't taught are 1st and 3rd, and I was a Resource Specialist for a couple of those years.  I currently teach at a k-6 school, teaching 6th grade.  

I know kids say all the time ""No one ever taught me that"", or ""My xx grade teacher told me this"" - and often it is not true.  Maybe they didn't understand, or they didn't 'get it' when it was taught every year for the past 3 or 4 years, but chances are it was taught.  I have looped (taught 4th then the same kids 5th, or 5th to 6th), and they STILL claim I didn't teach them something the year before, even though I know I not only taught it, but we worked with a concept extensively and I assessed for mastery.  

Students also continue to hold on to odd ideas that someone said once in passing or a well-intended teacher/tutor/parent said to them.  I cannot count how many times I have been asked how many sentences are required for an assignment (my answer is always ""as many as it takes"") or how often I am told that FIVE sentences make a paragraph.  Students hold on to these ideas and they stick and it is very hard to get around them. 

Granted, there are some teachers out there who still use formulaic strategies for teaching writing - but I would hope most of us do not.  We all have to fight against this - it isn't something that just secondary teachers face.  I have spent many years trying to convince a few teachers that 'more is not better' when it comes to writing.  I also teach in an area where many students go to specialized language schools on the weekend, where they not only learn the language (Chinese, Korean, Arabic..) but also have intensive English lessons - which are notoriously bad (talk about formulaic writing - they all sound exactly the same). 

We, at the elementary level, are generalists - we teach all subjects.  So, sure, your students will not come with a deep understanding of some mathematical or scientific concept - or their memory of what American history was will be spotty at best.  I know that I cover the standards - I look at what my state (and soon Common Core) says kids need to know and make sure that we teach to that.  I also have limited knowledge in some areas - certainly a better understanding that what is required of my students, but I don't have a BA or BS in Science, Mathematics, History or English - Most of us have a general subject degree (liberal studies, for instance) or some other subject area and have shown proficiency in the general areas by assessment (psychology, philosophy, child development).   We are doing our best, but we don't have the knowledge or understanding someone with a content-related degree would possess.  

And what you say about us often comes back to us.  My former students stop by all the time.  They tell me that their teachers say we didn't prepare them, we didn't teach them well.  This is especially true with 6th graders who were at elementary - they come back all the time to chat and check in.  And sometimes what they report teachers say to them is hard to hear.  I don't disparage your teaching, and I would appreciate the same courtesy, especially to the students.  This degrades all of us.  And, yes, I take what these kids say with a grain of salt, due to the 'we never heard that before' phenomenon.  

I hope this provides a bit of perspective.  I feel better having said this...  Thank you for listening.  


TL/DR - kids say teachers never taught them/taught them things when it is not true, elementary teachers are trying - but we all face deficits with kids, and blaming each other isn't helpful.

He's an engineer and it was the engineer career fair today. I haven't seen him since I moved back up to school for the semester (We've both been busy, conflict of schedules etc.) so I went and visited him. His booth was very crowded with a rush when I got there, so I stood and waiting for the crowd to die down. While waiting against the wall (I was dressed nicely as to not embarrass my dad), a lady approached me wearing some shirt of a company I've never heard of and asked me my name and shook my hand. She began to tell me about her company when I politely interrupted her and said ""I'm sorry ma'am, but I'm not really interested, I'm here visiting someone and my major wouldn't be useful in your company"". She asked my major, and when I responded with ""Education and History"", she scoffed. A smug smirk came to her face and I could tell she was doing all she could to not burst out laughing in my face. She said ""Oh, Education and history, yes there's no place for you"" and walked away. 

Now, I want to say this. I love education and the prospects of being a teacher. I fucking love it and have never questioned my choice before, even since I switched from being a business major my freshman year, and was MISERABLE. My initial response was: ""who the fuck are you to judge me? Because I want to help students you think you're better than me? Because I'm not great at math, you think you're better than me? Because I want to help children stay in school and stay out of prison, you can look down on me like that? Who the fuck do you think you are?""

Now, I've since calmed down, chatted with my dad for a while, and when he's done, we may grab a beer and some lunch. But on the bus back to my campus (large school, 4 campuses, bus system etc), I couldn't help but think...could I be doing more? Should I try and get some business/economic classes to maybe be an administrator or something? Now I've since dispelled those thoughts because fuck them, I love my future career and don't need those peoples opinions. But the question lingers, how do you current teachers deal with that? The ""oh, you're just a teacher"" remarks, because I know they exist, it can't be just me/around me. I know the old ""don't listen to others"" etc we're old told and tell our students, but the reality is, we can't help but think about it. It's human nature. My question, I guess, would be how do you all handle it? How do you get rid of that negativity and looking down upon of teachers? I know that I'll never question my career choice (as of now, I know some teachers consider quitting, and I'm not teaching quite yet so i can't speak for teachers really) but it's just annoying. It's there, lingering. 

AND WHY THE HELL DON'T PEOPLE VALUE AND UNDERSTAND THE IMPORTANT OF EDUCATION AND TEACHERS? I don't get it. And I know, teaching's not about the recognition, but the negativity, I could do with out.

The exchange would happen through a shared private blog, in which all students will have a screen name and password. Theoretically, they will be able to post messages, videos, audio clips, etc. and comment on all posts. I'll be setting up the technical logistics during the summer.

I'm a student teacher who would like to hear a variety of opinions on teaching. I have always wanted to be a teacher but recently have felt quite discouraged as most my lecturers at Uni are extremely negative, discribing teaching as **extremely** stressful, even 'soul destroying' at times etc. I am prepared to work after hours and enjoy being busy but the idea of having to work ridiculously long hours doing planning throughout my entire career isn't very appealing to me. 

So to clarify here are a few questions: How many hours do you work? Is it worth it? Do you have a life outside of teaching? Are your days mainly positive? 

Thank you in advance to anyone who responds.

You are so smart, why be a teacher? 

If you were to say you’re a firefighter, cop, doctor, lawyer, or many other professions people automatically respect and appreciate you and what you do.  But teachers are bombarded with questions and comments, which baffles me.  Teachers in America do not get the respect and appreciation they deserve.  They put in more time and effort to educate the future leaders of this country. They impact and lay a foundation for many students each and every day.  Teachers are held at a very high standard, as they should be, but in order as a society to hold them at that standard we need to respect and show them we appreciate everything they do.   

There are plenty of bad teachers but they are also plenty of good, even great teachers out there.  Society needs to see this, as a whole we can change the view of teachers.  Sure, they will always be a teacher in the headlines for doing something ill-advised but there aren't enough teachers making headlines for all the great stuff they do.

I went through so many of the same experiences.  I’ve really enjoyed passing along the things that I’ve learned over my time teaching and I wanted to see if I could think of all of the little things that I’ve done over the years to make my job easier and pass them along in one comprehensive post.  I’m also willing to help out with any specific questions or problems you might have.  

Quick background:  I’ve been teaching for the past 6 years.  I teach secondary math.  I’ve taught in one of the most crime ridden, gang infested, poverty stricken neighborhoods in all of New York City, in an urban charter school, and most recently, in a pretty well-to-do suburban high school.  I’m a 31 year old male and I’ve done all of my teaching in NYC and NJ.  I started teaching via an alternative certification program.  

**Grading:**  
•  I currently grade on a point system.  All of my previous schools have required a weighted average system (for example, if tests are worth 40%, do 0.40 x TEST AVERAGE and add all of the categories up.)  I prefer the point system because it’s easier to calculate (add up all points and divide by total points) and students can see the magnitude of assignments.  If standard homework is worth 4 points and I assign a project worth 20 points, it’s easy to see how they each relatively impact their grade.

•I only collect and grade what is absolutely necessary.  This means big projects and quizzes or tests.  I don’t collect homework or classwork, and I don’t do exit tickets.  Homework is checked strictly for completion and classwork doesn’t receive a grade.

•	I don’t give a grade for class participation or classwork because these are not easily quantifiable things.  When I did do this, I usually just gave everyone all of the points because it was tough to justify how much I should take away from whom for what.  This ends up inflating marking period averages.

•	When I make quizzes and tests, I always make an answer sheet that is one page double sided.  The top has a simple numbered table for students to enter multiple choice answers.  Below this are all of the open ended questions.  This saves a TON of time because there is no page flipping.  I literally grade a whole class’s test before they leave the class on the same day.  

[Example
](http://imgur.com/4Lqs8)

•	I always give my students the opportunity to make up work.  Even if they only get 1 out of 4 for late homework assignments, you’re giving them a motivation to sit down and engage in your material and that’s worth the leniency.  I also allow one reassessment of any QUIZ per quarter.  I recognize that my students get overwhelmed, they get sick, they have bad days, they have days where there are 5 tests and they might not be prepared.  They have to come to one extra help session to review what went wrong on the last quiz and I give them a reassessment that covers the same topic but with different questions (this should be pre-prepared – make two tests for each assessment.  This also lets you give back quizzes before absent students have taken it.  The absent students just get the reassessment.)


**Classroom management/discipline:**

•	Your best tool for managing your classroom and minimizing discipline issues is to keep your students busy at all times.  The moment that they walk into your classroom, they should be working.  I hand my students ALL of their warmups for the week on Monday on the same sheet of paper. [ Here’s an example of one. ](http://i.imgur.com/EVbox.png) During the first few weeks of school, I continually reinforce that warmup should come out and get started immediately after homework is taken out to be checked.  I make it long enough to last about 5-6 minutes while I’m circulating to check homework.  If warmup and/or homework isn’t out when I’m come by, I don’t check it and it’s a zero.  I usually have several students that are working before the bell even rings.  

•	Consider every reason that I student has to get out of their seat and have a procedure to minimize or eliminate that reason.  The most common ones are pencil sharpener, trash can, tissues, and bathroom.  I keep a box of presharpened pencils in my bag.  If a student needs a sharp pencil, they just hold up their pencil in the air and I grab one from my box and trade it for their dull one.  I then sharpen the collected pencils once every few weeks.  I tell my students that if they have trash, to just leave it on the corner of their desk and put it in the garbage at the end of the period.  If I happen to notice it while I’m circulating, I grab it and throw it out myself.  I try to put my tissue box in the least distracting place in the room and just ask my students to ask for permission before getting up to use it.  For the bathroom, I keep a prewritten pass by the door.  I ask my students to raise their hand with their thumb between their index and middle finger.  I can point them towards the door without stopping my lesson.  I’ve always hated when students raise their hand in the middle of teaching and ask for the bathroom, so this procedure minimizes distractions.  

**Instruction:**

•	Don’t lecture for too long.  Each little bite of material should be no longer than 10 minutes, less if possible.  I try to give them a little, then a problem or two to process.  This gives them a chance to not have to listen quietly for a few minutes and gives you a chance to circulate and check for understanding.  You also get students that won’t ask a question unless you are standing near them, so circulating gives these students the opportunity to ask questions.  

•	Independent work shouldn’t last for longer than 20 minutes.  

•	Convey your passion for your subject in your lesson delivery.  Students notice.

•	Always over prepare.  Have more copies of a worksheet then you think you need, throw a few extension questions at the end of the lesson so that if you get done quicker than you had planned for, you don’t have downtime with nothing to do.

•	I use SMART software and post my notes online as a PDF with the homework assignment for each lesson as well the digital version of any handouts  (My algebra class is at [www.chalgebra.info](www.chalgebra.info) if you want to check it out)   This lets students who are absent, especially for multiple days, try to keep up.  I’ve had students that were absent that were able to teach themselves the material and still do the homework that was assigned the day that they were absent.  It also gives parents access to the work that their student do in class so that they can look at your notes and help their children with homework.  

•       Use your competent colleagues as a resource.  There are 3-5 other teachers that teach the same subject as I do.  We split up the tasks - Someone will make the homework worksheet, I'll make slides for upcoming lessons, another will submit copies, etc.  No sense in 5 people doing the same work when you can share and tweak it to your style.  

•     Dress one level more formal than your students.  If it's a uniform school, wear something nicer than their uniform.  If it's a casual dress code, you can be more casual.  Regardless, I ALWAYS wear comfortable shoes.  You're on your feet a lot.  I stick with all black sneakers.

**Administrative tasks:**

•	I keep all of my attendance on jupitergrades.com instead of doing so on paper.  You can print out your roll if your administrator needs it and you can take your attendance in seating chart view instead of alphabetical, which just makes more sense.  

•	I also print out[ the seating charts and use them to check homework](http://imgur.com/1KRBO) – again, doing this by seating assignment makes more sense than doing so alphabetically.  I make a key along the right-hand side so I know what the assignments are.  Each of the 5 boxes are for one of the week’s assignments.  I put a check mark if the homework is complete with all work.  If there are problems not done, they get a 1 out of 4 or 2 out of 4.  If they’re absent when you’re checking the assignment (i.e. they were present when you assigned it but not for the check), I put on A in the box so that I can remind them the day that they come back.  If they were absent on the day that the assignment was given but present on the check day, I put ALC (absent last class) in the box.  It works really well.  

 
•       I enter homework on the school’s online gradebook immediately after I check it.  My students are finishing their warmup and I’m waiting anyway.  It takes about 2 minutes to fill in numbers to 20 boxes.  Parents appreciate the immediate feedback and you have one less task piling up.

I teach an 8th grade language arts class, and I am at my wit's end with my students. Don't get me wrong, I have some incredible students in this class, who are intelligent, interested, and eager to participate. But I have noticed that classes seem to take on their own little cultures. Whereas my 4th period class's culture is one of harmony and enthusiasm, this 5th period class has taken on the role of the petulant child. I have never seen such blatant disrespect and lack of willingness to try. I think that one of the keys to deeper understanding of a text is through discussion, but I had a girl say to me today ""Can't we just read this and get it over with?"" I was flabbergasted. I have punished, I have rewarded, I have put hours of time and effort into making lessons that cross multiple subjects and include a variety of texts. I have done all the things that my idealized college classes said I should. I read them stories that I LOVE, in order to make sure that I am also showing passion for the subject. But I'm done. I'm ready to have them bring in their textbooks, ditch the special lesson I have created, and go page by page; this is something that I abhor in teaching. I don't want to go through the book and have them complete rote tasks. I want them to start thinking critically about life, but I am meeting such resistance.

I had an interview this morning for a charter school right by the university. It's for at risk students. They have 118 students for next year, and I'll be THE English teacher for all students.

Your heart is going to get broken. You will also break hearts. It's not the end of the world. Please consider postponing the whole 'starting a family' thing until you've got a solid foundation. For a while, you might be all the family you have, so be nice to yourself.

**Recipe: No-Knead Bread**

Adapted from Jim Lahey, Sullivan Street Bakery 

Time: About 1 1⁄2 hours plus 14 to 20 hours’ rising
3 cups all-purpose or bread flour, more for dusting 

1⁄4 teaspoon 

instant yeast 

1 1⁄4 teaspoons salt 

Cornmeal or wheat bran as needed.


1. In a large bowl combine flour, yeast and salt. Add 1 5/8 cups water, and stir until blended; dough will be shaggy and sticky. Cover bowl with plastic wrap (or put the whole thing in a zip-loc bag). Let dough rest at least 12 hours, preferably about 18, at warm room temperature, about 70 degrees.


2. Dough is ready when its surface is dotted with bubbles. Lightly flour a work surface and place dough on it; sprinkle it with a little more flour and fold it over on itself once or twice. Cover loosely with plastic wrap and let rest about 15 minutes.


3. Using just enough flour to keep dough from sticking to work surface or to your fingers, gently and quickly shape dough into a ball. If you're going to add cheese or olives or garlic cloves or ?, this is a good time. Generously coat a cotton towel (not terry cloth) with flour, wheat bran or cornmeal; put dough seam side down on towel and dust with more flour, bran or cornmeal. Cover with another cotton towel and let rise for about 2 hours. When it is ready, dough will be more than double in size and will not readily spring back when poked with a finger.


4. At least a half-hour before dough is ready, heat oven to 450 degrees. Put a 6- to 8-quart heavy covered pot (cast iron, enamel, Pyrex or ceramic) in oven as it heats. I use a Dutch oven I got at a garage sale. IT WILL BE VERY HOT. HOT THINGS CAN HURT YOU. BE CAREFUL. When dough is ready, carefully remove pot from oven. Slide your hand under towel and turn dough over into pot, seam side up; it may look like a mess, but that is O.K. Shake pan once or twice if dough is unevenly distributed; it will straighten out as it bakes. Cover with lid and bake 30 minutes, then remove lid and bake another 15 to 30 minutes, until loaf is beautifully browned. Cool on a rack.
Yield: One 1 1⁄2-pound loaf.


Life is hard enough: do you have to add to the ugliness by hating people for their color, origin, orientation or preference in automobiles? Like dial-up Internet and frozen fish sticks, leave that junk behind. The world is going to surprise you, anyways.


Before you graduate, please a)thank a teacher who helped you when you needed it, and b)apologize to a teacher or administrator if you screwed up. Somebody besides me.

The best I can do is a smile and a thanks and maybe a hug before I turn into Mushy Teacher IRL!

Watching you guys walk across the stage was awesome, but bittersweet. I feel like I have gotten to know you all so well over the course of the year. I saw you at your best and often at your worst, and vice versa. For many of you I knew whether you were having a good or bad day by the first glimpse I saw of your face as you came down AA hall to my room. Q, I knew that if I didn't see you second period that something had happened at home. It meant a lot to me that you shared what was going on with me; I appreciated that you placed that level of trust and respect in me. I know you don't want to be pitied but it's so cool that you're graduating despite everything that's happened, and I couldn't be prouder of you. And the scholarship! What a gift - be thankful and keep being the hard worker you are! Success is perseverance. CB, we didn't always agree and it feels like sometimes you went out of your way to get on my nerves, but for some reason I think I liked you more because of it. Thanks for the laughs and even, in a weird way, the headaches. :) CW, even though you thought the standardized tests were a stupid waste of time (and so do I), it was cool that you stayed after all those Tuesdays just to get some extra help. Even if you don't pass it this time, I know you tried your very best and that's what counts. I'm gonna miss that super loud laugh of yours.

When my father died and my co-workers came to the funeral, the card they gave me that you all signed was one of the ones I loved the most. I feel like you guys knew me better than some of the random cousins and great-aunts that were there! Thanks for the hugs when I came back, and even just to those of you who simply said hello and welcome back. You don't know how much that meant to me.

I made it through your last day without crying, even though you didn't think I would. But that's not to say that I didn't shed a tear at 3:15 after reading the thank you notes you guys wrote me. You really didn't have to do that. When I was a student I thought being a teacher would be easy, but I quickly learned how wrong I was! It means so much when a student goes out of his/her way to acknowledge a teacher's work for him/her. It's way better than anything I'd get from my boss or co-workers and I appreciate it.

I know you guys think you were bad a lot of the time, and well, you could be. But that doesn't mean that every day of the last year I wasn't proud to be your teacher. You have taught me more about myself and about life than you probably will ever know. Don't let anyone limit you or tell you you are not worth everything anyone else on this planet is.

My class has four boys, two with ADHD/ED, one with ADHD, and another with Autism, a very tough mix to start with, especially being a first-year teacher like myself. I am a certified special education teacher, but hadn't worked in an environment like this, especially on my own. I got almost no outside resources. I have ended up spending over $300 out of pocket for materials for my classroom. My only advice from the principal was to ""be strict.""

The first day was a couple of weeks ago and went pretty smoothly. Then we had a day off for the 4th, and then back again on the 5th, and then the weekend. Ever since then, there has been a downfall in behavior in the classroom. We had one new student added who can be passive aggressive towards his classmates and have trouble controlling his emotions. No surprise, he has an Emotional Disorder. Obviously this behavior is unacceptable and unfortunately has become common for him and now some of his classmates. Like I said, this mix was a very volatile one. I immediately took my concerns to the principal and lead teachers. They gave me ideas such as a tickets reward system and a prize for good behavior each day. I implemented pretty much everything they told me to do. But it has gone nowhere. Everyday we seem to have bullying or conflicts between the students, and I get burned out each day trying to keep the peace. 

Today came a very serious incident. We were cleaning the classroom; it was going great, the kids were taking ownership and doing a good job. Then the new kid suddenly takes the board cleaning bottle and sprays a couple of kids, and of course it ends up getting in the eyes of a couple of the kids. Before long my principal and lead teacher come down and explain that unless there's a turnaround in my students' behavior by Friday, I'd be asked to leave.

I don't know what to do. I hate quitting, but quite frankly it might be the best option. We clearly have a difference in philosophies. The administration's seems to be ""my way or the high way"" to the kids, where I try to meet kids at each of their needs and take what small victories I can get each day. I agree my kids' behavior is not ideal. But they have emotional disorders, these things do happen, and it won't be just one summer school teacher to make them go away.

I don't feel supported. I feel frustrated and angry. I love these guys with all my heart, and know they are all good kids. When I have them one-on-one they are the biggest sweethearts ever. But according to my principal ""that's not realistic."" I hate to give up on my kids, and I hate that I spent all that money on basically nothing, but I can't work in this environment. It's not even fair to the kids who already have a reputation amongst the other teachers. The secretary said ""Good luck. Hope you don't regret working here.""

I teach a College Composition class for high school seniors. In addition to other small projects, the main focus of the class is for them to write a 12-15 page research paper. We spend the majority of the semester researching, outlining, drafting and redrafting, conferencing, revising and editing. The final drafts were due this past Friday, and I can't believe how disappointing they are. Many of them are only 8 or 9 pages, are littered with errors in spelling and grammar, have improperly formatted works cited pages/in-text citations or, worse yet, none at all. In one, I couldn't even find a thesis statement. I can't help but feel that I've done something wrong. They are not all bad (I have five A's so far out of the 25 I've graded), but it seems the ones that are not A's are really awful. Has anyone been in a similar situation?

It is in a way in response to a debate that opened up in another thread. Please understand that these are just my opinions. and Please feel free to agree or disagree with me.*

Over the last few weeks I have been bombarded with questions about why I feel that English is an important subject.

After much debate on a particular post, it appeared that the general consensus is that English is an important subject. But I feel it may be necessary to address some of the concerns mentioned in a couple of the comments.

Several people posting asked about why we teach English and not technical writing, public speaking or critical reading. It is my endeavor in this post to show that you do in fact learn about these things in English. However they may not be as in depth as certain poster's would like, there is however a basic level able to be seen within the subject on each of these individual topics.

**Technical writing** – Technical writing may not be covered in depth, but through studying English at school, we begin to understand the use for analytical and technical writing, Essays actively help students develop their ability to write coherently and correctly. Yes it may not be as technical as other subjects demand, but if it wasn't for studying English in the first place we would not be able to write effective and cohesive arguments in a technical essay based manner.

**Public Speaking** – Public speaking, is another fine example of where this commenter has in my opinion got it wrong. Most schools I know of have a section in the curriculum based around oral presentation of material learned. This is in fact a way of preparing students for the eventuality of public speaking in later life. Presentations and public speaking are a fact of life, and suggesting that English does not help to prepare students for this eventuality seems a little preposterous. 

**Critical Reading** – Now this is the one point where I will concede slightly. In English at school level we are taught to read analytically to a certain extent, this helps us to be able to interpret the literature we read, understand the author/writer's motives in what we read. Obviously the only problem with this, that critical reading can be classed as different for every subject we look at. It will be different in Maths, Science and even Physical Education. However the base we are given in our English studies prepares us for the critical reading we will do at later stages and gives us the basic understanding of how to dissect and analyse a text at a basic level.

TL;DR
English can be seen as an important subject because at a basic level it does in fact teach Technical Writing, Critical Reading and Public Speaking.",,False,,t5_2qqcs,False,,,True,t3_15tn91,http://www.reddit.com/r/Teachers/comments/15tn91/the_importance_of_english_as_a_secondary_school/,

So, this is my 3rd year teaching English in California, and I'm not going to lie; it's been a struggle the whole way through. I've survived and even enjoyed a modicum of success--I've completed my BTSA training, I've never been let go, nor had a negative observation, but nothing has gotten any easier either. This year I am working at a charter school where I am responsible for creating a lot of the curriculum myself, and between time spent at work, and time spent at home grading, planning and designing materials, my wife and I estimate that I am working a 60-80 hour work week.  

I am thankful to be employed right now in this economy, but ultimately I am unhappy. I am young (mid-20's), married to a wonderful woman, have hobbies/interests, but right now I feel like I have time for none of those things. Everyday I get off work at 4 or 5 depending on the day, and then feel like I have 2-3 hours of work ahead of me. Weekends are a little better, but still a lot of my time is taken up grading, planning and making materials. I know that I could probably switch to another site where conditions might be better, but I am thinking of leaving education altogether.

I have been chocked to discover that a lot of children on their way to school drink energy drinks. Those drinks are quite dangerous because children don't know that they shouldn't drink too much of it.

I have classes with children who just can't sit down at all and focus on my lesson. I have checked the SEN register, I have sent emails to the SEN department to have those children checked, the results are negative. I have changed the way I teach them, I have tried lots of things.

I often see those same kids drinking energy drinks in front of the corner store just before school starts.

I have a feeling that those drinks are the cause of all this and was thinking to write a letter to my local MP to have them banned like alcohol.

So I had an interview at an elementary school for the PE position and I basically nailed the interview. I felt good going in, I have a lot of experience, I was prepared and over all did really well. 

At the end of the interview I asked why the current PE teacher was leaving, and the main person in the interview committee told me that they were actually interviewing him as well! He mentioned it was part of their procedure. I was really thrown off. It was actually my last question and I almost didn't ask, but things went so well I went for it. 

I've never heard of that. Right now I  don't really know what to expect. My thinking is either the previous guy didn;t do a good job so they opened it up including him or its just  weird procedure, that doesn't seem right. 

Anybody have experience with this?

Also, it dawned on me that I should use some of my current coworkers as references. What would /r/teacher say about emailing the principal with newer, more current references? These references have worked with me all year and seen me do the same job as the one I interviewed for today, where as the references I sent in already have seen me in different roles or are old (more than two years)

I'm not sure if anyone cares or was curious, but if you were/are here ya go:

I put in my notice. Things in the classroom have gotten better, but things with admin have only continued to get worse. I lied and said I needed to move back home to take care of a sick relative, but the principal made it clear she knows the real reason I'm leaving. It kills me to leave this job... I have grown to love my kids and I know I still love teaching. I just can't handle the excessive pressure and stress the admin is putting on me. Two other teachers from my grade quit last week. I at least gave the school 30 days to find someone else. 


**Edit:** I am getting the impression (which could be wrong!) that a lot of people think they know what they would do in my situation. Maybe you would never leave a school. Maybe you're so much better than me. My position will be open in another month. Feel free to apply. There is a reason this school couldn't fill this position until I applied. It had been an open position since last May. I was the first applicant when I applied in January. 

Regardless, it's my future on the line. I had to do what I thought was best for myself. I'm not going to let one bad position ruin my entire career, which is the direction this position was headed. I've learned a lot in this school, but I'm ready to move on. I'm too young to hate my job and I've decided it's not giving up if there was no chance for success (maybe you disagree, maybe you would keep trying even though your failure was predetermined. I can't do that). I know I haven't given many details about everything that happened with admin. The things I did say in other posts were just the tip of the iceberg. Imagine being a fresh out of college, optimistic teacher who has been torn down so much she is leaving the one thing she has wanted to do her whole life after only a couple of months doing it. I have lost all hope at this school. I'm not saying everyone has to agree with my decision, I don't expect you to, I just hope that people can see where I'm coming from and understand what led me to this choice. Maybe you'll forever judge me for it, maybe not. I know I did what I needed to do.

I had a really horrible class on Wednesday. We're talking really really bad. I am a Canadian teacher and I moved to England for my first teaching job. The kids here are definitely not what I'm used to! 

So on Thursday they were being really bad. Wouldn't sit down, wouldn't be quiet, wouldn't do any work, were shooting spit balls, etc. I was so angry. I got one of the support people to come in and yell at them, but it was too late. I was already angry-crying. I wasn't sad or upset, I was just so mad. Unfortunately when I'm mad, I cry. I sat on the computer and just clicked through slides while they wrote notes, but I'm positive they saw me as I heard someone whisper ""I think she's crying"". 

So I gave a bunch of the ring leaders after school detention for the next day. I thought that they would feel bad, but i was wrong. They came for detention and once again wouldn't shut up, wouldn't sit down, wouldn't do the work I set out for them, they ganged up on me and bullied me, they laughed in my face, one child claimed I had assaulted him because I tossed him a pencil THAT HE ASKED FOR and said he was going to sue me, etc. It was UNREAL. 

So, obviously they don't give a shit. But the big problem here is that in two weeks we have gotten through ZERO WORK. How do I push through when there are 20 bad kids and 2 good ones?

A little background first:

I am not a teacher and I have no experience teaching.  I am an Electrical Engineer from Iraq with a huge interest in Mathematics.

The problem we have in Iraq is that the teaching standards are very poor, teachers are lazy and there is a lack of accountability in the public education system (most schools are public).  So, they will generally teach nothing inside their classrooms.  Students are forced to take private classes, usually from the same public school teachers who sometimes purposely teach the important things in these private sessions only.

Long story short: it's a corrupt system.

I would like to prepare some educational videos that are tailored towards the Iraq grade 12 Mathematics curriculum.  Currently, no such educational videos exist online or offline.  Lots of people don't have access to the internet and / or don't know how to use Google properly.  I have the means to distribute the videos through CD's throughout all of Iraq.

I have studied the curriculum, past exams, available revision guides, etc.  Right now, I am thinking of teaching in a similar way to this guy: https://www.khanacademy.org/math/algebra/complex-numbers/complex_numbers/v/complex-roots-from-the-quadratic-formula

Each school district is allowed to design the system as they wish, which means the local union has to approve how the system is set up. 

The gist of our system is that you qualify for points based on criteria like number of failing grades given to students, number of sick days taken, number of hours of PD attended, and scores earned on a self-evaluation. There's also a school-wide component that is obviously outside of an individual teacher's control. No one knows how everything is weighted, but there's a $25,000 pot that is divvied up based on how many points are awarded across the entire district. The more teachers that apply, the less everyone gets. 

Last year I didn't even bother looking at the application because I assumed it was a waste of time (most of the teachers in the high school shared a similar sentiment). This year, I took a glance and realized that I could qualify for a decent chunk, mostly because of a 3 week long workshop I attended last summer. I plugged in all of my info and was told I earned 44.6 points. I have ZERO idea if that's a lot or a little. 

Today I found out that as a result of all of my hard work I was awarded $250 as my 'bonus.' I honestly had no idea what to expect, but I was hopeful it'd be closer to the $1k range, or least ~$600 which is half a paycheck for me. 

**TL; DR** I got a bonus of $250 because I'm a better than average teacher who spent 3 weeks in Arizona on my own dime last summer. 

What are your thoughts on a system like this? Do any of you have experience with something similar?

ITT ""our students would never do that, obviously it's the teachers fault that (kids failing, fights, ect.)"" and a very hostile environment. 

I left at the semester break, and spent time with family, worked part time, some time for myself, ect. 

Leaving mid-year obviously creates questions, and I got in the habit of just explaining it as family needs.While talking to acquaintances and such who didn't need to know all the details, I definitely stretched the truth about how much my family needed me to avoid giving the school a bad reputation or getting into unsavory topics. 

Evidently I got too into the stories, because while on an interview for this coming school year, I just couldn't keep my mouth shut and kept talking about how great it was to help my family, ect. They gave me an offer, which I probably would have gotten anyway--I do have great credentials and a fantastic fit for the job, and by that point word had gotten around that the school I left was becoming terrible-- but now the department head thinks I'm some saint who gave up a job and spent every day helping elderly relatives. I helped, but more of a ""take to grocery store and help with mild housework one day a week"", not the full time caretaker job I implied it was. 

So now I'm a) feeling guilty about this, and b) sort of freaking out that I lied on the interview and if they do some digging, it could be grounds to fire me. I know everyone stretches the truth on interviews, but I can't shake the bad feeling.

We have been successful so far in teaching them how to comprehend basic English instructions and getting them into local government schools. 

Our holiday sessions have been  concentrating on activities like spot the difference, rhymes etc.

Though school-time is around the corner, we think that they could benefit from the 1.5 hour evening classes that we conduct every other day(Monday-Wednesday-Friday.) So a partner and I have been assigned the task to come up with an 8 week curriculum and a subsequent teaching plan.

I was wondering if you guys could help me with deciding how I should go about designing a curriculum that'll appeal and interest this broad age-group while teaching them what they **absolutely** need to know.
Note that these are little kids who have ***no exposure whatsoever*** to the world in terms of books, television, video games etc. and fairly everything they know has been taught to them by our group of volunteers- essentially colours, shapes, alphabets, numbers, animals etc.
They speak Hindi at home that too just enough to hold basic conversation.

I started at an arts-focused high school 4.5 weeks ago. There are roughly 75 students enrolled and on a good day, 75% of them show up. Consistent attendance is not strong and most of the students have serious home problems (homelessness, abuse, etc.) as well as IEPs (ADD and ASD run very high; about 80% of them have IEPs).

My history is with arts magnet schools, gifted and talented, and honors/AP students. My typical classroom involves high-level thinking, lots of writing, and a lot of in-class discussion. I have very high expectations from my students. This school and these students are no exception.

I have assigned reading for my classes. I'm an English teacher, so what would anyone expect? I also assign a few creative projects here and there - things that allow the students to express their individuality and give them freedom of interpretation while still giving them structure.

About 10% of my students complete the homework. Quiz scores are abysmal even when I do everything I can to prepare them. I do not surprise them with assignments (I give them calendars and write everything on the whiteboard for the entire week).

I went to the principal about this today. I asked if it was a school-wide problem (if all of the teachers have a similar issue with homework completion), a class problem (I was brought in to replace a teacher who was very bad for the kids), or a personal problem (maybe they just didn't like me or take me seriously). She was quite surprised, then realized she'd forgotten to mention something very key: this school had an informal ""no homework"" policy. The teachers try to not give any work for the students to take home due to some of the very turbulent home lives some of them have.

I'm not unsympathetic. I understand some of my students have a lot of trouble. I've been flexible and understanding when students have issues. But this policy is not something I believe I can support. As I said above, I have and always will maintain high expectations for my students. I feel as if I back down on my homework (I truly don't give that much at all), I'm letting my integrity as a teacher slide and I'm letting some of the kids fall into a pattern of apathy and laziness (note that I said ""some"" - I still respect the fact that there are a few that have tough times even finding a place to sleep at night and perhaps reading Raisin in the Sun isn't that high on their priorities list). I do want to push them to succeed, but this isn't working and it seems the administration is frowning upon my attempts to have the students do anything that might force them into extra effort.

So what do I do? Should I revise my attitude as a teacher and try to focus on activities that can be done only in the classroom? How can I maintain continuity when every day is spent catching people up that haven't attended in three days? I'm absolutely losing myself because everyone's got some sort of special case and there's zero consistency no matter how hard I work.

My plan right now is to try to talk to the science teacher; he's about my age and started at the beginning of the school year. I want to see if the problem happens in his class too, what his personal homework policies are, and what has worked for him. I think this may help me start to see if there are things I can do.

I just . . . the ""no homework"" policy truly goes against what I stand for as a teacher. School doesn't stop the second they step outside the building. They should constantly be learning and they SHOULD be thinking about the lessons in a critical way. Can I get around my own philosophies? Do I need to mold the students to my philosophy and high expectations or do I need to modify my teaching style to accommodate the lax attitude toward outside work?

This has always worked until this school. I had to move from a city to an isolated small town for my husband's job (band). Coming from a city automatically placed me on the other teacher's watch list because ""I am bringing my big city teaching styles and will ruin the status quo and make them work more"" I dealt with the moody-bots and the gossip-bots without too much issues last year. 

This year, I became their target. They have gone after me and my husband. He is not affected too much since he is in another part of the school, I am in the middle of them. It has gone to starting rumors about me, posting on websites, the pointing and laughing and sabotaging my SPED students by refusing to help them in the CM room or changing their modifications in ARDS when the head SPED teacher is out. Honestly as far fetched as it sounds, it is like the examples in an old school bullying video. It is all very middle school behavior from them.  Husband finally caught them at it the other day and he was upset. I have a thick skin and usually can deal with this, but it has reached the point here where I hate to come to work and have often cried due to their gossip and rumors and name calling. 

Our hands are tied. We can't tell the principal he is best friends with these teachers and in the past when others have complained he has chewed out the person complaining because they should have stayed on their good side. He also believe anything they say. Also, complaining higher up could mean more problems, this is a SMALL town. 

I have to be here one more year due to some amazing opportunities in my husband's department that will look amazing on his resume. So what I need is some great advice on handling these women. I am looking at transferring to another school in the district but jobs are not open. The nearest town in 40 miles away so any other district is a commute.

By the time I'm finishing the sentence, they're looking off into space, and I pause in the *hope* that they're just still processing what I said. Au contraire. All that pause does is remind them that I'm still there, so after a few seconds, they finally look back at me, and all I get is ""...what?"" The eerie thing is that they both do that last part *exactly* the same way.

I've tried some more tactile approaches, which *appear* to be effective, until I try to bring them back into the more abstract. With the girl, I've spent *hours* trying to explain to her the concept of a half (fourth or fifth grade). If you just ask her what half of 6 is, she's likely to guess every number from one to ten thousand *but* three before getting her to pipe down and listen to an explanation. So I started using objects like pencils or erasers. I put some even number of objects on the table, and have her separate them into two halves. She even verifies that they are both exactly half by making sure the two groups have equal amounts. So if there were originally 8, I ask her how much is half of 8, and she'll say 4. I've repeated this activity with several numbers of objects in one sitting, followed by a recap of *why* the half quantity is what it is, but as soon as I take away the manipulatives and ask a simple question, she's back to guessing any number that pops into her head.

The boy isn't quite as bad, but the same problem exists. I just can't get him to follow a tactile demonstration long enough to be able to bring the idea into the abstract. I did similar activities where two erasers are worth five cents to find out how much 6 erasers would cost. The assignment sheet has bold writing at the top of it saying **the price of two erasers is five cents**. I made him read it aloud to me five times, but then as soon as I follow that by asking him ""how much do two erasers cost?"", his answer is just as likely to be 2 as it is 5, because those were the last two numbers he dealt with.

I just have no clue what to do when something like this happens.

I have had several thefts in that class, both school property, my own belongings, and several students have reported items missing from their bags, but without actually finding the missing items on a student, the school does nothing. I have a very good idea who took it (given information students have given me regarding previous thefts) but no way of proving it except the testimony of his classmates.

Should I go around the school's administration and file a police report? How can I deal with this issue or talk to a room of 16 year old students about elementary school morals? Is it ethical to suspend all labs, demos, and activities for the rest of the year (effectively depriving the other 99% of the students from their educational rights) in order to protect the school's and my own property? How can I effectively/accurately get information from the other students regarding who may have been stealing?

EDIT: This gave birth to some lively conversations! I took anonoman925's advice and 11 students came forward to say that they saw the student I suspected take it. I called admin, campus police, security, etc. for TWO WHOLE DAYS without a response. When they did finally show up 3 days later, all they did was ask him if he took it, of course he said no, and then sent him back off to my class. Admin said that if it was not on his person then they were done handling the issue (no punishment). Didn't even take a look at the written statements from the students. At this point, I'm going to file an official police report naming that student and citing my 11 written statements as proof of his guilt.

Thanks for taking the time to read this; I have a question for more experienced teachers out there.

I've been placed in a bit of a weird classroom this year: it's out of a private college for an adult high school program. Whole gamut of students, from those just learning basic math to those doing Pre-Calc to English 12 to Food and Nutrition to Work Experience. Rarely do students enroll in the same electives, and the program is continual-intake, so even if they do, they're not at the same point in the curriculum.

But - I don't have any control of the curriculum! The college hasn't written any curriculum, so they use curriculum from the school district... which is controlled and marked by the school district. It's all online, so we assess, register, and help the students along their way to graduation. 

Right now, I feel like I'm trapped - I want to do more with my class; I want to engage, teach, have discussions and lessons and explore new ideas... but I don't feel like I can. Any activity I do takes (very) precious time away from their accredited curriculum work, and leads to longer graduation times and more time away from work for these adults. 

I... dammit, I don't know what to do. It's driving me nuts. I'm in the classroom with the students for five hours as they work along, just waiting for them to ask questions. I try to do a few activities each day, but often I'm met with resistance (and, as paying adults, I don't really have many disciplinary options). Their scholarly ranges are so diverse that it's damned difficult to find common ground, and even if I do, how can I justify taking time away from their accredited work?

I play games with them, but it often feels like I'm just burning time. 

So, in short, HELP!

On one hand I feel absolutely useless and ineffective when I am sick and worn out but on the other hand I don't want to take more time off because I feel like it reflects poorly on me and I don't want it to be held against me at the end of the year.
Am I right to be paranoid or should I just relax and take the sick day?

I had such high aspirations for teaching, but now I'm questioning everything. I'm in a lower economic school with mostly blacks, Hispanics, and ELL students. I'm a little white country girl, 24, and all of my students are taller than me. I have never taught this demographic before and feel completely out of my element and unprepared. My students are vulgar, disrespectful, full of hate and negativity, and completely uninterested in anything I have to say. I care about these students and have tried every trick of the trade they taught me in college. Nothing works. Now I'm a pretty strict teacher, but I do believe that every student can be reached. However, so far, no success on my end. There are over 10 new teachers at this school because so many quit last year, and we're all feeling overwhelmed and discouraged.

Here are my options:

Do I stay at this school, because these children need me? They need a caring, strong, positive role model in their life to help them make better decisions and be a better individual. They need more teachers that will not give up on them no matter how ugly they treat those around them. Do I stay and become that solid rock for them?

-OR-

Do I leave this school for another to benefit my own happiness? I am miserable every day because I feel like a failure. I'm beating my head against a brick wall that is my students' willingness to learn. Do I go to a different school with a different demographic where teachers can see the differences their making?

As much as I dreamed, I am no Hillary Swank and this is not ""Freedom Writers."" Advice?

UPDATE - Thanks so much to all the support and encouraging words! I even got a handful of helpful tips to keep in mind for the next year!

For some background info, I'm a male senior in high school who plans on teaching either English or some sort of humanities class like art history. I also would love to teach at the high school level.

Anyway, some of the responses I've received when expressing my interest in education have been negative. Some teachers have said that I'm ""crazy."" Others have brought up the pay and how it isn't worth it.  A few have suggested that I go out of state (I live in Florida) due to the poor changes made in recent years.  
Other than that, my social skills are lacking, and I'm hoping to change that when I'm in college. I'm a bit shy, but I love talking to people, especially about books and art. Teaching seems like an awesome profession, like being able to talk to students and helping them understand concepts and ideas that will help them later on in life. It honestly seems like the ideal profession because teachers can change lives, even if on a small scale.

I have a few concerns, though, and I figured this would be the best place to ask:
Is it worth being a teacher?
Will my social problems interfere if I don't change them soon?
Also, this might be too personal, but is it possible for sexuality to interfere with becoming a teacher?
Pretty much any tips for getting involved with education helps, too.

Sorry if this is unorganized and scrambled. I'm just seeking clarity, I guess. Thanks!

I had a little mishap last week with my mentor teacher and she explained what I was doing wrong and what needed to change. Then I got an e-mail today from an advisor saying they would like to speak with me. He went over a detailed report on my behavior and professionalism in the classroom and here was the main excerpt

""Justin does not show innitiative in the classroom. He is frequently found sitting, working on his own school work, rather than walking around the classroom positively interacting with the students. Even after he was asked, on two separate occasions, to walk around the classroom, monitor student progress, and assist students when needed, he was still found sitting at my back table working on SU work. Although this is ""not his first rodeo"" (as quoted by him), he is very unsure of himself and his role in the classroom. He needs to show more professionalism in his interactions with the students. He needs to remember that he is an adult, a mentor, and a teacher and not their friend.""

Please, before anyone makes a comment, the whole ""rodeo"" thing was a complete joke from myself just trying to be funny and introduce myself when I first contacted my mentor teacher back in September. I had done field experiences at a previous community college, and that's what I meant by it. I guess she found it disrespectful, but I had no intention of it being like that.

As for everything else, she talked about this all with me last week and I thought everything was fine. I even went the very next day and improved upon myself, taking her advice into consideration and working on what I did wrong. I haven't seen been to her classroom since then! And she sent this report yesterday, so, it's weird. Like, why did she not just send this last week when all these issues were occurring?

Anyways, I e-mailed her today to let her know I was sorry and that I had met with my advisor and would be working towards being more professional and all. She claims I act too much like a friend to the students, and not their teacher, which is hard for me. I'm stuck in this ""summer camp"" persona from working as a counselor every summer where I am the kid's friend, and we goof around and joke and what not. It's a habit I need to get out of. But like other than that, I feel like every time I step in her classroom I'm going to be doing something wrong now. Does /r/teachers have any tips for me? The great thing is that she wants me to finish out the semester in her classroom and did not tell my advisor she would like me to leave. That was a huge relief as a lot of students who have to meet for these reports usually don't get a second chance and get kicked out of their placements. I'm very fortunate this did not happen to me, and it just sucks because this is the first block of my program, and I've been getting great grades in my methods courses, and then this happens.

Is anyone else dealing with these types of policies?,16,3,31,http://www.reddit.com/r/Teachers/comments/121eq9/test_retakes_and_no_late_penalties_is_anyone_else/,"My entire district has a grading policy for allowing students to retake tests and they cannot be marked down for late work. The policy was mandated last school year. To retake a test, the student must complete a reteaching session (which equates meeting with me outside of regular class, and often means giving up portions of my lunch and prep) and then schedule a time to take the second test. Our late policy works similar to other behavior issues - first a detention during lunch, then after-school detention, then Saturday-detention if the work still isn't completed. We are **not** permitted to lower the student's grade for being late. 

I am beyond frustrated with all of this. I teach Honors Physics, Honors Chemistry, and General Chemistry to mainly juniors and seniors, and Honors Physical Science to freshmen. My administrators do not acknowledge my ""preparing them for college"" reason for wanting to abolish these policies. All they see are the shiny GPAs, meanwhile I'm drowning in 2x the prep and grading. 

Is anyone else dealing with policies like this? 

**Edit:** Thanks for the support and advice everyone. Getting to know different perspectives and policies is refreshing. I'm still fighting with accepting the policy though. I understand its about content and making sure the students know it, but at what point do we teach them how to function with real-world deadlines? Do we just let them get hit with reality unprepared? College is rigorous. I think about my anxious students and worry if they will be able to handle the stress of a one-try environment. I don't want to be misunderstood. I do work with these students a lot to help reduce their test anxiety. Some of these students want to be doctors, nurses, engineers - I feel like I am doing them a disservice by not offering a chance to learn how to function in a high stakes environment. I also think about my students who procrastinate and view the detentions for late work as a study hall. How are we helping them by enabling their procrastination?

I went to all the meetings and I was treated as a full time teacher. I got this job right after I finished my student teaching and graduated. I enjoyed it, but it was definitely difficult and I learned a lot.

That being said, I just got hired as a 6th grade Language Arts teacher at the same school. I feel overwhelmed. My classroom is almost entirely set up, but I still have a million questions. Could anybody please help me?

Sorry I haven't had the time to reply back to every comment, but I will definitely update after my first few weeks!!

Classroom management: That was probably the hardest area for me. It took me a while, but I finally got all of my classrooms under control last year. Still, I don't want to wait a while. I want to take control from the beginning. One problem is, I am going to be the youngest teacher in the 6th grade team. I know a lot of people say it doesn't matter how young you are, but I do think it makes me look less intimidating. Not to mention, I am 5'2"" and look very young (you don't know how many times teachers have mistaken me for a student). I dress very professionally and try to dress my age. Is there anything I can do to counter students not taking me as seriously? I am 23 by the way. 

Furthermore, are there any general tips for managing classrooms for new teachers? I have learned some techniques, but I am open to hearing more.

Right now, I have my classroom set up in traditional rows. I have heard  a lot of teachers do not like that because it seems old-fashioned, but I do feel like I will have more control in my classroom that way. However, what works for you and why?

Bulletin Boards: Ok, this may sound a little stupid, but I have one last empty bulletin board in my room and I'm not really sure what to do with it. I do have an area to hang work, but I don't know...Sorry, if that's way too general. I guess I'm just seeing what answers I'll get.

Discipline: What kind of discipline system works in your classroom? I know this goes along with classroom management, but I thought I'd make it separate.

Lesson planning: Any general tips that have helped you out?

Pressure/Stress: What do you do to help you through those difficult days? Last year I took my job very seriously, and it almost took over my life. That may sound silly because I was only a substitute, but I wanted to have a very good recommendation from the principal! I know teaching is tough no matter what, but I still want to feel human at the end of the day, too.

I guess those are the areas I am most fearful about. My last one is teaching Language Arts in general because I really feel like I'm being ""thrown"" in there. I am meeting with the other Language Arts teacher I'll be working with Monday, but if you want to throw any advice in about Language Arts, I would be very appreciative!

I graduated in May and was hired for my first teaching position in 4th grade ELA/SS position. I'm super excited, but also super nervous. I feel like I'm am going to start the year blindfolded with only bits and pieces of information. For example: 

*I was told I will be teaching ELA/SS to two classes for 165 minutes each, and also an English to Spanish speakers class for 60 minutes out of the day (despite not speaking any Spanish). If you do the math, that adds up to 6 and 1/2 hours. However, we are only in school for 7 hours, so that means I would have no planning period. I'm pretty sure that schools are required to give teachers a 45 minute planning period. I have no one to ask for clarification. The principal who hired me has retired and the new principal doesn't begin until July. So I'm not sure how to handle this situation.

*There are four 4th grade teachers. While I'm pretty sure two are for math/science and the other is for bilingual ELA/SS, I have no idea what the other four do. I also don't know if I have to coordinate with them when I am developing my homework assignments, take home folders, etc. I don't know if I should wait until August to find out, or just plan ahead over the summer and then be prepared to toss my ideas if we have to coordinate.

Those are just a couple examples. Anyway, I know a lot of this will be answered when I start in August, but I'm just a bit nervous about starting the year so blind. I like to be prepared and over plan everything, but I'm finding that very difficult to do when I don't fully know what I should be planning for. I guess what I'm asking is: is this a normal, to feel like you were hired but have no idea how your job will start? I know that Harry Wong says it is, but I suppose I didn't think it would happen to me until it actually happened. 

**TL;DR**: Was hired for a first year teaching position, have no idea and feel totally in the dark about starting the school year until mid August. Is that normal?",,False,,t5_2qqcs,False,,,True,t3_vj6ru,http://www.reddit.com/r/Teachers/comments/vj6ru/concerns_from_a_first_year_teacher/,

Here are my issues: 

* I already have an associate contract for next year, but it is only considered a part-time aid position. 

* This job is an hour away, and I cannot move house anytime soon. 

* School starts in a week, and I will have 5 separate classes to prep for: Accounting, Management, Web Design, Personal Finance, and Intro. to Business. 

* This will be my first full-time job out of school so it only pays $35,000.

I asked if I could request same-day vacation time if I couldn't make it, and he said it would not be approved. Then I asked about adding my wife to the insurance and it was triple the cost - $500 per month! Then he casually mentions that there were two other candidates for the position, I told him he should offer the job to one of them. Thanks, but no thanks!

I am supposed to start back in about three weeks and I desperately want to quit. I am being transferred from high school to middle school and this was sort of the straw that broke the camel's back, along with health issues.

Is it foolish of me to resign right now, without another job lined up? I have enough money in my savings to survive comfortably for 6 months (or ascetically for longer). My friends say quit; my parents and boyfriend say start the school year and then quit if I get another job...but I don't feel right doing that. 

I also want to quit right now so I can focus exclusively on job hunting instead of planning for the new school year--I am moving from 11th grade honors English to 6th/7th grade reading, so I am going to have to totally re-haul. 

**TL;DR** i want to quit teaching before the school year starts. I have about $15,000 saved up, I'm young, and I am willing to do anything other than teaching right now. Should I go ahead and quit like my gut tells me to do or listen to the reasoning of trusted family members?

[EDIT 1]
Wow! Thanks for all the replies so far! I guess maybe I didn't lay down everything clearly enough: 

(1) I do not see myself teaching for the rest of my life. I am going to quit whether it's now or in a year. I enjoy it, and daresay I am actually a pretty good teacher, but I WILL burn out by year 5 at best if I try to make this my career. I understand how hard the first year is. I get it. I know myself well enough to know that I can't do this as a career [if things in public education and in my subject area continue to go the way they're going.]

(2) I would like more advice about the practicality of quitting and searching for a job--should I stay secure where I am now or take a huge risk (and be more conscientious of my new school and students!) by quitting now? I have two options--quit now, or suck it up for another year. I don't care if can't return to teaching, I just want opinions on the foolhardiness of a decision to quit in terms of economics and finding a new job in a new field.

My boyfriend recently asked me how much I spend per month on my students and I estimated about $200/month.  He suggested I reach out to other teachers of younger-aged students.  Because I don't use standard curriculum books as many of the older grades do and instead build most of my own curriculum, I find myself coming up with ideas that ultimately call for items to be bought.

I am given $500 at the end of each year to spend on my class by the school but as I think many of you might know, 500 bucks goes fast if you need new furniture for the play-center or a new radio.

For Halloween, Christmas, birthdays, and now Easter, I've been buying things from the dollar-store or Walmart to make goody bags for the kids.  Things like tissues and baby wipes are used up SO quickly and even when I request donations to be made by parents, most of them don't send anything in.  Books I have are mostly used, old, and get torn easily - especially by some of my rough boys.  A lot of my spending goes towards those things.

I'm in my early 20s and this is my second year teaching.  I sometimes feel my eagerness to be an awesome/fun/engaging teacher pushes me to spend more than I should.  But I don't see a way around it.  I want to give my students meaningful experiences and if I think of something amazing or see online what another teacher has done that I know my kids will love, I NEED to go out and buy the materials so we can do it.  Of course not all lessons call for things to be bought.  But I like to do many activities that the kids can take home so their families can keep them.  My boyfriend thinks that I'm doing too much and that I should tone it down a bit.  I don't have huge amounts of money to spare (obviously..) and I don't even have my own family to support yet so..I'm not sure how this out-of-pocket spending is going to work in the long-run when I get my own children and have more bills to pay.

I'm curious how other teachers feel about this.  How do you find yourself using money during the year for your class?",,False,,t5_2qqcs,1364171872.0,,,True,t3_1ay055,http://www.reddit.com/r/Teachers/comments/1ay055/outofpocket_spending_on_classroom_supplies/,

The devastating events at Sandy Hook have once again drawn attention to school safety. The conversations about police presence, gun control, and mental health are all reasonable and necessary. But do you know what one thing I never hear (except from those of us in the schools)... the simple ability to lock our classroom and library doors from the inside. At best, the teacher has to open the door and use his/her key to lock the door. In my case, in the library, i have three entrances, each about 20 feet apart, that I must go outside to lock with a key, and at the main double door entrance I have to secure top and bottom locks before locking the second door. None of these doors can be locked from within. Due to the nature of the library usage (a copier is in the library) the doors cannot be secured throughout the day. This all presumes the teacher has the keys on his/her person at all times , which is unlikely. Of course, at this point no substitute can lock a door, nor can a student.
It would cost money, probably $100 a door to have interior turn locks installed on each door, a large expenditure when multiplied by the number of classroom doors, but a small price to pay to protect the students and staff.
Sadly, It may be impossible to prevent all future tragedies, but as you look for ways to secure our schools for the students and staff, please consider the simplicity of a door that locks quickly from the inside.

Nothing weird here. I like to think i'm one of the brightest young teachers at my school. 

I learned in college to be ultra careful around students of the opposite sex because a lawsuit can come out of, literally nothing. How am I, a young male teacher, supposed to be comfortable mentoring a sophomore in high school who is of the opposite sex?

I feel like everyone is so primed to think that teachers are trying to take advantage of students. We are told in faculty meetings to be careful. They send out memos (very large school system) to remain vigilant and safe in regards to our interactions with students. The news just goes nutty when a teacher does something wrong. What about the 99% of other teachers who are actually trying to make a difference?

In my case, this girl is very interested (and talented) in the subject which I teach and i'm trying to get her to consider majoring in it in college. I've been coaching her after school and she's really taken to the subject. I have a somewhat similar personality so I think I am able to connect with her regarding this, whereas other teachers have not. 

This meant that she's spent a good amount of time in my classroom working on projects or just loosely chatting about the subject and life at the school. 

Maybe i'm getting paranoid, but it just seems like it's getting harder and harder to be a true ""teacher"" nowadays.

Situation has not really improved. My misery lasted right through the Easter holidays (more time crying in the foetal position) and something kinda snapped inside me during the first week back. I now find myself in a state of calm caused by ceasing to care.

As an educator, I feel like a piece of my soul just died.

I did some job searching and just got offered a position in the education sector (not teaching). It's a pay cut but not an epic one and I'd be in a great position to do some further study via distance education.

So, I have a meeting on Tuesday with the principal where I am going to try and explain why I am going to leave what was supposed to be my dream job after a semester. I will be citing family health issues (true) and unexpected professional opportunities (also true) but will also have the unpleasant job of looking them in the eye and telling them that the school is failing many of the students.

Any advice on how to deliver such new to someone MUCH higher up the food-chain than oneself would be welcome.

**************

Hi team,

This year I started at a very new, very small school. Getting this gig was the culmination of working for the school as a contractor helping them through the inspection process (writing semester-long units from scratch etc etc) and lots of long chats with the principal. I was promised autonomy, I was promised access to technology, I was promised...well, a bunch of stuff.

Team, it is _fucked up_. First off, this is an 'alternative school'. Don't sling shit, I was in one 'til I hit high school and they usually work pretty well. However, the ideology underpinning this place has clearly been interpreted in a few different ways, and we're at the stage where the teachers who started the place feel under constant attack and bad-mouth the administration all the time in front of the kids. 

Also, as this is a new school there are a lot of set-up costs, which means the school is saying things to me like 'You don't need computers, here's a room to teach in! We bought this building so you could teach in it!' which translates as 'try and educate a group of children who enter the school every day with the latest smartphones using nothing but a whiteboard'.

Oh yeah, the kids. We've got some good ones, but we've also got kids on the Autism spectrum, kids with ADD, kids who have tested as having incredibly poor processing and reasoning skills, kids who are demonstrating nascent sociopathic tendencies, and of course some special little flowers who just don't think the rules apply to them. And we have no special education support _at all_. Hell, we don't even have a set of rules that are enforced by all staff members all the time.

OK, I hear you say, sounds rough. But you're not the only teacher. Band togther! Unite to overcome your difficulties! Work as a team!
I. Fucking. Wish.
The other teaching staff have aligned themselves against the administration, and as the new guy I am seen as somewhere between a plant and a saboteur, who is clearly there to ruin the magical (no matter how utterly broken) learning environment they are trying to create. I am shunned during the day unless I ask someone a direct question. I share an office with one of the staff members and it took them 6 weeks to start using it.

This is killing me. Teaching has been a rewarding career for the 3 years I've been in so far, and I can say without hesitation that every day I'm at this place is making me love it less. I find myself waking up at 4am trying to plan for conversations with students when they transgress and they know I have no consequences I can give them. I spend half my commute with a sick feeling in my stomach. I eat alone most days. I used to laugh every single day teaching - now I don't laugh until I get home in the evening. I’ve been reduced to sobbing in the foetal position several times.

I just want to get out. I've turned the problem over and looked at it from so many angles, and the only conclusion I can reach is that the problems won't go away without staff solidarity and hands-on work from the administration. Neither seem likely. 

This is simply the worst professional experience I have ever had at any job, ever. And I feel like a failure every single day.

There was one instance where an Native American girl was denied right to walk, right to diploma and charged $1000 for wearing an eagle's feather on her cap.

A boy was praised for going against his valedictorian speech to recite the Lord's Prayer even though it was against the rules.

A boy had his microphone muted for straying from his speech after a warning mid speech as well.

So opinions of additions Reddit? 

EDIT: With all the responses I figured I should post my opinion on this now.

I think the first occasion with the Native American girl is insane. Yes she did break a rule, it doesn't matter what she did, but she broke a rule and punishment needs to be taken or the school would be no better than a school letting a kid get away with break a rule because it was a Christian. Granted an $1000 fine was way too far and they should of had people doing robe checks for this exact reasons.

The second event infuriates me to no end. I have nothing against religion, nor people practicing it in public but the fact that the kid went against what he was told not to do and the event came out like ""Aww you little scamp, you weren't supposed to go off your script, but what are going to do, you love Jesus so much!"" Really? But then again, I did see a comment arguing that what he did wasn't breaking any rules but I really don't have the mental capacity at 7:30 a.m. to read without coffee.

The third event pleases me though, the kid as breaking a rule so the school took action, they gave him a chance and he tried to play V on everyone and lost when they cut the mic off for good.

I felt comfortable with him, so I began to talk about my personal problems a bit. 

I didn't want to make him feel uncomfortable or overwhelmed so I started off by talking about small things, like how I'm insecure with my face. I spoke to him at lunch, about a total of five times in the couple of weeks. He ended up making me cry twice. In our last conversation I implied that I was depressed/suicidal. (I think he got the implication. I'm not completely sure.) He suggested that I use writing as an outlet. I asked if he could read my writing. He paused and wore a poker face. He said that he could, but if he detected something off, he'd have to report it. He said that he didn't know if I wanted that. He then suggested for me to go speak to the school counselors. The bell rang so I just excused myself to go my next class. 

I went back to his class later that day. I said that I was okay and he just nodded. I explained that I was upset because he referred to the counselor thing. I took it as he not wanting to deal with it instead of standard procedure. I paused to let him respond but he just said okay so I continued. I asked if he intended it to be as not wanting to deal with it. He said no. He said that he wants to help, but didn't have the training to do so. Before I left I apologized for possibly making him uncomfortable. 

Tomorrow is the last day of school. I know I can talk to him at lunch again next year, but I don't know if it'll be different as he will no longer be my teacher. (I need another letter of rec from him so I have to talk to him regardless.) I still want to talk to him about my thoughts if I need to. I don't think I'm looking for advice. I think I'm just looking for an outlet. Was it bad of me to confide in him in the first place?

Background: The position is to teach High School English. I'm coming into teaching after completing a non-traditional program. After graduating from the flagship public university (with a less than stellar GPA), I entered the workforce and worked as a writer, editor, and proofreader for 5 years. I came back to teaching as an adult. I have a 4.0 GPA in my program.

I have one year of teaching experience in a private, progressive elementary school that I helped get off the ground. On top of my regular teaching duties, I was the technology touchpoint for students and staff. I kept technology working, introduced new programs, and trained staff on implementing technology in their classrooms.

I completed that year before my student teaching, left on good terms, and have a very strong letter of recommendation from the founder of that school.

**Edit** Thanks for your help, Reddit. Had the interview this morning, and things went very well. It's going to be stiff competition, but I think I have a decent shot. Some of your questions definitely came up.

Most of us had at least one terrible teacher when we were students; I would imagine that most of us probably work with at least one terrible teacher.

By ""terrible"" I mean absolutely no interest in actually teaching; consistently disrespectful to students, parents, and colleagues; incompetent at any or all aspects of the job (grading, record-keeping, interpersonal relations, etc.).

Students and parents come to me all the time to complain about a handful of my fellow teachers. I tell them all the same thing: ""There's nothing I can do. You should take these steps: Write down all of your complaints; try to find other people who have similar complaints &amp; persuade them to put their complaints in writing; present the stack of written complaints to an administrator and demand that action be taken.""

But of course, sometimes even that course of action produces no results. 

I would assume that in non-union districts, principals can fire whoever they want when they have a legitimate reason (or, for that matter, on a whim or as the result of bias). In union districts, principals have a harder time firing terrible teachers and usually try to persuade them to transfer to another school. But that's not really solving the problem, is it? That teacher just becomes someone else's problem.

I belong to a union and I think teachers need union protection, but at the same time, I think that unions' usual solutions for terrible teachers is also terrible: they either want ""retraining"" for those teachers while either keeping them in the classroom (and so the students suffer while the teachers supposedly learn how to be better teachers), or they want to retrain those teachers while they draw their full salary (seems unfair), or they want to simply place those teachers in a  [reassignment center](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reassignment_centers) while they await placement at some new educational facility ... but they never get placed because word gets around about how poor their pedagogical skills are.

NB: I am presuming a class of 25-30 students

Teams of five:

-	A slave

-	A soldier

-	A merchant OR farmer

-	A member of the Senate OR part of the Caesar’s ‘court’

-	A priest OR ambassador from a friendly country


Take the period you are studying (be it the Republic, the Empire, or the whole shebang) and allot each team an equal portion of time to cover – I’d suggest a minimum of 50 years per team.

Each group is responsible for crafting an 8-10 minute presentation explaining what a time-traveller will need when visiting their particular period. This can range from the obvious (differences in clothing, advances in technology etc etc) to the subtle (alterations in foreign policy, changing patterns of worship). 

The presentation should be made using a combination of image-only slides (consider a variation on the PechaKucha presentation format to keep things moving) and physical objects to be handed out. 

Students should also have at least two member of the team presenting in costume (partial or full), with the emphasis on changes in clothing between their chosen period and the one on either side – a nice chance for them to chat with other groups and compare notes.

Each team should also prepare a 1-2 page handout in the style of a Lonely Planet cheat-sheet to be handed out at the end of the presentation. This sheet should both summarise and value-add to their presentation; for instance, some handy phrases in Latin, names of important or prominent people to name-drop during conversations, and a map of the Empire showing recent border skirmishes or main trading partners.

This is nowhere near a complete idea, but I thought it might be an option for those of you nearing the end of the school year and starting to make plans for what and how you will teach in the 2013/2014 school year.

-Engaging students in areas I feel it is tough to do labs/very wordy and abstract topics: mitosis/meiosis, molecular genetics (DNA--&gt;RNA--&gt;Protein), cell differentiation, and photosynthesis/respiration.

-Differentiating instruction for the highest highs and lowest lows. I have a handful of students that ace everything and a handful of students that can't pass a quiz to save their life. Some of my highest highs are very immature, so when I try making things tough they can be immature unless I babysit them. However, my lowest lows need my attention.

-Vocabulary strategies that work well for BIOLOGY. I've been suggested LINCs, and that is a great strategy, but it doesn't work well for everything. 

-Review games. I'm always looking for something new.

-Reading strategies.  How can I get them to read?  I've been suggested things from those above me (administration, C&amp;I people), but they just don't work.  Asking ""I wonder"" or ""let's figure out how this works"" doesn't seem to click for my high schoolers.

I'm a teacher that likes to show then tell.  I like to make them think, I rarely do bookwork/busy work, and I want them to work things out on their own.  However, I struggle with those topics specifically and I feel like I hear complains almost everyday. Plus, I'm exhausted!!

Let them ask questions, and ask if they have any questions.  Among the important things, explain to them how to determine factual information as opposed to sensationalism.  Be sure to talk about inequalities of how the media is presented based on various factors (minorities, religions views, etc.).

So basically at the end of the semester they encourage us to have student do anything that they missed through out the semester in order to earn their credits. I have been allowing students to write quizzes or tests they missed throughout the semester so it doesn't turn into a scramble at the end. 

Recently at a department meeting the learning leader ( who teaches only physics 30) told us it is department policy to give an automatic zero if the student is absent for an assessment. I feel like this is contradicting the fact that admin wants us to do everything we can to ensure student success especially with the students with a more vocational path.

A little background. It's my third year teaching. I teach AP English Lang/Comp and senior English inclusion at a large urban high school. My AP kids are great, there's no issue. My ""regular"" classes are a challenge. They're seniors, it's December, they are generally pretty low-skilled, and a good amount are graduating a semester early so the senioritis is pretty intense. 

Most of my students in the regular classes dislike English or are ambivalent about it. It's a class they have to take so that they can graduate. They tell me they hate reading and if a book is boring, they won't attempt to read it or do the work. I have three sections of this class. One of my classes is doing really well and seems to be into the book, but the other two are basically nightmares. They decided after a few days of *Lord of the Flies* (all senior teachers are teaching it) they disliked it and are responding by falling asleep in class, playing games on their phones, listening to music, or texting during class. I wake them up and ask them to put their phones away but it doesn't seem to ""stick"". They just don't seem to care at all.

I really try to make the book not boring. I tried to make it more engaging by assigning short reading assignments outside of class so we could do more interesting activities in class, but so few students did it that it seemed pointless. Many students told me that they never get homework in English and that even if they did, they wouldn't do it. I even gave reading quizzes just to try to get them to do the reading, but so many kids copied off of each other because they didn't read that that didn't work either.

So I've resorted to reading most of the book in class. I hate doing this because it leaves little time to do anything else, and it *is* boring, but otherwise I really do not believe 90% of the students would read or understand the book. I try to give high-level assignments that I think will challenge them and make them think critically about what we've been reading, but they're so disinterested in the book most don't even attempt to do it. It's an excellent book and I try to put my own passion and enthusiasm into it, but nothing I try to do seems to work beyond a class period or two.

I have a good rapport overall with my classes and am told by both students and administrators that I'm an effective teacher. The kids have told me that they like me and my class, they just don't like the book or reading in general. The other teachers in my department report that they are having the same issue.

If this continues, the next few weeks of class are going to be completely awful. I feel like this is sucking out my own passion for teaching. Also, I feel like typing this makes me sound awful. I love to teach and I love my students. I don't want to get burned out because of their apathy. I care - a lot - and I think that's why this is making me so frustrated. Does anybody have any advice at all? Any ideas for lessons that would engage the kids and help me keep my sanity and enthusiasm? Can anyone even just commiserate?

My contact with him was limited by my choice after that point for the remainder of the school year. This year, I have recently come into contact with this student again, and will continue to do so for the remainder of this school year. I do my best to avoid any contact with him both in (if possible) and out of the classroom.

I just ignore him. I don't look at him. I don't talk to him. I act as if I can't hear him. Unfortuately, this doesn't seem enough for him. I was coteaching in a classroom for the last 3 days. I made it a point to tell the other teacher about our history, and it was agreed that I would avoid working with him. Every time I had to walk by his desk, he would make some rude, snide, or disrespectful comment. I just ignored him. He never said it loudly enough for the other teacher to hear it, but loudly enough for me and the students near by to hear it. Yesterday, I observed him on his cell phone, which he had hidden in his notebook, for most of the hour.(This school has a zero tolerance policy). I didn't say anything to him, but the AP happened to come into the classroom, and I made him aware of the situation. I later learned that he denied it to both the AP and his teacher. Anyway, today was a repeat of much of the same. He was on his cell phone all hour (hidden in a shirt on his desk). When I was trying to work with other students, he would say ""Don't listen to her! She's not the teacher!"" or "" I hate her. She just irritates me"" blah, blah, blah. I have simply had enough. I told administrators that I shouldn't have to tolerate this kind of behavior. I am doing nothing to instigate his hostility. I need help trying to figure out what to do. If it continues, I simply cannot continue to work at this school. It is intolerable.

Super Edit: Pulled from the comments because my mom finally made a reddit account: 

""First, I would like to clarify some information. My contact with this student is in the capacity of a guest/substitute teacher. Additionally, I was only a co-teacher in this classroom. Before, the start of class, I discussed how this student feels about me with the teacher in charge, and it was her decision that I avoid contact with him. He would not welcome my attentions in any capacity. He will not allow me to help educate him. I harbor no ill will or animosity towards this student. My job entails that I write students up for breaking school policy. That is what occured last year. For me, that is where the incident ends. I enforce school policy in a fair and equitable way. I do not and cannot take student misbehavior personally. However; this student cannot seem to move past this. To complicate the matter, he falls under the Special Education umbrella, and is labled EI. The reason I have chosen to ignore his recent behavior is because to confront him would escalate the situation in a manner that would neither benefit him, other students, nor me. His comments are not made directly to/at me. That is not his modus operandi. He, instead, prefers to make the comment in my vicinity so that I, and those around him, can hear it. If I were to address his comments, he would deny saying them. He does not own his behavior. He seems to thrive on negative attention. When he made classroom transgression (the cell phone violation) I brought it to the attention of the teacher in charge and the AP. When he was questioned about it, he denied that it occurred. This precipitated my decision to document his behavior. I recorded every comment that he made about me, and recorded every hour and minute that I witnessed him on his cell phone. I have given this information to administration, and am currently waiting to hear from them on how they would like me to handle the situation. It is not my intention to get this student suspended. I am trying to get him the help he needs. I find it heartbreaking that he is choosing to react to situations in a negative and harmful manner. It is jeopardizing his ability to receive a quality education, and this type of behavior can negatively impact his ability to function in the real world, and that is intolerable to me.""

I've had a lot of great opportunities since I've graduated high school.  I feel that I owe a lot of my success, drive and passion to a particular high school teacher that helped show me that learning is both satisfying and rewarding and would love to write him a letter showing my appreciation.  What kinds of things should I mention in the letter/omit so that he will really like it?

Conclusion:

Ultimately,  I was in his calculas course for 3 classes: honors calc, ap calc ab, ap calc bc.  In this time, he fostered my interest in mathematics as well as a general eagerness to learn and an insatiable curiosity.  I was a very bad high school student that would skip my work, sleep in class and appear uninterested.  However, I did well and graduated in the top 3% of my 600 student class.  He was very calm and kind in nature, and put in time outside of school to help tutor his students around ap exam time.  In the end, I believe he helped shape my attitude for the better.

I graduated high school in 2009.  Fast-forward 3 years.  I'm in my 3rd year of earning my bachelors degree in Engineering with a minor in Mathematics.  I plan on going to graduate school once I graduate and last year I had the opportunity to perform research at a major research university.  This semester I'm on a Co-op with a large technology company.  And this summer I will be performing engineering research at MIT.  I am beyond excited and I don't believe I'd be where I am without the influence of him.

I'm sorry that was so verbose.  Basically I want to write a letter to show my appreciate and how he impacted me but I don't want it to sound like I'm bragging.  Any suggestions/tips?


tl;dr- Tips on how to write a meaningful letter of appreciate to my high school Calculus teacher from 3 years ago?

Successful Results! r/Teachers, what are your 
success stories?",14,2,6,http://www.reddit.com/r/Teachers/comments/qjp90/awesome_day_very_difficult_student_very/,"It's my first year teaching instrumental music at a private middle school. Today, I received an email that I'll get to in a moment. First, the backstory:

So there's a boy (we'll call him Finch) who is in my beginning band class. He's diagnosed ADD and sees a therapist once a week. Finch is extremely respectful in private. But in large classroom settings, he's a really challenging boy where behavior is concerned. It got to the point that the class was even turning on him and trying to take it upon themselves to ""police"" him (and I don't tolerate this in my class, mind you). 

It was becoming such a problem that other students were talking to teachers asking them to see if there was a way to have Finch taken out of my class. I wasn't having any of that, mind you, but I had to find a way to keep that from happening because I was seeing that becoming a definite possibility.

After emailing my principal and Finch's parent asking for some advice on how to deal with the situation (being new to the school community, it made sense to ask), working with the guidance counselor, and overall working out strategies to deal with the behavior, class is now running much more smoothly. Finch's behavior is still inconsistent, but it's much more manageable now and progress is being made. 

So, today I get an email from Finch's mother. There was a parent teacher conference, and Finch was asked what his favorite class was. Of the two he mentioned, mine was one of them, and the reason he said he liked my class was because of me. He said that I challenge him with high expectations and hold him accountable for his effort and participation in class (not his words, it's largely paraphrased from his mother's email message to me). 

It made my day. Here's a student that other students were begging me to have removed from my classroom because his behavior was becoming so unmanageable. Even staff were pushing for it. Because I put my foot down, reached out to my principal and the parent, and worked out a way to manage the situation, maybe I made a difference. Being new, there were probably things I could have done differently if I had more experience, so maybe I should instead say, ""Whoo hoo! I almost screwed up but turned it around!"" Either way, it doesn't matter what we call it. I just thought I'd share a positive experience and ask others to share theirs. 

tl;dr - Kept an ADD student of mine from being removed from my music class a while back due to his behavior. Received an email letting me know my class was his favorite because of me.

I'm out of here!"" My quality of life is being jeopardized due to the lack of support and stress of my job. I didn't have planning today, not unlike many days. I'm here past five, (at least,I have been known to stay later or leave earlier-on Fridays, if I can, but work on the weekend at home). 
I didn't have lunch today, (no time). One of my kids got suspended, and we had to physically remove him from the hallway. The district does jack shit. I have meetings everyday, before/after school. I have no time to do my paperwork during the school day. I finally received para help, (started Monday of this week). Up until this point, I've pretty much been on my own, with volunteer support here and there. 

Now I hear that state reps are discussing cuts in health care, as well as salary, resources, funding, etc. This isn't what I signed up for. I think I'm good at my job, and more importantly, I genuinely care about these kids. The population I work with are the underdogs. They are the kids you see in the principal's office, or getting in trouble for not paying attention in class, or getting made fun of for being different, or showing up to school a half hour late, or living in their family vehicles, or getting tossed around from foster home to foster home...These kids require my full attention, my nuturing, my guidance, my knowledge, and my ability to provide them with specially designed instruction to best meet their individual needs. Realistically, I cannot do it all...

*Forgive me for grammatical errors and choppy sentences. I am so exasperated.*BREATHE* Okay, where was I...

Thank you for providing a place for me to vent. I'm not just a teacher bitching about my workload. I'm an educator unable to meet the needs of my special ed students. As a result, my physical and emotional well-being is negatively impacted. 
I'm not trying to toot my own horn, but not a lot of people can do what I've done for 10 years. How about providing the tools teachers need to shape future generations? How about helping us teach our special ed population kiddos life skills to set them up for success? This is a HUGE problem! It affects everyone. Before we know it, outstanding, innovative educators will be replaced by lower-paid, less experienced, less effective teachers. It's happening already. I'm hoping I can last another year. This makes me sad. Teaching is my passion and talent. I'm up to my eyeballs in student loan debt, and I don't make shit. This is my calling. It's unfortunate that I might not make it to retirement. I sure would miss my students. I would not miss the bullshit politics.

Just wanted to share my moment with you all!,13,3,2,http://www.reddit.com/r/Teachers/comments/1dlc01/tonight_i_got_an_awesome_reminder_why_i_do_what_i/,"Tonight I was honored at a banquet for the top 30 students in my high school's graduating class. Each student chooses an elementary and secondary teacher to honor as their most influential teacher of their school career. I never expected to get this award, but the captain of my academic team (and a former student) chose me. It was an amazing and humbling experience. I was called up on stage while she read what she had written on her nomination, and I got a plaque with the nomination on it. This is what she said:

""I first met Ms. K. through &lt;academic team&gt; when I joined my sophomore year. We had six people on the team that year, three seniors and three sophomores, and it was Ms. K.'s first year as the coach. It was a new experience for everyone, but Ms. K. demonstrated her enthusiasm by jumping right into it from day one. Over the past three years I've seen this trait again and again, the way she throws herself into everything she does. During my junior year I was also lucky enough to have Ms. K. as my AP English teacher. With her passion and energy Ms. K. invited me to dive into the beauty of the English language, sharing her perspective with every student willing to listen. I think that is what Ms. K. does best, she invites students to come in and create something wonderful together. That is certainly what she did with &lt;academic team&gt;. Through &lt;team&gt; she has provided a welcoming and fun environment where I can join my team of friends week after week to learn and laugh together. Ms. K. has given extra time and effort beyond her job description to support me and help me succeed in the long term, giving up her time and effort to help guide me, and I can only say thank you for everything you have done.""

This was seriously one of the nicest things anyone has ever said to or about me. It was a huge honor and I still get teary eyed thinking about it! If you are ever wondering if teaching is worth it, just keep in mind that you have the ability to make this kind of impact on another person. It's a difficult career, but one of the most rewarding ones in the world.

I need your help!,14,3,7,http://www.reddit.com/r/Teachers/comments/1daral/i_had_some_spare_time_and_spontaneously_decided/,"So I was faced with about one month of free time to do whatever I felt like this spring/summer, and I've thought about volunteering overseas for some time. I found the UK organisation Projects Abroad online and now I'm very excited about my project in South Africa starting in about 3 weeks! I will be an assistant teacher in English for children aged 8-12 years. English is my second language (I'm from Norway) and I have very little experience teaching English. I could really need some help from more experienced teachers to prepare my lessons!

I should probably clarify that there are no formal qualifications to apply and I think (and hope!) the local schools appreciate any volunteer help they can get. My main task is to motivate the students and assist the professional teachers in making the school day a bit more exciting. That said, I am encouraged to prepare lessons myself – and if I do okey – I'll have some classes by myself eventually. This must obviously be my goal!

I have no idea how advanced the students are. All I know is that they will be 8-12 years old and my main focus will be spoken English. These are the resources Projects Abroad have recommended:

* Swan, Practical English Usage, OUP 2005
* Murphy, Grammar in Use, Intermediate, Upper Intermediate and various levels with answer keys, CUP 2004

Do you know any particular good books or resources I should get familiar with? How would you approach this task? Do you know or have experience with any games, role plays, tests or other methods of teaching that could be successful in engaging pupils this age? What material should I bring? Any other things I should have in mind?

I'm allowed to be a bit creative with my lessons, being from the other side of the world and all :) Projects Abroad specifically encourages me to bring a map and pictures from my home location. While introducing myself, it would be nice to get to know the students as well and perhaps get an impression over their English level. Do you know a fun way to do this?

I'll be working on all this the next 2-3 weeks, but I could really need some starting points! I don't have too much time and I'm starting at zero!

Along with my grade 6 gig I am also teaching grades 6-8 music with very little music background. I did take a course in university on teaching music but it was brief and I have already exhausted my resources from that class. I need help! If there are any music teachers out there that can give me lesson or unit plan suggestions or even a bit of direction in teaching music to challenging middle years students I would be extremely grateful! :) ,,False,,t5_2qqcs,False,,,True,t3_15sng2,http://www.reddit.com/r/Teachers/comments/15sng2/first_year_music_teacher_seeking_help_for_middle/,

I'm looking for other high school teachers, in the U.S. or abroad, whose students might be interested in exchanging a few letters with mine. The club runs from January until the beginning of April, but could be extended into future semesters.

Let me know if you're interested in participating, and I can give you more info about the exchange.

Edit: I'll get back to people individually within the next few days. Thanks for all the replies.

I piloted this club last trimester with students from Korea and Massachusetts. It was a great intercultural experience for my students, many of whom have never left their home state. It also gave students the chance to write in a more relaxed, social setting. I honestly hope that some new letter exchanges develop between teachers who read this thread.",,False,,t5_2qqcs,1356799037.0,,,True,t3_15ktfn,http://www.reddit.com/r/Teachers/comments/15ktfn/high_school_teacher_looking_for_students_to/,
