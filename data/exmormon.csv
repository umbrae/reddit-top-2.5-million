1349638847.0,404,self.exmormon,113lww,Did anyone ever lie about why they didn't go on/came home from a mission?,556,152,672,http://www.reddit.com/r/exmormon/comments/113lww/did_anyone_ever_lie_about_why_they_didnt_go/,"My story:

5 years ago.

I, for the most part, was your stereotypical 19 year old Mormon boy. Never missed a day of seminary, went to church every Sunday etc.  

When the time came to go on a mission I was ""excited"" because that's what you've been looking forward to since you we're 8 years old! It was the next step.

My first WTF moment was going through the temple, I had no idea what the hell was going on. It was so weird, the whole thing...just fucked up.

But I went with it, I didn't want to express to anyone how weird it was,  so whenever anyone asked how it was:  ""oh it was awesome!""

So, fast forward a few months until I went to the MTC.  I was overcome with the blatant brainwashing that was going on.

Learning the correct way to ""teach"" and pretty much lie by omission about the truth of church history.

I was going crazy and just had to get out of there, I was the only one who saw what was going on and I hated it.

I didn't know how to get out of there, so I pretended to hurt myself. And faked depression.  Just give myself a few scratches on my wrists (never broke skin, just enough to look like I had attempted something.)

It worked, I was released.  But I had to fake depression while I was figuring out religion.  I'm talking psychiatrists and everything.

But after for the first time of actually researching Mormonism and finding out how crazy it actually is...it was the most freeing experience ever.  Like being pulled from the Matrix.

After about a year, I came out to my parents and said I didn't believe anymore.  They cried, yelled, the normal stuff, but they still love me.


The whole depression thing is all in the past, but nobody really knows I was faking it the whole time.

So, with all this missionary talk going around...does anyone have a similar experience? Or am I just an odd one out.

TL;DR:  Faked depression to come home from mission.",,False,self,t5_2r0gj,False,,,True,t3_113lww,http://www.reddit.com/r/exmormon/comments/113lww/did_anyone_ever_lie_about_why_they_didnt_go/,

It had been a while since I'd seen them and I was a little surprised at how NOT irritated I was at seeing them. Instead of getting mad at the church all over again, I remembered how shitty the mission was and how much I didn't like being there. 

I also remember only getting $120 a month for food, bike repairs and incidentals. I once went 6 months without eating any dairy, because I couldn't afford milk or cheese. 

So, as I watched them going around and putting things in their cart, it made me sad for them and I got a $40 gift card for them at the checkout. 

I sent my wife outside with the groceries and caught the elders in line. I said, ""Hey fellas. I remember when I was on my mission and they didn't give us shit for grocery money. So, here's $40."" Their faces lit up and they looked so happy. One of them looked me in the eyes and said, ""Are you sure?"" I said, ""Yup. Just remember that us exmormons aren't all bad."" Smiles and handshakes all around. Profuse thanks. 

It felt really good to help them out. They were genuinely grateful. And it was nice to reclaim some of what I had lost in being angry at the church for the last few years.

It was not until a few weeks ago that I decided I would post my compilation on Reddit. I then had to re-email the professors who had already responded, and I had given thanks, asking their permission to post their names and responses online. Out of the 25 who responded, fourteen have allowed me to share their names and words. I even had a professor email me their phone number saying they wished to speak over the phone. He generously gave me an hour of his time and I greatly appreciate it.
First, I want to thank all of the professors who took the time to respond to my inquiries. Their responses were generous, kind, and above all enlightening. The expertise of the professors was in one (or more) of the following three categories:
Pre-Columbian Mesoamerica Archaeology	
Pre-Columbian Mesoamerica Anthropology
Egyptology

Second, I will share the email I sent to the Mesoamerica professors. 

https://docs.google.com/file/d/0B1_l1xQdDguBaEZKQjhsQmQ5WVk/edit?usp=sharing

Here is the letter to the Egyptology professors.

https://docs.google.com/file/d/0B5HfF_gsLNwnRmx0bUozd1FHR1U/edit?usp=sharing

I usually added something to the letter that was specific to the receiver like their work in a specific country, or their particular field of work.

I have a few remarks before I give the names and responses of the professors. I am aware that the Ex-Mormon subreddit had a post in the past where three professors from UCLA responded to questions about the Book of Abraham and a BYU professor who made a YouTube video regarding the Book of Abraham. I also recall that the title of the thread was “Peer Review is a B****.” I also know that FAIR gave a very detailed response to this post, its title, and the professors who responded. Although my post is much more thorough I want to make the following statements:

*  To FAIR: I welcome any response you wish to give. Perhaps I went wrong somewhere in my research that you wish to point out or you want to make a post just to say hello to me… I encourage any response. I hope your post will be just as professional and will refrain from the very ad-hominem attacks that I discourage as well. 

*  I want to thank the Ex-Mormon subreddit. The truth is that I made this post on a special date. A year ago from tomorrow, I told my bishop, who is a man I highly respect, I would not be attending church anymore. Today I will be sharing this information with not just you, Ex-Mormons, but also my bishop. I am going to print out a packet with this information and show him how far I have come in the past year. I went from a kid who knew next to nothing about the church and its history to a man who reads philosophy and theology books in his free time, along with emailing professors about their opinions on matters that relate to their expertise.
I will never forget the week I told my bishop I would stop attending. I made a post on this subreddit titled “Talk with Bishop” and received over twenty responses, all of which offered words of help and hope. Thank you, Ex-Mormon subreddit, for taking the time to help guys like me.

*  Finally, my real name is Zachary. I chose my username, caglessbird, from a quote by Alejandro Jodorowski. “Birds born in a cage think flying is an illness.”

Without further ado:

https://docs.google.com/file/d/0B1_l1xQdDguBM0tpT29MemVtd2s/edit?usp=sharing

Well that’s it, Ex-Mormon subreddit. I hope that you all enjoyed the post and found it just as enlightening as I did. I would love to hear from you fellow Redditors about your thoughts on my compilation. However, I will not be able to respond to your comments until later this afternoon or tonight. Thanks again to the professors, the moderators, and this subreddit.
Best Wishes.

They only managed to get tickets for the Saturday afternoon session where the sustaining vote is taken.

Anyway, the time for the vote rolls around DFU asks the members to sustain the TSM as prophet seer and revelator and everyone raises their hand. Except me. He then asks for all those opposed to show it by the same sign, which of course I do. This is repeated a couple of times for the various general authorities and since I have as seat in the balcony I've got a pretty good view of the entire audience. As far as I can tell no one else raises their hand.

Uchtdorf concludes that the voting is unanimous (and to be fair he wouldn't have been able to see me) and the show goes on. I'm sitting their smugly thinking about my small protest when all of the sudden two men are in the aisle beckoning for me to come talk to them (I will refer to them as George and Lennie because I didn't ask for their names and the tall one never opened his mouth). I get up and follow them. Both are wearing suits (duh) with pins that say CS and I try to guess what it stands for. Conference Security? Church Secretary?  

They take me out into the lobby and into another room where they shut the door. George takes out a notepad and asks my for my name. I give him my real name, cause why the hell not. He also asks for my full address my bishop's name my ward, he even takes a picture of me.

Then George asks, ""This doesn't happen very often but it is church procedure to interview anyone opposed to the church."" I silently laugh, they've got their work cut out for them, ""Why did you raise your hand?""

I reply, ""I don't believe Thomas S Monson or any of the other men up there are prophets seers or revelators.""

I glance over at Lennie, he's frowning at me. George asks, ""Did you come here just to vote against the prophet?""

""No my parents took me here and then Uchtdorf asked if I sustained him and the honest answer is no.""

Now George and Lennie are frowning at me, Lennie touches his ear and I realize they're both wearing ear pieces. ""The prophet is a great man and I sustain him fully, now you're free to believe what ever you want but how do you think your parents feel right now?""

""What my parents feel should have nothing to do with what I believe.""

George tilts his head slightly, ""Well it looks like you're going through some hard times, I hope you get over it. We aren't trying to intimidate you or force you to believe something, but I hope you change your mind.""

""Well sir, you've had 17 years to do that and it hasn't worked.""

George frowns and nods to Lennie who, still without saying a word, takes me out of the room and escorts me back to my seat.

Just before the door closes behind us I here George say, ""We'll be in touch.""

Up until about 2 months ago I was totally planning on leaving for a mission. I had my call to an impoverished South American country, had my farewell, and all that was left to do was count down the days to leave. Except, I was profoundly unhappy and my testimony was beginning to unravel. I started to doubt I began  lurking on this sub just to see how the other half lived. What i found was a treasure trove of knowledge. A beautiful place where truth was embraced, and nobody was afraid to talk about tough issues. From there i found mormonthink and that was the final nail in the coffin of my faith. Why hadnt the church taught us truthfully about its history? i never learned that Joseph had over 30 wives and that one was **14** !!!! How could they skip over that in seminary? I learned about the book of Abraham, and how it was really just a crock of shit conjured up by a con man who has now beguiled millions... including me. I told my family a week before i was due to leave that i would no longer be going on a mission, that i had lost my testimony in TSCC. They took it about as bad as they could, and there were many screaming matches with my parents to follow, and they did their best to change my mind and get me off to the MTC. Whenever i was discouraged though, i came back here and read about other people who were dealing with the *exact same stuff*. Without you guys, i would be trudging around in the sand, depressed and alone, and in complete denial of the truth about the church. Thanks to everybody that has made this sub so amazing, because it really does change peoples lives for the better. If we were at church i would totally bear my testimony of r/exmormon because i know it to be true, and i get fuzzy feelings when i read it. Im on the beginning of a long journey out of TSCC, but im glad you guys are here to help me along the way.

1355160114.0,188,self.exmormon,14m1ry,No Personal Attacks.  It's a simple rule.,220,32,55,http://www.reddit.com/r/exmormon/comments/14m1ry/no_personal_attacks_its_a_simple_rule/,"All,

It is with heavy heart that I post this, but it seems time we need a reminder of what makes /r/exmo so great.  The ability to share freely everything from alcohol preference to sexual inhibition requires a lot of opening one's vulnerabilities and revealing one's inner-self.

That's rough for everyone.  And I get that we're always going to have disagreements and arguments and things that people just plain don't like.  That's human.

But the simple, brilliant thing Measure76 set up was one rule.  ""No Personal Attacks"".  It's what separates us from so many other forums.  If you can't boil down well-sourced, respectful discussion into ""yo mama"" level attacks, the discussion remains in the ""well-sourced"" and respectful  area.

And that's what we want.  We're all hurt.  We all suffered from feelings of betrayal as people we've trusted have insinuated that we're lesser simply for our beliefs.  Let's not do that to each other.

I think of a user, Veloria78, I think, who was once on this board.  She left the church for another Christian faith.  And ya know, that's fine.  She's still an ""Exmo"".  But personal attacks about her intelligence drove her away (If I remember her goodbye message well enough).

It isn't necessary.  Remember how vulnerable you felt when you left?  How there was no one in the world who really understood (Yes this isn't everyone, but it is how many of us felt)?  How friends and family reacted with personal attacks immediately?

We don't need it here.  Attack the argument.  Focus on the sources, the documents.  Convince via data.  But ""Douche-bag"" and ""idiot"" and ""moron"" can all be saved for rant pages (Because there are times for ad-hominem), and not saved for each other.

Make sense?

I was told this story by several coworkers last night and then again this morning)

Okay so, my company has box seat tickets at the Energy Solutions Arena. Last night at the Jazz vs Warriors game Thomas Monson was a few boxes down from our box. 

At one point in the night, these two women come into our box and start going through our treats, picking stuff up to take. One of my coworkers turned to the women and kind of was like ""Hey... can I help you?""   

""Oh no, we're just getting some of these cookies.""

There was a slight awkward silence while everyone was trying to figure out what was going on, then the woman says: 

""Oh don't worry, they're for the Prophet. He told us to come get some."" 
They then proceeded to fill up a bag and their pockets with cookies and goodies from our box, and brought them back for the prophet to eat. They didn't say another word. They just left with the food.  

Anyway, it caused a little bit of a stir among my fellow employees, most of whom are TBM. They were all a little disgruntled that the Prophet would send messengers to steal their food, even though they would have likely given it to him had he asked. The sense of entitlement that the women expressed was the bigger issue it seems. 

There was a lot of talk about it today, everyone was trying to rationalize what happened, trying to think of an explanation as to why the prophet would send people to steal goodies from neighboring suites, but I think we all know the truth:

Life at home has been pretty mellow since then, but more shit hit the fan last night.

Quick back story. I've been apathetic towards the church all my life but an outward TBM so my parents wouldn't bug me. Went on a mission (unworthily, oops), after teaching for 3 months, I realized I just couldn't lie to people anymore. I came home via confessing to having sex and told them I don't believe in any of this and didn't believe in it before I 'commited the atrocity of pre-marital sex'.
I've just been working an 8-5 job to fill my time and was planning to go back to school in the fall. I did one year at BYU and have no desire to go back. Was planning on attending UofU for their engineering program, but it's far more expensive than BYU and my parents had only saved enough for 4-5 years at BYU. Two semesters at the U will effectively wipe out that savings account.

I'm a total life scrub because I was so babied by my fairly wealthy parents. If anyone could give me tips on getting scholarships or anything of the sort, or dealing with the guilt trips/ shit storms my disgustingly TBM mother sends my way I'd be most appreciative.

You probably have a good reason to be here.  Curiosity (a good reason, and an excellent mars rover), a question, something that bothered you that you put on ""The shelf"" a while back.

I'm going to be straight up with you. This subreddit has a bias.  We think it all isn't true.  That being said; we have a passion for good historical evidence.  We're not that angry or bitter as they make us seem during the ""us or them"" talks in Sunday School.  Many of us still attend church, quietly doubting.

Is there some bitter?  Sure.  But it's the same bitter that the victims of Bernie Madoff felt when they learned their life savings were gone.  We were banking on this, not only for retirement, but for the next life.  

Why are we still obsessed by the church?  Honestly, most aren't.  During my years on this subreddit, most the people I knew originally have moved on.  Of the nearly [300,000 people who leave the church ever year](http://www.reddit.com/r/exmormon/comments/ilkav/byu_law_professor_frederick_mark_gedicks_as_many/) most of them you never hear from.  Those of us who are vocal are typically stuck with family in the organization, and attacked weekly about our beliefs.

So what does that mean for you?  Well, I'd invite you to speak up.  Have a question, ask it.  We fear no challenge.  Have a church story that you're sure is true? Let's put it to the test.

Bare in mind the bias... but simply because there is a bias doesn't mean that all information should be rejected. (Church manuals and FAIR/The Maxwell Institute are biased too!)

If not, that's fine too.  Feel free to lurk, look, and think.  It's a glorious thing to have a brain, and we invite all to use it.

Its the poorest mission in the Philippines which is already a 3rd world country. I leared to speak Cebuano, Waray-waray, and Tagalog on my mission.

This experience I would like to share happened in my first area Catbalogan. I was still super culture shocked and mostly just followed my companion around like a zombie all day. It didn't help that I could barely communicate with the people because of the multi-lingual barrier. 

One hot and sweaty day (every day) we were going to teach a new investigator who lived under a tarp on the side of the filth strewn street. While teaching we would just squat in the road because it was too dirty to sit anywhere. The investigator was a man in his mid 40s who was as skinny as the people you see in the concentration camp pictures after being starved to death. He wore several grocery bags wrapped around his waist for a loincloth.

He admitted to us that because he was to weak to do anything but beg from under the tarp he wasn't getting food or money to feed himself. He was slowly starving to death. He would kill cockroaches and eat them if they came to close to his tarp and that was all he had for sustenance.

After our lesson my companion and I were riding a motorcycle back to our apartment and I asked him if I could buy some food for the investigator. My companion said that he didn't think we were allowed to help the locals because of the mission's rules but I could call the Mission President to ask him.

That night I called our Mission President to ask if I could use my personal funds to feed the poor dying man. I really felt good about this like even though I couldn't speak the langauge I could bring some happiness into this man's life. My Mission President told me in no uncertain terms that I could not assist this man in any temporal way. He urged me to let this man feast from the words of Christ.

A week passed and we went back to teach this investigator. He didn't answer us as we approached his tarp so we flipped up the front flap of the tarp and found him curled in a ball dead. The stench was unbelievable. For a few minutes I just stared at the body of one of my first investigators.

It was the first dead person I had ever seen and I could have done something to save him. My lack of action killed this man. That was the first time I felt geniune anger at the church I had served since I was born. Because of my Mission President's lack of concern with this man's temporal well being he died. 

The anger and shame of this experience is still with me today and was a focal point to me investigating the validity of the church. 

I thought this would be a good place to share my story.

Here is a taste, ""*If I am to understand the situation correctly, DS was only pointing out an observational parallel regarding the irony of persecuting someone for their beliefs while subscribing to a mythology that is, by any objective standard, just as ridiculous as the belief system that the persecutor is choosing to single out. The only difference between the two students, as I see it, was that DS was mature enough to point out the parallel in mythological absurdity and let the whole issue rest at that - while the offending student, it would seem, is behaviorally incapable handling a conversational rebuttal to his discriminatory behavior and choose to whine about it to a teacher.*""

1375746011.0,167,self.exmormon,1jrx34,They said our marriage was doomed to fail - Today is our 10 year anniversary.,192,25,40,http://www.reddit.com/r/exmormon/comments/1jrx34/they_said_our_marriage_was_doomed_to_fail_today/,"Our marriage was a bit of a scandal in the eyes of TBM members of our families as well as various authorities of TSCC. 

My wife’s father passed away suddenly of a heart attack 2 months before the date of our wedding. We didn't know how to handle the shock emotionally and before you knew it we were no longer “temple worthy.” Sadly we know many people who should not have married in the temple but lied to save face with their families, we wanted to do what we felt was the right thing however. 

We had informed both her Mother and my parents that one thing led to another and that we were no longer worthy to marry in the temple. They took the news better than we thought they would, but then we had to face our bishops.  We were told that because of our “indiscretion” that our marriage was doomed to fail and that they had all kinds of statistics to back up their claims. 
The word quickly got around. Since my wife wasn't endowed yet she was put on a formal probation where as I was dis-fellowshipped because I had been through the temple already at that time. We were still active at the time and everyone could put two and two together seeing a couple engaged to be and eventually married sitting next to each other at church every Sunday not being allowed to take the sacrament. 

To make matters worse my wife has family members that are general authorities. If you've ever had to sit through general conference and have had the displeasure of being condescended to from the pulpit from a skinny , middle aged, blond helmet-haired lady who has some sort of title to do with Young Women’s… That would by my wife’s aunt.

Once word reached her uncle that we weren't going to have a temple marriage he flew in to harass my Mother in law because we didn't deserve a nice wedding after what we had done and that she shouldn't be spending money on a wedding after just having paid for a funeral. He even visited the venue where the wedding was going to take place and pulled the “don’t you know who I am?” card to try to get them to give back the deposit. 

We finally went down to the courthouse and picked up a marriage license about 6 weeks before the wedding was going to take place. We presented the certificate to her Mother and informed her that we planned on going to the courthouse in the next few days as we would rather just be married and be done with the ridiculousness rather than have to go through the embarrassment of a DI budget wedding that her uncle would want forced on us. Her mother suddenly found her courage at this point telling the uncle that he better mind his own business and that she would see to it that her daughter had a proper wedding, temple marriage or not.  

Fast forward a year, we've gone through the shame game being told our marriage was doomed to failure by our bishops, having to explain to everyone who really had no business knowing anything about our personal lives why it was that we couldn't take the sacrament and why we didn't marry in the temple. We did everything we were supposed to do and now we were going to be sealed in the temple.
Aside from our parents and a small handful of friends there was no one there we actually cared about. Everyone else at the ceremony was there purely for show. The Uncle and the Aunt, other random people from my Mother in laws ward, cousins we never speak to. It was all a circus to show these people that we weren't heathens after all. 

Fast forward a few more years. My wife admits that the temple was a traumatic experience for her, that no one ever told her that she would have to be mostly naked in front of old women and that the whole experience was off setting and cult like. She says she never wants to go back to the temple again and has decided to stop wearing her garments. I’m confused and sad at first, but decide that I should seriously examine my faith to help better understand my wife’s concerns. This lead to me asking questions which led to bishops and home teachers and others getting angry with us. Time and time again I would see their flustered faces as they would eventually throw at me that annoying cliche quip, “do you really think these questions are important to get into the Celestial kingdom?” It wouldn't be too long before I would lose the garments as well. 

Fast forward to today. We've been married 10 years today. We spent part of the weekend alone together celebrating, the other part with some good friends drinking and smoking cigars. We split ways with the church a few years ago and I think it is because we shed those Dogmas that our relationship was able to grow stronger over the years. Problems can be solved from a logical standpoint rather than wondering what is wrong with the other person and why they can’t just do what God and the Church wants them to. Not being able to have children was once a crisis and now we see it as more of a blessing giving us time to focus on our relationship with each other and the horrible, selfish, materialistic things that we aren't supposed to care about but that make us happy when we are able to obtain them Hell, just being able to enjoy a bottle of wine and a porno together like normal people the rest of the world over are able to do. 

After 10 years I can say that our marriage is still going strong not because of the church, but in spite of it. 

Thank you for letting me share our story.

I've had friends who've been abused by their parents and even kicked out of their homes for not believing in the church's doctrine. I know girls who are smart and capable and who fully believe that their only purpose in life is to get married at 18 and have ten kids. However, like many of you, growing up in a culture dominated by the LDS church has given me a positive attitude towards Mormons as well. I recognize that they tend to be hard workers, and that many of them are good people. These are the realities of the church, not the magic underwear and polygamy that most people focus on. I tend to feel uncomfortable when I'm involved in a conversation about the church with people who are unfamiliar with it.

I had never been to anything like a university before, and the sheer amount of choice staggered me.  I found myself going to official functions, one after another.

It was at one of these official pieces that the BYUSA president gave a rousing speech about ""Cougars don't cut corners"".  He discussed walking on the corners of the grass, and that each year the university spent $16,000 replacing the corners of grass where students walked.

The he compared it to cutting corners in our jobs, and the rest of our life.  He asked us to each promise we'd never cut corners at the school, and that it would be a reminder to not cut corners later in life.  

I was young, I was impressionable.  I spent the fall dutifully not stepping on corners and judging the people who did.  

Then, winter happened.  It always does in Utah.  And out came the snowplows.  Every one of them zipping with poor turn radius, cutting the corners and plowing up grass along with snow.  I watched two snow plows tear up ever corner in the Quad (Between the library and the Administration building) and realized I'd been had.  The leadership hadn't left their ivory tower long enough to realize the actual cause of the damage and they were burdening  the students with guilt trips to try and correct it.

Of course, I ascribed it to ""Imperfect men"" at the time, but now I realize that honestly it's a pretty good metaphor for the church as a whole.

And I'm an idiot.,183,27,71,http://www.reddit.com/r/exmormon/comments/1gix4m/im_an_airline_pilot_based_in_slc_boyd_k_packer/,"A few days ago I'm sitting in the cockpit, waiting for passengers to load for a flight to Salt Lake. I see a guy get on that looks really familiar, but I can't quite place him. I forget about it until one of my flight attendants (22 years old, married, bubbly, annoying, super tbm) comes up to me and excitedly says ""did you see that Boyd K Packer is on the plane?! This is so cool!"" 

My initial reaction was to once again be surprised at the hero/celebrity status church leaders have with members. My second reaction was to spend the entire flight thinking about brother Boyd, his hateful politics of intolerance, his weird obsession with boys sexuality, his homophobia. And I got kind of annoyed at it all. 

So when it came time to deplane, I stood near the door, thinking of something I could say, or some way I could look at him to show that I didn't care for him, without jeopardizing my job. Should I thank him for being one of the reasons I left the church?  Or just tell him I thought he was a hateful man?

Well, I'm not a clever or brave man so I decided on something pretty dumb; I'd nod, squint my eyes and say in a rude tone: ""off you go, Mr. Packer"", emphasizing the Mr. so that he'd know I knew who he was, but wasn't going to acknowledge any authority or give and respect by saying Brother or President. (I know this is weak, but the flight attendant is right there, and I don't want to lose my job!) 

He reaches the front of the plane, and just as I'm about to say it, he looks me in the eye and says ""that was a very good landing!"" And I'll be fucked if I didn't go completely mute. And wink at him! With a shit eating smile on my dumb face.

In fact, to this day (my mid-twenties) only one of them has passed away. All of these people grew up steeped in LDS tradition, married young and, due to this, are fortunate to see a number of their great grandchildren while still young enough to enjoy them.            
                
One of these people is my paternal grandfather. I can only recall a few things about him from my childhood, but the one that stands out the most was that, despite growing up in southern Utah, he was not a church-going man.           
              
I remember my grandmother going alone to church while he chose to stay home. I remember seeing and smelling coffee at his house. I remember vague conversations between parents about his socializing and forays into Masonry...and that these were somehow negative when his lack of church attendance was taken into account.          
                
For a while I was confused. My parents had taught us that the church was right, and everyone in my little world knew that. Except grandpa, that is. I never felt betrayed by this personally, but I could feel early on how concerned my parents were about his influence on us children.               
               
This grandpa purchased me a subscription to Discover magazine. This grandpa invested substantial sums of money into starting college funds for his dozen plus grandchildren. He ignited an interest in the sciences in me that has led to a comfortable career in an industry I enjoy.           
             
It is not fair to say it was *only* him. But his part is clear to me, now. Always in the wings, seemingly detached but concerned.          
              
The only grandparent I have that passed away was his wife. Devout and a church-lover to the end, she was. But he stayed with her despite their differences. I never understood what that meant, but even now he misses her. I think he'd love to believe he'll see her again, but he seems to know he won't.               
                 
Today, he wrote me and my siblings an email. He had received a letter from a cousin in the mission field talking about how he was trying to convert a 'gay investigator', then 'cure' him of his homosexuality. This caused him to search the new church's website about gays and he found out that the stance has changed from 'It's a choice' to 'bear with it and abstain from gay actions'.         
               
His email went on to say that the standard the church held for gays was ridiculous; to mandate abstinence is to deny basic human instinct. He went on to say that, while he personally doesn't feel right about gay ""marriage"", he has known enough gay people to realize they suffer under such criticism.          
                 
In the end, he called the men in Salt Lake 'ignorant', knowing nothing about this issue they decided on, going as far as to say ""apparently God has not spoken to them"" and ""I wonder if enough pressure can come from the Church membership to force a change by the powers-that-be at Church headquarters? No, I think not . . .  Mormons don't do that . ""           
                   
Apparently, the backlash from other family members CC'd on the email (it was blind copied, I've no idea to whom it was sent besides me), was substantial and he quickly issued an apology citing his tendency to have no filter as an ""old man"".          
                 
*Who is this man*? And why didn't he play a bigger role in my younger life?! I ask this now because as a child I was gently nudged away from him. Minor issues with the Word of Wisdom and the like were used to alienate him, in a way.          
           
I responded to him, and him alone, telling him that I shared his trepidation and sincere doubt of the 'authorities' in Salt Lake. I told him his criticisms were legitimate and, while a little aggressive for my families eyes and hears, were fully welcome in mine.          
             
He wrote back to me, thanking me for my kind words. He then gave me a warning: that I am in for a 'tough time' in life, walking that thin line with family members so observant to the church. He said it's been a path he walked since he was 27.          
             
That's only a year older than me, and it's been about 50 years since then.            
                 
It's amazing how much a true view of a situation can change a 'lazy grandpa who doesn't attend church because he likes to drink coffee and sleep in' into something else entirely. I feel both ashamed to have judged him so as a child and proud to think I'm following in such a brave man's footsteps.",,False,self,t5_2r0gj,False,,,True,t3_1ch5qj,http://www.reddit.com/r/exmormon/comments/1ch5qj/a_grandfather_ive_only_begun_to_understand/,

Recently, BYU professor Kerry Muhlestein has recorded a series of youtube videos where he defends the veracity of Joseph Smith's translation of the Egyptian papyrus as the Book of Abraham. These video can be found on the youtube channel ""mormonchallenges"". 

In these videos, Kerry makes all kinds of claims about how Egyptology is discovering new connections between ancient egypt and the patriarch Abraham. I know all of the traditional objections to the translation problems of the book of Abraham and its accompanying facsimiles. I even made a video about it a while ago on my flackerman channel.

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lvdqiTOf0PA

However, Kerry made it seem as if there has been some new information that has come out. Not being an egyptologist, I decided to e-mail 3 professors of Egyptology at UCLA, where Kerry got his degree, and see if they agreed with his claims.

The first professor said that he did not have time to watch the videos, but that he was familiar with the Joseph Smith papyrus and the book of Abraham. He instead referred me to Professor Robert Ritner's book ""The Joseph Smith Egyptian Papyri. A Complete Edition"" and that he agreed with Dr. Ritner's conclusions. Dr. Ritner was the beared professor who appeared in the ""book of Abraham"" video documentary that so many of us has watched on youtube. He concluded in that video that there was no connection of any kind between the papyrus, the facsimiles, and the book of Abraham.

The second professor told me that the translation and interpretation of the Joseph Smith papyri are a religious, instead of a scholarly endeavor. I responded that I appreciated his religious sensitivity, but that professor Muhlestein was claiming that the science of Egyptology had discovered a connection between the book of the Dead, the hypocephalus, and Abraham. After watching at least one of the videos, he responded that I was right and that he would ""discuss it with him"".

The last professor wrote me the following:

&gt;""I watched the three videos, and I don't agree with any of it. The ancient Egyptians had no concept of Abraham, so I don't know where he gets these comparisons… And No, most Egyptologists do not agree, despite what Kerry says. I know Kerry, but I do not have much respect for his work. Now I have even less. The fact that he is digging in Egypt is even more worrisome… This PhD was awarded before I arrived at UCLA, although I know that Kerry finished his text based dissertation after only two years of Egyptian language training, which is rather laughable. 

&gt;Have you read Robert Ritner's work about this in Journal of Near Eastern Studies? It's the best out there… Kerry is just spinning out the same Mormon rhetoric. What is different is: Mormons are funding PhDs in Egyptology and Biblical Studies and then funding positions at BYU and elsewhere and passing these people off as experts, when they are only ideologically driven researchers, not experts interested in actual evidence.

&gt;Thanks for sending. It's important to know who these people are""

So there you have it. All 3 of the professors of Egyptology at the University where Kerry got his degree disagree with his claims.

After what seemed like a never-ending stream of meetings with my bishop to ""save me"", I finally did it and I would like to share my story! (:

About two years ago I started really questioning the church and just about a year ago I realised that the whole religion thing was bullshit, but I didn't come out as an atheist till recently. My friends knew first, of course, but I tried my best to hide it from my family so I wouldn't have to break their hearts.

Then one day, I just couldn't take it and I came out to my parents in a less than ideal way, and ever since then it's just been non-stop contention. They still love me and care for me, but they're always crying over me about it. And this month of October was just worse...

When the big announcement about the drop of the missionary age came out, my Facebook feed EXPLODED with posts about going on missions and how great of a blessing it was, while I saw this as an obvious ploy by the church to get less people from questioning the church and just get them out as quick as possible. I was really annoyed and due to my stupid seventeen year old mind, I decided to make my own post saying ""You know what? I'm proud to say that I will NOT be going on a mission when I turn 18, that I am no longer part of the LDS church. Rather than turning in papers to serve a mission, I'll be turning in my resignation letter to get my name removed from the church. I'm done.""

Of course, I shouldn't have done that while having TBM friends and family on my Facebook, but at the time I was in the whole ""Fuck what people think"" stage.

Oh how I wish I didn't do that. I got grounded by my parents for posting something like that (my dad said I didn't need to post what I feel if it's ex-mormon) and I got a whole bunch of phone calls/texts from my leaders. The worst part was my bishop fucking came over to my house THAT NIGHT at fucking 9:00 PM.

The whole family sat in my living room as the bishop talked about Jesus and blah blah blah, the whole Mormon bullshit stories...it was complete hell. Finally he adressed the elephant in the room and asked me how I would describe my testimony. I responded with, ""Non-exsitant. I don't have a testimony, bishop, and I don't think I ever did."" He was taken back at this statement and so was I! I just said that in front of my mom, dad, brother and sister. He went on to take out his scriptures and try to preach to me and my family for an hour. He asked if he could meet with me later that week, and of course with my whole family in the room, I responded yes and we decided to meet Friday morning.

From that night when I posted the status on Facebook till that Friday morning, I had two of my leaders show up at my door to talk to me. I invited them in and they sat down with me and we were just shooting the shit for a while until they of course brought up my testimony. I was just completely open and honest with them and told them I don't believe in the church/God anymore and made sure to assure them that I was fine.

Then Friday came and I went over to the church for my meeting with the bishop. I was grounded so of course my mom had to drive me there seeing as they can't trust me and I went inside by myself. The bishop didn't feel like small talk much and got right down to business. He said he wanted to talk about the church which really meant he wanted me to sit there quietly while he read off what seemed to be the whole Book of Mormon. After about an hour and half of him talking he asked me what I was feeling right now, and I responded that I still haven't changed my mind and that I'm done with the church. He was realising that he wasn't going to make a difference today so he asked me,

""Mundo53, is there anytime we can meet again in the future? I'd like to see you once a week at least so we can make some progress, what do you think?""

""No thank you, that won't be necessary seeing as I'll be turning in my letter of resignation soon.""

""Well you can turn in your letter but I won't accept it seeing as you're still 17. How about next Sunday we meet again?""

""Mmm, no. I'm okay.""

""Are you sure, Mundo53? Think about what you're doing to your mother.""

""I'm positive.""

MY GOD DID THAT FEEL GOOD. Haven't heard from him since.

But real quick, is it true that I can't turn in my letter until I turn 17? Seems like major bullshit to me considering I can become a member at the age of 8 but I can't leave till 18?

TL;DR Finally turned down a meeting with my bishop.

I was reading [this](http://exmormonmavens.com/owe-explanation/) post and I had this idea. 

The video would start with a couple young teen kids playing in a park and one sitting a little bit away from the others. A middle aged man, (looks respected, not necessarily creepy) walks up to the young person who is by themselves and sits down next to them. Then, out of the blue he asks, ""Do you masturbate?"" The kid is clearly alarmed. 

New scene, older man walks up to two kids, ""Do you two pet each other?"" Kids run away in panic. 

Man walks up to young adult couple. ""Have you two had sex?"" They are shocked, don't really answer. The man continues, ""Where does he touch you? Did you have an orgasm? What color is your underwear?"" 

Scene cuts again to a close up of a young girls face. We hear the same man's voice asking her if she touches herself. The girl is obviously uncomfortable and creeped out. The camera slowly pulls back as the man asks her more questions and we see that they're sitting in a bishop's office. 



Anyway, I think that would really help people understand how creepy this whole thing is. Let's make it happen!

We were never SUPER CLOSE, but we hung out a little every now and then. As soon as I accepted his request, he immediately messaged me. Little did I know that this was about to be a really stupid fucking conversation.

-----

**Old Friend (still super-Mormon and apparently VERY out of the loop, as I have been an atheist openly for over five years now):** Man, it's been such a long time! Are you married? What ward do you go to?

**Me:** Nope, still single. Almost got married once, but things didn't work out.

**Me:** How about you? How have you been?

**Old Friend:** Ah, that sucks. I got engaged! Which ward are you in?

**Me:** Oh, that's great! Congratulations, man. I don't have one, haha.

**Old Friend:** No ward? How does that work?

**Me:** I don't go to church.

**Old Friend:** You don't? Why not?

**Me:** Well, I'm not a member anymore.

**Old Friend:** :O

**Old Friend:** What happened!?

**Me (not really wanting to get into it in any detail because there is no version of that conversation that isn't uncomfortable):** Just not for me.

**Old Friend:** What do you mean?

**Me:** I'd really rather not get into it, if you don't mind.

**Old Friend:** Was it a chastity thing?

**Me:** No, I just stopped believing in all of that.

**Old Friend:** Man, you've just gotta read the Book of Mormon.

**Me (sighing because I'm being suckered into this discussion):** I've read it. When I was a member, I read it a couple of times a year. When I started to realize I didn't believe in God anymore, I panicked and read it all again. I'm just not a spiritual person.

**Old Friend:** Did you just want to sin?

**Me:** Really, dude?

**Old Friend:** Come on, there's got to be more to it than that.

**Me:** I don't want to talk about my opinions and beliefs right now. I respect that you believe things I don't, and I don't want you to feel like I'm insulting your worldview. Go back a month or two on my timeline and you'll probably find one of my long rants about the topic there.

**Old Friend:** I'd rather you explained it to me personally.

**(a few minutes pass)**

**Old Friend:** David?

**Old Friend:** Look, I know deep down you know it's true.

**Me:** No, I don't. It's fine that you believe it so strongly, and I actually respect that, but I don't believe it personally.

**Old Friend:** Yes you do! You're just telling yourself otherwise so you can live in the world.

**Me:** Why do you need to turn this into a rumspringa?

**Old Friend:** It's true, and you're a smart guy. You know that, you feel it, and you're just being selfish. You'll come around.

**Me:** Okay.

**Me:** You're projecting, all right? We're different people, and we believe different things.

**Old Friend:** I wish I'd been here to keep you from straying.

**Me:** Let's not talk about this, okay?

**Old Friend:** No, I don't want to let you hide from this.

**Me:** Okay, I'm getting a little mad now.

**Old Friend:** The only reason you have to get mad is that you know I'm right.

**Me:** I think we're done here.

**Old Friend:** If I'm so wrong, why can't you explain it to me?

**Old Friend:** I'll pray for you to find your way back to the truth.

**Me (finally snapping):** Okay, fine. You want to do this? Let's do this.

**Me:** I grew up believing in the church because my parents and all of my friends were members, and I trusted them.

**Me:** From very early on, I had issues with it. I accumulated a lot of those over the years. Eventually, I picked up too many to ignore and had to take a look at all of it.

**Me:** Figure myself out. I looked at it honestly for the first time in my life, and none of it made sense. An omnipotent, omnipresent, omnibenevolent god makes no sense. The church's stance on homosexuality is cruel and not the kind of thing a loving god could ever endorse.

**Me:** The entire religion is laced through with misogyny and racism. The laws of chastity are outdated, repressive Victorian values and lead to a ridiculously high divorce rate because they make sex into a sacrament instead of allowing it to be human and people get married because of social pressures and active sex drives rather than out of any understanding of the kind of commitment it represents.

**Me:** The tendency to scientific denialism when it comes to our universe's origins and physical laws that isn't specific to Mormonism but comes along with most organized religion certainly doesn't help things at all.

**Old Friend:** How have you become so hard-hearted? This isn't like you. What happened to you?

**Me:** I paid fucking attention in church.

**Old Friend:** No need to get vulgar. Bad language is just proof that you're not thinking about any of this rationally. If you'd let yourself calm down, you'd see how obvious and beautiful God's truth is.

**Me:** You wanted my reasons, you're getting my fucking reasons.

**Me:** The sacred text central to the church is bad fanfiction for a wildly irrelevant and outdated anthology of shitty, prescriptive, morally reprehensible fantasy fiction written (and, might I add, heavily edited) by a bunch of old men with a multitude of agendas over 2,000 years ago.

**Me:** Its founder was a horny farmboy (admittedly charismatic, as cult leaders tend to be) who made shit up as he went along until he got himself shot in a jail cell and a raging racist with a neckbeard took over for him.

**Me:** CHURCH HISTORY.

**Me:** So there, you happy? You got it out of me!

**Old Friend:** How did you get so hateful? You used to be so cool. I'm so sorry you let Satan into your heart. You're just playing right into his lies, and you're smarter than that.

Last night I'm there, and I start chatting with this guy named Yoshiki- turns out he's a designer and screenwriter who has a weekly movie show on Tokyo TV (http://twitchfilm.com/2011/01/screenwriter-yoshiki-takahashi-talks-cold-fish.html).  I speak enough Japanese to keep up, and the conversation turns to Buddhism and religion.  When I tell him I used to be mormon, he's fascinated, and says he's studied Mormonism for years. 

This was a surprise to me- most Japanese people confuse us with Jehovah's Witnesses, Spiritualists, or the Amish, so I was pretty amazed when he started talking about the Utah War, Joseph Smith's martyrdom, the westward movement, and all that.  Really fun conversation about the church, in Japanese, for about an hour.

My bishop up here is pretty crazy, he isn't a very good bishop and doesn't have much patience. But I got the coffee maker to help with the drowsiness my anti-depressants cause. I was staying up late one night catching up and then getting ahead in homework when at around 3am my neighbor comes barging in and sees me brewing coffee. I'm pretty sure he ratted me out, he's the bishops little lap-dog. I had missed some church because I was too depressed to get up some Sundays and go. Which I tried explaining but, he wouldn't have any of it. He inferred that me being depressed meant that I was sinning, even thought I told him otherwise. He isn't a very understanding person. So the combination of missing church every once and while and buying the coffee maker was enough for him to remove my ecclesiastical endorsement. Essentially, me buying the coffee maker, showed that I was openly rebelling against the school and that I had to be punished for it.

Like many other missionaries I suffered from a lot of self hatred on my mission. This hatred stemmed from the belief that failure was the result of laziness and disobedience.  I was hardly perfect on my mission but I tried so damn hard and worked my ass off.  

Anyway, the night I returned as I was laying in bed, jet lagged, trying to sleep the self hatred became exceptionally profound.  It was so overwhelming that I couldn't take it so I got out of bed and woke up my parents. With my eyes full of tears and without going into specifics I asked my father for a blessing.

Of all the blessings he's given me, this one stood out for its particularly strong language. My father promised/commanded to feel a ""burning in my bosom"" that would be a testimony to me that my sacrifice had been excepted and that I had served an honorable mission.  After the blessing my mom looked at me and smiled, my dad gave me a hug and I went back to bed.  I felt better, not because the problem went away but because I believed I would soon feel the spirit which would make everything better.

I got back into bed and began to wait for the promised manifestation. As the hours passed the self hate returned. The next morning when I saw my mom she asked if I felt better,  I didn't but I grunted a simple yes.  

Over the next few days I began to question why I had not received the promised experience.  In my mind the only logical conclusion was that I was the broken part of the equation.  God was there and probably loved me, my dad was a righteous priesthood holder and could receive revelation but I was unworthy. I was unable to receive the spiritual confirmation due to my imperfection.  

It took years before I to even consider the possibility that it was the church/theology that was the source of my self-hate, and not me. 

Ironically, the day that I realized that church was complete bull shit I felt an overwhelming sense of peace and relief.  I couldn't help but laugh, because the exact experience I had been taught would confirm the truthfull-ness of the church finally came in response to me rejecting it.",,False,self,t5_2r0gj,False,,,True,t3_18w3u8,http://www.reddit.com/r/exmormon/comments/18w3u8/the_night_i_returned_from_my_mission/,

I was lucky in that my parents and leaders had taught me early on how to recognize the spirit. Because of this, I was able to gain a testimony of that amazing book at a very early age. 

I'm 34 years old now and I've read the Book of Mormon more times than I can remember. Each time I read it, the spirit gives me peace and understanding which confirms to me that the book is true.

Recently, I watched *The Lion King* with my daughter. There is a part in *The Lion King* where Mufasa appears in the clouds and tells Simba that Simba has forgotten him and therefore forgotten who he is. When I watched this, I was almost moved to tears.

Fortunately, as I mentioned before, I was taught from a young age how to recognize the spirit. I know now that *The Lion King* is true. Simba is the one true king of Pride Rock and Mufasa is watching over us. And despite the lack of evidence that there is a Pride Rock or that lions are able to talk, I know that if you watch *The Lion King* with an open heart and allow yourself to be receptive to the spirit, you can also know of its truth.

In Mufasa's name,
Amen.

I begrudgingly would admit that we were and are in the upper social circles in our ward and community both from a ""spiritual"" and ""temporal/$$"" perspective. We mailed letters (in a respectful way that gave them the choice to read our reasons if they wished) to 20 or so people in the ward.

1373334553.0,149,self.exmormon,1hwmpc,I gave a talk a few weeks ago-- only to have the stake president get up and negate all the points I made. (story + talk inside),174,25,82,http://www.reddit.com/r/exmormon/comments/1hwmpc/i_gave_a_talk_a_few_weeks_ago_only_to_have_the/,"I gave this talk about eight weeks ago but only just thought to post it here.

Background: At the time I was asked to give a sacrament meeting talk, I was a few weeks out from marrying a non-member (we're now married and very happy). The second counselor ~~approached~~cornered me and said he was positive I was the person to fill a ten minute gap in the next week's service. I reluctantly agreed.

A few minutes later he pulled me aside and thanked me for saying yes and then revealed his true intentions. ""This will be a great opportunity for you to bear your testimony in front of your fiancee! This could be what gets her to be baptized."" Yeah... well screw that.

My goal was to rattle a few cages without getting a brick through my window (yay living in Davis County, Utah) throughout the week. Here's the talk in its entirety (I haven't proofread it since I gave the talk, sorry for errors).

---

“Everybody is a genius. But if you judge a fish by its ability to climb a tree, it will live its whole life believing that it is stupid.” This quote is commonly attributed to Albert Einstein. It has not been confirmed but I do not think that’s important. Whoever said it, I believe it to be valuable advice.


In eighth grade, my history teacher would say that in order for the brain to remember something, it requires repetition.  “Everybody is a genius. But if you judge a fish by its ability to climb a tree, it will live its whole life believing that it is stupid.”



As I taught Sunday school for the last 9 months or so, a theme I repeatedly tried to include in my lessons was that there are so many good people around the world doing so many good things, that it would be a shame to discount someone’s wisdom based on what religion they believe in. With that in mind, I’d like to modify this quote to fit the intent of my talk this afternoon. “Everybody is a genius. But if you judge a non-Mormon on their ability to be a Mormon, they will live their whole life feeling inferior.” Not only will they feel inferior, but you will miss many opportunities to learn and grow.



One of my greatest personal heroes is Tenzin Gyatso- the Dalai Lama. He is the fourteenth Dalai Lama and the leader of Tibetan Buddhism. He said “This is my simple religion... the philosophy is kindness” If you boil down our religion to the most basic form, I believe this would be true for all of us. Christ taught love and we are to be like him. We show love through kindness to everyone around us. If we are truly disciples of Christ, then our religion is kindness. 



So let us not let our first thoughts of someone be concerned with whether or not they drink coffee or smoke, whether or not you can give them a book of Mormon, how long it would take to get them baptised, or what religion they affiliate with. Let our first thoughts be an eagerness and willingness to learn from them and to show them kindness.



We must look past affiliations and be willing to teach and learn kindness from everyone. Newly elected Pope of the Catholic church- Pope Francis has this to say on the subject: “Dialogue is born from an attitude of respect for the other person, from a conviction that the other person has something good to say. It assumes that there is room in the heart for the person’s point of view, opinion, and proposal. To dialogue entails a cordial reception, not a prior condemnation. In order to dialogue it is necessary to know how to lower the defenses, open the doors of the house, and offer human warmth.”



The Dalai Lama, in so many words, agrees. He says “If we look at bees, we find that they work on the basis of cooperation even though they have no religion, constitution, or laws. Their natural form and way of life demand that they work together; otherwise, they cannot survive. Humans claim to be superior beings but we are, in fact, sometimes inferior to these small insects. Our basic situation demands that we live together, and hence, we work together. It is a natural law but sometimes we act in quite the contrary manner.”



I hope that as I go through a few more teachings from the Pope and the Dalai Lama that you will give it a cordial reception.



On the subject of those with means becoming protectors of humanity, Pope Francis said this. “It means protecting all creation, the beauty of the created world, as the Book of Genesis tells us and as Saint Francis of Assisi showed us. It means respecting each of God’s creatures and respecting the environment in which we live. It means protecting people, showing loving concern for each and every person, especially children, the elderly, those in need, who are often the last we think about. It means caring for one another in our families: husbands and wives first protect one another, and then, as parents, they care for their children, and children themselves, in time, protect their parents. It means building sincere friendships in which we protect one another in trust, respect, and goodness. In the end, everything has been entrusted to our protection, and all of us are responsible for it” This is no different than any advice given to us by our leaders in general conference.



Again, the Dalai Lama agrees. He says “If you neglect others, forget about their welfare and think only about yourself, eventually you’ll be the loser. Thus, the basic structure of human society requires a sense of responsibility based on altruism and compassion. The ultimate source of happiness is altruism. Success in life depends on determination, will and courage. And the source of this courage and determination is altruism. Sometimes anger and hatred create a kind of energy and determination. This determination, however, rarely has good consequences because the energy created by anger and jealousy is blind, harmful and can even be fatal.”


	
In the same speech, the Dalai Lama goes on to say “When we are born, we are free from all ideology and religion that come later, but we are not free from the need for human affection. A baby cannot survive without it.”



How true that is. In all situations when we are alone or defenseless- like we are at birth, there is something we crave- love and affection. Many of us find that through prayer and scripture study. Non religious people find this through family and friends or through meditation and music. The most important thing for us is not to worry about whether or not a person is praying to our same God or finding comfort in the same scriptures as you, but to make sure they have the love and affection through whatever avenue we can offer. Sometimes it’s friendship, a homemade meal, or a shoulder to cry on. Don’t let religion get in the way of being more like Christ. Don’t let sexual orientation, political affiliations, race, health, income, or anything else get in the way of being more like Christ.


Brother (redacted) asked me to speak on revelation and I feel I have done just that. In the Pope’s and Dalai Lama’s effort to do good and help people, they receive revelation and we could all benefit from learning from all people trying to do good. There are few things in this life that we can know with a certainty. I can honestly say that I know without a doubt that we are meant to be kind to everyone we encounter.

---------

I was followed by a sister RM. Then the stake president. He gets up and says how thankful he is for the Sister's testimony (calling her by name). then says something along the lines of ""and of course for Brother... this brother's insights"" Yay, thanks for forgetting my name for the thousandth time (He did the same thing at my missionary interviews)(Oh- he also forgot about me for a couple months when I was called onto seminary council. I was shocked that I was supposed to be set apart when I heard so from my peers).

Anyway, in his talk he touted on and on about how great sister RM's are, blah blah blah. then he goes on about ""tolerance"" and how despite  worldy opposition (read: the gay agenda), we can still tolerate all sorts of people. Bitch, not once did I preach tolerance. I preached love.

1355845350.0,147,self.exmormon,151zo3,"Even if Joe Smith was a prophet, and the BoM is a factual book of scripture, the church is still not true, because by their own definition, they are in apostasy.",159,12,38,http://www.reddit.com/r/exmormon/comments/151zo3/even_if_joe_smith_was_a_prophet_and_the_bom_is_a/,"Consider the following scenario:

A prophet received personal wisdom from Christ, and was instructed to start and lead Christ's church on this earth.  This prophet then gathered together other followers of Christ and began organizing the church as he'd been instructed, sending out missionaries to teach people and bring them into the fold.

This prophet dies without leaving a clear succession path, and several groups of people band up behind different people who all claim to be the rightful heir to the leadership of the church.  This causes a schism among the membership - some going one way, some going another.  Each leader has a seemingly legitimate claim to the rightful leadership; a position here, a revelation there, a letter from the original prophet over there.  Things get fairly ugly at times, with each group claiming to be the ""true"" church.  the various leaders of the rival sects even excommunicate each other on more than one occasion.

Each sect tries to take with it what its leader and followers believe to be the most important parts of the gospel, while each leader also puts their own spin on it.  Over time, all the sects drift away from what was originally taught.  Eventually, certain members of the various sects look back on history and realize that their church isn't doing things the way they were done in the original church, so they try to reform it.  Sometimes, they try to change it from within, and sometimes, they break off, forming new groups that believe as they do - reformationists, if you will, who are trying to get back to what the church originally was.

The largest and most powerful group, meanwhile, begins to become a bit *too* big.  it's spread so far that it really can't enforce a complex uniform belief system very well.  in order to combat this, it simplifies its teachings.  It picks and chooses from the scriptures, and reduces its doctrine down to the absolute ""bare essentials"", while ignoring or hiding some of the more ""uncomfortable"" parts of its past.  Eventually, this sect evolves so much that it no longer even resembles the church set up by the original prophet.

Now that that scenario is in your mind, what is the name of the prophet mentioned in the first paragraph?  The majority of TBMs would say ""Peter"", and would believe that I was describing the so-called ""Great Apostasy"".  They would, of course, be wrong.  The prophet is Joseph Smith, and the ""largest and most powerful group"" would be the Brighamite, or mainstream LDS sect.

It's no secret, of course, that when Joseph died, he left behind a succession crisis.  What most TBMs *don't* know is the extent of this crisis.  Many of them have never even heard the name James Strang, and they don't know that the popular story of Brigham speaking and appearing with Joseph's countenance doesn't have a single contemporary source (every account we have of this so-called phenomenon was written years after the fact).  They don't know that Brigham required everyone that followed him to be re-baptized into *his* church, making it absolutely clear that they were moving on from Joseph's church.

Furthermore, most TBMs don't realize just how far removed today's church is from the church of Joseph's time.  The church under Joseph was a place where you could go to a funeral and expect to hear a heady sermon on the nature of god that rivals the Nicene creed in its complexity and absurdity.  The church today is a place where we recycle 4 topics over and over and over and over... tithing, obedience, prayer/scripture reading, and ""the atonement"".  The church then was a place where one could expect a random congregation member to stand up and begin yammering away in ""the pure adamic language"", not unlike the ""speaking in tongues"" that happens in some born-again congregations.  The church members of today would probably try to have you committed, or at the very least quietly removed from the meeting, if you happened to break into glossolalia.  The church of then was a place where women would exercise the ability to anoint and bless the sick.  The church of now has been known to discipline women who even express a *desire* to perform priesthood ordinances (hell, as we've seen over the last week or so, there are some members that think women should be disciplined just for wearing pants!).

**TL;DR:** by the standards set forth by the Mormons themselves - the standards by which they judge every other Christian church in existence - the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints is in apostasy.  Even if Joseph Smith were a true prophet (which he wasn't), the church ***still isn't true.***",,False,self,t5_2r0gj,False,,,True,t3_151zo3,http://www.reddit.com/r/exmormon/comments/151zo3/even_if_joe_smith_was_a_prophet_and_the_bom_is_a/,

1361179654.0,142,self.exmormon,18qrt9,I've told my parents. I was not prepared for their reaction. ,175,33,42,http://www.reddit.com/r/exmormon/comments/18qrt9/ive_told_my_parents_i_was_not_prepared_for_their/,"So I've just found this subreddit. I don't know if you're interested in my story, but I'd like to share it. Tell me if this is the wrong place to do so.

I finally did it. After just a single semester away at college, reality hit me in the face and I realized that I don't believe the religion of my childhood. My parents, however, are Mormon to the core. In fact, they married each other because the Lord told them to, even as they were engaged to other people. They hated each other for 10 years of their marriage but stayed together because it was ""God's will."" 
So naturally, I was a little hesitant to tell them. 
I was just talking with them about college in their room last night when I mustered up the courage. I closed their door and sat down in front of them on the bed. All the fear and anxiety that had plagued me for months when I thought of telling them, was gone. I was right. I knew that I was right. I wasn't rebelling or leaving the church to spite them. I loved my parents. But I had to do what was right for me. 
Here's how the conversation went. 

Me: ""Ok. I have something that I have to tell you both. I feel like you've already guessed, but it's the elephant in the room and it would be insulting to your intelligence to ignore it.""

Dad: ""Ok. Go ahead.""

Me: ""I don't believe in God.""

-insert stunned and initially defensive silence here- 

Dad: ""Alright. Why not?""

Me: ""Well the list could go on for ages. But what it really comes down to is this: I was living my life the way I was supposed to, going to church, reading the scriptures and praying morning and night. I knew that I was on my own now and that I had to gain a testimony for myself. I've never prayed so sincerely. I've never been so humble. I just needed to know the truth. No answer came. People told me 'In the Lords own time.' So I kept waiting. But life didn't. Life kept right on beating me up and knocking me down. It came time when I needed help. I prayed harder than I ever had before. I just needed to know that there was a God and that he loved me. I could handle everything else. No answer came. So I got angry. That wasn't the right response, but that's what I did. I decided that if God exists then he was just testing me. I don't want a part of a God that experiments to see how far I'll bend before I break. All I needed was one confirmation. I have had more than that in my lifetime. But he was silent. So either God exists but is not a God that I care to follow, one who doesn't give a damn about me, or he's not real. I'm inclined to believe the latter."" 

-more silence-

Dad: ""But I've given you blessings. I've felt the spirit with you and because of you. Think about all the times you've felt it too. I know you have. I know you've had a testimony before."" 
He then bore his testimony about how the family prayed before we moved to Utah. 
""And I would even say to you that the spirit is here now as we've been talking.""
Yeah, I felt nothing. 

Me: ""I'm human Dad. I make mistakes. In fact, I'm perfectly willing to contemplate that I'm wrong here. Maybe if I had waited another two weeks God would have sent me a big Neon Sign. But I wasn't willing to put my life on pause. I don't have all the answers. I look at life as an equation. I've got certain variables here. Some are missing, some are wrong and will be replaced as I learn more in life. But with these variables that I've got today, with this equation, there is only one solution.""

Dad: ""You just have to have faith."" 

Me: ""But that's just it Dad. I can't. And I have a hard time believing that God made me as logical and reasonable as I am, and then would tell me to forget all that 'inappropriate intellectualism' and take it all on faith. That's not who I am. That's not how HE made me."" 
He sat there thoughtfully for a moment. My mother said nothing. Finally he spoke up and said. 

Dad: ""We love you Rach. And this is your life. You know what we believe, you know how we've raised you. But I know that you are a good person. I know that we have prepared you for this world. And I know that as long as you continue to seek for the truth, the way you are today, you will have the life that your mother and I have always wanted you to have. We love you. We are not disappointed in you. And thank you for coming to us so honestly. I love you Rach."" 

At which point I cried. I never thought they would be able to accept me. I never dreamed that they would even attempt to understand why this is the path I've chosen. 

So there you go /r/exmormon. Not all TBM parents are crazy and intolerant. I've been really lucky here. In fact, I've been really blessed. haha.

Hello Mormons.

Look at your church.  Now at the truth.  Now back at your church.  Now back to the truth.

Sadly, yours isn't true, but if it stopped justifying Joseph Smith's polyandry and switched to claiming that he sinned, it could look like it's true.

Look down, back up, where are you?  You're in a bar with a beer your prophet drank.

What's in your hand?  Back at me.  I have it, it's a seer hat with two billion tithing dollars.

Look again, the dollars are now a shopping mall.  Anything is possible when your church is run by Old Guys and not a lady.

This is my brother Owen, chatting with his fiance about getting married one month before he committed suicide on June 8th, 2006.

May 12th 2006:

&gt;12:54 AM so lets see -- according to your religion: Church leaders: don't marry out side of the church, According to your revelator for the ward: don't marry owen, and according to your revelator and family leader: don't marry owen. If your religion is true then it's true [name removed]. Either listen to it or dont but how can I feel useful when your entire life base and belief system says I'm an evil little piece of crap who is no good for you
?
How can I not feel like crap?

...
&gt;1:00 AM What am I supposed to do [name removed]? I'm coming so close to loosing myself forever, I feel like giving up, and there are 2 ways for me to give up: suicide, and forcing myself to believe your beliefs

...
&gt;1:07 AM I really don't have much left in me -- almost all that's left is becoming a hate for the church because it's the wall between us..


...
&gt;1:10 AM me: last night I could hardly sleep - i just can't
  though I must say, I'm tired enough to probably sleep
  very nicely
  but it doesn't matter what I'm doing, you are on my mind. I can't say anything or do anything with out knowing that I miss you

Not long after this he received an e-mail saying the wedding was called off because of the differences in belief. Around a week after that I received word while serving as a missionary that he took his life. I thought God wanted me to stay 'serving' instead of going home to be at the funeral, a decision I regret to this day. 

I miss him like crazy.

I believe this religion deserves to be criticized, exposed and destroyed. I hope the words of my younger brother Owen will motivate others as it has motivated [myself](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rDPSjMCb6O8&amp;list=PL5BDC65C4CB972B35) and my [older brother](http://youtu.be/GmeSmlHyDRU), to help those trapped in this destructive belief system.

The lds church never sent a confirmation letter back i assumed i wasnt a member anymore.  Well last christmas i learned the truth the church called up my mom and told them i wanted to leave and asked her if i should get me records removed. She said no. So they didnt. She didnt tell me this of course and kept quiet about it. Guess trying to sneak me into heaven i dont know. I'm thirty. Im well past a legal adult and can make my own decissions. Rather infuriating.

This last friday i got a letter sent to my business address asking for my current address so they can send and update my records to my current ward. I have literally not stepped foot into a church since i left my parents house after high school.  I was raging mad that not only had the lds church not removed me but now were actively bothering me. I have a female employee who is going through a similar problem where they send letters to her inlaws house, her parents house, and even leave messages on her cellphone trying to find her current ward.  And now i can expect the same.

The next day after receiving the letter my parents called up to say they were in town and wanted to go eat lunch together.  I went and right as i met them in the parking lot i told them we are probably going to have a fight. Then i told them i put in my paper to be removed from the church and i know they were called and told them no. I explained it was extremely disrespectful they ignored my own decissions and wishes etc. my mom screamed and cried at me for about an hour in the parking lot. My dad wouldnt even look at me.  Some of the highlights of my moms histerical hissy fit were she threatened to run into on coming traffic. I literally had to hug her and hold her out of fear she would make good on her crazy threat. At another point she was saying my life is too good and i need to hit rock bottom so i need to turn to god. Then at another point she said she wished i was dead rather than leave the church. She also said it would be better if i got in a car wreck and got paralized. And at yet another point she was screaming why couldnt i just have waited till they were dead to leave the church and i was doing this just to hurt her.  I could go on and on about the crazy crazy crazy statements she was yelling at me.  It was all rather heart breaking.

I went home and literally just laid in my bath tub till 10pm.  Such utter bullshit.

I (over)hear conversations regarding the new missionary ages incessantly. Several of my friends (all females) have hastily heeded the Lord's hastening. I watched one of my semi-good friends dance - literally dance - with giddiness, while simultaneously sputtering ""the church is trueeee.."" I assumed my familiar, reserved, perhaps cagey, position.

I really don't know how much longer I can take this place. If I had a dollar for every LDS pretense that I've encountered, detected, and destroyed in the past year, I'd have more money than Mitt. 

Only the ""wise"" Mormons know that the Word of Wisdom cannot possibly be a health code, but rather an arbitrary order (quite representative of God's fiat en masse, if you ask me) which promises divine compensation. A thinking person would question such decrees (divine command theory - look it up), but nope - not Mormons; in an act of sheer duplicity, Mormons will simultaneously refrain from coffee and tea and somehow still have the courage to question a familiar authority which forces, say, Islamic women to wear burqas. Caffeine isn't against the word of wisdom (as the lds newsroom oddly needed to clarify), and yet, BYU soda machines are caffeine free.

And then there's the big happy families that Mormons purport to create. Perhaps at the risk of sounding conceited, I might go so far as to say that all Mormons (even the wisest) (pre)suppose that their church raises the greatest families in the world. All of them. They have to believe it. And this assumption is often defended fallaciously; for some time, I've wanted to rename the no-true-scotsman fallacy the no-true-Mormon fallacy. It seems fitting - after all, Mormons ought to be awarded in some way, for successfully using the fallacy to rid themselves of the millions of exceptions. A miraculous achievement.  If only they knew that there existed a subreddit, nearly 7000 strong, which thrives off of the painful stories (perhaps exaggerated - but understandably so) that can only result from an ostenatious, incorrigible, delusional, pious force that Mormon families are. If only my aunt could see the vulgar complacency that lies in the platitude: ""the secret to having it all, is believing you already do""; perhaps then she would think twice before scrawling it, in the banal Deseret fashion, on a cute plaque in her kitchen for her young eyes to see.

If I didn't need to attend a 10 AM new testament class tomorrow, I'd give more than 2 examples of such pretenses.

But, moving on, the degree of inclination that Mormons have regarding the veracity of the Joseph Smith narrative is so damn high that it might as well be called axiomatic.

Think about that. 14-15 million people unquestionably believe (or once believed, or were brought up to believe) that an American farm boy (whose stupidity and intelligence are both paradoxically referenced to confirm the faith) received a vision (in an area with so much zealotry that they now historically call it ""the burnt over district"" ) in which he saw two personages (or perhaps one, or several) descend from a pillar of light (or fire) that told him to join none of the churches (or to rest assured-forgiveness was his) to translate a book from golden tablets (now gone) about a people who are believed to be the principle (ahem, among the) ancestors of the American Indians, that, during their prevalence, rode horses (loanshift alert! -might be tapirs or deer), smelted iron, raised cattle and pigs and goats, and participated in gigantic battles, resulting in millions of deaths (which there should be evidence of, specifically at Hill cumorah - unless you implement the ad hoc hypothesis, dubbed the ""two cumorah theory"") actions which supposedly attest to a divine creator (who seems to be capricious and sadistic as well).

It really is appalling. At the risk of sounding too reductionistic, I would say that Mormonism is a blatant example of the malleability of the human mind, and its corresponding meta/community hive mind, both of which are ruthlessly contorted to confirm and reconfirm church doctrines. I'm surprised that Mormons haven't grown thoraxes after a century of bee imagery (which, true to his faith, Ballard reiterated yet again this last eventful Sunday). I am amazed by the amount of contradictions  that Mormons are able to uphold, without the slightest twinge of cognitive dissonance, but the one contradiction that amazes me the most is the paralyzing amount of pragmatism that Latter Day Saints live by. I still remember the day in seminary where one kid legitimately, and wisely, asked what the point of learning was in this life if we were just going to be omniscient in the next. On that day, I learned what Nietzche meant when he said that Christianity was the real one guilty of nihilism. My father understands my concerns (somewhat/superficially) with the church, but ultimately ends up asking me, without fail: to what end? Naturally, I hate the fallacious appeal to the consequences of belief. It tightens my ungarmented asshole in ways that other fallacies can't. Perhaps the reason why Mormons are so damn practical is because they already tried and miserably failed at implementing impossibly idealistic doctrines like the law of consecration. Nowadays, we are told that we aren't ready to fulfill these quixotic, heavenly plans. Damn right we aren't - and we never will.

I've been recognizing an accelerating shift in Mormonism. Things are changing. Obviously I suppose - after all, we (I mean they - dammit) have their own play and presidential candidate. They are attempting to hasten the work, and are ridiculously sending out tens of thousands more missionaries - as if the U.S. wasn't annoyed enough by the missionaries.

I'm guessing that in the next 10 years, Mormonism will take a turn for the worse. I sure hope I don't eat my words. What do you guys think?",,False,self,t5_2r0gj,1349855933.0,,coexist-3,True,t3_118qx8,http://www.reddit.com/r/exmormon/comments/118qx8/a_muchneeded_rant_and_predictions_for_the_next/,

It's taken a long time to work up to it but I needed to be honest and tell her. So I did:

She completely freaked out and broke down. Hyper-ventilating, crying hysterically and such. Keep in mind all I've said is that I don't claim to know. I know it ISN'T true but I thought I'd ease into it.

I told her Friday, today is Sunday. She won't look at me, acknowledge me. She took the time to tell me that she now thinks less of me as a person, husband and father. Last night she had me speak to her father on the phone. I guess this marital issue isn't one of those ""husband and wife things."" He gets on the phone and instantly starts off by telling me that the blood of my children is on my hands. WTF. Tells me this change and the decision to leave the standards will instantly and assuredly ruin my life and I will die in a drunk driving accident. WHAT CHANGE. If I wanted to drink or smoke or sleep around, I WOULDN'T HAVE TO LEAVE THE FUCKING CHURCH. I could just do it and lie about it later like a good Mormon. This poor excuse of a conversation continues on by him saying something and me providing a rebuttal using church doctrine. He asks why did I even marry his daughter 6 years ago if I had doubt. I answer by saying WE ARE TAUGHT TO SUPPRESS DOUBT. Would *you* do any different? Didn't think so. I had doubt, but suppressed it on the terms the church set up. But Like any intellectual, my doubt doesn't go away ""because.""

So once again in life, I am in a position of compromising how I actually feel. Proof?: I went to church today. More proof?: We have a Wednesday appointment with the bishop. Still not enough?: The missionaries are coming to our house to give the discussions so I can put the church through it's proper paces on the terms the Lord has set. As if being born in the church, getting baptized, getting the priesthood, getting my Eagle Scout, going on a full time mission and getting married in the temple wasn't a good enough opportunity for God to come into my life.

As I have posted before, I had been having doubts for a while when I finally told her that I did not believe that TSCC was true. Her initial reaction was what you would expect from a good TBM. After that I decided that I loved her more than I disliked the church, and that if going  to church and acting the part made her happy, then for the time being that is what I would do.

Fast forward a few months later. One night we were having a (by this time normal) conversation about why I did not believe. I remember I told her that I could not support a church that continued to prosecute gays via support proposition 8, and she agreed with me.

Rapidly over the next few weeks she began to read sites like mormonthink, and when we woke up this morning, she told me that the lesson ""The Three Witnesses"" was simply not something she could teach, as she did not believe that it happened as explained by the manual. I suggested that she might skip to a more palatable lesson, but my wife is a person more brave than I, and insisted in going to church to tell the Primary President why she couldn't teach that lesson.

I just wanted to share this, I know many of you struggle to balance a relationship with a spouse who does not have the same beliefs as you. I don't know how this will all work out, but it does seem to be working out for us.  

**EDIT: Update 1, better than expected!**

So my wife talked to the PP after sacrament meeting. She explained her specific problems about the material (three witnesses lesson) and told the PP that if she was going to teach the lesson, she could not give the whitewashed material straight from the manual. The PP's response: **""Yeah, I have doubts about that too.""** She told my wife that her calling was to teach, so be honest and that if the kids had questions about her answers to tell them to ask their parents. My wife proceeded to teach the lesson, not in an ""anti"" style, but being honest about some of the facts that the lesson manual conveniently avoids. Later that day the PP called my wife and told her that she could continue teaching as long as she wanted, or if she was having a hard time that she could be released, whichever was beter for her. One of the kids in the class is the bishop's son, so we will see how it goes. My wife and I are really hoping that we can become a ward project so that we can bask in the overflow of various baked goods. 

For all of you that have been asking why she did it, it was mostly so that she could feel better by not hiding. My wife had been struggling with teaching church history to the kids, and now that she's come ""clean"" with her issues, she feels much better as if a weight has been taken off her shoulders.

1370876210.0,132,self.exmormon,1g1pqf,My dad will never be proud of me... and it hurts.,143,11,99,http://www.reddit.com/r/exmormon/comments/1g1pqf/my_dad_will_never_be_proud_of_me_and_it_hurts/,"I'm 17 years old, just graduated high school as #2 in my class, have a full-ride scholarship to the school I plan on going to, and landed a sweet job this last week. Been a lurker for a few months.

Yesterday morning I was running about 5 minutes late for church (I still go because I live with my parents and love and respect them) and was expecting to just drive myself over. My dad then stayed behind to take me, which I thought was weird but didn't quite know what was up until I started putting my shoes on.
 
""Lets walk,"" he said. I now had an idea of what was comming. My parents know that I don't plan on going on a mission, and that I have serious doubts about the church, but they can't seem to come to grips with it. On the walk to church my dad asks me how things are going with my girlfriend (of almost 2 years), and I say it's all good. He then asks me if I want a temple marriage, ""no..."" I timidly say. 

""But doesn't she want a temple marriage!?""

""Not really...""

""Why not?""

I proceed to explain to him some of my future plans and I tell him a story. My girlfriend and I have talked about the possibility of marriage but have decided that it is best to not jump into  it. We have the idea to wait four years (when we would both be graduated from college) and see where we're at then. If we still love eachother and all then we'll go ahead. 

I tell my dad about how my girlfriend wasn't a very mormon girl when I met her, as he knows, but that she wanted to change for me. I was very TBM when I met her, so much so that I didn't try to even hold her hand until the day of my 16th birthday despite it being quite obvious we liked eachother a lot. I then started having doubts, and when I confided in her she was very releived saying that she wasn't sure if she could have made herself beleive in the church.

After telling him these things, my dad proclaimed, ""You make me weep."" That moment was the first time I had felt any hard feelings towards the church. While I don't agree with all that they teach I know that people can live happy, productive lives as a members of the church, and that a lot of what they teach about becoming a better person and service is something I beleive is good. But when my dad told me that I make him weep, all of that was gone. All I saw was a lifetime of indoctrination making my dad, one of the smartest people I know, blinded and intolerant. Nothing more than a puppet.

Later that night he wanted to talk to me some more, with my mother present. There was a lot said, both good and bad, but another thing was said that cut me to my core. I told my dad about how I'm on track to receive a bachelors &amp; masters in electrical engineering in just 4 years, by age 21.

""Who cares?""

My education has always been very important to me, and progressing at a fast rate has always made me happy. Knowing that my dad didn't care less about something so important to me hurt. Obviously he would rather me go and spend two years trying to convert people to mormonism, but I didn't quite understand the extent to how he felt about it. In his eyes he's failed as a father and I'm making horrible decisions that can only lead to an unhappy life, and he's sure of it as I've not been in the best of mood as late (no duh, you're telling me you'll never be happy for me on this path I've choosen).

This morning he confronted me again asking about why I never start conversations with him about the church. I tell him that I don't because it's awkard, and I don't think it's good for our relationship. He tells me that he thinks it's because I don't really want to know the truth. More is said and I reiterate my point that I don't think these conversations are good for our relationship, as evidence by how we're both upset now.

He then leaves me with the words, ""There is a god, and one day you'll stand before him to be judged and all you'll have to say for yourself is these lame philosophies that you've been telling me.""

I wonder if he's right, did I really ever try that hard to find out if it's true? I read the book of mormon and did the moroni challange, felt nothing, but is that enough?

Life is hard. Oh well.

Edit:
Thanks for all your kind words! I wrote this just before I went to work this morning and was feeling down most of the day. Come lunch time I was able to pull this up on my phone and after reading your many replies I feel a good bit better.

I would like to clear one thing up though: My dad isn't a bad man. He has handled my disbelief much better than many other parents, according to all the stories in this thread and others. It's just in these last two days he's been on one. While he may never be proud of my decisions that doesn't mean I'm getting kicked out of my family or they're cutting off support or anything. My parents made it a point throughout my childhood to let me make my own choices. However, they understandably tell me how they feel about my choices. And it's not that my dad doesn't think my education is important - he'd just much rather see me get my degree at age 23.",,False,self,t5_2r0gj,1370921897.0,,,True,t3_1g1pqf,http://www.reddit.com/r/exmormon/comments/1g1pqf/my_dad_will_never_be_proud_of_me_and_it_hurts/,

This line is the most important line in the article, and it has been removed. It is the most important because Brigham Young explicitly prophesies that blacks will never receive the priesthood.

1363534478.0,132,self.exmormon,1agtiu,A small challenge.  It's time to move past linguistic manipulation.,151,19,57,http://www.reddit.com/r/exmormon/comments/1agtiu/a_small_challenge_its_time_to_move_past/,"Most of us are aware of the loaded the language, but how often do we perpetuate that language after we have left?  The LDS church spends quite a bit of effort, time, and money crafting their brand.  I propose that we think a little more carefully about the language we're using and ask ourselves if there isn't a better way.  Regardless, recognition is the first step to regaining control. 

----

**The dangling initial** 
----

This is most often the middle initial, but occasionally it will be the first name.  The men with the appointed title of prophet or apostle will almost always have this.  When the initial is lacking, a full name will be used instead.  It has a certain flow, length of importance, and developed sense of authority.  It presents the business look the corporation is going for.   Instead, I recommend we **drop the title and initial**.  Use the full name as applicable.  Compare President Thomas S. Monson with Tommy [self described], Thomas, or Thomas Monson.  Remove the deference in language and you remove a large portion of the emotional manipulation.

----

**The nonsensical titles**
----

Elder.  Since when is an 18 year old boy ""an Elder"".  It's an arbitrary title that implies a sense of authority or experience.  Neither of which is really true.  Missionaries as a whole are the most restricted class in the entire LDS church.   The nonsensical titles also apply to the supposed Prophet, Seer, and Revelator for the board of directors (12), or the title of apostle for the next 560 partners [8 x 70].   Yet, even they are not above the correlation committee (see Boyd Packer's recent recant and the Poleman back-peddle of the 80's) or newsroom (rewriting talks for at least the last 20 years).   See also ""president"" of various organizations, especially among women.  The relief society ""president"" is still completely non-autonomous.  *All* actions and talks are approved by the men above her.  Try calling missionaries by their first name, if known.  Some won't tell you for this exact reason.  Otherwise, **drop the meaningless titles**.  Refer to the point above for leveling the field of communication. 

----

**THE Church**  
----

The LDS like to think that they are the only religion, or that they have some special claim to the name of Jesus Christ.  Even [the official recommendations](http://www.lds.org/handbook/handbook-2-administering-the-church/selected-church-policies) are to use ""The Church"" or ""The Church of Jesus Christ"" as the title.  It's a self-glorified position that is not held by the sect. I recommend we call them what they are.  **Call them the Mormon Church or the LDS Church**.   Both are fully descriptive and recognized by members and non-members alike. 

----

**Apostates, heretics**  
----

It's a running joke to refer to ourselves as apostates.  I'll admit, I have a hard time with this one as well.  It's a legitimate use of the term, but it carries baggage beyond what most of us are trying to say.  It's a stop-think word that believing members hear and shut down with.  Everything you say after the admission of an apostate might as well be from Satan himself.  Instead, I recommend that we **use a description rather than a term**.  Say that you do not believe in certain parts of the dogma or the authority of the leaders.  Yes, it takes longer to get the information across; however, you'll do so without completely severing the lines of communication with believing members. 

----

**Assignment or calling**  
----

I propose that we stop using the word ""calling"" entirely.  God didn't ask you to clean the church.  God didn't ask you to give a talk.  God didn't ask you to teach a class no one wanted to attend.  God didn't ask you to make peanut butter.  God didn't ask you clean the multi-billion dollar mall while answering questions about the religion that owns it.  **You were given an assignment, not a calling of God.**  Let's call it what it is. 

----

**Request or invitation** 
----

To invite is a sign of friendship.  An extension of a favor, or inclusion into the group.  Yet, in the LDS church, it's also used to manipulate the response.  How often do you hear the phrase, ""I want [God wants] to invite you to...[return to church, give a prayer, accept a calling, clean the church, help so and so move, or otherwise for for me and the org]"".   You're not being invited, you're being supplicated.  Despite the language, you are in the position of power.  You can say no.  In addition to protecting yourself from the technique, you need to be careful not to use the technique for evil. **Stop manipulating the answer or being manipulated by specifically crafted language**.

----

**Emotion or Spirit or [heartsell](http://www.bonneville.com/?nid=32)**
----

This brings me to the next point.  Emotional Manipulation.  To quote [Bonneville Communication](http://www.bonneville.com/?nid=32), ""Our unique strength is the ability to touch the hearts and minds of our audiences, evoking first feeling, then thought and, finally, action. We call this uniquely powerful brand of creative ""HeartSell""® - strategic emotional advertising that stimulates response."" The emotional videos were strategically crafted.  It's not ""touching"". It's not ""bringing in the spirit"". Let's call it what it is.  **It's emotional manipulation**.  

----

**Is nonbelief a sin**
----

You're in this forum, so I'm going to go with a *no* on this one.  However, we still refer to actions of non-beliefs as sins.  Let me say this plainly.  Drinking is not a sin.  Just because a small christian sect claims it's a sin does not make it so.  **Let's stop referring to these actions as sins** just as we do not refer to blood transfusions as sins. 

----

Of course watch your language around active LDS members, and consider the impact before you flaunt your new found terminology.  Some believing Mormons will catch the subtle differences.  They may be rubbed the wrong way without knowing, they may try to correct you, or may fully understand your intent.  The latter will likely result in an emotional reaction or shut-down.  It varies by person.  I also understand this is difficult.  I've been actively trying to remove the loaded terminology from my language for years with varying degrees of success.  It's just baked in there for too long. 

Now the open question, what am I missing, or do you think I'm reading too much between the lines? 

**PS**: To those who think this subtle subconscious manipulation isn't a thing, I suggest you read Boyd Packer's own talk on the deference side of the matter.

I saw a post a few days ago about how the church's view on women and mothers affected us girlies and well have been a little upset ever sense so I decided to post this mostly to get it off my chest. 


A few days after my 13th birthday I went through the delightfully embarrassing experience of my first period. Now naturally I didn't fully understand what was happening. Every month or so I got a stomach ache so bad I couldn't walk. This was some serious pain. I was missing at least one day of school if not more each month. My mom finally put the missed school days and my period together. She figured out that it wasn't stomach aches it was PMS and thought I was faking the severity. She mad me go to school even though I was balling from the pain. To be fair to my mom if any of her four children was going to fake being sick and even cry to make it believable it would have been me. I hated Jr High. I collapsed on the way to second period. There I am in the hall crumpled in a ball unable to get up, unable to stop crying, unable to do anything really. It was November. 911 gets called. Mom gets called. I go to the hospital. I don't remember how I got there or most of what happened. I do remember being in a hospital bed and having the doctor tell my mom and dad (when did he get there? yeah I don't know) not me, he didn't look at me at all, that he suspected a ""reproductive issue"". 

Doctor after clinic after specialist after hospital. 

It was March and the really nice female doctor tells me that I have virtually no chance of having a baby. EVER. 

I went to church a few weeks later. I don't remember what the official beehive class lesson was on but I do remember the teacher wrote ""men"" and ""women"" on the chalk board with a vertical line between them. She asked us what men got that women didn't. Being the smart little cookie that I am I raised my hand and said ""the priesthood"" she wrote it on the board. Then asked what women got that men don't. Long pause. Finally the girl in the class that hated me said ""we get to be moms"" why did it have to be her that brought it up. She didn't know about my issue, no one did. But why her? The other girls (even though I was dealing with a very ""adult"" issue at 13 we were still girls calling us young women was a real stretch) in the class started shouting out other answers. ""we get more hugs from our babies"" and other things along those lines. I start to silently cry. Silently crying is a skill I learned as a very small child which is a story for another post. 

No one noticed my tears. Would they have if I was one of the ""cool girls"" instead of the one they mocked? Then the teacher then said ""Motherhood is the greatest gift in the world, look at the board girls."" we all looked ""there is a whole list of things that you will someday have that your husbands will not"" I couldn't help thinking that I wouldn't have those things, I would NEVER have those things. 

I had nothing. 

I would never have anything. 

I was pointless. 

I ran from the room. Down the stairs, passed the library. I was in the nursery before I even realized that was were I was going. One of the girls in my class had a little brother with downs syndrome. He was in nursery and to this day he is the most happy, helpful and most positive person I have ever met. I ran in the room. He saw me and said ""its okay its okay"" I sat in a rocking chair holding him and listing to him babble on about the puppy he wanted for the rest of the church block. My leaders never came looking for me. They later told me mom that they thought I went to RS to talk to her. (sorry ladies but when a 13 year old girl runs out of class room you go after her. There were 3 adults there that day, one of them could have gone looking for me and the other girls would still have been supervised. They had no idea where I was!) 

After spending some time in the nursery I felt a little better. After church I told my mom what happened. She said she would tell me leaders about my issue. I then spent 4 years and 3 months in hell. Every time motherhood or children came up in the lesson the teacher would not make eye contact with me at all. It was so obvious that one of the other girls mentioned it to me once. At the end of the lesson they would throw in a ""if for some reason the Lord does not see fit to bless you with children you should pray to know what his plans for you are instead"" WTF it didn't occur to me that GOD was depriving me of something until my leaders brought it up.

At no point was adoption ever mentioned. 

In high school I had a hard time dating because well..... what was the point. I turned down a second date with one of the coolest guys in school because I didn't want to end up being an un-fertile burden to  him. I kind of wonder even now as an adult what would have happened between us if I has said yes to that second date....

In college I went inactive. The pressure to get married and have kids was just to much. I even told my bishop, who was also owned the McDonalds I was a manager at, that I didn't feel like coming because of my ""issue"" 

I started dating this guy. He was great. We stated sleeping together. No protection cause I cant have a baby right? So I ended up pregers. Went back to my doctor back home. Turns out that when she told 13 year old me that I couldn't have babies what she meant was I could get pregnant but I would just have a VERY VERY hard time staying pregnant. I lost the boyfriend. I hadn't yet told him I was pregnant. I lost the baby. The baby I have always wanted. He would have made a great dad. I would have made an amazing mom. 

I have been asked why I don't have kids so many times its ridiculous. Apparently I am very nurturing and motherly. What ever that means. 

I have had 3 other doctor confirmed miscarriages and one that lived long enough that they called it a stillborn. I don't even know how many times I was way late when I finally had my period. Some of those were probably miscarriages. 

So here I am 31. I still want to have a baby. I still can't. I have looked into adoption but I am not in a position financially for that to be fezable. Which I guess means that realistically I am not in a position financially to have a baby at all. Some days the pain of what I will never have is so sharp its just shy of unbearable. Other days I don't even think about it. But I have sense realized that I am not worthless, useless, or pointless.

When I was between 9-17 I had a very high sex drive. VERY high. Being from a very strict Mormon family I didn't know anything about what I was feeling or why, I just knew it felt good. So I masturbated frequently. My favorite method (before I discovered fingers) was crossing my legs and then rolling up a magazine or book and moving it back and forth really fast, to uh hit the right spot. You get the idea right? The book that was the perfect size to do it with? The gospel doctrine books. Yep. The ones with the prophets faces/ paintings on the front of them. I would roll it so that the faces were going face first into the warzone and then I would look down and say stupid things like ""yeah, eat that"". I have long out grown doing this and moved on to more, let's say adult, ways of having fun but I still feel a little dirty when I visit my parents and see all those books on the shelves.

It is for better *and* worse. This is not what she signed up for. This is not what she wanted when we were married in the temple, but we are married, and she signed up with me.

She has talked to her mother this morning, and told me ""she agrees that this is HUGE, but she's not mad at you or disappointed in you or upset with you or anything nasty against you, so you can put THAT worry out of your silly little head, okay? And she'll likely be here when you're home from work, I would imagine. And she loves you :-P And while you're still stuck with ME, you're stuck with them, so get used to it.""

We visited NYC and DC in late May. 

It was HOT outside! Around 90 degrees and being from Seattle, we were dying. So those of us 'normal' kids who brought tank tops and shorts took full advantage of the summer weather. Our clothes were school-appropriate (two-finger width on the tank top straps, shorts covering underwear (guys) and mid-thigh for girls. 

That was unacceptable to the chaperone moms. I was approached twice at breakfast to go change into a non-sleeveless shirt and longer shorts. I politely declined, stating ""It's a school trip, I'm following school dress code. I am not your child nor did I agree to adhere to your religion's standards."" 

One of the moms tattled on me to the choir director who (I eavesdropped) said, ""Are they within school dress code? Can you see her bra or underwear? Then they're okay. Leave it alone.""

My wife was catching up with her TBM dad, and had the following conversation:

**FIL:** So, how's your new promotion going?  How did your team take you being promoted to their boss?

**DW:**  It's been a learning curve, for sure. I miss not being able to do clinical work all the time, but am enjoying new responsibilites and opportunities.  All but one of my co-workers has taken it well.  She got red in the face and started screaming at me when I implemented the new schedule everyone had agreed to a few weeks before I took the new position.  she totally lost it.  If she didn't have 20+ years of good performance with the company, I would have had to write her up.  Luckily, she appologized later in the day and has behaved ever since. It was crazy, but she seems to be feeling beter.

**FIL:** I bet she isn't LDS, is she?

**DW:** *facepalm* Actually, she is LDS dad. In fact, she's very LDS.  She's the Stake Young Women's President, and her husband is the bishop of their home ward. He kids have all served missions.  The big reason she lost her cool was because she was going to have to start working one Sunday every seven weeks, just like every other part-time employee on the unit.

**FIL:** What? Wow! I wouldn't have expected a mormon to yell like that. That's not what good mormons do.

**DW:** Dad, being LDS doesn't have anything to do with it.  I know lots of LDS people who are idiots, and lots of non-lds people who are amazing. And vice-versa.  The choices people make are what determine if they are good or bad, and having one public outburst of frustration doesn't make her a bad person any more than not being LDS would make her a bad person.

**FIL:** Oh, but you know that's not how mormon's are supposed to act.

**DW:** That's not how ANYONE is supposed to act, regardless of their religion. Want a refill?

She gets up and walks into the kitchen. I follow. She looks at me with saddness in her eyes and says, ""And that's why it's going to crush my dad when I tell him we don't go to church anymore.""",,False,self,t5_2r0gj,False,,,True,t3_1cjzzg,http://www.reddit.com/r/exmormon/comments/1cjzzg/i_bet_she_isnt_lds/,

Hello again, everyone. Today I've made an unbelievable breakthrough that has me both excited, hopeful, and near in tears. My last post was about preparing for a discussion with my brother and father prior to flying down to visit them back last month. While I didn't have a full blown theological and philosophical discussion with either of them, we did have a few exchanges of thoughts which has bloomed into ongoing conversation over the course of the last month. Whatever bits of information I managed to provide apparently stuck with both my brother and father as they continue to come to me for clarification on their thoughts and for more information.

Anyways, moving forward. My mother is probably the most outrageously, unfailing, unwavering TBM I have ever known in my life. I've never known her to question anything and everything she does is driven by prayer. I had a lengthy phone conversation with her this afternoon which somehow went into my defection from the church. She asked me what it was that caused me to go from outwardly TBM to apostate and so seemingly quickly.

I immediately remembered a comment she made shortly after I told her I left the church; ""You left so you could live a life of sin"" were her words, or something along those lines. I started by explaining to her that leaving the church was the most difficult and emotionally distressing thing I've ever had to deal with and that my choice to leave was not an easy one but was a result of my proverbial shelf becoming overloaded with unanswered questions I've tucked away.

As we continued to speak she did something unthinkable. She asked for a few details on the issues in hopes that maybe she could provide an answer. Just prior to this, however, she made mention of how the BoA was a beautiful transcript and was obviously written through the guidance of god. So that was my starting point--The Book of Abraham. 

I mentioned to her that the BoA papyrus has been studied by Egyptologists, even by BYU, and was found to be a hoax and the facsimiles were nearly completely, if not 100%, erroneously translated. I also mentioned the Kinderhook plates, and various unknowns about Joseph Smith's polyandry and the concerning details surrounding that topic. While she was well aware of the polygamy aspect, she had no idea how far the rabbit hole truly went in regards to his polyandry and even the underaged girls who he married. 

Her initial reaction was what I expected; ""I just don't believe any of that. There's no way any of that can be true"". I calmly explained to her that these issues are recognized by the church and even quoted a few passages and statements from GA's and Prophets through the years. I explained to her that her reaction is almost exactly identical to mine when I stumbled on these things; ""No, that's not true. Get that away, I don't want to read or hear anymore of that"". She explained how she just felt sick and how she felt, deep down inside, that what I was saying was untrue. Then I made a comment that I've seen stated throughout this subreddit a number of times, ""If the church isn't true, wouldn't you want to know?"". My mom, at this point, broke down. It was absolutely heart breaking but after a few minutes, she collected herself. Then she said something that absolutely blew my mind, and I'll paraphrase as best I can, ""Please send me information on these topics. If what you say is true then I can't ignore them. Send me information so I can see if what you say is true and so I can discuss them with the bishop"". 

Never in my life would I have ever thought my mom would step back from her beliefs, even for a brief moment. This breakthrough is earthshaking for me. So with that, if anyone has ANY advice on how to ease discussion with her regarding these topics, I would graciously accept. The simple fact that I've planted any sort of seed with her has me in a state of shock. 

I want to finish by saying that the progress I've made and the recent progress I've made with my family would never have been possible without you guys. I'm overjoyed and filled with hope that, perhaps, I can break my family out of this terrible belief system they've spent their entire lives tied down to. None of this would have been possible without this amazing community. I love every single one of you.

Jane Elizabeth Manning James -Pioneer convert, like everyone else.  She believes its true, she bases her whole life on the fact.  She sees everyone else around her married and taking part in the temple, wants to be sealed to her black husband (who has the priesthood) - petitioned several times to take part in the temple - **denied**.  Keep in mind, she believes that she cannot be saved in the highest glory without temple ordinances.  

She tries a different approach.  Maybe the first presidency would consider adopting her into Joseph's family, so she and her family can be saved in the celestial kingdom.  (She knew Emma and Joseph and said Emma had considered adopting her and her family.) Not going to happen - **denied**.  

Then the first presidency decides to grace her with another option so she can get into the celestial kingdom:  *She can be sealed to Joseph Smith as an eternal slave.*  She desperately accepts, thinking the Mormon church is the only source of salvation.  The ordinance is performed, but she isn't even allowed in the temple - its done by a proxy.  

The church she has given her life to, the one she thinks will save her, that is led by prophets of God, has sealed her as an eternal slave, not even allowing her in the temple to complete the ordinance herself.  

I don't care if this is the culture of the time, I don't care if this is how people thought back then, this has got to be the biggest dick move from any organization I have ever heard of.  Talk about disturbing, to think you are going to be saved, but not really, you'll have the honor of being a slave to someone for eternity, that's all you are good for, that's all God is offering you - this is reprehensible.  I cannot fathom any group that would be this heartless to another individual.  

Then enter 1978, God changes his mind, you can be in the celestial kingdom now, a God like all the other mormons.  Unfortunately, you already consented to be an eternal slave to Joseph, and that's eternal.  Born at the wrong time I guess..

But it also felt sort of good. I'll let you decide. 

Backstory: I left the church years ago and most of my family is really judgemental.  My two older sisters treat me and my brothers who also left like crap, basically disowning us. I became a vegetarian a couple months ago but wasnt telling most my family because they are so judgemental. My mom called the other day asking if I'd be at the 4th of July barbeque, I told her I wasn't eating meat anymore and wasnt sure if I wanted to come. 

I ended up going and the second I walked in the rude comments and teasing began. (I knew this was going to happen.) After a couple minutes I just decided that if they weren't going to respect my beliefs I wasn't going to respect theirs anymore. My older sister comes in with ""how come its ok to eat plants since they talk to eachother?"" **And so I just said fuck it and said ""how come its ok for Joseph smith to have a 14 year old wife?""** She was dumbfounded and so I said ""If you're gonna be a bitch about my beliefs I'll be a bitch about yours.""

person: Hey I heard your girlfriend left you.  

man: Yeah. I'm really worried about her.  I keep reaching out to her, bringing food by the house, telling her I love her and I want her back.  She won't return my calls or come over anymore.  It's so sad.  I know she's really having a tough time right now.  I just want to help her. 

person: What happened? Why did she leave?

man: Intellectual reasons.

person: Intellectual reasons? What do you mean?

man: Well…I told her not to - I warned her again and again but she talked to some people who knew me from before.  They told her some things...

person: Like what?

man: Like that I was married to a bunch of women at the same time and had sex with lots of minors. That I pretty much plagiarized this book I got published and swindled a bunch of people out of their money - including her.  And that I lied to her about a lot of other things too. 

person: Whoa.  Did they have proof?

man: Yeah, but that's not how I feel things happened. 

person: Well, did you at least explain the evidence she had against you?

man: No. I  denied it.  I told her to search her heart and think about how she felt when she was with me. I'm just a man.  I'm not perfect.  I make mistakes just like everybody else.  But I'm also a really good person.  I mean, look at all the good stuff I've done for my relatives.  I've given them food, money, help when they need it. I do a lot.  And I did so much for her when we were together. I mean, I didn't give her food or money or anything but I gave her so much emotional support. I loved her so much. I still do.

person: Maybe if you just tell her the truth, let her know what you did and apologize for it, then you can at least try to work things out.

man: There is nothing for me to apologize for.  She's the one who needs to ask for my forgiveness.

person: What? Why?

man: Because she's being proud. 

person: Proud?

man: Yes.  That's how it always starts with these girls who leave me.  First she starts questioning my character because I tell her that I'll dump her if she supports her gay cousin's wedding or something minor like that. Then she hears a rumor from my past, starts digging around where I've told her not to and before you know it, she's breaking things off for intellectual reasons.

person: You keep saying that.  What do you mean, 'intellectual reasons'?

man: I mean she's letting the things she knows about me destroy the way she used to feel when she was with me. She's letting her intellect ruin our entire relationship. She needs to quit being so proud, stop thinking about my past and just remember how she felt when we were together. And if she doesn't and starts telling my future girlfriends about any of these things from my past - I will totally take her to court.

The ward my wife attends has quite a few people who are struggling with a lot of stuff - money, health, relationships, etc.  It seems weird that a guy would get up and immediately start off with ""I have a rad life.""

So I'm sitting pretty much dead center in the chapel, and I look up at this guy and make eye contact with him as he continues to say:

""I know that I have received these blessings because of decisions I made in this life, and in the pre-existence.""

Shut the door. Came back downstairs and was all flustered, obviously. Husband asked who it was. Told him it was the bishopric. He was upset. Visibly upset. I told him I asked them not to come by but that they probably would anyway. He said I should have told him who it was. Had he talked to them ""they would never fucking come back"". Go Husband! He's not TBM, never has been. He feels no need to resign, which bugs me, but its his choice. He just doesn't care enough. Which is probably a good attitude to have. But this was the first time he's shown actual animosity towards the church, and especially of their treatment of me. It was awesome to see. 

We had a lovely dinner, couple glasses of wine, and life moved on. It will be nice to have that final confirmation letter, its the last step. I can't wait!

I grew up in Utah, BiC, got excommunicated at 18 for being gay and acting on it. Family is all strongly Mormon and cut me off after I got exed. 8 years later we have a amicable relationship, they even met my boyfriend once. This week I learned that my boyfriend not only cheated on me, but infected both of us with HIV. My whole life has made a dramatic unexpected turn. Boyfriend moved out, taking himself, the dog, and his half of the rent money with him. I'm having to deal with getting insurance and medical tests and securing my health and my budget.
 
My TBM parents made their monthly Sunday check-in phone call today. I tried to hold as much back as I could but I broke down and turned into a blubbering fool. They were extremely caustic towards me, saying that they 'aren't surprised' and that they 'knew it would happen sooner or later' and 'it (they never refered to 'it' as HIV) was a plague sent (from whom?) to kill off the sinful sodomites', how 'none of this would have happened if I had stayed in the church and married a nice girl' and that I **'deserved it'**

If you are a TBM, your very exaltation depends on it!

I have read a number of unconfirmed reports of new temples significantly increasing the amount of tithing raked in for the area. The theory makes sense to me, since the people in that area would feel more incentive to pay tithing so they can attend the temple. It's important to remember that many people, especially older people, pay tithing essentially for the opportunity to attend the temple weddings of their children and relatives. Without a nearby temple, those weddings would often be done at the chapel instead.

Since it's impossible to actually look at church finances, it got me wondering how I could get close to confirming those reports. I decided to break it down geographically, listing the number of members, temples, and GDP per capita in each of the highest Mormonly-populated countries in the world (74 total).

[This is it sorted by total members](http://i.imgur.com/tx32C.jpg).  Meh, kind of interesting but nothing shocking.

[This is it sorted by number of temples](http://i.imgur.com/5JTSj.jpg).  Now we're getting somewhere!  

[So let's sort by total potential tithing](http://i.imgur.com/1ovIE.jpg).  This is calculated assuming 100% activity, everyone is a tithe payer, and the average income of Mormons is the same as the national average.

See some interesting things?  How about we change the Temples count to Temples + Announced/Under construction? [Here is that one](http://i.imgur.com/BPqvP.jpg).

Finally, let's go back to that first method of sorting, [total members, with the new Temple Total](http://i.imgur.com/gRX28.jpg).

So we see poor Nicaragua down there with 71,888 members (25th most) and no temple.  Congo?  27,058 members and no temple.  Starting to notice a trend?  The church is currently building or has announced 13 new temples in the US, including 4 in Utah.  I wonder why...

Denmark and Finland have fewer than 5,000 members, but each get a temple.  Switzerland, Sweden and the Netherlands are below 10,000 members each, but they each get temples.  Meanwhile, 12 countries with over 10,000 members don't have any temples.  Each of them has a far lower GDP per capita than Denmark, Finland, Switzerland, Sweden and the Netherlands.

If anyone is wondering why Belgium doesn't have a temple, it is a two hour drive to the Hague temple from Brussels.  Meanwhile, try going from Zimbabwe with its 18,549 members (more than 3 times as many as Belgium) to the nearest temple.

You have to hand it to the Mormons, they know how to get their money.

**tl;dr** Mormons don't build temples where members are. They build temples where they can get the most tithing out of members.

1294956516.0,118,self.exmormon,f1tx1,Telling my parents tonight. Wish me luck!,133,15,66,http://www.reddit.com/r/exmormon/comments/f1tx1/telling_my_parents_tonight_wish_me_luck/,"I'm a fourth generation pioneer descendant, the youngest of eleven kids, the tenth missionary, and eleventh temple married in my family.  I grew up in Salt Lake, go to the U of U, and live in the basement apartment of my parent's house with my faithful wife of three months.  I have recently been serving in a Stake calling helping at an assisted living center where my dad is in the Branch Presidency, and just a couple weeks ago was called to also be a Ward Missionary (kind of ironic at this point since we are supposed to visit people whose records are in the ward boundaries and invite them to church)

This has not been an easy thing for me to do to make the decision to leave.  Maybe that's not quite accurate.  The decision to leave was not hard, but going through with it is.  Let me back up a little.

All through growing up in the Church, I accepted that the Church was true and then based everything else around that.  I had never once thoughtfully considered the possibility that it might not be.  Sometimes things would come up that didn't really make sense to me, but I trusted that they were true anyway since it was what the Church taught.  Things like the flood, and how a person's skin would change based on their righteousness.  I never worried about it too much though because those were not part of the core beliefs - Jesus Christ/Atonement and Joseph Smith/Book of Mormon.  As long as those things were true nothing else really mattered.  Other things came up over time.  One thing that really bothered me was something I found on my own in the scriptures.  Moroni 7:45-46 was too similar to 1 Corinthians 13:4-8.  I could understand Old Testament scripture being in the BoM, but this was from Paul after the ministry of Christ.  It really bothered me, but I resorted to my usual tactic of putting it on a shelf and not worrying about it, because surely the important things were still true.  I did all the usual orthodox Mormon things and was never inactive for more than three weeks (which brought much guilt).  I always wanted the Church to be true and I honestly believed it a lot of the time.  It bothered me when people would get up and say that they *know* the Church is true, and I felt uncomfortable sharing my testimony because I couldn't truthfully say that, and what would people think if I said that I *believed* it to be true but didn't know.  I had a terrible time on my mission, from the beginning to the end I was relieved when people didn't answer their door and I wouldn't have to try to convince them of things I wasn't totally sure of myself.

So about a week ago I was casually browsing Reddit and I came across a post about the cloaked ship in Star Trek IV, the ""a little too much LDS"" quote came up, others started mocking the Church and I was feeling a little upset because I felt that was uncalled for.  I decided to see if there was a pro-LDS subreddit, so I typed it into the Reddit search and *this* was the top result.  I was curious about the exit stories and ended up reading every one of them.  Somewhere there was a link to mormonthink.com and that's when everything came apart for me really fast.  I read almost the entire site over the next three days (in secret with private browsing on).  I preferred reading it to playing Starcraft (I am reminded of the story of Parley P. Pratt about his discovering of the Book of Mormon).  It was the first time I had ever even considered that the Church might not be true, and all the concerns and doubts I had over the years made so much more sense if none of it was true to begin with.  I knew right then that there was no going back, I no longer believed it, and I had to get out of it just to be honest to myself.  I told my wife two nights ago and she took it better than expected.  After sitting down and saying I needed to talk and that I hadn't ever discussed this with anybody else, she thought I was going to say that I was gay, and was actually relieved when I told her.  She still believes, she has been praying a lot, and there have been tears from both of us.  I'm still trying to figure out where to go from here with our marriage, since the terms have changed a bit.  It's a hard thing to confront.  It's been hard to see her praying by herself and not with me kneeling beside her.  I think it was hard for her to see me getting undressed last night and not have on my garments.  I actually don't have any normal underwear and have been wearing pajama bottoms under my pants the last couple days.  It's not too bad!

My current situation of serving in a calling with my parents makes it a little difficult to avoid telling them what is going on.  They grew up hearing of all the hardships their great grandparents went through in crossing the plains and how faithful they were and one of my ancestors designed the roof of the tabernacle.  My mom is an avid Church history student, so I'm sure she is at least aware of some of the issues with the early Church.  In my mom's eyes, there is nothing worse than leaving the Church.  I don't want to break her heart.  I want to show her that I can still be a good person and raise good children not be a member.  I have no interest in the ""sinful/worldly"" things, I am leaving because I no longer believe that it is true and in fact believe that Joseph Smith was an expert con artist.  That's difficult for me to even type.  So I welcome words of encouragement as I get ready to make this declaration tonight.  If you have any advice on how to approach my bishop (who is someone that watched me grow up in the Church), that would be great too.  I'm also a little worried about what my family will think of me, but I have never felt like I was standing more for what I believe than I do right now.

EDIT:

I'm at work right now so I can't say too much, but it went about as well as could be expected.  I have decided to continue going to Sacrament meeting to support the wife.  I have some friends (husband and wife) in the ward that I suspect are in a similar situation.  My parents both said that they love me, but they are very sad.  Even got some hugs from my dad which is rare.  I'm not kicked out of the apartment, no worries there.

What was really interesting is that I found out that two of my brothers have already transitioned into atheism.  So even within my own family I am not alone.  I called and talked to each of them, one bore his testimony of atheism.  My brother who went first is afraid that he is going to take the blame for leading the rest of us astray.

1365456757.0,120,self.exmormon,1by0mg,Have you ever heard that kids in your generation would be there to see the savior? Ever wonder where the saying came from?,135,15,50,http://www.reddit.com/r/exmormon/comments/1by0mg/have_you_ever_heard_that_kids_in_your_generation/,"So in primary, as many of you were probably told as I was, that many in our generation wouldn't pass away before Christ came again.  As a young tyke, I proudly announced this to my parents at home.  

""I'm not so sure"", my father said, and kinda left it at that.  That left a question in my mind that I recently found the answer to.  

&gt;Who originally made the claim 

Well you probably all know about [D&amp;C 130:14-15](http://www.lds.org/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/130?lang=eng) given in Feb. 14, 1835 but recorded in the D&amp;C 1843 that if Joseph Smith lived to be 80 years old, (1890) he wouldn't taste death

But the story actually involves a man by the name of [William Miller](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Miller_(preacher)) whose views were the founding of the Seventh Day Adventist church, and prophesied the end of date of the world.

Joseph Smith believed that William Miller's predicted day of advent was set for April 3, 1843.  On, April 2, Joseph recorded that Christ would not come until December 23, 1890 which became D&amp;C 130.

Now, that prophesy has been discussed at length by Anti-mormons and pro-mormons with an absolutely brilliant bunch of bullshit like [this page](http://www.shields-research.org/General/LDS_Leaders/1stPres/Joseph_Smith/56_Year.htm) where it claims that everything was a third hand source and that Joseph never made the prophesy, and that it wasn't a failed prophesy and who can really know anything anyway.

Problem is, that Joseph was pretty prolific about the point, because he debunked Miller's prophesy.  Joseph's own diary for April 3rd reads ""[William] Miller's Day of Judgement has arrived, but tis too pleasent for false prophets.""

Later (April 5th) Joseph reiterated the ""eighty-five years old"" prophecy and promised that, ""There are those of the rising generation who shall not taste death till Christ comes. ...  I prophecy in the name of the Lord God, and let it be written, that the Son of Man will not come in the heavens till I am 85 years old, 48 years hence or about 1890."" in his own journal

http://www.boap.org/LDS/Parallel/1843/6Apr43(2).html

This is not 3rd hand.  This is not the poorly edited Church history or bad scribes.  This is Joseph, in his own journal, stating clearly that the world would end in 1890, and many of the church members would see it.  

Further, the church held on to polygamy until... 1890.  That's right.  you see, all the people closest to Joseph thought they just had to make it to that year, and Christ would come and the government would be thrown down.  They really believed the last days were in THAT GENERATION, with many many quotes to back this claim up.  So when 1890 arrived and Christ did not, the poor church was dumb founded how to continue.

This explains church debt (Suckers, the world is gonna end soon, take out another loan), the running to Deseret and building up until 1890, etc. etc.  The world view that 1890 was the final year is so similar to so many other religions/cults that declare an end date and then have to continue after it arrives and the world continues turning that for ""anti-mormons"" to declare Joseph wrong is in no way more or less wrong that the ""anti-miller"" Joseph Smith boasting that Miller was wrong the day after.

So who said that ""People of this generation"" would see the savior?  That's right, Joseph Smith Jr. himself, and that was referring to the 1890 end of the world.  Anyone who says that in primary or otherwise is quoting a failed prophesy that apologists are still lying to members about, because it's pretty cut and dry that Joseph was directly wrong on what God told him.  And it continues to be wrong for every generation it is told to.",,False,self,t5_2r0gj,False,,,True,t3_1by0mg,http://www.reddit.com/r/exmormon/comments/1by0mg/have_you_ever_heard_that_kids_in_your_generation/,

1371753117.0,111,self.exmormon,1gqr93,The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints is not following the Plan of Salvation that Jehovah presented to Elohim,132,21,52,http://www.reddit.com/r/exmormon/comments/1gqr93/the_church_of_jesus_christ_of_latterday_saints_is/,"I'm going to give you the key point to keep in mind the whole time:

- All men must be tempted by Satan

-----

Let's explain the Plan of Salvation as it is currently taught

- Jesus comes to Earth, creates his church, teaches the Gospel, establishes the priesthood, and appoints leaders

- Jesus suffers for the sins of mankind, dies on the cross, resurrects

- Jesus leaves the management of his church to his appointed leaders

- The Great Apostasy

- The Restoration

- Second coming

- Start of Millennium

- Satan is bound

- Lime Jell-O with carrots

- End of Millennium

- Satan is unbound so that all mankind can be tempted

- Final Battle

-----

Hold the phone. SATAN is part of the plan. It is NECESSARY for Satan to tempt every person.

Without being tempted by Satan, the Plan fails.

Here is where we run into a MAJOR contradiction.

We have to find it back in the Pre-Mortal Existence.

-----

Pre-Mortal Existence:

- God and Wife/Wives are celestial beings

- We are all spirit children

- God solicits his spirit children for a plan to become Gods like him

- Jehovah [Jesus] presents a plan

- Lucifer [Satan] presents a plan

- Jehovah's plan is chosen

- Lucifer revolts

- Lucifer and his followers are cast out of heaven and become Satan and his devils.

-----

Did you catch it?

Jehovah presented a plan, and as we look at the prophecies, that plan ended up involving Satan, the Devil himself, to tempt all of us. It is a requirement before we can be judged and go to heaven.

When Jehovah presented his plan, did it entail that his little brother would be the Devil, sent to tempt the rest of us? If so, then he's a fucking asshole, and so is his dad for going along with it, as well as the other 2/3 of the host of heaven.

If that wasn't part of Jehovah's plan, then there is no plan, and God has been winging it since Day 1. This actually explains a lot, with God drowning the whole world because they didn't do what he wanted them to do.

-----

Case in point, the current plan requires that Satan tempts all men. The plan was laid before we came to the world, and we all accepted it. This means that God knew ahead of time that Lucifer was going to be the devil. God had every intention of creating the devil. This means that the War in Heaven (see flair) was just an artificial conflict created by God. That means God is a prick. And if that wasn't the plan that Jehovah presented, then what the fuck is the plan?

On Monday my Dad invited a new member of the ward to come eat dinner with us and the Elders.
Let's call the new member Jim. Jim just moved here from Nigeria. He is in his late 20's, a high priest, and a return missionary. He served in Nigeria.

Jim had already set my creepy radar off. He was overly friendly. I chalked it up to culture though. When we picked him up on Monday, Jim was SUITED UP. Like damn, why are you dressed up? It's crockpot Monday. He reaked of weird cologne. 
We got home and my dad went outside to feed the horses and take care of a few things while I set the table and Jim sat in our living room.
Jim was chatty. He kept asking me questions about my life and also my friend who was going on a mission. Then the following conversation ensued:

Jim: Are you going on a mission?
Me: Haha, no.
Jim: Well why not?
Me: It's not for me.
Jim: Have you prayed about it?
Me: No. 
Jim: That should've been first. It's God's decision really.

I'd been avoiding the inevitable ""I'm not a member"" conversation. Most, if not all, members of the ward I attend are aware of my status. They respect it. They answer questions when I have them, and they go on with life. Mutual respect. (Probably why I don't have a disdain for the church.)

Me: I'm not a member
Jim: You're kidding.
Me: Haha, nope.
Jim: You don't joke about things like that.
Me: I'm not kidding.
Jim: Stop that. I don't believe you.
Me: You don't have to.
Jim: Why are you not a member?
Me: I don't want to talk about it.
Jim: Why not?
Me: It's personal.
Jim: That's selfish.
Me: That's fine.
Jim: Share with me!
Me: No.
Jim: I'll wait.
Me: Go ahead. I don't feel comfortable talking about it.
Jim: Please?
Me: Please stop.

By now, I'd lost my courteous smile. I didn't want to tell him, because I wanted to have a nice dinner. It is possible to have nice dinners with TBMs, as long as they are respectful. Which most of the time they are. Probably because all of the tricks had been pulled on me. Now they just have to ""Sit and wait"".

Jim: How come you did not join as a child?
Me: My mom raised me to hate the church. I discovered her hateful ways. I moved in with my dad. I attended the church. By then I was old enough to make my own decisions. 

I chose to ""Explore it"". I didn't want to crush my dad's heart. He didn't bother me about it, as long as I tried. I did. He stopped bothering me. It's mutual respect. He doesn't know I've almost completely denounced Christianity. He doesn't need to.

Jim: Well have you prayed about it?
Me: (Fuck you.) Jim, I have earned my young women's medallion. I've been a YCL for mutliple girl's camps. I've had a ""calling"" in the church. I clean the church building once a month when I'm back home to visit. I've read all of the Book of Mormon. It's not for me. I don't want to talk about it. I feel uncomfortable. (Obviously a unviersal, stop talking about this subject!)
Jim: I'm glkad you've read the Book of Mormon. Here's my testimony.

The next 15 minutes I'm stuck politely nodding my head at this asshole's testimony. I've heard the same recycled crap. I just want him to stop. Finally my dad comes in.

Jim: Have you ever been moved emotionally by something?
Me: Yes.
Jim: In sacarament?
Me: Yes.
Jim: Do you believe that is the spirit?
Me: I don't want to talk about this topic.
Jim: You are scared of the Spirit.
**Dad:** (Puts hand on my shoulder) C_Eberhard has done very good things. I'm very proud of her. (I walk off.) She has earned her young women's medallion. She has served in the church unofficially. She is doing well in college. She serves multiple communities. She does it with a smile. She's had a hard beginning. She's not scared. She's strong. (Yay daddy!)

Jim finally stopped let up. (After I relentlessly tried to get him to stop.) The Elders showed up. We had dinner. Jim talked THE ENTIRE TIME! All about his mission. A mission he had 5 years ago. I swear he told us every detail. And when it came to a conversion story, he narrowed his eyes on me. As if to say, I'm not doing it right. (Fuck you, Jim.) Even the Elders looked annoyed. It was P-day. When they come over for dinner usually, my family doesn't talk abotu the church until the ending lesson. My dad, never one to make someone too unhappy, nodded and seemed interested the entire time, but he was annoyed.

I left the dinner table when we were done to go outside with the dogs. I came back in to make ICe Cream for the Elders, my dad, and Jim. Jim was STILL talking about his mission. (When I asked later, the Elders told me they couldn't get a word in edge-wise). Jim talked until he checked his watch and asked to be brought home. Before he left he wanted a hug from me. I leaned into him. My dad told me to give him a real hug. I immediately showered.

Fuck Jim. Respect my choices and religion, and I'll respect yours. Push yours on me, and one of these days I will chew your head off.

1367986186.0,114,self.exmormon,1dwuxi,"An open letter to Mormons who want to intervene with someone who has ""lost their testimony""",129,15,28,http://www.reddit.com/r/exmormon/comments/1dwuxi/an_open_letter_to_mormons_who_want_to_intervene/,"Dear Mormon,

You have a friend, loved one, or family member who no longer believes in the Mormon Church. You feel greatly concerned for the welfare of their soul. If they are family or a close friend, you may feel guilt that had you been a better parent, friend, etc. that they would not have gotten to this point. You think that if you can save just their one soul, how great will be your eternal joy with them. You feel compelled and maybe even prompted to reach out in love in attempt to rescue them.

To you I write this open letter. Please review this before proceeding.

First: Don’t do it.

A) You don’t have anything to say that they have not already heard. At a young age every Mormon has learned that those who lose their testimony do so because they were offended, sinned, or too lazy to nourish it. They have been taught that those who stop believing are the “elect” who have been deceived and are in the power of Satan. They have been taught outside of a Mormon life lies eventual sadness, loneliness, failure, and loss of purpose. They have been exhorted countless times to read the scriptures, especially the Book of Mormon and to sincerely pray to receive a testimony of the truth. They know that doctrine states that apostatizing from the church has serious eternal consequences – possibly even Outer Darkness.

B) Every person who has decided they do not believe has already seriously considered all of the points listed above. They have thought about them and through them many times. The Mormon teachings and culture ensure that all members are very aware of these. They did not come to their decision lightly.

C) You are very, very unlikely to say anything that will change their mind. However, you are very likely to say and do things that will permanently damage your relationship. You are also very likely to hurt them deeply. Such a person is already in a challenging state of transition where they are receiving significant disapproval; adding to that will only cause harm.

D) The 11th Article of Faith states: “…and we allow all men the same privilege, let them worship how, where, or what they may.” This would be an excellent time to heed this scripture.

E) You are probably aware that the Mormon Church has a reputation among some of being a cult. One of the major characteristics of a cult is the intense pressure they place on defectors. Don’t contribute to this reputation by behaving in a manner consistent with cults.

F) Remember the saying: “Fools step in where angels fear to tread.”

OK you aren’t willing to listen to this advice to not do it, so let’s move on. You’ve made the decision to intervene – to write a letter, have a conversation, etc.

Remember the Golden Rule: “Do unto others as you would have others do unto you.”

Let’s take a scenario that will aid us in following the Golden Rule. Imagine you have grown up Baptist and have decided that you believe in Mormonism instead.

You know that the Baptist variation you believed teaches that Mormons are going to Hell because they accept the wrong concept of Jesus. You did not make this decision lightly – it was a difficult painstaking decision that took much soul searching. However, ultimately you determined that you believe in Mormonism instead. You are in the process of making these beliefs known.

You receive the following letter:

Dear You:

I love you very much and write this in the spirit of love. I was very concerned to hear that you are leaving the Baptist faith and joining the Mormon Church. I am very worried about you and you are in the grasp of Satan – I exhort you to repent of your backsliding and return to the true Christ. The path you are on will only lead to sadness and emptiness in your life. Please read the true Bible which holds the truth of the gospel and return to the light. I feel the needs to warn you of this - you are rejecting Jesus and will burn eternally in Hell. I have taught you the way to happiness and the truth your whole life, you have had many experiences in this, and now you are rejecting it. This makes me so sad for you – please return to the truth. I love you so much.

Love,

Loved one.

Now let’s take a look at how you would react to this letter.

Likely:

A) You would feel very disrespected and hurt. Despite the words “love” being used many times, the last thing you feel is loved and respected.

B) This would do nothing to make you desire to return to the Baptist church. Since you no longer believe it is true, the threats are empty and they only serve to make you feel judged and hurt – that the letter writer has a condescending attitude because their beliefs are correct and yours have no validity.

Instead consider:

Dear You:

I understand that you are leaving the Baptist faith and joining the Mormon Church. I want you to know that even though we now have different beliefs it changes nothing in that I still love and accept you. I promise to continue to treat you the same and to not let this new difference come between us – you and our relationship is what is most important to me.

I recognize that this must have been a very difficult decision and you would not have taken it lightly. In fact, I think so highly of you I really want to understand why you made this decision despite the difficulties it will bring – not to convince you that you are wrong, but just to understand why. I expect we will disagree, but I am happy to listen to and understand your viewpoint. I recognize that this is probably a difficult time of transition for you and many are probably questioning everything about you. I just want you to know that even though I may disagree with your new beliefs, I am here to support and love you.

Love,
Loved one.

Now how would you react to this letter?

So if you are going to intervene, please follow the Golden Rule.

Don’t:
- Preach – they already know.
- Say directly or indirectly that they are in Satan’s grasp.
- Make accusations of sinfulness, laziness, knowing better, etc.
- Take the black and white approach that your beliefs are right and theirs are wrong - that you have the moral high ground and they have the moral low ground.
- Imply that their beliefs lead only to sadness, despair, and hell.
- Exhort them to read the Book of Mormon and pray about it.
- Attack their new belief system.

Do:
- Allow them agency to choose their beliefs. Do not consider them a project, just treat them like a person.
- Put your relationship with them and your acceptance of them as a person above your difference in belief. Provide support in a challenging time of transition for them.
- Recognize that they did not make this decision lightly. They already know that they are doomed if they are wrong. They are so convinced that is not the case that they are moving forward with it.
- Recognize that they have already heard and experienced the same things you have as a Mormon. Respect that they have reasons that are valid to them that overshadow those experiences.
- If you a brave enough, find out why they are so sure of their new beliefs that they are willing to risk heaven in the next life and the many social and familial challenges that this creates in this life.

Wanting to Leave the Church...Not Sure How.,129,16,70,http://www.reddit.com/r/exmormon/comments/1cf4yt/currently_serving_a_mission_wanting_to_leave_the/,"I'm a 21 year old missionary for the LDS Church. I am currently serving a mission in the mid-west. Where-abouts I can't really be specific because several of my companions peruse reddit as well. However I can give you a little background.

My intention with this post is to receive some serious advice on where to go from here.

I was born and raised in the church but was less active between the age of 17-20. At this time I lived away from home, had a stable job and was perfectly happy with my religious persuasion. Of course at this time I also had an increasingly bad problem with alcohol and ended up turning back towards the church for help. For the myriad of reasons that I did so, I had a hard time separating what I thought was the benefit of the ""spirit"" and my increased well-being by getting sober.

In essence I honestly thought that my life shaping up while giving up booze/drugs was directly linked with my faithfulness to the LDS church. Add to this all of the wonderful guilt tactics of the church and years of indoctrination and you get one messed up situation.

Anyways I continued to stay faithful. Blundered through my Temple day. Surprise surprise as I progressed more through the church I actually relapsed and was extremely hungover that day. Hmmm wonder why the ""spirit"" didn't tell the temple workers that. Oh well.

As I went down that slippery slope of re-activity I did end up turning back to old vices to deal with the depression and my own self-loathing for pretending to believe in something I didn't. The hypocrisy didn't stop there though and I ended up putting my papers in and beginning my mission last year. Culturally it was the thing to do. And I heard so much about how your mission really defines a person. So I carried on.

While on my mission you learn even more about the church. Especially when you throw yourself at it day in day out and for a few months I was pretty happy. And then I started to question doctrines and church history and got into some pretty heated arguments with other missionaries. I then used my handy local library to do some more in-depth research and have come to my own conclusions that I don't want to be apart of this broken institution and it's deceit and lies. It's killing me to represent this church day in day out and not having an outlet to speak about my actual beliefs. 

That brings me to you guys. To get your opinion on what I should do. I don't want to sever ties with my Family. They've been through this process before and killed them emotionally, but why should I trade my happiness for theirs?

The biggest problem I have is losing so many of my friends. I gave up a lot of my dead beat alcoholic friends and traded them for the Mormon Community. Now I'm tasked with starting over again. Thankfully hindsight is 20/20 and I will be finding better people to place my friendship in. 

Basically I need help on what to do from here. Where can I go till I am financially stable? How do I approach my family the 2nd time to tell them I'm leaving the church for good? How do I get out of this mission? 

-EDIT-

I'll be back tomorrow to respond to posts library here closes in 10 minutes.

-EDIT2-
Thank you for the support everyone. I about died when I saw how many people were volunteering to let me stay at their place. So I have a plan of action now. I'll be contacting the President soon with my intentions and returning home to continue my education.  All in all it has been a nerve racking experience. I hardly slept last night but I agree with the comments here. I think I'm letting my fear get the best of me. 

As far as substance abuse problems go I am definitely seeking out help to tackle those problems. I haven't had them the entire time on my mission due to lack of access and I am going to overcome them when I get home even with access.

Again thank you so much for all of your support. It's very amazing to know that there is support systems outside of the church. Something that sounds inherent I know but hard to realize when you never knew anything else growing up.

Boyd K. gives plenty of advice on those fronts.

I am, however, going to talk a bit about what to expect out of life and some of the things that have helped me.  It may be a bit rambling and perhaps even naive from the perspective of the 60 year+ crowd.  But it's what I've got to offer.

**It feels like you will never leave school**

Whether you're 12 or 20, school seems to never end.  The homework is repressive, the social climate is toxic.  Every day is difficult to muster through.  Here are some helps for this aspect

1) Learn to do your homework first, and play after. 

I know this sucks, and it means sacrificing play, but bar none, this was the most useful thing I learned in school.  Get the job done, then play, helped me survive college, and land that first Salary job.  It let's me take care of kids and a family.  

If you can't manage this, I recommend a career in marketing/Sales.  No, seriously.  Learning to play first, and then do the work seems key to these people.  They take clients out on huge expense accounts as work.  It's not bad if you can get it.

2) If you don't fit in, it's because you aren't a factory worker.

School is built around the idea that children need to work in factories.  I'm serious.  The original public school system was built around the concept of industrialization.  So if you're naturally an artist, a dancer, a bio-chemist, etc. odds are you're going to struggle in the public system.   

3) Survive.

Do it, do it as well as you can, and then get out.  Don't let anything in this part of your life destroy the rest of your life.  Seriously, I know there are down days.  They'd happen even if your life was perfect, just due to hormones.  Get to the 21 range, and learn how much more there is to life.

I'd highly recommend taking enough of a martial art that you can defend yourself from jerks.  Most will leave you alone after you don't back down once.  Word spreads quickly and you may have to have a fight.

I know, your mormon upbringing tells you to never fight, but dude, Joseph fought.  Brigham took on the whole USA.  The current church is run by sniveling cowards who won't stand up to challenges when people depend on them.  Try to steer confrontation to where it will hurt you least.

When I was in Jr. High, I had a good friend who was challenged to a fight.  He was built like an Ox.  He refused to fight then and there, but selected the graveyard near the school.   He landed a punch or two and the other kid went down.  No expulsion.  No repercussion, and he was never challenged again.

4) Get a support group.  If you don't have one, make one.  Realize that everyone going through that time is struggling and wondering if anyone likes them.  Tell a few people you like them, and see what happens.  Tell them you think they are ""Worthwhile individuals"" and they add value to the world, and man, you'll have a group of people who will help when you need it in no time.

**Sex**

I'm not going to dwell on this, but I'm going to focus on one thought.

DON'T FUCK FUTURE YOU UP.

That's it.  Pregnancy and STD's can really screw up this area for future you.  Be careful, be safe, and don't screw up your future.

**Lifecycle**

There is a tradition in the Hopi Indian tribe that discusses the 4 stages of life as ""Mouse"", ""Bear"", ""Bison"", ""eagle"".  I'm going to use this analogy because I think it works well.

1) Mouse- The mouse must be cared for.  It is the infant/small child who is dependent on others for survival.  You've just emerged from this stage of life, and you are going to want your own dependence.  You need to explore you, free from parent's claims of truth and knowledge.  THIS is why they don't take you seriously when you say you don't believe the church.  This is why they think it is a phase.  

This rebellion is a natural process and part of the cycle.  And to have any credibility that it's not just rebellion you need to act more mature than your years.  You have to leave ""Mouse"" and that is why we say ""Get a job, hang on, and get your own place when you turn 18"".

2) Bear- To the bear, everything is sex and death.  Who do I fuck, how often can I fuck, and if I can't fuck, I die.  Kill or be killed.  It's the rage of the hormones and the drive.

The thing is, our culture idolizes the bear.  James Bond is the sleek bear.  Most movies involve bear lifestyles.  Sex, death, fight, kill, sexy dresses, sexy parties, live like we're gonna die young.  

But really this is a very limited time in your lives.  Do enjoy it.  Create memories that will last when you look back.  But don't dwell on it for the rest of your lives.

Do realize that between classes and homework, you'll have far more free time than when you have children, so you've got a lot you can do for yourselves and your memories, even though it doesn't feel like it.

3) Bison-  The bison's job is to provide for everyone around him.  This stage is coming whether you like it or not.  Provide for the children.  Provide for aging parents.  Spend your time on internet forums providing for the needs of others.  Provide for the kid down the street who's parent is not providing.

You'll WANT to do this.  To provide for everyone.  It's in our nature.  So don't burn out your life in Mouse and bear stages.  Get to where you can provide, and you'll be a more satisfied person.

Once you reach a stage where you are providing for people adequately, you'll start thinking about a way to leave a legacy.

The office politics will get boring, and you'll want to do something for society.  This is natural.  This is part of the cycle.  Start thinking now what kind of contribution you want to make to this world.  This is why Bill Gates moved from companies to charity work.  This is why others build statues of themselves or donate to build libraries.  

You start to realize you are going to be gone, and you want to make a contribution before you go.

4) Eagle- The eagle is the one with vision far beyond the others.  He/She has experienced life and wants to share.  Kinda like making endless talks ""To the youth of the church"".  You want to impart that wisdom.  War stories.  Unsolicited advice.  You want to smooth the road for those who are still traveling down it.

5) Back to Mouse- Bad teeth, bad back, aches, pains, wrinkles, dementia.  We all head towards this on our road and you need to admit it.  One day, if you live long enough, you will be dependent on people around you to take care of you.  Build up friendships and relationships so that you can receive this care.

**broad terms**

This is a broad brush to paint with, and I'm sure someone will say something-or-other doesn't apply to them.  And that's fair.  This is a fairly basic guide to offer some encouragement, some hope, and some foresight.

We too, had days were we felt like our lives were over, or it might be worth it to end it all.  We too had days where we could only think of sex.  We too, had times where school stretched on forever.  And I want you to know that there's lots lots more to life.  It gets deeper and broader than anything you can imagine right now and it's worth getting to taste it all.

I lied about my pornography and masturbation problems for years until I was able to go on a mission. I did not want people to know about my problems because I thought I could fix it myself and I would've been extremely embarrassed if I did not go on a mission when I turned 19. This lying caused me great pain and I thought I was a terrible person. I thought I was just going to make it to the Telestial kingdom or if I was lucky I could go to the Terrestrial kingdom. 

On my mission I went without masturbating for about 9 months. That was my longest streak but I just couldn't help myself and I had to do it. Of course I felt really guilty for doing it and I did not want to do it again. I ended up doing it every couple of months after that and I couldn't stop. I couldn't tell my mission president because I didn't want to be sent home. So I was in the deep dark despair of a mission all by my sinning self.

I was dreading to go home in a way because I did not know if I would be strong enough to resist porn on the internet. Well I didn't go to the computer right away when I got home but I eventually went on when my family was out of the house. I did this for years while I was at school. Eventually, I got my own place with roommates and I did the same thing when they weren't home. Every time after I looked at porn and masturbated I had heavy heavy guilt. There were times when I would plead with God to help me with my porn problem. I was always taught that there are tests in this life that we can all handle. But how come I couldn't handle this?

Eventually, I had to meet with the bishop because I went a little to far with a girl I was dating. I didn't have sex with her but we did do stuff that was against the Mormon rules. I decided I would tell him about my porn problem as well. What shocked me is that he wasn't shocked about it at all but he wanted me to stop. He said for me to make a calendar and cross off all the days you don't look at porn. If you do it again try to beat the previous record you had. Well I did try that for a while but I ended up quitting that because it wasn't working and I was just getting discouraged. I would try to fill in my time with school, church, working out, dates, and other things. I would try not to be home by myself so I wouldn't be tempted. I pretty much did everything that was suggested except I could not stop!

Then I found out that the church was full of lies and it was complete b***s***. After 3 years being out of the Mormon church I barely look at porn. I don’t think about it near as often. It’s not some evil thing that should not partake of. In a way porn has lost it’s edge because I don’t look at it as sinning anymore. It’s kind of to bad because porn was way better as a Mormon and it was a lot more exciting as a Mormon. Porn use to be something I thought about often and it would be my go to thing if I got stressed. Now I barely think of it and I have other ways to cope with stress.

f*** the Mormon church for making me feel like I was so evil and for making me feel I had an addiction problem for 14 years of my life. f*** them for interrogating me about it for 14 years. f*** them for making me think I would not make it to the top level of heaven.

My companion and I went to visit a local member who's non-member son had been visiting for a couple weeks. The son had left suddenly on business and due to the sudden nature of his business he had left a case of 24 long neck Corona beers in his father's (an active member) fridge.

The member told us his trash man wouldn't take the un-opened beer and asked us if we could take it and throw it in the dumpster at our apartment complex. My companion and I looked at one another, each with a cautious gaze of what would happen if Mormon missionaries were caught with 24 bottles of beer sometime between taking possession of it and dumping it. We eventually decided to not be assholes and we took the beer from the member with the intent to trash it at our apartment. He was a cool guy, we had actually made a couple of knives with his help in his workshop so we wanted to do him the favor.

We drove home in silence. Each of us uncomfortable with the thought of 24 bottles of liquid sin hiding in the trunk of our well known missionary car in a small town. Eventually we got home and pulled into our parking lot, then parked next to our smelly dumpster. 

As I put the car in park the thought came to me that just because I don't drink beer didn't mean the beer necessarily had to be thrown away. Did it? I thought maybe it would be a beneficial thing to find someone that would actually appreciate the beer. It was 24 bottles after all, surely a good gift to the right person... right?

I ran the idea by my companion who's greenie (new missionary) face suddenly dropped into an uncomfortable frown. He was from Utah, the heart of the cultural beast called Mormonism, and didn't like this crazy idea his trainer from Las Vegas (a fully apostatized and morally bankrupt city) was having about giving beer away in broad daylight in missionary pross (clothing/dress) no less. I finally managed to explain to him that as long as they didn't think it was a sin then it was ok for others to drink beer and therefore we shouldn't waste this finite resource by unceremoniously throwing it into a lonely trash bin. I guess I should have realized at that point that this forward thinking, economic focused, libertarian wasn't too long for the Mormon church ehh?

Well, we opened the trunk and covered the case of beer with one of our suit coats and carried it into the apartment complex and toward our apartment. I knocked on our neighbor's door, just across the hallway from us. We were pretty sure a couple of female roommates lived there and we were also pretty sure they knew two Mormon missionaries lived just across the hall from them. 

One of the roommates answered the door. When she saw the two missionaries from across the hall standing in front of her door, one with an uncomfortable smile, the other sweating beads of stress, she immediately assumed we were there to convert her. Her face went from smile to stern as I began to speak.

Me: ""Hi, I'm Elder ________ and this is Elder ________. We live just across the hall from you and are missionaries for the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints.""

Her: (Just nods slowly, like this is a situation she knew might happen but she still didn't approve)

Me: ""Do you drink beer?""

Her: (Surprised I have the balls to immediately begin attacking her life in such a direct manner and thinking that maybe I was deserving of a tongue lashing)

""Yes, I drink beer. I think there is nothing wrong with drinking beer. It is something grown ups can choose to do with their grown up lives.""

Me: ""Great!"" 

Her: (confused look on face)

Me: ""Well, we don't drink beer but we do have 24 bottles here we would like to give you"" 

(I pull back the suit coat to display the case of beer, bottles slightly rattling against each other due to my greenie companion's shaking in fear at the thought of providing free beer to people on his mission, while holding the case in front of him.

Her: ""You want to give me this beer?""

Me: ""Yep!"" (I then explained the situation and how it was better that someone that drank got to do what they liked doing then someone that didn't want to drink stopping them from doing so. It is a free country after, right?)

Well, she happily took the beer and from that day on she was really friendly to both of us. All the roommates in that apartment were nice to both of us from that point forward but my companion was always uncomfortable with the clear friendliness.

I still chuckle to myself sometimes at the thought that maybe sometime in the future one of those roommates are going to be talking to missionaries again and when the missionaries tell about the Word of Wisdom (Mormon rule against drinking beer) they are going to have quite a story to tell).",,False,self,t5_2r0gj,False,,,True,t3_13gs80,http://www.reddit.com/r/exmormon/comments/13gs80/two_missionaries_and_a_24_bottle_case_of_corona/,

of one's net worth, after deducting debts.  This was voluntary and not forced, to quote ""Believing that voluntary tithing is better than Forced taxes"" - [source](https://www.sunstonemagazine.com/pdf/102-17-29.pdf)

* **1838** - D&amp;C 119 redefines tithing as all surplus property and then 1/10th of interest annually.

* **1844** - Official proclaimation for all saints to immediately pay a one time tithe of 1/10th of their property and money to the church.  Exemptions are not made for those who paid at conversion. - [source](http://lds-church-history.blogspot.com/2010/12/lds-history-summary.html)

* **1845** - The church emphasizes the need to pay 1/10th of all possessions when entering the ""new and everlasting covenant"". - [source](http://lds-church-history.blogspot.com/2010/12/lds-history-summary.html)

* **1846** - Apostle John Page, exempt from the rule as he was an apostle, left the church over what he felt was an unjust and mandatory tax.  He further stated that many paid at the cost of necessities for life. - [source](http://lds-church-history.blogspot.com/2010/12/lds-history-summary.html)

* **1851** - Brigham instigated a vote that would allow excommunication for members not paying tithing or following the word of wisdom. [source](http://lds-church-history.blogspot.com/2010/12/lds-history-summary.html).  This penalty was inconsistent and not often applied. 

* **1873** - Orson hide describes tithing as 1/10th all of your property at the start and 1/10th of your annual income thereafter.  This *appears* to be the first known instance of tithing being called 10% of your income.  - see edit2 for sources

* **1873**, Multiple statements declaring tithing as 1/10th of your income that should ""be gladly paid"", occasionally refereed to as a ""tax from the Lord"".  Orson Pratt, Brigham young, see edit 2 for sources.

* **1874** Tithing is an inferior law compared to the Law of consecration.  - [Orson Pratt] - see edit2 for sources

* **1878** Even a widow who receives her full support from the church must pay tithing on those funds [L.W. Hardy - May 15, 1878] - Note: the apostles were exempt from the law of tithing. 

* **1879** Lorenzo Snow agrees with Hardy, explaining the situation is a product of the lesser law (tithing).  Had the people been following the celestial law (consecration) it would not be a hardship for the widow.  - [Lorenzo Snow]- see edit2 for sources

* **1892** Joseph F Smith implies tithing comes before necessities and implicitly suggests that 9 dollars will go further than 10 when tithing is paid.  - see edit2 for the actual quote and sources

* **1896** - Salaries stopped for everyone but the 12 due to financial troubles. 

* **1898** - the LDS church is now $2.3 million (1800's $) in debt.  - [source](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finances_of_The_Church_of_Jesus_Christ_of_Latter-day_Saints#History)

* **1899** - Lorenzo's snow stated that everyone must pay tithing prompting a dramatic increase in tithe payers.  This was about the same time he issued a total of $1 million in short term bonds.  - [source](http://www.lds.org/ldsorg/v/index.jsp?hideNav=1&amp;locale=0&amp;sourceId=023ba41f6cc20110VgnVCM100000176f620a____&amp;vgnextoid=637e1b08f338c010VgnVCM1000004d82620aRCRD).  The manuals show this as [a turning point](http://www.lds.org/general-conference/1994/04/tithing?lang=eng) for the emphasis on tithing and it's connection with full membership.  - Also note the subtle retcon in the current manuals.  This is known as Lorenzo Snow's declaration on paying 10% of your income; yet, income, interest, or 10% are not used in the original quote.  Instead, he simply says that each man is [""to do the will of the Lord and to pay his tithing in full.""](http://truthmarche.wordpress.com/).  10% of ""income"" had not been used prior to this time.

* **1899** - Joseph F Smith says tithing is a personal choice.  Pay more to be blessed more. - (Conference Report, April 1899, pp. 68-69.) -Joseph F Smith, president as of this year.  

* **1900**, Lorenzo snow commissioned a list of non-tithe payers in all stakes. ""Snow told the apostles that non-payment of tithing 'was worse than the non-observance of the Word of Wisdom'"" [source](http://lds-church-history.blogspot.com/2010/12/lds-history-summary.html).  

* **1907**, the church is now free from debt. 

* **1908**, Tithing can no longer be paid in livestock, property, labor, or produce - [source](https://www.sunstonemagazine.com/pdf/102-17-29.pdf)

* **1910**, Tithing is now required for a temple recommend. 

* **1914**, the church releases it's first official report on how tithing is being used. [source](https://www.sunstonemagazine.com/pdf/102-17-29.pdf)

* **1940's**, you start seeing the words ""income"", ""increase"", and ""interest"" used interchangeably in publications from leaders and conference talks.  - See John A. Widtsoe, Evidences and Reconciliations, pg.285-286

* In **1944** you see comments on paying the lord first.  This is specifically meant to curb the practice of   deducting taxes and living expenses (farmers are still allowed to deduct their operating expenses) - LeGrand Richards, Conference Report, April 1944, p.45.   

* **1953**, Income made it back into general conference talks - see Joseph L. Wirthlin, Conference Report, April 1953, p.97

* **1957** - The LDS church has a $7 million surplus from tithing funds. - despite this, the LDS church manages to go $8 million dollars into debt over the next year and a half due. [source](https://www.sunstonemagazine.com/pdf/102-17-29.pdf)

* **1959** - The LDS church stops publishing its financial reports. [source](https://www.sunstonemagazine.com/pdf/102-17-29.pdf)

* **1962** - ""The Church was deficit-spending $32 million annually. New York financiers had to advise against the First Presidency's proposal ""to finance such spending by selling Church securities for the next fifty years.  The new year looked no better. By the end of February, there was already a $5 million shortfall, and 1963 threatened to equal or exceed the spending deficit of 1962."" - [source](http://lds-church-history.blogspot.com/2010/12/lds-history-summary.html).  

* **1963** version of the general handbook of instructions, tithing was clearly stated as gross income.  There is no reference to interest or increase - also quoted in The Messenger, September 1963, No. 87 

* concurrently in **1963**, Tanner revamped the financial structure of the church and ""step by step the Church was introduced to corporate financing."" [source](https://www.sunstonemagazine.com/pdf/102-17-29.pdf)

* Another book, The Principle and Practice of Paying Tithing, published in **1965** states that tithing is Gross, and not net.   Notice the trend away from increase entirely and the full acceptance of income.  

* In **1969** you see another conference talk on gross income, Bishop Victor L. Brown, Conference Report, 4 April 1969, p. 34

* In **1970**, Joseph Fielding smith and the rest of the first presidency sent out a letter formalizing that interest is defined as income, and no one can say anything different.  This went to bishops, stake presidents, and mission presidents. - [source - 19 March 1970](http://emp.byui.edu/marrottr/TithingPayOnWhat.htm)

* **Post 1970** quotes can be found by searching on LDS.org for tithing, income, increase, or tithe.

* **1996** - Estimates place the LDS church's annual revenue at ~$5 billion with total assets between $25-$30 billion.  [time magazine](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finances_of_The_Church_of_Jesus_Christ_of_Latter-day_Saints#Assets)

* **2012** - The LDS church completed a [$5 billion](http://www.ksl.com/?nid=148&amp;sid=19428181&amp;title=a-look-inside-as-city-creek-centers-completion-nears&amp;s_cid=featured-1) renovation in downtown Salt Lake.  The LDS owned mall purportedly came in at [$1.5 billion](http://www.deseretnews.com/article/705398244/15B-City-Creek-Center-on-schedule-for-March-22-opening.html), [3x the original estimate](http://www.sltrib.com/utah/ci_2777341).  It's unclear how much of the renovation came from the church itself.  After completion, the bishopric who supervised the project was released and tithing slips were changed to state, ""Though reasonable efforts will be made globally to use donations as designated, all donations become the Church’s property and will be used at the Church’s sole discretion to further the Church’s overall mission."" - [comparison, old version on the left](http://disreport.net/2012/06/04/lds-church-changes-important-wording-on-new-tithing-slips/)

* **Today**, all fast offerings and tithing donations are sent directly to salt lake and *distributed as the church sees fit*.  - 2010 General Handbook of Instructions. Income, interest, and increase are often used interchangeably. 

**Conclusion**: Tithing changed through the years to pay for emergency financial needs; however, the corporatization of the LDS finances proved to be more valuable in the overall financial stability of the organization.  The LDS church also shows a clear pattern of controlling information to hide their debts and (in modern times) their massive revenue.    Financials are only released when the church isn't doing too poorly or too well.

**Note**: this is not my original research.  It's a compilation of the great work of others.  Also note that there have been subtle retcons, interest became income in direct quotes.  [Blatant example](https://www.sunstonemagazine.com/pdf/102-17-29.pdf) contradicting D&amp;C 119:4

October 2010: The Sisters meet Pat, an investigator who is on kidney dialysis. Pat has been on kidney dialysis for 5 years. The Sisters think Pat is amazing -- so spiritual, such a sweet spirit, so curious and dedicated. She reads her scriptures eagerly and asks just the right amount of questions. A golden convert.

November 2010: The Sisters challenge Pat to baptism. Pat accepts. Pat is very excited to become a mormon. She has never felt so happy or at peace. Just one problem -- baptism is full immersion, and Pat has not taken a bath or shower in 5 years, since starting her kidney dialysis. Pat is given sponge baths, because she cannot get water around the tubing for her kidney dialysis. The Sisters are sure the Lord will provide, so Pat tells her doctor what's going on. Her doctor tells her she should not get baptized. He recommends against it on a medical basis -- this would be very bad for Pat, and although he's happy that she's found friendship and spiritual peace in the LDS church, he says he must recommend against baptism, for Pat's health.

It's okay, say the Sisters! The Lord will provide! We will find a way! Perhaps, you are thinking, they decided to write the Presidency or MTC in SLC? Perhaps they decided to consult with their Mission President? Their bishop? Perhaps they simply explained the teachings of baptisms for the dead to Pat, and promised they would personally baptize her by proxy when she passed?

No. No, the Sisters came up with an ingenious method to ensure Pat's entry into the celestial kingdom: Saran wrap and duct tape. The site of Pat's kidney dialysis entry was lovingly wrapped in saran wrap and sealed with duct tape, and Pat was lovingly submerged in a tank of water against medical recommendation.

December 2010: So weird, laments my sister in her letters home. Pat has stopped coming to church. I really thought she had a stronger testimony. Why would Pat stop coming to church? My sister is concerned. It's been 3 weeks since anyone has seen Pat! Where could she be? We looked for her at church on Sunday, we called her, we even stopped by the nursing home! No Pat! 

Another letter comes, a week later. We found Pat! Pat has been in the hospital since shortly after her baptism. Poor Pat had some sort of infection, isn't that so sad? The doctors had to amputate her legs to keep it from spreading, isn't that so sad? But Pat is so lucky to have the Lord on her side. Pat is so thankful to be a member of the church. The Lord gives us nothing that we cannot handle!

The ""funny"" thing about this story (if there is anything remotely funny about it) is that my kid sister honestly does not seem to connect the kidney dialysis/ doctor's warning/ saran-wrap &amp; duct tape baptism with Pat's subsequent infection and amputation. She is blithely and happily certain that Pat's soul is saved, and just in the nick of time -- obviously the poor woman's health is deteriorating. 

I don't know how to interact with the kid anymore. I mean, I always thought of my sister as a basically good person who was slightly delusional about her beliefs, in the way religious people are. She seemed observant and clever enough to sidestep the sort of blithe, ignorantly destructive behavior described here. I feel like I never really knew her at all, and I've lost a great deal of respect for her. I simply do not know how to relate to her now.",,False,self,t5_2r0gj,False,,,True,t3_gexpd,http://www.reddit.com/r/exmormon/comments/gexpd/my_sister_the_missionary/,

And one that I am ready for is to be emotionally free of Mormonism. As I have exited from the Church, I have spent so much time studying, learning, evaulating and deconstructing Mormonism. The process has been healthy. I've come to the conclusion that while I think myself free of Mormonism, I am still enslaved to the Church -- not because I go or I pay money, but because of the amount of time that I've spent in the ex-Mormon online community reading and listening, thinking and deconstructing; all because I was trying to finally be free of the Church.

But there is one final catharysis that I need to take in order for me to be free of Mormonism. I need to leave the ex-Mormon community. I spent nearly four years thinking about who I want to be outside of Mormonism but I haven't taken any of those steps. And as I look around, there isn't much left for me in the ex-Mormonism community. 

I'm ready and I want to finally move on. 

So with that, my friends, I am releasing myself as a member of /r/exmormon. I'm off to try new things, meet new people and let Mormonism go completely. I'm done with all things Mormon. I'm sure that the Church will inject itself into my life from time to time, and there will be familial tensions. But I'm completely ready to deal with that. I just don't want to give the Church anymore emotional or intellectual attention. 

I hope one day that everyone on this reddit will be able to do the same -- to completely and totally step away. 

On Monday, I'm going to delete my account, and alastormoody will be gone. 


**edit:** At the sugguestion of others, the account of alastormoody will live on, but I will change the password to something I don't know. Perhaps the comments that I have made will help others in their journey. I may check in from time to time as another. 

For what its worth, I really do respect those in this community. I admire the courage that it takes to seperate from the Church. There are many in this community that I genuinely respect and even looked forward their posts.  I feel sorry for those that can't yet leave the Church completely. I spent two years going when I didn't want to and I know the emotional toll that can take.

A man volunteered to clean the church one Saturday. After he was done, he found he was the only person there. Mischievously, he decided to take a bath in the baptismal font now that his work was done. He stripped nude and took a nice, hot plunge.

He heard voices in the hallway and immediately started to panic. He had left his clothes in the adjoining bathroom, and only had a small towel in the room. With only seconds to spare, he decided to use the towel to cover his face and make a break for it.

He ran down the hall past three women coming toward him - the Primary President, the Young Women's President, and the Relief Society President.

The Primary President looked down and said, ""Well, that's not *my* husband.""

The Young Women's President looked down and said, ""That's definitely not *my* husband.""

The Relief Society President looked down and said, ""He's not even in our ward!""

When the wife and I left, The feedback from them was about what I expected (we love you , sob, what did we do wrong as parents?) but yesterday I had lunch with my mom (her request) to discuss the specifics of why we (my wife and I) left the church. I was very explicit with her (again, her request) as to my beliefs and practices. I felt that the conversation went well. however I did mention that if my ADULT sister asked me why I left the church, I would tell her.

My wife and I planned a trip to Florida, going tomorrow and leaving the dog with my family. This morning (23 hours before we leave) we get a text message from my mom which states that she and my father talked it over, and they no longer feel comfortable taking care of the dog. I assumed that it was something I said, but was not expecting what would come next.

A couple hours ago I received [this](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1LGvmHdiL2WMDYb5cSE89hSNZRllTWo7_LCfwemD0NK8/edit) email from my father. TL;DR version:

* We have decided to cut you off from the family to save your younger siblings 
* You are doing this (not us, you) by forcing us to do it
* You are definitely going to become an alcoholic (not an exaggeration, he knows it)  
* I wasn't going to say, but you are crazy
* I am kicking you off the insurance in 5 days GL+HF!

The thing I noticed over and over again was how much *he blamed me* for what was going on. In previous emails, he would tell me about how his greatest fear was that I would ""no longer be a part of his life"", Well, this particular Mormon prophecy has come true in that I am kicking him out of his life by the fact that he is kicking me out of his life. Again, his primary reason is that because I am willing to tell my ADULT FREAKIN SISTER if she ASKS me why I am leaving. 

I feel like I am in an episode of the twilight zone, my father is not the man that I thought he was. I know this will die down, but I don't think I can ever look at him the same way again.

**UPDATE**
While driving to my doctor for the last time (company doctor, can't use it without company insurance) my sister called me to broker a pow-wow between my wife and I, and my dad and sister. It played out like an exmormon after school special. The highlights:

* They could SEE that I had been changing over the last few months. I'v been an atheist for over a year. I didn't tell them, it would spoil their fun.
* In the last 3 years of college I've had 3 different college jobs. According to them, this instability indicates a possible personality disorder 
* I am abusive to my wife. The proof is that to escape from fights, I have stormed out of my dad's house yelling ""Come on wife or get a ride home"". About 30 seconds later, my dad shushed my wife as she tried to speak.
* I hate my sister's kids and motherhood. The two reasons for this are 1) I said I was proud that my wife was going back to medical school (this is an insult against my sister who stays at home with kids) and 2) I do not think that my niece (or anyone) has a soul.

I am tired of the church taking my mother away, turning my own family against me when I need them the most. I am so tired of the fighting, and the backlash, and the shaming, and all of the crap they put over me... Just because I don't believe. I hate the church for taking my mother away, they had no right to do that. Why does she love them more than me? Why doesn't she see that I'm hurting, and in pain, instead of just telling me it's true, and that happiness will come, even when I know it won't. Why does she keep telling me that I will be a horrible person if I leave, and that she won't want to talk to me after I move out... Why? Why does she threaten to take away the one thing that keeps me sane because I don't want to go to church, because I don't want to deal with this shit anymore? 

I was listening to her and her friend talk the other day, about my Grandpa, who committed suicide last year. Her friend kept going on and on about how evil my grandfather was because he was depressed, and turned to professional help after the church screwed him over. She kept going on and on about how he was an abusive husband, even though he did everything he could to please my grandma, to make her happy. She kept saying that my grandma had no place to grieve for him, because he was going to rot in hell, just because he couldn't take the pain. He couldn't take the shame either, and fuck them for taking my grandfather away from me. He was the kindest man, always doing things for others, and when he couldn't anymore, physically, mentally, and emotionally, they dumped him on the floor, like he was a piece of shit. They're the reason he did it. And I hate them for it. 

Fuck the church for almost taking my best friend away from me just because he is gay. Fuck the bishop because he told him that he was going to hell just for liking boys. I hope he rots in hell for the rest of eternity, because nobody, nobody deserves to be told they are evil and worthless because of their sexual orientation.

&gt;You are called by the Lord to **help youth become converted to the gospel**. What a wonderful blessing this is!

&gt;We encourage you to dedicate yourself to living the gospel with greater purpose than ever before. As you do, you will understand how to **help youth learn the gospel by their own study and faith, to discover the truthfulness of the gospel for themselves**, and to strengthen their families and others by sharing their experiences, insights, and testimony.

Page fucking 2

&gt;The First Presidency has taught that your purpose as a teacher of youth is to **help them become converted to the gospel** of Jesus Christ.

&gt;The path to conversion is a personal one. Conversion does not happen in a meeting, class, or activity alone. **Ultimately, youth are converted by diligently living the gospel each day**—praying, studying the scriptures, **keeping the commandments**, fulfilling priesthood and other duties, attending the temple, serving their families and others, and sharing the gospel. As they do these things, their desires, attitudes, and actions begin to align with Heavenly Father’s will.

Article of Faith #4 - We believe that the first principles and ordinances of the Gospel are: first, Faith in the Lord Jesus Christ; second, Repentance; third, Baptism by immersion for the remission of sins; fourth, Laying on of hands for the gift of the Holy Ghost.

The entire structure of the church is now: first, Baptism by immersion for the remission of sins; second, Laying on of hands for the gift of the Holy Ghost; third, Faith in the Lord Jesus Christ; fourth, Repentance.

The church manual knows that the youth have already been baptized and confirmed, but then admits that they are not converted.

Repentance is when you change your behavior to be obedient to commandments. This is now the last thing that happens in the conversion process.

It's such a bait-and-switch - First you lock them in and keep reminding them that the are now fully accountable for any and all sins they commit for the rest of their lives. They are now life-long committed to obedience, but have no clue why they obey (no testimony) and don't even know what they have committed to obey (haven't had the commandments explained).

They might use the defense of teaching children ""line upon line, precept upon precept,"" but Jesus was over 30 years old before he felt ready to get baptized [allegedly]. He grew and developed through childhood and adolescence. THEN he took the plunge.

Be gentle :) 

Watching general conference this morning, Boyd K. Packer spoke second. It wasn't hard to predict two things heading into conference: 1st: a Saturday Morning talk would be geared towards the sanctity of traditional marriage, and 2nd: BKP would give that talk.  
Upon his conclusion, my thoughts were immediate and clear: it felt regressive, repressive, and uninspired. He described excessive tolerance being a vice and not a virtue, and that legalizing certain things doesn't change the violation of god's law of chastity. 

I titled this post out of sight out of mind because, if this is, as the brethren boast, a global church, then it should advocate for 'righteousness' on a global level, not on a local level. I immediately began thinking of other countries around the world, and wondered what their laws of the land were in regards to marriage equality. I wanted to focus on countries where the church currently has a presence. The first google link was titled ""11 countries where same-sex marriage is legal"". I wish more members would consider that they live in a much bigger world than the insignificant sliver they've carved out for themselves. 
It is so hypocritical to me to spend so much time and money oppressing others in California and the United States while ignoring the rest of the world. I don't see the church publicly denouncing the laws in Africa demanding prison time or death just for being gay. I don't see them lobbying in other countries to abolish laws that allow same sex marriage. If the laws of god are just that, the laws of god, then it should make no difference where they are being 'violated'. Don't go all Prop 8 in the USA, if you're going to be apathetic to other countries' laws of the land. But I guess, out of sight out of mind.

My reply:

If there's anything I've learned from leaving the church, it's that there is a much, much better life out there waiting to be discovered!

- There are better ways to spend Sundays than in Mormon Church meetings.

- There is better underwear out there than the underwear Mormons are conditioned to wear. (This is especially true for women!)

- There's a better way to embrace spirituality than is possible in Mormonism. 

- There are better ways of spending that 10% of your income you give to the Mormon Church.

- There are better ways to talk about sex with your kids than Mormon teachings allow.

- There are better ways to get married than the closed and shallow temple sealing.

- There are better cures for illness than priesthood blessings.

- There are better health practices than the Word of Wisdom.

- There are better ways to pick which movies to see.

- There are better ways to raise girls into women than is possible in the Mormon Church.

- There are better ways to speak about non-believers than Mormonism practices.

- There are better ways to deal with diversity than Mormonism models.

- There are better family values than Mormonism teaches.

- There is more hope for the world than Mormonism gives.

- There are more inspirational books out there than Mormon scriptures and the Bible.

- There are better ways to make decisions than ""following the holy ghost.""

- There are better ways to help our communities than practiced in Mormonism.

- There is more wonder for life available outside of Mormonism.

- There are more ways to love your spouse after Mormonism.

- There are better things you can do than spend two years/eighteen months on an LDS mission.

- There are better ways to keep a family close together than within Mormonism.

- There are better speakers out there than you'll ever hear in General Conference.

- There is better information about life available outside of the church than in it.

- There's better things to do than attending repetitive Mormon masonic temple rites.

I could go on, and on and on, but you get the point. There is a better life out there for you after Mormonism! And the biggest crime in staying Mormon is that you're robbing yourself of a better life.

If you don't see the possibility that there is a better life outside of Mormonism for you, then you're still indoctrinated. If you really think the Mormon way is not any worse than the wonderful variety and experiences without it, then you are still buying into the big Mormon lie.

Like an abusive spouse, Mormonism would have you believe that you can't live without it. That's the real B.S. of Mormonism.

He unfortunately for himself was murdered by the heathen Gentiles. This emigrant train happened to be from the same section of the country in which Pratt was killed. The Mormons were so insulted and indignant over the death and the murder of Pratt that they wreaked untold vengeance on the poor emigrants. This is supposed to be the cause of the Mountain Meadow Massacre."" -- quote from Ann Gordsley, John D. Lee's youngest widow

**23rd of July, 1857** Brigham Young declares independence from the United States of America, and informs the crowd that the U.S. Army is on it's way ""the thread is broken, the Kingdom of God is established, and the arrival of the Army in Utah will mark the beginning of the end of days.""

**Aug 3, 1857** George A. Smith sets out to tour Southern Utah starting in Parowan

**Aug 5, 1857** Brigham Young Declares Martial Law.  Formal announcement sent out Sept 15th.

**Aug 17, 1857** A member of the Dukes train, S. B. Honea, stated ""that he passed through Great Salt Lake City on August 17, that he saw everywhere preparations for war, that the company were harassed by Indians all the way, that in southern Utah they hired Mormon guides and interpreters to the sum of $1,810, and then were robbed on the Muddy [River] of 375 head of cattle.  [George B.] Davis described the Indians who stole the cattle as having among them some with light, fine hair and blue eyes, and light streaks where they had not used sufficient paint. He gave the number of cattle taken as 326 head.....On October 17, the first members of the Duke train of emigrants arrived half-starved at San Bernardino with the Mormon theft of their cattle to add to the tale of the massacre.""

**Aug 25, 1857** George A. Smith camps near the Franchers at Corn Creek,  Jacob Hamblin suggests they continue the trail and rest at Mountain Meadows, next to his homestead.

**Betwen Aug 25th and Sept 6th**  Stake Presidents William H. Dame and Isaac C. Haight,  the senior regional military leaders of the Mormon militia, hold meetings about how to implement Brigham's ""Martial Law""

**Sept 1** Hamblin and some twelve Indian chiefs on September first met with Brigham Young and his most trusted interpreter, 49-year-old Dimick Huntington, at Great Salt Lake. Taking part in this pow-wow were Kanosh, the Mormon chief of the Pahvants; Ammon, half-brother of Walker; Tutsegabit, head chief of the Piedes;Youngwuds, another Piede chieftain, and other leaders of desert bands along the Santa Clara and Virgin Rivers. Little was known of what they talked about until recently when it came to light that Huntington (apparently speaking for Young) told the chiefs that he 'gave them all the cattle that had gone to Cal[ifornia by] the south rout[e].' The gift 'made them open their eyes,' he said. But 'you have told us not to steal,' the Indians replied. 'So I have,' Huntington said, but now they have come to fight us and you for when they kill us they will kill you.' The chiefs knew what cattle he was giving them. They belonged to the Baker-Fancher train."" (""Forgotten Kingdom: The Mormon Theocracy in the American West,"" David Bigler, 1998, pp. 167-168.) 

""Jacob Hamblin.....decided to take a group of the chiefs to Great Salt Lake City for an interview with the great Mormon chief, Brigham Young. His handwritten diary, as yet unpublished, says: 'I started for Great Salt Lake City in company with Thales Haskell and Tutsegabit...He had felt anxious for a long time to visit Brigham Young. We fell in company with George A. Smith. Conosh [Kanosh, the Pauvant chief] joined us. Other Indian chiefs also joined our company. When we arrived in the city there were ten of them went up to see Brigham Young, the great Mormon chief. We encamped on Corn Creek on our way up; near a company of Emigrants from Arkansas, on the-----' 

""Here the account stops abruptly, for the next leaf is torn out.....What Brigham Young told the chiefs in that hour was not recorded, but we might hazard an opinion that it was not out of harmony with his written instructions that 'they must learn that they have got to help us or the United States will kill us both.'.....At that time Brigham Young had to be sure of his allies, for he was conducting a war against tremendous odds. The previous Mormon policy had been to keep the natives from stealing and plundering and to teach them the peaceful pursuits of farming and cattle raising, but now Brigham Young seemed determined that he would no longer ""hold them by the wrist,"" as he told Captain Van Vliet a few days later. The Indians must have started back home immediately, for in seven days they were harassing the emigrants at Mountain Meadows, and in ten days they participated in the massacre of the company."" (Brooks, pp. 40-42.) 

**Sept 4, 1857** Francher Party arrives at Cedar City

Isaac Haight, second in command of the Nauvoo Legion's southern brigade, tells John Lee that he planned to arm the Paiute Indians and ""send them after the emigrants.""  Two chiefs meet with Haight and John Higbee and receive orders to kill the Fancher party members and take their property as spoil.

**Sept 5, 1857** John Lee heads south and camps with his Paiute war party.  Men ordered by Haight and Higbee to participate in the action against the emigrants are told to report to a place in the hills near the ranch of Jacob Hamblin.  The Fancher party heads south toward Mountain Meadows.

**Sept 6, 1857** Brigham Young, in a sermon, declares that the Almighty recognizes Mormon Utah as a free and independent people, no longer bound by the laws of the United States.

**Sept 7th, 1857** - Dawn (Mountain Meadows)  The Fancher wagon train from Arkansas, bound for California, is attacked at dawn.

**Sept 10th, 1857** - Daybreak (Mountain Meadows)  - Indians Attack, 1 killed 3 wounded.  They  break off the attack, and drive off cattle

Mlitia commanders ring the town bell in Cedar City, calling out trusted members of the Nauvoo Legion.  

Messenger carrying news to Salt Lake gives Haight's letter to Brigham Young.  Young, according to published Mormon reports, sends a message back to let the Indians ""do as they please,"" but--as for Mormon participation in the siege--if they will leave Utah, ""let them go in peace.""


 7:00 am (SLC) - Haslam arrives at Brigham Young's office

 12:00 pm (Mountain Meadows) - White, Stewart, Arthur, Wilden, Hopkins and Tate arrive

 About noon: ""Several men"" arrived from Cedar City. Move camp 400 yards. Mormons take pot shots at emigrants. Emigrants chain wagons together.

-1:00 pm (SLC): Haslam departs Brigham Young's office (Cedar City) Main militia party under Higbee leaves Cedar City

  Afternoon: Lee reconnoiters camp and is detected; emigrants send out two little boys. Lee persuades Indians not to kill the boys. Stays on west side two hours.

             Afternoon: ""the messenger from Cedar City returned. He said that President Haight had gone to Parowan to confer with Colonel Dame, and a company of men would be sent out to-morrow (Friday). ""The Indians and men were engaged in boiling beef and making their hides up into lassoes.""

             Nightfall: Three emigrants (including Abel Baker, Joseph Miller, and ""William B. Jones, Caldwell County, Missouri""?) leave the wagon fort for the California Road.

             Evening: Militia arrives from Cedar [232]. Total force now 54 whites ""and over three hundred Indians."" All-night council held.

             10:00 pm: Nephi Johnson, Higbee, and Militia arrive at Mountain Meadows.

**Sept 11, 1857** The Wagon train gives up their guns, and are executed ""order 66"" style by the men they are riding next to.  120 killed 80 women and children, mostly children.

Mormon leaders devise a plan to end the stand-off.  Carrying a white flag, Mormons meet with members of the Fancher party and pledge the emigrants safe passage back to Cedar City as a way of getting them to give up their arms. The Fancher party is divided into two wagons, carrying the wounded and the youngest children (""the innocent blood""), with the older children and women marching behind, followed by the men, marching in single file.  The men are led off to a place near the side of the road where Higbee orders a group of Mormons guards to begin the killing: ""Do your duty!""  A quarter of a mile away, John Lee leads the wagons until they reach a point where Nelphi Johnson orders the slaughter of the women and older children. Men rush at the party from both sides, and the killing continues amidst ""hideous, demon-like yells.""  It is over in just a few minutes. 120 members of the Fancher party are dead.  The youngest children, those under about age seven, are taken away.

Ironically, BYU made it completely obvious to me the church was a fraud. This scared me to death at first, thinking how my friends and family would take it. And on top of that, I learned BYU kicks out exmos. 

I applied as a transfer student to Duke, where I had wanted to go in the first place, and I just learned I've been accepted, and given a very generous financial aid package at that.

It's increasingly painfully obvious how much of this religion is an enormous cultural circlejerk interpreted as eternal truths, all wrapped up in a dogma furthered by blind adherence to men who just so happened to be put in certain position
s which suddenly made them unquestionable DJs for God.

What's the doctrine? Oh, whatever we decide it to be this year. But don't worry about what it was last year; that was ""truth"" for then, but isn't ""truth"" now. Remember that current leaders are always right, even if previous leaders have been wrong, and that even though all of them disagree on some level with some things and are subject to their own preconceived biases and opinions, it's all ""God's Word"". Didn't you know God was schizophrenic?

Caffeine? Yeah, that's against the Word of Wisdom. Except when it's not. Well, it kind of is. Okay, it's not at all. I mean, yes, Joseph Smith drank wine and tea, and the vast majority of the Word of Wisdom is really just a guideline left up to interpretation, but we're still going to hardline you on our interpretation of just a few of its verses, anyway. And yes, blacks were inferior before 1978, but then God suddenly revealed they were okay after all, so it's okay to let your kids play with them (so long as they're Mormon and act white, of course!). And yes, R-rated movies are just like watching hardcore pornography, but that was only in the 80s when President Benson said that, and now it's more of a ""guideline"" that we won't enforce but will still judge you for. And yes, modesty once meant women were immoral if they showed their ankles, but now they're good all the way up to bare arms to the shoulders, though if they go above that we're going to have to Photoshop it out. Those angels and little girls in those pictures just looked too gosh darn sexual!

And sure, homosexuals were inherently evil enough for us to spy on, shock, and condemn them a few decades ago, but now God has decided they're just ""misguided"" (though still morally inferior). And sure, in the future we're going to decide to fully accept them once general culture no longer accepts our bigotry, but just be comfortable knowing you can still look down on them for now. Sure, Mark E. Petersen once said interracial marriage was the greatest threat facing society, but don't worry about that; he was only slightly wrong! It's actually homosexual marriage. You can trust us on that, now, because of all the objective evidence showing how homosexuals are ruining society.

No, no, don't bother looking for that evidence, just trust us. It's there.

See, when a church leader is wrong, they were ""just speaking as a man"", but when they're right they are speaking for God. Oh, how do you know the difference? It's easy: see, if something they said later reflects poorly on them or us, they were speaking as a man, but otherwise they were speaking for God. We're professional retconners for God, after all.

It's all ""truth"", and we're always right about it, silly, just don't worry about it or question us. It'll be easier that way.

&gt; The need for Mormon Stories arises from the tendency Mormons have to value each other based on how well they echo or amplify the opinions of LDS leaders. Mormons who cease to echo or amplify these opinions often discover that there is little or no bond of personal loyalty or compassion underlying their relationships with loved ones. As a consequence, the Mormon who suffers a crisis of faith frequently faces rejection and ultimatums from family members, including her spouse. She sometimes even finds herself accused of disobedience or immorality. In a sense, the Mormons are a morally handicapped people; their tendency to value members based on their alignment with LDS leadership limits Mormons’ potential for virtue by rendering them less capable of loyalty and compassion.

Hello!

A group of individuals (unincorporated) have collected enough personal funds to put up a billboard along the 600 S. Exit from I-80.

It is an advertisement for the MormonThink website. They have tried going through Reagan Outdoor as the billboard company.

They were denied on the premise that the billboard is ""too offensive.""

The billboard design contains no offensive or hateful verbiage, and no offensive images. The only ""offense"" that could be taken is personal offense that someone might have a different opinion about a religion. The intent of the billboard is to reach out to those who are questioning their faith, and to promote a website that would be able to provide accurate information for their questions.

I remember a similar situation back around 2006 when Jeff Ricks from PostMormon.org had trouble with Reagan, and contacted Utah ACLU. He claims he was informed that he may have grounds for a religious discrimination lawsuit.

What are the legalities concerning matters like this?

Thank you for your time,

It has been hard...very hard.  Lots of tears, counseling, nights spend on the couch, etc.  She remains semi-active, and has been in her own faith crisis for about a year now.  Hers is very different than mine, but just a real. I needed the church to be true, and once I learned they are liars, my faith crumbled to nothing.  She needs the church to work socially/emotionally, and is struggling with the institutionalized gender inequality and homophobia of the church.  Through it all, our love and respect for each other has endured, something I am extremely grateful for. 
 
This weekend had a few watershed moments for her/us. I think she's already made up her mind about the church; she just hasn't reached that point where she can pull the trigger, walk away, and change her underwear. But, she's getting there:
 
* About once every 3 months, my wife and I get a hotel room for 1-2 nights. We've found it is healthy for our relationship to make time to relax without the kids, sleep in, eat somewhere that doesn't have pictures of the food on the menu, and basically just be alone together.  We did that this weekend, and I brought a cooler of alcoholic beverages for me to enjoy. I like craft beers, and typically grab 6 different singles from the liquor store at a time.  I decided to change things up a bit this time, and grabbed 3 different flavors of Mike's Hard Lemonade in addition to 3 beers.  I went straight to the hotel after work, and waited for my wife to drop the kids off and join me.  When she got to the hotel room, she cracked the cooler out of curiosity, and asked with a smile if I'd bought the sweet drinks to tempt her. I had not, they were intended for me.  She closed the lid, and paused for a beat. Then she turned to look and me, smiled, and said ""Let's have drunk sex tonight"". I almost climaxed right then.  She drank all 3 Mike's in less than 2 hours (she's 115 lbs., btw), and have drunk sex we did. It was very, very fun! But, as fun as the drunk sex was, I think I enjoyed the experience of *getting* drunk with her more. Sitting on the couch, laughing, philosophizing, remember good times we'd had together, talking about the future...it was a truly excellent experience for me, one which I didn't expect to ever have with her.  There is something special about adding alcohol to good times with people you care about. I'll never forget the first time I shared a beer with my brother.  Nor will I forget the first time I shared a drink with my wife after 9 years or marriage.  Somehow, a little alcohol makes good times even better.  She asked me to keep her drinking a secret. She isn't ready to drink regularly (or publicly) yet. So, don't say anything about it, OK?
 
* My garments have been in a trash bag in the back of the closet for over a year. She unceremoniously tossed them out on Saturday after we got back from the hotel; just like you would any other pair of worn out clothing.
 
* She teaches Young Women's twice a month.  Usually, I try and help her come up with a NOM or figurative spin on the lessons so that they are more palatable to her.  Yesterday lesson was ""Why was JS so important?”  I told her I would not be able to help her with that lesson, as the JS the church believes in is a mythical representation of someone I consider to be a con-man.  She struggled with what to teach, and finally decided to have the girls teach themselves. She gave them pictures of Joseph's life, and had them spend 10 minutes researching the stories behind them, and then presented them to the class.  Good enough for now, she said.  Well, the only thing we talked about when she got home from church until after dinner was what the historical record says vs. what the correlated version says.  Peep stone vs. Urim and Thumim, the ""testimonies"" of the men who say they ""saw"" the golden plates, the mixed up timelines on priesthood restoration, secret polygamy...She was very attentive, and soaked it up.  She kept saying, ""Show me"", which helped me be accurate with my dates and context. We used **No Man Knows My History** and **Rough Stone Rolling** a lot.  She got really upset as I shared a more accurate history of Emma Smith.  My wife is quick to take the side of the downtrodden, and hearing how much crap Emma had to deal with, and how she was villainized by the Brighamites really got under her skin.
 
* My mother-in-law is in a stressful marriage.  She frequently comes over to our house to vent, relax, and hang out away from her own home.  At times, these visits are intrusive, but usually they are not a problem.  A few weeks ago she watched the kids while my wife and I went on a date, and she hung around to talk after we got home around 10 PM.  As my MIL is venting about her latest frustration, my wife blurts out, ""Mom! I finally get it.  You need to take a break from the church. So much of your stress and unhappiness comes from your attempts to make yourself fit into the mold the church tells you to fit into. You should take a break."" This led us into a great conversation about my reasons for leaving, and my wife's reasons for doubting yet staying (for now).  This is a conversation I would love to have with my own parents, but unfortunately I doubt it will ever happen. They are just too TBM.  Anyway, it was 2 AM before she left.  The following morning she text me saying, ""Thanks for the talk. However, my truth is not your truth. My path is not your path. Thanks for being a good husband to my daughter and a good friend to me.""  I figured she'd felt the neurons starting to fire, and like so many of us, got scared and stopped thinking about it.  Oh well, I get it.  You have to be ready to be unplugged, right Morpheus?  Well, last night around 8 PM, she came over and basically says, ""Damn it, bodona!  I've spent most of my 60 years active in the church, and it NEVER seemed unfair to me.  But after our conversation the other night, I can't stop thinking about the imbalance between genders in the church.  How did I never see that the male equivalent of motherhood is fatherhood, not the priesthood? Ugh, that is such a flimsy argument; I'm embarrassed I believed it for so long.

The Mormon God is the quintessential abusive parent / authority figure.  ,117,15,22,http://www.reddit.com/r/exmormon/comments/1a8ixy/a_sudden_realization_the_mormon_god_is_the/,"* You're given **contradictory instructions** and then punished for breaking one of them. (Adam and Eve - reproduce, but don't become a mortal) 

* You're taught to be **grateful when he hurts you**.  Everything bad is either a trial from him or punishment for your poor choices.  In fact, suffering is the primary means of growth.  You're told that you can't know joy until you've known pain. 

* You're taught to **give him credit for all good things** in your life, or for any good thing in the world.  If something works out, it's never your own doing. 

* You're taught to **praise and thank him obsessively**.  Every time you start a conversation with him, and to keep such thoughts of praise ""in your hearts"" continually. 

* You're taught to **never demand he speak or appear to you**.  He will do so as he sees fit.  If he feels like doing it, he will.  If not, you're supposed to keep trying until he does.   Prime examples of good children are those who begged him for day(s) (Alma/Enos).  

* You're taught to **accept his inconsistencies** and always trust the people he puts over you.  Forget about the failures of the past.  If the new instructions are inconsistent, always obey the latest opinion.  If they're wrong, still obey them.  If you believe he has told you something that contradicts them, you're immediately wrong.  (14 fundamentals). 

* He teaches you that **his morality is situational**.  There's a law for everyone, and then a special law as he sees fit: Abraham - Slavery/abuse/kidnapping, Nephi - Murder/theft.  Adam's children - Incest.   Moses/Aaron - Genocide/war.   Other Jewish leaders - Rape, murder, lying, and all manner of whoredoms,  Alma - saved in sin.  

* He's a **racist who punishes his children for their skin color**.   He has a ""preferred group"".  Depending on his mood, he'll let them run amok or beat them soundly.  He later changed his mind on racism.  (Brigham vs Blacks/Jews vs Gentiles)

* He **blames other men for failings** or lack of consistancy.  Racism for 150 years.   Current teaching is that one of his leaders (Kimball) asked him to stop being racist, and he said okay.  It's now ~~Brigham's~~ some unknown source's fault.  

* He has **no problems lying to you**, or authorizing his leaders to lie to you, whenever he wishes (See Polygamy/danites/Abraham), but condemns others to burn for eternity for the same (2 Nephi 9).  

* His process of **education pattern is bi-polar and text-book emotional abuse** (D&amp;C 121).  Sharply hurt anyone who acts in a way you disapprove of, but then bring them back to you with kind words.  Rinse, repeat.  

* He's **extremely overbearing and a sociopath**, up to drowning all of his other children (save 3) simply because they do not obey him. He has no problem hurting innocents to make a point.  (Starving African children, ""innocent"" children in the book of mormon (Alma's fire), Children in Noah's flood, Children in Sodom and Grimorah, Egyptian first-borns, etc...). 

* He **requires extreme tests of loyalty**, up to killing your only child at his command (Isaac).

* You're **never allowed to ask about your mother**.  You can't even know her name or what she does.    

* His **daughters can't ever have control**, will never handle his finances, and their primary duty is to make more children for him.   They will forever only have power through their husband.  The family history he claims to have written just for you does not have a single, named female role model. Of the unnamed, obedience and blind belief are praised. 

* He's **incestuous**.  He slept with his own daughter to produce the perfect child. 

* He is **actively trying to strip you of your identity**.  He praises those who emulates him.  He gives you a new name.  He forces conformity in act and thought.  He mandates clothing choices.

Surprisingly, the question came up about why there were only men in the circle of the confirmation, and why there are only men when their cousins are blessed as babies. I explained that the mormon church teaches that only men hold the priesthood, and they believe that the priesthood is needed for the blessings. I then went on to explain that the born-again point of view is that Jesus gives the priesthood to his followers so both men and women can give blessings in their church, but they still believe that only men can be leaders, and that is why there are no women pastors or preachers in their church.

Now, I've been on this tour since I was knee-high to Brigham's third wife's second cousin.  Almost to the point that I could say what the girls were going to say before they said it.

But this time was different.  So strap in, hold on, and make sure all seagulls and crickets observe the no smoking sign.  We're going to take a stroll down the famous square for the squares.

**Approach**

Of course one of the big changes happened when the church purchased [main street plaza](http://www.acluutah.org/mainstreetplaza.htm) to prevent protestors.  Now if only they had said they were buying it for ""Downtown renovation"", maybe the big 'ol ACLU wouldn't have been so concerned.

Rounding the corner one, of course sees the new Conference Center.  Fullfilling the little known prophesy that, “The time will come when … we shall build … on the top, groves and fish ponds” (Deseret News Weekly, 30 Apr. 1853, 46 stated by Brigham Young about temples).  Now those little ""..."" ellipses have nailed me before so let's get the whole quote:

""This I do know-there should be a temple built here. I do know it is the duty of this people to commence to build a temple. Now, some will want to know what kind of a building it will be. Wait patiently, brethren, until it is done, and put forth your hands willingly to finish it. I know what it will be. I scarcely ever say much about revelations, or visions, but suffice it to say, five years ago last July I was here, and saw in the spirit the temple not ten feet from where we have laid the chief cornerstone. I have not inquired what kind of a temple we should build. Why? Because it was represented before me. I have never looked upon that ground, but the vision of it was there. I see it as plainly as if it was in reality before me. Wait until it is done. I will say, however, that it will have six towers, to begin with, instead of one. Now do not any of you apostatize because it will have six towers, and Joseph only built one. It is easier for us to build sixteen, than it was for him to build one. The time will come when there will be one in the centre of temples, we shall build, and, on the top, groves and fish ponds. But we shall not see them here, at present (Discourses of Brigham Young, p.410)""

Ah, so you see, the conference center with groves and fish ponds on the top matches what Brigham saw of the Salt Lake Temple, by having trees and a waterfall.  Fulfilling prophesy in the only way that the LDS god can, I guess.

Moving on down past the rotating homeless people with cardboard signs, one enters the grounds and moves into the visitor center requesting a tour from two 19 year old girls, who are sugar-excited to guide one.

**Stop 1**

The first stop is outside the SLC temple itself.  They do not tell you about the [masonic handshake](http://lifeafter.org/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/temple-symbols-12.jpg) above the window on the first floor, representing God extending his hand out to man (similar to the [Sistine Chapel concept](http://www.history.com/news/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/sistine-chapel-creation-of-adam.jpg) but more manly and more steeped in ""Secret combination"".

Nor will they mention the [all seeing eye of God](http://www.utlm.org/images/masonictemplearticle/thesaltlaketemple_p156.jpg) on the second window, which is [also masonic](http://freemasonry.bcy.ca/symbolism/apron_eye.jpg).  If you begin to ask, they'll direct you to the [sun](https://www.google.com/search?q=sun+stone+salt+lake+temple&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;hs=swW&amp;rls=org.mozilla:en-US:official&amp;tbm=isch&amp;tbo=u&amp;source=univ&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=ouoDUsbgLImuyQG1r4CQBg&amp;ved=0CC8QsAQ&amp;biw=1343&amp;bih=746), [moon](https://www.google.com/search?q=sun+stone+salt+lake+temple&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;hs=swW&amp;rls=org.mozilla:en-US:official&amp;tbm=isch&amp;tbo=u&amp;source=univ&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=ouoDUsbgLImuyQG1r4CQBg&amp;ved=0CC8QsAQ&amp;biw=1343&amp;bih=746#bav=on.2,or.r_cp.r_qf.&amp;fp=67f436ee66bfb56f&amp;q=moon+stone+salt+lake+temple&amp;rls=org.mozilla:en-US%3Aofficial&amp;sa=1&amp;tbm=isch) and star stones and talk about the glories of heaven.

They do cover the  basic facts about the temple taking 40 years to build and might even mention the railroad if pressed.  [Wikipedia has far more information](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salt_Lake_Temple) but less of a smile.

**Stop 2**

[The tabernacle](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salt_Lake_Tabernacle).  They'll tell you all about the marvel of the building, and its acoustics, even complete with a sprint-commercial quality ""pin drop"".  The basics of the acoustics are founded on the principle of ovals and focal points. One of the interesting bits they won't tell you is that [Henry Grow](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_Grow), the designer, told Brigham the maximum size he could build it, and in typical CEO fashion, Brigham required an extra 50 feet.

**Stop 3** 

Now if memory serves, they used to take people out to the seagull statue and the statues of Joseph, Hyrum and the restoration of the priesthood.  The [seagull story](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miracle_of_the_gulls) might have lost its luster when bird scientists showed that the gulls had been doing the [same behavior for generations long before Pioneers](http://www.mrm.org/seagulls) arrived as well LDS scholars illustrating there really was no good data to back it up.  Ah well, the desert state's bird being a sea-bird will need to be correlated I suppose.

But instead we were led to **THE CHAIR**

Inside the visitor center, on the upper floor, the missionaries lead one to a little room that is more than fascinating.  I thought we were headed to the statues of prophets in which Isiah is sporting a very Brigham Young Beard.  But no, instead we went into a room decorated by Zion's Canyon rocks and a movie was started.

Scene 1: Family complains of hiking in Zion's

Scene 2: Family has fun together at Zion's

By this point, the discordant notes in the music, made me instantly feel like something bad was going to happen.  I thought ""this is an LDS family film, I must be..."" and then the kid fell off the cliff.

The dad moseys over, no rushing or anything, to check out the kid and he hasn't actually fallen to his doom.

Scene 4: Dad comments on how the kid's ""noise"" is now something worth listening to.

The lights come on, and the missionaries ask what it means to a member to have living prophets.

They pick me.

**The whole thing goes off track**

I ask them if they REALLY want to know what I think.  They confirm they do.  I explain that I've left the religion, and I believe that people who called themselves prophets were just men, who said things.  Given that this is what the correlated church says about Brigham too, I figure this is a pretty politic answer.  I didn't even bring up that the mixed race couple that is with us that day would have had a javelin thrown threw their hearts if Brigham were there.  I was being good.

This lead to the poor teenagers panicking.  Tears were in eyes and they barely recovered by the end of the tour.  The one who spoke English best bore *MIGHTY TESTIMONY* that even though she didn't know everything, she knew that prophets were real and that God loved us.  

It was a brilliant passive aggressive way to say ""You're wrong"".  They then ignore my existence for the remainder of the trip, and focus everything on the non-member surrounded by faithful members.

**The rest of the chair**

So you actually move from room to room, but the chair continues in linked semi-circles.  You witness the family play ball together, have their first daughter, have grandpa die, and the oldest daughter get married.  Every piece is backed by emotionally charged music, and followed by leading questions (The kind I was taught as a missionary not to use) meant to maximize the emotional effect.  The temple is presented as the solution to all of life's problems, and the multiple mentions of ""Christ""  makes me think back to my marketing training and that this is summed up as ""product differentiation"".  You're christian, but our product is different because of new improved ""Temple"".  Have a loved one die?  Try ""Temple"".

The fascinating thing is that [Christ actually taught that marriage ends at death](http://biblehub.com/matthew/22-30.htm) and yet they continually cited Christ's teachings as the best way to raise a family, and then.. ""temple, eternal family, temple"" like they were relying on poorly read Christians as the target market.

The sister who spoke English uses every opportunity to dig in to me.  She says things like ""I may not know everything"" and ""There are those who lose or deny the basic tenants of love"".

The brilliant thing is the ""investigator"" or should I say ""Fiance who has been flirted to be converted"" picks up on these, and asks her why she is saying them.  They are out of place compared to the rest of the script and he really drives it home.  She replies that ""Some people may lose what they had"" and he comes back with ""No, when you really love someone, you still love them, even if you get angry for a while... you don't ever lose it"".

All in all, the social pressure of surrounding a non-member with people and refusing any voice that doesn't play into the script reminded me of [this scene](http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-KgwUd7pZ7OM/TqheXJ22iEI/AAAAAAAAAwE/6YeCNPasc94/s320/clockwork%252520new.jpg).  

The emotional manipulation, the refusal of questioning voices, the shunning of those who left, and the proposal that this small group had the only solution, all of which are ways to [identify a cult](http://www.csj.org/infoserv_cult101/checklis.htm).  I don't know if the rest of mormonism is a cult, but that room, that was cultism reduced and concentrated.

**Disturbing Fact #1 Joseph Smith married eleven women who were currently married to other men.**

Here is the record on the Church website of Joseph Smith's marriage to several of his wives, including Eliza R. Snow, Fanny Alger, Helen Mar Kimball, Zina Huntington and Sarah Ann Whitney.
https://familysearch.org/pal:/MM9.2.1/SP6X-Q65

Documentation can also be found in the book In Sacred Lonliness by Todd Compton which is available at Deseret Book


 **Disturbing Fact  #2 Polygamy as practiced by Joseph Smith contradicts how it is laid out in the D&amp;C 132. And D&amp;C 132 is the doctrinal basis for modern day polygamy.**

http://www.lds.org/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/132.58-66?lang=eng#57

If he was marrying women who were married to other men, then they probably weren't virgins. It is indesputable that Zina Huntington Jacobs Smith Young was not a virgin because she was 6 months pregnant when she married JS.


**#3 Joseph kept many of his polygamous marriages secret from Emma.**

If he was keeping these things secret from Emma then she was not giving her permission, another contradiction to D&amp;C 132.

Journal accounts of Emily Partridge, letter in Joseph Smith's own handwriting telling Sarah Ann Whitney to meet him secretly and not to come if he saw Emma around, this is quoted in Mormon Enigma: Emma Hale Smith by Linda K. Newell and Valeene Tippets (available at Deseret Book), accounts from In Sacred Lonliness  talk more about each wives' individual experience

**#4 Joseph Smith lied to the general membership about polygamy while he was practicing it.**

Here are some quotes from the 1835 edition of the D&amp;C
&gt;D&amp;C 101:4 “Inasmuch as this Church of Christ has been reproached with the crime of fornication, and polygamy: we declare that we believe, that one man should have one wife; and one woman, but one husband, except in case of death, when either is at liberty to marry again.”

The affidavit published in the LDS October 1, 1842 Times and Seasons  said: 
 &gt;“…we know of no other rule or system of marriage than the one published in the Book of Doctrine and Covenants.”

It was signed by Joseph Smith, Eliza R. Snow, Sarah Ann Whitney and several others who were practicing polygamy when they signed it.

**TL:DR – Anxious about meeting with Bishop, turned out he was really respectful and not at all pressuring. Sometimes we make things harder in our minds than they have to be.**


I just had a meeting with my Bishop last night about my unbelief and desire to be released from my calling, and I fully expected to come back to this forum and rant about it. Instead, I feel like I need to share that it was a remarkably positive experience. 

What I appreciated most was that he was very respectful, and didn't judge me at all. He obviously asked about what I didn't believe and why. I told him. He responded that he could see why I felt the way I did given that.  He agreed to release me from my calling, though stated that being a stake calling, it wouldn't happen immediately next Sunday, and was supportive in regards to affirming that I shouldn't ""worry about it"" and that ""we'll handle anything that might have been your responsibility just fine."" (just because I don't believe, doesn't mean I don't feel bad for bailing and causing more burden on others to pick up the slack)

We talked a little about belief and faith, and he stated that he’s never had a hard time believing, but acknowledged that for some it’s a struggle to believe in anything that’s not verifiable and that that’s an okay thing. 

He told me he won’t make me a “ward project” and won’t be “sending people to visit” me. He asked if I’d take the missionary discussions again, and I told him “no, not at this time,” and why and he accepted that. He asked if I’d be open to having a blessing and I told him no, and he said that that was okay.  He asked me if it was okay for him to bear his testimony to me, and given the respectful nature in which I’d been treated, agreed to this.

We ended things with a handshake and a statement of, “if you feel ready ask questions again, please come back and we can chat.”

I have no intention of “re-investigating” the church (in the spiritual sense, I will likely do some further historical probing). Still, I really appreciated his manner; it’s a massive weight off my shoulders as I consider continuing to attend church on Sunday to support my wife in managing the kids there.

I was  caused to think “It may be loathsome, but if I don't want to be a hypocrite than I have no choice but to face my long-suppressed doubts.” 6 months of honest self analysis and objective study later, I find myself a Full Time Missionary who has become completely, 100%, disillusioned to the teachings of the church.

Thanks for the discussion folks.  It's obvious that there are tons of people willing to help out when/if needed.  We'll just have to discuss further how to get these resources in front of the missionaries that need help.

There is a story about a girl who wakes up while her dad is removing a tooth from under her pillow and depositing a dollar.  Rather than realizing that the tooth fairy isn't real the girl comes to the conclusion that the tooth fairy is real and that her father is the tooth fairy.  

During the podcast Ira Glass says two things ( [link to the transcript](http://www.thisamericanlife.org/radio-archives/episode/188/transcript) ): 

&gt;children have to make logical inferences all the time, based on the data that they do have 

and

&gt;kids take a perfectly logical premise, and go through a series of perfectly logical deductions, that lead to perfectly incorrect conclusions 

If observe your father taking your tooth while also assuming that the tooth fairy must be real inferring that your father is the tooth fairy is a totally logical.  However, as you get older you realize that isn't realistic for your father to be the tooth fairy; therefor concluding that the tooth fairy isn't real becomes the more logical conclusion.  Basically the faulty conclusions drawn by children are the result of faulty or incomplete data.

I feel that this is exactly what is going on with TBMs and EXMos.  TBMs live in the world where they KNOW the church is true, and therefor any data they receive must be interpreted in that context.  This is why mormons love ideas like: dinosaur bones are left over from previous worlds, or that evolution only happend AFTER the garden of eden.

-----

Here is my argument that forces one to one of two conclusions

**Conclusions**

[A] The prophets are not divinely inspired when claiming that 8 is the age of accountability.

or

[B] Mormons are bait-and-switching their children when they baptize them.

-----

**Given**

[1] Revelation states that 8 is the age of accountability at which one may join the church.

[2] Prospect Members must be Baptized and Confirmed as members of the church in order to join.

[3] Prospect Members must have Faith and Repent before being Baptized.

[4] Repentance is changing your actions to conform with commandments.

[5] Faith is the active following of commandments without proof of god's existence.

[6] In order to follow the commandments, one must know and fully understand them.

[7] The Law of Chastity is a commandment that is agreed to at baptism.

[8] The Law of Chastity forbids sexual acts such as: masturbation; sexual intercourse outside of marriage; parasexual activities outside of marriage, such as oral sex, anal sex, petting, necking; homosexual acts of sex; beastiality.

[9] In order to understand the Law of Chastity, one must understand male and female genitals, sexual attraction, sexual arousal, orgasms, sperm, eggs, and pregnancy.

[10] Baptism is a covenant to follow all commandments for the rest of one's life.

-----

**Arguments**

[11] In order to join the church, one must be at least 8 years old^[1] and understand the gospel^[2][3][4][5][6][7][8][9] and must be willing to commit for life^[10].

[12] If a member does not think that an 8-year-old is capable of understanding [9], then they cannot understand [8], and therefore cannot comply with [7], [6], [5], [4], [3], [2], and therefore is a denial of [1], the divine inspiration of prophets. Therefore, Conclusion [A].

[13] If a member does not think that an 8-year-old is capable of understanding [9], but still think that they should continue with the baptism and will ""explain it to them when they are older,"" then they are forbidding [6], and are truly lying to their children, and forcing them into a lifelong commitment^[10] to something they never agreed to. Therefore, Conclusion [B].

First off.. I am 60 years of age. I was born into a very strict Mormon family. I have not been active in the church since I had a choice to make in the matter..

but I am unusual... I have NEVER given my ""testimony"". Not ever. Not even one time. Once you read about my background you will wonder why.. to this day I still do.

here is some background.

All of my relatives are Mormon My great grandfather on my mother's side was a polygamist. My other great grandfather followed Joseph Smith from New York to Salt Lake City. 

I have two brothers who have both been on Missions.. and are currently active. One is a bishop. The other is a Stake Missionary.

My parents went on FIVE Missions. That's right.. FIVE. Including Temple Square and the Phillipines. 

I am the only ""non-believer"" in my family that I am aware of. 

I can recall at an early age that I disliked going to church. Don't ask me why, I have no idea. I remember being in priesthood class and the instructor asking every man in the room to raise his hand who was going on a mission. I didn't raise mine. Again, I have no idea why.  I was age 12 at the time.

We used to sit in mutual, and they would start the ""testimony"" line where everyone in a row would stand up and bear their testimony. Like little soldiers. It would come down the line to me.. and I would sit silent.  After an excruciating amount of time went by, the person to my right would finally stand up.

So for some odd reason I will never be able to explain, I was different. I have never stood up and given my testimony.

So here fellow Redditors.. is .. my first testimony.

I know that Joseph Smith was a fraud. I am totally convinced he was not a prophet. I believe with all my heart that he made everything up. I know that Thomas Monson is not a prophet, but just a man. I know that the Mormon church is not true. I know that God did not invent man, but that man invented God. 
And I say these things in the name of science, and reason. AMEN.

And that is my testimony.

Most of us like hot dogs, they are cheap, tasty, and easy. We started eating them at a young age, and most everyone we know eats them too. We've all heard rumors that if you really knew how hot dogs were made you wouldn't eat them anymore. Most of us choose to ignore this and put it out of our mind. We are afraid to learn more because we sort of know that we'll either need to stop eating hot dogs or at least our enjoyment of them will be diminished. Ignorance is bliss. 

Some of us build up the courage to read a [book](http://www.amazon.com/Eating-Animals-ebook/dp/B002SSBD6W) or [two](http://www.amazon.com/Love-Dogs-Pigs-Wear-Cows/dp/1573245054/ref=zg_bs_14454_20) or watch a [video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2NzUm7UEEIY) or [two(NSFW)](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ykTH_b-cXyE). After being exposed to the whole story our ignorance is lost and it can never be regained. We are then forced to make an uncomfortable choice between rejecting the practice or continuing it with a tainted perspective. Apologist will offer some explanations, but they can not change what it is fundamentally.  

Hot dogs may not be a good analogy for you personally, but I'm sure you can think of another example of where you intentionally avoid learning the truth in order to feel comfortable with your choices. Like purchasing clothing or electronics likely manufactured in sweat shops or learning about your direct impact on the environment.

Here's the story: My TBM folks were having a reunion party at their house in Payson, UT. Some TBM family, some exmos, and some nevermos. I'm exmo. So I'm half joking with my TBM sister, who has told me in the past that she loves it when I ""get in trouble"" because it makes her feel better, that I'm going to stash some beer in a cooler around the corner of the house for the non-members. I can tell that she takes me seriously and that the gears are turning in her head, so I play it up like I'm all set on doing it. 

The day of the reunion I'm hanging out, drinking from my red cup like everyone else. Suddenly my Dad rushes over and snatches my cup away from me and peers inside . . . to see nothing more than cool, crisp water. ""You need a drink?"" I ask innocently. He just gives me a suspicious look, hands me my cup, and walks away. 

They think I'm some kind of big drunk because I left tscc, but the truth is I don't drink more than a beer every now and then and can certainly enjoy myself without while in another's home. It's obviously a way bigger deal to them than it is for me.

TL;DR: Tried to catch me riding dirty at the family reunion, made them look silly.

I sat down with him and just flat out said ""I'm an atheist and want to be released from my callings"".  

I ended up talking to him for an hour and a half.  He understandably tried to help me realize the error of my ways by using anecdotal evidence of how others have felt the spirit so I should just believe them.  He didn't want to release me from teaching because ""teaching is where you gain a testimony"".  I told him it was lying, unethical and not fair to anyone, and he eventually agreed.  He wanted to set up a group of guys that I could meet with weekly to read and discuss the BOM, I told him that if that happened I would not hold back my opinions and would speak openly about how I think the book is a sham and present the evidence to back that up, he agreed that was not a good idea.  

I really don't understand how the solution to the ""problem"" of disbelief is always to read more, pray more, have more church callings, etc. frankly, thats what got me here in the first place.

All in all it went well.  He's only been in for 2 weeks, baptism by fire I guess.  It feels good though, I feel relief more than anything.  It feels great to not have to pretend anymore.

**1.** At agge 14 I wrote a long email with my testimony and sent it out to all of my close friends asking them to pray and read the Book of Mormon. 

**2.** Went on a ""Book of Mormon Tour"" in Mexico and Guatemala for 3 weeks because I wanted to see the Book of Mormon lands. Plus I got to meet a famous Mormon author on the tour.

**3.** At 16 I dumped a girl because she wasn't Mormon.

**4.** I stopped hanging out with my best friend (at 17) because he was ""going down the wrong path."" This is the hardest for me to look back on because he was going through a dark time in his life and I just abandoned him.

**5.** At age 15 I had plastered the old school ""[Mormon ads](http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_shPMNfINMMc/St5v03RMNjI/AAAAAAAAAA0/yHVPusgg6Co/s400/cutting+remarks.jpg)"" all over my ceiling, asked only for a painting of Jesus for my birthday, and had a huge map of the proposed BOM cities on my wall. One time the missionaries were over and they said that my room was worse than a missionaries....

**6.** I turned down sex with at least 5 different girls from 16 - 24. This one *actually* may be the one I regret the most...

I of course posted that I was engaged on facebook, we changed our ""status"", put a picture of the proposal as my facebook profile picture, you know the whole 9 yards.  Both my brother and sister deleted me off facebook because they didn't want their friends to see my profile picture of a guy proposing to another guy, and not one of my family members gave a congradulations.  We got married last May, being nice I invited everyone to the ceremony (we can't legally be married in my state), and of course didn't get one card, present, or person besides my mom to come.  What did I expect right?

Fast forward to today.  My cousin gets engaged, she's 4 years younger than me.  She's marrying a non-member marine who seems like a really nice guy.  He has already told her though that he will never join the church and never be married in the temple, which she is evidently ok with.  Now on their profile picture of their engagement and their status change, everyone in my family is saying ""oh congratulations, I'm so happy for you!""  and one of my aunts even said ""oh your going to be the first grandkid to get married!  that's so exciting!"".  My mom and siblings have even both commented.  

This just pisses me the fuck off.  In my eyes, what she's doing and what I did weren't that different.  We both aren't going to be married in the temple, we are both giving up our religious believes for what we feel is right, but because of the fact that my SO is the same sex as me, I don't even get one ounce of recognition for my happiness... but she does.

It was my birthday today, and after years of change, exploration, and too many cumulative experiences to mention,  I sat with my father and returned missionary brother as we all tipped our beer glasses and warmly, simply celebrated.  It was a beautiful feeling to finally have a beer with my dad, and I count it as more a patriarchal rite of passage than any religious nonsense I experienced in the church. 

EDIT:  My reasoning for posting this was simply because we often get negative in this particular forum, I didn't mention the ugly, horrible portions for a reason.

By saying ""I do not accept the claims of the church,"" you have made a much simpler statement. When you say this, a mormon may ask why. This is good! The most important path to finding truth is through questioning, and the latter statement may well put a mormon on the path of questioning.

They were sure that their financial success came from giving a significant portion of their income to the church.

Of course, I knew it was rubbish. There are plenty of tithe-paying members in the church who can barely put food on the table. Utah is rampant with bankruptcies and debt. It seemed to be simple confirmation bias of people attributing success to paying tithing and failure to anything else.

But, however anecdotal it is, I have seen a noticeable difference in my finances since I stopped paying tithing. In fact, the change occurred precisely when I stopped donating. I'm aware that correlation does not prove causation, but it's difficult to write it off as coincidental.

I'm still not really out, I even went to church this Sunday.  But I'm feeling the need to get out.

Warning: This has turned into a an enumerated rant.  

1.  Anything to do with the second coming of Jesus.  They've been predicting it for years, and after many overreaching predictions finally have landed on the very safe 'Not in our lifetime', or 'We don't know'.

2.  Brigham Young was a prophet of God.  Joseph Smith and the BoM had me going for a while, but Brigham always kinda stunk to me.  Maybe I should have been born RLDS.

3.  The church will fill the whole earth.  I can thank my BYU Mission Prep professor for debunking that.  The numbers don't lie, netting 300,000 a year isn't gonna cut it.

4.  The Priesthood can actually heal people or move mountains.  The pioneers could have used some mountain moving.  Wyoming blows.

5.  The temple ceremony is inspired of god.  That thing was creepy the first time(Can you say violated with oil?) and most every time since then.

6.  We are the valiant, chosen generation for the 'last days'.  Again,  they've been singing that song for years.  People that have been told that are **dying** now.

7.  The world is getting worse and more filled with sin.  I kinda feel like people have always been huge dicks to each other.  If anything this is one of the best times for humanity, or at least parts of it.

8.  The celestial kingdom is where we all should want to go.  Most the people I run into that claim to want go to the celestial kingdom are kind of cunts.

9.  Jesus cares about us individually and answers all our prayers.  Again, this falls under the wow the world is pretty screwed up category.  Jesus is ignoring **lots** of people!

10.  Fasting helps and temple prayer rolls can give you an extra boost in the miracle queue.  That prayer is creepy(and pretty sexist) and I'm hungry goddamnit.

11.  The Church is right for everybody.  With 15 white dudes at the head, most of whom grew up in the western US, the policies and decisions mostly align with white American Culture, rather than anything resembling a universal approach.

12.  The Spirit is a real thing that actually does stuff.  I've heard it described in exact opposition to other descriptions of it.  Basically, its just whatever anyone needs/wants it to be.

13.  Homosexuality is a sin.  God is cruel if that's the case.  This epiphany only hit me earlier this year when a guy said he struggles with same-gender attraction over the pulpit.  He is basically doomed to a life of loneliness under current church policies and he is actually subjecting himself to it.  So heart wrenching.

14.  Satan is trying to get us to sin.  Just psychology.  ""If the Devil doesn't like it he can sit on a tack"" is the intended response to this claim.",,False,self,t5_2r0gj,False,,,True,t3_1k9mrq,http://www.reddit.com/r/exmormon/comments/1k9mrq/things_i_doubt_even_while_an_active_member_of_the/,

Never have I met someone like him. So I decided to share a few of his Gem's with you all. Enjoy!

(On Evolution:)

Me: Today we learned about evolution, our teacher was talking about how humans have evolved from many ancestor species. How does that work with the Adam and Eve story?

Him: Well, you should go back and tell him that he looks like he evolved from an ape. We didn't come from chimps! (Exact quote)

(On Homosexuals:)

Me: So gay marriage, why do we oppose it?
Him: Gay tendencies are like alcohol, the more you do it, the more you become addicted to it. Everyone has to choose to know a man in the first place to get those tendencies. Hey class, what is grosser: Two guys, or a guy and an animal? (exact quote)

(Randomly in the middle of class talking about Jesus): Hey class, did you know that expert historians examined the book of Abraham that Joseph translated and said that it was a perfect translation that was 100 percent accurate?

(On blacks holding the priesthood): A lot of you have asked why blacks couldn't hold the priesthood, and the answer is this: I don't know, and no one does, but there are black people in our church who don't care  so why should you?

(On polygamy): Joseph Smith was given special permission from god to take several wives. People try to make it seem like a big deal, but it is not at all. 

(On modesty): Women, don't dress like you are planning on working the corner. One of my old friends was also seminary teacher, and a girl walked into his classroom with a tank top and shorts that were far too short on. He stared her down and said: ""You look like a hooker"". She left the classroom. Oh man, I wish I was as brave as him. (actual quote)

I went to my father for advice on the matter.  My mom and dad had struggled a ton when I was younger and now have the happiest marriage ever, so I figured he would have some good advice.

Rather then getting some good pointers on being less selfish, putting your wife first, etc., his simple answer was go back to church.  Sparing you the long details, he basically said that the lord would bless me for being faithful and active.  I asked him if that was it, and he said yes.  The Lord would take care of everything if I served him.  He also threw in the importance of tithing, AKA buying blessings.

At this point I was desperate to save our marriage, and going back seemed simple enough, so I went back to church with full force.  6 months of both feet in the water and my marriage was on its last thread.  *FYI: At this point I was doubting, but not convinced the Church was a lie.*

Then I decided to use my brain, rather then faith, and I started thinking logically.  I sat down with her and had a deep, 'difficult to hear' conversation with her about my flaws and issues.  I then took those into heart and divided them into things I could change, and things that I couldn't.  I went to a doctor who prescribed me some mild Anti-Anxiety meds and 'Magically' I was a happier person.  And my flaws started to minimize.  1.5 years later our marriage is better then it has ever been, and we haven't stepped foot in church since.

I find it funny how many people rely on God, or blessings to fix problems, rather then stepping up to fix them themselves.  As of now, I do believe that there is a 'God', but I do not believe he interacts with Humanity, and if he does, we could not know this through observation.  I assume he knows we are smart enough to figure things out on our own. (I'm an Agnostic Theist)

*I would like to note that I respect and love my father a ton.  I just wish he could see that problems are solved by those that step up to fix them, and not God.*

The bishop gave the opening prayer without asking me to, so that didn't go according to plan. He asked me where I felt that I was in my preparations for the temple and the priesthood. I paused to gather my thoughts, and I swear I could see his heart drop into his shiny black shoes. I brought up several issues that I have with TSCC, including the following:

* In the old testament, there is a passage that vividly describes a temple that will be built in the latter days, but this temple has a altar for for animal sacrifice. I thought we didn't do that. His response: It's all symbolism. Too bad the scripture gives pretty explicit detail on the design of the altar. I can't seem to find it, if anyone could exercise some google-fu on my behalf that would be awesome.
* The facsimiles. I said the word facsimile, and before I could continue, he started saying that ""we don't have all of the documents that the BoA was translated from."" Didn't let me get a word in for a couple minutes. I explained that my issue was that they were partial fabrications and the imagery was mislabeled. His response: It doesn't pertain to exaltation, so it doesn't matter. Really? it discredits JS's authority as a prophet, so I'd say it matters.
* The spirit being awfully similar to human emotions, and that it is unable to be measured. He threw what I said out the window and compared the spirit to God's wifi into our minds and hearts. One problem: wifi has measurable effects on it's surroundings. Don't try computer analogies on a CS student. Just because you don't understand the internet doesn't mean that I don't.

There were others, but those were the major talking points. I played the Occam's Razor card a couple times, to which he offered no rebuttal. In the end, he passed off my concerns as issues of faith, and told me to put off the natural man (aka, science, logic, and cited history) and stop doing research at websites like mormonthink. He bore his testimony (typical fallback of a religious person backed into a corner) and promised me that if I devoted myself to studying the Book of Mormon for 30 days and prayed sincerely about it, I would be told it is true. I told him I'd spent nine months studying and praying at BYU and it got me nowhere, and he was now telling me to pray until I got the ""right"" (read: his) answer. He said that because the bishop promised me it will happen it HAS to be true. I'm going to take his challenge, just to show him that priesthood promises mean nothing.

I came home and talked to my mom about it. She was visibly upset, but loving and accepting. Suprisingly, she was shocked. I guess that a parent's desire to see their children become what they want them to is too strong. She said that she knew about a lot of the issues that I have with the church, but still has a testimony. I don't know how. A lot of it clearly shows that Joseph Smith didn't have a prophetic bone in his body. But she made it clear that she loves me for whoever I discover myself to be. Definitely a better turnout than some of the stories I've heard, though mine is far from over.",,False,self,t5_2r0gj,False,,,True,t3_1hlfig,http://www.reddit.com/r/exmormon/comments/1hlfig/returning_and_reporting/,

I pretend to be a ""less active"" member and they pretend to believe me. It is pretty clear that I have left the church and have no intention of going back, but we can put on a show for appearance sake. For years now I have been invited to temple weddings, or to join in prayer circles (baby blessings and ordinations). And for years I have had to politely decline. So far we have avoided ""the talk."" On my part I am just waiting out my parents mortality. Both are in their 80s and in ill health. I can allow them the illusion that I may return.

From time to time I still get the occasional ""I pray for you"" or some comment observing my supposedly fallen state... just like I just got. I have been dealing with cancer for six months, and recently got the good news, cancer free. So I celebrated by hitting a hot spring spa with some friends. On the way up to the mountains, I also called my parents to let them know as well. The connection was bad (mountains), but the gist of the moment for me was shared.

Then I got a call back. My mom was really upset. She was ""very sad and disappointed that I would call her drunk."" Of course I hadn't had a drink in weeks. I'm not much of a drinker. But she wouldn't believe me. Evidently no one can just be elated and happy that a pending death sentence had been overcome; no I must have been drunk. There is no such thing as *joie de vivre*. The disdain and bitterness in her voice really took me by surprise.

Sometimes I just have to admit it hurts. My mother thinks I a monster of some sort. And I was not exaggerating in the title. WoW violations are about as bad a thing as she can imagine. Never mind that I am a reasonably successful professional in my 40s. Never mind that to most of my friends I'm all but a teetotaling prude. Nope, in my mom's eyes I am secretly living a life of constant bacchanal.

1360212403.0,93,self.exmormon,181q5x,I came out to my ward and this is how it went down.,109,16,40,http://www.reddit.com/r/exmormon/comments/181q5x/i_came_out_to_my_ward_and_this_is_how_it_went_down/,"So, before I start, I would like to say who I am. I'm 16, a ""black sheep"", I live in the conservative part of Oklahoma, and I'm not in the best place right now. I've always been the outspoken one at my ward. Ive had ver far left opinions about everything. I'm very ""not Mormon"" if that makes any sense. I'm really good friends with the youth of the church and I found a small part of the youth that is slipping from the church. They find the church very corrupt and controlling. We all sort of lean on each other for friend ship. I just thought I should throw that out there. Okay, back to the story.

Anyway, it all started during fast and testimony meeting, I decided that it was a good time to tell the ward about my sexuality. I came out to my parents the following week and they were (are) still coming to terms with that. I told them that I was telling the ward on Sunday and they agreed to support me. I went up there and said something along the lines of, ""Hello everyone, I know I never go up here and speak, ever, but I have something to tell you all. For a long time I've been keeping a secret. I'm gay. I hope this doesn't change the way you view me as a person. I just needed to get this off of my chest. Thank you for listening. Goodbye."" The reactions were of shock, some of ""OH MY GOD I KNEW IT"", and some of just disappointment. After it ended people came up to me and said that they love me and accept me for who I am.

 Sunday school was interesting. Our teacher is notorious for being very opinionated and a hardcore conservative. For weeks we've been learning about the atonement, but instead he changed it to ""Why gays are running America and the gospel of the church."" He practically goes on a rant about how being gay is immoral and they just need to turn to god and become straight. Everyone in the class had a look of ""holy shit, what the hell is wrong with him"" and he had this shit eating grin that was like i hope you're offended. I just wanted to punch him. 

Aronic priesthood went better than I expected. I walked into the room where we go before they separate us into our individual classes and everyone was staring at me like I just killed a kitten. The ward president saw that everyone was staring at me and decided to tell a story before we began. It was about his brother who came out of the closet when he was about my age and everyone condemned him for it. He was a social outcast after that and one night his brother attempted to kill himself. He was the one that found him. His brother had a note in his hand and it said,""I'm sorry that I'm not perfect. Forgive me."" Luckily, his brother survived and now is married to his husband of 8 years and has 2 kids. He said that its okay to be gay and even though the church says otherwise god still loves them. After that, everything felt better. I feel like I have a weight lifted off of my shoulders. I feel happy.

Thank you for listening. :)

He is one of the only true friends I’ve made since college.  I have close friends from earlier in my life, but he is one of only three people I truly considered an adult friend.  In case you haven’t noticed yet, [the older you get, the harder it becomes to make real friends](http://www.nytimes.com/2012/07/15/fashion/the-challenge-of-making-friends-as-an-adult.html?_r=0).  The reason it hurt to see him again was because he dissolved our friendship because I left TSCC. 
 
We met the Sunday after moving in to their ward. We spent two hours getting to know each other as our then 9-month old's played on the floor together on the foyer floor.  Coincidentally, our wives sat next to each other during RS and hit it off, too.  It was the beginning of a beautify friendship.  After we played a round golf later that week, we agreed it felt just like [this](http://i.imgur.com/EUmmc.gif).

Over the next 4 years, we became close friends.  We liked the same types of books and shows.  We had well informed political discussions.  We had the same sense of humor.  We respected and trusted each other. He taught me about road biking. I taught him about open-water swimming. I taught him about plumbing and roofing.  He got me started in the stock market.  We trained for and raced our first triathlon together.  He cried to me when he was scared his wife's near-impossible-to-diagnoses illness would cut her life short.  We had great conversations about almost everything.   But the true biscuit wheels on our gravy train was that our wives and kids got along great, too.  We vacationed with them.  We babysat for each other.  We were each others emergency contacts.  We joked about our oldest kids growing up and marrying each other.  What we had was rare, and seeing him again was like seeing an ex-girlfriend I still had unresolved feelings for.

He’s a true believer, through and through.  He never understood my crisis of faith. He loved being mormon, and did his best to listen to my issues, but never seemed to quite hear what I was saying.  He knew it was happening, but I don't think I ever effectively articulated how far down the rabbit hole I had gone.  We moved a couple of miles away 3 years ago, right as my faith crisis came to a head. My exit from TSCC happened when we weren't attending the same ward, and I wasn't talking with anyone except my wife about it.  We remained close, though not as close as before.  Both he and I were transitioning jobs (and I was dealing with the trauma of unplugging from the church) and just didn't have much free time for each other.

Well, last summer he asked me to stand in the circle to bless his newborn. With a heavy heart, I declined and explained that I hadn’t believed in Mormon theology for over a year now, and it would be dishonest of me to pretend otherwise.  We attended the blessing to show support on this special day for them, but I could tell at the luncheon afterwards that things were different between us.  Over the next several weeks, he made it clear through is passive-aggressive behaviors that our families were done being friends.  He didn't show up for bike rides. He didn't return calls.  He basically froze me out. It sucked. But, a lot of stuff sucks when leaving the church, and I chalked it up to the already high price I was paying to be authentic and true to myself.
 
Fast-forward to last night and my family is walking out of the gym, just as his family is walking in.  This is the first face-to-face contact we’d had in almost a year.  We had awkward small talk in that awkward breezeway where they keep the rock salt and snow shovels in the winter.  Toward the end, our wives start coordinating a family dinner.  I see him tense up.  I look right at him and said, “I really miss you guys.  It would be great to catch up and clear the air.”  He remained stone-faced, reached out and shook my hand and said, “We’ll see. Nice to see you again. Take care.” As he was rounding up his kids to leave, I tried one more time and said, “Hey, Wife doesn’t want to see the new Superman movie.  There is an 11:00 PM showing this Friday. Want to come with me?”  He said no thanks, claiming he had a lot to do on Saturday and didn’t want to be up too late.  I could tell by the sideways look his wife was giving him that his excuse was BS. Plus, midnight movies on Friday used to be a regular thing for us.  They went in, we went out, and just like that, they were gone from  our lives again.
 
Compound that interaction with the fact my wife’s been super busy (and therefore extra ornery) these past couple of weeks, and I'm straight-up lonely…This is not an emotion I feel very often, and for that I’m thankful.  But man, do I wish he and his family were still a part of my life.",,False,self,t5_2r0gj,False,,,True,t3_1gajif,http://www.reddit.com/r/exmormon/comments/1gajif/but_the_scar_that_scar_remains/,

This is how it went down today.

The meeting went pretty well. He mostly just listened. I wanted to keep it it short and simple but I couldn't help sharing. I'm paraphrasing and things may be out of order, but this is the gist of the conversation:

Me: &lt;Standard opening prayer&gt;

Bishop: How can I help?

Me: ""I need to be released"" 

Bishop: ""Why?""

Me: ""I don't believe in the doctrine anymore""

Bishop: ""Which part?""

Me: ""The list is a mile long, but fundamentally I don't believe the spirit can be used to discern truth""

Bishop: ""So are you just going to use logic?"" (like this is a naughty word)

Me: ""I think that may be an oversimplification, but yeah. Given what I know from psychology, personal experiences and experiences of those I know, I know the mind can create powerful emotions, hallucinations, schizophrenia, etc. so emotions cannot be a reliable way to discern truth."" 

Bishop: ""Have you ever had a spiritual experience?""

Me: ""Yes, I can think of a few experiences in my life that I considered spiritual but I've also had spiritual experiences when watching movies""

Bishop: ""Well, was there truths in that movie?"" 

Me: ""Maybe. I believe these emotions are a manifestation of my subconscious, so I expect it to reinforce things that I believe or give me promptings about what I should do."" 

Bishop: ""When did you stop praying?""

Me: ""About a month ago. I believe prayer can be very therapeutic but I don't believe prayers are answered?""

Bishop: ""Have you ever had a prayer answered?"" 

Me: ""I've prayed for something to happen and it did, but I don't consider a confirmation that the prayer worked. You know there are a lot of prayers everyday that are unanswered.

Bishop: ""Do you believe in God?""

Me: ""The church does have a lot of positive influenced on youth. It had a lot of positive influences on my youth. However the church can also be harmful. What if my son turns out to be gay? The church would be very harmful. Another example is masturbation, I don't want my children to feel guilty about something that's normal. I believe telling your children that something is sinful can actually encourage the behavior"" 

Bishop: ""You don't want your children to feel guilty?""
Me: ""I do if they did something to harm someone else. I don't want them to feel guilty about archaic beliefs concerning human nature.""

Me: ""We could talk all day, but just a couple of my other concerns that the church is doing today or recently is the treatment of homosexuals and blacks, and it's history with polygamy. I can't accept this. Another concern I have is the church's discouragement of interracial marriage, especially since we are both in a interracial marriages"" ;)

Bishop: ""I haven't head that [about interracial marriage]""

Me: ""It's in the Aronic Priesthood Manual 3""

Bishop: ""I'm concerned about you""

Me: ""I understand. You should be [given what you believe]. But we are not changing, well that's not true. We are thinking for ourselves for the first time so some things will and have changed. For example, we've decided to be vegetarian because we believe its not right to kill animals for pleasure. We still feel we are good people."" 

Bishop: ""There are vegetarian Mormons""

Me: ""True, but I think this is a contradiction given what the scriptures say and the fact the church owns a steer farms and hunting preserves. It's not my place to tell people not to eat meat but I'm not comfortable with my church supporting it""

Bishop: ""How does your wife feel?""

&lt;Conversation about my wife&gt; (She was not comfortable coming in person so she wrote a letter that I gave him)

Bishop: ""Are you resigning your records?""

Me: ""Not today, but maybe one day""

Bishop: ""Will you continue attending?""

Me: ""We will take it week by week"" (probably never)

Bishop: ""Do you want home teachers to come""

Me: ""That's OK if they make an appointment first. Unannounced visits are not welcomed""

Bishop: ""I give you the challenge to continue to pray and ask for promptings. When you feel promptings during the day follow those promptings you'll be amazed by the effects. You can use the scientific method""

Me: ""That's fair, I can try that. However, how will I know that the promptings are from the spirit or my subconsciousness?""

Bishop: ""At this stage you probably can't, but overtime you will. I hope that we can continue to be friends, we really like your family.""

Me: ""Of course, I don't want to cut off anyone in the church. I actually expect it will be the opposite.""

Bishop: ""Well, we'll get you released right away""

Me: ""I feel bad dumping this on you. I really like you and your family. They are great.""

Bishop: ""That's what I'm here for"" :(

Bishop: &lt;Closing prayer about me&gt;

My mother died suddenly when I was eleven. My dad had been a seminary teacher and principal for his entire adult life.  Grief stricken and left with 5 kids, my Dad was foolishly counseled by church leaders that it would not be unwise to re-marry quickly. So he did. Six months after my mother's death, he marries a lady none of us really know anything about. 

Long story short: she's bi-polar, almost schizophrenic, emotionally abusive, materialistic, bat-shit insane. He divorces her after 3 terrible years that we had to endure because he was counseled to avoid divorce at all cost. But, one day she says some terrible things (really really terrible things) and kicks us all out onto the street .

and. . . he loses his job for being divorced. After teaching seminary for nearly 25 years, the guy has no clue how the actual world of employment works. He has no life-lines. The church, our community, they all turn their backs on him. Not to mention the financial crises put a damper on any job prospects he might have found. 

That was nearly ten years ago, and he's not had a decent job since. 

But it doesn't end there: the church promised him that they'd give him a shot at being a teacher once more if he re-entered into a stable marriage. So he went ahead and got jumped into another marriage, thinking he might get his job back. Turns out they made him start at square one, as a student teacher. And, even after being told he did great with student teaching, the church refuses to hire him (AKA they led him on for years, only to refuse to hire him because he is still tainted by ever being divorced). He spent years of his life on the hope that he could teach again, only to be shut-down. 

Oh, and then his newest wife kicks him out of her house because she wants a husband who makes more money. 

Soooo now the man is living in a hotel with no job and no money. He barely knows how to work a computer - he missed the rise of the internet age because he was living in his comfortable cocoon as a seminary principal with a secretary who did all his typing for him. 

But that's not all! Of course, the man is still a devout Mormon. Which, in some ways, is commendable. In other ways, it just really makes me angry. 

Of course, all of this played a role in my leaving the church, but I can honestly say that it is not the main reason I left. I left because the church did not offer me happiness. It made me self-loathing, guilty, and almost psychotic with how much I poured over the contradictory doctrine in my mind. I began my process of leaving at 16, am now a self-sufficient college senior joining the Peace Corps, and feeling great about life (except for my dad's shitty situation, of course). 

Anyways, that's it. That's the story of how the LDS church cares for its own. ",,False,self,t5_2r0gj,False,,,True,t3_17hjps,http://www.reddit.com/r/exmormon/comments/17hjps/my_unemployed_widower_exseminary_teaching_father/,

I laughed, said I didn't care, and to just excommunicate me and promptly hung up.

As such, the internet was my only source of information. Among such knowledge was learning that girls do not also have penises, one does not pee into a woman's butt to make babies, and how to masturbate.

Fast forward a bit to the future. I'm on Wikipedia, and I stumble upon the article for ""Orgasm"" and read that after one does this, one generally feels tired, or sleepy. Now, I had fapped before this, (and feverishly repented after each time,) but never for any other reason than feels good, man.

Since I *was* having some trouble falling asleep before 12:30 for several months, reasoned that of course it would be okay to release the dragon during the wee hours if it meant I could sleep easier.

I prayed to God with this in mind, and said ""If I'm not supposed to masturbate, then make a purple duck appear in my dreams tonight.""
Now, I know what you're thinking: ""Leiden, you can't be that specific! You can't pray for a million dollars and expect to just get it!""

But come on. One of God's children is legitimately asking a question. God has been known to talk to people through their dreams, so it's not like I'm asking for something he doesn't normally do. Just show the image of a purple cartoon duck in my brain for a little while to let me know.

We both decided that the marriage and our children were more important and that we would stick it out no matter what.  We both love each other and have always had a great relationship apart from this.

I've never really tried to convert her, but I did bring up some of my bigger doubts from time to time (e.g. Polygamy, Book of Abraham, etc).  I continue to go to church to support her.  A couple weeks ago, out of the blue, she opens up to me about her own doubts and tells me she's going to start doing her own research.  She has a degree in history and is trained to find and distinguish credible sources.

It's at this point that I'm really excited but almost afraid to hope.  I had basically resigned myself to being forever misunderstood by the most important person in my life.  Within 24 hours her belief falls completely apart.  She reads the first hand accounts from the wives of Joseph Smith.  She reads all about the Book of Abraham and the Kinderhook plates.  Within a week, we call the bishop over and tell him we are no longer participating in the ward.  Within another week we have told our families (much drama there, but thats another story).

Just had to get this out to someone who could appreciate it.  I am so unbelievably happy now!  The ironic thing is that even though we are less alike in beliefs than ever before (she still believes in god while I am an atheist), we feel more unified and closer than ever before.

- there is a god
- he is the creator of this world
- he is all powerful (omnipotent), all knowing (omniscient), and all present (omnipresent)
- god loves all of his human children and would like them to follow his plan so they can return to him after they die, i.e. god would like everyone on earth to believe in and practice Mormonism
- Mormonism is the only path to the highest form of salvation
- to a lesser extent, other forms of Chrisitanity are a path to salvation
- but definitely not Islam, Buddhism, Hinduism, or non-belief (these other religions/beliefs comprise 68% of the Earth's population)
- god's plan only manages to get 32% of the entire human population to believe in some form of Christianity
- of that 32%, god can only manage to get 14 million people to be baptized as Mormons
- of that 14 million, god can only get about 50% to be active Mormons (some estimates say that there are only 4.5 - 5 million active Mormons)
- if we assume there are 7 million active Mormons (again that number may be too high), that means that god can only get 0.1% (one 10th of 1%) of the entire population of the planet to follow his one true religion/plan
So, an all powerful, all knowing, all present being, who created this world, and all the people in it, devised a plan (or accepted the one presented by 'his only begotten son' whatever that means) by which he can only achieve a 1/10th of 1% (0.001) effectiveness rate.

I am an ex-mo but still good friends with the RS President in my ward. She called me in panic because the missionaries got booted from the members home they were staying in. Not their own fault, just a situation came up. So since my husband and i are separated and I live in this large house alone I agreed to house them for a few days. Nice girls. One was 19 and had been in the mission for 4 weeks. Both from TBM families. 

My thoughts...I felt sorry for them. They had lives prior to this. They were in school, had boyfriends and enjoyed fun things. Now they were wearing clothing clearly they did not enjoy to wear. studied scriptures they did not want to do and had an attitude of enduring. The word that comes to mind is ""Stepford Wives"". So one evening when I got home from work we all began to talk. I shared some of my feelings about the treatment of women in the church and general thoughts on feminism. The topic came up because one sister said they weren't allowed to wear jeans on their P day. They didn't preach to me at all and the mission office was grateful to me for taking them in. They left me a note when they left thanking me for ""our discussions"". I hope I planted a seed about the disparity of women and men in the church and in religion in general.

EDIT: Update. After the sisters moved into their new place. They called and asked to come by. I thought they might start trying to get me to come back to church, but that didn't happen. They came over and just sat and talked about their lives outside of church and said they felt comfortable just being who they are with me and wished they still lived here, in my ex-mo home!!!

There is really the only one act in my entire 32 years that I regret and that I don't think I can ever make right. And I did it because I thought God would want me to.

---

**Backstory**

I come from a family of seven.

* Two older sisters (TBMs, went to BYU, now pumping out babies)
* Me, the middle child.
* A younger brother (TBM and a complete asshole with a bad temper)
* A younger sister (ex-Mormon, brilliant scientist and my best friend)

When my youngest sister was born my brother was terribly jealous of the attention she got. He tried to make her life miserable and as they both got older he would constantly tease her an fight with her. She always came to me to protect her.

She stopped believing in God fairly early, around age 10-13 it's hard to pin point. She got into all kinds of trouble and felt like the entire family was against her... except for me. I was the only person in the family she trusted because I was the brother who protected her.

I didn't know how bad things were between my parents and her until they hired some people to kidnap her in the middle of the night and fly her out to a correctional facility out in Utah. She wasn't 18 yet and had no legal recourse.

She survived it and came back as defiant as ever.

My parents were convinced my sister's soul was still in danger and they hired a detective to keep tabs on her.

---

**What I did eight years ago**

I installed a key logger on my sister's computer before she went to college. I thought I was helping... I thought God would want me to help my parents bring her back at all costs. They told me she was lying to them and they needed to keep tabs on her to protect her.

It kept a log of everything she typed and emailed it to my parents. She eventually figured it out, found a way to encrypt her computer so that the key logger was useless and then she managed to find all the logs as well as access all my Mother's correspondence with the private investigator.

(because as I said above, she's fucking brilliant)

But she doesn't know I was the one who put it there.

I have left the church since then (about 4 years ago). My wonderful little sister was supportive of me the whole way. She and her friends even got me drunk the first time and made sure I didn't do anything stupid. She's the best human being I know.

And she doesn't know I completely betrayed her trust because of an imaginary God.

I can never tell her. I can never forgive myself.

Why the fuck didn't I leave the church sooner? It brings me to tears just writing all this down.

In primary, when kids will still believe in anything, even Santa Claus, they're taught the stories as truth, nothing more complex than that. But once they get to be teenagers and start hitting the age when they question authority the tactics change.

Instead of focusing on the stories, it seems like a lot of the lessons are about how special each of the youth are. How they are a chosen generation sent to do special things. It sometimes seemed that a lot of ward and stake activities were built around giving the teenagers a chance to feel important and special. Basically to get them to stop asking questions by telling them how special they are within the framework of the Church. I mean, who wants to question someone who's telling them how awesome they are? Especially when you're a teenager and have self esteem issues.

After that the kids go off to college and suddenly, the you're special line stops. Instead they're taught about what their duty is to God. Go on a mission get married and have kids. It seems almost as if it's designed to raise people up not to question the system and then convince them to enter a more firm and entrapping system without thought. Once you're on your mission it becomes harder to leave. Once you've been married in the temple and have a young kid it's harder to leave. You don't want to get divorced because your spouse probably still believes, and you can't talk to them about your disbelief. And even if you both left the Church you'd be ostracized by your family and the community, and you don't want that kid that you love so much to grow being an outcast from family and friends.

&gt;Mormon 8:


&gt;36 And I know that ye do walk in the pride of your hearts; and there are none save a few only who do not lift themselves up in the pride of their hearts, unto the wearing of very fine apparel, unto envying, and strifes, and malice, and persecutions, and all manner of iniquities; and your churches, yea, even every one, have become polluted because of the pride of your hearts.

&gt;37 For behold, ye do love money, and your substance, and your fine apparel, and the adorning of your churches, more than ye love the poor and the needy, the sick and the afflicted.

&gt;38 O ye pollutions, ye hypocrites, ye teachers, who sell yourselves for that which will canker, why have ye polluted the holy church of God? Why are ye ashamed to take upon you the name of Christ? Why do ye not think that greater is the value of an endless happiness than that misery which never dies—because of the praise of the world?

He then linked to [this.](http://www.greaterthings.com/HVerlanAndersen/apostasy.htm)

It's a cultural thing. Mormons are taught that they are feeling the spirit when they feel a great deal of emotion, and that crying is an appropriate manifestation of said emotion. So, when a Mormon then feels this swell of emotion, s/he is likely to allow it to come out as tears. In some churches speaking in tongues is considered the appropriate expression of religious feeling, and so you see speaking in tongues. Others encourage a hearty ""amen"", and this is what you will hear. Those responses aren't fake. They are a learned response to a real feeling.

Part 2...,92,9,46,http://www.reddit.com/r/exmormon/comments/y8ecq/fuck_this_part_2/,"Today was the day my daughter was born. 8 lbs 5 oz of pure beauty and human potential. This is one of the happiest days of my life. I have the overwhelming sense that things will work out with my wife who is still TBM. I don't hold any ill will towards her, I love her and think she is the best person in my life.

I spent all day at the hospital with my wife, new daughter and 4 year old son. My TBM mother in law is going to stay the night with my wife while I have a boys night with my son. On the way to the hospital, my TBM MIL says ""thecoagulates, I don't want to ruffle any feathers or step over any bounds.... *BUT*..""

OH SHIT&gt;&gt;&gt; HERE WE GO.

Tells me that the things I have read are not the truth and told by people who want to bring down the church with unsubstantiated claims. They know they are lying. OK fine, I says, what have I been reading?

Well, I don't know.

So you're assuming.

Cue the waterworks.

""thecoagulates, you are breaking everyone's heart."" ""Is that a good enough reason to hold yourself to a belief? Am I not capable of reaching a conclusion? Am I not able to make a choice for myself?""

""Well, that's not what I'm saying.""
""Yes it is, it totally is.""
""Well you are headed for a miserable life""
""Yes because there are billions of miserable non-members.""

Few other things are exchanged and I tell her she is clearly overstepping her bounds and that this is entirely inappropriate. 

What happens next floors me:

""You will lose your family.""

me: ""FUCK YOU.""

Slam the car door shut (at this point we are at the front door of the hospital and my son is fast asleep after a long day cooped up in a hospital room. 

I have never been so bullied or harassed in my life. I went home and bawled. I never do that. All I could think about was my precious son and brand new daughter. What if they died right now? What if the car crashed? What if the body of my frail new daughter failed her? WHAT IF MY FAMILY WAS TAKEN AWAY?

Then what if someone desired that? What if it wasn't an accident or an act of fate/chance/whatever? What if someone really believed that? Well, I'll tell you: IT WOULD KILL ME INSIDE. I love my family, I love my wife. The Church does not have  monopoly or on a working marriage; nor is it a guarantee that a marriage will work. It is the individuals. It is the faith that two people have when they are in love. A love which is hard to define or measure.

**I WILL NOT GIVE UP MY CHILDREN. I WILL NOT GIVE UP MY FAITH IN MY WIFE. ALL THE FAITH I HAVE IN THIS WORLD IS IN HER. I BELIEVE IN HUMANKIND. I LOVE MY LIFE AND MY FAMILY, THEY ARE ALL I KNOW I HAVE.**

I'm burnt out, and ready to call it a day. Before I do, however, I figured I'd share a funny story to help everyone unwind.

I was 13. My father was my bishop. We lived in Virginia, and our YM/YW were planning a trip to the temple to perform baptisms for the dead. He interviewed me for recommend. He asked me if I masturbated. I’d never heard that word before, so I said “no”. My dad is a big joker. He loves trolling people. At the end of the interview, he said to me with that funny-guy smirk of his on his face, “Now you know, if you lied to me, the water in the temple baptismal font will turn black as soon as you touch it.” I was *pretty* sure he was kidding, but not 100% confident. What did I know about any of this stuff? I was 13 and this was my first worthiness interview and trip to the temple.

A few days later, I asked my 16 year-old sister how to kiss a girl. I had a school dance coming up, and wanted to bust a move on my crush, Kelly. My sister gave me some pointers, and told me practice on a pillow. I spent several hours in my room over the next couple of days making out with a pillow. I felt really silly doing it, but was convinced this practice would pay off when I amazed Kelly with a perfect kiss.

The following week, we began our 4 hour drive to the temple. We stopped for lunch, and one of the kids sitting at my table asked, “So, did the bishop as you guys if you masturbated. I don’t know what that is.” All of us were clueless except one boy who wisely explained, “Masturbating is when you pretend you’re with a girl, and that she is your girlfriend.”

My heart dropped! I had been masturbating with my kissing pillow! The water was going to turn black and everyone would know I was a liar and a pervert! I was sick to my stomach all the way to the temple, in the locker room, and while sitting on the bench waiting for my turn. When it was finally my turn, I didn’t know what to do. I couldn’t turn back, so I timidly walked up to the font and dipped my toe in. Of course, nothing happened, and I was so relieved! I was also confused, and had a follow-up conversation with my father that was very embarrassing for both of us.",,False,self,t5_2r0gj,False,,,True,t3_1inl2k,http://www.reddit.com/r/exmormon/comments/1inl2k/masturbation_and_baptisms_for_the_dead/,

Everyone: What is it, God?

God: I have a plan to turn all of you into a god, just like me. I call it The Plan of Salvation.

*Crowd erupts in applause*

God: Ahem. Ok, so here’s how the plan is going down, yo. Before you can be God’s you’ll need bodies. So, we’re going to create a planet for you to live on, where you’ll be born, raised and die. You’ll also have to choose the right.

Nephi: That’ll be easy. I always choose the right.

God: It won’t be easy. Satan will be there to tempt you.

Adam: Who’s Satan?

God: It’s Lucifer.

Lucifer: Me? What did I do?

God: It’s not what you did but what you will do. You’re going to rebel against my plan.

Lucifer: I am?

God: Yep. It’s ok, though because my plan requires you to rebel against my plan so that you can tempt the others and help them grow.

Lucifer: What the fuck? Do I get some kind of compensation?

God: No. In fact, the exact opposite, you get eternal damnation in Outer Darkness

Lucifer: Jesus Christ!

Jesus: Sup homes.

Lucifer: No, not you. I meant it as…never mind. Well, what is my plan? It must’ve been pretty terrible.

God: You wanted to force everyone to choose the right and make it back to me. I’m big on the whole freedom to choose thing, you know, free agency and all. Also, everyone who disagrees with my plan gets eternal damnation as well. There’s about 1/3 of you total. Man, I’m off to a great start already.

Lucifer: Fuck.

God: Oh, but that’s not all you did. You also wanted all the glory for yourself. I hate glory hogs. All the glory belongs to me.

Lucifer: So I, Lucifer, one of billions of spirit children, will rebel and try to usurp you, 
God Almighty, who has both omnipotence and omniscience?

God: Pretty much. You never were too bright. Anyway, my plan will require a sacrifice because everyone is going to sin and, for some odd reason, you’re not allowed to pay for your own sins. However, I want a sacrifice who won’t take any credit for his actions.

Jesus: I’ll do it. I’ll tell the humans to give you all the glory. I’m sure they won’t worship me at all, singing praises to my name, dedicating their lives to me and even calling themselves Christians and what not, essentially negating one of the big reasons why you opposed Lucifer’s plan.

God: Awesome. K, Jesus, here, take my powers and start creating the worlds.

Random Dude: Uh, wait, you mean you can just bestow your powers onto others?

God; Duh. How else is Jesus going to make the worlds?

Random Dude: Then how about you just snap your fingers or something and make us all perfect gods, just like you?

God: Hahaha, oh Random Dude. But then that would save everyone. To be honest, this plan was just to thin out the herd here in heaven. I had sex with all my wives too much and now it’s too crowded. Damn Viagra. Anyway, with this current plan, most of you won’t be coming back to me, which is fine because I never liked most of you anyway.

Lawfawnduh: God, I don’t think I can support either of the plans, they both sound really bad. 

Tyrone: I have to agree with her. We should come up with a different plan.

And I am intensely vulnerable right now.

It's been on my mind all morning, that I AM GOING TO TALK ABOUT MY LIFE...more publicly than I ever have before, exposing some very personal details about who I am and where I've come from.  I am going to be honest with a room (and Internet) full of people, most of whom I don't know, and they are going to hear my story.  

The thought electrifies me, even as it scares me.

This is one of the most personal things about me that I have volunteered to share, because people need to know, we as LGBT need to speak out.  After all, it's not just our rights we're fighting for--we are fighting for our right to grow up unmolested by threat or fear of spiritual or emotional or physical abuse, and sharing our stories...sharing my story...educating those who have not walked my path...that is the way to do it.  

My feelings against the church have returned with a searing fury, as evidenced when I played ""Look Down"" by Les Misérables, singing along, enunciating every word, every emotion with the memory of my closet.  I spent 18 years a slave...of the law.  And now I am Enjolras, rebel and revolutionary, going to stand on the barricade.

Awake, America!  Hear the cries and blood of your gay, lesbian, bisexual, trans(*)gender, queer people!  Let these wrongs not be unchanged, let these wrongs not be unavenged.  And also, comfort the hurt, shelter the stranger, heal the wounded.

I am very very keenly aware of my identity as a gay man, an identity quite literally written in the blood of my own Gethsemane.  And I hope the people I go to share myself with will lift me up when I fall, which I will do in sharing my story.

Thanks for listening, r/x.

**EDIT:** It went amazingly.  :)  Here's a pre-service survey of how it went.  I'll get the speech up in another post.

Starting today, I woke up early, showered, my mind totally focused on the task ahead.  I have been thinking about this for months, very regularly.  What I'm going to say; what I'm going to talk about; how I'm going to say it.

After a very, very emotional night before (mentioned above), which included me belting out ""Look Down"" in front of the mirror as catharsis for the emotions that preparing for this stirred up, I went to McDonald's to get some food.  Big breakfast platter.  Large coffee.  $5.65.

Sitting there with my food I began to feel overwhelmed.  With what I planned to share, so personal as it is, I felt quite overexerted,- so much this would require from me.  I saw an ad for the Trevor Lifeline on Facebook (1-866-488-7386), so I called them.  Got my feelings out.  And, with the help of the responder, decided to tell the worship leader that I may need less time to speak.  

It was very, very hard, going through that.  But I got to the church, told the worship leader that I may need to reduce my time to just 10 minutes of speaking, and had some quiet sit-down time to myself.

I went over my notes, and censored some things, noted what was an emotional trigger to me.  After I decided not to share certain details, I immediately began feeling better, and resolved to speaking the whole 20 minutes I was given.  So I went in, sat down, the music played, I was introduced...and in walked two men from the Mormon church that I know--my old scoutmaster and my old home teaching companion!  Suits immaculate, shirts pressed, ties straight, hair slicked...

They sat behind me and I asked them why there were here.  They said ""Just to listen.""  Had they been there for PR policing I would have asked them to leave.  Even so, after the service many people asked me about them after the service, and the worship leader even took me aside to ask if their presence would be a disturbance to me, emotionally.  I told her it would be fine, since they were here to hear me too, not to cause grievances.

And so the service continued.  When it came my turn to speak, I went up there, said a few words, and began telling my story.

Now that my speech is up...

After my speech, I received a prolonged and standing ovation.  One of the proudest moments of my life so far...and most rewarding.  Following me, a local artist performed one of his songs.  The complement to my talk was astounding, the expression of independence and autonomy so electrifying...I wish I remembered the name of the song.

After the service, many folks came up to me to give me hugs, words of encouragement, support, love, gratitude, awe, amazement, sympathy, empathy...it was clear that I touched their hearts, and in the best way I could have hoped for.

As I said, many people asked me about the two Mormon men, and I answered their questions.  But across the board, indeed, I was given, and my story was given, the respect and kindness that is necessary for anyone sharing something of this sort.

I don't know what will happen from here on out because of this, but I do know this, that my life will be changed by what I did today.

1369635220.0,82,self.exmormon,1f4hv3,"How did ""Adieu"" end up in the BoM? I'll tell you.",96,14,58,http://www.reddit.com/r/exmormon/comments/1f4hv3/how_did_adieu_end_up_in_the_bom_ill_tell_you/,"I recently posted about some Hebrew that our buddy Joe borrowed in making his propaganda, and today I have something else I haven't seen covered elsewhere.

The French word ""Adieu"" appears in the BoM as the final, commanding and cathartic word in Jacob 7:27--this is no secret.  The impact of this word, the FINALITY of this word, is argued as one of the high-points in Joe's translation ability.  While it's often listed as one of the flaws in the BoM, often to disprove the BoM's accuracy, I can't find online references to where the inspiration for this word came from.  Today, in thanks to Mithryn, I thought I'd share a little.

Joe was a particular fan of pulp fiction, lending his eyes to a library of books that were arguably impressive for such a simpleminded teenager.  He read a lot of treasure hunting stories, including several that featured Captain Kidd, the infamous ""pirate"" who sailed the Indian Ocean (where Cumora's capital city Moroni is located)...but that's not where it's from.

Some people say it appears in the Bible, so why can't it appear in the BoM.  Well, it doesn't appear in any Bible I own, and it's not in Strong's, which means it wasn't in any Bible that Junior had at his disposal between 1750 and 1834.

It's often said that Joe borrowed from Shakespeare, and the Bard used this word often, so that's where it comes from.  I'm no Shakespeare scholar, but I don't see it that often in his works, and I don't see this level of plagiarism coming from Shakespeare, but...maybe.  I doubt it though.

The reality, though, is that if the KJV was the most widely-read Christian book of the 1820s revival scene, the SECOND-most read book was ""The Pilgrim's Progress"" by John Bunyan.  In fact, ""Pilgrim's Progress"" is arguably THE single most common piece of Christian fiction in Western Civilization between 1700-1900.  Countless portraits have been painted of men holding not the Bible, but ""Pilgrim's Progress"" as they sit by the fire.

This book is significant for a number of reasons.  It has similarities to stories within the BoM.  Much of the exposition is identical to that in the BoM, just reworded.  It's written in Victorian English, which implies to the uninitiated that all Christian works are Victorian in tone.  It's been translated from English to English (not a typo), it's been corrected, revised and updated.  It was written in multiple sittings, with a prison term in the middle.  It uses commonplace words, places and names to tell a story in a fictional land that features surnames crafted from ordinary words (Mr. Godlyman, Mr. Illwill, Mr. Prejudice, etc.).  The parallels to the BoM are thin, but plentiful.  Personally, I think it's equally as important as ""View of the Hebrews,"" but that's just me.

Ultimately, the reason Joe chose the word was because he didn't know it was French, he thought it was Victorian (ergo, Bible-sounding), and the context of the word echoed a point home with the finality, class and tone that Junior was looking for.  ""The Pilgrim's Progress"" ends with this line:

""Shall it be my Lot to go that way again, I may give those that desire it, an Account of what I here am silent about; meantime I bid my Reader Adieu.""

""Adieu,"" the last word in the book, is italicized (the rest of the punctuation in my quote is verbatim).  

As shown previously, Joe had no concept of italics and copied them wholesale.  In the case of ""The Pilgrim's Progress,"" the italics denote foreign words (a concept still in use today).  The fact is, read the last line in Jacob then read the last line in ""The Pilgrim's Progress.""

I own 7 copies of ""The Pilgrim's Progress,"" but, no, I do not consider myself an expert.  The reason I have so many is that no two prior to 1957 are identical: no two have the exact same ending.  No two translations are verbatim.  The Penguin reprint of recent release (ISBN 978-0-141-43971-6) is what I quoted, and it's got the exact same ending as an 1825 copy I have that is bound in leather with an old map in one leaf and a newspaper lining the other.  It is the third-most-modified book I own.  Care to guess the other two?

""The Pilgrim's Progress"" is worth your time to get a feel for the pinnacle of Christian fiction prior to the advent of the BoM.  It held a standard that would not exist again until C.S. Lewis (and some say still holds).  The references made to this book exceed the limits of a post here today, and the parallels I find that suggest wholesale plagiarism are too numerous to count.

So if I get a chance to post here again, maybe I'll share with the inquisitive an Account of what I didn't mention today; meantime I bid my readers Adieu.",,False,self,t5_2r0gj,False,,,True,t3_1f4hv3,http://www.reddit.com/r/exmormon/comments/1f4hv3/how_did_adieu_end_up_in_the_bom_ill_tell_you/,

**ME**

A year ago I baptized my son (remember I'm still faking my belief) but I wasn't allowed to confirm him.

When I went in for my recommend, I handnt been paying tithing. I had just barely taken out a 5-figure loan to cover my wife's medical bills, and shit was (and is) tight financially. So, in the interest of, ya know, not letting my wife die of cancer, I decided to pay the doctors instead of the church. Perhaps if priesthood blessings worked as advertised, we wouldn't need doctors.

So, no recommend for me. I got to do the water dunking and my dad did the confirmation. Now, I don't believe in any of these rituals, but it was embarrassing in a social context.

This year was my daughter's turn. Since the bishop's handbook doesn't define 10% of your increase specifically, I just answered ""yes"" to being a full tithe payer. Fuck 'em if they don't have the balls to specify.

So this year I baptised and confirmed her. Whatever.

**MY FRIEND**

A couple we know had a girl born with a heart defect. They spent lots of money trying to save her. Blessings didn't work (they never do). They went to hospitals out of state. The mom never left her side. The dad burned all his time off until he had to go back to work.

Massive bills.

Massive debt.

The child did not live.

He stopped paying tithing to cover the costs. Noticing this, the bishop called him in gave him the standard message about tithing=faith, and TOOK his recommend.

Now, an older child is turning eight. He is in the same prediction as I was. The only difference is he still believes, and it's killing him.

""God"" gave this child an misformed heart. ""God"" didn't respond to prayers. This man lives within his means but attempting to save her life put him above his means. He accumulated debt, all to lose his baby anyway. And now he is being told he is a sinner and is unworthy to enter ""God's"" presence.

I finally created a Reddit account, just so I could hop on and address a question I have seen posed on here, in one form or another, several times. That question is, essentially, ""Why /r/exmormon?""

This is complicated, and deserves way more than my few paragraphs, but let me take a shot.

Many of us on here are in one stage or another of parting ways with the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints. Some of us rebel in small ways, by posting from Sacrament meeting; some of us have written books about our exodus. Some of us have moved on completely from r/exmormon. Most of us are somewhere in between.

This is, really, a break-up. Like a bad relationship, we are trying to get over something that once meant a great deal to us. Many of us have lost some of the most significant relationships in our lives as a result of our choice to move on from the Church. Some of us are on the edge of those losses. In any case, a life lived outside the fantasy created by the LDS church is real, but difficult. We are facing that difficulty, and doing the best we can.

So, consider this the spiritual equivalent of breaking up with someone who seemed perfect, but ended up being crazy, then badmouthing them with your best friend over a tub of Ben and Jerry's. Or, laughing years later at how gullible you were when you were younger. It's cathartic; it is a necessary step in graduating to something more meaningful and more honest. Many of us gave our best years to something that ended up being a complete lie. It makes sense that we would need some way of adjusting; this is one of those ways.

I expect this subreddit will become more widely viewed in the coming months and years. People are asking questions, and finding that most of the honest and transparent answers come from someplace besides the Conference Center. The Church's left hand is figuring out what its right hand is doing, and is ashamed - and this is where the left hand goes to say, ""how dare you!""

So, for my small part, welcome. And, to everyone who posts on here, thank you, for helping me through this.

I'm pretty sure the only way I can attain happiness is suicide.,100,15,117,http://www.reddit.com/r/exmormon/comments/1j9ps9/i_think_i_need_advice_im_pretty_sure_the_only_way/,"Edit: The support and advice and general love here has floored me. Thank you so much. Venting and talking it out has helped me mellow out again, so no worries for now!

This may be quite long, so I'll stick a TL;DR at the end.

Firstly, some background. I am a 20 year-old Englishwoman, 3rd gen. TBM. Family is ""the words 'sexy' and 'fart' are banned"" level of mormon/strict. I am a uni student and financially dependent on my family. One of six siblings, second youngest.

Oh boy. Where do I begin. I've just gone on holiday with my parents, little sister, a brother and his wife. I realised that the more time I spend with my family, the more I want to kill myself. I was triggered pretty badly on holiday so I need to write this for my own sanity whilst I'm trapped at home.

Okay, from the very start. For my entire teenagehood (since 12/13) I have been very, very depressed. I have never known why, and I never believed I had depression because I was led to believe my feelings were a normal part of being a teenager by my mother. She manipulated me into opening up and admitting how bad I felt a few times over the years, but every time she would immediately come back with ""you're not depressed, you just have low self-esteem. EFY/camp/YWs will help that"". Yeah, okay. I learnt never to speak to her, and just pretended that it all helped. I never, EVER told anyone just how depressed I was, though, because then I would have to admit that I have contemplated suicide nearly everyday for these past few years, and we all know suicide is selfish and evil (that attitude sure helped...). 

When I was 18, I left home for uni, freshly vamped on EFY juice and high on the spirit, oh lawdy. My mix of naivety, sheltered upbringing and mellowness led to me breaking every word of wisdom point within a month of uni (with the guidance of my mormon best friend, who had recently accepted herself as a lesbian). She was my strength and my confidante, and everything was dandy. I felt bad after my stint, saw Bishop, repented, all was good. I then got a boyfriend, non-member... yikes.

We were together for a year and a half, and I never heard the end of it from my mother. I've always gotten the ""least favourite child"" vibe from her and never felt loved, but her endless ranting about how ungrateful I was and how I was ""throwing everything she ever gave me back in her face"" only made me stay with the guy longer, even though he was a waste of space.

At the same time as this, I had finally accepted to myself that I was a feminist and really I have been for as long as I can remember, even as a child. With my women's rights interest I also took up the others, racism issues, homophobia, transphobia, and ableism. I researched into every one of them through the lenses of being a church member and could not believe how intolerant and disgusting the church was. It put me in a bad place that so many of my loved ones were blindly following this terrible institution.

At the same time as *that*, I was informing my little sister about these equal rights issues, not in reference to the church, but in general. She knew I was a feminist and kind of laughed at me because I'm so passionate about it, but with the knowledge I was supplying her, it wasn't long until she was like me, rolling her eyes through sacrament and coming to me to bitch after every young women's lesson. I have never been so happy because I didn't want her to get into a shitty marriage at 18 and pop out babies and then be done.

This is kind of where it gets shit, though. A couple of times a year I get really close to suicide and have a mental breakdown, that's been routine for a long time. Well it was happening worse than it had in a long time this past spring and I finally snapped and saw a doctor (I've been forbidden to seek therapy because it's ""of man, not of God""). Yes, I have depression, I finally got over my denial. I'm going to be attending therapy in the autumn when I'm back at uni so my parents don't find out. I broke up with the boyfriend the next day and also realised that I can reconcile myself with the church.

I could live with that. Even just after seeing a doctor, I felt so much better, these years of tortured silence shed from my back. I opened up to my housemates and best friend about the suicide issues, and admitted to my little sister and one brother (the only other sibling I trust with it, I also got him interested in inequality in the church, yay!) about having depression. Done, sorted. It was so easy to fend off the thoughts of suicide for weeks after, whereas immediately before it was so constant I was nearly fevered with it.

Between the doctor's visit and my arrival home for the summer, I had one, maybe two bad days, and that's it. It was incredible to feel normal.

Being at home was alright. I was getting a few bad days a week, and the suicide urges were climbing again, but it was completely bearable because I could just think ""I just need to survive the summer then it's into therapy and a bit of independence again"". Then, as it'll be my final year of uni, get a job, move away, perfect. I knew I'd never leave the church because I don't want to be ostracised and pushed out by my family, but I figured I'd just never marry because I enjoy living alone and can't stand the thought of going through the temple or being with a member of the church (and most of all, raising kids in the church and my fear of turning into my mother).

Oh god, then this holiday happened. I love my siblings. I always have. My little sister is a ray of hope that's kept me alive all these years, and one of my brothers I'd also consider a best friend. But that brother wasn't the one on holiday with us. This one... is a changed man. I'm not ashamed to admit, in my anonymity, that he repulses me. Everything about him makes me sick to my stomach. Perhaps partly because he is an exact replica of my mother, but immature and he isn't a parental figure to me.

Well my brother, lets call him Pious, has recently been called onto the bishopric of his stake, second councillor. Somehow this calling has turned him from Regular Douche to Holy Shit Levels of Douchiness OFF THE CHARTS. With us, if he doesn't get his way he'll call us (us being me and my sister, he's always had some ""I'm your elder I can control you"" issues) selfish and spoilt and literally throw a tantrum sometimes, but years of this has hardened us against it. His wife, however... he'll command her to do something, and if she says no, he will grab her wrist, arm, whatever, and *make* her go and do it. He's the kind of councillor who tracks inactive people down and follows them to there *workplace* if needs be to reactivate them. The way he talks now disgusts me, and the only thing he can ever talk about is the church. I believes he has the right to interrogate me and my sister about our testimonies and scripture studying, then lectures my sister because she hasn't learnt to lie as well as me yet.

I've given that info just to generally show that he's a douche, but it's a conversation that he had with (or rather, AT) me and my sister that's has triggered a lot of stuff. A *lot*.

I was so angry after and confused after the conversation that I documented it. Here is word for word what he said after my sister (I'll call her Hope) got annoyed with his relentless questioning and the thoughts I wrote:

*""It matters that I ask you if your read your scriptures because I don't want to lose a sister. If you leave the church it will destroy this family and it will destroy mum and dad. They wouldn't be able to cope"". Find it hardly believable that family is so mentally underdeveloped that they cannot accept differing opinions... Now that I've typed that out, I realise how believable it is. I am a terrible person.*

*Later on ""I like stuff like church picture books and putting on tapes, it's a good kind of indoctrination"". Um, what? Is it? Because now that I've gotten over mine after years of mental hard work (and I'm still only half way there) I am still trapped in this culture, definitely worse for wear.*

*I've been keeping pretty well on top of suicide urges lately (only think perhaps ten thoughts a day) but urges suddenly through the roof. Reverberating throughout very bones because I realise it would be to be actually dead than just ""dead to my family"".*

*If attempt must be made, must be more than just attempt. Nath managed to make one person's attempt all about him* [this refers to an incident where just after he got his calling a member in his ward made a suicide attempt and he wason that ""case"", so to speak. He has been playing the martyr months later still, talking about how much it affects him but never seems to mention how the guy is doing...], *I'm sure he'd find a way if I survived. Probably get locked in a room, too, as true beliefs/personality would come to light. God, everything's a paradox. Figurative God.*

*This church is on par with Catholic church. Sister-in-law's inappropriate rantings about Catholic church because of their donation boxes* [at one point my SIL decided to have a massive rant about how ""evil"" the Catholic church is in public because she went inside one and saw donation boxes] *just confused me because we have done things just as heinous. Justin Jones is doing just fine, my gay best friend is not.* [Justin Jones was the Bishop of my ward util it turned out he raped his teenage daughter. A few years later he's re-baptised into the ward next door and everyone's mysteriously forgotten.]

I had to leave after that conversation because I was suddenly trembling because I wanted to end my life so badly. Because the comments about how I would single-handedly destroy my family are why I'm stuff in a limbo between leaving the church and killing myself, and I actually don't know which would be worse for my family to deal with. I have a horrible suspicion I know which, though.

But you know what, who cares. Everyone is fucked up in their own way. What I really, *really* can't stand is that his words were beginning to take the same toll on my wonderful, beautiful baby sister. We've been chatting about doctrine for a while now, and I know she has a lot of problems with the church. But when she had a breakdown in my arms because she *hates* her life, has no control over it, can't do anything, is so confused and doesn't even know who she is any more, that's what I can't deal with. I can lie to myself, but I can't lie to her. I asked her to tell me everything, and she was honest. She still believes all the basics, but she believes the church has lost it's way but is so scared (crying from fear at this point) that ""Heavenly Father is angry with her"" that I would have cried myself if I wasn't a hollow cusp inside. I consoled her, told her that he isn't and that he loves her. She still thinks I believe the basics too, and that's what I'm going with for now, but she thinks what the church is doing is disgusting in regards to almost everything. I agreed and do agree with everything she said, and I told her everything she needed to hear at that moment, but I am so scared for her because she in a place where I was at one time, and I don't want her end up like I have. I also admitted to her my darkest secret, that I am a filthy slut aka not a virgin, after wanting to for a while, and it went great. We have now shared every single thing with each other (she even knows about my suicide thoughts) apart from my thinking that even the church's basics are BS.

Okay, so here I am now. I have no idea what the point of all that was, but there are four main reasons why I haven't committed suicide so far:

1. I couldn't do that to my sister.

2. I have a deep fear that church will turn out to be true, but the reason I want to die is because I don't want a consciousness any more. I want to stop existing.

3. Scared of failing.

4. I still love the rest of my family and don't want to hurt them.

But the thing is, I know that I can't stay in the church, and I know that I can't leave. I've gathered form over the years how terrible it would be to leave the church. I've seen how my mum stopped letting my dad speak to his siblings because they aren't members, and I've seen how they are spoken of with sadness, like they've died, even though they live in fucking Bristol. I would either be phased out, or worse, as my brother and mother have demonstrated over the years, they'd force me back, cram it at me wherever I go, and show me that love is conditional. Also for my sister's sake, I can't leave. Mum would view me as apostate and believe me to be influencing Hope like Satan, and would make her life hell.

Also I have nowhere to go and nothing to do, really. My mother never let me get a job as a youth so I have no work experience and don't know how to survive in the real world because I was destined for housewifery and taught accordingly. 

Basically I am so sorry for this venting. I am just stuck in purgatory and don't know what to do. I don't even know why I wrote this.

http://mormonchallenges.org/category/bookofabraham/

**Challenge 1- Papyri don't relate**

0:17 - Chicago fire excuse already.  Not looking good: Facimile 1 &amp; 3 were not burned in the fire (one even has a map of Kirtland on the back so we have both of those.  Fascimile no 2 we have from the printer's engraving.   We don't have to have 100% of the original documents to evaluate if something is true or a fiction, otherwise please renounce all claims that the Book of Mormon is true until the plates show up.  Thanks

0:35 - The long Roll, the shorter roll.  If we had any evidence that he translated from those rolls, that would be relevant wouldn't it.   But what we do have is the [egyptian grammar](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kirtland_Egyptian_papers) which features the characters from the papyri we have (Facsimile no 1) and the text of the Book of Abraham.  Got that.  We have the links in the chain.  So whether the long roll and the short roll were destroyed or not really doesn't matter for an evaluation.

0:49- ""We didn't know... to a house keeper.. to metropolitan museum"" this happened in 1960.  Who is ""We"".  This guy doesn't look like he was born then.  How about this line:  For 50 years the church has not admitted that...""  That's a bit more honest.

1:00 - ""All the sources refer to the long roll as to the source of the book of Abraham.""  except for [the fucking facsimile's and their descriptions given by Joseph himself](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Abraham_Facsimile_1.png).   Got it, you see there ""Abraham Abraham fastened upon an altar.?""  Yeah that's a source, that is contemporary, that matters.  

1:32- What we have is not what was the book of Abraham.  Again, he's ignoring the grammar.  [The grammar links Facsimile 1 to the text of the Book of Abraham](http://www.mormonthink.com/book-of-abraham-issues.htm#josephsegyptionalpha).  I""m not sure who his sources are that are contemporary sources.  Let's see:

William W. Phelps was called to be Joseph Smith's scribe in early July, 1835. The majority of the Alphabet and Grammar which Joseph worked on with his scribes is in Phelps handwriting, except for a small paragraph in the hand of Warren Parrish.

""The remainder of this month, I was continually engaged in translating an alphabet to the Book of Abraham, and arranging a grammar of the Egyptian language as practiced by the ancients."" (DHC Vol. 2:238 for July 1835; written in the year 1843)

2. ""This after noon labored on the Egyptian alphabet, in company with bro. O. Cowdery and W. W. Phelps: the System of astronomy was unfolded."" (Diary of Joseph Smith, October 1, 1835, p.3; also in DHC Vol. 2:286)

""exhibited the alphabet of the ancient records to Mr Holmes and some others"" (Diary of Joseph Smith, November 17, 1835, p. 45; DHC Vol. 2:316)

Hmm... Doesn't sound like he was working on the Long Roll, unless you assume the Grammar relates to the Long Roll, does it.  Kinda sounds like Joseph worked on the Grammar, and all those who worked with him focused on the Grammar.  The same Grammar that ties directly to Facsimile no. 1.  

This is dishonest, to say the least, to say that ""All the sources...Long roll"".  How about ""All the sources indicate Joseph was working on the Grammar, and that Grammar includes what we have to study"".

The other bit to be considered is that even if they were destroyed in the fire, we are not sourcesless on these:

*Document  B was once  the  longest  papyrus  in  the  collection.  It  is represented  by Photos 2, 3, 4, 7, 8 and  9 in  the  present  collection,  by  the  mounted piece  preserved  in  the  Church  Historian's  Office,  and  by  the  same  mounted piece  and  two pages of copies in  ""Valuable  Discovery.""* [Source](https://dialoguejournal.com/wp-content/uploads/sbi/articles/Dialogue_V03N02_69.pdf) this is the ""long roll"" he's talking about, and the photos of it are shut up so you and I can't see them, but any FARMS scholar could.   This is blatant deception.

*Their  intermittent  character  suggests  that  many  columns  of
writing  are  now  missing,  and  that  they  probably  were  missing  when  the  document  was  sold  to  the  Church  in  the  1830's.  In  its  present  state  the  manuscript  is exasperatingly  jumbled.*

Ah, you mean we might have EXACTLY what Joseph had.  Hmmm...

1:40: ""Anyone who tells you that ... Facsimile no. 1 is flying in the face of historical...""  How about you cite your sources, Mr. Apologist.  I've happily cited mine.  

**Challenge 2- Does Facsimile no. 1 contain Abraham**

A lot of what I'm going to say here comes from Egyptology and apologist Michael Rhodes' PoGP course taught at BYU.  Even the Egyptologists agree with this one, that no, Abraham does not appear in the writing on the facsimile.  Let's see how this guy deceives about this one:

0:25- Typical document- The differences in this document from the others 100% line up to what Joseph smith penciled in to fill the missing fragments.  (Source Michael Rhodes course along with identifying these Unique"" bits he cited, with what was hand drawn)

[Here](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/90/Vignette1.jpg) is the facsimile with what was missing clearly able to be seen.

0:37 - He means like [this](http://ebooks.adelaide.edu.au/b/budge/eawallis/book_of_the_dead/img/b017-2.jpg) all wrapped up to be mummified.  Fair enough.  Mind you to invalidate this argument we simply need to find [one](http://www.mormonismi.net/jamesdavid/mormpict/coucher1.gif) papyrus with [Someone](http://farm4.staticflickr.com/3392/3473627931_219b3721db.jpg) having hands up.

Unfortunately after a whole 30 seconds on google I can only find [this](http://www.mormonismi.net/jamesdavid/mormpict/coucher4.gif)
  and [This](http://www.mormonismi.net/jamesdavid/mormpict/coucher2.gif) and [this](http://www2.ida.net/graphics/shirtail/liion.jpg)  Yup, Unique.  No deception going on here.

0:59 - Two hands out:  [Oh really](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/90/Vignette1.jpg)?   The arms were added by Joseph Smith. Those could have been the leaves of a furn in the background.  Another person standing behind the mummified man, or any number of explanations.  

0:10- His leg is out, indicating he is moving.  Just like [this guy]( http://www2.ida.net/graphics/shirtail/liion.jpg) from the temple of Opet at Luxor, The small, but apparently important temple dedicated to the hippopotamus goddess of midwifery.

[It depicts ""Osiris who is at the heart of Waset"" in the guise of a young man, stretched out on a lion shaped bed. He is in the process of waking up, and Varille explains that: ""The neter is beginning to move, bending the right arm and lifting the left foot, below the bed's lion tail, which is very long and curved in a peculiar fashion.](http://www.touregypt.net/featurestories/opettemple.htm)

yup.  Unique.  Movement from a leg, so what could he be doing here?  Well he could be waking up with someone behind him.  

01:20 - ""Mistake made by the man who did the carving"".  This is one of the more deceptive bits and it makes me angry.

Who was the man who did the carving?  W.W. Phelps was the printer.  Who was Joseph Smith's personal Scribe at the time?  W.W. Phelps.

So here is the guy working side by side with Joseph on this specific thing, and the apologist blames HIM for making the obvious mistakes, not Joseph instructing him on how to correct things.  No, all mistakes are going to be the printer's

01:44- ""Hard for me to imagine""- Yes, we see what we want to see.  He's moving, with Anubis over him, between his legs.  Maybe Anubis was a horny dog that day and needed a good necrophiliac moment to scratch his undead itch.

01:50- And here we see the bias, ""Why would the priest be there"".  It's no a priest in any other document, it's [Anubis](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anubis), the god of the mummification.  So why is the god of mummification between his legs?  That's a good question.  But once you say ""priest"", one can see the logic that led Joseph to the tale he told.  And why did Joseph think it was a priest?  Because he drew a head on the body.

02:00 - ""A lot of people think we should look to what the egyptians thought about these facsimiles""  Um.  Duh.  But no, we should judge Egyptologists and Egyptians by Ancient Jewish standards.  Here he's kind of conflating all kinds of ideas in a round of bable.

1) Jews were not existent in the time of Abraham, Judah, being a tribe of Israel, the Grandson of Abraham.  

2) Jews did not make the drawings.  Simply that Jewish writing uses some Egyptian does not imply the reverse.

3) ""Ancient Jewish"" covers a long span of history.  He needs to narrow it down to specifics that can be verified.  Which Jews did what, in which texts.

02:27- The spiritual meaning.  That's how I know that [this drawing](http://imgur.com/8PCmZJv) is not king tut being ushered into the after life as Egyptologists claim, but really is a prequel to *Indianan Jones and the Raiders of the Lost Ark* directed by Osiris with Henry Fonda playning Indianna Jones.  It's not what people wrote, it's what the ""Spiritual meaning"" is.

02:36- ""Closest we have, comes from the Temple of Dendara"" (Not the one I posted earlier that seemed pretty close to facsimile no 1, including legs raised, arms raised and lion couches).  

[The Temple of Dendera](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dendera_Temple_complex) from middle kingdom to contemporary with Rome (about 98 A.D.) means this ""similarity"" is not contemporary with Abraham at all, but closer to the 500 B.C. date given by Egyptologists to the papyri.

02:36- Series of similar scenes

[Facsimile no 2](http://www.hethert.org/barque_of_HetHert_Dendera_med.jpg)  What's interesting is that the boat does have a meaning but nothing close to what Joseph translated it as

[facsimile no 3](http://farm3.staticflickr.com/2507/4150927350_8c1319141a_z.jpg) Kinda sorta similar.

And [Facsimile no 1](http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_AYvyTMscoEk/TQz1t_-8kNI/AAAAAAAAAAY/Iu-rWmkvy1Y/s1600/800px-DenderaHathorTempleComplexQenaEgypt589-2007feb10PhotoByCsorfolyDaniel.jpg) 

Here we see the bird above the body, the arm raised  the spread legs, and Anubis moving in.  The person weeping on the right seems to me to indicate that the person isn't dead yet, but Anubis is moving in to mummify him because he's as good as dead anyway.  There, hand me a degree in Egyptology please.

*Some are about human sacrifice*- But not the relevant ones.  Look at his eyes when he says ""Some are about Osiris""  Guess which ones...

2:50- Bastet who will protect her followers on the alter from beign killed.  Sounds impressive.  Let's see:  ""Bastet is the name commonly used by scholars today to refer to a feline goddess of ancient Egyptian religion who was worshipped at least since the Second Dynasty""  Ah, so she didn't exist in Abraham's day. Hmmm..  And it's a female cat goddess.   I'm gonna go out on a limb here and say that BYU is the only place you'll here Bastet having anything to do with Osiris' resurrection.  The writings are on a different temple, in a 40,000 sq ft complex.  This is a clear case of reaching to see what you want to see.

3:00- Closest parallels - Yes people were sacrificed on alters.  That's as close as you've got, hmmm?  ""I'm not sure they're real parallels"".  Ah, refreshing honesty. ... ""They support what Joseph Smith was telling us""

Ah yes, that Abraham would be rescued from a cat goddess from the future (She didn't exist yet) as the Dog God of mummification was between his legs, on the couch.  How could we all forget THAT rendition that Joseph gave?

Further note, you see the crocodile that Joseph Smith identifies as ""The God of Pharoah"".  Also the wrong century.  Totally an anachronism.  The vials used to hold the internal organs have a very distinct time frame for each set, and this one matches.. guess what, 500 B.C.  So either Abraham came after King David and Solomon... or Joseph is making shit up.

3:20- Protected by an angel.  Actually, that angel, is Osiris.  But let's ignore that.  Also let's ignore that it doesn't say anything about ""Abraham"" anywhere, but does give the name of a priest who was being embalmed later in the writings we have.

It's been about 9 months since I took of my garments (haven't missed those babies for a half a second), 6 months since I first tasted liquor (lots of fun times since), 4 months since beginning to tell family and close friends about our decision, 3 months since I found out I seriously love coffee, and sometime during the past month is when I finally stopped feeling guilty and second guessing myself for this huge, life-changing decision. 

I can't really put it into words, but I know others here will understand. It's a mixture of learning there really is no cosmic anvil getting ready to drop at any moment, and the euphoria that comes with freedom and autonomy that I have never, ever experienced.

1339616947.0,82,self.exmormon,v0cfb,Just released after 5 years in bishopric. Atheist now. ,96,14,49,http://www.reddit.com/r/exmormon/comments/v0cfb/just_released_after_5_years_in_bishopric_atheist/,"I have served faithfully as a counselor in a Bishopric in a ward in Utah for 5 years. I am 33 years old. I began the calling with no reservations and no major misgivings about religion in general or the LDS church in particular. My personal crisis of faith began in the last year of my service but I decided to continue to serve faithfully as a measure of due diligence. Our tour of duty ended recently and now I am 100% resolved in the notion that leaving the church is the right thing to do. Now begins the terrifying and likely slow and arduous process of coming out as a non believer. I am married with 2 children and will be as patient as I need to be in order to mitigate damages.

**EDIT**: I'll give an account of my shift from believer to non: 

My story might not be as much of interest to you guys in this /r/ because by crisis of faith was more on a macro level than a LDS-specific level. 

I began to really grapple with the fact that we find it so easy to dismiss other religions out of hand. We have no problem recognizing other faiths (Eastern, Muslim, Judeo-Christian alike) as superstitions, or as social constructs, or even as genuine attempts by other cultures and other communities to find meaning in life, to find comfort in death, to find answers in mystery. We see so clearly that these are simply traditions and not divine. We recognize, in other religions, that even though they have holy scripture, sacred ceremonies, ordinances, archaic customs and practices, that they are not of God. We see believing members of other religions in every corner of the world who believe as sincerely and earnestly as we do, who benevolently inculcate their children the same way we do, who pray and receive confirmation just like we do, who bare their testimonies and fast and study and edify each other, we have absolutely no problem with seeing this for what it is. We have no problem removing God(s) from this picture. We know that these are man made religions. However..........when it comes to our own...........when it comes to the religion that *our* parents taught us......the religion that just *happened* to be the predominate religion of the geographic location that we grew up in......when it comes to *this* religion.......this one.....is true. 

I started to think, is there one thing that I can point to that is written in the bible, the koran, the book of Mormon, the pearl of great price, doctrine and covenants or uttered by modern day prophets that could not have been written or uttered given the knowledge, philosophies, technologies, etc that were accessible at the time they were written or spoken. In other words is there *anything* that is ahead of its time or a departure from the given cultural landscape? NO. 

Everything you see in every religion, especially the LDS religion, is exactly what you would expect to see from a religion created by the people who created them, in the time and place that they arose from. The dots connect so clearly that you get a sick embarrassing feeling that you were ever blind to it. 

The thing that got under my skin then and now is the degree of arrogance that comes from saying that our tiny little offshoot of a religion is the only true and living church on the planet. Lets just suppose that that claim was true. Imagine the impossibly tiny percent of the human race that has been part of the the only true and living church on the earth. Imagine that you were lucky enough to win the family and geographic lottery that placed you securely in this tiny and fortunate group. Why would you be arrogant about that? You would acknowledge your profoundly improbable fortune every day and admit how it defies all logic and probability. Noboday talks like that. And if you don't think it was luck and you think it was divine providence then what in the HELL makes you so special. 

I am NOT special

Finally, I am aware of all the bread and butter problems with LDS doctrine and History. I worked for several years for BYU as a researcher in the philosophy/theology department. I published several pieces, through BYU, and Oxford press defending the LDS concept of Deity. I was a budding apologist for the church. I have seen all claims leveled against it but my final moments of clarity regarding the church came at the macro level of religion in general. I am so happy that I no longer have to spend energy doing intellectual acrobatics in order to defend indefensible propositions.

Yes you.  The lurker, or the person just starting to doubt.  This post is for you.  Many of the people posting regularly on this website went through the transition of belief pretty much on their own.

When you realize the church is most likely false, or even grasp it could be distorted, you'll probably experience a feeling like the ground dropping away from you.  

You'll be numb for days.  You'll look up things to try to find out if your suspicions are correct, or you might try to block it all out with loud movies/music for a while.

Doesn't matter, that's not why I'm here.  I don't care if you doubt, or push it away to belief.  

**What I am here to say is:**

1)  Know that at some point if the doubts hit full force, suicide thoughts are likely.  They pass quickly.  Ignore them, you'll be okay

2)  It gets better.  Yes, it also gets worse at times.  Specific times when a TBM has you cornered and is attacking your belief with every emotionally manipulative tool in their arsenal while crying foul if you so much as mention polygamy.  That sucks.  But those moments are rare compared to the full fledged life and feelings that are to come

3)  We've walked this road, and even though everyone of us has experienced it differently; we understand that it takes courage to leave, or even just to doubt a little bit.  We're here if you need to talk.

If you don't talk to us, talk to someone else.  Someone you can trust who is safe.  It's worth not leaving it all built up inside.

You matter.  You have importance in this world whether or not you are a child of God.  Independent of him, you have worth.  I've never met anyone yet I couldn't say that to, and that goes for you too.

So when those feelings come, or if you are feeling them now, I want you to know you'll get to the other side; a bright brilliant beautiful other side that is worth hanging on for.  

That transition is what we are here for more than anything.  More than any historical fact, more than any trivia piece of information, or link to a website, this is a place to help that transition to take place safely with as few people and relationships damaged as possible.

Thanks for taking the time to read.

1336750883.0,82,self.exmormon,tiags,My brother responding to an email string from active family members who oppose gay rights.  Proud of him for speaking out.    ,94,12,17,http://www.reddit.com/r/exmormon/comments/tiags/my_brother_responding_to_an_email_string_from/,"Mom &amp; Family,

Yes Mom, indeed I did ask some thought provoking questions but I think they are important. Allowing ourselves honest time for personal reflection to understand our reasons for why we take certain political positions in my humble opinion makes us more thoughtful, honest, and compassionate. So while we are on the gay marriage topic I would like to add a few thoughts of my own. I would like to state clearly that I support gay marriage. I would also like to state that I believe in “The Case for Marriage” you made but not exclusively reserved for straight people. Before I give some my reasons, I would like to address some popular quotes from the Church in their stance against gay marriage.


First a quote from the LDS Press release.

“Court decisions in Massachusetts (2004) and California (2008) have allowed same-sex marriages. This trend constitutes a serious threat to marriage and family. The institution of marriage will be weakened, resulting in negative consequences for both adults and children.”


My response:

Let’s examine closely some of these claims.  How does gay marriage “constitute a serious threat to marriage?” How will “the institution of marriage be weakened” if gay people marry? What “negative consequences for both adults and children” will result from Gay marriage?   

Of course there was no evidence given to support any of these claims. No logical connection is made whatsoever. These claims are without merit and only serve to create a false dilemma and an appeal to fear.

If one makes the argument that two gay people who are married will ruin the institution of marriage then clearly on those grounds I could make the same argument that two gay people who are dating will ruin the dating process for straight people. This type of logic would then call for new legislation that prohibits gay people from dating, and so it goes.

The arguments from the church and its members presented against equal marriage rights for same-sex couples are almost identical to the arguments which were presented over the years against women's suffrage, equal rights for blacks, no-fault divorce, removing the bans on interracial marriage, banning sexual discrimination in the workplace, and other social advances. The arguments made no sense then, and they make no sense now. The dire consequences predicted by those improvements in society have not materialized, and neither will the dire consequences prophesied for same-sex marriage materialize.

 

Second Quote: From Gordon B. Hinckley

“Some portray legalization of so-called same-sex marriage as a civil right. This is not a matter of civil rights; it is a matter of morality. Others question our constitutional right as a church to raise our voice on an issue that is of critical importance to the future of the family. We believe that defending this sacred institution by working to preserve traditional marriage lies clearly within our religious and constitutional prerogatives. Indeed, we are compelled by our doctrine to speak out.”


My Response:

Notice that the logic that Hinckley uses was also used by the Christian mob. Polygamy was “not a matter of civil rights” for them but a “matter of morality”, so they murdered and drove out the Mormon pioneers for the same reasons as Hinckley is using against gays. Christian mobs thought polygamy was immoral and a threat to traditional Christian marriage. This goes to show you that when government and religious groups start defining morality esp. in the bedroom it can have devastating consequences. So let’s suppose that we accept the premise that Joseph Smith was commanded by God to live plural marriage, this then makes it acceptable and moral. Now let’s use Hinckley’s logic and apply it to the Christian Mob. The Christian mob was “defending the sacred institution” of marriage in their day, one man one woman, by driving out the polygamous Mormons to “preserve traditional marriage” and this was “clearly within their religious and constitutional prerogatives” or so they justified. Remember, for Hinckley and the church, believe gay marriage is “not a matter of civil rights”, the Christian mob clearly felt this way too, and they gave them no civil treatment. The Mob was “compelled” to drive out the immoral polygamous Mormons, they didn’t want their kids to get corrupted or influenced by people who sleep around. Remember, the Christian Mob and the Government didn’t respect or acknowledge plural marriage as legitimate or accept Joseph Smith as prophet. This same attitude holds true for many faithful Mormons; they believe gay marriage corrupts traditional marriage so therefore it is justified to deny them civil rights. Do you see the conflict here?  Gay people are seeking marriage certificates and equality, not temple recommends.   

Most all black people I associate with including my wife are for gay marriage not because they necessarily endorse that life style but because they know what it is like to be treated like second class citizens, they know that life becomes harder to bear for those who have unequal opportunity. 
Reasons for Marriage:

In “the case for marriage” there are several benefits listed for married people. Clearly these benefits for married couples translate to a better society, the overall well being of the community. There are many other specific benefits that could have been added to that list, one being that monogamous couples who are married tend to be more productive and responsible citizens, they contribute more to the overall wellbeing of the community, this is a very good and desirable thing!


Proposition A: Case for marriage, Equal rights: The better your relationship and marriage is the less we need to worry about you. Equal rights make your life easier and better.


Better Financial picture

Longer Life

Better mental Health

Greater Safety

Better Sex

More shared sacrifice for the well being of the community (my addition)


Proposition B: The opposite of A. No marriage, single, straight and gay people, no equal rights, harder life.


Not as good as married people’s finances:  More debt, bad credit, higher probability of bankruptcy and possibly a burden on the welfare system and so on.

Shorter Life: Blacks had shorter lives too when they were not given equal rights because of the violence against them, are we going to deny marriage and equal rights to gay people knowing that their lives may possible be shortened?

More susceptible to poor Mental Health: Depression, more prescription drugs, more doctor visits, poor self image. People with mental health are more at risk for suicide. Type in gay suicide on Google and read the reports. Poor mental health can lead to impaired ability to form healthy relationships.

Less Safety:  Before and after the civil rights movements, blacks were the target of violent hate crimes by whites, usually white Christians. Gay’s are still violently attacked in society for being gay. If you doubt this, just type in “gay people attacked” in your Google browser and then go to videos. Would it seem irreverent to assume that societies who deny equal rights to minority groups make it easier for some of its citizens to justify hate crimes?

Promiscuous sex: Single people, gay or straight are much more likely to have multiple sex partners, greatly increasing their chances of contracting an STD. People with STD’s spread STD’s to others within the community. This is bad. It is worse when the STD is life threatening such as the HIV virus.

Less shared sacrifice for the community: Unmarried people will give back less to the community than married people. This is undesirable.

Clearly, Proposition A is better than B.

So the real question is this; If we take “the case for marriage” seriously, if we believe in the evidence shown, if we believe married people will be much better off and the community will be better off, then why would anyone deny gay people, living in the community, the right to marry, especially when marriage is proven to be better for the overall wellbeing of the community in which we all live and pay into?!

Room for disagreement: this is a website by faithful active Mormons who are pro gay rights. It’s a great way to become more informed on the topic by other people who share your beliefs.

She was saddened by my resignation. She said that she took time after church to meditate on who she dreamed I'd become when I was first born. She said that within a day of my birth she realized I was my own person with a fully-formed personality. She realized that there wasn't much she could do to change who I was... and that that scared her. She said that she had imagined I'd be a valiant missionary and one day become a stake president. She said she was holding out hope for my coming back to church until she got 'the news.'

That all ended with an ""I love you"" and then she asked me how my girlfriend was doing.

When we first started talking, he hadn't mentioned his religion. The only thing that triggered him to do so is when he and I began getting serious and he needed to tell about his future mission plans. 

At first, hearing all about the religion and the crazy requests from the church, made me want to run away as quickly as I could. But, I have never been one to judge others so I stuck by his side and even let him know I'd support his decision to go if that's what he chooses. His parents dislike that I am not the pure Mormon girl they wish he had, but he does not care and has stuck up for me more times than countable. 

As time passed, he began questioning the mission and it's true purpose. I told him in a heart-to-heart that it's okay not to go, that he had a mind of his own and he is enabled to use it. He of course, stayed hesitant at the idea of ever going against his family's will. He kept saying, ""I don't want to go, I want to choose my own path in life. The only reason I'd go is to please my family."" I stopped him immediately and said, ""You're doing it for all the wrong reasons.""

After a few more months (months that we had barely discussed this subject) he came to me and said, ""I have decided I will not be going on the mission. It's not for me, it is not what I want."" I was completely shocked, at this point I had thought there was no way he would actually make such a bold move (even though it is the right one). 

Now, here we are two months later and he has since told his family he does not want to go, and even spoke to his Bishop about it. His family flipped, and told him ""this is just a stage, you will want to go, this is what you are meant to do"", while his Bishop had other thoughts.

I have looked down on this church, time and time again for lying and putting pressure on helpless wanderers that are trained to never think for themselves. But what his Bishop said, made me happy. He told my boyfriend, ""I am extremely proud of you. You have the courage to stand up for yourself, and do what YOU want to do. Not many in this church do that. You're one of a kind. If it makes things easier, I will happily sit with you and your loved ones to reassure them that this is okay, because as most families do in this religion, I assume they are pressuring you to do otherwise. Just know that you are doing the right thing by you and the church, and it's good to have your own voice.""

NEVER would I have expected that. I will never technically be pro-Mormon, BUT I am damn happy to see that not all Mormons are the stereotype. My boyfriend and the Bishop included in this rare breed. To this day, my boyfriend thanks me for opening up his mind and making him realize life's too short to live it for anyone else but yourself. I preach to everyone to always do what makes you happy, and in the end that's what he is doing.

1367688299.0,82,self.exmormon,1doq1l,My Experiences With Sexual Repression in TSCC,92,10,25,http://www.reddit.com/r/exmormon/comments/1doq1l/my_experiences_with_sexual_repression_in_tscc/,"I consider myself a highly sexual person. I greatly enjoy sex in many different forms. However, this hasn’t always been my experience. I grew up in a devoted Mormon family. Growing up my grandfather went from stake presidency, to stake patriarch, to stake president. When I tell people this they often laugh and don’t believe me, they wonder how on Earth I got here from there. I’ve ben thinking about it a lot lately and decided to write about my thoughts and feelings on the subject. 

I remember at a very young age always being curious about my body. In the bathtub I would touch and try to look and examine my vagina. My mother always reprimanded me, she would tell me that was not a place I was allowed to touch. It was a dirty taboo action and even though it was part of my body I was not to touch. 

I grew from this touching and exploring to rubbing myself against blankets and pillows. After all I wasn’t touching it. I remember this pleasurable tickling feeling that I really enjoyed and I would do it often. When my mother discovered this when I was around 4 or 5 I remember her distinctly telling me I needed to stop doing that. I asked her why, telling her about the tickling feeling and her response was that Jesus wouldn’t like it. 

I stopped the rubbing. I after all was a Mormon child and I didn’t want to disappoint Jesus. But as I grew up and faced puberty that desire for that feeling came back. I began to do it again, secretly in my room where my mother wouldn’t know I was doing it. The rubbing on blankets through my pants quickly became just through my underwear and then my bare vagina on the blankets. This evolved into stroking and touching and even penetration. I remember talking on the phone with my boyfriend about sex and touching myself thinking about it. 

This was a time in my life where I began to experience a massive amount of guilt. I hated that I enjoyed doing this. I felt dirty. The church had drilled into me that even thinking sexual thoughts was a sin. Touching myself was a sin, talking about sex was a sin. I got lessons regularly about chastity and staying pure and protecting my bodily temple. That was the job of a girl in the church to stay pure and clean for her husband, and I was failing miserably. I hid my struggle with this. I appeared the perfect Mormon girl, I dressed modestly, I knew the doctrine and I was praying. 

My sexual feelings and desires did not go away. They only grew stronger. I was trapped in this cycle of intense guilt and shame. I would pray and pray for the feelings to go away and for me to be stronger in fighting off the temptation. I could not stop thinking about the lesson of Satan with his flaxen cord and each time I gave in and touched myself or even thought about it there was another thin cord around me for Satan to pull me away into temptation. I couldn’t talk to anyone about it. I feared my friends in the church would judge me as dirty and I couldn’t go to my mom either. Sexual things were not something that could be discussed in my family. Any curiosity was immediately shot down and condemned as a dirty sinful thought. Questions were not allowed as it was seen as asking for an instruction manual to immorality. That is what sexual purity was in the church, it was your morality and virtue and losing it was seen as the greatest sin you would commit apart from murder. And so I went searching for my own answers, exploring with a boyfriend who was not part of the church. 

I was 14 when I lost my virginity and in some ways I regret it in that I wasn’t really ready. I was not sexually liberated from my repressed Mormon upbringing. When it first happened though, I felt good, like I had shared something wonderful. I remember telling my best friend that I had had sex and that I didn’t feel guilty. But the next Sunday the Bishop of my ward called me into his office. I was terrified, I suddenly felt infinitely guilty. The bishop looked at me and told me “the spirit is telling me to speak to you, is there something you would like to tell me?”. Looking back that was silly and he likely didn’t actually know. However, while in this religion all I could think was oh my gosh God knows what I have done and he is hurt by my actions. That Sunday I sobbed in this old man’s office telling him all about all of my sexual experiences. As I look back it seems highly inappropriate that an older man would ask a 14 year old girl for every specific detail about my sexual activities. But at the time I felt I had to confess everything if I was to be forgiven by the Lord. 

I confessed everything, and I listened to the council of the bishop and told my parents. I remember the looks on my parents face, especially my mother and how much my heart broke. My mom practically called me a whore and they both expressed how immensely disappointed in me they were, how they could not even look at me. 

The next three years of my life were spent in constant guilt and shame. I struggled with my sexual urges. I spent so much time on my knees begging for the Lord’s forgiveness and pleading for help in forsaking all things sexual. In this time, I cut myself. I had so much pain and guilt and shame and I hated myself. I couldn’t control the urges. I would do well for a while then need to touch myself or be touched by someone else. I struggled and the constant lessons about chastity did not help. 

There was one specific lesson that always made me feel like I was a hopeless failure that no one would ever want. There would be a tray of cupcakes, one for each person. The teacher would lick one and then send the tray around. The last person was stuck with a licked cupcake and wouldn’t want to eat it. This is how the church described the virtue and morality of a young woman. The point was that no one wanted a licked cupcake. It didn’t matter how much you repented in the end you were always this licked cupcake. It didn’t matter how hard I was trying, how well I knew the scriptures and doctrine, or that I was the president of the young women at a time. I was a dirty licked cupcake. 

I remember sending a picture of my breasts to my boyfriend, the one I lost my virginity to. We continued the relationship, or tried after the incident even though my parents hated him. My mother found the picture going through my email account, because the “spirit” told her she should check on me. She found the email in the trash folder. She posted the picture on the refrigerator and then came into my room saying she put something there she thought everyone should see. This culture of quilting and shaming in the church was also so profound in my home life. Instead of talking to me about my actions this was her solution, to make me feel guilty and embarrassed. When we finally did talk it was “What did I do wrong?” and “Is this the kind of sick life you want so far from the spirit?”, accepting my sexuality was never given to me as an option. Guilt and shame were used to make me feel as if I was making some sort of choice to try even harder. Really I just wanted to be good enough, but in the church you can never really be good enough because no one is perfect. 

I went to the bishop again and again confessed everything. I hadn’t had sex again but I was feeling guilty about the thoughts and the dirty talks and the masturbation. I had touched others and been touched and engaged in oral sex. So again I felt the need to confess. After this second confession, I buried myself I the church. I cut ties with anyone I had had any sexual relationship with, and I threw myself into scripture study and prayer and church activities, as I was supposed to. 

I was doing everything right for once, but there was still so much lingering guilt and shame. I had repented and confessed and done everything I was supposed to do, yet I was still that dirty licked cupcake. Those chastity lessons cut me deep. I was always taught the church was supposed to make you happy, it was the only way to achieve true happiness. Yet here I was following all the rules and doing everything I was supposed to and I was miserably unhappy.  

I finally gave into my sexual urges again around 17. I started exploring BDSM online because it was so much of my fantasies. I still felt shame and guilt about it but I pushed it way down deep. Decided if I did everything else right maybe it would be ok. Even though I was always taught sex before marriage is the greatest sin aside from murder. 

Fast-forward 3 years through years of sexual exploration. I fell into a deep depression. The more I got involved in the kink community and the more I enjoyed it, the more depressed I became. It took a while before I could identify some of the problem. There was still an immense amount of guilt I hadn’t dealt with. I had been in a state of indecision, not letting go of the church, but not going either. I was happy, but with that happiness came so much guilt. I had had it drilled into my head that the only way that I could be truly happy was with the church. Yet here I was happy, with wonderful people in my life having wonderful sexual experience. But there was still so much guilt. There was still always this lingering question about whether I was squandering my life in sin and should repent and return to the church. 

I spent years wallowing in guilt and self-loathing about my sexuality. The church taught me I was to be this virginal being and sex was only appropriate in marriage and was for making babies and pleasing my husband, but it was not really intended to be a pleasurable experience. Women in the church are not supposed to be sexual creatures. 

After a lot of time in therapy and some wonderful partners I have finally let go of all of that guilt. I am a sexual being and there is absolutely nothing wrong with that. Sex is a natural human instinct and drive. It is part of who I am. I can’t say whether or not I believe in a god anymore or not, but there is one conclusion I finally came to. If there was a truly loving god, he would not have created me with a high sexual drive and desires that can only be described as sinful through the religious perspective I was raised in, if  he did not intend for those things to be explored. It would be cruel to condemn humans for exploring the natural drives and instincts you put into them. 

Somehow I made it out of that sexually repressive religion. I found my sexuality and I have found my joy. There is so much intimacy in sex, in the sharing of your body with another human being, in the skin-to-skin contact and the pure connection between two people while they share a sexual experience. I am not ashamed that I enjoy those things. I am no longer ashamed of my sexuality and the wonderful pleasures associated with it.

It also seems only fitting to do this on the night the Romney campaign and associated ""Mormon moment"" finally and permanently end. (Please go vote and don't let me eat those words.)

My life over the past couple years has been a bit of a roller coaster, but now I look back and see it as an amazing success story. A little context: I first posted on /r/exmormon [a little over a year ago](http://www.reddit.com/user/utahbeaver) on a throwaway. (I made up a bunch of details to prevent anyone from figuring out who I was.) I had been reading mormonthink and /r/exmormon for a few weeks at that point and was pretty shaken up. Fortunately, you guys calmed me down, I was able to talk about things with my wife, and we both ended up leaving.

I kept you guys posted as we navigated issues with family/ward members/friends, wrote our resignation letters, and got confirmation that our records had been removed. You helped me to adjust to the world of coffee and alcohol (I still think tea is gross.) Lately I haven't been participating here as much as I used to, and I think it's because there's nothing left to say. The final chapter is written, and I've made a new life for myself that Mormonism is no longer a part of. Mormonism is nothing more than an obvious fraud, and by walking away from everything Mormon and just living my life I will take back any power they still have over me. I will live my life without even thinking about Mormonism. If anyone brings it up, I will quickly express my disdain and move on.

I think of a lot of you as friends, and I've become personally invested in your struggles. Many of you have had it much harder than I have. I wish you all luck and hope that you find yourself in this same position some day.

I work with data in conjunction with Marketing, and one thing that Marketing groups love to do, when numbers don't come out the way they like, is to rename a metric until they define failure as success.

Words such as ""Real"", ""Actual"", ""True"", ""Prime"" are all red flags that numbers are being monkeyed with to make someone look good.

""Real Growth"" is defined by the church as: ""whenever a person does family home evening or commits to not drinking caffeine, watching r-rated movies or takes any step toward Christ"" then the church is ""really growing"".

Poof, you no longer have to discuss that the church is shrinking in number, you can talk about the ""Real Growth"" of the church until the cows come home.

Please watch over the next days, months and years at Stake Conference, ward conferences, and General Conferences for the word ""Real Growth"" to crop up, and replace the claims that the church is growing.  No you know what it really means, it means that despite shrink, the core group is getting ever more fundamental in their practices.  

You see, as the denominator (individuals in the ward) shrinks, it's easier to get home teaching numbers up (20/100 is 20%, but the same 20 divided by only 50, is 40%... real growth increases even though families home taught remained absolutely constant).

And what get's measured gets done.  Imagine the pressure to count home teaching instances being equal to getting baptisms done on a mission.  This path leads to fundamentalism.  You can see it in the FLDS when they start out, just trying to meet the basic metrics, and eventually create their own metrics (Babies born to polygamists) for what is required for salvation.

Please spread this to whatever exmormon boards, recovery groups, blogs you are on, as ""Reactivation"" would significantly increase ""Real Growth"" metrics, and so pressure on family members is going to increase significantly over the next few years if I haven't misguessed on this attempt to swap out metrics.

In addition, whenever you see ""Real Growth"" in a talk next to the words ""Baptism"" you have another chance to point out Gospel Principle's lesson 31 on Honesty, as ""Real Growth"" has almost nothing to do with the number of baptisms, and is misleading the membership in thinking that membership numbers are increasing, while completely separate metrics are being measured/reported.

Home Teaching and Caffeine were **not** mentioned, which is one of the dangers of non-measurable metrics, the local leadership interpreted them by their own understanding and presented ""Caffiene"" and home teaching in place of ""Love at home and for our neighbor"" and ""Personal experiences with Christ's atonement"".

I live in Seattle and enjoy cannabis on a somewhat regular basis - but that night I had just had friends over and we got messed up. Well they left (took a cab, don't worry!), I did a few more hits off the vaporizer and started getting ready for bed. It was about 8pm, and I had an early day. I threw on a bathrobe for comfort, walked into the kitchen and heard a knock at my door.

Now, again, I wasn't a little high, I was probably the highest I've ever been. Unfortunately, I had just walked by the door and they would have heard me (or at least thats what my brain was telling me at the moment) so I opened the door.

There were three men - they all looked over 40, one looked like he could have been 65. This is how the conversation went:


**Them**: Are you Mayonade? Nice to meet you we are the Elders Quorum from the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.

**Me**: Oh, hello, yes... thats me

**Them**: Wonderful! Do you remember I called and asked if you'd be free this week?

**Me**: Oh, yeah. I thought you were going to set up a time

**Them**: Sorry about that! We were just in the area and thought we'd stop by. Is it a bad time?

**My Thoughts**: *I think I see a moth. Whoa... thats really cool... how does it fly like that? Wait, Who are these people.... oh crap... I'm high.... what am I doing.... oh, right!*

**Me**: Well. I'm not going to lie to you fellas. I'm really stoned. 

**Them**: *Nervous laughter*. ""Well.... then its probably not a good time...."" 

**Me**: Probably not

They continued to try and talk to me, but I honestly don't remember any of the details. I do remember watching their mouths move and being amazed that humans could make words - but I certainly don't remember anything about actual discussion.

It was bar none, the most embarrassing and funniest moment of my life. I'll update when they return.

1376428104.0,83,self.exmormon,1kayxt,The ability to consider hypothetical situations is what separates TBMs from ExMos.,91,8,41,http://www.reddit.com/r/exmormon/comments/1kayxt/the_ability_to_consider_hypothetical_situations/,"Today I was talking with my mother about her teen years and early twenties. She brought up that she once dated a guy whose father was a bishop, stake president, area authority and has since been made a temple president. I remarked that had she married the son, that she would have been on the GA fast track and that her children would likely be on the fast track as well.

We carried on in this vein of conversation for some time until I let too much of my feminist side slip through and made the claim that the GA fast track for women is not comparable to the one for men, because women have no access to mid-level authority positions like stake, mission or temple president. I also asserted that for women, the climb up the ladder is even more defined by who they know and who they are married to, and that a woman's status in the church is entirely dependent on the status of her husband and that she has no status without one.

To illustrate this, I set up a thought experiment where the church did not have a policy that required men to be married to be in high positions. I stated that this situation illustrates the status of women in the church because it would be possible for a man to be a mission president without a mission president's wife, whereas a women cannot be a mission president's wife without a mission president. I was trying to use this to highlight the fact that a woman's position in the church is linked entirely to her husband, while a man is valued in and of himself.

Well, my mother completely balked at this notion and began going off on tangents talking about how women are more influential than men and how my hypothetical could be proven false because in reality a man has to be married. Basically, it can't be because it isn't. She also said, ""If there wasn't a mission president's wife, who would counsel with the sister missionaries? If they called another woman, the MP would cheat on his wife with her because they worked so closely."" Then she proceeded to challenge the existence of a GA fast track even though she had accepted the premise throughout the entirety of the conversation to that point.

She ended the conversation by telling me that the only way she could even entertain the possibility of my thought experiment was if she suspended belief in the existence of God and the veracity of the church's claims. Then and only then would she be able to momentarily accept my hypothetical situation.

This kind of thinking blows my mind.

It's absolutely possible to entertain hypothetical situations without suspending belief (or disbelief) in unrelated assumptions. However, the church introduces so many barriers to critical thinking that it makes you unable to even entertain the thought that the church might be false. That's why, for us exmos, leaving Mormonism is such an earth-shattering, psyche shaking event. I've never done anything more mentally, emotionally and physically exhausting than extract myself from the church. It was my dark night of the soul and I doubt I'll ever experience something quite like it again.

But the reason I left was because I was able to entertain a specific hypothetical situation: ""If the church was not true, would I want to know?"" My answer to that was ""Yes, of course."" It is the ability to ask and explore the ""If"" questions that separates us from TBMs.

Last night, my mother was talking to me about faith. She read that oft-quoted verse that says ""Faith is believing in things which are not seen which are true."" I asked the question, what about people who have faith in things that are not true? Is that faith?

She said that those people do not have faith, but devotion, and that real faith only comes when a person believes in the truth. I replied with, ""So, we, the Mormons, are the only people with real faith?""

Instead of replying with a simple ""Yes, faith can only be in true things and we are the only ones with the truth"" she launched into mental gymnastics to try and justify the beliefs of others while maintaining the superiority of her own. The problem was that she was unable to entertain the possibility that other people possess faith that is just as valid as hers because that might introduce a smidgen of a possibility that she had not chosen the correct religion.

And you know what, I don't blame her or any other TBMs for this because I was her at one point. She has been conditioned her whole life to only accept what the church teaches as the only source of truth. Therefore, to entertain the possibility of truth outside the church, she feels the need to dismantle her entire belief system. For her, what's the point of doing that when the church is *obviously* true.

TBMs think about hypotheticals like this: ""Because there *isn't* there *cannot* be.""

Exmos think about hypotheticals like this: ""*If* there is, then there *could* be.""

The two styles are so incompatible that TBMs who apply ""if"" questions to all aspects of their life must inevitably become either Exmos or NOMs because the build of cognitive dissonance becomes too great. If even entertaining the possibility of a hypothetical situation scares most TBMs shitless, then the church is built on a shaky foundation indeed.",,False,self,t5_2r0gj,False,,,True,t3_1kayxt,http://www.reddit.com/r/exmormon/comments/1kayxt/the_ability_to_consider_hypothetical_situations/,

Long story short, my parents found out I was doing things that were contrary to their church's beliefs, and immediately sent me to counseling.

After talking to the psychiatrist for about an hour he said ""you're a really smart kid, and what you've doing isn't wrong by any moral standards; there's no clinical issue here. So what I want to know is why you're deliberately disobeying your parents?""

I started easing into the truth, telling him how oppressive things are, how I don't even get the fundamental freedom of religion. He could tell I was beating around the bush and said ""I'm not Mormon, you're not going to offend me.""

So I told him everything, my exact problems with the church, why I hate going to school every day and why I hang out with the ""worst"" kids possible. He said something simple, but I'll never forget it:

""Religion is your main stressor, and I know your mom personally and know she's completely unreasonable when it comes to these things; but it's not healthy for you to believe one thing and do another. I'm going to talk to your mom, but I highly doubt I'm going to be able to convince her. Regardless, you need to start standing up for yourself, for the sake of your mental health. No matter what the punishment, no matter how bad things get, it won't be worse than your current mental state because of the way you're treated.""

Things may seem bad if you stand up for yourself, but I promise they're worse when you don't. Don't go to church, stop going to seminary. Do whatever you need to do to make yourself comfortable.

What are some of the craziest things you did as a missionary that you can't tell the TBM family members? We don't need to get into the whole I made out with someone of the opposite sex stuff, but really some of the funny crazy things we did as missionaries that could have resulted in punishment or expulsion.

First off just for a little background I served in France and have been home for about 8 years now.

One of my companions and I started the 5 country club where you had to get your passport stamped in 5 countries other than the one you were assigned to. I made it up to 4, the fifth became too difficult as any other country was too far away from where I was at and the companions I had were too afraid.

The other one was my buddies in the mission and I started an underground radio show for the missionaries. We were some of the first missionaries to get cellphones in the world, and texting was so expensive and it could be tracked we couldn't do it, but we could essentially record a voicemail and send it to any cell phone at no cost and no tracking. So we wrote a 3-5 minute show that we would ""broadcast"" every Thursday and did this for 2 transfers. It had sound effects and all.

-Edit-
Another fun offense that comes to mind is every year on June 21 France has a music festival. In every major town they set up stages all over and play music all night long to ring in the first day of Summer. In the town I was in the techno stage was set up right below my apartment. As I used to break dance before the mission people could see me dancing in my window and coerced me to come down and show off my moves on the stage. I instantly became a celebrity to the teens in town and they would ask me to dance all the time. That's right left my apartment at 2 AM to go dance for the Frenchies.

I also frequented the beaches on the Mediterranean. We used to go to the big Target like stores and just stand and watch tv. One Saturday we decided we didn't want to work and went to a real French circus. We always took up the offer from the cool members to take us to castles.

""Of course not, no!"" they reply.  Okay, first lie for the purpose of right-doing.

""Sure, sure whatever!"" I say with a big smile. The mood was lightened and they could tell I was a very friendly happy individual.  

So they fish around, want to know my story and I tell them with a big ol' smile and happy face. I pointed out that I officially resigned just a few months earlier.  You could tell one of the girls was much more down to earth than the other.  The cool one was from San Diego, the other - Idaho. I tell them simply that I don't believe at all in the Doctrine and that their beliefs are not required for true happiness and peace of mind of an after-life. I mention after-life just because I feel that's just the point of all religion is to feel comforted about what happens after you die. Idaho then tells me matter of fact that she knows that SHE represents and knows truth.

""See, now you've gone and really offended me."", I tell her.  Idaho asks how. ""Have you ever heard of the Buddhist proverb about the finger pointing to the moon is not the moon?""  Stern eyes tells me no, but San Diego seems intrigued. I point out that in a nut shell it means that truth has nothing to do with words. 

""Let's say the Moon is truth and we both obviously see the Moon when we look up at the night sky. However, it's not the finger - words - pointing to the moon that is the truth.  It's what I see with my OWN eyes when I look up, holy crap the moon!""

San Diego loved it.  Idaho?  Well, she handed me her card.  Yup, missionaries now have cards based on the ""I'm a Mormon"" campaign with the token old black guy and all.  

Anyways, it made me happy.  You can argue all day with these people, but I find it's a waste.  However, when they head towards the ""we own the rights and privileges to the truth"", it really fucking bugs me.

1358486308.0,83,self.exmormon,16sux5,Another update:  Rage Quitting,87,4,74,http://www.reddit.com/r/exmormon/comments/16sux5/another_update_rage_quitting/,"Finally back in town after being away for several weeks.  I have not had any contact from members of our ward until last Saturday.

Our bishop has my wife's cell number.  This is the coat-tail bishop that is doing a poor job of being his dad.  He had his executive secretary call during the Broncos game.  He asked my wife if I was around and if he could speak with me.  The exec is a good guy.  He is barely hanging on to the church.  If it wasn't for his wife, he'd be gone too.  My wife knows I like this guy so she hands me the phone.

Exec:  ""Bishop wants to meet with you tomorrow right after church in his office.  Can you meet with him around 1pm?""

me:  ""Dave, that just isn't going to happen.  I am rarely home and I have no desire to spend that limited time listening to some pompous prick.  Usually I get paid to have to tolerate that pain.  So, no, I am not going to his office tomorrow.""

Exec:  ""Yeah.  I figured and I tried to tell him but he didn't seem to care.  I'll let him know.""

We chatted for a few minutes and then he dropped this one:

""They've been talking about you and your family in bishopric meeting.  I know you are leaving the church.  Hey man, don't think we still can't hang out.  I think we're the only two sane people in this asylum.""

There you have it.  Stage 1 is in progress:  I am the topic in bishopric meeting.  Stage 2 being ward council and Stage 3 being actively courted by the various auxiliaries.  

You'll also notice the typical Mormon checkbox and procrastinate methodology.  I know bishopric meeting is Sunday.  That means the assignment went to the Exec on Sunday and come Saturday, he realizes the bishop is going to ask the next day.  I love it.

About an hour later, the bishop calls my wife and asks if I am around.  She asked me if I wanted to talk with the bishop.  I said sure.

The B:  ""Um, Hey.  We've missed you at church.  I was hoping you could meet me in my office tomorrow.  I feel like we could, um, you know, work out some of your issues.  I, um, think it would, um, be good for you.""

Me:  ""No.""

&lt;awkward pause as he expects me to say something else&gt;

The B:  ""Oh, um, ok.  Maybe I can meet you at your house some time this week.""

Me:  ""I fly out Monday and I am gone for 2 weeks.  You can come over tomorrow between 5 and 5:30.  We'll talk for 15 minutes.""

The B:  laughs.  ""Oh, you can squeeze me in for 15 minutes?""

Me:  ""No.  I don't like you.  15 minutes is the max time I am willing waste in a meeting with you.  At 5:30, my family is walking out the door for another time commitment.  Before 5pm I will be busy with other things.""

The B:  ""Oh.  OK.  I will be at your house at 5p sharp.""

Me:  ""OK.""  hang up.


The next day:

Bishop shows up at 5:13.  I invite him into a little office area we have in our house.  The kids are playing elsewhere so my wife stays with us.  He asks my wife if she will excuse us.  I tell him I want her to be there because I don't want any communication issues.  He asked me what my problem was with tithing.  I told him my problem wasn't related to specifically to tithing, I have issues with most of the teachings of the gospel.  Him snooping on my finances through past tithing settlement sheets was just the last straw.  I probably could have faked the good mormon for my wife for a few more months but this ship had already sailed.

He asked me about my issues.  I asked him if he accepted Jacob 5 to be the word of god.  He said he did.  I then said my issues with the church spring from the very seed of how it was begun.  The polygamy, polyandry, racism, commercial ventures, self-victimization, etc.  These are topics well-documented in books that contain the official history of the church and early talks by prophets and apostles.  I told him I was reading History of the Church and Journal of Discourses to gain a testimony of the early days and in the end, I realized it was all based on an elaborate web of lies.

He asked me how I got caught up in 'anti-Mormon' literature.  I told him that 100% of my research was done on History of the Church, Journal of Discourses and materials available on BYU.edu, and LDS.org. 

He mentioned that Journal of Discourses was not a part of official church scripture.  I pointed out the delusion of that response since prophets and apostles at the time of its release were very clear that Journal of Discourses ranked as a part of the standard works.

He said:  ""Well, um, you know, the gospel is, um, ever changing, um, that is why we have a church based on revelation.""

I said:  ""Do you really believe that god modifies the requirements for entry into the highest degree of the celestial kingdom? If there is anything that should be an eternal truth, wouldn't that be it?""

He asked me about my personal worthiness.  I told him the truth.  No WoW issues.  No law of chastity issues (unless you count staring at topless sunbathers while on vacation).  None of that.

He then pulls out the temple recommend I left on his desk when I walked out of tithing settlement.  He tells me if I want it back, he can work with me to rebuild my testimony.  I tell him the recommend has no value to me and I have no interest in returning to the temple.  He put it back in his ill-fitting suit.  (mini rant: Why do so many Mormons wear such ill-fitting suits?  Is it some sort of outward expression of humility?  ""Look at me.  I am so humble, I didn't want to pay $8 to have the sleeves of my suit hemmed up so they fit properly instead of looking like hand spats."")

He asked if he could share a quote with me.  He read a snippet from the Pride talk by Benson.  At this point, I realized I had been a member way too long.  I know the damn script better than they do.  So much for revelation.

I told him that I understand pride is the go-to when you don't want to accept education as a reason for someone leaving.  However, I am not struggling with a large pride issue.  Quite the contrary.  I find it humiliating that I have been so vocal, so condescending for so long to people who were struggling.  I used the church as a crutch for being a person of small character.  I thought being a member is what character was all about.  Instead, I marginalized the legitimate issues of others.  I used the gospel to place culpability where it did not belong.  I told him that I found it deeply and profoundly humiliating to have to admit my ignorance to others.  I have only told a few people about leaving and it was painful.  I have many more of those conversations coming up and I am dreading each and every one of them.  

He tried to get me to commit to reading the BoM and praying.  I told him I have read it dozens of times and prayed incessantly for months.  There was no answer.

I then informed him we were out of time and that he needed to leave.

He asked if we could pray together.  I told him I only pray as a measure of respect for the people I am praying with and declined his offer.

He left.

My wife was there the entire time and didn't say anything.  I didn't expect her to say anything but I wanted her there so she could see it first hand.

After he left, she said 'He really is a prick.'

Quick update on the family thing:

She went to church on Sunday with the kids.  My oldest enjoys going.  I helped get them ready.  She texted me during sacrament and asked me to come over and pick up the youngest.  He wasn't having it that day.  I picked him up and spent the morning playing trains.  

She is reading a few different books right now.  Rough Stone Rolling recently made it onto her nightstand.  She is keeping this study to herself.  We really haven't talked too much about it.  I expect that to change in the next weeks.  It feels like she is starting to want to talk about it.  She did ask me what I planned on doing with the money we used to send to the church for tithing.  I told her I hadn't thought much about it but I think charitable donations seemed like a good use.  She handles the money.  When the paycheck came in, she asked me where to send the charitable donation.  

Our marriage feels fine right now.  There didn't feel like there was any strain during our recent holiday.  Conversations seem normal and easy.  I think the first place I would notice a strain would be with intimacy issues.  I don't track that in Excel or anything but it doesn't feel like there has been a change in that area.  

I haven't gone to any other recovering mormon sites.  I stick to this one.  I don't feel angry at the church.  I don't feel a lot of what others have shared in this reddit relating to PTSD-type issues after leaving.  Maybe that has to do with the type of marriage I have and where I am in life.  I have a distant family and I don't live in the Mountain West.  Many of our good friends are not members so I don't feel the major social deconstruct that others describe.

There you have it.  Not much really.  I think this is the most boring story of leaving that has ever been shared here.  I will probably post again after my wife starts talking about her research;  maybe after I have to start talking with all of the family members.  I did make a decision to travel to each of my siblings' houses and my parents so I can tell them in person.

But now she has friends that are Mormon and they have introduced her to their church and she really really likes the church, thinks the people are great, has a wonderful time there, etc. I have no idea how she could believe in Joseph Smith's gold tablets and all that but she ""says"" that she does, she has prayed about it and ""feels it is true"". I was content with it at first, I was going to just let her do as she wished and it kind of gets me out of going to church every Sunday because I have stood my ground that I don't believe in Joseph Smith and never will. But I am not sure if this is the right way to go about this. I have attempted to show her a few articles and such that point to the negative things about Mormonism or question her about some of the oddities that they hold as beliefs but each time I try that, I am met with the ""You are just being negative and you can't find truth 'googling religion' if you have questions meet with the missionaries""

""I was at all three sessions of the Boise Temple dedication today. I felt really bad for President Monson. The first session everyone that was on the stand walked in a little late. They all sat down. President Monson went up to the mike and Elder Bednar and the two 70's present jumped up and whispered to him, apparently reminding him that he was not conducting the session. He sat down in one of the 70's chairs until his talk.

""But it was the last session that made me feel bad for him. Half way through his talk he really started to ramble. He went on and on about how much he loved the cultural events that precede the dedications. Then THREE times he told the same story of how the night before he had loved the dancing and twirling the youth did (and mimicked some motions) and how he had sat by two of the dancers who he thought made a cute couple. Since they looked cute together he told the boy to kiss the girl (Then he made kissing noises). He did this three times. Then he said that he loves playing matchmaker and he didn't know what would happen to the young couple from the night before but he felt inspired to tell them to kiss and they seemed to enjoy it. Then he said that his wife tells him not to flirt with the youth but last night she was not there to stop him. He also mentioned that some of the brethren do not like the cultural events but he loves them.

""The saddest part though was right at the end. He said twice that he assigned himself to this Temple Dedication, and then said that the reason why was that he really loves coming to ""Canada"" because it always feels like going home.

""I really felt bad for him. I was beginning to wonder if Elder Bednar would jump up and intervene somehow. It was quite sad.""",,False,self,t5_2r0gj,False,,,True,t3_13hs9w,http://www.reddit.com/r/exmormon/comments/13hs9w/report_on_monsons_dementia_at_the_boise_idaho/,

It's been a really difficult journey but fortunately I have a really amazing wife and she has helped me through it.

I think I'd like to figure out how to go easy on everyone else because I'm going from full steam to inactivity.  Naturally this is a pretty big bomb for the ward and I have no desire to mess with anyone else's happiness.  I have no bitter feelings and if anyone else finds it brings them happiness I think they are free to keep up the search for ""perfection"".

My reasons were that I'm a big liberal (democrat and social liberal), I've followed the church for the last 5-10 years based on philosophical justification (it helped me find my wife... I can't regret that) with only vague doubts and nagging issues I've ignored (polygamy and priesthood are hugely bothersome to me).  Over the Bush years, I was more and more uneasy with the churches stand on gay marriage.  How can a polygamist history not phase them but opposing other people's search for basic happiness is free game to be denied?  

The irony is so striking.  Remember that story that is told in church about how the early Utah saints hid their wives and buried the temple foundation and they made weapons to fight against the US army that marched into Utah (called the ""Utah War"" or something like that?). It was supposed to be heroic that they took a stand. Today Tea Party folks fight against the government meddling in their lives, forcing them to buy insurance and whatnot.  Meanwhile, the irony of denying gay folks marriage is completely lost on them. 

I've often wrestled with myself over the years with the question: If I had been a member of the church during the priesthood/race years, would I have had the courage to step out against the policy?  Well, here I am now.

It took a lot of courage though.  We have a lot to lose.  Not just a ward family but relatives, older parents that cling to the church for their only last hope in life, parents that lament over the death of a sibling several years ago and the church being their coping mechanism.

Why did I accept the bishopric calling being the liberal that I am?  I honestly love to serve people.  I like to accept people in all places in life and I like to be helpful.  I had this vain and foolish belief that maybe people would see my liberalism and feel ok to question their assumed conservativism. I've lived in accordance with the church so it didn't seem dishonest to support everyone.  

But it was becoming a serious burden on my wife too and it wasn't sustainable.

I went on a ward campout recently and felt bad that nobody knew and I didn't want to lose their friendships.  But on the ride home, with the kids in the back seat, we turned on some music and the car crested a hill and there was this amazing view of the valley below, the sun was out and the world seemed so much bigger.  Bigger in a glorious way.  There were shadows cast from the clouds and it fell on the trees, the orchards.  The song that turned on was ""Just a Dream"" (Nelly) and it's a typical breakup song but there is a sense of leaving, loss, but becoming reconciled with it while at the same time wondering what would have been different.

I felt something build in me.  This determination, a fierceness.  I had what I loved with me.  My kids, my wife.  I could go it alone. I didn't care.  I love them and I'd fight off the whole world for them.  They'll have everything I had, and so much more.  Freedom from guilt and repression.  Instead a wonder for life and the new miracle. The miracle that we are here, art and beauty that led us to this place, and I don't want to be anywhere else.",,False,self,t5_2r0gj,False,,,True,t3_x0zzc,http://www.reddit.com/r/exmormon/comments/x0zzc/released_from_bishopric/,

Despite the freshness of my account, I've been lurking on this subreddit for a few weeks. And I wanted to say a big ""thanks"" to all of you. You have had a big impact on my wife's life, and so on mine also.

I feel a little out of place because I am not now nor have I ever been a Mormon. But I married one over 10 years ago. And I supported my wife's decision to be active, and then her more recent decision to go inactive and to now effectively leave the church.

First, I wanted to speak up and reiterate that you guys ARE having a major positive effect on rational questioning Mormons. My wife discovered this subreddit before I did, and has lurked avidly here for several weeks (she doesn't post on reddit, she just reads). In fact, she's probably reading this very message (hi Honey!). She has been struggling with doubts for a while but thanks to this subreddit she has found the strength and vision to follow her heart. And aside from some residual anger about being lied to for years, she feels very good about her decision to shed the religion she was raised in, and relieved there are others like her. And that makes me very happy. It's wonderful to see her find her voice and use her wonderful intelligence to analyze the church and put its many flaws n perspective.

I am convinced that for every person who speaks up and shares their story here, there are 5, 10, 20... who knows how many others who are silently being enlightened and finding strength and freedom to escape from the guilt of their upbringing. All thanks to you courageous people!

Second, I feel like I'm in kind of a unique position. I'm an outsider, but I've got to know many Mormons (most really nice, some weird, some total assholes, just like any group in society). That includes most of my in-laws (who despite their fanatical faiths are definitely at the 'really nice' end of the scale). Also, I've seen the religion's impact on both adults and kids over the span of a decade or so (not pretty!). I was married in a Mormon church. I used to attend sacrament meetings with my wife (until I finally got pissed off with the old assholes from the stake spouting ridiculously intolerant crap about other religions, atheists, etc.). I've had to listen to untold rambling and absurd testimonies, see people revel in ignorance and attack science with seriously flawed armaments, hear loads of little kids ""bury"" their testimony with a parent hovering at their shoulder telling them exactly what to say (oh God those were cringe-worthy!). And I've been hounded by missionaries, despite my wife constantly telling her ward that I would never join and they should leave me alone (what can I say, I married an amazing woman!).

And in all those experiences the church has always seemed flawed and slightly creepy to me. But I felt like I was the only one who wasn't buying it. Was there something wrong with me? Was the emperor really wearing new clothes?! It is so great to know my judgement wasn't off; to know that lots of people who were raised in the church also shared my misgivings about it. So thank you for that as well.

Please keep up the good fight! It's not just your passion and your conviction that makes this such a great place. It's also the objectiveness, the politeness and the adherence to citations and good information sources.

Thanks.


TL;DR: you guys helped my wife break free, and helped me put the LDS church in perspective. You guys rock!

Along with advocating a women be always pregnant, some other take home messages are:

* Every one of a woman's eggs (or 'germ') is intended to be fertilised
* God didn't intend for young women to have periods, that's wasteful, she's designed to get pregnant as soon as she is capable

Hope is a very hard thing to extinguish.  TSCC gives people hope regardless of its history.  TSCC gives people purpose regardless of its homophobia.  TSCC gives people community regardless of any GA's who might resign.

[emphasis mine]

&gt;&gt; December 15, 1969 

&gt;&gt; To General Authorities, Regional Representatives of the Twelve, Stake Presidents, Mission Presidents, and Bishops. 

&gt;&gt; Dear Brethren: 

... 

&gt;&gt; The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints owes its origin, its existence, and its hope for the future to the principle of continuous revelation. “We believe all that God has revealed, all that He does now reveal, and we believe that He will yet reveal many great and important things pertaining to the Kingdom of God.” 

&gt;&gt; **From the beginning of this dispensation, Joseph Smith and all succeeding presidents of the Church have taught that Negroes, while spirit children of a common Father, and the progeny of our earthly parents Adam and Eve, were not yet to receive the priesthood, for reasons which we believe are known to God, but which He has not made fully known to man.**

&gt;&gt; Our living prophet, President David O. McKay, has said, “The seeming discrimination by the Church toward the Negro is not something which originated with man; but goes back into the beginning with God…. 

&gt;&gt; “Revelation assures us that this plan antedates man’s mortal existence, extending back to man’s pre-existent state.” 

&gt;&gt; President McKay has also said, “Sometime in God’s eternal plan, the Negro will be given the right to hold the priesthood.” 

&gt;&gt; Until God reveals His will in this matter, to him whom we sustain as a prophet, we are bound by that same will. Priesthood, when it is conferred on any man comes as a blessing from God, not of men. 

&gt;&gt; We feel nothing but love, compassion, and the deepest appreciation for the rich talents, endowments, and the earnest strivings of our Negro brothers and sisters. We are eager to share with men of all races the blessings of the Gospel. We have no racially-segregated congregations. 

&gt;&gt; **Were we the leaders of an enterprise created by ourselves and operated only according to our own earthly wisdom, it would be a simple thing to act according to popular will. But we believe that this work is directed by God and that the conferring of the priesthood must await His revelation. To do otherwise would be to deny the very premise on which the Church is established.**

&gt;&gt; **We recognize that those who do not accept the principle of modern revelation may oppose our point of view. We repeat that such would not wish for membership in the Church, and therefore the question of priesthood should hold no interest for them.** Without prejudice they should grant us the privilege afforded under the Constitution to exercise our [p.224] chosen form of religion just as we must grant all others a similar privilege. They must recognize that the question of bestowing or withholding priesthood in the Church is a matter of religion and not a matter of Constitutional right. 

...

&gt;&gt; Faithfully your brethren,

&gt;&gt;The First Presidency



&gt;&gt; By Hugh B. Brown

And from the new header to the Book of Mormon.

&gt;&gt; “Book of Mormon teaches that ‘all are alike unto God,’ including ‘black and white, bond and free, male and female’ (2 Nephi 26:33). Throughout the history of the Church, people of every race and ethnicity in many countries have been baptized and have lived as faithful members of the Church. During Joseph Smith’s lifetime, a few black male members of the Church were ordained to the priesthood. **Early in its history, Church leaders stopped conferring the priesthood on black males of African descent. Church records offer no clear insights into the origins of this practice.** Church leaders believed that a revelation from God was needed to alter this practice and prayerfully sought guidance. The revelation came to Church President Spencer W. Kimball and was affirmed to other Church leaders in the Salt Lake Temple on June 1, 1978. The revelation removed all restrictions with regards to race that once applied to the priesthood.”


----

There you have it.   In 1969, the LDS church claimed the practice was instituted by God, at the beginning of the dispensation, directly from Joseph Smith.   This was while the Ban was in effect.  

A little more than 3 decades later and the first presidency letter is forgotten entirely.  Pushed into the memory whole.  Now it is claimed ""Church records offer no clear insights into the origin of the practice.""

[Liar, Liar, Pants on fire](http://ldsliberty.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/honesty_mormon_ad1.jpg)

----

**PS**: This 1969 letter claims not to know the reasons behind the Black Ban, just when it started.  That was also a lie.  

See the [**August 17, 1949 First Presidency letter**](http://en.fairmormon.org/Mormonism_and_racial_issues/Blacks_and_the_priesthood/Statements) which states, ""The attitude of the Church with reference to Negroes remains as it has always stood. **It is not a matter of the declaration of a policy but of direct commandment from the Lord**, on which is founded the doctrine of the Church from the days of its organization, to the effect that Negroes may become members of the Church but that they are not entitled to the priesthood at the present time. The prophets of the Lord have made several statements as to the operation of the principle. President Brigham Young said: 'Why are so many of the inhabitants of the earth cursed with a skin of blackness? It comes in consequence of their fathers rejecting the power of the holy priesthood, and the law of God. They will go down to death. And when all the rest of the children have received their blessings in the holy priesthood, then that curse will be removed from the seed of Cain, and they will then come up and possess the priesthood, and receive all the blessings which we now are entitled to.'

And let me tell you: beer is like an enchanted talisman that wards off member missionaries.  It's incredible!

Last night I looked across the restaurant and groaned when I saw a Mormon couple wave at me.  They approached my table, but as soon as they saw my mug of double IPA their eyes widened, and they aborted the mission as quickly as they initiated it.  It was great, they just politely waved and careened in a different direction.

My friend, who I'll call John, and his mother, Jane, were baptized. This was largely because of me and my family, who are good friends with his. A few months later, after I came to my senses and left the TSCC, he noticed me drinking coffee and asked about it. I told him that I didn't believe in the church anymore, as it ""wasn't for me,"" and left it at that. 

Now fast forward to today. John went to the temple and got his endowments. When he stopped by to talk to my family, during a conversation about the temple, I mentioned that the ceremonies were online. He seemed surprised at this, and brought it up when we were later alone. I told him that some people had taken cameras in and filmed it. After a few quiet moments, he asked why I didn't believe in the church anymore. I gave him some vague, offhanded statements, but he pressed further. I proceeded to tell him about Smith's several wives, the Book of Abraham, and the historical issues with the Book of Mormon. At each reveal he was further surprised, meekly giving vague, defensive statements. At this point my mother walked in, so we changed topics, and later left. 

Now, just an hour ago, my mother just received a text from Jane telling her that I was no longer welcome at their house, and to stay away from John. At this point my parents confronted me and told me how I had ruined what was supposed to have been a beautiful day for him, that I should be ashamed for trying to destroy a new convert's testimony. I explained that he had come to me, and that only truths left my lips, but apparently I should have kept quiet and not said anything that would harm his precious testimony. Then my father told me that an enemy of the church won't be welcome in his house, and to never say anything that could damage a testimony, or I would need to find a new place to live. 

So I just made Jane hate me, almost had to find a new home, and possibly lost a dear friend. Fuck those old white men and the stranglehold they have on all these good people.

Edit: I forgot to mention that John is leaving on a mission in a month, which just makes everything worse.

UPDATE: I just talked to John, everything is good with him, and he is embarrassed his mother overreacted like she did.

I’m a 16 year old TBM, but I find myself frustrated by many of my leaders in church and by things said in lessons. 

I am attracted to the church’s optimistic worldview, and I appreciate that it has given me not only a strong sense of discipline but also separated me from some of the less savoury qualities of American commercialism. That’s not why I go to church though, I go to find the truth.  

Reading through these posts, I find that 90% make intelligent and reasonable arguments. A lot of posts criticise church culture, and others make convincing arguments against church doctrine. Through our isolated and hypnopaedic childhoods I think the Church has made us all good thinkers. 

Unfortunately, the more I search the more I realise that the Holy Spirit seems to be fuelled on confirmation bias and my own imagination. Keep asking, keep praying, keep reading; eventually you’ll feel something! I’ve lied to myself as a kid; I know I’ve made up spiritual fantasies and “revelations from God”, and frankly the faith that encourages kids to do that strikes me as disgusting. 

My Dad is a bishop, and I’ve had some good, genuine conversations with him about this. He is the only reason I’ve hung on this long. He agrees with nearly everything I say, even that the “spirit” can sometimes just be ourselves, but he still encourages me to seek further.

* Disturbing things started to accumulate on our ""shelves"" over several years.
* Switched to the ""new order Mormon"" aka cafeteria Mormon approach for a time.
* Our parental and human obligation to our kids caused us to start thoroughly examining items on our shelves.
* After approx a year of heavy research we concluded that the church wasn't true and asked for release from callings (I was in the Bishopric) in May of this year and stopped attending church.
* In late Sept my wife and I sent letters to nearly all our family, extended family and a few friends who are mostly TBM. A couple dozen letters. My letter was 6 pages and my wife's letter 8 pages.
* Through the grape vine we heard that there was heavy gossip in ward about us.
* Concluded that if they were going to gossip, they might as well hear from us first hand. 
* Oct 17th -- Sent email resignation to LDS membership records. We asked to waive any waiting periods.
* Also on Oct 17th -- Sent copies of family letters to about twenty families in the ward using this [cover letter](http://i.imgur.com/NphEg.jpg). To be respectful, we enclosed our family letters inside of an separate envelope that they could choose to open if they wished.
* Oct 18th -- Received [confirmation letter](http://i.imgur.com/Jcv5A.jpg) from LDS membership records. Very fast turnaround on their part!
* About a week later Bishop called. He asked to meet. I explained that legally we were out, but I'd be happy to talk to him.
* A couple weeks later he came by our home and met with my wife and I. We gave him a signed copy of the email we sent. We talked about an hour. He was respectful. He did offer to bring Marlin K. Jensen (emeritus general authority and former Church Historian) to our home. I declined saying that I'd read his letter to the European Area Authority and was well versed in the best apologetic answers and didn't feel that he'd be able to tell me something new.
* About three weeks later we received this [letter from the Bishop](http://i.imgur.com/4xjxB.jpg)
* Today we received these [confirmation letters](http://i.imgur.com/MqLde.jpg). My son was disappointed his letter wasn't in the mailbox -- maybe Monday it'll be there.

1349892965.0,76,self.exmormon,119ibe,"My bishop told me that he had had a lesbian dream about me, among other things.  My family has never said that was wrong",85,9,50,http://www.reddit.com/r/exmormon/comments/119ibe/my_bishop_told_me_that_he_had_had_a_lesbian_dream/,"So I haven't gone to church in many years, I’m super happy with it, but  I still feel angry that I was lied to, but I also still hold anger towards how I was treated as a young lady by my bishop and how my family reacted to it, even to this day.  This seems like a good place to get it out, so here we go!

From the time I was 16-22, my bishop, who was probably in his mid 30's, gave me a creepy vibe. I'm kind of busty, and in attempts to be modest, I always wore cami's under my shirts to cover my cleavage.  My family sat in the front and during sacrament meetings, he would constantly signal for me to pull up my cami. Like, at least once a week. It happened so often that my sister asked my mom why the bishop had a weird obsession with me.  

When I went to college, (which was only 30 min away from my hometown) I majored in Theatre Ed. This was about the time I started really questioning the church, but I kept up appearances for my family.  One day out of the blue he called me to come to his house.  It sounded urgent, so I went.  When I got there he told me that he thought I should change my major.  He had received revelation through a dream.  He then told me he had a dream that I had accepted a role for a play, and had to meet in a room for rehearsal.  When I arrived, it was just me and another girl in a dark room with a camera.  Then a man would tell us to do sexual things to each other through a speaker.  At this point he assured me that he didn't see anything, he just knew there were sexual things being requested.  He thought that dream was revelation that I should change my major from theatre ed.

I didn’t really say anything I was shocked.  I kept thinking “I can't believe my bishop just told me he had a lesbian sex dream about me.”  

When I told my mom what had happened, she just said ""well that was weird"" and that was pretty much it.  She is the queen of denial. 

When I was about 22, I had my last ever experience with that man.  My mother was the young women's president, and although I had become inactive, she asked me to help her with a young women's activity, so I did.  

When the bishop saw me, he called me into his office.  He proceeded to interview me, even though I didn’t want a temple recommend, and I didn’t request an interview.  Yet, here I was, alone with that creepy man allowing him to ask me super personal questions, and then answering them!  He asked if I drank, I said yes, he asked if I smoked, I said no. Then he mentioned my long time boyfriend.  My TBM conscience in the past had moved me to confess to some hard core make out sessions with my bf in high school.  Of course, he had asked for details, (clothes on or off?  lying down?  Rubbing private areas, so on) but there just really wasn't much to tell.  But my boyfriend and I had recently had sex and so when he asked if I had stayed morally clean, I truthfully said no.  Then he asked a series of sexually explicit questions, wanting to know all kinds of details, I can't even remember what exactly he asked, but I told him that we had been together with our clothes off, that we had touched each other, I can’t remember everything, but I answered his questions, but finally, my brain yelled at me ""you don't have to tell him anything!"" At that point I told him I didn’t need to be interviewed that I didn't have a testimony, that I was just helping my mother and wasn't interested in returning to church. When I was done, I left his office and cried in the parking lot until my mother came to the car.  I told her all about it on the way home (I left out the part where I admitted to sexual immorality), but still was able to tell her many of the questions he had asked.  

She said she too had thought he was a little weird, but that she thought he was a homosexual and was trying to cover it up, and really liked me because ""I'm so open to homosexuallity"".  I think she developed this theory because of the lesbian dream incident, but she has never acknowledged that the bishop was inappropriate towards me.

To this day I feel slightly violated.  Bishops hold a certain level of power, I was taught they receive revelation for you, that you can trust them, and you should always be honest with them, that they are the father of the ward.  I was mad at myself for not abandoning those beliefs immediately when I discovered the church was untrue. Instead I let myself be but in a position for him to use his power over me to make me tell him things that I wouldn't have told my own sisters.  The fact that a grown man is allowed to ask a teenage girl/ young adult to come into his office, alone, and then ask her to describe her sexual acts in detail is sick.  That he can tell her he received a “revelation” (aka sex dream) for her and she should change her major.  Its so messed up.

My family (parents and grandparents) have heard these same stories, and to this day, no one, besides my sister, has ever validated my feeling that he was super fucking creepy and inappropriate.  So I thought this subreddit would give me a little validation.

So sorry that was super long, but thanks for letting me get it out, and thanks for being a support system for life after mormonism!

TL:DR When I was 16-22, my bishop was super creepy all the time, always told me to cover my cleavage, asked super detailed questions about my sexual experiences in interviews, and told me he had received revelation for my life through a lesbian sex dream.

EDIT: Thanks for the support everyone!  I just needed to get my story out there.  And yes, I'm doing so much better now!  I feel happy, at peace, and not so angry and the church (although I did begin to feel some residual rage while writing this).  And I'm still with the boyfriend.  We are getting married  next year!

The couple was not even Mormon - a fact that makes them even more noble and heroic because they potentially risked life and limb for something they did not believe in. And yet the LDS church has never even thanked them --  in public or in private. 

Turns out the couple was a couple of males. Apparently, the church did not want to publicize the heroic deeds of a gay couple since it runs counter to their message.

1339525997.0,79,self.exmormon,uycgt,"A guide to member communication, for the exmormon",92,13,16,http://www.reddit.com/r/exmormon/comments/uycgt/a_guide_to_member_communication_for_the_exmormon/,"Please feel free to add, but here are some of the central things I've learned on this journey that have made being surrounded by ultra TBM's livable.  Please note, this list is the flip of my ""communication to the exmormon"" post on /r/lds, and thus everything here is designed to smooth communication with loved ones.  Feel free to ignore if you want to troll, but if you want a good conversation, these pointers have, at least, helped me.

** Realize that anything you say is already threatening**

*Why it hurts* - The member has been taught any number of things, and paid attention to any number of them, about exmormons.  This can range from that you are misled, to that you are actively demon possessed.  Just saying ""hi"" can be a threatening experience.  Finding out what they expect of you can be very helpful in disarming the situation.

*Reverse* - If you walk into a conversation assuming the member is brainwashed, you're going to feel similarly threatened, and probably respond in a similar manner.  Give everyone you meet the benefit of the doubt.

*What is better to say* - Phrases like, ""No matter what we both believe, I still respect you."" and ""I can tell you care about me, I care about you too."", ""Thank you for sharing your testimony, I can appreciate how much it means to you"", ""I always am interested in other people's perspectives"", and ""I value your opinion"" can do tons to remove the **Fight or flight** response that is caused by feeling threatened.  You are less likely to be accused, attacked, and ignored if you can disarm the situation.

**Ask what they consider to be doctrine**

*Why this helps* - Knowing what is doctrine will prevent accidental toe-stepping.  For example, if they reject the Journal of Discourses, then quoting it is going to get you labelled anti-mormon or hateful.  If they only believe that doctrine is over-the-pulpit, at conference from the prophet himself, that's fine; and then you know not to quote things that will make them uncomfortable.

*Reverse* - Imagine if a member asked you what you considered good evidence, and then allowed you to explain logical fallacy, the peer review process and how one shouldn't trust authorities paid by an organization without interrupting.  It would be a lot like that.

**Ask what the member considers to be anti-mormon**

*Why it helps* - Mostly because members completely become tongue tied when they have to define doctrine, I'll happily move to this side of the equation.  Again, I state that I don't want to offend, so please, let me know what is allowed in conversation and I'll stick to it.  Most members relax when presented with this option compared to the first, which they may feel is a trap.  

*Reverse* - Again, imagine the member saying, ""Please, let me know if anything I says makes you uncomfortable or a commit one of those logical fallacies you mentioned a few minutes ago.  I want you to enjoy this conversation"".  It's like that.

**Ask the member ""If the church was false, would you want to know it?""**

*Why it helps* - First of all, anyone who says ""no"" to this question is probably not going to listen to anything else you have to say.  Their minds are made up, and no evidence is going to persuade.  Second, most members haven't ever even considered this question.  Simply considering it greatly increases the chance that they consider other information.  Third, if they answer yes, then odds are the conversation will not simply be an attack on you.

*Reverse* - ""If I could prove to you there really was an afterlife with an all loving God, would you give up all your sins to know?""  I honestly think every one of us would answer yes to this question.  That if there was proof-positive that things were going to be okay, we'd want to know about it.  But that claim would require extraordinary evidence, sure.. but we'd want to try and prove or disprove it.  Maybe not everyone, but many.  

*The better way to say it* - ""I would like to share with you some facts I've learned.  These are meaningful to me and my life.  Would you consider them, even if they were contrary to the teachings of the church leadership?""

**""You seem like an interesting person who is open to trying new things""**

*Why it helps*-  This is a magical line.  It disarms a person almost completely, and makes them want to learn what you know.  They instantly want to fulfill this badge of respect.  Here's the catch.  It MUST be thrown in during a conversation that has nothing to do with the church.  Some may see this as a trick to fool a TBM into listening, but that isn't my purpose here.  My purpose is to disarm a possibly damaging conversation, and this does that by helping the person want to open up to new ideas.  

*Reverse* - it is the reverse.  For members to use this on non-members and ex-members is totally legit.  A more opened-minded society is not a bad thing.

**""I value your opinion""**

*Why it helps* - even if you aren't going to follow their opinion, or trust their sources, letting them know that what they say is valuable to you as a person helps a situation.  DO NOT SAY WITH SNARK or SARCASM, it will backfire heavily.

*Reverse* - Again, this is a good tool for both sides.  Nothing wrong with letting someone know they are a valuable person.

**I know how busy your life is right now, thank you for taking time with me**

*Why it helps* - again, just a good phrase to let the person know you appreciate them.  You may hate that they showed up with 10 volumes of church history and a dictionary, but acknowledging that they put effort into you never hurts a relationship.

*Reverse* - both sides can use this phrase too.

**""Your church is a cult"", ""You're all brainwashed"", ""Mormons are stupid""**

*Why it hurts* - it simplifies a very complex belief system into something harmful and damaging

*Reverse* - This is similar to ""Exmormons leave because they want to sin""

*A better statement*- ""I'm afraid that some of the practices of the church could harm you and your family.  I care about you deeply.  Can we discuss some of the harmful behaviors I see?""

**Joseph Smith is a con-man/adulterer/treasure seeker**

*Why it hurts* - This is a man that many members revere quite deeply and look upon almost as deity.  It would be like someone saying the same thing about your best friend, that you're sure isn't any of those things.  You have evidence that your friend is honest, other people tell you he's honest, and you feel that you need to defend that position.  It places you as an attacker, and draws the line of ""Us"" vs. ""Them"" with you on the wrong side.

*Reverse* - ""I know, with every fiber of my being, that Joseph Smith is a Prophet"".  Yes, you may have evidence; but the member considers their feelings as just as valid evidence as any D. Michael Quinn book.  The feeling of ""Evidence"" is just as strong, and it's just about as aggressive a statement on either side.

*A better way to say this* - Ask to read history with the member.  Read what Joseph said/did.  Ask their opinion on what he said/did.  Let them tell you why or why not that would be harmful/good/bad/permitted by god, etc.  Look up further details on anything that they claim that they are unsure of.  This takes a lot more time, but that time put into it will be appreciated.

**The apostles are all liars, The Correlation committe is hiding the truth, Boyd K. Packer twists history, Gordon B. Hinkley hides history, etc.**

*Why it hurts* - when Bernie Madoff was arrested, everyone who invested in him was shocked.  Friends called and told each other.  The initial reaction was almost always aggressive against the dear friend who was presenting the news, even if the person receiving the news had never actually met Madoff.  Even with good evidence, it typically took a long time for friends to reconcile that they had lost everything and the person on the phone telling them this was doing it to help them.

Accusing the beloved general authorities of fraud is a lot like informing your friend of Bernie Madoff's scam.  Bernie just had fewer apologists excusing why he went to prison.  They are not going to accept your points, they'll defend their leaders, and they will grasp an any straw of evidence that their future is still there.

This is a very difficult point to get across. 

*Reverse* - This is hard, because typically exmormons don't have a leadership base quite the same way.  Imagine though that a news report came out that actually proved that Richard Dawkins, Sam Harris, and Christopher Hitchens not only signed a pact with the devil, but the Pope had been in on the same deal the whole time.  And the evidence that everyone who had ever listened to them was going to hell, forever.  That's how this feels.

*How to say it better* - Again, sit down with them.  Express you have some concerns because of evidence.  Present the evidence.  Ask their emotions after each piece of evidence and take time to talk through it.  Learn their concerns.  Probably most will not want to hear it to the point that they stop talking to you.  Possibly for a long time.  This is painful and difficult, but realize that it is this way with anyone who is caught in any kind of con.  People will spend $250,000, their entire life savings, after spending $3,000 with a con, rather than admit they were had by a con for that first $3k.

*Notes: Be gentle, realize that discussing these things is very threatening; and people react badly when threatened.  Disarm the situation, share, listen, love.*",,False,self,t5_2r0gj,1339532212.0,,,True,t3_uycgt,http://www.reddit.com/r/exmormon/comments/uycgt/a_guide_to_member_communication_for_the_exmormon/,

2. When pressed she explained to the VT supervisor that we could not accept the history which was written about the founders of the so called church.

3. When the wife of fa1thless did confess these things to fa1thless he was well pleased but cautioned unto his wife that after the next Sunday should pass the so called church would send agents to beseech us that we should change our ways.

4. However fa1thless' prophecy did not come to pass for 3rd day past the confession at the hour of 8:30 in the evening a knock did cometh to the door of the house of fa1thless.

5. Fa1thless peered through the peephole and saw 3 personages with suit and tie standing there. 

6. Fa1thless tried to sneak away but caught the eye of one of the personages peering through the window of fa1thless.

7. And it came to pass that the doorbell of Fa1thless was rung and Fa1thless having his wife just put the baby to bed did openeth the door.

8. Two of personages introduced themselves to me by elder and their last name from the ward, whist the third was introduced as the mission president.

9. And it came to pass that Fa1thless did call out to them that he hopethed that they had not waken the sleeping baby.

10. And it came to pass that the men were not shaken by Fa1thlesses'  frustration, **that they were visiting the ward list** and  should come in to share a Christmas message with Fa1thless and his family.

11. At a loss for words Fa1thless declined weakly stating he had to finish eating his snack and also declined an invitation to reschedule.

12. Upon conferring with his wife Fa1thless was chastised for not being stout enough to tell them off harsher.

13. After a while of conversing with his wife Fa1thless realized that he had falsified all of his information from the ward directory and limited his address that could not be edited to ward leadership only.

14. The wife of Fa1thless could not believe that the missionaries would come on false pretenses.

15. Then the house of Fa1thless commenced in all matters of jovial laughter.

tl;dr it took only 3 days since the wife opened up to someone in the ward for the church rumor mill to get not only the elders but the freaking mission president at our house, ringing the doorbell at 830 at night...

We waited that whole year after douche's baptism and did the prep classes. We endured the bishop interview which was awesome bc I was not a virgin when I got married.
I had to give details of how extensive my pre-marital sex life was and was put on an unofficial probation. After a couple of months of 100% attendance and tithing, my bishop gave me the ok to proceed. 
Then I was onto the stake prezzy interview. I was asked if I had ever had premarital sex. 
""We'll yes, with my husband. But I cleared that up with the bishop.""
Oooohhhh nonononoNO! No ma'am, I had to clear it up with HIM if I wanted to avoid being exed, let alone be allowed into the temple. He then proceeded to ask me very intimate questions. Had i ever performed oral sex? had it performed on me? with whom? Did I do anal? Did I have a threesome? How often did we have sex? Ever in public? Did we mutually masturbate? Did I ever masturbate? Etc, etc. it was singularly THE most embarrassed I have ever been in my life. (Answers: yah, ohhh yes, i have to count?, yep, nope, as much as possible given that were 19 at the time, define ""public"", yeah boy, you betcha!, etc, etc)

Anyhoot..he finally deemed my sins purged and continued with the torture/interview. I asked about garments and when is it ok to take them off. 

SP: ""Oh, I only take my garments off when I'm showering.""
Me: ""What ummmmm about during sex?""
SP: ""Nope! I leave them on! I just pull the bottoms down around my ankles. I never let them touch the floor. That's purely a personal choice though.""

o_O

He reminded me that our conversation was strictly privileged and to not discuss these matters, even with my then-husband. Naturally I told my ex everything. He wasn't asked about premarital sex AT ALL. Awe.some.

April 19, 2013, the Boy Scouts of America announced a proposal to no longer deny membership to youth on the basis of sexual orientation, but maintain its ban on openly gay adult leaders. The LDS church released a statement in support of the proposal stating that ""Sexual orientation has not previously been—and is not now—a disqualifying factor"".  This is bold faced revision of history.

**Why this should matter to a current member of the church:**

Because they are asking you to forget their crimes of bigotry and switch your brain to ""they never discriminated"" even when is good evidence that they did it readily available.  This illustrates how the church manipulates history in order to paint itself differently as the morals of the world change.

It is no question that The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church), a longtime supporter of the Boy Scouts of America, teaches that homosexual activity is immoral. 

The LDS Church is the largest single sponsor of Scouting units with over 30,000 units nationwide, which comprise about 13% of BSA's youth members
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boy_Scouts_of_America_membership_controversies

In 2000, an attorney representing the LDS church stated that ""The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints ... **[would withdraw from Scouting](http://www.bsa-discrimination.org/html/lds-2000.html)** if it were compelled to accept openly homosexual Scout leaders"".  Now they still have not permitted homosexual leaders, just boy scouts.  But where do scout leaders come from?  oh yeah, they serve as boy scouts. 

**Tim Curran was an idea scout, leader of his patrol.  When he tried to become a scoutmaster he was banned** and [sued the Boy Scouts over it](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curran_v._Mount_Diablo_Council_of_the_Boy_Scouts_of_America).  This idea that a boy is just fine until the day he gains his eagle, and then suddenly he is no longer fit to serve is unjustified.  ([more about Tim's case](http://www.timcurran.com/scouting/) )

The BSA made the change to the regulations about homosexual scouts after conducting a survey the council sent to its members, four out of five Scout leaders and parents said they're opposed to lifting the ban on gays. About 4,700 adults responded to the survey, which the council shared with the Boy Scouts. Nearly half of the respondents said they would quit the Boy Scouts if the ban on gays is lifted.

Harold Brown, once spokesman for the church said: that *no amount of press coverage or activism is going to influence God to change the rules about homosexuality*. Brown said: ""Being black is not a sin...Being immoral is."" 

What's interesting is the parallel.  Once, being black was considered being a sin.  General Authorities taught that the black man (and boy) was black because he had been less faithful prior to this earth life.

[July 18, 1974, the Salt Lake Tribune](http://newspaperarchive.com/salt-lake-tribune/1974-07-18/page-51) reported:
""A 12-year-old boy scout has been denied a senior patrol leadership in his troop because he is black"", Don L. Cope, black ombudsman for the state, said Wednesday.""  

Now the church states that ""It is unknown when or why such a policy was put in place [Blacks not being worthy]."" But that is just a demonstrably a cover for statements from leaders at that time such as: 

&gt;""[I think I have read enough to give you an idea of what the Negro is after](http://www.mormonthink.com/blackweb.htm). He is not just seeking the opportunity of sitting down in a cafe where white people eat. He isn't just trying to ride on the same streetcar or the same Pullman car with white people. It isn't that he just desires to go to the same theater as the white people. From this, and other interviews I have read, it appears that the Negro seeks absorption with the white race. He will not be satisfied until he achieves it by intermarriage. That is his objective and we must face it. We must not allow our feelings to carry us away, nor must we feel so sorry for Negroes that we will open our arms and embrace them with everything we have. Remember the little statement that we used to say about sin, ""First we pity, then endure, then embrace""
-Mark E. Peterson

You see, it is the practice of the church to state they have never done a thing that it is easy to find they not only did, but to some extent still do.  This kind of history rewrite is called **""whitewashing""** and according to current church manuals, it is [dishonest](http://www.lds.org/manual/gospel-principles/chapter-31-honesty?lang=eng)

Active members know the five steps of repentance, they know that the church should feel remorse and try to make restitution to those it wronged.  Further they know that if one takes to cover one's sins it is **""Amen to the priesthood of that man""**.  Perhaps to an organization, after all [corporations are people](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E2h8ujX6T0A)

The LDS church claims that they have nothing against people who are gay as long as they live lives of celibacy, at the same time they also use [fast offering funds](http://utahboysranchwra.wordpress.com/2012/05/29/the-church-of-jesus-christ-of-latter-day-saints-directly-supports-west-ridge-academy/) to send gay boys to [reformation camps](http://utahboysranchwra.wordpress.com/2012/05/30/the-mormon-church-of-jesus-christ-of-latter-day-saints-provides-oversight-at-west-ridge-academy-4/) supported by [BYU commercials](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15D8J3WIlXU&amp;feature=relmfu) and the [prophet in conference](http://www.lds.org/ldsorg/v/index.jsp?vgnextoid=2354fccf2b7db010VgnVCM1000004d82620aRCRD&amp;locale=0&amp;sourceId=6bf3dbdcc370c010VgnVCM1000004d82620a____)

The flagrant abuse of the LDS church in standing against homosexuals in the BSA is so obvious that even, Penn and Teller, magicians, discuss the involvement of the Mormon Church in the BSA and even quote Thomas Monson (warning: language)
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndoP1YW72Zk#t=8m09s

**The LDS faith is trying to put one over on its members with the above statement**.  It is as deceptive as the statements over blacks and the priesthood in the recent (2013) changes to the scriptures.  It is as deceptive as their videos on the Prophet Joseph Smith, only showing him and Emma together.

It is a modern-day rewrite of history happening right now; where soon you, the active member, can find yourself opposing homosexuality, and on the wrong side of the church, because the church is sweeping members with beliefs like yours, beliefs taught by the church, away with broad generalized statements and revisions without telling the general membership what is really going on.

This IS that history that you may have said in times past, ""I don't care about history, I have a testimony"".  That attitude could quickly end you up confused and wondering what happened.

(rant),88,13,47,http://www.reddit.com/r/exmormon/comments/1cchz3/lets_not_overreact_or_anything_rant/,"So I used to be a part of this subredditt(under a different username) but then I decided I was happily living my exmormon life without the constant reminder of what I left. So I decided to just carry on normally. It was amazing, being absolutely free. UNTIL I had to move back in with my mormon parents for the summer. God Fucking Damn it. 

There's lots of problem with that but what I came here to rant about is Coffee.

I went out to brunch with my mom yesterday, it was very lovely and I asked her if I could have coffee, if it would bother her. She said no, cause it's just *coffee*, I'm not shooting up right there in front of her. But apparently she cried about it later. My dad approached me and said that: 

""I need to have respect for my mom"" and ""I'm defiantly flaunting my choices in front of her""

**what the hell**

I drank coffee. It is the most minute detail of my entire existence, and they're crying about it. I can't even explain the complete absurdness of this situation. I swear I live with parent-children. I shield them from more things in the world than vice versa, and they wonder why I absolutely **hate** living at home. 

My mom and I already had the discussion about how I feel I can't be myself around her and we had come to a consensus that we both need to relax and just become re-acquainted with each other since we are both different now. I don't think she understood me exactly, because *this is what I was talking about*, the complete lack of freedom even over the tiny things in my life. 

Good Lord. 
Sorry for the length. Just needed to vent.

Anachronisms in the Book of Mormon are just rejected outright as unimportant and explainable (I somewhat agree in this - a lack of current explanation does not preclude future explanations).

Tonight's conversation stemmed from the fact that she needed a blessing last week as she was feeling quite ill. It started with her asking how I could have participated in giving and receiving so many blessings in my time, and now believe it is nothing but comforting words and placebo effect. I tried to explain that in my years of giving blessings I have never felt guided at all in my words. She responded that that doesn't mean it isn't true, and that God could have been the author of the placebo effect anyway. She then started questioning me about spiritual experiences I've had, especially on my mission.

I told her that I did have many spiritual experiences on my mission, and I cannot explain all of them now. The memories have long since been merged with my retellings of them, so I cannot really be sure of the events themselves. Besides that, spiritual experiences are felt globally by people of all faiths: Mormons, Muslims, Hindus, Catholics, everyone has spiritual experiences. These therefore cannot be used to show that *this church* is true.

This is where I think she started to really understand me. Her eyes got big, and she has big eyes.

I think this is the first time she got it, so I started to talk about the circular reasoning of the Book of Mormon promise: Moroni 10:3-5 can be used to verify that the Book of Mormon is true only by assuming that Moroni 10:3-5 is a true test within the Book of Mormon. She didn't argue with me on these at all.

She asked if feelings can't be used to find truth, how can I know that I love her? I told her that feelings are real. I love her, and that is a true feeling. But it is not a fundamental fact of the universe. Our feelings are valid *as feelings.* It is true that I love her and our daughter, and I choose to devote myself to them based on these feelings. I reject feelings as a way that we can identify truths larger than those feelings. She asked if we can't pray to recognize truth, how can we know it. I said I don't know, but that doesn't mean I can just fall back on prayer because I don't have a better answer.

She seemed happy. She is realizing that I am honest in my reasoning, and that my concerns are valid ones indeed. It was a good night.

tl;dr Happy belated winter solstice everyone.

I'm 22. I think I might be considering leaving the church. I don't *want* to. I really do love the people and the *general* teachings of the church. I... I don't think I believe them, I just like the idea of them. The details of the church, however, I hate. 

Family of 7. Dad converted as a teenager, Mom was raised in the church. I'm the oldest of 5 kids. Three of us are secretly pro-choice and super supportive of equal rights, so I at least have support there, even if we have to keep it super secret. Otherwise they stand firm in the church and their beliefs. I'm growing weaker.

I don't want my family to be disappointed. I'm lucky enough to know they wouldn't hate me. They probably wouldn't even be angry, but I'd turn into some pet project to work on.

Dad's patriarchal blessing said to make sure all his kids make it to every activity and church session they can. He'd only blame himself.

I went a few months without going to church once. One sister and I go to YSA together while the rest of the house goes to the family ward. Finally, I was told I may have to move out if I didn't start going back. I don't think they meant it as an angry threat, just a means to get me back into things.

I really love this church and the people in it. I love the unity and the kindness spread around. I've never had bad experiences with members. Nobody is insanely pushy or anything like that. I *love* these people, but I do not believe what they are teaching me. 

I think I'm at a point now where I'm just faking it. I go to church on Sundays now but don't go to many extra activities. I live up to a standard where I'm still following most of the rules, but I believe I may just be brainwashed.

I'm terrified that I'm brainwashed. I'm still can't decide if I'm being ""tempted"" and starting to ""succumb"" to the worldy views, or if I'm seeing clearly for the first time in my life. I'm scared that no matter what I do, stay or go, it'll be a mistake.

I don't want to be the child my family speaks of in sadness. The one that fell away. I'd be the first to *leave* the church on either side of the family. 

I think I may just keep faking it until I move out. I don't know. Predictably, all my friends (nonmembers) are rooting for me to just leave. ""What's keeping ya?"" I can't just stop. There's so much to think about.

I'm sorry for this rant. It probably doesn't belong here. I just needed to tell *someone* who has felt what I'm feeling. I'm positive there's someone here who knows exactly what I'm talking about. I don't want to feel alone.

tl;dr: this is too long; don't read.

**Edit:** Thank you so much for your contributions. I was so afraid of the spiteful exes to stop on in and yell at me to get on with it already, and demean me for even considering the possibility that I'm wrong. Instead I'm being met with people who seem to know exactly what to say.

**Edit^2:** I love you guys. I think you may be more supportive of me than the actual church, haha.

I started drinking after I left the church nearly two years ago. After two years of experience in graduate school surrounded by grad student friends, I think I can claim a bit of credibility!

The first step is to understand the basic types of alcoholic drinks: beer, wine, and liquor.

**Beer**

Beer made primarily from barely along with [hops](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hops) and, optionally, other cereals. Beer is relatively weak in terms of alcoholic strength, usually brewed to 4-7% alcohol by volume (ABV). There are a few different types of beer, from lightest to darkest:

* (India) Pale Ales: Pale ales are light in color but strong in flavor. Pale ales, especially [India Pale Ales](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India_Pale_Ale) (IPAs) tend to be particularly ""hoppy"", which translates to a sharp, bitter flavor. It's a bit of an acquired taste, but I've learned to like beer that gives you a bit of a punch in the face.

* Wheat beer: These include Belgian Whites and Hefewiezens such as [Blue Moon](http://www.bluemoonbrewingcompany.com/). Wheat beers usually have a strong citrus flavor, and are often served with an orange slice, making these the orange soda of beer. I like these on warm summer days.

* Lagers: This is the most familiar type of beer. The big-brand American beers (Budweiser, Coors, Michelob) are lagers. I find lagers to be a bland, middle-of-the-road choice. You still get the bitterness that chases off new drinkers, while there isn't a lot of flavor to make it worth your while. On the other hand, they're great after a workout on a hot summer's day.

* Porters and stouts: These are the darkest of beers, made from roasted barley. Probably the most famous stout is [Guinness](http://www.guinness.com/). Stouts will often have coffee, chocolate, or even licorice flavors in the mix. They can be a bit thicker, and they are often higher in alcoholic content than other beers. Porters and stouts are perfect for winter nights by the fire.

*For your first time*: Probably have a wheat beer like Blue Moon. It'll be the most familiar to your Mormon palate.

*For a little adventure*: Give an IPA a try. The bitterness is an acquired taste, but I've really grown to like it.

*Don't bother*: With the national brands. They aren't bad, and you don't want to be the guy who turns up his nose at free Bud Light at a Super Bowl party, but there just isn't much there in terms of flavor or alcohol. Unless you want to drink a six-pack in one sitting, you're better off buying something from a microbrew or an import.

**Wine**

Wine is fermented grape juice, usually brewed to about 12-15% ABV. There's a whole culture of wine snobbery about wine regions and vintages and such. Rather than go in to all of that, I'll just talk about the very basic wine varieties.

* White wines: Light, crisp, and acidic. A few common sub-classifications are Chardonnay, Sauvignon blanc, and Pinot grigio, with Chardonnays being the sweetest and Pinots being the driest. (""Dry"" is the rough opposite of ""sweet"" in winespeak.) Whites pair well with fish or poultry.

* Red wines: Fuller, fruitier, and more bitter. Common sub-classifications are Merlots, Pinot Noir, and Cabernet Sauvignon, with Merlots tending to be sweeter and Cab Savs being drier. Reds pair well with red meat.

* Dessert wines: These are sweeter and more alcoholic (~20% ABV). [Port wine](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Port_wine), [Ice wine](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ice_wine), and [Sherry](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sherry) are common choices.

*For your first time*: Get a glass of Merlot with dinner. Don't worry about it matching your food; red wine with fish is allowed these days. Or get a glass of port after dinner.

*For a little adventure*: Find a vineyard and do a wine-tasting. Places will let you try out a selection for a small fee.

*Don't bother*: Snobbing out. You can get a perfectly decent bottle of wine for $10-$15 at the grocery store. (Unless you live in Utah!)

**Liquor**

Liquor usually refers to distilled spirits. Distillation concentrates the alcohol and the flavor after fermentation. Liquor has a much higher alcohol content (40-60% ABV) and is consumed in much smaller quantities or in mixed drinks. There isn't nearly enough room for a detailed taxonomy, so I'll list only a few of the most common types.

* Whisky: Distilled from a fermented grain mash of barley, rye, and perhaps other cereals, whisky isn't so different from a distilled beer. There are many different regional expressions. [Bourbon](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bourbon_whiskey) is American corn whisky, [Scotch](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scotch_whisky) is malt whisky from Scotland, [Irish Whisky](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irish_whiskey) comes from Ireland, etc. On the whole whisky is dark and potent; details beyond that will depend on what kind of whisky you're drinking. For example, I'm a fan of [Islay](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islay_Single_Malts) scotch, which is dark and smoky in flavor.

* Vodka: Distilled from a variety of sources, vodka is light and clear in color and flavor. Since it doesn't have much flavor, vodka is drunk either in shots or mixed in drinks. I'll be honest: I don't have much use for it.

* Tequila: This spirit is distilled from [agave](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agave_tequilana). It's also popular as a shot, with salt and lime, and it's the base liquor for a margarita. It comes in a few basic varieties, listed in order of increasing age: silver or white (unaged), gold (mixed with other flavorings OR silver tequila blended with reposado), reposado (aged from 2-11 months) and anejo (aged for at least one year). The older tequilas are generally more expensive, darker, and have more flavor.

* Rum: Distilled from cane sugar or molasses, rum is a particularly sweet liquor. There is both light and dark rum; the former being used primarily in mixed drinks and the latter being drunk straight. You may never savor a glass of rum the way you might a scotch or a bourbon, but rum is a great starter liquor.

* Mixed drinks: These usually consist of a base liquor and a few mixers, which are sweeter and non-alcoholic. A few common mixed drinks: margarita (tequila, lime juice, and [triple sec](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triple_sec)), whisky sour (whisky, lemon juice, and sugar), Manhattan (whisky, [vermouth](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sweet_vermouth), and [bitters](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitters)), mojito (rum, lime juice, and mint), and cosmopolitan (vodka, triple sec, and cranberry juice).

*For your first time*: Get a sweet mixed drink, such as a whisky sour or a margarita. If you're really feeling bold, try a little rum straight up.

*For a little adventure*: Try a single malt scotch. Ask for something simple like [Glenlivet 12](http://www.theglenlivet.com/). Feel free to get it on the rocks (ie, with ice); it'll dilute the flavor a bit and make it go down easier.

*Don't bother*: With shots. Getting drunk in a hurry is a waste of good alcohol.

**Your first drink**

First, find someone to drink with. Find a close friend who knows his limits and will look out for you. Drinking is usually -- but not always! -- a social activity. I was fortunate enough to have a fellow exMo to initiate me into the order.

Choose an easy drink from the above. I'd say your best bet is to get a mixed drink like a whisky sour or a margarita. You'll taste the alcohol, but it'll be sweet enough and masked by other flavors that it won't hit you too hard. After a drink or two, you'll start to feel a comfortable ""buzz"", and that's about where you should stop. You don't want to get drunk your first time.

**Drinking regularly** 

Especially when you're first starting out, you should drink only little at a time. It was months before I drank more than three drinks in a single night, even when I wasn't driving.

After you've gotten a little experience, it's good to get yourself drunk. This is so you can get acquainted with your body's response to alcohol and learn your limits. Do it in a safe, controlled environment with people you trust. Then, at a moderate pace -- say, one drink every half an hour -- go ahead and drink until you (or those around you!) notice you becoming drunk. Walk around between drinks, as this will give you a clearer view of your state of intoxication. Once you are officially drunk, switch to water and pay attention to what it feels like as you slowly sober up.

After a night of heavy drinking, you might wake up with a hangover. Hangovers are mostly due to dehydration. Alcohol is a diuretic, so drinking a lot of it will dry you out and give you a nasty headache the next morning. You can significantly mitigate tomorrow's hangover by drinking plenty of water tonight. Have a glass of water between drinks, and have another glass or two before bed.

Now that I'm used to drinking, I usually have a drink or two with dinner on the weekends. Often on weeknights I'll have a single serving of whisky as a nightcap before bed. Every so often I will get drunk (8-9 drinks in one evening), but only on special occasions and around close friends.

Don't take chances with driving. If I've had more than one drink, I'll have my wife drive. If I'm out with friends and have to drive, I don't have more than two drinks unless there's going to be an hour or so for me to sober up. Alcohol is an adult beverage; it isn't hard to drink it with adult responsibility.

What you do is up to you, of course. But my advice is to slowly and carefully build up your experience with alcohol. Done right, alcohol can be a responsible, satisfying part of your adult life!

You can find the post here: http://www.reddit.com/r/exmormon/comments/1jd7ds/i_need_a_step_by_step_guide_guide_to_get_my_wife/

I got into a discussion in the comments about my own difficulty in talking to my wife about my doubts of the truthfulness of the church.  I was given great advice and decided to make mention about one of my issues with church doctrine.  It was about the church's opinions towards interracial marriage (I'm married to a Brazilian).  

I wasn't planning on going all out in our conversation, but wanted to appear as if I had just read the quote by SWK, stating that the church discourages interracial marriage, and I would act sort of surprised by it.  I was doing this as a way to move slowly towards her also realizing problems in the church.

However, the conversation continued and I felt as if I was in a groove and eventually we got to the point where she asked me why I was having difficulty believing some of these doctrines of the church, so I decided to tell her how I felt.  I was surprised at how understanding she was about it.  Sure, she made some comments about how I should talk to the bishop to get his perspective on these doctrinal irregularities and she seemed a little apprehensive when I mentioned that if the church wasn't true, I wouldn't feel comfortable paying tithing or wearing garments 24/7, but only slightly.  I'm sure all of this must have been a bit of a shock to her, so I'll give her that.  She never seemed upset though.

So, in the end, it felt like a very positive experience for me.  Of course, that was last night.  Maybe when the idea settles in her mind she might change her attitude towards the idea, but I am cautiously optimistic.

Anyway, I just wanted to share my feelings and hope that one day anyone else who has been in a similar situation as me, I hope you find peace as you transition away from the church.

But if we were to do it Douglas Adams style in full, I think it might go something like this.

""Mormons, or to be more specific, members of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, are thought to be, on the whole, a rather pleasant people.  They invite you to parties in which there is free food, but you must bring your own drinks as they are teetotalers. 

Mormons tend to travel in packs known as wards, and seek to create new mormons by having them read a book written by their founder, Joseph Smith Jr.  Joseph Smith claimed to receive revelation by placing a stone in a hat and having someone write the magic words that appeared.  

Most mormons will not be familiar with this, or any other actual history about their religion because of the nefarious activities of a committee commonly called ""Correlation"".  Instead, they will invite you to pray about their religion, and then give 10% of your income through what they call ""Tithing"" to the religion. 

Members will ensure you that this tithing is in no way connected to the rather large number of businesses and properties owned by the church, and that the top leaders with several expensive homes each, make no money; despite leaders and scripture even stating otherwise.

Most mormons couldn't give a load of dingo's kidneys about their history, which is perhaps why their leader once said 'no man knows my history'.  It is perhaps the only religion to be truthful that it's entire doctrine was pulled out of a hat.""

----

Let's consider the pre-mortal life.  You're made as a spirit replica of your future body.  Everything, is made as a spirit replica.  Every tree, every plant, every animal.  Does that mean hermaphrodites were hermaphrodites in heaven?   Either way, that's not the hole, per se. 

The problem is that there are two great sides to a ideological war.  Apparently only certain creations were able to choose a side.  The rest, doomed to life as an inanimate object or dumb animal.  The good side, God's side, prevails.  Satan's side is kicked out.  Let me re-iterate.  Spirits, in the same form God created them, before they have a knowledge of good and evil, are kicked out of God's kingdom for making a choice they apparently didn't understand. Next you have a perfect God who knows how you will act, but then he sends you down to earth to prove him right.  

What's the point? Why even create spirits you know are going to rebel? Why judge the decisions of those who haven't become accountable?  And if you already know how everyone will act, and you acknowledge earth is a miserable existence, then why perpetuate the situation? 

Furthermore, wouldn't it have been better for Satan to take those spirits who followed him and complete his plan on a different planet? It's a better life for them, supposedly, and they're all damned anyway since they won't be able to replicate themselves.  And no one is left to pester God's design.  Win/Win.  Everyone gets what they want. 

Back to the earth experience.  If it's is so important then why are children under 8 given that free pass.  They never were accountable, yet they receive everything available to the best of those who were.  Why does the LDS church not celebrate a death of a child, considering they feel they receive the same eternal position as a prophet. 

Huge holes, but the largest of which is the point.  There is no point.  God knows the outcome before he plays.   He has already decided who will live and die by the organization of their spirit and the manipulation of their placement.   It's an ongoing cycle of creation and destruction without any other purpose or end-game. 

----

9.  In God's name
----

Short and simple plot hole.  The prophet is not allowed to lead the church astray, and the prophet is the only man who can speak for God.  Yet, there are dozens of examples where they have led the church astray despite non-prophets telling them that they were wrong.  (blacks, Adam/God, Temple changes, polygamy, origin of man, etc...).   The hole is that God didn't remove them. 

This becomes an even larger hole when you have prophets [proclaiming falsehoods](http://exmormon.org/phorum/read.php?2,652565) they say came directly from God himself.   Because either they aren't a prophet any more (and again not removed) or God isn't perfect (which again contradicts prior canon). 

----

8.  God as a respecter of persons
----

Joseph's Mormonism states that we're all responsible for our own sins, and we're not responsible for our parent's sins.   This is great and generally consistent.  Well, except for the glaring glaring black marks.   The largest of these would be the African line or Negros as Brigham called them.  Here you have a people who were cursed, punished, and generally derided by the early, mid, and much of the late church.  It was this way until 1978, or nearly 150 years.  

You'll see similar punishment of innocent children in Sodam and Gomorrah, Noah's flood, Alma's fire, natural disasters, etc.  God is intentionally selecting which children will be placed in areas he will later destroy or allow to be destroyed.  By the point above, we see that he's essentially giving some children a buy on the earthly existence.   If he's able to decide who is worthy and who isn't - then we're back to the point of no purpose in this life.  The twist ending is a plot hole.

----

7.  Contents of the Book of Mormon (Jaradites)
----

The Jaradite story centers on the literal existence of the Tower of Babel, fine for the sake of the argument; however, this means the Jaradites spoke and wrote in uncorrupted Adamic.  That's quite a feat for Nibley's Mongols, but we'll give it to him as it's not necessarily internally inconsistent ([except for the fact that he's several thousand years early](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timeline_of_Mongolian_history)).   

King Mosiah sent out some people who then somehow found some plates written in Adamaic.  He was able  to translate these via a magical interpreter that no one knew he had, was not mentioned previously, nor was used in previous translations.  

But let's not forget how the Jaradites came to the Americas.  They built barges.  Wooden ships, 100% watertight, designed to be tossed around, and with corks in the top and bottom.  It's a shame that God hadn't developed Nephi's ship plans yet.  That one seemed better designed.  They also managed to lose all record of these ships and never make any more.

Anyway, the corks gave them access to air for the 344 day journey.  Animals, humans, plants, enough fresh water, and enough food locked together in a wooden barge small enough to be tossed around for 344 days at sea.   What's amazing, in addition to a completely water tight ship around 2000 bc lit by magic stones, is that the livestock was able to survive the trip.  It's further amazing when you read on that they were being tossed around in a dark barge shared with colonies of bees and plants.  Yes, really.  Honey bees had enough floral to survive, were stable enough to be turned every which way, and apparently didn't all swarm and sting the other animals. 

Now they land, they do well, they split off into the good guys and the bad guys (common story), and they have a war.  Here's where it gets interesting.  Fighting for all day, several days straight (minor plot hole, but I'll allow it) with one observer up in the mountains (Ether).  He's apparently able to see well enough to record the final battle without being involved.  In fact, he records two final survivors, the leaders of each side, fighting epically to the death.

And then Coriantumr lops of the head of Shiz.  The dead body then is somehow able to do a push up, gurgle a bit as *the body struggles for breath*, and then collapses dead. All recorded from Ether's mountain vantage point.  Gripping story, but completely unbelievable. 

----

6.  Joseph Smith's history
----

* [The ""first vision"" wasn't the first](http://www.mormonthink.com/img/FirstVisionsMormonInfographics.jpg), nor was it recorded or recited anywhere near the time claimed (1835 vs claimed 1820).

* Were the churches all wrong, or not? Was that a surprise to him? [1:10 vs 1:18](https://www.lds.org/scriptures/pgp/js-h/1?lang=eng).  And how could a mostly illiterate Joseph, as claimed, have such as strong grasp of the bible. 

* Why is the story of young Joseph's knee used in conjunction with the Word of Wisdom? It was several years too early for the two to be related, unless they're suggesting he came up with the WoW on his own. 

* The Golden Plates were [6 x 8 x 6 (in) with the thickness of tin](http://www.mrm.org/weight-of-plates).  That's too heavy to move by hand if they were pure gold.  It's also unlikely that any of the 11 supposed witnesses could have lifted them either.  It's further unlikely that this collection of plates could have held the Egyptian characters to produce 646 English pages in the Book of Mormon (- footnotes) and a large sealed portion, and for all of the bluster around the plates - no first hand accounts state they were used during the translation. 

* Speaking of the 116 pages.  Metal was so scarce that God had Nephi replicate most of the content rather than just telling Joseph ""no"" for a third time?

I will not deny that I am partly responsible for the contention, but I never thought they would actually kick me out. The reason--rather, the final straw--for this surprising development occurred after we all got back from mutual on Wednesday. Long story short, we entered into an argument about the sexism of the mutual lesson, which, several red herrings later, evolved into an argument about marriage equality. The argument was tame enough; there were very few times voices were raised and the ad hominem was to a minimum. 

Maybe this is arrogant of me, but I think my arguments caused so much cognitive dissonance upon my parents' thoughts after the argument was ended that they spontaneously came to the agreement--while chatting in their room--to force me to leave the house in a month. I think my very recent 18th birthday also heavily contributed to this decision. They told me the next morning of the decision, and I've been in shock ever since. 

They are completely set on this verdict. There is no way I am going to change their minds on this one. That is why I turn to you.

**EDIT: I wanted to throw out a very kind thank you to everyone who has commented. It's been awesome and I've read everything. Thank you so much. Those of you who are also in Utah and have offered to PM and talk, thank you specifically. I believe I will, so don't be too surprised if I do contact you within the new few days :) You guys are awesome, thank you!***

I don't know where to start, or how to, even. That's part of why I am here, with you. I don't know who else to go to, or where else I can attempt to explain what I'm dying to. Let's just see if I can get this out adequately with some semblance of clarity.

I was born and raised in the LDS church. My family was not so different I am sure from many of yours. We went to church every Sunday, whether or not we wanted to. We did service projects, sang in sacrament meeting, visited old folks homes every Monday night for our family's FHE, the whole nine yards. At home, though, my dad was very abusive, and my mom just kinda let things happen. He was the patriarch of the home, he could do what he wanted. He'd only hit the two oldest boys (3 boys, 3 girls in our family, my brother and I were the oldest of the boys), and when we were little there wasn't anything we could do about it. He'd come into our room, lock the door behind him, and go crazy. My sisters would bang on the door and yell for him to stop. When he'd start to get riled up and I knew it was only a matter of time before he came for me, I'd hide from him in my closet with my Book of Mormon. As we got older we tried to fight back or to argue, particularly my older brother. He'd use the doctrine of the church to defend us, and my dad would justify his abuse with passages of scripture and so on. It was intense, and I hated him more than I can tell you. I hated the church too - my dad was a High Priest, and he'd speak on Sundays. He'd shake hands with the Stake President, the Bishop, people would tell me how lucky I was to have such a spiritual giant in the home. As I got older I told myself it wasn't the churches fault that my dad was the way he was - how often do we hear that the people aren't perfect, but the doctrine is? I ate it up. We got older still, and I still took comfort in the doctrine, thinking that as soon as I got out, as soon as I got away from home, things would be better. The people aren't perfect, but the doctrine is....right..? I am not sure why that is all relevant, but perhaps it's part of my story someone can relate to.

My brother went on a mission, and I left for mine shortly after he came home. What would make a long story short, I will just say I got a medical release after four months. I developed insomnia, depression, and anxiety all to crippling levels. I lost the ability to read. My mind was totally broken. I spent weeks with doctors who told my Mission President that I had to go home and get urgent care. My Mission President told me I was lying. My Stake President told me I was lying. My district leader told me I was lying. After two months of that I came home, and people would look at me like I was total filth. Some even came up to me to ask me what it was I had really done to have to come home. I ground my teeth - the people are not perfect, but the doctrine is, right?

Fast forward to now. As the years have passed I've slowly shifted away from the church. I haven't been active in going on two years. I go intermittently with family or friends, but the more I go the more something inside of my freaks out. And it terrifies me. This is the root of why I am here, and the root of why I hope someone here has something to say that can help me make sense of the mess in my mind. I just don't get it anymore. I used to have a crystal clear understanding of where I was, what the world meant to me, how I was related to it. I understood it all. But guys...I just don't believe it anymore. I don't. That scares me so bad. Not because I am morally afraid of what I have become, but because my entire worldview is gone. I can think only that I have been staring at a star through a telescope, and it fell over, and boom, the whole night sky is in front of me. It's massive - it's so intensely huge, it's so absolutely foreign. It's beautiful, but I don't know where to go to build my perceptions up again, but I know I can't return to church. I don't have a single person I can talk to in my life (I live in Utah County) that would be able to share in this experience with me. Almost everyone I know, everyone I meet in my day to day activities, everyone I can call to hang out is LDS. My best friends, even those who would not be upset with me if we did talk, would come at the talk from a member missionaries standpoint - as seeing me as someone that needs to be rescued. A few already have. There is no way my family would ever understand. They may say they do, that they support me no matter what, but it would break them. They're so sincere, but sometimes they're so blind. I love them so much and part of me worries about what we will become if I were ever to tell them that I think it's all just a bunch of insanity. My parents are divorced now, and my mom clings to the church like it's the only thing keeping her afloat in a tsunami with great white sharks underneath her. My sisters take the church as a simple course of reality - it's there, it's true, why in the world would you ever, ever, EVER question it? My older brother...I couldn't respect him more, we couldn't be closer, but he's well on his way towards becoming a prominent lawyer, and the church is very important to him too. My little brother is inactive, and probably in my same shoes. I should talk to him about this...see where he is, and where he wants to go....

If you're still reading - thank you. I guess this is the part where I've finally gotten to the point where I know what questions I want to ask.

What did you do, when you realized you didn't believe anymore? Did you have family that were devastated by it, and how did you deal with that? What did you do to help your mind cope with the fact that what you've believed for decades simply no longer makes any rational sense to you? Were you scared? What about relationships? What did you do when you realized your partner believes but you don't? I am dating someone who is very understanding. She encourages me to be active but it's a very passive thing. If things were to get intense, though, she'd insist on a temple marriage. What did you do about lingering doubts, ""Maybe it's true, you should try again."", ""Think of how you felt as a missionary, what would you say to someone in this situation if you were on a mission again?"" and so on? I am scared...I want to delete this post and never come back again. But I can't. It's eating me and I don't know who can help stop the madness inside. Please, if anyone has been in this situation before, I ask you with all the sincerity that I posses to please tell me what worked for you. The world doesn't make sense to me anymore, and I don't know where to turn.

Some smartass kid on the back row pointed out that wars, genocide, and the murder rate have all dropped dramatically over the last 20 years.  (He's right.  I googled it after.) 

Anyways, the religion professor still wanted to push his doomsaying, so he said something along the lines of, 

""I'm older than you and have been watching current events for a lot longer and wickedness has increased. Porn is much more widely available now.  There are also many  more swear words on TV and they are not being regulated like they used to.""

The kid replied, ""Well, if I am weighing wickedness, I think that genocide is much worse than swear words on TV.""

My Professor flipped, ""I don't agree with that.  I think the spirit is manifesting to me that I don't agree with what you are saying.""

It was hilarious.   The Spirit told him that swear words on TV are worse than genocide. 

He went on with the lecture and later realized that his answer was pretty unsatisfactory. He said that all the porn, lying, and swearing that are common in our culture will degrade our morals so much that we will cause more genocide and war in the future.  I still don't think that the link between porn and genocide is very clear.

I grew up in a family of nine that was extremely Mormon (but I thought to be normal as a small child which made the rest of the world seem weird to me).  Anyhow here's one of my Mormon stories.

I grew up in Hawaii and had my first girlfriend and first love at 17 years old.  She was from the mainland and I first met her the year before when she came up for the summer to visit her father and step mother.  We hung out a few times during the summer and became friends before she had to fly back to the mainland for school (she lived with her mother in the mid west).  Throughout the year she wrote me a couple of friendly letters after she'd heard that I had been jumped by some drunken mokes and busted up pretty bad.

That next summer she moved back to Hawaii, this time for good.  She was a Sophmore in high school and I was a Senior.  When she came over to visit that summer I remember how pure and beautiful she looked, I was head over for her.  That's still the prettiest memory I have of anything.  I can remember hangin out with her and not being able to recognize the smell of weed because I had never smoked it.  I had never drank beer.  I'd never had sex.  When we touched it was like electricity was flowing through my body.  I've never experienced that feeling since.

We spent months talking on the phone late into the night before we ever kissed. After that I couldn't stay away from her.  She was two years younger but knew a lot more about many things than I did, and she gave me a lot of first experiences.  For weeks we would meet on the beach at night and kiss.  I resisted her forward advances for a few days.  I was a virgin and Mormon.  Sex was off limits.  I couldn't hold out long.  She seduced me.  That first time I hope I'll never forget, there is nothing like it.  Tight, so wet, primal, and very enthusiastic... many women since then and lots of good sex.. but even the good times are as bonfires next to the sun.

I loved her, I thought I did.  I was a kid.

When she got sick I scraped together some change to buy her food I liked and hoped that she would like to.  I stood up to the bullies that taunted her for being a white girl.. local Hawaiian schools can be rough on outsiders.  I taught her how to surf.  I told her I would marry her, but that we should wait until we were 30 to make sure that we lived life to fullest before settling down and having kids.. I meant it.  I think I did.

One day she went in for a routine Dr. appt. and the nurse asked her if she was sexually active... I think it was supposed to be confidential, anyhow she said ""yes"" and later the nurse called her parents to let them know their daughter was having sex.  Her father and step mother are mormon, they freaked out and immediately pulled her out of school.  ""Do you want to be his squaw!?""  He shouted at her.  (I'm native american).  They put her on a plane and shipped her back to the mainland to live with her mother.

The father confronted me in a library and lifted me up by my neck.. I was a skinny kid back then and he was a hulking overweight cop.  He told me that if I ever came near her again that he'd kill me.  I said ""How can I see her?  You sent her away.""  ""That's right."" He said, and then noticed that people were watching and he left.  I sat down and cried behind the building.

My mother, strict Mormon that she was, kicked me out for my transgressions and I lived on the beach for a few weeks.  I would put my few clothes and things behind a dumpster during the day when I was at school and at night I would wake up in the sand, shivering and covered in dew. Its funny how the middle of the night is cold even in paradise.   One night it was raining and I was hungry.  The family was having pizza and I stood outside looking in.  My mom just opened the door and I came back in.  We didn't talk about it.

The months passed and no calls came.. I didn't know her number or where her mother lived.  Eventually I did get a letter, about a year later.. I think maybe they'd been coming all along, but were being screened or thrown away.. I don't know.  She didn't know where I was at this point in life, or what I was doing.. she told me that she had a date with a really nice boy.  I was devastated.  I still loved her.. she seemed so far away.  I can't remember if I wrote back.

Some years later I was living in Texas working at a grocery store.. I got her number from her brother.  I was dating a girl, but I still dreamed of my first love.  I called her.  She was working at a Dairy Queen... she wanted to go to college.  She was in the mid west.  I wanted to go to her, but I didn't know what to do.  My girlfriend wanted to move back to Hawaii with me.. so I did.

Some years later I met a woman in college who I fell in love with and married.  She is the woman of my dreams.  We've been together 10 years now and are very happy.  I work as software engineer.  Just recently I joined facebook for the first time in my life and suddenly all kinds of people I'd forgotten about were contacting me and catching up.  It was kinda fun. 

Then she contacted me.  I was 30 now.  I'd forgotton about her, she was an angel from another life.  I had stopped having dreams about her. 

It turns out in the years that had passed she had some rough times, cancer, surgury, but then good times too, school, marriage and two young boys, born healthy.  She said that she dreamed of me for years... she waited nearly half a decade, then she got cancer and a nice boy helped her through those times.  She married him, he is a good guy. 

She still loves me.  She can't see me, I can't visit her.  She doesn't trust herself.

I feel the same way.  I talked to her over facebook for a month.  I didn't trust myself to call her.  I still loved her.  I started to dream of her again, and my heart was twisted.  I would wake up sweating.  This wasn't fair to my wife.  It wasn't fair to her husband or to her children or to her.  I knew that eventually I would find her.. and then what?

I wrote one last message to say goodbye, again, and I canceled my facebook account.  That was a year and a half ago.  Once a month or so I dream of her and wake up sweating.",,False,self,t5_2r0gj,False,,,True,t3_10l59x,http://www.reddit.com/r/exmormon/comments/10l59x/mormonism_and_my_first_love/,

*I really did struggle with porn and it did control my life at some points the guilt/shame cycle was so intense that it seemed to consume everything.*

Anyway, The LDS meeting was Thursday evenings and that didn't work for me so I found a 12-step meeting run by [sex addicts anonymous](http://saa-recovery.org/) instead.  I had been going there for several months and when it came up in an interview with the Bishop he was not happy that I wasn't going to the LDS version.

So I made an extra effort and worked my schedule around so that I could attend the LDS 12-step meetings on Thursdays.

Let me just say that my experience in the LDS 12-step vs normal 12-step gave me some serious Cog-Dis and was a contributing factor to finally leading me out of the LDS church completely.

AMA

For example in a normal 12-step program everyone there including the people running the meeting are current/former/recovering addicts.  But at the LDS 12-step the people running the meeting were an Elderly Missionary Couple that had no clue.

In a normal 12-step program you get a sponsor or someone you can talk to outside the meetings to help you out.  In the LDS version fraternizing, exchanging phone numbers, and sponsorship was forbidden.  They considered your Bishop to be the sponsor and didn't want you talking to others

In normal 12-step you can talk about your week in detail regarding your feelings and what are your specific hang-ups.  This helps so that others can empathize with you and/or share their experiences.  In the LDS program they didn't want you to mention any sins or specific temptations.  They didn't want to make it seem ok if you messed up so  you couldn't be honest.

Nobody in the LDS 12-step respected the starting time of the meeting.  So the meeting never started on time.  I never ever saw this in programs outside LDS

The point of the novel is like a collection of exmo stories and experiences to uncover the true agenda of the church and so forth.

So my question of the day is what is the creepiest or most uncomfortable situation that a church leader has ever put you into?

For me, My bishop asked me when I was 13/14 if I had ever ""touched my sacred parts"" I told him yes. I was very confused by this. He then asked what color my panties were when it happened. As if the color could have made me do something sinful? I am not sure on that one. He then told me that those parts are only reserved for the ""pleasure"" of my husband and that I shouldn't ever touch them in a pleasurable manner.

We've heard they exist, but never met any.

Over the weekend, I had dinner with my parents, my youngest brother, and his wife.  I'm a Democrat, and my dad and my brother are staunch Republicans.  Dad HATES Obama.  Dad and my brother LOVE to get into it with me over my political affiliation.  I got a little peace from them right after the election, but I guess they were ready to start in again.  

Dad told a ""joke"" about a boss laying off employees because of the bad ecomony, and choosing to fire only the Obama supporters beause ""they wanted change"".  The joke fell completely flat, and not just because I know of a real employer who threatened his employees with ""Vote for Romney or I'll lay people off.""  But I guess I was supposed to say, ""You're right; we would be better off if Romney had won.""

Instead, I threw out, ""Well, at least the guy who believes that God is an alien didn't win.""

Stunned silence for a moment, and then my brother, in his best, 'I know everything' voice said, ""I'm sure that's not what Mormons believe.""

""No, really,"" I said in my own 'I'm quite sure' voice.  ""Mormons believe that God was a person on another planet, but he was so good that he became 'an exalted being', a god, and created our world.  And if we're really good--and we're Mormon--we can become gods and create our own worlds too.""  

""Wow, I didn't know they believed that,"" my mom said.  The subject was then changed, and no one brought up the presidential election for the rest of the evening.  Hallelujah.

So, Mitt, thanks for giving me something to shut my dad up.

PS- If you're Republican, we can agree to disagree.  I only get into it with my dad and brother when they start it.  My DH is also Republican, but we manage to never argue politics.

After 2 years of inactivity (and two years of complete disbelief for me), my semi-believing wife is making her 3rd effort at regular church participation. She is more of a functional believer than a literal believer (meaning she needs to church to ""work"" for her more than she needs it to be ""true"").  She has accepted a calling in young women. She worked really hard on her first lesson of the year.  She changed her work schedule to allow regular attendance. We are starting family home evening again (something I'm happy to do, but [this](http://www.amazon.com/Raising-Freethinkers-Practical-Parenting-Beyond/dp/0814410960/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1358276243&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=raising+freethinkers) will be my lesson manual). I suspect bedtime prayers might be starting again soon, too.

Last night we had a long conversation about our relationship, our finances, and lots of heavy stuff that is relevant to adult married life but not very fun to deal with.  It included the church. She said she felt like she'd let me slide on some things. Elaborating, she said things like my inactivity, beer and coffee in the house, and taking off my garments.  She asked if I would try walking the mormon path again.  I respectfully said no. I'd spent 30 years trying it the church's way, and would need pretty strong justification to try it their way again. I also said, if she *really* wanted me to try again, I would do it with an open mind and heart, because of the love and trust I feel for her. She said I didn't have to, but that she was grateful I was willing to do it for her.

I then said that I too, feel I had let her slide on some things. She asked for examples. I told her I don't feel she has applied the same intellectual rigor to her decision to stay in the church as she does to other areas of her life, and I haven't called her out on that. She spends more time researching consumer ratings when car shopping than she does investigating the claims of the church.  Specifically, I said ""Last Sunday you taught the lesson of the first vision and the nature of the godhead in young women. There are enough inconsistencies between the 8 or so historical accounts of the first vision to cast doubt on the real story, or if it even happened at all. I let you slide by not challenging you to study the whole story, not just the mythical version the church has authorized."" This stung her a bit, because she had felt ""the spirit"" while working on her lesson, watching the church videos with nice music and beautify people, and teaching her young women.  The sting passed, but she was still skeptical there were multiple versions. ""Show me"", she said.

I showed her [this book](http://deseretbook.com/Joseph-Smiths-First-Vision-Steven-C-Harper/i/5081861), emphasizing it is being sold at Deseret Book and how the title says account**s**. 

It caused her to pause.

I explained the best I could remember that the story grew and evolved over time until it became the canonized version we know today.  I talked about how some versions had angel(s), some had only one personage, some had no people, some had no devil, some only involved the remission of sins and not the ""no other true churches"" statement. I compared it to a story her dad tells about a trip to Disneyland when my wife was a child and had horrible motion sickness. Over the years it has grown to the point were everyone shoes had vomit in them, and the park manager asked them to leave because she was throwing up so much. In truth, she threw up once and waited on a park bench while the rest of the family played, but the embellished version is much more entertaining.  

Then I went to [this page](http://byutv.org/watch/314c34a8-c1c3-4266-82c2-4f755168e7dd/the-joseph-smith-papers-first-vision-part-1) and showed her that BYUTV has addressed the issue at great length.  I pulled up the one and only Ensign article I know of dealing with the topic, [published 28 years ago.](https://www.lds.org/topics/accounts-of-the-first-vision?lang=eng) and we skimmed it.  Finally, I showed her the church's official response [here](https://www.lds.org/topics/accounts-of-the-first-vision?lang=eng). Basicallym they all say that Joseph struggled to remember correctly because he was new to such spiritual experiences (false on a few counts), and that he told different versions to different audiences (the pearls before swine argument).  I told her the official responses sound more like weak excuses, offered only after they were caught, than an honest explanation.  To me, the most rational (and honest) explanation is that the first vision is a story which grew over time until it became something very different than what it started as. 

She paused again.

Finally, she says ""Why does it really matter if there are multiple versions of the story and it's more myth than fact?"". (Remember, she's a functional believer, not a literal believer).  I told her it doesn't matter to some people, because they know the problems better than I do and keep attending.  But it matters to people like me because the story is central to the doctrine of the church. It matters to me because I poured my heart into the retelling of this story as a missionary (1st Discussion, 4th principle), having been trained that the spirit would touch peoples hearts to the truthfulness of the message (this is a fatal blow all on its own, IMO).  It matters because it brings casts doubt onto Joseph's prophetic calling. And most importantly, it matters because if this core doctrine is a lie, what else are they lying about?

She pauses for a third time.

""Why would they lie? What do they have to gain from lying?"" she asked. I started crying a bit here (curse you mormon culture for my leaky eyes), and I replied, ""That was an important question for me, too.  A very hard and very important question.  I have my ideas on why they lie, and they are mine alone.  You know a lot of them already because of other conversations.  But obviously, my conclusions were strong enough that I felt I had to risk our relationship, our family, and ultimately my salvation to answer them. You know that I have changed my world view, and that is has come with a very high price tag,and I might not be done paying the full price just yet.  But, I am happier now that my life is lead by the pursuit of truth and reason, instead of obedience and repetition. I have a greater sense of wonder at the universe now. I no longer have to put limitations on my intellectual curiosities because I am scared of not getting [sky cake](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=55h1FO8V_3w).  I am a peace with my mortality, and am good without god.  But you need to answer that question of why they lie for yourself.""

It got to the point where I'd go on splits with other missionaries just to get away from him. Anyway I was on a split with my district leader (DL) who happened to be my comps former comp. My DL hated my comp as much or more than I did so we would chill out and vent.

My Dl told me that when they were comps he had to give this elder (my comp) the entire sex talk. He had to explain everything, he even had to explain what wet dreams were!

This may be confusing, but I'll try to put his comments in quotes and my responses are not.

&gt;Finally, concerning religion.

That is a fearsome responsibility you are taking upon your shoulders.  Please weigh that decision carefully because it has potential to do a great deal of harm.

 

This is where you really lose me. Watch this, I won’t change the context an ounce, but who it is speaking to will be reversed, see how silly it sounds:

""Finally, concerning religion.  The first night you told us you were Joining the church, I simply asked that you be careful not to become like Tom Monson and waste your life and resources fighting for it and working to persuade others to your way of thinking, to which, if I remembered correctly, you agreed to that evening.

That is a fearsome responsibility you are taking upon your shoulders.  Please weigh that decision carefully because it has potential to do a great deal of harm.""

 

How many poor souls have joined the church and heard rubbish like this?  You hear about it in Sacrament meeting at least once a month of how So-and-so put up with so much to leave behind an old life and come in to the fold. How brave they were, how blessed.

Don’t you get how silly this sounds? You are presuming that *you* have the truth! Not only that, you are presuming that *you* have the truth, and *I* know it, but I’m deciding to “fight against it” despite it all.

If I thought it was truth I would have stayed. And believe me, after devoting 30 years of my life to it, I wanted it to be the truth. It broke my heart to be honest with myself and acknowledge that it was in fact false. So if you ever question why I may speak to someone about “coming to my side” you’ll know I have the same conviction I had as an Elder for the church. It might come as a surprise to you, but this is actually how I see it.  And it is not based on belief. It is based on fact. Reality. Evidence. Exactly what the “lord” asked me to do. Study it out in your heart and your *mind*. A heart can easily be tricked (look at evangelicals, do they not feel in their heart that they are right, and you are wrong?). The mind is a little more picky, if you allow it to be.

 

&gt;“you agreed to that evening”

I don’t owe you any amount of “agreement.” I acknowledged to you that it would be better if we didn’t try to convince each other, and I admit I meant the same for mom. I knew it wouldn’t be healthy for our relationship to go down that road. I never “agreed” to never speak what I think to be the truth to anyone else. What a presumptive, asinine thought you came up with. In fact I fully intend to speak with people who I think could benefit from hearing about the actual facts in church history. 


 

 Whatever “snippets” you heard I own completely.  The silly thing is, it really is none of your business what I say to others. Who do you think you are that you are going to monitor my communications with others, and so long as you approve you won’t say anything? This is just a prime example of the power you think you have in this relationship. Get over yourself.  I understand you’ve held positions of authority at work, church, and in the community, but if you think any of that matters in this situation you’re being naïve.

I just wanted to drop a note here to say thanks to those who have been patient and supportive of us loony mods over at /r/lds. As you've probably read, a few weeks ago the subreddit was getting overwhelmed with downvotes. People would post links or comments only to never have them hit the front page due to immediate downvoting. In a sub that small just a few votes was a big deal. The mods removed the downvotes in an effort to both diagnose and bring attention to the issue. 

Many members of /r/exmormon have helped explain to others who have felt suprised, angry or offended about what was going on and why; and have supported /r/lds during this brief period. Prominent /r/exmormon members have been allies in helping all of us be a part of the incredible reddit community by encouraging us to follow reddiquette and to create topic-appropriate subreddits. Thank you for this.

A lot of the casual users over at /r/lds don't see the difference the supportive /r/exmormon regulars have made to our community, but I've noticed and I wanted to sincerely say thanks.

Yes, the downvote arrows will be coming back. Things are already a lot better over at /r/lds and participation from recovering mormons has been almost entirely positive and welcome. For those who have contributed to building a bettter community through constructive conversation I am thankful. 

I thought this would be short, but there's two more things I want to say. 

First: I want to say that I know there are more than a few here who have been hurt, not only by the church, but by unthinking members of /r/lds. Many of us simply aren't able to understand how badly our comments can sting - forgetting that, for ex-mormons and others who have had bad experiences, the subject may already feel like flesh rubbed raw; and that poking at it only makes it hurt more. 

I can't speak for either the LDS church or /r/lds as a whole, but if this has been your experience - I'm sorry. It's an easy thing to say ""if there's anything I can do..."", especially within the realm of an online, text-based community, so instead I will say this: I will personally do better - to have more respect, courtesy, and especially to make an effort to understand those I meet because of what I've seen some of the mormons and former mormons go through here. I hope that promise makes a difference and soothes at least a little of the damage done.

1334606316.0,73,self.exmormon,scwcs,A modest Proposal that the Church is True,87,14,24,http://www.reddit.com/r/exmormon/comments/scwcs/a_modest_proposal_that_the_church_is_true/,"It seems, after hours and years of intensive study that the church is, in fact, true.  Not just any church either, but in fact the church that the apologists have taught about.  All this time their science was far superior and lines up perfectly with the faith, as well as historical fact.

So for example, it is true that [The nephites and lamanites](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Limited_geography_model) were in a very limited area of central america.  Further they really did use [tapirs as horses](http://maxwellinstitute.byu.edu/publications/transcripts/?id=129).  

Also they were only a [small segment of population](http://en.fairmormon.org/Book_of_Mormon/Lamanites/Relationship_to_Amerindians) despite the early saint claims that in fact they were the Indians over in Missouri as well in and around the burials mounds of New York.  They were simply [one of many people already there](http://www.fairlds.org/authors/perego-ugo/the-book-of-mormon-and-the-origin-of-native-americans-from-a-maternally-inherited-dna-standpoint)

Also the people's did not use [gold in transactions](http://en.fairmormon.org/Book_of_Mormon/Anachronisms/Coins) or measurements as originally thought, but cocoa beans, with gold 
weights.

Now many members and exmormons alike have been fooled by the seemingly grandeos claims that caused them to expect to find christian churches and synogogs after Christ was on the North American continent, Christ's name (Along with the virgin Mary) as early as 600 B.C. due to Nephi's vision, evidence Jewish passover rights etc. from ""The sea west to the sea east"" or covering a very large area of land indeed.  

Members should simply ratchet down their expectations to only finding some of these evidences.  It's clear now that the prophets and apostles in the Book of Mormon were given to a bit of exaggeration.  I mean, they did use a word for ""Tapir"" that brought it to the stature of a horse.  They used words like [""All the land""](http://www.lds.org/scriptures/search?lang=eng&amp;query=all+the+land&amp;x=0&amp;y=0) and [All the Pople](http://www.lds.org/scriptures/search?lang=eng&amp;type=verse&amp;query=all+the+people&amp;testament=bofm) and [Every Man](http://www.lds.org/scriptures/search?lang=eng&amp;type=verse&amp;query=every+man&amp;testament=bofm) when they were CLEARLY talking about only a small subsection of people.

Accordingly, members should also adjust down their beliefs about the after life.  I mean, it is the same prophets and apostles given to the same exaggeration tendencies.

Hence when you hear that [all mankind](http://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/alma/34.9?lang=eng#8) would perish without the atonement, they really just mean a few people in eastern china.  When you hear that the atonement is ""eternal"" don't forget that eternal is not a length of time, but rather, [the name of god](http://www.lds.org/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/19.10?lang=eng#10).

And when they say that only mormons will be in heaven, they really mean they will be a small subset of the indigenous people already there, such a small percentage that even in heaven, their DNA mixing wouldn't even register in multiple samples.

So you see, the Apologist church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints is TRUE, that is the way History was, and the way Heaven will be, but don't let it worry you, because it's all so small it doesn't even register when you try and measure it.

(and don't let it bother you that their evidence for history destroyed your faith... that evidence destroys faith is an over exaggeration as well, it just muffles it a bit for 2.1415963 seconds).",,False,self,t5_2r0gj,False,,,True,t3_scwcs,http://www.reddit.com/r/exmormon/comments/scwcs/a_modest_proposal_that_the_church_is_true/,

&gt;And now, my dearly beloved brethren and sisters, let me assure you that these are principles in relation to the dead and the living that cannot be lightly passed over, as pertaining to our salvation. For their salvation is necessary and essential to our salvation, as Paul says concerning the fathers—that they without us cannot be made perfect—neither can we without our dead be made perfect.

There is a reference to Hebrews 11:40 where Paul is being quoted.

&gt; God having provided some better thing for us, that they without us should not be made perfect.

So Joesph Smith is trying to teach us about why we need baptism for the dead and he is using Paul's words to show that it was an important part of ancient doctrine.  This was on September 6th, 1842.

But in the Hebrews scripture there is a reference to the JST version of that scripture.

&gt;God having provided some better things for them through their sufferings, for without sufferings they could not be made perfect.

This completely changes the meaning of the scripture.  the KJV says that the dead cannot be made perfect without us and the JST says the dead cannot be made perfect without their sufferings.  Joesph created most of the JST between 1830 and 1833, ten years before Section 128.  So first Joesph says the original bible scripture is wrong, then goes on to quote the wrong scripture to justify his new strange doctrine.

I found this during scripture study one morning on my mission (no idea if it has been discussed elsewhere).  I called up my mission president to help me understand and he told me that I should not worry and that one day down the road I it will make sense.  Well he was right.  It makes sense to me now, Joesph was a fraud.

Thanks for reading

Edit:  This actually bothered me much more than it normally would have.  Before the mission I had read many ""anti"" materials (this was back in 2000 when the internet was still kinda new) but I always shrugged most of it off as ""they are just trying to tear down the church with lies.""  This was the first time I found a problem on my own with no one around to lie to me about anything.  I did not read it to try to attack the church and no one pointed it out to me.  It just happened.  It was hard to deal with finding your own anti-mormon material.

I am so powerful, and here is what you must do to live with me, or I will kick you out of my presence forever:

- Make buildings where you talk and sing songs about me.

- Don't eat or drink certain things

- Give me money

- Don't rub your genitals by yourself, or against anyone else' genitals, unless you have been legally contracted to share property and children, as defined by the tribal regulations of your geographically defined region of military control

- Believe I exist

- I am going to impregnate a woman with my son, and I will not call her the next day, but I will send a messenger to tell her that I remotely knocked her up. Or maybe I'll rub my genitals against hers while she's engaged to a man she loves instead. Who knows?

- Okay, well, I guess *I* am allowed to rub my genitals on anyone I want to.

- While you are the buildings mentioned before, you must choose one person to announce to me that you are about to pretend to tear apart and eat my son's body and drink his blood, and then immediately pretend to tear apart and eat his body and drink his blood. Do this because he pretended to do it to himself 2000 years ago with bread and wine.

- You are not ever permitted to drink wine.

- My son is a little backwards and says weird stuff so all of you have to be his friend to make him feel better. To prove you are his friend, you have to find a person with a penis to hold you under the water for a little bit.

But then I realized that it would be far more hilarious to stand outside the temple and just greet everyone as follows: Let's say the day is the 29th so the new name for men would be Barnabas.

""Welcome to the temple. Is this your first time?"" 

And if they say yes: ""Well have fun... Hey... Is your name Barnabas? No? Oh... You just really look like a Barnabas to me. Maybe that was your name in another life or something haha.""

At first, they claimed that no one there stopped believing without sinning.  I'm not kidding.  But after a while, they realized that there might be a /tiny/ number of kids who really honestly didn't believe, rather than ""just wanted to sin"".

After discussing the issue in detail, they admitted they had no course of action for people who didn't want to be expelled, but honestly had lost faith.

This is the recommended course of action:

1) Go to your Faculty Adviser.  He/She should be your advocate to get you as much as you've earned out of the university.  He/She will have a list of universities you can easily transfer to.

2) Another option is to exit the university, and come back in as a different religion.  They are discussing making this a painless process.  Your tuition will not be supplemented by tithing dollars so prepare for the increase.

3) If you fear your faculty adviser (Say that you are not willing to submit to them, because He/She is harsh), contact Dr Lines in the physics department.  He will act as your advocate.

I think this is a big step, and I think it would be helpful to illustrate how big of a problem this is, to have everyone who is considering contacting an adviser over this issue to at least contact [Dr. Lines](http://web.byui.edu/Directory/Employee/linest) and let him know that you might be part of this sub-group of non-sinning, but still questioning students.

Helping them know the sheer size of the individuals may even get a dedicated counselor helping people in transition.

Early Mormon doctrine held that our Earth was literally birthed from another planet (near Kolob) and that it descended to its current position around our star during the Fall. Someday, Earth will be resurrected, glorified into a giant Urim and Thummim star, and will give birth to its own baby Earths. 

It gets weirder. According to Oliver Huntington, one of Joseph's close friends, Smith taught that the Earth had mini-planets connected to the top and bottom of the Earth. The water from Noah's flood went onto one planet and the Ten Tribes of Israel went onto the other one. Those planets are flying around in space somewhere with the City of Enoch, but they will all land back on the Earth before the Second Coming. As D&amp;C 133 teaches, all the continents will come back together and the planet with the Ten Tribes will land on the North Pole and these Ten Tribes will make highways through the Arctic Ocean to join up with the Mormons in Missouri.

Here is my belated reply, now that I have some actual life experience to draw on.

""Hey, guess what asshole, it doesn't have to be.  You just think it does because you got married to an 18 year old when you were 21, and your family and friends are made up of an interlocking network of Mormons who did the same stupid thing, so you perceive it as normal.  Right now you're giving a group of young people some really shitty advice that's just going to perpetuate the cycle.

This is going to blow your mind because you've spent your life enveloped in a culture of people who can't see anything wrong with the idea that marriage is a responsibility: there are people who wait until they're fully-grown adults, and then marry because they like each other, rather than because marriage will allow them to have sex.  These strange people don't end up thinking of their marriage as hard work, we _actually think of it as fun_.""

I ended up not responding (didn't know what to say, got busy, forgot...).

She emailed me again recently asking why she hadn't heard from me in a while.  I sent her this:

*Dearest Granny,*


*You haven't heard from me in a while because I generally don't bother talking to people who don't take me seriously.*

*I did not leave the LDS church so I could have sex with someone I wasn't even dating at the time; I left for the reasons I already briefly explained to you.*

*To suggest that I ditched a belief system that was so central and significant to literally every aspect of my life, and to which I have devoted countless hours and dollars and thoughts and emotions, and which I had defended from teachers, coaches, friends, and strangers, just because I couldn't control my vagina (which I have successfully controlled for 22 years), is highly offensive.*

*I have had questions and doubts since I read the Book of Mormon for the first time when I was eight years old.  I put those on the proverbial shelf until the time when all my questions would be answered.  But the more I learn about people, the world, and myself, the more I have come to realize that too many ideas taught as gospel truth are morally reprehensible and based on faulty logic and information.  My decision was not made lightly or rashly.  It was the result of a careful and deliberate search for truth.*

*I was extremely reluctant to follow through once I realized I could not continue believing in the church with any integrity.  It meant throwing away everything I had learned.  It meant admitting that I was severely wrong for twenty-two years.  It meant possible rejection from friends and family.  It meant uncertainty.  It meant the loss of comforting notions and long-cherished beliefs.*

*The church's vigorous efforts to hide its own history and finances are coercive and deceitful.  Its efforts to control behaviors, information, thoughts, and emotions result in rampant confirmation bias, cognitive dissonance, thought-stopping patterns, and other byproducts of indoctrination.*

*I reject the notion that I do not have morals or that my morality is flawed just because I have chosen not to accept any religion.  My newfound sense of morality is based on empathy and reason.  I no longer struggle to make sense of the arbitrary, conflicted, misguided, bigoted, and harmful ""morality"" of Packer and the rest of his ilk.  I do not say or do good things because I am hopeful for a reward or fearful of punishment; I do so because I genuinely care about my fellow humans, and I seek to ease the challenges of coexistence that we all face.*

*The list of issues I find with the church's teachings and methods was six pages long when I first created it in October.  It has only grown.*

*The church's political actions disgust me.  I am thrilled to no longer be part of such a conniving and bigoted corporation.  I wish I had done this sooner.*

*I have thrown off the shackles of superstition.  I feel a greater sense of peace and responsibility for my own life.*

*The anxiety which I have struggled with my entire life has largely dissipated.  I am no longer depressed.  The fog of cognitive dissonance has lifted.*

*Perhaps I made a mistake in not making this clear from the start.  I kept the explanation of my decision as brief and light as I could so that I would not put you on the defensive.*

*I am interested in respectful and honest relationships in which both parties can be open and assertive.  I don't mind that you have a very different worldview, and I don't mind that you share your views with me.  I do care when you misrepresent my intentions.  I was completely honest with you, and I expect the same.*

*If you still want to buy into the lie propagated by the church that people only leave because they were ""offended"" or wanted to ""sin,"" then we are done.*

*If you are willing to look past the labels of ""agnostic"" or ""atheist"" or ""apostate,"" see me as a person with my own legitimate thoughts and ideas, and engage in thoughtful and honest dialogue, then I would love to continue to have a relationship with you.*


*Love,*

*[fierydart]*


Maybe it was kind of harsh.  It worked, anyway.  She sent me back a really nice email about how she respects my different beliefs and loves me no matter what.

I know a lot of us deal with super TBM family members, and we're afraid to approach them with our disbelief.  I think tip-toeing around the issues just makes things worse.  Better to get everything out in the open, and everyone on the same page.

It worked well for me.  I know it wouldn't work for everyone.  It's so hard to tell sometimes how a person will react.  Thoughts?

Every year on Mother's Day, I try to come up with something to say to make you feel special and to let you know how great of a mother you are, whether it be a sentimental card or a witty joke. Sometimes, I simply draw a picture like I used to when I was a kid. 26 is never too old to draw a stick figure monkey for your mother. This year, I long to do something different. I want to be real with you.

I know you've made mistakes. We all have. However, you always tried to do better than the day before, and you succeeded. You were a wonderful mother overall and despite what you or others might think, a wonderful role model.

I know you feel like you failed. I know you think you're nothing special. It breaks my heart to know how much of an issue you have understanding that you're a beautiful person. You don't need to continue to strive to be a good person. You already are.

On your journey through life, you found the LDS church. It has given you a purpose. It has given you an army of friends, community, and what you believe to be an eternal family. It has raised your happiness level tremendously, but you're still sad. You still believe that out of everything you do -- it's never enough. You're always trying to make up for things for which you have no reason to try. If you always compare yourself to perfection, you will always fall short.

I wish you could see yourself from my perspective. I wish you could know just how amazing and strong you really are; how much power and beauty you really hold. Because this is how I see you :

Every time you tell me you prayed and God gave you the strength to do something grand : I am proud of you. That is your own strength shining through. You have the ability to do anything you put your mind to.

Every time you tell me you worked hard, and God rewarded you with something good : I am proud of you. You did that for yourself. You put in all the effort and now get to enjoy the fruits of your labor.

When you tell me you were confused or overwhelmed and needed God's guidance to show you the way : I'm proud of you. You're smart. You found the way through your own introspection and problem solving techniques.

You are a beautiful, loving, wonderful, strong person and I wish you could see it from my view so you know just exactly how much I respect and applaud you. I do not give glory to a God, I give glory to you and all you have accomplished for yourself and for us. I am proud to call you ""Mother"".


Most importantly, I wish I could actually tell you this because it means so very much to me for you to know how much I love and respect you. I don't want to be 70 years old thinking back to a time when you were still here and wishing I would have told you. You are so much more than you allow yourself to realize. However, I can never explain exactly how amazing of a person I believe you are without offending and/or hurting you. Thus, I am left to spill my heart and tears to a few hundred people on a small sub-website because they're the only ones who might understand.

I love you, Mom. I only wish you could understand how much.

-Your Daughter.

EDIT : Thanks, everyone. I'm really glad to hear so many say they can relate to this. I wasn't actually planning on sending this to her because I was afraid she would take it more as a failing than a compliment, but I'm reconsidering.

1372807088.0,68,self.exmormon,1hj40z,Assistant professor at Weber State allegedly fired over the possible naming of a new building after Boyd,78,10,27,http://www.reddit.com/r/exmormon/comments/1hj40z/assistant_professor_at_weber_state_allegedly/,"I just received this email because I signed the petition concerning the naming of the new building at Weber State after Boyd.  If this is true, it is obviously an outrage.  I teach at a university also and so this especially outrages me.  Someone at Weber should keep us updated concerning this and see if they can find out what exactly happened and see if anyone writes the school newspaper expressing outrage over his termination.  If no one writes into the paper I will!  The email I received can be found below:

On May 6th, Shairylann Lisonbee wrote a letter to the editor, concerning the naming of a family outreach center at Weber State University after LDS Apostle Boyd K. Packer. She suggested that this was a bad idea, since the center was at a public university, and was intended to serve a diverse set of families in the community. The name was problematic because Brother Packer has forcefully spoken out against interracial and homosexual families in the past. It is possible to respect Boyd K. Packer as a person, and as a religious leader, without believing that it is a good idea to put his name on a family outreach center at a public university, given his past statements and views that oppose the loving families of so many. 

Inspired by her letter, I wrote my first change.org petition about this issue, borrowing many of her thoughts on the matter. The petition currently has 2,316 signatures. https://www.change.org/petitions/weber-state-university-do-not-name-your-center-for-family-cfce-after-boyd-k-packer. 

Shairylann's husband is on the faculty at Weber State University in the College of Education where the Packer Center is housed. When the name of the center was first announced, Jared Lisonbee suggested that naming the center after Brother Packer would alienate many of the very families that the center was intended to serve. He was the only member of the faculty at the meeting to express such obvious concerns.

It has recently come to my attention that Jared has now been removed from his position at the University, and all indications are that his removal was a result of his opposition to the naming of the family center, and of his wife's letter to the editor, and the resulting petition. I believe that this is a morally reprehensible action. If dissenting voices cannot even be heard at a public university, for fear of retaliation that might cost the person their job, then how can an open and free dialogue on the issues be maintained? I believe that this is a severe miscarriage of justice, and, if things are as they strongly appear, this is an apparent attempt by an individual to impose their vision of a harmful and hurtful religious orthodoxy on others at what is supposed to be a public university. 

With permission, I would like to quote the letter Shairylann wrote with her initial reaction to the firing of her husband:

""I'm in shock. My husband just lost his job over the naming of the Boyd K. Packer center at Weber State University. He is an assistant professor at Weber in the College of Education - the college responsible for the Packer center. Last year in the faculty meeting where the name for the family center was announced, he was THE ONLY person who protested the naming, mentioning that Packer was not viewed as friendly toward gays, academicians, feminists, and interracial couples. Since then, his department chair became increasingly hostile, making off-handed comments toward him like ""You know, Weber State is not a good fit for everyone."" On May 6th I wrote my letter to the editor that was published, criticizing naming the Weber's family center after Boyd K. Packer. I shouldn't have. Yesterday, out of the blue, my husband received a letter telling him that his contract would not be renewed, giving no reasons for the decision. It is so obviously related to our opposition to the naming of the Packer Center, but I doubt we could ever prove it. He is going to talk to people today about making a possible case for religious discrimination, but I'm sure we our going to be jobless in the end, and he will have an ugly professional strike against him. I hate that there is no real protection from the church in this state.""

Obviously I am very unhappy with what has happened here, and I also feel somewhat responsible, because I am the one that took her original letter to the editor, and turned it into a petition, that eventually ended up in the news, and that produced some bad press for Weber State, a result that may have partially motivated these reprehensible actions. Nevertheless, I feel like we have done the right thing here, despite the price that some have been forced to pay for speaking up. 

I would encourage everyone here to again take up the petition, and pass it around among all of your friends and family. Letting the faculty and administrators at Weber State know that there really are a large number of people who oppose their actions and decisions on this matter.

Please pass this on to those that you know, and spread the word. 

Thank you,

James L. Carroll

I told them that I wasn't really into family wards and politely declined. My dad suggested that I should go to the student ward that meets right before them. I saw this as an opportunity for something AWESOME. 

I walked into sacrament meeting, a few minutes late, everyone looked my way. I looked puzzled and stood there for a few minutes until a guy came up to me and invited me to sit with him and his friends. He whispered, ""are you new to the ward?"" I replied, ""whats a ward?"" ... Yes I had gone into a student ward where no one knew me, and I would for the next 2 hours...pretend to be ... an investigator. 

(I am horrible I know)

The word got around quickly that I wasn't LDS, and I couldn't believe how many people huddled around me with their fake smiles, and high pitched voices. ""Have you ever been to church before"" said a cheerful woman around age 20. ""I don't think so"" i replied. 

Oh this was just too good. 

We made our way to Sunday school... it was hilarious the way they made sure they watched what they said, I could tell that they were putting on a show.  We sat down and I can't remember exactly what the teacher said, but a ward member replied to him with an extremely bigoted reply about homosexuality. All eyes were on ME. I made a gesture that I was uncomfortable... the teacher hesitated, nervously laughed, and moved on. I started to shake my head. 

After the class, people came up to me and were making excuses for that guy, ""Oh he is just weird."" - damage control was in full force. I explained to people that I appreciated their kindness but I can't be part of an organization like this. They were disappointed and tried to reassure me that it's not always like this.  Someone had brought missionaries over to the crowd and had them introduce themselves to me. It became really awkward. I just said no thank you and didn't return. 

I thought I was was brilliant for that experiment, I thought I would pull something over on them... but I went away feeling really bummed out, not at all what I was expected to feel. It was interesting to see from an outsiders perspective how easy it is to spot in-authenticity in the members.

1363500658.0,71,self.exmormon,1agbi6,My personal rant on Mormon piano arrangements,79,8,73,http://www.reddit.com/r/exmormon/comments/1agbi6/my_personal_rant_on_mormon_piano_arrangements/,"Background: If you haven't seen me say this on exmo already, I've done piano for 12 years - I play/practice classical/romantic/baroque pieces, improvise, compose, teach, analyze (in awe) Bach's fugues, mindlessly wander the music theory areas of Wikipedia, etc. Its one of those things that I can consistently rely on for satisfaction- which is great, because its a life long hobby. Because of my personality, I strongly prefer solo playing - but that never stopped my mom from having me perform at church. Thus the need for a rant.

Let me just say this now: LDS piano arrangements are unbelievably cliche.

If you've seen one, you've seen them all. You really have.

Almost every song starts with twinkling high notes, about an octave or two above middle C, that whisper out the melody. After going through the melody once, the song tacks on some spontaneous thirds and raises the volume a tad. Every now and then you run across some fancy scale, or a snazzy up and down pattern, or a little 5 second thought that makes you forget about the melody for a little while. I think I shall coin this section ""LDS spirit prison"", because that's really what it is - biding time until an awkward climax feels semi-appropriate to prepare for.

So, when the time to prepare for climax comes, what does the arranger do?

Left hand arpeggios. Always climbing up and down the lower register. I have no idea when this musical mandate occurred in church piano arrangement history, but all I know is that it happens ALL THE TIME. Now, these can be cool, especially if you insert a countermelody or break out some crazy hemiola, but no - its always just plain jane tonic-subdominant-dominant circles. Again and again. 

After the song has been drowned out by dozens of low pedaled notes (since there is not much instruction in pedaling - trust me, my 12 year old self needed it), the arranger starts playing the melody in octave form. This happens in pretty much every piano arrangement. I'm tempted to say it always happens because I can't remember a song I played where this didn't happen for at least a little bit. 

The rest is just craziness - a bunch of octaves, sometimes with their corresponding 3rd or 5th; a pointless bad-sounding scale; and just lots of pedal and notes. After disorientation (from the spirit ;D), the twinkly intro comes back and ends with a high chord (optional: mimic the high chord with a pretty low one).

And there you have it. Your average church arrangement. It was sort of my dorm room joke/ party trick at BYU to make fun of church arrangements by improv'ing them. We all found it hilarious and so true (I had an awesome dorm BTW - 3/7 of us are on missions - sinners!). Its really not that hard though - I take no pride in being able to do this, because its so goddamned formulaic.

But the worst part about these songs is that so many Mormon people just eat it up. The songs are ""beautiful"", according to the speakers that follow their regular sacrament meeting performance. LDS arrangements exist and endure all thanks to sacrament meeting, a place where criticism isn't allowed.

And there's only a handful of people that pretty much own the LDS music arrangement world.
We've got the old Janice Kapp Perry (who personifies Mormonism - look at this [image] (http://userserve-ak.last.fm/serve/_/44595067/Janice+Kapp+Perry+janice_kapp_perry.gif)). Marvin Goldstein. Sally DeFord. Jon Schmidt (I actually had an improv sesh with this guy once - funny story). Paul Cardall (a newcomer). And so on.

I played Marvin in church the most - so my arrangement description is probably biased towards his style - but not by much.

It just makes me sad when people only know LDS-Utah pianists. If you must confine yourself to religious music, there is plenty of old stuff! Bach was incredibly devout, and he had more skill in his little contrapuntal fingers than all of the composers above combined hahaha. MEGEHGHHG

And why does the song have to always be happy? I want a melancholy song, a rage song, an experimental song, maybe even a humorous song! 

Mormon music is much like the Mormon church at large, in that they can both be described as ""canned happiness"". Think about it - imagine a physical can with ""happy"" in it.

1360260350.0,66,self.exmormon,182rgu,A misplaced towel and John Dehlin result in threats of divorce,74,8,63,http://www.reddit.com/r/exmormon/comments/182rgu/a_misplaced_towel_and_john_dehlin_result_in/,"On Monday, I mentioned John Dehlin's most recent podcast to my wife, and told her that he had returned to regular church activity, albeit with an extremely liberal definition of what it means to believe. I said I felt that he was motivated to return to activity to keep his marriage intact, baptize his son, and to be have access to the large market share of LDS/struggling LDS population in Utah in need of professional counseling. She's only listened to a few MS podcasts, but knows I found great value in them, and we frequently discussed them when I was exiting the church.

Well, she'd been ornery ever since Monday afternoon, but I didn't think much of it. She gets ornery on a regular basis, and I gave up trying to figure out the reasons why years ago. I usually just sit back and let it pass. Typically it lasts a few hours, or maybe overnight. It seldom lasts more than 24 hours.

Wednesday evening we got in a tiff over a towel left on my office chair. I assumed it was dirty, left there by one of the kids, and put it in the hamper. Turns out it was clean, and she'd left it there temporarily on her way to do something else. She got mad I put it in the dirty clothes, I got mad that she got after me for something so benign. Typically, we have the good sense to stop being jerks to each other as soon as tiffs like this start, but not last night. We're both tired, and both fighting our 3rd cold in as many months. Plus, I was getting fed up with 3 nights of her orneriness.

Things escalated, we take a few more jabs at each other, and I could tell a full on fight was imminent. I decided to cut straight to the heart of my concerns and said ""What's really bothering you? You've been difficult to be around for a couple of days now, and it's getting old."" After some back and forth, she says ""If John Dehlin, who knows the problems with the church better than you, can come back to the church to save his marriage and to baptize his son, why can't you?""

In that instant, I felt all the work and progress we'd been making as a mixed-faith couple cracking. In her heart of hearts, she thinks I have the ability to come back to full activity. I reiterated that I think Dehlin went back for financial reasons, to keep his family intact, and I suspect to maintain his credibility for believing members who are starting to doubt. He provides an invaluable service to those starting to doubt, and knowing he is a believing member gives them the courage to listen to what is being said. It also gives the credibility necessary to show videos like ""Why Mormon's Leave?"" to their TBM spouses, just like I did to her.

I continued that I think someone’s ability to stay in the church after learning the whole truth has more to do with personality than anything else, any my personality doesn't fit the mold. John has always expressed a deep love and fondness for Mormon culture, something I've never shared or felt. I started disliking Mormon culture in my teens, years before I had doctrinal, historical, and ethical problems with their teachings. She said, ""What if I gave you an ultimatum like that? What if I told you that I need to be married to a temple worthy, fully active, priesthood holder to be happy?""

I go from frustrated to scared at this point, and say ""You would be asking me to sacrifice my mental health, my budding authenticity, and my happiness if you insisted I go back. That's a pretty tall order, even to save something as valuable as our marriage. I have faith that you wouldn't do that to me, that you married me not the church. But, if you did draw that line in the sand and if your happiness depended on it, I suppose I'd have to do what I believe is best for me and the children. I don't know exactly what that looks like, but I do know it does not involve the church in any way. And the only reason they go to church now is for you. So if you cut me out of this family, I would do everything I could to bring the children with me, and all references and involvement with the LDS church would disappear from their lives when you did.""

So, in the true bodona fashion, I've escalated a few sharp words over a misplaced towel to a direct threat of divorce and nasty custody battle. she's an excellent mother, and I wouldn't want sole custody any more than I want a divorce, but I've gone full ass hole on her. I recognize I'm out of control, and correct myself saying ""Sorry, that was out of line, and not how I really feel. I'm angry and hurt that you would threaten me with divorce over a church you don't even 100% believe in, and was trying to scare and hurt you back. We have a lot going for us in this relationship, and I know we'd both regret letting something like religion split us up."" She says she doesn't know what she wants, but that having a mixed-faith marriage might not work in the long term. She's tried inactivity and felt incomplete. She's trying full activity right now and is feeling incomplete.

To me it's a sign that TSCC is indeed feeling the pinch of growing secularism and people increasingly identifying as agnostic or atheist.  For the Mormon church to say ""Just go to church, whatever church that is"" is just mind boggling to me.

I tried explaining that you are supposed to be feeling the Spirit of God so strongly, that it totally moves you to emotion. When someone is crying at the pulpit, they are no longer using their own words or thoughts - they are a direct mouthpiece of God, and the things they are saying are glorious to hear.

They kind of understood it, and it finally hit me - I reminded them that when Pentecostals want people to know God is inside them, they writhe around and speak in tongues. They totally understood this one, and made the Mormon crying much easier to comprehend.

It got me thinking about how the crying is a learned behavior. I mean, if truth is all around us, then anyone who speaks about Christ being the One Redeemer should also cry, not just Mormons. So, crying is a learned behavior that we emulate from people who are held in high esteem.

I started thinking about if the speaking in gibberish is also learned behavior, and it freaked me out.",,False,self,t5_2r0gj,False,,,True,t3_1h6mmr,http://www.reddit.com/r/exmormon/comments/1h6mmr/crying_the_mormon_version_of_speaking_in_tongues/,

Even if they **did** love gay people, which their actions and doctrines clearly show is untrue, they haven't accepted responsibility for the decades in which they caused suffering for thousands of LGBT people.

They sent people to 'treatments' where patients had their genitals electrocuted when shown pictures of what is, for them, normal sexual behavior.

They shunned and shamed LGBT family members.

They taught LBGT people that they were permanent sinners, causing grief, depression, and suicide.

You don't get to 'change your tune a little bit' and act like nothing happened.  Responsible people and responsible organizations own up to their mistakes.  They apologize.  TSCC has done neither.

Since I said hi, they asked if they could help. I told them if they didn't mind carrying up my case of beer and coffee that I would be more than happy to speak to them about why I'm not Mormon, but they probably didn't want to talk to me.  

Anyways I sat them down and since they didn't speak much but asked why I left the church and why I went on a my mission, I gave the finest calm rebuttal of their method of finding truth, and that as I could not have faith that the tree outside my house does not exist, that the level of evidence is such that it would take literally an angel appearing to me and probably others in order to believe the church is true. I brought out my copy of ""By His Own Hand"" and showed them a picture of the papyrus, then explained to the Elder from London that because of the Rosetta Stone he has seen with his own eyes we can translate this, and it doesn't match up. Explained that no, Mustangs did not exist in America, and that horses were killed off in 12,000 BC until the Spanish brought them here. Explained why Guns, Germs and Steel disproves the BOM without even trying.  

By the end I had tuckered myself out of talking, and asked them to share their message. To which the senior companion replied that he had an appointment in 5 minutes, and then the junior asked ""we do?"" He then told me that everything I said was false and that the book was lying even though I told him they were printed in the Improvement era in the 60s. As he was running away from the son of perdition he said that there was nothing we could say to each other and that talking with me further was a waste of both of our time.  I gave them both enough cogdis that they are going to have to tell each other how evil I am for quite some time.
