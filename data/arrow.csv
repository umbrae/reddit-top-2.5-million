I used to practice archery, but I was never very good. I had really lost interest in the hobby until I started watching *Arrow*. The show kind of awoke my interest, so I recently decided I would get back to it.

I decided that this morning would be the first time I really dedicated some time to practicing, so I got up before dawn and broke out the recurve. I live in an apartment complex and have nowhere to practice, so I drove out to this large plot of public land to have some space where I wouldn't be bothering anybody at such an early hour. I set out my target, moved back a hundred feet, and started firing off some arrows.

By and large, I was shooting terribly. I was all over the outside of the target. During my second volley of arrows, it started to drizzle. I hadn't checked the forecast, and I hadn't thought to bring a jacket. I went to my trunk to look for a jacket, and the only thing I had was a lightweight parka (with a hood very similar to the vigilante's.) I put it on and went back to shooting.

I was almost finished with my fourth volley of arrows when it really started pouring. I didn't want to risk any damage to any of my stuff, so I was about to pack it in when I realized I only had one arrow left in my quiver anyway. So I thought, ""What the hell. I'll fire this last shot and then go."" So, hood up, in the pouring rain: I draw my last arrow, take aim, and then for the fun of it mumble to myself *""You have failed this city.""* I released, landing my first and only bullseye. 

I knew my day wasn't getting any better from there. How could anything surpass momentarily becoming the Hood?",,False,,t5_2u4js,False,,,True,t3_1ff6qp,http://www.reddit.com/r/arrow/comments/1ff6qp/i_went_full_arrow_this_morning/,
