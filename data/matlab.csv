1375708176.0,75,self.matlab,1jqk8t,You should never use the default colors in Matlab. This is why and what you can do about it.,83,8,29,http://www.reddit.com/r/matlab/comments/1jqk8t/you_should_never_use_the_default_colors_in_matlab/,"**Summary**

Matlab's default 'Jet' colormap will obscure real patterns while showing you imaginary ones; [example](http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-mNVpcIxosyQ/T49UZSQMkqI/AAAAAAAAABk/Q7wiklw2LmE/s1600/different+colormaps+jet+bad+crop.tiff). The default line color styles are hard to distinguish and hard to even see!

**The problem**

Humans are not equally perceptive to all colors. Jet is just the most simple way possible to move through color space; [graph here](http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-maP_jZdLNSk/UWxnTqZR85I/AAAAAAAADfc/yT0D7GFKMoE/s1600/raw_vals_jet.png). Experts have designed color schemes in which two colors are spaced out equally in *perceptual* space making for an artifact free colormap; [graph here](http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-drhJFuk-ZqE/UWxnTtFHNrI/AAAAAAAADfY/g1csvWP0Mic/s1600/raw_vals_colorm.png).


**The solution:**

* [linspecer](http://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/42673-beautiful-and-distinguishable-line-colors-+-colormap) this is a handpicked mixture of colorbrewer schemes packaged to be easy to use. Pass it 'N' and you will get N distinguishable colors. Pass it nothing and you have a colormap. (Full disclosure this is my file, comments/criticism welcome).

* [cbrewer](http://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/34087) will give you every colobrewer option ever. This is your expert option, you need to know the names of the scheme you want and are ready to modify the schemes yourself to make the yellow's darker.

* [colorbrewer](http://www.colorbrewer.org) is the gold standard for colormaps, by cynthia brewer. The two files above make colorbrewer trivial to implement in Matlab, but the colorbrewer online user interface is easy to use too.

* [lbmap](http://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/17555-light-bartlein-color-maps) has four colormaps for the colorblind and is really easy to use.

* [haxby](http://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/25690-haxby-color-map) is most similar to jet, designed for marine maps. Isn't as good as the options above but far better than the default.

* [varycolor](http://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/21050-varycolor) Does **not** provide well spaced colors. use linspecer or cbrewer instead.

**Use examples** (thx [tedwick](http://www.reddit.com/r/matlab/comments/1jqk8t/you_should_never_use_the_default_colors_in_matlab/cbhbs8b))

* colormap(linspecer);

Replace the default colormap:

* set(0,'DefaultFigureColormap',linspecer);
* set(0,'DefaultFigureColormap',cbrewer('seq','YlOrRd',64));

Set the color order separately for each plot. Replace '8' with the number of lines you have.

* set(0,'DefaultAxesColorOrder',linspecer(8))
* set(0,'DefaultAxesColorOrder',cbrewer('qual','Set2',8))

Always increase line thickness to make nicer plots and better perceive color difference.

* set(0,'DefaultLineLineWidth',2)
* set(0,'DefaultLineLineWidth',1.2)

Now, I understand the basis of the question but I don't get why are the terminal nodes relevant in matlab (I don't even know how to use them I'm looking into this [here](http://www.mathworks.com/help/toolbox/wavelet/ref/tnodes.html) right now).

But, I recently misplaced my iPod, so I've had to resort to my old crappy mp3 player.

It orders all the tracks alphabetically, so unless I want to listen to all the Track 01's, then all the Track 02's, I've got to rename the files, taking into account the disc number.

It's easy enough to, for example, name all the tracks in a folder ""Disc 01"" then it automatically puts (2), (3), (4) after them, but I believe my player did not like the parentheses.

Since I have no idea what I'm doing in Command Prompt, but have been using Matlab for years, I wrote a Matlab script that will output the code I need, which I then just copy/paste into Command Prompt.

I've put it here in case anyone might find this useful.

    % FOR RENAMING AUDIOBOOK FILES
    % 
    % PROBLEM:
    % Audiobook files are not sorted in the correct order on player
    %
    % SOLUTION:
    % Rename files so that sorting by filename puts them in the correct order
    %
    % When you rip the CD onto your computer, it should make a new folder for
    % the book which contains folders for each disk.
    
    % For each of the disk folders:
    % 1) Open the folder and make sure the files are sorted by track number.
    % 2) Select All (Ctrl + A), Right Click on first file, and click Rename
    % 3) Type in a short tag to identify the book (ex: 'LF' for Lord of the
    % Flies), and hit Enter
    
    % All the files in the folder should have been renamed to:
    
    % LF
    % LF (2)
    % LF (3)
    % etc.
    
    % 4) Rename the first one from ""LF"" to ""LF (01)"", and also add a ""0"" to
    % numbers 1-9 so they look like this:
    
    % LF (01)
    % LF (02)
    % LF (03)
    % etc.
    
    % 5) Put the short book tag you chose here:

    book='LF';
    
    % 6) Put ""ren "" and then the path of the audiobook folder here (the folder
    % containing all the disk folders). The path must contain no spaces and
    % must end with a slash:

    path='ren C:\Users\Tyler\Desktop\LordoftheFlies\';
    
    % 7) Enter the number of files in each disk folder (ex: disk 1 had 10
    % files, disks 2-5 had 9 files, and disk 6 had 10 files):

    n=[10 9 9 9 9 10];
    
    % 8) Go to Folder Options in the Control Panel, and under the View tab,
    % UN-select the box that says ""hide extensions for known file types""
    
    % 9) Enter the file extension you see here (include the dot):

    file_type='.wma';
    
    % 10) Copy/Paste this script into matlab, and run it.
    
    % 11) The command window should spit out something that resembles:
    
    % ren C:\Users\Tyler\Desktop\LordoftheFlies\LF01\""LF01 (01).wma"" ""LF0101.wma""
    % ren C:\Users\Tyler\Desktop\LordoftheFlies\LF01\""LF01 (02).wma"" ""LF0102.wma""
    % ren C:\Users\Tyler\Desktop\LordoftheFlies\LF01\""LF01 (03).wma"" ""LF0103.wma""
    % ren C:\Users\Tyler\Desktop\LordoftheFlies\LF01\""LF01 (04).wma"" ""LF0104.wma""
    % ren C:\Users\Tyler\Desktop\LordoftheFlies\LF01\""LF01 (05).wma"" ""LF0105.wma""
    % &gt;&gt;
    
    % 12) Copy/Paste this text (minus the ""&gt;&gt;"") into Command Prompt, and hit
    % Enter
    
    % 13) All of the file names should now resemble LF####.wma with the first two
    % numbers being the disc number, and the last two numbers being the track
    % number. When sorted alphabetically, the whole book will be in the correct
    % order!

differences to make manual translation too time consuming.

SMOP is not a polished product, nor a replacement to Octave and
Matlab. Taking into account its size (less than 3000 lines), this is
not surprizing.  There are no toolboxes.  Small everyday functions
(max, length, etc.) are recognized and supported, but that's all.

What would you like to see in one?,12,4,10,http://www.reddit.com/r/matlab/comments/uk3ux/would_you_be_interested_in_an_inexpensive_matlab/,"Background: I've been programming in general for over 15 years, and in Matlab for 8-9 years. I'm teaching an undergraduate programming course in Matlab and Python next year, and I'm not finding too many good books for the Matlab side of things.

The problem is that there are plenty of ""Python for Dummies,"" ""Learn Python Fast,"" ""Python for Literally Brain-Damaged Individuals"" type books, but the Matlab textbooks mostly seem like they are intended for engineers and math geeks. There are some that are better than others, but still nothing that seems geared towards the true novice, with an emphasis on being non-intimidating.

I am well aware that online tutorials and such (and the Matlab help system) are a great way to learn (that's how I did it), but many of my students will be wanting a more linear textbook, so I'm thinking of just writing one myself. It probably wouldn't get done in time for the fall semester, but hopefully would be ready for the next school year.

My model would be something like ""Learn Python the Hard Way,"" not so much in exact content but in length (short-ish), approachability / pacing / tone, and price ($3 for an electronic copy).

My first two questions to you are: Do you think the community (you) would be interested in something like this? Does it already exist and I'm just not finding it?

If the answers are yes and no, respectively, what would you like to see addressed? My audience for the class is psychology / cognitive neuroscience majors, but the book would be about Matlab programming more generally. However, I don't want to get into heavy numerical analysis topics like many books do -- I was thinking more general programming topics like program flow and data structures, along with making basic plots, light statistics / data analysis / matrix manipulation, etc.

Basically I think the goal would be to lightly introduce a bunch of topics but mostly focus on the Matlab language and programming ethos, so that students can then bootstrap their way to doing whatever actual programming job they need to do. Does that sound like a good approach? What topics would you all most like to see touched upon if I go this way?

I am a CS major.  I don't need to take this class, but did so voluntarily for many reasons.  One of them  is that MATLAB seems like an incredibly powerful tool that would be really beneficial to know.

The course is required, though, for most engineering majors at my school.  What baffles me is that it has a reputation among a lot of them as being one of the most despised and dreaded classes that they have to take.  The prof did a survey on the first day and it turned out that over half of the students taking it were seniors.  This indicates that they put it off for as long as possible, and oddly, until *after* they have completed the bulk of their coursework that MATLAB could help them with.  Note that there are no prereqs for the class and it is listed as a 1000-level course.

This baffles me.  I'm in my freshman year of my program and after less than a week I'm already realizing how kick ass it's going to be knowing MATLAB *before* taking courses like Calc II and III, Physics, and various other classes.

The question is, is this mentality among engineering students that MATLAB is just a box to check off on their way to their degree common?  If so, any speculation as to why this is the case?

I have talked to some people who say that it's the programming aspect of MATLAB that discourages a lot of people.  The programming environment seems like it's fairly easy compared to other languages to me.  Granted, as a CS major I have a different perspective, but it really doesn't seem like it should be that difficult to learn, especially by smart people who have survived some extremely tough engineering courses.

One student did also express doubt about whether MATLAB is used much in the professional world.  But other students countered that they had seen it used in their experience.

I guess I'm just confused.  This tool seems like an incredibly powerful one that engineering students should *want* to have in their arsenal.  What's with the disdain?",,False,,t5_2r4xn,False,,,True,t3_oe1ui,http://www.reddit.com/r/matlab/comments/oe1ui/does_matlab_get_a_bad_rap/,

Shortcuts I use all the time (some are pretty basic, but I still didn't know them 2-3 years into using matlab):

* Spacebar in Simulink makes it so you can see the entire chart on the screen
* hitting the up arrow in the terminal brings up previous commands
* In the terminal, there's a little fx by the arrow where you type.  If you click on this, a menu of commonly used functions in categories pops up
* The start button in the lower left hand corner is also useful and something I did not know existed until last year
* In order to make a subsystem in Simulink, highlight the blocks you want in the subsystem, right click, and hit create subsystem
* Screwed up your indenting somewhere?  Highlight what you want to change and then hit ctrl-i

Since I don't have a blog or anything public to toss this onto, I figured I'd make a self-post just for anybody who's searching on Google for this problem. 

I recently tried installing Matlab 2012b on a VPS (yeah, probably already not a great idea). It would crash on anything computationally intensive, and as I kept digging into more and more of my old code and changing large matrices to sparse matrices and so on (shh; don't think so much, it worked), I kept getting nowhere. 

The error I got was similar to http://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/answers/13490 (i.e. with libpthread.so.0 libmwmcr.so libc.so.6 featured prominently) and in addition I would get 

OMP: Error #13: Assertion failure at kmp_runtime.c(8039).
OMP: Hint: Please submit a bug report with this message, compile and run commands used, and machine configuration info including native compiler and operating system versions. Faster response will be obtained by including all program sources. For information on submitting this issue, please see http://www.intel.com/software/products/support/.

on the command line (if I ran Matlab from matlab &amp;). 

So, I tried fixing the gnu c library and c++ library files and their links and installed matlab-support package and so on. None of these fixed the problem. 

Furthermore, I found I could replicate it with almost any intensive task (so by this point I was testing using the bench command, which would crash out pretty immediately). 

Sadly, I never found a good fix. I tried 11.10 and 12.04 64-bit versions of Ubuntu, and those had consistently the same error (despite having different C libraries; I think one was 2.13 and the new one was 2.17/2.15). 

In any case, the proper solution (at least for me) was to simply move to 11.10 32-bit Ubuntu, and rollback to 32-bit Matlab (of which the last version was 2012a). 

If anybody has this problem, this is your fix. Good luck! ",,False,,t5_2r4xn,False,,,True,t3_1aawtq,http://www.reddit.com/r/matlab/comments/1aawtq/matlab_on_linux_fix_crash_on_libcso6/,

The gist is that there is a function that randomly generates winds in the x and y direction with respective forces of Fx and Fy (both vectors), over a random duration of time, that pushes our hovering drone around. We have to write a function that generates counteractive forces (scalars Cx and Cy) to try to keep the drone as close to its starting position as possible.


The inputs/results are as follows:


function [Cx,Cy] = Controller (step, Fx, Fy, location, velocities, controller)


%location, velocities, and controller are all vectors containing all previous values of their respective data. location of the craft, velocity of the craft, and past controls used to oppose the force of wind. step is delta t (change in time).


 I was thinking about solving F = ma, where a = dV/dt = (V(new)-V(old))/dt, and V = dx/dt following the same train of thought.

I was planning on using the known forces applied to the craft to find where it would end up if no restoring force was applied, then find the magnitude of the distance to calculate restoring forces in the X and Y directions and apply an increment of that at each step.


The only issue is, I dont think I can do that, seeing as the force of the wind is randomly generated every single time the code is run/tested, and I'm not sure how to solve ODEs in a way that makes sense when i put it into code.

1) I have my own little code repo of functions from years of working with matlab. Stuff like hline, vline, saveppt2, and other functions from everywhere.

This is a perfect example of how git submodules should work. You add a project/file as a submodule. Check it out and tada. All of those files. If anyone grabs your project they also just need to init submodules.

2) I never know if I'm running the latest version. I may have an awesome tool but it's not like I have time to go through every project I've downloaded and check for new files.

I have to first do some digging to make sure that I don't tick anyone off. But most all of the files submitted to the File Exchange should be a BSD license. It'd just be an issue with scraping their website. I was thinking of a scraper that went through projects. Parsed last update. If it was updated download, unzip, commit to a git repository and push.

I want to create a library so that if a song in the playlist has previously been analysed by an earlier run-through of the program, it will just pull the data from the library instead of having to re-analyse the mp3.

Now I've come up with a couple options on how to do this, but I'm not sure what is the best option or if anyone has any better ideas.

I originally wanted to create a cell called library that would store the song data in library{x,1}, the song location as a string in library{x,2}, and the song name as a string in library{x,3}, where x is the row number. But I realized the problem with this is I can't find a way to save the cell so that it isn't rewritten from scratch everytime I run the program. So I need a way to save the file externally so it can be accessed anytime.

My next thought was to either use a .txt file or an excel file. This would get around the problem of the library being rewritten everytime I run the program. However this creates a new problem, that the song data has upwards of 400 000 data points, which would be cumbersome to store in a .txt or excel. That's why I originally wanted to store everything in a cell.

I hope I wasn't too confusing. If anyone has any insights on the best way to create the library it would be much appreciated.

I simply cannot get the ODE solver to work properly. I have tried all the different ODE solvers within MATLAB and the error is the same.

So to explain in a bit of detail, I have to plot the partial pressures or mass flowrates through the gasification reactor. When the ODE is called it runs without issue and proceeds to output a graph of the required data.
The issue is that the data is wrong (e.g. I seem to be producing oxygen when it should be consumed). Using debug mode I have had a look at the input and output for this single variable and during each time step the results are fine (reaction rate is very slow) but then between timesteps, the ODE solver does not use the output from the last timestep as input for the new one, its just making one up. 

Can somebody tell  me whats going wrong with this?

all the best

The output data is semicolon delimited, and I usually just use textscan() to read in data like this. However, how do I define the FORMAT string so it accounts for rows that are different size?

A basic example of the data:    
     0;12345;FIRSTNAME1;LASTNAME1;;COURSENAME;00:07:00;C;0;09:00:00;101;+;09:02:00;102;+; ...

Basically, what happens is they can trip the same gate multiple times during the runthrough, which will add a column to their results. This is fine and I can filter it out later, but I need to get the data read in first. I can use textscan(fid,'%s','Delimiter',';') but this obliterates the rows. I could also use fgetl() and use textscan() on each line, but I think I'd still run into a similar problem.

I have an application in which I am trying to use image analysis to take over one component of data acquisition for some experiments I am running.   I'm pretty new to Matlab, but I've worked my way through the relevant tutorials on image analysis and I feel like I'm getting up to speed.

What it boils down to is that I'm hoping to analyze black marks on pieces of white paper in a series of images I have taken. 
 
I've uploaded a couple of sample images [here](http://imgur.com/OkxW7,C5d2N).

Primarily the attributes of the markings I am interested in include the 'coordinates' of each mark within the image, and the overall area of each mark in pixels.  If I could feed in an image, and have it output a table of the aforementioned attributes for each marking found, I'd be pretty ecstatic with my result.

The images I've got to work with are a 'first iteration', if you will, and are very rough - the lighting isn't the best, they are snapped by a tiny hand held camera, and I'm not really using all of the entire resolution of the camera available. 

I have been trying a similar approach to the 'grains of rice' example in the Matlab tutorials, and it seems to work pretty well without significant modification (convert section of jpeg to .PNG to grayscale to standard binary picture).  However, this all requires that the illumination is somewhat uniform.

It works well if I take small sections of the sample image I've linked to here, but take into account the overall illumination pattern of the flash, and it gets pretty sketchy. I can't claim to fully understand the method of subtracting the background illumination they use in the grains of rice example, but fine tuning the size of the object seems to be pretty fruitless because the markings on the paper are so small.

My questions to you guys, are:

* Am I missing some useful method or function for reducing the issue of the non-uniform illumination?

* How much easier does this process get if my pictures are higher resolution or better lit?  (Do I get more bang for my buck from getting a better camera?  Or should I simply focus on better lighting?)

* How difficult would it be to automate\script the process (ie. I throw in an image and receive a table with the information i'm interested in?)

I'd hugely appreciate any pointers you guys could throw my way!

I played around with some of the camera options but each plot just remained plastered on top of each other.

I don't know if I made myself understandable, but the bottom line is that I want to find a way of making this data presentable because its present iteration is ugly as fuck. I don't know if matlab is capable of this, or if I should procure some other software meant for presenting data.

I am using MATLAB in conjunction with a finite-element simulation program (COMSOL) that solves for some physics with a time-stepping method. How it works is basically for each time-step in COMSOL, it executes my MATLAB function and returns the output. My MATLAB function is modeling a complex process and its output depends on many variables from within my function from the previous timestep. However, variables from inside of a function are lost after the function returns its output, so I need to store them somewhere. I have been saving them to a .mat file at the end of my function call and loading them from that .mat file at the start of my function call as a means to communicate this data between the different timesteps. This method was working fine for 2-D finite element simulations, however in 3-D simulations the variable sizes are much larger and the saving loading time becomes too large.

My variables.mat file that I am loading is ~25 MB, containing 2 structures, 2 1x1 doubles, a 1x1 scatteredInterpolant, a 200x1 double, a 50000x1 double, and a 50000x200 double. It takes approximately 17 seconds to load this .mat file from the hard drive and 1 second to save it (on a computer with 64GB RAM and dual Intel Xeon X5690 processors). These loading times are far too large for my simulation to run in a reasonable amount of time, as COMSOL may need to compute hundreds or thousand+ of timesteps.

I am looking for a way to store these variable in the RAM somehow, rather than saving or loading from the hard drive. Or possibly find a way to keep variables from a function saved in the workspace, although I'm not sure this method would work because COMSOL may be opening a ""new"" MATLAB session for each time-step/function call.

Is there a way to keep track of 6 or 7 variables from within a function, other than to load and save them from the hard drive?

Some brief background: I have a 2D matrix of data that I’m trying to plot using contourf.  This data is the year that a satellite timeseries experiences a distinct change in its mean.  For example, the cloud cover over an area may have changed due to some underlying human activity that occurred in 2008 and should be reflected in the analysis I’m performing.

Now, this 2D matrix contains some years where the change occurred, but it also contains numerous NaNs where either there previously wasn’t any data (in which the NaN has been carried through my analysis) or in the analysis there was a disagreement on where the change year occurred (in which I’ve coded these grid points to be NaN).  There is no a priori knowledge about where there will be NaNs.

In my plotting with contourf, I have designated a colorbar from blue&gt;white&gt;red representing low&gt;medium&gt;high values.  The problem I’m having is that when I contourf natively, I see the funky colors that I should as I’m using the default “rainbow” colorbar, and I also see plenty of white space where (presumably) the NaNs are and are not being plotted.  This becomes an issue when trying to use my colorbar, where white values DO take on some meaningful value, but in the plot the white color not only represents the meaningful value but is also where the NaNs are not plotted.

Is there any way to outline continuous regions of the plot where there are reported change years?  Is my best bet to change the medium color in my colorbar to something other than white, a solution which I’d rather avoid as this type of colorbar is widely accepted?  Is there a way to explicitly specify a color for NaN values, say green?

Thanks for any input!

I am a primary teacher (majoring in science) at university and am currently completing a presentation for my final assignment. Simply put, i am trying to find a way for matlab to express my results however i am struggling to see if its even possible at all.


We are studying heat diffusion through the use of differential equations.

**What i'm trying to do**

Simulate the sequence of drops and the differential temperatures at specific locations on a metallic plate and how it varies over time. 

The plate is 1m x 1m and the experiment begins with the initial temperature of the plate being 0 degrees Celsius. 



I have minimal knowledge in matlab however I have gotten to this point and cant work out how i can loop matlab to read my values to plot it on the graph.

**My Code**

% Initialze the size and temperature of the metallic plate

mplate=zeros(100,100);

%Get data for the Temperatures from File

 T= importdata ('U:\PHYS3203\input1.txt')
 
 %Seperate the Coloumns to define each coloumn individually

 v1= T(:,1)

 v2= T(:,2)

 v3= T(:,3)

 v4= T(:,4)

 v5= T(:,5)

 v6= T(:,6)

**Where i Need Help**

I am not sure how i can create a loop to read the values from my file (see below) so matlab will simulate the sequence of the drops of the liquid.

I have used the vectors v1-v6 to define:

v1 = temperature of the drop (dropTemp)

v2 and v3 = grid x-coordinate interval where the drop lands;

v4 and v5 = grid y-coordinate interval where the drop lands;

v6 = time instant (in seconds) when the drop touches the metallic plate.

Where each vector is represented in the corresponding collumn from the matrix i created.

*I am aware that i should be looping from 0-15 seconds with an approximate 0.5s (maybe less) pause/steps. 

I am thinking i should be verifying when the drop touches the plate the current temperature of the plate (i,j) should have its new(current) temperature updated to tij=tij+dropTemp

I then want the surrounding grids on the plate (the surrounding 8 neighbor cells) to be updated.

*(im using a simplified version of the heal diffusion differential equation)*
**tm.n=tm.n+0.1*ti.j/8**

Im going to fix the z axis to [-100, 100] ...unless you think it should be more or less.


**My Data from testing**

Sometime it works only for a few seconds and sometimes it lasts for a couple of minutes but it will fail sooner or later. Could someone tell me how to prevent this?

I'm writing a small program to find the response of an oscillating system under what's called ""Coulomb Damping"". Basically, every half cycle the equation of motion alternates between forms. If that's not clear, here's the loop I wrote so far:

for i = 1:100;

    A(i) = x0 - (2*i-1)*del;

    t(i) = (i-1)*pi/wn:0.0001:i*pi/wn;

    if rem(i, 2) == 0;

        x(i) = A(i)*cos(wn*t(i)) - del;

    else

        x(i) = A(i)*cos(wn*t(i)) + del;

    end

end


Each half cycle needs an 'A' constant, which the loop provides, and the if statement is my way of determining if the oscillation is on it's way up or down.

The error is with the time: the t(i) line. It's written like it's a vector, when really I want to break the time down into increments of half the period. I guess the question I'm trying to ask is how can I apply a time increment in a way that I'll eventually be able to plot (t(i),x(i)) and it will know what I'm talking about?

I've been making a point lately to linearize my code as much as possible, getting rid of inelegant for loops.  It's getting better, but this particular instance I can't quite get there.  I'll explain:

It's data analysis based on a choice task, and for N (~20K) trials, I have and Nx1 array of integers (call it param), each corresponding to a parameter for that trial (many repeats, obviously).  I also have an Nx1 logical array that's 1 when choice 1 was made, and 0 when choice 2 was made.  We can call this variable ""choice"".

What I want to do is calculate for each parameter value, what fraction of the time did they make choice 1?  For example, if the parameter value is 7, I want to find all trials with a value of 7, and see how many of these they chose 1 on.  I can trivially do this with a for loop (just loop through each parameter value and use mean(find())) but I want to find out if I can linearize this.

What I have so far:  I'm using allparams=unique(param) to get a list of all param values, then using [~,x]=ismember(param,allparams) to get a sorted numbering for each trial.  That gets me around the problem of having to find each parameter value, but I still need the for loop to isolate params.

Ideas?  I'm sure someone will come through with one line of code and make me feel stupid.  Can't wait.  I suspect it has something to do with dotting param and choice, but can't think what.

I'm putting together an interface for a large program and it's simply not going to fit on a single window when it's all completed, so I'm planning on using a primary window as a hub for opening up secondary windows that handle sections of the program, particularly things like user input. Passing data from the primary hub window to the secondary windows is easy enough, I just use the input arguments when calling the function like normal.

The problem I'm encountering is that I don't know how to properly pass data changed by the user in the secondary windows back to the primary hub window so that it can then be passed to any of the other secondary windows. When I try using the output arguments, it doesn't change anything in the main window; I'm assuming that's because both windows' functions have already finished running before the user makes any changes. So how do I get it to pass the data back properly? I've seen things saying to use the user appdata folder or similar, but I want to keep it all contained within the program if at all possible. I've also been told using global variables is a possibility, but that it would likely require calling a function to explicitly update the variables every time a window gains focus; not desirable, obviously.

If it's unclear what I want to do, it's basically this:

1. Call program function to open the main GUI window

2. Click button to open second window and pass variables to it

3. User modifies data passed to it within the second window

4. Data changes are passed back to the main window upon button click or close of the second window so that it can be used elsewhere

I have thought about making the secondary windows nested functions within the main window and taking advantage of the cross-function variable scope, which I think would work, but that has drawbacks. I'd like to know if there's a way to do it using subfunctions and separate function files for the windows.",,False,,t5_2r4xn,False,,,True,t3_woidc,http://www.reddit.com/r/matlab/comments/woidc/passing_data_between_gui_windows/,

**edit. I'm an idiot**

All you have to do is vectorize the input. so change for for loop to:

      test_input = buildingInputs(:,:);
      tic
      test_output = net(test_input);
      time = time + toc;


now the whole thing takes about 0.05 seconds.

This is the code I'm using:

My desired output is to have two overlayed gaussian curves. For extra points, I could use some help scaling the two gaussians so that they have different peak heights, but I was going to work on that next.

 Ideally I would be scaling this code up to include several hundred gaussian peaks instead of the two shown here (however I need to understand two data sets before I write a code for hundreds).

Any help is much appreciated.

**EDIT:** For future viewers, I will include below the code that I ended with. I also have included a way to include different peak heights. As an FYI, this program is being used to fit theoretical spectroscopic data.

    % a = mean
    % x = range (graph)
    % s = sigma
    % y = gaussian output
    % b  = peak intensity

Hi all, 

I have a matrix, let us say 

    A = [0 0 1; 0 1 1; 0 1 0].

Now I have two co-ordinates, let us say, 

    coordinateVector = [1 2; 3 4]; 

And finally, a 'new number' vector, let us say:

    newNumbersVector = [99 45];

The intent is that the first row of coordinateVector is a coordinate (1,2), and second row of coordinateVector is coordinate (3,4), etc. (It terms of row, colums).

So, I want to basically access element A(1,2) and make it say, 99. I also want to access element A(3,4), and make it equal to 45, etc. But how do I do this without a loop?? Right now I have:

    for ii = 1:size(coordinateVector,1)
    
        A(coordinates(ii,1),coordinates(ii,2) = newNumbersVector(ii);
    
    end

Surely there is a better way to do this without resorting to loops! 

Thanks!

I'm trying to take an image, that is in this case 204px x 204px, and turn it into 150 x 150, then create a histogram using the following code:

           I = imread('img/pic1.jpg');
           I2 = I(1:150,1:150);

Whenever I run this code in the immediate window of matlab, it shows I2 as a 150x150 unit8, but when I create a file and try to run that file, the workspace shows I2 is a single value. Why does this do what I want in the immediate window, but not in a script?

**Edit:** I dun goofed, y'all. My script is as follows:

    I = imread('/img/pic1.jpg');
    I1 = I(1:150,1:150);
    subplot(3,4,1);
    I1 = imshow(I1);
    subplot(3,4,2)
    H1 = imhist(I1);

I just realized the immediate window is giving me the last value of I1 which would be the 4th line...so I edited out the 'I1 =' but this did not fix the problem I ultimately set out to solve.

The last line is my attempt to create a histogram of the image, however nothing shows up on the histogram. There are no lines showing the different values that I would expect if I had simply done:

    I = imread(...);
    imhist(I)

So I guess I am going a little off the original track here, but on the off chance someone knows what's going on, any help would be appreciated.

**Edit 2:** You guys are so good, you don't even need to reply to help me. Apparently H1 = imhist(I1) doesn't like to work, but dropping the 'H1 =' part does. So everything looks excellent now, thanks everyone!

When I say listen to the frequencies, I'm just creating a wave function(cosine) that has a frequency of my specification. I make two of these wave functions and add them up, and play them using wavplay. All I want is to be able to play these two frequencies and tweak one of these frequencies using the slider in order to get it to equal the other frequency.

If so, please downvote away. I actually came to see if there was a Matlab sub-reddit as this recurrent ""trick"" seemed to work consistently in very different contexts.

I use Matlab to estimate rather tricky parametric models that Stata doesn't package -- and heck, Stata has everything but the girl, but it happens. In particular, I get to deal with nested models with 20+ distributions and some corner restrictions (such as nonnegativity) that create discontinuities or kinks.

To the point: I first optimize a version of the target function without explicit parallellization (i.e. no parfors and such) with the standard genetic algorithm with UseParallel = always, Vectorize = off, and then use the results as a starting point for a MultiStart problem with fminunc (I embed corner conditions in code, as I said before) parallelism off, but using a suitably parallelized version of the target function.

My Matlab machine is a laptop (work reasons; sometimes I have to take PowerPoint files to clients) with one of those recent Core i5 that supposedly have four cores, or at least fool you into thinking you have them; Matlab's parallel configuration dialog succesfully lets me open three pools, so I'm guessing it's the former. I use two pools when I'm using the machine for something else, or three when I have my Macbook at hand and can leave the Matlab machine running to its own devices.

In any case, this is fast enough to allow for incremental development, tweaking of functional forms (for instance, econometric problems that specify the scale and shape of a Weibull in terms of data), whereas I'd be frustrated with fmincon and have fminsearch running from friday night to sunday morning only to find out I had a bug in the code.

Again, this is my anecdotal lucky spell/rabbit's foot, and possibly quite obvious to anyone who didn't drop out of graduate school after a year and a half, so bring on the downvotes to keep it out of the subreddit's frontpage if that's the case.

1313466300.0,4,self.matlab,jk3l1,I've tried doing this myself and I just cannot get it.  Implicit equations with multivariate normal distribution,5,1,3,http://www.reddit.com/r/matlab/comments/jk3l1/ive_tried_doing_this_myself_and_i_just_cannot_get/,"Hello there, thank you for any time spent helping me, I've been trying for days to get this.

I have the variables x11, x12, x21, and x22.  Givens y, a, b1, b2, g1, g2 and a function f determine the mu and Sigma of the bivariate normal distribution, although mu also depends on x11 and x12.  So essentially, Sigma is a given, and mu is determined by:  
    mu = mu1 + sigma12*inv(sigma22)*[x21-y;x22-y];  
mu is dependent on x21 and x22

Now I have the expression:  
    E(theta | x21, x22) - Pr(x12 &lt; f(x11) | x21, x22)

E(theta) is just a random equation using the givens and two variables x21 and x22.  Pr() is the multivariate probability that x12 &lt; f(x11) based on the variables x21 and x22.  Function f is normally f = @(x)-x.

For simplicity's sake, lets call E() = x22 + x21.  I have the code for Pr() and will share it after the problem.

So now comes the tricky part: I need to implicitly solve for a function g such that  
    E(theta | x21, g(x21)) - Pr(x12 &lt; F(x11) | x21, g(x21)) = 0

In english, I need to find a function g such that when g(x21) is substituted for x22, E = Pr.

How would I go about solving for function g?

Code I have so far:

    y = 0;
    a = 1;
    b1 = 1;
    g1 = 1;
    b2 = 1;
    g2 = 1;

    Matrix_part1 = [y y y y]';

    Matrix_part2 = [1/a+1/b1+1/g1 1/a 1/a+1/b1 1/a;
    1/a 1/a+1/b2+1/g2 1/a 1/a+1/b2;
    1/a+1/b1 1/a 1/a+1/b1+1/g1 1/a;
    1/a 1/a+1/b2 1/a 1/a+1/b2+1/g2];

    mu1 = [y;y];
    mu2 = [y;y];
    sigma11 = Matrix_part2(1:2,1:2);
    sigma12 = Matrix_part2(3:4,1:2);
    sigma21 = Matrix_part2(1:2,3:4);
    sigma22 = Matrix_part2(3:4,3:4);

    mu = mu1 + sigma12*inv(sigma22)*[x21-y;x22-y];

    Sigma = sigma11 - sigma12*inv(sigma22)*sigma21;

Code for multivariate distribution:

    A = -10;
    B = 10;
    C = -10;
    D = fun; % fun = @(x)-x

    bind1 = @(x11,x12)problem_three_multivarnorm(x11,x12,mu,Sigma);
    pr_x12_x11 = quad2d(bind1,A,B,C,D)

    % This returns the bivariate normal distribution for x21 and x22 based on
    % mu and Sigma
    function [z]=problem_three_multivarnorm(x11,x12,mu,Sigma)

    [m,n] = size(x11);
    x11_vec = reshape(x11,m*n,1);
    x12_vec = reshape(x12,m*n,1);
    z_vec = mvnpdf([x11_vec x12_vec],mu',Sigma);

I am trying to simply filter out as much of the sine wave as I can, pulling out just the offset. While I thought this would be easy, no matter what I try I always end up with a non-negligible sine wave at 100MHz.

So, I'm not sure what I'm doing wrong. I've tried increasing my order, changing my input Fs, etc, but haven't had any luck.

I imagine I should have my sampling frequency at least double the frequency of 100MHz (Fs&gt;200MHz), but haven't had any luck with that.

I know my way around Matlab and Simulink rather well but I'll admit I'm completely clueless when it comes to the Image Processing power of Matlab. I focus mainly in controls. I know Matlab has some ungodly powerful image processing stuff I just have no clue how to use it.

I have an [Epson 2480 Limited Edition](http://www.epson.com/cgi-bin/Store/consumer/consDetail.jsp?BV_UseBVCookie=yes&amp;oid=48302407&amp;category=Products&amp;infoType=Overview) scanner with document feeder. It makes scanning photos easy... maybe too easy. I've cranked through around 1000 photos in the last few days. 

Problem 1 is they're in all sorts of orientations. My first thought was to use Matlab to recognize faces and then rotate them based on that. I'm not sure if facial recognition works that way if not I was going to resize (I scanned at 1200 dpi, a lot of photos are quite big) rotate through all possible orientations and see which one has the most faces and pick that as the winner. For example this photo: http://i.imgur.com/pextSdzh.jpg

I was playing around with [Mechanical Turk](https://www.mturk.com/mturk/welcome) and for $0.01 an image I can get someone on the internet select the appropriate rotation. So I'm considering doing that. [I tested it with 2 photos so far and the results were pretty cool](http://i.imgur.com/kQA8UgW.png). Parsing the CSV and having matlab rotate the images shouldn't be too difficult. So I'll probably do that for the ones that Matlab can't figure out. 

Second problem is that I use [VueScan](http://www.hamrick.com/) instead of the Epson Scan utility because it works under Windows 7. (And if I ever want to scan in Linux or Mac OS X the license is cross platform). It doesn't autocrop from the photo because the background is dark. I have a few photos of 'nothing' because the sheet scanner will occasionally draw a blank. http://i.imgur.com/fs9r9lih.jpg 

However the holes in the treads is never in the exact same spot (because otherwise I'd just parse that out). And the photos are in all sorts of orientations, sizes, formats, and the document feeder never puts the photo in the same spot twice so I can't just autocrop the same dimensions. A few of the photos also have dark backgrounds and I don't want it to accidentally crop it.

Third a final issue: Some of the photos are duplicates. Everyone that grewup with cameras knows you always got duplicates, one for you and one for the other part of the family. Sometimes those duplicates didn't get sent away but ended up in another box etc. Is there a way to 'classify' a photo based on... levels, etc? Something where I could process all the photos and then do a least squares between them to determine which photos are most likely to be the same. 

I've uploaded several photos to this album: http://imgur.com/a/N6E8J.

Essentially I am taking data from a data structure I made and creating a cleaner and simpler structure (to keep the previous one relatively unaltered, for record purposes). Essentially I am taking data from a structure (of raw data) and putting it into a ""nice"" structure that is sorted and has more intuitive headers. It would make the data work with for more people.

For each parameter (temperature, salinity) there is a site name, date, time, and month. In the excel file there is a column with the site name and month (someone made it) so I change the string to double and separated the sites using the numbered name. For example: sitename.parameter....(GSO.temp) and the temperature will be a cell, each cell for a month (if you have 9 months you have 9 cells)

So now I am at the point where I use forloops to create the structure and cells so that you can take any size data (even if it is missing a month or certain cours) to do this. So far I have nested for loops for every parameter (temperature, salinity) but me no like! My final goal is to make it into a function for making many plots and you can specify what parameter you want to work with, but I might do a separate function for that. How can I improve my code?

I only show temperature because I would do the same for the other parameters hehe

    % Make a normal probability distribution function.

    x = 1:.1:15;
    area = 500;

    figure(1);
    plot(x,1/3*x.^2.*sqrt(((area-x.^2)/(2*x)).^2-(x.^2/4)));
    grid on
    xlabel('Side Width (ft)'); %X axis label
    ylabel('Volume (ft^3)'); %Y axis label


When I plot this I get a graph that looks like this
[1-15](http://i.imgur.com/RyuJKlA.jpg)

Well it's not right.  To top it off, for a variety of different ranges of x, I get different shapes and different maximums.  Here are a few examples

[1-22](http://i.imgur.com/maZbloV.jpg)

[10-20](http://i.imgur.com/jemFjOm.jpg)

[10-22](http://i.imgur.com/DVuGZWW.jpg)

When I use ezplot, though, I get the right answer (the answer which shows up on wolfram and my TI-89)

Using this code:

    ezplot('1/3*x^2*sqrt(((500-x^2)/(2*x))^2-(x^2/4))', [1,15]);
    grid on
    xlabel('Side Width (ft)'); %X axis label
    ylabel('Volume (ft^3)'); %Y axis label

Then it looks exactly as it should:

What am I not understanding about the values of x and the plot() function??

I noticed that the problem has something to do with this line.. x = 1:.1:15;
If I change it to x = 1:1:15; it seems to plot correctly..",,False,,t5_2r4xn,False,,,True,t3_1b6tta,http://www.reddit.com/r/matlab/comments/1b6tta/any_idea_why_this_is_happening_plotting_functions/,

I want to create a function that will 'recognize' if a robot travels over the same point (or close to it) &gt;a times within the last b iterations.

To do this, I plan on recording the [x,y] of the robot at timestep t, and somehow list the positions in a continuously refreshing vector, preferably called PLACEMENT.
i.e., this would look something like

    PLACEMENT = [ [x_t, y_t]; [x_t-1,y_t-1]; ...]

It would store 200 or so of the most recent coordinates and overwrite them as the time-steps increased. 

The next step would be to run a 'check' of the robot's location. this would be creating a matrix of coordinates x,y that are up to +/- 5 from the robot's location.  Hopefully I can show a concise example as follows:

     RobotPosition   =  [x,y]
     PositionMatrix1 =  [ [x-5,y+5], [x-4, y+5],  ...,[x+5,y+5];
                          [x-5,y+4], ...,             [x+5,y+4];

                          [x-5,y-5], ...,             [x+5,y-5] ]
I would run this matrix of vectors for the current position and compare the 36 points to the last 200 positions of the robot, not regarding the most recent positions when the robot first reached its current coordinates.
  
If the matrix contains a coordinate that occurs more than 'a' times in the PLACEMENT vector, I know that my robot is looping in its path.
  
  

Hopefully my goals make sense. The question is this - how do I create a matrix of vectors? a vector of vectors? a vector of matrices (incase I want to store multiple PositionMatrix)?

I have read the image in and have a massive array that is larger than my command window. We've had less than 3 hours of tutorials on matlab and I don't even know where to start :/

You have been provided with a bitmap image (chromium.bmp) of an energy dispersive x-ray spectroscopy map of a cross-section of a material that has been exposed to an oxidising environment. Light areas of the map represent high x-ray counts which have the characteristic energy of chromium. The file can be read into MATLAB to provide you with an array of dimensions 470 by 628 by 3.
470 and 628 are the pixel dimensions of the image, while the third dimension corresponds to the red, green and blue brightness components of each pixel. In our image, these three numbers are identical (since the image is grey), so you only need to use one of these for subsequent work. Note: the numbers in this array are of the type uint8 (uint8 refers to a one-byte number i.e. an integer from 0 - 255). If you want to use the surf function to visualise the data, you will have to convert these numbers into a different type which allows non-integer values.
Read the image file into Matlab. Split the array into quarters along the longer (628) axis. For the first quarter, generate a one-dimensional array containing the sum of the brightness of all the pixels in the now quartered dimension, computed at each position in the shorter (470) dimension. This array should have 470 elements. Repeat this for the other three quarters. Plot these four vector arrays as lines on the same graph using different colours. Include on your graph a title, axis information and a legend.
1 pixel = 0.0426 X 0.0426 μm
You may find the following MATLAB functions useful. Use the help resources outlined in section 6 of the class work sheet to learn more about these functions.

Hi all. I'm currently working with a program that codes for what amounts to marbles in a box. The structure below is the code that tests for overlap between the marbles. 

The key part of this structure is the ""CenterPositions"" value, which is a N by 3 matrix. The idea is that this program goes row by row comparing values. However, the problem I'm having is that when two marbles overlap (ie the distance between is less than radius r, or 2r since the two marbles each have the same radius), I need it to terminate the entire function and while loops. So far I've experimented with flags and if statements, but I haven't been able to find a method that does what I want it to. Can anyone provide some insight, or a command that ends the while loop and stops iterating for later values?

First-time poster here, looking for some direction!

I am working on a project where I will be using MATLAB to develop an ""event detector"" that characterizes incoming mating calls of a species of tree nymph. Essentially, the male specimen will emit a mating call, and my system has to take in that signal, place it in the frequency domain, and then raise a flag that shows a mating call took place (the flag will trip when an incoming 500Hz pulse is immediately followed by an 800Hz whine that is sustained for a certain amount of time). Once this occurs, our system will respond with a ""virtual"" female response. 

I was hoping that the r/matlab community could point me to some useful literature on how to implement this in MATLAB. The main difficulty that seems to be present is taking in the signal in real-time, because our virtual female response has to be emitted within a mere 0.25s (maximum) after the male releases his mating call.

I am creating a GUI that allows the user to edit certain parameters by typing in numbers into text boxes.  A push button then allows you to apply these values to the variables in the program, or, assign particular variables with the new values.  Also, I'd like these variable to be saved in the workspace if possible.  In the code below, I'd like to enter a number into the Ch0_cal edit box, then assign that value to the variable Ch0cal.  The code looks like this:

    function LIDAR_GUI
    
    % Keep handles available, store handle for fig in structure h.fig
    % Create and hide GUI while it is being constructed
    h.fig = figure('visible','off','position',[200 100 800 600],'resize','off')
    
    % GUI title
    h.GUItitle = uicontrol('style','text','string','Curvature Analysis',...
    'fontsize',16,'position',[0 570 200 30])

    % Set parameters
    h.setparams = uicontrol('style','pushbutton','position',[75 150 100 40],...
                                                  'string','Set parameters',...
                                              'Callback',{@setparams_callback})

    % Make GUI visible
    set(h.fig,'visible','on','numbertitle','off','name','Curvature Analysis');
    
        function setparams_callback(src,eventdata)
        handles = guidata(ancestor(src,'figure'));
        Ch0_cal = h.Ch0_cal;
        Ch0cal = str2double(get(Ch0_cal,'string'))
        end

    end

The GUI appears, I type a number into the Ch0_cal edit box, e.g. 7, press the 'Set Parameters' push button, and in the command window I get

    Ch0cal =
    
       1

Any help to get this working?  Let me know if you need more clarification on this.  Thank you for your help.

The callback function should be structured as follows.

        Ch0_cal = h.Ch0_cal;

I'm trying to write a MatLab program that runs the [chaos game](http://mathworld.wolfram.com/ChaosGame.html) for arbitrary n and r values.  I want to use this program to study fractals generated through chaotic processes.

My code will produce the Sierpinski triangle when n=3 r=1/2, but it will not produce any other fractals from the above site.  Can you look at my code and help find where I went wrong?

The first 3 inputs are scalar with the last one being an Nx3 matrix such that the rows correspond to the particles and the columns correspond to the x, y, and z coordinates of each particle. 

The

    isnan(Fz)

stuff deals with when the program calculates the force of a particle on itself and divides by zero.  I figured it would be best to just run the large matrix calculation and pick out the points at the end.

The issue I'm having is that I want to avoid loops but still be able to perform calculations based on the position of each particle, relative to all other particles. (I have not tried implementing a cutoff point for the force, *Lennard-Jones 12-6*, of 2.5 or 3 * Sig, but am going to try it out in a bit to see if it helps).

As you can see, I just broke the dimensions apart and did meshgrids for the particles so that I have 3 NxN matrices, one for each dimension.  

Would additional vectorization improve the speed of this?  I mean have one large NxNx3 matrix and do the calculations on it, instead.

It's important to note that I'm simulating **UP TO 10 PARTICLES ONLY**, so utilizing the parallel toolbox may not be worth it (if it is, I have 6 cores at 4GHz each to play with :) ). 

**TLDR:**  N particles (&lt;10) in 3 dimensions, need forces on each particle exerted by all other particles (*Lennard-Jones 12-6*).  I have it in 3 chunks, one for each dimension.  Is there a way I can make this faster?

Thanks guys!


**EDIT:**  I have changed a few things and it has improved the speed noticeably.  The speed wasn't really ever a serious issue; I just wanted to know if there was a more efficient way to do the calculations.  


**EDIT:**  Thanks for all the help guys!!  Ive managed to increase its speed by about 150%.  I used the profiler (which is pretty sweet) and optimized a few more of the pieces.  
The 

    bsxfun()

calculations.

I suspect a little bit of the confusion is that the book I have in front of me was released a couple of years ago and I'm sure Mathworks might have tinkered with minor syntax things since then...but I digress. I'm not quite sure how to explain what my question is so I describe what I'm doing below. I think my confusion is basically about how Matlab deals with you asking it to just plot, say, f(x) = x^2 on some interval, since as far as I can tell the ""standard"" way is to define two arrays, say v and t, and then plot(v,t). (I'm also used to using Mathematica if that helps you figure out why I'm confused.) If someone can explain what's going on here, and possibly figure out what my mental hangup seems to be, I'd greatly appreciate it:


Say I want to plot x^2 - 1 on x = 0 to x = 1. As far as I could figure out you should use this command:
plot(x^2 - 1, [0,1])

However, I got this error:
??? Undefined function or variable 'x'.

So after trying a few things I finally settled on this as a way to get it to plot:
fplot(@(x) x^2,[0,1]) (note: I think this might be one of those things that has gone through a syntax change since my book was written, it didn't have parentheses around the x in the @(x) statement)

This results in a plot that looks right, but then when I try to plot the thing I need to find roots for using the bisection method for my homework (he wants us to plot it first to pick a bracket), I get something that doesn't look quit like what Wolfram Alpha plots out for me. For the record, I need to find roots for
f(x) = 1.74^(-x^3) - (x^4 * cos(x^2 )) - 2.011

It seems like an easy start to figure out how to do it.

I am getting memory and ""maximum size for variable exceeded"" errors getting thrown.

We have a massive archive of large 2d images. We read these images in, check to see if pixels meet a particular threshold, and then store the resulting ""yes or no pixel"" image on a stack.

The ""ideal"" size of the resulting matrix would be 1850 x 3660 x 7666--quite large unless you use a small data type. We assumed that logical used a bit per pixel but it uses a freakin' whole byte!

Is there a way to get around this? The obvious answer is to put subsets of the larger image on a stack. However, I think it is very silly to use 8 bits to store true/false information.

I am using the 32bit student edition. This is not homework, per se, but a research project. We have already outsourced the heavy number crunching to java but we assumed matlab would have no problem with arrays/matrices. Would a sparse matrix be something to look into? Or does the problem lie in the data type itself?

For my final exam/project, I have to do various visualizations with a dataset of my choice. I found one involving food inspections of restaurants. After finally getting it to load (which took forever due to commas in heading titles that I didn't notice), I'm now stuck on step two.

One of the columns, entitled ""Results,"" lists for each restaurant (row) whether they passed or failed the inspection. I want to make a new matrix/dataset (either is fine, I know how to turn a dataset into a matrix) containing only the restaurants that failed. This is what I tried to do (I loaded the file into a variable cleverly called ""data""):

fails = data.Results('Fail');

where 'Fail' is what is written in the cell. This did not work, so I also tried:

fails = data(data.Results == 'Fail', :);

and this didn't work either. However, if I type:

results = data.Results

it does correctly pull out and print the column of results.


I am assuming the problem lies in the fact that I'm trying to reference a string incorrectly. As I understand it, strings are a pain to work with in Matlab. If I could just do this in Excel, that would be great, but alas this is a programming class.

Anyways, here is my issue.  I have a 2D quantity, let's call it f(x1,x2).  Through an iterative procedure, I sometimes get values of this f which are pure noise.  Such that, `f(i,j)` might be O(10^2) while all of its surrounding neighbors are O(10^-3).  In this case, if I pass it through a smoothing filter that uses moving window averages, like say Savitzky-Golay ([`sgolay`](http://www.mathworks.com/help/signal/ref/sgolay.html)), then this noise will make its way into the 'smoothed' function.  I'm no expert in signal-analysis, so my question is the following:

Are there any tried and tested (i.e. established) filters out there that would recognize this noise for what it is, and just throw it out?  I can conceive of a complicated for loop which would catch these issues, checking `f(i,j)` against `f(i+1,j)`, `f(i-1,j)`, `f(i,j+1)`, and `f(i,j-1)`, but I'd be shocked if there wasn't something more elegant out there.

Problem 1: The Many Small Matrices Problem

Let's say we have a collection of matrices, A_N from N=1 to 5000 each of size roughly 500 by 500, and consider a set of vectores x_N from N = 1 to 5000. Let's say I want to compute A^{-1}_N x_N for each N. I could certainly loop from N=1 to 5000 and do the computation in the for loop, but to me this seems ""parallel"" in the sense that these are separate tasks each with no relation amongst each other. Could this be sped up with the parallel toolbox? Would a GPU be at all useful?

Problem 2: Dealing with Large Matrices 
This isn't actually a question on parallel issues, more of just a general question. I typically have memory issues when I want to deal with large matrices, of size N by N for N &gt; 10,000. At first, I thought maybe I should just get more RAM, but now I'm curious because I read about numerical analysts dealing with millions of points. and matrices of size N by N for N on the order of a million. What's the strategy for dealing with such large matrices? It seems to me that storing these in RAM is not reasonable. Are the numeric values stored in a .txt file on the HDD and read in line by line or something as needed?

I'd like to be able to nicely ""visualize"" this by drawing a sphere and using a color-map sort of idea. To be more precise, given a surface, one can use the surf command to draw the surface using point data to assign colors, and it draws a (usually) nice visual surface where the color can represent the value at the points.

To be more clear, I have three column vectors X,Y,Z each N by 1 vectors and a third vector C, also an N by 1 vector. Along a fixed row, the X,Y,Z, components represent the (x,y,z) coordinates of some point on the sphere, and the C represents the value of a function defined on the sphere at that point.  I would like to be able to, first plot the sphere (I can use plot3, but that is just a bunch of dots, and not so desirable), and also then color the sphere so it is a 'solid' looking sphere where the color corresponds to the value assigned at each point. 

I was hoping something simple like surf(x,y,z,c) would work, but it does not seem to accept a vector inputs for x,y,z. I assume it wants a meshgrid sort of matrix from the x,y,z data. 

Thanks!

EDIT: Solved. Thanks riboch for all of the help! I also found the trick was t use the convhull command along with trisruf or trimesh. See here:

This is one of my favorite designs, as it is composed of only straight lines, but looks as if a square corridor is rotating in the 3rd dimension.

I would like to generate an image like that in the link, but without any colors. Only black lines on a white background, so I can use it as a template to color in as I wish. I'd also like to be able to vary the ratio of sides for the triangles used (such as 5:12:13, 8:15:17, 7:24:25, or decimal sides, but special integer-sided right triangles would be sufficient). Varying the triangle dimension would change how the corridor appears to be rotating with depth.

To draw, the design begins with a small square. Then, each side of the square are extended like a pinwheel. These extensions act as the minor triangle leg, with the adjacent perpendicular square side acting as the major triangle leg. Then, connect the hypotenuse to complete 4 new triangles, and you've generated a slightly larger, rotated square. extended each side again, and repeat the process forever to infinity!

I'd like to write a script that could generate a drawing like this, as simply as possible with vertices and lines in full black against a plain white background. In this script, I'd like to specify right triangle side dimensions (major and minor leg lengths, or just ratio if its all built off a unit square) and I'd also like to specify iterations (so the drawing doesn't blow up to infinite 2-d space).

So let me know if you have any ideas, or if you think Matlab can generate such a specific and plain figure. Or if you think this task could be handled much better by some other software, let me know and I'll explore it. But if it can be done reasonably in Matlab, I'd prefer it, as I want to beef up my pet project portfolio for Matlab.

For instance, I made a trajectory simulator that includes air friction. I will have its path plotted using the scatter function, with each section of my C++ loop outputting the data to matlab to be plotted. In the background will be a line plot of the trajectory that the object traverses. 

Next to this plot I will have a bar graph plot that changes the heights of 4 different bars, each one representing Gravitational, Kinetic, Net, and Loss to friction energy. These bars move in unison with the scatter plot simulation.

I've also made one that simulates an object on a spring using the spring function. Does anyone else do this? 


I find that the simulation can begin to lag if you use to many different plots or you use certain functions (arrow3 for one lags a ton!), is the&lt;engine&gt; function to send data from C++ to matlab generally pretty slow? 

Is there a better way to create these physics simulations? I really enjoy using C++ to handle the UI, do the math, and run the loops, but I really really enjoy the ease with which simulations can be plotted in matlab.

What I want the for loops to do is count in a way that accounts for the matrix not being square.

This tells me the (i+1,j+1) position will get eliminated up until last position (3,5) where elimination will stop. 

So what I need is for the for loop to keep incrementing the j variable while keeping i constant in the columns between the first and last column.  Is the while loop the right way to do this?  If so, would anyone be able to give me an idea of what the while loop would look like to accomplish this?",,False,,t5_2r4xn,False,,,True,t3_145ut5,http://www.reddit.com/r/matlab/comments/145ut5/if_statement_for_gaussian_elimination_program/,

I guess the math around it isn't really important but it involves a function that has to be integrated but it contains a cross product between two three-dimensional vectors. As i understand it i can't  integrate the cross product and have to separate the function in three cases.

The function to be integrated is f(x)=(**t**x**r**)/r^3 from 0 to 2pi.
where **t**=(-sinx,cosx,0), **r**=(-cosx,-sinx,1) and r is the length of **r** = sqrt(2)

When i wrote it as three separate functions it worked fine.

    function B = funx(a)

But when i tried to mushing them altogether in a big cell array things got wierd and instead i got -9.4e-04 wich is way further from 0 when i used quad. For the y i got 1.7e-04 (should be 0) but i got 2.2214 for the z wich is correct!

The reason that inv(A)*b or A\b do not work is because the inverse matrix over modular is the Adjugate * Determinate^(-1). But over modular the inverse of the determinate is not equal to 1/determinate, which is what Matlab uses to compute the inverse. 


To work around this I wrote my own inverse modular function and then am doing the following to compute the correct solution to Ax=b(mod i):

&gt;determinate= det(A);
&gt;
&gt;inverse = invert(determinate,i); % Returns the inverse of parameter 1 mod parameter 2.
&gt;
&gt;InverseA = inv(A) * determinate; % To get the adjugate

&gt;InverseA = mod(InverseA, i);

I'm writing an orbital propagation code that uses an adaptive time step RK4 algorithm to solve a second-order differential equation. Basically, RK4 requires that you compute the accelerations at 3 different locations per step. So far, I've been using the following code:

    function a = accelcalc(xsat,v)
     Mea = 5.9742e24;  %Mass of the Earth, [kg]
     Msu = 1989100e24; %Mass of the Sun, [kg]

     wearth = 2*pi/365.25/24/3600; %Angular velocity of the Earth, [rad/s]
     xearth(1,:) = [149.60e6 0 0];   %[km]
     xmoon(1,:) = [149.6e6+0.3844e6 0 0];   

     r(1,:) = xsat(1,:)-xearth(1,:); %Distance from satellite to Earth
     r(2,:) = xsat(1,:); %Distance from satellite to Sun
     r(3,:) = xsat(1,:)-xmoon(1,:);  %Distance from satellite to Moon

     Gmag = -G*[Mea;Msu;Mmo]./sum(r.^2,2); %Magnitude of the gravitational acceleration
     Xhat(1,:) = r(1,:)./norm(r(1,:));
     Xhat(2,:) = r(2,:)./norm(r(2,:));
     Xhat(3,:) = r(3,:)./norm(r(3,:));

     GCemag = wearth^2*norm(r(2,:)); %Centrifugal accerlation magnitude
     GCe = GCemag*Xhat(2,:); %Centrifugal accleration
     Gc = -2*[-wearth*v(1,2) wearth*v(1,1) 0];   %Coriolis acceleration simplified
     g = [Gmag Gmag Gmag].*Xhat;   %Gravitational acceleration vector

     a = sum(g,1)+Gc+GCe;   %Resultant acceleration vector
    end

This function is called at every time step about 4 times, as per the RK4 algorithm, so any inefficiencies really REALLY slow the program down, as it's called hundreds of thousands of times. I ran the profiler to see where it was slowest and it seems to be slowing down around the lines where I normalize vectors and/or divide. I'm pretty sure I'm not coding as efficiently as I can.

Now, I've figured out how to create the population and run the tests but I can't figure out how to change the operands to be what I need.

If I first do `[vars,b]=gplab(20,4);` (20 generations, 4 population size) and then I type `vars.pop.tree` (variables.propulation.tree), since I'm using the default values I get:

    ans = 
    
            op: 'minus'

        nodeid: 1
         nodes: 29
         maxid: 29
    
    
    ans = 
    
            op: 'minus'
          kids: {[1x1 struct]  [1x1 struct]}

        nodeid: 1
         nodes: 64
         maxid: 64

I need to change those ""minus"" for the operands I need (""times"",""plus"",""power"",""sin"",""times"") but I just can't figure it out. Following the documentation I see that I should be able to do:
`params=setfunctions(params,’func1’,2,’func2’,1);` where `func`is the name of the operand and the following # is how many input arguments it needs but  I just can't make it change those defaults. 

Does anybody has any idea of how to do this?

**EDIT**

I managed to change the values doing `p=setfunctions(p,'plus',2,'times',2,'power',2,'sin',1,'times',2);` however when I run the program I get [this tree](http://i.stack.imgur.com/e2Rzx.png) instead of one representing what I need

""So,"" I said to myself, ""the charge on a sphere is a function of which sphere it is, which itself happens to be a function of x, y, and z.""

To get right to the point: I'd like to be able to make a plot of these spheres such that they can be visually seen in three dimensions, and each with a color that will represent the charge on the sphere relative to the charges on the other spheres. So, while looking at these spheres in 3-space, the redder spheres would have a very positive charge, while the bluer spheres would have a more negative charge.

As you can see, there are clearly two more-or-less sinusoidal functions on top of each other. What I'm trying to do is separate these two and create a matrix of x/y points to describe them.

I've written a simple script to create points from the mean of distinct areas of signal, producing this:

My question is, how best to disentangle these signals? I only need their qualitative shape, nothing precise. Worst case, I suppose I could use some kind of ""point picker"" to create some points, but ideally I'd like some way getting MATLAB to follow the sinusoids - at least roughly.

OK so I have a somewhat basic question on how to approach a problem:

I have a program that is processing data, and every time it does, it plots results on a figure. (The same figure). This goes on for like 4000 times in a loop. 

I need to present it, and it would be really cool if I could make it into an animation and/or movie. 

So my question is, how to do that? I have everything already set up just need to add code. I am open to:

* Make an animated gif from all the plots. (Every lolcat seems to be able to make one about how their cat jumped and did something 'cute', so I would like to use the same technique for something more productive ;-) )
* Make an mpeg from all the plots.

I can post-process everything btw, like if I saved everything as a jpg or something. I am using CENTOS, but would also like window solution if different.

1) solve for the roots of [equation 3](http://imgur.com/nHrbE) using fsolve with 33 different initial guesses (3:3:100) and then

2) Using those 33 different roots from part 1, solve for D in [equation1](http://imgur.com/nHrbE) using fsolve again and finally

3) Plug that value of D back into equation 3 and find the values of equation 1 at 41 given time points


Background: I have data in an excel file, there are two columns, the first column is the 41 time points and the second column are the corresponding values that I am trying to get my equation to match.

Questions: I have two problems with my code:

1) My fsolve equation for part 2 returns the initial guess, I know that fsolve is sensitive to initial values however I know this is the correct initial guess. I also know that the solution should be roughly an order of magnitude away

2) My model data (where I attempt to get values using the time points and my solved value of D) returns the same values regardless of which value of D I plug in

My code:

    %Problem 1-Solve for qn using fsolve

    for k=1:length(initval)

    [Dn]=fsolve(@D10P3,Do,options);

    %Problem 3- Plot experimental and model data and find R^2
    %Outer for loop is to calculate the model's value of Mt/Minf for each of the 41 time points
    %Inner for loop is to calculate qn for every inital guess (33 total) for a particular time point

Using the second option seems rather inefficent but the code looks very nice.

- Is there a more efficient way, mainly from a cpu load point-of-view, to access one property from multiple objects?

- Is there any reason to use a cell of objects instead of using a vector or matrix to begin with?

I created a model that does channel coding and it employs bpsk and channel repetition.

I have 3 variables that are inputs.  snr, rep, frame_size

Where snr is signal to noise ratio, rep is number of repetitions, and frame_size is, well, the frame_size.  This isn't really important but figured I would paint a picture...

I want to perform an analysis where I try to find the bit error rate (ber) while varrying the signal to noise ratio and repetitions--for each frame size.

From the command line, I set the snr, rep, and frame_size.  Let's say my model is called channel_coding, I then run sim('channel_coding').

Low and behold ber pops up because it is set to go to the workspace as a variable called ber in the model.

So, I want to write a little script that collects all of this data while varying the parameters I mentioned.  However, if I set the variable in the m-file, the model doesn't know and if I set the variable at the command line the m-file doesn't know but the model does.

I have tried making the variables snr, rep, and frame_size 'global'.  That didn't work.

I also tried using simset() and that didn't work.

So, my friends.  Would someone please share with me this secret that the bowels of the internet is hiding from me?

**EDIT:** So, I, thanks to some friends, found the answer and want to follow up.  In order to get/set vars for access between the function workspace (where my 'script' it) and the base workspace (what my model sees) I can use two methods:

* evalin('base','snr', `val`) or assignin('base','snr', `val`)

*OR* (seemingly better option)

* opt = simset('SrcWorkspace', 'current', 'DstWorkSpace', 'current'); sim('channel_coding',[],opt)

I am working on a project (no, it's not homework). To give you an overview, I am visualizing simulation data in Maya (3d graphics). I have written a few scripts in MEL (maya's scripting language) to basically read an ascii file of positions (xyz) and then animate an object along the resultant path. That script works fine for the previous goal of my project: I was given the files with the position data of the particle I was to visualize. 

However, I now face a new problem. All I have is massive files with a vector on each line, formatted as follows:

x y z   u v w 

Each file represents the field at a different time (over a fixed interval with fixed time increments). You see, I don't have a vector field function: I have actual data taken from a simulation describing each velocity vector in the field. I suppose you could consider the entire field to represent a fluid, and I want to animate the motion of ""beads"" dropped into the field (ignoring hydrodynamics, mass, etc -- going only off of the velocity data).

My problem is that I am a nonscientific programmer.. I have been working in Java and MEL and other languages; I have spent almost a week now trying to figure out a solution for this. All I want is to be able to specify some hypothetical initial position of a bead and write a file containing its position vectors as time passes. I can then use this output to animate what I want in Maya. It has been very hard to find guidance related to this given its specificity... I'm sure that my ignorance of Matlab doesn't help. Is there some existing function that will simplify this? Can anyone push me in the right direction? I am hungry for progress and this technicality is holding me back. I don't have a sense of entitlement to help, but I would appreciate any sort of guidance.

My C++ program takes the name of a grader as a string from the user (a little more complicated than that, but that's not relevant.  The point is, there are no grader names hardcoded in the c++ file).  The reason I don't want to hardcode is because of the trying to avoid recompiling part.

So, the C++ file calls an mcc-compiled library, and passes to the function the string with the name of the grader to call, as well as some other parameters to help execution (answers, grading mode, ID information, that sort of thing.  Again, the details aren't relevant).  This library then calls the actual m file grader, by using eval on the string that got passed in from the C++ file.

But, if one of those m files that gets called were to change, I would really like, as I mentioned, NOT to have to recompile.  However, in experimenting with this structure, I can't updates to the m files to stick unless I do recompile; both the library and the executable.  I would rather not, so I'm wondering if there is some way to essentially tell mcc, ""Don't lump the m-files that get called into the library.""

One problem I've come across is the incredible slowness when calculating the dynamic programming map to find the vertical path of minimal cost. Here's how I currently calculate it:

    function Mv = vertical_map(S)
        Mv = zeros(size(S));
        % first row is a special case
        Mv(1,:) = S(1,:);
        for r = 2:size(Mv,1)
            Mv(r,:) = S(r,:) + get_mins(Mv(r-1,:));

        end
        f(end) = min(r(end-1), r(end));
    end

([http://pastebin.com/m3e179a08](http://pastebin.com/m3e179a08) if you want syntax highlighting)

Here S is an energy map that tells you the penalty incurred when using S(r,c) in a path. The goal is to find a vertical path of minimal cost. To do this, Mv's first row is set to S's first row, and then the values are propagated downward by finding the min in the neighbours from the previous row. Once you have Mv, finding the optimal path is simply a matter of finding the minimum value in the last row and backtracking.

I would greatly appreciate it if you could recommend some improvements to make it faster, as this is a pretty bad bottleneck on large images.

Disclaimer: this is for homework, but speed does not count in our grade. The code already works - I'm only trying to figure out whether it could be improved speed-wise. There are completely different ways of going about finding the path of minimal cost such as generating N random paths and keeping the best one, but I'd rather stick with dynamic programming for now.


Edit: I vectorized get_mins and it is now much faster:

    function f = get_mins(r)
    % Filters r such that, at position i, it contains the minimum value in (i-1, i, i+1)
        f = min([[+Inf r(1:end-1)];r;[r(2:end) +Inf]]);

I'm working my way through the exercises, however my answer to finding an LU decomposition differs from that in my book. If someone could point out where I have gone wrong, I would appreciate it. Here is the question:

Use LU decomposition to find a solution to the system:

x + 7y - 9z = 12

2x - y + 4z = 16

x + y - 7z = 16


And here is what I have done in Matlab:

A = [1, 7, -9; 2, -1, 4; 1, 1, -7]; b = [12; 16; 16];
[L, U] = lu(A)

Matlab gives this as:

L = [0.5000, 1.0000, 0; 1.0000, 0, 0; 0.5000, 0.2000, 1.0000]

U = [2.0000, -1.0000, 4.0000; 0, 7.5000, -11.0000; 0, 0, -6.8000]

From this I proceed with:

x = U\(L\b)

x =

9.6078

-1.0196

-1.0588

However, the answer in my book shows that I should have:

x = 

9.4216

-0.8039

-0.9118

So im trying to write an automated tool that does runs a bunch of batch files. I'm having issues because of whitespaces in the folder path name.  Do you think you guys can provide some advice on how to fix my problem?

So basically, I'm calling a batch file in a directory, for instance: ""C:\Documents and Settings\user\desktop\cooldude.bat"". Now the thing is, for this particular program I need to run it with commandline arguments, so if i was in command prompt in the proper file directory I would do, ""cooldude.bat /n=cooldude /reallycooldude=1"".

Now in matlab if I did dos('C:\Documents and Settings\user\desktop\cooldude.bat') the program will work correctly (without any arguements) as soon as I put the arguments in, so the command is now: dos('C:\Documents and Settings\user\desktop\cooldude.bat /n=cooldude /y=reallycooldude=1') I get the error:

'C:\Documents' is not recognized as an internal or external command, 
operable program or batch file.

Is there any way to get the program to work but call it outside its directory?

However I came up with a question which hasn't seem to be answered anywhere else. I though I'd post my findings here for other people to use:
Code:


    disp(1)
    for i = 1:500000
        sin(1)
    end
    disp(2)


Run this and it will print 1 and 2 to the terminal almost instantly together.
Now change sin to sind theta like so:
Code:


    disp(1)
    for i = 1:500000
        sind(1)
    end
    disp(2)


When you run this code you will find that 1 is displayed to the console and ~2 seconds later 2 is printed to the console.

Thus we can see that sin is much much faster than sind.
The only pro I can think of for using sind is that it is more usual.

Hope this helps some of you guys speed up your programs!


~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Edit:
Following unreal5811's advice of using tic toc:

sin(1) takes 0.000006 seconds to complete

sind(1) takes 0.000501 seconds to complete

So we can see that sind() is roughly 100 times slower than sin()",,False,,t5_2r4xn,1374231030.0,,,True,t3_1img4u,http://www.reddit.com/r/matlab/comments/1img4u/sin_vs_sind/,

so I'm currently trying to make a script much more user friendly and versitile by dynamically naming variables from filenames. I'm currently using a lot of eval statements which I understand isn't the best way to go about this? maybe a bit slow and clunky?

I've managed to get a for loop that will load a number of user defined .xyz files, split it into variables named by the file and then build a structure for each dataset. I'd now like to pass each structure into a cell array to allow me to load that single array for plotting and further analysis etc. 
my problem is that every time the for statement iterates it overwrites the cell array with the last structure. any ideas what I'm doing wrong? I'm sure its something pretty simple but I've been staring at a screen for too long and my brain's gone to mush. my code's below.

    for i=1:length(f)
        %load xyz data into variables
        data=fullfile(p,f{i});
        data=dlmread(data,' ',0,0);
        % create variable name
        fname=[f{i}(1:2) f{i}(9:10)];
    
        % as structure (dynamically allocating names)
        eval(['scan' fname '.name=fname;']);
        eval(['scan' fname '.x=data(:,1);']);
        eval(['scan' fname '.y=data(:,2);']);
        eval(['scan' fname '.z=data(:,3);']);
        
      
        % run GridTriScat function on each dataset      
        eval(['scan' fname '=GridTriScat(scan' fname ');']);
    
        %run surfaceParam
        eval(['scan' fname '=surfaceParam(scan' fname ');']);

I am trying to fit or interpolate a set of some 3D data on a space of (x,y,z). The data that I have are 3000 unique points at randomly scattered locations within the x-y-z space, and I would like to interpolate this data onto an arbitrarily defined and evenly spaced x-y-z grid, or to obtain a function of (x,y,z) that can be used to solve for what the data would be at any point in the space - either way is sufficient.

Say for example, our space is 100 x 100 x 100 units in the 3 dimensions, and I would like to interpolate my randomly scattered data onto an x-y-z grid spaced out by 1 unit each (an array size of 101 x 101 x 101).

The problem I am having with using interp3(X,Y,Z,V,XI,YI,ZI) is that I can not construct a 3-D array (V) from the randomly scattered points of the data that I have. As far as I know, the 3-D data to be interpolated must match the size of the meshgrid inputs. However, because my data is only at randomly scattered locations, it is impossible for me to construct a regularly spaced grid of my data values for the array V. 

So it seems like interp3 is not possible for what I am trying to do, or is there a way to use interp3 to interpolate from a set of randomly scattered 3-D data? Are there any other functions available that can fit or interpolate a set of randomly scattered 3-D data?

I am a novice at Matlab and am struggling with what is apparently an easy procedure to write.

I currently have a reader that reads in ANSYS mesh files, and it works, but depending on the size of the file it can take a very long time. I was hoping I can optimize it for speed.

What I do first is read in a text file and change every line into a matrix of characters using the lines:

    cac = textscan( fid, '%[^\n]' );
    fclose(fid);
    A  = char( cac{1} );

where A is my character matrix. I then search through the text file for identifiers for data I need. How I accomplish this is by setting start of data indices and end of data indices. I basically read this line by line, and at the moment, I assume it will always be formatted in a certain way. Once I find a character vector that matches one of my predefined constants, I begin to count indices.

After I have these indices, I use sscanf functions to read the characters as %f or %x numbers and store them into matrices. This is the part where the profiler says it takes the longest to complete.

I posted the MATLAB reader function [here](http://pastebin.com/cbDwNRA8) since it is a bit long to post here. My specific questions are: do I have to convert the whole text import into a character matrix, and is there any way I can do this without needing a for loop? The loops using sscanf take a very long time.

It works, but just barely so. I can send a test import file if needed.",,False,,t5_2r4xn,False,,,True,t3_1ex6d6,http://www.reddit.com/r/matlab/comments/1ex6d6/hello_can_someone_help_me_with_some_text_inputting/,

So, take this array for example.  Centermost point is the highest point, 3.  I would like to make a 3D plot with single points/dots.  I have tried a few things with surf and meshgrid, but can't seem to get it to work.

surf(array) looks close, but instead of planes, I don't want any connections between the points. Just a point cloud (i.e. there will only be 25 points plotted).

The way I'm thinking about it is there's a flat x-y plane, but each point's coordinate is just... the x-y coordinate... and then we only have Z information, if that makes sense.  So, in the array above, the high point is x=3, y=3, z=3, for example.

Any suggestions?

Thank you.

The ace is red, and sometimes if I hit or stay its color will revert to normal or switch to a new color entirely (yellow, black, and grey seem to be favorites). The shoe, which is supposed to display a facedown card, is completely black.

I feel like this should be easy and I am missing something obvious. I am currently programming an experiment in Psychtoolbox and want to record the time stamps for the onset of each trial. I have a two-dimensional matrix that stores all the output which I later export as CSV. One column in that matrix should be 'timestamp'.

I was playing around with the 'now' command and even though I find that to be a strange way to represent time, I found it is precise to roughly 50 ms. That'd be enough for me. What I find weird, though, is that if I look at 'now' like this:

    &gt;&gt; now
    
    ans =
    
       7.3533e+05

It doesn't show me the decimals. The CSV file will have a column that contains 735330 every single time. How do I store the decimals? I know they are there because:

    &gt;&gt; disp(sprintf('now: %f', now))
    now: 735331.689352

But I want the whole thing. It's a little weird because all the functions just seem to give me rounded output.

xCoord and yCoord are originally created as basic arrays:

I'm working with some code to try to demonstrate the computation of the surface integral of a field for an introductory electromagnetism course (I'm employed by the course, not a student, so no worries about this being a homework assignment or anything.)  The way our code (included at the bottom of this post) looks now is basically a unit charge at the origin with a unit sphere with some offset divided into facets, taking the dot product of the field at each facet with a surface normal vector and then summing up the results.

The code works, in the sense that if the charge is inside the sphere the result is about 1 (with some error) and if the charge is outside the sphere the result is about 0, but there is one problem we can't quite work out.  When the charge is outside but near the sphere (such as an offset of 1.2), **there is a substantial error that is independent of the number of facets used**.

I checked the electrical signal on the wire and there's absolutely no change in the on the line for some reason. I even tried setting odd parity to force a high bit but no luck. There should be start and stop bits (I tried both 1 and 2 stop bits but no go) even otherwise, right?

The other and weirder problem is that any number I transmit between 0x80 and 0xA0 is received as 0x3F on the other side. Now the kicker is I tried transmitting all 8 bit data from the controller to Matlab and every single number, including 0, is received just fine.

What I have are 3 square images, stained in 3 different colors (fluorescent 2° antibodies to be specific): a Red image, Green image, Blue image of the same thing (biological sample). What the script does currently is combine the images into layers, on top of the one and other so I have ONE image of the three images and then it also stitches a panoramic image with all three adjacent to one and other (essentially same height but 3x the width of any of the single images). Now I want to incorporate a feature that I've used photoshop for: adjustment of color levels.
What I need help with: What I used to do prior is manually layer the three images in photoshop, find a good transparency and fill ratio between the layers that allowed presentation of all the data (image color) I saw fit, and then adjust the color levels by going under Layer &gt; New Adjustment Layer &gt; Levels... ** or also *Command + L** in CS6 for MAC. Then a window would pop up with a histogram like graph labeled **Input Levels** and sliders. Under the sliders are where I enter in values. When I enter the values, what exactly is happening to the image, as in the RGB values of the image particularly? I want to add this feature into my matlab code and manipulate the RGB values (or uint8 matricies) accordingly to the given three values I give photoshop. I am just curious at the algorithm (for a lack of better word) on how those three values adjust ""color levels"" of the image. Maybe an insight on what the histogram exactly means might help too.

Any help please? Thank you, sorry if I've mis-labled or incorrectly described something. Really would like any

**Example**: Here is the [original image](http://imgur.com/z6fzF) and here is the photoshop [manipulated image](http://imgur.com/DTKgW). All I did was open the original in CS6 mac version, Command + L, then entered in values: 8, .6, 50 and the result is the manipulated image before you. I want to be able to produce similar results in matlab using my function above. Any guidance/ direction?

EDIT: http://pastebin.com/jqa6FC2Z

Problem: Drug solubility using the Scatchard-Hildebrand equation: 
The solubility of a solid solute in a liquid solvent at atmospheric pressure can be estimated from:  
x=(1/y2)exp(((Hm)/R)((1/Tm)-(1/T))
where  x = solubility of the solute, unitless 
y2 = activity coefficient of the solute, unitless 
Hm= heat of fusion of the solute, cal/mol 
 R = universal gas constant = 1.987 cal/(mol·K) 
  Tm = melting point of solute, K 
 T = temperature, K
For non-polar solutes and solvents, the Scatchard-Hildebrand equation allows estimation for the solute activity coefficient from the pure component properties of the solute and the solvent:  
  
ln y2= (vl2(z1-z2)^2φ1^2)/RT
where      φ1=  (1-x)vl1/((1-x)vl1+xvl2)= volume fraction of the solvent 
and  z1 = solubility parameter of the solvent, (cal/cm^3)1/2
z2 = solubility parameter of the solute, (cal/cm^3)1/2
  VL1 = molar volume of the solvent, cm^3/mol 
  VL2 = molar volume of the solute, cm^3/mol 2
The following data may be needed to solve the problem: 
Hm = 4300 cal/mol 
 Density of drug = 1.04 g/cm^3
Solubility parameter of drug = 7.6 (cal/cm^3)1/2
 Solubility parameter of benzene = 9.2 (cal/cm^3)1/2
 Molar volume of benzene = 89.4 cm^3/mol 
   
As initial guess values for x, use values of 0.110 to 0.115. 
Write a Matlab program(s), with accompanying flowchart diagram, to find the solubility of a drug (molecular weight = 230 g/mol, Tm = 428 K) in benzene over a temperature range of 290 K to 330 K.  Use MATLAB to plot your results for the solubility as a function of temperature in a MATLAB graph.  Turn in a printout of your plot as part of your hardcopy submission.

What I have done, thus far, is converted the data to polar coordinates and stratified it into 0.01 radian intervals and, for each subject, have taken the maximum value of each interval. Due to using such small intervals, there are several intervals that have no data. Additionally, the curve is not as smooth as I'd like it since their was some variation across trials and what-not.  Therefore, my resulting curves, which should be fairly smooth parabolic curves have points that jump around and some intervals of 0. 

  So, my next step is smoothing the curves. My question is this.. I have thought of a couple ways of handling it, and need to know which should produce the best results. 

   A) I could smooth the coordinates in polar form. When the radius is plotted on a cartesian plane, it forms a fairly straight line, which could be smoothed.

  B) I could convert the coordinates to cartesian and smooth the y values. Therefore smooth a parabola vs a straight-ish line.

Is one of these methods better than the other? Also, is there a method (rloess,loess, sgolay, etc.) that handles the dips to 0 better?

I am trying to create a set of isosurfaces defined by shape functions (kind of like CAD curves). My code for such is [here](http://pastebin.com/80ZBXC4u).

What I can do is take a shape function for a sphere, for instance, and plot it as a isosurface pretty easily. When I try one of the equations for my example, however, it doesn't work. I am thinking it could possibly be a result of me not translating it right into MATLAB.

The line:

    % our_function = @(x,y,z) (sqrt(x.^2+y.^2+z.^2)&lt;10); % Example

is the sample code for the sphere. I then have the example:

    % our_function = @(x,y,z) (z.*15*15*15+2*(x.^2+2.25*y.^2)*(x.^2+2.25*y.^2)&lt;0); % Shape Function 1 Simplified

which is a bit more convoluted, however, I managed to model it somewhat easily.

I then have the more advanced line, which I haven't even started yet:

    % our_function = @(x,y,z) (z.*15*15*15+2*(x.^2+2.25*y.^2)*(x.^2+2.25*y.^2)&lt;0)&amp;&amp;(x.^2&gt;0.01*15*15)&amp;&amp;(z&gt;-2.3*15)
    %                                                                             % Shape Function 1
    %                                                                             % Extended

which is the last equation plus some constraints for x,y and z. I can model everything except for the constraints. How would you apply those constraints and limit what values can be applied into the meshgrid?

What this should plot is a 2D surface in 3 dimensions, meaning its a sheet of sorts. However, I cannot MATLAB well, so somewhere along the line I think I am inputting this wrong.

i'm trying to write a matlab function that creates random, smooth trajectories in a square of finite side length. I've uploaded my current attempt at such a procedure here: [Pastebin](http://pastebin.com/jwRnAbp2).

My original plan was to place particles within a square, and move them around by allowing their acceleration in the x and y direction to be governed by a uniformly distributed random variable. To keep the particles within the square, I tried to create a repulsive force that would push the particles away from the boundaries of the square.

In practice, the particles tend to leave the desired ""feasible"" region after a relatively small number of time steps (say, 1000).""

    a_unique = 0.32   b_store = 0.82      0  % Maybe fill in zeros
               1.02             1.35   0.98  % where no other values
               1.74             1.99      0  % need to be stored?
               2.56             1.56   2.01

Finally, I want to average each row in b_store to return to an array

    a_unique = 0.32   b_store = 0.82
               1.02             1.17
               1.74             1.99
               2.56             1.79

Any suggestions on how I should go about reaching my overall goal here?  I'm open to learning a different approach to this.  Let me know if something is unclear.  Thanks for the help!

So I need to do this experiment where I need to present a sound for 175 s, and while the sound is playing, at certain points, I need to 7 flash Gabor patches each repeated 10 times that change in orientation according to the sound.

I need to filter parts of this sound with different band-stop frequencies for 150 ms each and one particular Gabor patch is paired with a certain frequency band. 

The sound will be created out of our bank of natural sounds to generate an artificial sound that has a lot of frequencies represented in it, but would still be sort of pseudo-natural.

Are there any linear time-varying filters that one could use? and if yes, how do I do it?

    % generate -&gt; original(1,:) = [1 1 3 3];
    %                  original(2,:) = [1 1 1 3];

I wrote the code below with for loops, but I think there must be a ""easier"" way of doing it.
    
    orig = [];
    origrow = [];
    
    for i = 1:length(education)
        for j = 1:length(education(i,:))
            if education(i,j) ~= 0
                for k = 1:education(i,j)
                    origrow = [origrow Lvalues(j)];
                end
            end
            orig = [orig origrow];
            origrow = [];
        end
    end
    
    orig = reshape(orig,N,length(education))';

2.) I need to calculate mean, standard deviation, and that's easy. I Have 3 groups, let's say age groups (18 to 24, 25 to 30, 31 to 40), and data in the form of ""education"" for each group. I need to calculate p-values and Chronbach's alpha coefficient for each questin. How to do that?

I will be collecting movement data using an Optotrak Certus motion tracking device. As well as breathing data from a pnuemotachometer.

I need to write every Nth cell (15th and 30th actually) to an excel document. The matrix consists of a single column, with a variable ammount of cells (so it is an x*1 array). 

For instance, let say matrix is 5000*1. How would I go about writing every 15 cell  (from 0 to 5000), and no other cells, to an excel document? 

I have very little experience in matlab, and have tried to google my problem but to no luck. I have asked questions about matlab here before and gotten great replies so I hope that someone can help me out. If needed I can post an example of my data or code or something, I just dont have that on my home computer.

It works great except for one small problem, I can only manage to get one population to respond to an event on any one simulation. For example, if I were to model two populations and wanted to end it once one hit 50 I can only test either the first or the second.

I have several images to loop over, and each will return an unknown number of features, which I will then want to lump together for further processing.

I first had a simple accumulation variable:

    data0 = [];
    
    for i=1:x
        data0 = [data0 newdata];
    end

but matlab complains about this, and rightly so.

I can make the warning disappear by doing the following

    data0 = cell( 1, x )
    
    for i = 1:x
        data0{i} = newdata;
    end
    
    data0 = [data0{:}];

Not knowing much about cells - does this prevent data0 being rewritten in its entirety on each loop (and only rewritten once at the end), or is it just as bad as the first solution, but matlab just can't tell?

Here's what is said - ""Create a program finding every number x5xy (where x and y are between 0 and 9), which can be divided by 3."" So far i made a big (for me) step, but i still can't get it to work. At this moment the code starts adds 500 to every previous number, until it gets to 50 000. What the hell am I doing wrong?

    s=1000;
    s2=500;
    s3=10;
    s4=1;
    all=0;
    for x=0:9

Here is the assignment. 

Perform the following:
Draw both pieces of the arm.
Rotate entire object about first axis 20 degrees
Redraw
Rotate second part about second axis -30 degrees 
Redraw
Rotate entire object about first axis -10 degrees
Redraw
Rotate second part about second axis 40 degrees
Redraw

The first axis would be the lower left vertices of the yellow rectangle the second axis is the lower right vertices of the same rectangle. 

This is the code I've currently completed.

My current problem is that once I've done the first rotation, it's rotated about the origin rather than the first axis. Even if I were to complete this I would not know how to rotate the second part (red rectangle) by itself about the specified axis.
