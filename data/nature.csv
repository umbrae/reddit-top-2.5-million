so I love bugs, reptiles, and fish, but several interesting things occurred to me when I made this video:

I'm not sure I've ever seen a bug this size use it's neck to move it's head around to this extant

and

the movement seems robotic, but if you pay attention, he only uses one joint at a time; like move the elbow, then the wrist, then the fingers etc.

I realize most might think this is trivial info, but it was very exciting to me..

favorite part:  he cleans his head the same way a cat or hamster clean.
