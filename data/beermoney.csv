You know those guys who sell tapes and books along the lines of “I’ve made my self rich now let me sell you my book telling you how”

This sub is full of those guys. They want to 

A.

Dive traffic to their sites to “show you how” or 

B. 

Want you to sign up to work under them so they can make cash off of your time. 


You CAN make money here just be aware and think about it. 


90% of the people on this sub are the ones looking to make cash OFF of you, not FOR you so I know this will be down-voted to all hell, I just hope a few people get to see it and maybe even open their eyes. 

The flood of down votes I get should be something in its self to think about. 






Edit:

Wow guys way to prove me wrong about the down votes. Gives me a bit more hope in the direction the sub is going. 

Just to clarify my stance after reading some responses…
Ref links aren’t the problem. I don’t like pyramid shaped earning models what ever form they come in but that’s not my rant. I only hope people understand that earnings on most these sites aren’t always what people make it out to be and to stop and think “is this guy getting something out of this?” before you buy what they are selling.

Last year while I was finishing a full-time 2 year Tafe course, I decided, as many of you have, to see if I can make a little bit of money online to help out, I tried a bunch of methods like writing online articles, a few of those sites where they pay you to click ads and all that stuff, but I wasn't even nearly happy with the results.

As an android phone user I constantly saw extremely simple apps on the store that had thousands of paid downloads so naturally I thought ""how hard can it be to make an app like that?"", so I downloaded the (free)android dev SDK, installed it, watched some instructional youtube videos on android app development and within a week or so had constructed my first app. It cost $25 to buy an android developer account capable of submitting apps to the store. I figured I'd make that money back anyway, so I bought the account and posted the app.

I posted it for $1.30 and made roughly 1-3 sales per day. Still nothing amazing. Fast forward a month or two and I had about 5~ simple little android apps up on the store which were netting me about $5-10 per day.

I thought I'd expand my operation so I got VMWare, installed a Mac OS on my PC and did the same thing for apple's iOS.

Combined I'm currently making $15~ a day with both android and iPhone paid apps as I've stopped making paid apps on them platforms.

About 3 months ago I thought I'd try making the apps free with ad support rather than charging $1 for them.

The results were fantastically better, so I made a new array of simple apps, uploaded them, but didn't charge for them.

I'm making roughly $35 per day just from free apps, combined with $15~ from paid android/iphone apps plus another $5~ per day from an experimental youtube channel I made a few months ago that has unrelated little how-to videos.

Obligatory [proof](http://imgur.com/a/OXYjj). I only just took these screenshots before writing this post.

These companies have very strict policies about sharing earnings, so I've made a throwaway and censored all personal details. For this reason also I'm not going to link any of the apps (I hear many horror stories about accounts being perma-closed for things like this)

Sorry if this is the wrong subreddit to post this.

AMAA I guess.

Edit: I forgot to mention the best part about all this!
It's all automated. I could forget about this whole operation and I'd still get those 4 payments each month straight into my bank account for years to come! :D

Basically I have all these items that aren't really worth selling.  I tried a garage sale, Craigslist and even ebay for some items.  But the truth is not a lot of people are looking for $5-20 items on Craigslist.  But if you want to get rid of some items fast the Craigslist free section is constantly being looked at by a bunch of different people.

The other day I put up an ad with the list of everything I had and at the end I said ""All of these items are free but if you brought be some beer I wouldn't say no."".  Within an hour I had 4 emails asking what kind of beer I liked.  One by one I invited people over and one by one they handed me anything from a couple Pyramids Wheat Ales they had sitting in the fridge to a 24 pack of miller.

Hiring now!",368,64,169,http://www.reddit.com/r/beermoney/comments/14rnyl/make_15hr_videochatting_with_people_online/,"hey r/beermoney! as a recent college grad who majored in Philosophy, this was perfect for me:

called SkimaTalk, it's a start-up by these two grad students. The idea's basic: people who want to learn English pay to speak on Skype with a native speaker. sessions are 25 minutes long, and you get paid $7.50 per session (comes out to a little better than $15/hr). Not sure how to prove credibility, but I have done this, they pay at the beginning of the following month (first week of December for November work, i.e.), through PayPal.

What: you videochat with people who want to learn English. You decide on a ""lesson plan"" together or you just have a conversation.

Who: students (people paying you) are mostly Japanese professionals, business people and doctors. The site is expanding to Korea and Italy soon, I believe. There is also the odd housewife or young redditor type. teachers (people getting paid, i.e. you) are people who speak fluent native English and are in or have graduated from a college.

Get started?: To start you sign up on [the SkimaTalk website](http://www.skimatalk.com/become_teacher?locale=en). You get interviewed by one of the other teachers or people in charge, which is just to establish basic competence (are you coherent? do you actually speak English?). Then you're supposed to do 3 free sessions to get rated, then you get $7.50 (SkimaTalk charges the student $9; that's how they make a profit) for every 25 minute session.

When?: you set your availability, and get an email if someone books one of your open sessions. Since these are across many time zones, odd times are good times to make some $. I usually teach around 9 pm, but have had sessions at all times of day. You get a notification if someone books a session. You can also just go on the site and say ""available now"" if you have some free time that you didn't schedule, and someone might book you.



Any other q's? Not sure how to assure you this is legit... according to Koji, who runs it (just spoke with him today), someone made about $600 last month -- I tend to make closer to 250, but it's great for when you have some free time. Good for beer money!


Sorry if I did this post wrong or anything! Is there a place I can put my name for referrals? If you put my name down &amp; become a teacher I get $20! Pay it forward! Any q's?

Alright cool! Here's the link again!:

EDIT:

TL;DR: $15/hr, make your own schedule, videochat with strangers, no training, do as much as you want, just sign up! [&amp; put down my name, PM me for it!]

1340134041.0,247,self.beermoney,vafy8,My system and average monthly income. ,297,50,88,http://www.reddit.com/r/beermoney/comments/vafy8/my_system_and_average_monthly_income/,"Just thought I would give a rather lengthy post detailing what sites I use to make some extra spending money as online income and what my average monthly income is from them. I think it would be a good idea for others to share their systems as well to help give others tips. 

[Ibotta](http://ibotta.com/r/ptBaQ) is a service that pays you to shop. When you open the app you see all the options of items. When you hit the item they have various tasks, most just take a second. Answer a poll, view a short ad (usually less than 10seconds), view the facebook page, etc. When you complete the tasks (you can do the tasks at home ahead of time) you will get xx amount for buying the item. You simply buy the item, scan the barcode, upload a pic of the receipt and they deposit the amount in your account within 24 hours on weekdays. You have to have at least $5 to cash out and it is via PayPal. 

[Crowdini](http://www.crowdini.com) is a little bit of a game. Every day there is a question, you answer it. If you answer in the majority you move on towards the prize. Answer wrong and you are eliminated from that ""game"". There is a new game every day so if you lose, you just start a new game the next day for a different prize. So it's as simple as answering one single multiple choice question a day. One my new favorite sites. It is relatively new, and they have great support, and payout quick if you win. Great service, highly suggest this site. 

[ClixSense](http://www.clixsense.com/?4870918) is a site that pays you for watching ads. You also can click randomly on the clixgrid to try to win random amounts. You can also complete offers and take surveys. They are one of the oldest PTC sties and are very reliable. They also have a premium account, for $17 a year you can earn more from referrals, and have to view an ad for less time to get paid. 

Bamboo Wallet is an iOS and android app (called junowallet on android) that has you do various things to earn rewards. It has surveys, try apps, complete offers, it is very similar to some of the various websites, but is an app. If you want to use my referral just enter TH1272839 after creating your account when it asks you for your invite code. Entering an invite code also earns you $0.25 at sign up. 

[GiftHulk](http://www.gifthulk.com/invite/TH98425) is sort of like swagbucks and superpoints combined. Same deal as most sites, do surveys, watch ads, complete offers and get points. But like superpoints there is a treasure chest that rewards random points. The more active you are the more keys (tries) you have to get more random points. 
 
[Tapporo](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.tapporo&amp;hl=en) is an android app very similar to bamboo wallet/junowallet made by the people who do gift hulk. It is not a gift hulk app, it is a completely seperate service, just run by the same people. Try apps, watch videos, complete offers and get points. Redeem points for rewards. They offer gift cards including amazon, as well as paypal. My referral code is TAPTH1423 and you will get a little bonus when you use it. 

[Quirky](http://www.quirky.com/?r=04552d4bd936c36aaf2c263874361bce) is a site where you get involved in different parts of a products development. You vote on ideas you want to see make it further, help design, help revise designs and get a % of commission for it. When someone buys said product you were involved in, you get a portion of the sale. At first the income is slow, but if you are active for a while you can get some decent profits. 

[FreeMyApps](http://m.freemyapps.com/share/url/267a79c6) is an iOS app that has you try out apps for credits, then redeem them for amazon or iTunes cards, as well as various paid apps. Notably they regularly have $1 and $2 amazon cards that are easy to get, so you can cash out often. The ratio of credits to dollars is the same as the higher values, so no reason to save up and wait.

[FeaturePoints](https://featurepoints.com/r/P31E9Q) is just like free my apps. Download apps, get points, get rewards. The difference here is feature points has paypal. To start off with an extra 50 points use code P31E9Q at sign up

[Viggle](http://join.viggle.com/thudia) is an iphone/android app that you watch ads and check into TV shows. Ads very in value and different shows have different bonuses. One of my higher payout sites, and very reliable, with an active social media presence and great support. My system is watch ads throughout the day whenever I have a minute, and check into the most valuable prime time shows. Average monthly income = $30-$50 in value for various gift cards/rewards

[Mturk](http://mturk.com) well knows service, I'm sure most of you use it already, but do surveys/other tasks for various pay. Turkopticon plug in helps you weed out bad requester. Average monthly income = $120-$200 depending on how lazy I get. My goal is $5 a day for $150/mo. Sometimes I get it, sometimes I don't. Sometimes I skip a few days then get a $15 day, just depends. 

[Swagbucks](http://www.swagbucks.com/?cmd=sb-trk&amp;t0=blgTrk&amp;t1=5136201&amp;t2=69) is another common one I am sure you most use. But get points, get rewards. My system is getting my 1st point everyday from the toolbar, I then do the daily poll, and daily no strings offers. I then get one daily search worth points, usually within a few searches every morning. I have a few referrals that are not really getting me much, but I get a little boost from that. I don't do surveys or anything else, just the 5 minutes it takes to do what I said. I also try to get swag codes when I can, but not often. My average monthly gain = $20 -$35 in amazon gift cards and paypal. 

[Bing Rewards](http://go.microsoft.com/?linkid=9778718&amp;rrid=CAE0F591-2696-4D99-8BB3-C09C606F7011) This one is slower but easy. Just search bing and get points. Everyones points seem to be different and random as to what the daily cap is. But I spend 3 minutes every morning doing my daily max. Just search and keep hitting related. Average monthly gain = $5 amazon gift card. 

[Neobux](http://www.neobux.com/?rh=6661696C65646A656469) pays for clicking ads. My strategy was right away rent 25 referrals, after about a week recycling I got 18-20 pretty active referrals in my list. I have just been doing the 5 minutes a day needed to earn referral income the next day. My first month I lost $2, because of investing in referrals, but I have renewed a good set of 25, and expect to come out ahead $6 this month and $12 next month. It depends if my referrals keep up and I don't have to recycle any more, and I plan on reinvesting for more, so slower start to making money, but can be good once you get going and start reinvesting earnings. 

[Topline](https://www.jointopline.com/register?fid=CS6VL7ZJ9H45) is slow paying but 100% passive. You just sign up, install the browser plug in and that is it. It replaces ads on sites with it's ads. It doesn't take up any more space, and isn't intrusive at all. I only make $5/mo and there is a $10 minimum to cash out, but it is completely passive. 

Lastly is apptrailers and m.appredeem.com these 2 share a points system and login, one has you watch commercials for apps, and one has you install an app and try it. My referral is: skinnylens0     
 Just playing with it when I have downtime I have made $15-$30/mo. 

So share what you do and how much you make. Worth noting is that neobux, superpoints,bing, topline, and swagbucks take me almost no time. I do them all in the morning everyday in under 30min. A few minutes each with topline being completely passive. I probably never spend more than an hour or two a day doing mturk either. So2 hours a day for $200+/mo cash and $50-$100 in gift cards every month isn't too shabby.

**FeaturePoints:** Go to featurepoints.com to get this web-app. Super popular, mentioned and spammed 1,000 times here (for good reason, it has an excellent referral program). Download free apps to get credits, and you can redeem them for Amazon, PayPal (SCORE!), iTunes, paid applications, and even an iPad Mini. One of the best interfaces of all of the beermoney apps, and EXCELLENT customer service. I'm sure you all know the spiel with FeaturePoints!

**AppBounty:** Go to appbounty.com to get this web-app. Another version of ""download free apps, get credits, redeem for prizes"". They offer Amazon, iTunes, and now Xbox live codes. What's great about them: **International!** They offer gift cards in the following countries, the USA, France, Spain, Italy, Germany, UK, and the Netherlands. Excellent customer service and they were quick to solve any crediting issues I had.

**FreeAppParty:** Download this in the iTunes store. Just started using this 3 weeks ago, another version of ""download apps, get credits (called Party Treats, don't ask), and redeem for prizes. They put two apps up a day which is nice, and after downloading the app you do a scratch off where you can win 200-1000 points (.20 to a dollar). Prizes are $15 iTunes and $15 Amazon. I enjoy the frequency with which they put up new apps, so although the prizes are a little pricey, I can endorse this one. 

**App Trailers:** Ah, the classic beermoney maker. Download in the iTunes store. Watch trailers for apps + download and test them to obtain credits. Lots of prizes, but most importantly, they pay PayPal (yes!). They usually add at least an app a day, and this is a solid way to make a couple dollars a month for only a couple minutes a day of work.

**AppJoy:** Download in the iTunes store. Another one you've probably already heard about. Download apps for credits which can be redeemed for Amazon/iTunes/Paid apps. Prizes are pretty pricey, but they have a lot of apps to download to get credit. Not one of my favorite apps due to the high cost of prizes, your time could be spent on better apps IMO.

**AppDog:** Find this at appdog.com. Here's one you've probably never heard about! Download apps and receive ""bones"" which can be redeemed for PayPal, iTunes, and Amazon. Pays **VERY** well, you can easily get $10 in 30 minutes! I personally LOVE this app, I just found out about it but it is amazing. *Highly Recommended*

**AppCasher:** Find at appcasher.com, your standard download apps for credits machine. Prizes are in Amazon and iTunes, not a bad app at all, sometimes getting credited is tricky, but nonetheless it's another solid way to get some free gift cards.

**FreeMyApps:** One of my personal favorites, find it at freemyapps.com. They follow the download apps for credits rule, but they pay very well for every app download, have debatably the best interface, and upload new apps every day. You can cash out for Amazon and iTunes, as well a number of other gift cards. I love this one!

**FreeAppSlots:** Find it at freeappslots.com, this ones interesting. Download apps which give you ""spins"", and you get to use those spins at the slot machine to get credits. These credits can be used for paid apps, Amazon + iTunes, and even iOS devices! This one pays well if you can hit it big, otherwise it's a little slow compared to the others. Customer service is iffy here as well.




**As far as referral codes go, don't care about them, start some trains below if you want, but the only reason I'm making this is to help my fellow brethren in the quest for some easy beermoney.**

...or i'll just tell you how I did it.

On June 25th, I made a little over $100 from turking. It was definitely one of my best days. I never thought I could make this kind of money over the internet. With mturk, I feel like people see it and then think ""ugh you can't make any money on there unless you transcribe or write articles"" but I do neither. 

I've decided that I want to help people with mturk. I would like to get more people involved. I see people post on here looking for ways to make fast money. When I see someone asking to make 5 bucks quick, I think ""oh you can easily do that with turking."" I think people get turned away because they start without the right information. I know a lot of other turkers that have joined at one point and then quit and eventually came back to it like years later and stuck with it that time once they joined forum. Hell, I did that too. I joined in 2011, made a couple of bucks, and then stopped. I went back to it like a year later, and this time I joined forums and followed hwtf and was able to get the hang of it very fast. I've been turking since.

For those of you that do not know what turking is, [here's a short video explaining it.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03RZ_VoozjI)
If you prefer text over videos, [here you go.](http://www.mturkhitstream.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=6&amp;t=3)

One thing that made me stop so fast the first time was because finding hits was so confusing. I've made a site to help specifically with that. On HitStream we post just hits. You can say we find the hits for you. 
www.mturkhitstream.com
this is also what [this](http://www.mturkhitstream.com/forum/viewforum.php?f=3) section of the forum does if you prefer forums


and here are other videos to help you get started.

also a list of tools that are very helpful when turking
[TOOLS](http://www.mturkhitstream.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=6&amp;t=4)

If any of you have any questions, please feel free to ask on here or my forum. I will help as best as I can. 

and one last thing I must point out, I do not make 100 bucks a day. I don't want to give anyone false hope. I try to make between $30 - $50 bucks a day. sometimes more on good days. If you ever check out mturk and it is slow, don't assume it is always like that. Some days are amazing, some days are good, some days are ok, and some are terribly slow. One day you can make 20 bucks, the next you can make 50. And do not expect to have 50 buck days when first starting.

Why?  Because THERE IS NO PRODUCT OR WAY TO USE IT.  So by default, you all are unable to make an informative post/comment.  Holy crap.  I can't believe this is happening.  Why would you sign up for something that's obviously a pyramid scheme?  Best case scenario the whole site is just an endless beta collecting your personal demographic info to sell off.  
  
Wait, don't answer that pyramid question because the answer is going to be ""but the FAQ says it's not!""  Wow.  Just wow.  Guys.  Why in the WORLD do they need to hide how the site is going to work?  What could possibly be the point?  Building ""suspense"" seriously?  This is the lamest thing I have ever heard and I'm frankly disappointed in this sub.  
  
The site currently has no function but information collection and no method of receiving payment.  It is not even beermoney until they set up a payment portal.  Right now you have only the PROMISE that if you get hundreds of people to sign up you'll get money through some mysterious means.

Really? You mean unlike other mods on other subreddits? This isn't a website that you need to host or maintain, all of that is done by Reddit. I don't really understand what these donations are for or why any mod thinks they deserve to get any.

If you want to make money off of this subreddit or other, just do what the rest of us do and post links to your sites.

I don't know, I just feel like this is no different than other mods of other subs that have tried to make money off of a subreddit when they do very little and spend absolutely nothing.

I think it's very disingenuous to ask for donations on a subreddit. Especially having it be the top thing in the sidebar? I mean come on...

---

Edit: So some of the mods have commented as well as a bunch of users in the community so I would like to make a quick edit.


Mod stoaster asks:
    
&gt;Is the donation information acceptable when put at the bottom where it isn't taking priority over the important things like Rules and Other Helpful Reddits?

I think more than the placement of the link (though I think it's far more acceptable at the bottom.) is the wording it in. Saying things like ""We moderate /r/beermoney without pay. To support us, feel free to send us donations in Bitcoin."" is an attempt to get people to believe you do far more than you actually do. Moderators on all of Reddit don't get paid, and for good reason. Moderating a subreddit is absolutely not moderating a website. If people want to donate because they have a place like this to talk about stuff like this, they should be donating to Reddit, the people fronting all of the costs and making sure this subreddit and others actually work, not you guys (do you all even get to touch the Bitcoins? Where the heck does it go?) People are not only under the impression that you are somehow taking care of this subreddit as if it was a website but some people believe these donations make their way back to the community. If that's the case I personally think it should say that, but I don't think that is the case.

   
&gt;Does it need to be removed entirely? Why or why not?

I think so. If we have bitcointip here than you don't need the donation link. If someone wants to donate to on of you for something you are doing they can give you a tip, right? I would rather see you guys participate in the community if you want money than have you act as though you are somehow doing enough to warrant being donated to.

I also don't think this community should be about donations. You having that donation link on the side, or anyone posting a donation link, doesn't help the community out in the least.

I guess in the end I think that if the subreddit is taking away from your real life enough for you to want or think you need money for doing it, than you need to appoint more or different people. Subreddits are absolutely not that time consuming to take care of, Reddit does almost all of the work for you. You are not doing enough that you deserve donations.",,False,,t5_2s5or,1372038352.0,,,True,t3_1gwbg2,http://www.reddit.com/r/beermoney/comments/1gwbg2/whats_up_with_this_donation_stuff/,

I will definitely continue to pass along other market research opportunities as they become available to me :D

**UPDATE 3**: Thank you all again for all of the overwhelming response to this post. I received another email from Pam at Schlesinger Associates today:

&gt;*We’re still recruiting so as soon as we’re done (which should be today), I’ll let you know who all was part of “Team Dave”. Looking forward to sending you a nice donation!""*

From my interpretation, if you don't receive a call today or tomorrow, then you most likely won't be chosen for this particular study :/

On a happier note, I've received messages from several of you that you were selected to take part in the study, which makes me happy for multiple reasons -- you're getting some decent unexpected money, and I'm able to raise more funds for a cause that's near and dear to me. Also, I sincerely appreciate the generosity of those who said that they will donate a small portion of their study incentive to my fundraising efforts. The power of the Reddit community to do good never ceases to amaze me.

I will continue to provide market research opportunities as they become available to me :)

**UPDATE 2**: I just got another email from my contact at Schlesinger.

&gt; Hi Dave

&gt; We're working on the next wave starting today so if your guys qualify, we'll call them.
**I think all but 4 of the good men you sent me yesterday pre-qualified**. I'll shoot you a note later and let you know who they were. 

This sounds like wonderful news -- I believe they are taking my recommendations to heart! I've also received word from a couple of you already that you've been formally accepted into the study. Awesome :)

IF YOU FILLED OUT THE SCREENER AND PRE-QUALIFIED PRIOR TO 9:00AM PST ON MONDAY (5/6/13), PLEASE FILL OUT [THIS SHORT FORM](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1mvC87GOYkB2ysQwDRpewSQ_NLWUTUSeFkCYrHiInSOY/viewform) SO I CAN TELL SCHLESINGER TO GIVE YOU PRIORITY CONSIDERATION FOR THE STUDY.

That specific cut-off time is because Schlesinger sent me a file around 9:30am that was filtered on people who listed me as a referral source. *If you filled out the survey after the file was sent over to me, then I know your name won't be on the list they're asking me to choose from.* It doesn't necessarily disqualify you from the study altogether, but it just means I can't request that you be added to the ""VIP"" list :/ 

**UPDATE 1**: Holy cow! I just got an email from Pam Lintner, VP of Qualitative Solutions for Schlesinger Associates' San Francisco operations. You guys rock!

&gt; Dave!
You’re amazing.  I’m diving into the data now to see what all we got but it looks like you’re raising some money.   **I wish with all my might that I had reached out to you earlier as you delivered more people than we can use for the Google project.  That said, I’m going to do everything possible that we use your folks for the final 100 to 150.**   Can I send you a list of folks that look to be a fit and then you cherry pick the ones you think are most likely to complete the study (and perhaps throw even more money your way)?  It’s critical to our study to have folks who are fully committed and I also want to be sure that you get money!

She just provided me with a list of **over 500 individuals who responded and listed me as a referral source!**  In light of this, I need to figure out a way to figure out how to associate your Reddit usernames with the names provided on the pre-screener, so I can provide that info back to Schlesinger.

If you filled out the pre-screener after 9:00am today, you are more than likely **not** on the list of potential candidates that was sent over to me to verify, and thus I have no way of ""bumping you up"" on the list.

There are more potentially qualified applicants than available slots for the study, so priority will be given largely on who I can directly refer and vouch for, and I can't do that based solely on Reddit screen-name :P

Hey Reddit friends! If you're a US male aged 18-40 and have an Android-based phone and a Gmail account, I have an exciting opportunity for you to make up to $200 for a minimal amount of work, and make a positive impact on the world in the process :)

Schlesinger Associates, a market research firm that I have worked with several times in the past, is looking to recruit males aged 18-40 for a study being conducted by Google. They are trying to better understand the information needs of individuals, and how they go about meeting those information needs.

Now here's the even more awesome part: Schlesinger Associates has offered to make a donation to [my fundraising efforts with The Leukemia &amp; Lymphoma Society's Team In Training program](http://pages.teamintraining.org/sf/ambbr13/daveandrade) for each candidate I refer to this study! It's definitely a win-win all around.

This week-long study involves responding to quick one-minute questions sent to your phone 5 times a day for 5 days, and completing one slightly more detailed survey (about 20 minutes) at the end of each study day. For completing the study in its entirety, you would be paid $200 for a minimal amount of work. They also offer partial payments starting at $50 for those who begin the study but do not complete it. For the record, I'm already enrolled in the study and am ready to start next week :)

I highly encourage you to fill out [this pre-screening questionnaire](https://www.research.net/s/helpdaveraisemoneyforhisride) -- they are looking to fill these remaining study slots as soon as possible. Be sure to select ""Dave A."" when asked if there was a specific person who referred you to this study :)

If you end up being selected for the study, please let me know so I can relay that to the folks at Schlesinger to make doubly-sure that they give credit where credit is due :)

**Note**: If you weren't prompted to provide an email address, it most likely indicates that one of your responses screened you out of the study because you didn't meet the specific criteria that they're looking for. If you *were* prompted for an email address, you may be contacted by Schlesinger, but it's not a guarantee that you will be selected to take part in the study.",,False,,t5_2s5or,1368842770.0,,,True,t3_1dr0l7,http://www.reddit.com/r/beermoney/comments/1dr0l7/google_is_seeking_males_1840_with_android_phones/,

If your like me you don't have time to click links, do surveys, or watch videos but still think that some free cash or gift cards at the end of the month would be fantastic. Here are some tools you can use to get points with doing any work! Feel free to share your own methods for passive income! Remember, these tools are for PASSIVE incomes that do not require checking in, clicking, or other time consuming tasks. Time is a valuable resource just like money!

[TopLine](https://www.jointopline.com/register?fid=LN2JV7N22MBC) ([Refferal](https://www.jointopline.com/register?fid=LN2JV7N22MBC)/[nonref](https://www.jointopline.com))
 is one of the easiest passive income tools available. You simply install the TopLine addon for the browser of your choice and instantly start earning points. Topline uses adspace on webpages and inputs its own ads as you browse webpages. In my experience, the ads have not been invasive although I did have to turn off Adblock Plus in Firefox for TopLine to work. You can earn hundreds of points a day to trade in for paypal cash. Right now the conversion is $0.75 per every 1000 points. I like TopLine because after installation it is completely passive. 


[i-Gagnant la barre](http://www.i-gagnant-barre.com/?u=bunzdude&amp;lang=en) ([Refferal](http://www.i-gagnant-barre.com/?u=bunzdude&amp;lang=en)/([nonref](http://www.i-gagnant-barre.com)) is a simpler version of Topline that also allows you to acquire passive income. The program requires you to download an advertisement bar where advertisements are streamed continuously. The advertisement bar can be placed anywhere in your browser so on my larger computer monitors I don't even notice it. This can be used in conjunction with Topline. i_Gagnant la barre also utilizes the point system. The current conversion rate is 0.0935 euro/1000 points. I believe I earn about 100 points an hour. It is not the fastest way to earn money but every bit counts!

[Vagex](http://vagex.com/?ref=139431) ([Refferal](http://vagex.com/?ref=139431)/[nonref](http://vagex.com)) is another tool that I use to passively create income. It is a program that you use to view youtube videos and in return you receive points that can be turned into cash. Because this thread is primarily focused upon true PASSIVE incomes I would like to focus upon the View Count Vagex viewer. It is a program created by Vagex that auto-updates and auto-watches youtube videos. It also auto-likes, auto-subscribes, auto-favorites, and auto-comments for additional points. After setting up the ViewCount program, mute the program using the sound mixer and just leave it running. It only requires CPU processing when loading the youtube video that may last anyway from 10 seconds to 400 seconds. Points are credited based upon how long the video is. 

[Bing Rewards](http://go.microsoft.com/?linkid=9778718&amp;rrid=70C70210-44B0-4955-A1E9-91E1899739B9) ([Refferal](http://go.microsoft.com/?linkid=9778718&amp;rrid=70C70210-44B0-4955-A1E9-91E1899739B9)/[(nonref)](http://www.bing.com/explore/rewards). I'm sure you've heard of Bing by now. Unlike Google it has a great rewards system that can be used to earn Microsoft points, Amazon gift cards, and other prizes. At the very least you will earn $2.50 Amazon gift cards every month by only using the Bing search. Everyday a user is allowed a certain number of reward points utilizing the search engine. If you use Bing exclusively and also use the related searches on the sidebar it is extremely easy to hit your daily reward point cap for searching.

[Cash Texts](http://cashtexts.com/by/bunzdude) ([Refferal](http://cashtexts.com/by/bunzdude)/[(nonref)](http://www.cashtexts.com/) is the other program I use for passive income. This program begins after you submit a phone number that can receive text message advertisements that are valued at $0.05. After completing the form and a survey of your interests this program becomes completely passive. If you do not want to give out your mobile number, use a Google Voice number so that your mobile number remains safe.

There are other passive income sources available such as BitCoin Mining, CashGopher, Gomez Peer, and other programs that use your computer's resources when it is idle for computing power. Personally, I prefer that I am the only one using my computers resources and many of the affiliate programs that use these methods have so-so reviews from participants. These programs can also require so much power from your computer that your electrical bill can increase larger than your earnings so I would not recommend these data mining methods to everyone. 

My final piece of advice for anyone attempting to make income online is to create a new e-mail address that you will only use for these income enhancing programs. That way you can stay on top of offers or alerts as they come and have complete control of your accounts. 

So what types of passive income do you use? I'd love to find more!

If anyone needs help feel free to message me or leave a comment here. I'd be happy to help!

I feel like I have quite a few ideas when it comes to residual income (ideas that actually work and that ive been using) and I have started making videos to help other people in my same situation.  

[Selling Used or Unwanted Books on Amazon for 20-50 bucks a week](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sAgt5exBLyc)

I have been selling books on Amazon for about 2 years now.  I usually get the books for super cheap (thousands of books for 50-100 bucks) and I spend probably an hour of my free time every week once the books are listed, making anywhere from 20-50 bucks a week. Which could be increased if it was something i actually wanted to pursue.  I personally know a guy who employes 5 people and makes 100k a year for himself doing this.

*I had a lot of people ask me where to buy shipping envelopes, So i posted a link in the video description where you can get those in bulk. 

*Also people want to know where to get books.  I usually just post in my local classifieds that i am interested in picking up large quantity of books for free.  And i usually get a few calls a month from people who are just clearing out their library. And all i have to do is go pick it up.  Thats the best way.  The last person who called me wanted 100 bucks, but it was worth it to pay for a couple thousand books. 

[Using my Amazon Affiliate Account to monetize a website or YouTube Channel](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_q8lKs84gQQ)

I use Amazon hyper links in the description of the videos on my YouTube channel [JerryRigEverything](http://www.youtube.com/user/JerryRigEverything/videos?flow=grid&amp;view=0) to  generate a passive income.  That channel deals mostly with auto repair and fixing stuff, so I place links relating to the part I am replacing in the video description and I get a percentage of whatever sells on amazon.
You can use these links to make money on Pintrest or your own websites as well.

[Aeration helped me have $10,000 in the bank by the time I was 19](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lRb_EnPPXm0)

Anyway... All of these videos are made by me, and if the response is good enough, I plan on making more. These are all things that I personally find interesting.  So hopefully it’ll help someone else in need of some passive income. I enjoy feedback, so let me know if you have any questions.

Ive gone through many sites in the past year. However,  only keep up with sites that are more worth my time. Here is my list of sites that I personally feel are worth the minimal input for the money you get in return.

------

Tellwut: [Ref Link](http://www.tellwut.com/?refer=ZEROrevive) / [Non Ref](http://www.tellwut.com) - A very basic short poll site. Most of the polls on there take me between 2 seconds to just about a minute and a half. For each poll you get around 5-15 points. It costs 4,000 for a $10 Amazon Giftcard. Polls do slow down after you've taken all of the ones available, but I generally get 8 or more a day at the very least.

Neobux: [Ref Link](http://www.neobux.com/?r=ZEROrevive) / [Non Ref](http://www.neobux.com) - PTC site, one of the easiest ones around. I generally have two windows up, and click ads and let them load on one window while doing other things on another. I find it better than ClixSense due to the fact that I can multitask while using it. You can also rent referrals, which can be profitable. There are plenty of guides posted on beermoney for those who are interested.

Swagbucks: [Ref Link](http://www.swagbucks.com/refer/ZEROrevive) / [Non Ref](http://www.swagbucks.com) - Make points for rewards such as Amazon Giftcards. This is one of the first sites I used. Currently I make points on here by putting in daily Swagbucks codes. I also started using Coupons on here, which do infact work. A $5 Amazon giftcard costs 450 points, though you are limited to ordering 5 per month.

Pinecone Research: [Invite Link](http://pinecone.logicalmedia.com/?affid=CD25538) - No referral link for this one, as its invite only. You get paid $3 per survey, and are never disqualified in the middle of taking a survey. Pays in both Checks and Paypal. Ive already gotten 2 checks in the mail from them, rather swiftly. 

Paid Viewpoint: [Ref Link](http://paidviewpoint.com/?r=wl4ih7
) / [Non Ref](http://paidviewpoint.com) - Another great survey site. You never get disqualified, and can make at least 10 cents a day with their short surveys. Pays in Paypal. Minimum cashout is $15.

Listia: [Ref Link](https://www.listia.com/signup/1551812) / [Non Ref](https://www.listia.com) - Not exactly a full pledged Beermoney site, but you do get 500 points to use for bidding when you sign up. It basically works just like Ebay. Ive sold Beyblade Online codes on here, and will be selling boxtops soon. You can do offers to gain more points to use as well.

Topline: [Ref Link](https://www.jointopline.com/?fid=TTY6TDZ4C5YC) / [Non Ref](https://www.jointopline.com) - If you use adblock, then you may be interested in Topline. Topline is a addon that replaces website ads with their own, and in return, you gain points. Points can be exchanged for Money in Paypal or a mailed in Check. Minimum Cashout is $10.

Bing: [Ref Link](http://go.microsoft.com/?linkid=9778718&amp;rrid=_8093baa5-d7ee-9f30-27c5-cd1b5d9dd9e4) / [Non Ref](http://www.bing.com/) - Another good Semi Passive income. You search using Bings search engine and get 1 point for every 2 searches. Once you reach gold, you can get great discounts on rewards to cash out on. With gold membership, a $5 Amazon Gift card is 475 points.

Mturk: [Non Ref](https://www.mturk.com/mturk/welcome) Most people know about this site. This is my biggest income site in general. I only do hits posted on [HitsWorthTurkingFor](http://www.reddit.com/r/hitsworthturkingfor) to save me general time and effort. Payments go into your Amazon Payments account, and can be cashed out into your Amazon Giftcard balance. Can also be cashed out into your bank account, but i have not tried that myself yet.

Do you love music?  Do you love money? Then check out Slicethepie!

Slicethepie is a website where up-and-coming artists submit music and pay for people to listen and give a review of it.  You only have to listen to 90 seconds of each song and you can type the review while listening.  Payment for each song depends on the length and quality of the review you type.  Typically, mine are about 50 words and I get a payment of about 20 cents per review.

Now, that doesn't sound like much, but think about the math.

60 minutes*60seconds = 3600 seconds

3600 seconds/90 seconds per review = 40 reviews per hour

40 reviews*0.20 dollars = $7.20 per hour.

Feel free to message me and ask me any questions you may have!  Hopefully you all enjoy it as much as I do!

Edit: It may only be available in the US.  Some people are telling me that it is not allowed in their country, unfortunately.

Edit: tl;dr I make over $300 extra dollars a month by spending just over an hour a day on this site.
The signup takes about 3 minutes, and no credit card or age verification is required.  No personal information whatsoever.

As I am a student, I am both short on money and time, and so over the course of my beermoney career, I've tried to perfect the art of making the most amount of money online with the least amount of time and effort.  This obviously means that I am not fulfilling my potential, as I could be making a lot more money using something like Mturk, or another site where you can do tasks.  This does mean however, that my daily routine is easy for anybody to follow, and make a fairly good amount of money for very little work.

**What sites do you use?**

The first site I go to on my quest for daily beermoney is [Crowdini](http://www.crowdini.com).  Most people already know about it, but for those who don't, every day you answer 1 question, and the people who answer in the minority are eliminated.  The last one standing gets whatever the prize is, many of which are high value.  They have things like $25 amazon gift cards, Pandora One subscriptions, and many others!  This usually takes me 1 minute.

Second on the list is [GiftHulk](http://www.gifthulk.com/refer/thekiwi99).  This is a site that is very similar to swagbucks, but in my opinion, it is way easier to earn money with GiftHulk.  Every day, you can use your treasure box keys, which are free chances at prizes like giftcards, and hulk coins, take the daily poll for 1 hulk coin, and do many other things, like watch videos, or take surveys, also for hulk coins.  I can usually get between 120 and 150 hulk coins a day, for only 15 - 20 minutes of work doing the treasure box, daily poll, and surveys.  That roughly translates to 4,200 hulk coins a month, or around $50 in amazon gift cards.  Not bad for 15 minutes a day.

The third site I visit every day, is [ClixSense](http://www.clixsense.com/?4894814&amp;reddit1).  This is a PTC site, where you click ads and earn a small amount of money.  This might not seem like a great earner, but when you also take the surveys and play the clixgrid like I do, it has great potential.  It usually takes me about 5 minutes to do the clixgrid, and the required clicks.  Another great source of income on ClixSense is referrals.  I have invited friends and family to join, and I get money from all of their clicks as well.  There are 8 levels of ClixSense referrals, meaning if you refer somebody, and they refer somebody, you get money from both, up to 8 people deep!  If you know a lot of people who would use ClixSense, and tell their friends about it, you can make a LOT of money.

The fourth and final site that I use is c.  Another PTC site, this one is slightly more complicated, so to assist you, feel free to see the tutorial I wrote for it [right here](http://www.reddit.com/r/beermoney/comments/16h0ij/detailed_neobux_tutorial_earn_money_for_working_5/).  I usually only use neobux for about 5 minutes a day, but like ClixSense, if you can get lots of referrals and if you do mini jobs, it has great potential to be a big earner.

**How much can I make?**

This is a fairly easy question to answer, as I can break down by site how much I make every month.  So far, I haven't won [Crowdini](http://www.crowdini.com) yet, so thats a 0, but it's fun, and I hope to win soon!  I make about 50 dollars a month from [GiftHulk](http://www.gifthulk.com/refer/thekiwi99), and if you're willing to spend more than 15 minutes a day on it, you could double, or even triple that amount.  I'm nowhere near earning my full potential on that site.  On [ClixSense](http://www.clixsense.com/?4894814&amp;reddit1), I can make a few dollars a day from all my referrals, and their referrals, and their referrals, and so on :).  The most I've made in one day was near 10 dollars, and every month it can be anywhere from $75 to $150.  Finally, with [NeoBux](http://www.neobux.com/?rh=7468656B6977693939), I can make a couple dollars a day, that adds up to near $50 a month.  If I do mini jobs, I can earn a few more dollars every week, and maybe increase that to $75 a month.  In total, thats $250 extra dollars a month, for only 30 minutes of work every day!  Pretty good!

**Why should I use your referral link?**

Simply put, its a great way to thank me for getting you started in the right direction!  It can help me make a little bit extra, and there's no reason for you NOT to use it, unless you want to hurt a fellow member of the beermoney community.  Regardless, if you don't want to help me out, here are the links again.  The ref-link is on the left, in case you change your mind, and the non-ref one is on the right.

Noticing this, I’ve tried to put together a list of the most recommended sites by people on this forum.  As this is a collective of both my experiences as well as others on this site, I hope that you will use datsoup (see the sidebar) for your referral links. If you insist on using mine, I will put them in the comment sections below. So without further ado, I present to you the beginners beermoney compendium!


MOBILE APPS
------------------

**Bamboo Wallet:** Failedjedi had posted about this app a few times on this forum but I have not personally tried it yet. The app is available on the iPhone/Android store and allows you to complete surveys, try apps and complete offers (very similar to swagbucks, etc. but mobile). Failedjedi reports that he makes about $5 per week with little effort using this app. For a $0.25 signup bonus enter failedjedi’s code TH1272839.


**AppReviewerPro** is a mobile app where you download free or paid apps and write a review on the app. Your reviews don’t have to be lengthy or detailed to earn credit. Each review credits $0.40-$0.50 with the paid apps crediting for $1.50. You can read my discussion on the app [here.](http://www.reddit.com/r/beermoney/comments/zqnjx/appreviewerpro_discussion/)


**Cash Texts** is a passive earner where you submit your mobile phone (or Google Voice) number and receive text message ads. 


**FreeMyApps** is an app available for the iPhone where you try out apps for credits which can be cashed out for amazon or itunes giftcards. Please check out datsoup for a referral link. 


**Viggle** is another app available for iphone/android where you watch adds and check into popular TV shows for credits. There has been a lot of talk lately that the have decreased payouts and earnings but is still a viable option for those with some free time on their hands. Viggle no longer has a referral system, so don’t worry about a ref link for this one. 


**Apptrailers** and m.appredeem.com: these apps are quick earners at first but quickly slow down. You will earn around $15 for watching trailers for apps and downloading the apps. Open the apps for around 30 seconds and you will receive a notification that you have been awarded points. These apps are notoriously glitch in awarding points so if you don’t get your points at first, just keep trying. 


PASSIVE EARNERS
---------------------

**Topline** is a completely passive earner. It works by replacing ads on websites with ads from their customers. It is a very slow earner but does not take any effort so is completely worth it. The more you browse, the more points you will earn. Right now, every 1000 points is worth $0.75 and minimum payout is $10. You will also earn 5%(?) of your referral’s earnings. If you use adblock, simply disable it on all sites except where you watch videos (youtube, etc.) and be on your way. Also, do not use an autorefresher to earn extra points, again you will be caught and banned. The people in charge of Topline have been very active in this forum and are very open to feedback, so if you have a problem, don’t hesitate to contact them.


**Vagex**  is a passive earner that allows you to download a youtube video player that will auto-watch, like and subscribe to youtube videos. Simply mute the program and leave it running and you are good to go. 


SURVEY SITES
---------------------

**[Pinecone Research](http://pinecone.logicalmedia.com/?affid=CD25538):** This site is invite only (invite thanks to ZEROrevive). Pay is $3 per survey with no disqualifications through the survey. Cashout is via check or paypal.


**Paid Viewpoint** is a survey site with only 10 question multiple-choice surveys. Each survey pays between $0.10 and $0.20. You will earn $1 for each referral that completes 6 surveys. 


**PollBuzzer** is a very simple poll service. You will be emailed a link to a one-question survey when available and paid $1 directly to your paypal account when you answer. There are not a lot of polls available but for such low effort you can’t ask for a much better service. 


**Tellwut** is a very simple poll site with very short polls. This will be a quick earner to start and then slow down quite a bit. Most of the polls take anywhere from 5 seconds to 2 minutes. You will receive 5-15 points per survey and a $10 Amazon giftcard costs 4,000 points. After completing all of the initial polls you should be able to net a $10 giftcard in a 1 ½ - 2 months for very little effort. 


PTC SITES


**Neobux** is a PTC site where you click ads and get paid very small amounts of money. What makes this site unique is that you can use your earnings or invest money to rent referrals and you will be paid for these referrals clicks. Overall I have not been very happy with Neobux, but a lot of people on beermoney recommend it. I expect to earn a net gain off the site but will not continue once my current rented referrals expire. There are many helpful guides on getting started with Neobux on this site, just do a quick search to find a plethora of information.


**ClixSense** is another PTC website that is based on direct referrals and mini-tasks. There is also a mini-game available with a chance to win cash or points. 


GPT SITES
----------------------

**Gifthulk** is a site that allows you to earn points in a number of various ways. You can: 
*Search and win coins
*Complete the daily poll
*Complete surveys or offers from their offer walls or EZ coins
*Enter Fountain of Youth codes (posted to their twitter, facebook, or toolbar)
*Open the treasure chest for a chance to win coins, codes or boosts (you will start with 5 chances and earn 1 daily chance for every referral who earns over 50 coins total)
*Refer friends and earn 20% of their earnings from offers/tasks/surveys/ez coins.

I usually complete the daily poll, open the treasure chest and conduct a few searches to get $5-$10 in amazon giftcards per month with very little effort. It would be very possible to get a lot more if you have the time to do surveys/offers.


**Swagbucks** is a very common site that pays you to watch videos/search/complete offers. I complete the daily poll, the NOSO path, search until I win, and watch out for daily codes. One of the easiest ways to earn on swagbucks is to watch the comedy videos on their mobile app available for android devices (the comedy videos are the shortest and will earn bucks the fastest). If you don’t have an android, go to http://bluestacks.com/, download and install and search for the swagbucks app. This will just continuously run videos except occasionally an ad will pop up that you need to exit out of. I max these out daily along with the other things mentioned above to earn around 75 “swagbucks” per day which I cash out for $25 in amazon giftcards. Two important notes for this site: 1. Do not use an autorefresher to watch swagbucks tv as is recommended elsewhere, I have been banned for this 3 times, every time I thought I was being smart and wouldn’t be caught. They will catch and ban you. 2. Sign up for text alerts for swag codes by texting follow swagcodespoiler to 40404 if you are in the US, 21212 if you are in Canada, and 86444 if you are in the UK.


**Superpoints** is a site very similar to swagbucks/gifthulk. You can watch videos, complete offers, and you will receive a daily email which gives bonuses. Superpoints also has a superlucky button that you can click daily for a chance to win a reward. For more information, check out this [guide from stoaster](http://weblootcentral.blogspot.com/2012/02/superpoints-is-one-of-many-sites-that.html). 


**Naturebucks** or Nature GPT. These two sites are very similar and are both highly recommended by other redditors. You can complete offers and surveys for cash or points. The referral program is great, you will earn 20% from level 1-5 referrals. 


OTHER EARNERS
---------------------------

**Quirky** is a very innovative site where you vote on ideas for new products or suggest names/taglines/etc. for the product to earn “influence” on the product. If the idea is made and sells, you earn a % commission based on how much influence you have on it. I have not been active on this site, but others have promoted it as a great way to earn some passive income after investing a good deal of time initially. They report that income is very slow at the start but if you are active enough it can grow into some great income. 


**[Amazon Mechanical Turk](https://www.mturk.com/mturk/welcome)** is by far my best earner but also takes the most time to make a decent amount of money.  Requester’s pay for people to complete menial tasks such as surveys, transcriptions and writing articles. Payout will initially go to your account balance and can be easily transferred directly to your bank or used directly on amazon.com. Minimum payout to the bank is $10 and is easy to hit. It is important to note that you will be asked for your SSN upon signing up. To date I have never heard anyone having any problems with this. My goal is $5 a day but I usually surpass this a bit and average about $200 per month. IMPORTANT: download the turkopticon extension and check the rating of all requesters before you begin a task. This will save you some unfair rejections which can make it difficult to get started. I also highly recommend checking out r/hitsworthturkingfor as they post some of the best surveys available. Another hint is to create a bookmark for a search for anything over $0.25-$0.50 that you are qualified for.


**Bing Rewards** This one is slow but simple. Just sign up and search. Everyone’s daily points seem to max out at a different level, but once you find your max just search for something then keep hitting different “related searches” until you max out. This will take max 5 mins per day and you should be able to net a $5 amazon giftcard every month. 


**SliceThePie** is a website that pays you for reviewing songs. Make sure you write good reviews for $0.20 per review. Cashout is $10.


Anyways, that should be a decent amount of information to get you started making beermoney, but if you think I have left out any great sites, please feel free to let me know in the comments down below. Again, as I view this as a community effort, please use referrals from datsoup.

Giving this one more shot before I really do quit trying to offer advice.",144,44,85,http://www.reddit.com/r/beermoney/comments/1jmqwj/ok_so_to_help_some_people_get_started_giving_this/,"My inbox has blown up overnight with people wanting to learn more about how they can start making more than just ""beer money"" online.

So - below I am going to cover some different things that can start bringing in cash TODAY. BIG cash.

AFFILIATE NETWORKS:

I'm sure you have all heard of clickbank before.

I've never used clickbank, so I dont know about their payment system. What I DO know, is that people complain about their 60 day refund policy on all the products. 

That reason alone is why I have never bothered with CB.

If you want to, you can sign up there at www.clickbank.com

For people who DO NOT want to mess with CB, my list continues below:

The following affiliate networks pay you INSTANT COMMISSION, directly to your paypal. No waiting for payments. Its like they bought directly from you.

**JVZoo**

**Ref:** http://www.jvzoo.com/register/3989

**Non-Ref:** http://www.jvzoo.com

NOTE - For JVZoo, each vendor (product owner) sets the commission rates, and whether or not you are paid instantly, or with delayed payments. 

You will most likely start out on delayed until the vendor gets to know you better.

ALSO - JVZoo lets you list your own products for free, create an affiliate program, sales funnels, integrate with your autoresponder.. all kinds of cool shit. 

DEFINITELY check them out.

-----------------------------------

**RAP Bank (Rapid Action Profits)**

**Non-Ref:** http://www.rapbank.com

ALL of the products listed on RAPBank pay you INSTANT commissions. There is NO delayed payments settings at all. 

For example, lets say a product pays 50% commission. What this means, is that sale 1 goes to the vendor (product owner)

Sale 2 goes to your paypal.

Sale 3 to the product owner, sale 4 to you, and so on.

If a product pays 75% commission, sale 1 goes to vendor, sales 2, 3 and 4 go to you.

If a product pays 100% commission (there are a lot that do) then EVERY sale you make goes directly to you.

Vendors typically use 100% commissions to attract affiliates, and build their buyers list. 

What they don't earn on the front end, they make it up on the back end.

-----------------------------------------------

**DigiResults:**

**Non-Ref:** http://www.digiresults.com

This is another instant commission platform.

--------------------------------------------------

Now - For CPA (cost per action)

I'm sure you have all seen those offers like ""enter your email or zip code to test and keep a FREE iPhone 5!"" -- right?

Of course you have.

What you did NOT know, is that each time someone enters their email or zip, the person running that offer gets paid - even if you do not complete all of the steps &amp; receive the product!

That is an example of a CPA offer, and that is just ONE of the millions of products that they exist for.

CPA is a HUGE earner once you get the hang of it.

SO:

Assuming you are all new to CPA, sign up at Peerfly. They accept pretty much everybody.

Just be honest with your application, and if you are denied, give them a call or email them to get approved.

**Peerfly:**

**Ref:** http://peerfly.com/?r=47660

**Non-Ref:** http://peerfly.com

------------------------------------

**Here is a short video I just made to explain a little more about Peerfly &amp; how it works:**

http://tinypic.com/r/m9x75y/5

Don't mind the commentary.. I can never figure out exactly what I want to say when I'm doing a video (just talking to myself) lol

------------------------------------

I am also with several other CPA networks, but those are not as ""noob friendly"" when it comes to accepting publishers.

So I am not going to link those right now.

This short list should be MORE than enough to get you guys (and gals) earning some REAL cash on the web. I guarantee it.

ALSO -- Vertical is CPA terms for niche, just so you know what that means when you apply.

Hope this helps some people out.

This post was a lot longer than I expected it to be though, so I'm done typing for now.

1353024021.0,105,self.beermoney,139p3j,YouTube pays my cell phone bill and more.  It's my favorite source of passive Beermoney.  Ask me stuff,128,23,75,http://www.reddit.com/r/beermoney/comments/139p3j/youtube_pays_my_cell_phone_bill_and_more_its_my/,"A while back I saw an AMA of someone who was making more than $500 a month making silly youtube videos.  I fired up my old youtube account and started posting videos.  I am now at nearly 400,000 youtube views, am partnered and making some good side money.

In the last year I have only made a few videos but the checks keep coming.  Most of my views come from youtube and google searches.  When I make a new video I usually post it on Reddit and do a bit of SEO but that's it.  I am about to do another push with everything I have learned recently and hope that it will be paying my rent within a few months.  There is initial work with each video.  But what I love is that even if I don't make a new video for months or years I still keep getting paid.  

I make mostly cooking videos and the occasional random stuff.  Originally I tried to pander to the internet with stuff like BACON and CATS.  But I found more success in a different way.  For example I once got on the internet and tried to find a video on how to braise meat.  I couldn't find anything because the keywords I was using ""braise steak""  ""how to braise meat"" weren't coming up with anything good.  I finally called my mom and used her recipe.  But I used those keyword on my youtube video and ended up getting [13,000 views](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J9dibKewvvg) .   It's not even a good video but it brings me money every month.

I have been even more surprised by videos that had a lot of competition but because I used unique keywords I get views too.  Sure my video for [laundry soap](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6ME0F5bNHU) isn't number 1 but it gets views every month because I use the word ""detergent"" instead of soap.  

Here is my channel.  Shameless self promotion etc.:
http://www.youtube.com/ianmeek

I will answer any questions I can.

edit:  off to a film festival.  i will answer anything that comes up when i get back.

edit 2: thanks guys!  Glad I posted here.  Maybe we next time we can focus on getting lot's of views because that's where the money is at.

1375117013.0,87,self.beermoney,1jab91,My Weekly Routine to make $45. Only about 1 hour per day.,115,28,22,http://www.reddit.com/r/beermoney/comments/1jab91/my_weekly_routine_to_make_45_only_about_1_hour/,"So, I like many of you, like to make some extra cash online.  However I don't have a ton of time to work on sites.  I already work an 8+ hour day and only like to devote about an hour a night to online earners.  That means I need to be able work on the sites that are much more passive or can be done simultaneously.

For my nightly routine I use 1 GPT site, 2 PTC sites, 1 computer resources site and 1 writing site as well as a single smartphone app that I can do on the go or when I have some downtime.  6 sites all together and that can be done in conjunction with one another.  Overall it is pretty efficient and keeps me from trying to waste multiple hours on 20 different sites.

**CashCrate** [Reference] (http://www.cashcrate.com/4812602) l [Non] (http://www.cashcrate.com/)

My GPT site of choice is CashCrate.  I use this mainly for surveys.  I like it because it always finds surveys I am approved for.  I am on this site for around 1 hour each night.  It allows me to complete about 2-4 surveys in a 1 hour time window and I don't waste time searching around for things I am approved for.

**I make about $3-$5 a night on this site.**

They also have one of the best referral programs for GPT sites so if you can get some friends to sign up you can earn a bit more even.

In conjunction with this.  I use to PTC sites while I am working on surveys.  These PTC sites I keep open in a separate browser so that I can ""watch"" ads while I answer survey questions.  There are multiple ones out there, however I find the best to be:

**NeoBux** [Reference] (http://www.neobux.com/?r=Timmah33) l [Non] (http://www.neobux.com/)

**CashnHits** [Reference] (http://www.cashnhits.com/index.php?ref=timmah) l [Non] (http://www.cashnhits.com/)

Neobux is the most well respected of these sites it seems and the easiest to use.  It doesn't matter if I am focused on that browser or not while I watch ads, just as long as the tab is focused.  CashnHits is the other site I use while taking surveys.  I use two of these sites because I have around an hour to view ads while I work on Cashcrate which gives me plenty of time to watch all the ads. 

CashnHits is also great because it has an auto browsing feature that lets me run it and forget it in the background which pays around $0.20 a day.

**Between these 2 sites I make about $0.50 a day.**  Not bad for clicking a few buttons.

I also let my computer resources be used by Digital Generations.  I know this might be considered a pyramid scheme, however you earn $30 the first month you do it.  I was able to refer 1 friend in that time as well and earned enough to buy a 1 year thread that earns me $1 a day just for running the program in my background.  I probably wouldn't put any money into this, however if you just take the $30 and run after the first month or get 1-2 friends to sign up under you and buy a year long thread, its basically risk free money.

**Digital Generations** [Reference] (http://coingeneration.com/auth/new/347571/) l [Non] (http://coingeneration.com/)

**$1 a day**

**Web Answers** [Reference] (http://www.webanswers.com/_mc3tyqpo/) l [Non] (http://www.webanswers.com/)

Finally I work on 1 writing site. This is by far the easiest of the writing sites.  It involves answering questions and earning income using adsense.  I make sure I write for highly viewed questions.  It takes a little while to get started.  My advice is:

Answer 5 questions a night

Answer questions that have high views/low amount of answers

Answer questions that are newer

The first month is very slow.  I think I made $5 in a month.  Now things are picking up as I get more answers.  **I currently make about $5 a week with this strategy.**

Finally I use 1 smart phone app.  

**I use the new program Locket.**  [Reference] (http://getlocket.com/r/?48660719) l [Non] (http://getlocket.com/)

Its not much but it is completely passive and just pays you to display ads when you unlock your phone.  **I make about $1-$2 a week using this app.**  

CashCrate              $21-$35 

CashnHits                $1-$2

NeoBux                   $1-$2

Digital Generations    $7

WebAnswers            $3-$8

Locket                    $1-$2

**Totals**             **$34-$56**

On average I make about $45 a week doing about an hour of work each night.  Again a few take about a month or 2 to get going properly, but I enjoy completing these and having around $150 extra each month I can invest.  Hope you enjoyed.  Feel free to ask me any questions on any of these programs.

**Swagbucks**

Swagbucks has a variety of ways to earn money.

* By searching daily (I usually win about 4 times each day. On average about 10 swagbucks but sometimes up to 50.)

* By using SwagBucks TV - You earn 3 Swagbucks for every 10 videos watched. If you want to earn sawgucks really fast you could use an auto-reloader [Firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/reloadevery/) and set it to reload every 55 seconds. Do not watch too many videos or your account might be banned.

* By Playing Games - while you are playing games on swagbucks.com swagbucks are randomly awarded to you.

* By completing the daily poll every day you can earn 1 Swagbuck

* By completing Daily surveys - You complete daily surveys for swagbucks

* By completing Special Offers - These range from competition entries to site registartions to surveys. These offers give you a lot of swagbucks.

* By completing daily tasks hosted by Crowdflower - These tasks have a fairly low payout but can be completed countless times.

This is another site that i cant use because im from Ireland but everybody else here on beermoney seems to be using it. Heres a **[Guide fom stoaster](http://weblootcentral.blogspot.com/2012/02/superpoints-is-one-of-many-sites-that.html)** if you want to learn more about this site.

**Here is what redditor [g000dn](http://www.reddit.com/user/g000dn) said about Superpoints**

&gt;Superpoints is very, very similar to Swagbucks. You can watch videos to earn points (not nearly as much as you can earn on Swagbucks), complete offers, receive a daily e-mail that literally contains currency, and their Superlucky Button, a button that can be clicked 30, 50, or 100 times daily to earn points, depending on your membership level.

&gt;Offers can be completed through Superpoints, and I highly recommend a certain few. Signing up for a free 1-month trial of Netflix earns you 1000 Superpoints, which equates to exactly $10. There are many other free trial and offers that you can sign up for to earn easy cash. Stamps.com, VistaPrint, GameFly, just to name a few.

&gt;By providing your basic demographic information to SuperPoints, you are granted the Basic membership status, and allows 30 daily clicks of the SuperLucky Button. After referring two people to their site, you're upgraded to Gold status and can click 50 times a day, and you are also granted the privilege of earning what your referrals earn on the SuperLucky Button(huge potential to earn money here). At 5 referrals, you are upgraded to Platinum and can click 100 times a day and you are guaranteed a Superpoint on your first click, every day. I win, on average, 20-50 points a day on the button, between my referrals that also click the button daily, I often find myself cashing out $5-10 dollars weekly from their site, while putting very little effort in.

&gt;The person that referred me to Superpoints has earned 4,547 points through my SuperLucky Button winnings since December. That's $45 dollars in his pocket that he earned by doing nothing after initially referring me. My highest earner has earned me $20.

&gt;[Here](http://superpoints.com/refer/g000dn) is my referral link. If you sign up under me, MAKE SURE to contact me via private message here on Reddit and I will be more than happy to guide you along in great detail, and I will also help you to spread your referral link around so you can be on your way to cashing out money on their website frequently.

While studying with friends during dead week I was amazed at how many of them hadn't signed up for it and the ones that did didn't know what all they got from it. I am sure most of you here that are eligible already are using this but if not here are some useful things you get if you do sign up.

1. Free two day shipping from amazon. I am sure you will make a couple orders in the next 6 months so this alone should be enough to make setting it up worth it.

2. Prime Instant Video. Like movies and tv? Well this will allow you to watch streaming versions of some of your favorite shows for free. You can watch videos for free from Dora the Explorer to The Hunger Games. 

3. Exclusive student deals. I believe these include extra trade in for your textbooks and cheaper prices to buy or rent them. I honestly barely buy my books so this isn't something I have personally used.

4. They sometime have chances to earn free money by doing different things. Right now the big one is chance to win $10,000 by selling textbooks.

5. Want all of these deals after your 6 months are up? You can buy for 50% off for up to 4 years after your trial expires.

1350572939.0,87,self.beermoney,11ox05,InfoArmy Review - Make $15/hr Researching Businesses,111,24,133,http://www.reddit.com/r/beermoney/comments/11ox05/infoarmy_review_make_15hr_researching_businesses/,"I stumbled across InfoArmy on beermoney a couple weeks ago, but nobody had actually given the site a try. I decided that I would try it out, and actually got paid this past weekend! [$45 Paypal!](http://i.imgur.com/yZ3J4.png?1)

**General Info**

The premise of InfoArmy is pretty simple. They crowdsource information about businesses (mostly private companies) and resell the information to business professionals for a markup. They sell each report for $99 via an iPad app, but they are excited to offer an unlimited view subscription sometime in the future. However, the value in this model lies in the number of businesses that you have reliable information for - so they definitely need some help creating a lot of reports before selling unlimited view subscriptions.


**The Work**

Pretty much, you just google for certain information and plug it into the report. For example, [this is a sample from a report that I'm creating right now.](http://i.imgur.com/CcIMQ.png) Some reports have information already filled in, and all you have to do is check that it is correct. One report takes me 45min - 1.5 hours to complete, from start to finish. My goal for this week is to complete one to two reports per day. If you want to become more involved, there are badges and senior positions that mean different things, but aren't quite profitable yet.


**The Money**

Each report will net you $20 cash, no questions asked. You also receive a 40% revenue share if your report is purchased ($40). They will pay you per view or per purchase once they launch their subscription model, but most people just rely on the $20 per report to make money. If you factor in how much time one report takes, that comes out to $15 - $20 per hour! Not bad for monetizing your free time ;) They pay out every 15th and 30th of the month if they owe you money. There is no way to check how much they will pay you, but I keep an Excel spreadsheet to keep track of the reports I have completed.
Now, as a disclaimer, they claim the $20 is a ""bonus"" per report. They may decide to end this and go with an all-revenue sharing model once they become more established. But until then, it is amazing beer money.


**Links**
[Ref](https://www.infoarmy.com/ref/kleprev) | [Non-Ref](http://infoarmy.com)

Referrals give you $5 per referral once that referral completes their first report. Not bad, but the real money is in the reports still!

Welcome to /r/BeerMoney, we'll try to answer common questions among our posters to avoid filling the subreddit with re-posts!

**-What are some good sites to start with?/What sites can I use to make ""x"" amount?**

&gt;[Mechanical Turk](https://www.mturk.com/): Probably the most widely suggested site here because the payout is based off of how much time you put into it and it can be withdrawn directly to a bank account.
Also check out /r/HitsWorthTurkingFor if you're starting with MTurk.

&gt;[SwagBucks](http://www.swagbucks.com): The most widely used PTC (Pay to Click) site on the sub, if you're not familiar with them, these sites have different activites (surveys, polls, videos) that you can do/watch, to earn ""SwagBucks"" which then can be redeemed in their store for prizes and gift cards. The most codt efficient item to redeem from these sites is usually a $5 amazon gift card.


&gt;[Jebbit](http://www.Jebbit.com): A fairly new site where you answer a few questions about a webpage, called a ""campaign"". You can earn points and get streaks for answering questions correclty. This site pays out in cash to WePay, or you can use your earning in the Jebbit Store.

&gt;[TopLine](http://www.jointopline.com/): This is generally the beginner set it and forget it site. It's a chrome extension that replaces ads with their own sponsored ads and pays you $1 per 1,000 pages with topline compatible ads. 

**-Can I start a referral train?**

&gt;Referral trains are fine to start in the comments section of a post, but not on a new post. If you submit a new post about a website that is imformative, feel free to put your referral link in the post as well, as long as the sole reason of the post isn't to get referrals.

**-What I do when tax time comes around?**

&gt;Any website where you have over $600 of earnings from, should be included on you taxes in the form of a [1099](http://legal-forms.laws.com/irs/1099). On sites like MTurk where it's *very* possible to earn more than $600 a year, techinically the money must be all from one requester for the requester to send you a 1099, but this is a bit of a gray area. I would love for someone who knows more about taxes to elaborate on this.

**-How can I earn the most money?**

&gt;[Mechanical Turk](http://www.mturk.com): Has probably the highest potential earning power, along with [InfoArmy](https://www.infoarmy.com/), until the removal of the $20 bonus.

**-Can I use BlueStacks with beermoney apps such as SBTV or AppTrailers?**

&gt;Swagbucks will ban bluestacks users, but as for AppTrailers, you can use the app on bluestacks, but be wary of using things like auto-clickers, because they might get your account suspened, and in AppTrailers world, you might as well be banned.

**-How do I get more referrals?**

Let's face it. /r/beermoney has been great for a few bucks here or there, but it's not often that something comes along that earns you a lot of money. A couple of months ago, there was a [post](http://www.reddit.com/r/beermoney/comments/11bf5g/rentrepreneur_told_me_you_guys_like_residual/) about selling on Amazon. I decided to give it a go. Here are my results:

* My first step was to [purchase some envelopes](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000HG964S/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=ghg7584jr-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B000HG964S) from Amazon ([non-ref](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000HG964S) - see the bottom of this post for information on the Amazon Affiliate Program). I bought these cheapie, non-padded ones because I didn't know if I'd sell very much. I also bought some bubble wrap from Office Max. I spent more than I should have for not much bubble wrap. (When I ran out of that, I bought a [huge thing](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000NHXTTO/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=ghg7584jr-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B000NHXTTO) of it from Amazon. ([non-ref](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000NHXTTO)))

* While waiting for the envelopes to arrive, I got my spreadsheet together. It's nothing fancy. There are four columns: date, earnings, costs, notes. I don't keep an inventory in the spreadsheet, as I can just turn my head to the left to see my items.

* My wife and I went through old DVDs, books, and video games to see what we were willing to part with.

* I created my Amazon seller account, which can be done [here](https://sellercentral.amazon.com).

* When my envelopes arrived, I searched each item on Amazon to see if it would be worth listing. Keep in mind that Amazon takes $1 plus a percentage of the sale (ranging from 5% to 20%, I believe). While that seems high, keep in mind that you're paying them for a *massive* market! Generally, if you can sell it for a few bucks, it's worth your time. You get a feel for this after a few sales.

* **This is probably the most important part** of the sales strategy. With few exceptions, every single item I have listed has been listed for the lowest price on Amazon. Does someone have a copy of [Super Smash Brothers](http://www.amazon.com/s/?_encoding=UTF8&amp;tag=ghg7584jr-20&amp;linkCode=ur2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;rh=n%3A1064954%2Ck%3Asuper%20smash%20bros&amp;field-keywords=super%20smash%20bros&amp;url=search-alias%3Doffice-products&amp;sprefix=super%20smash%20b%2Coffice-products%2C221&amp;ajr=2) listed for $40 and described as “This passed through my dog and smells like a cow pasture”, while you have one in mint condition? List it for $39.99. It’ll get snatched up. (Obviously, use your best judgment. Some things might be worth holding onto if you can double your money. Generally, in my opinion, it’s a better option to move inventory than to hold onto your item for a couple more weeks to earn $3 more.)

* **Also very important** is to describe your item in the “condition” field. You want people to know what they’re going to get. Does your book have creases on some pages? A little bit of water damage? Mention it. It won’t stop people from buying. Multiple ratings I’ve gotten have written “item as described” in the review. This is important to the buyer.

* Now you’ll start getting orders. Package the orders as they come in. There have been 3 days where I’ve gotten 10+ orders. If you do 1 or 2 at a time, right as they come in, it makes it a lot easier to handle than to sit down and do all 10 at once.

* Post office time. I haven’t used UPS or FedEx, so I can’t speak for them. When using the post office, be sure you inform the worker which items qualify for media mail. Media mail (more info [here](http://postcalc.usps.com/PopUps/MediaMail.htm)) is a reduced-rate shipping option for DVDs, CDs, and books.

* Go to your seller page, mark the items as shipped, and Amazon will credit your account with the amount of the purchase. That’s all there is to it.

* A week after I've shipped an item, I send the buyer a message thanking them for their purchase and requesting that they leave feedback. I include instructions on how to reach the feedback page.

**Tips:**

* Once you acquire some money from selling the items you have lying around (and I didn’t count items I already had toward any costs), reinvest the money in buying books or video games from Craigslist in your area.

Here’s a story from a couple weeks ago: I found someone selling 18 games and a console for $100. I searched all the games on Amazon and figured that if I offered $60 for 8 of his games, I could make $100 after shipping. (I could’ve low-balled him, but I’d rather spend an extra $10 – 15 than run him off with a bad offer.) Someone else was selling 11 games and a console for $75. I wanted 8 games from him, but he wouldn’t split. All or nothing. I took it, figuring I could get $100 of those items, as well. I spent $135 purchasing 19 video games and a console. Of the 16 games I listed on Amazon, 10 sold that night. I paid for the $135 I spent, as well as the cost of shipping them all. Two days later, I sold the remainder (including the 3 crappy games and the console on Craigslist) and I came out $200 ahead when all was said and done.

Moral of the story: make informed purchases, and play it smart.

* Don’t spend more money purchasing items than you’ve made selling items. If you buy a bunch of duds, the worst that will happen will be that you break even.

* Please be safe when meeting people from Craigslist. Most people are normal people like ~~me or~~ you, but there are some crazies out there. Meet in a public place, if possible. If they insist on meeting at their home (some do), go during the daylight. Don't go inside. Don't knock on the door if something seems off. Just call off the deal. Making $20 here and there isn't worth your well-being.

* I haven’t used [these](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000DT8CZS/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=ghg7584jr-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B000DT8CZS) yet, as I’m still waiting for them to arrive, but here are some bubble mailers I ordered for when my other envelopes run out. ([non-ref](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000DT8CZS))

---------------------------------

I went to a used game store today and found 4 games that were cheaper in the store than on Amazon. I listed them an hour or so ago. While typing this post, one sold. Time to pack it up!

I know that this post was kind of scattershot, but it should get you started. Please don’t hesitate to ask questions.


---------------------------------

**Amazon's Affiliate Program**

The [Amazon Affiliate Program](https://affiliate-program.amazon.com/) is a way to refer shoppers to Amazon and earn a cut of the profit from their purchases. The only issue I had when signing up for this program was that I don't have a website, which they require. It was only after giving up and trying again that I realized that I could just list my Twitter page as my website.

When you sign up, Amazon adds a little toolbar (on the website, not your browser) that gives you the option to generate links to Amazon pages with your referral code in them. Do you have a blog where you occasionally mention items and link to a site for people to purchase them? Now you can use your Affiliate links to get some extra money.

Everything about this process is simple, with the exception of creating a popular blog. This method is ideal for people who have an existing site, but you can make a few bucks here or there with a successful link.

There are two distinct ways I achieve this monthly income, through active and passive methods. I'm going to go through the active methods first, and then the passive.
___________________________________________________________________________
**Active Methods**

   *Swagbucks*  - [Sign up](http://www.swagbucks.com/refer/jtpavlock)

   &gt;In this guide, I am going to split Swagbucks into both an active and a passive method of making money. First on my list, is the active side of Swagbucks. To get the most out of redeeming your Swagbucks, spend them on a $5 Amazon gift card. This will cost you 450 points each, but is the most efficient use of your points. 

   * Daily Poll - Everyday, Swagbucks has a new poll that can be completed for **1 point**. Each poll consists of one question and takes a max of 5 sec to complete.
   * NOSO - No Obligation Special Offers, like the Daily Poll, are offered daily and will grant you **2 points**. All you have to do is skip through the offers and you will be awarded your points at the end. 
   * Swag Codes - Every now and then, Swagbucks will release a swag code that you can redeem for around **10 points**. The guys over at http://sc-s.com/ keep track of when these codes come out and you can choose to have them email or text you every time there is a new one. 
   * Searches - Just use the search functionality 3-5 times with legit searches (not random letters) and you will be rewarded with usually around **5-15 points**. This amount doubles on Fridays as well.
 
  **Total**: ~10-20 Swag Bucks **Time**: ~5 minutes


*Amazon Mechanical Turk (mTurk)* - [Sign up](https://www.mturk.com/mturk/welcome?match=true)
 &gt; mTurk accounts for the majority of my income. However, it is also the one i spend the most time on. If I dedicate a little under an hour each day, I can usually make around 5 dollars. To sign up, they will need to validate your account, this will usually take between two days and a week. However, once you are validated, you can begin doing HITs and earning cash. 

* Finding HITs - Head over to /r/hitsworthtukingfor to find good HITs that are worth your time. Also, a good way to search for quality HITs is to set up a search that includes surveys, pays out at least $0.25, and is one which you are qualified for. I have that exact search template bookmarked so that I can quickly open it up and search for a HIT. A general rule of thumb I follow is that if the payout isn't at least $0.10/minute, the HIT isn't worth it. 

* Turkopticon - Make sure to download the extension [Turkopticon](http://turkopticon.differenceengines.com/) to weed out shady employers. The extension works for both Firefox and Chrome, and will let you see reviews for the person offering the HIT. 

   **Total**: ~$5  **Time**: ~50-60 minutes

----------------------------------------------------
**Passive Methods**

*Swagbucks* - [Sign up](http://www.swagbucks.com/refer/jtpavlock)
 &gt; Now I am going to go over the passive side of Swagbucks. This side is focused around Swagbucks TV, both the web and mobile versions, which can earn you **200 points** a day if you play your cards right.

* Swagbucks TV (web) - Before, you were able to click on a video, and have an auto page refresher refresh that same video until you hit the daily limit of points (150). However, new updates prevent this, as you will only be credited for viewing a specific video once a day. The way I've gotten around this is by using an auto clicker. I use one called [Auto Mouse Click](http://www.murgee.com/auto-mouse-click/) On the site there is a tutorial and a download link. I also have made a tutorial photo where I included the settings I use for it [here](http://i.imgur.com/yx90n.png). Make sure you open Swagbucks TV through the toolbar so it opens up in a nice new compact window (also prevents captchas from appearing). You can then move the window to the side of your screen and assign the clicks accordingly. [Here's](http://i.imgur.com/gWUXc.png) a picture of what my screen usually looks like so you can get an idea of what I mean. I just leave the Swagbucks TV window open on the right side of the screen with the program running, and I use my computer normally on the left side. The web version of Swagbucks TV will grant you **3 points** per every 10 videos that you watch. Maxing out at a daily total of 150 points.


* Swagbucks TV (mobile) - You can download the app for android [here](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.swagbuckstvmobile.views&amp;feature=search_result#?t=W251bGwsMSwyLDEsImNvbS5zd2FnYnVja3N0dm1vYmlsZS52aWV3cyJd). Or, if you don't have an android, you can run an emulator for windows like [Bluestacks](http://bluestacks.com/) and run the app from your computer. The app, unlike the web version of Swagbucks TV, flips through videos automatically. However, you will have to pay attention to the app since you will occasionally be forced to close out of an ad. A little trick if you are running an emulator on the computer: move the progress bar in the app window to be right under the task bar. This will require you to have a transparent task bar, so if you don't [here](http://www.ehow.com/how_8155080_change-taskbars-transparency-windows-7.html) is a guide for Windows 7 on how to change it. Also [Here's](http://i.imgur.com/gWUXc.png) a picture of what I mean. Notice the progress bar of the app at the bottom. If you notice the bar has gone black of missing, there is most likely an ad that you need to exit out of. The mobile version of Swagbucks TV will grant you **2 points** per every 5 videos, and will max out daily at 50 points. I recommend going to the ""comedy"" section of the app since most of the videos there are around 30 seconds.

 **Total**: 200 Swag bucks  **Time**: ~5 minutes (maintenance)


*PollBuzzer* - [Sign up](http://pollbuzzer.com/?r=lG4LCEy3W2E8RlhXdWEjEQ%3d%3d)
 &gt; Pollbuzzer is not completely passive, but only requires a minute or two each month. Basically, you sign up for the site and they will send you a poll via email once or twice each month. The polls are extremely easy and **$1** will automatically be transferred to your paypal account every time you complete one.

 **Total**: $.07 (average) **Time**: 4 seconds (average)

--------------------------------------------------------------
And there you have it, using this method, I am able to net around $200 every month while investing just an hour each day. $150 of that is in cash from mTurk, while the rest is in $50 worth of Amazon gift cards from Swagbucks. If you want to go over an hour a day to make even more every month, I would recommend just dumping all of that time into mTurk. That seems to be the most efficient way to make money after the daily points and limits for Swagbucks have been achieved. I've tried other sites such as NatureBucks and Superpoints, but neither have proven to be a useful consumption of my time. 

(Note: I don't use Topline since I can't run adblock and Topline at the same time. This is a problem since if adblock is disabled, ads will run on the Swagbucks TV (web) version and will interfere with the auto-click timers)",,False,,t5_2s5or,1348542896.0,,,True,t3_10fal2,http://www.reddit.com/r/beermoney/comments/10fal2/guide_how_to_make_200_a_month/,

(~30minutes a day),134,51,32,http://www.reddit.com/r/beermoney/comments/119wvs/a_beginners_guide_to_earning_casually_daily/,"As a college student, I am constantly short on cash. Instead of relinquishing my free time in order to pay for my habit, I have devised a daily ritual that I do while watching TV every day. This cycle typically takes me about 30 minutes, depending on several variables which will be discussed in more detail later. The net result is about 5$ a day. This is the bare minimum I will make. If you devote more time you can easily make 10$+. This doesn’t seem like hitting the jackpot, but at the end of the month, you’ll notice that extra cash. Now, having said that, here are my methods:

*Note: Make a PayPal account if you do not already have one and link it to your checking account if you can. Additionally, Create a new gmail account. One specifically for this purpose, you can use this to sign up for offers without flooding your mail account. Additionally, creating facebook is advisable. This will allow you to sign in to all the sites I mention. (Create a new one if you already have a facebook, these applications want you to spam their info and your friends will hate you.) Finally, you may want to download a different web browser than the one you currently use in order to install website toolbars.

1. **I vist Jebbit and do any available campaigns**. –[Ref](http://www.jebbit.com?ref=9470)/[NonRef](http://www.jebbit.com) This site requires that you either have a “.edu” e-mail to login, or sign up through facebook. Jebbit launches “campaigns” which you have the opportunity to participate in. These campaigns require you to view a website (typically a product) and answer a simple question. These questions require about 10 seconds of scanning to answer (think “how much does this product weigh?”). Each campaign may have between 3-5 questions each awarding anywhere from 0.10$-0.50$. This is easy money, but there is a limiting factor; the rate at which campaigns are launched. I was able to make 7.00$ my first day, however, I made only 3.00$ the following 4. They offer the ability to email alert you when 5.00$ worth of campaigns are ready (which may only take you 10 minutes to complete them all). I check this website every day. They payout through WePay (identical to PayPal) with a minimum withdraw of 2.00$ You can link your WePay account to directly deposit this into a checking account.

2. **I visit Superpoints and use the “superlucky button”** – [Ref](http://superpoints.com/refer/rasheemhashmir)/[NonRef](http://superpoints.com) Superpoints is a website that will reward you for doing anything from completing offers (remember to use that new e-mail) to watching videos or taking surveys. I find that my active attention is better spent on other sites, however, I do log on here just to use the “Superlucky Button”. Upon activating your account and completing your profile, you will be allowed 30 clicks a day. From these clicks, you can earn 1-25+ superpoints. Upon accumulating 1336 points, you can cashout with a 10$ paypal payment. Is this something you’re going to earn overnight? No. It takes me about 5 minutes to click through the button 30 times. If you want to utilize this website further, I read a [good guide](http://www.reddit.com/r/beermoney/comments/thj1f/the_most_comprehensive_and_detailed_superpoints/) on how to cash out big, fast. 

3. **I visit gifthulk open the treasure chest, complete the daily poll and do a few searches** – [Ref](http://www.gifthulk.com/refer/rasheem_hashmir)/[NonRef](http://www.gifthulk.com). This site works identical to superpoints with all the same ways of earning credits. I would recommend you download the toolbar. I am a native chrome user but I install toolbars to Firefox and use that as my primary browser while doing this method. Upon signing up, you are granted 5 free permanent keys. These keys represent your opportunity to open a prize chest daily which works similarly to the “Superlucky Button” we saw at Superpoints. In addition to opening the chest, I will participate in the daily poll which awards a single coin per day. Finally, I will throw a few searches into the toolbar. Make sure these searches are quality, you will agree to a disclaimer that states nonsensical searches or searches similar in keywords spammed will result in flagging. You will usually get a hit within 3-4 searches and it typically comes in around 6-10 coins, bonus keys or even giftcards. If you find you like the interface, try out some of the other ways of earning. A 5$ PayPal payment costs 599 coins.

4.**I head to SwagBucks and complete the daily poll, the NOSO, check in to the toolbar and do a few searches** [Ref](http://www.swagbucks.com/refer/Rasheem1)/[NonRef](http://www.swagbucks.com). This is a very well known site and is very reliable with payouts. The currency is “Swag Bucks” often shortened to SB. You can cash out with a 5$ PayPal payment for 700SB. I would suggest you download the toolbar in order to streamline your daily routine. I begin by completing the daily poll, this awards 1 SB a day. Afterwards, I click through the NOSO (No obligation special offer). You begin by clicking “Start earning now” and will be bombarded by offers. Skip every single one. At the end of the tunnel of offers you will be awarded 2 SB. Now I’ll do searches in the bar. I abide by the same rules as with GiftHulk, quality searches. I usually win 2-3 times a day and get between 3-10 SB each time. There are countless other ways of earning bucks: streaming video, completing surveys, finishing offers. I will complete a survey or an offer to cap on the daily bonus, but I find that other sites handle task payout better. Here is a [more detailed guide](http://www.reddit.com/r/beermoney/comments/103f7h/heard_of_swagbucks_but_havent_tried_it_yet_read/) if you’re interested in putting more time into this site. 

5. **I head to bing rewards and complete the daily offer and 15 searches**. [Ref](http://go.microsoft.com/?linkid=9778718&amp;rrid=_41618ba0-35a5-e5eb-300d-462f43ea28d1)/[NonRef](http://www.discoverbing.com/rewards/web?FORM=MRWHPG&amp;PUBL=Google_WEBREWARDS&amp;CREA=userid1743go1749C243ZQLFsvFhS29yq9OfY9VRzOiDAn1). First I go to the daily offer, just one click and This awards a single credit. 30 searches in the bing engine will result in an additional 15 credits a day. At 200 points you achieve silver status and get a free +50 points. At 750 credits you achieve gold status which will reward you with 10% off all redemptions, 5% off Microsoft points and 5% off Xbox Gold memberships. If you play Xbox Live this is definitely worth achieving. At 525 (475 for gold) credits you can cash out with an Amazon 5$ gift card. 


**The whole time im doing this, I have topline running.**[Ref](https://www.jointopline.com/?fid=6S5BW875YYZP)/[Non-Ref](http://www.jointopline.com/): This is passive earning at its finest; a chrome/firefox extension. Once installed, Topline replaces web ads with ads that have registered with their system. For each ads you see, you are credited. If you're willing to part with your beloved adblock, this utility can net you 5-10$ a month depending on how heavily you browse the web and to what sites you navigate. Be warned, use of auto refreshing utilities has resulted in bans.

**If you want to supplement this daily routine, I suggest using Amazon Mechanical Turk.** [Non-Ref](http://www.mturk.com/) (You could use GiftHulk or SwagBucks more extensively, but I feel this is the best earner). This is a website where requesters give cash rewards for completing Human Intelligence Tasks (HITs). These HITs can be anything from a written review to a survey and their payout ranges significantly. Typically, you want to do tasks that pay at least 0.10$/1minute. In order to find these well paying HITs, I subscribe to r/hitsworthturkingfor. In this subreddit, users post links to well paying HITs. They will post the name of the Requestor, the title of the hit, the region it applies to and any qualifications you may need. Additionally, a poster may mention a “High TO” this refers to a browser extension called [TurkOpticon](http://turkopticon.differenceengines.com/). This extension will display a window when hovering over the requesters name while on the Turk website. This window contains reviews from other users which can flag you of potential scams. I can make 4-5$ an hour using this method. Some days you will find very generous HITs, I have personally completed one with a 9$ payout for just under 10 minutes of work. You will have to create an Amazon Payments account in order to receive your money; however, you will have the option to link to your checking account to receive direct deposit. The Minimum withdraw is ~~15$~~.**Edit: 10$**

I hope you guys draw as much benefit from this as I have. While it is not exactly entire financial freedom, it is easy and repeatable every day. If you have any questions, I will answer them to the best of my ability. Thanks for your time guys.

1373776881.0,80,self.beermoney,1i9d3f,How to earn ~50 bucks on Amazon each moth via SwagBucks,95,15,43,http://www.reddit.com/r/beermoney/comments/1i9d3f/how_to_earn_50_bucks_on_amazon_each_moth_via/,"Hi Guys. I wanted to make a quick guide on Swagbucks (SB) to show how to put forth minimal effort and still earn around $50.00 a month. By no means is this maximum you can earn. I’m sure many make more than this, but for many of you that are just starting out, this guide might be extremely helpful. Some Pre-requirements for this guide:

• Tablet/Mobile Device with the Swagbucks Mobile App.
• Swagbucks Toolbar installed (I’d install it on a browser you do not use. Do this for two reasons, so it doesn’t mess up your defaults on your main browser, and so you can mute the browser completely so you do not hear SB videos.)
• Optional: Multiple Monitors and/or another computer. Screen space is very helpful in earning more SB in a quicker amount of time. You can do many of these offers simultaneously with more screen space.
• Amazon account will be required.

Currently, Amazon has the best deal for gift cards in my opinion. You can get $5.00 gift cards for 450 SB. I believe there's a max of doing 5 of these a month. In order to earn ~50 bucks in Amazon Gift cards each month, you MUST get the daily goal every single day. Daily goals typically range from 60 SB to 130 SB.  A full month earns the user 300 SB + a month of daily bonuses, which averages out to be another ~280-300 swagbucks typically. This is not difficult to achieve.  They are typically credited to your account by the 5th of each month.  Below is what a typical day should look like. I earn around 120-130 SB every single day using the method below.

1. Complete the NOSO/Daily Poll/Toolbar. +4 SB.
2. Turn on your mobile device, and log into SwagBucks Mobile. Start watching the videos. Every 5 videos earns you 2 SB and you can earn a maximum of 50 per day. You don’t necessarily have to watch the videos, but every now and then, you might have to click out of an ad to progress to the next video. +50 SB.
3. Open up two tabs, with both of them on Swagbucks. The first tab hit the SBTV widget from the SB toolbar and begin watching Swagbucks TV. It will open in a small widget that’s easier to manage than the full Swagbucks TV section. Every 10 videos you watch will earn you 3 SB after entering a captcha. I do this indefinitely while I’m on my computer. You only need watch a portion of most videos. Usually you do not have to watch any more than 30 seconds of any video. I’ll typically earn ~21 SB a day doing these. +21SB.
4. On the second tab, you are going to begin searching via the swagbucks toolbar. You should search random terms at a consistent rate. After a few searches you should get a pop up saying “Congratulations! You’ve won X Swag Bucks”. After earning one of these search rewards, stop searching for 4-5 hours, then rinse/repeat. I typically get 3-4 search rewards a day. They usually range from 7 SB- 12 SB, but occasionally I have gotten ~20 SB, and one time I received 40 SB. On sverage this earns me ~25 SB a day. +25 SB
5. After searching, go back to the home page. There will be offers that you can do that will award you SB. Ignore the ones that require you to put in credit card information. Pay attention mostly to the ones titled “Encrave”. These ones will earn you anywhere from 1-4 SB per offer. Encrave typically has multiple offers throughout the day. Some are just watching videos, and others simply require you to hold your mouse over the page for some amount of time. These are often overlooked but I typically earn ~25-35 SB at least from these each day. If you don’t see any on the home page, hit the inbox, and sometimes they will be on the banner above the inbox, sort of like an ad. +25 SB
6. Visit SC-S.com periodically to find swagcodes that are worth more SB. I believe you can get these texted to you as well. These are usually random, but you can check Swagbucks as there are days where they run codes the entirety of the day. I’d guestimate that I earn close to 70 SB a month in swagcodes. 
7. Check the inbox periodically. They send out offers sometimes that can be worth SB. I earn around 70  SB a month for swagcodes.

The more screen space you have, the more windows/tabs you can have open, earning SB. Doing the math for steps 1-5 earns you 125 SB a day on average. Keep in mind that you need to earn a bit more if the daily is 130 SB. 125 SB a day equates to for a 31 day month. Add in monthly bonuses of 300 SB and 300 SB, you are at 4475. Add in monthly inbox/swagcodes, and the grand total comes in at approximately 4615 SB. Assuming a 30 day month, this will be just under 4500 SB earned for that month. Spending a bit more time would get you past that 4500 SB mark.  4500 SB easily gets you 40-45 a month, if you put forth a small amounts of extra effort, you can earn 50 a month.

Note: This guide does not address surveys and other “special offers” because I personally haven’t had a great deal of luck or consistency with any of them. I recognize that some do work, but I prefer to use them. Feel free to do them to earn additional SB.


Thanks for reading. I hope you enjoy the guide. It's pretty straightforward, but I think some people don't realize the earning potential If you haven't joined Swagbucks yet, you can join via the following link:

1349392754.0,82,self.beermoney,10ypaj,I made about $200 in September through Fiverr and should make closer to $500 in October.  Let me show you how to get started,107,25,67,http://www.reddit.com/r/beermoney/comments/10ypaj/i_made_about_200_in_september_through_fiverr_and/,"Ok, let's talk about a Fiverr.  More specifically how to ""sell traffic"".

Fiverr is a place where people pay to get services for $5. The seller actually gets $4 of that (minus paypal fees) and can cash out the 4$ 2 weeks after a job is completed. $4 may not seem much but the biggest value I find with fiverr is that it's a good way to get new clients. They buy a couple gigs for $5 and if you do a good job some will start paying you directly and cutting out the middleman(fiverr). So even if Fiverr went away I am still in business.  Or you can just stick to doing fiverr gigs.

You can sell whatever(legal) service you want for $5 but remember that you really don't want to be spending very much time on each gig. I try and keep it to 15 minutes of actual work per gig. But when you make a new one it will take a bit of time before you streamline it so don't be discouraged if it takes longer at first.

So here is a great method for making Fiverr cash:

Step 1: Earn traffic by having your computer autosurf websites
Step 2: Sell this traffic on Fiverr
Step 3: Profit

Seems simple enough but I will explain things that have taken me a long time to learn and I have not seen talked about anywhere.

Step 1:  Earning traffic.  Autosurf sites allow you to login and have you computer automatically surf other peoples sites.  You get credits for sites surfed.  You can use those credits to get traffic on your own sites(or your fiverr customers).  There are hundreds of these sites but only a few good ones.  It is usually not a 1:1 ratio, that way the autosurf site has extra credits leftover that they sell.

You can pretty much set it and forget it (though it's good to check on it once a day because sometimes it will get stuck.) You can run it while you sleep or run it on a spare machine or run it on a VM like I do. If you want to expand from there you just need more IP addresses. I used to run 4 virtual machines at a time each with their own IP and could pump out enough credits to get people thousands of views daily. If I got too many sales I would just buy a few credits and was still making a nice profit.

The best site out the is Hitleap.  It counts credits by ""minute""  so you can send people to your site for 5 seconds up to 60.  Depending on what you need.

Referral Link:  http://hitleap.com/by/Shonnaxe8

Non Referral Link:  http://hitleap.com


Step 2:  Selling the traffic.  After earning (or buying) a bunch of credits you need to decide how you are going to sell the traffic.  Just selling tons of traffic is not really that popular in Fiverr, so it's all in how you package it. For example you could sell Youtube views.  Put in the youtube link into Hitleap and send traffic to it.  Or you could sell Soundcloud plays.  Or Instagram views.  Someone would rather have more Youtube views, or ""Blog Visits"" than just plain traffic.  Find a way to sell it to them.  It helps if whatever site you are sending traffic to has a public ""counter"" like youtube.

The easiest sell if for sites that reward you for having more views etc.  Part of youtube rankings have to do with how fast they are getting views.  So it can help them get more legitimate views.  People mostly understand they are not ""real"" visits but they want to get on the ""popular videos"" list and things like that.  Also people like having bragging rights ""Dude my picture got 800 views!"".

Keep in mind it's never a 1 to 1 ratio. Youtube for example likes to wait a bit before showing all of the views and they don't really count every single one. So test it before you make a fiverr gig.

Step 3: Profit.  You have to wait a bit to get your fiverr money but you can get some customers to buy a better deal directly through paypal and you can get your money right away(I have a paypal debit card so that's nice).  It's against Fiverr rules to do this technically but I just hit them up on Youtube or Soundcloud or whatever site and see if they are interested.

Be creative there are a ton of ways to make money with this site alone. If I get a positive response maybe I will regularly give out some ideas. I have been self employed for 5 months now and I want to start helping other people (also the referrals really help me LOL).

Edit:  there seems to be some confusion on a few things so I will update this edit with some more detail when I can.  Either tonight or tomorrow.  Thanks everyone and ask any questions you want

Edit 2 :  Sounds like I have most of the preliminary questions out of the way.  I will make another post where I go into detail on the Fiverr part of it, but I won't really have time today.

If a site has a really good referral system, that money MUST come out of your paycheck.  More serious moneymaking methods usually either don't have a referral system, or have a shitty one.  This gives people no reason to talk about them on a forum like this, but a quick google will find literally everything I'm about to post.  Thousands and thousands of pages devoted to it in some cases.  
  
**easiest earner:** Blogging/My Website  
  
&gt;You don't need to blog about yourself.  You need to blog about something you can publicize.  I have a big Pinterest following, so I blog DIY stuff.  Then I drive traffic manually, and only rank for a few obscure keywords. The end game is ranking for a less obscure keyword and getting a LOT of traffic.  You can check me out at [creatorsocial.com](http://creatorsocial.com)  
  
**How to Monetize:**  
1. Make an Adsense Account  
2. Make an Amazon Affiliate Account  
3. Be on either Blogger, or your own Hosting plan  
  

Wordpress will not allow on-site advertising.  So don't get all excited about setting up a blog there.  I am using the wordpress CMS on personal hosting. (PS- get linux hosting, just do it.  Windows hosting makes everything difficult and expensive.  If you get an unlimited plan, you can share with other users and host multiple sites on one plan)  
  
&gt;**Similar Methods: Hubpages or Squidoo writing.**

I like Hubpages better by far, so since they are extremely similar I will introduce only Hubpages. You can check out a get-started guide [here](http://hubpages.com/_writingforcash/faq/#royalties)/[non](http://hubpages.com/faq/#royalties). Using my ref link does extremely little and doesn't really make me any noticeable amount of money.  I like it when people use my ref links to HP because I enjoy seeing their writing and trying to help them out a bit from the shadows.  You can find me on Hubpages under this same name.     
  
Pros and Cons Comparison: “hubbing” vs “blogging.”
  

    hubpages|blogging|
    :---|---:
    pays per view|pays per ad click
    sets up everything for you in template|you must set things up yourself
easier SEO|harder SEO
will help you get amazon and eBay affiliate|you must try these alone  
cash out at $50|cash out at $100
    more difficult to get started|easier to get started  
hard to ""level up"" onto your own website | easy to move to your own domain and hosting when ready

  
&gt;I know I said Hubpages gives you more help than Blogging, but with blogging you can just sit down and write.  With hubbing you have a lot of stuff to set up before beginning. So people often get discouraged and don't even make it to their first article. 
  
However, if you don’t understand the difference between wordpress.com vs wordpress.org vs your template vs your admin interface, or buying your own domain vs hosting your own website, take the time to read up before you dive into anything more intense than an  (A)free blog or (B)hubpages account.  Don’t make the newbie mistakes like I did (stupid freaking Windows hosting- useless).
  

  
&gt;I make about $2 per day passively on Hubpages/eBay affiliate, and about $2 per day on Blogging/Amazon affiliate.  (I signed up for Amazon affiliate through Hubpages but never sold through there, moved the ads to my website where they do better)  
  
*********************************  
*********************************
The no-wait big earner, pay-out min $10:  
  **Textbroker**  
  
1. sign up  
2. send a writing sample  
3. get graded  
4. complete any assignments open to your grade-level  
  
It's like MTurk only it's JUST writing and it pays more. Most people are placed at 3 to start.  You can move up or down after your first 5 assignments when they re-grade you.  After that they check you every 60 articles or so.  
  
Pay Rates : http://www.textbroker.com/us/author-rates.php  
  
There’s no ref system because the money goes straight to you. No games, just writing.  It’s possible to make a full-time wage using this site, and many do. 
  
I am extremely lazy about Textbroker.  I prefer to build passive income, rather than take the instant gratification (well, instant is Friday in this case).  I generally write about 1 article per day, so I average $7 per day.  However, when I needed to pay a bill by month’s end or wanted a quick influx into Paypal, I’ve been known to crank out over $50 worth of content in a day.  
  

    Pros|Cons|
    :---|---:
    low payout|requires paypal
    easy to find work|must send a billion ID proofs
very professional|very professional
will review your writing and help you improve|sooo nitpicky, mind your commas and that/which etc
no games|if you don't like writing- just don't try it    
  
Textbroker may or may not be open to non-US citizens.  I know there is at least a UK version, and some assignments ask you to use ""Australian"" English or similar, so I would hope it's at least open to other English-speaking countries.

**************************************  
**Fiverr** I am still a beginner at this one, so I can't give too much advice.  Just remember that you, the seller, only really gets $4 of the 5 that the buyer pays.  It's a great place for weird services.  
  
You should basically sign up for Fiverr if you've ever thought...  
&gt;Hey, I have this skill/product that people would pay for, but I don't know how to market it.  
  
For example, I'm a member of some Pinterest boards totaling over 200k followers.  So on fiverr I offer to promote someone's website to them like so: [You may sense a pattern to my usernames...](http://fiverr.com/tealparadise/pin-your-diy-site-to-170000-real-niche-followers)  
  
If you can send a postcard from a weird location, make a video with a product placement, feature someone on a high-traffic blog, or really anything at all, give it a go.  **Listing is FREE**, which is the main reason I rec it.  It doesn't hurt to try.  I've made about $12 so far for doing something I do all day anyway.  
 ***************************************
***************************************  
  
**Web Answers** 
  
This is the only site I use which is a real ""beer money"" site.  I get about $2 per day average.  Up to $5 when I actually use the site, down to $0.50 when I haven't logged in for a few days.  It's ""passive"" income, but it scales based on your activity on-site.  Tricky tricky.  I have already posted about Webanswers [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/beermoney/comments/1eom7w/in_celebration_of_webanswers_being_back_up_some/) and [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/beermoney/comments/1aia29/i_swear_i_searched_couldnt_find_a_post_about/) so I won't bore you.  
  
If you are using Adsense (not on the Hubpages platform) you have a minimum $100 cash out.  So if you want to see money fast, you end up tacking on tons of little ""extra"" earners like Web Answers and other rev share sites.  Plus, I just really like WA. It's fun.
*************************************** 
  Summary:

1352215490.0,80,self.beermoney,12qd7e,Ever think about starting a vending machine route to make some easy residual income? Here is my experience:,111,31,31,http://www.reddit.com/r/beermoney/comments/12qd7e/ever_think_about_starting_a_vending_machine_route/,"[I started a small candy vending machine route](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxKiBme9KNs)  I placed machines in five different businesses in my town.  Even though it only brought in about 50 bucks a month, it was still worth it to me because 1) I made 50 bucks a month.  And 2) once the machines were placed in a business their resell value goes way up.  (A placed machine is worth a lot more than an unplaced machine.)  So I made money when I sold out as well. The above video explains more about how I did it, and what I learned. 

Another idea you might be interested in is while i was in High School [I started my own curb painting business](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0LJj-3X9UkQ).  It was fun, and kept me entertained for awhile. It was pretty cheap to start up.  &lt;$100.   And on days that I stayed busy I probably made 20-30 dollars an hour.  It was super hard work though.  I’m a relatively large guy, so bending down to curb level all day long got rough.  But the money was good.  This is a great supplemental income for someone in high school or college. 

This last one isn’t something I did, but more of a 'Man, that guy was thinking outside the box' idea. So almost every single web page on the internet has advertisements on it. This guy, who is actually a Redditor (and did an [AMAA](http://www.reddit.com/r/beermoney/comments/vgeuj/iama_cofounder_ceo_at_topline_amaa/) four months ago) wrote a program that replaces the ads you see on web-pages with ads that his business pays you to see. Its an interesting concept.  I calculated that If I spend an hour on the internet every day using his program, Ill end up making 20-30 dollars a year from his business.  [I show you an example in this video.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tz_iPMk0-YY)  But the awesome part is the guy who started the business is also making money off the ads I see. If his proportion of ad-sharing revenue is similar to Googles Adsense, then he will be making 15-20 dollars off of me during the year.  Talk about easy money.  Props to the creator of Topline.

[quirky](http://www.quirky.com/?r=f1b3bcf39dd0b2926ddfe827080c139e) or [nonref](http://www.quirky.com/participate) is a website that socializes product ideas and then manufactures the product. To explain that a bit more, members submit ideas and then other members vote on how the end product will actually turn out. This process includes voting on the design, the name, tagline, and the way it looks. quirky then manufactures it and sells it.

If you voted on an idea that wins, then you gain certain percentage of influence on the product. whatever that percentage is , that is what you earn every time that product is sold. for example, if you have 1% influence on a product that sells for $30, then you get .30 each time it is sold. it takes time to accumulate influence but it is completely passive income after you get that influence. you can get a lot more influence by actually submitting ideas for the product and to develop the product.

ive been doing this since december 2009 and i stopped going to the site for about a year. but after spending about 5 min a day voting and hoping that it wins, i'm getting about $75 every 3-4 months on just passive income. that amount is growing as i accumulate the number of products i have influence on. people make much more money than i do because they actually participate and give ideas.

referrals get you money by a 10% commission from a product bought by someone you referred.  i urge everyone whether they want use my referral link or not, or even if they dont want to sign up, to just check out the store. there are some very cool products on there. again its [quirky](http://www.quirky.com/?r=f1b3bcf39dd0b2926ddfe827080c139e) or [nonref](http://www.quirky.com/participate)

A while back I talked about how I was making money on Fiverr.  I got a lot of specific questions and people asking for examples so I am following up on that.  Let me give a real example of a Fiverr gig I did for a while.

[Example](http://i.imgur.com/dgguXrB.jpg)

How do I fulfill this order?  When someone buys this gig they send me a link to a soundcloud song.  [Like This totally random band](https://soundcloud.com/flume-1/sets/flume-out-now).  This is a link to their song.  On that song page there is a ""share"" button.  Click that and there is ""widget code"", next to that an icon to edit the widget.  Click on the ""play automatically"" check box and grab the widget code.  You can either pop that code on a website somewhere or pull out the actual link to the widget like this.  https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Fplaylists%2F2732853&amp;amp;color=ff6600&amp;amp;auto_play=true&amp;amp;show_artwork=true

Now you have a link that will automatically play the song.  Take it to a traffic exchange and enter the URL after you earn or buy some minutes. 

This is my favorite traffic exchange.  Referral Link: http://hitleap.com/by/Shonnaxe8 Non Referral Link: http://hitleap.com

I would set it to a random time visiting a site and no more than 40 visits an hour.  You will get someone their song plays in a couple days.  It helps them look more popular and gets them higher in the charts.

Just because a visit happens doesn't mean Soundcloud counts it.  If you think outside the box this can work for things like youtube.

1330796494.0,77,self.beermoney,qg2nv,Bady's Swagbucks Tutorial and Tips for Cashing out Regularly (+ Bluestacks tutorial for mobile SBTV),104,27,74,http://www.reddit.com/r/beermoney/comments/qg2nv/badys_swagbucks_tutorial_and_tips_for_cashing_out/,"After cashing out over $70 worth of Amazon giftcards in about a month and a half, I'm incredibly happy with Swagbucks. It is by far the most profitable GPT site I have ever participated in by a longshot. I decided to compile a not-so-short list of tips and tricks that I use every day while browsing the site to help share the wealth with new and old users. 

First of all, if you haven't signed up for Swagbucks yet, [here's a link](http://www.swagbucks.com/refer/TrevorTodd). Now onto the money-making.

___________________________________________________________________________


The biggest moneymaker by far, is Swagbucks TV (SBTV). You get **3 points after every 10 videos** you watch, up to a **maximum of 150 points per day**. The easiest way to do this is to get an auto-refreshing add-on for your browser (I use [TabMixPlus for Firefox](http://tmp.garyr.net/)) and set it to refresh every 50 seconds. I usually have it refresh videos like ""5 Interesting Facts About _________"" because those videos tend to be 50-60 seconds on average.

The second biggest moneymaker is the SBTV mobile app. You get **2 points for every 10 videos** you watch, up to a **maximum of 50 points per day**. If you have an android device, you can install it from the Android app store, but if you don't you can install the android app emulator [Bluestacks](http://download.cnet.com/BlueStacks-App-Player/3000-18513_4-75593133.html). Once you've installed Bluestacks, install [Gizmo Stack](http://www.gizmostack.co.uk/?q=index) which will enable you to run Bluestacks in windowed mode in the background. Once you've installed those, follow these steps in order to install the SBTV Mobile app.

&gt;1. Download the [SBTV Mobile app from here](http://bitshare.com/?f=mvvv25rw) and put it on your desktop.
&gt;
&gt;2. Navigate to *C:\Program Files (x86)\BlueStacks* and locate the *HD-ApkHandler.exe* file. Right click on it and select Send to &gt; Desktop (create shortcut)
&gt;
&gt;3. Go back to your desktop and drag the *com.swagbuckstvmobile.views-2.apk* file onto your newly created *HD-ApkHandler.exe* shortcut. It should bring up a message showing its installation.
&gt;
&gt;4. After it's finished, open up Bluestacks and the app should be on the second page. Log in and start watching videos to start earning points.
&gt;
&gt;Note: the videos will play automatically. I recommend playing videos from the Comedy Time playlist because these tend to be the shortest.

____________________________________________________________________________________


Now if you max out both of these every day, you'll be getting **200 Swagbucks per day**, which is enough to get a $5 Amazon gift card every 3 days. However, if you want to cash out faster, there are a ton of ways to pick up extra points all throughout the site. This is what I do:

* Always remember to to the Daily Poll **(1pt)** and the NOSO **(2pts)**. These are daily guaranteed points and while 3 points might not sound like a lot, if adds up quick. These can be found under the Earn menu at the top of every Swagbucks page.

* Check your messages daily. Every day they send out a quick video poll in a message titled ""Earn 3 Swagbucks Today"" It takes less than 5 seconds to complete and is another guaranteed **3 points per day**. They expire after 1 day though, so be sure to check every day. Most of the rest of the offers they send you via message aren't worth the time/money and can be ignored.

* Check the Gambit tab under the ""Special Offers"" section of the Earn menu. They have a video section that has anywhere from **0-20 videos a day** that you can watch for **1 point each**. This uses the same exact system that Superpoints uses for their videos, so you can check [**my post here**](http://www.reddit.com/r/beermoney/comments/p7drt/superpoints_video_tips_make_1sp_every_10_seconds/) if you're interested in how to get these points the fastest. **Edit:** Apparently this tab is either not available in Canada or is only available to users in the US.

* While in the Special Offers section, I usually quickly check the other tabs for video offers. They are usually categorized under Free or Videos and will be worth 1-3 points on average.

* Sometimes on Swagbucks' homepage, right above the recently earned section, there will be a link to a bonus video that you can watch for 2 points. Yesterday I was able to watch the video 3 times for a total of 6 points.

* Another way to make a couple of points is from their Games section of the Earn menu. Bring up any game, and then mute it and leave it open in another tab. Most games have a mute button on them somewhere if it has music that plays during the menu. ~~After about 20 minutes, go back to that tab and click the ""Back to Games"" link at the top of the page. The majority of the time a message will pop up at the top of the screen, awarding you **2 points**. I haven't tested this very much, so I don't know what the limit is here, but it's a low maintenance way of making a few extra points every day if you're desperate.~~

According to [sandysquirrel](http://swagbucks.com/refer/paintedwombat)

&gt;* ""You actually only have to wait about a minute, just like with SBTV before going back and hitting ""Back to Games"". Usually if you do it sooner it won't count. Every two games you play will give you two points, though if it's one of the shorter games like a lot of the word ones you won't get points until every three. There's a limit to ten points per day that you can get from games. ""


* Under the Trusted Surveys section of the Earn menu, there are a number of profiles you can fill out about yourself in order for Swagbucks to find more surveys for you. There are about **10-15 profiles** and you are given **2 points each** for completing them.

* If you have time, you should also try filling out a few of the surveys available to you. On average they are worth from **50-200 points** and take from **10-30 minutes to complete**. The majority of the time you will probably get disqualified, but if you aren't they pay quite well. I've gotten a few hundred points from doing surveys. Plus, even if you do get disqualified, Swagbucks gives you **one point per failed survey up to 5 every day**.

* Remember to search through their search engine multiple times per day. Winning at a search will usually give you around **7-13 points**, but I've seen wins up to 150 points before. After winning, there is generally a cool-down period of 4-6 hours before you can win again, and people generally only win **2-3 times per day**. Regardless, it is still a great way of earning points.

* If you have trouble remembering to search daily, change your bookmarks to swagbucks searches. Example: instead of linking to Facebook directly, link to the Swagbucks search of [Facebook](http://www.swagbucks.com/?t=w&amp;p=1&amp;b=0&amp;f=0&amp;q=facebook). It only adds an extra click to your normal routine, but it greatly increases your chance at winning.

* Set up text message alerts for Swag Codes. Swag Codes are special codes randomly given out by the Swagbucks team that give you free points just for entering them into the box on the homepage. They are usually worth from **3-16 points**, but can vary greatly. The best way to keep up with all the codes that are given out is to sign up for text alerts from [**Swag Code Spoiler**](http://sc-s.com/tools/text-alerts/). They use twitter to send you a message every time they post a code on their website. Most codes expire in an hour, so you want to get them as soon as possible.

* Use your wishlist! While this isn't a tip about getting points, it can help you with saving them. Add the items you're most likely to buy to your wishlist and take advantage of swagbucks' email notifications. While viewing your wishlist, check the box that says ""Price Change"" next to Email Alerts. This will send you an email whenever the price of the item changes, so you won't miss if something you want goes on sale.

And last but not least, always be on the lookout for people that you can refer to Swagbucks. When someone you refer to Swagbucks wins while searching, you win the same amount of points they do. While referrals on Swagbucks aren't as necessary as on sites like Superpoints, they can definitely help you rake in quite a bit if done correctly. I only have **2 active referrals**, but they have made me **over 700 points** so far. (The most being from tokarrai, whose referral link is [here](http://swagbucks.com/refer/tokarrai) if you want to help him out.) Remember though, you only get points from their searches, so be sure to properly educate your referrals about the search function of the site.

I'm Ronald Bell, Co-Founder and CEO at TopLine (www.jointopline.com). I've been a redditor for about 5 years and I read beermoney daily. Many of you have probably seen me around this subreddit. I usually answer TopLine-related questions and provide support to users.

TrumpetH4X asked me to do an AMA here a while back. I have some free time to answer questions this evening so I thought I'd start it up.

If you're a beermoney subscriber you're probably familiar with TopLine already. TopLine is a browser add-on for Firefox, Chrome and Safari. TopLine sits in the background as you browse the web, and replaces normal web ads with ads from the TopLine network. The incentive to the user is a revenue share. My favorite explanation of TopLine is the video on our website: http://www.jointopline.com/

I come from an iOS development background; most of my software development experience is related to iPhone apps. I started TopLine last November with my Co-Founder, Arthur Aivazian. We're located in downtown Los Angeles. We've received a lot of positive feedback from Beermoney since we launched, and we're happy to see so many users enjoying TopLine.

Feel free to ask me (almost) anything about our company, our product, our team, or even about myself.

Here's what has worked for me, let me know what's worked for you.",80,10,11,http://www.reddit.com/r/beermoney/comments/1915zq/ive_been_trying_to_make_beermoney_before_i_knew/,"Hi r/beermoney.  I've been trying to find ways to make money online for years now, but also in a way that doesn't substantially eat into my time.  Because of this I've tried most of the websites that are mentioned in this forum (many others as well), and here is what I've discovered through much trial and error.  

One way that doesn't seem to have been mentioned very much is [Justanswers](http://www.justanswer.com/professional).  There are many different categories that you can sign up for as an expert, and if you pass the subject test, you can start answering questions that people post for money.  Some people work on this website full time, so there is definitely a substantial amount of money to be made if you are accepted as an expert.  I personally have been working there for over a year now and my income has varied, but I do regularly make several hundred dollars a month.  It can be a grind, but it also has to be one of the most profitable work from home types of websites that I've come across.

Like most people here I also use swagbucks [Refer](http://www.swagbucks.com/refer/bugabugabuga) [Non-refer](http://www.swagbucks.com).  Unlike many people, I've found that watching videos and constantly clicking on crap to be too time consuming.  What has worked for me was changing my default browser to the swagbucks browser (very easy I can explain if necessary), and while their search engine isn't great, it does net me the equivalent of about 10-50 cents a day for doing something I would be doing anyway.  I do the daily poll, and the noso.  All of this takes very minimal time for me.  I accumulate the points and spend them on amazon gift cards.  Very easy.

Many years ago I signed up for one of these survey sites called SurveySavvy [refer](http://www.surveysavvy.com/?m=3036858) [non-refer](http://www.surveysavvy.com).  To my knowledge this is still one of the best survey sites in terms of making passive income from referrals.  The surveys themselves don't interest me too much, although I believe if you work in IT you'd receive much more profitable surveys than the ones they send me.  I acquired some referrals on a blog I had a few years ago, and these people are still filling out surveys which nets me about 50 cents per survey that they fill out.  I also make money on my referrals' referrals, although that has only happened to me once so far.  If you don't mind filling out surveys and you can get a few people under you to fill them out too, it's definitely possible to make some money, although the payout checks do take forever to be delivered.  I constantly get survey invitations from them, so there's no shortage of that.

Other than that I've tried just about everything out there with very limited success.  I've recently decided to try two new sites after reading about them here on reddit.  

I just signed up for an account at clixsense [refer](http://www.clixsense.com/?5153727) [non-refer](http://www.clixsense.com) which I understand is also one of the better sites similar to swagbucks.  It has been mentioned on reddit quite a bit, and seems to have a very good referral program.  If you have the patience to click on ads and watch videos etc, this is a reputable site to slave away your time for a few extra bucks.

One of the most intriguing sites I have found recently is quirky [non-refer](http://www.quirky.com/).  I can't find a referral link, so pm me and I'll send you one to your email if you're interested.  I can't tell if this is going to be a giant waste of time or not, but from what I understand it seems like you can vote and give input on new inventions, and if they make it all the way to creation you get a small percentage of passive income based on the units they sell.  Seems too good to be true, but people seem to have made money on it so I'm going to give it a try.  

That's what I've been up to.  I'd be interested in hearing any other ideas that aren't gigantic time sinks.  I keep seeing that people use mturk, but I can't rationalize spending so much time grinding it out for $5-$6 an hour.  I have newborn at home, so I'm trying to find some relatively easy ideas/websites that will generate a little extra cash flow.  I'm happy to use people's referral links, so please send them my way if you have a good site that hasn't been mentioned and isn't a scam or a total waste of time.  Thanks!

1355333361.0,72,self.beermoney,14qf9j,Scrap metal 101,82,10,45,http://www.reddit.com/r/beermoney/comments/14qf9j/scrap_metal_101/,"I've gotten a few good ideas from /r/beermoney so I decided to pay it forward and write a guide to scrap metal. You'll need a truck or a decent sized trailer. I paid $600 for a used trailer. It can haul about a ton which makes me about $100-$150 depending on what junk metal is going for. A good trailer is either an open or dump trailer. This will make unloading much easier.

**IDENTIFY A SCRAP YARD**


The most important step is locating a good scrap yard in your area that pays top dollar. Shop around to see who has the best prices. Look for something close so you don't spend a lot of money on gas. Some scrap yards try to take advantage of new people. If you want to test a scrap yard save up your aluminum cans. Weigh the cans before you go. If they are off by a lot you will know they are ripping you off.

**SORTING THE SCRAP FOR MAX PROFIT**


The best way to recycle is to reuse the product in its current form. If you can sell something out of your scrap steel pile for $15 you just made the same as scrapping 100 lbs. of metal.

While sorting you also want to look for things that are more valuable types of metals. For instance, an air conditioner has a radiator in it. This is mostly aluminum and copper. I rip these out and my scrap yard gives me a special price for these. Any appliances I find I cut the cords off and toss them in a bin. You could take the time to strip these (or burn them) but I just take them in and get a special price for coated copper wire. Any old steel is more valuable. This is due to the fact that it hasn't been recycled yet and is pure steel. Pure copper is the most valuable metal you will most likely come across. Invest in a good grinder. Cut off any fittings and sort them depending on if they are copper or brass fittings. Grind off any paint or solder that might be on the copper.


**SPECIFIC PRODUCTS TO LOOK FOR**


**Copper $3.00 - $4.00 lb.**

* Electric motors (around 0.20 -0.30 a lb. for these, even if rusty)
* Cable
* Electrical Wire (cars, computers, electronics)
* Plumbing

**Brass**

* Valves
* Plumbing

**Aluminum $0.50 lb.**

* Siding
* Boats
* Grill Lids
* Equipment Housings
* Cylinder Heads
* Machine Parts
* Gutters
* Lawn chairs
* Old Fences
* Patio Furniture
* Old Ladders
* Old Pots, Pans, Trays
* Certain tools
* Storm door and window frames
* Beverage cans
* Disposable cooking pans &amp; foil etc.

**Lead - price varies**

* Car Batteries ($5 a pop at my scrap yard)
* Old Computer Monitors (some places will charge you for these so make sure before you pick a bunch up)
	
**Scrap Steel - $10 - $15 (per 100 lb.)**

* Anything that is magnetic
* Furnaces
* Boilers
* Washers
* Dryers
* Stoves
* Refrigerators (must be empty of freon)

	
The price of scrap metal constantly changes. If you have the space you can store metal until prices go back up. Storing a bunch of scrap steel takes a lot of room so I just take this whenever I have a trailer full.  I sort my other metals in buckets and wait until prices are high. At first it might be tough for you to find sources of metal but as the word gets out people will start saving it for you. I have one guy who has a giant pit that he throws all his metal in. I stop by once a year and unload it for him. The first time I went I dug about 12 electric motors out of that pit. Another good source is college houses. College kids tend to buy beer in aluminum cans because it is cheaper. I stop by once every two months to collect and they normally have several bags of crushed cans waiting for me. 


The best way to make money doing this is to pair it with another profession. For instance, plumbers find a lot of copper and electricians find a lot of copper coated wire. I'm not skilled enough to do this so I use my trailer to help people clean out attics and basements. I charge them money for cleaning these out and estimate how much it will cost to dump. When I get home I pull any metal out and throw it on the pile.  Today I picked up a trailer load of trash for a guy. I charged him $30 for two hours of work (it didn't take me two hours to load the trailer but I factored in driving time) and $20 for dump fees. The dump fees were only about $10 so I made an extra $10 there. Included in the trash was some aluminum and scrap steel. I threw the aluminum on my dirty aluminum pile and loaded up a trailer full of scrap steel I already had. I took this and I made $106 at the scrap yard. So in total I made $146  and only worked about two and a half hours.

I've been doing this a couple years now but I'm not an expert. I'd love to hear ideas anyone else might have to make money with scrap metal. I'd also like to answer any questions people have so don't be shy!",,False,,t5_2s5or,1355334774.0,,,True,t3_14qf9j,http://www.reddit.com/r/beermoney/comments/14qf9j/scrap_metal_101/,

They added a wall of spam onto my google searches.

This is too much, I've uninstalled it.

I seriously thought I had a virus on my computer for a few minutes.

When another browser worked normally I grew suspicious of my extensions.

**Every Extension Disabled:**

**Every Extension Except Topline Disabled:**

To the Topline team:

Seriously what happened man?  You were such an innovative idea, I fell in loved with you right away.  I went from someone who would go out of my way to block every ad possible to finding new and interesting blogs via the ads.  I would refer all my friends to try out your awesome service.  Everything was amazing.

I even ignored the audio and video ads when you were testing them out, but this... This seems like a pure cash grab.

People use google everyday, you can't just stick a wall of ads on top of it.  If your going to make massive changes like this, at least don't do them silently.  So many of my extensions that update pop up a webpage explaining new features and changes.  To find out this way is absolutely disgusting.

A few years ago I had an 'oh shit' moment when my left leg mysteriously stopped working the way it should. It was lethargic, kinda dragged at times and running was suddenly an impossibility. Reluctantly, I knew it was time to see the doctor. Long story short I was told that the bones in my neck were somehow crushed and they were sawing through my spine. If I didn't have emergency surgery I would be paralyzed in a month. I was working at the time and was able to get short term disability which helped but it sure wasn't what I was making and I have a family to support. After the surgery (anterior cervical discectomy) I wasn't paralyzed....but they had paralyzed my right vocal chord. I couldn't hardly speak. My job needed me to be able to speak so I was going to be out longer than expected. 

The bills were piling up I was shitted. Then one day I noticed our neighbor was cleaning out his garage and he was setting stuff out at the curb. I swear I saw a guitar case. I scooped it up and brought it inside. When I opened the case inside was a sweet takamine acoustic guitar with electric pick ups. It was in kinda rough shape but I cleaned it up and ended up getting $100 bucks for it on craigslist. After that I was on a mission. 

I live in Charlotte NC and a few hours ago there was a listing under FREE for [sweet set of 8 gym lockers](http://charlotte.craigslist.org/zip/3424284903.html) If I had a truck I could easily score at the very least $100 just by selling them back on craigslist. Again just today there were 125 chairs the kind you might find in a diner all for free. If you wanted to dump them for $5 per you made a killing and could drink beer the rest of the week. 

They have free firewood all the time and the pieces are often small enough to load a trunk down if you don't have a truck. Sell it for $35 delivered. There are also all the time little things for free like end tables that you can dump quickly for $15-$20 depending on condition. You just have to kind of all the time check the free stuff on craigslist. Maybe cruise some nice neighborhoods on trash night. Apartment complexes the end of the month where people move in a hurry and just dump half their belongings. 

I hope you get the picture I could go on and on but I really hope it helps someone score some extra cash the way it did me.

1359046897.0,65,self.beermoney,1774dg,My big list of money-making on IOS (some on android),76,11,25,http://www.reddit.com/r/beermoney/comments/1774dg/my_big_list_of_moneymaking_on_ios_some_on_android/,"Hello, today my fellow beer money redditors I present you with my list of all the apps I use on my iPod to make some dough. This list will be mostly services that pay to install apps. If you use all these services in conjunction with each other every time you install an app then you can earn way more money per app then if you used them separately. 

1.**Free My Apps**:
One of the better apps out there, although there sometimes aren't many apps available for downloads payouts are usually high. There's ussually an app every few days ussually worth around 200 points although I did see an app worth 600 once (a two dollar amazon card). The rewards are incremental so there's no trouble at cashing out at 2 dollars amazon, every dollar is equivalent to 300 points.
Go-to the link on your IOS device's web browser or search free my apps on the google play store for android to install the app


[Referal](http://m.freemyapps.com/share/email/3eccd887)  [Non ref](http://m.freemyapps.com) 


2.**Feature points**: Decently high paying app, has many more offers than Free my apps. Average pay per app install is 90 points where 600 points are equivalent to a 1$ amazon gift card. The rewards go up by identical increments so no harm at cashing out at a dollar although rewards range from itunes cards, up to 100 dollars amazon, up to 100 dollars paypal and many apps. To install simply navigate to the feature points link in your device's web browser.

[ref](https://featurepoints.com/r/TJTEDR) or enter the ref code TJTEDR in the app [non-ref](https://featurepoints.com)

3.**App nana's**: very similar to feature points except it sometimes has more apps and offers. The rewards however do not go up by even increments ex. 1$ amazon is 30,000 2$ is 45,000 so the higher you cash out at the greater value. Rewards include amazon gift cards up to 50 dollars as well as itunes cards and apps. The typical reward per app is 2000 points although there is a multitude that pay less that aren't really worth the trouble but the 2000 point ones pop up every few days. As with the others simply navigate to the link in your devices web browser.

[link](http://www.appnana.com) Input the invite code a204585 for an extra 2500 points right off the bat.

4.**App Casher**: very similar to feature points. Apps typically pay out 200 points and it takes 2000 for a two dollar card, so not as great a value as the other programs but if you use it in conjunction with the other ones for every app you install then it's just extra money in your pocket. Rewards aren't as varied as in the other rewards programs but they include 2$,5$ and 10$ Amazon and 15$ iTunes. As always to install navigate to the link on your device's web browser. You get 500 points from the start if you sign up from the referral.


[ref](http://www.appcasher.com/m?&amp;r=367316&amp;s=email) or enter the code 367316 for 500 points
[non-ref](http://www.appcasher.com)

5.**FreeAppSlot**: a different concept than from the other reward programs you receive spins on a slot machine which nets you points for every spin. Points can range from winning 100 in a spin to winning thousand. Rewards include apps, itunes cards from 25-50 dollars and amazon cards from 10-15 dollars. Cool concept because sometime you can get lucky and win a gift cards worth of points from one spin. Prices in rewards vary with a 10 dollar amazon card being 100,000 points. To install simply goto the link in your device's web browser. Signing up with the referral link gives you 5 additional spins off the bat.

[ref](http://freeappslots.com?refcode=55rylhui) [non-ref](http://freeappslots.com)


6.**Appbounty**: extremely similar to Free my Apps although there are only rewards in itunes cards available. The high paying apps net you around 200 points and a 10$ itunes card is 5000. I assume there may be more rewards added in the future. To install simply goto the link in your device's web browser. Signing up with the referal link gives you 50 points from the start.

[ref](http://abo.io/exaxtg) [non ref](http://abo.io)

7.**Junowallet**: same idea as all the other apps except it has offers directly from offer walls and you get paid to juno credits in which 1$ dollar juno credits is worth 1$ in the selected gift card from which a multitude are availible from their partner app bamboo wallet which you can get off the appstore, it includes almost every gift card you could think of. To install goto this link in your device's web browser.

[link](http://m.junowallet.com) Enter the invite code WM568987 in your profile to receive a 50 cent bonus.

8.**Apptrailers and Appredeem**: Apptrailers (on the app store for both IOS and android) is an app that pays you to watch trailers of apps and sometimes for installing them, Appredeem pays for installing and rating the apps and uses the same points balance as apptrailers. I however don't recommend these apps because the trailers are very low paying and the apps to install dry up very fast. For example on app redeem you can get paid to install paid apps but the reward is less than the price of the app so you are losing money, it's more of a rebate.To install apptrailers search it on either the google play store for android or the app store for IOS. To install appredeem either search it on the google play store for android or go to this link for IOS in your device's web browser.

[link](http://m.appredeem.com)



Note: almost all of these apps will require you to install a profile, the profile is harmless and doesn't do anything to your device , it's just so that app can verify that you have indeed installed the apps so you can get your reward.

I hope you have enjoyed my list and find it helpful to you when you are trying to make some mobile moolah. Thank's for reading!

1365095693.0,63,self.beermoney,1bo72e,Making Bitcoins for beer money,82,19,28,http://www.reddit.com/r/beermoney/comments/1bo72e/making_bitcoins_for_beer_money/,"**Note: This is about getting bitcoins without mining them, which is impractical for most people!!  There are sites which will pay you in bitcoins for clicks and that is the focus of this submission.**

[News](http://money.cnn.com/2013/04/03/investing/bitcoin-price/index.html) about [bitcoin mania](http://www.reddit.com/r/TrueReddit/comments/1blooj/as_economies_grow_the_money_supply_has_to_be_able/) and [related crazy shit](http://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/18f3pd/i_have_my_entire_retirement_and_savings_invested/) have been cropping up on reddit, especially as the banking crisis in Cyprus has led to a surge in the value of bitcoins.  

It was basically designed to be a digital online currency.  A bit like reddit karma, except it's useful and can be spent on goods and services.  The reason so many Cypriot bank customers seem to be moving to bitcoins is that they fear their government will grab a large slice of their bank deposits, in order to pay off their debts, probably.  Bitcoins are untouchable (so far), but are volatile and so their value can fluctuate heavily, but no one can help themselves to your bitcoins (unless you get [hacked](http://www.reddit.com/r/geek/comments/hzrcc/bitcoin_user_loses_25k_bitcoins_when_his_machine/)).  Make sure to keep your bitcoin wallet [safe](http://www.reddit.com/r/geek/comments/hzrcc/bitcoin_user_loses_25k_bitcoins_when_his_machine/c1zppkb) if you somehow do manage to make non-trivial amounts of the stuff.

They are very convenient and kind of fun though.  For example, some redditors are working on a [reddit based bitcoin feature](http://www.reddit.com/r/bitcointip) whereby you can reward a comment using bitcoins.  There's also a [reddit bitcoin market](http://www.reddit.com/r/bitmarket) where you can buy and sell random stuff.  So, they definitely are of some actual use.

One thing about most bitcoin beer money sites is that, given the nature of bitcoins, payouts can be made to anyone, in any country.

**First step:**
Get yourself a bitcoin client, which will act as a bitcoin wallet and generate bitcoin addresses.  [Bitcoin-qt](http://sourceforge.net/projects/bitcoin/files/Bitcoin/) is a simple one, which can be used on Windows, Macs and Linux computers.  You can also get an online client called [My Wallet](https://blockchain.info/wallet/new), which is compatible with iphones, Android phones, Windows, Macs and Linux.

People used to mine bitcoins using their computers, but that got progressively more difficult as time went by.  All the easy bitcoins get mined by expensive, purpose built, bitcoin mining rigs.

**Free Bitcoin Sites:**

* [Daily Bitcoins](http://dailybitcoins.org/index.php?aff=e2d0e972c7780b4e2d1d4d951ef4e191) ([nf](http://dailybitcoins.org))

* [CoinAd](https://coinad.com?r=10094)  - Free bitcoins every hour ([nf](https://coinad.com)).

* [BitCrate](http://www.bitcrate.net/index.php?ref=1373) - You can purchase reddit gold here using bitcoins ([nf](http://www.bitcrate.net)) .

* [BitCoiner](http://bitcoiner.net)

* [CoinReaper](http://coinreaper.com/) - Saves some time by helping you to fill in your address on multiple free bitcoin sites.

* [Bunny Run](http://bunnyrun.us/) - Watch an ad then win varying amount of bitcoins.

* [Hartcode](http://www.hartcode.com/wallpaper/vote) - Vote for your favourite wallpaper.

* [Coin Love Chest](https://www.btcvillage.nl/coinlovechest) - You have to tweet your love for bitcoin to get free bitcoins.


**Earn Bitcoins** - these are sites where you can earn bitcoins by doing some online work like visiting websites, watching videos/ads, completing surveys, etc.  You can obviously make more money from these sites than the more simple free ones:

* [Bit Visitor](http://www.bitvisitor.com/?ref=1EWKXjyM1BrjpngKQskehNqJRT4UmhqcJX) - Visit websites to earn money ([nf](http://www.bitvisitor.com)) .

* [Coin Tube](http://www.cointube.tv/?ref=1EWKXjyM1BrjpngKQskehNqJRT4UmhqcJX)  - Watch TV to make bitcoins ([nf](http://www.cointube.tv)).

* [Mine for BTC](http://minecraftcc.com/index.php?threads/get-paid-to-play-minecraft.4613/) - Mine unique [Minecraft](http://www.reddit.com/r/Minecraft/) blocks for bitcoins, I suppose it had to happen.

* [BitCoin4You](http://www.bitcoin4you.net/) - Earn bitcoins for visiting websites (some 18+).

* [Earn Free Bitcoins](http://earnfreebitcoins.com?ref=1EWKXjyM1BrjpngKQskehNqJRT4UmhqcJX) - Earn bitcoins for spending 1 to 5 minutes on websites ([nf](http://earnfreebitcoins.com)) .

* [Free BTC](https://free.btc.pt/login/?action=register&amp;AFFID=2399) - Watch videos ([nf](https://free.btc.pt)) .

* [Easy Bitco](https://easybitco.in/?ref=esybtco) - Earn by viewing websites and ads ([nf](https://easybitco.in)).

* [A Bit Back](http://abitback.com/members/register.php?ref=bitbck) - Watch videos, take part in surveys, trials and offers, etc. ([nf](http://abitback.com)) 

* [Bitcoin Get](http://bitcoin.chromaticcreative.net/?r=wj9r6MINfzmp)  - Earn bitcoins by reading websites and answering questions about them ([nf](http://bitcoin.chromaticcreative.net)).

**Gaming Sites:**

Didn't want to post any links to gambling or gaming sites, but this one seems like a bit of fun:

* [BitVegas](http://bitvegas.net) - A casino built entirely within the [MineCraft](http://www.reddit.com/r/Minecraft/) world.  You can play standard games like roulette and blackjack, but also ones unique to minecraft, such as Minefield and Bacon Racing.


And remember, don't get too carried away.  Do not spend ridiculous amounts of time and money investing in bitcoins!!

1352703484.0,63,self.beermoney,131wu9,Cheating Beermoney: an open discussion,87,24,28,http://www.reddit.com/r/beermoney/comments/131wu9/cheating_beermoney_an_open_discussion/,"I've been following this subreddit for quite some time, as it was originally a place for me to find some income to pay for.. you guessed it, beer. I was in college and anything extra really helped. Though while I was never dependent on it, I found myself spending a little too much time on these sites, and the payouts were so small I was basically wasting time.

I found myself trying to game some of the sites. I ran several scripts that automated some of the viewing sites, which resulted in high, passive gains and, ultimately, a ban. I knew the risk I was running and when it finally ended, I was not upset: it was more money that I had hoped for so little work.

I have seen ""cheat"" tips in this subreddit for quite awhile, never really discouraging them and even participating sometimes. I thought ""Hey, these are pretty shady sites that are trying to make a quick buck milking ad revenue, might as well get in on it. If they go out of business, so what.""

Every possible scenario has happened since. I've made hundred of dollars from some sites (both legitimately and illegit) and wasted hours on others without payout. I've been banned, and I've seen some of them fall to the ground. Welcome to business.

But over the past few months, I've been seeing some very disturbing. When I got banned from swagbucks, I checked their facebook page just to see reactions of other users, and to maybe find solace in sharing my ban.

What I saw there was very sad: hundreds of people, from all different backgrounds, *depending* on the site. Some were out of jobs, some were students, some needed more income... comments read that a few individuals spent 9 hours a day clicking on SBTV. People freaked out about codes not working, prizes taking too long to post, and outrage when accounts were banned ""for no reason"".

I've also seen some disturbing trends here on the subreddit. People posting titles about how the *need* money, how they have to pay something off *within a certain timeframe*, how the are *depending* on a site for income.

Trust me, I've wasted hours, and this is not the place to be placing any bets to alleviate financial stresses. This is called beermoney for a reason: it's for extra spending, and these sites aren't going save you from anything. 

Someone posted a cheat the other day and there were basically two kinds of negative responses:

* if you need money so bad you should get a job
* if you cheat theyre going to make it harder to make money for the rest of us

These are contradictary. One is wondering why you are so desperate to make money. The other is desperate to make money.

I don't think we can deter cheating from this subreddit alone. There will always be cheaters. Any one knows that if their is an opportunity, people will take it until it no longer exists. There are even websites dedicated to cheating, botting and gaming. Users are encouraged to not cheat (obviously), but it is ultimately up to the website to create a system that checks and balances the userbase. 

... I hate how I just used to word system, but that's what these are. You help them make money in a terrible business model, and they give you some of the leftovers to fight over.

I wanted to get your guys' opinions on this... but I mainly wanted to tell you guys' not to beat yourselves up over it. It is (literally) just a few bucks you're fighting over. There's been name-calling, reporting and disputes over what is right or wrong about watching videos that are years out of cultural relevancy. 

I love this subreddit because it has been one of the most supportive and informative ones on this site. People here are unbelievably clever and helpful, and I want that to continue. If you find yourself pissed off that you are missing out on a few bucks, just think to yourself how much this is worth it. Invest in yourself first... always.

Thanks. -db

**edit:** thank you all for contributing to this. I am actually giving up on these beermoney sites to spend more time on other stuff, but I still want to be a contributing member of this subreddit and help you guys' earn efficiently. Never hesitate to PM for any questions, or to make fun of this post and how evil I seem.

I'm not going to defend my opinion further (and thus, not editing my original post) but I wanted to say that you all have brought up very good points. I can't judge what your situation is, and it would be impossible for me to understand everyone's background. This is more commentary on how people have handled cheating vs. the actual reasons for using these beermoney sites. Money is money, and people will always need some and want more.

I do hope that you respect my opinion as I will do the same to yours. After posting this, I realized that since it deals with money, it will always be a sensitive topic. User goodbye_i chose the perfect quote: ""Whenever you feel like criticizing anyone,"" he told me, ""just remember that all the people in this world haven't had the advantages that you've had""

Best of luck earning beermoney, for whatever you are going to spend it on.

**Bing         $5**  

The one everyone uses.  Getting a $5 gift card was very nice considering the work put into it.

**Cashcrate           $50**

This is the main GPT site I use.  I love it because its simple and the surveys are decently fast to complete.  It doesn't have as many offers as something like swagbucks but it keeps me focused on doing only a couple things without having so many that I get lost.  1-2 surveys a day has turned into $50 for the month.

[Referral] (http://www.cashcrate.com/4812602)

[Non] (http://www.cashcrate.com/)

**Ebates         $30**

Not a traditional beermoney site.  However, I do a bunch of shopping online.  I received a $10 gift card just for signing up and making a first purchase.  After that, most of the websites I used gave me 1-3% cash back.  Overall a bit of extra money without any real work required.

[Referral] (http://www.ebates.com/rf.do?referrerid=NAtLYpDlNpJ%2FabY6bHIRPQ%3D%3D)

[Non] (http://www.ebates.com/)

**Clixsense &amp; Cashnhits   $12**

And finally just something to do mindlessly while searching the web.  Clixsense and Cashnhits don't pay a ton however they make me some extra money each month and don't require all that much work.

[Clixsense Referral] (http://www.clixsense.com/?5603152) **l** [non] (http://www.clixsense.com/)

[Cashnhits Referral] (http://www.cashnhits.com/index.php?ref=timmah) **l** [non] (http://www.cashnhits.com/)

Overall it went really well.  I plan to begin saving and investing this money.  Hopefully I can make $1000 in a year.  Thanks for the great community.  And let me know if you have any questions or suggestions for my routine.  Usually takes me less than 1 hour a day.

They play you 90 seconds of a song, and ask you to type out a review.  The more indepth your review, the more money you'll make for it.  Mentioning things like the melody, lyrics, toe-tappiness, etc will earn you more cash.  You earn anywhere from 5 cents to 25 cents per review.  

So if you write average reviews you'll earn 15 cents per 90 seconds which is 10 cents per minute.  $6 dollars an hour.  That's not all that bad.  Minimum withdrawal is 10 dollars, and can be done through paypal.

Its also kind of fun.  I usually listen to music anyway, so this allows me to listen to new music while doing my normal internet shenanigans, and allows me to get paid for it.  You just gotta write a few sentences every 90 seconds.  It's easy money, and can be done while doing other stuff.  Just have the site open in another window/tab.  Easy money.  It's very unique, and i love it.

I think some of you may like this site, so that's why im posting it.  It seems to be much different then other boring survey fill websites, and ad click websites.  It has a decent referral program as well.  10 percent of what your referrals make

First of all I have to say I am not a big fan of writing reviews or filling out offers. I prefer to do mindless tasks that take no effort on my part. Also I have a Blackberry so all mobile apps are out for me. I spend about an hour to an hour and half on weekdays doing surveys and such. I don’t really try to do them on weekends because there are not a lot of opportunities for surveys because most of the companies are not open. Regardless here are the sites that I use:

[**Opinion Outpost**](http://www.opinionoutpost.ca/)
Opinion Outpost would have to be my favorite site for the simple fact that I have made the most cash off of it. I check this site several times a day because there are always new surveys available. I even sometimes click refresh a couple of times and a survey will appear even though it had just told me a second ago there were none available. I started using this site on March 17th 2013 and have made $99 dollars thus far.  So on average $1.4 per day (99/72=1.375).
**Min Payout:** Varies (10 points = $1)
**Rewards:** Alawar (30 points), Amazon (50 points), Paypal (100 points).

[**Tellwut**](http://www.tellwut.com/)
Tellwut has to be one of my favorite sites too, just because it is so easy. It takes me less than 10 minutes a day to complete short survey’s for a variety of prizes. I joined this site on March 18th and have so far received 21,795 points on the site which is equivalent to 5 $10 Future Shop gift cards and almost half way to another one. (4000 points=$10 Gift Card) There are many other different reward options as well, but some cost more than others. So on average $0.77 per day (55/71=0.7746).
**Min Payout:** Varies (4000 points = Approx $10)
**Rewards:** Amazon (4000 points=$10), Future Shop (4000 points=$10), Best Buy (4000 points=$10), Home Depot (4,500 points=$10), Tango (4,500 points=$10), Wal-Mart (10,000= $25).


[**Global Test Market**](https://www.globaltestmarket.com/)
Global Test Market is a fairly decent site as well.  It is strictly a survey site, and they will send you an e-mail every time a new survey opportunity is available. I like this because I don’t have to check the website very often.  For this site I found you have to be pretty quick on the surveys or else the quota will be met pretty quickly. The only negative about this site is the high cash out. You need 1000 points, which is equal to $50. I jointed the site March 15th and have earned 1500 points since. So on average $1.01 per day (75/74=1.013). Also as of right now you can only receive payment by having a check mailed to you, but they said Paypal is going to be an option very soon.
**Min Payout:** 1000 points ($50)
**Rewards:** Cash 

[**My Survey**](https://www.mysurvey.ca/)
I am fairly new to My Survey so far I like it.  This is a survey-based site as well. I find that I don’t get that many surveys but they seem to pay fairly well. I joined the site on May 3rd.  So far I have earned 2840 points. $10 dollars is roughly equal to 1100 points.  So on average $1 (25/25=1).
**Min Payout:** 1100 points ($10)
**Rewards:** Paypal, Amazon, Lots more.

[**I-Say**]( http://www.i-say.com/)
I have been using I-Say for a while now. I really like the platform of the site and how it runs. I find that they give me quite a few surveys and are usually worth 45-90 cents each. I joined this site March 20th and since then have earned 3615 points. 100 points is equal to $1. So on average $0.52 per day (36.15/69=0.5239).
**Min Payout:** Paypal($15) ,Amazon (10$)
**Rewards:**  Amazon, Paypal, Prepaid Visa, Lots more.

Since March 15th using all these sites and few others I have made roughly 300 dollars in cash and gift cards from all these sites. This is not bad considering I do not spend much time on weekends doing this. It averages out to be about $4 a day.  This is by no means any way to get rich, but is it helpful as a student to have extra ways to make some cash.  Some tips that I would have to people who are interested in becoming involved in beer money would be to create a separate e-mail account for all these sites. It lets you manage everything way better. Also using certain demographics can help you out for survey sites as well.

The market research firm recruiting for the study agreed to make a donation to [my fundraising efforts with the Leukemia &amp; Lymphoma Society](http://pages.teamintraining.org/sf/ambbr13/daveandrade) for each qualified applicant I referred to them. 

Due to the absolutely massive and overwhelming response from Reddit, they were able to get more than five times the number of candidates they needed in less than 24 hours!

**As a result of this unexpected success, they are contributing at least $1,000 to LLS!!!** I say ""at least"", because I recently received this email from Pam Lintner, Schlesinger Associates' VP of Research:

&gt; *Hi Dave,*

&gt; *I gladly will donate to your team’s donation without hesitation.  I also need to do some math as I might owe you more than the $1K I budgeted simply because I didn’t anticipate this kind of response.   Should I owe you, I’ll make good on your next event.   I’m a big believer in Karma and will see to it.*

&gt; *All my best*
&gt; *Pam*

For all of those who participated or at least took the time to complete the pre-screener for the survey -- thank you! This wouldn't have been possible without a bit of time and effort on your part. And I'm sure you'll be putting the extra money from the study to good use :D

Hopefully, there will be opportunities for similar studies like this in the future, and if there are, I'll be sure to pass them along :)

It differs from the old spreadsheets in that it selects a link at random, and others' links will less likely be vandalized since links cannot be edited, and only one submission per user is allowed. Note that each entry expires after 7 days so that the pool doesn't remain too large and contain many inactive users (although you may resubmit after that time). However, since the mods are creating a new spreadsheet system, this may just be a temporary system until their system is finished.

**Please do not submit a link if you are a Platinum member.** This allows people who have not reached Platinum a better chance of getting an upgrade. Thanks!

Version 2.,89,26,109,http://www.reddit.com/r/beermoney/comments/11wrm7/make_money_while_you_poop_version_2/,"The world has been plagued with the question, ""what should I do while I poop."" Some people read the newspaper, others read books, some enjoy classical music, while others record themselves and upload it to porn sites.

Not me. I spend my daily (sometimes more) poop sessions making money. Now you may be asking yourself, ""how on earth do you make money while you poop? Do you harvest peanuts? Do you resell corn? Are you Jesus?"" The answer is - nope, I use Junowallet on my android/iphone.

**I want to be like you. What can I do?** Well, the truth is you'll never be like me. But here's a few simple steps that'll get you started in the right direction.

* Sell your plasma

* Save up your *heart* earned money to get an android phone or an iPhone.

* Search that sonnovabitch for an app called ""Junowallet.""

* Eat.

* Digest.

* Excrete.

* Open up Junowallet and watch short videos or download apps

* ???

* Profit

When you open up the app you'll be like ""what in the hell is this?"" But then you'll realize, ""oh, i get it... all i do is go to 'rewards per video' and then click em for 1 to 2 cents a pop.

Each video you watch will reward you after you watch it for 13 seconds. 

That's right. For every minute you spend pooping you can get anywhere from 4.6 cents to 9.2 cents or so.

**But, what do I do with the money yo?** I don't care what you do with your money. However, what I do is exchange for amazon gift cards.  But there's a crap ton of other types to choose from as well.

Every 13 seconds is 1 to 2 cents. That means that for every minute you're on the crapper you'll receive 4.6 to 9.2 cents or so.

Now you may be thinking, ""but dude, that's not very much money."" Here's where you're wrong. Lets say you poop 10 minutes per day every day for a week. That's $3.22 - $6.44 every week. That's $167.44 - $334.88 per year for only 10 minutes of pooping per day. Some of you poop more, some less, but either way - free money.

**tell me more!** No. **Please!?** Fine.
You can also use this app to download apps for cash money.  You can do this on the toilet as well. 

**How long will it take to get my giftcards?** 24 hours dude, I'm serious.
 
**What's the minimum payment** It depends on the giftcard.  Amazon is 5 bucks.

**Is there anything else I should know?** Yes, use my referral code ""DX1274248"" without the quotes for an extra 25 cents or something. I'll make 50 cents.

**What's the referral system like?**  Dude, 3 friggin' levels!

**Is there anything else I should know?** Nope. Carry on.

Now everyone go get some Taco Bell, a roll of toilet paper, and watch the money roll in.

1301629067.0,60,self.beermoney,gg2eb,"My five favorite sites for beermoney...(ok, diapermoney).  These have made me a consistent income every month.  ",72,12,12,http://www.reddit.com/r/beermoney/comments/gg2eb/my_five_favorite_sites_for_beermoneyok/,"I see a few posts in the last few months regarding Swagbucks but wanted to give everyone an updated list of what has been working great for me.  I've been a member of several of these for many years and have had good results with the combination of all 5, basically paying for my diapers &amp; wipes for twins each month which has been awesome!  Would be more awesome if I could use it towards beer...sigh... 

So first I'll just describe what I do on all the sites on a day to day basis, and then give you a list of what I focus on on each website.  There are other things to do than on this list, but I've either found them to be scammy or a wayyy ridiculous waste of time.

* Paid to read e-mails - This is what I first started with a few years ago.  I get around 5-15 e-mails in my inbox that I have filtered to go to a certain folder.  At the end of the day, I just open the advertisements in different tabs, close them, and bam...instant money in seconds.  So easy.

* Free points, money - A few sites just give you free points for logging in and ""checking in"", by finding the ""hidden"" code on their blog, or clicking on a certain area of their site every day.  It takes seconds and will inevitably add up over time for doing almost nothing.  

* Videos - Watch 30 second - 4 minute commercials, music videos, and shows for the equivalent of about $0.02 to .04 each.  There are usually 3-10 opportunities to watch videos at any site that offers them every day.

* Surveys - These pay out big compared to everything else, but can take 20-30 min of your time.  They are usually worth around $0.80 or 80 points.  You aren't always going to be qualified to take the survey either, but there are usually 30+ opportunities daily at each site that offers them.

* Mechanical turk.  If you are familiar with this site, it's the same thing, just linked through a different website.  Simple to excruciating tasks for anything from $0.01 per task to $5.00 for writing tasks. I'm not exactly sure, but I think you make the same amount on either site.

* Searches - This is a really easy way to make points.  I use Chrome pretty much exclusively, but have designated Firefox to be my ""junk"" toolbar browser.  I have all 5 toolbars installed [like this](http://i.imgur.com/fzjZN.jpg), all neatly in a row, and I just go down the list about 3x a day (morning, afternoon, night).  Some sites you get paid for a certain amount of searches per month, and some up to 3x per day.  I have Ghostery installed as well, but I haven't noticed any issues.  A key thing here is that you do not have to click on any sponsored links (or any links at all) to get points.  And again, I don't even use the browser for anything but this.  I make somewhere around $0.01 to well over .20 per site this way.

* Shopping - Ok, I do almost ALL my shopping online.  So, basically any time I buy from eBay, or Gap, or anything like that..I just make sure to check to see if one of the 5 sites has referral links.  Most of the time one of them does, and the payout has been usually somewhere between $2.00-$10.00, but depending on your purchase price it may be way above that.

* Grocery Coupons, Movie Tickets - another one of those things that if you're already doing it, you might as well go through these sites.  Reimbursement varies.  You print out the coupon from Coupons.com on their site, and once you scan it at the register, 5 or 6 weeks later you get $0.05 to $0.10 per coupon.  I actually just noticed the Movie Tickets option, which looks legit as you go through Fandango.  Not sure how much you get back.

Anyways, I hope you don't mind after typing all that that I include my referral links on these.  But here are the 5, and the areas I focus on each.


* [Zoombucks](http://www.zoombucks.com/join.php?ref=mgrmgr85) - Free points, Searching, Paid e-mails, Surveys, Videos, Mechanical Turk, Grocery Coupons, Movie Tickets
* [Cashcrate](http://www.cashcrate.com/2006483) - Free points, Videos, Surveys, Searching
* [InboxDollars](http://www.inboxdollars.com/?r=ref6710948) - Paid Emails, Surveys, Videos, Grocery Coupons
* [Swagbucks](http://www.swagbucks.com/refer/mgrmgr85) - Free points, Searching, Surveys, Videos, Mechanical Turk, Grocery Coupons
* MyPoints (message me with your e-mail if you want me to refer you to this one) - Paid E-mails, Shopping (Get paid to shop at eBay here), Searches, Grocery Coupons

Hope these can be helpful to you guys.  Let me know if you have any other questions or want me to go into more detail on a particular site, I have lots of other tips.

Also, this week is a good week for me - I received a $50 Amazon code from MyPoints in the mail, I am about to get my fourth $5 Amazon gift code from Swagbucks this month, I'm almost to the point that I have enough to cash out my points and get my first $20 Amazon code from Zoombucks, AND I am finally, finally at $30.00 at InboxDollars which means they will be sending me a check this month.  So, you see...not bad for bs-ing around for half an hour a day.

I submitted a very similiar post to r/assistance a while ago and thought about reposting today since there have been a recent influx of new users.*

------------------------------------------------------------------------



To make extra money, I take paid surveys online. They are legit, but the catch is that you will not get rich doing this. Most pay with amazon e-gift cards or send you a check in the mail. Most surveys take 10-15 minutes to do and pay you $1-3 for completing them. Some surveys even send you new stuff to try out for free. I have recieved full bottles of shampoo, barbeque sauce, napkins, baby lotion and salad dressing to test out, all for free, I did not even have to pay for shipping.

I make about a hundred dollars a month doing this and it's all very easy. Boring, but easy. Actually, sometimes you do surveys where they show you a new movie or video game trailer that hasn't been released to the public yet, and you tell them if you liked it or not. Those surveys are actually really fun, and I am grateful to get paid for doing them.

I have been doing this for about six months now and have made about six hundred dollars (I am pretty effecient and do about 3-5 surveys daily though, it really just depends on how many you're willing to do daily/weekly). I also use Amazons mechanical turk, and I use other sites that award you for using thier search engine (they make money by showing you ads, and you get a small amount back for using thier search engine). 

Here are some links to legit sites where you can make a little extra income. I will be upfront and let you know that I am posting my referral links in hopes of being helped out too, because if you join under my link, I will get a bonus for referring new users. I could really use the help, my part time job only pays bills and groceries and I'd like to be able to go out to dinner once in a while or buy a little something for myself :D

I hope that I can help you guys out, and I hope that you can help me out. Thanks :)

I am on many other sites too, but would need your email to be able to send you a referral invite. If you have any questions, please feel free to message me. Most of these sites have facebooks, and you can see on thier walls that they have many happy users that get paid and earn cash and prizes. Swagbucks for instance, has over a million facebook fans. I promise all these sites are legit.


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Here are some tips I have learned since I have started:**

* Save the sites to your favorites so you can access them easily and so you won't forget about any of them.

* Create a ""survey taking"" email to sign up to all these sites (because some sites will send you a few surveys everyday and they can start piling up fast).

* Surveys come and go fast! When you see a survey in your email, try to do it asap.

* If the website has a facebook or twitter, I recommend adding them, because they'll give you a heads up on new features, limited offers, easy offers, etc. Also, many of thier facebook walls are full of helpful members who will help you out if needed.

* If you ever come across a site that claims it pays $20-50 per survey, it's most likely a scam.

* In fact, here's a great site I use to check out different survey sites to see if they're legit or not: http://www.surveypolice.com/rankings


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Information about the different sites:**

Sometimes Swagbucks, Gifthulk and Zoombucks have short commercials to watch or easy tasks to do in thier special offers section, doing these will help build your points up fast.

Crowdtap is a bit different than the other survey sites, as it's not really surveys, but more like polls and quick questions you answer for points and amazon codes. They are one of my favorite sites because their site is very minimilistic and user friendly.

Besides earning money, another cool thing about taking surveys is that you get to voice your own opinion. If you're sick of seeing the same cliched movies and tv shows, seeing the same food at the grocery store month after month, and playing the same video game formula time after time, let them know. It's all market research and they want to know what you think.

1345924539.0,57,self.beermoney,ythyv,How I earn my beer money - Mini-guide,66,9,25,http://www.reddit.com/r/beermoney/comments/ythyv/how_i_earn_my_beer_money_miniguide/,"Ok, so I’ve been a leech long enough, both here on /r/beermoney/ and on /r/HWTF/, so I decided to give something back to the community, hopefully useful. I will try to be as coherent as I can, so bear with me on this but, no matter what, I will be as honest with you as possible. Those below are the websites I use to earn my booze money:

**MTurk** - [Register](https://www.amazon.com/gp/aws/ssop/index.html?awscbctx=&amp;awscbid=urn%3Aaws%3Asid%3A027Y0TCSPRG5XHFYJSR2&amp;awscredential=&amp;awsnoclientpipeline=true&amp;awsstrict=false&amp;awsturknosubway=true&amp;wa=wsignin1.0&amp;wctx=&amp;wreply=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.mturk.com%3A443%2Fmturk%2Fendsignin&amp;wtrealm=urn%3Aaws%3Asid%3A027Y0TCSPRG5XHFYJSR2&amp;awssig=yZwe4P9pATXcyDaYEFCDKycNYIM%3D) - Probably everyone knows about it. It has something for everyone: if you want to do only surveys, you have enough of them to keep you working at least one hour every day. If you want to do data entry HITs, just go for it! Like I said, there’s plenty for everyone. However, you have to know how to find those HITs that are indeed worth turking for. My strategy? I knock out everything I can find on the HWTF section, then I search for anything that I’m qualified for and is over one dollar. After that, I search again for “survey” or “study” that pay not less than 25 cents. Bu doing this, I can easily earn about $100 each week with about two hours of turking each day. You can use your money either to buy Amazon gift cards or transfer them into your bank account. Easy-peasey.

**Topline** - [Ref]( https://www.jointopline.com/?fid=YW3WV6Y5L9TL) | [Non-ref]( https://www.jointopline.com) - This is the purest passive earner there is. The principle is this: you sign up, install their plugin for your browser and just continue surfing, as usual. This plugin replaces any ads with some of theirs and you get paid for it. Simple, huh? Vewy. They have a point-based system and for each website you visit that incorporates ads you get one point. For every 1000 points, you get $0.75. It may not sound as much, but given the fact that you do nothing is convincing enough, at least for me. Also, the minimum cashout is at $10, which can be achieved in about 2-3 months of surfing, without having any referrals. Also, for each referral you earn 5% of the points they earn. The money can be cashed out to PayPal.

**NeoBux** - [Ref]( http://www.neobux.com/?r=ZniperD) | [Non-ref](http://www.neobux.com/) - A very intriguing PTC (Paid-to-Click) website. If you’re not familiar with the concept, what you have to do is click a given number of ads each day, for which you get a very small amount of money. Neobux offers you the possibility to **rent** referrals for a certain period of time, during which you get a sum of money based on how many clicks they have each day. Of course, there is the classical concept of direct referrals too, but, obviously, you don’t earn much from them, unless you get to have a large base of active referrals. Anyway, back to the rented referrals. This system gives you a lot of new opportunities, because you get to make decisions like recycling a certain referral if they have bad stats or adding more time to their renting period and so on. Also, for each ad you click you get three chances to the so-called “AdPrize” The prizes vary from points, cash or even Golden membership (which, believe me, is welcome anytime). Anyway, if you want to go deep I strongly recommend you their [FAQ](http://www.neobux.com/m/a/). The minimum cashout is $2, to PayPal, Payza or Neteller.

**ClixSense** - [Ref](http://www.clixsense.com/?4043460) | [Non-ref](http://www.clixsense.com/) - Another PTC website, but this one is not based that much on renting referrals. If you don't want to take your chances renting referrals that may or may not be productive, Clixsense is based on direct referral revenue and mini-tasks. More specifically, it incorporates the CrowdSource working platform, so you have work to do 24/7, even if the pay is not that good. If you get a decent number of direct referrals, you just have to click your ads every day (takes a few minutes) and that's it. Also, there are offers to complete, plus a nice mini-game called ClixGrid - very much like Neobux' AdPrize, if you're lucky you can win cash or points. You can then cash your money out to PayPal, Payza, Liberty Reserve or check. The minimum payrates can be found [here](http://www.clixsense.com/en/Helpdesk-FAQ/0-1#pq).

**Naturebucks** - [Ref]( http://naturebucks.com/members/register.php?ref=Zniper) | [Non-ref]( http://naturebucks.com/members/register)  - NatureBucks is a pretty straight-forward website. Here, you can complete various “offers”, which mostly consist of surveys or registering. You can even find a dedicated section to the best offers there are, [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/naturebucksbestof) on reddit. Anyway, by completing those offers you earn either cash or points, which can be eventually transformed into cash too. The minimum withdraw is of only 5 cents to Paypal, or $1 for Amazon gift cards. Also, the 5-tier referral system is great if you can get a decent number of direct referrals, because you earn 20% from your level 1-5 referrals.

**NatureGPT** - [Ref]( http://naturegpt.com/members/register.php?ref=ZniperD) | [Non-ref]( http://naturegpt.com/) It’s pretty much like Naturebucks. You have a list of offers (mostly surveys) you can complete for either cash or points. Somehow, I even like this better than Naturebucks, because for each referral that earns at least $0.25 you get $1, bur only one time per referral, plus, of course 20% of what they earn next. You can then withdraw your cash to Paypal or use it to buy Amazon gift cards. The minimum payout is $2, which is decent enough in my opinion.

**PaidViewpoint** - [Ref]( http://paidviewpoint.com/?r=64nijt) | [Non-ref]( http://paidviewpoint.com)  - Another survey site. Their surveys don’t pay very much, but you get about $1 only for completing you profile. After each survey you complete your so-called TraitScore also increases. How does this help you? After your TraitScore reaches a certain threshold, the amount of money you earn per each completed survey will increase. Don’t expect to earn hundreds of dollars every month, but if you complete a survey every now and then they will start pilling up. However, the minimum payout is of $25 to Paypal, which can be a bit disappointing for some of you. 

**Pollbuzzer** - [Ref](http://pollbuzzer.com/?r=M5Yn84b9dMzNu1nB9og%2fJQ%3d%3d) | [Non-ref]( http://pollbuzzer.com)- Very nice survey site. There are not any offers available, but you get a mail from them every now and then asking you to complete a short survey, worth $1. It does take just a few minutes, which is definitely worth the time, even if there’s not much to do. You can cash out your earnings to PayPal.  Also, each time one of your referrals answers 4 of these polls you get one dollar.

**CloudCrowd** - [Ref](https://www.cloudcrowd.com/i/l1clvw) | [Non-ref](https://www.cloudcrowd.com/) - It's a pretty good cloud working platform. You don't always find too much work to do, unless you do writing. But first things first. In order to do writing, you have to earn some credentials first, depending on what type of writing you want to do. I only applied for the marketing credential myself only once, and was rejected because I rushed through it and did a poor job, but I'm sure it's not that hard to get it. Also, they payrate for writers is decent enough, varying from 3 to 5 cents per written word, if your work is accepted. Furthermore, there is generally a lot of data entry work to do. You may find requests like ""copy *this* and *that* into thegiven fields"" and stuff like this. It isn't necessarily very well paid, but you can easily knock out a few bucks a day if you stick with it for, let's say, half an hour daily. If you're lucky, you may find some categorization work once in a while, which is easy and generally well-paid. There is no minimum payout; they will automatically transfer your earnings to your PayPal account every day.

Overall, I hope I’ve been helpful at least to some of you. Feel free to ask your questions if you have any. 

The other day I noticed the bing rewards bot I was using had stopped working. I was doing the searches, but I wasn't getting the points. So I decided as a fun project I'd set out to make my own. One thing I didn't like about most rewards bots was that they created a bunch of gibberish words to search for. I felt like if ever MS was going to catch on, they'd do it when they saw you searching for a bunch of bullshit. So I grabbed a massive list of Scrabble approved words. My bot pulls from that list and allows you to input the time between searches and the total number (up to 50 for now).

After I made it I realized my bot suffers from the same weird issue other bots have right now...it only works in IE. Which as a web developer is hilarious to me. There's nothing in my code that would cause that, so I think it's a bing issue. You only get points when you run it from IE. Anywhere else and bing knows it's a bot.

I just made this for fun as a learning exercise and as something I can use on a daily basis. Would love to get some feedback and if you find it useful, great! Feel free to keep using it!

edit: Per a request by /u/bearsfan654, I added an auto mode that begins searching as soon as you load the page. It can be toggled on/off using a cookie stored on your computer. I also made it 25% less ugly.

Seems like there's a mix of people that can and can't get it to work at all (IE or not). If you get it working, let me know what browser, version, and OS. Thanks!",,False,,t5_2s5or,1376591028.0,,,True,t3_1kf1n4,http://www.reddit.com/r/beermoney/comments/1kf1n4/i_created_my_own_bing_rewards_bot/,

Wrapp is a site where you can send $5 gift cards to your friends, for a number of different stores, including American Apparel, H&amp;M, Fab.com, and Office Depot. These gift cards can be used online or in store using Wrapp's mobile app on either your Android or Iphone.

Your friends not into making beer money as much as you and i am? Here's what i propose: lets all make an fb page, strictly for sending wrapp cards to each other. Doesnt have to be anything fancy, you can set one up in 5 mins. If you already have an fb strictly for freebies, even better. You add me, I add you. You send me a free $5 gift card, i send you one back. We all add each other and scratch each others backs, Pretty soon we all have tons of gift cards we can use how we please. Dont shop at H&amp;M? Flip it on Ebay for $3, who cares, it was FREE. It's not even against Wrapp's TOS, we're just a big group of buddies who use Wrapp to its full potential.


If this sounds interesting to you:

* make a new fb profile, strictly for Wrapp
* Sign up at http://wrapp.com
* Add me as a friend https://www.facebook.com/vincent.grove.1
* Enjoy dem giftcards!

Seriously if we all add eachother and keep the gift card circlejerk going, we should be able to buy all sorts of neat shit. Hope you guys like this idea.

**Edit:**It appears gift-cards don't stack, like how say Amazon cards can be stacked and added to one big balance. **SO** we wont be able to use 300 gift cards at one time at office depo and buy a new laptop **BUT** if we want to just keep buying $5 notebooks and pens whenever where there, we should be able to do that.

Each day I do a few HITs on Amazon Mechanical Turk. I'm trying to get up to about 10 a day, but only ones that I think will pay well. As you may know, some days that's more difficult than others. 

------

### After I complete a HIT, I color code it and rate it on my blog:

[http://hitsworthturkingfor.blogspot.com/](http://hitsworthturkingfor.blogspot.com/)


The idea behind it is that I hope others will be able to see these every day and make a few extra bucks by completing the HITs that pay you the best for your time.


I see that many of you have a routine or goal to make a few extra dollars each day. My blog is not going to make you rich, but adding it to your routine may make mTurk a little more tolerable - I know searching for good paying HITs can be a PITA and sometimes not worth the effort. This is my low-tech attempt at solving that.

------

### A little back-story for those wondering why I'm doing this:

I'm not rich by any means, but my expenses are covered for the moment. I quit my $25/hr full time HR job back in the summer and decided that I was going to enjoy my life for a bit. I was tired of the rat race and even more tired of sitting at a desk for 8 hours a day. I felt as if I wasn't contributing much to life and more-so, not living the life that I wanted to live. So I quit, and then immediately did a month long 1200 mile bicycle trip. Then did some traveling to see friends and family that I had always wanted to see but could never ""find the time.""


My next journey starts in 4 months - I'll be going to South America for two years starting in April. For the moment though, I'm in a bit of a lull period, so I decided to work on some projects that I've always wanted to do. One of those is to design a website with decent traffic, that does some good in the world. 


This site is my very attempt at just that. There are a lot of people who just don't know or don't have the tools to make money, I know quite a few in my personal life, and being the HR guy that I was, I did some research and traveled down this niche. This is a start, of course. I intend to add more to the blog, hopefully things that provide better opportunities, things that will inspire and change people's lives. But, I wanted to start with a legitimate way to make money online, because it's one of those taboo areas of the internet where everyone seems to be scamming you or wanting your money. That said, yes, my blog is ad-supported, but this is an experiment to see if paid blogging actually pays. I intend to donate my earnings and write up a post about it before I leave in April.

Basically, it gathers the links to videos on the Reuters News page and selects one at random after a random length of time (between 54 and 95 seconds). It looks like you are clicking on different videos. It stops when there is a Captcha. If you love this and it changes your life, feel free to send me one of those $5 AGC codes that you earn with it ;) If you hate it and/or it doesn't work, no loss :)


**Description I had on the Chrome Web Store before taking off:**

This will select a random time interval between 54 and 95 seconds, then randomly select another video on the page from the list of related videos and take you to that URL. It doesn't automatically refresh the same video over and over; it will take you to new videos automatically (randomly).

It stops if a Captcha should pop up, but you will need to check to see if there is one so that it doesn't disappear after some time. Also, it changes the title of the page/tab to reflect what % your bar is when the page loads, so you don't have to keep checking back to it. When it hits 90%, you will be getting either a Captcha (causing the script to auto-stop), or simply be awarded, which will cause the script to keep going.

Tested watching the Reuters News videos. Once you have a video playing, right-click the background, go to SwagBucks Automator and hit Enable. Sometimes you have to disable, then re-enable (via the right-click, not through the Extensions screen).

**edit:** Changed the link to my dropbox since I don't want to jeopardize my Google dev account with take-down requests from SwagBucks.

**1: Referral trains over and over, with no OC in the post.**

This can be easily combated by putting up a beer money starters guide in the sidebar. Referrals trains are unnecessary, and if you want referrals, feel free to put your referral in an **informative** post, otherwise, sign up for datsoup.

**2: I'm under 18 and want to make money.**

There has been a huge influx of these. I think the general rule is most sites that require a SSN aren't for underage people, and it's probably not a good idea to try to bypass these restrictions.

**3: What are some good ways to make ""x"" amount?**

Again, easily remedied by a simple F.A.Q in the sidebar. This simple question is posted way too much, and the answer rarely varies.


So as you can see we have a lot of recurring posts, with the same answers over and over.

Here is the original thread (that got stolen ) if anyone is wondering: [http://www.reddit.com/r/beermoney/comments/o8pzb/how_to_make_001min_1440d_43200month_by_doing/](http://www.reddit.com/r/beermoney/comments/o8pzb/how_to_make_001min_1440d_43200month_by_doing/)


My method is a little bit different, but does not require you to own an android phone and will only tie up your PC, instead of your PC and your phone. After researching the best methods and slinging together a few custom applications I think I have got it down pretty good.


**I have uploaded my autoclick application I created and the apk file here:** [http://www.rapidspread.com/file.jsp?id=ppk9vw1txj](http://www.rapidspread.com/file.jsp?id=ppk9vw1txj)
Grab those files first. Then:


1. **EDIT**: A friend of mine has just told me about [BlueStacks](http://bluestacks.com/), It may be worth checking out instead of YouWave. /
Download and install YouWave (http://youwave.com/), the trial version will do for now, or if you are internet savy I'm sure you know where to look for the cracked version. However, a license is only $14, so you should be able earned enough money after 1 day for a license. Alternatively you can try using the Android SDK emulator if you don't like YouWave.


2. Place the ""AppTrailers-1.apk"" into your youwave app folder, which should be located at: ""C:\Users\&lt;Your Username&gt;\youwave\android apps""


3. Start YouWave, load the app by double clicking it on the panel on the left hand side. Then restart the emulator and run App Trailers.


4. Open my AutoClicker.jar tool, it is a simple gui program that I threw together quickly. If it doesn't work when you try to start it make sure Java is up to date. If that doesn't work try getting the latest version of the JDK installed as well, this solved issues I had
getting it to work on other computers.
 **EDIT**: If for whatever you need 3 clicks, download this version of my tool [http://dl.dropbox.com/u/18137139/Auto3Clicker.jar](http://dl.dropbox.com/u/18137139/Auto3Clicker.jar)

**EDIT** A minimizeable clicker has been made by **Sakuraiikeda** for BlueStacks, you can get it here [http://www.reddit.com/r/beermoney/comments/ob6zg/autoing_app_trailers_from_a_pc_guide/c3fzodz?context=3](http://www.reddit.com/r/beermoney/comments/ob6zg/autoing_app_trailers_from_a_pc_guide/c3fzodz?context=3)


5. Configure the tool, use the test buttons to see where the mouse will click. I suggest you set the click location of the second button in it's bottom right corner, sometimes the app may become unresponsive at times which will bring up a ""Wait or Force Close"" option menu, putting the position 2 coordinates in this places assures it will click the ""Wait"" and resume button if this menu pops up (or will click the normal button otherwise).


That's it, you should be able to earn around $0.01 a minute with zero effort after setup.

1376507080.0,49,self.beermoney,1kd7ja,"Writing Heavy Routine, Decent Hourly Wage",76,27,16,http://www.reddit.com/r/beermoney/comments/1kd7ja/writing_heavy_routine_decent_hourly_wage/,"I have a lot of spare time in the summer months.  Because of this I try and work on a few different sites to earn some extra money during the summer months.  I employ a decently heavy writing routine but because of that earn over about $10 an hour.  I work on a variety of sites both active and passive income.  Overall I try and work about 4 hours a day so I don’t burn out but also so that I earn some decent income.

**Active Sources**

**[Constant Content]( https://www.constant-content.com/?aref=85056) l [non] (https://www.constant-content.com/)**

This is a content mill site.  However it is one of the more open ended ones.  You can either take on jobs writing for specific people or you can write about whatever you want and hope someone buys it.  I generally do both.  Each day I try and write one article for someone and one article about a topic I enjoy.  This gives me a good base of articles to sell over time and some steady income each day.  

**2-3 Hours,  $20-$50**

**[Web Answers] (http://www.webanswers.com/_answer32/) l [non] (http://www.webanswers.com/)**

I know a lot of people that work on WebAnswers.  Believe me; this one starts out really slow.  A ton of my friends have already given up.  However that is because they get their 50 questions answers, see that they aren’t really making any money and give up.  And that’s true, if you have 50 answers, you won’t make more than a few cents each month.  However, I do this in my down time.  When I am thinking about other things or revising a different article.  I have Webanswers up all day and whenever I have a moment I go find a question or 2 to answer.  Over the course of most days I answer about 10 questions.  This gives me about 300 answers each month.  Eventually I began earning good money and now the 5-10 minutes I spend on the site earn me about $5 a day.

**5-10 Minutes, $3-$8**

**[CashCrate] (http://www.cashcrate.com/4812602) l [non] (http://www.cashcrate.com/)**

This is my guilty pleasure website.  I do this when I need some mindless task to do or I am watching television and taking a break from writing.  Does this pay as well as the others?  Not a chance, however I can mindlessly fill out surveys and recharge my brain while watching television.  Cashcrate is your basic GPT site however they offer by far the best surveys.  I can always find surveys available to me and have never had an issue with running out of things to do.

**.5-1 hour,  $2-$5**

**[ClixSense] (http://www.clixsense.com/?5603152) l [non] (http://www.clixsense.com/)**

**[NeoBux] (http://www.neobux.com/?r=Timmah33) l [non] (http://www.neobux.com/)**

**[CashnHits] (http://www.cashnhits.com/index.php?ref=timmah) l [non] (http://www.cashnhits.com/)**

I also do some PTC sites on the site.  These basically require no time.  I have two monitors and these are open on one.  I can click ads while I do other tasks or on my breaks.  These also start out extremely slow, like $0.05 a day per site.  (Besides CashnHits Autosurf which gives me around $0.20 a day).  However once you build up enough to rent referrals you can begin to earn more cash.  Earnings are never going to be crazy good, however for pretty much no work, you earn some decent money.
 
**1 minute, $0.50 - $2**

**Passive Income**

I also do a few passive income sites.  I am already at my computer so why not.

**[Digital Generation] (http://coingeneration.com/auth/new/347571/) l [non] (http://coingeneration.com/)**

Digital Generation basically runs in the background using my computer resources and pays me about $1 each day.  By signing up you get a 30 day trial period.  After that you have to buy a subscription for $50 to continue earning.  I would not recommend spending your own money on it, however if you can get a few referrals (friends joined me for the 30 day trial) you can have enough by the end of your trial to pay the subscription fee.

**$1**

**[Locket] (http://getlocket.com/r/?48660719) l [non] (http://getlocket.com/)**

I have this program on my android phone.  They pay you about $0.03 an hour for unlocking your phone.  I am constantly on my phone so this is really free money.  Just download the program and let it run.  It’s pretty unobtrusive and just replaces your lock screen with advertisements.

**$0.30**

I average about 3-4 hours of work every day.  I generally make between $30 and $60 on a daily basis.  I suggest you give some of these sites a try if you are interested in building some extra income.  You won’t become rich overnight, but they are great for earning some extra income for fun money or investing.

You get paid to log in and watch ads, the typical ad is 10 cents and up, much better than the 1-2 cents from swagbucks and the like. Right now they have 2 x deans ice-cream ads at 30 cents each. Which you can watch each day, so 60 cents a day for a couple of minutes total. It reminds me a little of jebbit as it shows you your hourly rate of something like $15 per hour. I follow [this forum](http://forum-ptc-investigation.com/index.php?topic=2341.0) for the links to the ads. You can watch these ads on the IOS/Android app or on your computer.

They also have check in opportunities where you scan a product in a store to earn some money and recently they started doing cash back similar to the way ibotta works where you can get money back from certain products. You would do these through the phone app.

Payment is through a visa jingit card or you can redeem for musicme credit. You have to pay $3 for the card which simply comes from your earnings. But that is just a one off payment and is then re-loadable instantly. You can stick as little as a penny on it from your jingit account if you want.

One thing to mention is the earnings limit of $10 per week. But there's only been an occasional time when I've hit the limit so it shouldn't affect you drastically. You can raise the limit through referrals, I think it is raised 50 cents for each referral to a max of $15 per week limit. Oh... and you can have multiple accounts per household so my husband and I are both joined.

There are definitely dry spells when it comes to the adds, but when they have busy spells they are pretty awesome!

Basically, I will just outline what I do about once every 2-3 months. 

In Australia where I live, every few months the local council organises a rubbish pick up where residents can leave all their old junk out the front to be collected in a few days. At every one of these throw-outs, I go around my neighborhood houses and collect all the metallic items I can find. If you can, cut off the power cords to the old electronics as they can be quite valuable. Once you have collected everything you can, take it all to your local scrap metal merchant. This may seem like more effort than it's worth, but after a morning of work (around 4 hours) on a weekend, I made ~$50, but could have made a lot more if I could have fit more in my car. I'm not sure if other countries run these rubbish pickups, but I'm pretty sure it happens across all of Australia.

Referrals for this app aren't even that great, just a straight one time $1.  Decent, but nothing impressive compared to long term earnings of other sites.

**So on to the review.**

Locket is a program that replaces your Android Lock Screen with Ads.  It actually is pretty unobtrusive otherwise and the lock screen feature isn't very annoying.  It is still in Beta as far as I can tell and it still has some issues.  For instance, sometimes it locks while I am working on my phone, other times it doesn't actually pop up with an ad.  Overall though it works pretty seamlessly with your phone and doesn't seem to cause many issues.

**So, what can I earn?**

Well, Locket pays you $0.03 every hour for unlocking your phone 3 times.  This is very small but it does pay better than watching ads on Neobux or Clixsense.  Lets say you are on your phone about 16 hours out of every day.  This could translate into almost $0.50 a day just for using your phone.  

Essentially earning you around **$15 a month in passive income**.  I gotta say, this is actually quite good, provided the ads stay unobtrusive and don't mess with my phone in other ways.

**Cashing Out:**
There is a minimum cash out of $10, so you can cash out about every 20 or so days.  The best part is you can cash out directly to paypal.  Pretty awesome for a brand new app.

So if you want to check it out:

1346283996.0,51,self.beermoney,z1qok,Make money while you poop.  1 to 2 cents a minute.,71,20,42,http://www.reddit.com/r/beermoney/comments/z1qok/make_money_while_you_poop_1_to_2_cents_a_minute/,"The world has been plagued with the question, ""what should I do while I poop.""  Some people read the newspaper, others read books, some enjoy classical music, while others record themselves and upload it to porn sites.  

Not me.  I spend my daily (sometimes more) poop sessions making money.  Now you may be asking yourself, ""how on earth do you make money while you poop?  Do you harvest peanuts?  Do you resell corn?  Are you Jesus?""  The answer is - nope, I watch apptrailers on my android/iphone.

**I want to be like you. What can I do?**  Well, the truth is you'll never be like me.  But here's a few simple steps that'll get you started in the right direction.

1.  Sell your plasma 
2.  Save up your heart earned money to get an android phone or an iPhone.
3.  Search that sonnovabitch for an app called ""apptrailers.""
4.  Eat.
5.  Digest.
6.  Excrete.
7.  Open up apptrailers and watch short advertisements
8.  ???
9.  Profit

When you open up the app you'll be like ""what in the hell is this?""
But then you'll realize, ""oh, i get it... all i do is go to 'videos' and then click em for 5 points a pop.""

Each video you watch will give you a 15 second or 30 second advertisement before the trailer begins.  -As soon as the trailer begins you can exit right out of the video and still claim your points for it.

That's right.  For every minute you spend pooping you can get anywhere from 10 to 20 points.

**But, what do I do with the points yo?**  I don't care what you do with your points.  However, what I do is exchange for gift cards or paypal.

Every 10 points is 1 cent.  That means that for every minute you're on the crapper you'll receive 1 to 2 cents.  Now you may be thinking, ""but dude, that's not very much money.""  Here's where you're wrong.  Lets say you poop 10 minutes per day every day for a week.  That's $.70 - $1.40 every week.  That's $36.40 - $72.80 per year for only 10 minutes of pooping per day.  Some of you poop more, some less, but either way - free money.

**tell me more!**  No.
**Please!?** Fine.

Ok.  You can also use the program or it's sister program - Appredeem - to download apps for points.  You can do this on the toilet as well.  Your points are shared between the apps as well.

**How long will it take to get my money through paypal?** Less than a minute dude, I'm serious.
**What's the minimum payment** A whopping 15 cents.

**Is there anything else I should know?** Yes, use my referral code ""borkedbetty5"" without the quotes for an extra 5 cents.  I'll make 25 cents.  

**Is there anything else I should know?** Nope.  Carry on. 

Now everyone go get some Taco Bell, a roll of toilet paper, and watch the money roll in.

A little over a month ago I stumbled on beermoney and became heavily involved in checking out a bunch of different sites mentioned. I have found a handful of sites to be the best, most will not come as a surprise to regular followers. 
The main ways I earn are surveys, videos, and special offers that require you to register. I recommend making a fake email account, fake name, address, and phone number, and never entering credit card or SSN info. Here is what I found to work the best:


**[Swagbucks](http://www.swagbucks.com/)**

Swagbucks is awesome. I visit it daily for 1/2-1hour. I use SwagbucksTV with an auto-refresh extension*. 

I keep it running in a separate tab for most of the day. I also do the daily poll, and check special offers. Not all of the special offers are reliable, I have found the most success with *Ad Reward* videos, *Gambit* videos, *RadiumOne*, *Paymentwall*, *Peanut Labs* surveys and videos, and *SponsorPay*. Swagbuck's search is another great way to earn. Lastly referring others are always a great way to earn, but I do not have any active referrals.
 
**Total earnings: $36.00**

*recently the newer videos require a captcha, look for older posted videos if you have this problem

ref-link: http://www.swagbucks.com/refer/alock808


**[Superpoints](http://www.superpoints.com/)**

Superpoints is very similar to Swagbucks, and also great. I check Superpoints daily for 1/2-1hour as well. I use the SuperLucky Button, complete offers, and watch videos. The offers that have worked the best for me are *TrailPay* surveys, *RadiumOne*, and *PaymentWall*. And you can earn points from Swagbucks and Superpoints for the same offers as long as a different email address is used. Referrals again are great if you can get them. I have 10 for Superpoints, just enough to earn a platinum status which gives me extra SuperLucky Button pushes. 

**Total earnings: $30.58** ($25 cashout with no referrals, $10 cashout with 2 referrals)

ref-link: http://superpoints.com/refer/yur_too_late

(more links at bottom)


**[Mechanical Turk](https://www.mturk.com/mturk/welcome)**

Amazon's Mechanical Turk is by far the best way to earn, it accounts for nearly half my earnings. I have focused mostly on surveys, which are great because they don't kick you out after 10mins of screening unlike other survey sites. But there is also a lot of work with freelance writing, transcriptions, and usability testing. I use it 4-5 days a week for 1-3hours. 

**Total earnings: $84.06**

**[CashCrate](http://www.cashcrate.com/)**

Similar to Swagbucks and Superpoints. I use it daily 10-45mins. I complete offers, watch videos, and complete surveys. I have found the offers and surveys on CashCrate to be less reliable than the other websites. 

**Total Earnings: $18.63** ($20 cashout)

ref-link: http://www.cashcrate.com/3191363/

**[Opinion Outpost](http://www.opinionoutpost.com/)**

I have just recently started using Opinion Outpost, it is pretty straight forward, a survey site. It can be frustrating filling out screening portions and not getting paid, but the website is worth checking.

**[NeoBux](http://www.neobux.com/)**

NeoBux is a ad-click website, I haven't made much money with it yet, but it allows you to rent more referrals, so I will be experimenting with that. 

**Total Earnings: $.57**

ref-link: http://www.neobux.com/?r=alock808

**[Gomez Peer](https://www.gomezpeerzone.com/login.aspx)**

Gomez peer is a passive program I leave running in the background, it earns me money as I use the internet. It has not made me much, but could if you use the referral program. 

**Total Earnings: $.70**

**Others**

Apply for a job with [LionBridge](http://en-us.lionbridge.com/Default.aspx?LangType=1033), I've heard good things. 
[SurveySavvy](https://www.surveysavvy.com/ss/ss_index.php?action=home) is just like Opinion Outpost, worth checking out.
[Vagex](http://vagex.com/?ref=58273) is also popular, a video viewer that you can rig up to refresh automatically.

I did not find [InboxDollars](http://www.inboxdollars.com/) worth it, it has a $30 cashout and was not very reliable, I would avoid it.

**Suggestions**

When you complete offers it is very repetitive, utilize your browsers auto-fil features, make it so it uses the fake information. Sometimes offers require you to confirm email addresses to obtain the points. I would check my fake email address daily and confirm any emails. Not all the offers will work, but it is easy enough to just do them all.
If you can get a strong referral base, which I am starting to try to do now, you can earn a lot more. But even without referrals these programs are worth it.

I will pay you $25 via paypal (or send you a game through Steam if that's your thing--from the list of what I currently have available) for posting 40 or more flyers throughout your campus in the fall. You don't have to post all the flyers at once, but you don't get paid until you do. You are going to need to take pictures of the flyers you post. I ask that you only post in places you are allowed to post, so no spamming people's parked cars or shoving stuff in mailboxes. You are responsible for the costs of printing, though most schools offer at least some amount of free printing so if you aren't sure whether yours does or not, ask around.

You will also get 10% from any essay that comes in from your campus. I create unique discount codes for each campus so that I can track where submissions are coming from.

You will also get a 20% discount that will never expire if you want to make use of our editing services. You can use the coupon code I give you twice, and if you want you can transfer it to a friend, too.

I am also interested in hiring an editor comfortable with the hard sciences and technical documents. The combo of comfort with science and good writing/editing ability is hard to find. If you want to work as an editor, you will need an elance profile (free to create).

EDIT: I am still looking for people, but I am going to do this the smart way now.  If you are interested in participating or editing, please fill out this form:

1371139595.0,50,self.beermoney,1g9wgr,"Introducing ""Tooyoou"" - Passively earn on your Android device!",68,18,65,http://www.reddit.com/r/beermoney/comments/1g9wgr/introducing_tooyoou_passively_earn_on_your/,"**What is it?**

The app is called “Tooyoou” and it is currently in open beta which uses some of your homescreen to send you ads. Here is a [link](http://tooyoou.com/howitworks) to the site where it explains how it works.

**How do I earn?**

You earn by installing the application and having a widget on your homescreen. In this widget, they will show various ads that do not have any sound or distracting flashing. If you click on each new ad that comes through that is setup to pay for clicking on it you earn $0.10 and you seem to get about half a cent through just having it shown. 

**What are some caveats?**

The main issue that I could find is that it could be a big data hog so I would suggest using it when you are on Wifi or on an actual unlimted plan. I, personally, do not know how it impacts battery life for I am using an old android phone which is always plugged in.

**How fast can you earn?**

Personally, I just joined the application and in the span of about ten or so minutes I have earned $0.62. It rotates a new ad every ten minutes or if you do any of the following:

•	Connectivity to data or wireless network has changed.

•	You have checked your account balance.

•	You have saved your preferences using “Your Choice”.

**What is this “Your Choice”?**

It is their way of having targeted ads pointed your way. What you do is state your general age, gender and interests thus the ads will change accordingly. It is optional and only if you want to see targeted ads.

**How can you get paid?**

It appears that you can be paid once a month through Paypal. You must have a pending balance of $5.00 for it to send the money to your Paypal account. You can also download apps to earn “points” but I do not know the point to dollar ratio for you must have 2500 points to get a gift card. From the website where I found out about the application, the poster claimed that they have been using it for five or so months and have gotten about $450 from it all. I, personally, cannot vouch for this amount of earning for I am quite new to it. I am mainly submitting it here so that other people can find out about it.

**Where can I find this application?**

You can find it on the Google Play Store under the title “Tooyoou” or at this [link.]( https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.tooyoou.android&amp;hl=en)

**Is there a referral system?**

Not that I could find! Good luck in earning!",US &amp; CA,False,,t5_2s5or,False,loc-usca,,True,t3_1g9wgr,http://www.reddit.com/r/beermoney/comments/1g9wgr/introducing_tooyoou_passively_earn_on_your/,

I wanted to share a site that I've been using for three years now. I did a search and nothing popped up so I don't think it's been mentioned here yet. 

It's a site strictly for students (university/college) called Notesolution where you upload notes online for credits. You can then use credits to redeem gift cards in increments of $10. In the past three years I've redeemed up to $50 in Amazon gift cards. 

You can upload documents in pdf or xdoc format and each upload is worth 25 credits for courses that have less than 50 documents uploaded already. You get 10 credits if there are already a lot of notes on that course. Depending on how popular this site is at your school you may get 25 or 10 credits per upload. So far, I've never gotten less than 25 credits per upload, partly due to the fact that not enough people at my school uses it. Every $10 gift card can be redeemed with 800 credits.

There are also plenty of achievements/badges that you can work towards (ex. 25 credits for your first 10 uploads) so for me, it adds up pretty quick. Also, when other people download your notes, you get credits too. If they download lecture notes you receive 10 credits, textbook notes are worth 16 credits and exam notes are worth 24 credits. Once they download it they can rate your notes, so if you take great notes you may get more downloads and therefore more credits.

I take lots of notes in class anyway so getting a little extra money for it is great, especially when I can use that money towards textbooks from amazon. You can also use the credits towards H&amp;M, Starbucks, Cineplex, Chapters and Best Buy if you don't use Amazon. Only downside is they process all the giftcards manually so it takes a week or so for you to receive the gift card, but for me it's okay I don't necessarily always need to use it right away. I never received one of my gift cards one time and I contacted their customer support, they responded within the hour and I got the gift card later that night.

Only thing you have to be careful of is you can't upload notes that are directly from the professor, so you can't just upload their powerpoints and claim them as yours. They only accept self-created content. If they catch it they can revoke your credits.

Anyway, I get 50 credits for each referral, and if you found this helpful I would appreciate it if you use my [referral link](https://notesolution.com/a/24171) . Otherwise here is a [non-referral link](https://notesolution.com) .

Happy studying!

",62,13,27,http://www.reddit.com/r/beermoney/comments/zc3e3/my_little_mini_guide_to_what_i_do_and_what_i_make/,"Here is a little insight to the sites/services I use and how much I make with them. I am not going to go into too much detail. Just list the sites, a short summary and how much I make from them.

A few notes: I am in the US so I can not speak to what countries all these work in, but they do work in the US. Also I use iOS on both an iPhone and an iPad, some of the apps ( I think most are actually) may or may not be available to other smartphone OS's. 

**Starting off first with mobile.**

Bamboo Wallet is an iOS and android app that has you do various things to earn rewards. It has surveys, try apps, complete offers, it is very similar to some of the various websites, but is an app. Accompanying this app is m.junowallet.com that share login info and balance, the site has some different offers and the site is how you access trying apps. If you want to use my referral just enter TH1272839 after creating your account when it asks you for your invite code. Entering an invite code also earns you $0.25 at sign up. I can make about $10 in gift cards every week to week and half with little effort. 

[FreeMyApps](http://m.freemyapps.com/share/url/267a79c6) is an iOS app that has you try out apps for credits, then redeem them for amazon or iTunes cards, as well as various paid apps. Notably they regularly have $1 and $2 amazon cards that are easy to get, so you can cash out often. Worth noting is that it uses your device serial number, not a login, so if you multiple devices you can run this multiple times and cash out 2 or 3 times more often if you have 2 or 3 devices, more if you have more. Income is dependent on how often they add new stuff. But it ranges from $5-$10 in amazon cards every week or so, sometimes less if they don't update, sometimes more if they have a stretch of frequent updates.  [Non-Ref](http://m.freemyapps.com)

[Viggle](http://join.viggle.com/thudia) is an iphone/android app that you watch ads and check into TV shows. Ads very in value and different shows have different bonuses. This site has had it's issues lately by decreasing payouts and earnings, but they are starting to turn that around. Shows are worth less bonus points and stuff cost more to redeem now, but they have been doing a lot of extra stuff to earn points lately. Overall if you never knew the old system it is still OK, but people who were used to it being better are a little disappointed. Average earnings is about $10 in gift cards every 2 weeks or so, depends on how much you watch TV, and if you do any of the activities such as trivia or the upcoming football myguy. 
Edit: they just confirmed no more referral points, so actually, they do suck as much as I thought.

apptrailers and m.appredeem.com these 2 share a points system and login, one has you watch commercials for apps, and one has you install an app and try it. My referral is: skinnylens0
 Just playing with it when I have downtime I have made $15-$30/mo. 

**Websites**

[Superpoints](http://superpoints.com/refer/hudiaebay) is not my favorite but is ok. I pretty much just do the super button and my lucky emails, and occasionally watch a few videos. My monthly income is roughly $5 - $10, I could do more, but don't really care to, not bad for just a minute or two a day though. 

[Neobux](http://www.neobux.com/?rh=6661696C65646A656469) pays for clicking ads. The unique thing here is that you can rent referrals. You can then monitor their performance and recycle them for new ones as needed. This site starts out extremely slow if you don't invest. But if you are willing to invest from the start and rent some referrals, you can earn your money back in a month, and the following month earn much faster if you have good rented referrals. I made $1 my first month, invested $5, cashed out $6. Next month I made 12, cashed out $6, and reinvested $6 into recycling and extending referrals, third month I made $20, cashed out $10 and reinvested $10. So while the earnings are slower than most sites, they increase over time, and you can eventually be making ok beermoney. I usually do only enough to get referral credit for the next day. You have to be active to get credit for referrals, so I just do the minimum and let my rented referrals do the rest. [Non-Ref](http://neobux.com)

[Bing Rewards](http://go.microsoft.com/?linkid=9778718&amp;amp;rrid=CAE0F591-2696-4D99-8BB3-C09C606F7011) This one is slower but easy. Just search bing and get points. Everyones points seem to be different and random as to what the daily cap is. But I spend 3 minutes every morning doing my daily max. Just search and keep hitting related. I usually get about $5 a month from own searches, and another $5 from referral bonus. You only get credit for the first few referrals of the month, everyones number seems to be different, but you won't get more by getting mass referrals. 

[Swagbucks](http://www.swagbucks.com/refer/hudiho) is another common one I am sure you most use. But get points, get rewards. I just spend a few minutes a day at the most on here. I get a point from the toolbar, a point from the poll, 2 from the no strings offers, and 3 from the video survey. I then do a few searches until I get points and I am done for the day. I don't do anything else, but sometimes try to get swag codes. This plus having just a handful of active referrals and I get between $35 and $50 a month in rewards, sometimes I get amazon, sometimes paypal. [Non-Ref](http://www.swagbucks.com)

[GiftHulk](http://www.gifthulk.com/invite/TH98425) is sort of like swagbucks and superpoints combined. Same deal as most sites, do surveys, watch ads, complete offers and get points. But like superpoints there is a treasure chest that rewards random points. The more active you are the more keys (tries) you have to get more random points. Right now I get about $5-$10/mo without doing much, but I am fairly new so I don't know how typical that is.  [Non-Ref](http://gifthulk.com) 

[Quirky](http://www.quirky.com/?r=04552d4bd936c36aaf2c263874361bce) is a site where you get involved in different parts of a products development. You vote on ideas you want to see make it further, help design, help revise designs and get a % of commission for it. When someone buys said product you were involved in, you get a portion of the sale. At first the income is slow, but if you are active for a while you can get some decent profits. Income totally relates to active you are. You can expect not to see any income for a while as products take a while to become real. You start voting at the idea phase, and while you earn the right to income from the product, it might not exist and be for sale for a while. But just spend a few minutes of free time a week voting and taking surveys and eventually you will start getting income on those products when they finally go up for sale. [Non-Ref](http://www.quirky.com)

**Services**

[Topline](https://www.jointopline.com/register?fid=CS6VL7ZJ9H45) is slow paying but 100% passive. You just sign up, install the browser plug in and that is it. It replaces ads on sites with it's ads. It doesn't take up any more space, and isn't intrusive at all. With no referrals you get $10 about every 2-3 months with moderate web browsing. I am online most of the day, and have a handful of very active referrals, and I am able to cash out $10, every 1.5 weeks to 2.5 weeks. So about $20/mo for doing nothing more than installing the plug in, and cashing out. [Non-ref](http://jointopline.com)



So that is what I do and roughly what I earn. I have not been using mturk most of the summer but since school started back up there seems to be enough posted hits that I will probably go back to it. I still do an occasional survey here and there, but not nearly what I could/should be doing. 

If there are any similar sites you think I should join feel free to post referrals in comments. I am always looking to find new sites/services as long as they are not too time consuming. I am also always looking for new apps I can use on the go to earn some beermoney. 

If you have any questions feel free to ask and I will try to answer them as best as I can.

I find myself waiting for this month's payday at Zujava and then it kind of clicked that I've never seen it discussed here and similar sites are also pretty rare. Ref link signups are very much appreciated :)

**My Experience With Zujava**
I've earned $30 with 2 months worth of paydays ([last month's proof](http://i.imgur.com/2wyFTm9.png)). I currently have 10 articles published which are simple reviews/opinions on video games currently.

While $1.50 is kind of below average compared to some of the other writing type sites that pay you up front I want to point out that I earn ~$1.50 per article PER MONTH. And since setting up my account and putting up 10 'test' type articles I haven't actually touched my account at all, to me that is pretty amazing. I plan on spending some time to add to this amount, learn some basic promotion techniques and also producing some higher quality stuff which should only mean more revenue.

I like the idea of growing some passive income rather than requiring constant effort to earn money (like Swagbucks). 

**So What is Zujava?**
Zujava is an online web 2.0 platform where you can publish articles much like Squidoo, HubPages, Wizzley (all of which I have tried and still somewhat use) but Zujava is my favourite right now (read my pros section).

You can publish articles on anything within reason (no R rated content, drugs, gambling etc.) and get paid a portion of the site's revenue for generating the content. 

Creating articles is easy, you put together a page using pre determined sections such as text, youtube, picture, amazon product etc. You don't need to know how to do anything fancy (other than writing!)

**How Does It Work**
Zujava gives 50% of all ad revenue to its publishers and 50% of any Amazon sales (I've made 2 sales by just putting a related product on the page, I actually sold a product I wasn't featuring thanks to the way Amazon works).

Once you publish a page on Zujava its ranked against the other articles on the site and given a ZQ rank (based on traffic, likes from members and a few other things). This ZQ rank is then broken down into 3 tiers known as buckets (10/20/70) and then you'll receive a percentage of the site's earnings based on that (70/25/5). The best performing lenses obviously get the most (top 10% of articles get 70% of site earnings).

Earnings are then paid on a net60 (was net30 when I started) basis (probably the biggest con of the site) but once you get your first payment you'll be rolling in the payments monthly. This is definitely a site for the long term.

**Why Zujava - Pros of Zujava**
-Unlike other sites you don't need an Adsense or Amazon account, you can just start writing (HubPages and Wizzley need your own Adsense account which means a $100 minimum cash out!! That is ridiculous).

-EVERY articles receives some ad revenue because of the % tiers rather than hard cut off values. I disliked Squidoo because you have to be within a certain number to get paid. This way no work is wasted

-Low $5 Cashout to PayPal.

-Friendly community always willing to help and provide feedback.

-Ease of use

-Nice referral program (20% of referral earnings, taken from Zujava's share of course)

-Regular contests to boost earnings/exposure

**Tips/Tricks**
-Always include at least one Amazon module, if a visitor clicks through you'll get credit for anything they purchase within a 24hr period. My 2 current sales have been completely unrelated to the actual products that I featured.

-Make sure you are writing good quality stuff (especially your first 3 pages). Your first 3 pages are hand reviewed to ensure your meeting site standards (quite easy) before you graduate out of the newbie club called the Petting Zu.

-Spend sometime learning some basic SEO (I'm just starting to do this now). Things like how to find good article ideas based on what people are looking for, using good words in titles and throughout the page.

-Always try get some high quality pictures/YouTube videos in there, they are easy to add and look great.

Now, keep in mind I'm new to this and I've only uploaded a handful of videos, but so far i've made about 4 EUR (about 5 usd) with uploading about 4 videos that are ""monetized"". The hardest job is finding good content to upload, it's a very critical audience.

Just use this as a guide and it'll work most of the time. ^

Most of the songs are pretty good so it's not like your bleeding your ears for some quick change. Minimum checkout is 10$ which is actually pretty high, but you can make that in like 2 hours. And your not even working most of the time. Just sit back and listen.

They have a system based off of how ""accurate"" your rating is which is kinda stupid because everyone has their own tastes, but it's not that hard to figure out which songs are 8's and which ones are 2's.
If you rate enough songs correctly, you advance from bronze to silver to gold and so on. In each tier you earn like .01$ more for each comment you make.

I've made almost $45 so far, and haven't spent more than a couple hours a day wi various tactics here. I just want to share what I have had success with and thank you all for your help.

mTurk: Obviously the biggest money maker. I have pulled in almost $30 in just a few days. My reputation on there is terrible though, due to getting about 30 hits rejected when had first began. Hopefully when I get my score up, I can make even more money.

*FeaturePoints: FeaturePoints is my favorite due to how easy it is, and how much they actually pay out per app. The points add up quickly, and you can have $5 in no time. I have it running on my ipad and iPhone and have made about $5 on each, and that's just from an hour today, and a few minutes yesterday. I have a referral code, LB2SSQ (I'm on my ipad and I don't know how to post links), and if you use it, we both win. : ) 

AppTrailers: App Trailers is pretty good/easy, but I don't see it making that much. I've exhausted all the big paying hits and have just been watching 30second ads over and over for 5 points each. I have still made about $5 using it while doing other things. Not a bad wa to earn easy money.

I'm also going to get into GigWalk and Field Agent, but haven't played around with those yet.

Am I missing any good money makers?

What makes this different from other survey sites is that they payout more per survey (about $1-$2) and if you join the QuickReward Panel (which is free to join) they will email you surveys that pay on average about $3-5 per survey.

1357094403.0,44,self.beermoney,15sx7i,International beer money sites: a few starting points (and places to avoid),47,3,24,http://www.reddit.com/r/beermoney/comments/15sx7i/international_beer_money_sites_a_few_starting/,"Happy new year!

A number of you have been asking for recommendations on good websites that welcome international users.  Frustrating how so many places seem to be geared towards Americans, isn’t it?  I’ve seen at least four threads asking this very question over the past few days.  Instead of annoying everyone by spamming my referral links in each one, I might as well make a post listing the sites I use and/or have tried in the past.

I also figured that, with many people resolving to find ways to earn a little extra money in the coming year, this subreddit will be flooded with posts asking for recommendations.  [The FAQ](http://www.reddit.com/r/beermoney/comments/137t1x/rbeermoney_faq/) has a good list, but it does not mention any age or geographic restrictions each of those sites have, so deciding where to start can be overwhelming.

### Some things to keep in mind (especially if you’re entirely new to all of this)

* Create a dedicated email account for your GPT activities because you will receive **a lot** of messages.  You may also need to have several throwaway addresses to complete various offers (which involve signing up for things that will give you tons of spam).  Having a P.O. box and/or Google Voice number is a plus, but not necessary.

* Don’t register on too many sites at once or you’ll feel overwhelmed.  Start off with one or two places, then add other ones later on, once you’re comfortable using the sites you originally started with.  (Trust me on this; I made the same mistake when I started on my adventure back in mid-August.)

* Trial and error is the only way you can figure out how to establish a solid money-making routine for yourself, especially as all websites work differently for each individual.

* Although plenty of scams are out there, you need to be willing to do some research, take a few small risks, and see what happens.  Only then can you determine if the site is worth your time and effort.

* Write down your referral URLs on a card and keep it handy in your wallet, or make a note of them on your smartphone in case you get an opportunity to promote the sites you’re using in real life.

* Many GPT and PTC websites have strict policies limiting registrations to one account per computer / internet connection / household.  If you are going to refer your relatives or offline friends, make sure they don’t sign up on your computer, or the site will think you’ve created multiple accounts and will permanently ban you for that.  Have them complete the registration process at their home.

* Adding to the above, if you and your relatives or real-life friends have accounts on the same money sites, make sure neither of you logs into your own accounts with each other’s internet connections.  That means don’t use your account on their computer, and don’t let your friend/relative use *their* account on *your* computer.  This can cause the both of you to be banned for multiple account usage.

* Using proxies / VPN is an easy way to get banned from many GPT and PTC websites.

* Don’t access your account on shared/public internet connections unless you’re sure no one has ever logged on to those sites and that your IP address is not known to be part of a VPN.  Use this [advanced proxy check](http://www.whatismyipaddress.com/proxy-check/) to confirm the latter.  Otherwise, you face an increased risk of being suspended from the site.

* Constant disqualification on surveys is normal and happens to everyone.  Don’t give up on them so easily!  Common reasons a survey suddenly terminates halfway through include: failing attention/human checks, providing inconsistent answers, speeding through questions, taking a break halfway through (rarely but can happen), quota already met while you were still answering questions.  Some people here have said you’re better off answering surveys on Amazon Mechanical Turk because you almost never get screened out; however, there are requesters who post surveys that disqualify certain participants or outright reject all submissions to get free data (both of which will get them nasty [turkopticon](http://turkopticon.differenceengines.com/) reviews anyway).  Everything I know about taking paid surveys, I learned from Darkstar2 on ClixSense, a Canadian guy who has been at this for years and used to work in market research.

Please let me know if I have made any mistakes with age / location / payment requirements as listed below.  Unless otherwise stated, most of these sites should work internationally, but not all of them may be accessible or have as many offers available in your country.  Doesn’t hurt to try and see what happens.

### Sites I use that have paid to me

website|countries|minimum age|withdrawal amount|payment methods
|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|
[ClixSense](http://www.clixsense.com/?4857188) ^[non-ref](http://www.clixsense.com/)|worldwide (with [few exceptions](http://www.clixsense.com/en/Helpdesk-FAQ/6-56/))|16|[varies](http://www.clixsense.com/en/Helpdesk-FAQ/6-1/) but generally is $8 via PayPal|PayPal (non-verified accounts OK), Payza, Liberty Reserve, cheque
[NatureClix](http://www.natureclix.com/members/register.php?ref=michelle) ^[non-ref](http://www.natureclix.com/)|worldwide|not specified|$2 (can be lowered to 25¢ with permanent 50¢ upgrade) but $1 for US, CA, UK, AU, NZ|PayPal, Amazon US/CA/UK gift cards

* **ClixSense**, a PTC/GPT hybrid, is my favourite money site at the moment.  Users are paid to click and view ads as well as complete offers, surveys, and tasks.  It also has a ClixGrid game, where you click on a square up to 25 times/day (50 for premium), view an ad for 10 seconds (5 for premium), and hope (if you’re lucky!) to win a few cents.  I joined on December 1st and made a little over $20 in my first month.  I earned $5 on my first week, reached $8 by week 2, and had $15 on Christmas.  Upgraded to premium in my second month and made another $50.  This [ClixSense tutorial](http://moneymakersandsavers.blogspot.com/p/clixsense-tips.html) is a good introduction to the site, although it’s a bit Canadian-centric and some of the things mentioned (like casino search tasks and paid-to-call offers) may not be available to everyone.

* Another PTC/GPT hybrid, **NatureClix** is the fourth Nature* family member operated by Philip.  Ads generally pay 1¢ and 0.5 points each for 30 seconds of viewing (some ads may not award points).  You need to select the right captcha from the dropdown menu before the timer can start.  Multiple ads can be opened in new tabs but you must wait at least 10 seconds before starting the next timer.  Unlike ClixSense, ads do not have to be in focus for the entire time, and Flash is not required for the purpose of validating clicks.  Points can only be used to purchase advertisements on the site; they cannot be converted to cash, unlike on its sister sites.

* **PollBuzzer** pays $1 for each question answered.  All you have to do is click on the answer in your email.  It’s that simple!  Even though PB has not sent me a single question, 2 of my 24 referrals became successful conversions (refs who answered four questions), so I got $2 just for promoting this site.  It’s worth providing your demographic info in case it ever feels like contacting you.

***

In addition, here are more sites that you may want to consider looking into.  I don’t use them—or have yet to do so—due to lack of time and/or interest.  Feel free to post more info about them in the comments.

### Tried but do not use anymore (all non-ref links)

[NatureDollars](http://www.naturedollars.com/)|worldwide|not specified|$0.05|PayPal, Amazon

* **Swagbucks** is one of the biggest and most prominent rewards sites out there.  Has daily poll, NOSO (no obligation special offers—click through offers path and enter captcha to get SB), videos, offers, surveys, games, CrowdFlower tasks, and more.

* **GiftHulk** is a newer site similar to Swagbucks.  Has daily poll, a treasure chest where you can try to win things like extra keys, more hulk coins, or Fountain of Youth codes each day, as well as videos, offers, giveaways, and more.  You can find FoY codes in this subreddit or the [Red Flag Deals forum](http://forums.redflagdeals.com/gifthulk-codes-1123181/).

* **NatureBucks**, **NatureGPT**, and **NatureDollars** are also part of the Nature* family.  I personally don’t see the point of joining all five sites; best to pick one and stick to it.

### Have not yet tried but am planning to in the future

website|countries|minimum age|withdrawal amount|payment methods
|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|
[CloudCrowd](http://www.cloudcrowd.com/i/pn5b9c/) ^[non-ref](http://www.cloudcrowd.com/)|worldwide|18|N/A|PayPal
[SkimaTalk](http://www.skimatalk.com/)|worldwide|18|N/A|PayPal

* **CloudCrowd** is a Facebook app–based crowdsourcing marketplace.  Tasks range anywhere between 1¢ and $30.  Payments for all work successfully completed by 5 PM Pacific will be automatically deposited to your PayPal account by midnight of the next business day.

* **SkimaTalk** connects English-language learners with native speakers via Skype (microphone and webcam required).  Its teachers come from various anglophone countries.  Many of its students are from Japan (UTC+9), though SkimaTalk is expanding to Korea and Italy.  Lessons are $9 for 25 minutes, of which teachers get $7.50; more established teachers can set different rates.  Prospective teachers have to pass a screening interview and teach three free lessons before they can be paid.

[slicethepie](http://www.slicethepie.com/)|worldwide (may not be available in some countries)|not specified|$10|PayPal

* **NaturePrizes** is the fifth member of the Nature* family of sites.  Has more higher-paying surveys, hence the high minimum.

* **Neobux** is the most reputable *bux-type PTC website.  Other legitimate ones that follow a similar model exist, but many of them tank within two years, and known scammy owners tend to open new *buxes every now and then.  Sites like Neobux are such slow earners that investing money in renting referrals is a necessity.  Keep in mind Neobux has strict policies on inactivity and how many computers you can access your account from (best to stick to your home internet connection).  Newly registered users who sign up and do nothing after 72 hours are permanently suspended; other inactive accounts are suspended after 60 days.

* **slicethepie** pays users up to 20¢/track to write music reviews.  The actual amount varies depending on the quality of the review, but more meaningful and well-written ones are most likely to yield maximum pay.  [see also: [How to Write Meaningful Paid Song Reviews on slicethepie](http://chasmac.hubpages.com/hub/slicethepie-reviews/)]

***

### Not recommended

* **Amazon Mechanical Turk:** Your application will be rejected if you select any country other than United States, no exceptions.  Any non-Americans who were fortunate to have an account in the past can only be paid in amazon.com store credit; shipping to other countries is really expensive.  Definitely, absolutely not worth it if you need money but never shop on Amazon.  If you’re looking for crowdsourcing marketplace alternatives, try CloudCrowd (see link above), [Clickworker](http://www.clickworker.com/), [Elance](http://www.elance.com/), [oDesk](http://www.odesk.com/), or [Freelancer](http://www.freelancer.com/).  Although I have not used any of those alternatives, I am sure someone here can vouch for them.

* **InboxDollars:** Only U.S. residents will receive PaidEmails and have offers to do, even though non-Americans can register on the site.  Stick to ClixSense instead.

* **Topline:** Self-explanatory if you’ve been keeping up with /r/beermoney over the last two months.  I actually do like passive methods; too bad they don’t work in practice.  No alternatives to recommend.

* **[PaidViewpoint](http://www.paidviewpoint.com/?r=fromsilentsky):** ^[non-ref](http://www.paidviewpoint.com/) The fact that it pays international users 7¢ less than its American counterparts for each trait survey makes it not worth recommending.  Not to mention the $15 minimum, applicable PayPal transaction fees are deducted from these earnings, and referral system that only pays when a ref cashes out.  I actually don’t have much interest in paid survey sites, and Pinecone isn’t accepting new registrations, so again, no other alternatives to recommend.  (Other than maybe PollBuzzer.  Also threw in referral link in case anyone wants to try PaidViewpoint for fun.)

* **[FusionCash](http://www.fusioncash.net/?ref=fromsilentsky):** ^[non-ref](http://www.fusioncash.net/) U.S. 13+ and Canada 18+ only.  Great site for Americans, but Canadians are limited to making $599 per calendar year there, have less offers available, and do not get any paid emails or PTC ads.  Also, earnings from successfully credited offers expire 180 days (6 months) after they are first posted to your account, so cashing out as soon as possible is highly recommended.  ClixSense is a much better alternative.

* **LikeCash:** Joined after seeing it mentioned here a few months ago but found it to be a dud.  It rarely, if ever, has any new Facebook pages to like.  [LiketoCash](http://www.liketocash.com/ref/6428) ^[non-ref](http://www.liketocash.com/) is a better alternative.

3. Each page could have a random referral generator (each referral link can only be entered once so that it is fair).

Wanted to post some free stuff that I've recently taken advantage of.

First off an Amazon Gift Certificate for $25 for doing a short email based or chat interview. I received my gift certificate the other day and it's all legit. Go here http://www.ucalgary.ca/selfhelp/ do the survey and they'll send you the information for the interview. It took me a while, over an hour to complete the interview questions but I took my time and actually quite enjoyed it. It's on the topic of personal developments books, it was a good reflection.

Second is $50 free from ING direct for opening up an account. This is the easiest of the two and takes the least amount of time literally 3 minutes. Just go to the website www.ingdirect.ca click ""Sign Me Up"" then ISA account. Give them your information including the Orange Key 39021172S1, then put a $100 cheque in the mail made out to yourself and voila you get $50 free and I also get $50 for free. 

It's a promotion until the end of December. Just remember to use the Orange Key 39021172S1 and that the minimum deposit is $100 to get the promotion. There are also no restriction, you can transfer the money whenever you want and there are no fees. 

Anyway, enjoy :)

Don't spend more time than necessary.Here are some tips for passive/quick money.",55,10,20,http://www.reddit.com/r/beermoney/comments/10ah8w/psa_earning_beermoney_can_be_addicting_to_the/,"When I first joined this subreddit, I jumped on any money-making opportunity posted that seemed to have a ounce of legitimacy. I opened accounts with dozens with ad-revenue sharing startups, watched hundreds of videos, and failed more surveys than anyone could ever imagine.

You see, I needed money. Or at least I thought I did. I was a college student living on a shoestring budget, so I needed as much extra money as possible for paying bills, books and, of course, beer. I devoted a good time to several sites, to the point where I became absorbed in collecting as much points or virtual dollars as possible.

I had daily routines, mainly focused around [Swagbucks](http://swagbucks.com). I spent a lot of free time clicking through surveys, making searchs, and watching those stupid SwagbucksTV videos (""How many vietnam vets does it take to screw in a lightbulb?"" Shut up!)

I made pretty good money from all these sites, and was able to pay off some things and purchase some others, but then I started to wonder: Was this worth my time?

A swagbucks video credits 10% of 3 bucks every minute. For many beermoney novices, that won't make any sense, but basically, I had to watch 1500 videos to earn a $5 Amazon gift card.

That's 25 hours of non-stop videos for 5 non-liquid bucks. Sure, that's 5 more dollars than I would have made not doing it (since I would watch vids in the background outside of class and work and social stuff). But that's a fucking waste of time, even if it was minimal effort to click/set up bots.

Since graduating college, I have become much busier, with a full time job (yes, those still exist) and kind of a social life. So i made it an effort to focus only on **EASY, PASSIVE and QUICK beermoney options.**

**Swagbucks** [ref](http://www.swagbucks.com/refer/theninjason) [non-ref](http://www.swagbucks.com) - The one that started the addiction... I have since limited myself to just using the Android Swagbucks Mobile TV App. You can use your android phone, or bluestacks for Windows if you don't have one, to run the app and earn 50 swagbucks a day. It's completely automated, so the videos run non-stop. Just set it up and do something else. It's capped at 50, so in 9 days you'll have $5.

Searching manually is not passive, so I found a bot that will run searches for you! Make sure you're logged into your bing account, and just click on the toolbar on this page (looks fishy, but it's not. trust me): [http://vartan.net46.net/bb/](http://vartan.net46.net/bb/) In less than a minute, your daily search cap will be met!

**Apptrailers** (Smartphone app): The least passive of the three, but it's dead easy and since it's on your phone, you can take it with you and do other stuff. This app basically gives you at least .5 cents to watch short trailers for smartphone apps. Videos are run with ads, and total around 1 minute in run time (you can exit after the ad and still be credited).

You can redeem paypal and amazon gc's at low amount (15 cents and 1 dollar, respectively). And though it requires pressing, its super easy and you can do it to kill some time. I was able to watch videos while typing up this guide!

Don't get too caught up with this app. Remember, it's only half a penny. Have you walked by a penny on the street and not bothered to pick it up? Well, imagine you found half of one. It wouldn't be worth it... because it's worthless... because it's damaged. Hmm. My analogy didn't work as I thought it would.

Use the app when you have down time. I sometimes press on it at work (might as well get DOUBLE PAID!)


There is no referral link, so if you want to help a brother out, type in the name **'doobiebrother'** when it asks if you were referred! much appreciated if you do, no biggie if you don't.

----

I've found that these three take littler to no time off of your day, and post some noticeable returns. The only time-consuming money maker I would recommend is amazon's mturk, but that counts as actual work. I've found these three to be virtually passive.

Your time is better off spent on learning something new, doing something new or just going out. Invest in yourself before you chase after pennies and dimes.

1336702402.0,46,self.beermoney,thj1f,"The most comprehensive and detailed SuperPoints guide on the Internet. Guides, advice and proof included. *LONG*",63,17,23,http://www.reddit.com/r/beermoney/comments/thj1f/the_most_comprehensive_and_detailed_superpoints/,"Hello again fellow seekers of beermoney. Since Swagbucks seems to be on it's way out as the go-to cash-grab that it was a few months prior, I decided to talk about how lucrative SuperPoints.com can be. I will begin this *incredibly* long post with a picture of my earnings that proves how lucrative Superpoints can be if you just devote a bit of time to it. Take note of how often I cash-out.

[Screenshot of my earnings.](http://i.imgur.com/KOHtY.png) 

I have decided to post this because I constantly see people mention Superpoints with disdain or with little good to say about the site. It always seems to boil down to an inability to gather referrals, or simple misunderstandings about the website and it's offers, surveys, e-mails and the SuperLucky button itself. But I am here to prove that those things have little to do with the *ideal* earning potential that Superpoints offers.

First, and most importantly, I will say that the biggest earning potential in Superpoints lies in your hands, as the user- not in the SuperLucky button, not in referrals, not in paid e-mails and bonus referral links. The greatest earning potential lies in Offers, knowing which offers to complete, which offers to avoid like the plague, and which offers can be trusted.

In this guide, I plan on going into *great* detail about the many offers that can be found on Superpoints, the ""offer vendors"", as I call them, and which offers should be avoided, completed, and how to complete offers without ever worrying about acquiring unwanted charges to your credit card- Yes, your credit card, because in order to really milk Superpoints for all its worth, you must be willing to use a credit card to complete the more lucrative offers.

If you viewed my earnings screenshot, you'll see that I have been a member of Superpoints since October '11 and in that time I have not been charged *one unexpected dime to my credit card*. I would venture a guess and say I have completed well over 100 offers on Superpoints, and after each and every offer I completed that required my credit card, there were certain steps I took that **insured** I would not accidentally be charged, or that I wouldn't accidentally forget to cancel a free trial. I will list those steps now-

If I signed up to Netflix through Superpoints today, I would take the following steps to insure that I would not screw up and accidentally *pay money* instead of being *paid money*.

* Get a piece of paper that you can store in an easily accessible location
* Write down your Netflix account info and password
* Write down the date you signed up to Netflix
* Write down the date the Netflix trial ends
* Write down the phone number or website address needed to cancel the trial (www.netflix.com/cancel) for example

With that *all* of that information on an easily accessible piece of paper that you can see daily thus constantly be reminded, you will not accidentally be charged the membership fee at the end of your one-month Netflix trial. This is an **absolutely necessary** precaution to take once you begin completing multiple offers that charge you once your trial membership period ends.

The free-trial period varies greatly between the various offers. Some are 5 days, some are 7 days, some are 2 weeks, and some last a month. The key is knowing exactly when each offer will charge your credit card, and cancelling two or three days before then.

----

**The following is the most comprehensive Offers guide that has ever been on beermoney. If you follow this guide to the letter, you can cash out $65 TODAY.**

----

I mentioned ""offer vendors"" earlier in this post. I will post a screenshot of what I mean by that.

[These](http://i.imgur.com/PDN6q.png?1) are the Offer Vendors. They can be found when you click **Get Points** and select **Complete Offers**. When you access that page, you are viewing the offers by TrialPay, by default. **TrialPay is the most reliable and trustworthy of the five Offer Vendors.** You are guaranteed to receive Superpoints when you correctly complete their offers, and most of them are very lucrative free trials or service/products that you may be interested in.

Here I will list my choices for TrialPay's most lucrative offers. At the end of my post I will add up all the points of the TrialPay offers to show you how much money you stand to earn if you were to complete all of the offers I list.

**Netflix**!! - For 800 points, you are asked to sign-up for a *one-month long* free trial of Netflix. Netflix is an amazing service if you're paying a couple dollars a month for it. To be *paid* money to sign up to Netflix is almost too good to be true! *Cancel on their site.*

**Stamps.com** - 700 points - Stamps.com is a wonderful offer as well, especially if you mail letters regularly. If you don't need stamps, you can sign up for the four-week trial and cancel before you're charged. *I believe you cancel by calling. Always check the website for information on how to cancel.*

**BigFish Games** - 700 points - This is a lucrative offer, but you must spend money to make money, as they say. Sign up and purchase a game (any game that doesn't have ""Collector's Edition in its title) for $2.99 using the coupon code, **New299**. Be sure not to sign up for their recurring membership. *Nothing needs to be cancelled if you do not sign up to their monthly service.*

**Gamefly** - **1000** points - A great service for gamers! For $5.95 a month, you can sign up to their service and, similar to Netflix, they have a wide selection of video games that you can choose to have mailed to you and play them to your hearts content for a month. *Cancel on their website before your first month so you won't be charged for two months.*

**FreeCreditScore.com** - 900 points - 7-day trial membership. Your typical credit checking service. **Be very careful where you click**, you may be charged $29.95 if you misclick and request a special type of credit check. *Check their website on how to cancel.*

**PushPlay** - 350 points - Free trial. Media streaming service. 5-day free trial. *Be sure to note the trial length and how to cancel the trial*

**RealPlayer Superpass** - 500 points - Free 14-day trial. *Call 1-866-212-1343 to cancel*

**AudioBooks.com** - 700 points - Free trial, despite what the offer page says. Sign up and cancel before you are charged. *Cancel by calling a number, find it on their website.*

**VistaPrint** - 500 points - Get 250 free business cards that you can print *anything you want on*, I personally chose to make cards that say ""You park like a jerk"", you can imagine how I use them. You must pay shipping and handling, this is no trial. I believe S+H was $2 or $3. *I don't believe there is anything to cancel, be sure to check their site, though.*

**Rhapsody** - 250 points - Music service that is pointless with the creation of Spotify. 14-day trial. *Cancel on their website or by calling. I would suggest calling.*

**Lumosity**! - 200 points - A 14-day trial to a very fun website that has all kinds of brain exercise games and puzzles. I thoroughly enjoyed using their site for 2 weeks. *Cancel online, very easy process*

**Activate a FREE Mint.com Account** - 100 points - I believe this is budgeting software. They are legit and can be trusted, you are asked to link your credit card to their site and they help you budget and manage your money. *I don't believe they charge any money, but make sure to check or deactivate/unlink your account if you don't feel safe.*

----

I have personally completed every offer I just listed above, and if you complete them all, you will earn a quick and pretty ~**SIXTY-FIVE DOLLARS**. If you follow all of my steps, there is no reason that you'll be charged more than $10 or so dollars to complete those offers.


Instead of offering details for individual offers for other Offer Vendors, I will instead offer the same guidelines I follow.

* Hunt for Offers that pay less than 10 Superpoints. They usually only require an e-mail address or they are a video. I would suggest an extra e-mail address, or using g-mail as your primary e-mail account. Their spam filter is top notch.

* Avoid Offers that say ""Play _____ for Free!"" they are typically full of mal-ware and spy-ware. They can usually be found on the pages of the Offer Vendor, Matomy. I don't really suggest using that Offer Vendor. Most of their Offers are down-right malicious and/or don't pay.

* Hunt for Offers that request you to install a Facebook app. They always pay out and when you authorize the Facebook app on your Facebook account, you can choose for Only You to be able to see the posts the apps make on your wall. The Apps can be deleted as soon as you are credited points on Superpoints.

* RadiumOne is a pretty good Offer Vendor. They offer many of the same sffers as TrialPay, but you can't do the same offer twice. Their low paying offers, such as Ubokia, DealChicken, Google Offers, SavingStar are very simple, low paying offers that are worth doing. *Also, if you see the **eMusic** offer available on RadiumOne, sign up for their 7-day free trial for 140 points. Note when and how to cancel.*

* Don't waste your time on surveys. They are not worth the time at all. If you want to do surveys, do them on [mTurk](http://mturk.com).

SuperPoints fulfills their gifts on Mondays and Tuesdays, no matter when you request your gift, so don't worry. If you earn the points and the gifts, you will surely receive them. Be patient young grasshoppa.

If you read all of this, **thank you!** Be sure to ask any and every question you have after reading this. I have nothing but spare time to answer all of your concerns.

I'll break them up by the services I've signed up for after browsing this sub for a few days.

Swagbucks: Ok, this is where I have spent the most time so far and seen the most ""reward."" I signed up last night and am already over 100 swagbucks. I notice when I am watching the tv app on my phone or through the sbtv widget toolbar I can fast forward through the ads; seemingly without penalty. Is this a good technique? Am I in danger of getting banned? And can I watch from my phone and laptop at the same time. Also, with the surveys do I have to take time to really fill them out or will I get points faster if I just Christmas tree?

Bing Rewards:
Signed up for this based off of someone's post, but I've kind of hit a wall. I breezed through the tours and started searching. Had 44 bing reward points within about 15 minutes, but I can't seem to get anymore. None of y searches reward me anything anymore. Is there a cap per time limit or something? What is the best way to stack up points? 

mTurk (sp): the amazon ""Hit"" thing. I've signed up, but my registration is processing. It seems to be the general opinion that this is the quickest rewarding for smallest effort task. What all should I expect getting into this?

I've been actually making around $100 a month on Clixsense, so I thought I'd tell you guys about it. It's really simple, you should be able to make around 3.5 dollars a day, so that's more than $100 a month. Here are the steps you should take:



Complete the **Daily Checklist bonus**. The *minimum* you have to do is: 

1. 2 ads a day (6-50 seconds)

2. 15 clicks on ClixGrid (150 seconds)

3. Visit a page on the forum (1 second)

4. 10 Tasks OR 2 Offers (Or a combination of 1 Offer and 5 Tasks)

I don't really bother with clicking on ads because it gets you a tiny amount of money (mostly less than a cent per ad), and ClixGrid won't get you much except if you are lucky (I have almost 1000 clicks and only one $0.35)

I don't really do any Tasks either, I mostly focus on the offers, since they get you the most money. I only do the **daily surveys**, because other's mostly don't work (daily surveys give you $0.7-$1.5).

Do all that, and you'll get a daily checklist bonus (about $0.15), which should help a bit to reach you daily goal of 3.5 dollars.

You can check your Daily Checklist status on your account page.

**Payouts**

Payouts are done twice a week, on Monday 10PM GMT and Friday 10PM GMT. Minimum payout is $8. A verified PayPal account is **NOT** required!

**Upgrading to Premium**

Honestly, it's only worth it if you have a lot of referrals, and it gets you more chances on ClixGrid, but anyways, you don't really get that much on ClixGrid.

Earnings are randomly paid out on each line of text posted (just don't spam) and as you take part in the community more your ranking is increased and you earn more. Some other features of the site are:
  
*Node.js compatibility for easily scripting bots and such. You're limited only by what you can come up with
*Ability to tip other users with your earned money (or be tipped!)
*Custom rooms so you can have your own place; and yes, earnings are paid out in the custom rooms as well!
*Payments are made via Bitcoins (a crypto-currency that I'm sure most of you are aware of); minimum payment of only 5 mBTC (0.005 BTC)

There's probably more that I'm forgetting. If there are any questions please feel free to ask and I'll answer to the best of my ability! Feel free to join up and hang out with us in the chat; it is moderated as well (although the moderators are lenient in most cases) so the majority of the trolling is removed.  

I'm not going to say that you'll become rich off the chat, because you won't, but you are rewarded for taking part in conversations and we almost always have some interesting ones going on! There is also a referral system so bring your friends!

MGM hotels has launched this game on Facebook, known as MyVegas. It's pretty much online slots, but with the intention that you 'earn' loyalty chips that you can then use to redeem for free rewards. It takes a bit of time and effort, but it's a great way to pay for your vacation to Vegas. It's run by a company called PlayStudios, who will try to sell you chips, but this isn't a necessity to earn your comps. I started playing in January, and had an awesome trip in May that was very heavily comped because of MyVegas.

You can redeem for a variety of things, including hotel, food &amp; beverages, show tickets, night club access &amp; services, spa services, etc...

When you have something that you don't need anymore, but don't want to trash, you tend to give it away. Sometimes they go to friends, sometimes you post them on Craigslist. But there's no system based on merit or need. Listia intends to become the epicenter for giving away free things. By doing things like signing up, giving away free items, and more, users can build up credits and bid on free items. When you join Listia, you get 500 credits. You earn more credits every time you list an item and other users bid on it. Then you can use your credits to buy cool things other people are giving away. The highest bidder wins, so each item goes to the person who wants it most! Getting more credits is easy, fun and most importantly, costs nothing!

**Here's how it works:**

* You sign up and are automatically given 500 credits.
* You can use those credits to bid on free items - everything from iPods to magnets to books to recipes.
* At the end date, the bid with the most credits wins.

I have personally been using this site for nearly a year now, and I have seen great success with it! I have gotten many free things such as Amazon gift cards, Xbox games, PC games, headphones, a jacket, a hat, and much more! I have virtually lost nothing, because I have just given away things that have no value to me anymore. 

My past point: Referrals are not essential, but appreciated. They benefit you, as well as me so everybody wins! There is nothing negative to it unless you dislike others benefiting from your actions. If that's the case, then... whatever. Also, if you use the referral, you will get a bonus 100 credits, as well as 500 bonus credits when you complete your first listing!

The only other decent answer that I've come up with is to use [Fusioncash's](http://www.fusioncash.net/?ref=bugabuga) / [non](http://www.fusioncash.net) RadioLoyalty Program.  It's basically an internet radio that I leave on in the background all day while I'm doing work.  Every 10 minutes a code pops up, you enter it, and it's worth 1 cent.   By doing that I've netted about 50 cents a day for the past few days, which is about what you get from Swagbucks TV.  It doesn't sound like much, but if you're in a situation where you can keep the radio on all day, it takes almost zero effort.

I did a short summary in another thread before.

There are things you could run on the computer you are using all the time and almost not notice them. There are some that cause some clutter. There are even some that might come with some malware and should be run on an old computer you don't care about or a VM. Also note that most of the time you will be downloading and running programs on your computer, so it always has to be taken with a grain of salt and I can only speculate on the level of danger involved. 

**Disadvantages I found are italic**

-----------------------------------------------

**THINGS THAT SEEM OKAY EVEN FOR YOUR NORMAL COMPUTER**

--------------------------------------------
Gomez PEER - [referal-link](http://www.gomezpeerzone.com/application-apply/?Referrer=spoid) | [normal link](http://www.gomezpeerzone.com)

- download a tool to whore out some of your bandwith to help companies check their websites, not really noticeable
- have to wait for account activation, can take 3 days (me) or weeks
- earnings depend on where you are, mine makes about 40 cents a day, limit is $45/month
- $5 cashout minimum, pays via PayPal or AliPay
- runs smooth, can be turned off anytime, nothing else required
- *WINDOWS only*

**/IMPORTANT EDIT/ You have to download the client and run it after applying. They are checking your computer specs, online times and god knows what so they can decide to activate you. Not many people signed up under me, but those that I can see probably didn't do this.**

--------------------------------------------

Meta Trader 5 - [link](http://cloud.mql5.com/de/download)

- download a tool to sell out some of your CPU idle time
- easy download and setup, tool creates one ""agent"" for each of your CPU's cores
- unnoticeable most of the time (depends on your cores), sometimes noticeable for 10-20 minutes a day (quad-core)
- what you earn seems to vary with the number of your CPU cores and where you live
- seems to have no Cash-Out minimum, pays via PayPal and WebMoney
- runs smooth, can be turned off anytime, nothing else required

--------------------------------------------

Mega Youtube Views - [referal-link](http://megayoutubeviews.com/register-form.php?r=17894) | [normal link](http://megayoutubeviews.com)

- Auto-view youtube videos in an unused browser tab
- payrate is insane for an automated service, without downtime almost $1 a day...
- *... but there's rumors of them not paying everywhere (of course people also claim that they have been paid). You don't really have anything to lose though, and if they actually do pay you, it was well worth it. I actually put my bets on the $4.00 VIP account. Wish me luck XD*
- $0.30 cashout minimum, via PayPal
- *might crash sometimes and need a refresh. Get an auto-reload-plugin for your browser and flashblock. Preferably use Firefox. Disable sound.*

-----------------------------------------

Vagex - [referal-link](http://vagex.com/?ref=94533) / [normal link](http://vagex.com/)

- Auto-view youtube videos in a downloadable tool + browser tab + android(the more, the better)
- has been around longer than Mega Youtube Videos, looks legit
- about $0.25 a day
- $10 cashout minimum, via PayPal, AlertPay and Skrill(MoneyBookers) 
- smooth for me so far (2 days running), disable sound
- another obvious advantage is that it sounds like vaginal medicine
- *WINDOWS only*

-----------------------------------------

**Probably not recommendable if it's your main computer without a VM:**

------------------------------------------

SurfMore - [referal-link](http://www.surfmore.eu/index.php?ref=spoiderman) | [normal link](http://www.surfmore.eu/)

- auto-view web pages in a browser-tab that doesn't give you captchas or shit (RARE!)
- lots of additional active ways of getting credits for clicking/E-Mails, but not obligatory
- about $0.24 / day right now (special week), usually more around $0.06
- $4.00 payout minimum, pays via PayPal (pays since 2005)
- *not too smooth, runs for a long time with an auto refresh addon. However there can be black sheep among the web sites you view. Those can make your browser crash or even contain viruses. Disable chinese websites in the options. Use their downloadable tool which can deactivate JavaScript. Use FlashBlock and a popup blocker. I'm using an auto refresher every 15 minutes and a tool called [Knas Restart](http://www.knas.se/Applications/Restarter.aspx) to restart Firefox from crashes.*

------------------------------------------

20dollars2surf.com  - [ref-link](http://en.20dollars2surf.com/?ref=527710) | [normal link](http://en.20dollars2surf.com)

- *SLOW EARNER, $1 per month, $20 cashout minimum... but trustworthy*
- Traditional surfbar that occupies part of your screen. Also spawns popups. 
- no attention check (rare)

----------------------------------------

CashGopher 

- *this one's more of a warning so I won't provide a link. *
- *It pays around 0,003 cents a day and does god knows what with your bandwith and computation power.*

-----------------------------------------

**LOW MAINTENANCE (almost automatic)**

---------------------------------------

PollBuzzer - [ref-link](http://www.pollbuzzer.com/?r=ABvYUpS%2bJWg%3d) | [normal link](http://www.pollbuzzer.com)

- famous here already, sends you a mail every 2-3 weeks, you have 24 hours to click it and get $1.00 on your PayPal immediately. That's ALMOST no work. A must have in my book.

Hey everyone, Hanna from Locket here. Late and been surviving on 4 hours of sleep in the past gazillion hours so feel free to skip to the bottom and not read my (perhaps un-understandable) post. 

Been tracking a lot of Locket posts and I know it shows up quite a few times here. Sometimes a little too much, tsk tsk guys who just post a referral link with no info. 

Because of this, just wanted to give you guys an update. We removed the 3 cent hourly cap. Now, before you guys go jumping for joy thinking you'll now earn thousands of dollars per year... we now pay for every new ad you see of the day. As in, if we have 50 ads running. You could get 50 cents per day. 100 ads running... a dollar per day. However, say you see an ad for Sharpie today. Then the same exact ad tomorrow... you'll still get paid once for today and once for tomorrow. 

We've gotten a number of complaints saying we sometimes show ads but not pay. And with this system you'll at least get paid once for each ad. 

Now, gonna be straight forward and completely honest. You're not going to earn much at all in the beginning. Especially for beer money users since a number of you actually track and make sure you swipe every hour. The reason is, we don't have very many advertisers. It takes a long time to get a partnership, get creatives, get approval etc. 

Once we get advertisers we're hoping people will get more than a dollar per day. We don't think we'll put more than 150 ads on the lock screen (average times we look at lock screens without Locket app is 150 times). But it's a lot more than the .30 average people have been getting. Will take time so I don't blame you guys for signing out/uninstalling and then picking it up a few months down the road. 

I know how you guys enjoy calculating earnings. Sorry that it'll be off. First year? Hmm perhaps about the same or a tiny bit more than calculated earnings from before. Second year, it should be a lot more.

Also, the kicker, and the thing that I hope will be changed asap. Cash out limit has been raise to $20. I know sucks. But, better than iBotta's first few months. They completely stopped all cash outs for a period of time. We're doing this first, cause of fraud. Second, because we don't get paid from our advertisers until after a month or so after an ad runs. Calculate our seed funding with the number of users we have... yeah...

You have until tonight (August 15) to cash out your $10. Close? We put in Aarki so you can earn a few extra dollars and cash out today. Otherwise, $20 limit and we're just paying everyone on August 25th. 

Oh also referral bonuses are gone by the end of tonight. Gonna bring it back though.

**tl;dr 3 cent cap removed. Now you'll get paid for every new ad you see of the day. Cash out raise to $20. Payments now all paid on a day of the month. Offer wall added to earn a bit extra.**

So, a lot of people give you bing rewards, and then say just search. Maybe they link to a search bot or extension, I dunno. But a lot of people can miss the inner workings of it and places you can pick up a little extra per day.

So you start out and you don't really have anything. You're a basic user. A Member. You get the credits for searching and the credits for the daily clicks (found by clicking your ribbon in the upper right and cycling through) However, a lot of people on here don't tell you about the tours. Go [here](). Do the welcome tour for some credits. Then hit the ""Explore Bing"" tab under the tours tab. You can earn more credits through this.

Make sure you keep your searches consistent. Why? So you can upgrade to a Silver account. To do this, complete those two tours I told you about (Welcome to Rewards and Explore), earn 200 lifetime credits, and set a reward as your goal (don't have to earn it, though with 200 credits, you probably will earn it if it's MS Points). This nets you 50 bonus credits and the ability to do a few more credits' searching per day and ups your referrals to 5 friends for five each.

Then, get Gold Status. Buy your first reward (doesn't have to be the set one), earn 750 credits (lifetime, not on you, just like the 200), and do 150 searches per month (20 per day will count so you need to show up for 7 1/2 days out of the month and hit the max). This nets you 5% discount on MS points and gold subs, 10% discount on everything else, and you can now earn 30 credits per day for searching and your referrals are upped to 10 credits per friend, 10 friends. Now you can get 100 MS points in roughly 4 days as opposed to the week-ish from before, for about 800 MS points a month (you can buy other stuff, but most just use it for the points).

I went into such detail because most don't, and because I'm at that gold status and if I can get the ten referrals I'll have 100 credits which will net me 100 more ms points with just one days searching.

I love going on just to get ideas for my own outfits, but I recently discovered their Look Points program.

Basically, every dollar you spend gets you 1 Look Point. After you reach 2000 Look Points, you get a $20 site credit. While this seems like a horrible deal at first, they actually offer way more ways to get the Look Points.

If you create an account, you get 10 points just for logging in each day. You can then earn up to 50 points each day for tweeting or liking the outfits on Twitter and Facebook. Each tweet and like is worth 10 points.

I just created a spam Twitter feed and go and immediately unlike the outfits on my Facebook. I figure earning roughly 50 - 60 Look Points a day will get you the $20 credit in just a little over a month.

There's tons of new stuff on the site and a fair amount under or right at $20. I haven't quite reached the credit mark, but I will definitely update when I do!

Here's a [referral link]( http://www.DailyLook.com/?refMemberID=434561157281288352) that will get you $10 off your first purchase if you do decide to actually buy anything. Not sure if it works with the site credit, but maybe!

&gt;
&gt;Dear InfoArmy Researcher,
&gt;
&gt;InfoArmy launched last June. Since that time we have worked together trying to create an innovative new business model that would allow many researchers to eventually earn income on the InfoArmy platform. Unfortunately, the current business model has several large and unfixable problems:
&gt;
&gt;    Sales are not happening. So far InfoArmy has sold just 44 individual report subscriptions ($4,356). All of this revenue was distributed to researchers (InfoArmy did not take 50% as planned under the Revenue Share model).
&gt;    Almost two months ago we hired a full time sales person. He has been unsuccessful so far. Data quality is the main issue preventing sales. Common complaints include incorrect revenue estimates and competitors.
&gt;    Publication bonuses have created the wrong incentives. Some researchers have published the lowest quality reports they can get away with.
&gt;    Quarterly updates are very unpopular - even with our best researchers. The report abandonment rate for quarterly updates is high. Updates are critical to the success of the current model. We have been unable to create a sense of report ownership across a large enough group of researchers.
&gt;    So far InfoArmy has paid $146K to researchers (averaging $23/report), and some researchers have made over $5,000 individually. We are very happy that many hard working researchers have made money. However, without a clear path to revenue this model is unsustainable.
&gt;
&gt;InfoArmy takes full responsibility for the above issues. This business model was our idea. Unfortunately it isn't working as planned and we have to make some major changes.
&gt;
&gt;We haven't figured it all out yet, but we believe the new model will look something like this:
&gt;
&gt;    No more 50/50 Revenue Share. Members will exchange information they have for information they need.
&gt;    No more report ownership. Many different people will contribute to reports and make estimates. Reports will be updated in real time instead of quarterly.
&gt;    All reports will be free (in their current form). The object will be to create added value that can eventually be put behind a pay wall.
&gt;
&gt;For purposes of clarity, we will no longer be paying InfoArmy members for their information gathering. If you choose to continue to provide services to us under the new model, you will not be paid under the Revenue Share model or by any other means. The Terms Of Service that govern the services you provided will terminate with the final payment you receive. InfoArmy is creating an entirely new business model that will have new terms. As of today we have made all existing reports free. If you wish to remove the reports you created from the InfoArmy website please contact us at support@infoarmy.com.
&gt;
&gt;We made one final General Fund Payment on January 31st, 2013. Along with the General Fund payment we included an Appreciation Bonus to thank you again for your support. Each initial report creation was awarded $5 and each update $2. These bonuses applied regardless of whether or not you still owned the report and were split 80-20 between the PR and SR. This final payment will make the total amount paid to researchers approximately $200K (or approximately $29 per report).
&gt;
&gt;We anticipate that you may have questions and concerns. Please email us at support@infoarmy.com and we will respond as quickly as possible. We will also have two webinars to answer your questions. They will occur on Friday, Feb 1 at 3pm PST and Monday, Feb 4 at 7am PST.
&gt;
&gt;To the majority of researchers who believed in the InfoArmy vision of creating a revenue share platform we offer our sincere apologies that the current model did not work. We recognize that many of you poured your hearts into creating reports, and we are very sorry to have let you down. We truly thank you for your support and have enjoyed getting to know you all. We are hopeful to see you again when we launch the new model.

The idea is that this post should give new users a simple overview of several options and expectations for each.  It also means I can make one post and refer to it when people ask for a general list of sites rather than re-posting things throughout the month. 

In order to fit the post within Reddit's maximum length, I'll link to a few of my blog posts for specifics.
____________________________________________

**Superpoints**

In March, I cashed out [**$80**](http://imgur.com/UlYps) from Superpoints. Last month I had $85, but I've had some referrals stop using the site and haven't pushed for new referrals as much, so it didn't grow. Also, the payment screenshot doesn't include the 30th and 31st, so if it comes out to $70 or $75, that's why. I expect next month to be about the same. This isn't typical for the site though. I have a lot of referrals. 

[Click here](http://weblootcentral.blogspot.com/search/label/Superpoints) for details about the site, a tutorial, some posts about getting referrals, and invite links.

_______________________________________________

**Swagbucks**

I haven't used it much this month since there were occasional captchas, people have been getting banned, and I've been working on other things, but I still got **$20** in Amazon gift cards.. 

It's another site that pays redeemable points for people who complete offers, watch videos, searching on their search engine, and take surveys. 

The big earner on Swagbucks is the video option. If you have a smartphone, they offer a free app that will automatically watch videos and gather points for you. On the computer, they've made it more difficult to automate, though many people are still managing to do it by using auto-refreshers that stop on the 10th video so they can type in a captcha if needed.

Searching is great too. After a few tries, you'll usually earn some points.  Points can be earned this way every few hours. If you get referrals, you also get points when they search.

**Hubpages**

I've started writing articles on Hubpages. It's a nice option for people that like to write guides, political commentary, fiction, poetry, and whatever else. Obviously, you could always do a blog with ads as well, which would have a bit more potential, but Hubpages is a little easier make something that looks nice in my opinion and it's a little easier to promote.

So far I've only made $3.85 with 3 articles(mostly just from one of them that had a wider appeal), but I like the idea that they'll keep earning a few cents here and there as long as people stumble across them. I promote what I write on Empire Avenue, Reddit, and Facebook. After a couple months pass, I'll promote something I've already promoted in the past for a new surge of readers and more money. 

If you don't want to write, you can actually promote other people's hubs with your own tracker and still get a portion of the adsense and affiliate earnings.

You can also refer new writers and get a matched amount for 10% of their lifetime earnings. Considering some people really go nuts with it and actually make hundreds each month, that could be pretty sweet.

I haven't started with the referral stuff, but I'm going to play with it this month and see what I can make. I think it should be possible to do very well and become my biggest earner, replacing Superpoints.

**PaidViewpoint**

A month ago I was at $2.54, now I'm up to $12.49 with a trait score of 3000. I'm still really liking Paidviewpoint. I've gotten a number of short surveys that have paid up to $1.41(that was a Men's Wharehouse survey).

**Pollbuzzer**

Same as the month before, I got **$1** last month. It doesn't sound like much, but considering it took all of 5 seconds to open an email and answer a one question poll, I'm ok with that.

**Listia**

Basically an auction site with on site currency instead of real money. You get 500 points or so when you sign up and I've been making more by selling coke rewards codes for another 100 each. Last month I just kept saving and now at 1640 points. The month before I was able to use 1200 pts to buy **Marvel Ultimate Alliance 2** for the PS2.

**Hits4Pay**

Open an ad, leave the page open while do stuff in other tabs, earn a few cents. A month ago I was at $6.06, now I'm at **$11.67**. It has sped up quite a bit since I've gotten a few referrals. Payout is at $25.

**Topline**

It replaces ads instead of blocking them and cuts you in on the revenue. The program is still in beta, but they have been responsive and delivered on adding features that were requested and promised. You can now see how many referrals you have and add sites to a list if you want to see the original ads so you can support whichever sites you like.  

Each 1000 points is currently worth 0.75, but that is expected to increase as they grow and attract more advertisers. I'm earning 150+ points per day with my browsing habits. I'm currently at **$7.05** from about $2 a month ago. Just remember that if you use any auto-reloaders, add the sites you use them on to the excluded sites list.

**Inbox Dollars**

Inbox Dollars send you email with surveys as well as paid emails. The paid emails basically just link you to an ad/offer which you can close immediately and get a few cents. They also have videos, games, and tasks that can all be used to get some money. 

So far, I've only done one offer and opened the paid emails. I'm currently at **$11.04**, but the payout isn't until $30. I've only made  **$2.37** last month, but it was all from the paid emails and my 3 referrals. I'm not entirely sure how referral pay is figured, but I ended up getting a little over $1 of that $2.37 from referrals.

**FreeAwesome**

It's owned by the same company as Swagbucks. Like so many of these sites, they make money when people complete offers and surveys. The big difference here is that all the rewards are based on chance instead of redeemable points. There are slots, poker, and a lottery to play. 

The most I've ever received on a spin was $1 and am currently at **$8.50**. The minimum payout is $10. I haven't done any surveys or offers so far.

**Bing Rewards**

In an effort to compete with Google, Microsoft offers a rewards program for using Bing. Basically just click through a few things and do some nonsense searches for 20+ daily points. I just started doing it recently and am at 322 points and am waiting until 525 to get $5 on Amazon.

[**Web Loot Central Post for more info**](http://weblootcentral.blogspot.com/).

I've hit the 25 points for referrals already, so help someone else out by using their invite if possible.

**Neobux**

After PTC sites were a hot thing around here for a week or so, I looked into a few. Of the ones I saw, most were scams and/or total junk.  Neobux was the only one that seemed trustworthy and potentially worth it. Basically you just let an ad load for a bit and get anywhere from 1 to 1/10^th of a cent.

Neobux lets you use your on site earnings to rent referrals so you get paid for their clicks as long as you see ads each day. It could take awhile to get going, but potentially might be worth it eventually. I currently have 3 rented referrals and an extra 30 cents or so available. On Neobux, you can minimize the window and still get credit for the ad, so I don't mind it.

There isn't anything incredibly new here, but I think it will be helpful for the people just starting out with making beermoney online and those looking for a simple routine for a little extra cash each month.

When I first started browsing r/beermoney a few months ago I was a little bit overwhelmed by the sheer variety of sites/apps you could use for making extra cash. As most new people do, I immediately signed up for about a dozen sites and tried to maintain my account on them all. This lasted for about a week before I realized I needed to streamline my routine. I was putting in far too much time with very little to show for it.

I narrowed it down to just three services, which combined give me enough extra cash to support a superfluous hobby of mine. In total I spend around a half an hour each day on beermoney and typically make $100-150 a month. Not great pay, but it's easy enough to find a little extra time each day for it.

The services I use are:

**Name: [Amazon Mechanical Turk](https://www.mturk.com/mturk/welcome)**

- *Typical Monthly Payout:* $80-120

- *How it works:* ""Amazon Mechanical Turk is a marketplace for work that requires human intelligence."" Basically you'll be filling out surveys, questionnaires, researching data (aka Googling things), writing and doing other somewhat monotonous tasks. These are called HITS, and each HIT is worth a certain dollar amount.  

- *Why I use it:* No surprise here, Mturk forms the backbone of my routine. It's simply one of the most reliable and (in my eyes) interesting ways of making a little extra money each month. 

- *My routine:* I typically turk for about 15-30 minutes in the morning before getting ready for the day, and make around $3-5 a day give or take. The best way to find new HITS is by clicking on the ""new"" tab on /r/hitsworthturkingfor. That's pretty much how I find all of what I do on Mturk, they make finding good paying and interesting HITS a breeze. I also recommend downloading the [Turkopticon extension](http://turkopticon.differenceengines.com/) for Chrome. It lets you see the ratings and submit reviews for requesters on Mturk.

**Name: [FeaturePoints](http://featu.re/K513TX)** - [no ref](http://featurepoints.com/web/)

- *Typical Monthly Payout:* $20-30

- *How it works:* Download free apps on your phone/tablet (both ios &amp; android) and earn points that can be redeemed for all kinds of rewards (gift cards, paid apps, cash, etc). Minimum Paypal cashout is $5

- *Why I use it:* It provides a way of making beermoney on the go with very few hassles. Just download the apps and try them out for a minute, then delete them if you want. The points get added to your account immediately (which is nice).

- *My routine:* I typically check out and download the new apps available every morning and then check it a few times during the day (pretty much every time I go to the restroom haha) to see if there are new offers available. Very simple and hassle free.

**Name: [PollBuzzer](http://pollbuzzer.com/?r=b3Z6V0l2QzZHRkMwVm1zR2xJS3dwZz090)** - [no ref](http://pollbuzzer.com)

- *Typical monthly payout:* $20-30

- *How it works:* You get one-question surveys delivered to your email address whenever they're available (based on your demographic). Simply click on your answer, which will take you to the PollBuzzer site to confirm. It literally takes about 10 seconds, and every survey question you answer pays out $1 to your Paypal account (payouts on Mondays). 

- *Why I use it:* No sites to visit, very little hassle, and already fits in with my habit of checking my email for work. [Just today I received sixteen survey questions in the span of an hour.](http://i.imgur.com/wTGe7wy.png) That's $16 for about a two minutes worth of my time. Not too shabby I'd say. Granted, usually the PollBuzzer emails aren't nearly that common..but sometimes you get lucky. 

- *My routine:* Just open the emails and answer the question whenever they show up in my inbox. Simple stuff.

And that's pretty much my entire routine. I don't make a ton, but I don't have to invest a lot of time either which is exactly what I want. I try and keep it as simple and uncluttered as possible, but I do like to try out new sites every now and then to see if they're worth it and can fit into my routine somehow. But mostly I think keeping it super simple is better. I encourage you to find a routine that best suits your beermoney needs and the time you have to invest.

I hope you enjoyed reading, and I'd love to head about everyone else's routines. Thanks!

Rewards have changed and have increased across the board for low value gift cards.

You can read their blog post for all of the changes but to me the site seems very much devalued and not worth my time anymore.

Well, I just got this flash-in-the-pan idea and I'm going to sit on it and contemplate it for a few days, but ... I live near an airport, a downtown business/legal area, and in a climate where everyone wears shoes. 

I just did a bunch of reading and page-saving, on the subject of running a shoeshine stand. Or, just shoeshining in general. 

It seems there's a demand for it at corporate events, things like that. 

Needless to say there's some demand on the street, and you may not need a stand, just get one of those box things that you set the person's foot on. 

It could be a fairly painless way to make beer money. 

It could also develop into a living. Depending on how you like it, it might turn out to be enjoyable.

Instructions are virtually the same.**

https://deepbit.net/

Sign up for an account. Choose proportional mode.

Download [this](http://forum.bitcoin.org/?topic=2444.0) and [this](http://www.softpedia.com/get/Tweak/Video-Tweak/GUIMiner.shtml) and [this](http://www.bitcoin.org/).

First one you just extract. Second one is your mining program. Third one is your wallet where you keep track of all your bitcoins.

So you have a deepbit account, right? Well anyways after everything is extracted and installed open up your bitcoin.exe. There is a long string of text near the top in a box. That is your address. That is how you get paid and pay others. Copy that and then goto [your account](https://deepbit.net/account) and paste it into the ""Your bitcoin address for receiving rewards"" box. Save settings.

Now go back to [your account](https://deepbit.net/account) and click create worker. Set the worker's login tail to 0 and the password to anything you will remember. Leave payout as proportional and click save settings.

Open up GuiMiner. File&gt;new other miner and navigate to where you extracted that third link(the one with 4 .exes). Select rpcminer-cuda.exe for your new other miner. Name it CUDA. In the guiminer tab for this new miner(the CUDA tab) set the server to other. 

Host: pit.deepbit.net 

Port: 8332 

Username: youremail@email.com**_0**  *you must add the _0*

Password: The password of your created worker 

Extra flags: Only needed for more than 1 graphics card, if this is true, read part 2

Go into guiminer and do file &gt; save settings. Now click start mining. The number of MHash/s is completely dependent on your graphics card's power. I have 2 cards that get about 30 MH/s each. To check your mined coins go [here](https://deepbit.net/account).

Okay, so now just a bit of explaining. Your deepbit account is merely a holding place for your coins. To actually spend them you need to payout to your address. To do this goto [your account](https://deepbit.net/account) and click the Payment link. You can only pay out if you have over 0.01 BTC. When you pay out it will appear in your bitcoin.exe, it takes a while the first time and every payment after that it is near instantaneous. Once it is in your bitcoin.exe congratulations, you now have bitcoins to spend. To spend them you just get the address of the person who you are sending them to then click the send button on bitcoin.exe, put in their address and the amount.

Also, goto C:\Users\USERNAME\AppData\Roaming\Bitcoin (if you're on windows7) and backup your wallet.dat file. That is your wallet. It has all of your money. Don't delete it.

**Part 2, multiple graphics cards.**

I have 2 graphics cards so setup took a bit more for me, if you have only 1 ignore this section.

Only a few things you need to do. Go to your [deepbit account](https://deepbit.net/account) and click ""create new worker"". For worker login tail set it to 1. Set the password to something you will remember. Leave payment proportional. Save settings. Now go to your guiminer. In your original CUDA tab with your username as youremail@email.com_0 go into the extra flags and put in ""-gpu=0"". Now go to file&gt;new other worker and choose the rpcminer-cuda.exe as before. Name it CUDA2. In the CUDA2 tab have the following settings.

Server: other

Host: pit.deepbit.net

Port: 8332

Username: youremail@email.com**_1** *must have the _1*

Password: The password you set when you made the new worker on deepbit.

Extra flags: -gpu=1

So you end up with 2 tabs, a CUDA tab that has all the same settings except the email ends in _0 and the extra flags as -gpu=0 and a CUDA2 tab with the email ending in _1 and extra flags are -gpu=1.

File&gt;save settings in guiminer and click start mining on both tabs.

A final piece of advice. This will use your GPU heavily, if you are gaming or anything else and notice that video is lagging go to the tray in the bottom right, find the GuiMiner icon and right click it and close it. Do not click stop mining in guiminer.exe. This always crashes my computer and will likely crash yours. Just close the program from the tray.

First, use **Check Points**

Check Points is an app where you can rack up points by scanning items in the store, completing TapJoy offers, and watching videos.

Here's my bonus code at sign up: **mm475496**


Second, use **Ibotta**

This app is pretty simple. Scan your receipt from your grocery purchase, scan the barcode of qualifying items, make a dollar or so back per item. They also have bonuses where if you redeem a certain amount of offers at a time, you get extra money. Personally, I love this app and I've made about $20 so far within two months. They have major brands on here so it isn't anything crazy. For example, offers that I have redeemed include Driscoll raspberries, Tylenol, and Coppertone sunscreen.

[Ibotta referral link](http://ibotta.com/r/TCtFXA)//[non-ref link](https://ibotta.com/)

Third, use **ReceiptHog**

All you have to do is scan your receipt and you get points. There is a weekly goal of 100 points but since I have a large family, I shatter this goal within three days. You can redeem $5 in Amazon gift cards or Paypal cash at 1000 points.

**Edit**

Fourth, try **Savingstar**

Thanks u/punchthekeys for the input! Savingstar is a great way to earn a couple dollars back at checkout. You go on their website, activate an eCoupon, and purchase the item! The activated eCoupon does not show up on the register so you should keep tabs on your account. Also, they have great offers where if you spend $30 on, for example, Nestle frozen food products, you'll get five dollars back. This is actually a current offer! Payout is in the form of bank deposit, paypal, donation, or amazon gift cards. Sometimes, you can double dip with Ibotta and Savingstar so I recommend checking both frequently.

[Savingstar non-ref link](http://www.savingstar.com)

Fifth, use **Swagbucks**

I know most of you already use Swagbucks on a daily basis and it's mentioned frequently in /r/beermoney. When I go shopping, I use the SBTV Mobile app to rack up some extra SBs as I roam the aisles. If you don't have this app, you're definitely missing out!

The **TL;DR** of the post is this - you buy a gift card, and with that purchase you get ""bid"" which can be used to buy OTHER gift cards. There was some question about legitimacy of this site, as few people have used it.

I went in for $25, bought a Lands End gift card (that can be used at KMart/Sears). With my points, I tried to get my hands on an Amazon gift card. I was unsuccessful - I didn't win anything. I think the key is to go for a less ""popular"" card, like Starbucks or something. I didn't want to invest any more until I got my Lands End card in the mail (so I'd know it's legit). I received it today.

It looks like an interesting program, if that's your thing. I just wanted to attest that it is legit. No ref code - if you're interested, go to the original post (linked above) and give thomastullis the credit.

(US),48,10,77,http://www.reddit.com/r/beermoney/comments/13yw9u/time_to_expose_my_secret_money_making_ways_i/,"A coworker showed me Yardsellr a few months back and I haven't stopped playing with it since. People refer to it as Ebay for Facebook. You gain photons (Ydsr points) in Yardsellr by blockifying (categorizing) new items that sellers list. Each 1000 points equal .01. Every 6-10 items categorized gets you nearly 0.25. The cap is $10 a day which isn't that difficult to do if you categorize the right time of day. You can use these points to buy anything on the site. My coworker used to buy silver coins with it. I found that people sell gift cards as well. A $50 walmart/ shell gas/ amazon gift card is usually 60 dollars worth of photons. Also if you join, all your friends on yardsellr get a extra $1 as a referral bonus. 

Edit: It is connected to facebook. You have to have a facebook account ( or fake account.) Sellers also have to have an account. So facebook friends who are on yardseller get the referral bonus. Also if you are worried if a seller is legit or giving you bogus gift cards, on every sellers homepage there is chat that is saved that everyone can see for whatever conversation anyone had. You can see if another buyer was having any complaints with them. 

Edit2:If the counter is going down you will loose your photons!! Make sure you drag over the counter and ""Pause"" it!! You have to pause it every day or you will loose the hard earned photons you are trying to earn.  If you follow a block it will be added to the list of stuff you can blockify. When you blockify there should also be a search bar on the bottom of the little window after you click the plus sign. Protip: Follow the block ""Household"" Most of the odd things go in there. Also watches are considered jewelry. So if you see a watch you can blockify under watches and jewelry.

So I'm from Portugal and I found out about this subreddit about two weeks ago. As most beermoneymakers outside of USA know, the majority of links and suggestions on r/beermoney are directed to USA/UK/Canada almost exclusively. So i've been researching for alternatives and here's what I've stumbled upon:

**Paid To Click**

[NatureBucks](http://naturebucks.com/members/register.php?refid=30059) | [Non Ref](http://naturebucks.com) - This site offers a variety of tasks such as watching videos, signing up to prizes, answering surveys and clicking ads. The referral system is pretty good since it has five levels and you win 20% off of your level 1 referrals. The payment is done via paypal and the minimum withdrawal is 0.05$.


[NatureGPT](http://naturegpt.com/members/register.php?refid=3098) | [Non Ref](http://naturegpt.com/) - It's pretty much the same as NatureBucks but the referral system is slightly different. You will earn 10% of what your direct referrals earn from offers.
You will also receive a $1.00 bonus when a referral completes an offer
worth at least $0.25 or 25 points. The minimum cash out is 2.00$ via paypal and amazon gift certificates.


**Crowdsourcing**


[MobileWorks](https://www.mobileworks.com/mobileworker/) - This platform offers various tasks and once you completed them, and someone approves them, you get payed in points. It's 1c = 0.01$. This site has no referral system and has a paypal withdrawal minimum of 1$ (or 100c). It doesn't pay much but generally it has a lot of work so it's kinda cool.


[CloudCrowd](https://www.cloudcrowd.com/i/kbsdkz) | [Non Ref](http://www.cloudcrowd.com/) - This is by far my favorite beermoney source of income. It's a platform that has work divided in categories like writing, editing, categorization, research and a few more. First, you've got to qualify to jobs by getting credentials like English Comprehension, General Writing, Marketing Writing, etc. Then, once you start completing tasks, if your task are approved, your credibility number will rise. This means that you'll have access to better paying tasks. There is no minimum withdrawal since you are payed for every task via paypal. The only bad thing about CloudCrowd is that you need to have a facebook account. It is mandatory. But it is totally worth it.


I'd really like to know of some other alternatives. Keep'em coming!

I was just notified about an Arby's Facebook giveaway, so I ""liked"" the page, did the required steps, and in 5 minutes I was half way (points-wise) to a $10 Amazon Gift Card. Absolutely simple.

All you have to do is Like the contest page, watch a video, visit Recipe.com, tweet (optional) about the give away, and share stuff on facebook (also optional)

Other way to earn points to get the gift card include checking in via the iPhone app, Foursquare, at a local Arbys (easily abused, you can check in as long as you're within a few miles of an Arby's) you can tweet daily about the contest, take a picture of a sandwich from Arby's on the iPhone app, Instagram, etc. It is ridiculously simple, especially if you don't care about looking like a consumer whore on your facebook. The promotion lasts until 5/31, which is MORE than enough time to earn a gift-card.

If you do have a problem with that, all of the posts and tweets can be deleted immediately and you still retain the points for the gift card.

**It should also be noted**, every 100 points you earn in this contest grants you an entry into a $10,000 give away, so while the Amazon gift-card is a sure bet, the $10,000 would be totally kickass.

Here is a referral link (another way to earn points) **DO NOT** be alarmed about the page you see when you click my referral link. You are directed to that facebook page because you're allowing Arby's to see your *basic* facebook information, such as your likes and location, etc.

I just think it would be nice to have one ready resource that had every known site/app that fits this subreddit's criteria. Maybe just a thread stickied on the sidebar or at the top of the subreddit and updated frequently. Even better though would be a website. It could have two main categories: online and mobile, and within those would be sub-categories like tasks, surveys, PTC, etc. Maybe a link for the most recently discovered ones. There could also be a review system in place so people could rate how effective they found each method to be, or how well they pay out.

Tellwut pays you for completing surveys based on your opinion. Each survey is 1-5 multiple choice questions and takes about 10 seconds to answer.

For each survey you complete you get either 5 or 10 points. Points can be redeemed for gift cards (4000 points=$10 amazon gift card).

**Day 1:**

Sign up (100 points) and then fill our your profile (another 100 points). Next, click on most recent surveys. There should be around 150 surveys for you to do. Open up 5 at a time and quickly do them before moving to the next page. (this should take you about 15-20 minutes)

**Daily Work:**

I usually visit Tellwut once a day and do all the new surveys (around 20 every day). Click on most recent and sort by ""time:newly listed"". Answer all the new surveys. (about 5 minutes of work)

After about 6-7 days you should have enough points for a $10 Amazon gift card. (Unfortunately no paypal option at this time)

Just wanted to share a good way to make some extra beer money with a new site I've found. Hopefully a NSFW post is alright in this subreddit. 
Chaturbate.com offers users $1 for every referral they can get. I've yet to reach the minimum payout ($50) but others have confirmed being paid. A dollar per referral is an incredible deal! I'm sure you all have tons of friends who can take 30 seconds to help you out, plus they'll be eternally in your debt for telling them about the best site known to mankind. There's no e-mail confirmation required either!
Another thing, be sure to use the right referral URL. You can find them under the ""Linking Codes"" section. I used the wrong code for the first couple referrals and instead of getting $1 per sign up I now get %20 of the tokens they purchase.

The week proceeding my discovery of /r/beermoney I quickly ran the gambit of all that is GPT and Reward sites. And, like most, I ended with mTurk (which is a whole other testimonial), but as I spent more time on Swagbucks I quickly fell in love with the community and the ""game"" that is the daily goal. Now, I know that sounds corny, but by becoming addicted to hitting goal everyday I have not only gained a pretty good deal of AGCs, but I have also found a nice little home and hobby on the Internets.


I think the great thing about SwagBucks is how doable it actually is. Most of the GPT sites have a sort of ""scammy"" and ""ghetto"" type feel to them, meaning, NatureBucks (while I have made money there) just isn't something you would brag about (or tell your RL friends about). SwagBucks, somehow, has lost that ghetto feeling and made itself a mainstream site (maybe because so many stay-at-home moms use it). Regardless, it's fun, it's profitable, and it appears to be here for the longhaul. (for those that know anything about website traffic, SwagBucks is ranked 590 on Alexa, which is right up there with some pretty huge ass sites, meaning - it ain't going anywhere!)


I am just under a month into my Swagbucks career and I have already redeemed 4 $5 AGC and I am half way to another. This may sound like chump change, but I just recently started to take it seriously. I have made goal now for 8 straight days and don't plan on losing that sreak anytime soon.

(I need to redo the signatures for O, Q, and C... sigh) I'm beginning to integrate it with tracking the website and solving them in realtime. Hopefully this means a release soon :)

It will be username and password locked. This is to ensure Swagbucks doesn't get a copy of it and figure out what it does... PM me if you will want access to it. 

-------------
3/5/2012 12:19am EST update:
I was able to get an account flagged as suspicious, which means captcha's every 10 videos! Which is good. The bot is working, now I'm running it for a few hours to test it. After that, I need to touch up a few letters signatures and hook it up to ensure users are authenticated, then I can release it.

-------------------

Details about the bot:

It will require the computer to be left alone, with your browser on top with the program. Actually doing stuff during the bot is running might break it. The bot is designed to solve the CAPTCHA's enough times to get your bot out of the suspectibility mode, and back into the no-Captcha mode.

It is HIGHLY recommended to do this in VMWARE or VIRTUALBOX. You can download virtualbox for free, torrent a copy of XP or Windows 7 and get it running.

In Windows 7: It might be because of I'm running Windows in VMWARE, but I can only get the bot to work while in Windows Basic theme mode. (Not the aero interface)... I'm not entirely sure why, but my best guess is, my mac isn't powerful enough to run VMWARE fast enough, so it locks up. 

The bot works in combination with an auto refresher.

If I can get it to correctly solve some of the CAPTCHA's, I'll aim for a release on 3/6/2012. (I can get it to solve the first CAPTCHA, then after that it goes insane and decides it has no clue what its doing -_-)


ALSO: IF YOU MESSAGE ME:

I probably wont reply if you send me CAPTCHA's, ask me for access, etc. Don't take it as a denial, I have gotten a lot of messages from this, I don't have time to reply to everyone.

Most of us have facebook bookmarked already, so why not earn some Swagbucks for it?  

Instead of bookmarking www.facebook.com, bookmark the search results for ""facebook"" using the swagbucks search.  Example: [THIS](http://www.swagbucks.com/?t=w&amp;p=1&amp;b=0&amp;f=0&amp;q=facebook) page.  Every time you open that link, it will count as a search through Sb and may or may not award you points.  Then just click the first result to get onto facebook.  

This works with any bookmark, gmail, reddit, whatever, but just don't do every link because SB can detect over-searching.  I just do it with facebook and reddit, all my other links are untouched.

----

[Swagbucks]( http://www.swagbucks.com/refer/fire741cracker) is my most consistent earner, and they pay out to Amazon and Paypal. The $5 Amazon Gift Cards are the best deal, which cost 450 Swagbucks. You earn Swagbucks by:

**Daily Poll** - Each day has a daily poll, earn 1 SB by answering it.

**NOSO** - No Obligation Special Offers are available every day, just click “skip” on 5 or 6 pages to earn 2 SBs.

**Search** - It is possible to win up to 4 times a day from searching, but I usually only try to  win twice. After 2 wins it takes too many searches to win for me to be worth it. Search wins usually give 6-12 SBs, but occasionally pay out much larger amounts. The largest win I personally received was 51 SBs.

**Swagbucks TV** - This is my largest source of Swagbucks, you watch 10 videos and then get 3 SBs. Videos credit after about 40 seconds. I do this while going about my Beermoney routine or watching TV, you want to multitask because just sitting there doing SBTV would be incredibly boring.

**Referrals** - When a referral wins from searching, you get matching Swagbucks. You can earn up to 1000 SB per referral.

**Daily Goal** - If you reach the daily goal, you earn 10% of the daily goal as a bonus at the end of the month. So if the daily goal is 50 Swagbucks and you make it, at the end of the month you will be credited with 5 SBs. Each day has a daily goal, and if you make 7 or more days in a row you will get another bonus for that as well.

When you redeem a gift card, it usually takes 7-8 days to process. The gift card will be emailed to you, so you don’t have to tell Swagbucks your real physical address. Using just the things I outlined above, I easily earn five $5 Amazon Gift Cards a month. If you are interested you can sign up under [my referral link here](http://www.swagbucks.com/refer/fire741cracker), or a [non-ref](http://www.swagbucks.com).

[Topline](https://www.jointopline.com/?fid=67W2PL7TJ55P) is a great passive way to earn money. It is an internet add-on that replaces advertisements with its own, and it pays you for each ad you view. The minimum payout is $10 to Paypal or you can have a physical check mailed to you. Referrals earn you 5% of what they do. This is completely passive, but is a slow earner, with no referrals it took me 2 months to reach $10 and cash out. [Here is my referral link](https://www.jointopline.com/?fid=67W2PL7TJ55P) to sign up, or a [non-ref]( https://www.jointopline.com).

----

[Naturebucks](http://naturebucks.com/members/register.php?ref=fire741cracker) pays you to do very simple tasks like sign up for an email newsletter, watch a video, like a Facebook page or complete other straightforward offers. They usually take around 30 seconds to 2 minutes, and pay anywhere from $0.05 to $1.00. The things I like most about Naturebucks are bolded below.

**Minimum payout of 0.05** to Paypal, or 1.00 for Amazon gift cards.

**Prompt payment** – Payout is instant for Paypal, or takes about 20 minutes for Amazon GCs

**Five tiers of referrals** – Naturebucks gives you 20% of what your referrals make, and it goes down five tiers, each tier earning you a flat 20% rate. So a referral of a referral of a referral of a referral of your referral earns you 20% of what they do.

**Bonus** – If you manage to get to $20.00 (this includes what you get from referrals), Naturebucks gives you an extra $1.00. This is free money, and it is instantly applied to your account. You don’t have to have 20.00 waiting for you to cash out all at once, you can cash out as you go and once you hit 20.00 for your account’s lifetime you get the bonus. You can get the bonus multiple times, at each increment of twenty, so 20, 40, 60 and so on.

I have the best luck with offers that are under the Most Credited or Recently Credited columns, they usually always confirm and pay out. You can sign up under [my referral link here](http://naturebucks.com/members/register.php?ref=fire741cracker), or a [non-ref]( http://naturebucks.com)

[Gifthulk](http://www.gifthulk.com/refer/fire741cracker) is a great site that pays out to Paypal and Amazon gift cards. The $5 Amazon GC’s are the cheapest, costing 439 Hulk Coins, and you earn 50 Hulk Coins just by signing up. You can earn more Hulk Coins by:

**Daily Poll** - Each day there will be a new daily poll. You earn 1 Hulk Coin for each daily poll.

**Search** - I win about 2-3 times every day by searching. Prizes vary between hulk coins, daily keys, boosts, permanent keys and store discounts.

**Treasure Box** - Each day you start off with 5 Daily Keys + however many “Permanent Keys” you have. Each key lets you open the Treasure Box, which gives you a chance to win Hulk Coins, more daily keys, permanent keys, Fountain of Youth codes (like swag codes), boosts and even Amazon gift cards. This is like spinning the Superlucky Button on Superpoints.

**Fountain of Youth** – Enter codes to get free Hulk Coins. FOY codes are released on Gifthulk’s Facebook, Twitter and the email newsletter. You can also win codes from the Treasure Box, and these usually have around 5 uses so you can share them with friends. Codes from the Treasure Box are also shared by people on Reddit and Gifthulk’s Facebook page.

**Referrals** – Each referral that earns 50 Hulk Coins gives you 1 permanent key to the treasure box. You also win 20% of your referrals Hulk Coins from searching, Treasure box wins, offer walls, EZ coins, tasks and surveys. There is no limit on how much you can earn from your referrals.

**Offer Wall** – This has offers that do not cost anything, like watching videos, liking a Facebook page, doing surveys, or signing up for an email newsletter. It also awards you for signing up for free trials, though you will have to cancel them before the trial period is over. The offers listed as “EZ Coins” are the easiest to do, and completing EZ Coins offers worth more than 10 Hulk Coins will also give you a treasure box key.

**Gifthulk TV** - Watch a round of 10 videos and get 2 Hulk Coins. Videos credit after about 20 seconds. You also get a bonus for the 5th, 10th and 15th round of ten videos you watch. There are CAPTCHAs at the tenth video, and you need to connect to a Facebook account.

All prizes are given out on Sundays, with the cut-off point to redeem that week being 11:59 pm Saturday night. [Here is my referral link](http://www.gifthulk.com/refer/fire741cracker) if you are interested, and a [non-ref](http://www.gifthulk.com)

[MTurk](https://www.mturk.com) – This is run by Amazon.com, you complete surveys for money.

My name is Ross and I started a website called [BetaPunch](http://betapunch.com). The purpose of my website is to help startup websites get feedback for their sites design, user experience, and concept.

I have set up a way for these startup websites to get screen recorded user feedback from people like you, simply by the click of a button to start recording. So our beta testers record their interactions with the site as well as SPEAK about their experiences using the website for the first time.

**There is NO download or installation or sign up required for you to test a website.** It's all web based one-click recording. You only need to make sure you have java enabled in your browser to launch the recorder.

**I offer $5 per 10 minute recorded screen cast of feedback (paid via pay pal).** Basically you just have to click record, navigate to the startup's website and start using it and talking about what you like / don't like / what should be improved upon etc. Upload your video, then I review the video to make sure you provided quality feedback. Then you get paid.

So far, I have already had a couple beta testers from other reddits make a nice chunk of change. $5 for 10 minutes of work is not bad at all!

If you are interested in doing this - please PM me and I will send you the details as far as what site I would like you to test. Please be ready to start right away if you PM me.

Let me know if you have any questions.

Thanks,

-Ross

P.S. - Please don't test any websites on your own yet until I give you further instructions in PM if you are indeed interested in testing websites on BetaPunch.

**EDIT: This has been a very huge success. Thanks to all those who have tested websites today. There is only 1 more opportunity to test today. But don't worry, there will be more opportunities available to test! I will be back to let you guys know when more tests become available!**

1347995983.0,33,self.beermoney,103e8f,Fusioncash - ~$30 my first month with minimal effort of &lt; 4 min/day.,48,15,13,http://www.reddit.com/r/beermoney/comments/103e8f/fusioncash_30_my_first_month_with_minimal_effort/,"So [Fusioncash](http://www.fusioncash.net/?ref=turkmagurk) has moved up in my depth chart of beermoney sites.  I joined the site a month ago and have it in my rotation now with minimal effort each day. After a month of ~4 min/day: [Imgur Screenshot](http://i.imgur.com/D1KG0).  They pay out through direct deposit, check, or Paypal.  The payout isn't instant (there's a lag of ~20 days or so), but if you're signing up for the site, hopefully you're in it for the long haul.

There are a multitude of ways to earn cash on this site, but I'll stick to what I've done and try to summarize it succinctly.

- Paid emails.  $0.02/day, credits instantly: They'll send you a daily cash email, which is worth $0.02 for clicking.  I usually just use this as a gateway to login to the site and as a reminder to go there.

- Cheap flights search. $0.10/day, credits in 10-15 min: You can do this once per 24 hour period.  Just use the cheapflights link (found under the ""Offers: Free/No CC Needed"" tab) and click an external search engine link.  Takes ~10 sec.  The icon looks [like this.](http://i.imgur.com/WLMsb)

- PTC. $0.15/day; credits instantly: Again, you can do this once per day, although from what I can tell, there isn't a 24 hour clock on it (so if you wanted to complete it once @ 11:50 PM, you could also do it at 12:01 AM).  Click on four of their pages, then click on two external links (one for their coupon site, another for a sponsored ad).  The icon looks [like this.](http://i.imgur.com/7LEyn)

- Videos. $0.01-$0.10/day: This one varies according to how many videos they have available, but you can usually click on each of them multiple times.  The majority of them don't require you to do anything else except open the video, and it'll credit you as soon as you're done watching/close the window.  The icon looks [like this.)(http://i.imgur.com/1q7pu)

So that's what I do each day.  It takes a couple of minutes, and I'll have them running while I do other things (checking email, browsing reddit, etc.).  There's no forms to fill out or having to pay attention, and it's an easy $0.28-$0.40/day.

To get started, however, it's important to do a couple of things.  

- Verify your email.  They don't spam your inbox (like a couple of other sites), but it might be wise to use an alternate address that you use for beermoney tasks.  It's important in order to receive the daily email.

- Fill out the profile surveys on the Fusioncash site.  They'll give you $0.50 for doing so, and it's basically a way they can target Paid Surveys for you.  These can be found on the left hand side of the ""FC Surveys Tab,"" found [here](http://i.imgur.com/LREG3).

[It should be worth noting a couple of things about Fusioncash's external Paid surveys they link to.  I don't usually do them because they take up time and you have the potential for being DQ'ed if you don't meet their criteria, but the compensation for them is pretty good.  And as a consolation, if you happen to be DQ'ed, they'll still give you $0.01 for trying them out.  If there's a survey that I know I have success with, I'll do it, notably the ""Vote for your favorite"" and some of the beverage surveys.  Otherwise, sometimes they're a time-sink.]

- Sign up for the Blockbuster offer.  It's a free $7.  It credits within 10 minutes and if you use the promotional code 'video', you get a free month.  Don't cancel it immediately, or you won't get credited.  I used the service to order a DVD, returned it the next day, and then cancelled it without any issues.

- Get your $5 signup bonus.  It can be found either buried in the Instant Credit offers or an alternate way to find it is if you click on the ""Support"" tab at the top and click on the corresponding link: ""Looking for your $5 signup bonus?""

- Verify your telephone number.  It's easy and they won't spam/sell your number- it's just a method of discouraging fraud and ensuring that you're not signing up for multiple accounts.

There are also a ton of other ways to make money on the site (searches: 0.05/day, shopping, posting in their forum, etc.), but I just wanted to highlight what I do each day.  

Their [referral system](http://www.fusioncash.net/?ref=turkmagurk) is fantastic.  You get $1.00 for each confirmed referral, an additional $2.00 when your referral completes an offer, and $5.00 each time a referral cashes out.  I only have 2 confirmed referrals, but I could see how this is a nice bonus if you have active people.

A couple of notes if you've gotten this far:

- US only.  :(

- Minimum cashout of $25, but *at least* $15 has to come from offers and not bonuses.

- Cashout has a lag period.  If you request a cashout by the end of the month, they'll credit you ~20 days later.

- Obligatory [non-ref link.](http://fusioncash.net) :(

**Please** let me know if you have any questions and I'll try to do my best to respond.  I know I said I'd try to be brief, but I wanted to provide a mini-guide of what I found works/doesn't work.  Hope it was helpful!

 been using beermoney suggestions for a few months now, my main goal is to save enough to build a new gaming computer  (or i should say, severely upgrade the one i have)

Its my wife's birthday in a few weeks, and (although my end goal is the computer still), she really wanted a pink Ipod (personally neither of us ever owned one). 

I was going to get it for her regardless, but we have a joint bank account, and ever since we did that, the surprise and joy of gift giving has really went in the crapper since we can both see what we spend. she's militant with the account, and tracks every dime in and out. it really takes the fun out if it when i have to plan to tell her what $$ i need to take out.

I just ordered her new Ipod, carrying case, car charger and a few other small things through Amazon, which she will not see at all. I'm excited for it actually. it set me back a little bit on the computer stuff, but i'll make it up in a month or so.

**Superpoints**

In February, I cashed out [**$85**](http://i.imgur.com/05kVS.png) from Superpoints. I expect next month to be about the same. This isn't typical for the site though. I have a lot of referrals. Only one of them has more referrals than I do, though his extended network is tiny, so I suspect he may be using fake accounts or poorly educating his referrals.

**Swagbucks**

I've recently began getting captchas every 10^th video and haven't used it as much lately, but still managed **$25**. 

It's another site that pays redeemable points for people who complete offers, watch videos, searching on their search engine, and take surveys. 

The big earner on Swagbucks is the video option. If you have a smartphone, they offer a free app that will automatically watch videos and gather points for you. On the computer, they've made it more difficult to automate, though many people are still managing to do it by using auto-refreshers that stop on the 10th video so they can type in a captcha if needed.

Searching is great too. After a few tries, you'll usually earn some points.  Points can be earned this way every few hours. If you get referrals, you also get points when they search.

**Listia**

Basically an auction site with on site currency instead of real money. You get 500 points or so when you sign up and I've been making more by selling coke rewards codes for another 100 each. Last month I was able to save up about 1200 pts and buy **Marvel Ultimate Alliance 2** for the PS2.

**Nomorerack**

A daily deal shopping site with a referral program. You need a lot of referrals to get electronics(Console bundles, cameras, etc) free, but I'm still hopeful that I may eventually have enough to get my wife a Kinnect or something else through referrals. 

The referrals don't need to purchase anything and it's painless to sign up. It's also a reputable site that occasionally has good deals on nice stuff. I bought my wife some nice looking lingerie from there.

**Topline**

It replaces ads instead of blocking them and cuts you in on the revenue. The program is still in beta, but they have been responsive and delivered on adding features that were requested and promised. You can now see how many referrals you have and add sites to a list if you want to see the original ads so you can support whichever sites you like.  

Each 1000 points is currently worth 0.75, but that is expected to increase as they grow and attract more advertisers. I'm earning 100-300 points per day with my browsing habits. I'm currently at **$2.36**.

I was the first to bring Topline to r/beermoney's attention, but ZiggyDStarcraft has done a fantastic job of explaining it and keep us up to date, so consider using his referral if it so pleases you.

**TREASURE TROOPER**

Treasure Trooper is another site with offers, tasks, and surveys, but they try to make it more interesting by offering a variety of ways to earn both cash and several on-site currencies that can be traded through a variety of games, surveys, and offers. 

If you like doing little tasks and surveys, it's great. Sadly I don't so I haven't done much and am currently at **$12.10**. I've only made about **$4** last month since I hardly use the site.

You also earn a matching 20% of whatever your referrals get and 5% of their referrals, so it could potentially be a big earner for you if you recruit some people that do offers and surveys.

**INBOX DOLLARS**

Inbox Dollars send you email with surveys as well as paid emails. The paid emails basically just link you to an ad/offer which you can close immediately and get a few cents. They also have videos, games, and tasks that can all be used to get some money. 

So far, I've only done one offer and opened the paid emails. I'm currently at **$8.67**, but the payout isn't until $30. I've only made a little over **$1** last month, but it was all from the paid emails.

________________________________________________

**FREE AWESOME**

It's owned by the same company as Swagbucks, if I'm not mistaken. Like so many of these sites, they make money when people complete offers and surveys. The big difference here is that all the rewards are based on chance instead of redeemable points. 

The site has a slot machine that can add anywhere from 50 cents to $25 to your account and has a possible jackpot that increases over time(currently about $1200). It seems that just about everyone gets around two or three dollars on the 5 free spins you start with. You get 2 free spins occasionally in an email and can get more by doing surveys and offers. You also get 5 spins for every person you refer to the site. 
The most I've ever received on a spin was $1 and am currently at **$7.50**. The minimum payout is $10. Hopefully I'll cash out my $10 this month and earn a bit more.

They've also added poker, so instead of a spin on the slots, you can play a hand and try to win that way.

They also have an hourly lottery you can enter. The lotteries range from 3 numbers, ranging from 1 to 25, for $500 to 7 numbers, ranging from 1 to 39, for $500,000. The odds are rather low and considering it's the same company as Swagbucks, they can probably afford to payout when someone wins no problem. Chances are you won't win anything, but for those that like playing the lottery, at least you don't have to pay to play this one. You can be entered into every hourly lottery automatically for days, weeks, or even months by completing offers.

I have been working on a few internet marketing projects that I calculate can have me covered, but until they do, I need something that is more in my control. My $1000 should last me 3 weeks and in that time, I'd like to earn up $250.00/week. 

Do any of you know of reliable methods to earn money full-time online (I CAN work 30+ hours/week, but most of those will probably be done during the night)? I have the time to work, but I dont have a flexible enough scheduled to get a real job, though if I don't pull down at LEAST $150 in the first week, I'll probably have to find SOME sort of part time job, and then eat nothing but ramen until i can get things working right for me.

I read about lionbridge, leapforce, and butler hill, are these plausible? I should only need to carry this on for another month or two before the internet marketing projects take off (currently working on getting them ranked and such).

TL;DR : I need a online job that I can work on my own hours due to school/other commitments, I am receiving no financial support from anybody and I need to pull down a minimum of $1000/month.

EDIT: I'd like to add in that I spent a great deal of time the last 2 weeks looking for  a employer who could meet my needs in the area, but was unsuccessful in my efforts.

EDIT2: I decided I might get more responses if I do something like this...
If you have tried any of these to obtain any kind of income (or you have been able to make an educated estimate for these, please comment regarding them)

Slader - Solve academic problems for money, ~0.50cents/solution. I would estimate that it is possible to earn $10+/hr doing this and am giving this a trial run momentarily and I'll update with results. 
Results: Seems like it should be pretty easy money 50cents per solution, and royalty whenever people use your answer, so there is even some longterm money associated with it, but you don't get paid instantly, you only get payed when somebody votes for your answer as being correct, and who knows when/if that will ever happen. I'll probably aim to knock down 10 a day, every day, in my free time. Just to get royalties over time.

lionbridge/leapforce/butler hill - Something about searches, pays $12.50/hr. Has work minimums/maximums. I know little about this. (a more in-depth summary would be nice :P)

KGBAnswers - Answer people's questions, Pays $0.10/answer. I'd imagine it's possible to answer 2 questions a minute if you work like a bat out of hell, but they denied my application saying they don't need help currently

ChaCha - Answer people's questions, Pays $0.005-$0.20/answer. Reaching the $0.10/answer mark seems to be impractical as you need to wait 30 days before a pay ""promotion"".

I'll add more as people post them

EDIT3: Just thought I'd let everybody know that after deeming that I am unprepared to leave at the moment, I am just going to do late start classes in mid september, so that gives me a additional 2 weeks to get myself ready, in which time I think I'll be able to pull off.

1367965707.0,35,self.beermoney,1dw4lw,Join me in self-publishing on Amazon's KDP.,48,13,18,http://www.reddit.com/r/beermoney/comments/1dw4lw/join_me_in_selfpublishing_on_amazons_kdp/,"I've been constantly browsing /r/beermoney and money making sites like blackhatworld. I found a thread on BHW about publishing eBooks. You can create eBooks with absolutely no knowledge except for the content you write at: 

https://kdp.amazon.com

Sure it takes real effort to write something, but it helps if it's a topic you are very knowledgeable on and enjoy sharing about.

So let's get together and help each other create some great eBooks! I know I can help with design aspects of eBooks if you want to make yours look really good.

If you sell your eBooks exclusively on Amazon you can sell your book under KDP Select where they actually promote your book for you if it's profitable enough.

I think it would be great to even create collection of stuff from users here be it short stories or other random things (sky is the limit). I'd be willing to put it all together and we can all split the profits depending on how much work you put in.

This BHW thread has some more info (his methods are a little more black hat than what I want to do but you get the idea).

Some I’ve heard mentioned here and some I haven’t.  So I figured I’d share some of what I’ve learned and give back to the Reddit community that has helped me purchase frivolous shit on Amazon.  

I know we’re supposed to do the Ref/non Ref link thing but these are Apps so you just go to the app store and download them so I don’t know how that would work.  There’s probably a way but I don’t know it.  Actually I don’t even know how to make those cute blue link things for regular websites so it doesn’t matter anyway.  I’ll put my refs at the bottom if you want to use them.  If you are offended by my reddiquette transgression, then don’t use them.  I’m sorry. 

Swagbuck TV App-   If you aren’t already using swagbucks then this must be the first beermoney link you’ve ever clicked on.  Close this tab and open the link above and below it.  Someone else will tell you about it.  if you do use swagbucks you should really be using the app.  It’s free swagbucks for doing nothing.

  Be warned!-  I don’t have unlimited data on my phone plan and even when I use the wi-fi at my house it will switch to 3g after I’ve been streaming a while (insert greedy corporate conspiracy theory)  I fucked up and went over my limit and got hit with a charge because of this.  If you have data limits turn off your 3g in the settings options before running this app. 
 
Free App Win-   This App is daily drawings to win gift cards.  They have sponsored apps that pay the prizes.  You are invited to download more apps for more chances to win.  I’ve won the runner up prize of a dollar gift card a few times so I can personally attest that the site is legit. 
 
Realpoints-   Realpoints has you download apps for points, you can also do tasks like signup for stuff that costs more than the points are worth, and you can watch videos.  I like the videos because you can watch a lot of them but there’s a limit to how many.  That way I can reach a stopping point and not get locked into a never ending loop of videos.  It also has unlimited downloads for some apps but they don’t pay as much as one time downloads, but it’s good when you are almost up to a gift card and need a little bump.  

App Trailers-   Most everyone knows about this one but I’m putting it on here to make a case for it since I’ve heard a lot of complaining about it here on beermoney lately.  It pays out great when you first download it but the offers fall off quickly.  Most download apps don’t credit if you’ve already downloaded it somewhere else.  AppTrailers will often credit you when you download apps for other sites.  So even if you aren’t active on it you can still collect points.  Plus they have the daily scratch card that wins more often than not.  I hear they aren’t doing referrals any more.  Meh.

FreemyApps-   This has the highest payout to download ratio of all the apps that reward you for downloading other apps.  I’m still fuzzy on how this is a sustainable business practice but I’m gonna ride that wave till it crashes.  The offers trickle in slowly but that’s ok since sometimes you can earn enough points for a dollar giftcard in one download.  Plus, if you have a ton of these apps it’s nice to be able to check it and move on without feeling like you have to spend an hour downloading apps.  

SuperGiftcardReward-   I almost never have offers to download apps on this one and I can usually get more points elsewhere but you get points just for logging in every day so I keep it around since I have to devote roughly two seconds to it a day.  

AppCasher-   This is yet another download more apps for points deal, but it usually has the most apps available.  It also has videos you can watch for points sometimes.  

Lucktastic-   This app has seven scratch-off tickets a day that will reliably not win money.  But you get coins that you can save up for a $25 gift card to Amazon if you are very patient.  You can also spend your coins on raffles for ipods and stuff but I’ve never done it because I’m saving up for the gift card.  They claim to be working on more content, that would be nice.  They have no referral system that I know of.  

Free App Slots-   This one you have to find in your safari browser and make a link to your phone that way.  I’m not sure how that works.  It links to your Facebook page to know who you are.  You get two free spins on a slot machine a day and can earn more spins for downloading other apps.  It’s kinda glitchy right now but I’m sticking with them because I have a lot of points that I should probably cash in but I’m holding off for no good reason.  

Feature Point- more download fodder.  I’m pretty sure this is connected to FreeAppWin.  It’s new and hasn’t had a lot of offers lately but it has been picking up lately.

Dailybreak-   This one is my favorite.  You answer trivia questions to earn coins that can be spent on raffles and auctions for some really cool stuff and gift cards.  I haven’t won anything yet but my girlfriend’s son and I play it together.  He learns stuff and thinks we are playing while I rack up coins with his elementary school knowledge of geography and pop culture that I’ve forgotten or ignored in my middle age.  

SweepstakesFree-   This is real simple.  You press a big red button and it enters you for a chance to win $20 daily.  You get coins for every press (ten a day, once every two minutes).  Coins can be spent on an entry into a $100 weekly raffle.  You’ll be pestered with offers to download apps with every press but they aren’t pushy and it is little to no work.  

MobileRewards-   This has video, downloads and tasks.  This one is different because it pays out in either facebook credits (I don’t know what that is for) or directly to paypal.  I racked up a bit of points until I found out I don’t get gift cards and I don’t have a paypal account so I quit using it so I won’t give a referall code.   Do that Ref train the mods love so much.  

Offer Rewards-   This is an offshoot of AppTrailers.  Your apptrailer points even transfer over.  I wouldn’t even mention it but it has way more payout options than the other apps.  Ebay gift cards, Starbucks, all the video game points like Microsoft live, Best buy cards, fucking pottery barn, Paypal and a bunch more.  

Fly Points-   This is an offshoot of Realpoints.  It’s more of the same.  If you downloaded all the other stuff you’ll probably be so sick of these apps you’ll never touch it but hey, they have some videos and you might have a really boring job that has Wi-Fi.

Viggle-   With Viggle you hold your phone up to your TV when you watch something and it figures out what show you are watching and it gives you points.  I'm pretty sure I'm helping a government spy program but I use it anyway.  You only need to watch the show long enough to check in and it assumes you watch the whole thing.  If you check into something else it just unchecks you from the other show.  It has a sort of fantasy football game for more points during football games and trivia for other shows.  If you play it compulsivley for about four years a seven day cruise is available for 4 million points in the prize section.  Every once in a while Amazon giftcards will be available.

Mpoints-   I did Mpoint games for a week or so but I uninstalled them because the games all suck and I felt like a mouse hitting a button for pellets but I’m mentioning it because I heard about Mpoints for a while and could never figure out how it worked and their Facebook page sucks at telling you how to get started.  So I figured I’d help out any other confused people.  There is no app and there is no site to go to.  You just download one of the games/apps that are affiliated with Mpoints and it will sign you up from there via a grey bar at the bottom of the game.  You can start off with “Shoot da zombie”.   

Here’s my Ref Codes if you feel grateful.  Honestly this was more about sharing than a shameless ploy for referrals.  I’m not even going to put my Swagbucks Ref on here.

I'm in the planning stages of a new project - creating a directory of websites where you can earn beermoney, grocerymoney, rentmoney, etc.

I was wondering if you guys had any insights into what information or features would make such a site more useful for you?

I plan to include both editorial and user reviews of the sites, and allow user reviews over a certain length to include a referral link, so visitors can choose to reward the most useful reviewer with a referral.

Based on the most frequently asked questions here, I'm guessing I should include information about which countries are eligible for each site and also the minimum age for earning. Do you guys have any other suggestions?

1360607596.0,30,self.beermoney,18blo9,"My Daily Routine, some tips, earnings. ",42,12,27,http://www.reddit.com/r/beermoney/comments/18blo9/my_daily_routine_some_tips_earnings/,"So I used to just open sites as I felt like it, or focus on what was closest to cashing out and was all over the place what I used. So fairly recently I started getting into a daily routine, and my earnings are noticeably higher overall. So before I get into that some overall tips, and notes.

I think it is much easier to sign up for a site, spend a day or two with it, develop a routine than add a new site. I find personally and based on others who I have discussed this with, signing up for too many sites at once just gets you confused and makes you give up on the whole ""beermoney"" process. Use a site, develop a routine, then add another site. 

JunoWallet/Bamboo Wallet: This is [JunoWallet](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.junobe.android.junowallet&amp;amp;feature=nav_result#?t=W251bGwsMSwxLDMsImNvbS5qdW5vYmUuYW5kcm9pZC5qdW5vd2FsbGV0Il0.) on android, and [BambooWallet](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/bamboo-wallet/id492663955?mt=8) on iOS. Note on iOS it uses the app and m.junowallet.com together to get the complete functionality of the android app. Now, the reason I mention this up front and not in my daily routine, is because this isn't a daily use app. The reason for this is they have a Monday bonus. It takes all your earnings from Monday, and on Tuesday morning you get a bonus that is 25% of what you earned on Monday. So I only use this app on Monday, and try to get as much out of it as I can for that bonus. You can sign up with my code ""TH1272839"" when making your account, and you will start off with $0.25. Cashout is via gift cards to various stores, with amounts varying per store. Amazon starts at $5. 

Ok, now that we got the once a week app out of the way lets get to what I do every day when I turn my PC on and start my ""work"". 

Firstly I open 2 windows of browser. I make the left window take up a small amount of screen space and put Gift Hulk treasure box there. I just occasionally click the treasure box while I do other beer money sites in the other window. So lets start with GiftHulk.

[GiftHulk](http://www.gifthulk.com/refer/failedjedi) has you do various things for Hulk Coins. Complete offers, tasks, view ads, watch videos, etc. For the sake of this post I am only going to mention what I do. Every day I do the daily poll. Then I just do the treasure box in the one browser window. I have 146 daily clicks, a lot from referrals, and a lot from collecting bonus clicks as prizes every now and then. So I just click this every once in a while when doing other sites in the other window, until I use my daily clicks. That's it. This is all I do with gift hulk, it isn't a super high earner for me, but I put almost no work into it. [nonref](http://www.gifthulk.com)

Ok, so while I am clicking the treasure box, I go through other sites in another window. Starting with swagbucks.

[Swagbucks](http://www.swagbucks.com/refer/hudiho) is almost the same as Gift Hulk. Same ways to earn minus the treasure box. So what I do is quickly do the daily poll, then do the NOSO offers. After this I do a few searches and usually hit and get something after just a few searches. Then I go to special offers and try to do the lab45 survey, they are usually quick for a fast 45 swagbucks. After this I am done with swagbucks, other than occasionally throughout the day I check to see if there is swag code available at sc-s.com for some bonus points. If you sign up now and use swag code 5THBIRTHDAY you will start with a bonus 90 Swag bucks. [non-ref](http://www.swagbucks.com)

[Neobux](http://www.neobux.com/?rh=6661696C65646A656469) is next. This is a PTC site, you just view the ad and get paid. All I do here is check how my referrals are doing, get my required 4 clicks and that's all. I am currently reinvesting all my earnings to rent more referrals. You can only rent every week. Right now I make about .25/day and every week it grows by a few cents a day. once I get up to about 50/day I will start cashing out for profit some of my earnings, and reinvesting the rest. This isn't a super fast earner, but I only do my 4 clicks and let my rented referrals do the rest. [non-ref](http://www.neobux.com)

Next is [mturk](http://www.mturk.com). I check out /r/hitsworthturkingfor and try to spend less than 10min here. I usually do a survey or two. I make about $0.50-$1.00 a day as my goal. For a while I did this exclusively and got sort of burnt out, but have been trying to do it more, because it can be a great earner. 

[ClixSense](http://www.clixsense.com/?4870918) is next. It is a PTC like neobux. I usually do a click or 2 myself, check my referral earnings for the previous day, and maybe do an offer or 2 if there are any quick ones available. I also bought premium and HIGHLY suggest it. For $17/year it just about doubles your referral income. I made back the $17 in just under 2 months, and now have higher profits from referrals for the next 10 months. For sure worth it. [nonref](http://www.clixsense.com)

Next I go to bing rewards. I just do a search and click related a bunch until I hit my daily goal. 

Then [crowdini](http://www.crowdini.com). Just answer the question. answer in the majority and move on a day towards the prize. Takes about 10 seconds. 

Then I don't really do anything, but daily I usually check my balance on Topline. Other than that it is just passive. [Refferal](https://www.jointopline.com/?fid=CS6VL7ZJ9H45)  [nonref](http://www.jointopline.com)


Lastly is apps. I don't use these daily, I just sometimes open whatever app I feel like using at the time and getting some points. I should use them more but don't.

[Ibotta](http://ibotta.com/r/ptBaQ) is a newer service (atleast to me) that pays you to shop. When you open the app you see all the options of items. When you hit the item they have various tasks, most just take a second. Answer a poll, view a short ad (usually less than 10seconds), view the facebook page, etc. When you complete the tasks (you can do the tasks at home a head of time) you will get xx amount for buying the item. You simply buy the item, scan the barcode, upload a pic of the receipt and they deposit the amount in your account within 24 hours on weekdays. You have to have at least $5 to cash out and it is via PayPal. 

[Tapporo](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.tapporo&amp;amp;hl=en) is an android app very similar to bamboo wallet/junowallet made by the people who do gift hulk. It is not a gift hulk app, it is a completely seperate service, just run by the same people. Try apps, watch videos, complete offers and get points. Redeem points for rewards. They offer gift cards including amazon, as well as paypal. My referral code is TAPTH1423 and you will get a little bonus when you use it. 

[FreeMyApps](http://m.freemyapps.com/share/url/267a79c6) is an iOS app that has you try out apps for credits, then redeem them for amazon or iTunes cards, as well as various paid apps. Notably they regularly have $1 and $2 amazon cards that are easy to get, so you can cash out often. The ratio of credits to dollars is the same as the higher values, so no reason to save up and wait.

[FeaturePoints](https://featurepoints.com/r/P31E9Q) is similar to freemyapps. It is for iOS. Try apps, get rewarded. If link doesn't work you can enter code P31E9Q at sign up.

""Need money for gifts? Tell your friends about Amazon Student and earn $3 for each one who joins.""

Anyone with a .edu e-mail can sign-up, and it looks like you can sign-up as many people as you want! Amazon Student gives free 2-day shipping on anything sold by Amazon, and allows you to use their instant video service! I do believe that aside from a .edu e-mail, people also need a credit or debit card to sign-up. It should be free for 6-months though, and then they can easily drop prime after that if they want to, or they can keep it for an extra year for $40, which is a great deal!

I've tried HITS worth turking for, but don't understand why every time I click a link it asks me to download something.  

I really don't have time to do the transcription things- I do have a full-time job, so this is literally easy beermoney for me.  And the easier HITs seem to only pay $0.01-0.02.  It just doesn't seem worth 15 minutes of my time to earn a penny.  Is the only way to earn money on MTurk the really labor intensive, time consuming HITs?  And how does the HITsWorthTurkingFor subreddit work?  Why am I always taken to a download page, instead of taken to do a HIT?

Thanks guys, maybe I'm an idiot for not being able to figure this out, or maybe the only way to make good money is do the HITs I just don't have time to do, which is fine and I just won't use MTurk.  But people are saying they earn $150/month in just 10 minutes a day, so I'd really like to know how that's possible!

I've made £32.60 so far although I still need to pay out my AppRedeem which will give me $11 and my Global Test Market which will give me $50. My set up is biased towards those in the UK.


[**Valued Opinions**](https://www.valuedopinions.co.uk) **(£20)**
[Proof](http://imgur.com/VVywO)

Unfortunately the only way to refer someone is to have their email address. Anyway, this is a survey site which pays fantastically with £10 gift vouchers. I normally go for Amazon however there are lots to choose from. Each survey takes from 10-20 minutes and rewards between £0.50 and £3.00. The only problem is that it takes a while for the survey to credit you as they have to wait till the survey is over.



[**Survation**](http://survation.com/) **(£6.19)**
[Proof](http://imgur.com/x27cj)

You can't refer someone with this either. Another survey site but with this you can cash out straight to PayPal. Also, the surveys are often very relevant and enjoyable to do. They ask questions about the government and the state of the UK. They pay well however there is minmum payout of £5 and the surveys are a little infrequent.  



[**NatureBucks**](http://naturebucks.com/members/register.php?ref=mattgillan) or [Non-Ref](http://naturebucks.com/) **(£1.41)**
[Proof](http://imgur.com/g6InE)

This is the best site I can recommend. I have only spent the last 2 days trying to earn money on this site which is why I have so little. On each day I have made around £0.70 ($1.14) for about 20 minutes work. Basically you complete registrations, install apps and confirm email addresses to earn money. most jobs pay around $0.20. However sometimes you may not be credited for your work. The best tip I can give is to search for the last credited offers and try and go for the offers for points rather than money because those are the offers that seem to credit you. They also pay straight to PayPal within seconds.




[**Superpoints**](http://superpoints.com/refer/mattgillan1) **(£5)**

I think most people know about this site however I've found it quite easy to get points by going to the tasks tab. I often get 100-200 points for doing 45 minutes worth of tasks and you only need 1200 points to get a £5 Amazon gift voucher. Also you have to be invited to the site in order to join which I why there is only a referral link.



[**Topline**](https://www.jointopline.com/register?fid=Y8JJYWRTBJ6Z) or [Non-Ref](https://www.jointopline.com/)

This as many of you know is a passive way of earning income by simply browsing the web as you would normally do so. Adverts are replaced by Topline's adverts and when you land on a page with those adverts you get a point. 1000 points = $0.75 however that is likely to increase (or so I've heard). So far I've only earned 850 points so I don't have any proof of payment and you need to reach $10 to cash out.

Well I've stumbled upon another gem. 

* Jebbit is a well designed site **for college students**, that offers members money to ""jebbit"" featured offers, or to put it simply, view the featured offer. However, there's a catch. You can accrue more points, which in turn, means more cash by proving you actually read each offer, or link. You are then able to gain points and a ""bonus"" by correctly answering questions about the featured link.

* EXAMPLE: My first jebbit was to a new sports website. I clicked the appropriate link and received the initial amount of $0.10. After that, there are a series of multiple choice questions about the site such as: this site is similar to: A)Facebook B)Twitter C)Pintrest D)blah blah blah.   **The answer is always obvious, granted you view the link** 

* By getting consecutive answers correct, you accumulate points, which enable you to a ""bonus"" feature which requires you to go a little more in depth with a website, but rewards you accordingly. (With my jebbit of the sports website, it asked me where something was located when you navigate to a certain portion of the site)

* A very unique feature of this site is that it has its own store. This store is similar to Ebay. You can bid on certain items using points or cash.

* Pros - Minimum cashout for completing offers is only $2.00, A total minimum cashout of only $5.00(WePay), Payment at the end of each day, Unique site structure

* Cons - Only for college students with an .edu email address,

If you are interested in some general information about the site, [see my initial post here](http://www.reddit.com/r/beermoney/comments/11ox05/infoarmy_review_make_15hr_researching_businesses/).


**PayOuts**

If you are already on the site, then chances are that you got paid on the 30th! Here is my paycheck - 32 hours of work over two weeks (16 hrs/week) and $1430 cash to my Paypal. [Proof.](http://i.imgur.com/r4Pmx.png) The payment system is changing so you can **cash out at any time!** No restrictions. I'm very excited about this - it means I get my money much faster :)


**Waiting on a Senior Researcher**

InfoArmy was not ready for the rush of traffic from Reddit two weeks ago. Senior researchers literally had 30-50 reports in the queue at any given time. They are actively recruiting new SRs, so if you consistently create great reports, then you are a candidate. I became an SR after proving myself through my reports, and the ""hourly wage"" definitely goes up. Please be patient with us - your report will be addressed! The likelihood of being picked up also goes up if you have a complete profile filled out (including a picture!) and if you really tried on your report. 


**Stuck on researching something?**

I help tons of researchers every day find the information they are looking for as an SR. Please take your time on your first report and really learn what we are looking for in the help files - it will only help you in the long run! Trust me.



**More Than BeerMoney**

My monthly expenses as a college student are right around $500/month with rent, food, beer, and other miscellaneous things. If I spend an hour a day and write one report, I will make $600 every month. That's not only living for free, but I also have an extra $100 a month to put into savings! This isn't just BeerMoney - it's how I'm living for free without a real job.



**Questions?**

I've had a lot of success with InfoArmy so far - and I've only been a member for three weeks! Feel free to ask me questions :)

Realistically, you will be able to do about 2 a minute as it is not challenging in the slightest but I will pay on the basis that its boring as hell and you spend time breaking up the monotony by looking at pictures of cats elsewhere on reddit... so 1 every minute. 

Adding in a bit of time slippage, I will pay $5 an hour for 14 hours - $70.

I have no deadline, within reason, so I wont be chewing your arsehole off within a few days, but I would expect it to be done within a week or two.

If you are good with excel, I will pay more for organising the data for me in a specific fashion. 

If this goes well, I have a few more projects lined up...

If any interest, pm me please.

This subreddit is great, we have a great community helping each other out. We are all here for a common goal, and sharing any new sites is always welcome. Referral links are welcome as long as you provide information and a non referral link. Yet, for some reason, the past few weeks, it seems like every time someone comments with a referral link, even if the rules are met they get downvoted. This very obvious when someone asks for something specific. Recently someone asked for a list of sites that payout in paypal, we frequently get people asking for advice on what works in specific countries, or even they like a site and are looking for something similar. 

Then, presumably to see their  comment listed first if comments are displayed by score, they proceed to downvote every other comment. If there is another reason I would like to know, but unless you have a reason, downvoting every post with a referral link doesn't need to be done. If you go look at some of these posts people who comment without links stay at +1, but everyone who included a link in their comment gets downvoted. This isn't helping the community at all. If anything it is hurting it in the sense that if new people come and see a comment with a valid site, it gets downvoted a ton so they may think it is a scam. 

TL:DR I feel like lately there has been too much downvoting, and I think it is just so a few people can get their comments to the top by downvoting all the others.

In order to fit the post within Reddit's maximum length, I'll link to a few of my blog posts for specifics.

_________________________________

**Superpoints**

In April I cashed out **$65** from Superpoints, which is a considerable decrease from previous months. I've seen a drop in the button's payout and had some referrals stop using the site. I haven't tried to get additional referrals for myself over the past month either. 

[Click here](http://weblootcentral.blogspot.com/search/label/Superpoints) for details about the site, a tutorial, some posts about getting referrals, and invite links.

_________________________________________

**Swagbucks**

I've barely touched Swagbucks this month since so many people were getting banned, so I only redeemed **$10** in Amazon gift cards. It's still potentially nice,  but I haven't really wanted to put in the amount of time it'd take to earn from the videos.

It's another site that pays redeemable points for people who complete offers, watch videos, searching on their search engine, and take surveys. 

The big earner on Swagbucks is the video option. If you have a smartphone, they offer a free app that will automatically watch videos and gather points for you. On the computer, they've made it more difficult to automate, though many people are still doing it manually to get their daily points.

Searching is an easy way to get some points. After a few tries, you'll usually earn some points.  Points can be earned this way every few hours. If you get referrals, you also get points when they search.

**Hits4Pay/Deals 'n' Cash**

Open an ad, leave the page open while doing stuff in other tabs, earn a few cents. A month ago I was at $11.67, now I'm at **$34.94** on Hits4Pay. The referral system is quite good(1 cent per ad viewed by each referral or their referrals). I've started using Deals 'n' Cash as well, which is another website that does the same thing and is run by the same company. 

These are getting to be favorites of mine.

**PaidViewpoint**

A month ago I was at $12.49 with a trait score of 3000. I have since cashed out at **$15.06** and am now at $4.64 with a trait score of 4470.  I'm still really liking Paidviewpoint.

____________________________________

**Topline**

It replaces ads instead of blocking them and cuts you in on the revenue. The program is still in beta, but they have been responsive and delivered on adding features that were requested and promised. You can now see how many referrals you have and add sites to a list if you want to see the original ads so you can support whichever sites you like.  

Each 1000 points is currently worth 0.75, but that is expected to increase as they grow and attract more advertisers.  I'm currently at **$9.88** from about $7 a month ago and $2 the month before. Just remember that if you use any auto-reloaders, add the sites you use them on to the excluded sites list.

**Bing Rewards**

In an effort to compete with Google, Microsoft offers a rewards program for using Bing. Basically just click through a few things and do some nonsense searches for 20+ daily points. I cashed out a **$5** Amazon card last month and am back up to 398 points. I'll get my second $5 card at 475. 

[**Web Loot Central Post for more info**](http://weblootcentral.blogspot.com/).

I've hit the 25 point limit for referrals already, so help someone else out by using their invite if possible.

**Neobux**

After PTC sites were a hot thing around here for a week or so, I looked into a few. Of the ones I saw, most were scams and/or total junk.  Neobux was the only one that seemed trustworthy and potentially worth it. Basically you just let an ad load for a bit and get anywhere from 1 to 1/10^th of a cent.

Neobux lets you use your on site earnings to rent referrals so you get paid for their clicks as long as you see ads each day.  On Neobux, you can minimize the window and still get credit for the ad, so I don't mind it. It takes awhile to get going if you don't want to put in any money(I didn't), but potentially can be worth it eventually. I currently have 12 rented referrals and an extra 44 cents or so available. With every batch of rented referrals, I have noticed a considerable increase in earning rate.

__________________________________________

**Hubpages**

This one involves the most time but also has a lot more potential than most.

Hubpages is a nice option for people that like to write guides, political commentary, fiction, poetry, and whatever else. Obviously, you could always do a blog with ads as well, which would have a bit more potential, but Hubpages is a little easier make something that looks nice in my opinion and it's a little easier to promote.

In March I only made $3.85 with 3 articles(mostly just from one of them that had a wider appeal), but I liked the idea that they'd keep earning a few cents here and there as long as people stumble across them. Sure enough, I didn't touch them last month and they made me another $1.70. I'm going to start adding new articles and promoting them. After a couple months pass, I'll promote things I've already promoted for a new surge of readers and more money. If I get a decent pool of articles to do this with, I can hopefully make some decent cash.

If you don't want to write, you can actually promote other people's hubs with your own tracker and still get a portion of the adsense and affiliate earnings.

You can also refer new writers and get a matched amount for 10% of their lifetime earnings. Considering some, albeit not many, people really go nuts with it and actually make hundreds each month, that could be pretty sweet.

I think it should be possible to do very well and become my biggest earner, replacing Superpoints.

**World Winner** 

This one may be US only if I remember correctly. Basically you play(or open and close) promoted flash games for points that can be redeemed for points. I got a **$50** Amazon card from it. Unfortunately there is a catch. You can really only redeem a reward once. That's because you need to be a ""cash player"" in order to redeem the points. That isn't a big problem in and of itself, since you can put $10 on the site, redeem your reward and then cash that $10 back out right away. The problem is that once you're considered a cash player, you no longer get the promotions for large numbers of points. As such, I strongly suggest everyone save up for the $200 rewards instead of the $50 that I took.

[Probux](http://www.probux.com/?r=Sweetdaddy) / [non-ref](http://www.probux.com/) I find this one fun and easy and totally recommend it. You make money by doing small tasks (crowd flower), clicking on advertisements, clicking on the ProGrid (20 chances with prizes ranging from $0.10 to $2). Its a fun site where you can get direct referrals and rent referrals. I've been using it for almost a month now and have been able to cash out twice. Things start out slow, but once you get to the stage where yo uare renting refferals things start rolling nicely. Minimum cash out is $5

[Neobux](http://www.neobux.com/?r=Sweetdaddy5) / [Non-ref](http://www.neobux.com) this is a PTC very similar to Probux.  You make money by clicking ads, doing tasks, clicking a rotating Adprize game etc.  You earn money from direct referrals as well as rented referrals.  Both of these PTC's only require a few minutes a day and can build up quite well.  Lots of great help and advice here on reddit for neobux.

[Slice the Pie](http://www.slicethepie.com/?wyd=566666) / [Non-ref](http://www.slicethepie.com) You review music and get paid every 90 seconds. Payment is between 9 cents and 33 cents based on quality of review and bonus' going on at the time. I found this page really helpful on how to write reviews. [Guide to Slice the Pie](http://chasmac.hubpages.com/hub/slicethepie-reviews)

[CashNHits](http://www.cashnhits.com/index.php?ref=sweetdaddy) / [non-ref](http://www.cashnhits.com/) is a ""paid to click"" but the king of simple. You get paid to click on ads and such like a normal PTC but it also has an ""auto surf"" mode. You can just turn it on and let it run. A Popup appears but then you just minimize it.  Every 40 seconds or so it will refresh and you will earn money.I earn about $0.12 -$0.20 a day with auto surf and $0.05-$0.12 a day clicking on ads etc.

[Paid Viewpoint](http://paidviewpoint.com/?r=q2cma6) / [non-ref](http://paidviewpoint.com/) This is a short survey site, you get a bunch of 2 minute surveys that pay about 3 cents each but then as your trait score increases you get bigger paying surveys. I've just started getting the bigger ones and its pretty fun.  They pay out via PayPal so you have to be in a country that allows PayPal.

[Free Sports bet](http://www.freesportsbet.com/Sweetdaddy.html) / [non-ref](http://www.freesportsbet.com/)This is a sports betting site but you get paid for watching the videos in the side bar. Then you can make bets with the bonus money you have made from that. You can leave it running in the background just set up an auto refresh on your page. I usually leave it on in the background while I do other stuff and watch it rack up slowly. 

[Postloop](http://www.postloop.com/invite/Sweetdaddy/) / [non-ref](http://www.postloop.com/)   Postloop pays you to post on forums.  You make around 5-10 cents per post depending on your 
rating. When you sign up, You have to make ten posts to get approved first. Anyone from any country can join Postloop as long as you have excellent English grammar, pass the initial 10 post process and can receive payment via PayPal
Make sure you start a few new threads and comment on others. $5 is the minimum pay out.

First off, many of you may already know about this site and such, but this is for those who do not or who were not able to use it prior to this Christmas.

There is a site called ""freemyapps"" and what they do is pay you credits that you can redeem for gift cards and the like. You do not have to pay for any of the apps, unlike some other sites of this type. Their payout rate is 300 credits = $1. Some apps may be worth up to 450 credits though they hover at about 160ish. **NOTE:** It seems as though the Android apps are paying, on average, about 100 per download and are lower than that of iOS users.

To get the points, you go to the site, then you download the app from clicking on the link. That will then take you to the App Store / Play Store for you to download the application. Once it is downloaded and installed you have to open it for at least 30 seconds. It can be a bit finicky so just check after about 45 seconds or so. 

Personally, I wish that I had found the site sooner for I have been able to earn about $15 on amazon from them in the span of three days. (This has been paying more than mTurk, Swagbuck and Bing and in less time.) [PROOF](http://i.imgur.com/ISmKY.jpg)

NOTE: They install a ""profile"" which assigns your device ID or phone to an account but you do not have to provide a name or address for it.

Here are the links: [Non-Ref](http://m.freemyapps.com) | [Ref](http://m.freemyapps.com/share/url/b86f2818)

First, you sign up for an account (which requires a referral) and enter all your basic information. 

The main daily event to do is the SuperLucky button, which you can click 30 times a day if you fill in all your info. I open it in a separate window and click it while browsing reddit. Another easy way of gaining points daily, is checking your email. Superpoints sends out ""superlucky"" mail which will be worth a few points. Surveys are also available, but aren’t usually that good.


The biggest way of earning points is completing offers. 

**PSA: STAY ORGANIZED!** I have never received any surprise charges to my account and don't want anyone else to. Write down all your usernames and passwords as well as when the free trials expire on a sheet of paper or word doc. 

Now here's where the money comes in!! Go to get points and complete offers. I think almost all of these are under trial pay. 

Netflix			1250 pts

Blockbuster		722 pts (use promo code VIDEO)

stamps.com		700 pts

Real player super pass	500 pts

plink		         	350 pts

rhapsody premium	250 pts

Big fish games	700 pts(cost's 2.09, but you earn more than that in points).

If you complete all these offers, you will have 4,472  points which you can cash out for 25$ to paypal (3315 points) with 1157 left over for other gift cards. ORR you can get $25 and $10 gift cards to amazon.com with 122 points left over.

1342741681.0,30,self.beermoney,wug0c,Trojans in NeoBux Ads - Be careful out there!,30,0,25,http://www.reddit.com/r/beermoney/comments/wug0c/trojans_in_neobux_ads_be_careful_out_there/,"So today I was just going about my business.  I had all my ""normal"" tabs open, including NeoBux.  I just got a notification that I had a new ad to view, so I clicked on it without thinking otherwise.

What I had open in my browser of choice at work, Firefox, was the following:  Local Newspaper Website, Facebook, Reddit, Gmail, NeoBux, Google Groups and my internal work sites for admin of an extensive video conferencing network.

BAM!

My installation of Symantec Endpoint Protection popped up with some threats.  It was scanning, and the list kept getting longer.  They were located mainly in the recycle bin, but were in other places as well.  I then noticed that the action center flag had moved from it's normal place on the extreme right side of the tray to the extreme left side.  It then started flooding with messages about my computer being infected.

My computer then went crazy and I ended up getting the [System Protection 2012](http://malwaretips.com/Thread-System-Protection-2012-Removal-Instructions-Uninstall-Guide) Hijacking Trojan.  I held down on my power button until all was dark on my monitors.

I was at work at the time (a large midwestern university), and fortunately have plenty of other computers to use.  At first I attempted to run a Malwarebytes scan from safe mode.  It found 1 item, and removed it.  I thought I was spared, but I was wrong.

The virus had corrupted a file associated with Symantec, which keeps causing the machine to BSOD due to a page fault in normal mode within a couple of minutes.  I wrote down the file name on a post-it note, but I left it at work.  I can update tomorrow if any inquiring minds want to know.  I've been trying to uninstall Symantec completely in safe mode, but now I can't even get into safe mode, it just hangs.

Tomorrow I'm going to dry to deactivate my installations of Adobe CS6, as I only get 2 and then I'm SOL.  Wish me luck.  What makes it worse is that I've worked in computer/technical support for over 5 years - have been a tech-a-holic for 15 and never gotten a virus until now.

I've seen this and other variants hundreds of times, and successfully removed them.  This one is the worst one I've ever seen.  I haven't researched it extensively enough, but if it made me give up like this it could be coded for you mac users as well.  I would not doubt it if it's coded in Java.

I haven't given up on NeoBux yet, but I'm no longer using it for a long term strategy.  I'm just going to do my 4 clicks and get the hell out of dodge until I earn the $20 I've invested back.  I like to do my beermoney activities while at work, so I can enjoy the fruits of that labor while I'm not.  This however is not a risk I can take and is inexcusable.

tldr;  Got nasty virus from a NeoBux ad that requires a complete wipe of my computer, and I'm a computer tech, be safe friends.

I personally use [this site](http://www.usertesting.com) more than the sites I'll list below. Essentially, the site has a pool of ""testers"" that get sent an email to participate in a usability test. On average, I'll get about 4 emails asking me to participate per day (although I do not qualify for all of them).

Each test requires that I perform a given set of tasks, while having an web-app running that records me saying my thoughts out loud and using the website. You record for 10-20 minutes, answer 4 quick questions about your thoughts or issues with the site and then submit the recording and answers.

Each test pays $10 through PayPal in 30 days or less. Anytime I'm getting paid through UserTesting, I'm averaging $20/hour. I enjoy it because I get to test beta versions of big-name websites and help make new services more user-friendly.

Other websites that offer similar services (but don't offer nearly as many tests)...

I've done some of these things with moderate success, and I feel I can rework what I do make sure I reach the $100 mark. For example, Fulfillment by Amazon can be highly lucrative, but only if you don't buy too much stock from the get-go. If you can keep the job, you can easily meet the requirements by being a search engine evaluator. My HubPages accounts only reach around $.30 a day, but if I can get it to $3.33, then I can reach $100 per month.

What do you think? You do you know of any sites where you can sell specialty items? Have you had any success with any of these ideas, or are there any failures I should be concerned about?

I didn't include ideas such as selling hair because I don't feel they're repeatable every month.

1342202708.0,30,self.beermoney,widil,"Unload games, movies, tablets, phones for beer money easily with Glyde",39,9,19,http://www.reddit.com/r/beermoney/comments/widil/unload_games_movies_tablets_phones_for_beer_money/,"To my friends I call Glyde 'eBay for the lazy', but it could just as easily be 'eBay for the housebound, the apathetic or the extremely busy'.
  

I'm not saying eBay is difficult, but part of using it is listing the item (deciding condition, description, photo, setting start price), answering questions about posted items, confirming payment, printing address label and packaging item for shipment and taking the packages to the post office if you don't ship from home.
  

For me the answer was Glyde.com. I was introduced to Glyde via a free shipping deal where I purchased Assassin's Creed II for $6. Once I got my game in the mail in perfect condition and learned how the site worked, I immediately started going through all of my old Xbox, Nintendo DS and PS2 games and listing a few to see what happened. As of today, I have sold 8 of the 9 games I have listed. I just list them (takes about 3 minutes) and forget it.
  

Glyde is a place to buy or sell video games, movies, smart phones and tablets. They are basically the middle man and the sales are between two independent parties but facilitated by Glyde. Before you press the List for Sale button they will tell you exactly what their cut and your take will be.
  

**How Glyde works:**  
*Find a game, DVD, etc laying around your house that you'd rather turn into cash.  
*Search by item title on Glyde.com.  
*Click on the version you are selling (which platform, regular or special edition, etc) by clicking on one of the pictures that pop up.  
*Click 'Sell this Game' then choose the condition from the descriptions that pop up by clicking on new, excellent, good, or disc only.  
*Choose a price using the up down arrows and see what your cut would be (there is a maximum price specific to each item so that can be a big downside)  
*Click on ['List for Sale'](http://i.imgur.com/tJNxx.png)
  

You're done. That's it, forget about it and move on. 
  

When something sells you will receive a 'congratulations you sold XXXX' email from Glyde. In about 3 days you receive a pre-addressed padded envelope and packing materials for the item. Open the envelope, slip your item inside, seal it up (all of mine have been self sealing) and hand it back to the mailman the next day.
  

In my experience, while I feel that I could eek out more money per sale by using eBay, I don't know of any easier way to rid my house of games and dvd's that I am sick of hanging onto and in all honesty wasn't going to list otherwise. It's obviously not a sustainable moneymaker, as you will run out of things in your house to sell, but I wish that I had known about this earlier and I am definitely making a dent in my stored games.
  

So far my earnings are $44.19. I use the term earnings loosely, in that instead of cashing out via bank deposit or physical check, I have bought more games! But it has given me a way of turning my unwanted games into wanted games leaving my own money in my pocket.
  

*Non referral: http://glyde.com/  
Referral: http://glyde.com/?rid=2pjymv  
(The referral link is good for $5 off your first purchase; defeats the purpose of Glyde for beer money, but thought it was important info to include).*
  

If it is inappropriate for this to be in beer money please let me know and I will delete it. I didn't see anything in the sidebar that limited money makers to click to pay only.
  

**Edit**: For those who do take an interest in Glyde and getting their friends involved, you can apply to be a Glyde Ambassador. Referrals from a Glyde Ambassador give not only you credit, but also the referred person an exclusive $5 discount. Yes, I am a Glyde Ambassador and that's why my referral link gives new customers $5 off.

This has been really rare because iPods were given away also. Now the iPods have all been giveaway the ad is more common, and is only for the gift card.

Speedtest.net uses iAds exclusively and TV guide app uses other services as well as iAds.

Best strategy is just keep opening and closing the Speedtest app until you get the coke one.

I won $12.50 and an iPod before and got both. So it pays out fine. As well as a few gift cards since they started running the ad more. Use multiple emails and win multiple times. 

Quick edit: It says takes up to 48hours. I won twice today and both times got the code within 5 hours. Also both times gmail put it in spam, so double check there after a few hours if you don't have the code yet. 

Edit 2: Tip: tap, you don't have to swipe, just tap the bottles. Also US only. 

Edit 3: more research into iAds show that iAds are targeted based on phone activity. To opt out of this and see all ads go to http://www.oo.apple.com on your device.

**Silver**

**Requirements:**

1. Complete the Welcome to Rewards tour
2. Complete the Welcome to Bing tour
3. Pick a reward and set it as your goal
4. Earn 200 lifetime credits

Doing the tours actually net you additional points and all you have to do is click  links to get credited.

**Benefits:**

* A One-time 50 credit Bonus

**Gold**

**Requirements:**

1. Redeem credits for Your First Reward
2. Earn 750 lifetime credits
3. Each Month: Do 150 rewardable Searches, up to 20 per day

**Benefits:**

* Up to 5% credit discount on Microsoft Points
* Up to 5% credit discount on Xbox Gold subscription
* **Up to 10% credit discount on all other rewards**

Amazon Gift Card prices go from 525 down to 475.

Tango Gift Cards prices go 523 down to 470.

If your already using Bing, theres not much additional effort to get to gold and you can get your Amazon Gift Cards slightly faster.

---

If your not using Bing Search Rewards and wondering what it is. It's Microsoft's way to incentive users to use Bing.  They're offering users points for searching each day which are redeemable for various gifts like Amazon Gift Cards, Microsoft Points, Hulu Subscriptions, and Skype Minutes.  I would say its very similiar to Superpoints, in that you just search 20 times every day, do 1 bonus click for 3 points, and then every month pick up a $5 Amazon Gift Card.

To get started you should make sure you have a Windows Live Account, they will pay you through that email.

To make your life easier, set Bing to be your homepage on IE (or another browser you don't use) and just open it once a day to do your 20 searches.  There's no captchas and you can do all your searches for the day in less than 2~3 minutes.

Basically, I've automated 2 things: Neobux ad-clicking and the Super Lucky Button at Superpoints.  I'm not sure how you guys are going to feel about this; it seems like some of you endorse the bots/apps to view videos on Swagbucks and the like, but others are weary of being banned for these types of things.

Before I go and release this stuff to everyone here at beermoney, I wanted to gauge support.  If you guys are worried about being banned and don't want to use it then I'd rather not risk releasing it at all.  But if there are enough people here that are truly interested then I wouldn't mind the associated risk if it benefits the community as a whole.  In case you guys are interested, I'll tell you a little about how they both work.

**==SUPERPOINTS==**

~~The Superpoints script I wrote is very simple, but it does come with some risk.  Because the button is a Flash object, it's not as simple to automate.  To make it easy on myself I used a third-party tool; you MUST use this third-party software to run the script.  Basically there are 2 scripts at the moment: one logs you in, the other clicks the button as many times as you tell it.  There are better ways to do this, but I'm lazy.~~  So, I spent some time today looking into this and made this into a Chrome extension too.  I won't be able to test it until tomorrow, but it seemed easy enough once I figured out what I needed to do.  Currently there's only one negative point, but I'm not even sure if it's a problem:

**(a)** ~~The third-party software is not free (but it can be ""obtained"" for you scallywags)~~

**(b)** ~~By default the software runs in its own browser, so Superpoints could probably monitor this easily IFFFF they caught on (which apparently they haven't because I wrote this myself and I'm probably the only one doing it right now).  But you can configure this to imitate Internet Explorer to be more stealthy.~~

**(c)** ~~You can run it in the background, but it pops up and closes some annoying boxes a lot and makes noises.  Occasionally it gets stuck because this software is kind of crappy, but I'd still rather do this than click the button 30 or 50 times a day.~~

**(d)** I understand that when you win 25+ points you get a referral link.  This script totally ignores that.  From the referral page, can you tell which links are 25/50 point links?  If not, the script needs to be updated to save these links into a file so you can get to them afterward.

**==NEOBUX==**

Now on to Neobux.  From a technical perspective, it was easier to make a bot for this one, but more time consuming.  I decided to create a Chrome extension for Neobux to keep it under the radar.  The way I see it, it's a bit less detectable because you activate it by clicking a button in Chrome after you've logged in to Neobux.  It opens the ads and closes them in your Chrome browser, so it should appear much more ""human-like"" since it's nearly mimicking your behavior.  There are a few negative points here as well, some of which can be fixed:

**(a)** ~~I haven't quite finished automating the ""ad prize"" links; I personally find them pretty useless, but maybe some of you might want that feature.  I can do it, I just haven't.~~  I was bored just now, so I added this.

**(b)** It doesn't actually CLICK the ads at the moment; I used a cheap method by grabbing the ad links and just having the extension open them by itself.  As far as I can tell this is currently undetectable by Neobux, but I might look into fixing this for safety's sake.

**(c)** There's no sort of auto-refresh right now, so it only clicks the currently available ads.  Personally I think this is the best way to do it because if it keeps refreshing and clicking all day it will be obvious to Neobux and everyone is going to get banned.  The bot already reduces all the clicking and waiting you normally do down to 1 click, so I think it's rather useful already.  I probably will consider having it click your ads for you once a day so you don't have to remember because that seems really helpful, but probably will not make it click constantly because that just seems downright bold and dangerous.

**(d)** ~~One problem I noticed is those silly sites that bring up the alert box saying ""Are you sure you want to leave this page!?""  I'm not totally sure if those cause a problem outside of the tab not being closed, but I'd like to see if it disturbs the bot overall and also see if I can fix it.  At the moment it may not be fixable due to technical limitations, but I'm going to look into it.~~  I looked into this and it appears fixable.  I made a test page that has the nagging alert box and was able to squash the popup using a Chrome extension I wrote.  99% sure this is done.

As far as the Neobux bot goes, there are extra tricks you can do so you don't have to sit there and wait for the bot to finish.  In other words, you can get it to run mostly in the background.  Same with Superpoints except the caveats I mentioned.  If you have 2 monitors then it's even better.

**==CLOSER, REFERRAL LINKS==**

Well, that's all I really have.  I just wanted to see if any of this sounded good or bad to everyone.  I really just wrote this stuff for myself because I bored, but I thought maybe you guys might want to use it too.

I currently have no Superpoints referrals, so if you haven't signed up for Superpoints maybe you could help me out by using one of my links.  If you do sign up, please fill out your profile to 100% completion by putting in your info and adding a photo.  **Currently my referral links are listed on [the337's centralized Superpoints referral page](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0Ai6bOVwXB9nLdFVjZHRLcVlpSVJyWERPMVMxaXVINVE#gid=0) under my Reddit username 'dynis'.**  If you're already signed up, just let me know you're interested in this thread.

I don't have a Neobux referral link because I've only been on there for about 3 weeks.  If everyone seems really interested in the Neobux Chrome extension then I'll try to smooth out any kinks and release it in the next 2 weeks.  By that time I should have a Neobux referral link for anyone who is signing up to use the bot.

**==WHO'S IN?==**

So tell me beermoney, are you with me or against me?

P.S. If you have any daily tasks you want automated I may be able to help.  Let me know what it is and I'll see what I can do.

P.S.S. Start following [the337's guide](http://www.reddit.com/r/beermoney/comments/oq98x/superpoints_centralized_referral_document/) by putting your referrals into the spreadsheet.

I'm only trying to share a method that I've been using since February of year which has gotten me $240 so far. I even took out my referral link on the blog I made which explains how to do this.

For those of you who aren't familiar with Swagbucks, it's a search engine site where you earn Swagbucks for searching. But that's not the only way of searching. You can also watch videos for Swagbucks in Swagbucks TV. The Swagbucks you earn can be used to redeem $5 Amazon gift cards (don't buy the $25 or $50 because their Swagbucks to dollar ratio are much worse).

So in a nutshell, you pick a video, set it to refresh every 35 seconds. Leave this on for about 3 hours (6 hours right now since they've doubled the maximum you can earn per day until the end of the year) and you'll earn 75 Swagbucks per day (150 per day until the end of the year). Do the math and you'll have enough for 5 $5 Amazon gift cards (you're only allowed to buy 5 per month). For more of a ""tutorial"" go to http://swagb.blogspot.com/

**TLDR; Leave computer on for couple hours every day. Make $25 Amazon every month. http://swagb.blogspot.com/ for more details**

EDIT: Here's some proof: http://imgur.com/OdX0C

It's an android-app that displays ads as your smartphone-background for about two seconds after you unlock your screen. I've been using it for two weeks now. No problems at all, my account balance is slightly above 2€. This does NOT interfere with your using the phone in any way. You don't have to wait until you can keep using your phone - Ads are screen background only. If you put a large widget on your home screen you pretty much won't see them at all if that's what you wish.
You provide a German or Austrain bank account, they send you 1ct - you enter the code from your bank statement online to confirm your account.


**Payment**

You get paid 1,8 ct (€) per ad viewed - They display ""up to 27 ads a day"", which **totals 15€ a month** for doing nothing at all. 
As the company is fairly new (German branch was founded only last week) the number of ads they display is much less at the moment, but steadily growing. 
When I started 2 weeks ago I got six ads/day, now I'm up to 8/9 ads daily. 
Payment is not tied to a threshold, whatever is in your account gets send to your bank on the third of each month.

**Referral program**

When signing up, other users can enter your number code. You can refer up to 50 users. If a user you referred stays active for 90 days, you get a once-payment of 1€. If they keep using, you get an additional payment of 4€ as soon as their (the referred new user's) account balance reaches 25€.
If I understand everything correctly, the referral program will end in november (or be replaced by a different one?) My code is 166019.

With all the recent posts about coin generation, a ridiculously shady site, I wanted to remind everyone that genuine passive money making is possible.

Gomez Peer is a small java application which you install on your computer and let it run in the background. It occasionaly does some processing and uses a small amount of your internet connection. Unlike coingeneration Gomez Peer is a reputable company which does not want to build a super-computer for unrevealed reasons. Gomez Peer supplies network and website diagnostics to large websites. They need a large network of computers to perform tests on exactly how websites perform all over the world.

Once you register an account and install the application your account will be listed as pending. I'll let the site's FAQ explain it all:
&gt;All pending PEERs are continuously considered for activation. Gomez selects which PEERs to activate based on validated System Characteristics, System Activity and business need. Make sure you download, install, and run the Gomez PEER application to accrue system activity. Only peers with accrued system activity will be made Active; the more accrued activity the more likely it is that a PEER will be activated when there is an increased demand for testing in your location. 

I was only pending for a few days, although I do live in one of their prefered countries. If you have any problems becoming activated check out their [best practices guide](http://www.gomezpeerzone.com/best-practices/).

You only earn money whilst your computer is processing information the rates per country can be found [here](http://www.gomezpeerzone.com/current-payment-rates/), it is also a list of all countries which are eligible. UK users get paid at $0.001 per minute, US users $0.00025 and Canadian users $0.0005.

Gomez Peer automatically pays you at the end of each month if you meet the cashout, $5, if you don't meet the cashout your money is rolled over to the next month. They only payout through Paypal and you have to use the same email for Gomez Peer.

If you have any questions I'll answer them as best I can - Here is the site's [FAQ](http://www.gomezpeerzone.com/faq/)

I've been using this site for about 3 months now and I made $62 on it, which has been transferred to my paypal already. 

You make money by completing offers like signing up for stuff (although I must warn you this is often a bit bugged it seems) for doing surveys and for doing crowdflower tasks. The crowdflower tasks usually pay less than the same crowdflower taks on different sites (like neobux), however every now and then they'll have a task that isn't on any other site and that pays a lot (yesterday for example there was a task that earned me $20 in an hour that wasn't on any other site I know of).

I also definitely recommend this site for non-Americans because it works well in other countries and sometimes even has advantaged (like tasks in your mother tongue that pay more than english tasks).

I see just about everyone here is already familiar with the basic concept of [FeaturePoints] (https://featurepoints.com/r/VDH2U3) so I'll get to my tip. On the home screen, select the app worth the most points, on the second screen, select ""Download and Earn points'. Let it open in the app store then exit out without downloading it. Open featurepoints again and select the next highest paying app and go through the steps like before. Do this until there are no more apps available. After an hour or so, open featurepoints and scroll to ""Pending Rewards"" at the bottom of the home page. Select one of the apps and on the second page, select ""Download and Earn points"". Chances are you won't be redirected to the app/play store like before. Instead a page will open in your browser from SponsorPay saying ""We're sorry, this offer is no longer available, choose a different offer below to earn points"". There will be a couple ""watch this trailer/video/commercial to earn points!"". Watch the short video. Exit browser, open featurepoints, and boom. The credits from ""downloading"" the app PLUS watching the video both will be added to your balance. Do this with every app in the ""Pending Rewards"" section. If one of the apps goes to the appstore/play store, exit and wait a bit longer. I usually let them sit for a day in my ""Pending rewards"" before messing with them, simply because the longer you wait, the more likely it is the offer to download them has expired. They stay in your pending rewards section for 3 or 4 days, so there's no need to rush through them all right away. I saw in a recent thread that featurepoints is iOS only, it's not. My roommate has a galaxy and has been using it for months. Now, onto everyones favorite part! [FeaturePoints] (https://featurepoints.com/r/VDH2U3) is an app for iPhone and Android devices where you download free apps to get credits, and you can redeem them for Amazon, PayPal, iTunes, and iPad minis! Use my [referral] (https://featurepoints.com/r/VDH2U3) to get a bonus 50 credits at sign up! Or simply enter VDH2U3 under ""referral code"" during the sign up process!

All these cash out to Paypal or Amazon.ca giftcards.  They do have other methods of payment on some of the sites.  I setup a separate e-mail address for most of the sites, and glad I did.

Amazon gift cards reward sites
**Swagbucks** We don't have the Swagbux mobile TV app, but I can usually get 2-3 $5 Amazon.ca giftcards in a month.  I just have the SBTV playing in a browser while surfing and using the other sites bellow,  use the search instead of google to get some bonus points, and the days I answer surveys I usually get the bonus swagbucks for the day. [Ref](http://www.swagbucks.com/refer/altek) - [Non Ref](http://www.swagbucks.com)

**Tellwut** Almost at my first payout of a $15 Amazon.ca giftcard.  You need to earn 6000 points answering surveys.  You 5 or 10 point per survey.  It looks like you can earn 6000 points in 2-3 weeks. They are simple one page surveys that take very little time to answer. You can also earn points creating surveys. [Non Ref](http://www.tellwut.com/)

Paypal payment
**Nature Bucks** They have some surveys to answer, some PTC links, software trials you can download.  You get either points or cash.  They convert 1 point to $0.01. Min payout is $0.05 and they pay pretty quick. [Ref](http://naturebucks.com/members/register.php?ref=Dagmond) - [Non Ref](http://naturebucks.com)

**Slice the pie**The most fun site to earn beer money on.  You write song reviews after listening to at least 90 seconds of the song.  The min payout is $10 and I have been paid 5 cents to 30 cents per review, but I can usually cash out once a week, to a week and half. The payout takes a day or 2.  I use this [guide](http://chasmac.hubpages.com/hub/slicethepie-reviews) to help write reviews. [Ref](http://www.slicethepie.com/?wyd=537326) - [Non Ref](www.slicethepie.com)

**CloudCrowd**This one is through facebook, and you complete microtask, they pay direct to paypal every business day. You can earn credentials to open up more tasks,  and build up credibility to get access to more tasks.  I find the amount of work varies, they always seem to have lots of writing and editing tasks available. [Ref](https://www.cloudcrowd.com/i/9cotir) - [Non-Ref](http://www.cloudcrowd.com)

**Clickworker** Not a lot of work has shown up, but it may be available in other parts of the world or for people who do better on the testing.  Min payout is $10 [Ref](http://www.clickworker.com/become-a-clickworker?utm_source=341620&amp;utm_campaign=CW4CW&amp;utm_medium=email) - [Non Ref](www.clickworker.com)

Very passive money earners.  I have these running 24/7 because my PC is always on and I don't pay for electricity.  
**eBesucher** Just started this one,  you install an addon and it shows different websites(some have been nsfw) and you get credits that you trade for Euros and they pay them into a paypal account. You can also earn credits by getting e-mails, and opening the links on the e-mail.  I have the e-mails set to just go to my internal e-mail box on the site. Min payout is 2 Euros.[Ref](http://www.ebesucher.com/?ref=dagmond ) - [Non Ref](http://www.ebesucher.com)

**Gomez** I just started this one a week ago, and have not been approved yet to start earning money. It takes 2 weeks to get approved.  You leave a program running and it uses your computer to process data.  It shows a potential earnings until you are approved, and in the past week it is a little over a $1.  $5 min cashout [Ref](http://www.gomezpeerzone.com/application-apply/?Referrer=Dagmond) - [Non Ref](http://www.gomezpeerzone.com)",,False,,t5_2s5or,False,,,True,t3_1bcvdf,http://www.reddit.com/r/beermoney/comments/1bcvdf/beer_money_sites_that_work_outside_the_us/,

Things I should not have bothered trying in the first place:

* signed up on too many sites at once—too many to keep up, drove me crazy
* SuperPoints (never saw the shutdown coming at all \*stupid\*)
* Topline (even though I liked it at first and was amused by the pen ads)

Since the system changed I made $30 my first month and $60 my second. After seeing my December bonus results (about $2 per report) I might consider returning! I made a little analysis of the new payment system which I think is pretty interesting.

Which will be more profitable:

- Updating old reports quarterly and getting their bonuses

OR

- Completing the same number of reports (26) that you currently have each quarter and not updating the previous quarter's.

Option 1 will take a little bit less time but you only get paid by bonuses

BUT

Option two will get you the $10 reward plus 3 months' worth of bonuses. And not only that but you also add $260 to the general fund.

I guess it is clear which the better option is.


PS: I have been extremely busy getting ready for the move as well as college so the InfoArmy video I promised was postponed. I will get to it as soon as possible, I hope everyone understands.

Now how it works is you do searches on Bing, each 2 searches gives you one point, for a total of 30 points daily, plus a 1-3 point daily click. Think of each point as a penny, 500 points is equivalent to 5 Dollars, or can be used for Xbox Live points or memberships, Amazon gift cards, something called the tango card which can be redeemed for a check regarding how much is on it, etc. 

Now the best thing to do with this, is save your points until you get about 800, and but one of the 10 point award vouchers, this will give you gold status, gold status takes a discount off everything you can redeem, so for instance an Xbox live points card for 400 points goes from 500 to 475, making it much easier to get more.

They pay quite a lot for you taking surveys. Trouble is that the surveys are pretty long, around 5-10 minutes per survey (which compared to say PaidViewPoints is *very* long).
The surveys pay about 40 points, and 1000 points redeem for 50 dollars, so you're really making quite a lot of money quite fast. You can only cash out at 1000 points, which is too bad, but I can live with it when I make 40 points per survey. What really stands out is that when you try a survey and don't ""fit the target group"", you get 25 points.
On the other hand, I haven't had many surveys yet (1...) but I'm sure it will be about 1 per day (so I have been told).
Though I can't tell how the ""cash"" is redeemed, I'm guessing it's via paypal or something alike.

I'm pretty certain this is a legit survey website, and though it might make more than just beer money, it takes you another 5-10 minutes per day.

I will edit if something comes up, and it turns out this website is shit.

Obviously, here is the website:

I thought, ""There must be an easier way!""

Well, there was.  I just headed on over to [Conduit custom toolbar maker](https://accounts.conduit.com/login/), and made a toolbar myself.

[**here is a picture of it, and how I've customized it**](http://i.imgur.com/hQ7fp.png)

By using the toolbar, I get to click the button 100 times, by the time I finish watching my daily Yogscast video on youtube, or NCS or Chuggaaconroy etc.  Easy Peasy, makes the website more passive then active.

You're free to use my toolbar if you want,

**Edit 2:**  You know, I've been looking to **give away** the game [Rochard](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gshH3iE4EiA) to someone.  I actually had 3 copies, and gaveaway 1 so far.  **How can you win a copy?**  Read below:

I use beermoney (online money making) solely for the reason to put money in my Paypal, and buy video games.  I already have a shet load, so I play my games and record my commentary for let's Plays on my youtube channel.  I want my viewers to share my experience I have with games, so I do giveaways on my videos off the money I make from Swagbucks or Superpoints or Topline etc.

So if you want to win a copy, [Sign up for Superpoints.com](http://superpoints.com/refer/coreywebrown) and reach basic membership (verify your email, fill out basic account info).  Once you've done that, friend me on Steam:  my ID is **Wowbringer** and ***IMMEDIATELY*** INBOX ME HERE ON REDDIT the name you signed up under on Superpoints.

The **first 2 people** to register under me, and to have reached basic membership, will win a copy of Rochard.",,False,,t5_2s5or,True,,,True,t3_tit5v,http://www.reddit.com/r/beermoney/comments/tit5v/did_you_know_can_you_click_the_superlucky_button/,

They offer 20% commission on each sale. Sex toys can have pretty high price tags, so this can add up fast. I've also tried a few other sex toy websites' programs, but none of them have resulted in much profit (mostly because they don't have the same selection).

I've gotten a lot of my profits off of r/sex by simply recommending toys to people with my referral tag on the link. I've also made a few infographics with links to suggested products and circulated them around. I can imagine other creative ways of getting links out there--commenting on porn video websites, mentioning them in advice forums, blogging about sex advice.

I wouldn't necessarily recommend it to someone who doesn't know anything about sex products, but there's not a lot to learn, and Eden Fantasys has a lot of articles readily available about what materials are compatible with what and so on.

When I'm really being active I can make a good chunk of change. [Here](http://imgur.com/CZpBI) is the first big check I got. Even when I don't actively post links I find the stuff I've already posted brings in about $50/month on average.

I feel like it's an untapped market because it makes people uncomfortable, so they're less likely to shop around than with other things, and people offering advice are fewer and farther between.

I put a column for reddit username, date that the referral was posted, the referral link itself, bonus point amount (if any), and if the link is alive or dead. 

A few guidelines on how to use the document:

1. When posting your referral invite link please post it at the bottom so we can instruct new invitees to start from the top of the list to use an invite. 
2. If you have a position towards the top and your invite gets used and you want to put a new referral link please post it at the bottom of the list so we have kind of a rotation.
3. If you are new and use someone's link please mark it as dead. If you are new and click on someone's link and it's already been taken please mark it as dead so other's will know. Please don't delete it. Let the owner come back and delete it and post up a new link on his or her own.
4. Please limit the number of invites posted to five per person. This seems like a reasonable number but we could change this if we think it's too low or too high.

Find a niche you are interested in and create a blog about it. Then you do reviews or highlight certain products in your blog that you also advertise. 

**WARNING THIS WILL TAKE 1 DAY TO LEARN AND A FEW WEEKS TO BUILD** But hey, if your waisting your time earning 25 cents reading pointless articles and filling in bubbles, take a break, read on and research the internet.

***The Idea:** The first and foremost thing you must consider is the idea. You need something that is entirely original and that you know something about. What is the purpose of your blog going to be? Will you provide information? Will you sell a product? Deciding the concept and how you can present it should come before any hopes of making money with the blog. This is necessary to establish yourself and it also helps you keep your focus.

**The Brand:** Once you have an idea and have created the blog you will need to brand yourself. A brand is nothing more than your identity. Think of your favorite business and what do you see? Often a logo, specific colors and maybe even what they are known for. The same should be true of your blog. You will have a logo, design and something you become well known for.

**The Traffic:** Nothing is as important to your blog in the beginning as traffic. People need to be on your site to be reading it. This means you have to get them there. Short of emailing people, this will require some advertising and marketing. There are many ways to accomplish this. Friends and family. Social Networking sites. Related blogs. Forums. All of these are valid ways to promote your own blog.

**The subscribers and List:** Once you have the traffic flow you need more. You need them to subscribe to your blog and join your mailing list. There are many ways to do this. Offer contests. Give away free items. Whatever you find that works is suitable as long as it encourages people to sign up.

**The Content:** Now that you have readers it is important to keep your content up to par. Your readers expect something from you and you want to give it. Think about your target audience. Imagine what they would like to see. Now take the time and write for them. This will make your content valuable and you will see better results.

Unfortunately this is not something that will happen overnight, it will take time. But once you do put the time in, you could be making a lot of money.

**HireWriters** *INTERNATIONAL*

http://hirewriters.com


This website provides anywhere from &lt;150 word articles, to 1000+ words. There is usually a fairly decent amount of options for articles to write. They also allow people to ask for rewriting and editing of pieces of writing.  
Payments change depending on what level your account is, but beginner writers get about 1c per word. Once you do a few articles and get good reviews for them, you will go from beginner and progress through the ranks, opening up more options for articles to write and better pay per word. *Cashout minimum is $10.*
***
**iWriter** *INTERNATIONAL*

http://iwriter.com


iWriter is similar to HireWriters. I find iWriter has less work available for lower level writers. The clients also tend to have worse descriptions for what they want on this site, from what I've seen. You don't generally get to 'rewrite' articles on here.  
The payment is roughly the same as hirewriters and has similar article length. *Cashout minimum is about $20.*
***
**SliceThePie** *INTERNATIONAL*

http://slicethepie.com


If you frequent this subreddit, you probably know this one already, but slice the pie is a music review website. You essentially just listen to at least 90 seconds of a song the site gives you, then review it based on various musical aspects. The reviews are checked by a computer to make sure they're not all exactly the same and that they're all good quality. You are payed ~10c per review, but it can be as low as five or as high as 30, if I remember correctly, all based on quality and number of musical terms, etc.  
The amount of songs available to listen to is almost endless, so you can work for as long as you want. You have ""Energy"" which is used up when you do reviews, but it regenerates very quickly, so it shouldn't be much of a problem. *Cashout minimum is $10.*
***
**Fiverr** *INTERNATIONAL*

http://fiverr.com


This isn't strictly a writing site. You can do **anything** you want that you think people will pay $5 for and post it on the website. I do use it for writing, however, and have made money off of it.  
It tends to be very easy to contact the client on this site and generally the instructions are very clear.  
*No cashout minimum.*
***
**TextBroker**

http://textbroker.com  (US)  
http://texbroker.co.uk (Selectively International)


I haven't done very much on this site as I normally do quick jobs. This site uses qualifications by testing you to send you jobs suited to you. I Can't provide much of a review, but it's worth a look if you really want to write and don't mind some testing before you can start. Maybe someone can provide a review in the comments.

EDIT: *Work on here will get you anywhere from 0.7c per word for 2-star work to 5c per word for 5-stars.

1364267243.0,30,self.beermoney,1b0pjj,"Gympact - get paid to work out at the gym, at home, or even just going out for a walk/run/bike ride (proof of payment included)",46,16,29,http://www.reddit.com/r/beermoney/comments/1b0pjj/gympact_get_paid_to_work_out_at_the_gym_at_home/,"Most of you have probably heard of Gym-Pact before, but I know some are wary since it requires you to give your credit card details, so I thought I'd share my experience with it so far in the two or so months I've been using it.


**The Basic Concept**

Gympact is an app for iOS (yes, this works on iPad as well, so if you have one you can leave it in your gym locker with your phone and get paid twice over) and Android that asks you to make a 'pact' about how many days in the week you will pledge yourself to work out, and then rewards you at the end of the week if you have met your pact and worked out as many days as you said you would.

A work out that counts must be at least 30 minutes, and it can be:
* a work out at your local gym (GPS verified, which is helpful if you work or live near a gym, cough cough)
*  going running/walking/cycling/skating outside (download the sister app RunKeeper, which you can then sync with Gympact, and it will GPS verify your run)
*  working out at home (for this you have to strap your phone to you and meet a certain threshold of exertion for 30 minutes for it to count)

Where does the money come from to pay you?

Here's the catch: you know how you gave your credit card or Paypal details at the beginning? You also pledge an amount you agree to pay every day that you miss out of your pact. The minimum pledge is $5, maximum is $100.

The money you are paid for completing your pact comes from a pool of failed pacts. Thus it varies from week to week depending on how many people kept their pact. For me (iOS) it is usually $0.30 per day in my pact. The money you earn doesn't show up after each completed workout, but rather in the middle of the next week when they've had a chance to calculate it and distribute the funds from the pool.

It's not a lot of money, but really, the app is more about motivation to exercise than getting rich, and if you already work out, you might as well get paid a few bucks for it.


**How do you get paid?**

You will get paid through Paypal, within a few days (they're usually very prompt).

Minimum cashout is $10, but this is not at all hard to reach, especially if you use someone's referral code, or refer people yourself. You get $5 for your first workout if you enter in someone's referral code when signing up, and your referree also gets $5.

So far I've cashed out 3 times, and have been paid promptly each time.

Proof of payment: http://i170.photobucket.com/albums/u251/niyer09/Gympactproofofpayment_zpscb0fc90e.jpg


**What kind of payment info do you have to give when signing up?**

You have 3 options:
1) Your credit card number,
2) Your Paypal email (and you have to give them permission to deduct from your Paypal balance or an account attached to your Paypal if the balance isn't sufficient) --&gt; this is what I use on my iPhone,
3) OR the sneaky option of a Visa gift card number --&gt; this works, I have done it for the iPad


**Changing your pact/taking a break/stopping completely**

You can change the number of days in your pact, and the amount you pledge to pay for each day of your pact missed at any time, but the changes only come into effect after the next week has started.

The week goes starts from Monday morning, and ends Sunday midnight. You can only have 1 work out per day that counts towards your pact, so you can't just do 2 workouts on Sunday to catch up.

If you want to take a break, there is a vacation mode, where you can enter the dates you want to disable your pact for.

There is also the option to delete your account completely.


**What do you do if you're sick?**

Gympact accepts copies of doctor's certificates, or letters/emails from your employer confirming that you were in fact sick and could not make your pact.


**Your credit card was charged when it shouldn't have been!**

I think this was more a problem with the older, more buggy versions of the app where vacation mode wasn't working, but from what I've heard from others in this situation, customer service was really good about it, and very quickly refunded the charges made.

My experience with customer service has been great - they're really prompt in replying (usually on the same day), and they're very helpful.


**The Referral System**

As you're signing up, you will be asked if you want to put in a referral code. You obviously don't have to, but you will get $5 after completing your first work out if you do, so that's already halfway to cashout!

Each person who signs up gets their own referral code at this link: http://gym-pact.com/friends

So you can then go on to refer other people, and for each person you refer who completes their first work out, you also get $5, so it's really great.

So... if this has helped, and you'd like to sign up, I'd love for you to use my referral code: EFANisha

I will be going to grad school full time and working part time - but unfortunately, the job I landed is only going to be about 10-12 hours a week (job market is really bad out here. It took me three months to get this job). However, I will only likely be making $70 or so a week. I was really hoping to be making somewhere in the ballpark of $150 a week.

So I am wondering if going this beermoney avenue is doable. I already use mTurk and, while I haven't used it in about a month, I was able to casually earn 2-3 dollars a day off it.

I am wondering if this r/beermoney avenue can realistically get me to pull in an extra $200 a month ($50 a week) without putting in more than 10 hours a week into it.

Is this doable?

1344342469.0,27,self.beermoney,xtj52,You guys heard of Zurker?  Check this out.,42,15,166,http://www.reddit.com/r/beermoney/comments/xtj52/you_guys_heard_of_zurker_check_this_out/,"Zurker is a new social media platform created by a couple of people formerly involved with Facebook, who are still bitter about how things turned out between them and Zuckerberg and his efforts of harvesting data from their users.

Zurker is a different concept in social marketing.  With Zurker, the users are the owners.

Membership is currently through invitation only, but the kicker is that with each referral that you bring in you are given a vShare.  One vShare is equivalent to ownership of 1/1,000,000 of Zurker.  When 1,000,000 vShares have been allocated, Zurker will be restructured as a public corporation and vShares will become real shares.

If Zurker were to continue to grow and attain a valuation of $50 billion like Facebook, each vShare would be worth $50,000.  Of course, it's unwise to assume that Zurker will attain that same level of valuation.

Bebo was sold to AOL for $800 million.  At that level of valuation, each vShare would be worth 800.  Myspace was sold for 580 million - which would translate to $580 per vShare.

If Zurker were never to sell out - and a user base of owner-investors would probably oppose selling out to a large corporation - the values of vShares would be determined by the earnings of the company with dividends paying quarterly.  If Zurker earns a net profit of $100 million, then each vShare would entitle the owner to $100.  

Now, honestly, it may not go anywhere, but it doesn't cost anything to sign up.  On the other hand, it could possibly earn us thousands for not doing anything.

To sign up heres my referral link - it's invite only right now.

[Our startup](http://cafrino.com) is launching this month, and I wanted to give r/beermoney a heads-up about it in case it interests you.


We are a legal online poker site for US players only, where players win cash prizes for placing high in tournaments. You can win anywhere from a penny to thousands of dollars based on how well you play. We are even hoping to give away the largest prize in online poker history (over $2.5M), but most players can probably just expect to win some extra spending money.  Here is a youtube video of how it works: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u75lnh7oqTU


We are offering tournaments with just 2 players (heads-up), 9 players (single-table), and multi-table tournaments which will have many players. Tournaments are sponsored, and cash prizes come from these sponsorships. We do not take deposits from players (due to illegality of taking deposits), so you have nothing to risk/lose. 


I would be happy to answer any questions you have, and if you like to play in our launch tournament (which will have an increased prize pool), feel free to register your email to make sure you don't miss it. 


Thanks, and may the odds always be in your favor!

I am not a Coke drinker but I know some of you might be. I've been able to snag about 200 points worth of codes in the past month from friends and family especially during BBQs and family gatherings where a lot of Coke gets mixed with Crown Royal :) There are codes under every cap and inside 12 packs of Coke brand products. See a complete list [here](http://www.mycokerewards.com/participatingBrands.do).

I'm sure there are some of you who drink Coca-Cola or are around Coke enough to be able to snag some codes. I think there's a limit on how many MCR points you can redeem per week. You can redeem for GCs and other merchandise. I've even heard of people selling their MCR points via online auctions (not eBay, though). 

There are several promos going on now where you can redeem 2 codes + a promo code and get extra codes per week. Here's a one of them happening for the Olympics.

For the one below, it must be done on the same online session. I found this over a SlickDeals forum:

1. Enter 2 codes found on bottle caps = 6 points (two 12 packs can be used too)
2. Enter code London2012 to give you a Bonus Entry (a 3-pt value)
3. Enter the sweepstakes CHOOSE ONLY THE FREE ENTRY OPTION. DON'T SPEND MCR POINTS.
4. Scratch the sweepstakes as instructed (BTW I got a ""Sorry"".. so no instant prize for me)
5. Go back to main account and you'll see additional 10 points.

You can also use Coke2012, TeamUSA, and GoForGold as promo codes if London2012 doesn't work.

If anyone happens to have just 1 extra MCR points that they're not using, I'd be happy to take it off your hands so I can redeem for the promo code :)",,False,,t5_2s5or,False,,,True,t3_x5i4n,http://www.reddit.com/r/beermoney/comments/x5i4n/does_anybody_use_mycokerewards_there_are_codes_on/,

I've submitted 4 articles so far within a week and sold 3, making a nice bit of cash. They take 30% of the sale, but that still leaves you with a good amount in your account.

They are pretty tough on grammar, spelling and punctuation (especially commas), but if your article is rejected, they'll point out where the problem lies (i.e. where you should have added a comma at this location), and you can resubmit.

Keep in mind I don't like to talk a lot and keep things very brief; if you have questions ask away.

**Actives**

*Amazon's Mturk*

-This one by far is the highest paying out of all of the other ones. Tasks or HITs can be as short as 1 minute or less or they can be as long as 30 minutes. IT is a MUST to subscribe to [hitsworthturkingfor](http://www.reddit.com/r/HITsWorthTurkingFor/) and [mturk](http://www.reddit.com/r/mturk). Typically I only use the HITs that are on the subreddit as I usually find garbage ones that pay so little. You can make about $6-8 hourly on average. You can cash out to your bank at $10 USD or $1USD for gift cards. Sign up here [AmazonMturk](https://www.mturk.com/mturk/welcome)

*Swagbucks*

 -Typical complete offers/surveys/watch videos website. I mainly do the daily poll, the toolbar, and NOSO. I also compliment this with the Swagbucks mobile TV app. I try not to make anything over 60 points a day otherwise they start to watch you. I can usually make $15 a month easily. I wouldn't advise making anything over $20 in Amazon gift cards as they have been ban happy for legitimate users. The best payout available is the $5 Amazon gift cards. You can earn a maximum of $25 a month. I wouldn't recommend it though.[Ref](http://www.swagbucks.com/refer/JcEloxTech) and [Non-Ref](http://swagbucks.com)

*Hits4pay*

 -One of my favorites. They email you that they have ads to ""view"" and you click on them and do whatever you want in other tabs, until you're credited, then on to the next.[Ref](http://hits4pay.com/members/index.cgi?LetsMugSanta) and [Non-Ref](http://hits4pay.com) Only one account per household and cash out is at $25 to Paypal.

*DealsnCash*

-Same thing as hits4pay and by same company, just less money per click.[Ref](http://dealsncash.com/members/index.cgi?LetsMugSanta) and [Non-Ref](http://dealsncash.com) Same cash out info for Hits4pay.

*Paidviewpoint*

-Very easy survey site. They send you 10-question surveys every day for usually 10 cents each. Every now and then you can get bonus surveys which will give you about $2 for an extra 10 questions or so. [Ref](http://paidviewpoint.com/?r=d3kytv) and [Non-Ref](http://paidviewpoint.com) Cash out is $10 to paypal.

*Varolo*

-Watch ads and then rate them. They're usually 30 seconds long and every 5-7 ads pays out 1 cent. Not a very quick earner, but you make more on referals than ads as long as they are active.[Ref](http://www.varolo.com/village/JoshuaC56739) and [Non-Ref](http://www.varolo.com)

*Cashcrate*

-This one is sort of like swagbucks. More offers, surveys and videos. You do however get 3 cents for checking each day. I usually just watch the videos. [Ref](http://www.cashcrate.com/3801646) and [Non-Ref](http://www.cashcrate.com)

**Note**
-When signing up for offers use this site, so your email doesn't get loaded with spam [10MinuteEmail](http://10minutemail.com/10MinuteMail/index.html)

**Mobile**

You usually can cash out for these immediately depending on what type of reward you want. They all offer a decent selection.


*AppTrailers*

-Exactly as it says. Get paid to watch trailers of apps while on the go.

*Appredeem*

-Same company as above and share a points balance. Download and rate apps.

*Viggle*

-Watch TV and get paid for it by checking in. 1 point per minute of watching.

**Passives**

*Vagex*

-Set up a Youtube player on desktop and on your browser. You get points for every view, like, comment, etc. Slow earning but requires no effort once set up. [Ref](http://vagex.com/?ref=132305) and [Non-Ref](http://vagex.com) Minimum of $10 USD to cash out for Paypal.

*Topline*

-Install a browser add-on which replaces ads that you see with it's own ads.[Ref](https://www.jointopline.com/register?fid=2PNS7JLMSCLV) and [Non-Ref](https://www.jointopline.com) Minimum cash out is 10 USD Paypal.

*Bing Rewards*

-Search and get rewarded for it. You can have up to 5 different accounts that are referred together in the same household. You can also use these on different browsers but on the same PC. [Ref](http://www.bing.com/explore/rewards?PUBL=REFERAFRIEND&amp;CREA=RAW&amp;rrid=23B98AFA-1907-4B9A-84DE-A2B053B9B065) and [Non-Ref](http://www.bing.com/rewards). Minimum reward cash out is around 5 USD. Rewards can be used for gift card, xbox points, etc.

*GomezPeer*

-This one performs simulations/calculations using your excess system resources. Slow earner but once set up it requires no effort. Takes a little while to get your account validated though. [Ref](http://www.gomezpeerzone.com/application-apply/?Referrer=LetsMugSanta) and [Non-Ref](http://www.gomezpeerzone.com) Cash out is $5 USD to Paypal. Takes around two weeks to get account validated.

*I-Gagnant*

-This one is just a small window that displays ads while you work. Really negligble/not noticeable. Points add up pretty quick and can be transferred out through Paypal [Ref](http://www.i-gagnant-barre.com/?u=LetsMugSanta&amp;lang=en) and [Non-ref](http://www.i-gagnant-barre.com) Balance must be over 15 euros to cash out.

There is also the *MetaTrader strategy tester* and *bitcoin mining*. I've already earned maybe close to $10 from these two alone. **Only** use these if you don't have to pay for your power. This will consume a lot of power.Use this site when setting them up. I do not take credit for the site.
 
[RobotPennies](http://robotpennies.blogspot.com/)

Keep in mind that the money is slow, but I've literally done nothing but keep my computer on when I'm not using it or am using it and make small amounts of money that add up pretty quickly altogether.

**Note**
Mturk is the top earner by far. I can usually net around $100 a month from it by spending maybe 2-3 hours a day. The other active ones just compliment the additional beermoney pay. The mobile ones I usually use for when I'm not at my PC or already am and just looking to make some extra $ while my phone is charging. You could also use [Bluestacks](http://bluestacks.com/) to simulate an android phone, but it didn't really work well for me. Some people like it. The passives are an easy way to make another $15-$30 per month.

Well, I hope this was helpful, as I didn't have much to go by when I started. Good luck!

I've been using this app called AppRedeem for about 6 weeks now and so far managed to make $20. Not much I know, but it's free! 


Basically, this app pays you to download apps from the App Store or Android Market. Once you've downloaded the app they're promoting, you're credited with points. Depending on whether the app is free or paid, the points you get can range from 15 to over 1000. Each point is worth a cent, so 15 would be $0.15 and 1000 would be $10. 

The points you collected can then be redeemed for gift codes (iTunes, Macys, Amazon etc.) or transferred into your paypal account. So far I've redeemed my points for two $10 iTunes gift cards. 

For iOS users (iPhone,iPod,iPad), you install AppRedeem through Safari by going to m.appredeem.com and then saving the page to your homescreen. Then just register an account and start downloading. 

Android users can find the app in the Android Market. 

Here are some screens of my transactions:

* http://i.imgur.com/tUPMb.jpg
* http://i.imgur.com/rP1Py.jpg

There's no set time to when the apps refresh so I just check it once a day. If you have any questions, feel free to ask. English is not my first language so I'm sorry if my words weren't clear enough.

If you found this helpful, you can enter my bonus code 'providence' in the app. We will both get 25 points.

(USA)",44,19,15,http://www.reddit.com/r/beermoney/comments/1jsb4s/i_cant_do_listia_anymore_but_you_can_usa/,"Don't know why I never thought of posting this as beermoney.  I guess because now that I moved out of the US it is nearly impossible to do (shipping costs).  
  
Listia is an auction site. [ref](https://www.listia.com/signup/896763) / [non](http://www.listia.com)  No, it is not penny auctions and no there are no weird catches.  It is legit and the items are posted by other users, just like eBay or something.  
  
The difference is that the auctions use points instead of cash.  And you get 1000 just for signing up.  And you can EARN these points by doing surveys and all that junk just like Swagbucks or other sites.  However, those features were added after I left the site so I don't know what the time/payout ratio is.  
  
I never put any money into the system, and I never did surveys or watched ads or referred anyone while actually active.  I leveraged my useless junk into more points until I eventually got an Amazon Kindle.  I still have enough points for another big purchase, but I am saving for when I return to the USA since it is hard to work the system from abroad.  
  
On working the system, there are two methods.  1 is to sell an intangible good.  You can see lots of people trying this and it rarely works.  However, there is no listing fee so it doesn't hurt to try.  
  
Second method (I used this one) clean out your room and organize the things you don't want into categories.  Don't include anything heavy, for goodness sake.  If you include something heavy you'll have to pay more to ship it and likely come out behind.  I sold off all of my middle school Hot Topic swag as a set, all my ""beach"" jewelry (literally worthless junk) as a set, etc etc.  Keychains, weird things you made, whatever.  It will sell.  Your room will be cleaner.  You'll pay minimal shipping.  
  
What makes this different from eBay?  People have 1,000 free points.  People make multiple accounts and end up with several thousand free points.  People get points from stuff they didn't want anyway, and are more willing to spend it on things that are totally worthless.  It's not real money, so users toss it around randomly and ""pay"" for things they'd never sink real cash on.  
  
&gt;My Advice: build up a rep before selling any ""big ticket"" sets or items.  People are really into reputation there, since non-delivery can be a serious issue.  It's not connected to PayPal like eBay, so scammers literally only risk their listia account if they charge $10 for shipping and never ship anything.  List at least your first few auctions with zero shipping fees, and beg the buyer for feedback.  Include a nice note in the package imploring them to leave feedback.   
  
Before someone comments about it: yes, obviously if you pay shipping through Paypal you can open a dispute just like on eBay and get the money back regardless of what Listia's mods do or don't do to help.  The users on Listia mostly seem not to understand this however.  This is also to your advantage because you will have little competition for ""risky"" items by first-time sellers.  This is actually how I got my Kindle.  First item posted by a new user, so no one was bidding as it was too ""big ticket"" to risk losing .... whatever people think you're going to lose.  
  
&gt;2ndary Advice: because of the non-delivery issue and the fact that shipping fees are the only real cash exchanged, things with over $5 in shipping fees will never sell, period.  Asking for shipping is a deathwish for your auction.  Suck it up and eat the $2.50 cost for your points.  I never charged shipping and I think I paid about $10 over the course of using the account.  And got a Kindle for that.  And the Kindle already had books on it.  Shabam.

**EDIT: Removed MegaTypers.**


**Postloop:** [ref](http://www.postloop.com/invite/Tyelander)/[non-ref](http://www.postloop.com/)

You sign up, make a couple posts on the ""test forum"" and then you get a rating on how well you are when it comes to posting on the forums. For this site, make sure you type properly so you can get a good rating. The better the rating, the more forums you can post on. To get points, you sign up on other forums and make posts there, you gain points for each post you make on the forum. There are a limit to the amount of times you can post on a forum a day(5-10 posts). You need 100 points to withdraw which is $5. You can get roughly 1.7 points per post, so it isn't that hard to reach 100 points.

**PaidViewpoint:**[ref](http://paidviewpoint.com/?r=Tyelander)/[non-ref](http://paidviewpoint.com/)

Daily Survey. You gain a ""TraitScore"" every time you do a survey. This is a very passive way to earn money because there is only 1 survey a day till you reach a TraitScore of 9000. You get $0.03 cents per survey that takes a minute to do(10 questions). The questions are practically the same everyday. 

**SliceThePie:** [ref](http://www.slicethepie.com/?wyd=557385)/[non-ref](http://www.slicethepie.com/)

This is very straight forward. All you do is listen to a song for 90 seconds, then you write a review and give it a score out of 10. Make sure you use say EVERYTHING you possible can because you get more money depending on the length of the review. Also, make sure you use different words when you can, you cannot say the same thing over and over again. Withdraw is $10.

**Webanswers:**[ref](http://www.webanswers.com/_tyelander/)/[non-ref](http://www.webanswers.com/)

Ask and answer questions, you earn money through Google AdSense. You need to answer 50 questions before you can begin earning money from posting. You post an answer, if yours is chosen as the best answer you will gain ad revenue for that post. So basically your goal is to have users select your answer as the ""Best Answer"".

**CashnHits:**[ref](http://www.cashnhits.com/index.php?ref=tyelander)/[non-ref](http://www.cashnhits.com/)

Do surveys, click on YouTube videos, paid to like and even AutoSurf. I usually start with turning AutoSurf on. How it works is: You start it up, a popup appears and you just minimize it, every 40 seconds it will refresh and you will will earn money that way.

1360520373.0,24,self.beermoney,1898j8,"Introduction to InboxDollars (incl my pretty check from them for $70), and some stratagems for moneymaking through ID",44,20,11,http://www.reddit.com/r/beermoney/comments/1898j8/introduction_to_inboxdollars_incl_my_pretty_check/,"I posted a [photo of my check](http://www.reddit.com/r/beermoney/comments/1830l6/two_months_worth_of_emails_and_offers_feels_good/) for $70 from InboxDollars a few days ago, and I got a few PMs with questions about the site, so I figured it would be easiest to just write up a brief description and introduction.  I'll include links at the end. 

InboxDollars has five main revenue streams for you to take advantage of: 1) Paid Emails, 2) Paid surveys, 3) Offers rewards, 4) Online games and videos, 5) Coupons.  There are also bonuses.  You can access them either through your email or through the website itself.  The website also offers activities, like MTurk HITs, but as that's not a unique feature, I'll not discuss it here.  There are also two ""gotchas"" that I'll explain at the end.  I'll look at each of these streams in more detail first, though. 

**Paid Emails**

Paid Emails are emails that they send you.  The emails contain a link, and if you click that link, you earn $0.02.  The exact number varies from day to day, but it's usually between 3 and 12 (my personal low and high).  The content of the link is usually an offer from an affiliate, but it can also be from ID themselves.  The emails contain a link at the top of the page to take you to the ID website, and they contain a link at the bottom of the page to take you directly to the offer.  Clicking the link at the top to the ID website allows you to literally watch your current total go up because it takes you to the online dashboard, displaying your current totals as well as currently available surveys and emails.  Clicking the link directly from the email also pays out.  The thing about the email offers is that you can literally close the new tab as soon as it opens to the final page (and finishes its link referral process), and still get paid.  You are not forced to actually look at the page that opens.  Lastly, you can do them realtime as they come into your inbox, or you can wait until the end of the day at do them all at the same time.  For these, there is no benefit to either strategy.  FWIW, I tend to click the link on the top of the email to take me to the website so I can make sure I've not missed any emails. 

**Paid Surveys**

Every day, you are given a minimum of three surveys you can take, available on the website from your dashboard.  They are each worth $0.50 and take on average 20 minutes.  At least, that's the time they allot for the surveys.  Generally, these three take me between 8 and 25 minutes to complete all three, occasionally longer if it's a particularly involved survey or contains videos.  In addition, you will get more survey opportunities in your inbox as they come available.  These survey opportunities show up in your inbox like the paid emails, but they are best done as soon to realtime as you can.  These additional surveys are limited time offers, and their values vary greatly.  I have never seen a survey worth less than $0.50, but I have seen quite a lot worth more than a dollar, a fair few worth more than $3, and one that was worth $5.75.  The length of these surveys also varies greatly, but they range anywhere from 5 minutes to 35 minutes to complete.  The surveys all have qualifying questions, and sometimes you just don't qualify.  Other times, the survey will have hit its limit before you get to it (often happens with the high-paying surveys), but if the survey is not available when you click it, you will be presented with another survey (though the payout for that survey is not necessarily the same-sometimes it's higher!).  Surveys are a great way to pass a bit of time if you're bored, but the ones that are worth more get gobbled up pretty quickly, so keep your eyes open for those and jump on the chance.  In addition, for every survey you complete, you are given a chance to ""Spin &amp; Win"".  This is a big wheel you spin that has lots of prizes on it.  The prizes range from one or five entries in the monthly sweepstakes, to five cents to five dollars.  I have only ever gotten five sweepstakes entries or five cents, so I'm a little leery of this thing, but it's there nevertheless.  

**Offers rewards**

Like other sites, InboxDollars has a lot of offers, everything from signing up for Netflix (worth $5) to purchasing the Pimsleur method of language learning (worth $20) to joining a wine of the month club (worth $20).  You can even sign up for a Discover card (worth $15).  The offers are for a wide array of products and services and all pay out different amounts.  Some of the offers are for trials, some are for purchases, some are for clubs, some are for simple actions.  Read the details of each offer closely.  Some of the trial offers require you to stay beyond the free trial in order to pay out, though most don't.  Some of the offers require you to lay out money first (like iBid2Save offer, which pays you $10 but requires you to purchase $5 of bids first).  The offers are a great way to do things you normally would do anyway, but make a little scratch off doing it.  For example, with Valentine's Day coming up, you can order flowers from ProPlants or ProFlowers and make $5; since it is something you would have done *anyway*, doing it through ID just saves you money, in a roundabout way.  

**Online Games and Videos**

Similar to the surveys, there are a few videos available periodically.  They range in value, but essentially, you watch a video, answer a few questions and make a few cents ($0.02 - $1.50, personal low and high).  There are also games, though I don't really understand how the games pay out.  I know you can make money playing them, but this is one arena that I haven't yet gotten my feet wet in. 

**Coupons**

The coupons are one of those double-whammy ones.  They are manufacturers coupons for every-day purchases (e.g., Save $1 on Velveeta, Save $0.40 on Pilsbury, Save $1 on Planters peanuts) that are valid at any store.  In addition to the savings they provide you for the item you're purchasing, you also earn $0.10 for *every coupon* you print out and use.  That's right, if you do your regular grocery shopping and use five coupons, you've just made $0.50 *in addition to* the face value of the coupons!  These are fantastic.  All you need is a printer (mine is black and white) and some paper.  Then you select the coupons you want to redeem, print them out, and take them with you to the store.  I usually cut them out so the cashier has an easier time of it.  It takes a few days for them to show up in your account, but it's pretty neat when they do; the feeling that you got double what it was worth is pretty nice.  

**Gotchas**

There are two biggies, but they're not problematic.  The first is that they charge you to print and mail you a check.  And it's a lot, something like $3.  This is how they deter you from cashing out too frequently.  As you can see, though, it's not difficult to make that $3.  The second thing is that your check will take a loooong time to process, something like six weeks, and you must be an active member until it is processed.  If you stop participating before they ship your check, they simply won't ship it.  (At least, that's what their disclaimers said when I was cashing out.)  However, you get some bonuses when you cash out your first check, something like $3, so it makes having to pay for cutting a check a bit easier.  You also get bonuses for completing your profile (e.g. demographic stuff, address, etc).  Then of course there are referral bonuses and bonuses for posting on Facebook, etc.  Lots of bonuses.  

**Summary**

There you have it, folks.  InboxDollars in a nutshell.  It's quite easy to quickly rack up the money here, especially if you visit every day.  The two easiest ways to make money here are the emails (which are low-paying) and the surveys (which can be high-paying though time consuming).  The next best is the coupons.  Some of the activities are also pretty high-paying, but it's really hit or miss with those.  In any case, I hope I've answered a lot of questions and made some of you interested, but if you have any questions about anything, feel free to ask.

**Edit**I forgot to mention searches.  You get $0.01 for every two qualified searches, up to a maximum of $0.15/day; there is also a $0.05 bonus if you search 4 days in a week.

I searched and didn't see anything about these so I apologize if this is a repost.

How it works is you call a company that deals with life insurance, auto insurance, etc. You ask them natural, not forced, questions and stay on the call for a certain amount of time and you get paid very well. A 5 minute call can earn you $3 or more usually. You do not have to sign up for any trial, or submit any payment information so far as I know.

Some important tips when completing these calls:

 - Act natural. Don't try and drag things out. Ask questions that show real interest in the service

 - Provide real information, or you may not receive credit

 - You must agree to the call being tracked/recorded

This is a huge and easy moneymaker,as you can do most of these calls once every 30 days. 

There are also many more opportunities to earn money on here. 

 - Daily surveys which can earn you $5 or more per day

 - Tons of cash offers, which you can sort by popularity to see what is easy to complete

 - Cash searches, similar to swagbucks

 - Daily slots for a chance to win a prize

Well I've got my sites down to a routine that gets me the most easy points in the least amount of time. I thought I'd put together a walkthrough of my routine in case it would be of any use to any of you. It requires a bit of set up, but makes things much easier once it's set up. None of the links in the guide are referral links, but I put a list of referral links for the sites I use at the bottom if anyone cares to use them.

**The Set Up**

First, I created a separate gmail account to sign up for my rewards sites with, so my regular account doesn't get too spammy. (Protip for sites that give you points for signing up for newsletters. Some of them will take their points back if you unsubscribe. Instead, create a filter in gmail that auto-deletes them).

Next, I use two browsers. My preferred browser for regular browsing (Chrome), and a browser I use for referral sites (Firefox). I do this for two reasons. One, I can leave my rewards gmail account signed in on Firefox and my regular email signed in on Chrome, so I don't have to switch accounts. Two, so I can install the MyPoints and Swagbucks toolbars for points without jacking up my regular browser (I loathe toolbars.

In my rewards browser, I have some bookmarks set up as follows (links typed out instead of hyperlinked for easier copying/pasting):

A Swagbucks folder containing the following bookmarks:

* TV: http://video.swagbucks.com
* Inbox: http://www.swagbucks.com/g/inbox
* Daily Poll: http://swagbucks.com/p/polls
* NOSO: http://swagbucks.com/g/noso

A PTC folder containing the following bookmarks:

* NatureBucks: http://naturebucks.com/members/clickPTC.php
* NatureDollars: http://naturedollars.com/members/clickPTC.php
* NatureClix: http://natureclix.com/members/clickPTC.php

An ""Other Daily"" folder containing the following bookmarks:

* MyPoints Easy Points: http://www.mypoints.com/emp/u/easy-points.vm
* SocialSci Studies: https://www.socialsci.com/participations/all
* Crowdini: http://crowdini.com

A Payout folder containing links to the rewards/cash out/etc site of each of my rewards sites

**The Routine**

* Open my rewards browser, and get 1 Swagbuck for having the toolbar installed (you can get this once a day).
* Check rewards email (pinned as app tab) for surveys and PTC emails.
* Right-click the Swagbucks bookmark folder and open all in tabs.
* Start a video in Swagbucks TV (1st tab) and leave it running while I do the rest of the routine. I start a new one as each one finishes. You get a few Swagbucks for every ... 5 videos I think? Just make sure to keep the tab open.
* Check Swagbucks Inbox (2nd tab) for any offers worth doing, then close the tab.
* Do the daily poll (1 swagbuck with the occasional bonus video for 2 more swagbucks) and NOSO (2 or 3 swagbucks once I've clicked through all the offers), then close their tabs.
* Right-click the PTC bookmark folder and open all in tabs.
* Do all the PTC offers on each page, then close their tabs.
* Right-click the Other Daily bookmark folder and open all in tabs.
* Check MyPoints Easy Points for offers worth doing. Also look for polls in the lower-right for 5 points each. Sometimes they're there, sometimes not. Close the tab when done.
* Do any available SocialSci suveys, then close the tab when done.
* Answer the daily Crowdini question, then close the tab when done.

Voila! That's it! Depending on how close I am to the next reward in Swagbucks TV (there's a gauge in the upper-right), I may keep the browser open long enough to play another video or two. If I'm bored and have nothing better to do, I'll go to the Swagbucks and/or MyPoints offer section and hunt for offers worth doing. I only ever use my rewards browser when I'm doing rewards. I did install the Topline extension in my regular browser, since it'll generate more points that way.

**Referral Links**

I really like this program.  There are no strange delays in crediting you, nor missed credits.

They pay 250 points an app and you have to use it for 30 seconds to get credit.  Crediting happens immediately.  250 points equates to $0.25. 

You can redeem points for Amazon or iTunes codes, minimum Amazon code is 2000 credits/$2.00.

If you sat with the program for a while you could easily make 2000 points in a half hour (at least initially) and I notice a new app at least twice a day.

Here's a site that I've used in the past. [PostLoop](http://www.postloop.com/invite/zack) is a site where forum and blog owners post their websites and pay PostLoop a small fee to get points, which they spend on their sites. Then you, the /r/beermoney user, post quality content on their site. In exchange, you get points in your account. Every point is worth $.05. Every blog post and comment (on average) earns 1.56 points. If you have quality posting trends, you'll even get bonus points in your account. I have a 4.31/5.00 rating, so I get .35 extra points per post. This equates to $.0955 per post or blog comment I make. That's around 50/posts per day for $5.

This isn't a site where you do nothing and get paid. You HAVE to make decent posts. An example of a ""decent post"" is something like this:

&gt; Yeah, I saw that on reddit the other day. It looks like a pretty sweet program, you can earn traffic for your blog or even straight cash if that's your sort of thing. Plus that good-looking fellow, flotwig, is promoting it. I should totally click his referral link, it's won't hurt me and is pretty good payment for him showing me this fantastic site!

This is a BAD post:

&gt; yeah postloops' cool

It's not too hard. There are sites for all interest areas - computers, cars, construction, health, etc. [Here's a listing of the currently available forums.](http://www.postloop.com/sites/forums/all)

Up until recently, I had never used PostLoop for cash, but I know you can. Oodles of payment proofs are a mere Google away. I actually used them in exchange for posts on my forum - I made 534 posts and got 535 posts in return. Pretty swanky. If I wanted to exchange that for cash, it would equate to a cool $34.15 for a week's work. [My proof thread.](http://www.postloop.com/support/index.php?threads/over-400-posts-received-so-far.1154/) Once I started Postlooping for the money, I made about $5 five or six times a week with 0 referrals.

They usually take around 30 seconds to 2 minutes, and pay anywhere from $0.05 to $1.00. The things I like most about Naturebucks are bolded below.

**Minimum payout of 0.05** to Paypal, or 1.00 for Amazon gift cards

**Prompt payment** – Every time I requested a payout, I received it within 20 minutes.

**Bonus** – If you manage to get to $20.00 (this includes what you get from referrals), Naturebucks gives you an extra $1.00. It may not seem like much but it’s free money, and easy to get. You don’t have to have 20.00 waiting for you to cash out all at once, you can cash out as you go and once you hit 20.00 for your account’s lifetime you get the bonus.

**Five tiers of referrals** – Naturebucks gives you 20% of what your referrals make, and it goes down five tiers, each tier earning you a flat 20% rate. So a referral of a referral of a referral of a referral of your referral earns you 20% of what they do.

This referral system is perfect for the huge referral trains that Beermoney is so fond of. So let’s make a train and get everybody five paying referrals, that way we can all help each other make some extra cash. [Here is my referral]( http://naturebucks.com/members/register.php?ref=fire741cracker)

I'm leaving out SwagBucks just 'cause it seems to get way more discussion than some of the ones I discuss below. Here, I will recommend three ways of bringing in a little extra money, in order of effort required:

**Topline**

The least work intensive is TopLine. This is simply a browser plug in that you install and it runs in the background, earning you money, while you go about your normal surfing. The payout is TINY. I've been on it a couple of weeks and just about made $1. But there is literally no work involved once you've installed it.

[Referral link](https://www.jointopline.com/register?fid=JJC3PCR35Q7V)

[Non-referral link](http://www.jointopline.com)

**SuperPoints**

The moderately work intensive option that I prefer is Superpoints. The main things here are to click the Superlucky Button every day and, if you're up for it, watch some videos. Overarching all of this, though, is the fact that you will need to refer people to the site in order to really start making money. I've made about $15 in a bit over a month, and that is with what I consider only a little bit of recruiting effort.

**mTurk**

The most work intensive is mTurk. Here, you get paid for what work you do and there is NO passive income (unlike the other options). On the other hand, it can be pretty lucrative, if you're willing to put a bit more time in. I've made about $45 in a month or so.

I struggled early on.  I received very little adsense income and not many page views.  I struggled overall but had heard of people making very good income on there.  Web Answers, like most writing sites is a pain to begin.  It doesn't make you much money upfront and doesn't reward you early.  It is however one of my best earning sites over time.  I have around 450 questions answered and a few best answers awarded.  I now make about $10 a week for very minimal work.  But it takes some time to get there.  Here are some tips that got me going.

**First, what type of questions do you want to answer?**
You want to stick with the questions that get the most views.  These are going to be the following:


Legal

Health

Business

Computers

Finance


All get a large amount of views and have a high volume of questions.  I suggest playing expert in 2 of these fields.  That way you can stick to your specialties.

**How many answers do I need to make?**

Initially you need to respond 50 times to begin earning any income.  This is a lot of questions to answer and can burn you out quickly.  My strategy is to answer 5 questions a day.  2-3 receive very involved 1-2 paragraph answers and 2-3 receive short quick answers.  This way I answer a few questions each day without trying to write for 5 hours.

**How do I write quality posts?**

Grammar/Spelling/Punctuation

Length


These are the most important parts of your answer.  Make sure your responses have proper grammar and are long enough to answer the question.  You don't need to write an essay each time but writing a few paragraphs for 2-3 questions a day will help improve your quality score.

**Which Questions do I answer?**


My general strategy here is to pick a category.  Sort by ""Most Recent Questions"" and only show **Open** questions.  I then go down the list and look for questions with **few answers** and **high views**.


I shoot for **25+ views** and **3 or fewer answers**.


This gives me the best shot at garnering lots of page views and also having a shot at being awarded an answer.


My second strategy is to sort by Number of Replies (Low to High, Newest Questions)  I again look for high amount of page views.  Here I am looking for pageviews of **100+**.    This way I am answering questions that receive a high amount of page views and I am the only responder, So I am gaining a large amount from them.


With this strategy I am making about $40 a month after 3 months.  I have a good solid base of questions answered and as long as I keep responding to questions, my income continues to grow.  I now spend about 10 minutes a day on web answers.  I expect to move over $50 next month and hope to hit $100 a month by the end of the year.

I would suggest you check it out or if you have already signed up for it, to come back and try it again.  It is a very good program and works tremendously with a little bit of work.

This is a bit hard to explain, but in SwagBucks, they have tons of offers from Encrave and some other vendors that might have you search in AOL or watch X amount of videos for SwagBucks. The bad part about these offers is that the timer will not continue for the offer unless your mouse is over the window. It's coded in such a way that it requires a mouse to be on the window for the timer to run. 

The problem with this is you cannot do anything else on your computer because it requires the mouse to stay on the window. I use to skip these offers for that reason, because the offers I did typically were done while gaming. I have discovered a trick that has allowed me to now complete these offers, and continue playing games or do other activities on my computer. I figured I'd share with the /r/beermoney folks!

In order to do this you only need another windows open. Then do the following:

1. Start the timer for the offer.
2.  Once the timer starts, overlap a new  browser window, so it's on top of the offer.
3. With the mouse over the non-overlapped portion of the original offer window, drag it to the new window.
4. The timer should continue, and your free to place your mouse anywhere else on your computer.

I don't know the exact criteria that they're looking for, but the recruiter told me that she ""need[s] so many different attitudes about biking in SF"", so that could be just about anyone.

If you're interested, please complete [this pre-screener survey](
https://www.surveymonkey.com/s/BikeSF) and list ""Dave A."" as a referral source. [As I have with other market research firms](http://www.reddit.com/r/beermoney/comments/1dr0l7/google_is_seeking_males_1840_with_android_phones/), I am in the process of establishing a mutually-beneficial relationship with Alphabuzz, in which they will make a donation to [my fundraising efforts with the Leukemia &amp; Lymphoma Society's Bay Area Team In Training cycling team](http://pages.teamintraining.org/sf/ambbr13/daveandrade) for each qualified applicant I refer.

Please feel free to forward this along to anyone else you know in the city who may be interested -- I just ask that the referral source still be listed as ""Dave A."" just so they get a sense of how much traffic I'm driving to them :)

Please let me know if you have any questions :)

Sign up with a current ING Client's Orange Key and instead of the regular $25 bonus, you get $50. I signed up last summer, got my $50 for signing up as soon as they received my cheque, and referred a few family members and they all received $50 as well.

To register, go to: http://www.ingdirect.ca/en/signmeup/index.html You'll probably want to sign up for a 'Thrive Chequing Account' (no fees &amp; 0.25% interest), but the savings accounts are also quite good, offering one of the best interest rates in Canada. Where it says 'Orange Key (optional):' enter my key: 39798361S1 or someone else's, if you want, to get a $50 bonus instead of $25. After that, they walk you through the process of making your initial deposit. I received my bonus in around three days. Making the account took around fifteen minutes, mailing the cheque took another 15, then I just had to wait three days for it to arrive and for them to process it. I've kept my account open and now use it for my personal banking, but there are no restrictions on your deposit or the bonus, and you can withdraw it any time you like. 

All and all, it's a fairly easy way to make $50. Not to mention that ING is a very good bank (their customer service is miles better than any other I've dealt with: CIBC, TD, and PCF.) If you have any questions, feel free to ask!


Edit: Apparently ING Direct USA is also offering a $50 promotion. Orange keys aren't internationally compatible, though, so you'd find someone else from the US with an orange key.

Sites I'm using for Treadmill money/Rebel Sport gift cards:

[Global Test Market](https://www.globaltestmarket.com/) Earn points for surveys on various topics and entries into their daily $300 and quarterly $10,000 draws. Surveys can come in daily and many have the option to do another survey after that one. This year I have earned enough points (2000) for $100US cheque. 

[LiveTribe](http://www.livetribe.com/where_my_opinion_earns_me_rewards) Earn points for surveys on various topics (if you don't qualify you do still get a few points). They've recently lowered the required points for the various types of rewards (to go into effect until December 1st). When that clicks over in December I'll have earned (40,000 points) enough for $50 through PayPal (other reward options available)

[MySurvey](http://www.mysurvey.net.au/) Earn points for surveys on various topics (if you don't qualify you do still get a few points). Have earned (10,350 points) enough for $90 through PayPal (other reward options available).

[OpinionsPaid](http://www.opinionspaid.com/op/) This is my third favourite survey site. Earn points for surveys on various topics (if you don't qualify you do still get a few points). Have earned (12,300 zoints) enough for a $100 &amp; $20 voucher from Rebel Sport (other reward options available).

[PureProfile](http://www.pureprofile.com/) Earn MONEY for surveys on various topics (if you don't qualify you do still get a few points) and for website, video and ad views. Have currently earned $65.05, which I can deposit straight into my bank.

[RewardsCentral](http://www.rewardscentral.com.au/) Earn points for surveys on various topics, quick surveys (polls), daily website views, completing offers, daily guessing game and shopping. Have currently earned 2,811 points - just need 3,300 points for a $30 cash out (other rewards available). If you join RewardsCentral I RECOMMEND also joining their sistersite: [MyOpinions](http://www.myopinions.com.au/). This site is more specifically designed for earning points for surveys and the weekly InstantWin game. However, the points you do earn can be TRANSFERRED to your RewardsCentral account total (which is what I've been doing).

[SurveyHead](https://www.surveyhead.com/) Earn MONEY for surveys on various topics. Have currently earned $21.42US and just need $6.07US more to be eligible to be able to redeem it for rewards (Rixty &amp; PayPal).

[SurveyVillage](http://www.surveyvillage.com.au/default.aspx) Earn points for surveys on various topics. Have currently earned 3,020 points - just need 4,000 points for a $20 Rebel Sport Gift card (other reward options available).

[Toluna](http://au.toluna.com/) Toluna used to be crap but they've recently re-done their website and turned themselves around. Earn points for surveys on various topics (if you don't qualify you do still get a few points) and for polls about Sponsored Content. Have currently earned enough for $60 through Paypal (3x60,000 points) and have more points pending. I do warn you though that it seems like a long time before your pending points appear in your total so at first it might not seem worth it. I recommend visiting their survey centre and sponsored content polls regularly.

[ValuedOpinions](http://www.valuedopinions.com.au/) This is my second favourite Survey site. Earn MONEY for surveys on various topics. Have currently earned $65.05 - enough for 3x$20 Rebel Sport Gift Cards (other rewards options available) and still have money pending. This site also take a little while before pending money appears.

[WhatDoYouThink?](http://wdyt.com.au/) Earn points for surveys on various topics, quick surveys (polls), website views, completing offers and shopping. Have currently earned 2530 points - enough for $20 cash (2,000 points), (other reward options available).

[YourVoice](http://www.yourvoice.com.au/ow/index.aspx?chapterid=12800&amp;filterid=2382) This is my favourite survey site. Earn money for surveys on various topics and also product testing. Have currently earned $300 - enough for 3x$100 Rebel Sport Gift cards (which for some reason are not coming up on their Webshop, crap. have emailed them). I highly recommend visiting this site daily and checking for available surveys (for some reason they don't send a lot of emails about available surveys but their are plenty available when I check).

[YourOpinion](http://www.youropinion.com.au/signup.aspx?State=Join&amp;TCom=&amp;TWeb=&amp;TCre=&amp;TMed=&amp;TID=) Earn MONEY for surveys on various topics (if you don't qualify you do still get $0.20 or 2 prize draw entries). I have currently earned $17.40 - just need $20 for PayPal.

[Paid Focus Group](https://paidfocusgroups.com.au/) Earn MONEY for surveys on various topics. Currently have $6.46 - just need $17 for PayPal.

Money/Rebel Sport Gift Card currently redeemable so = $865.05 (pending approx. $70).


Other Sites:

[MyView](http://www.myview.com.au/default.aspx) Earn points for surveys on various topics. Unfortunately just limited gift cards available. Currently have 1,400 points (and some pending) - need 2,000 for a Coles/Target gift card.

[Nine Rewards](http://www.ninerewards.com.au/home.aspx) Earn MONEY from doing surveys on various topics. Unfortunately you can only redeem the money in 3 ways: Ticketek ezyGift vouchers, Hoyts Adult Unrestricted Super Saver movie vouchers or Magshop gift vouchers. Have earned $28.90 so far and am gonna use that for mags.

[BrandLeaders](http://www.brandleaders.com.au/) Earn points for letterbox catalogue surveys (very quick and easy). Redeem points for entries into Prizes (Last Prize was a Kindle). Unfortunately haven't won anything so far.

[Acorn Ideas](https://www.acornideas.com.au/Portal/default.aspx) Complete surveys for entries into their prize draws.

I've also already redeemed about $170 in gift cards/money this year from these surveys.

I would love to have referred you guys and earned extra points but I'd rather just do a random act of kindness by posting this. I hope this helps all you battling, online Aussies out.

If you have any questions please feel free to comment or PM Me.

EDIT If you are interested in joining a survey site the best advice I can give is:

Keep at it. Some surveys are interesting (like evaluating new product ideas) and some are boring as all hell but I've answered every survey invitation I've been sent.

Check your junk mail. I get a lot of surveys accidentally put in there.

Be patient. Sometimes there is a lag in survey invitations (might be why I've joined so many). Also some sites have your points/money as being 'pending' and even though it is yours and it will be added to your total you can't see it on the website until it is added after the waiting period (it can be a little discouraging).",,False,,t5_2s5or,1354079253.0,,,True,t3_13urxw,http://www.reddit.com/r/beermoney/comments/13urxw/survey_sites_i_use_and_income_so_far_australia/,

In my previous lurking sometime back in October I discovered FreeMyApps through this wonderful subreddit. I decided recently that I wanted to really update others on why you all should be using this great passive earner!

**The best feature of FreeMyApps:** Use it almost anywhere as long as you have your mobile device on you. It's for both iOS and Android! What's great is that the ""credits"" are device dependent. Meaning that if you have both an iPhone and an iPad (or any combination of iOS/Android device), you can ""double"" earn credits at the same time!

**How it works:** You visit FreeMyApps and install the featured apps from the iTunes App Store or Google Play store to your device. **You must open and run the app for at least 30 seconds** for it to give you credits. Then you can just uninstall the app if you don't want it. 99.9% of the time these apps are free. I can only remember one time since October that they've asked you to buy an app, and even then they gave you an exorbitant amount of credits for it. Once you achieve a certain amount of ""credits"" you can choose a gift card option to redeem, such as **iTunes credit, Amazon.com credit, Hulu Plus subscription, Xbox Live, Groupon** and more! Most standard apps are worth 80 credits, but they post a pretty close to equal amount of apps worth between ~160-320 credits. Gift cards can be redeemed starting at 300 credits.

**My results:** In the past three months, I've earned $60 in iTunes gift cards from just my iPhone. I also have nearly ~4000 points at this point and am waiting for another 500 before I redeem another $15. Since December I started doing this on my iPad as well and also have almost another $15 from that device, so $30 for the month of December.

Here's a screenshot from my last month. I redeemed 4500 credits on my iPhone December 6th and I already have 3975 credits again.

[screenshot!](http://imgur.com/T1xA3.jpg)

I was also on vacation for a week in December and didn't check the site once and still have this many credits in a month.

The apps have slowed down a bit since the holidays but are slowly picking back up. They've added a bunch more rewards though! If you take 5 minutes a day and check the site you can easily add $15/mo or more per device in rewards.

**Open these links from your phone/tablet**
[Referral](http://m.freemyapps.com/share/url/4f68177a) | [Non-referral](http://m.freemyapps.com)

I know a lot of people have mentioned this on here prior, but I wanted to post my real results. It's far exceeded my expectations and I don't have a need to buy any more apps through iTunes for a long time.

I'm also happy to answer any questions anyone has on FreeMyApps. Check it out!

**EDIT:** I've calculated an average based on the apps I've downloaded and their respective credit payout. (iOS)

Average app payout: **134.59 credits**

Highest app payout: **480 credits (once)**

Lowest app payout: **72 credits (twice)**",,False,,t5_2s5or,1357772795.0,,,True,t3_169ndq,http://www.reddit.com/r/beermoney/comments/169ndq/my_3_months_with_freemyapps_almost_90_in_earnings/,

I decided to give it a shot and figured I'd check back in and let you know what I've learned and earned thus far.

I currently have two main active shops. One devoted to fitness themed shirts and another devoted to pop culture. I have about 30 designs total of which I have sold 5 (and 1 design twice). I am sitting pretty on $23 of profit. I have done some minor promotion via tumblr and twitter (posting each new design with related hashtags). Most traffic I've gotten to the site has come from two separate reddit posts (the first to /r/Fitness which ended poorly and has led to me mostly abandoning that shop). Thus far sales have had little to no correlation with traffic spikes.

**Lessons Learned:**

* Always use Anvil shirts as the base design. American Apparel is very expensive.
* Be careful about using memes. I based most of my fitness themed shirts around existing memes and was basically yelled out of the forum. I've also only sold one shirt from that product line. Not worth it. 
* Cash in on new and emerging trends as much as possible. Half of my sales come from designs based on [The Sloppy Swish](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBzG0CCAx4U).
* Simple sells. I have found much better luck with shirts that are just text with maybe some fun fonts. I've seen much less interest come from designs that use graphics. 
* Don't over-think it or spend too much time on it. This is a passive income source but it could be a long time before you see a return on your investment (over two weeks before I made my first sale). I aim to spend 20 minutes or less per shirt. That way the time you invest can be paid back with just one sale (My commission is generally 3-4 bucks).
* Find a good balance between obscurity and popularity. Too obscure and nobody will look for your design. (I have sold exactly 0 IT Crowd or Finding Bigfoot themed shirts) Too popular and you'll be lost among all the others (Ditto for The Hobbit and Doctor Who). 

I think that more or less covers it. Skreened has yet to make me rich but it's a lot more fun than most other systems I've found here on beermoney. It's also always nice to get a notification that you made $4 while you were sleeping.

Anybody else using Skreened or another POD t-shirt distributor? What have your experiences been like? Any tips and tricks from the trenches?

I've been doing surveys for quite a long time with my gf and we've been earning a very nice side-income, which comes in handy when money is tight. Referral links are marked by a (ref)

From my least to most favourite:

* [Toluna](http://uk.toluna.com/) - Mixed opinion about it. 80000 points for £15 amazon voucher, no paypal/cash payments. Getting the points after a survey often takes up to 6 weeks and the redemption is not instant. However, they have a LOT of surveys, so they can be chained easily. Sometimes they have 30000-40000 points surveys too but they are very rare.

* [Surveyhead (UK)](http://www.surveyhead.co.uk/) [(US)](http://www.surveyhead.com/) - (I'm only subscribed to the US site) $0.50-$5 surveys regularly, sometimes up to $10. Minimum $20 payout through paypal. Survey awards can take up to 6 weeks, and payment itself can take up to 6 weeks too, but they definitely pay. You also get pretty nice cash out of just filling out your profile. They have a sister site called gratispoints.com which is nearly identical but uses points, but I got too annoyed with it and never reached payout threshold.

* [YourSayPays](http://www.yoursaypays.co.uk/) - Very low pay on actual surveys (£0.25-£0.75) and paypal payout threshold of £20. However, the surveys themselves are very short, don't kick you out, and they regularly invite you for telephone surveys for £1. They also almost every month invite you to 1 or more webcam interviews for £5 each (you record and upload a video of yourself talking about a subject). Last month, I got £25 just for these, which was very nice. Overall a friendly and enjoyable site but no added bonuses.

* [Valued Opinions (UK)](https://valuedopinions.co.uk) [(US)](https://valuedopinions.com) - Very friendly site, but only pays in vouchers of minimum £10.  I don't know about the US one (they are separate), the UK one used to have Tesco vouchers but not anymore. They do have Amazon e-vouchers which can be instantly redeemed (the other ones are physical).

Minimum £3 through paypal (voucher alternatives available, including Amazon). About 70-120 points per survey, 345 points for £3, 575 points for £5. 

* [OpinionWorld](http://opinionworld.co.uk/) - My personal favourite. 1000 points for £10. Survey rewards are instant, redemption is instant through paypal and can be any amount between £10-£50. During xmas/easter etc they also usually hold a minigame which you can get instead of a survey and win 50-100 points very easily. Girlfriend also got invited to an easy 7-day diary panel with them and got £50 out of it.

All of these sites kick you out of surveys somewhat often though, sometimes can be extremely frustrating. MySurvey's flash engine is also pretty awful to deal with...

In total, in the past year or so, I probably earned together with my gf over £600-700, counting vouchers. I don't do them too religiously either. Hopefully this helps some of you.

Here's a site that I've used in the past but forgot about. [PostLoop](http://www.postloop.com/invite/zack) is a site where forum and blog owners post their websites and pay PostLoop a small fee to get points, which they spend on their sites. Then you, the /r/beermoney user, post quality content on their site. In exchange, you get points in your account.

Every point is worth $.05. Every blog post and comment (on average) earns 1.56. If you have quality posting trends, you'll even get bonus points in your account. I have a 4.31/5.00 rating, so I get .35 extra points per post. This equates to $.0955 per post or blog comment I make. That's around 50/posts per day for $5.

This isn't a site where you do nothing and get paid. You HAVE to make decent posts. An example of a ""decent post"" is something like this:

&gt; Yeah, I saw that on reddit the other day. It looks like a pretty sweet program, you can earn traffic for your blog or even straight cash if that's your sort of thing. Plus that good-looking fellow, flotwig, is promoting it. I should totally click his referral link, it's won't hurt me and is pretty good payment for him showing me this fantastic site!

This is a BAD post:

&gt; yeah postloops' cool

It's not too hard. There are sites for all interest areas - computers, cars, construction, health, etc. [Here's a listing of the currently available forums.](http://www.postloop.com/sites/forums/all)

I've never used PostLoop for cash, but I know you can. Oodles of payment proofs are a mere Google away. I actually used them in exchange for posts on my forum - I made 534 posts and got 535 posts in return. Pretty swanky. If I wanted to exchange that for cash, it would equate to a cool $34.15 for a week's worth. [My proof thread.](http://www.postloop.com/support/index.php?threads/over-400-posts-received-so-far.1154/)

So hey, you're already using your time clicking around on the web. Why not get paid for posting on forums in your interest areas?

When you sign up, you do all the basic information that every other survey website has your do and whatnot...

You get e-mails when surveys are in that are acceptable for your profile. Usually 1 or 2 a week. 

Each survey can range from 0.25 to 2.00 (real money)
The surveys worth less are shorter and the ones worth more are longer (usually 15 min long). 

I could have cashed out probably 2 and a half times by now, but I ignored a lot of the legerweb emails telling me there is a new survey for me to do, and then when I finally got around to those emails maybe a day or two later, the survey was no longer available. So if you actually do every survey when you get the e-mail you should have no problem getting the reward. 

if you don't want your surveys paid in dollars or cents, you can have them paid in airmiles as well.

Each survey gives you points put into a monthly draw for $1000 cash prizes.

It's great if you got nothing to do at the end of each day or on a coffee break or something! A decently quick way to make some extra money every few months.

I have been ill and homebound since December 2012. I have seen tons of doctors, had a bunch of surgeries and procedures, and no one seems to know what is causing my chronic pain, fatigue, headaches, etc. I've tried lots of different medications and diets. 

Because of my illness, I have used all of my sick leave, vacation, and FMLA. Without my income my husband and I cannot pay our bills. I cannot handle a full workload at a regular job until I get better. The job I just lost was incredibly stressful; I dealt with very demanding clients on a daily basis and an ever increasing workload (due to state budget cuts). I actually think the increase in stress is what triggered whatever is afflicting me. 

I know this is beer money, but I NEED some kind of income. $100-200 a month would even be great as we could pay a couple of bills with it or buy some groceries. More would be better, of course.

I have been using mturk casually for about a year, but I am not good at finding hits. I use the subreddit on here, but those go pretty fast. I have made a Squidoo profile and have started writing, but it seems really flaky and I'm honestly not sure if I'll ever see any money from it. I have started a blog in hopes to be able to monetize it eventually, and opened an Amazon Affiliates account. 

I have worked since I was in college and have been a teacher, teaching high school and middle school English, art, history, and have worked for the state government. I'm a decent writer, but I do not type quickly - so transcribing isn't really something at which I am stellar. I don't have to get rich quick, but I do need something that will work. As for other skills, I can make beautiful handmade soap but without the funds for supplies it's not doing me much good. 

What else can I do? Can I use the things I've already started? I feel really lost right now. I've always worked and provided for myself.

If you do the offer, make sure to stay organized, and cancel in under 30 days. Also, you make 20% of what each direct ref makes, so not too bad in that category either.

* Everything is very simple to understand. The site specifically states  how much you will earn and every step, down to every click, that you need to do in order to be credited with the payment.
* I've tried too many survey sites to name and made the usual $0.10-$0.40 per survey that takes almost 30 minutes to complete, along with endless amounts of spam and adware.

1352750851.0,24,self.beermoney,132v02,Discussion on the removal of the $20 bonus on Infoarmy.,27,3,15,http://www.reddit.com/r/beermoney/comments/132v02/discussion_on_the_removal_of_the_20_bonus_on/,"Now... Infoarmy wants to get rid of their $20 bonus. However, just look at what Cheeseman said on infoarmy's forums:

The economics of why keeping bonuses makes sense:

Supply of labor:
- The number of people willing to complete a report for $20 instant cash is HIGH.
- Instant gratification, decent hourly wage, + bonus if report is sold
- The number of people willing to complete a report for revenue share is LOW
- We all do risk/reward in our heads everyday without thinking.
- 2-4 hours of my time - is it worth the CHANCE that this report may sell?
- Right now the probability of my report selling is VERY LOW (1/2500)*#ofreportssold/unittime
- This is near 0 right now.

The value of this company is in DATA and INFORMATION. The information part is what we are selling now - lots of data packed into easy to read reports. However, the amount of information does not scale linearly with increasing data, rather it does it exponentially. The more data you collect, the more information you can sell.

The Numbers:

$20 per PR per report x 10,000 reports = $200,000
$10 per SR per report x 10,000 reports = $100,000

For $300,000 in ""wages"" paid out, they have a database of 10,000 reports and can now sell unlimited subscriptions. Now let's extrapolate this more, with their 1,000,000 report goal of ""complete disruption"" in mind:

$20 PR reports x 1,000,000 = $20,000,000
$10 SR reports x 1,000,000 = $10,000,000
$30,000,000 for 1,000,000 reports, whereby they will disrupt the entire industry.

That number of reports would also give you close to a $100 million valuation assuming $100 per report. However, the value of data is not necessarily what it is worth individually, but rather collectively. You know have a huge database of 1,000,000 companies that gives you an INCREDIBLE view of market insights. You can now sell individual reports, subscriptions, and ""360 degree market intelligence"" that will be beyond valuable. What sectors are hiring? Who has seen the largest YTY growth? Which sectors are shrinking?

It makes NO SENSE for them not to continue to offer the bonuses indefinitely until they get to a point where one report simply isn't worth $30 to them any longer, but that becomes a large number of reports.

So, do you think they should get rid of it? Or not? I sincerely hope not.",,False,,t5_2s5or,False,,,True,t3_132v02,http://www.reddit.com/r/beermoney/comments/132v02/discussion_on_the_removal_of_the_20_bonus_on/,

[FusionCash](http://fca.sh/1f6jp) is a GPT site where they claim to offer the highest payouts and in my experience, they have. They have really expanded their offers to include many offered on other sites, but it's so almost always more. For example, I have never been given less than $1 for a survey of any length, and in many cases I've gotten more!

They also have a daily PTC and a daily cash email, so you're guaranteed to make $0.17 a day ... obviously not a lot of money, but it adds up. There are a lot of daily surveys in the offer section, too, but I don't usually have time for those. 

In addition to the offers, there are also tasks, search bonus, videos and most recently an offer wall. I can only speak for myself, but it's a lot easier for me when everything has an easy-to-understand monetary value, rather than points. Plus, there are bonus opportunities for things like survey disquals and posting to the forum. 

As for the easy $12, as promised. 

First of all, there's an $5 sign-up bonus. In addition, one of the offers you can complete is to sign up for blockbuster. As user [blaurum](http://www.reddit.com/user/blaurum) taught me, you can use the promo code 'video' when signing up for that to get a month free (instead of just the discounted price they are offering). This way, nothing hits your credit card and you can still get credited. I used my paypal to pay and cancelled within the month and had no problem with the credit being revoked etc. It's a pretty easy--and not to mention free--$7 to get you started on this site, which has a $25 cashout minimum.

First off, you'll need a Facebook account to sign up. Minimum cashout is $2 but this is achieved very easily. I made over $6 in under an hour by going through websites and answering some simple questions.

Slight downside is, you have to cashout through a site called Wepay which isn't used widely. With Wepay, you can request a check to be sent to you or link your bank account with to deposit the money.

Still, people should give this site a try. Seems legit so far.

The main reason I'm posting, though, is to discuss the [Refer-O-Matic](http://bm.youregoingtolove.me/referomatic.php). This super awesome web-based program has been set up to allow redditors to share referral links for Superpoints (and bonus links separately), Swagbucks, Bing Rewards, Topline, Paid Viewpoint, CashCrate, Listia, MyBrowserCash, and AppRedeem. 

*****

This is a great idea and really seems to be one of the fairest options for getting links out there, since the makers of the RoM have put a lot of thought into creating fair exposure rules (including standardizing how long the links are available). However, within the Beermoney subreddit the Refer-O-Matic isn't used very much, so although we have this great system available, we're still spamming our invites around and filling comment threads with referral trains.

While this is functional, it's not really fair, nor is it really the most helpful way for a newbie to get information and get started. The original concept of the subreddit seems to have been, post something informative and helpful to others, and readers will ""tip"" you for your help by using your referral link. Unfortunately we've built ourselves into a bit of a pyramid scheme, in that the most helpful tidbits about any given beermoney method tend not to change, so whoever wrote the first informative Superpoints tutorial covered almost everything and gets a large chunk of referral link exposure. Then people who come later, who are part of this community and have just as much a right to the community's help, have a harder time writing an informative post and getting their link out there. These people are forced to hop on a referral train, hope to dig up a useful tidbit the OP overlooked, or go without the help of the subreddit.

The other weekly $5 AGC giveaway is on their FB page--best caption with the most likes wins it.


They don't have a ton of people using this app, so odds are fairly good.  I personally know probably 80% of the people who have won $50 gc--I'd say about 30-40 people have won to date.

I know many of you have used [BetaPunch](http://betapunch.com) to quench your thirst for beermoney in the past, but lately it has been kind of slow for available testing jobs.

I have been trying to brainstorm for a while what we could do to make the site more active so there are more opportunities for you guys to make money. I know many people have stated making as much as $30 / hour when times were good! I am also proud to announce that we have now paid out more than $4,600 to testers since we began. 

There have been about 2-3 jobs listed per day, but as I am sure you know, they get taken up rather quickly by our regulars.

I was hoping we could start a conversation and brainstorm together a way that we could attract more websites to sign up and try out our service.

Something I have been thinking about is creating a referral system so you would be paid for referring new websites to BetaPunch. If a website signed up via your link you would get a percentage of however much money they spent purchasing testers via our service. We would automatically deposit the money right into your tester account.

Before I spend the money to develop this system, I want to know from you guys if you would use it and if you think it would work.

What do you think? 

If this thread isn't allowed the mods can delete it.

Thank you for your time,

Hi,

I know a post like this gets posted every now and then but the question ""**what can I do as a non-US person?**"" gets also posted frequently. The more information on these kinds of sites and programs the better, because there are a lot of scams out there and not everything is worth it.

I've written down my findings on some of the things I've tried out, am trying out and am actively doing. I've provided each with a normal and referral link. The programs/sites are ordered by increasing minimum payout to **paypal**. Sometimes there are other payout options like Amazon giftcards but this really isn't interesting if you're not living in the US.

* **Pollbuzzer**: You register your e-mail address where they will send you a question about once a month. If you respond to it, **you get $1** that will be transferred to your paypal in a week. I highly recommend subscribing.

*Answer poll, immediate pay; $1*
[REF](http://pollbuzzer.com/?r=b25VY3UwSUpycngrK2VwNmY5RUhzZz090) [non-ref](http://pollbuzzer.com/)

* **Naturebucks**: Here you can click **ads** and do **offers** for which you get money and points (which can be converted to money). The offers are the best for the US but there are also good ones for other countries. I recommend looking at the most and newest credited. Because **the payout minimum is only $0.05** it's probably the best PTC/offers site for non-US.


*PTC, offers, signing up, surveys; min $0.05* 
[REF](http://naturebucks.com/members/register.php?ref=Proim) [non-ref](http://naturebucks.com/)


* **Nature Dollars**: The second in the ""Nature"" family. The same as the bucks one, and same **payout minimum of $0.05**.


*PTC, offers, signing up, surveys; min $0.05* 
[REF](http://naturedollars.com/members/register.php?ref=Proim) [non-ref](http://naturedollars.com/)


* **Euro Piñata**: European Neobux is the best way I can describe it, Neobux is also available for Europe so you can check that out also if you want. It's a fairly new PTC site but it looks promising. As with Neobux you can rent referrals to add to your earnings. I recommend looking to this: [Strategy](http://neobuxbasics.wordpress.com/strategy/). **Minimum payout is $2**.


*PTC (Neobux clone); min $2* 
[REF](http://www.euro-pinata.com/?r=Proim) [non-ref](http://www.euro-pinata.com)


* **Nature GPT**: The third of the ""Nature"" family. It's basically the same as the bucks one, only higher payout. **Minimum payout is $2**.


*PTC, offers, signing up, surveys; min $2* 
[REF](http://naturegpt.com/members/register.php?ref=Proim) [non-ref](http://naturegpt.com/)


* **Natureclix**: The fourth of the ""Nature"" family. As the name suggests this one is more about **clicking ads**. There are more than on Naturebucks. But also here you have **offers**, a lot are the same as those on Naturebucks so I'd recommend doing the offers there because of the lower payout minimum. **Minimum payout is higher as of a couple of days: $2**.

*PTC, offers, signing up, surveys; min: $5*
[REF](http://www.natureclix.com/members/register.php?ref=Proim) [non-ref](http://www.natureclix.com)


* **Natureprizes**: The fifth one in the ""Nature"" family. Partly the same as the clix one. You can do **offers, signing up, surveys and ad clicking** but again, **higher payout minimum ($5)**.

*Offers, signing up, surveys, ad clicking; min: $5*
[REF](http://natureprizes.com/members/register.php?ref=Proim) [non-ref](http://natureprizes.com)

* **Gomez Peer**: A **passive earner** that may or may not work good for your specific country. The idea is add give your computers calculation capacity to a network of other computers to join in a giant calculation machine. It can take a while for your account to be activated and working times can be low. Again **for some people it works, for some it doesn't**. This is a list of the earnings per country: [ratings](http://www.gomezpeerzone.com/current-payment-rates/). **The minimum payout is $5**.

*Passive; min: $5*
[REF](http://www.gomezpeerzone.com/application-apply/?Referrer=proim) [non-ref](http://www.gomezpeerzone.com)

* **Clixsense**: One of the older and most prominent paid to click websites where you can **click adds, complete surveys, registration offers, do tasks through Crowdflower and/or play the clixgrid**. You can earn a 5% bonus every day if you complete a list of things: 2 ads AND 15 clixgrid clicks AND (10 CrowdFlower tasks OR 2 offers OR 5 Crowdflower tasks and 1 offer) AND visit the forum. The **minimum payout ($8)** is rather high but you can do quite a lot, there are about **15 or more ads** to click every day. 


*PTC, offers, surveys, clixgrid; min: $8*
[REF](http://www.clixsense.com/?4994939) [non-ref](http://www.clixsense.com)


* **Slice The Pie**: Absolutely **the most fun money earner** out there! You listen to a song for at least 90 seconds whilst **writing a short review** about the intro, the lyrics, the vocals, the instruments, etc. This is to help the artist and you also get paid for the amount of work you put into your review. Just saying ""this sucks"" or ""this is awesome"" isn't going to help very much and thus you will only get the minimum pay. This should help writing a good review: [review help](http://chasmac.hubpages.com/hub/slicethepie-reviews). **Minimum payout is high ($10)** but it's really fun to do.

*review songs; min: $10*

In case you don't know here's a brief description of featurepoints: Feature points is a webapp that pays you for downloading apps to get them a higher ranking in the app store. Basically the whole idea of it is to get you to install the apps in their offers and play them for a minute and then you are paid an average of 90 points which is equal to 15 cents (this adds up quick) I don't know if this is the same on android. You can cash out with a variety of different options including  amazon cards from $1-$100 and $10-$100 for paypal. Every dollar of rewards is 600 points but the points add up quickly as there are often one or two offers per day. To install feature points goto this link in your device's web browser (all ios and android mobile device's supported) [referal](https://featurepoints.com/r/TJTEDR) or enter the ref code TJTEDR in the app [non-ref](https://featurepoints.com) You can also search it in the Google Play Store.


after the quick sign up you will be prompted to install a profile (IOS only) and then you should select install, don't worry it doesn't modify your device it's just so feature points can know if you installed an app and credit you for it.

I don't mind doing survey sites, just ideally stuff that works.

I'm wanting to try and make around £2.83 a day, or $4.54 American (lets say 5 for simplicity) as I would like to save up to buy a tickets for a flight to visit a friend out in the states. and long story short £2.83 was the 'average' i need to earn a day to save for flights.

I'm a student, so I have loads of spare time on my hands and I don't mind doing survey's or processes that may be slightly lengthy so long as they are somewhat guaranteed to pay out as I know some sites aren't that reputable.

Thanks for any help and advice you can give me, much appreciated.

Then, it was only available for iPhone/iPad users, but is now open to Android. 

If you'd like to sign up under me, my link is [here](http://sp-swissAliso.gym-pact.com)(you can sign up online and then download the app on your phone using the username you created online. If you don't want to use my referral, then just download the app. 

The cool thing about getting referrals is that they help your pact. So let's say you make a pact that you will go to the gym 4 days a week, but you only make it 3 days, but someone you referred went to the gym that week-one of their workouts will count for you. I wouldn't rely on the referrals as means to skip going for easy money, but it could come in handy. I'm not sure if you still get money from a referral if you make your pact before they hit the gym though. 

My advice for beginners is to pick a reasonable pact to start. I actually work at a gym, and I work there 3-4 times a week, but I actually work there three times a week, the other times I'm there to workout. I could probably be fine with making a 4 day pact, but to be on the safe side, I just do a 3 day pact, because if I miss a day at the gym, and I don't go for a 30 minute run instead, I don't want to have to pay 5-10 bucks.

Also, before you can earn any money you need to sign up with a credit card (if you're that worried about it, use an old VISA gift card that has little or no value left) and they make you do a trial week before you get paid for it. 

I got $1.53 last week for my 3 gym trips, which isn't bad for stuff you do anyway. I believe you cash out via Paypal when you have $10 or more. The amount you get per week depends on those who didn't make their pacts. So some weeks you have potential to make more than others.

Founder of BetaPunch here. I wanted to invite college students to take part in a special opportunity to be paid $5 for giving their feedback for a new social networking site.

**What you will be doing?**: Recording your screen and voicing your opinion as to what you think the website needs to do in order to improve. (Don't worry, you wont have to download or install anything on your computer. Or screen recorder is completely web based. So you will click a button on our website that says ""Record"" and that will launch the screen recorder).

**How much will I be paid?**: You will be paid up to $5 based off of the quality of feedback you provide for this website. So you can't just click aimlessly around on the site and expect to be paid $5. 

**How long will this take me?**: This will take at most 10-15 minutes of your time.

**When and how will I be paid?**: Normally, we require testers to have earned at least $15 in their account before they can request a cash out. For this particular site we will be cashing out all of our testers after they complete their test for the website. So the $15 min cash out requirement will not apply to you. After you confirm your paypal email we will deliver payment within 24 hours but in most cases you will get your payment in less than 1 hour.

Payments will be made only via paypal. We will email you after you are done your test and confirm with you what your paypal email address is.

**How do I get started?**: Go to this [tester welcome page](http://www.betapunch.com/tester/refer/639) and sign up with your email. Be sure to watch the example video and read through the FAQ For Testers section. Then locate the listing for Freezecrowd in our feed of available tests and read their instructions.

**How many spots are available for this gig?**: 10 testers available. 

**Can I do tests for other websites after this one?**: Yes, of course. Once you sign up to be a tester, you are free to test what ever sites are available in our test feed. Keep in mind though, all the normal rules for cash outs will apply for other websites you test.

Go to their website, record your feedback, and upload your test. It's as simple as that.

If you have any questions please reel free to post them here!

Thanks and I look forward to paying a lot of beermoney today.

1351450093.0,19,self.beermoney,128aak,The foreigners' guide to making cash on your iPhone - AKA the guide that will get you 5 points instead of 2 on apptrailers!,30,11,15,http://www.reddit.com/r/beermoney/comments/128aak/the_foreigners_guide_to_making_cash_on_your/,"Oh hi there! *waves*

I recently started using the apps: Apptrailers. A neat little app that takes fairly little to manage but makes a nice chunk of change. aaaaand JunoWallet(m.junowallet.com and the BambooWallet app)

Before I start talking about tips and tricks I want to tell you a little secret. Even though each app is a mere 1/2 cent things add up quite fast. Another thing you have to do is start thinking long term! Let's say you make $3(4500 points) a day, if you can continue to get $3 a day for an entire month that means you have $90 bucks by the end of the month! AWESOME!(Example using app trailers)

Next thing is that I am going to be devoting this little guide towards the foreign beermoney-makers. I live in South-Africa and I still get the 5 point trailers as well as the major money earners! And in JunoWallet's side of things I get a lot more offers!

Okay I am done rambling let's get to business! First thing is fist, if you want to make money and a lot of it you are gonna have to pay a bit. You see we are going to use a VPN to ""pretend"" that we live in the US. I personally really like the speed and the accessibility of [Tunnelbear](http://www.tunnelbear.com/). I think it is $5 a month. You can also use HotSpot VPN(iPhone app, $1 a month, a bit slower)

So you go through paying for tunnelbear and then go to [this site](https://www.tunnelbear.com/ios), login and have it install their VPN settings on your device. Now connect via VPN. (Use the US server)

YAY! Now you are able to view all those shiny offers worth 5+ points! As well as the plethora that JunoWallet's HTML5 app has to offer.

**Apptrailers:** Ref Code: gighespivs

Now this is what you are gonna do: If you want to make a bunch of points fast on Apptrailers(m.appredeem.com), download apps. They are waay more time efficient. They will usually net you around 500 points. I really dislike downloading apps but I realized that if I want to get to milestones I really need to purchase some free apps! They also help speed up your leveling up thing which will give you a couple of bonus points. Aim for about 4500 points a day.

If your internet speed allows it, watch the higher point videos first. Note: VPN slows your internet down on the device it is being used on. Otherwise stick to the 5 pointers. If an ad gets stuck pull down the notification bar, that usually gets rid of the video. If your points go down to 2 that means your VPN has disconnected, just reconnect. Make sure the little VPN icon is displaying at the top of your screen BEFORE entering the app!

Also remember you only have to watch the ad before the actual app trailer, so as soon as the app trailer starts you can click done and get those lovely points. 

Another thing to remember is to do the daily scratcher it is a free 15+ points if you win. NEVER do the other scratchers unless you are willing to part with your points.

Take note of the fact that the app is linked to your DEVICE not your login info. That means if you have a bunch of iOS devices you can use them all at once to get those scrumptious points. I am currently only using my iPhone and iPad. If you are using multiple devices login with the same details and dont use your own referral code.

**JunoWallet/Bamboowallet:** REF Code: CG869016

I feel that this earns money a lot quicker than apptrailers but they sometimes get limited in terms of apps. Using the same VPN you can login and behold the magic that is this app. 

**The actual app:**

Using the app is basically like using app trailers, go to ""earn gifts and click ""rewards per video"". You are now watching ads for double the amount apptrailers was offering BUT only watch featured clips, the virool videos are long and can take a while to load.

**EDIT**: I misread, you only have to watch 13 seconds of the videos to be credited 1 cent. Sorry! Also in offers there is an AARKI option they also have videos for 1c each.

You will also be using this to cash out.

**The HTML-app**

Go to m.junowallet.com, and sign in. Then create a springboard shortcut for it. Now as you can see there are a bunch of icons. Quickly scan through them before downloading anything. Sometimes and app can appear in multiple reward zones(I call them that). To make sure you get the most out of your download click on all the ones that feature that app before downloading. You can sometimes get up to a dollar for just one app! I have been able to make up to $10 a day when I am motivated enough.

Something to take note of is the fact that it takes 24 hours to pay out.

**BONUS!!!:**

Okay so a neat way I have found to make even more money is to use the cash I make via junowallet and buy iTunes gift cards with it. Then I use AppReviewer Pro ([Referral](https://m.appreviewerpro.com/?ref=yxwhkntt) / [Non-referral](https://m.appreviewerpro.com)) and buy the premium apps to review(also the free ones), you get a lot more money back and at the end of the day you haven't even spent a penny. How awesome is that?! Also buying premium apps allow you to cash out at $5! 

I sincerely hope this boosts your money making prowess on iOS devices, I personally dislike the fact that US users get all the action but oh well :D

Good luck.

Datsoup v2 should be up and working. Keep in mind that there are bound to bugs that i missed. I NEED YOUR HELP TO FIND THEM! If you find a bug please please please send use the contact page and let me know about it. 

Functions:

1. User accounts - Yes everybody now needs to have an account in order to submit their referral codes. First off this helps cut down spam and garbage a decent amount. Second this ties into the new system of referral dumping.

2. Referral dumping is no longer. Instead you are required to log in once every 30 days and your codes will be kept. Forget to log in? Now you have to go back in and enter all of your codes. Not too much of a chore but still better just to login once a month er so. 

NOTE: you actually have to log out and then log back in. merely just visiting datsoup while logged in from a previous session doesn't work. You have to actually go out and then come back in. 

3. Unlimited Site capability. You'll notice in your profile section that you can create sites/referral pools. This is so that I don't have to do it and the site can grow as programs come along not just as I decide to add them. You should also have the referral URL without your ref code in it. your referral code and a description of what you have to do on the site. Your referral pools sucess depends greatly on your description and url copy and pasting. If you have a faulty URL nobody will be able to sign up with your link. and there goes all of those referrals you could have had. 

NOTE: send a message through contact us to get a url fixed/changed I decided to not give normal users this ability for obvious reasons.

DOUBLE NOTE: IF YOU PUT YOUR REF CODE IN THE REF URL IT WILL NOT WORK! 

so say you put www.referral.com/ref/mrfrasha in as the url when it really should have been www.referral.com/ref/ and then mrfrasha would go in the ref code box. If you do it the first way you will get something like this www.referral.com/ref/mrfrashaanotheruser

You can see where that doesn't work so please don't think you're gaming the system. your just being a pain.

4. New design! BUTTONS! - while i realize the design still lacks I do believe it look considerably better now that the blue is a bit darker and we actually have semi respectable buttons. So yeah. woohoo.

5. Database filtering - So we had to annoying users submitting shit like this in the previous version - mrfrASHA, MrFrAsHA, mFRASHA, etc. and the submission form would accept them and then they would have more referrals in there. well it still accepts them but now it deletes the extras out. Not sure if the culprits are redditors but that problem has been addressed and solved. So you're wasting your time if you do that.

So yeah. Please feel free to add sites that you use and to contact me about descriptions and URLs that are incorrect.

Also - I'm gonna be leaving mcdonalds in a bit so I can only answer questions for so long. If you don't know [now you know](http://www.reddit.com/r/beermoney/comments/yrv6d/datsoupcom_v2_the_adventure/), nigga.

Please ask here if you have any immeadite questions any question you have later you can you contact us to figure those out.

EDIT: Also just as like a look forward I think I'm going to redo how the signupcentral is organized.

If you're already a member, I hope you find this useful. I feel like most members haven't explored the offers fully.

This is all based around the huge fact that at Neobux you can use your FREE Neopoints to extend and recycle your referrals.

Neobux is constantly improving and one of the best new features is the ""offers"" section in which you can earn Neopoints for doing things.

THESE CAN NOT BE FORGOTTEN ABOUT! You get paid more $ worth in Neopoints than you do actual jobs in the Mini-jobs section that pay real money. Neobux practically throws Neopoints at you because it keeps you using their site and they've been paid from the advertisers already. This means it's super easy to get tons of free stuff.

In the past week, I've renewed ~39 referrals for 60 days by JUST using Neopoints that I've earned from doing the free offers.

The mini jobs are a lot like MTurk. There are even Crowdflower jobs. Those pay only $.08 per job. In Neopoints? UP TO 70 POINTS! That's nearly an entire recycle! But these are laborious and I'm lazy :P so..

Some of the offers pay up to 2,000+ points and they are 100% legitimate like the free 3 month Netflix trial. Get your family members to sign up, friends, family friends, and friends of family and you'll see how I'm rolling in the points ;) haha!

The biggest pro-tip: find easy, repeatable tasks that pay 12-25 points and do them a lot. These you have to find yourself because they only last a limited time but I've found some that I can get 220ish points out of every few minutes.

I spend a minute everyday placing a few bets. It might take a while to cash out, but you're not really gambling since they will always refill your bankroll if you hit $0. Also, it's a lot more fun than filling out online offers!

(Hopefully some of you guys have benefited from me using your refs :D ) This post is just an update, personal tracker, and some opinions on the various sites I use.

**[TopLine](https://www.jointopline.com/register?fid=NP6RWS73CFBY) / [nonref](https://www.jointopline.com)**
No doubt you guys have heard of this site. It's a passive one where you just replace ads with their ads so you earn money. After a week on here, I have to admit I have hardly noticed a difference in browsing. Currently stacked up 1800 points~ (1000 points = $0.75, min cashout at $10) 

**[I-gagnant-Barre](http://www.i-gagnant-barre.com/?u=dualspeed&amp;lang=en) / [nonref] (http://www.i-gagnant-barre.com/?)**
This one I had to install a bar that has ads running constantly as I'm active. It's slower than topline with my computer usuage. After a week, I have about 7,500 points. (€0.0937 per 1,000 points, Minimum payout at €15.) But what I do like about this is the two games you get to play every day. The card scratching one, I've personally won 500 points off of. 

**[Neobux](http://www.neobux.com/forum/)**
This one is the main PTC site that people use. I currently invested $5 and rented 5 referrals. My rented average is roughly 1.3. I have one super active rented, 2 ok ones, 1 poor, and 1 inactive. I'm planning on getting another 20 referrals then focusing on recycling (might use auto-recycle.) No ref link since I've only used the site for 7 days. ($ 0.50 earned, $2 minimum payout.)

**[PaidViewPoint](http://paidviewpoint.com/?r=xdzy6w) / [nonref](http://paidviewpoint.com)**
This site basically asks you to take a survey a day for $0.10. It's slow for me at the moment but it's basically hassle free and occasionally fun answering questions truthfully (hehe). ($ 1.6 earned, $25 minimum payout)

**[Hits4Pay](http://hits4pay.com/members/index.cgi?dualspeed) / [nonref](http://hits4pay.com)**

Basically it's a get-paid-view ads site where you earn $0.02 per ad viewed. Gives you roughly 4-6 ads a day. Quick, simple, easy. ($5.54 earned, $25 minimum payout)

From my current experience, it seems that a lot of these require high minimum payouts as their way of turning a profit. Most members won't dedicate themselves to achieving the targets. But IMHO, these targets are pretty easy to achieve as long as you do it consistently. Most of these are even effortless. I spend a max of 15 minutes on all of these site combined.

Here's how I did it.,26,5,19,http://www.reddit.com/r/beermoney/comments/tnd1n/update_i_am_no_longer_banned_from_swagbucks_heres/,"Yesterday, I started a [thread about getting banned from Swagbucks](http://www.reddit.com/r/beermoney/comments/tliuh/just_got_banned_from_swagbucks/). Today, I just got an email from Swagbucks telling me that I am allowed to start a new account. I thought I'd share how I did it in case anyone else is looking to get un-banned from Swagbucks.

First, a huge thank you to **delixer** for pointing me to this thread [he started about getting his Swagbucks account reactivated](http://www.reddit.com/r/beermoney/comments/t216z/swagbucks_reactivation_success/). From that thread, I found a links to the [Swagbucks Blog where they specifically discuss auto-refreshing](http://blog.swagbucks.com/2012/04/the-dos-and-dons-of-sbtv.html). Note the following sentence from that blog post:


&gt;""We are willing to reactivate accounts as long as the deactivation was in error or the cheating was limited and the member is willing to stop""


With this in mind, I sent a very polite and apologetic email to Swagbucks admitting that I used an auto-refresher and that I learned my lesson. Less than 24 hours, I received the following email:

&gt;You may open one new account under a new email address but we will monitor your account and any future violations will result in permanent deactivation.
&gt;
&gt;Your account has been flagged for exploiting SBTV through refreshing the same video and or using a bot. Please refrain from using such viewing methods to keep your account in good standing.

Obviously, I will be staying away auto-refreshing. Not a problem since the CAPTCHAs and changes they made auto-refreshing no longer worth it to me weeks ago.

I was able to successfully get my latest account reactivated.


**A Little History**

I had a Swagbucks account that I used and did everything manually and was maxing out SwagbucksTV and SBTV Mobile every day, because of the special that ended in April I was able to get 207SB per day. A few days after the [Swagbucks Blog post about using Swagbucks TV inappropriately](http://blog.swagbucks.com/2012/04/the-dos-and-dons-of-sbtv.html) I had my account deactivated. I e-mailed their compliance department and they informed me that their system was showing that I was using a bot/auto-refresher to run Swagbucks TV.

I explained to them that I do everything manually and that this deactivation is in error. They didn't budge so I inquired if I could start another Swagbucks account, they informed me that I could. A few days after starting my new account I was deactivated again. I changed my usage habits to try to avoid this very situation. On my new account I was running SBTV Mobile to get my 50SB, 7SB from my dailies and the rest I would fill with Special Offers or a round or two of Swagbucks TV so that I would get a minimum of 75SB per day so that I could get my five $5 AGCs.

I e-mailed Swagbucks again and didn't get a response for about a week. I e-mailed them again, just yesterday and I received an e-mail about an hour ago stating that the deactivation was in error and they reactivated my account. SUCCESS!


**My Take Away From This Whole Situation**

If you are a big earner on Swagbucks it makes you a target for deactivation, whether you are regular user or using an auto-refresher. I honestly don't believe, beyond seeing which URLs on SBTV you visit, they can tell if someone is using a bot or not (repeated URLs from an auto-refresher are easy to spot). **Swagbucks CAN and WILL deactivate your account for any reason and they do not have to give you the reason.** Someone took a snippet from their ToS and posted it here recently but I thought I would reiterate that fact.

I've found several other sites that I signed up for in the thought that I would not be able to get my Swagbucks account back and at that point I wasn't going to risk signing up for another account just to get it banned.

Here are the sites I use and enjoy for those who haven't signed up for them yet.

A good portion of my SB have been earned by doing the offers more than once. I've noticed that some offers (such as the Mint.com offer that pays 80-110SB) appear on their site twice, say once on the front page and once under TrialPay. The email associated with my SB account is an alternate, so I used that for the first one. Actually, I thought I *had* to use that one. But I don't. For the second Mint offer that I completed, I used another email and got credit. This also works for the offers that ask you to ""like"" or use an App via Facebook. Since you don't need to use the email associated with your account, you can also do offers that don't apply to you (such as Arthritis Kits, Disney shit, etc) but are worth it to do for the 30 seconds it takes for you to sign up for their emails.

1326317280.0,22,self.beermoney,ocwc3,My Long-Term Hubpages Leverage Method (For New Freelance Writers),26,4,17,http://www.reddit.com/r/beermoney/comments/ocwc3/my_longterm_hubpages_leverage_method_for_new/,"Hey all, I see a lot of talk about making some extra cash and wanted to chime in since I've been earning a good bit over this last year between blogging, Adsense, Amazon, freelance writing and other methods.

At the peak of my online work, I was pulling in about $2k but now it's back down to about $1k (because I'm back in college).

Today, I wanted to share one of the ways I got started that you may find helpful.

*Note: This is a bit of a short-term/long-term method of leveraging your work to scale up your beer money earnings.*

**Step 1: Getting things planned (Overview)**

The first, BIG thing about all of this is to do your planning. The reason why I'm mentioning 'leverage' is that your work, from this point out, will ultimately allow you to earn more in the long run while making a bit of money in the short term.

For me, freelance writing is the easiest way to earn a decent amount of income. You can charge $1 an article or go up to $100 (and beyond). At the moment, I generally ask about $30 for 1,000 words (not bad but I do bulk most of the time).

I recommend starting with Hubpages because:

* It gets you in the mode of writing
* You can earn money through Adsense, Hubpages Ads, Ebay and Amazon
* You can leverage it, at a later point, to pull in freelance clients

To get started, I recommend you aim for a goal of 100 articles. Why? Well, you want to add weight to your long-term goal of creating a freelance writing resume. Additionally, that 100 hubs will help you understand your style of writing, educate you in doing SEO work to optimize your articles and earn you a bit of money while they're sitting on the site.

In this 100 articles, take a look around you - right now - and see what you could write about.

Personally, I love writing about hobby related things because others are always interest in starting one. Likewise, you probably have a lot of items you could review such as you computer, speakers, printer, albums, etc.

From there, dig through the net to find ways of pulling up ideas for articles. While you're at it, learn a bit about SEO and optimizing your articles so they rank well in search engines.

*Bonus: If you decide to write about hobbies/items you own - you can easily include links to Amazon, Ebay and other places which earn you more money - people love reviews.*

You can sign up at Hubpages below:

My Referral: [http://hubpages.com/_1000Hub/tour/hubpages/](http://hubpages.com/_1000Hub/tour/hubpages/)
Non Referral: [http://hubpages.com/](http://hubpages.com/)

**Step 2: Getting Started**

As I've mentioned, reviews, tutorials, lists and the general type of articles you read every day are always winners in the long run. The goal is to create hubs that not only get you traffic (used for later purposes in your resume) but also earn you more income.

If I was starting over, from scratch, here's what I'd do:

* Write out a list of 100 articles I'd like to write
* Create a weekly planner of when (and how many) articles I'll write
* Ensure each article is optimized and hooks readers
* Find ways to interlink the articles (ex. Laptop Review -&gt; Mouse Review)
* Go back through, quarterly, to improve your articles

The key, here, is to simply start writing. Believe me, you don't need to be an expert - if you've ever wrote a research paper or essay for class than you've got everything you need. Use your knowledge of finding info online to help in writing articles or simply write from your own perspective (when doing reviews and such).

**Step 3: Leverage Time**

Now you're in the long-term part of this thing.

As you're getting closer to your 100 article mark, it's time to think of how you can up your ante and earn more from your writing. By this time, you're getting pretty proficient at writing which goes a LONG way in earning you good money online (speed means a lot).

Take some time to put together a freelance writing resume.

It's easier than you think. The key, here, is to list your accomplishments rather than just where you've wrote.

For example: I have a blog that pulls in 40k visitors a month. Rather than saying ""yeah, this is my blog"", I specifically say, on my resume ""Achieved 40,000 visitors a month through blogging - link"". People that read your resume will flip out because that's a MAJOR accomplishment.

In Hubpages, you can track your traffic so take full advantage of sharing that with potential clients.

Additionally, having that account is perfect to link to in your resume. People can go, check out your writing and base their decision off that rather than taking your word for it on your resume.

You can find freelance writing leads:

* Problogger Job Board
* Craigslist
* Relevant blogs for the type of content you create
* Word-of-mouth

You don't need to spam people but get your resume out there. In a week, I landed 3 new clients for a good amount of work because I took an hour of my time to send them a resume, samples and talked to them a bit about the BENEFITS of working with me.

**Conclusion**

I've got to jump back into some work but I hope you find this helpful for the long-term.

It'll take a bit of time to get started but it's totally worth it if you do. Freelance writing, IMO, is easily one of the best ways to earn some extra money because people are ALWAYS looking for content for their site - especially when they're really busy.

I'd appreciate if you used my referral link (you don't have to if you don't want) because I'm also making a goal of writing 1,000 hubs this year. I also run the site Murlu.com if you need any other tutorials on writing (shameless plug, meh) but if you have any other questions, let me know!

Not sure if a lot of you know about it already and I'm behind the bandwagon, but it's a service that offers **5 cents per text message you receive**.

The text messages are advertising offers, but you're not required to follow the offer at all to get the money. Also, the part that looks really appealing is the referral system. You get 3 cents for every text message someone you refer gets. 

The referral system goes 5 levels deep, so someone you refer might eventually be getting you 15 cents at a time after they make a referral.

Make sure to go into ""**Favorites**"" and select options so you start receiving text messages! (Don't select all of them, though)

The payout system is via a card they send you, paid for by your initial earnings.

The website has a decent video explaining it too.

[Non-Ref :(](http://www.tremorgames.com/)

This website is lets you complete tasks/do surveys/download programs for tremorcoins. Currently, tremorcoins CANNOT be redeemed for money. :( However, there are giftcards for stuff like Amazon and Xbox, as well as Steam games and other stuff. 

Optimizing for money: 

On the website, after you click the ""Get Coins!"" button, there are a bunch of different categories of stuff to do. People seem to earn the most from tasks. but I never had any luck with them. My personal scheme is to get a sandbox/virtual machine program (I like Sandboxie), Download a ton of lousy games for coins, then delete the sandbox.

Averaged out, I can probably make $10/hour if I try hard. (I have good internet.) However, there are not too many download offers, so it would be hard to work more than 30 minutes a day. Still, $25/week is more than enough to keep me in steam games and the occasional amazon purchase.

It is like most PTC sites where you watch ads and get paid.  However, unlike all the other PTC sites it has a lot more to offer and even some passive income opportunities.

Auto-Surf is what I do every day.  A new browser window pops up and displays ads automatically.  Using noscript for firefox doesn't seem to effect it either.  So it runs in the background for part of the day and earns me around $0.15 each day, or about $5 a month.

Clicking ads and watching videos is just like all the other PTC sites and you can usually earn around .05 to .20 a day depending on how much you work at it.  Lets say another $3.00 a month.

The twist here is that you can earn extra money by liking things on facebook.  This can earn you a little extra income.  I use my MyVegas profile for this so I don't annoy all my normal friends.  

Finally they also allow you to complete offers much like most GPT sites.  A lot of the offers have to do with other online money making sites which can be nice.  Especially if you were going to upgrade to a paid account at something like clixsense anyways, getting paid to do it just makes it sweeter.

Overall, I make around $10 a month doing very little at this site.  I would encourage you to check it out.

I'm trying to make a **big review** of slicethepie.com, because I didn't find a good one like the ones for Naturebucks or mTurk - all I found was pretty ~~shitty~~ basic information, which didn't help me at all.
Well because of this I had to experience everything concerning this site by myself and now I think I got quite efficient - since I'm making 12-21cts per review!

Well, I'm

* 20 years Old,

* caucasian,

* European with average English Skills,

* and I have nothing to do with music in my rl!

***Getting Started***:

I started of with [this](http://chasmac.hubpages.com/hub/slicethepie-reviews) site, memorizing all the vocabs like **tuneful**, **joyful**, **consistent**, **well-shaped**, **instrumental accompaniments** etc.



Basically I just tried to throw in those words randomly and I worked well for me - but the problem was, that after while it said that my reviews were pretty similar, so I had to do something new. Let me explain it to you




***Taking it to the next level***:

I figured out that the review you're writing can't be too similiar to the last 2 reviews you wrote - I figured this out by testing it approx. 1h, but it was worth it!
I created three [lists](http://i.imgur.com/gDwfGPS.jpg), each contained different words, for example

**1. List**: tuneful vocal melody, slow rhythm, meaningful and               touching lyrics, well-structured, skilled artist

**2. List**: joyful guitar-chords, varied instrumental accompaniments, smooth voice, loving atmosphere

**3. List**: varied digital effects, mixture of soreness and feelings in your voice, great vibe, superb recording quality

Those lists reminded me of what to write to get good money without the algorhythm slowing my work done!




***Keeping the work up***:

Once you hit the high payments you are more likely to drop really fast to normal payment. If you try your best it is easy to maintain the high payment - you just need to get some effort in.
I advise you not to visit the page without being motivated to follow the instructions above, because even 2-3 reviews could basically screw your hard work and the algorhythm seems to work against you!


***Examples***:

**18cts**: Cool slow entrance which fails to accomplish its goal to rise the tension, tho! The melody fits nice to the chilled rhythm and comes great along the instrumental accompaniments &amp; the digital effects! Your voice is very smooth and touches my feeling, the lyrics are very deepish too, but there is nothing original about them, pretty basic for this genre! The vocal melody creates a loving atmosphere! The recording quality and the performance are superb! You seem to be very unexperienced, just keep on working!

***16cts***: Nice neat Intro, instantly brings a joyful atmosphere along with a great melodic rhythm. The voice is crystal-clear and the volume perfectly fits, so the vocal melody accomplishes to rise the tension! The instrumental accompaniments are great, the digital effects are well chosen! The recording quality implicates professionality and the performance quality is high aswell! Very clear structure, great commercial potential! The artist seems to be creative and implicated that he has a big variety of voice-tones, cheers!

What's the fairest way I can do this.,32,13,40,http://www.reddit.com/r/beermoney/comments/1978nt/i_want_to_give_you_guys_beer_money_for_promoting/,"HEY, READ THIS FIRST: I fully intend on following through, but this is ONLY to gather some information right now. So don't send me your info yet.

Hey r/beermoney! I'm trying to build up a Facebook following for my new website, www.neverendingstuff.com. I've been running Facebook ads, but I'd rather give the money to you guys (screw the man!). There's two ways I've been thinking to do this.

1. Liking my page: So far I've been paying, on average, about $.30 per like through FB ads. I'd like to save money by doing this, so I'm thinking giving you guys $.25 per like. I need real FB people, with real friends, and I need a way for you to prove that to me. The easiest way I can think of doing this is by you PMing me your profile. If you have other ideas, please share.

2. Sharing my posts or my site: I obviously want all of your friends to see my site, and the best way for that to happen is for you to share it. I'm thinking I could give $.50 if you do a like/share combo. Same stipulations as #1.

I'm not made of money and am operating on a budget, so I can only give you guys so much. Is this something you guys would be interested in? Do the prices seem fair? Is that way too personal of information to give a stranger? Can you think of a better way where I can pay you guys to promote?

**edit** Thanks for the responses everyone, lots of great feedback! I still need to do a bit more research on this to make sure it's kosher, but I think I'm gonna try to do something with Mturk and post the link to you guys on /r/beermoney and /r/HITsWorthTurkingFor.

So, it looks like that's the reason for the ads being unavailable for a lot of people, and why they were able to up the reward to $1.00 a piece. It looks like people that are registered can still cash out though. So, if anybody would be so kind to use my referral link and bump me above the $10 mark, that would be appreciated.

The sites are [Predicto](http://www.predicto.com), [GuessSMS](http://www.guesssms.com), and [TVTxtr](http://www.tvtxtr.com). All three are run by the same company and are extremely similar.

With relatively little time put it, I've made $40 from these three over the course of a few months with very inconsistent use. I'm also quite close to another $20. You answer pop culture and news questions like ""With the Taliban saying it will kill or kidnap him, will Prince Harry return from Afghanistan by 9/25?"" . Get it right and earn 20 points. Get it wrong and get 5 points. 

Some points of interest:

* At 1000 points you can cash out for $10 gift cards to **Amazon, Wal-Mart, etc**.

* You can cash out larger amounts, but the the point to dollar ration doesn't change. 

* Each question requires a captcha to be solved. 

* Because of the time limits on the questions, the correct answer is typically no. Even if it seems like something is likely to happen, it isn't typically likely to happen by the date given.

* I have very little knowledge of pop culture and still get close to 90% accuracy. 

* They add a question or two daily for the most part, though you can just check in and do them once every week without missing many as the time frame for each is generally anywhere from a couple weeks to a month from it's posted. 

* Predicto seems to have more questions than the other two, but all three are worth it. I generally just go answer them while I'm waiting for a video to buffer or something.

* Most of you will be pleased to know **there is not a referral system**.

* They encourage some phone/texting based version, but it's unnecessary.

*Here are some of the perks to the site:*

**Short Surveys:** I’ve never spent more than 5 minutes answering a survey.

**Cash payment:** The site doesn’t offer redeemable points or gift cards or any of that nonsense – you’re paid in cash. Demographic surveys are sent out most every day, and sometimes more often, and reward you with 10 cents (these are on top of the actual surveys that pay much more).

**No disqualifications:** The best, and I do mean best, part of this site is that you NEVER spend any additional time trying to qualify for surveys only to have them kicked out in the end without any payment. This doesn’t happen with this site. 

Payments are made by PayPal and the minimum cash-out amount is $15.

Plus the site is pretty and minimalistic. 

TIPS: Check the site daily, and often. PaidViewPoint doesn't do a very good job at sending out emails when new surveys or demographic surveys are available. 

Also, make sure your phone number is accurate (or at least usable). To cash out you MUST confirm a telephone number, so don't make this number up during registration. A Google Voice number will work.

Topline is a browser plugin that works similarly to other adblock plugins but instead of blocking ads it replaces them with ads from the Topline network. You are rewarded with points everytime an ad is replaced with a Topline one. Points can then be traded in for Paypal cash. [Here is what it looks like in action](http://i.imgur.com/ii0qV.jpg).

The rate for trade in is currently 1000 points to $0.75 but the developers have said that this is likely to increase as they attract better ads and increase their bargaining power. You can check the current trade in value on the [ticker](https://www.jointopline.com/ticker). So far I seem to be getting between 100-200 points a day. Which is $4 or so a month, which isn't bad given it's totally passive income.

**Tips:**

Here are a few things I have discovered myself and what I have learned from contacting one of the devs, Ronald Bell:

 - If you try to use the same account on two machines at once it cuts your earning rate by 50% for each machine. It sounds like this will kick in if you are signed into two machines at once so if you alternate between two computers its still a good idea to install and use it on both.

 - After some testing it appears that pages with 3-4 ads pay out more points than a page with one - though it is hard to be sure, sometimes it seems to vary.

 - Refreshing a single page or going back and forward between two pages doesn't seem to pay out points. Cycling through 10 or so does seem to. I'm not sure exactly how this works.

 - Ads replaced include: Adsense, some Amazon ads, Facebook  (it also inserts an ad above the timeline, which is kind of neat) and some ads from other networks. A lot of the more dodgy ad networks don't seem to be replaced yet. Chitika ads aren't replaced yet.

 - Synergizes nicely with Swagbucks and similar programs where you are browsing around a lot.

 - I earn really quickly when I am working on revenue sharing sites because I am often clicking around between pages with around 3 ads very quickly while editing. For reference I write on InfoBarrel, an Adsense revenue sharing site ([referral](http://www.infobarrel.com/signup.php?ref_id=634490) | [non-referral](http://www.infobarrel.com/)).

 - If you work with Adsense Topline is excellent - it prevents you from accidentally clicking your own ads and as a publisher you shouldn't really be clicking ads ever. PLus you see more ads than the average surfer.

 - Stumbleupon doesn't work if you use the SU frame at the top as javascript will only run on the parent frame. I'm going to look into running SU without the frame and see how well that works.

 - Disable Topline when visiting sites you would like to support (if your not an adsense publisher). A lot of people try to scratch out a living or pay for hosting by making content and getting a few dollars from Adsense ads - support them if you like their work. At the moment the disable feature is a time disable but the devs promise to add a website exclusion list soon (Topline is still in Beta). 

If you have any more questions feel free to ask and I'll answer them as best I can!

PS. Let me know if you sign up under me, there currently isn't a referral page to check though Ronald Bell said they would be adding one soon.

Edit: I did a write up tailored more towards Adsense publishers. [Check it out if you are an Adsense publisher interested in using Topline](http://www.infobarrel.com/Adsense_Publishers_Stop_Yourself_from_Accidentally_Clicking_Ads_and_Earn_a_Few_Extra_Dollars_a_Month_Using_Topline).

Slice the pie has you listen to a song for at least 90 seconds, during that time you will simply be writing down your opinion of the song and after the 90 seconds you can rate the song and submit your review. payment for me has been at least .15 per song up to almost .30 with a not too lengthy review(short paragraphs). I've learned to go out of my way to drop a music term every now and then to make me sound like I know what I am talking about. Not sure what conditions/standards they have for the reviews but they do review the reviews so keep that in mind before blindly bs-ing your way through it. Pay out is at $10(paypal) but its not impossible to reach. Easy was to kill time and you might find new music  you enjoy. though sometimes they dont tell you the artist or song name so I usually have my ipod next to me with shazam ready to go in case I am interested.

I saw a thread a little while ago about various ways we can improve this subreddit to get more subscribers, while it may seem like a no-brainer, a subreddit gets lots of subscribers when it has lots of valuable content. So after a slight influx of rage when reading incorrectly calling a scammy site a pyramid scheme, I realized that most people don't know how to identify a scam. While in that instance they were correct in it being a scam, just not the proper term for the scam, sure you can say that it is all logistics and a scam is a scam regardless of what you call it, knowing what exactly makes something a scam or have a high risk of being a scam can be valuable, and could save your financial life one day (some people lose horrible amounts of money they can't afford to lose to some higher-level scams, see: Madoff's victims).

If you'd like something added into this thread, just comment, I don't pretend that I know about every type of scam, so if have something to contribute, don't hesitate. 

**Common**

* **The Pyramid Scheme**
&gt; A pyramid scheme in short is a business that operates on multiple levels, and forms a structure that looks like a pyramid. This does NOT however mean that any business that has a corporate structure of a pyramid, is a pyramid scheme. In fact, by most people's standards, Starbucks, McDonalds, Verizon Wireless, Taco Bell, T-Mobile, Bally Total Fitness, and 7-Eleven are pyramid schemes. The list doesn't come close to ending there. What would define something as a ""pyramid scheme"" vs a franchises is determined by a few simple things.   A pyramid scheme typically has an unsustainable business model. This is what I believe to be the core difference. Let's use an example, Taco bell sells food. It is fast, fairly inexpensive, tastes pretty good, and you got it from a brick and mortar shop. If you wanted to and have the money, you could own your own Taco Bell and sell their product so you can hopefully make money. Now let's direct our attention to a relatively new ""MLM"" called iWoWwe, they essentially provide the exact same service Skype and ooVoo do, but they charge $20.00/month after a one time $59.99 start-up fee. You can get rich by recruiting other people to sell this paid service (that you can get for free/cheap from other, much more reputable outlets). It appears that the only way to actually use the product is to sign up to become a referrer so you can ""get rich"". So as you can see, iWoWwe has a very bad business model. Their ""product"" is actually the referral network system (since their actual product is garbage and can be had for free elsewhere), when you buy their ""service"" you get the ability to refer other people, but since the service is garbage, you are actually marketing the referral network. Eventually, a point will come where the people on bottom can't find anybody to refer, so they will stop paying the $20.00/month (since they don't use the product they pay for and are just giving money away) and cancel their service, which in turn will make their upline stop paying the $20.00/month, and that cycle will continue  until everybody is gone.

* **The Ponzi Scheme**
&gt;Ponzi schemes are similar to a pyramid scheme, but a bit different. In short, Ponzi schemes simply require a person (you) to send money/give money to a person, then in one way or another, they will return the money + extra to you (except this is done with many many people). The way the subjects are found vary greatly from ponzi to another, and the way the money is ""made"" for you can also vary. One example that is showing up online a lot lately are HYIPs, or High-Yield Investment Plans, I'll give a vague example of how these work. You and 10 other people put $100 into a HYIP that offers 2% ROI daily. Tomorrow, 10 more people put $100 into the program, from each of their $100, $2 goes to each of the people from the day before, this continues on and on until people are no longer getting any returns and people lose their money and no new people join. Often, a HYIP will offer some kind of incentive for you to refer new people (you might get a better interest rate or something), to speed/preseve the supply of new people, but this is just to do that and the referral side of it does not have the emphasis (usually). 

* **419s (AKA Nigerian Prince)**
&gt;While this one should be painfully obvious (and if you don't find it obvious, immediately call 911), you may receive emails from someone proclaiming to be a person of high stature in another country (typically Nigeria). They tell you that they need you to send some money via bankwire/WU/etc to pay the taxes/bail/servicing fee/etc and in return they will send you 10% of the $50,000,000 in their bank account. These are scams 100% of the time.

* **MLMs**
&gt;I'm going to make a statement here that some of you may disagree with. MLMs are not scams. Amway is not a scam, the pampered chef is not a scam, herbalife is not a scam. Now for the explanation, being a independent business owner (IBO), is running a business. If you lack the knowledge/skills for running a business, then you should not attempt to run a business. That is not to say that the recruiters (other IBO who wants you to join) will tell you that though. Many recruiters will tell people that ""anybody can do it"", this is not true. If you don't think you are a business minded person, and have no experience in the business world, than a MLM isn't for you. It should be noted that many MLMs are actually pyramid schemes in disguise, as stated in the pyramid scheme section, if the business does not have a sustainable business model and focuses on recruiting, as opposed to the distribution of their product that has a demand, it is likely a pyramid scheme.

**[Swagbucks](http://www.swagbucks.com/refer/DrKickflip13)**

Swagbucks lets you earn money by doing offers, surveys, etc.  The main thing we're interested in is Swag TV.  You get points just for watching videos, and this can be automated with the bots.

**Superpoints**

Superpoints is similar to swagbucks with the TV, surveys, offers and such, but they add a ""Super Lucky Button"" that you can click and sometimes win.  This can also be automated with a bot.

Superpoints is referral only, and it's one link per user.  I'll keep my list updated and remove the used codes as necessary, but you can also check the comments out to help out other redditors as well.  If there are no working links here or in the comments feel free to PM me and I'll send you one.

BOTS

Here's the link with all the bots [http://ezswag.com/](http://ezswag.com/)

Try to do the Swagbucks Poll and NOSO under Dailys as well as type the Swagbucks promo code for easy daily points.  On to the automated bots...

Under ezBots you'll see the following:

SuperPoints: Run this to click through your daily clicks on the super lucky button.  You can combine this with the auto refresher (see below) set at 4 or 5 seconds and fly through your daily clicks without waiting the default minute+

SuperPoints Videos: *CODE IS BEING UPDATED, they changed the format of the videos.  Just be patient it will be working again soon* A little tricky to get set up, but follow the instructions and let it run and rack up points

Swagbucks SBTV: Just click the link and let it rack up points.  An alternative is to use an auto-refresher such as the Chrome Extension [chrome-reload](http://code.google.com/p/chrome-reload/) &lt;- set the reload time to 35 seconds (or more)

Swagbucks Search: *EDIT* USE WITH CAUTION, THIS CAN GET YOU BANNED Searches a random word on Swagbuck's search engine, click this a few times until you win the prize (usually 2-3 times) then it won't let you win again for several hours.

Swagbucks Search (manual): Same as above but with words you type in manually.  Far less suspicious and less risk of getting banned.",,False,,t5_2s5or,True,,,True,t3_nzjks,http://www.reddit.com/r/beermoney/comments/nzjks/swagbucks_superpoints_bots_easy_amazon_giftcards/,

For those of you that don't know what SliceThePie is: 
 
&gt;Slice The Pie has you write a review over 90 seconds on a song and gives you about 20 cents per review. Let's do the math. 20cents per 1.5minutes -&gt; $1 per 7.5 minutes -&gt; $8 per hour. Now don't get too excited as you might take a little longer to do a review and count in load times (a few seconds over and over add up). There is an energy limit of 10 and each review uses 1 energy. You automatically get more energy every 3 minutes. With each review taking roughly 90 seconds this means you can do 15 reviews before having to wait a little bit to do some more. So you can get around $3 at a time, wait a half hour and do another $3 session. It's one of the fastest methods out there except maybe Mturk (and even then it still depends). It pays out on PayPal and can be cashed out at $10+. The high-ish cash out point isn't a big deal as you can easily hit $10 even in 1 day if you want to.

Videos only pay $0.01 to $0.03 which is why I hadn't been regularly doing them. However, I may give it a try again with this new way of doing it ... and I'll obviously want to turn off my sound!!  ;0)

Now, I never ended up doing that, because it was too much hassle. But the good folks at Fusion Cash didn't like just the fact that I seemed to suggest that it was ok. Which I didn't ...

They have a point system, 100 being a dollar and so on. I'll not go into offers because you probably know about them already. PR mainly has research surveys and email sign-ups.

   The prizes you can claim include Amazon gift cards, Steam wallets, and more. You can even make a custom order if you don't see what you want, the mods are really helpful.


The reason I like PR so much is the raffles and contests. You get a ticket every time you complete an offer that go towards the raffles. They have a monthly jackpot where the prize money is usually $20 per person, weekly raffles of really cool prizes, and even more. Here's a [link](http://www.prizerebel.com/raffles.php) to the raffles to give you an idea.

The contests are really nice too. They have a top referrer of the month contest where 1st gets $50, a top offer completer contest where 1st place also gets $50, and much more. It's *really* easy to place in at least one of these, and pretty fun too.

They also have a forum full of friendly and helpful people, where you can request an item/feature or just get help with referring. Everyone is really cool.

It's called You Never Lose/ Youneverlose.com and it's essentially a penny auction website where giftcards get auctioned off for pennies on the dollar. Most pennny auction websites charge you per bid which, unless you know what you're doing, often times ends up losing you money. But at you never lose it works differently, the bids are free! Well sort of, bids cost a dollar each- but you get that dollar back in a giftcard. For example, I signed up on the website and bought a $25 sears giftcard for $25 dollars and the site also gave me 25 free bids to use on their penny auction- and I ended up winning a $15 itunes giftcard for $0.25. So that's $40 in giftcards for only $25... and I ended up selling both the giftcards on ebay for about $40.
It's a little confusing to understand the process at first, but [THIS] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&amp;v=AD-ns9Jq5fw) video will explain it much better.

You basically go to the offers page and click to sign up. From there you get taken to a site to sign up for a free 14 day trial, but you must be a new user. Its located [here](http://www.swagbucks.com/p/special-offers) Just scroll down the list until you see RealPlayer SuperPass worth 495 points.

I did this and got my 495 points almost right away. From the terms of the offer: **You may cancel your membership at any time** (which I did) by cancelling it on the same day. You do NOT need to call to cancel, I just cancelled online on the account section of SuperPass (which takes seconds to do).

Unlike some other offers where Swagbucks says something like: Please note: If you cancel your order, your Swag Bucks may be revoked. This one **does not** have any such limitation.

Its an easy 495 points, which can net you a $5 Amazon gift card(450 points) or 5 points away from any of the other $5 gift cards. Very simple to get 5 extra points (Do the NOSO, Daily Poll, watch ten videos on Swagbucks TV and that's 6 points total right there).

I don't have extensive experience with it but I did a mobile poll and a local poll and earned $20.00 in about ten minutes.

The mobile poll was pretty standard - anonymous demographic information and questions about where I shop and what I buy for food.  It earned $5.00.

The local poll was more interesting/involved.  The app tracks where you are and finds businesses near you that need information or that they need information about.  I happened to be in Safeway and started the app.  They had a survey worth $15.00.  In it I had to scan barcodes of frozen food items and answer questions about them (if they were on sale, whether I'd definitely or just normally or not normally buy them, what I was buying them for, etc.).  I had to scan five items.

WARNING it did require that I purchase one of the food items and submit a copy of my receipt (a picture taken from within the app).  I bought a $0.99 burrito.

I found this subreddit about a month ago. Being a college student, any chance to make extra cash was welcome. I jumped into it immediately and have used most of the sites people post about regularly. I didn't stick with all of them, but I am doing pretty well for myself with the ones I use.

**Amazon Mechanical Turk:** https://www.mturk.com/

This has been my main moneymaker. Using /r/Hitsworthturkingfor I've managed to make $117 without too much effort. It's been a boon as I can continue to do this when classes start back up, and I've been able to funnel some of the funds into other endeavors.

My main strategy is to browse HWTF and once those are done to search for 16 cent or more HITS that I'm qualified for. If I'm really bored I'll do repeatable CrowdSource HITS. Overall, the site has treated me well and I've been having fun with it.

**Appredeem**:

An iPod/Droid app that is a small amount of money but it is very little work so I keep with it. My strategy is to only watch the new trailers that are worth 10+ points, and to download the apps in my spare time while watching TV. I also do the daily scratch and this allows me to average 5 to 10 cents a day with almost no real time investment. If you haven't tried it yet and feel generous my referral name is BouncingYeti. Overall, I've made about 6 dollars from it.

**Neobux** [Ref](http://www.neobux.com/m/v/?rh=426F756E63696E6759657469) [non-ref](http://www.neobux.com)

This site is very intriguing. Basically you get paid to click ads. You also get paid for the ads your referrals click. You can rent referrals for a fee which is where the big money comes from. It's much like investing except you need to click ads every day, which takes about 5 minutes max. I funneled $40 of Mturk money into it, so I have 200 referrals currently. They make me about 10 to 20 cents of profit a day, depending on how active they are.

I'm probably going to rent another 50 or 100 referrals when I get $20 from Mturk, then before upgrading to Golden I will try to extend them for 90 or 150 days to get the big discount. It's slow, but I treat it like a game and it seems like it could be quite lucrative in the long term. I have not yet realized profit, but like I said, I treat it as an investment.

One note: I found that my referral average dropped randomly when I stopped doing Adprize clicks. When I started again, they picked up. That might just be me tinfoil hatting though.

**Slicethepie** [ref](http://www.slicethepie.com/?wyd=451738) [non-ref](http://www.slicethepie.com/)

This site is not the best money maker, but it's fun, which is why I like it. Basically, you listen to music and review it. In exchange you get paid between 5 and 25 cents, based on how high quality their script thinks the review is. Commenting on the whole of the song and using specific musical terms (melody, percussion, tone, mood, syncopation, etc.) as well as using specific instrument names seems to help get better pay. In the week I've used it I've made just over $2. Cash out is at $10.

**Topline**: [ref](https://www.jointopline.com/?fid=MTJ3JZH3BS7T) [non-ref](http://www.jointopline.com)

Topline is entirely passive. What it does is replace advertisements on websites and gives you a point for each page with an ad you visit. 1000 points is worth 75 cents (subject to change). I've accrued just over 4700 points in 2 months. You can cash out at $10 so with moderate browsing you can cash out twice a year. It might not seem like much, but for literally no work I will take $20 a year.

**Bing Rewards** [Ref](http://go.microsoft.com/?linkid=9778718&amp;rrid=_7c4a93aa-ebc5-34e0-fa04-7d08757be871) [non-ref](http://www.bing.com)

Essentially, Microsoft will pay you to use Bing. I prefer Google, but you can easily make $5 a month in Amazon credit by using Bing. You can get 3 or so points a day doing featured searches, then 1 point per 2 searches (up to 15 points a day). Points are worth roughly a cent a piece (a bit more if you get gold status, which is easy). I see no reason not to at least use Bing for the rewards. There are ways to get the rewards while still getting the Google search results, but that seems a bit sketchy to me, so I avoid it.

**Superpoints**: [Ref](http://superpoints.com/refer/tportersj) [non-ref](http://www.superpoints.com)

Superpoints is a very simple site. Click the superlucky button to get points Trade the points in for Amazon gift cards. There are other things to do on the site but I have not bothered with them because I prefer to not invest much time (plus I can make more for the time on Mturk then doing offers on superpoints.) The main point of this site is the referrals. Once you get 2 referrals and fill out basic profile info you earn all the points your referrals do, making this a passive money maker. I've not earned enough points to cashout yet, but that's probably due to the fact that I have no referrals.

**Gifthulk** [Ref](http://www.gifthulk.com/refer/tj_porter_16) [Non-ref](http://www.gifthulk.com)

I use this site in a similar way to Superpoints. Click the treasure box to get points.  You can also get points through GiftHulk TV, which is basically watching Youtube videos for points. I do this while doing other things on my computer, like browsing the internet or using Mturk.

Overall I've made about $130 in a month from beermoney, which is great for the amount of work I've put in. The main attraction in my eyes is that I can keep this up during classes which means I'll have some spare cash to have some fun with my friends.

Topline is a fairly young start-up and has been good about interacting with and listening to our beermoney community.

I'm not here to promote it for financial reasons, but if you're looking for some extra cash or beer money, you should check it out.
I've earned around $750 in about the 7 months I've been signed up and will continue to earn money. Here's previous cash payments which I've received.

One of my first checks **(PROOF)** --http://i.imgur.com/Gseh4.jpg

They support PayPal as well! **(PROOF)** --http://imgur.com/Xsgqa

You've all heard about the sites that pay you to pay surveys and this is the best one that I've come across so far. I've also tried cash crate, but this one seems to be a little more fun :)

Here's some tips to maximize your profits from the site.

* Get a Chrome extension called Last Pass. It automatically will fill out your information so you don't have to waste time typing it all out. This saves **SOO** much time when filling to surveys. Google Autofill also works well.
* Fill out the free surveys with cash rewards. These are the ones that take the least time to complete and add up quickly. They range anywhere from .25-1.00 per survey. With the auto fill extension, these take a couple minutes at most.

* Make sure you use an **alternate email address**. You will get spammed like crazy. I would recommend Gmail because of the Google Voice feature. You can sign up for a free phone number in replacement of your actual phone number. This comes in handy for offers that require a phone number to prevent your phone from being called by telemarketers. If you connect it to your cell phone, make sure to to have it go directly to voicemail so you're not receiving calls from anonymous #s.

* Whenever logging off Treasure Trooper, make sure to **clear your cookies and cache**. This will speed up the approval process because the offers tend to overwrite each other for whatever reason.

* Overall, I haven't been spammed like crazy at my home address. I get a couple pieces of junk mail now and then, but nothing crazy. 

* Make sure to collect pearls after you complete a survey. Once you have 8, you can earn free referrals. 

So those are the tips that I've used to accumulate my earnings so far. If you have any tips, please comment, I'd love to see them! Everyone looking for some extra cash, should consider this site. I spend about 2-5 hours a week and earn $100 a month on average.

1343668823.0,20,self.beermoney,xeeme,In Depth SliceThePie Review,23,3,23,http://www.reddit.com/r/beermoney/comments/xeeme/in_depth_slicethepie_review/,"I signed up for [SliceThePie](http://www.slicethepie.com/?wyd=455336) ([nonref](http://www.slicethepie.com)) on July 20th. In 5 days I had built up the $10 required to withdraw. It took an additional 5 days for the payment to be processed. ([Paypal screenshot](http://i.imgur.com/0WjMj.jpg)) I've compiled some thoughts to help people decide whether or not to sign up for SliceThePie, and to help them maximize their earnings if they do.

First, a warning: **Either use your real birthday when you sign up, or write down what fake birthday you use. You will need it to withdraw money!**

STP is unlike mTurk in that you cannot pump out mindless work to generate reliable money. Significant earnings only come from quality work. Furthermore, the quality of work they want is sometimes hard to pinpoint. I've heard of people getting banned from submitting too many low-quality reviews. **Use STP at your own risk!**

I think the key to being successful on STP is to enjoy what you're doing. That way, if you do end up getting banned or fail to meet the $10 minimum, you won't have totally wasted your time. I also feel like people who really enjoy music are more likely to write good reviews.

Aside from getting banned, you may run into the roadblock of ""There are no more suitable tracks for you to review, please check back later"". I cannot say for sure, but I think there are a few limits the site puts on the number of tracks you can review. When I've submitted lower quality reviews this comes up more often.

Reviews also seem to be checked by their human staff regularly, and there seems to be a limit to the number you can write without being checked. For instance, I run into this error on the weekends and in the evenings a lot more often (when there probably aren't staff checking reviews). This fact also explains the long payment processing time (which they do, to be fair, warn you of).

Not everyone seems to have been given the choice, but if you do, choose as many genres to listen to as possible. (You will *not* get a chance to change this.) This might help mitigate ""no more suitable tracks"" errors as well.

Some additional tips:
  
* If you want to listen to a song again, click the ""Scout"" link into a new tab and it'll replay  

* Avoid ratings of 1-3 or 8-10 most of the time. Your accuracy, and therefor rating, and therefor pay, is based on how closely you rate to the average reviewer.  

* Stick to your guns if you get a ""rating significantly different than review"" message. I've seen my user rating increase after I've refused to alter my rating despite this message.  

* Here are some song aspects I try to include in all reviews:

	* Introduction

	* Arrangement (how the song seems broken up into sections, or how it doesn't)

	* Pace vs Length

	* Volume (how balanced the tracks are with each other)

	* Emotion (how originally/uniquely the tracks are performed)

	* Skill (how well/accurately the tracks are performed)

	* The genre of the piece

	* How popular I think the piece would be

	* Particular instruments I hear and how well they work

	* Variety (does it seem like just the same thing over and over?)

* Try not to use the same word choice in every review. They should not be in the same format every time. (for example, every review reading like ""A was X. I liked that B was Y, but C was Z. The Q was very nice."")


[Here is a spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0AuhF7uY1gqPjdHdXSUxWenN5cUh5NmVZXzhSQnp6NXc) of my earnings as well as a few example reviews. Note there was a low point of earnings for a while. I don't really know why it happened. I pushed through and must have figured something out or my rating got better, because my pay jumped up again. I've heard this happen to others as well.

There's kind of a ""meh"" referral system (10%, one tier only), but it's there. 

**TL;DR: It's worth it if you enjoy it, probably not if you don't. Proceed at your own risk!**

I couldn't be more pleased with this discovery! As a college student with a very demanding class schedule and no transportation of my own, I have been struggling to find ways to make just enough money to get through the days. Thanks to you guys, I'm fairly certain I've found a fantastic way! Here is some proof of my success and some tips for anyone who is just getting started.

**Mturk**

For those of you who do not know, Mechanical Turk is a service hosted by Amazon. It is pretty much a place where people referred to as *Requesters* can post any type of simple or complex task to be completed by us, the *Workers*. The tasks are referred to as HITs. Payments for these tasks range anywhere from one cent to fifty dollars. The key to making good money on this website is finding the HITs that are actually worth doing. In order to find HITs that pay good money in relation to the amount of time they take to complete, you should head over to [/r/HitsWorthTurkingFor](/r/HitsWorthTurkingFor). By visiting that subreddit and spending around a half hour completing tasks each day for 11 days, I have made **$48.94**. You can transfer your earnings to your bank account once you have a minimum of $10, or you can just turn your earnings into Amazon Gift Cards once you have a minimum of $1.

I also recommend that you download and install [Turkopticon](http://turkopticon.differenceengines.com/) which is an add-on that allows you to see how Workers have rated Requesters so you can avoid ones that won't pay or who will be overall unpleasant to deal with.

[Here is a screenshot of my MTurk Dashboard.](http://imgur.com/D0RIw)

[www.mturk.com](https://www.mturk.com/mturk/welcome)


**Swagbucks**

For those of you who do not know, Swagbucks is an AWESOME rewards site. Swagbucks (SB) is the currency that you collect through completing a variety of different daily activities on the website. The list of ways to earn SB includes but is not limited to playing games, answering daily polls, watching Swagbucks TV on your computer, watching Swagbucks TV on your mobile phone, and completing trusted surveys. I joined Swagbucks a few days after I began working on MTurk and I have already racked up enough points to snag a **$5 Amazon Gift Card.** In order to avoid reiterating something that has already been put so nicely, I will direct you to [Badymaru's Swagbucks Tutorial](http://www.reddit.com/r/beermoney/comments/qg2nv/badys_swagbucks_tutorial_and_tips_for_cashing_out/).

You can also post on facebook/twitter/tumbler and do the same thing. I haven't tried that though...

This is actually quite important because in order to acquire Gold and Platinum levels you need to have BASIC level (or above) members under you.  Members with no membership level don't help in that regard.

[See Superpoint's membership level requirements if you are still unfamiliar with them.](http://superpoints.com/members/membership_levels)

And getting to Basic isn't that difficult.  In order to reach basic all you need to do is validate your email and provide some information to the site.

I bring this up as I magically had someone sign up under me last night.  Hurrah, I thought, my second person, I'm on my way to GOLD!  Then I noticed that both people signed up under me had not completed the requirements for basic membership.  Without two (2) Basic level members I'm still stuck at basic myself (rats!).  I knew who one of the people under me was, so I sent them a friendly PM here on reddit.  I have no clue who this second person is, but I am assuming they came from here so maybe they'll see this post and go update their account to basic.

Also, maybe this will get other people who haven't upgraded their superpoint accounts to basic to go and do so as well.  Truly, it really is a nice thing to do, so even if you don't bother with SuperPoints anymore go bump yourself up to Basic if you haven't already.

**You, as a SuperPoints user, also benefit from getting yourself to Basic.**  When you first sign up you only have 5 daily clicks on the Super Lucky Button. By getting your email confirmed and providing some basic information you are given 30 daily clicks.  Then, as you start building your own network and reach Gold you will be given 50 clicks and at Platinum you'll have 100 daily clicks (plus all the winning clicks made by your network will be shared with you, too).  So come on, there's no reason not to make certain your account reaches the Basic level when you join SuperPoints!

tl;dr
CONNOR, IF YOU READ THIS PLEASE GET YOUR SUPERPOINT ACCOUNT TO BASIC!!!! =p

This subreddit quickly dismissed the new site as a waste of time, and many members dropped off.

But I still continued to use it. Even though the points became diluted and referral points became capped, it was still easy to earn paypal and amazon credits simply because the site is so easy to use... you press a giant button and try to win points. There's nothing else to it. You can open multiple tabs and click on multiple 'Super Lucky"" buttons at once to speed up the process. Even at the max membership, where you get 100 presses,  this process can be done in minutes. That's not a lot of time off of your day, it in the long run, you earn money at a fast rate than many of these other sites.

Accumulating points quickly does require you to rely on referrals though, as you earn everything your referrals earn. But I've found that I've been able to make money without referrals (such as when they all dropped after the site made changes).

The main prizes are $5 amazon and $paypal, which are 600 pts and 689 pts respectively. Rewards from the super lucky button do not have stated odds, but you can win pt amounts from 1 point to 100, from my experience.

There's not real strategy over how to earn points on this site. It's not a site where you scheme about strategies to earn, because this site isn't meant to waste your time. Just click and get out.

As a bonus, superpoints will send daily emails with free points. It's usually only one of two points, but it helps you get to your cashout goal earlier. And you just have to click on the link the email.

The guys at superpoints really have this ad-revenue business model down to it's simplest. The don't really bother with 1st-party videos or games. So if you think they're business model sucks and want to play by your own rules, you can have ~~Topline or~~(edit: topline might ban you for repeated views of the same page. good catch wayerboysh) adblock running too!

I think most members were scared off by how long it would take to earn prizes now, but really, if you just set up the buttons in multiple tabs or create a macro to automate it, it super fast and can just be a part of you daily routine.

On iOS the app in the app store is called Bamboo Wallet for some of the ways to earn, and the app syncs with m.junowallet.com for the others. Probably setup this way because of apple restrictions. 

I usually watch a video or two and download 2-3 apps a day. With this I get about $5 a week. Maybe more if I have some downtime. 

They offer cash outs in various gift cards, recently Amazon was added. However, they are one of the few if not only that let you cash out to google play and steam wallet. So get prepared for the steam sale, start now and you could probably get $50ish with spending too much time with it by the time steam winter sale comes around.

If they're a good clicker, you can earn a lot of money off them and keep paying to renew that referral.  It isn't as passive as most sites on beermoney, but if you're willing to spend some time setting it up and then a few minutes a day maintaining, people are making tens of thousands of dollars on this site.

So I decided to create a website explaining the site from the ground up, as well as going into more advanced strategy and offering tools like spreadsheets.

Total cashed out with little effort: $16.78

So I have been lurking on beermoney for a while and have made money here and there, but the quickest way I have made money was with this GPT (get paid to) site.

I have cashed out 4 times, minimum payout is $2 to paypal. Another option is to use your points to get like an amazon gift card or something.

I typically like to do the high offers that net me anything from 75-250 points which pretty much gets me a 10 min cash out. Now I will admit some of the lower offers don't credit sometimes, but I make sure to do a lot. The funny thing is sometimes the offers will credit two days later and I can cash out again. :) 

Overall it feels weird &amp; fun hanging out on this site just doing offers for a little bit a day and the extra cash has helped me jump start my savings :).

It seems like the admins use their personal accounts to pay out sometimes, which I don't mind. Payment is not instant but I usually get it within less than 5 minutes because someone is usually on.

In my album link I have 5 pictures, 4 from paypal (not all of them show good proof so I uploaded a screen cap to from the website). You can compare for yourselves if you don't believe me.

If you still want to check it out it would be cool if you use my referral link.

getting scammed on websites, I was surprised when I saw proof of payments. After reading a few pages, I decided I 

was extremely interested. 


**------------------------**



I work in IT, but sit at a dual monitor computer desk all day. I figured mturk and neobux(once I get enough 

referrals I will be able to actively and efficiently manage them) were the perfect starts.


**------------------------**



I started with **neobux**, but realized that was really slow. Right now I am at 0.51 and will be purchasing my first 

set of referrals in a few days with no investment from myself.


**------------------------**



I then started doing **mturk**, which after having issues finding HITS, I almost completely quit out on until I 

finally made my way into r/hitsworthturkingfor. So far today, I was able to pound out 5x .50 hits, a .30, and a 3.50 

in about 45 minutes. **Don't be afraid to type alot, it's the easiest way.**


**------------------------**



I then signed up for viggle, which failed miserably. I still don't quite understand how to use it. I don't have any 

sort of television at home so I think it won't work for me.

**------------------------**



Apptrailer is amazing. Set up on my droidx2 and constantly watching the same video over and over for 5 points. It 

takes a while, but it's mostly passive and I don't actually watch the videos.


**------------------------**


Signed up for swagbucks today and apparently used a dumb code, because I only got 25 SB for signing up. There is
a summer special code that gives you 75 to begin with. I don't quite have a routine down yet, but apparently NOSO, 

Surveys, and Searches are the way to go.


**------------------------**


Also signed up for surveys through **paidviewpoint** and **pollbuzzer**.



.




**My Setup**


.


Right now I am rocking dual monitors. One monitor I have Mturk splitscreen so I can do only turking on that monitor. 

I will constantly be doing mturking on that monitor throughout the workday. My mturk gains will be deposited into my 

online Ally bank account which is hooked to my Paypal.



On the other monitor, I have swagbucks search opened and try all my work queries on that first, if I can't find the 

information I resort to google. 


.


On the same screen, I have the following**:**


*


A gmail alert that tells me when I have a **paidviewpoint** or **pollbuzzer** survey.


An addon that tells me when I have adds to click on neobux.


The swagbucks toolbar for similar notifications.


All my browsers are running with the **Topline** passive ad replacement addon.


Sitting on my desk in front of me, is my USB charging, apptrailer droidx2, where I am constantly replaying videos 

for points.


All earnings from everything will be funneled into my ally or paypal account, and then channeled into neobux.

Ive been using viggle for a about a month now, and ive gotten over 25 bucks in free Starbucks gift cards for my GF. It was just released for android today or within the last few days. 

Quote from their site: &gt;Check into your favorite TV shows with Viggle and get great rewards such as movie tickets, music, gift cards and much, much more. All just for watching the TV shows you love

Its really easy. You just check in to ANY tv show and earn a point a min.
You can watch a ton of ads, which is where the points are at. But ads are not nearly as passive. 
It cost 7,400 points for a 5$ starbucks GF which i can easily get in a 2 every 3 days. and they pay out instantly.  

They have daily bonuses for checking in to certain shows, like 150-400. so you can get 600 points in an hour in some cases. 

**TIPS**
* You do not need to be near a TV at all. Just fail the Check in twice and type what you want in.

* If its early and nothing is on i always check in to STARZ or some movie channel,so once every 2 hours check in again. 

* ADS. Watch them. If you run out of ads you can sometimes force more. i can watch them for hours straight some times.
to ""force"" more ads if your all out and only have those viggle ones, 
once you watch an ad, click whats on and feature shows again, You should already be in featured shows, 9/10 times it reloads and you can watch it again. once you get a viggle ad go to what people are watching and click each show, sometimes you will get some ads. Click back and click the same show again. Hard to explain but you'll figure it out. 
30 sec videos are the best. 
 
* keep an eye out for special events


They do offer some other gift cards, and ive read online you can turn a bestbuy GC into paypal or amazon, not sure how though

I think there is a 6000 point limit a day.

They just started referals so , here it is

It seems like initially Predicto gets the most questions to answer and Tv Txtr the least but it evens out once you are doing it daily. The only annoying thing is the time it takes to slog through the first big bunch of questions because you have to enter CAPTCHAS and it takes a few seconds for ""processing"" in between questions. 


EDIT: I almost forgot that choosing no to ever question or false or whatever is the best strategy and pans out quite often.


1000 points is a 10 dollar amazon giftcard. There are other ones like Walmart so you could theoretically offset some grocery expenses or what not but its not consistent enough to depend on.


US only, 13 and up(except Florida which requires you to be 18), and they actually physically send you the giftcards so you have to use a real address. It took them 3 weeks to get my giftcards to me.

**Superpoints** - $15 since March 2012

Seriously, the hardest thing you have to do is push a button.  Once you put in the effort to get enough referrals, you don't even have to push the button any more!

I can't stress this enough though.  **Referrals, referrals referrals.**  Without referrals, you are nothing.  Well, not quite, but at only 30 clicks a day of the Superlucky Button, it's going to take you a while to cash out (especially when your threshold for cashing out is 2500 SP.

If you find yourself in a pit of despair about Superpoints, **do not give up.**  Keep trying to get those referrals by posting useful information or helping out newcomers.

**Swagbucks** - $80 since January 25, 2012

Swagbucks, is in my opinion, the easiest of the sites mentioned in this subreddit to make a substantial amount of money on a constant basis, without the *need* (they still help.  I've gotten around 500 Swagbucks from mine so far) for referrals to succeed as much as Superpoints.  

Swagbucks is also my biggest money-maker so far.  All I do is direct my browser to a video on Swagbucks TV, download an auto-refresher for [Firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/reloadevery/), [Chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/aabcgdmkeabbnleenpncegpcngjpnjkc), or [Safari](http://agriffindesign.com/downloads/autorefresh/) (Opera has a built-in auto-refresher, I believe).  Set the timer for 55 seconds and you're golden!

One tip though, try not to max out Swagbucks TV to 150 SB every day, as you are at a much higher risk of having captchas implemented for a couple of weeks if you to.

**Captchas make puppies cry,** so don't do it.

If you do receive captchas, don't fret!  Sure they'll be annoying for ~1-2 weeks, but they will go away eventually.

**Bing Rewards** - $5

Bing Rewards definitely isn't going to make you an instant-millionaire.  However, getting your maximum points for the day takes roughly 35 seconds at max.

The way Bing Rewards works is that you gain additional points by performing bing searches each day.  You can gain 20 points each day through search, with two searches equating to one point.  $5 Amazon gift cards cost 525 points.  In the early signup stages of Bing Rewards, along with daily offers, you can get about 20-35 points a day though.  That's roughly equal to $5-10  a month for 20-30 seconds of your time every morning.  Not bad!

What sucks is it's taken a few months to get to the $15 minimum cash-out. After realizing today that I was over the $15, I went to cash out. In order to do so, you must use the phone you registered with to call or text to verify this. I'm broke, so I go to settings to change my registered number, and send the text and code from my google voice number so that I can go back and cash out. Then I read the line under ""change your number"" and it states that if you do change your number they will zero out your balance. 

Fuck me. Yes I should have read the entire page before submitting that. But I didn't. I just thought I would share this wonderful experience so hopefully you will update your number before you have anything worth cashing-out, or read everything on the page and the ""Terms of Service"".

Although it took forever for a cash out it doesn't take more than 2 minutes when they send a survey (only 10 questions)... So if anybody is up for signing up and helping me get some loot back that would be kick ass!

This means you are missing out on 25 clicks a day. If you complete your basic profile you move from None to Basic. This allows you take surveys, gives you the above mentioned extra 25 clicks a day(up from 5), and also gives you 5 invite tokens. The level chart can be seen [HERE](http://superpoints.com/members/membership_levels).

While Basic is something everyone should have. I would egg you on to obtain gold status. 50 clicks a day and making points when your friend does a survey or clicks the button is what awaits you. The advanced profile does require you to divulge a little more but the picture you upload can be most anything. Getting 2 people isn't too hard and getting them to basic is a matter of coaching. I highly recommend getting two family members who don't even care. Sure they won't be aiding you much in the way of points but you will be able to depend on your 50 clicks a day for points. The best part is, if you get people active from this point you make what they make. While 2 referrals from here and 2 active people would be ideal, you might grit your teeth and convince a couple real life people who you have rapport with to make things easier. Everybody assumes there is a huge catch but I guess that is to be expected. Hopefully this was informative.

The following sites are sites that I have deemed worthy enough to bother sharing. These sites are by no means the quickest way to get rich; they are evaluated in regards to the LEAST amount of work necessary to yield the highest rewards. This guide is an attempt to show my daily routine – what sites are visited and what tasks/assignments/etc. are completed. Since referrals are essentially the easiest and laziest way to earn, I feel it would defeat the spirit of the list to bother including non-referral links. Remove my account name from the URL if you must.  

**Swag Bucks** [Referral Link](http://www.swagbucks.com/refer/AlkaiserMO)

Again, as I am extremely slothful, I find the following Swag Bucks’ activities the only ones worth doing. Other tasks require too much work.

* Swagbucks TV. Extensions and add-ons can be downloaded for both browsers allowing the video to be automatically refreshed at certain time intervals. Be warned: using these automatic refreshers is against their TOS. You can earn 75-150 Swag Bucks a day watching Swagbucks TV.

Firefox’s add-on ReloadEvery: https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/reloadevery/
Chrome’s extension Auto-Reload: http://www.chromeextensions.org/utilities/auto-reload/

* NOSO offers. Click “Start Earning Now” and skip the offers until you are prompted to enter a confirmation CAPTCHA code. Typically, you earn 2 Swag Bucks for this. 

* Daily Poll. Earn 1 Swag Buck by voting in the daily poll. 

* Surveys. Depending on how much you are willing to lie, surveys can be a great way to make additional Swag Bucks. Learn to predict what a survey wants from you, and answer accordingly. I don’t do this because I’m much too honest. 

* Swag Codes. Have a startup swag code spoiler tab that you can easily check a few times a day. For example: Swagcode Spoilers: http://sc-s.com/

**Cash Texts** [Referral Link](http://cashtexts.com/by/AlkarlMO) 

Cash Texts sends you an SMS text message offers by advertisers, for which you are then paid for. Use or create a Google Voice account and use the associated number with Cash Texts if you don’t want these advertisements sent directly  to your phone. There isn’t much else to say about the program rather than they just recently went live, and have a pretty decent 5-tiered referral system. 

**Jingit** [Referral Link](https://www.jingit.com/?ref_id=13236&amp;invite_type=DYNAMIC)

I enjoy Jingit because it demands very little attention. You watch a video, occasionally take a video-related survey consisting of a few short questions, and then get paid at a rather high rate. Users are allowed to make $5/week, and up to $10/week with referrals. Since you can’t tab out or minimize the video, just resize it and watch David Attenborough’s Frozen Planet or something.  

**Varolo** [Referral Link](http://www.varolo.com/user/village/CashForNoodles)

Similar to Jingit, but pays less but has more way more ads. For every advertisement you watch you get entered into a $500 weekly jackpot, which would be pretty cool to win!

**Cash Crate** [Referral Link](http://www.cashcrate.com/504558)

CashCrate has a bajillion offers, so worrying about tasks or assignments isn’t an issue.  Most of the offers pay between 50 cents to $2. Nice referral system too. I believe you get $3 every time your referral first makes it over 10 dollars, and you get something like 20% of their earnings. If you’re 13 or over and speak English, sign up. 

**Fusion Cash** [Referral Link](http://www.fusioncash.net/?ref=AlkarlMO )

Fusion Cash claims to have higher GPT rates than any other site. Seems to be true. But what would I know, I only invented the site. Just kidding, I don't do anything. Their referral rates are rather high -- you can earn a dollar per referral and you also start out with a $5 bonus. And why is the dollar sign before the number unlike percentage or degree? Stupid. Sign up for that site though, it's tight. 

**Cloud Crowd** [Referral Link](http://www.cloudcrowd.com/i/hpopuj)

Cloud Crowd is Facebook application, which means it’s annoying as hell, but still profitable. Try to use an old Facebook account, or create a new one, to separate your silly, money-making needs from your social network. 

Cloud Crowd has various writing and editing assignments that pay rather well, with the opportunity to earn bonuses for exceptional work. The only issue I have with Cloud Crowd is that their certifications are rather difficult to obtain. Once you earn the proper credentials, however, submitted assignments are rarely returned. The rate of pay varies, but you can expect a few bucks for every 250 words or so. 

**Clickworker** [Referral Link](http://www.clickworker.com/become-a-clickworker?utm_source=148880&amp;utm_campaign=CW4CW&amp;utm_medium=email)

Clickworker is one of the few sites that I use that requires more “work.” However, it’s not too tedious for being 100% monotonous, and doesn’t have over the top material requirements that are scrutinized by some pompous asshole editor. 

Essentially, you work on various translating, researching, and data processing jobs. Depending on your skill, speed, practice, concentration, and qualifications, you can earn over $10.00 per hour. It’s simplistic and isn’t overburdened with garbage assignments that bog down other microjob websites. 

**Points2Shop** [Referral Link](http://www.points2shop.com/?ref=AlkaiserMO)

Points2Shop is essentially Swagbucks with a hideous interface; it’s confusing and looks horrible. Despite this, Points2Shop has a few worthwhile attributes:

The USamp Trusted Surveys, Daily Surveys, and Free Offers. The Free Offers on Points2Shop allow you to spin a chance-type lottery wheel that awards Lottery Tickets and drawings for a monthly prize. This is probably the best aspect of Points2Shop -- allowing you the chance to spin the wheel 10 times daily. 

**Superpoints**

Superpoints is similar to other survey-based sites. However, the Superpoints “Lucky” button pushes the site onto my list of GPT websites that require minimal effort. Once you join Superpoints, you have the opportunity to simply click a button to earn points. These points can then be redeemed for gift cards, or whatever. The amount of times you are allowed to click the button depends on your level, which can be increased by such tasks as validating your email, completing a profile, submitting a valid picture, etc. I seriously only use this site to click a button 50 times. 

50 point bonus referral link:

http://superpoints.com/wrpgs/mw94i8

http://superpoints.com/wrpgs/kvl2qj

http://superpoints.com/wrpgs/q8b3sf

Let me know if anyone grabs it so I can take it down. 

**Browser Configuration**
The first step is to pick your ideal browser. Using two browsers makes working online less insufferable and allows you to categorize your sites. Currently, I’m running Chrome for personal use and Firefox for all my “business.” This also allows you to mute your business browser so you don’t have to worry about intolerable advertisement noise.  

The next step is to set up your startup pages on your desired browser:

From Google Chrome’s Tools menu select “Open the following pages:” under the Basics tab. Add addresses based on what programs you’d like opened. 

From Mozilla Firefox's Tools menu, select Options, General, and enter site addresses separated by a pipe, “|” (Shift+\). Sites can be opened in tabs with the ""Use Current Pages"" button. 


My startup list is as follows: 

Swagbucks (TV)
Swagbucks Homepage
Swagcode Spoilers
Cash Texts
Superpoints
Cloud Crowd
Jingit
Points2Shop
Clickworker
Google
Email

So what are you currently using for beer money?
How much are you making per week/month? 
How much time are you spending a day? 
When did you start? 
How much made total? 

I think these questions should be a good start feel free to add you own :) 

So for me im pretty new so my answers aren't that great.
So what are you currently using for beer money?: Superpoints and Opinion Outpost are the main ones im trying while trying out Mturk aswell
How much are you making per week/month?: so far I've made £5 from Opinion Outpost and pending on Superpoints my first $5 cash out. 
How much time are you spending a day?: hour or so max usually
When did you start?: Beginning of last monthish
How much made total?: £5 so far!

Id recommend Superpoints there are plenty of Invite links below ill try to update them :), Opinion Outpost is good but not consistant and im still trying to get used to finding good Mturk's to do.

Whats your suggestions?

Essentially you will earn money by letting their program run on your computer to utilize unused processing power.  Signing up now will earn you a higher tier position and will result in more earnings when the site launches. 

There are no threads to purchase, and your earnings are actually based off of your computer's processing speed and uptime. 

Here is a quote from their main site:

&gt;Our Mission is simple - To purchase unused computer processing power at a fair price, and to package it and sell it at a profit. All profits to be distributed to our owners, which includes all Division Managers. It is our goal to spread the ownership of Idle Processor Utilization Services to as many who wish to invest and work hard. This is not altruism - this is reward for hard work, planning, and execution. To maintain a viable, desirable service at an attractive price, while fairly compensating everyone that is involved.


What I like about this is that they seem very upfront about this project. They have a nice FAQ on the site which covers some issues that I have with other similar programs:

&gt;But XYZ Company pays $1 a day for my (Insert your 20 year old computer name here) - They won't for long. There is no process, legal or otherwise, that makes a Windows XP box with 512k ram worth $1 a day. But, deep down, you already knew this.

Clearly they are referring to DigitalGeneration with this quote. DigitalGeneration seemed enticing, but having a flat rate of $1/day regardless of the computer's processing power seems like a scam waiting to happen. 

Here's another quote: 

&gt;Do you really show your financial statements? - Absolutely yes. We strongly believe our slogan - ""Authenticity and Accountability thru Transparancy"". You are trusting us, so we share everything with you. There will never be a question on where the money is coming from or where it is going.


Overall, if this sounds interesting to you, I have included both a ref/nonref link down below. Even though there's still 11 days until the official launch, if this generates decent profit it will definitely be beneficial to get in on it on the ground floor.

I've been signed up to Great Bridge Group [Ref](https://www.greatbridgegroup.com/?referralCode=oRpB_Q4mq8_8VkdVdBDlMg) | [No Ref](https://www.greatbridgegroup.com/) ($5 bonus for both of us if you use referral link) for about 6 months now and it's by far one of the easiest ways to earn extra money. In exchange for sharing your purchase history they pay you .25% of every purchase. Think of it as turning your 1% cash back credit card into a 1.25% cashback card. You grant access in the same way you would for Mint or Quicken so they can read your data. They anonymously sell the data and net a bit of margin.

They don't collect your name, address, ssn, but I was still a bit sketched out about security at first. I don't linked my checking account only my credit cards which have more protection, but so far I've been paid over $50. Payment is in the form of Paypal transfers, Amazon GCs, or donations to charity and occurs every 90 days. 


From the FAQ
*How does Great Bridge keep me protected?*
We use Yodlee (the back-end provider of aggregation technology for over 200 banks including Bank of America and USAA), to store your username and password and manage any connection to your financial institution. Yodlee already manages the data of over 30 million consumers. We also use bank-level security on our side (SSL and 256-bit encryption). 

*Can my Great Bridge account be used to access my financial accounts?*
No. If someone gained access to your Great Bridge account, they could not access your financial accounts to view your sensitive account information or to move any money.

I haven’t seen this site posted in r/beermoney yet. I’ve been watching my friends for the past two months **cash out $25 every 3-6 days on this site,** so I decided to join and go with the flow. I think you should too. It’s Bubblews. (launched Feb 2012)

[Referral](http://www.bubblews.com/?referral=51af8b89c0c563.36364283)  [non ref](http://www.bubblews.com)  
 I received $1.00 when I joined, just for signing up.

I respectfully request no referral train within this post, as this is the first post in beermoney about bubblews. If I'm not allowed to request this, sorry about that--do whatever is allowed.

**TO EARN:** Write original, short articles of at least 400 characters (NOT words) about practically anything. If you include a picture that isn’t your own, give credit for it. Pictures aren’t required, though. You can submit up to 10 articles a day. I’ve noticed most people submit around five. Follow the rules, and you’ll be earning.

You earn for each UNIQUE view, comment, like/dislike and social media share by others. The bigger your ‘bubble’ becomes, the more attention it will get from others.

The amount paid per action is minimal, but adds up if you make connections with others on the site. **Make sure to connect BACK to those who’ve connected with you.**

You can connect with others by going to their profiles and clicking ‘CONNECT,’ commenting that you connected, and hope they connect back. **Asking someone to connect with you can get you banned.**

**To get others to view/like/comment/share your posts, do that for others.**

**NOTE: Per the TOS,** The license you grant Bubblews of what you post is perpetual and irrevocable. Clearly this is not a place you want to post your best work.

RESTRICTIONS: If you do any of the following and get caught, there's a good chance you won’t receive your next payment, or you might get banned (I haven’t heard of anyone being banned):
 •Plagiarize. You’ll get kicked out.
 •Ask for likes/views/comments/shares by partaking in exchange groups and requesting for them through other Bubblews' members, or by posting for help on social media sites. This also applies to asking people to connect with you. Don’t do it.
 •Utilize Traffic Exchange, Bots, Proxies, Virtual Private Network and other forms of IP manipulation. 
•Submitting posts that only contain pictures and/or containing very limited text is prohibited as this is not content advertisers like to pay for.
 •Posting Pornographic/semi-pornographic images and/or content to Bubblews.
 •Posting LESS THAN 400 characters per post.
 •Posting material not written in English (Only exception is if you supplement your post with an English translation).
 •Posting links within your bubbles to cite/source/enhance your work is fine, but do not post Referral or Affiliate links to other websites. 

**PAYOUT:** Check, Paypal, Visa Debit Card, and something called ""Buy Me This""

**Tl:dr** Bubblews is a fun, quick way to make beermoney. If you write five 400 character original articles a day, make connections (they aren’t social connections, but writing connections), and follow the rules you can cash out $25 every 3-6 days.

"" To Our Community:

For the past three years we have been on an amazing journey together. Yardsellr started as an experiment and grew into a company and a community that weaves buying and selling into the social fabric of the Web. Today we are taking a new direction for our business so I wanted to let you know about the changes we are making.

A few months ago, we began to talk to a few other companies who wanted to borrow our playbook. They wanted to turbo-charge their ecommerce business using the Yardsellr strategies for blending games and social with buying and selling. As we looked at the growth potential and profitability of that business, it became clear that it was a very attractive option. But we knew we couldn't focus on that business -- selling software and services to ecommerce companies large or small -- and on our existing Yardsellr business.

Today we are turning our attention 100% to the ecommerce services business and we will be shutting down Yardsellr. This change is exciting and sad at the same time. The team is excited to tackle a new business but we are also sad to say goodbye to Yardsellr. I know many of you have been through transitions like this in your own work, so I am sure you know how we feel.

Our new business -- which we are calling CompoundM -- will launch in a few weeks. While we get ready for the launch, we will make sure to wind-down Yardsellr the best way possible. If you have bought or sold something, those transactions will all be honored. For more information about the transition see:

It has the potential to net you a good amount of money fairly quickly. I've only been visiting the site for about 4 weeks (and initially, not every day) and my balance is already up to more than $13. Let me tell you something about it.

FusionCash has several different ways to earn money. 

* $5.00 Signup Bonus! 
* The Daily Cash email ($0.02, you need to sign up for it). 
* Paid To Click is a quick $0.15 every day. 
* Daily FC Surveys, which range from $1.00 to $3.00 
* Daily Tasks, range from $0.01 to $0.25 
* Various other Surveys, Offers and Videos 
* Paid To Post (get $3.00 per month for posting 30 times to the forum)
    
Once you've gotten familiar with the various offers, you can Bookmark the ones you like and then you can always start your day from the Bookmarked items. You can also ""hide"" the offers you don't want to bother with, so your Offers page isn't cluttered with offers that you have no intention of ever doing.
    
**Cashout**
    
Cashout amount is $25, but $15 of that must be in completed offers (not bonuses). They pay via PayPal (US and Canada), checks or direct deposit (US only) after the 20th of each month. One thing they require though: offers and bonuses expire if not cashed out within 180 days of being credited. Shouldn't be a problem, but don't forget about it!
    
**Referrals**
    
I don't have any referrals yet (that's why I'm posting this!), but it looks like a decent referral system:

* Refer a friend who confirms his/her email address: $1 bonus 
* Your friend completes his/her first offer: $2 bonus 
* Your friend cashes out: $5 bonus (each and every time they cashout - for life) 
    
**My daily routine:**
  
* The first thing I do every day is click on the Daily Cash email I get. It only pays $0.02, but it only takes a minute and I have to login to the site anyway, so this is a quick way to get there. 
* Then I go the Offers page and my Bookmarked items. 
* First, I do the Paid To Click offer. It only pays $0.15, but it also is pretty quick (about 3 minutes) and painless.  All you have to do is click on four different items in the ""STEP 1: CONTENT"" section, one sponsored ad in the ""STEP2: SPONSERS"" section and then you have to wait for the countdown (from 3 minutes) in ""STEP3: REDEEM"" to complete. Once the 3 minutes are up, there will be two links under the Redeem section. You may have to click the Refresh (and you don't see the second one until you've clicked the first). 
* Next, I'll try a few of the surveys (and sometimes other offers). I always check the FC Surveys first, because they pay from $1 to $3. I like that they tell you how long a survey should take and I won't do one that takes more than 15 minutes (not worth my time and I get bored if they're longer than that). 
  
**Stuff I May Start Doing Regularly**
  
* I've only done the Paid Videos a couple of times, but I just recently became aware of the fact that you can click on all the videos, one after another, without waiting for each one to finish and still get credit for all of them (keep in mind that you do have to let them all finish at some point or you won't get credit). Videos only pay $0.01 to $0.03 which is why I hadn't been regularly doing them. However, I may give it a try again with this new way of doing it ... and I'll obviously want to turn off my sound!!  ;0) 
* There is a Contests &amp; Promotions section in the Forum which I only became aware of today. Every weekend they have a mini-promotion giveaway for answering trivia questions or other simple items. Example right now is a ""survey"" asking what about your New Years Resolution is. They don't pay much (the New Years one is $0.02), but they don't take much time either. And every Tuesday/Wednesday, a sports-related promotion. Other items that will earn you money are things like posting a screenshot of your payout, following FusionCash on Twitter, etc. 
  
**Stuff I Don't Do:**
  
* I've not bothered with the ""Paid To Post"" forum postings that I mentioned at the beginning of this blog post. Too much of a time-waster in my opinion, but some people like forum posting. If you're one of them, then go for it. =0) 
* I also don't do any games for the same reason (time-waster), but I'm also not much into games, other than the Spider Solitaire game on my laptop. =0) 
* The Daily Tasks seem to me to take too much time for what you get paid. Maybe it's just me though, so you may want to take a look at it yourself.

Not only is it easy (and sometimes fun) money but the company is great.  I was doing one of their tests, the website didn't work right, so I emplained what wasn't working in my review.  BetaPunch gave me $5.00 (the max payout per review) in apology, the website fixed the issue and then I was personally invited to come retest.  

Highly recommended.  Here's my [referral link](http://www.betapunch.com/tester/refer/1080) and [non-referral link](http://www.betapunch.com/).

For those of you who don't know what BetaPunch is, it's a service for website owners that sources live end-user testers (us) to evaluate the site or some part of the site/functionality of the site.  Testers use a JS screen recorder to record their use of the site and talk about their impressions.  The maximum record length is 15 minutes.  There is no minimum.  The company rates the review from 1-5 and the user is rewarded $1.00 for each point.

Basically, if you pay attention and do good reviews, at worst you'll earn $5.00 for 15 minutes - $20.00/hour.  I'm averaging $5.00 for each ten minutes - $30.00/hour.

I've found the companies to be very honest in their feedback and I have only received two reviews under 5 points (4 and 3).  I've even been thanked by websites I've trashed and awarded 5 points.

Recently, because I give such consistently good reviews, BetaPunch invited me to two secret reviews reserved only for high quality.  This is valuable to me because I didn't have to go to the site and hope the maximum number of reviewers had been reached - I had an essentially reserved seat.

Finally, BetaPunch has a referral system.  You are rewarded with $1.00 for each review from a person you refer, regardless of the quality of their review.

It's a great program.  Again, here's my [referral link](http://www.betapunch.com/tester/refer/1080) and [non-referral link](http://www.betapunch.com/).",,False,,t5_2s5or,False,,,True,t3_14pbaa,http://www.reddit.com/r/beermoney/comments/14pbaa/betapunch_is_my_favorite_gpt_site_bar_none/,

Draftday is a fantasy-sports website. You can buy-in to games, but I prefer to stick to the free games. In fact, this is how I earned my money.

I got $5 for just signing up, and $5 for referring a friend. Then, I submitted my team to a free game. Fortunately for me, out of 500 people I finished first! I won $40.00.

In case you're worried that you don't know anything about sports, this was my first time ever playing fantasy sports. Don't worry.

So far, here is my list from research:

- Gomez PEER
Read that it'll cost you much more in electricity than the actual pay out. But have also read that it's actually pretty stable once you get around a month. $10 can be a standard, will not slow down your comp.  But is it effective or counter productive? Anyone have experiences with it? Still may consider this one

- Swagbucks
Do not like the surveys, do not like the ""gaming"" atmosphere of coupons. Just my opinion. But can ""Bluestack""  videos capped at 50, in  9 days you can have $5. Run a few videos while browsing, a daily routine? May consider

- Topline
Not high maintenance. But a check here.

- MetaTrader 5
Cannot consider. Reviews lean more to counter productivity.

- BTC Mining
Do not have dedicated CPU's so def. Counter productive. I love the idea of BTCs but this cannot work.

- Vagex
Seems like a lot of work. Will pass, unless if there's a good reason to look again.

- Pollbuzzer
Sort of manual but it sends a poll to your email, have not read anything about actual cash/out rate and it's only once a month.

- Bing Rewards
Searches capped at 15 points a day, bot it? Run like any routine each day and get 2.50 for 250 search? Anyone have experience to share, may consider this one too

I think the most efficient ones can be: Bing search, Gomez, Swagbucks  vids. Have them as a combo.

I'm not a scientist I'm wondering opinions about passive earners and which can slightly be regarded as productive and not counter productive. If anyone tried any of these above or have any suggestions please do share! I just don't like the idea of spending more in electricity bills by leaving a computer on, so which one can be regarded as productive?

[Swagbucks]( http://www.swagbucks.com/refer/fire741cracker) is my most consistent earner, and they pay out to Amazon and Paypal. The $5 Amazon Gift Cards are the best deal, which cost 450 Swagbucks. You earn Swagbucks by:

**Daily Poll** - Each day has a daily poll, earn 1 SB by answering it.

**NOSO** - No Obligation Special Offers are available every day, just click “skip” on 5 or 6 pages to earn 2 SBs.

**Search** - It is possible to win up to 4 times a day from searching, but I usually only try to  win twice. After 2 wins it takes too many searches to win for me to be worth it. Search wins usually give 6-12 SBs, but occasionally pay out much larger amounts. The largest win I personally received was 51 SBs.

**Swagbucks TV** - This is my largest source of Swagbucks, you watch 10 videos and then get 3 SBs. Videos credit after about 40 seconds. I do this while going about my Beermoney routine or watching TV, you want to multitask because just sitting there doing SBTV would be incredibly boring.

**Referrals** - When a referral wins from searching, you get matching Swagbucks. You can earn up to 1000 SB per referral.

**Daily Goal** - If you reach the daily goal, you earn 10% of the daily goal as a bonus at the end of the month. So if the daily goal is 50 Swagbucks and you make it, at the end of the month you will be credited with 5 SBs. Each day has a daily goal, and if you make 7 or more days in a row you will get another bonus for that as well.

When you redeem a gift card, it usually takes 7-8 days to process. The gift card will be emailed to you, so you don’t have to tell Swagbucks your real physical address. Using just the things I outlined above, I easily earn five $5 Amazon Gift Cards a month. If you are interested you can sign up under [my referral link here](http://www.swagbucks.com/refer/fire741cracker), or a [non-ref](http://www.swagbucks.com).

[Topline](https://www.jointopline.com/?fid=67W2PL7TJ55P) is a great passive way to earn money. It is an internet add-on that replaces advertisements with its own, and it pays you for each ad you view. The minimum payout is $10 to Paypal or you can have a physical check mailed to you. Referrals earn you 5% of what they do. This is completely passive, but is a slow earner, with no referrals it took me 2 months to reach $10 and cash out. [Here is my referral link](https://www.jointopline.com/?fid=67W2PL7TJ55P) to sign up, or a [non-ref]( https://www.jointopline.com).

----

[Naturebucks](http://naturebucks.com/members/register.php?ref=fire741cracker) pays you to do very simple tasks like sign up for an email newsletter, watch a video, like a Facebook page or complete other straightforward offers. They usually take around 30 seconds to 2 minutes, and pay anywhere from $0.05 to $1.00. The things I like most about Naturebucks are bolded below.

**Minimum payout of 0.05** to Paypal, or 1.00 for Amazon gift cards.

**Prompt payment** – Payout is instant for Paypal, or takes about 20 minutes for Amazon GCs

**Five tiers of referrals** – Naturebucks gives you 20% of what your referrals make, and it goes down five tiers, each tier earning you a flat 20% rate. So a referral of a referral of a referral of a referral of your referral earns you 20% of what they do.

**Bonus** – If you manage to get to $20.00 (this includes what you get from referrals), Naturebucks gives you an extra $1.00. This is free money, and it is instantly applied to your account. You don’t have to have 20.00 waiting for you to cash out all at once, you can cash out as you go and once you hit 20.00 for your account’s lifetime you get the bonus. You can get the bonus multiple times, at each increment of twenty, so 20, 40, 60 and so on.

I have the best luck with offers that are under the Most Credited or Recently Credited columns, they usually always confirm and pay out. You can sign up under [my referral link here](http://naturebucks.com/members/register.php?ref=fire741cracker), or a [non-ref]( http://naturebucks.com)

[Gifthulk](http://www.gifthulk.com/refer/fire741cracker) is a great site that pays out to Paypal and Amazon gift cards. The $5 Amazon GC’s are the cheapest, costing 439 Hulk Coins, and you earn 50 Hulk Coins just by signing up. You can earn more Hulk Coins by:

**Daily Poll** - Each day there will be a new daily poll. You earn 1 Hulk Coin for each daily poll.

**Search** - I win about 2-3 times every day by searching. Prizes vary between hulk coins, daily keys, boosts, permanent keys and store discounts.

**Treasure Box** - Each day you start off with 5 Daily Keys + however many “Permanent Keys” you have. Each key lets you open the Treasure Box, which gives you a chance to win Hulk Coins, more daily keys, permanent keys, Fountain of Youth codes (like swag codes), boosts and even Amazon gift cards. This is like spinning the Superlucky Button on Superpoints.

**Fountain of Youth** – Enter codes to get free Hulk Coins. FOY codes are released on Gifthulk’s Facebook, Twitter and the email newsletter. You can also win codes from the Treasure Box, and these usually have around 5 uses so you can share them with friends. Codes from the Treasure Box are also shared by people on Reddit and Gifthulk’s Facebook page.

**Referrals** – Each referral that earns 50 Hulk Coins gives you 1 permanent key to the treasure box. You also win 20% of your referrals Hulk Coins from searching, Treasure box wins, offer walls, EZ coins, tasks and surveys. There is no limit on how much you can earn from your referrals.

**Offer Wall** – This has offers that do not cost anything, like watching videos, liking a Facebook page, doing surveys, or signing up for an email newsletter. It also awards you for signing up for free trials, though you will have to cancel them before the trial period is over. The offers listed as “EZ Coins” are the easiest to do, and completing EZ Coins offers worth more than 10 Hulk Coins will also give you a treasure box key.

**Gifthulk TV** - Watch a round of 10 videos and get 2 Hulk Coins. Videos credit after about 20 seconds. You also get a bonus for the 5th, 10th and 15th round of ten videos you watch. There are CAPTCHAs at the tenth video, and you need to connect to a Facebook account.

All prizes are given out on Sundays, with the cut-off point to redeem that week being 11:59 pm Saturday night. [Here is my referral link](http://www.gifthulk.com/refer/fire741cracker) if you are interested, and a [non-ref](http://www.gifthulk.com)

[MTurk](https://www.mturk.com) – This is run by Amazon.com, you complete surveys for money. This is by far the best survey taking site, and there is a dedicated subreddit for the best surveys at /r/hitsworthturkingfor. Once you earn 1.00 you can cash out for an Amazon Gift Card, and at 10.00 you can cash out directly to your bank account.

1344467098.0,15,self.beermoney,xwphh,A pretty great method I figured out for swagbucks,26,11,54,http://www.reddit.com/r/beermoney/comments/xwphh/a_pretty_great_method_i_figured_out_for_swagbucks/,"Been debating on writing this out for a few weeks but I figured I'd do it now since it could make you all a lot on swagbucks like it's been doing for me.  

It's pretty simple I think.  To start out, all you have to do is use swagbucks for awhile without breaking any rules.  Do a survey, answer the dail poll, do an offer here or there.  That stuff.  

Just use swagbucks like you normally would and redeem a few things but most importantly, use swagbucks tv for awhile.  Just keep using it.  If you're online, have a tab open with swagbucks tv.

Before anything, another good tip to getting a lot of swagbucks is to replace a few of your bookmarks for the search result of the website you wanna go to. For example, instead of having the bookmark for reddit, use [this](http://imgur.com/7PW9C) instead. It takes one more click than usual but you'll get a steady build up of points that way.  You can get probably a $5 amazon giftcard every week or two doing that.  Also, don't search for random bunches of letters like ""adkfjld"" or ""eoirueoev"" cause [they will find out](http://knowyourmeme.com/memes/paranoid-parrot).

Anyways, swagbucks tv.  I don't know if it's just me but after using swagbucks tv for awhile (I was bored and just clicked), the thing where you fill out the capture box stopped showing up.  It would just reward me every tenth video without any questions.  I figure it's cause I've been on swagbucks for a few months and never did anything ban-worthy.  So I came up with an idea.

1.  I downloaded the extensions No Script, flashblock and most importantly, iMacros on firefox (imacros on firefox seems to work best for me, I use chrome for actual internet usage while I let what I'm about to explain do it's thing).  

2.  Then I went to swagbucks tv and blocked all scripts except swagbucks.com, sbx-cdn.com and googleapis.com.  That's like the bare minimum to get swagbucks to work properly [without having too many scripts on that may possibly pick up on what I was doing](http://knowyourmeme.com/memes/paranoid-parrot).  Also it cuts down on bandwidth I'm sure.  

3.  Then I made an imacros thing with the following actions:

VERSION BUILD=7401110 RECORDER=FX

TAB CLOSEALLOTHERS

TAB T=1

URL GOTO=http://start.mozilla.org/en-US/

CLICK X=235 Y=202

TAG POS=1 TYPE=INPUT:TEXT FORM=NAME:f ATTR=ID:sf 

CONTENT=swagbucks&lt;SP&gt;tv&lt;SP&gt;tech

CLICK X=217 Y=228

CLICK X=225 Y=196

WAIT SECONDS=3

CLICK X=424 Y=178

WAIT SECONDS=3

CLICK X=330 Y=317

WAIT SECONDS=2

CLICK X=277 Y=316

WAIT SECONDS=57

CLICK X=302 Y=176

WAIT SECONDS=9

CLICK X=274 Y=365

WAIT SECONDS=58

To make that into an imacro, press record then stop.  A new macro named ''current' should be there.  Right click on it and edit it then erase all the lines of script and copy/paste the above.  Delete the empty lines in between the scripts and save it.  Rename it ""Watch Swagbucks TV Tech"" [or something less direct if you're paranoid](http://knowyourmeme.com/memes/paranoid-parrot).  Done with that macro now.

I made a few of those but replace the word ""tech"" in line 7 with the word ""food"" or ""trailers"" so it watches different videos [so I can alternate between them occasionally so it doesn't look like I'm always watching the same videos all the time](http://knowyourmeme.com/memes/paranoid-parrot).

It took a bit of work but I got it just right through a lot of trial and error.  Hopefully it works on your screen since it's made of the x/y position on my screen under the x/y mouse clicking setting on imacros (that I can only find on the firefox version of imacros by the way).  If it doesn't work, build off my foundation and try editing it with the x/y setting to make it work.  I always click on one of the different groups (not the main ones like entertainment or food, the subgroups like trailers or aol video) of videos (try doing only the first 3 or 4 ones) then the big one in the middle of the screen on the main page.  It should work with all the categories if you press just the right spot.  Hopefully it should work with my version though.

So you put the repeat macro to 75 and it should get you around 75 swagbucks a day (the maximum given out per day on swagbucks tv).  That should let you press play and it auto-watches 3 videos 75 times.  It's not much but I prefer it that way in case anything goes wrong somewhere in there, it won't have that much wasted time when it replays the macro again.  Maybe a little less cause like I said, stuff occasionally clicks wrong (like when the swagbucks redeem thing shows up) and it needs to finish out the 3 vid macro to restart again so you miss out of those 1-3 watches.  Not a big deal though.  You should get about 70 swagbucks.  [I always try for 65-60 swagbucks a day though so it doesn't look like I'm constantly reaching the maximum everyday](http://knowyourmeme.com/memes/paranoid-parrot).

In retrospect, this should work early on when you're slowly getting swagbucks tv to trust you too.  Instead of watching them one at a time early on, use the above method but set it to repeat 3 times instead of 75.  That would watch 9 videos and then you manually watch the 10th one by yourself and fill out the capture box.  Then do it again and again and again till it eventually stops asking you like it did for me.  [Hopefully it doesn't start asking me though](http://knowyourmeme.com/memes/paranoid-parrot).

If you need a clearer explanation, I'll try editing this or answering in the comments.  I read and reread and wrote and rewrote this whole thing several times to make it legible to someone who doesn't know what swagbucks, no script or imacros is (I'm kinda dreading the rewrite where I add that in - ReservoirDog316 on first draft).  

You can get firefox [here](http://mozilla-firefox.todownload.com/?gclid=CK3QopyN2bECFYhgTAod1X4AaQ), no script for firefox [here](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/noscript/), flashblock for firefox [here](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/flashblock/) and imacros for firefox [here](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-us/firefox/addon/imacros-for-firefox/).  

So with that all in mind, if anyone wants to sign up under me for swagbucks to use [my referral link](http://www.swagbucks.com/refer/ReservoirDog316) and here's a link to swagbucks if you [don't](http://www.swagbucks.com/) wanna sign up under me.

edit:  It's been brought to my attention that the daily limit for swagbucks tv is 150, not 75.  So with my method, you can automatically get 150+ swagbucks a day.

There are so many teens looking to make money and posting your referral code is great just to put it out there.

&gt;Unfortunately, it's only one account per IP address, so in your case, that would mean, one account per household. The reason is that advertisers would prefer only one user per IP address completing their offers (to make sure that one person doesn't do their offers multiple times).

I had seen the post by jamburgles explaining the answer for CashCrate but then when I went to update his post was gone, but now that is is back I am updating this to say CashCrate allows multiple accounts, also here is a copy of their reply to my email:

I thought about emailing their support and explaining that my other account had gotten banned and asking them to ""reset"" my survey account, however, I don't want to screw up my current Swagbucks account and get banned again.

Just what the title says.  It's fairly new, launched I believe the first of March.

Basically what you do is build houses for population and then tax them, 

build resource buildings for wood, iron, stone, food,

And build a marketplace to so you trade the resources into gold,

And then Gold can be traded into real money at a ratio of:

**$1: 100 000 gold.**

If you are a premium member you can trade in ALL resources to real money, all at the ratio of $1: 100 000 ANY resource.

Payout for regular members is $5.
Premium members get a payout of $2.  (premium is $3/mo)

You get $1 in your balance to help kickstart your town.  You can get pretty far with this if you transfer the money into resources so you cna upgrade efficiently.  

I got all my resource buildings to about lv 6 with my dollar.  Max lv is 10

Now, 1 village/town with maxed resource buildings and such will probably only make you about $3.5 a month, so thats a 50cent profit if your premium.

I only advice to go premium once you have your first village sturdy and maybe a 2nd village study, so you can safely make a profit.


You can also make alliances.  of course to ask for help in case of attack, or to ask for resources or to discuss Strats.

Perhaps a **Narwal alliance** can be made for beermoney?  :)

(I am by no means a pro at this.  I joined about 1.5 days ago, and saw that it's new, and Beermoney doesn't know about it yet.)

The admin seems to listen to a lot of the suggestions on the suggestions forum, says he is in the process of upgrading things and implementing things.

SaveUp is a site that I have been visiting daily, not as a way to make beermoney, but as sort of a lottery website. I visit the site daily and place three entries into whichever sweepstakes or give-away I choose.

SaveUp is a completely free rewards site that you can tie to any savings or checking account you own. When you make positive actions on these accounts, such as adding money to savings, adding funds to your debit account, or paying off credit card debt, you are awarded credits on SaveUp. These credits can then be used to enter into sweepstakes.

It really is a totally free, no-strings-attached website. Nothing on their website costs any money, there isn't even a way to actually spend money on their website. You can only ever earn money by linking your accounts to their website.

You earn 200 credits for linking any accounts you own to their website, and considering that you can only spend 30 credits a day, that's quite a bit of credits to play around with, and more than enough to get you accustomed to the website. There are plenty of other ways to earn credits, you can watch videos and take (easy) quizzes on the videos, you can do challenges- little goals that you set for yourself, such as no spending or paying off debt, and you will be rewarded credits.

**Credit Spending**: Every day you can enter three times into a sweepstakes, such as a home gaming set-up worth $5,000, high dollar gift cards, a website jackpot of **2 million dollars** and other very nice prizes.

Being a member, I haven't won any cash rewards yet, and I haven't expected to, as I've only been a member for a few weeks, but I have won a good bit of credits in their sweepstakes. I fully expect to win a small amount of money in the time that I am an active member to their site, and who knows, I might hit it big and win a cash prize of $50 or more, who knows. It's fun, and if you like playing the lottery or trying your luck, this is a pretty fun website to spend 5 minutes on every day. Try the instant win games!

Every 5 referrals grants you an extra daily play on their sweepstakes, and every single referral grants you 15 credits.

Inspired by [this post](http://www.reddit.com/r/beermoney/comments/qg8sy/automate_clicking_of_superlucky_button/), I figure I might as well share it.  It probably works in the same way but there are a few differences.


***


Differences:


*Works on any browser and any screen resolution

*Doesn't require the installation of a program if you're on Windows

*Somewhat user-friendly? (I tried)


***


Downsides:


*Only works on windows I believe, unless there is a version of AutoHotKey that can run on other systems

*It's kind of slow, I built it with users who have slower computers or internet speeds in mind.


The script is made using [AutoHotKey](http://www.autohotkey.com/).  If you want to download it, you can then run the .ahk file to run the script (meaning you can also tweak it to your liking).  Otherwise, I've compiled it to a .exe that you can run without installing AHK.  


***


Instructions:

1.) Go to http://www.superpoints.com/button while logged in

2.) Run the script, then quickly open back up your internet browser and wait for the prompts.

3.) Follow the prompts, I tried to make them clear

4.) Let it go, and good luck :)

SWTOR is down until 11 and I can't catch a nap because the city is inspecting my apartment some time between 9AM and eternity. I am a great advocate of using Superpoints for just the button because I prefer gimmicks over offers. For today, I will engage in offer-fu to help those who need inspiration to keep on clicking and using the site.

I am going to list off what I believe the better offers but obviously it won't be possible for everyone. The Netflix free offer is probably especially bad because most people have an account. If I can, I will find alternatives but here we go.

First off, if you don't use Superpoints, here is a few things to get you started.

For Superpoints, if you are basic you have to earn 2500 points to cash out, if you are gold 1000 and if you are platinum 500. 

My previous post for why you should stick with the daily clicking [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/beermoney/comments/oq1hp/superpoints_psa_for_newbies/)

Previous post of guide written to make sure you move from no ranking to Basic and so on [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/beermoney/comments/odqyp/j_p_who_i_referred_to_superpoints_and_all_other/)

Assuming Basic, which is verified e-mail and the minimum profile completion you need 2500 points to cash out.

DISCLAIMER: I have no way of knowing if they don't have the offer for your area. Feel free to make comments that will help out those in your area if this is the case. 

1. Netflix - 875 Points - Credit Card Required - The only issue with this one is the market is so saturated you may not be eligible. I won't go into speculation on whether or not new e-mails, credit cards, or other ideas on how you could sign up for a new account. Please keep in mind you have to have the account for at least 3 days. When I did my trial, I took about 20 days to watch some different things and then when the appointment in my google calendar popped, I canceled the trial. This one will require a credit card, I believe. Location: Go to PaymentWall, sort by highest paying and it will be near the top.

2. Credit Karma - 100 Points - Free - The site is a legitimately free service to keep tabs on your credit. Cons are that some people will not be a fan of ponying up personal information. The pros are that you can see reviews all over the web. For you credit nuts out there, they use a FAKO so don't expect it to be a score compared to the real deal. I've found it to be pretty accurate on account details at least. Location: Page 2 of the TrialPay offer wall.

3. Mint - 100 Points - Free -Mint is a personal finance tracker and toolset. You enter your bank account info, credit cards, loans, etc and they have all sorts of analysis you can do and it gives you a snapshot of your finances. Its free, has bank level security, and is owned by Quicken. Pretty quick and pretty legit. Location: Page 7 of the TrialPay offer wall.

Quick break for commentary. In my opinion these are the 3 best on there. This puts you are 1075 points, which is cashing out as a gold. From here on will be ones that are not my favorite but are for legit services.

 4. Equifax - 840 Points - Credit Card Required - Equifax is the real deal for credit reporting. Thats because they are one of the reporting agencies. The score given by them should be your actual FICO(at least for Equifax). Why do I like Netflix and not this one? I was using my free trial of netflix everyday. If I pulled my credit report and score, I might not look at this again during my free trial. If my appointment never popped I'd be left holding the bag with a monthly subscription. Location: Page 1 of RadiumOne(you may have to turn off adblock to see it). If you are having trouble finding it sort by popular.

Equifax's cancellation policy ""Cancellation Policy 

What is your product cancellation policy?



You may cancel your product(s) at any time.  If you purchased a subscription product that is billed monthly, the cancellation will occur at the end of your current billing cycle.  
 
For security reasons, you will need to contact our customer care team in order to cancel a product.  You can reach the team at 866-243-8181, 7 days a week between the hours of 8 am - 3 am EST.
 
Once you've contacted our customer care team to cancel your product, you should  receive an email confirming your cancellation request.  You can also log into your Equifax Member Center and view your Order History which will reflect the order as ""Cancelled.""""

New total 1915. 585 to go.

From here, if you truly wished you could probably come up with the remainder by nickle and diming. Watching every video on the various walls and the videos of the day would get you probably 20 points. 

Flixter's online account and app account under new offers for TrialPay will net you 30. 

Saving Star will net you another 15 and if you use its service you make money through paypal for using coupons that you dont have to print or clip. For the sake of me not listing and researching for another hour I will let you be the judge of the nickel and dime stuff. If you have a virtual environment, I would bet theres tons of points for all the ones that require an install. Theres no way I'm installing games on my pc from sketchy sites but on a virtual box you could probably get a decent amount of points. I'll probably break this down one day and repost this in completed form.

 5. freecreditscore.com - 900 points -Credit Card Required - This one is pretty tricky. This is the reason I don't like offers honestly. The free trial is 7 days and then auto-subscription to that credit card you entered begins. If you are strong of will and want to run the gauntlet to cash out today this is the final boss. 
Make your account. 
Prepare your cancellation reminders. 
You will actually have to talk to a person. ""To cancel, please contact Customer Care at 1-877-300-2506."" 
Keep in mind their hours that they are open ""Contact us toll-free at 1-877-300-2506. 
For your convenience, our Call Center is open: 
Monday-Friday from 6 a.m. to 6 p.m., Saturday-Sunday 8 a.m. to 5 p.m. Pacific Time. ""

They are owned by Experian, another of the credit reporting agencies, so you won't be giving your credit cards to randos on the interwebz. Location: Page 1 of TrialPay

If you made it through all of these then you can cash out today. You will be sitting at 2815 which mean you can cash out for a 25 dollar paypal giftcard.  The 315 remaining will keep you on your way to the next one. 

This was far more daunting a post than I had imagined. I think I'll stick to the button but if you have the will of steel you will find yourself getting paid more and more often. Always read your terms of service and set up reminders. Hopefully this helped you out in some way even if you just took advantage of the smaller point free ones.

I did put a few referrals out but won't be replenishing them once they are gone. Feel free to post below if you are close to gold or platinum and I will encourage people who read this to choose them over me.

EDIT: For some reason it changes the formatting on the numbers to a 1 when I break the list up with commentary. Equifax should read 4 and freecreditscore.com should read 5.

EDIT2: Remembered a point I wanted to make. Sometimes if you are willing to invest in some of the offers they make a profit. The key example is the purchase of a Big Fish game. It cost 2.99 and nets you 700 points. It would be the equivalent of saying I'll give you 3 dollars for 7. Its probably not a thing to do for everyone but its something to keep in mind.

• Right-click the search bar at the top of Chrome and choose ""Edit search engines,"" then click the ""Add"" button.

• Enter ""Swagbucks.com"" in the first two fields, and this string — http://www.swagbucks.com/?t=w&amp;p=1&amp;q=%s — in the third field marked ""URL.""

• Click OK, then highlight the new Swagbucks.com search entry and click the ""Make Default"" button.

• Open about:config in Firefox (if you doing it for the first time, you may have to promise you are going to be careful)

• Search for keyword.url from the filter box.

• Double click on this entry. It will open a dialog where you can edit the ‘keyword.url’ string.

•Change this string to http://www.swagbucks.com/?t=w&amp;p=1&amp;q=

The new version of IE makes it difficult to change to a search engine unless it's on their list of approved engines.  To bypass this, use the plugin on the [swagbucks plugin page](http://www.swagbucks.com/g/toolbars-and-plugins)


----

Enhancement Script

Now that you have the engine set, here's a greasemonkey script to beef up the search page.

To install for Chrome, just hit the green Install button.  For other browsers, you have to install greasemonkey first (just google it, it should be the first link).
You can read what it does on the link, but basically it removes the un-needed crap from the page and adds links to alternative search engines (google etc).

1324272998.0,16,self.beermoney,ni6fn,"Swagbucks TV Android App, even if you don't have an Android device (or even if you do)",18,2,25,http://www.reddit.com/r/beermoney/comments/ni6fn/swagbucks_tv_android_app_even_if_you_dont_have_an/,"I've been using this app on my OG Droid since somebody posted on here about it a week or two ago, and I really like it. Even if you max out the points you can receive by watching videos on the computer, you can still get more using this app. 

But I hate that it tied my phone up, that it dies when my screen went to sleep, and some other annoyances, so I figured out how to use the Android emulator to run the app, so I can leave it playing, just like I do with the other videos.

First, you'll need the android SDK: [http://developer.android.com/sdk/index.html](http://developer.android.com/sdk/index.html)

Once you've installed that (the above link has instructions, but mostly, it's just unzipping it), you should navigate to the ""**tools**"" folder, and then run the file in there called ""**android**."" 

First, you need to download a platform for the emulator to run on (a version of the Android operating system). I tried several, but using 2.3.3 was the only one I really got to work. Others might, I only tried three of them.

Once that has downloaded and installed, go to Tools&gt;Manage AVDs. Here you will create a virtual Android device. 

Click New, give the Device any name, and choose Android 2.3.3 for the target. I added a keyboard under the Hardware section, but you don't seem to need to. The AVD will accept input from your computer keyboard. 

Click Create AVD, and then select it and click Start. Click Launch on the next window. In a minute or two, you will see an Android device running in a screen on your computer.

At this point, you're almost done. 

You now need to install the Adobe Flash Player (I'm not going to link to that here, just in case, but here's a great search term to find the file you need:

    adobe flash 11 apk site:mediafire.com

Once downloaded, copy that file into the platform-tools folder from the SDK. Then you need to use a command line to install it. Windows users, I'm sorry, but I'm not going to be a huge help here. You need to run ""cmd"" from the Start&gt;Run menu, then navigate to the SDK folder. Once there, enter the platform-sdk folder, then run:
    adb devices

The output from that will show your emulated device running. Then run:
    adb install nameoffile.apk

where nameoffile.apk is the Flash you just downloaded.

Next find and download the apk of the Swagbucks TV app. I found one here:[ http://www.mediafire.com/?17rmfiubkpug8ku](http://www.mediafire.com/?17rmfiubkpug8ku)

Copy that to the platform-tools folder as well, and run the same command as above, substituting this filename for that one.

That's it! Go to the emulator window, unlock the Android device (slide the padlock using your mouse), then open the App Drawer and run Swagbucks TV. You still need to log in, of course, but that's all there is to it.

I was a little annoyed with the SDK when I first set it up, but it isn't that bad a process. If you need help, PM me, and I will do my best to help out.

1375484611.0,18,self.beermoney,1jlfwo,"A quick and dirty guide to the Lowest-Effort Beermoney: 10 minutes a day, 10$ a week.",39,21,16,http://www.reddit.com/r/beermoney/comments/1jlfwo/a_quick_and_dirty_guide_to_the_lowesteffort/,"Hi guys! I noticed that one of the big problems with beermoney sites is that the time it takes to actually get stuff going on a bunch of sites is a real pain in the neck. It took me way too long on Swagbucks to actually get enough to cash out, and mTurk also seemed quite slow. So I decided on a beermoney setup that, while not very lucrative, is extremely low-effort. It should get you about 10 bucks a week for only a few (less than 10) minutes a day.

**Locket (Android only)**  [NonRef](http://getlocket.com)

This is basically selling the space on your lock screen for ads. You 
should make between 25 and 50 cents a day just from unlocking your phone, and unless you needed a particular widget, there's really no opportunity  cost. Refer a few friends (max 5) and you can hit the 10 bucks for payment far earlier.

**Bing Rewards** [NonRef](http://www.bing.com/rewards/signup/webtou)
Microsoft will pay you to search on their website, to the tune of 
approximately 1 cent per two searches, once you redeem for a gift card. This is a low rate, but it only takes about a minute or 2 to do the searches if you just click on the Recently Searched button. Alternatively, you are probably searching the internet anyhow, so there is a chrome extension will let you use Google and get points for bing. No link for that, because it's kind of cheating. For truly dirty pool, you can use a bot to generate the searches, but that seems like a good way to get banned and lose your ability to earn entirely. You can make about 15-20 cents a day here, depending on how many searches they will count per day.

**Cash N Hits** [NonRef](http://www.cashnhits.com/index.php)

The trick here is to use their auto-browse feature to get 20 cents or so per day, more as you become a power user. Whatever browser you are going to use, disable flash, so that the videos you auto-surf don't trigger. Note that some of the videos will somehow start up anyways (any idea why, guys?), so if one does come up, set the volume to mute and the next one will load unobtrusively.

**Digital Generation** [NonRef](https://coingeneration.com/auth/new/)

This one requires you to download a program, and will net you 30 bucks for 30 days, or 10 bucks if you want to stay with it. You are using your computer as an extra processor for...I don't know, the Illuminati or someone. Once you verify with a phone number, you can download a program with a ""trial thread"" that will get you a dollar a day to run it. At the 30 day mark, your thread will expire, and you can either cash out or pay them 20 bucks to keep going. If you do decided to keep going, just let your thread sit for up to a year.

So, what you get on this setup, when everything is up and running:

* Locket         :     25 cents/day (2 unlocks an hour/12 hours)
* Bing Rewards   :  15 cents/day (minimum # of searches 30)
* Cash n Hits    :    20 cents/day (baseline, leaving on)
* Digital Generation: 100 cents/day (leaving on)
* Total:  160 cents/day= $11.20 a week. 

Note that at the end of four weeks, you're going to need to kick in 20 of it to keep that rate going, but after that it is stable for a year. Not bad for stuff you can mostly fire and forget, as it were.Thanks, and happy earning!

P.S. If you have any other good LOW-EFFORT sites, feel free to chime in in the comments.

P.P.S  I mostly wrote this guide because I was tired of doing a ton of actual ""work"" and wanted to share my findings, but if you want to help me out, I would greatly appreciate you using any of the referral links below.

1355330521.0,16,self.beermoney,14qcc3,How I've made ~$300 on Yardsellr in the past two weeks and how to turn it into IRL value.,18,2,44,http://www.reddit.com/r/beermoney/comments/14qcc3/how_ive_made_300_on_yardsellr_in_the_past_two/,"There was some interest in the last Yardsellr thread about my system, so I will share it here. Your results may not be the same as mine. Yardsellr seems to be constantly tweaking their reward system, but as of this post everything is accurate. 

**Step 1 - Sign up for an account**

[Referral](http://yardsellr.com/photons?pap=1989050)      and [Non](http://yardsellr.com/)
You are free to choose either link, but this is important to remember that the referral part of the game is HUGE. The best way to sign up is to start a referral chain -- that way EVERYONE in the chain gets a reward when a new person joins. More on this later. (Note: You need a Facebook account to sign up, but if can't be bothered to make a burner Facebook account, this is not for you. Also US only.)

**Step 2 - Earn Your Rewards**

-Yardsellr rewards are called Photons. Photons are valued at 100,000/$1. Photons can be spent anywhere on the site. You should have gotten $5 or 500,000 Photons for singing up. You can see your balance at the top right of the page.

-Make sure you Photon balance is not going down by watching the last digit. This a very important step. In order to get you to come back to the site everyday, you have to pause the ""Photon Countdown"" once every 24-hours. You can request that you are emailed when your Pause expires, but the email comes a few minutes after the countdown restarts. It is a good idea to make sure the cycle restarts at a time when you are going to be on the computer anyway. Don't make it to where your Pause expires at 4 AM if you're not usually up that late. 

-There are several ways to earn Photons. For example, you get 1,000 just for logging into the site. The best way to start building your balance is to start blockifying. Blockifying is how Yardsellr crowdsources item-catagorization and makes their site more searchable. Basically what you are going to be doing is looking at listings and putting them in a category. Here's how to start: Go to homepage. About the giant orange banner that says 'Win Photons', you'll be a smaller menu that says ""Stuff you love / People / Blocks"". Click on Blocks. This will organize the page into blocks, or categories. Before you can put something into a block, you have like 'Follow' that block. You should see the page is now organized into blocks. Hover over each of the block and 'Follow' it. Do this for as many blocks as you can stand. Once you have followed a shitload of blocks, mouse-over your name in the top right corner and go to my account. Towards the right you will see your 'Stats', which includes your blockify score. Click on 'Latest Listings'. This will display the most recent items that have been listed and have not been put into a block. Mouse-over these items and click the white plus sign. This will bring up the block menu. You should be able to figure it out from there. Once an item is put into the same block by enough people you will be rewarded, so don't spend too much time searching for an esoteric block. Hit the common stuff like clothes and jewelry. The Photons are not rewarded immediately. They are usually rewarded in block of 2500, which you will see pop up the next time you log in or refresh. Yardsellr is very good about letting you know when you have been rewarded.

**Earning Larger Amounts of Photons**

-There are other ways to earn Photons besides blockifying, but the most lucrative way is through referrals. You will find your referral link in the top left corner of the page under 'Share and Win'. Yardsellr rewards everyone in the referral chain, so this can be a really great way to rack up points. You get 75,000 per sign up, and 500,000 if they buy or sell (which is very possible -- we'll get to that later.)

-The Offer Wall is the giant, orange banner at the top of almost every page. It is a way to earn varying amounts of Photons (up to 5M) by signing up for trial offers, buying shit, or taking surveys. This is also very important to making some decent cash, but you MUST use their offers strategically. Do not sign up for anything yet. I will tell you how to do that a little later.

-The Photon Wheel is the most fun part of this, and also the part with the most variance involved. You receive spins on the Photon Wheel only from other people (as far as I can tell), either though gifts or purchases. Every spin earns you between $0.75 and $50.00. I have taken between 75-80 spins on the wheel, and have gotten every prize. My average spin has been worth around $1.90. I think this number is pretty close, but maybe slightly on the high side because I did get the $50 once. I will tell you the best way to get spins and when to use them a little later. 

-The Daily Leaderboard is also a way to earn some decent cash. They award daily prizes for Buyers (which is really just total Photons earned as far as I can tell), Commenters, and Referrals. You will not crack the top spots in this contest, but you can easily slip into the Top 10, which usually pays $10. This is why you want to be strategic about when you accumulate Photons. 

-There are also Photons races, but to be honest I don't know anything about those other than the info listed on the site. I haven't been able to find anyone else to participate with me. 

**How my systems typically works**

-Now that you understand the basics of how to earn Photons I can tell you how to do that most efficiently and how to convert your Photons into value outside of the site.

-First thing to keep in mind: The smaller Photon rewards for blockifying, commenting, signing in, etc are capped at 1M / per day. The other rewards such as referrals and Photon Wheel spins are not capped. This means you should blockify first before earning anything else. If you hit your 1M through blockifying, you can continue to earn more Photons through offers, referrals, and spins, but the converse is not true. There is not limit on Photons from these sources, but once you have passed 1M in daily earnings you will be blockifying for free. 

-The key to my success was the Photon Spins. You want to wait on utilizing the Offer Wall until you have a good day with spins. This means you have to acquire spins. Sometimes random people will send you a spin. If this happens, DON""T USE IT YET. Save it up. You want to get on the Leaderboard and one spin isn't going to do it. The best way to get spins is to buy shit. Yes, this may or may not require you to spend actual money. Spending actual money is NOT required to be successful. I'm going to have to go in to how Yardsellr makes money here, so bear with me. Yardsellr does not charge a fee to list your item, but they charge a 'slice' which has a minimum of $2.95. Sellers can choose who pays the slice (buyer or seller). There is also shipping and handling to consider. People offer spins to entice people to buy. Some people know what they are doing and only offer 1 or 2 spins. Some people are new to selling (you have to purchase spins as a seller) and offer WAY too many spins per item. These are the people you want to find. You can use your Photon balance to purchase these items, but the slice has to be paid with real money. You can choose to 1) Find someone who offers spins on an item and they pay the slice and S&amp;H. This is actually very common. 2) Find someone who covers the slice and you pay S&amp;H or 3) My favorite method: Find someone with a low-priced item who offers local pickup. You want to look for at least 5 spins on a low-priced item. That way you can cover the item with your Photons, select local pick-up, which is free obv, and you may have to pay the slice of $2.95. I spent about $20 to get up to $300 plus, but I stopped blockifying once I figured this method out. You can do it without spending a dime. I am going to link to some items that offer a good/spin per cost ratio. Something else you can try: if you some some crap you don't want to get spins, you can email the seller and tell them you don't really want the item and that they can keep it if they send you a few spins in exchange. This usually only works with sellers that have local pickup because Yardsellr holds the funds with new sellers until they provide the site with a tracking number. 

-Once you have a few spins built up, you can make a push at the leaderboard. Unless you have a crazy day and get a $50 spin, you only want to try for the Top 10. You can look at the previous days to see how many Photons that will take. Ideally you will just slip into the last spot. First, use your spins on the wheel. I like to save up 7 - 10 spins. The amount of Photons you win will determine what's next. If you end up with 6M+ Photons ($60) - STOP. This should be enough to get Top 10. If you have a more average day, say 1.5M - 3M, this is when you want to take advantage of the offer wall. There are several options on there that pay 1M -3M, as well as a bunch in the 500k range. Stack these offers (make sure you choose the ones that verify instantly) until you get into that 5.5M - 6M range). The contest ends at midnight EST, so you can keep an eye on your position. If you have a few spins left you can be more conservative with the Offer Wall and monitoring the Leaderboard until 11:30 PM to see where you stand. Make the Top 10 and you automatically get $10 in Photons in your account. 

*Regarding real money

-You can pretty easily figure out if it is worth spending real money to get spins. You have my ballpark for what a spin is worth, but you also have to consider the value of Photons off of the site. There are a few ways to do this. You can buy items, such a silver coins (or anything really) that you can either keep, or resell on Yardsellr or another site. This will make Photons worth about $0.50 on the dollar. Of course, you want to find items where you don't have to pay the slice or S&amp;H, which further dilutes your Photon/dollar value. I prefer to buy gift cards. There are many sellers now who sell Amazon and other GCs with no slice and free S&amp;H. I just bought two $100 Amazon GCs for $120 a piece, which is $0.83 on the dollar. Keep in mind that after the slice, these people are making about $8 per GC, which they don't even purchase until after you buy it from them. After you complete the order, they go to Amazon, buy the GC and have it shipped to your address. 

**That's the basics of it**

I'm sure I have left something out, so feel free to ask away. **Most importantly** 1)start a referral chain (I'm going to put my link here again) 2) be strategic with your Offer Wall and spins 3) there is some variance involved because of the wheel 4) you can make more money if you spend a little, but this is NOT at all required.

ideas for some Beer Money",21,7,17,http://www.reddit.com/r/beermoney/comments/138c5p/lets_get_the_ball_rolling_with_some_original/,"So myself, like most of you, I'm tired of seeing the same old posts about Swagbucks, Jebbit, Superpoints, Topline, lets start a discussion on some original content to make some easy beer money.

With that out of the way, I'll go first.

Beer Money tip #1 (or **BMT#1**): Fall is here, don't let those leaves fall to waste! Go around your neighborhood and ask neighbors if they would like their leaves raked. Make them a reasonable offer, say, something like $5-$10 depending on how big the area is, maybe a little more if they want you to rake the leaves into trash bags or something. If not, on the curb is fine too. **BE COURTEOUS AND NICE!**

**BMT #2**: Notice any places where people don't recycle their cans or bottles? Pick them up and collect them! Pay rates vary from state to state, but over time if you collect a nice hoarde of cans/bottles, you can easily make a quick fiver, the natural price of a 6 pack of average beer....or if you enjoy the taste of a good premium ale, its halfway there!

**BMT#3**: Are you in school/college right now? Are you good at a particular subject(s) that tend to be tough fro others? Offer your time and services as a tutor! Create a post on Craigslist and list what subject you are good at and mention you can offer help for a price. I have a friend who is really good with calculus and statistics and helped quite a bit of people through word of mouth and made quite a bit of money over a semester....enough to buy a new PS3 and 5 games.  Best time to do this----during any midterms/finals.

**BMT#4:** [ebay](http://www.ebay.com/)--- Have any stuff laying around the house you think might be worth something? Search for anything you think may be relevant on the site to gauge what it sells for. For example, lets say you have a 1969 Vintage Leg Lamp from the movie A Christmas Story(made this up).  Search for similar things on ebay and see what the average price is and list it on ebay.

Another thing is Craigslist, but on ebay, the market is a global one and shipping costs aside, you can sell to ANYONE.

So see that old set of silverware your mom gave you? Is it in nice condition and not a cheap knock off? See what its selling for and list that puppy!

But there is a problem, I've wanted to share the good news of my extra earnings but every time I try to introduce any of my friends I find they think I sound like a sales scam or come across as pushy. 

So today, I decided to put SliceThePie.com on my Facebook work experience. I filled it out like it was a normal job, and posted my referral in the ""description"" field. After I saved this, it posted a status update mentioning my new work experience in all my friends news feeds which surprise surprise got me a few friends asking me about how the website works and how they can write better reviews to make more money on the reviews. 

Anyways, I thought this was a different type of way to gain referrals and hopefully it helps us Beer Money Makers seem less sketchy when telling people that you truly can make money on the internet easily.

Hey guys. Some of you saw my post a couple days ago about datsoup.com and well it wasn't ready yet at that point however now I think it's ready to operate. For those of you that didn't see the post datsoup is the ""mod"" version of the refer-o-matic. There are 3 main difference between datsoup and the refer o matic.

First. The referral ID's are kept in the database for 30 days. Not a week. Hopefully this makes it easier for your ref ID's to get chosen and to have someone sign up with it.

Second. The design/description of the sites. While neither of the two are exceptional they provide a bit more of a user friendly site where someone who has no idea of what the program is can get an idea and then decide if they want to sign up. Obviously the descriptions of the sites/the design of datsoup needs to get better but as for right now they will suffice. 

Last. The domain name. Whether or not you actually like the name datsoup or think it fits the site (supposed to be ""put you referral ID's in dat soup) it's at least easy to remember and can be posted about on forums and talked about in real life with little confusion which can lead to more people using it to sign up with your referral links. 

Past that they are pretty much exactly the same. If you have any suggestions feel free to comment below or send me a suggestion through the ""Contact Us"" button on the nav bar. 

Also please be patient with any changes that need to be made. I'll do my very best with anything that you want to see implemented but it might take some time.

This is a pretty neat way to earn some extra cash and they don't spam you with email each time an ad comes in. You get one email saying that you have Paid Ads available. Then, you sign into your account and view the ""emails"" there. Click to view, let the ad run for about 30 seconds (it'll show a ""take me to the next ad"" button when ready to move on). 

Ads are shown based on your selection of interests (Tons of categories such as children, entertainment, women's health, men's health, etc. You can select 15 that you are interested in viewing). I never actually watch or look, I just let it run in a separate tab and check back to go to the next ad.

I usually get about 28 ads a day at two cents each. So it's a little slow income, but I've found if I'm consistent with it I can get about $25 every other month for doing nothing. If you have FlashBlock for Firefox, you won't even hear them running in the background.

Most of the jobs were really time consuming and it took forever to make any worthwhile sum of money. Then one day I found a test from Midwest Internet (I think that was their previous time) for a Internet Writing Qualification Test. It was two dollars and I would get a four dollar bonus for doing well on it so I said what the hell. I took the test and got the bonus.

Turns out this company was posting a plethora of jobs everyday. Anywhere from writing how-to articles to reference articles. They eventually changed their name to CrowdSource and have even more work than they used to. For writing 100-300 word articles you get anywhere from 2-6 dollars a piece and it is pretty easy work.  

They do the qualification process a bit differently now. Make an mturk account and then go to www.write.com and read the FAQ and take the test to become a paid writer. You will want to send them your mturk worker ID as well which can be found under the ""Your Account"" tab. It might be good to do a few unrelated HITS first before taking the test so you can establish some worker history. Some of the jobs also require that you have completed a certain amount of HITs beforehand. I make anywhere from 1-2k extra  month for just a couple of extra hours of work everyday.

1324022468.0,15,self.beermoney,neyl2,"An evaluation of clickworker, iwriter, and mturk as freelancing writing sites",16,1,19,http://www.reddit.com/r/beermoney/comments/neyl2/an_evaluation_of_clickworker_iwriter_and_mturk_as/,"I have been writing online, and have used these three sites. I have evaluated them on the basis of rate of pay, method of payment, and types of projects.

Clickworker

Clickworker has writing assignments at a rate of on average 1 dollar per 100 words or more. This site is great if you are quick at writing SEO text.

 Assignments include writing SEO text for groupon, writing about hotels, and writing about travel destinations. Some of the assignments can be fun, but grow boring after a while because of their similarity. As well, there are often no tasks available. You will have to do some basic tests to get access to assignments, and I have heard that there are more available for bilingual workers.

If you are skilled, you could make 10$ an hour plus if you really concentrated and with practice. I personally have probably made about 4$ an hour writing for this site.

Payment is based on a minimum of 10USD, and is done via paypal. It is credited on the 7th of every month. As a Canadian, I did not have to enter tax details, but I believe that US citizens may have to. 


Mturk

Among many tasks, Mturk has writing tasks. This is where I started writing. The rate of pay for mturk writing assignments differs hugely, and on average is quite low. Mturk is useful as a writing site if you are willing to wait for good assignments. By best writing assignment on Mturk netted me 6$ in 15 minutes, but I have never rivaled that success again.

Mturk pays by direct deposit if you are in the US. As a canadian, I am only able to get amazon.com gift cards. There is a waiting period for new workers of 10 active days before you can withdraw money. The withdrawal process for the gift cards is instantaneous. 

Payment by clients on mturk is dependent on the client. Some will reject even good assignments, and others will wait days before accepting yours. I recommend using the Turkopticon v2.0 extension for google chrome. This allows other workers to rate clients, and can steer you away from bad assignments. A tip is to search for assignments that you are qualified for that pay .5 dollars and more.

I have probably made 3$ an hour writing for this site. When you find a good assignment, this site is fun, but there is too much chaff to make it viable.

Iwriter 

Iwriter is the current site I am using. It pays about 250 per 500 words, or 1$ for a 150 word assignment. but once you have 30 ratings and an average rating of 4/5 stars, you can get access to better assignments. I am on my way! The better assignments offer a rate of pay that can be 3$ per 150 word assignment or more.

The assignments are quite fun. I have written everything from guides to swimming better to why people should take a vacation to the african safari. This site is my favourite because amount of assignments I can choose from. As well, there are always lots of assignments, unlike Mturk and Clickworker.

Make sure to only do jobs for clients who have a high approval rate. This will save you time and effort, as declined assignments mean you do not get paid. I recommend doing repeat work for those who have given you a 5 star rating. I believe that it is possible to more than minimum hourly wage once you have established a reputation. I have probably made 6$ an hour on this site. I currently have a rating of 4.5 stars after about 20 assignments, and am well on my way to accessing better assignments.

Payment is weekly, with a minimum balance of 20 USD. It is done via paypal.

I am currently looking at new sites, and found this online resource that offers reviews of more serious work. I am planning on making the switch from SEO based work to more professional freelancing work, and have found this site useful for its evaluation of different sites. http://freelancingguide.net/.
