&gt; **Tell Colbert, Maddow &amp; Stewart that Jill Stein deserves air time!**

&gt; We're getting a lot more media attention as the campaign grows, but it's nothing compared to what Obama and Romney are getting - not surprisingly since they have enormous advertising budgets and since mainstream media is owned by the same coporations that own the two major parties.

&gt; Despite the uneven playing field, we will be heard.

&gt; In the coming weeks, we'll be sharing a variety of ways you can help us amplify our message and ensure the citizens of the United States are given the opportunity to hear from a candidate who has real solutions for moving this country forward.

&gt; So, let’s dive in with two easy ways to help today:

&gt; 1) Make sure you’re connected to us! Since we don’t have a multi-million dollar budget for paid advertising like our competitors, social media is one of our best options for raising awareness. And, if you saw the impact it had first for the Howard Dean campaign, then the revolution in Egypt and the uprisings in Wisconsin and around the country - you know it’s an imperative force for advocacy. We need all of you with us everywhere you can be!

&gt; •Twitter http://twitter.com/jillstein2012 

&gt; •YouTube http://www.youtube.com/user/JillStein2012?feature=watch 

&gt; 2) Help us get media coverage on three target outlets: The Colbert Report, The Daily Show, and The Rachel Maddow Show. These three sources could help us reach millions of sympathetic voters!

&gt; On Facebook - Leave a message on their walls, privately message them, comment on their posts - whatever it takes to get their attention (respectfully please!)

We have to show up and support our candidate Nov. 6th and show other Americans that we are here.

Obviously our victories come at the local level for now. But it's important to show our collective numbers nationwide by supporting our candidate Stein for President.

If any of you are like me and have been playing the tug of war in your mind between voting Stein and risking a Romney win or giving in to voting Obama, let this be a reason why. We must show up to support our party and our platform of a Green New Deal. THIS is what we want, not more of the two party system. If Republicans don't win in 2012 then they'll win in 2016. And then they'll undo whatever small small steps the Democrats took on peace and the environment,  and back and forth we'll go. The truth of the matter is that while Democrats may make better strides than Republicans for peace and the environment, they don't do enough. And they do NOTHING to stop the money in politics and the two party domination - which is what prevents American from making real strides in peace and the environment. The Democrats act like they're our side but they're still *actively* maintaining the system that holds us hostage!

It's time for the Green Party to rise. We - the voters - are the ones that will make that happen by coming out for Jill Stein on Nov. 6th. And by supporting and promoting Greens at the local level at every election. Even running ourselves if there are none already!

**I want to assure you that this is the one and only political email I will send this election season.** If you're already offended by a political email, feel free to delete without thinking twice! However, this message does have special significance for those who do not participate in politics and I encourage all of you to at least glance through the info below. 

**Last night Larry King moderated a third party debate with four candidates: Dr. Jill Stein (Green Party), Governor Gary Johnson (Libertarian Party), Rocky Anderson (Justice Party), and Virgil Goode (Constitution Party).** These candidates have been specifically prohibited from debating with President Obama and Governor Romney, but I give many thanks to Larry King for lending his name to the cause of Democracy and giving these four an opportunity to debate. After all, these four are qualified presidential candidates appearing on essentially every single state ballot this year. What kind of democracy only invites two out of six candidates to debate?

**Here is a link for you to watch the Third Party Debate hosted by Larry King in its entirety: http://www.pbs.org/newshour/rundown/2012/10/watch-a-livestream-of-the-full-third-party-presidential-debate.html**  This was truly the most pure display of Democracy I've ever seen; I don't think it is overly emotional to admit to you that I teared up a little at the sight of it. For anybody who has rolled their eyes at our current political system, this debate is really worth a watch. Democracy at its finest.


The full debate is an hour long, so for those of you who want just a quick overview, I have a few points I'd like to highlight for you that all four candidates in the debate agree on unless otherwise noted:

- Get the money out of politics by **passing a Constitutional Amendment that clarifies that money is not speech and corporations are not people.** Political campaigns should be publicly financed so that all Americans have an equal opportunity to serve the public, not just those that are wealthy or have the money of corporations behind them. We've seen what happens when corporations can buy our politicians and it isn't pretty or productive for America.

- **Include a 4 year college degree as part of the basic free education we give to all our American children** so that they have the skills they need to be productive in the work force. This may seem radical but it isn't. We've done with before with members of the military who came back from WWI and it paid out $7 in increased economic productivity for every $1 we invested into their college education. Most of Europe already gives their students a university education free; it works. Currently in America we supply K-12 education; imagine if students had to pay for a basic K-12 education. Imagine if high school graduates were strapped with student loan debt just from attending high school. THAT would be radical. But that is exactly what is happening to those who obtain a college degree, which is the new high school diploma. Dr. Stein is simply proposing to include a 4 year degree as part of the free education we give to our young people so that they can become functioning members of society. A high school diploma simply doesn't cut it anymore. (Note: Stein and Anderson agree on this; Goode and Johnson think education should be handled at the state level.)

- **Restore the Constitutional rights of Americans to privacy and a fair trial.** President Obama and Governor Romney won't touch these topics (unless it is to take away our rights), but they're important. The essential core of America is people's rights and in the past decade we've seen those rights slowly be taken away. President Obama signed the NDAA which gives the government the right to hold non-Americans and Americans indefinitely without trial. The government has been using drones to spy on American citizens and kill American citizens overseas without trial. The government has been prosecuting whistle-blowers when they call out the government for breaking the law instead of thanking them for keeping our government honest. Our emails, cell phone conversations, text messages, facebook posts and more are all accessible to the government. These are all facts, as impossible as they may seem, and a simple google search will confirm all of the above.

- **Stop our overseas interventions.** We are creating more enemies than we had before by continuing to be involved in the middle east. Look, it's important that terrorists don't get nuclear weapons and such, but that is for the U.N. to handle. When the U.N. deals with radical countries, then it is the weight of the world coming down on that country - not just America. The country can't retaliate against the entire world. But currently, with it just being America that polices these nations, the nations CAN retaliate against America - and they do. **We're using drones to kill specific enemy targets, but these drones literally bomb weddings, funerals, restaurants, and other public places (where we know the terrorist target is located) and KILLS INNOCENT BYSTANDERS in the process nearly every single time.** That does not help tensions in the middle east; that creates enemies we wouldn't otherwise have. Again, these are facts that a google search will confirm. Leave policing the world the U.N. and put American resources back into America - we desperately need them.

- **Stop climate change.** Even our own U.S. Pentagon admits that climate change is the #1 issue facing America and the world today. We have to stop pretending it doesn't exist, stop sweeping the issue under the table, and actually focus on green and renewable energy. This is the number one threat to mankind's very existence on planet Earth. 

- **End the failed war on drugs. The war on drugs is a leading cause of poverty in America.** In poor communities, American citizens are constantly locked behind bars for simple marijuana possession. I don't have to tell you how harmless marijuana is because I venture to guess that every single one of you already knows that. Yet we waste millions of dollars locking these people up, destroying their lives and their future economic opportunities (and thus creating individuals who rely on government support instead being able to support themselves and pay taxes), and we lose out on millions of dollars of tax revenue. Marijuana, and the proper and safe use of marijuana, is a public health issue and should be taken out of the hands of the criminal justice system all together. (Note: Stein, Johnson and Anderson agree on this point; Goode does not support the legalization of marijuana.)

- **There are 90 million eligible voters who choose not to vote. That is more than those who will actually vote. Those people are saying NO to politics as usual.** They are saying that neither the Republican nor the Democratic party actually represents them. But to those people, I say: there ARE other options out there! Imagine if those 90 million people actually voted on November 6th and voted for a candidate they truly believe in, not just for the lesser of two evils; if that happened then Dr. Stein or Gov. Johnson (or Anderson or Goode) would win the election. It may not be likely but it is entirely possible.

President Obama and Governor Romney rarely talk about any of the issues above, and when they do it's usually to advocate against the ideas above. These are not radical notions; these are notions of peace, democracy, and equality for all. They will pull America out of debt, out of our overseas interventions, and out of the global impending climate crisis.

I do not think Stein or Johnson will win in 2012, though it is legally possible. But I do think that they could both gain enough votes to make them serious contenders for 2016. **All it takes is courage from Americans** to stand up and vote for a candidate they actually believe in; not just the lesser of two evils. To do this, **we must accept that Obama and Romney, Democrats and Republicans, are exactly the same.** The most difference you'll find between the two is on things such as marriage equality, funding for Planned Parenthood, and who should pay more taxes - the wealthy or all of us. But those items are not real change! No matter who wins out of those two, our lives will not be different. We'll still see our young people starting their careers with debt. We'll still see people locked behind bars for marijuana possession. We'll still see our troops (and monetary resources) spent overseas. We'll still see terrorists hating on America because we're killing their innocent citizens with drones. We'll still see a dependence on oil and energy sources that hurt our planet. We'll still see wealth disparity among Americans. We'll still see candidates at every level bought and controlled by corporations. **We'll still have a political system that works for corporations and special interests; not Americans.** 

**I am voting Jill Stein on November 6th.** The only wasted vote is a vote that is placed for a candidate you don't actually believe in. If you've never voted before I invite you to look into Dr. Stein or Gov. Johnson (or Anderson or Goode - though they don't have the following that Stein and Johnson have). I suspect you'll like what you see. There's no reason to be cynical about politics when your politicians are honest and answer to you. www.jillstein.org  www.garyjohnson2012.com

**Finally, there will be one more debate moderated by Larry King on Tuesday, Oct. 30, 6:00pm PST. You'll be able to watch it live at freeandequal.org/live**

Peace and Love (and Vote!),

To set some realistic goals, we need to come to terms with some facts.

1. Fielding presidential candidates is an expensive time consuming process. The majority of money is spent on ballot access. What's left is not enough to to seriously challenge the major parties. 

2. We will never poll high enough to enter the debates. This is just a fact. 

3. The two party system is not going anywhere soon on a presidential level. 

What I think we should do.

1. Plan, every four years the Green party seems to pop out of nowhere, claw desperately at elections then fade away. We need to be visible. All the time. That means we have to be current, and fix websites so they don't look like they were produced in the late 90's. 

2. Abandon the Presidential campaign for the moment. Were not going to win, and it consumes way to much of our limited resources.

3.  Micro target demographics. The youth, labor, minorities, and pull liberals away from the Democratic party. Tell them why the Green party is better. If you can't tell someone why they should vote Green instead of voting Democrat, you don't deserve to have anyone elected.

4. Work with Labor. As the Democrats shift slowly to the center and the right; labor still supports them.  We need to reach out and prove that Greens are better for Labor then the Democrats.  With this, comes money, and with money, comes elections. (Until we get citizens united repealed, this is something we have to deal with)

5. Throw money into winnable campaigns. What's better? Pouring limited resources into campaigns that we can't win. Or focusing funds on a handful of locations where we have a shot at winning. Elect a state rep, or a senator, or a mayor.  If a Green gets elected, it will have more of an impact than a dozen failed candidates.



6. Coalition with other third party groups. This started a little this year, but needs to be greatly increased. Were not going to win this by ourselves. The two kids on the block are bigger then the rest of us combined. Only through solidarity can we take some votes. Fundraising, joint events, coalition candidates.


6. Don't give up. Things can only look up from where were at.

I printed out 100 flyers from her website and handed them out.  It went very well!  I had some great conversations with interesting people, but most importantly, I convinced people to look into Jill Stein.  It felt great to let people know that they have a choice besides the two corporate candidates.  

I talked with one guy who is disillusioned with both Romney and Obama but says he usually votes Democrat because they support Unions.  After today, I think he might just vote Green come election day.

Another individual was a bit eccentric, but very interesting.  He seemed grateful for just exchanging a simple conversation (which mostly consisted of him talking about some weird conspiracy stuff involving aliens, religion, and other things).  He told me he (who is 54 years old) has never voted before because he doesn't believe in it.  But by the end of our conversation, he seemed excited to visit Jillstein.org and read up on her and I think his first ever vote may be cast for Stein because of me!  That's a great feeling.

Something I noticed while campaigning:  Often, it was enough to say ""She's something different from the democrats and republicans"" to hook someone in.  Honestly, if that's all that needs to be said to someone for them to give another candidate a chance, it shows both the hopefulness for third parties like us and the shit state of our current political situation.

Anyway, I just wanted to share that.  It was a great feeling and the first time I have ever campaigned.  I'm only 17 and will be three months too young to vote this election, but I'll enjoy doing more campaign work in the future and hopefully convincing others who can vote to vote Green.

I hope that some of you read this and become motivated to do some campaigning on your own.  Green Party 2012!",,False,self,t5_2rgbf,False,,,True,t3_10a62b,http://www.reddit.com/r/GreenParty/comments/10a62b/i_did_some_campaigning_today/,

(xpost politics)",41,7,6,http://www.reddit.com/r/GreenParty/comments/12krmi/make_a_real_difference_voting_how_to_vote_third/,"*I'm a big supporter of third parties, and I made this post on politics* ( http://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/12kpjq/make_a_real_difference_voting_how_to_vote_third/ )
    
    
    
Are you a reluctant Obama voter?  Or a reluctant Romney voter?  Are you voting ""against"" a candidate almost as much as for a candidate?  Are you confused as to why abortion and gay marriage should decide (or be decided by) your views on economic policy?  Do you feel that neither party really represents what's important to you?  Tired of the broken politics of two factions who hate each other?    
    
If you are sick of the two party system, but worried about ""wasting"" your vote, here's what you should do this year...    
    
**1.  Identify which of the two major candidates you are reluctantly voting for (or which candidate you are voting against).    
2.  Find somebody you trust who ""supports"" the other candidate, and plans on voting.    
3.  Make an agreement that you will BOTH vote third party.       
(Optional step 4)  Both of you agree to go find two OTHER people to make the same deal, turning it into sort of a positive pyramid scheme.**
    
Since your original votes would have canceled each other out, you can now both safely vote third party without affecting the winner of the election.  In fact since your votes would have cancelled each other out, it would be wasting your vote to NOT do this plan (unless you love the two party system and hate the idea of more choices).  The two of you weren't going to make any difference at all with your original votes, but now you can vote for something meaningful.    
    
(How much you ""trust"" the other person should probably depend if you live in a swing state or not.  If you live in a narrow swing state, it should be a sibling, spouse, parent, best friend, whatever.  If you live in a landslide state, you should be safe finding strangers on reddit to make a voting pact with.)    
    
No third party candidate is actually going to win this election, but 5% of the vote is the cutoff for a significant chunk of Federal Campaign money for next election, and would be a huge momentum builder ( http://ivn.us/2012/11/01/why-5-matters-to-gary-johnson/ ).    
    
In the long run, we need to replace our current ""first past the post"" voting system (which almost guarantees a two party system) with something better, like score voting.  But it's hard to build momentum for election reform when the public perception is that there are only ever two candidates.  If we can get 5% for Gary Johnson (Libertarian) and Jill Stein (Green), that would be a big help in building a future where we have more choices.  
    
Even if you really love Obama or Romney, you should do this anyways.  Your cancelled out votes wouldn't have affected the election anyways.  And even if you aren't thrilled with Johnson or Stein, they aren't going to win this election and actually become president this year anyways, and you can still support the idea of having choices.    
    
Anyways, please tell your friends, come up with a twitter hashtag or whatever, and spread the word.  I know the election is only a few days away, but the two party system is really terrible, and this is a way to make a difference.",,False,self,t5_2rgbf,False,,,True,t3_12krmi,http://www.reddit.com/r/GreenParty/comments/12krmi/make_a_real_difference_voting_how_to_vote_third/,

I am not any of those descriptions. I'm 27yo, barely middle class income, work for a beer distributor, not an environmentalist but hates unnecessary waste. I believe some recycling programs worsens the environment/economy, ie paper recycling. I'd rather grow new trees (aka oxygen) rather than have a dumpster truck (aka CO2) come to my house a collect my used papers. My tax dollars should goto solar/alt fuel/EV subsidiaries rather than recycling paper. I don't make enough money to be a tree hugger, but I would love to lower my electric/heating bills and enjoy clean air.

The [10 key values](http://www.gp.org/tenkey.shtml) doesn't really describe tree huggers. I believe key value #9 is part of #10. **Ending Corporate Personalhood** should be a key value:

I believe companies DO NOT have the right to make their employees/community sick. And companies DO NOT have the right to cut corners to make more money by sacrificing or endangering the lands we live on, the food we eat, or the water we drink. I believe the voice of the citizen should outweigh the company. 

Also War is a big waste of taxpayers' money. If we can be self sustainable then we can avoid wars. If we're not investing in wartime, we're investing in peacetime. Simple.

I wouldn't call the 10 key values 'green' views. It's very progressive and promoting our near future. Believe it or not, green jobs will spark our economy and our future with or without the green party.

I love the green party, but most of the people making my income view the term 'green' as being expensive and a luxury to those making even less income.

I'd love for us to crunch the numbers and produce a sample budget, both to demonstrate the difference between the current budget and the Green idealized budget and to test the platform's more radical propositions for feasibility.

But most of all I would like for us to keep an open dialogue on the Green Party platform so that it can be revised if necessary and made more accessible to potential new Greens.

**Full article: http://www.commondreams.org/view/2013/07/09-0**

Excerpt: 

&gt;Action Plan

&gt;So what do we do?

&gt;1. Expand our avenues of political expression: First, we need to remind ourselves that electoral politics is not the only productive avenue for political activism –that we need strong and independent voices and movements.

&gt;2. Refuse to let politicians use social issues to exploit us economically: We also need to reject the exploitation and manipulation of progressive values by corporatist politicians who use social issues like gay marriage and reproductive rights exactly the way Republicans do – to manipulate their own base into ignoring their own economic interests. Politicians who don’t take a stand on economic issues should be rejected, up and down the ticket.

&gt;3. Explain what is changing – and contrast what is with what should be:  We need to do a better job of explaining what’s happening, so that we can make people aware of the harmful changes taking place all around them. And it’s not just about “change”: It’s also about contrast – between economic conditions as they are, and conditions as they should be and could be, if we can find the political will.

&gt;4. Expand the vocabulary of the possible: The “learned helplessness” outlook says “the rich and powerful always win; we don’t stand a chance.” History tells us otherwise.  From the American Revolution to the breaking up of the railroads, from Teddy Roosevelt’s trust-busting to FDR’s New Deal, from Ike’s Social Security and labor union expansion to LBJ’s Great Society victories, we need to remind ourselves of what we’ve accomplished under similar conditions.

&gt;5. Tell stories: And we need to tell stories – human stories. That’s why Tuesday night’s Bill Moyers special on PBS is so important. “Two American Families” tells the story of a white family and an African-American family in Milwaukee over two decades. Their stories bring home, in a personal way, the agony that has accompanied the destruction of middle-class jobs – a destruction that only happened because politicians made conscious policy decisions.

&gt;To explain, to provoke, to inspire, to tell stories is to begin the process of political change. As Paolo Friere said, “To speak a true word is to transform the world.”",,False,self,t5_2rgbf,False,,,True,t3_1hxyb0,http://www.reddit.com/r/GreenParty/comments/1hxyb0/where_the_hell_is_the_outrage_commondreamsorg/,

1367582760.0,15,self.GreenParty,1dm4ok,English &amp; Welsh local elections: Green Party results so far,16,1,8,http://www.reddit.com/r/GreenParty/comments/1dm4ok/english_welsh_local_elections_green_party_results/,"**Local elections**

There was [a link in this subreddit yesterday](http://www.reddit.com/r/GreenParty/comments/1dhmu2/england_wales_local_elections_green_party_fields/) about the English and Welsh greens fielding the largest number of candidates in its history in the local elections yesterday and today. Most English counties are having council elections, though these mostly concern rural and small town areas, not the country's main cities. Some counties voted yesterday already and so there are already results for seven counties. 

(Oh, oops, I was mostly reading up this morning and now I see that meanwhile, results for two more councils have come in - more about those later, then.) 

The biggest news is [the imposing surge of support for the UK Independence Party](http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/ukip-hails-sea-change-in-british-politics-as-it-dents-tory-grasp-on-county-councils-8601966.html), a conservative-populist anti-establishment party which mostly campaigns on its opposition to the European Union and immigration, and draws most (but hardly all) its voters from disgruntled Conservative Party voters.

**Green Party results so far**

I'm neither a Brit nor a Green party activist, but I'm a leftist and I've always been interested in minor parties, so when I was reviewing the results I dug into the websites of the various counties to see how the Green Party had done. In [the overall results](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-21240025), when I looked this morning, the Greens had won three council seats in seven counties, which isn't much, really - it was about 1% of the total number of elected councillors. But it compared to just 1 councillor in the same counties the last time they were up.

Those three council seats were won in the **[Gloucestershire county council](http://glostext.gloucestershire.gov.uk/mgElectionResults.aspx?ID=3&amp;RPID=32661477)**, where the Greens maintained its one seat out of the council's 53, and the **[Essex county council](http://www.akserps.com/aksessex/election/2013/ataglance.html)**, where they won 5% of the vote and two of the 75 seats, up from zero.

The Gloucestershire county seat they won was [for Stroud Central](http://glostext.gloucestershire.gov.uk/mgElectionAreaResults.aspx?ID=101&amp;RPID=32579286), where Sarah Lunnon was reelected with 40% of the vote, with 28% going to the Labour candidate, 15% to the Tory candidate, and 14% to the UKIP candidate. Sounds like a pretty left-wing seat.

One of the Essex county seats they won was [in Rochford West](http://www.akserps.com/aksessex/election/2013/row.html), where Michael Hoy won with 39% of the vote. This was not a left-of-center constituency; the Green candidate won thanks to the division of the conservative electorate between the Tories and the UKIP. The Tory candidate got 31% and the UKIP candidate 21%. The Labour candidate got just 8%.

The other Essex seat they won was [in Witham Northern](http://www.akserps.com/aksessex/election/2013/win.html). James Edward Abbott (what a very English name) won with just 26% of the vote in a fragmented four-way field. The UKIP and Conservative candidates both got 25% and the Labour candidate 21%.

**Strategy?**

It strikes me that the LibDems are wholly marginalized in these seats. In the article which was linked in this subreddit yesterday, the Green party [described its strategy](http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/2013/apr/30/green-party-largest-number-candidates) as ""a highly localised style of campaigning, with candidates loudly opposing plans for shale gas fracking, incinerators, landfill sites and roads"":

&gt;Natalie Bennett, leader of the party, told the Guardian the campaign would be a test of localism. ""In some areas, it's about 20mph zones near schools, hospitals, parks or play areas,"" she said. ""In other areas, it's about planning protections or development of green spaces.""

This sounds a LOT like the usual LibDem strategy for by-elections and local elections, but obviously the LibDems can't follow this strategy anywhere near as credibly anymore with their participation in the national government coalition with the Tories hanging around their neck. I wonder if the Greens are out to kind of replace the LibDems' traditional role in this respect.",,False,self,t5_2rgbf,1367594536.0,,,True,t3_1dm4ok,http://www.reddit.com/r/GreenParty/comments/1dm4ok/english_welsh_local_elections_green_party_results/,

Mainly about the ineptitude of the party and the irrelevance of a presidential campaign that can't be won. There was so much truthiness going on in the comments section in a couple threads, I could not express my thoughts one by one, so I wanted to give my thoughts here:

*""Jill Stein won't win."" *

Thank you, that is very insightful!

Now, if this is important to you (to some of us, it is not) what are you going to do about it? Besides complain? 

This is a democracy; in democracies you have to get up, fight, and make your voice heard. If no one listens, you may have to yell louder, or get arrested at a bank protest. In some cases, people will only listen to you because someone on your presidential ticket appeals to them.

Many never would have heard of the Green Party if it weren't for Jill Stein. 

The reason a lot of local Green elected officials (yes, they exist contrary to the assumptions of most. Here's Maddow interviewing one: http://www.darylnorthrop.com/blog/2011/6/26/mayor-jason-west-g-on-rachel-maddow.html) get any exposure at all is because they are linked to the Presidential candidates.

In other words, you can't get exposure to local candidates unless they piggyback off a strong national candidate. It's like a sacrifice fly in baseball; it looks bad on the stats sheet, but it's what's best for the whole team. If you look at the 2008 election and how excitement for Obama carried over to lesser known local candidates, you can see how this dynamic works.


Also, turnout for presidential elections is much higher than midterms. 

That's because voters want to support their presidential candidate, and if there is none, many people will stay home. That will absolutely KILL turnout for the local candidates. Again, presidential candidtates are critical for turnout.

So to say ""Stein is wasting her time, focus on local elections"" is a profoundly misinformed strategy. 

The only reason we are having this discussion about local candidates is because Dr. Stein is such a strong national candidate who has brought attention to potential victories local races. McKinney and Cobb were never as strong as her.

And yes, the Greens are already running for school board, city council, county council, and mayor (http://www.greenpartywatch.org/2012/03/15/56-green-candidates-campaigning-for-office-in-texas/). The question is, are you supporting your Green school board, city council, county council, or mayoral candidates? Do you even know who they are? Do you have Google? How are you helping them?


How can a local candidate get federally matched funds? Do you realize that Stein's matching funds are being used for local ballot access goals? The local candidates wouldn't even be on the ballot in states like PA if it weren't for resources from the national presidential campaign being funnelled for local use.


This is not an easy thing to do. How many states does the supposedly more ""experienced"" Rocky Anderson have ballot access in? With all her fame and connections, how could Barr not raise enough money for federal matching funds? How could an unknown doctor beat a multimillionaire Hollywood actress? This is a lot more complicated than you guys think... Obama has more campaign offices in Stein's neighborhood than she has employees on her entire staff; the reason for this is corporate money, not ineptitude.



I hate to break it to you guys, but if you are voting because you want to win, rather than doing what is right, you are in the wrong place. 

A vote for Greens is a vote for resistance. 

It is a vote for ""none of the above."" 

It is a vote for obstructing the status quo of the corporate state. 

It is a vote for raising awareness that there is another way.

Getting elected to the CEO position of the United Corporations of America is not the goal here. 

Your vote is a protest vote. 

I have never heard of an anti-war protester or an Occupier who said ""We've been out here all day, and the the war isn't over yet &amp; we haven't won anything. Let's go home and vote for Obama because he will win."" 

This is the mentality of paralysis. This mentality would have killed just about every successful socio-political movement from day one.


Not voting, or a vote for a corporate Democrat, is a signal that you are ok with the status quo; that what is going on is not a big enough deal for you to spend the time to vote. 

If you think that making your voice heard is a waste of time, I don't know what to tell you. I guess you should stay home &amp; watch reality TV. Or better yet, watch live coverage of the election where the rest of the country decides your fate without you.


**TL;DR**

*Presidential campaigns get local candidates on the ballot, raise money for them, funnel national resources to them, and get local candidates media attention. Voters mainly turn out for presidential votint, which coattail off to local candidates, not the other way around. Do you even know who your local candidates are?*

*Voting Green for president has other goals besides being in charge of a corrupt government. It is mainly about resistance and protest, but also it helps in getting local candidates elected. Voting for a Democrat or not voting at all has the same result, which is getting more of what you already hate.*

Texas law requires a party to poll at least 5% for a statewide race (or 2% for Governor) in order to remain ballot-qualified.

This year, the Democratic Party has no nominees for five statewide positions. This is good news for the Green Party, because it has candidates for two of those five positions. 

With no Democrat in the race, those Greens are extremely likely to poll at least 5%. The Libertarian Party got 2% for Governor in 2010, so it is on the ballot automatically for 2012 and 2014.

For example, I was a Democrat-leaning moderate in Mississippi, and wanted to vote for Al Gore, but I ended up doing a vote pairing with a person in Michigan who wanted to vote for Nadar.  That way, he was able to get his vote for Nadar officially recorded (by me voting for him in MS), and I was able to get my vote for Gore placed in a state where it had some actual relevancy.

I've been scanning the web and haven't seen anything this year.  Any interest?  If you're a Green party leaning candidate in a contested state, and you'd be interested in voting Democratic for President this year, I'd be happy to swap my vote for Obama into a vote for Stein (somewhere where it won't matter as much - Arkansas).

On March 6th I was elected to my County Central Committee. I had previously been an avid Occupier and joined the Green Party while I was in a romantic relationship with someone who had been with the Green Party for a year or two. The romantic relationship didn't pan out and I broke up with my partner at the time. I tried numerous times to repair the working relationship between my former partner and myself. This has not worked, and three months after our breakup he still refuses to speak to me or be in the same general vicinity. Normally this is strictly a personal issue, but to complicate the situation my former partner is the Treasurer and Co Chair for our county committee. He is also on the State Central Committee. In our elections the woman voted to be the female Co Chair did not want the position and asked if either of the other two women in the committee would like the position. I emailed her and expressed my interest in becoming the female co chair because I am passionate about being a Green. I was told it was not a good idea because my former partner still needed space from me so we couldn't work together in that capacity. I am completely at a loss. I want to be a dedicated member of th Green Party. I want to fight to promote ideals we all believe in. I camped in the cold at Occupy because I believe in what I'm doing. But I feel that I'm trying to be an effective activist with both hands tied behind my back. One of our Ten Key Values is Feminism. But i do not feel I am being treated fairly due to the fact that I once had a romantic relationship with someone who has significantly more authority and standing then I do. I am considering resigning from my County Committee because I sincerely have no idea what recourse I can even take.

Effectively, my vote has 0 impact on anything... all the races should be solidly Republican. But the more I hear from Republicans and the Tea Party back home the more I just want to cast my vote as a NO referendum on everything that they stand for and how they run my home state. The crux of this is that I dislike Republicans so much that I have an urge to vote for the lesser of two evils just in case... even though I support the Green platform and have been disappointed with Obama.

I probably shouldn't care so much because these races are so one-sided but it's the principle of the thing. So remind me again what we are doing with the Green Party and why we are doing it. Remind me why this is not a wasted vote!

To begin, I'm a car mechanic by trade and have a BA in the History of Science, my senior paper involved automotive history and put a lot of weight on automotive environmental politics and policy; specifically the politics and business of leaded gasoline between 1923-1979. I'm no engineer nor am I a ""Master Mechanic"" but I'm fairly nuanced in the topic.

So as you all know, your gasoline has 10% (E10) Ethanol mixed into the gasoline as an additive after it is refined by suppliers. There are ""environmentalist"" arguments out there in support of this federally mandated practice, but I am of the opinion that these campaigns are designed by the corn lobby, and actually harm the environment.

Their logic is such: We can run cars on E10 there by making our gasoline 10% renewable, since mankind can always grow more corn while it cannot ""create"" more gasoline which is not renewable. Fair enough, this is an accurate statement but it is a moot point. With the exception of American engines designed specifically for E85, your traditional gasoline engine cannot run efficiently on E10.

So here is where the problem comes in. Ethanol does not combust as easily as gas does, therefore the engine has to work harder and use more of the mixture to achieve the same result. **In other words, automobiles on average lose between 1 and 3 MPG**; which in my opinion, is worse for the environment. In addition, E10 tends to wear out some engine components faster, leading to higher maintenance costs.

So comment below and share some thoughts. Mainly, if you all could educate me on whether or not the Green Party has an official stance on Ethanol Subsidies.

I'm currently testing a new method of measuring how strongly people care about the environment, and I'd like to invite anyone interested to take part.

This is a part of a PhD research project, comparing 3 different measures; 2 short survey-type measures, and a reaction speed 'game' examining your automatic and unconscious preferences. The game involves classifying words into categories as quickly as possible, and will run online in your browser (no installation or downloads).

The whole thing takes 10-15 minutes, and it'd be fantastic if you could help out.

To take part, or just to find out more, [please follow this link](http://people.bath.ac.uk/gt226/environmentIAT.php)

What are the gist of all the main values of the party, and how does it work into socialism, if at all.

2) does the party in general hold any conservative values? I am left through and through, but I stand by conservative values when it comes to immigration.

3) Is Jill Stein really the best choice? Is it because she will change something for the better, or is she still the lesser of evils?

Please comment / give your input.,9,3,7,http://www.reddit.com/r/GreenParty/comments/dkgd8/very_interesting_take_on_the_green_party_from_a/,"&gt;I was a Green. See my request below for a ""serious, committed, reasonable, and mostly lunatic-free Left formation in the US""... the Greens aren't it. I really wish they were. The party has no real guiding principles (despite its Ten Key Values, which can be interpreted to mean anything). It's willing to abandon all of its vague beliefs to snag a vanity ""celebrity"" candidate. It runs candidates in very, very few districts nationally, and its ranks are thin. It's often hostile to organized labor and is more of a granola-crunchy neo-hippie lifestyle meet-n-greet. On the grassroots level (in two states, no less), I met plenty of Greens who could be called unhinged and some were outright provocateurs, characters right out of the Cointelpro handbook.

&gt;If there's to be a Left formation, then let it be explicitly and unapologetically Left. Not this ""we have to move beyond Left and Right"" garbage. Let it start with an explicitly Marxist analysis and a commitment to self-determination of peoples and a programme for reconstructing society along the lines of meeting human needs and ecological sustainability. The Greens occasionally hit on some of these points, but opportunistically veer off into libertarianism, contrarian lifestyle-ism, worthless sloganeering, and media and celebrity fetishism. This year, several Green candidates are promoting balanced budgets... why? Because they don't know what they're talking about and they think that this is a way to ""move beyond Left and Right"" and sound topical.",,False,self,t5_2rgbf,False,,,True,t3_dkgd8,http://www.reddit.com/r/GreenParty/comments/dkgd8/very_interesting_take_on_the_green_party_from_a/,
