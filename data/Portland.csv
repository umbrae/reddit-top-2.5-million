My bike was ripped off in pdx. I found in on Craigslist up in Seattle. My friends and I organized a sting operation to get back my bike and to get the thief arrested. We were successful, and the thief got charged with a felony.

[Check it](http://imgur.com/9q356). This is my bike! My favorite pic ever :)

[Check it](http://ingress.kingcounty.gov/inmatelookup/interimResults.aspx?ba=212021095&amp;bt=). It's the idiot's booking status (proof?)

Anyways, the shit-head had two other bikes on his car. [ARE THESE YOUR BIKES](http://imgur.com/a/NGfB1#0)? I suspect they are also stolen. That car is currently impounded, but I'd like to help anyone I can in getting their bike back! I'm posting this to /r/Portland because he stole my bike in r/Portland. He is also from Portland.


If you know whose bike it is, PLEASE contact me. Let's make a point that this is NOT okay! I learned a lot in the process of setting up my sting. I can help you figure out how to get these bikes back. I know where they are, but we must act soon before he gets his car back out of impound. I have police reports and everything to verify this is true. Please play extra attention if you live anywhere in SE. That's where the thief lives, and where my ride was taken.

Please don't downvote. It's a self-post, and I won't get karma anyways... I just want to help some peeps. I couldn't have gotten my bike back without a couple of fellow redditors, and I want to pass on the love. I believe very strongly in community self-policing, and  wish more victims stood up for themselves.

I don't know what I'd have done, but I can guess that there's a pretty fair chance I'd have swept the area with a surreptitious glance and then pocketed the dough, no one the wiser. You turned it in, and you saved my evening, and you made me realize that if I ever see a couple of twenties in the change slot, I'm going to turn them in because there might be someone making that phone call and hoping against hope that the money's been found.

It was my day off, and I took a series of buses that dropped me off right in front of the office. Yesterday, I had a second interview and took the express bus from downtown after work; this dropped me off a mile away from the office, and I got RIDICULOUSLY lost despite having directions. I had a half hour to walk there, and I walked 20 minutes in the wrong direction. (Do the math.) 

I was SO desperate. There was no bus or cab in sight. I approached you coming out of the park and ride parking lot and asked you a GIGANTIC favor. For the measly $3 I have in my wallet, could you please drive me five minutes away so I make my interview on time?

I am amazed that you accepted. Most people would have thought I was weird and just drove away. But you took a chance on me, found the office, and got me there exactly on time.

Today, after 1.5 years of underemployment, I was offered my dream job. If you see this, PM me.

Walk slowly to the platform entrance, then stop right at the narrowest point. You can stare off into space, take out your phone/iPod, or just do nothing. It helps to also wear earbuds so nobody can communicate with you. The key element is: keep your back to everyone and do not let anyone get by you.

2. As the train approaches, walk directly up to the doors before they open. 

3. When the doors open, shove your way on as quickly as possible. Do not let anyone off the train. The doors might close before you can get on and you will be stranded on the platform until you starve or succumb to the elements.

As you rode past me on the Burnside Bridge, your cell phone rang. I watched you reach around and try to answer it while you continued to ride. I also watched you swerve out of the bike lane and into the right-turn lane three times, the first time right in front of a speeding SUV who slammed on their brakes so they wouldn't mash you into the pavement.

I suspect you missed this, though, since you were busy with your cell. I say this because you then swerved out of the bike lane twice more, before blowing through the fully red light on MLK without even slowing down. I'm guessing you didn't notice, because there were three lanes of traffic traveling at full-speed (the light had been red for at least a minute already), and one of the cars missed you by about half a second. Then you stopped one block further at Grand, making your death-defying crossing of MLK completely pointless.

Read about it on his state website [here](http://wyden.senate.gov/newsroom/press/release/?id=cdb3104b-cd55-4d7f-825e-3bec95d944be) or in this [Wired article.](http://www.wired.com/threatlevel/2011/11/wyden-pipa-filibuster/).

And why don't you go ahead and give his office a call to let him know you support this. Or tell him that you don't. This is important, people!

That's wonderful, but please be aware that not all parks are off-leash dog parks, and if you have your dog with you on the front lawn, please make sure that they are leashed so that they can't make it out to the sidewalk. If you need to know where the off-leash dog parks are, they are listed here: http://www.portlandpooch.com/dogparks.htm

I only bring this up because as dog friendly as Portland is, it's not great with dog etiquette. Your dog is a domesticated animal. They may be your best friend, but they don't have the kind of impulse control that people do. Speaking from personal experience, my small dog gets rushed by other dogs every other week at the park near my house and she's been attacked once by a dog who was not on a leash. Conversely, if a small dog who is not on a leash rushes a larger dog on a leash and gets attacked, that is on the owner of the unleashed dog. It's in our nature to see our dogs as different or better mannered than other dogs, but nobody should be put in the stressful situation of hearing ""Don't worry, he's friendly!"" as another dog bears down on you. Please forgive me if I don't take your word for it. 

If you let your dog off the leash in a non-fenced in area and the dog sees a squirrel, or gets frightened and runs across the street, you are risking not only the dog's life, but potentially risking accidents as well.

Please be a responsible pet owner. Leash your pets. ",,False,self,t5_2qi2i,False,,,True,t3_1flh5r,http://www.reddit.com/r/Portland/comments/1flh5r/please_leash_your_dog/,

Fantastic venues with interesting, quirky, sometimes historical things to see, always a nice atmosphere  and friendly staff, some have a great music scene, but all the comfort and originality stops there.

The beer is average at best.  They may have been a microbrew leader many years ago, but now they're just standing still while other beer innovators in the area sprint past them with style and quality.  A few locations allow the house brewer to put out something original, which can be great, but then the company doesn't ever reward those efforts.  They could select some of these better beers to brew all over, at least for a limited time.  What is the incentive for their brewers to produce anything but the same old-same-old?   

The wines are absolute crap.  Yes, some people prefer to drink wine rather than beer.  I've never taken anyone to a McMenamins who didn't want to leave after one glass in search of something better.  Bleh.  

And their food lacks any of the originality that their individual locations seem to scream for.  

I would so love to take out of town guests to some of their more interesting locations, but all I can think of is the boring beer and crappy wine.  So it's always a pass.

What do you guys think?  Is it just me, or do any of you enjoy going to McMenamins?  I ask because I'm thinking about writing them a letter to express the above, but I wonder if it's simply my perspective.



**EDIT:**  I did send an email with a link to the thread.  I got a reply back from Lars Raleigh, who I believe from the website is the manager of the Pubs.  He said they will be reviewing all the comments, and agreed that there were some constructive information (as well as some not-so-constructive stuff, but that is expected in this format, imo).  I got the sense that they were surprised at the general tone of the conversation, since their continued success hasn't given them any indication that they are failing in any way.  He also said that their brewers are actually doing some very creative things right now.  I admit, it's been a while since I've been to one (outside of Science Pub, but I generally don't drink or eat at those), so maybe I should give them a second chance.  

Perhaps we all should.  If anyone finds anything new, pleasing, and positive, please tell /r/Portland.  Probably in a new thread, as this one is getting long and those comments might get buried.  And let them know either way.  They have a customer feedback link on their website.

At any rate, we've been heard.  Thanks for all your feedback and input.  I certainly hope I find myself enjoying visiting their pubs again, as they have such wonderful venues that I find very appealing.",,False,self,t5_2qi2i,1366121520.0,,,True,t3_1ce7rn,http://www.reddit.com/r/Portland/comments/1ce7rn/has_mcmenamins_stagnated/,

The city is literally covered in bike routes (see this if you don't know http://www.portlandonline.com/transportation/index.cfm?c=39402&amp;a=322407 ) and they are not utilized often enough. 

I have lived in inner SE my entire life and commute -often by bike, sometimes by car- up towards Mt. Tabor for work.  Almost every day that I drive I see someone casually biking on Hawthorne with no regard for the headaches they are causing the motorists who are forced to either wait for an opportunity to swerve into another lane to pass, or pass with mere inches to spare in the same lane.  

Biking on busy streets that don't have bike lanes when there are perfectly safe, fast and pleasant residential streets and designated bike routes on either side is selfish and dangerous.  You clog up traffic and force motorists into awkward and dangerous passing situations.   I know you have the right to road, but so do the cars, and you should stick to roads with fewer of them to make everyone happy.  

**edited for grammar, and minor details**

**edit 2** I bike to work almost everyday, so don't try and say that I am some car-loving anti-cyclist.  Also, I wasn't saying that you should NEVER bike on busy streets, I was simply saying that if you can, try and stick to less busy streets for your own safety.  I say this not because I am impatient and can't wait for a good time to pass, I say this because there are plenty of people who aren't and accidents DO happen.

1339715148.0,250,self.Portland,v2hk1,"Why a certain Portland pizza ""institution"" can go screw themselves.",295,45,296,http://www.reddit.com/r/Portland/comments/v2hk1/why_a_certain_portland_pizza_institution_can_go/,"Times are tough, and I recently found myself having to take a job delivering pizzas for a well-known Portland chain. This was a HUGE step down for me, but I figured it was a steady, albeit small income while I tried to find a better job.

After my first 5-hour shift, I was told that I wouldn't be receiving tips for my ""training"" period. Alright, I think, that's fine... I'm just learning the POS and tagging along with drivers, I don't deserve tips yet, I didn't do anything to earn them. I find myself scrubbing dishes for minimum wage, cursing this economy and my inability to find a job in my field (which I have worked in for the last six years for a good salary, until I was laid off in March).

Fast forward to a week and a half later. I have now been delivering pizzas on my own and ringing up customers in the meantime. I have been using my own car to do this as well, with no mileage reimbursement. I am expected to put every tip I receive while delivering into a bucket, where they will be divided among all the other employees EXCEPT ME... even though I'm doing my job just as much as everyone else. I am now being told that I won't be receiving tips for two weeks.

Fast forward to the end of the two weeks period. That night, after delivering dozens of pizzas for no tips (despite customers tipping me graciously), I am told that it's actually *THREE* weeks that I won't be getting tips for, and ""suck it up"". So here I am, broke, driving my own car, spending my own (non-existent) money on gas, doing the same job as everyone else who is getting paid... but none for me.

I ask my supervisor how long this is going to go on for, really... was I being lied to? Used? If I'm still ""training"", why am I out there doing my job with no supervision? I'm clearly no longer training... people assume they're tipping *me* for bringing their dinner, yet all of the money was going to my supervisors and I was being sent home empty handed.

The next day, the day I'm FINALLY going to start receiving tips... they hand me my first, final paycheck and let me go. I've never been so used before. I was robbed for two weeks, with someone else pocketing every single one of my hard-earned tips, and then I was dumped.

To top it all off, now I can no longer collect unemployment. I actually lost close to a thousand dollars by being employed for two and a half weeks.

What a gross business practice, unnamed pizza joint. I've never felt so ripped-off. I've never had such a horrible experience from a Portland-based business. I thought we were better people out here.

That's my rant. Had to get that off my chest. 

EDIT: Wow, thanks for all the support guys, I didn't expect this to even get any attention. In regards to some of the PMs I've gotten, though -- **I hope it goes without saying, but please, nobody call them or harass them or try to fight this for me!** I really hope anyone who suggested that is just joking. I'm sure they are, right? Either way, it feels great to know that you guys hate when one of us gets screwed just as much as I do. Cheers!

EDIT #2: I WAS given a mileage log, and WOULD HAVE been reimbursed for gas. I didn't make that clear in the original posting. However, this was well before my first paycheck, and with not receiving tips, I was pretty broke and could barely keep gas in my car in order to make deliveries. In the end, I was let go before I could ever turn in the mileage log anyway.

Edit #3: No response on friday. Will try again Monday and keep updated...

Edit #4, Monday: Pizzicato is doing their best to compensate me and make this right. Everyone I spoke with at the corporate office was very helpful and totally understanding. I am totally still confused as to *why* I was let go in the first place -- I am now being told that it actually wasn't the district manager's decision, it was the store manager's decision, who I had only interacted with upon being hired and being fired... he was never ever in the store for any of the shifts I worked. 

I'm being told it was because I questioned taking the last two deliveries, and suggested that maybe someone who's not ""training"" should take them, which I did. When I was told that, once again, I would not be receiving tips that night, I did question whether I should be taking deliveries on my own if I was still ""training"". I hardly think this was a fireable offense because I certainly did not become confrontational or refuse to take deliveries, but the incident report he read to me makes it seem like I outright refused to take some deliveries, besides one sentence near the end that says ""He took the final deliveries"". It seems that the manager just wanted me gone once I started questioning why I wasn't receiving tips, and there's very little I can do about that.

I will be given tips for the shifts I worked, though, and I will also be reimbursed for the gas I used in my own car. Still jobless and unable to collect the rest of my unemployment... but the Pizzicato corporate office is doing their absolute best to make sure I'm treated properly now.

I've almost hit cyclists running red lights and stop signs. I've been stuck behind some crusty dude with no helmet and earbuds in, blocking a whole lane as he trundles up Hawthorne during rush hour, even though Salmon's three blocks away. I've had that thing happen where I have to cruise 15 MPH below the limit behind a cyclist until I'm finally clear to pass them, only to have them swing up ahead of me at the next red light so I can repeat the process.

I've also been sideswiped by drivers who then flipped me off and sped away. I've been honked and screamed at from pickup trucks because drunk assholes thought it would be funny to startle me off my ride. I've almost been hit by drivers who weren't paying attention, who then rolled down their window and yelled at me as though it was my fault.

Do I hate cyclists? 

No.

Do I hate drivers?

No.

I hate crappy people. And there are always going to be crappy people. No matter where you go. If you slap a label on everyone surrounding that crappy individual, you're just sticking your head in the sand, refusing to see people and situations on a case-by-case basis. When you're driving and someone cuts you off, do you decide all drivers suck? When you've stopped your bike at the four-way stopsign and someone else buzzes straight through without pause, do you decide all cyclists are assholes? 

Maybe next time someone acts crappy towards you on the road, take a breath, and let it go. So much of all this tension between everyone is because we take a handful of crappy experiences and apply them to everyone. Maybe crack a traffic handbook, bone up on your own road etiquette. If we all focused on being the kind of person we'd like to deal with on the streets, this would be such a non-issue.

1340394074.0,216,self.Portland,vg7r9,Downtown Portland Survival Guide,266,50,291,http://www.reddit.com/r/Portland/comments/vg7r9/downtown_portland_survival_guide/,"This is expounding on [this thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/Portland/comments/vfetl/finally_yelled_back_at_the_scum_who_keep_me_awake/).  Living in downtown has it's own unique challenges and rewards.  Here are some ways I dealt with things in my 8 years downtown.

**Drunks &amp; Crazies Keeping You Up**

* Expect it.  That does not mean it is right, but the fact of the matter is downtown Portland at night is full of douche-y suburbanites that will do stuff downtown that they would call 911 on you for doing in their neighborhood, drug addicts/alcoholics and the mentally ill.  Let their douchiness flow through you and out the other side lest you be swept into the maelstrom of asshattery.
* Portland Police non-emergency number: 503-823-3333 - If someone is lingering and being loud, call.
* For drunks that are passed out, etc. Call CHIERS - the local drunk tank - (503) 294-1681
* If you are in their [service area](http://www.portlandalliance.com/downtown_services/district-map.html), call Clean and Safe at 503-224-7383.  If you call police with a non-emergency that is probably a non-arrestable offense within that map between 9-5, they are simply going to ask Clean and Safe to handle it anyways.  Don't expect C&amp;S to do too much.  They carry a gun and are retired cops, but have no authority to arrest.  They are there to move people along, write reports and call the cops if it gets too bad.
* If the person is in a park downtown, the Park Rangers now have jurisdiction unless it is a 911 emergency - 503-823-1637
* If the drunk is hanging outside a particular bar, store, grocery store  or restaurant and being loud - call that establisment and have their security go outside and shut them up.  Many times this is actually what the police do when you call them for a disturbance.
* Use a combination of the pink noise at http://simplynoise.com/ and a fan. I found that combination block out all but the most egregious drunktards.


**Trouble On The Streets**

* I lived and worked downtown plus walked everywhere I went for the time I lived there.  I only had one full-blown altercation in all that time and could have avoided that if I'd chosen too.  Don't expect any trouble but be aware of your surroundings.  You are more likely to encounter annoyances rather than an actual problem on the streets of downtown.
* Also call clean and safe if there is a part of downtown that needs to be cleaned, various human excretions, dirty needles and the like.
* IF you run into trouble downtown, it will most likely happen after 10 PM or so between SW Broadway and the river and SW Washington and the train station.
* Use the numbers above for non-911 problems.  I only had to call 911 once.


**Annoyances**

* Panhandlers.  There are days I would get hit up for change 20 times or more.  If the person is aggressive, please call police.  Ignoring them just means that many more people will have to deal with it.  How you interact with panhandlers is up to you, your personality and tolerance level.  When I moved here I gave out change, then I started saying ""sorry"" when they asked, then I put in earbuds and pretended not to hear them even if I had no music on, the I dropped the pretense and just ignored them unless they were offensive... I'm sure on bad days I told a couple to get fucked but there was really no need for that.  PLEASE do NOT give panhandlers money.  I'm could write a novel about this, homelessness in Portland, services and ways of really helping these people.  The change is perpetuating all sorts of problems.  I will address this in the comments if needed.
* Chuggers AKA ""Charity Muggers"".  These are the people that stand on the corner and ask you if you want to help the whales or orphaned children.  I've dealt with them in the same way I've dealt with panhandlers.  Once the rainy season ends, expect them to descend on every street corner downtown.


**The Up-Side**

* Too much to list here really
* You are living in a really fucking cool city
* Just going for a short walk can be quite an experience.  You never know what you will see
* There is a lot to see and do on foot.  Get out and enjoy the parks, museums, people watching, bars and more.  
* Remember all the great stuff and try to focus on that when some wino decides to pick a fight with a newspaper vending machine at 3 in the morning.

I live in the ghetto-y SE side, but I've always felt pretty safe in Downtown Portland, even at night, and had no issues or incidents going to shows and bars alone. Last night was no exception, but as I was leaving a show at the Star Theater waiting to cross the street, a tall black fellow comes up and compliments my back pack. He seems a tad intoxicated (as it was 1am on Saturday) and begins to get invasive and flirty. (You here a lot? When can I find you? Go to dinner with me? Where do you live?) I'm being polite, but also trying my best to excuse myself since I was trying to get home. But as I was finally able to slip away, one of his friends quickly gets out in front of me, with an angry look to him, and starts shouting at me. ""You get over here, I said come here!"" and proceeds to try and grab me, but at this point two ladies came and surrounded me to stop the guy's advances. As soon as that happened, their boyfriends rush up and tell the guys to back off, all the while asking if I'm ok. They asked me to walk with them to prevent the perpetrators following or any more trouble. Even going the opposite direction of their destination so that I'm not walking alone. It was an epiphany of kindness of strangers that outweighed the terrifying experience of another.  

Sorry for the rant, but it moved me and I needed to share. Unfortunately, the whole experience is going to make me think twice about adventuring in downtown solo ever again.

Please keep an eye out for their car.,247,44,83,http://www.reddit.com/r/Portland/comments/1k717n/someone_totaled_my_car_on_i5_last_night_please/,"I was heading home from work around 2:05AM last night on I-5 Northbound, when a car doing at least 80mph rear-ended me. My car spun around, hit the guard rail, and ended up sliding backwards against the guard rail before coming to a stop just before the Delta Park exit. The driver of the other car kept going Northbound on I-5. Didn't even slow down. The police scoured Hayden Island and even went up to Mill Plain in Vancouver, but they didn't find anything. 

So, if you see a white sedan, possibly with LED taillights, and definitely with severe front end damage, including a smashed bumper and at least one busted headlight (which I pulled a piece of from my fuel tank), please contact me or call the Portland Police Non-Emergency line at 503-823-3333. Car could be in Vancouver, or possibly even further North, or he may have gotten off at Marine Drive. Please keep an eye out, especially around any local body-shops. Thanks.

*EDIT Based on the piece I have, the car's headlights have at least partially fluted lenses. Not many cars these days still use fluted lenses, so it's probably at least a few years old.

*EDIT2 Looking at the lens piece I have makes me think it could be some sort of sport car maybe, and not a luxury sedan. For some reason the body lines made me think luxury, but I'm not finding any luxury cars that have headlights like this. It looks quite a bit like a front light from a 91 Plymouth Laser, but the Laser's front lights had horizontal lines running across in addition to the vertical fluting, and this has no such horizontal lines. Could be some sort of turn signal or fog light lens even...",,False,self,t5_2qi2i,1376454773.0,,,True,t3_1k717n,http://www.reddit.com/r/Portland/comments/1k717n/someone_totaled_my_car_on_i5_last_night_please/,

Given what reddit did last year in protest of SOPA/PIPA, I think this is a wonderful idea, and would like to follow suit.  /u/xmitter agrees with me on this.  But before we go and do anything rash, we want to hear from you.  Do you support this decision?

Regardless of your decision, I urge you to email Senators Wyden and Merkley, and urge them to not just vote against this measure, but potentially filibuster it.  Last year Senator Wyden threatened a filibuster, and SOPA/PIPA was killed before it could become law.  If you choose to send such an email, I remind you to remain mature, polite, and reasonable in your statements.  Links to the Senator's emails are below.  Under ""subject,"" please use Civil Rights.

Please upvote it there and hopefully we can get it to the front page!**

My friend's dad went missing on September 16th while volunteering for Cycle Oregon in Riddle, Oregon. He is a two time lymphoma survivor but now his oncologist thinks its likely that his cancer had returned and is in his brain. He had been showing signs of disorientation and confusion before he went missing, but he had insisted he was still fine to volunteer. After a very thorough search around Riddle that lead to no clues, it's believed that he could be anywhere in the US. He may think that he lives somewhere else. I'm just trying to help get the word out. **[Here's the main website  for the search effort](https://sites.google.com/site/findmarkb/), with his picture and more information.** Please spread the word. If you see him, call 911. He needs immediate medical attention.

Anyone with a possible previous siting of Mark is asked to call the tip line:541-957-2099. A $10,000 reward is being offered for information that leads us to Mark.

NOT ON MY WATCH!,223,44,56,http://www.reddit.com/r/Portland/comments/154ayr/forever_alone_during_christmas_not_on_my_watch/,"Greets people. For those who don't have anywhere to go Christmas day, come over here (122nd and SE Powell area) and get your game on. We have LOTS of games to play (http://boardgamegeek.com/collection/user/Lance_Lake) and we plan on having a 12 lbs. turkey to cook (thanks to singer07!).

UPDATE (12/22/12 - 16:51 PST): THE TURKEY HAS ARRIVED! Thanks again to Singer07!

Gaming should start around noon. If you want to come by earlier (and be tortured with stupid videos I have), then feel free.

If you do come over (and can afford it), we would appreciate a side dish to go with the turkey. If you can't get it though, no worries.

So no need to be alone during christmas. Come celebrate with fellow redditors. :)

EDIT: Side note. No booze. If you want to drink before you come over, that's fine. But we don't have any drinking in the apartment with people we don't know. Sorry. :)

EDIT PART DUEX: Please also note we do have a cat. So anyone who is allergic, please make sure to bring your meds. We can put him in another room, but if possible, we would like to avoid that.

EDIT THE LAST: Just an FYI. We have a couch (seats 3) and 4 sittable chairs. This means that we have exactly enough seats for everyone. If you have some foldable chairs, please consider bringing them with you. :)

EDIT RETURN OF THE EDIT: Ok. I'm locking it in at 5 people coming. We have seating for 7, so it works out ok (though 3 people will need to be on the couch). If you didn't get a PM with my address and phone number, then sorry, perhaps next year (Yes, I hope to do this every year or even perhaps during the year).

But so what, it's fun and it's a tradition I have no problem supporting.

However, my attempt to take my newly relocated 94-year-old grandmother with her walker in tow, was nearly disastrous. It may have been a bad idea, but when you get to that age, events like the Greek Fest are the highlight of your month.

The really unfortunate part about the Greek Festival is the lack of parking. The surrounding neighborhoods become one way streets, lined with canoodling cars and pissed off people. 

I was going to let my grandmother out at the entrance and find a spot, but I got caught in a flurry of other Festival goers and had to pull over at a corner 3 blocks away. While trying to explain how she could make her way to the entrance (directing her in a neighborhood she didn't know), a super awesome 20-something-year-old guy, named Chris, who attends PSU, overheard me fumbling directions to her. So he offered to walk her the 3 blocks to the entrance. He assured me he would get her there safely, and sure enough, as I made my way to the entrance, there was my grandmother and this guy named Chris, waiting patiently. 

It was awesome! Chris, if you're out there, thanks for being super cool, really, you made my week, and thank you for being so sweet to my grandmother. 

**TLDR:** To the guy at the Greek Festival who walked my 94-year-old grandmother 3 blocks to the entrance, (Chris of PSU, 6ft+, shaved head) Thank you!!

A Community Call to Action

Across the country, Walmart employs 1.4 million people.  We are not just the Associates that you see in stores, we are moms and dads, sons and daughters, husbands and wives working hard to support our families.   We have been speaking out for good jobs with decent pay, regular hours, affordable healthcare and respect, but instead of working with us to make changes, Walmart has attempted to silence and retaliate against us for speaking out.  Our jobs have been threatened, our hours cut, our schedules changed.  Some of us have even been fired.   We will not be silenced.  Throughout the holiday season, including Black Friday, we will be standing up for an end to the retaliation against workers who speak out for what's right for our families, our communities and our country, and we hope that you will stand with us.  

Your Support Is Critical

It is not an easy decision, but without an end to the retaliation, Walmart workers across the country will be walking off the job in protest, and we hope you will join us in creative, non-violent action in solidarity with our strike.  We ask that supporters take action that spreads the word about our strikes and demonstrates to Walmart a wave of support for workers who are speaking out. 

We will not be silenced until we see real change at Walmart. 
-- OUR Walmart

When: Thursday, November 22nd at 8pm

Where: Walmart on 82nd between Powell and Holgate, Portland, OR

1328480630.0,163,self.Portland,pcche,"TWENTY YEAR PRISON SENTENCE FOR TWEETING!  SB 1534, progressing in Oregon's legislature RIGHT NOW, would make it a crime to solicit, via electronic media, two or more persons to ""commit specific crime at specific time and location"".  Details inside.",194,31,65,http://www.reddit.com/r/Portland/comments/pcche/twenty_year_prison_sentence_for_tweeting_sb_1534/,"First, the obligatory ""I am not a lawyer, but..."" opening statement.  Since I haven't had much time to read/understand this bill fully, I'm going to give a some facts/links and my impression of its implications *with the hope that we can all figure it out together in the comments*.

[Here is the pdf of SB1534](http://www.leg.state.or.us/12reg/measpdf/sb1500.dir/sb1534.intro.pdf)

[Here is where you can track SB1534 as it *continues* to move through the Oregon Legislature](http://gov.oregonlive.com/bill/2012/SB1534/)

The most disturbing parts, IMO:
SECTION 1.  { + (1) As used in this section, 'electronic
communication' has the meaning given that term in ORS 133.721.
  (2) A person commits the crime of aggravated solicitation if,
with the intent of causing two or more other persons to engage in
specific conduct constituting a crime, the person uses an
electronic communication to command or solicit other persons to
engage in that conduct at a specific time and at a specific
location.
  (3) In a prosecution under this section, **the state need not
prove that the electronic communication was received by specific
persons or that the defendant intended for specific persons to
engage in the criminal activity.**

Possible real world scenario:
You Tweet or Facebook ""I think two or more people should go to Chapman Square and donate money to [insert group claimed to be enemy of the US here]""  Even if you have no friends or followers and no one ever reads your post, you have just committed a Class A felony- which carries a [mandatory minimum of 20 years](http://www.criminaldefenselawyer.com/resources/criminal-defense/felony-offense/oregon-felony-class.htm)  Note that ""I was obviously joking"" won't help you as intend isn't required.


Other plausible examples:  
Post: ""I've had it with giant corporations destroying our great country.  We should all occupy Chapman Square tonight at 8pm.  To hell with the fences"".  No one reads this, not even your mom, still equivalent to criminal trespass.
Post: ""Two or more people should go to Arlene Schnitzer Concert Hall tonight at 8pm and record the Portland Symphony in an unauthorized manner.""  Crime. (That's really in there: Section 8, subsec 40)

Are you getting that cold, sickening feeling right about now?  This is a truly fucked up bill and IMO, everyone from Tea Party to Occupy should start freaking the fuck out.

**It is my hope that a good discussion about SB1534 can happen below**  Am I overreacting?  Are my examples not valid?  Am I underreacting- got example of possible interpretations yourself?

**What can be done to stop this?**  [Here's the Bill Tracking link again.](http://gov.oregonlive.com/bill/2012/SB1524/)  Anyone know if there will be more public hearings?  This thing to do is **SHOW UP AND SPEAK AGAINST IT**  Also, [contact your own state senator and representative.](http://www.leg.state.or.us/findlegsltr/)  [Contact info for all legislators is here.](http://www.leg.state.or.us/index.html) (click through to house or senate)  

And (I'll save you the bold): contact the media.  

Hey Occupy- the bulk of your organization tools are about to be outlawed.  I urge you- just one of you at no specific time or location- to act now.

EDIT: corrected Bill Tracking link (Thanks Dry_Hopped)

EDIT#2:  I am wrong about intent.  I was confused about the ""defendant intended for specific persons to
engage in the criminal activity"" language.  Does this mean if I post (right here to r/portland, lets say) ""Hey Larry, go get drunk and bomb down from the zoo at 11pm""- but Carl reads it and zoo bombs instead- both Carl and I are charged?",,False,self,t5_2qi2i,True,,,True,t3_pcche,http://www.reddit.com/r/Portland/comments/pcche/twenty_year_prison_sentence_for_tweeting_sb_1534/,

Please Read.",180,22,46,http://www.reddit.com/r/Portland/comments/1ckxt9/did_any_of_you_happen_to_know_james_aka/,"This afternoon, my friend James Powers passed away after a long battle with cancer. He was an avid redditor (one of the first I ever met) and techie and was someone I owe a monumental amount of gratitude towards. I realize the issue with posting names but I think in this context it's not harmful.

Quick story time:

I met James completely out of the blue a few years ago. I had only recently registered an account on reddit, and had responded to a post about a couple wanting to do a meetup at Lucky Devil Lounge for the user's boyfriend's birthday. I responded with a mention that I had recently gone through a very hard break-up and that had gotten me pretty melancholy and not excited about anything. I ended up meeting that couple at LD and had a great evening. When I got home, a PM from James was waiting in my inbox. We exchanged messages throughout our busy schedules but eventually we managed to meet up and hang.

Our hanging session consisted of him taking me out to dinner, fixing my computer (and he taught me so much about computers), relaxing with Coronas and trees that he brought over, giving me an 8th of some amazing green, and commiserating with me about life, relationships, and everything.

Why? ""I just saw your comment and thought you could use a friend.""

That was James in a nutshell.

He truly was one of the most influential persons I have ever met. He just filled me with so much hope for everyone. Looking at some of the recent posts on r/portland and remembering posts detailing how hard it is to ""make friends in this city"", James stood out as a testament to what a positive attitude could do for you and those around you.

I was just wondering if anyone else may have a story to tell about him as I know he wasn't the only friend he made off of /r/portland that changed my life in a positive way. 

Have stories to tell? Please post them here in this thread. I know he regularly helped out many redditors with whatever.  If you'd like to get details about his memorial. please PM me and I can send you details as things get figured out. 

To everyone, I hope you have a beautiful evening in our wonderful city and make smiles and connections happen. I know I've benefited from both, and am eternally grateful towards everyone that brings em.

Drivers here are more cautious, use turn signals better, and are generally more courteous and patient than other places I've lived.  Granted, this is more of an indictment of those other areas rather than a compliment to Portland, but from someone who has long repeated the joke, ""I've been all over the world, and wherever I go I find that the world's worst drivers have followed me there!"" this is the highest praise I've ever given to an area.

However, please please please turn your headlights on.  Not *just* when it's raining or when it's very dark, but every time you get in the car.  Don't rely on auto-lights; please just turn your headlights on.  Yes, even when it's clear and sunny - I may have the sun in my mirror and your headlights are the only thing I can see.  Headlights always make your vehicle more visible.  (Note: this does not mean it is appropriate to drive with your high beams on whenever you feel like it.  If you can't see the road with your low beams, you need to have your lights or your eyes checked.)

I don't understand why even at night I still see dozens of cars driving around without headlights - even the police!  It's just one little switch and it will protect you and others more than you know.

Thanks for reading.  Drive safely!",,False,self,t5_2qi2i,False,,,True,t3_opbyz,http://www.reddit.com/r/Portland/comments/opbyz/a_word_from_your_friendly_local_bus_driver/,

Predditors, I get it. You're unique and that's great. However, you need to take into account that there needs to be a respect for the cause. The cause in this case is occupy Portland. If you go to an interview, you dress appropriately for the occasion. At a funeral, you dress out of respect for another person. Stop thinking about your goddamn fucking selves for just one moment and think about people on a whole. This is about the 99%, not your individualism. You don't have to wear a suit, but dress in accordance to the audience that you are attempting to affect. It's about the 99%, not just about you and your individualism and how you express it through your appearance.

1354753385.0,138,self.Portland,14cr3t,"PPB answers the most important question of the year: ""I really want to go to Washington and get high. What's the safest way to do it?""",169,31,74,http://www.reddit.com/r/Portland/comments/14cr3t/ppb_answers_the_most_important_question_of_the/,"Just saw this email from the PPB, answering some questions about the new WA law to legalize marijuana. Thought you guys might appreciate it, there are parts that are pretty funny.

&gt;Washington voters have passed Initiative 502 and beginning on Thursday December 6, 2012, it is not a violation of Washington state law for adults over 21 years old to possess up to an ounce of marijuana (or 16 ounces of solid marijuana-infused product, like cookies, or 72 ounces of infused liquid, like oil) for personal use. The initiative establishes a one-year period for the State of Washington to develop rules and a licensing system for the production and sale of marijuana.

&gt;While legal in the State of Washington beginning on December 6, Oregon law has not changed with regards to marijuana possession, distribution or manufacturing.

&gt;It's important though to understand that under Oregon law, possession of less than one ounce of marijuana is classified as a violation. It is not a criminal offense and people cannot be arrested or jailed for possession of less than one ounce of marijuana.

&gt;Possession of Less than One Ounce of Marijuana has been a low law enforcement priority for 35 years in Portland and this will not change due to the new Washington law.

&gt;What is NOT a low law enforcement priority is Driving Under the Influence of Intoxicants (DUII). DUII enforcement remains a high priority for the Portland Police Bureau.

&gt;Much like existing fireworks laws, what is legal in Washington is not legal in Oregon, In other words, if it goes high in the air or gets you high, you should probably use it in the Evergreen State.

&gt;Some important questions and answers about the Oregon impact of the new Washington Law:

&gt;- I have an Oregon Medical Marijuana Program card. Can I bring marijuana into Oregon from Washington?

&gt;Yes. The Oregon Medical Marijuana Program allows for card holders to possess certain amounts of marijuana. It does not dictate where card-holders can get it and there are no changes to the Oregon Medical Marijuana Program because of Washington I-502.

&gt;- I live in Washington but drove to Portland to visit friends. Can I carry my marijuana with me?

&gt;No. Possession of Less than One Ounce of Marijuana in Oregon is a violation and you may be subject to a citation, similar to a traffic ticket.

&gt;- Does this mean I can smoke pot in parks or at cafes if I go to Washington?

&gt;No. While Portland Police do not prioritize enforcing the citations of less than an ounce of marijuana, smoking pot in public spaces is strictly enforced. Don't do it. Even under the new law in Washington, you are not allowed to smoke marijuana in public. Washington is developing rules and a licensing system for the production and sale of marijuana, which may eventually lead to the existence of cafes or businesses where smoking pot is allowed. Until then, if you must consume pot, then do so in the privacy of a residence.

&gt;- Can I get a violation for being stoned?

&gt;Unless you are operating a vehicle (bicycles included), you cannot be cited for consumption of Marijuana.

&gt;- What happens if I get pulled over and an officer thinks I've been smoking pot?

&gt;If an officer believes you're driving under the influence of a controlled substance, they will conduct a field sobriety test and may consult with a drug recognition expert. If officers establish probable cause, they will bring you to a precinct and ask your permission to draw your blood for testing. If officers have reason to believe you're under the influence of a controlled substance, they can get a search warrant for a blood draw from a judge.

&gt;In a serious injury crash, if law enforcement suspects that the driver is impaired by drugs or alcohol, officers will apply for a search warrant to draw and test the driver's blood.

&gt;It's important to know that Driving Under the Influence IS a criminal offense in Oregon and those driving under the influence of marijuana or other drugs can be arrested and jailed for DUII-Drugs.

&gt;While DUII-Alcohol is generally when a driver's Blood Alcohol Content (BAC) is .08 or more, there is not the same threshold for marijuana or other drugs.

&gt;The threshold for DUII-Drugs is ""impaired to a perceptible degree.""

&gt;- I really want to go to Washington and get high. What's the safest way to do it?

&gt;Get a designated driver, take public transit, or plan to stay the night in Washington.

&gt;- Can I ride my bike to Washington to smoke some weed?

&gt;Yes, but you can still get a DUII-Drugs while riding a bicycle.

&gt;- Will the Feds arrest me in Washington if I buy some weed?

&gt;Marijuana is still a ""Schedule I Drug"" under federal law and marijuana possession and sale remains illegal under federal law. The Portland Police Bureau cannot predict or control the enforcement activities of federal authorities.",,False,self,t5_2qi2i,False,,,True,t3_14cr3t,http://www.reddit.com/r/Portland/comments/14cr3t/ppb_answers_the_most_important_question_of_the/,

I have seen a recent upsurge in mass-downvoting, negative comments, and misuse of the report button.  This really has to stop, ESPECIALLY the report button.  It's not a super-downvote, all it does is send a message to the mods to look at the person's comment or post.  95 times out of 100, that comment or post falls within the rules of reddit and r/portland.  So it gets reapproved and nothing changes.  What really bothers me is that a couple users are being targeted specifically, having every comment in a given thread reported.  Not only does this make more work for the mods (well, not work, it takes about 5 seconds to click ""Approve"" four times) but it does nothing towards the person you report.  I'm not going to remove someone's comments just because you don't agree with their opinion.  ONLY USE THE REPORT FEATURE WHEN A PERSON'S COMMENT OR POST IS IN DIRECT VIOLATION OF THE R/PORTLAND RULES OR REDDIQUETTE.

So I want all of you to [read the r/portland rules](http://www.reddit.com/r/Portland/comments/qktk3/faq_thread_the_rules/) and [reddiquette](http://www.reddit.com/wiki/reddiquette) again, and follow them in your posting, commenting, voting, and reporting ways.

Also, the mods have been pretty lenient about allowing negative and sometimes borderline-abusive comments through, in the interest of free speech.  That's going to stop.  While we're still not going to be heavy handed, the limit to which we'll extend the rules will be shortened.  This goes especially for negative comments in threads posted by people asking for advice about moving here/jobs/schooling.  If you want to direct those people to the wiki or sidebar, that's fine.  But insults will result in having your comment deleted, and repeat violations will get you banned.  Negative and abusive comments make the entire city and this subreddit look bad.  We already have a reputation on reddit for being populated by xenophobic jerks, let's not prove them right or perpetuate anything.

I know this isn't the majority of you, that most of you post and comment well within the rules and are quite happy to do so.  To all of you, thanks for making r/portland awesome.  This message is meant for the few misanthropes ([deleted], is that you?)who are making Portland look bad for whatever reasons they have.  So please, try to be a little more courteous and polite.

EDIT:  I'm going to guess that reporting this post was a joke, since you're reporting it to me.

I don't want to put him down, looking for a loving home in the Portland, OR area (or within a few hundred miles)  [x-post from r/self]",170,44,180,http://www.reddit.com/r/Portland/comments/rrc83/reddit_my_heart_is_breaking_i_have_to_make_the/,"[Here he is](http://imgur.com/a/aTKh0)

He is a ten year old German Shepherd named Dep. My family got him as a puppy during Spring Break of 2002. We inherited the dog when my parents divorced and each moved on. My sister, a vet student, was supposed to take care of him as soon as she got her own place (she was living with me and my wife at the time). When she moved in with her boyfriend she claimed she could not take the dog with her. She then got a Bull Mastiff a few weeks later.

We kept the dog and he became a part of our life. I finally got my first piloting job in Oregon last year. We moved with my wife from Oklahoma and brought Dep with us. Hardship ensued, my wife was unable to find a job and my starting pay as a pilot does not really cut it. She has finally found a job, but it is back in Oklahoma. She leaves in less than a week. She is moving in with her sister and the apartment complex does not allow pets of any kind.

As a pilot, I am gone from home on a regular basis. We cannot afford boarding for Dep on a regular basis. We tried looking for an adoption service to help us out, most places have turned us down because of his age, the others would just keep him in a cage for the rest of his life if he does not get adopted. We started considering euthanasia, I don't want to do it, but I think it would be more humane than for him to live the rest of his life in a cage away from his family.

My heart is breaking, I want a good home for him, somewhere he can live out the rest of his days happy. As a German Shepherd he is a very active, smart, loving, loyal dog. He is also very protective and does not like other dogs, at all. He has lived most of his life with cats, so he is capable of getting used to them. He also does shed, right now he is shedding his winter coat and has chunks of hair falling!

We live in the Portland, OR area and are willing to drive quite a distance to get him to a new home. Please Reddit, I have seen you guys help so many people, I hope this pulls at your heart strings and help me out.

The Salvation Army is a Christian organization, and because of this fact, they do not have to report what they do with the money they collect. It makes it very difficult to determine what your charitable contribution goes toward. While it is true that the Salvation Army has used hundreds of millions of dollars toward disaster relief over the years, it is also true that their primary mission is to convert people to Christianity. If your aim is to help the needy, there are better organizations to give your cash to.

It is also true that the Salvation Army is vocally anti-gay rights. Personally, that's a deal-breaker for me. 

Rather than just dumping money in the red kettle, if you're really keen on giving money out this season, hit up charitynavigator.com and find a charity that suits you. I've always been a big fan of Direct Relief. 98% of its money goes directly to people in need, but because of that, it can't afford to do commercials or to hire bell-ringers.

They're bonded, that's it.  If you're looking for cats to adopt or know someone who is...",154,28,24,http://www.reddit.com/r/Portland/comments/11qbkj/hey_rportland_a_nokill_animal_shelter_i_used_to/,"...then please consider these two!

I know there has to be someone out there.  I worked at [Animal Aid](http://www.animalaidpdx.org/) for about half a year and just left.  I worked as a caregiver, which was all the dirty work, so I got to know the cats well.  They're trying their best to adopt out this bonded pair of cats that came from a hoarder.

I'm sure you're wondering what the problem is, why they want them adopted out so fast, and if they have any health/behavioral problems (they don't, really).

I'll go over the details here:

Names: [Hoagie](http://www.animalaidpdx.org/pets/displayPet.php?candidateId=585) and [Olivia](http://www.animalaidpdx.org/pets/displayPet.php?candidateId=584) (Note: I'm pretty sure Olivia is at least part Bengal, as I own one.  But it's impossible to know, as her previous owner was a hoarder who didn't really keep track :/)

The first one, Hoagie, is a giant dufus.  He's extremely sweet but will scrounge for food--he had to since he was living with a hoarder before.  Because of which, he is separated when all the cats eat or he'll find food left out.  

The second one, Olivia, is too smart for her own good. She is extremely playful but can get a bit overexcited. You just have to be sure she wants to be pet.   Otherwise, she's extremely sweet.  She is, however, also extremely smart and mischievous. They had to get a special lock for the latched door she was originally in because, after days of trying, she figured out how to unlatch it. 

The only real problem with these two is that they cannot be separated (separating bonded cats can be devastating) and Olivia hates other cats. She's kind of like badass with a heart of gold for her huge dufus buddy Hoagie.  Because of this, they need their own room.  Space is a bit limited.  

They don't actually know I'm making this post as I left them a month ago.  I do know these two still aren't adopted out and having interacted with them multiple times a week, I'm perplexed as to why not.

Anyways, I'm sure someone out there is looking to adopt some cats.  These guys are only a few years old, a comedic pair, Olivia is fun to play with, and Hoagie is just a giant ball of love.

I've posted on here a few times in the past, seeing if people would be down to meet up for brunch. And i've met some pretty cool people and gained some good friends from it. 

But one qualm that i've heard a lot about, is that people feeling uneasy about jumping into a group of people who were already friends. Almost everyone already knew each other, and the new people would feel like the ""odd-man"" out. 

SO! I want to even the footing by inviting anyone who reads this to come grab brunch with me on Sunday! It will just be myself and any Redditors who read this and want to join, etc. We'll grab brunch at Montage! We can grab some drinks, get some food, and get to know each other.

Send me a PM, or post below. I'll give you the deets and figure out some line of communication with you for this weekend; cell phone, smoke signal, messenger penguin, etc. 

**TL;DR: Come grab brunch with me and other redditors this Sunday (6/3), we'll all be new and we can be strangers together.**

*Edit 1: Also, some stuff about me (Just got a PM asking): 25 year old male, went to PSU for science-y stuff, have traveled all over the place, have a rabid obsession with anything Zelda related, I love planning events, I enjoy fitness and exercise regularly, have gone to PAX every year, played WoW an embarassing amount of time, I also enjoy long walks on the beach, and roasting whole turkeys.*

*Edit 2: (Answering another PM) All ages are welcome to the place I had in mind, so don't be shy. I want to hang out with all of you!*

*Edit 3: I'll have something to designate our table, and if you guys are down to swap cell numbers I can keep in contact via text.*

*Edit 3.5: I will have a sombrero to designate our table at Montage!*

*Edit 4: In case it hasn't be clarified to the masses, brunch will happen at Montage, Sunday the 3rd of June at noon! This thing is blowin' up!* 

*Edit 5: Also, for the love of teeny, tiny 8lb., 6oz. baby Jesus, please bring cash! Card will work, but cash will make the payment process SO much easier. And I think they only do X amount of cards per table. Just something to keep in mind.*

I came to the stop sign at NE 17th and a white van slowly came up to the intersection and stopped. They had the right of way, so I pointed at the stop sign. They both looked at me kinda blankly so I pointed with both hands at the sign and said ""look, I have a stop sign, you can go!"" Then van pulls into middle of intersection, guy jumps out passenger door and yells ""are you getting lippy with me faggot?"" and charges at me with, I shit you not, a hammer. I start my escape but he caught me on the back with a hammer swing. Luckily I was carrying a huge bag full of hard stuff and the hammer blow didn't do any noticeable damage. I sped off down Sumner, planning on turning onto 14th Pl because it deadends there for automobiles. The guys in the van followed me and ran the stop sign at 15th and Sumner, but I was able to get onto Killingsworth well before they got close to me again.

White van, no windows, WA plates, 2 very normal looking white guys with white t-shirts.

It's the craziest shit that's ever happened to me while on my bike or since I've lived in Portland. I spent the entire class afterwards imagining ways I could've Jackie Chan'd them with my u-lock or my bike polo mallets. I'm glad I didn't though. They probably had other tools in the van.

**edit/update:**

I spoke with John from bikeportland and there'll be something posted there about it. I don't plan on taking any other action concerning this, I don't feel like the police response was inappropriate. They probably took what I said and put it into the computer or whatever, but I doubt that anything will come of it and I understand why they would think so too. I'm content with the outcome of the situation (thank you polo bag!) and I'll make an extra effort to be courteous and avoid being condescending when motorists exercise their 'right of stay' at an intersection. Although I've been rude in other similar situations, I didn't think that I was in this case. I'm still going to try to be nicer anyway. Maybe folks won't attack me with hammers then.

Call RideOn Portland!,142,28,47,http://www.reddit.com/r/Portland/comments/13orvs/drinking_this_holiday_season_call_rideon_portland/,"Hello Predditors! I'm the new Volunteer Coordinator for RideOn Portland and wanted to let you know about our awesome service.

[RideOn Portland](http://rideonportland.org/) is a designated driver service. So say you drive to a friends Christmas party, you drink more than you thought you would, and when the party is winding down you feel like you probably shouldn't drive. You can call RideOn and we'll drive to you, then drive you and your car home! No waiting for a late night bus in the rain, no paying for a cab back home then back to your friends house in the morning, no worrying about getting a ticket if you parked downtown. Its a drive home in your own car for $15 (plus tip for your lifesavers).

And since I'm the volunteer coordinator I can't go without asking for more volunteers. We need at least 5 volunteers each night to operate under the demand for our service. As I said above, DD's earn tips that are split with the other volunteers at the end of the night. Volunteers who drive their own cars also earn gas money back.

So! If you're drinking and need a ride from us, call 503-235-7433.

If you want to volunteer with us, email me at volunteer@rideon.com

Thanks r/Portland! Stay safe out there!",,False,self,t5_2qi2i,False,,,True,t3_13orvs,http://www.reddit.com/r/Portland/comments/13orvs/drinking_this_holiday_season_call_rideon_portland/,

But it's gotten so cold that I can barely sleep in my car. And the seat doesn't recline completely so I'm also waking up with incredible back pain.

Its also making me very depressed and I'm begging you for help. I've tried shelters but they work on a lottery system nightly and do not have a place to park my car.

I recently stayed with another predditor and I can have him talk to you as a reference. I'm clean and courteous.

Please the thought of trying to sleep in my car is making me cry, and I'm desperate. Ill do any chores you want done. 

Please if you have never been in my situation don't post about how I am stupid and such. Unfortunately I don't have parents I can live with.

Little info about me: I'm 21 (22 on December 1st) I only have a couple hobbies which are guitar and leagueoflegends. I havent really been doing either very much. I am really good with computers. I have a job and I am looking for another.

Please help. I know ill get downvoted, but please reconsider, I'm just looking for a warm place for a month.",,False,self,t5_2qi2i,False,,,True,t3_13vmdc,http://www.reddit.com/r/Portland/comments/13vmdc/hey_rpdx_ive_been_sleeping_in_my_car_for_the_past/,

He got it out of her that she had been kicked out of the Hawthorne Theater for being too loaded, and her brother who she went with didn't bother to try to get her home because: ""He already paid $60 to get in, find your own way home."". We decided that the best course of action would be to get her a cab home.

I called a friend that drives for Radiocab, he's off. Call dispatch, find out her name and destination, cab is on the way.

Meantime housemate asks me to go hang so he can eat dinner.

Cab gets there, I help her off my porch, and over to the cab. I gave the driver a heads up: ""I have no idea who she is, she showed up on my porch loaded, and needs to get to Hillsbobro."" I gave him a $20 for part of the fare and she insisted she could pay when he gets her home.

Off they go, and I go about my night. went to bed, and my phone lit-up, which I ignored. 

This morning I woke up to a voice mail from the driver: ""I got her home, she was butt wasted so I helped her get to her door, and unlocked it. She went inside, shut the door, locked it, and wouldn't answer to pay me. I have her keys, I left them in the Radiocab Supervisors office at the central garage. If you know how to get a hold of her tell her where they are.""

So if anyone knows a young lady with shoulder length blonde hair by the name of Summer who lives in Hillsboro, let her know she owes Radiocab money and needs to pay to get her keys back.

**TL;DR: If you know Summer from Hillsboro that got kicked out of the Hawthorne, let her know where her keys are. And let her brother know that he is a douche for not making sure she was safe.**",,False,self,t5_2qi2i,1351819369.0,,,True,t3_12grdi,http://www.reddit.com/r/Portland/comments/12grdi/halloween_drunks_radiocab/,
1337225578.0,109,self.Portland,tr43o,Bikers - please don't run over pedestrians on sidewalks.,158,49,384,http://www.reddit.com/r/Portland/comments/tr43o/bikers_please_dont_run_over_pedestrians_on/,"Guys, I love the usage of Bikes around Portland. Bravo on riding more and driving less, we are winning as a green city. Bike lanes are plenty and great.

However, sidewalks are a pedestrian right-of-way zone. Especially when there is a bike path one block over.

I write this as my wife was run into (again) today while walking home on 39th. The biker, frustrated by us walking came up behind us and actually rubbed his front tire on her leg to get her to move out of the way. The sidewalk in question is narrow (on Chavez / 39th), crowded by shrubs, and there is no way to move without going into traffic. To move we would have had to dive into the bushes, or stepped into the street - in traffic moving 35mph.

 Anyhow, now she is bleeding as a result of the friction burn. Totally unacceptable. But she did give his buddy an earful. Honestly, it shouldn't have come to that, people shouting in public at each-other. We shouldn't have had to have a face-off there on 39th about right-of-ways. There shouldn't be a girl with a bleeding leg as a result.

I'm a biker... and a walker... and as both I have to say that pedestrians getting forced off sidewalks on the busier streets by bikers is becoming an epidemic.  It seems every time we walk down 39th, Division, or Hawthorne someone is bombing down the sidewalk shouting at people to move.

Please.... fellow riders, lets think a little - and realize that we fought for the rights to be treated as traffic, and as such we are now traffic. As traffic, this means that sidewalks are not acceptable zones if Pedestrians are present, and the Pedestrian always has the right-of-way.

As many of you know, we have a Portland website. Anyone who posted a link to our site got it knocked down. Regardless of content; even when the links were interviews with the head of Timbers marketing, with Ben Huh/CEO of ICanCheezburger when he came to town, etc. We even had an interview set up with the founder of reddit on his visit to Portland, but it fell through. The funny thing would have been that an interview with the founder would have not allowed here...amazing.

These posts were obviously not SPAM, but were marked as such. We would get announcements for big stories and put it up and it would get knocked down. The EXACT same story would appear at another source hours or days later and was allowed to stay up and get voted on.

I appealed to the mod and even bought an ad through reddit for our new events app only to have my money seemingly stolen as even the ad got knocked down. **Then, in an email, I found out why.**

Below are the messages I received asking me for money and basically showing that it isn't SPAM the mod was concerned about: it was his own pockets.

How's it going? I'm sorry for the slow reply. I'm still thinking about how we can help each other. Perhaps we can come up with some revenue sharing agreement if we help promote PDX Pipeline on /r/portland. I'd like to think about something we can do in 2012. I believe that /r/portland is one of the most popular Portland forums on the Internet. On average we receive 10,000 visitors per day of which 2 - 3k of those are unique visitors.

**Response by me (wondering what was happening here)**

Hello,

It's an interesting idea for sure. Let us know when you'd like to discuss this and we can meet up for coffee or a beer and discuss it.

--------

**December 5**

I have a few ideas off the top of my head. The first would be a sponsored permalink on the sidebar. The second is that we could have a section on our popular sidebar for when you have a special event or promo that deserves extra attention. Another idea is that for certain events.. perhaps we could generate interest in PDXpipeline by offering giveaways for some of the tickets that you always offer on your site and have an insertion order for how long these promos or giveaways would run on the sidebar. I'm sure we can come up with some other ideas. I created r/portland several years ago and it's just grown so large. It's a good way to reach local people of a certain genre that are impossible to reach by more traditional advertising means.

I think the PDXpipeline is one of the best event sites on the web for Portland. There have been a few which have launched over the last year like BePortland.com, and others. But I still think you're the best.

**-------------------------------------------**

So, as we can see with the compliments to our site, it was not that we had SPAM content and were just submitting it. The mod likes the site and thinks it's one of the best...so good, that he even had a plan to take our money. 

I guess the real problem is our smaller size gave an actual contact and face to rob and falsely sending our site to SPAM was the way to do it. Hypocrisy indeed.",,False,self,t5_2qi2i,False,,,True,t3_ol7nf,http://www.reddit.com/r/Portland/comments/ol7nf/the_extortion_of_rportland/,
