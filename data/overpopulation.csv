Been called names? Why do people mostly seem to just freak out at the merest suggestion that population control is a good idea? At different times I've mentioned it in conversation and was called evil, a racist, a communist, a hateful bitch, a supporter of eugenics and genocide, etc. My youngest cousin (he's 28) *laughed at me* for saying every problem that affects society as a whole has its' roots in the fact that there are just too many people. I guess I should have expected to hear something like that from a lifelong Jehovah's Witness, (FWIW, I'm an atheist.) but my cousin is smart and always was a pretty open-minded guy so that blindsided me.

But anyway, the knee-jerk reactions I've gotten from talking about overpopulation really baffle me. Even if I get a chance to explain that I'd like to see efforts to reduce the worldwide birth rate come in the form of tax breaks and other financial incentives for childless people, especially everyone who has themselves permanently sterilized before they have a child...I still get made out to be crazy, evil or some sort of hater. Of course I already know there are many programs all over the world that educate people on the advantages of having fewer or no children and dispense free birth control to people who otherwise wouldn't have access to it, but that needs to be stepped up in a big way if it's going to be effective. I just can not get my head around the reason why so many people think any effort to to slow down our population growth means doing horrifying, evil things like forced abortions, infanticide or forced sterilization. Probably the only time I can calm people down is if they say something like, ""Well how many kids do *YOU* have? Maybe *YOU* should be sterilized if you're going to tell everyone else to do it!"" They always get quiet and mumble, ""Oh..."" when I tell them I don't have any kids and I had my tubes tied 10 years ago.

Is it really common for people who support population reduction efforts to be vilified or am I just doing it wrong?",,False,self,t5_2qyln,False,,,True,t3_hlu6h,http://www.reddit.com/r/overpopulation/comments/hlu6h/curbing_population_growthwhy_is_the_idea_so/,

The situation:
A friend posts a link to an article called [No Kidding: Why is It ""Selfish"" to Be Childfree?](http://bitchmagazine.org/post/no-kidding-why-is-it-%E2%80%9Cselfish%E2%80%9D-to-be-childfree)

My response was just to her and knew she would find it funny (and true): ""I've always thought that due to overpopulation it was selfish to *have* kids..""

One of her friends (Michael) chimes in with: ""The US is FAR from overpopulated...""

Me: ""You'd be surprised Michael, here is a little reading if your interested: http://www.npg.org/faq.html 
I hope it helps.""

The OP: ""Thanks for the FAQs, Mindy. I always felt the same about contributing to an already overpopulated planet. Just like pets, more people should adopt children."" 

Michael: ""Drive Cross Country, Look at all the Unused Land, and Under Developed Land. We Have TONS of space to grow.
Heck, Id even Argue that your link helps prove this by pointing out How the real problem is People living basically (And Literally) On top of Each other.
Never the Less, Nice Link, Thank you :)""




Now, I am treading very carefully here since I want to say this as clearly and simply as possible... however whenever I start to type a response my mind is just getting flooded with statistical data and environmental reports and projections, nothing that I can seem to fit into laymen terms (I've always had a problem with this).  

So can anyone help me out with some links (focused at United States data preferable), or something that might help me out in my response to him that might actually show him the light?  I wouldn't attempt this if I thought he was beyond helping, but I think I may be able to here.  

Thank you in advance for your assistance.


**Edit** this is what I have written so far:

Hmm, I guess my career kind of makes me look at this differently (I'm a wildlife ecologist)... okay, think of it this way: Each person doesn't just need the land they are standing on to survive; they need land for farms, land to collect fuel, land to hold their waist, land to grow their wood... etc.  Everything you touch has to have come from somewhere, and that all takes up a LOT of space.  

As for the land currently NOT being used by humans, it's about the only place left for the wild things to grow.  Right now I'm working on a federally endangered species called the Houston Toad... I'll give you one guess what caused it to go on that list.  Houston is it's home turf, and it is WAY to over populated for things like this to survive.  But most people don't care if some little old frog dies as long as they get a new house right?  Well, that's a whole new discussion about keystone species and ecosystem balance.... I'll just let you know, they were what kept Houston's mosquito population in check, now the mosquitoes are running wild with not a lot to stop them (those trucks with the spray don't do squat compared to what those toads did, but we are working to bring them back asap)



(Will put a paragraph connecting these thoughts here)

Sure, India and China are examples of people living on top of each other, but frankly, I'm happy living in a country that has slowed our population growth to a point that doesn't mean we HAVE to start living ontop of each other, we get our space, and I want to keep it that way.  We even have the luxury of going outside to play... to keep this lifestyle we will have to slow our consumption, to slow our consumption we need to slow our production of consumers, and well, that means protected sex I guess... less babies is better for all of us.

I thought it would make a good boiler plate posting as well:

**Current Population:**  [7.10 billion people](http://tinyurl.com/currentpopulation)

**World fertility rate for population replacement:**[2.33 children per woman](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sub-replacement_fertility)

&gt;According to the United Nations, the global population could be as high as 11 billion in 2050 or as low as 8 billion, if the right programs are put in place now.  Population growth stretches natural resources to their limits. Deforestation, food and water shortages, and climate change are all intensified by the addition of nearly 80 million people a year to the world's population.
