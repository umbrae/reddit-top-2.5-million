1371016797.0,61,self.xbox,1g6hnk,I know I'm probably the 1% but...,101,40,131,http://www.reddit.com/r/xbox/comments/1g6hnk/i_know_im_probably_the_1_but/,"While I do not support the concepts that Microsoft decided to introduce, they don't directly effect me, and many games like me. Other than the few periods where I do not have internet connection, I always have my xbox connected to the internet, my Kinect is always plugged in - mainly because I'm too lazy to unplug it and I use the voice control for netflix - Without a blockbuster or any rental place (other then a redbox) I never rent games. I hardly ever sell my games back and rarely buy them used. If I really want a game that I cannot afford I wait until the price drops or there is a sale. I understand that my situation may be different than others, but for most of the people I know, this is what we deal with. 

Again, I do not support what Microsoft is doing, but it's not as bad as it seems. A lot of hype is being produced, and everyone wants to support the popular opinion, so even more hype is being produced.

When I look at the main issues, this is what I believe: 

- I feel that - Much like movies/music on iTunes - there will probably be a limit of times a game can be transferred. Essentially, you will get a, ""You can now access this game on 4 other machines"" notification. Does this suck? Sure... knowing xbox's track record you will probably have to buy a new xbox later and it will cause you to have ""3 other machines"". Or if you are like some people with more than one xbox that number will drop again. But honestly how many xbox's do you use one game on. Also, so what if there is a re-up fee for used games. Chances are that places that sell the game will either include the price in the purchase, or dock the cost to match the fee.   

- With the inability to trade games, I'm sure Microsoft will introduce a cloud gaming/rental program like onlive, either have a monthly rental cost or allow one rental a month with live or something. They have boasted so much about their cloud gaming, I'm sure that you will be able to stream games just as easily as you stream music or movies. For PC gamer, such as myself, having a 1 shot copy for a game is nothing new. Hell, When I wanted to play Star Craft after a 5 year absence, I went online and bought a new access code for $5...did I bitch and whine... yeah...a little, but once I started playing I didn't care, it was still cheaper than buying a new copy! I feel that more and more the game disc itself will be little more than just data, while the actual game will be cloud based.

- The main reason having access to the internet is so important is because it seems that Microsoft is trying to remove some ""planned obsolescence"" from their games by allowing for the feature of streaming games. They talk about how a majority of the processing for Forza 5 will take place via the cloud processor. The reason you need to be connected is so that you can continue to have next gen graphics on their current system. I've used the Onlive service, which allowed me to play Batman Arkham Asylum and Borderlands on my 3 year old tablet thanks to cloud gaming. Their ""If you don't have internet, don't get the Xbox one"" was not them being snarky, but rather introducing the fact that the internet simply is the wave of the future. Look at the impact Xbox Live has had on the 360 (from when the 360 first came out until now). Everything from Smart Glass to Netflix, let alone game DLC NEEDS an internet connection...this is nothing new!

- As for the Kinect always being connected...being plugged in and being on are two different things. I always have my webcam plugged into my computer, but it is not always filming me! (or is it NSA?) But I also do not spew commands to my webcam. It seems that A LOT of what Xbox one will do is use kinect for basic functions that will not be directly accessible through a controller. During the E3 conference, they showed the speaker call up Twitch while playing her game via Kinect. This can only be done if the kinect is on. Turning the xbox on and off with the kinect requires the kinect to be plugged in. This is also why they are packaging the Kinect with the system. While I agree that the Kinect should not be required, I feel that a majority of the console's programming is based of the Kinect. Simply put, removing the Kinect would be like unplugging your desktops mouse or keyboard. While you may still be able to access what you need without either of these, it sure is handy to have them plugged in. 

Again, I DO NOT support the actions Microsoft has taken, but not for the reasons most do. My biggest concern is for people, like Troops deployed overseas, who may not have internet access. But at the same time, I feel that with the launch of a new 360, Microsoft will probably produce one title for both systems, but it may lose some of the features due to being a previous gen console. 

Are the issues? Yes! But we still have almost half a year before we can even buy one of these machines. Chances are some things will change, but at the same time, a lot might stay the same.

Just my 2¢

1371142827.0,47,self.xbox,1ga0wv,XBOX-ONE's PR solution is simple (X-POST from /games),57,10,31,http://www.reddit.com/r/xbox/comments/1ga0wv/xboxones_pr_solution_is_simple_xpost_from_games/,"All Microsoft has to do is announce that they will have two forms of DRM... 24 hour check in for hard-drive installed games, and DISC DRM for offline gaming. Simple. Customers love choice, and that seems like an easy way to have both paradigms in place without pissing off the customers or the publishers.


Publishers will have the same kind of security that the PS4 will offer with their DISC DRM, and people that don't care about 24 hour online check in will be able to play in a disc free environment (a feature PS4 isn't touting right now, and may not offer).


If they really wanted to get back on equal footing with the price, they'd either offer a free digital download coupon that would be good for ANY game over the next 6 months after launch (a virtual bundle, if you will), OR... just drop the price down to $450. I don't think many people would think much of a $50 difference (or at least not as optically displeasing as a $100 difference).
Right now it's a PR game and Sony is kicking butt. That said, everyone loves a good backlash, so it wouldn't take many moves for Microsoft to at least do decent damage control, and possibly start that backlash (even a small one) against the popular kid Sony.


I have a feeling Microsoft is frantically going over contracts with game publishers and retailers to weigh their options after the smack down by Sony at E3. It'll just take time to figure out what they can legally do as their next move.


Or they'll just look at the fact that the XBOXY ONE has already sold out launch day pre-orders as a sign they don't have to do anything but sit back and collect the cash from the Microloyalists. That would be a very big mistake.


As far as the SpyBox diatribes are concerned, I'm not really sure how you reassure paranoid people that somehow think that out of 48 million users they're going to win the spied on lottery, or that Microsoft is going to have some kind of easily accessed back door that their employees can use to spy on customers and potentially leave them open to the biggest liability and lawsuit the world's ever seen if they ever got caught spying on a user when the console was shut off.


I don't think Apple employees are listening or watching me on this always connected camera/microphone device I have in my pocket right now. It would be a massive liability.
It'll be interesting to see how everything shakes out over the next 5 months after Microsoft weighs its options with their partners. 

No matter what though, they've flubbed the first impression, so they shouldn't just play the wait and see game.

My Xbox red ringed today. 

This Xbox was special. I got it my freshman year of highschool (I just finished my freshman year of college). All it was was a little Xbox Classic. I upgraded it over the years with a Hard drive and a wifi attachment. It outlasted the original controllers I had. It never crapped out on me. My parents divorced so I was constantly back and forth and took this thing with me all of the time; despite all the travelling, it never gave me problems. I remember once it red ringed but I turned it off and back on and never had the issue again. Towards the end the disc tray was starting to fail and I had to hit the top to get it to work many times, but it still kept on chuggin'. I began to think it would never die. It gave me some of the best gaming experiences of my life. So that's it. I just wanted to commemorate it somehow.

PS4 doesn't have such restrictions and is subject to markup compensation because of the sale of used games.

Think of the long term costs of buying games for the xbox, which the MSRP could be half price, and compare that to PS4 with the MSRP that will remain at $60.

I'm sure this example has been brought up before, but Steam is a great example of this type of DRM. You are not allowed to trade or sell games to your friends, and all games are distributed digitally, but prices are always set relatively low and new releases can be seen at $40 at launch.

It was a week later when the game that caused the young boy to buy the 360 to be released.

There were features of DRM that I liked (cloud capacity, family sharing and potentially cheaper games). 

However, I'm aware others are not a fan of these.

I propose the solution:

The XB one treats physical copies of games the same way the 360 treats them - must be in the tray to play, can be traded, can be used on other consoles.

The XB one treats digital downloads the way Microsoft initially planned to treat all games- DRM implemented (trading restrictions), family sharing, cloud capacity and CHEAPER

Would anyone buy a physical game for €60 when they could download the digital version for €40 (and a week earlier as an added incentive)? If Microsoft did this everyone would move to digital/DRM models almost instantly. 

This option would allow your gamers in the third world/nuclear subs etc. to still be able to buy the XB one also.

That's $100 right there and can bring the console down to competitive pricing and relieve all the privacy concerns. This is probably the easiest and quickest fix they can do. If they only make one move before release, it should be this. 

* They can keep the online checks, but they need to make it only a once every 30 days check and not a 24 hour check. This is what Steam does and people are fine with it. It's still not ideal but it's much better.

* Address DRM. 

* Come up with a viable lending program before the end of E3 with as little restrictions as possible. Let the consumers designate who they want to lend their game too and for how long, the recipient gets the whole game for however long it's lended to them and then the game goes back to the owner.

1344869919.0,21,self.xbox,y5a9s,A How-To on Cleaning Your Xbox!,26,5,10,http://www.reddit.com/r/xbox/comments/y5a9s/a_howto_on_cleaning_your_xbox/,"I see many people on here with broken systems or wondering how to take care of them, and I always have people asking me both online and IRL on what to do. I've worked on at least 50 Xbox consoles in my spare time just for giggles, I like to repair and mod them for fun. Go figure. Anyways I thought this could really help out some people, so here is my advice on this!

**Let's Start Basic**

What will you need? Let's do a quick cleaning on your system.

* Q-Tips
* 91% Rubbing Alcohol
* Compressed/Canned Air
* An old towel or shirt you don't care about.

But how will we get the system open? Well these will be specifically for a Phat system, but should also work on opening a Slim:

* T6 Screwdriver (You'll only need this if you want to remove the motherboard from the chassis)
* T8 Screwdriver
* Small Flathead Screwdriver
* Small Phillips Head Screwdriver
* A small poking tool (This will be to pop off all the tabs)

You can easily find a guide on how to open up your console online, in fact [here](http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=how+to+open+up+your+xbox+360&amp;oq=how+to+open+up&amp;gs_l=youtube.3.0.0l10.963.3419.0.4456.20.13.1.3.3.0.438.2782.3j5j1j2j2.13.0...0.0...1ac.Mrp-FSx4mRY) is a YouTube search link.

* What you want to do is first blow out as much air as you can from the motherboard, and remove the fans as well and do the same. Use your towel/shirt to clean out any dust from the case, chassis, fans, and fan shroud that you can easily pick out.

* Good? Now run over your whole motherboard with rubbing alcohol and q-tips. Depending on how dirty your console is, this could take quite a lot of q-tips...

**Let's get on that disc drive, shall we?**

* First off: Do not **EVER** blow any air into the disc drive!!!! This is a super easy way to kill it! If you blow air into it thinking you're smart, all the dust particles and such will float around and stick to your laser, which will kill it very fast.

Anyways, let's get the drive open. Use your phillips head screwdriver to get it open, most drives have 4 screws but the Hitachi drives have 6. No big deal.

* If you see any dust on the actual drive casing that you open, wipe it out with that old shirt/towel that you have.

* Now what you want to do is use the q-tips and rubbing alcohol to go over any parts of the disc drive you see getting dirty or gummed up or dusty. Do **NOT** touch your laser with a used tip!

* Flip the drive over and flip the eject mechanism to force open your DVD tray. Clean all the gears and the belt really well.

* If you haven't already, now hit the laser with a CLEAN tip! You should be good to go now.

There. You've pretty much refurbished your Xbox. There is one more step you can take for preventive maintenance regarding the Red Ring of Death, however only do this if you feel comfortable with it!

Do the following ONLY if you feel like it's needed. If your Xbox has been running hotter than normal, or is clean but your fans are starting to get louder, try this out.

**Replacing Thermal Paste**

What will we need?

* [Arctic Silver 5](http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16835100007)

* [Thermal Material Remover](http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16835100010) (I HIGHLY recommend purchasing this!)

* A decent alternative to the remover would be 91% rubbing alcohol (it HAS to be at least 91%, nothing less) and some Goo Gone.

* Q-TIPS!!!!

* Paper Towels

What we'll be doing here is removing the CPU and GPU heatsinks (the two big metal pieces you see in the middle of the motherboard), so first remove ALL the screws on the bottom of the chassis! Pop off the white piece covering the LED lights on your Ring of Light and remove the three T6 screws there as well and then remove the RF board.

Now as for removing the motherboard, grab your GPU heatsink (the taller one on the right) and pull lightly towards you with an upward motion. Your motherboard should come out pretty easily.

Now what are those X things on the bottom? Those are the X-Clamps that fasten down the heatsinks. There is a kit you can buy [here](http://team-xecuter.com/xecuter-unlock-kit-v3/) that includes a special X-Clamp removing tool, but as long as you're CAREFUL you can do it yourself with a very small flathead screwdriver.

What I do is put the flathead into the outer portion of the part where the screw went into, but still inside the clamp, and very gently act like I'm ""digging"" out something. In the middle of the leg of the clamp you're working on, apply a little bit of pressure with your finger. You want to be very careful to not flex your board or bend the x-clamps! At this point I also like to use a small cardboard box (a dryer sheet box I've found is the perfect height on a flat surface) and I keep the motherboard on something like a towel.

It's very annoying, but after doing this quite a few times it becomes easy. If you now have them off undamaged, congrats!

* Now put down that thermal removal solution on each chipset and leave it for at least 5 minutes, do the same to each heatsink where you see any thermal paste. Trust me, you REALLY should buy this stuff instead of Goo Gone and Rubbing Alcohol for this step, it's so much easier.

* Wipe down the heatsinks with a paper towel, and dab the chipsets, then use some q-tips if you want to clean out any little parts left over from the old thermal paste. You might have to do this a few times.

* Next, use the purifier. Same steps. You might need to do this a few times.

* You'll know you're good to go when your chipsets are clean. And I mean **CLEAN**, these need to be super reflective and shiny!

Now on each chip you see apply some Arctic Silver 5, no more than a grain of rice on each one.

**PROTIP**: You don't need to spread it out over the chip! When you put the heatsink back on, it actually mashes it down well enough so that it spreads all over the chipset and covers it evenly. It will be covered 100% once you fasten everything back on.

Once you're good to go, CAREFULLY put everything back together. Just work in reverse here.

Congrats, you've successfully refurbished your Xbox! This is preventive maintenance I do to most of my boxes when I get them in. There is so much more I could cover but I feel like this is good for now.

So about 5 weeks ago I call MS and they said they'd email me with further assistance. Pretty much, all they have said is that they are sorry for the inconvenience and are trying to figure this out. Once a week. 

I've missed out on pretty much every deal in market place and even the Xbox summer game deals. I'm extremely frustrated by this and it doesn't seem to be getting fixed any time soon. 

I don't know what posting here will actually do but I just want to get the word out on how slow Microsoft has been at solving what seems like a tiny problem that was their fault to begin with. 

I've asked for compensation, yet I have gotten none. Perhaps making this public will speed up the process; maybe if Joe Belfiore is lurking or something.

Since I first purchased an Xbox in December of 2004, and switched from a PS2, the Xbox and 360 have been very good to me. In fact, Microsoft has been the only company in recent years that I don't dread having to call for customer support. Like many of you I was excited for the reveal of the next Xbox. I had seen what Sony showed at their first press event in February and came away a little unimpressed. 


What many construed as one of the worst press events in history, I saw as Microsoft's continued failure in social interaction, which has been going on for almost 30 years now. But the XboxOne got me. I hate remotes. I absolutely do. I hate changing inputs, and I hate disks. I know many rely on used games because the prices of new ones have risen exponentially. I however can't stand the used game market, how stores like Gamestop profit off of hard work put in by others, and the individuals who work hard to see their vision come to fruition see less money because of it. 


I can see why the online check-in bothers people, even though this isn't a drawback to me at all. I can see the limitation on sharing games as an issue, even though I prefer digital games that I couldn't share to begin with. I feel that Microsoft will adapt it's software based off of people's concerns, and based off of how it works in the real world, because they've done it so often in the past. 


Sony on the other hand recently rejoined my gaming life in the way of a PS3. I like the design of it, and I love some of the exclusives I've tried (Heavy Rain, MLB the Show) but was disappointed with a few I'd been curious about for some time (Uncharted, Resistance, Infamous). My only complaint about the hardware centers around the controller, which is impossible for me to use for any type of FPS. The software is clunky compared to the 360's but it's not bad. PS+ is a really cool concept, and I'm glad MS is stealing the free games portion. But the PSN has been a pretty bland experience overall, with connectivity problems and disconnects I've never had using Xbox Live on the same connection. 


Sony has decided that it can capitalize on people's fear and confusion over the XboxOne by not advancing the gaming industry. They continue to rely on physical storage, and decided that attacking Microsoft was the best marketing strategy at this time. One thing I've learned about advertising is that mentioning your competitor, even if it's a jab at them, is not a smart move. It's better to ignore their existence because they are irrelevant to selling your product. 


By pricing the console at $399, Sony has determined that continuing to lose money on hardware isn't as important as getting the jump on Microsoft in the marketplace. Sony reminds me a lot at this point of Sega in the 90's, who went out of their way to attack and mock Nintendo at every turn. Over the short term it did help them boost their sales, hell I have a Sega Genesis hooked up to my TV, but Sega was eventually crushed in the marketplace by Nintendo, Sony, and eventually Microsoft, and is now a distant memory in the gaming hardware game. Sega won the battle, but lost the war.


Sony is offering something core gamers are inclined to buy because it's familiar to them. It's a proven fact that we humans don't like change, but change is sometimes needed to progress. The Playstation 4 has seized the day, and has won the battle, at least amongst the hardcore gaming crowd. But as long as Sony continues to pile on debt as they have for the past 7 years, the Xbox will win the war.

I have been playing Black Ops 2 &amp;amp; since receiving a new modem for a new Time Warner service I have been unable to open my NAT, which has led to a sub par online experience.  After watching numerous youtube clips, calling Time Warner Cable, my router (Belkin) company, &amp;amp; going to a Time Warner store to get a new modem model, I have not been able to open the NAT. When I went to the Time Warner Store they did not carry any other models, so I ended up getting the same Arris.  I set it up today with my NAT now open, but an even worse online connection that booted me from the majority of my matches.  I am also unable to connect the Xbox Live directly to the modem, there is a conflict running the Xbox to the wifi router via ethernet, &amp;amp; it does the same over wifi. What is to follow is what I have learned &amp;amp; will hopefully help others.
To start, I am on my 2nd modem, an [Arris TG862G](http://www.amazon.com/Arris-TG862G/dp/B008KRLZCW).  What I have learned from Xbox Live Support is that this model modem for Time Warner services is no good (A steaming pile of crap, if you will).  Per Xbox staff there is a need for a firmware update &amp;amp; this has not happened in the last 5-6 months, this would resolve the issues I am having with connecting to my wifi router, as well as connecting other devices directly to the modem with an ethernet connection.  I spoke with Xbox Live Support staff yesterday who informed me of this, but this fell to the deaf ears of 3 Time Warner staff over the phone, as well as speaking directly to staff at my local Time Warner store.  Finally, I spoke with Xbox Live Support this afternoon &amp;amp; they were more than helpful.  They conference called Time Warner with me to explain the issue &amp;amp; within a matter of minutes I now have a Time Warner technician coming to my house tomorrow morning with a new modem.
Please be aware of the Arris model if you are experiencing any online issues.  The Xbox Live support staff recommends the Motorola models, it sounds like these have little to no issues.
So, I would like to thank the Xbox Live support staff that assisted me this afternoon, as well as yesterday. Both experiences speaking with Xbox staff (I went online &amp;amp; asked XBox Support to call me) were great &amp;amp; they completely empathized with my situation.  I hope this information helps anyone that have run into similar issues.

Sony is a serial drm offended and should not be trusted at the very least, Microsoft should be getting credit for what they are doing. If sony were getting on board with digitally downloaded games and drm, they would have waited until well after the release and just started implementing it slowly. So what can Microsoft do to assuage the fears of their customers?:
1) extended the 24 hour Internet check to 1 week. 
2) use $50 as the suggested msrp for most if not all games. Release classic games from xbox 360 for $10. Show customers that they will be able to play more games for less money.

I'm having a hard time keeping up with all this so I'd just like some simple answers. 

* I'm 16 and I enjoy gaming. I don't have all the time in the world for it, but I might play for about six hours a day, tops. 


* I'd probably be the only one playing it. My sister claims to love video games but she plays them once every few months and they're usually the Lego games. 

* We have pretty steady Internet. It rarely goes out but when it rains really bad we lose it. 

* I know it has to check in at least once a day, and it'd be able to do it. But would there be any problems if it went out for a few seconds at a time?

* What in the hell is DMR and why is it such a big deal?

* A year or so ago I'd say that I'd play lots of games but now I really just play The Elder Scrolls and Fallout. Occasionally, I'll play Minecraft on my computer but stuff like Skyrim and Fallout keep me entertained for months at a time. 

* I know I wouldn't use the Kinect. 

* I loved our PS2 and I loved our 360 even more. We never got a PS3 but I've played it and I honestly don't really like the setup. I just really lean towards XBox. I know I don't owe them anything but I have the feeling that the XBox One is holding something that'll make it worth getting the console. What do you guys think?

One feature I am VERY interested is Xbox One's cloud computing. As far as I can tell, cloud computing will allow developers to allocate a ton of ram to the cloud servers, instead of your Xbox using. Ram used in physics, lighting, etc.

In my mind this is fantastic! That could free up gigs of RAM which could be used for other in-game things. This is a great explanation to the DRM, which doesn't really bother me at all, as I'm always online, and if I'm not I can do other things.

I do believe Reddit is freaking out about some features like used games, DRM, etc. Does anybody agree with me that these are needed for the FUTURE. I know it's cliche and Microsoft keeps using it, but they're right, five years down the road who knows what the tech will be like? I predict developers being able to greatly increase games with cloud computing, which as far as I know is not available on the PS4.

We're calling the ""gaming family"" to make it clear that any of your friends on your friends list qualify for this. You want to restrict it to just blood relatives? Tough titties, this is something you have to do.

Alright, so the video starts with a guy walking up to his couch and sitting down.

""Xbox on""

The xbone turns on and a notification bleeps that Jimbo25 is playing TitanFall. 

""Oh man! Jim got TitanFall! Xbox, open Jimbo25's game library!""

The Xbox opens up Jimbo's game library and shows a bunch of different games. 

""Oh man, he's got The Division too? I'll play that later. Xbox, launch TitanFall.""

The Xbox boots up TitanFall with no hassle, the person starts playing TitanFall and jumps into Jimbo's game. 

From there, you can have Jimbo pop up on Skype and start raving about the game with the guy or discussing whatever other feature. The video ends with a short bullet point list of all the different advantages of the Gaming Family.

This DashClock extension puts your friends list front and center, letting you know who's currently live and ready to play.

This application requires Android 4.2 or higher, and the [DashClock app](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=net.nurik.roman.dashclock&amp;hl=en) to function.

[Here are some screenshots of the app in action](http://imgur.com/a/oPBaz).

This is a first release, so if you spot any bugs please let me know and I'll try to get them fixed as soon as possible. 

Also, I haven't yet had a chance to test the app on phones, so let me know if there are any problems.

NOTE: I mentioned it in the app description, but it's important so I'll mention it here to. **This app will not work if your friends list is set to private.**

If you want to use the app go and set your friends list to be publicly view-able.

This MIGHT help,15,5,6,http://www.reddit.com/r/xbox/comments/ylhhb/got_rrod_and_dont_want_to_mutilate_your_console/,"Yep, your console has 3 little hellish segments to really put a crimp on your day, It's happened to me about 4 times, and I've only been through 2 consoles (2 segments killed my first)

Okay the easiest way to sum up what you do is tricking the system into believing it works. First, turn off the console because those red lights are distressing you. Second, you want to go to the back of the console and remove the HDMI or AV cable from the back of the console. Once you have done this, Turn the console back on. You should see that none of the segments are lit at all. No green, no red, nothing. This is where you trick the system. WITHOUT TURNING OFF THE CONSOLE, reconnect the HDMI/AV cable to the console. If the fates are smiling upon you, the console will boot up as normal, pretty much forgetting it was dead. 

Every time i have had 3 segments of hellish red, this has cleared it up, and funnily enough, it's actually a lasting solution, rather than giving you a few extra precious minutes. As the title said, this MIGHT help, so there is no guarrantee it will work, but it's a method that worked every time i tried it.

Here's an update.,14,2,4,http://www.reddit.com/r/xbox/comments/1j4lxa/posted_a_while_back_about_being_locked_out_of_my/,"I'll backtrack to the reveal of the xbox one where one would get a coupon for $10 for signing up to be notified of the xbox one preorder availability. 

I managed to get my hands on two of those coupon codes and ordered MS points from the MS store. 2 days later I never received a confirmation email and the charges had been removed from my CC account. I let it slide and didn't think much of it. 

Eventually, I tried purchasing Swapchat in the store on my Lumia 920 and received an error saying my purchase couldn't be approved. Eventually I remove my cards and try re-adding them but I got the same error. I tried another day and I got the same problem. So eventually I call MS support to try and see what's going on and get a call saying I would be contacted in a couple days. 

I was contacted but then told that there was suspicious activity on my account and that it had been locked. I was even in contact with Larry Hyrb (majornelson) here and he pointed me to some higher ups. But as of right now I've been told there is nothing they can do to remove the lock on my account and the best solution is to just make a new email. 

I have a Surface, WP8, Win 8 Pc and 2 Xbox consoles all connected to my one account and I am not about to make a new email and lose everything. This has been a terribly frustrating experience and I just can't believe that MS' solution is for ME to make a new account. This is ridiculous and I can't believe a company such as MS with all its bad press lately would fail a loyal customer this badly. I even offered to sign a waiver that would say I accept the consequences of removing the lock but they said no such thing existed. This is ridiculous and I hope you can make light of this some how.

I'm probably one of the biggest MS fans there ever was and it's flat out insulting that I've been treated this way. Even asked if there was some sort of compensation they could give me and they said things didn't work that way. It's been a frustrating 2 months. 

Oh well.

I don't want to spend the (already ridiculous) $14.50 for 1000 points and still be 80 points short. 

I was wondering if there are any offers currently so I can redeem these remaining 80 points? I've now signed up for [Xbox Live Rewards](http://rewards.xbox.com) but I have to wait the 36 hours for approval, and can only get 20 points from their through a ""quick survey"" once approved.

Microsoft is still ripping off customers with this 'points' system, and hopefully it's abolished with the new Xbox.

For reference here are the current prices

     500 Microsoft Points - $7.25
     1000 Microsoft Points - $14.50
     2000 Microsoft Points - $29.00
     5000 Microsoft Points - $72.00
     6000 Microsoft Points - $87.00


**TL;DR: I need 80 points. I can get 20 from rewards.xbox.com, need 60 more. Surveys are expected, I just can't afford to spend $7.25 for an extra 80 points.**

To my confusion, the chief complaints are usually about either the used game issues or about backwards compatibility. 

The way I see it the news that in order to play games (even single player) your console must be online once every 24 hours to check in is a MUCH MUCH bigger problem, potentially even a console killer. Yet it seems to be the least talked about issue. I don't get it. Why?

Take where I live, Missouri. There is NO fiber run here other than the cities. We live in town, thankfully, but you go a mile outside our city and there's nothing but dial-up Internet for a 30 mile radius. And that's not uncommon for Missouri or the Midwest. 

So what, no Xbox One for those people? What about soldiers overseas? What about people who take their console on vacation? My family has a lake house without Internet and our kids bring their consoles sometimes. If we stay longer than 24 hours, they're just screwed?

And take my son. He's 8. He has an Xbox 360 and plays the hell out of it, but he almost never plays online games because he's still young and struggles. His friends are the same way, but unlike us, some of them live outside the city and don't have high speed Internet available. Those kids won't be able to play Xbox One because they have dial-up or no home internet at all (many rural people out here rely on their phones for email and Facebook now and don't even mess with dial-up).

I mean, I can already foresee thousands and thousands of pissed off parents returning Xbox Ones on Day 2 of release because they won't work without Internet and they didn't know. 

So why isn't this the biggest issue? ",,False,self,t5_2qoih,1369383654.0,,,True,t3_1eyl7y,http://www.reddit.com/r/xbox/comments/1eyl7y/why_isnt_the_must_be_online_once_every_24_hours/,

I usually have to keep opening and closing the disc tray for about 10-20 min in order to get the game working, and even then sometimes it doesn't work. My xbox 360 won't even play new games anymore (let alone half the games I currently own.) it'll only play a select few games now, and thats after I spend time opening and closing the tray.

I've just learned to deal with it for the longest time, but now i'm getting a little fed up with it. I've tried opening up the xbox and doing a full clean, including the lazer, but nothing seems to fix or help the problem. 

Anyone know what I should do? The warranty has been void because of me opening the xbox, so I can't send it in, but the warranty was expired before then so it didn't matter. I would buy a new xbox but I don't have the money and won't have the money for a ways to come and by that time the next gen consoles would be out.

Any help is greatly appreciated, thanks!

I was mad and announced that I would not buy it.

But then they released more about the family sharing plan. They released more about tying in digital and physical so that way you can have actual control over your digital content.

I was looking forward to being able to buy a game and then have a friend access the game i just bought and we could play together.

I was looking forward to be able to try out the games of all the people i knew, knowing this might encourage me to make purchases from that experience.

I hate discs and steam has been great for me because countless discs have failed on me and a move to digital protects my monetary interests.

DRM was a great way to manage control over content. DRM would allow you to deactivate the digital copy that you bought so that way you could sell it.

Originally every game was to come with a physical and digital copy. In order to sell it, you had to deactivate the digital version. The check in was to make sure that you still owned the game you were playing.

This sounded like a restriction, but it wasn't. It was a win for the consumer because that meant that they would own the digital content they bought. That they had a right to do what they wanted with the digital copy, share it with up to 10 people, and access the games you bought anywhere.

But no. That is now all killed. People threw a fit and now we can't have nice things.

Now instead of owning the digital games and being able to share them you are stuck with what you buy digitally. You can only play the digital games you bought on your own console. Your friends can't borrow it. You can't sell it. You can't do anything. You have no rights to digital versions anymore.

Now in order to share a game you actually have to be able to physically visit them. You can only share with one person at a time, and as the owner you can't access the game you bought if someone else is using it.  All the other friends can't use it either while that one person has it.

1. 2 kids
2. One Xbox360 slim

4. One gold membership, one silver

My knowledge of Xbox online game play is limited, so I could use some help here:

My kids have Halo Reach, which they play online with their friends.  Only one of them can use a headset when playing.

The kids claim that only one can use one headset, because only one of them can join the game as himself.  The other has to join as a ""guest"" and there is nothing I can do about it.  

Someone else is telling me, if I buy another gold membership, both kids can use the same console at the same time to join the same online games and they will both be able to use headsets at the same time.

So, is another gold membership the solution?

QUESTION: For the benefit of the hard rive, should I keep my xbox slim in the vertical position or horizontal? If I keep it flat I'm afraid the constant downward pressure due to gravity will eventually weaken the connecters of the hard drive, rendering it useless and break off overtime.

I mean, I get why people with no internet would be ripe with anger, and also those who thrive on the used game market, but I'm sure most of us can appreciate that the future will be digital, so why not now? Plus, having the ability to start playing a game the day of release WITHOUT having to go to the store is a huge benefit to me. 

I've heard people complain about not being able to play a game at the same time as another user on an account - I fail to see how that's different now. The always online thing doesn't bother me because, honestly, I'm always online. I *am* lucky to have a really stable, fast connection, but if you're already an online gamer, I don't foresee any issues - or really, any difference - than what we have with the 360.

As for the Kinect being required, I can honestly say that some of the moments I've had most fun with friends and family have been using Kinect. I understand it's not everyone's thing, but I really don't see Microsoft charging a premium for it to be included (that wouldn't make sense), and if you're really not keen on using the gestures and voice feedback, disable it. If it's privacy you're concerned with, why haven't people boycotted Facebook, Google, or really, any other connected device? I just don't get it, maybe.

All in all, it's all about the games for me. I'm excited to see what both Microsoft and Sony have up their sleeves for the next generation. I've got both platforms currently, and while I focus most of my attention on the 360, there are a number of PS3 exclusives that I thoroughly enjoy (Uncharted, for example). 

The policies they're putting forward really don't have an affect on me, nor do I imagine that they'll have much of an effect on the majority of people who currently use the 360. But I understand that it's fun to make a big deal out of this. Most of the hysteria is being driven by the gaming media. It's just unfortunate that most people aren't even giving Microsoft a chance to show games - the real reason the next generation should be exciting for us.",,False,self,t5_2qoih,False,,,True,t3_1fveg3,http://www.reddit.com/r/xbox/comments/1fveg3/am_i_the_only_one/,

**These are facts.**
=======

**EDIT: 6/10/13 1:03EDT**

Holy tits there's SO much new information and it's only a half an hour in! I will make a synapsis for Xbox's E3 event at the end. If you want to talk to me my twitter is @NateY3K
 

**PROFILE AND XBL GOLD COMPATIBILITY**: All of your achievements, gamerscore, gamertag and even your paid XBL Gold will be fully compatible. This is IF you choose to do this. By that, it's saying that you can choose to keep your gamerscore IF you want to. Me personally, I'm going to start from scratch on the next gen consoles.

**REVERSE COMPATIBILITY** (Games): Unfortunately you cannot play Xbox 360 games on the new console. This is what Microsoft had to say about it:


*""Xbox One hardware is not compatible with Xbox 360 games. We designed Xbox One to play an entirely new generation of games—games that are architected to take full advantage of state-of-the-art processors and the infinite power of the cloud. We care very much about the investment you have made in Xbox 360 and will continue to support it with a pipeline of new games and new apps well into the future.""*


Keep in mind, that this isn't just because of the graphics, or the disks. The disks is a big part, but another thing is that it isn't able to detect if this disk is able to be apart with the instant feature. Also, if they were to keep all of the last gen games, then the Xbox One's disks and features would be limited to whatever the Xbox 360 can do which isn't much. This is what they (Xbox) said when they were asked if you were to be able to trade in, purchase and play pre-owned games.

*""We are designing Xbox One to enable customers to trade in and resell games. We’ll have more details to share later.""*

E3 maybe?

**ALWAYS ONLINE DRM**: This is FALSE you do not have to be always online. But unfortunately you do have to download every game. For more details, go to the ""DISCS"" and the ""EDIT 5/30/13"" later on this post.

*""No, it does not have to be always connected, but Xbox One does require a connection to the Internet. We’re designing Xbox One to be your all-in-one entertainment system that is connected to the cloud and always ready. We are also designing it so you can play games and watch Blu-ray movies and live TV if you lose your connection.""*

If you disagree with it then look at it on the perspective of a Developer, Creator, Publisher, etc: People pirate games, which is bad. And the only way around that is that Xbox confirms you're not pirating. That's the BIGGEST issue is pirating. That's the only reason why anything has Always Online DRM. How do you think Blizzard games make so much money? You can't pirate them! (At least Diablo III you can't)

**STORAGE**: Unfortunately, you cannot put in a new Internal Hard Drive. But you can put in an external hard drive doesn't matter what size. If you play enough games and you are worried about games taking too much space, then you should just go ahead and get one. I would suggest that you just 

**KINECT**: The Kinect sensor is required for most games. If you ever plan on buying an Xbox One then make sure that the games that you're playing doesn't have anything to do with the Kinect. Here's what Xbox said about this:

*""The all new Kinect is now an essential and integrated part of the platform.  By having it as a consistent part of every Xbox One, game and entertainment creators can build experiences that assume the availability of voice, gesture and natural sensing, leading to unrivaled ease of use, premium experiences and interactivity for you.""*

I kind of agree with this, my biggest fear is that people are going to sell used Xbox Ones off the internet and people are going to get screwed because half their games that they are going to play require the Kinect and they didn't know. Their big thing is that if everyone has a Kinect then that means that people (for example) who write Call of Duty games, then they won't have to be limited by the fact that %70 of the people who play Call of Duty don't have a Kinect. This just lets the availability instead of no one buying the game because they don't have a Kinect sensor.

**USED GAMES**: Major Nelson has confirmed that there WILL be used games and they are NOT being tied to your account. The downloading thing is one time only (for the console as long as the game is still there).  This is one of the big things on thinking that the Always Online is false because if it's just some digital download then how could you possibly keep people from pirating games?

**DISCS**: There are disks, but you do have to install the game. This means that you can take advantage of the new instant features that the console brings. Like the switching to TV and to your game in seconds, like that. Because I've heard that you can play 2 games at once, you may not have to put in a disk. Which is good and bad. If you want to play a game at your (example) friend's house then you do have to install the game.

**EDIT 5/30/13** Sorry I didn't find this out immediately. 
When you buy a game (digital or physical) you have to download it though Xbox LIVE with the Xbox One, we already knew that. But when you download the game, your disk will be useless! Finally! This means that once you download it, you can give it to your friend to download it. No more switching discs every time you want to play! Now, I've seen many things like this that have been going toward the whole ""used games fee"" thing that's been lingering around the internet. But, Xbox (no one in specific) quotes from Microsoft employees have suggested the opposite. We will find out before it comes out, keep checking here for more news.


--- **This is the end of the Xbox One portion of this post** ---

I will update this post with new CONFIRMED information as soon as I can or when it comes out.

First it started with modding the controller with a USB port, but I have Splinter Cell Platinum Hits, and none of my USB drives worked, so crap. 

Moved onto trying the hotswap method. I tried XboxHDM 1.9, however my computer only has 1 IDE socket, and even trying to set the Xbox HDD to Master and my DVD Drive to Slave caused it to say ""Linux CD Not Found"".

I was thinking maybe it isn't unlocking the drive, but i've tried two methods (unplugging the DVD drive leads to Error 7, and playing a song / pulling during play or pausing it) and I am not sure how to tell.

So I tried to use XboxHDM 2.2, and after try after try, I couldn't figure out how to get it to work. Now the USB drive + CD Boot (for some reason it wont load directly from USB despite it being an option on my P5K-E) won't boot, saying Slax can't load the files it needs.

All in all, is there any guide that I could use to softmod this thing from start to finish that doesn't lead to broken links or vague crap? I've only got the 1 IDE channel.

So I played crysis 2 for a while and went to go get dinner, with the USB still in the xbox, and when I came back, my profile wasnt even on the USB. The USB had nothing on it according to the xbox so I took it out and put it onto the computer and there are actually still three files on it: two that are just labeled ""t"" and ""tmp"" that have 0 bytes of space, and then another that is just two square icons that is 32,000 kb, exactly the amount I put onto the USB from my xbox, (I also transferred some skyrim data so its a bit big)and since the USB was brand new and I just pulled it out of the packaging yesterday to use for this and only this, I have no idea what could possibly prevent the only data on it from coming up. The xbox says I need to ""configure"" it to transfer stuff to it like when I first put it in, but since it deletes everything currently on the USB, I will most likely lose my profile on it.

I have the Original 20GB 360, and it has been repaired by Microsoft once for RRoD back in 2007ish.

Since last November my xbox has been acting odd. When I put in MW3 for the first time it came up as a disc read error. After I cleared the cache on the hard drive a few times and rebooted it worked.

I never had that error with Skyrim. I have only had some game freezes where it requires a reboot, about every 15 game hours that would 
happen. Not too bad, but still annoying.

Those are pretty much the only games I have been playing on my xbox since November.

After the dashboard update a few days ago, I was playing Skyrim for maybe an hour and then it froze. I went back to play it today and I am 
not able to play.

I either get frozen on the dashboard, or I get in Skyrim and it will freeze in the main main. Sometimes it loads my saved game and I move around for 30 seconds and it makes a quick, sharp noise and freezes. I put in MW3 and same thing, sometimes it freezes in menus, sometimes it 
freezes at dashboard.

There are 6 GB left on drive and also there are no indicators(ie red rings) on the xbox when it freezes or when I start it back up.
I did get 3 red rings once when I took off the hard drive and put it back on, then I turned it on and I got the red rings. But I believe I just didn't put it on correctly, because I took it off again and put it back on and it went right back to the freezing.

Any advice would be appreciated. Thanks and sorry for the essay!",,False,self,t5_2qoih,False,,,True,t3_q030e,http://www.reddit.com/r/xbox/comments/q030e/help_with_freezing_xbox_xpost_from_rgaming/,

Basically what I want to do is, have my Xbox sign-ins/Xbox account statements(such as billing) linked to E-mail A.

I met someone on Bungie's forums back in high school who found a way to transfer just the Xbox account information to my main E-mail while keeping both E-mails separate.

Also, there was a catch that you couldn't do that if both accounts have at one point been linked to an Xbox Live account. Only E-mail B has ever been linked to an account; E-mail A has only been used for E-mails thus far.

It was my first time buying a game through digital means (not a hard disc copy of the game). I played it for two days. There were game stutters and lags through the start but I slowly got used to them. Then today, after putting in almost 3 days into the game, it doesn't load anymore. I called Xbox support and in the end I was told to just delete all my progress and re-download the game. 

I've been a XBL customer for many years now and have never had bad experiences with any of my disc copies. This digital download copy has been nothing but frustration for me. The game stutters annoyed me but what if I had gotten 50% through the game? This is clearly a problem with the digital copy. If this happened with a hard copy (which it never has for me), I'm sure I could bring it back to the store and replace it. 

Initially, I tried to support Xbox in their digital sales because I thought it could start a new trend for them (like Steam) but count me out for the next marketplace sale.

I plug the new hard into the usb port with the transfer cable and left the old one plugged in to the hard drive port. Now apparently a message should have popped up asking if I want to transfer data, and I later found out that I should have plugged the new hard drive into the hard drive port and the old one into the usb port with a transfer cable, if i did that the message should have popped up and things would have been fine. That was my first mistake. 

My second mistake was reformatting the 120gb hard drive. The xbox couldn't detect that it was an xbox hard drive, it just said that it was a usb device what needed to be formatted in order to be used. So I formatted it and It only said the capacity was 32gb. After talking with xbox support I found out that I should have had the hard drives switched around. So basically I turned xbox hard drive into a regular 120gb hard drive that the xbox can't pick up when I plug it into the hard drive port, and when I plug it into the usb port with the transfer my xbox thinks its a usb device that can only hold 32gb (the xbox support person said that max amount a usb device can hold for xbox is 32gb). I plugged it into my computer with the hard drive cable and it said it was a 120 gb hard drive formated to MS-DOS FAT (because I accidentally reformatted). And when i plugged my old hard drive into my computer it said the hard drive was unreadable  (because it is formatted specifically for Xbox). 

So I know what i did wrong. I changed the storage format of the 120 gb hard drive from the xbox hard drive format to a basic universal hard drive format. And I need to format my hard drive back to the original format (what ever the format is) so my xbox can read it as a 120 gb xbox 360 hard drive. I don't think it is one of the normal hard drive format like NTFS, FAT32, or ExFAT, I think it is a special format specifically for xbox and I would like to know if there is a way to change it back. 

Any held would be appreciated. People on xbox support only told me what I did wrong but not how to fix it. ",,False,self,t5_2qoih,1355161663.0,,,True,t3_14m30z,http://www.reddit.com/r/xbox/comments/14m30z/how_to_reformat_a_hard_drive/,

Call of Duty will randomly freeze midgame.  Sometimes it will let me play for an hour before doing it, sometimes not even 5 minutes.

Netflix works fine 90% of the time, but sometimes when starting it will just stay on the red netflix screen.

In all cases, buttons are unresponsive.  If I hold the guide, I can hear the guide make a noise when it comes up, but no menu does.

I am a total noob when it comes to console games but I thought I would give it a shot.  My nephew wanted to play his Lego Indiana Jones 3 game.  He pops it in but the game wouldn't even start because he needs some sort of HD to be installed to play?!?!

I thought that was total shit but whatever.  I don't know anything about x-box so maybe I am wrong?  My question is this.  All I want is for my little nephew to be able to play and save his Lego games.  What would you suggest I get for him for Christmas?  

Also, we ended up playing Lego Batman and Robin which was a blast.  Again, total noob here but the console said it was saving his game but was that true??  Do some games save to the internal drive while others only let you play with the additional HD?  I am confused....Is there some way I can check to see if the game will use the internal HD vs having to buy an additional HD..like a symbol or something on the outside of the game??

I just want to be the awesome Uncle who gets my nephew something he wants and can use for Christmas.  I am not even sure my nephew understands that he needs something extra to play his Lego Indiana Jones 3 game.
