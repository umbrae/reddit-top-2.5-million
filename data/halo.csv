My family can't thank Bungie enough. I know that they have had a huge impact on how well my son has been recovering after his surgery.

Also, thanks to everyone in this subreddit that assisted in Bungie reaching out to my son!

Edit: wow, I woke up to some really kind words and even some other transplant stories, thank you everyone!

Yes, Bungie gave the helmet to my son, he can't get enough of it. This thing is detaillled and HEAVY! 

Those that are concerned about kids playing an M rated game. He doesn't playyy like you or I would sit and play. He doesn't just hop on multiplayer with a headset and microphone or just start playing the campaign. I'll sit down and play a part of the campaign with him, or mom will join us for our own multiplayer game. He likes the idea of Halo more than playing Halo. His interest has transcended the games, he would rather battle it out with his Halo action figures, anyway. The Spartan storyline just gets his imagination going, it's wonderful.

Emblems are not a method to show prestige.  That's what the armor pieces, stances and visor colors are designed for. 

And to add insult to injury, you've taken a very popular emblem (well, at least to me any my fellow bloodhorns), the Unicorn, and made it an exclusive.  So even though I've been prancing through multiplayer iterations of Halo for years, now I have to be a goddamn chicken.  Come on, 343.  

Do the right thing. Unlock all of the classic emblems now. You can keep your fancy, high-fallutin' emblems.

Not a creature was stirring - not even a mouse.
The headsets were hung by the remotes with care
In hopes that Masterchief soon would be there.

The players were nestled all snug in their beds
While visions of melee-ing danced in their heads.
And Cortana in her circuits and I in my gear,
Had just rested our hands for a long Infinity year.

When out on the map there arose such a clatter,
I sprang from my spawnpoint to see what was the matter.
Away to my base I flew in a Ghost, tore away the Carbine
And cursed at the host.

The moon on the breast of the new forming ennies,
Gave a luster of midday to the Flood down below.
When what to my bloodshot eyes should appear
But a brand new Warthog and new Forrunners to fear.

With Cortana going rampant and going insane
I knew in a moment - get ammo and quick!
More rapid than needles his coursers they came
And he whistled and shouted and called them by name.

Now Hunters! Now Jackals! Now Grunts and Elites!
On Brutes! On Forrunners! On Floods little treats!
To the top of crane! To the top of the wall!
Now crash away, crash away, dash away all!

As dry shrapnel that after explosions fly
When they meet with an obstacle mount to the sky
So, up to the Sniper Roost, the coursers they flew
With a Scorpion full of ammo knowing full what to do.

And then, in Solace I heard on the platform,
The cursing and shrieking of each red/blue mourn.
As I drew my light rifle and was turning around,
Down the Masterchief came with a bound.

He was dressed all in armor from his head to his toe
And it was tarnished and damaged from battles we know.
A bundle of weapons he had flung on his back
And I wanted to kiss him in spite of his sack.

His face, it was hidden, his mask was of gold
He truly was a sight to behold.
He had broad shoulders and confident stance.
I thought to myself - gotta get some of those pants!

With a flick of his wrist and a swipe of his hand,
4 Plasma Grenades at my feet did land.
And a Shotgun, a Rocket Launcher with ammo he laid down
And I knew that a Mantis soon would be found!

Then tapping his mask with the tip of his gun
I knew it was time to start having some fun
He sprang to his Warthog - to his captors gave a whistle
And away they all flew as if they were hit with a pistol.

But I heard him exclaim as they drove out of sight,
Happy Halo to all - now finish the fight! (Enjoy Halo 4 folks!)",,False,self,t5_2qixk,False,,major-grade-3,True,t3_12myt2,http://www.reddit.com/r/halo/comments/12myt2/twas_the_night_before_halo/,

I'll repeat that again. There is nothing wrong with the maps in Halo 4. 

What is wrong with Halo 4, then? The playlists and gametypes. They are **even less optimized** than you think -- which leads to bad playing experiences. I know this shit is true because I realize all of the maps are fun when I'm playing Oddball, and I know there is nothing wrong with the maps themselves. Oddball is the only perfect playlist.

- Asymmetrical maps everywhere; **but no** single-flag or one-bomb. Nope. Only Two-Flag, leaving one team always in a slight advantage (Abandon, Complex, etc.) in CTF. Imagine if Halo 2 had *only* Two-Flag with as many asymmetrical maps as it did. Two Flag Burial Mounds, anyone? 5v5 Two Flag Ascension? Two Flag Ivory Tower? Hell, I probably would have hated Zanzibar if it was 5v5 Two Flag. Get out of here with that nonsense.

- **Lack of variety** (No Assault, no Single-Flag, no FFA, no Team Snipers, no Team Doubles, no Action Sack, no Hardcore). This is what usually happens: I play two, maybe three rounds of Infinity Slayer, then back out to the Playlist menu, spend about five minutes reading the choices, trying to pump myself up for something, wishing there was a Team Snipers playlist, but there isn't, and nothing looks fun, so I just turn off my console.

- Maximum player lists for matchmade games are **not optimized;** 10 players in CTF, really? Ten players with sprint leaves the small maps too small, and the larger maps too large and not fun.

- So many large maps, but only **one** fucking 8v8 playlist?? And it's *Slayer*?

No 8v8 One-Flag CTF Longbow? No CTF Shatter? No 8v8 CTF Exile? Hell, 8v8 CTF on Meltdown sounds *amazing*.

If I were to post this a month before the launch of Halo 4; I would have been laughed at -- no one would believe it -- it's like a bad joke.

I think the maps are great, but the playlists *really do fucking suck* and 343 needs to be reminded every day.

**Edit:**

Great responses and discussion; I have read and upvoted *all of them*. /u/cmart1987 messaged me 343i's email address and I have decided to send them a personal email with this thread. I think many of you should do the same.

/r/trees has been doing a self posts Sunday that everyone there seems to enjoy. I am wondering if that will be a good step, but have that one day be a whole weekend possibly. Though, we would like to discuss this with all of your first, here are two options.

* Keep it self posts only. Bring back Custom Weekends and other weekly ""events"".

* Have day(s) dedicated to self posts and discussion. Possibly a ""Self posts Thursday"" (day after the Bulletin so there'll be something to talk about) or possibly a self post weekend. Still bring back Custom Weekends.

My god.,1190,268,302,http://www.reddit.com/r/halo/comments/15b5uk/the_actual_yield_of_the_nova_bomb_my_god/,"We first hear of the NOVA bomb in the book First Strike, where Admiral Whitcomb hopes to trap the covenant with it.  It gets taken by a ship to a Covenant held planet, and it then explodes.  The damage is ridiculous. It SHATTERED the moon of that planet, and scorched (similarly to a glass planet) a quarter of the planet's surface.  It also destroyed every Covenant ship in orbit.

Now, this is impressive.  But only recently did I come to understand the true destructive power of this weapon.

For reference:  The ""Fat Man"" dropped on Japan at the end of World War II had a nuclear yield of 20 kilotons. For the Americans out there, if dropped on NYC, it would have destroyed Manhattan, but not much else.  

So,

Fatman = 20 kt

NOVA = 1.2 Petatons = 1,200,000,000,000 kt 

NOVA, if detonated centered in NYC, would have a fireball that would cover all of North America, and the thermal radiation would cover the Earth three times over.

For another reference, the most powerful nuclear bomb ever designed by humanity is the ""Tsar Bomba"" designed by the Soviet Union.  

The NOVA bomb is 6 Trillion times more powerful then that bomb.

I cannot express how crazy the NOVA seems to be.   The Halo wiki considers its Covenant equivilant to be Glassing a Planet.  

Glassing a planet takes hours. The NOVA bomb does the same damage in seconds.  ",,False,self,t5_2qixk,1356232535.0,,,True,t3_15b5uk,http://www.reddit.com/r/halo/comments/15b5uk/the_actual_yield_of_the_nova_bomb_my_god/,

As an avid designer of custom games, the lack of gametypes and custom game options is going to cripple the creativity of the community.

The specific lack of the ""Race"" gametype and the player's extremely limited ability to alter ""Flood"" are particularly damning.

Some of the most popular custom games from previous Halo games such as ""Predator"", ""Ring of Fire"", and ""Duck Hunt"" are not able to be re-created using Halo 4's custom game set up.

... and not including ""Race"" after the Racetrack community absolutely exploded in Halo: Reach is going to be more than aggravating for some.

You have been doing a great job of supporting us, especially with fanatastic additions to Forge, and the introduction of Trait Zones. I hope these minor issues are ironed out, and the Forge community can flourish on bungie.net's replacement, Waypoint. 

But, please, *help us help you turn Halo 4 into a great centerpiece for a great creative community.*

**Tl:Dr-** The large lack of gametypes from previous games, particularly ""Race"" and limited customization options for custom games could give the creative community of Halo some major issues.

So, here's the plan. We organize a mass weekend-long exodus to Halo 3. As many redditors as possible. That way we can increase the game's traffic for a little while and make it somewhat like back when the game was at its height. We can ride the wave of players as long as possible, but altogether just having some more people in matchmaking might be a great experience.

1352591121.0,871,self.halo,12zhkg,A comprehensive list of Halo 4's shortcomings,1207,336,800,http://www.reddit.com/r/halo/comments/12zhkg/a_comprehensive_list_of_halo_4s_shortcomings/,"I'm attempting to make a list of all things missing or downgraded in Halo 4 compared to previous Halo games.  Unfortunately it's a long list, and to be honest I'm scratching my head at why they removed so many things.  I don't think this is everything, so if you see something not on here or I got something wrong, I can remove/add it.

[Update] I've added links to clarify on why some of these issues are on the list.

General

* ~~You can only be on 4 teams(compared to 8 in previous games).~~ This was incorrect.
* You can't view the campaign terminals ingame; you must go to waypoint.
* Can't hold the back button and move around at the same time.
* Scrolling through players in the scoreboard is more difficult.  Instead of holding back and using the right analog stick to move through them, you must use the d-pad. [See here](http://www.reddit.com/r/halo/comments/12zhkg/a_comprehensive_list_of_halo_4s_shortcomings/c6zqyw3?context=3)
* The indicators for your teammates' statuses aren't as clear as they used to be.  Teammates no longer show an X over their corpse.  You can no longer tell if a teammate is shooting(yellow in previous games).  When a teammate is being shot, their arrow flashes red faintly(compared to a strong orange in previous games).
* [Added] Can't view which secondary weapon you're holding.  [See here](http://www.reddit.com/r/halo/comments/12zhkg/a_comprehensive_list_of_halo_4s_shortcomings/c6zovoa?context=3)
* ~~[Added] No longer shows an icon ingame to indicate who is talking.~~

Custom Games

* Removed the ability to make any variant of CTF other than Multi-flag CTF.  This means 1-Flag and Neutral Flag don't exist anymore.  I don't think you can trick forge into getting them to work either, since 1-Flag needs the round to reset after a flag capture, and CTF will not spawn a flag marked as 'neutral' unless there is someone on a 'neutral' team.
* Can't make it so you can drop the flag.
* Can't disable sprint.  [See here](http://www.reddit.com/r/halo/comments/12zhkg/a_comprehensive_list_of_halo_4s_shortcomings/c6zifor?context=3)
* Can't turn off/on instant-respawn.  It's off in CTF and Dominion, but is on in most(all?) other gametypes.
* Respawn time is a mostly irrelevant setting with instant respawn time not being toggle-able.
* Can't modify CTF to have to hold a button to pick up the flag.
* Can't make assault how it used to be.  If you use Grifball to make Assault, then you are able to throw the bomb around.  You can play assault by swapping the flag capture points around, but that requires making a map specifically for ""assault"".
* Removed Race, Territories, Stockpile, Headhunter, and Juggernaut.  Some of these were removed because of redundance, but other than for territories, you can't make anything like them anymore. You can't make stockpile at all.  You can't make headhunter at all.  You can't make Juggernaut how it used to be.  You can rig together a race gametype using KotH.
* Can't modify Flood in any meaningful way.  The flood are required to have their three base loadouts with thruster pack, promethean vision, and invis.  They cannot use any weapons other than the flood sword.
* Except for slayer, you can't modify how many points you get for doing certain things.  For example, you can't set it so that kills count for points in a CTF game.
* [Added] Weapons you place down on the map physically(without using the ordnance system) won't show up in some gametypes(slayer pro, infection), but they'll show up in others(infinity slayer, CTF).  There is also no option to turn the 'weapons on map' setting on/off, unless you're messing with initial ordnance.
* [Added] Can no longer create your own power-ups.
* [Added] When setting extra points for a headshot kill in a slayer gametype, sniper headshots will not count for the extra points.
* [Added] Can no longer change the oddball scoring mechanic.

Forge

* Can't use precision moving anymore(pushing the left thumbstick down in Reach)
* Can't zoom in anymore.
* When placing objects inside/near walls on Ravine(possibly on other maps), it will push the objects away, even when using coordinate editing.
* When using magnets to align objects, sometimes the objects will not align properly and there will be a small but noticeable bump between them.
* ~~You can set objects to belong to teams 5 through 8, but those teams do not exist.~~
* You can set objectives to belong to a neutral team, but no gametypes support it.
* You can set 'symmetry=true/false' on objects, but there are no asymmetric gametypes.
* [Added] Magnets can't snap to angles.
* [Added] The 'reloading shift glitch' was not fixed.  [See here](http://www.reddit.com/r/halo/comments/12zhkg/a_comprehensive_list_of_halo_4s_shortcomings/c6zhhqk)

Theater

* You cannot view campaign or spartan ops replays.
* [Added] Unable to view replays with friends.
* [Added] In film clips, the announcer can no longer be heard(somtimes?  Conflicting reports).

Split-screen

* Bad framerate lag on half of the maps, specifically Complex, Meltdown, Vortex, Exile, and Relay(not in matchmaking).  Any map made entirely of forge pieces or uses a decent bit of forge pieces lags considerably in split-screen.  The pre-made maps for Erosion and Ravine do not seem to lag.
* The HUD is cluttered.  In CTF, it still shows how far away you are from the flag.  The icons that mark objectives are the same size as they are in full-screen.  Icons for initial ordnance are the same size as they are in full-screen.  Weapon reticles are the same size as they are in full-screen(even in 4-player split-screen).  The icons for objectives never leave your screen; this means in Dominion, you always have all three points' icons on your screen.  Medal names and how many points they're worth still show up.
* Plasma grenades do not glow until you are very close to them.
* [Added] In Spartan Ops, it won't let you view the week's episode claiming that you can't go in theater mode in split-screen.

Campaign(No spoilers)

* [Added] Removed point scoring.  As a result, the timer was also removed(used for speed runs).

Matchmaking

* [Added] Can't search for matches based on best connection(international players being matched with the US playerbase).",,False,self,t5_2qixk,1352670572.0,,,True,t3_12zhkg,http://www.reddit.com/r/halo/comments/12zhkg/a_comprehensive_list_of_halo_4s_shortcomings/,

It all started with this ['harmless'](http://www.reddit.com/r/halo/comments/15ra4j/does_anybody_have_an_extra_halo_specialization/) post saying that he's looking for someone to give him a specialization code.  He already deleted the post but it still shows his [name](http://i.imgur.com/MYTNA.png) in my comment history.

At the time I thought nothing of it but then 20 minutes later, [another post was made by a new account begging for a Specialization code](http://www.reddit.com/r/halo/comments/15rbdf/specialization_code_for_halo/c7p32ej?context=3).  I made another comment warning Redditors to not give their codes to such a new account and I got downvoted instantly on both my comments. 

 
I was started to figure that something was up since I didn't lose any karma when I got downvoted so I called him out on him for making new accounts, and he responded with this ['wonderful'](http://i.imgur.com/tHonP.png) message and deleted the thread.

An hour later I saw another [specialization code thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/halo/comments/15ricd/anybody_have_an_extra_specialization_code_for_sale/c7p51al?context=3) and it looks it was made by another new account.  This one seemed 'normal' at first but I found it sort of shady that this brand new account copied and pasted word for word [this thread's description](http://www.reddit.com/r/halo/comments/15qtsl/does_anyone_have_a_extra_specialization_code/) on his post.    I included all 3 of these together because they were made hours within each other and they all seemed shady to me.


**Onto the next day**

This morning I logged into Reddit and saw that there was [another thread about Specialization codes](http://www.reddit.com/r/halo/comments/15s3mt/does_anyone_know_where_i_can_find_or_buy_halo_4/)...  I once again warned people to be wary about who you're trading with.  An hour later I got this [message from Disco Dorito.](http://i.imgur.com/PrXuv.jpg) I looked at his profile and what do you know?  [His motto mentions Denzel](http://i.imgur.com/wQ32I.jpg) which ties him to the new account (agressivedenzel) that was just created this morning. 


Disco Dorito was the guy who started [the first thread asking for a Specialization code](http://i.imgur.com/MYTNA.png) yesterday, and I noticed something about that message Disco Dorito sent me. [He says he sent this message to all recent players but how I could I be a recent player if I haven't even played Halo today, and that Xbox Live says I have no history playing with him?](http://i.imgur.com/qcr3R.jpg)

I asked him how he even got in touch with me, but he never responded to me.  I sent him another message asking him why he made that post on Reddit yesterday and [he states he doesn't even know what Reddit is](http://i.imgur.com/hNYrW.jpg)

I sent one last message to him asking him why he is making all these threads and [he replied to me pretty much saying that it doesn't even matter anymore since a Redditor just gave him a code, and he ended his message with calling me ""a fucking prick who has nothingbetter to do with his fucking life""](http://i.imgur.com/i4c39.jpg)

I contacted the Redditor who supposedly gave him the code and [he told me that he didn't give it to him](http://i.imgur.com/0S45D.jpg) which means that he lied to me so I would give up on his attempts to steal codes...

He has now blocked communications with me, and I just want to warn you all to watch who you give your Specialization codes to :(

(edit)  He found out that I called him out and he did something very nice and mature about this whole situation:  http://i.imgur.com/2LPB1.png",,False,self,t5_2qixk,1357102946.0,,CSR-43,True,t3_15sjbj,http://www.reddit.com/r/halo/comments/15sjbj/please_beware_of_the_user_disco_dorito/,

[Halotracker forums.](http://www.halotracker.com/Forums/ShowThread.aspx?ID=191167&amp;Page=1)

First off what is an API? As stated by Ruben Gilbert aka [@ManiiaDaWiz](https://twitter.com/ManiiaDaWiz) on Twitter:

""API stands for ""Application Programming Interface"".  The title is almost self-explanatory.  It is an interface that developers make that have predefined methods that allow users to gather data from some computer/server/program.  


In lamens terms, an API for the Waypoint site would allow sites (like Halotracker, Halocharts, etc) to have a way to gather stats from the Waypoint stats accumulator.  Bungie had one for it's Halo games, but when 343i took over Halo, they didn't implement an API so gathering stats got rather difficult since everything had to be done pseudo-manually.   


The API wouldn't only have to be for stats, that is just the common use for it.  For example, Twitch.TV has an API that allows you to gather data about a stream, such as viewers, followers, channel views, and the chat box along with the stream itself.""

 

By providing an open API for Halo 4, 343 Industries will allow other communities the ability to collect stats, create leaderboards as well as grow the overall community. This will also provide the communities with an opportunity to the expand and involve more people from different demographics.

By allowing other communities and sites to track and compare stats 343 Industries will not only create continued overall support for Halo 4, but it will also help provide valuable feedback as to specific things that different players in all communities are interested in and allow for capitalization and growth.

Allowing people to track and compare stats encourages competitiveness as well as continued, long term interest for Halo 4. Players, fans and communities are created to share in their love for Halo and stats.

If 343 Industries does not provide an open API for Halo 4 stat collection, leaderboard creation and overall community growth; it is very likely and possible that many community created sites will be forced to shut down and disappear.

Please help and show your support for Halo 4 and the entire Halo community. Please sign this petition and share this with everyone everywhere.

Hi everyone!

First things first! **Check out the timeline [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0AnWoH0BArowDdGdQVUtRa3B0X2ZmQzBOZWl3TlZQVUE&amp;usp=sharing)!**

Easier to read version [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/pub?key=0AnWoH0BArowDdGdQVUtRa3B0X2ZmQzBOZWl3TlZQVUE&amp;output=html)!

* **Beware of spoilers and enter and read at your own risk! This timeline includes information from nearly every single piece Halo media and includes spoilers for all novels/games/videos. Nothing has been blanked out or covered in a spoiler tag!**

* The timeline has a total of 777 entries with a few easter eggs spread throughout it!

* There are 2 sheets in this timeline. The main page is the timeline itself, and the second page is a list of notes that help to explain certain dates and aspects of the timeline. You can see which events pertain to specific notes by looking in the rightmost column of the main spreadsheet.

Read below for some more information on the timeline and my motivation for creating it.

----

First off, I would like to thank the following users for their participation and help in creating this timeline. Whether you made 1 contribution or 20, they are all very appreciated! In no particular order:

**What is this?**

This is a timeline for the Halo universe created by Bungie and inherited by 343 Industries. It includes a chronological list of events in the Halo universe. Information has been taken from nearly every Halo media and compiled into an easy to explore timeline for the convenience of Halo fans everywhere!

**My motivation for creating this timeline**

There are a number of good Halo timelines out there, some of which I mentioned in [this](http://www.reddit.com/r/HaloStory/comments/1akan6/i_am_constructing_a_full_halo_universe_timeline/) thread, however I have never encountered one that includes every individual event in an easy to read and accessable manner. The Halopedia and Halo Nation Wiki timelines are great and have tons of information, but they require loading individual pages for each year, and there are many many years to look through. So, I decided to make one that included as many of the important dates and events as possible on a single page for everyone to see.

**What should this timeline be used for?**

My main hope is that this timeline will be used as a reference for discussions about the Halo universe and the events that take place in it. I hope that if there is ever a debate about a battle or birthday or death, someone can open up this timeline and quickly discover the truth. This will be made easier because I have included the source from where the information comes.

I also hope that it will be used for general learning. Scroll through and I guarantee that you will learn *at least* 5 new things about the Halo universe. Possibly even dozens or hundreds depending on your knowledge.

**I see a spelling mistake / I noticed you are missing &lt;Event&gt; / I think that isn’t true, it should be this / I think the timeline would look better if you did this.**

Leave a comment or send me a PM and I will reply to you! If it is a spelling mistake I will change it right away.

If you are looking to add some information please provide the date, event, and source.

If you think some of my information is incorrect, please send me your source and reasoning why it is false and we can make the change.

If you are looking to make an aesthetic change, such as changing colors or adding drop down functions, etc, then please leave a comment or send me a PM and we can discuss it.

**You are missing some page numbers for certain entries, where are they?**

The timeline is not 100% complete and never will be, there will always be more information to add and I will ensure that I continue to make updates whenever and wherever necessary. If you have the page numbers and would like to provide them, I would be happy to add them!

----

Thanks again for all the comments and support, I hop everyone enjoys it!

****

I decided to post this thread after reading through [C0deReader's excellent post](http://www.reddit.com/r/halo/comments/14b9rs/i_feel_as_though_i_should_post_this/).

&gt;Honestly, I'm kind of tired of seeing all sorts of bickering regarding the Halo franchise. We're busy fighting each other and pushing ourselves apart as a community while other franchises prosper.

This subreddit seems to have two main groups of players clashing heads:

* **Classic** - This group prefers the older Halo titles (Halo:CE, Halo 2, and Halo 3) and do not enjoy Halo 4 as much.
* **Modern** - This group is fine with new additions and changes, and find Halo 4 just as or more enjoyable than the previous titles.

The problem I'm seeing on this subreddit is that the **Modern** group is confused about why the **Classic** group isn't enjoying Halo 4 as much as they are. This leads to labelling players ""Entitled"" or ""Whiners"", assuming they are just negative knit-picking people unable or unwilling to adapt to change.

I'm going to try to explain the Classic group's point of view in the context of how things have changed, not just ""OMG HALO 4 SUX BRING BAK HALOZ 2!!!1"".

****

From Halo:CE through Halo 3 (even Reach to some extent), the core of Halo's gameplay has been focused around small-medium maps, power weapon focused, medium paced, team based arena style combat. That's the style of play Halo has always had up until Halo 4.

The main problem Classic players (myself included) have is that we never asked for changes to the core gameplay. We have embraced any addition that didn't shift the core gameplay; New maps, new guns, new playlists, improved graphics, forge...etc. We bought into and enjoyed that same style of play over and over because the core never changed. Each additional game just enhanced the same style of play.

&gt;We're the school of thought that ""**If it's not broken, don't fix it**"".

Halo 4 currently deviates way too far from that style of gameplay that we have bought, played, and enjoyed for over ~10 years. That's why we are not enjoying the game as much as the Modern group. To us, Halo 4 attempted to fix something that wasn't broken, and ending up breaking the core thing that we enjoyed about the franchise.

****

Now the additions and changes Halo 4 made aren't good or bad by nature. They are just different. Whether you like the changes is very subjective, and varies player to player.

However, the changes do shift the core gameplay enough that the Classic group feels that the gameplay is no longer ""true"" to the Halo franchise:

1. **Sprint enabled by default**
****
Having the ability to sprint and not shoot at the same time changes the dynamics of encounters. In Reach and Halo 4, it's a much more plausible option to duck and run away from a battle. Sprint isn't inherently bad, but having it as a default alternative to combat changes the pace of the game. Plus Sprint has a big impact on map design, meaning maps need to be expanded to make movement more comfortable. Small symmetrical arena based maps aren't as feasible. Also not being able to disable sprint in custom games negates the playability of a lot of the smaller classic maps.

2. **Loadouts with various options**
****
One of the things that separated Halo from other FPS franchises was the lack of ""Classes"" or ""Loadouts"". In previous titles, you knew that unless your opponent had a power weapon or power-up, that they had the exact same capabilities as you. Same weapon, same methods of movement. This made engagements and combat equal and predictable. Teamwork, map control, and power weapon control (via controlling the map with teamwork) were the deciding factors to winning battles. Now in Halo 4 (and Reach to a lesser extent), battles can be decided by the loadouts the players are using, even if the players are of equal skill. The amount of variability that loadouts add to the game aren't bad, but it makes for much more ""random"" or ""chaotic"" scenarios when you consider the combinations. Personally I think Halo 3 implemented this type of feature perfectly, keeping them as equipment spawns, meaning teams needed to battle for the control of them as well.

3. **Ordinance (Personal and Random)**
****
With the exception of the initial ordinance drops on certain maps, personal and random ordinance is the biggest gameplay changer for Halo 4. No longer do you need to tactically control portions of the map at certain times to get power weapons. The only thing required to know is roughly when the ordinance drops. Yet, without knowing where it will, and what will drop, it makes map control a less prominent part of the game. Personal ordinance is such a huge divergence from the ideologies of the previous Halos as well. Previously no single player or team was given an advantage without the ability for the opposing team to have equal opportunity to get that same advantage (timed power weapons, power-ups..etc). Personal ordinance breaks this rule, and it breaks it on an individual level. Not only does it give players that are already ahead a bigger advantage, but currently the ordinance doesn't take into account deaths or any other negative action.

4. **Map Selection and Design**
****
Halo 4 differs from previous titles here as well. It has a strong focus on larger, vehicle-centric maps. There is only 4 small-medium maps, and none of the maps are particularly memorable. Compared to previous map selections, Halo 4's current maps are much more cluttered with obstructed view lines. Along with sprint and jetpack, not only did the maps need to expand so movement is comfortable, but they also expanded vertically. This means that engagements are separated over multiple vertical ""planes"", and makes team shooting and other tactics harder or not possible to do. Simply put, this isn't enough to please the Classic crowd as it takes away from the smaller symmetrical arena style maps that Classic players enjoy. The small initial map offering is a big reason why Halo 4's population is looking like it will dip below Reach numbers. http://halocharts.com/2012/chart/dailypeakpopulation/all

5. **Fixable Issues (that are currently unresolved)**
****
There are plenty of smaller issues that can and should be fixed: 

* Ranked Playlists
* 'X' indicator on death
* Instant respawn
* Zoom-in crosshair delay
* Ordinance mislabeling
* Ability to change which map you voted for (Maybe limit it to 1 change only)
* Option to disable sprint in custom games
* Integrate community forge maps into matchmaking
* Ability to watch theatre films with multiple people
* Fix frame rate in split screen
* Multiple fixes in forge
* File Browser + File Share

Those are just the ones I pulled off the top of my head, I'm sure there is more. Take into account that some of the issues listed worked perfectly in previous games, so there is no valid reason why they should be a problem now. 

It's a combination of all of these issues added onto the various heavily requested features that were never delivered with Halo 4 that makes it less enjoyable for the Classic group. For example:

* Dedicated Servers
* Connection, Language, and/or Location filtering (if no dedicated servers)
* Icon labelling which player is host
* K/D spread or ratio in the in-game scoreboard
* Website with detailed statistics (Waypoint is a step backwards from Bungie.net)
* Open up the statistics feed for third party stat sites
* Ability to retexture forge objects (not just slight color adjustments)
* Finer and more in-depth settings for custom gametypes (Individual weapon spread, fire rate, damage...etc)

****

So next time you see someone voicing their opinion on Halo 4 (or any game for that matter), don't get all butt hurt and down vote them just because you disagree. Try to see it from their perspective.

Whether you like the game or not, there is a place for both voices. We're all different and enjoy different things. If a game decides to take a new direction, don't be upset if a large portion of the community doesn't embrace it as well as you.

Whether or not you enjoy a certain map is very subjective, but I'll be trying to explain my reasoning from a more objective stance.

****
**Halo 4 has the worst map selection at launch - Here is why**
****

First, I want lay out all of the previous Halo games with the maps included at launch. I'll be grouping them by map size, which will be very important later. I'll also take note of symmetrical maps and ""community favorites"" which will be selected based on my personal experiences playing throughout the years. The favorites are just general guesses based on what was popularly voted for, and what was remade either in Forge or as a standalone map in later titles.

Legend:

(S) - Symmetrical design (based on the top down view)

(F) - Forge created

(*) - ""Community Favorite""


**Halo CE - 13 maps at launch**
****
&gt;Small-Medium - 77% of maps:
&gt;
&gt;* Battle Creek (S)(*)
&gt;* Chill Out
&gt;* Chrion TL-34
&gt;* Damnation
&gt;* Derelict (S)(*)
&gt;* Hang 'Em High (*)
&gt;* Longest (S)
&gt;* Prisoner
&gt;* Rat Race
&gt;* Wizard (S)(*)
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;Large - 23% of maps:
&gt;
&gt;* Blood Gulch (S)(*)
&gt;* Boarding Action (S)
&gt;* Sidewinder (S)(*)




**Halo 2 - 12 maps at launch - 2 remakes**
****
&gt;Small-Medium - 58% of maps:
&gt;
&gt;* Ascension
&gt;* Beaver Creek (Battle Creek) (S)(*)
&gt;* Colossus (S)
&gt;* Foundation (S)
&gt;* Ivory Tower (*)
&gt;* Lockout (*)
&gt;* Midship (S)(*)
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;Large - 42% of maps:
&gt;
&gt;* Burial Mounds
&gt;* Coagulation (Blood Gulch) (S)(*)
&gt;* Headlong
&gt;* Waterworks
&gt;* Zanzibar (*)




**Halo 3 - 11 maps at launch - 1 remake**
****
&gt;Small-Medium - 73% of maps:
&gt;
&gt;* Construct (*)
&gt;* Epitaph
&gt;* Guardian (*)
&gt;* High Ground
&gt;* Isolation (S)
&gt;* Narrows (S)(*)
&gt;* Snowbound (S)
&gt;* The Pit (S)(*)
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;Large - 27% of maps:
&gt;
&gt;* Last Resort (Zanzibar) (*)
&gt;* Sandtrap
&gt;* Valhalla (*)




**Halo Reach - 10 maps at launch - 1 remake - 1 Forge**
****
&gt;Small-Medium - 67% of maps:
&gt;
&gt;* Boardwalk (*)
&gt;* Countdown (S)(*)
&gt;* Powerhouse
&gt;* Reflection (Ivory Tower) (*)
&gt;* Sword Base
&gt;* Zealot (S)
&gt;* Cage (F)
&gt;
&gt;Large - 33% of maps:
&gt;
&gt;* Boneyard (*)
&gt;* Forge World
&gt;* Spire




**Halo 4 - 10 maps at launch - 1 remake**
****
&gt;Small-Medium - 40% of maps:
&gt;
&gt;* Adrift (S)
&gt;* Abandon (S)
&gt;* Haven (S)
&gt;* Solace (S)
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;Large - 60% of maps:
&gt;
&gt;* Complex
&gt;* Exile
&gt;* Longbow (S)
&gt;* Meltdown (S)
&gt;* Ragnarok (Valhalla)
&gt;* Vortex


**What's it all mean?**
****
What stands out to me is the fact that Halo 4 launched with **only 4 Small-Medium maps**. If you look at the ""Community Favorites"" (neglecting remakes) from the previous games, 72% of them are Small-Medium, and 50% are symmetrically based.

That leaves the remaining 60% of the Halo 4 maps as Large maps! Seeing as how the majority of games are played with 8-10 players, committing to 6 maps that are designed for 12+ is ridiculous. 

With the increase in performance and storage of the Xbox 360, it's a shame that we are subject not only to less maps than the previous games on the original Xbox, but less smaller competitive maps that make up 80% of the matchmaking playlists.

343i needs to understand that the distribution of maps at launch play a huge role in the games future success. Starting off with only 10 maps (that are large by majority), and excluding community made maps is another recipe for disaster. 

I think everyone would of preferred if they had made an additional 5 maps instead of implementing Spartan Ops and all of the different armour permutations.

**TL:DR;**
****
Halo 4 has less maps at launch than Halo CE, Halo 2, and Halo 3. Even worse is that out the 10 launch maps, only 4 are Small-Medium in size. Large map majority and lack of selection makes Halo 4 have the worst map selection at launch.
****
This took a while to compile and format, so throw a spartan an upvote in hopes that this gains some visibility. Thanks.

Usually I avoid assassinating because it takes too long and makes you vulnerable, save for humilation, or ensuring a kill if I know I'm in the clear, especially in radar-less gametypes. This might make it a bit of an incentive to perform one.

Just a thought.

EDIT: I'd just like to add that it is, indeed, satisfying and looks cool. But I feel that when a game is getting heated and competitive, it can be inappropriate to assassinate (from a gameplay standpoint).

(Note: Any other canon questions you guys come up with will also put on this list, even if they don't directly pertain to Halo 4.)

* Why the hell are we fighting the Covenant again? Didn't we make peace with them in Halo 3?

----- The thing you have to realize is that there are still a lot of religious Elites who don't believe what the Arbiter has told them about the true nature of the Forerunners; for these fanatics, their basic religious beliefs are still the same, even if they no longer believe in the sanctity of the Prophets. The still human-friendly Arbiter is currently fighting a civil war with these nuts. There are also other Elites, whom while no longer religious, still want to kill all humans simply because they see us as competition. One of these nonreligious Elites, Jul 'Mdama, finds a colony of uber-religious Elites which had lost contact with the rest of the Covenant about a year before the war ended. This colony becomes the core of the Covenant faction that we fight in Halo 4.

* Who the hell are the Librarian and the Didact?

----- They were first introduced in the [Halo 3 terminals] (http://haloterms.bungie.org/) (if you read them on a non-Legendary difficulty level). Basically, the Didact is the top ranking military leader of the Forerunners, and the Librarian is the Didact's wife and the head of the Forerunner caste that specializes in genetics, ecology, medicine, etc. Didact is not too fond of humans (having fought a war against them), while the Librarian thinks they could be the next group to inherit the Mantle (she's the reason why humans can access otherwise forbidden Forerunner technology). Didact does not want to use the Halos, while the Librarian thinks there is no other choice. Also, according to the [description for Silentium](http://www.halopedia.org/Halo:_Silentium), there are two Didacts running around; the original Didact, and the Didact's consciousness implanted in the body of a younger Forerunner. More details can be found in the novels Cryptum, Primordium, and Silentium, and also in the Halo 4 terminals (note, Silentium has not yet been released, so there are still some unanswered discrepancies between the novels and the terminals).

* Wait, what's this shit about us fighting the Forerunners? And what the fuck is the Mantle? 

----- Oh yeah, apparently over 100,000 years before the start of Halo 1, humanity had an interstellar empire which almost equaled that of the Forerunners in technological sophistication. Also, we were allied with the Prophets, who were also uber-advanced. However, this alliance then came into contact with the Flood, so we started invading Forerunner worlds in an attempt to get away (like how Germanic barbarians rushed into the Roman Empire to get away from the Huns). The Forerunners weren't too happy about this, and since humanity and the Prophets ended up fighting a two-front war, we lost. The Prophets, since they surrendered earlier, were simply quarantined to two planets. Humanity, however, had all of their technology dismantled and were devolved back to the stone-age so that they couldn't just rebuild, and the few survivors were pretty much shoved back into Earth. 

----- The Mantle is basically the Forerunners' belief that they are to be the stewards of the galaxy, a role which they believe to be inherited from an even older race they call the Precursors.

* Precursors? 

----- Introduced in Halo 3's Bestiarum, they're basically the forerunners of the Forerunners. We know they had a role in the creation of both Forerunners and humanity (along with many other species), and it's implied that they helped create the Flood as a way to test humanity's readiness for the Mantle . As to what happened to them; they tried to wipe out the Forerunners, but were mostly wiped out in turn, and the remains of their technology were destroyed when the Halos were fired.

* What's the Bestiarum?

----- In-universe, it seems to some sort of automated Forerunner analysis on all the different species in the Halo universe, and also includes a summary of the Forerunners' views about technological advancement. It came as a booklet in the Collector's edition of Halo 3, and it came with the bonus DVD you got the Legendary edition. 

* What's Halsey doing in the prologue? I thought she was stuck on Onyx? 

----- In the novel Glasslands, she, along with Mendez and the Spartans, manage to escape with help of some Engineers and an ONI search team. Last we saw of her, she was on the Infinity, though that doesn't seem to be the case anymore.

* What's with the Spartan-IVs?

----- Unlike with the IIs and IIIs, the augmentation procedures have been developed to the point where they can be safely applied to adults; the IVs are made up of adult volunteers ranging from special forces veterans to the most promising recruits. The surviving IIs and IIIs have also been invited to join the program. Unlike their predecessors, the IVs operate under their own branch of the military, known simply as Spartan.

* Wait, there are other Spartans apart from the Chief who survived the war?

----- At least 4 other active-duty Spartan-IIs (Fred, Kelly, Linda, and Naomi) survive the war with the Covenant. There are also at least 11 others (Douglas, Jerome, Alice, Jai, Adrianna, Mike, Black-One, Black-Two, Black-Three, Black-Four (aka Victor), and Maria) who might still be alive, since they were stationed elsewhere when Reach fell. 

----- As far as the surviving IIIs go, there's Tom and Lucy from Beta Company, and Ash, Mark, Olivia, the 5 members of Team Katana, and an unknown number of others from Gamma Company. Jun also might have survived, though seeing as he's absent from the 2010 reprint of First Strike, we don't actually what happened to him after Halo: Reach.

* What happened to the people vaporized by the Didact?

----- If you remember from the game, the device he uses to do so (""The Composer"") can be used to digitize living things. As shown in the Halo 4 terminals, the Didact uses this feature to convert living things (including humans) into the robotic Prometheans that you fight throughout the game. That's most likely what he was intending to do with all the humans he digitized during Halo 4. 

* So how do the Spartan IVs compare to the IIs in terms of strength and speed and abilities and stuff?

----- It's sort of unknown at the moment; it'll depend on how much the augmentations have improved and how stringent the selection criteria for the IVs are compared with their predecessors.

* So what happened to all that technology created by the prehistoric interstellar humans?

----- As mentioned in an earlier question, the Forerunners dismantled whatever human technology they could get their hands on. However, there are some hints that they weren't fully successful in doing so: one short story in Halo: Evolutions describes how the UNSC was finding architecture on ""unexplored"" planets that bore a disturbing resemblance to ancient human architecture. Said story even directly mentions those ""East Asian"" buildings from the Halo Legends episode ""The Babysitter"".

* So was the Composer ever used on the Flood?

----- Yes, but it could only slow down the rate of transformation in infectees, and it only worked temporarily to boot.

* Why do the Forerunners call themselves the Forerunners? Seems like a weird way to refer to themselves.

----- They called themselves such because they thought another race would eventually inherit the Mantle from them, hence making them the ""Forerunners"" to the new guys. Of course, in practice, they could be quite reluctant to let ""lesser"" races take control.

* How did John survive that nuke on the last level?

----- That one's still being debated. It sort of seems that Cortana either ""digitized"" him temporarily (though that would be require her to be better at doing so than the Forerunners themselves), teleported him, or simply raised a shield of hard light around him right before the bomb went off (lol Forerunner magic). Or some combination of the above.  EDIT: If Cortana enveloped him in a hard light shield, she might have used the light bridge to do so; the ""room"" Chief is in has the same pattern as the bridge.

* Why did the Librarian think the Chief was special, and what did she do to him?

----- As mentioned earlier, the Librarian thinks humanity should be the next species to inherit the Mantle, and decided to subtly nudge us towards that path by inserting various commands (geas) and such to our genes that could activate as far away in the future as thousands upon thousands of years after the initial insertion. The existence of the Chief represents a vital step in her plans for human ascendency. 

----- She makes him immune to the effects of the Composer, and she also does something which is kind of implied to at least somewhat counteract the genetic devolution inflicted on prehistoric humanity by the Forerunners. 


* About your first question; so why is this fanatical Covenant faction on Requiem?

----- Simple; Jul 'Mdama not only wants to find more Forerunner technology, he also wants to awaken the Didact to help him kill all humans.

* So what was that beam in the last level? What planet was it shooting at and what was happening in general? 

----- Basically, towards the end of the game, the Didact travels to Earth and uses the Composer to digitize the entire population of New Phoenix.

* How did living things survive the firing of the Halos?

----- Basically, the Librarian indexed as many species as she could so that life could be automatically reintroduced to the galaxy after the Halos were fired. She seems to have done this by storing various species inside special facilities, such as the Ark, that were located outside the Halos' range of fire.

* Wait, does this include the Flood?

----- Basically, the only Flood still left alive are those kept in protected Forerunner storage facilities. Why were they kept alive? Maybe because the Forerunners believed in the sanctity of all life. Maybe because there wasn't time to destroy all specimens when the decision was made for the Halos to be fired. Maybe because the Forerunners suspected that there might be even more Flood living outside of the area covered by the Halos, and kept a few specimens for continued research so that they could find a better cure if those theorized Flood ever came to the Milky Way. EDIT: Waypoint seems to indicate that it's the last theory mentioned, with Forerunners wanting to find a true cure in case the Flood ended up being extragalactic in origin.

* How did the Librarian and the Didact survive the Halos firing?

----- The Didact was shoved inside a Shield World (Requiem), the interiors of which are explicitly stated to be shielded from the effects of the Halo rings. The Forerunners were originally planning on hiding in these when the Halos went off, though most of them seemed to have been unable to do so.

----- Also, we don't know if the Librarian truly survived the arrays; the one we see in Halo 4 is only an imprint, and while it's claimed at the end of Primordium claims that she's still alive, we don't know if it's the original or some sort of copy.

* Wait, you basically said earlier that humans and Forerunners are separate species. So what's up with Guilty Spark saying ""You are Forerunner"" at the end of Halo 3?

----- Well, one answer would be that Bungie was originally intending to do the whole Forerunners = humans thing.

----- Another theory would be that Guilty Spark was a few chocolates short of a Reese's Peanut Butter Cup; the Halo CEA terminals show that he was so mad with loneliness that he was randomly venting the atmosphere on Halo for shits and giggles, and in the opening cutscene of ""Two Betrayals"", he's under the impression that he already spoke with the Chief long before they actually met in the game.

----- Another idea is that Guilty Spark might be speaking metaphorically; the Chief was to ""reclaim"" the Forerunners' legacy and become one of them in spirit. 

----- However, my personal guess would involved the Forerunner's ability to place inheritable genetic codes and commands into living things. Basically, Guilty Spark might be under the impression that he spoke with the Chief 100,000 years ago and that Chief's a Forerunner because he's ""misreading"" the genetic code/command that was placed into the Chief's ancestors.

----- Related to that, it might be that Guilty Spark mistook Chief's augmentations as Forerunner-type mutations.

* What was the Didact doing in Requiem for 100,000 years and how did he survive?

----- Before they shoved him inside Requiem, they first put him inside a Cryptum (the glowing silver ball thing you see in Halo 4), which puts any living thing inside of it into a state of suspended animation. 

* But doesn't being in a Cryptum for too long screw with your body?

----- Yep, which is why a regenerative bath is normally needed after coming out of one. However, Halo 4 Terminal 5 mentions that the Didact performed experimental mutations on himself to try to make himself immune to the Flood; these mutations, plus the preservative effects of his armor, might have kept his body more intact than it otherwise would have been.

* How does Covenant technology work?    

While it's still never been mentioned how they reload/recharge their plasma-based weapons (it was a running joke in the Bungie games that the UNSC was forever stumped by this), the Covenant get their ""fuel"" from mining Helium-3 from planets. This has actually been proposed as an effective energy source by modern science, but there isn't enough of it in Earth's atmosphere to be used.

* When/how does the Didact have force powers? 

----- That's actually the Didact using a constraint field (basically some sort of energy field used to restrain people); Cryptum mentions that all Warrior-Servants (the Forerunner military caste) could generate them at will.

EDIT: A couple of links if you want to learn more about the Haloverse.

* http://officeofnavalintelligence.tumblr.com/HaloBooks (note: the editions of ""The Fall of Reach"", ""The Flood"", and ""First Strike"" available there are the original versions, not the 2010/2011 reprints retconned to mesh better with later canon and which come with bonus ""adjunct"" sections)

I assume that 343 did this to prevent people from teamkilling or injuring their teammates out of spite/to take their gun etc. But now they have created something much worse. You can destroy friendly vehicles in BTIS. No different than other Halo games. Where it gets different is in the fact that when in previous Halo games, destroying a friendly vehicle would result in a betrayal and possibly getting booted, in Halo 4 destroying a friendly vehicle will cause the driver and passengers to pop out unharmed due to no friendly fire. When this happens, the person who destroyed the vehicle receives NO CONSEQUENCES AT ALL. Sorry for the needlessly long post but I'm pretty fed up with people refusing to let me leave our spawn with the mantis.
SOLUTION: Couldn't they just turn on friendly fire? If someone teamkills you, boot them. It worked for the other Halo games.

Just wanted to share this awesome halo 3 trick my team just released. The bottom of the elevator was a challenge initiated by ""Chrizzle"" back in the early day's of 2009 when he found this room and the elevator shaft. Left dormant for years, me and my friends decided to give it a try. 

One of the longest freefalls ever survived in a Halo game, involving a 4-person equipment jump, six equipments, and a freefall that lasted for an astounding 22 seconds. Trust us, it took a LONG time. 3 years of plans and ideas that evolved and turned into the final master-plan here.

For those reddittors out there that remember, I'm the guy that shared the Rec Room and the Second Waterfall. I hope you guys enjoy watching this as much as we have enjoyed completing it.

P.S: That feeling when we landed that jump was pretty amazing. ;)

1353226395.0,581,self.halo,13e4d0,The Master Chief no one is talking about.  Spoiler,736,155,312,http://www.reddit.com/r/halo/comments/13e4d0/the_master_chief_no_one_is_talking_about_spoiler/,"I've been thinking a lot about how Halo 5 and 6 are going unfold, and I feel that there is a huge part of Halo 4 that everyone has neglected to analyze in detail.  

The Liberian has altered MC's DNA, allowing him to become what she intended the Human race to become when she first altered our DNA Eons ago. 

343i really skims over the details of the alterations the Librarian made on MC.  All we positively know is he is immune to the composer (which is a huge deal, as it is/was the Didact's greatest weapon against us.)  And for such a serious thing to have happened, and 343i, through MC and Cortana's conversations, to really go into no detail, is really telling to its true importance.

Obviously none of us can really know where they are going with this, but my theory so far is Chief, maybe unaware of it, has become humanity's key to becoming The Reclaimers, and attaining the Mantle, as the Precursors intended.  I'll point out a couple pieces of dialogue from the game to back this claim up. 

1.  In the Intro, Halsey says, ""Your mistake is seeing Spartans as military hardware.  My Spartans are humanity's next step, our destiny as a species. Do not underestimate them, but most importantly, do not underestimate him.""  This to me is the give away.  The Intro always seemed truly out of place, and I always felt like its context was much greater than just Halo 4.  We have to remember this is the Intro for an entire trilogy, not just one game, and those are some very, very powerful words when seen outside the prism of Halo 4.  That quote is as prophetic as they get.  

2. The Librarian backs up the importance of the quote above in a Myriad of ways.  Her entire dialogue with the Chief confirms that Halsey is right on the money, but the best part is that the Librarian indirectly admits that NOT ONLY WAS THE CREATION OF MASTER CHIEF INEVITABLE (he arguably holds the most powerful / superior DNA in the Galaxy, as Humans are meant to take the Mantle and Spartans were picked for their perfect genome + he stands out as the most superior Spartan) BUT DR. HALSEY WAS INTENDED / INEVITABLE.  This is proven when the Librarian not only claims her work practically created Master Chief Eons ago, but also HIS AI, WHO IS A CLONE OF HALSEY.  So her work / thinking is what has satisfied the work of the Librarian.  So indeed, her claim the Spartans are our species destiny holds significant value.  

3. The Didact, when he first meets Master Chief, proclaims that, ""Man has yet to attain the Mantle.""  Yet, with the help of the Librarian, how much longer will this be so?  Obviously Chief does not have the Force-like abilities that the Didact does EDIT: *(Yes, they are Amor Abilities, but the creation of such technology is only possible by species who are genetically Superior.  Humans are superior (in real life) to all other species on our Planet because of our genetic superiority: an inherent ability to manipulate our environment (create technology), and use it to protect ourselves.  Better technology allows for higher reproductive success, which is the true measure of the superiority of species' genes.*

4.  ~~Here's the one I cannot believe people haven't been more confused about...  SPARTAN IV's HAVE PROMETHEAN VISION in war game, when the hell did that happen??  Of course this could just be 343i wanting to give us some cool ability that has no foundation in Lore, or, and correct me if i'm wrong, the simulated training missions on Infinity take place after Halo 4, thus whatever the Librarian did to Chief has been reversed engineered and used on the other spartans.~~  EDIT:  PV is an armor ability, but the final cutscene is interesting in how everyone seems to be rushing to get MC's armor off, while the Didact is giving a speech about how Humanity is the great threat the forerunners face.  This could be VERY metaphorical to Chief being reborn as a true Reclaimer of the Mantle / Evolving.  Like a snake shedding his skin and becoming a new.  

5.  Finally, this all completely fits in with Halsey's Intro speech.  Indeed Spartans are our species destiny, Chief is at the origins of it, and we are beginning to reach such genetic superiority that would allow for us to attain AND HOLD the Mantle.
*In order to Attain the Mantle, or have the ability to carry out the philosophy it is, a species must have the technology to do so.  Man was de-evolved, which pushed back its inevitable attainment of the Mantle.  Thus Humanity much reach a point in which its technology is capable of this. Ideas (superstructure) cannot exist without Infrastructure (Tangible things that allow for ideas to manifest into action)*


Now for how this will play out in this Trilogy. I don't think Humans are going to catch up with Forerunners overnight, nor do I believe all out war with them or any other advanced species is coming super soon, but the last cinematic is very telling to the pace Humans are now gaining on the Forerunners.  The HUGE military constructs at the end, we've never seen ANYTHING like that.   So, I believe this Trilogy will basically be about us getting to a point where we begin to  Attain the Mantle and become equal with forerunner tech.  Reclaiming our rightful place in the Universe.

Lastly, and this part is actually really promising, if this is how the Trilogy ends up unfolding... Wow, Halo has a long future ahead.  Halo 7+ I believe will be MUCH more futuristic.  Basically back at where things were when the Flood made us run for it.   It would almost be an entire new game, but with such amazing, deep, and complex lore to back it up.  The possibilities become endless, and the integrity of the Halo Universe would become concrete.  It wouldn't feel like milking at all.  It would feel genuine, and would almost most definitely bring back that indescribable feeling of mystery and discovery the first time you immersed yourself in Halo:CE.

###/r/theterminal - Reddit's Largest Halo Clan

Becoming part of /r/theterminal is like adding an entire friends list of halo redditors - and you only have to send 1 friend request!

The Terminal connects redditors who play regularly by putting them on rosters based on their region. From there, you just look at your region's friends list (eg the gamertag will be something like ""zzzHaloEUR"") and it displays who's playing now.

We just cleared out about 400 inactive players, so we’re looking for new active redditors to play with. And besides just playing together, /r/theterminal also has youtubers, twitch streamers, and hosts tournaments and other events.

###/r/HaloCustoms - hosting more than craigslist's casual encounters

Who said custom games are dead?

When you’re tired of playing Big Team Ragnarok for the 5th time in a row, check out some posts here. You’ll find people organizing improptu game nights with the latest and greatest custom games. [Here's a video of the action!](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V_LGOl-fK7U)

/r/HaloCustoms will also be co-sponsoring weekly custom gamenights with /r/theterminal.

---

###/r/MLGHalo - wear your tryhard pants proudly

Find videos of pro gameplay and learn all the cool jumps on Haven.

Subscribers of this reddit are likely to always have the latest mlg settings and maps, and you might even find some player ready to compete. If you’re playing to win, this is a good place to search for teammates - just make sure you can carry your own.

---

###/r/HaloStory - discuss the universe

Ever wonder about Daisy-023's relationship with Halsey and her program? Does that even make sense to you? 

/r/HaloStory is a place for all the lore you could ever want, and more. Discuss everything related to the story of Halo from the Bungie Trilogy to the Reclaimer Saga.

###/r/forge - cartographers unite!

A good fraction of halo players indulge their architectural side and put a lot of effort into making maps - whether the maps are silly or strategic. Unfortunately, much of that effort goes unappreciated since it’s such a task to organize people to test your maps and get feedback.

Enter /r/forge and it’s new system: simply make a post in /r/forge describing your gametype([exemplia gratia](http://www.reddit.com/r/TheTerminal/comments/14dheb/custom_map_observatory/)) and/or map, then add it to [this database](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/lv?key=0AuF9ycAz9j6GdGR6ZG0zY1dPMmNZWTJ1M3dUV0VPQVE&amp;rm=full#gid=0).

Members will test out the map and hopefully provide feedback. You can even organize your own testing time in the post.

---

I hope this has somewhat opened your eyes to Halo beyond /r/halo. A lot of the tools above work best when we have a lot of people using them, so have at them! Just make sure you **read the sidebars of the subreddits before posting.**

Thanks to the mods and leaders of the different subreddits for putting these things together.

To briefly describe the process of building it, the armor is finished in automotive Bondo &gt; primer &gt; paint &gt; weathering &gt; clear coat. Once finished, it's incredibly durable. However, it starts with a printer, 110lb card stock, and a computer program called Pepakura. The program takes a 3D design and ""unfolds"" it into 2D shapes that can be printed out on paper, cut out, folded, and glued together. You use card stock, fiberglass resin on the outside and inside, then actual fiberglass + resin on the inside, and use bondo to finish your designs.

The AR is not from the Halo universe, but I had to make to. Before anyone gets up in arms about any potential lapses in trigger discipline, I removed the bolt carrier group from the (obviously unloaded) firearm before using it for costume purposes.

So let's start by calculating John's most recent salary information: 

As of 2557 the Chief is a Chief Petty Officer of the Navy who has effectively served for 40 years (Born in 2511, serving since age 6). Which makes him one of the most senior non-com in the navy(probably THE most senior non-com in the navy) and is being paid at the maximum Pay grade of E-9 @ 40 Years of service or greater. 

Using today's payscale, he earns $7.4k a month or just under $90k a year. 

He also gets an additional $225 in combat pay and an additional $375 for performing hazard duty (Maximum of two additional bonuses). This translates to $7200 a year in extra income. Which brings the Chief's totals to just shy of $100k. Given his epic kickass status, we are gonna round that sucker up for easy calculations. 

To calculate his *effective* **civilian** pay, we need to take into account the benefit of being tax exempt while in active combat. Using the US of A's income tax tables, one could calculate that the Chief would need to make about $135k in the civilian world to arrive at an after-tax income of $100k. 

So the Chief makes 6 figures and enjoys quite a few additional bonuses for being in the active military, what about his net assets? 

Assuming a linear progression from E-1 since his recruit days(when he was making a measly $18k a year), the total income he has earned from his services comes to roughly $2,360,000. 

Now, this is assuming that John took his pay and stuffed it under a mattress. A cool $2 million isn't bad at all for him to look forward to after uh.. 'retirement'. However, the MCPO (or whomever is handling his cash at ONI) is a smart cookie and he took the money he made and invested it in the 21st century stock market. 

As a side benefit of being in the military, he has a special savings account that guarantees him 10% return for the $10,000 he is allowed to invest in said account. That's pretty nifty, and earns him a combined total of $4 million over the course of 40 years. 

Good grief! He is now worth $6 million dollars! That retirement home is looking good, John. 

But wait, what about the rest of his earnings? Even at E-1 with no experience, he still has another $8k leftover to invest and generate some returns. 

Again, assuming his payscale progressed linearly throughout his career and also assuming that market returns in 2552 roughly reflects present day average returns on the securities market. This means that the Chief will make between 3-5% per annum on his investments. Call it 4% and let's get to the numbers: 

A gradual increase in income from 18k to 100k equals to an annual increase of just over 6.5%.  

Which means the annual increase in returns is calculated as: 

Sum[18000(1.065*1.04)^n -Sum[10000(1.04)^n 

and the net of that geometric series is roughly $7.5 Million

Add them all together and we arrive at the Chief's retirement nest egg of $13.86 Million. Nice. 

It's almost enough to run his armour for 30 seconds! 
 

This has been your daily dose of totally useless bit of knowledge!

Trivial information man - *away!*

EDIT: Frequently Asked Questions (Moved from top)
-------------------------------------------------

**Why make this list?**

The game itself doesn't tell you how to get these armor pieces until you're already making progress. If you have a piece that you really want, it can be frustrating to just level and hope you stumble into it. Finding out that a specific commendation is what you should work on lets you focus on getting that piece.

**HOW DO SPECIALIZATIONS WORK?**

Specializations are unlocked when you reach max level (50). Then you pick one, and level it up to 10. When you finish it, you unlock the associated bonuses, and get to pick a new one to work on. They're Halo's ""prestige"" system, more or less. Leveling it unlocks the armor pieces as you go. Each specialization unlocks an armor set, a skin for that armor, a weapon skin, a custom visor color, and the specialization ability. These are loadout abilities which are very good and can only be acquired by leveling your specializations. Normally you only start with 2 specs available, and it is uncertain how you will access the others. People who purchased the LE or play Halo 4 before the end of November will have access to all specializations as soon as they hit 50.

**I didn't get the Mark VI unlock even though I bet the game on Legendary! What gives?!**

Some people have complained they beat the game and didn't unlock this. Check your Legendary Commendation. The servers were probably down and you probably missed credit for 1 or 2 levels, you'll just need to do those again. Sorry.

Confirmed : You can get the Mark VI if you complete some missions solo and some co-op.

**How do I switch between different skins?**

Alternative ""skin"" patterns for weapons and armor are treated as seperate items which perform the exact same as the normal items. For example, the arctic BR works just like a normal BR. You will have 2 BRs in your inventory to choose from for your loadouts. You can get a skin for a weapon you haven't unlocked yet (they're seperate weapons) such as getting the Hazop FRST as soon as you enter a preorder code, but you still have to unlock the regular Hazop seperately. After doing so, you will have both available as options. Anything with FRST or AEON after it is a skin.

**How do I unlock the Chest piece / Shoulder piece?**

Most of these will unlock a helmet, both shoulders, and the chest at the same time. (Most helms have matching chest and shoulders). Legs and arms are separate unlocks not tied to the helmet/shoulder/chest set.

**How do I get X Master Commendation?**

Commendations can be viewed and tracked from the player menu where you can choose your loadout and armor, go up and view your commendations, it should be in the middle. Each one when completed will unlock the next rank of the same commendation, and Master is the final rank for each.

**Is this everything?**

Probably not. There's at least a few skins not on this list, and a several arms and legs aren't on the list. Furthermore, nobody can get all the achievements since some depend upon having future Spartan Ops missions not currently available. So there could be some kind of Hayabsa or Mark V, but try not to get your hopes up too much. These are all the same sets that were shown off before the game was released.",Unlocks,False,self,t5_2qixk,1352818420.0,misc,28,True,t3_12x8fs,http://www.reddit.com/r/halo/comments/12x8fs/list_of_armor_unlock_requirements/,

Today in ""Tips that I shouldn't really have to tell you"", I will be discussing the wraith.  First off, it is not a rock.  It can be used to break line of sight, but if you stand right next to it, the wraith cannot move without slamming into you and betraying you.  

You see, the wraith is a wild thing.  It yearns to be free from human interference.  It roams the plains of larger maps, and it just wants to be left alone.  Unfortunately, some people insist on using it as their own personal moving barricade, or they have convinced themselves that they are ""supporting"" the wraith like it's a tank in a WWII movie.  It's not.  It requires space to maneuver so that it can reposition itself in case predators like banshees and warthogs have approached it from behind.  It must also do this to avoid plasma pistol wielding human poachers.  You see, Exile and Vortex are hardly hospitable sounding places, and life for the wraith is hard.   Everyone is gunning for that sweet hero status as the guy who took one down, so it must always be on it's guard while it's racking up it's 20+ freebie kills.


Now, if you insist on being that guy (and you play halo, so there's a 30% chance that you do), then prepare to get run over, because if you've ever driven a wraith, you know that you can list lazily to the left and crush pretty much everything (no boosting required).  It's like swimming next to a blue whale.  Yes, the blue whale means you no harm, but if you insist on swimming right next to it's flippers, the whale will not be held responsible if you are crushed and drown.  


So, let the wraith be free.  Let it roam, and observe from a distance, and if you insist on being a helpy helper person, just shoot those poachers right off it's back, and together we can preserve the wraith and win a game through good ole fashioned vehicle whoring.  Thank you.


Seriously though, no more warnings.  You people know who you are, and I'm not even gonna try to avoid you anymore.  I'm gonna run you over, take your power weapon and hop back in my wraith, because you're obviously too stupid to have said power weapon.  The End.

Hi everyone!

As you may or may not be aware, I have been creating a [full Halo universe timeline](http://www.reddit.com/r/HaloStory/comments/1akan6/i_am_constructing_a_full_halo_universe_timeline/) with the help of some /r/HaloStory and /r/halo community members for the past 2 months. I [originally stated](http://www.reddit.com/r/HaloStory/comments/1ciftj/timeline_to_be_released_in_2_weeks/) it would be released on May 1st, however, I have made faster progress than I was expecting and feel that it is ready to be released.

I am currently finishing some last minute entries, but those will be updated in the coming days and weeks ahead.

In my last post I said ""I have a total of 431 entries and am expecting at least 50 more before the release,"" however, that turned out to be **way** off. In the past 11 days I have added 330 more entries for a grand total of 761!

I will include more information and a proper thanks to those helpful people who made contributions in my post tomorrow.

The first initial days of the self post only time were fantastic. There was nothing but quality content and a few harmless joke threads. It was something great to read for you and easy to moderate for us.

When a self post is made about a topic, that topic is broken down and discussed to the ground in that thread. After a few days and eventually a week, the quality of the self post began to fade. This is mainly due to Halo 4 not changing enough to create new conversations on a daily basis.

So how do we grab that new initial great quality content and not let it grow stale? There will be three days (weekends) dedicated to self post, then links will be brought back for the remainder of the week, so a nice balance is kept. The reason for this is so self posts stay strong and high in quality. Also, these weekends will most likely increase the amount of self post during the weekdays.

As for the links, we do admit. It got crazy here and a little bit annoying. We will be starting a 'Pic of the Week' thread. This will decrease the amount of pics that may be posted when the file share is up. Why post in this thread? The winner will have their pic in the sidebar for that week. For anyone who was here when Anniversary was released, we had a pic in the sidebar that would change up. This made the subreddit refreshing and we're bringing it back in a new way.

Links will be brought back Monday and /r/halo will be restricted to self post Friday-Sunday.

Here is the link: http://halocaptures.com/

I have already served a ton of people and hopefully some of them will be browsing reddit and be able to vouch for how sweet this service is. I plan on keeping it free for as long as possible but if it ever costs money it will be something really cheap.
(Something like $0.10 per minute)

Right now its still free.
I always have this tab open in the browser so if you have any questions I will answer them as fast as I can. I make money using google adsense so I don't have to charge for this service. Ads should show up as soon as google approves my website.

I got in, and immediately I was EMP'd by a charged plasma pistol. I looked around, and there were three of my dudes near me throwing plasma nades and shooting charge shots at me.

I was immobile. I managed to dodge a spartan laser an enemy shot at me from the center hill, but was blown up by my own guys. I didn't die, but the little fuckers were griefing everyone who got in the Mantis.

I managed to get it again, purely by chance, when I was evading an enemy warthog. It just spawned right there. I got across the river and guess what? EMP'd again. The fuckers just wouldn't give up. 

Griefers ruin the game for everyone. If you are a griefer, fucking stop. In the terms South Park uses, you are huge fucking faggots who need to have your asses kicked.

Here's three important tips/hints about the railgun that it seems like a heck of a lot of people don't know.

1) Scoping with the railgun: as you should know, the railgun doesn't have a scope, which significantly decreases its effectiveness at range. However, your Spartan still has his binoculars. If you go into your binoculars and attempt to charge the railgun, it'll simply bring you out of binoculars. However, if you start charging the railgun, and THEN go into your binoculars, you can use the crosshairs on the screen to aim the shot, and it actually works fairly well, like this was a planned strategy by 343.

2) A lot of people are complaining that the railguns fire time is inconsistent: YOU CAN CONTROL WHEN THE RAILGUN FIRES. The railgun has a one second charge up time, and it can hold the shot for 4-5 seconds. Most people just hold the trigger until the railgun fires, assuming it works like the Spartan Laser. As soon as the Railgun is charged, simply let go of the trigger and the railgun will fire. This means that you can fire the railgun in around a second, leaving people no time to evade or kill you. Simply watch the capacitor display on the gun or on you HUD, and as soon as they reach the top, the railgun is ready to fire. 

3) This really only applies to Spartan ops, but the railgun is the ONLY power weapon (besides the shotgun) you can refill from an ammo box. Regardless if its a weapons cache or an ammo box, you can fire your explosive slugs all day long free in the knowledge that you have infinite ammo for it. Don't be afraid of firing your railgun!!! 

Seriously, the Railgun is a frickin' awesome gun, and really, really, really effective if you know how to use it properly.",,False,self,t5_2qixk,False,,40,True,t3_14k0gl,http://www.reddit.com/r/halo/comments/14k0gl/notes_on_the_railgun/,

On December 4th I got a call at work from my roommate, telling me the apartment was on fire. I thought he was joking till he said he watched our pets carried out...

I left work and headed home, trying to hold myself together. Red Cross set us up with a hotel room and money for food. There were a lot of emotions that night.

A few days later I decided to try to get one of our xbox 360s and clean it up and see if it would work at the hotel room. After some scrubbing it actually worked! Halo 4 had been in the disc drive and was the only game that made it. So I bought a controller, a headset and hooked it up to wireless. While it was a material thing, and not something ""important"" it felt great to feel like something was ""normal"" again and I could escape my worries. It made me feel like things would be okay again.

Insurance is replacing our things, slowly but surely and now we have a new place that we love. I just wanted to post my story about how much Halo really helped me. Losing my dog and almost all of my belongs right before the Holidays was rough, and being single / lonely didn't help much either. Halo was my escape, if not my savior. 

I've made a [new Halo 4 video with commentary](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nuBJwCB2mxw) talking a bit about how things are and where my channel is going, as well as started a [vlog channel](http://www.youtube.com/justjed05). Feel free to Czech them out and thanks for supporting and being here for me /r/Halo and friends.

**Edit / Update**: Just wanted to say thanks to all the kind words and comments. Just so it is clear we do have a new place and have replaced most things.

Chief would do the exact same thing. Like Chief, he is a brilliant soldier. That said, he's also opposite to Chief in many ways.

The Chief is noted by Cortana to be lucky. That's why he stood out. Lasky, on the other hand, I don't know you could describe the same way. Yes, the appearance of the chief was lucky in FUD, but he's lost his brother, his best friend cum romantic interest, he doesn't really know his mother and God knows what happened to his father.

Unlike the Chief, Lasky is undoubtedly human. He is the one cadet we saw who didn't blindly accept the UNSC's propaganda and struggled with orders because he had a hard time resolving that soldiers and humanity had to be separate. The Chief doesn't really consider himself human, seemingly considering himself more of a separate entity set to defend humanity.

Finally, and perhaps most importantly, the Chief, though born to civilians, was built for war. Lasky, though born to a soldier, was not.

Well I managed to find one similar to those in the Campaign Mission Composer. There ""soft wall"" allows us to basically get out of the map and you can actually get to - what I call - The Space Battle. Its a very interesting area to explore. You can go weaponless and also there is a hidden Cortana Model under one of the building. I thought it was a very cool area so I threw together a tutorial on how to do it :D

Hope you enjoy it. You guys should try it and see if there is anything else out there.

The Great Journey will go on through February 1st, 2nd, 3rd so there will be plenty of time to gather up team mates, or you can just head straight into matchmaking now to experience a weekend of nostalgia and fun!

Feel free to post your gamertags here if you are in need of players, or if you have any comments regarding this event

I don't know if it's too much to ask but can everyone please spread the word of *The Great Journey* by posting this [image of the event](http://th01.deviantart.net/fs71/PRE/f/2013/029/d/4/halo_3__the_great_journey_by_deepfriedd0nut-d5t6mto.png) on FaceBook, Twitter, and anywhere else you see fit?   

We need to let the world know what an impact that Halo 3 has had in our lives, and we need to gather enough players to rightfully send Halo 3 out *with a bang.*

If you're interested in distinguishing yourself from all the other players, here are some links on what flairs to put on.

How to make our official emblem:  http://i.imgur.com/F92Qr9A.jpg

Our Reddit tag/colors:  http://i.imgur.com/POU9cLy.jpg

Throughout this weekend I will be giving out prizes such as Microsoft points, Xbox Live gold, and various other prizes if you any of you win a match against me in matchmaking.

Just make sure to send me a message after the game ends saying that you're from Reddit, and I'll be sure to give you any prizes that I have left.

Here's my service record for those of you wondering who to look for in matchmaking:  http://i.imgur.com/ZvMS0hG.jpg

###Here's a graph showing everyone that is looking for players! :)  

Can everyone please have a preference to what you want to play?  It will make it easier for others to find games if you do!

______________

Here are some FAQS from the original creator of the event 
*NazzerDawk*


**Q) One last time? Does this mean Halo 3 is being taken down?**


A) No, but this is a single push to get people on all at once, because attempts to repopulate the servers long-term never really work. If it's a success, then we can keep doing this on the first weekend of every month, but I'd rather just have everyone on at once*

**Q) Halo 3 is dead, why are you doing this? (Or: these never work!)**

*A) I've already gauged the interest and managed to get tons of people interested specifically because this is a one-time event. Previous attempts to repopulate the servers failed because they were long-term repopulation attempts, not one-time events.*

**Q) How do I get involved?**

*A) Just get on Halo 3 matchmaking on Febuary 1st, 2nd, or 3rd! Get your friends to do the same! There's no sign-up, no fee, no pledge, no need to message me, and if you miss the first day, get on the second or the third! That's all there is to it: Just play*.

**Q) Why can't we keep playing? Why just these three days?**

*A) The event is just these three days, but that doesn't mean you can't keep playing!*

1352669261.0,389,self.halo,130z8c,Master Chief's Face And You.,507,118,180,http://www.reddit.com/r/halo/comments/130z8c/master_chiefs_face_and_you/,"There's a lot of controversy going around as to whether 343i did the right thing showing Master Chief's face/eyes and the correct answer is: Yes.

Why? Well first of all, you have to understand this is a new trilogy. It brings nothing from the previous other than background history, some characters, and bits and pieces. You need to realize that this trilogy is tackling a different subject than the previous and shouldn't be trying to put the two together. Yes, both trilogies are titled ""Halo"" but only the first trilogy is actually about the Halos, the second is about the Forerunners and it just brings the Halo title back because anything else would just seem a bit off.

Why should you be okay with *now* seeing his face? Because it is a critical part of the theme, message, and point Halo 4 is trying to bring. The new trilogy partially about Chief's humanity and how he is as a person and a soldier. You have to understand that Chief is indeed *broken* as the previous CGI trailer stated. He doesn't know how to feel, react, or interact with ordinary people as portrayed by Cortana in the game; You see Master Chief just shrug or barely even move to every statement Cortana says, were he a normal person he'd smile, laugh, and so on.

It's not until the moment John witnesses Cortana leave him that he realizes he actually feels something. From that point till he stands alone on the deck of Infinity he is thinking about it because he really doesn't know how to behave, Cortana's death was the catalyst that makes Chief realizes he really does have problems he never saw or understood before.

The moment Lasky tells him ""You say that like soldiers and humanity are two different things,"" is when he realizes what Cortana has been trying to get him to do or even say for so long. That's when he recalls her promise, ""Promise me that by the end of this you'll figure out which one of us is the machine."" and how she also said that bout him being a machine. Chief's major reason for being so connected to Cortana isn't just because he likes her or needed her, it's because he promised and made it his duty to protect her. He only realized he actually needed and maybe even wanted her only at this point. He never reacted socially with Cortana because he was just following orders to keep her safe, which is why he kept persisting on saying that she'll be okay and he'll find a way to fix her.

It's without a doubt that Halo 5 will tackle the transition of Master Chief from being a broken anti-social soldier to anything that's close to a human being, learning how to feel, smile, enjoy, and so on. This trilogy sets out to dwell deeper into what is Master Chief John-117 and his relationship with Cortana. It's highly speculated that Cortana might comeback due to her being taken by the Librarian, she may have cataloged some of her data but as of right now she is *dead* and John knows this.

So, why should you be okay with Master Chief's face and what else may come? Because John **needs** it, and it would probably help him a lot if you support him through it.

**TL;DR?** - It's for the better being of Chief to go down this path.",SPOILERS,False,self,t5_2qixk,1352693702.0,campaign,CSR-50,True,t3_130z8c,http://www.reddit.com/r/halo/comments/130z8c/master_chiefs_face_and_you/,

I was only about 10 years old at the time and my parents wouldn't let me play violent video games so my big brother would take me over to his friend's house to play split screen halo in their basement. We would be yelling at each other where the flag was dropped or where the other team was at. communication was key to winning. 


A few years passed and I made my own friends friends who had an Xbox (me and my brother had a PS2 that we hated at the time and lusted over our friend's Xboxs haha!), halo 2 came out and I remember thinking how awesome it was being that you could play over Xbox Live with complete strangers. EVERYBODY had their mics plugged in and actively communicated to push our team toward victory.


by the time halo 3 came out i had my own 360 and my parents finally saw though that halo would not turn me into a mass murderer. anyways, much like halo 2, communicating over microphones was very important. But then Microsoft released the party chat feature and suddenly the matches i was playing in were silent. nobody was calling out ""one shots"" or flag drops.  


Reach was plagued by the same eerie silence. 


Halo 4, is sadly the same as well. by why?


For example, my brother who just got the game last week played match making for the first time with me yesterday. We were in a party chat while in the lobby when my brother prompted that we should leave the chat so we could talk to our teammates. I told him that not many people use thier mic, and as we entered match after match, it was just my brother and i talking to each other on the time while everyone else had their mics unplugged. 


My brother got irritated and began telling people to plug their mics in, but the players remained silent; mics unplugged.


So I want to ask you, reddit, why don't you plug your mic in? are you guys shy? Are you avoiding trolls? I just don't understand. Halo has such a great community but it is lacking communication. i made sooooooooo many friends when i played halo 2 and 3 just because i was talking to other people online. That never happens anymore... :(",,False,self,t5_2qixk,False,,CSR-14,True,t3_16brk3,http://www.reddit.com/r/halo/comments/16brk3/why_dont_you_use_your_mic/,

**I'VE UPDATED THIS LIST**
Last update on 11/30/2012

Lets start with the Multiplayer problems.

* Ragnarok and Haven - Don't get me wrong at all, they're great maps, but I'm getting tired of them. 20 times a day is 12 times too much. Exile seems to be the new problem, but isn't nearly as bad. (Weighting on these has been patched)  
* Flood - Used to love Infection in Halo Reach, but I feel that Magnum is absolutely useless. Either let ammo be picked up, or keep it 1 shot. The flood should only have sprint, and evade was what ruined Infection in Reach, and this is no different. Ordinance would also be cool too, but it isn't 100% necessary. Consider more than 1 gametype as well. Remember Halo 3? That was good times.    
* Ammo - I know the game can't handle having so many renders on the map because graphics are absolutely everything, but there has to be a workaround to the lack of ammo on the map, and the fact that everything despawns on the map within 12 seconds or less, I hate picking up Sniper and knowing I'm stuck with it unless I go bombing into the firefight on the map. Edit: 343 has slightly patched weapon despawn times, and having the ammo perk works wonders.  
* Lack of Maps - This kind of ties in with the reason that Ragnarok and Haven are being chosen, but more maps need to be added. Remember Reach? We had community made forge maps, let's do that.   
* Little X - Everyone's complaining about this, and I'm no exception. We need little death Xs when people die. It helps.  
* Warthog Turret - All I'm saying is that it needs a bit of a boost. Not much, but enough to manage a kill or 2.
* More Ordinance - This could be a workaround to the lack of ammo thing. Have more ordinance spawn randomly in random spots on the map, and have them spawn with stock weapons (AR, BR, DMR, Magnum, etc)  
* More Focus on Objective - This only needs to be toned a bit, seeing as objective focus is better than Reach, but I still feel and know that teammates aren't helping at all, derping around and making me lose.   
* Betrayals - I haven't experienced being betrayed for Sniper or Mech, but a lot of people are complaining about having their vehicles raped by teammates in Slayer, not giving a boot option, because they technically weren't betrayed. We need to remove Sniper horny fags with a ban or workaround of some sort.  
* The Wall Glitches - Pretty straightforward on this one. Campfags find an exploit. Give 'em a killzone or an invisible wall to stop them from winning Oddball games ridiculously easily. Edit: All of the known glitches have been patched by 343.
* Split-Screen Lag - There's been a lot of framerate drop from splitscreen apparently. Needs to be fixed ASAP.  
* Playlists - I know 343 is planning on working on this, so it's low priority, but big things on the list are - Team Snipers, FFA (Rumble Pit), Regular and Big Team Objective Gametypes, Action Sack, Grifball (Already confirmed) and more variants of Slayer, like Team BRs, Team DMRs, Team Swords, etc.   Edit: Team Snipers and FFA have returned.
* Free-For-All W/L Ratio - Give a win to the top 3 or 4 players rather than the top 1. People care about their W/L and that's not helping much.    
* XP Cap - I believe 343 is going to raise the cap after a few weeks. The cap was so that if boosting exploits were found, they could be patched before any real xp could be earned. Still being complained about, though.    Edit: XP cap has been raised.
* Kill Cams [Added] - There is no way I got killed by some guy shooting at the ground, I'm just sayin'.  
* Sword Lunge [Added] - They *said* that they were gimping the sword, when in reality they made it more OP. It's become MW2's commando.  
* Vehicles [Added] - There are some people complaining about the amount of vehicles in BTB. I can agree that on some maps, like Exile have way *too* much stuff going on.
* Gauss Hog [Added] - Unless you have more than willing teammates, that hog is not going down. I've had games on Exile where I spawned and died within a span of 10 seconds because of that god damned thing. I say it should spawn halfway through the game, or something like that. (Maybe not halfway, but don't spawn it instantly)
* Moving While Score Checking [Added] - I say it was useful as hell in Reach, as small as a thing it was. It shouldn't be too hard to bring that back, right?  
* Voting [Added] - Add a ""None of the above"" option.
* After Game XP Screen [Added] - Show all Commendation and Challenge XP.

Custom Games -   
* More customization and compatibility - I believe 343 is working on this, but it still needs addressing.    

Forge -   
* A ""Forge World"" Map - People have been asking this non-stop. They need a forge world map, because the other ones aren't cutting it. 1 Big &gt; 3 Small    
* Small Issues - Bringing back stuff like precision controls and zoom, and fixing issues with Co-ordinates, locking, and magnets.     

If there is anything to add, just shoot a comment, and if I think it's necessary, I'll put it in.  

Halo 4 is a great game so far, and with these implementations, I think it could become a better game.",,False,self,t5_2qixk,1354285873.0,,CSR-12,True,t3_135n7a,http://www.reddit.com/r/halo/comments/135n7a/things_that_343_needs_to_address_in_upcoming/,

The name would have fairly tame words in it, as the military loves to make themselves sound as peaceful as possible, so Space Command would be a good choice over something synonymous with a war machine.So we end up with the United Nations Space Command.

Unlike Star Trek, it's not idealist and unrealistic (although I still love Trek to death, and it's not meant to be realistic), and unlike shows like Firefly, it's not an oppressive clusterfuck. However, *like* Firefly, there is a lot of dissent coming from the native off-worlders, far from Earth, which is absolutely a danger. It's similar to Babylon 5 and Mass Effect, where the Earth government and the military are uncomfortably close, and that were super arrogant and expansive.",,False,self,t5_2qixk,1364146786.0,,,True,t3_1awv68,http://www.reddit.com/r/halo/comments/1awv68/the_unsc_is_one_of_the_most_realistic_idea_for_a/,

First I just want to start off that I'm not upset with all of you.  The vast majority of you have been doing a spectacular job following the rules &amp; providing great content to this subreddit.  You are the reason why I have grown to love this subreddit for the past couple of years, and I want to make sure that you continue to contribute for years to come. 

With that said, it is unfortunate that the vocal minority in this subreddit are ruining the enjoyment of others with the negative content and subreddit drama they've been causing.  The amount of negativity, racism, excessive downvoting, hatred, and total disrespect to other users opinions these vocal users have been exhibiting have gone on for far too long and it's about time something is done about it.

Effective immediately there will be some new policies and rules in r/halo to ensure that this subreddit can continue to be a sanctuary for Halo players of all kinds.

---

####New Policies

1: Any disrespect towards another user will result in a permaban from this subreddit. Disagreeing with other opinions is ok but that doesn't give you the right to downvote and harass them. (I've been issuing temporary bans to rampant users, but I guess a 1 day ban is not good enough for them to stop their behavior.)

2:  Don't push your opinions onto others and state them as facts. (There have been too many users starting arguments with others here that truly believe that they know exactly what needs to be done to 'save' Halo.

 * For example:  Don't tell others to basically f*** off if they say anything positive about Halo 4.  (You'd be surprised how often I have to remove these comments)

3: Please be kind to our newer users.  People are still getting into this wonderful series, and we should be welcoming them with open arms instead of disrespecting them whenever they ask for assistance.  Rude comments such as ""get gud bitch, play shitfinity slayer, stop being a fag will be removed, and they will receive a temporary ban from this subreddit.

4:  Off topic comments will be removed immediately, and any insulting off-topic comments will warrant you in a perma-ban from this subreddit.

* Reason:  The silent users and respected members of this community have informed me that they're growing tired on how often some of you turn a good discussion into something flammatory.  Just this morning some innocent user received dozens of insults towards his family just because some of you had an issue with one of his comments.  

5:  Don't downvote based on your personal opinion.  Please judge the content based on the quality of their submission instead of using it as a I don't like this button.  The downvote arrow's original intent is to make unnecessary comments less known to the public, and to support high quality content.

Please feel free to [private message me](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=OpTic_Niko) if you have any questions about these new policies.  We're doing our best to help make sure this subreddit can be as best as it can be, and we need your assistance to help us reach that goal!

---

####I have one last thing to say

Please be free to use that report button to report any disrespectful comments that you may stumble across. I'm always here to get rid of said content, and issue consequences to users that refuse to follow the rules. Our subreddit receives around 1,000 comments a day, and consider it a public service to report anything that I may have missed.

Thank you for taking time out of your day to read this.

I think people need to realize that the game is 4 days old and that changes will be made. I made a list of the things I thought were great about H4. Mind you, I'm sure people have different opinions on some of the things.

* Infinity Slayer - In the older Halos, I wouldn't go even NEAR the slayer gametypes. It was simply a race for power weapons, and one team usually raped the others. I felt a lot better playing Team Snipers.
Infinity Slayer impressed me in H4 with the ordinance drops and such, and its a game type that I actually like playing.
* Loadouts - Everyone is crying over how they ""stole this from CoD"". CoD stole a LOT more from Halo and still made a (in my opinion) terrible game. I like being able to choose which weapon I use and I hated being forced to use the god awful assault rifle while playing reach. I like choice. 
* Ordinance Drops - Simple on this one. Hated people sitting on Sniper or Shotgun, etc. On Reach. Ordinance kind of takes the focus off camping at a set spot waiting for their precious sniper. Although, I do miss being able to snag some DMR ammo quick when I ran out, rather than bombing into battle to snag some off a teammate, usually getting me killed.
* Maps - SOOO many complaints about the maps. Ok, I agree too that they're cluttered, but you have to work with them and you eventually adjust, like I keep saying, it's 4 days old, calm down! Personally, I really like the maps, and thought they were VERY well made.
* Lack of playlists - Like I said, 4 days old. SWAT and FFA is coming back, just wait 'til Tuesday. Try the other playlists. I played all of them today, and like all of them. Do something different, try something **other** than flood, you'll like it, I swear!
* Objective - In Halo Reach, objective game types were translated to ""6 guy kill whoring while 2 grabbed the objective"" I see a LOT of people actually focusing on objective in this game, and I love it. Being one of those 6 people, even I have a better time grabbing some hill time, or covering my teammate's ass while he runs a flag in.
* OP weapons - Get used to it! Everything in this game has a counter to it, and each weapon is suited for a purpose. There's a reason you can't have a SAW as a primary, because it's better, you have to earn it. Sick of getting out DMR'd? Learn which weapons are better than it, or use a DMR yourself. I have 0 problem killing DMR users now. 
* Innovation - It's no wonder people love CoD so much. 343 goes and makes a brand new game with brand new weapons, interfaces, graphics. Something fresh, and it gets pounded on for it. CoD releases the same game with new maps and a couple new weapons and the 12 year olds go apeshit. 
* Join Session - Can't tell you how many times I played Reach where my teammates left me to a 1v4. I understand that joining a game where you're getting raped is a lost cause, but instead of complaining, use the rest of the match to figure out enemies' strategies and how to better focus on beating them.

Anyways, I think people should realize the potential this game has, and that 343 is trying to innovate and create something new, not repeat what already is. If you miss ""how Halo 3 was"" go play Halo 3. We're not stopping you. There is not a lot of things wrong with Halo 4, and I hope 343 keeps taking necessary steps to remove any problems.
Any of the stupid things, (No ammo at all, etc.), stop being so spoiled and learn to figure out how to work around it yourself. 

Edit: Nearly forgot. I praise 343 dearly for armor abilities. Nothing is OP. No more armor lock. I used to HATE Hologram and Active camo because it was useless. Hologram is #1 spot on Halo 4 for me, and it's saved me so many times (plus the badass teabagging feature) I HATED Armor Lock, and nearly ripped my eyebrows off - which was fixed with the more balanced Hardlight Shield. Finally, Jetpack was overused, and way too overpowered and is definitely easier to win against in Halo 4.",,False,self,t5_2qixk,1352592161.0,,CSR-12,True,t3_12zgy8,http://www.reddit.com/r/halo/comments/12zgy8/on_a_positive_note/,

*I would just like to thank all the users here (especially the Moderators) for making r/halo my favorite online forum to browse and discuss about the Halo series (:  Sure I may question the things that you do sometimes, but I look past the little things and enjoy all the content that you have to offer.  For that reason is why I'm doing this giveaway so I can give back to the community that I love so much &lt;3*

Like all giveaways, there are going to be few rules of what you must do  in order to partake in this.  Don't worry it's nothing too bad ;(

**The giveaway is now over!  Now I am going to spend the rest of the night picking out the winners :D!**

*The Noble 20*

1:  **Strafeh** |  [I tried to find a good enough picture that was clean] (http://nikon.bungie.org/images/SuperintendentWallpaper.jpg)
;)

__________________________________________________________

2:  **GiverOfReddit** | During the three-year development of Halo 3, the team at Bungie reportedly put away over 20,000 pounds of cheesy pizza goodness, 24,000 gallons of soda and a half ton of bananas.

__________________________________________________________

3:  **InsanelyFoxy** | On September 30, 2003, Gearbox Software ported Halo for the PC and added a few extra features, too. Later, a Macintosh version of Halo was made, referred to as Halo Mac.
Also: http://halo.bungie.org/misc/sloftus_characterscale/ That website (edited because I thought it wouldn't hyperlink from my phone but it did) lets you compare almost ANY character from the Halo series in heights. 1) Just select your characters and hit compare. 2) Sit back and enjoy how minuscule us humans are compared to every other creature

__________________________________________________________

4:  **MattyMcD** |  Halo 4 is the only game that has interchangeable Spartan butt plates. It's also the only game to feature 7 different types of asses. (Seriously Matty?)

__________________________________________________________

5:  **Airilsai** | The Humans and the Forerunners fought a massive war after the humans 'purged' a Forerunner planet of the Flood by destroying all life on it. After a long war, the Forerunners de-evolved the humans, and eventually Composed them to become the Didact's Promethean army.

__________________________________________________________

6:  **Duscon** | 343 Guilty Spark from the games in real life would be about the same size as the Halo: Reach legendary edition box!
PS: Congratz on becoming a mod!

__________________________________________________________

7:  **Sparknish** | Out of all the wars the covenant had to fight to gain members. The Grunts were the hardest. 

__________________________________________________________ 

8:  **FourMakesTwoUNLESS** | While 343 were working on Halo CE: Anniversary, they tried to develop a way to add DLC armor to Reach. The GRD helmet that was (accidentally? probably purposely) [leaked in a screenshot](http://i.imgur.com/QHouNjq.jpg)  got people wondering about it. David Ellis from 343 finally confirmed it in February of last year:
We were prototyping and experimenting with adding new armor variants as part of the Anniversary release. Unfortunately, that feature was cut due to time/resource constraints. The [Spartan plushies](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWIdXfU2Tdo) on the Anniversary Maps are an acknowledgement of that via easter egg.
It makes you wonder if they succeeded in developing a method for Halo 4. We'll have to wait and see! [Also here's a little bonus](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZN-FEpQF3Yc), a video of a modded GRD helmet in Reach.

__________________________________________________________

12:  **masterbob985** | The Halo 2 Beta had many things, both usable and not, that would never see the light of day for years.
[A Driveable Mongoose](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VhGsIBZ0KWk)
Theater Mode
BR had single shot zoomed and triple shot unzoomed (Light Rifle)

[Revenant in multiplayer](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GLRvro0BCf4)
Halo 2 was RIDICULOUSLY ambitious. I honestly wonder how the game would have turned out if they didn't cut out so much content.

__________________________________________________________

13:  **Aerostrike04** | Did you know the Gravity Hammer that we see in current Halo: games was based of the predecessor used by Tartarus in halo 2. Rightfully named the Fist of Rukt. This bludgeon wielded by exceptional Jiralhanae Chieftans, it not only was used for ceremonial purposes but it also had properties that instilled magnetic and gravitational properties that could deal massive damage to a surrounding area. This hammer's also nicknamed the BanHammer, B!am-Hammer,or in RvB terms""Sports Equipment""......Et tu, Brute?

__________________________________________________________

14:  **insufficient_funds** | Initially, Halo CE was being developed as a non-console game, intended for simultaneous release for PC and Mac. Back then, Apple was one of the biggest backers of Halo; so much so that Steve Jobs talked about it in the 1999 MacWorld Expo, however the following year Microsoft bought Bungie and had the game changed to be for the Xbox.

__________________________________________________________

15:  **IPrayHaro** | The reason obscene text is replaced with ""Blam!"" within the games comes from before Halo: CE.
Jason Jones, the project lead had originally called Halo: CE ""Monkey Nuts,"" and since he couldn't bring himself up to telling his mother that he was working on a project called ""Monkey Nuts"" he gave it the code name ""Blam!""
Now ""Blam!"" is an ongoing joke, used to replace text that someone wouldn't say/show to their mother.

__________________________________________________________

16:  **SpecOpsoo7** | The Heart Attack armor effect in Halo: Reach was first used in a prank pulled on Marty O'Donnell. Marty stepped in front of a cinematic shoot, ""dancing"" on his way to the break room. The footage was sent to Steve Scott, the FX Lead, and he came up [with this .gif .](http://images1.wikia.nocookie.net/__cb20130120155410/halo/images/e/eb/USER_Marty_bailar%C3%ADn_H3ODST.gif)
The Halo 3: ODST team kept it a secret and snuck it into Marty's own famous Easter egg, the [Siege of Madrigal](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHqvzih_bgg). This song plays at a hidden location in all Bungie Halo games. What Marty didn't know was that if a player found that location in Halo 3: ODST on Legendary, the above .gif would also show up.
You can read more about it in [Bungie Mail Sack.](http://halo.bungie.net/news/content.aspx?cid=32054)

19:  **Sony_Vita_Marketing** | The Bungie Studios team consumed more than 20,000 pounds of pizza, 24,000 gallons of soda and more than a half ton of bananas during the three years it took to develop “Halo 3.”
Imagine if this was Halo 4 and they had 2XP on that soda.
Now back to lurking and fighting to SR130, I'll be back to post when Halo comes out on Vita.

20:  **RawrCola**| Soren-066 watched his stepfather die because his stepfather refused to take his sick mother to the hospital (who eventually died because of this) . His stepfather got the same illness as his mother.
Addition facts about this: The Stepfather didn't take the mother to the hospital because he was running an illegal farm that he didn't want anyone to find out about. He also kept the dead mother in a locked room.

The description is incredibly misleading, because what you have to do for the challenge isn't clearly outlined.~~

~~The challenge description leads you to believe you have to kill the king 18 times. That's not the case.~~

~~The actual objective is to get 18 kills **AS** the king, or **AGAINST** the king.~~

~~So, when you kill the king, that's 1 point. When you get a kill on anyone else while you are the king, that's another point.~~ 

~~If you're not the king and you kill someone who isn't king, that's when you don't get a point.~~

~~The first few games I tried to do it I thought you had to kill the king 18 times. Needless to say I didn't get it. Three matches later I did a bit of searching around and found out this info.~~

A quote from the article 
&gt;“It wasn’t flawless by any stretch of the imagination, but by most objective criteria, it was a resounding success. So we know we have a lot to do. And we know we have a lot to learn. But we also know that we now have the capacity, the teamwork, the technology and the experience to do much better next time.”

* Lastly, this: http://au.ign.com/articles/2013/01/18/halo-4-spartan-ops-finally-fulfills-its-potential. A quote 
&gt;""During the mid-season break, 343 Industries worked to strengthen the second half of Spartan Ops season one by addressing fan feedback and important criticisms head-on. First and foremost, the gameplay and story intertwine in more meaningful ways, with first-person cutscenes, mid-mission radio chatter, and character motivations meant to connect you to more than just combat. Objectives throughout Episode Six tie closer to events going on elsewhere -- **in the first chapter, Crimson had been captured by the same Covenant group that captured Spartan Thorne during the mid-season finale. Their escape involved Ghosts, optional Banshees, ground-based combat, a lot of Jackals and suicidal Grunts, sneaking through groups of sleeping Covenant, and a brutal airstrike.""**

I don't know if it's just me, but are we seeing the first solid signs that 343i are listening to fan feedback and actually taking legitimate action? For Frank O'Connor to admit that 343i did things wrong with Halo 4, then to promise that the next game will be better is a pretty good sign. It means that (even though not much has been done about it so far) they have seen and acknowledged fan criticisms.


An update on two things that fans have been complaining about since day 1

And finally a promising update (one which I am personally very excited about) on the future of Spartan Ops. See: the section of the quote that is in bold. One of the criticisms of both the Halo 4 campaign and Spartan Ops is that there wasn't much variety in the objectives. Words like ""Button Pushing Simulator 4"" were thrown around. The part in bold seems to be directly addressing that. This means that the gameplay will have more variety and might not get as boring as quickly, and the fact that episodes 6 - 10 will be set in brand new environments honestly sounds like a step forward in the right direction. This could mean that Halo 5 will have be a more invigorating experience (even though I loved 4)

Personally, I don't have many complaints about Halo 4, I really enjoyed it. But alas, I know a lot of people do.

Part One - The Forerunners (Circa ~100,000 BC) - [Audio version by Hageshii001](http://vocaroo.com/i/s18tRDZ6PRu9)
Hundreds of thousands of years ago, there were the Precursors, a super-technologically advanced species that created all life as we know it, as well as The Mantle; something of a philosophy, a religion, that forebade killing and whatnot. Amongst their creations were the Flood, Forerunners, and Humans. The Precursors would exterminate all species determined to be unworthy of the Mantle, and would determine their worthiness using the Flood as a test. The Forerunners then went to war with the Precursors, killing them, and then claimed to be the inheritors of the Mantle, and used that to establish authority.

Many years later, the humans discovered a ship with containers of a powder. It turned out this made great for domesticating pets. They and the San'Shyuum (more commonly known as the Prophets) thought it was pretty darn awesome, until it ended up turning their pets into awful parasites - the Flood. It had been long spread before they realized what it would do to them, but the Humans managed to defeat the menace by giving a third of their population a genetic strain that would kill the Flood - a poison. (It is later revealed that the Flood can choose to infect and not to infect, and decided the humans were not ready for the test). They nearly defeated the Flood, at the cost of several of their worlds and billions of their people. Ravaged, they needed resources, and started to fight the Forerunners for land.

This was the start of the Human-Forerunner war. The Forerunners won, but the Flood eventually came back, with no humans to hold them off. The humans were deevoled, split into several species, removed from their technology, and exiled on Earth as punishment, and would not share the secrets of how they ""defeated"" the Flood. (It is revealed that the humans would be tested again once they rose from the exile). The Forerunners resorted to desperate measures.

The Didact (who lead the war against the humans) and the Master Builder (the lord-king-god of the Forerunners) created 05-032 Medicant Bias, an ancilla (Forerunner AI) meant to control all Forerunner anti-Flood defences in dire situations. This AI was later tasked with interrogating the last of the Precursors. (They talked for 43 years, and Medicant Bias, was convinced to betray it's masters.) While the interrogation happened, the Didact was vehemently opposing the Master Builder's plan - a Halo Array, which killed all life in a huge, huge range (life is food for the Flood) so that the Flood may not continue spreading. He opposed this plan since it violated the Mantle, and instead proposed that they create a series of Shield Worlds - to research and find a solution to the Flood. The Didact was then exiled.

The Forerunners decide to protect themselves by hiding within a shield world when the Halos are fired, but, Medicant Bias betrayed the location of the shield worlds to the Flood, and they never made it in. The Flood was preserved within these shield worlds, as well as on the Halos, kept in quarantine to be studied by the Monitors of the Halos. 

The Halo project continued, and was nearing the final stages. The Didact was awoken from his cryptum over 1000 years by a young Forerunner named Bornstellar. During this time, the Didact's wife, the Librarian, was catalouging every single species DNA in the Library Project so that they may live on after the Halo fires. The Didact eventually transfers his memories to Bornstellar, and lived on through him after being killed by the Master Builder. The Librarian landed on Earth, buried a portal to one of the Arks (shield worlds that create Halos). The Didact left to Reqiuem - another shield world - before the firing of the Halo rings, and was presumably put into a Cryptum once more. Then the Halo rings fired, killing all life. The Halo rings were left there, their Monitors wondering why the Forerunners or Humans (Reclaimers) didn't show up again. (Reclaimers are humans that have geas (genetic instructions), which lets them operate forerunner tech via intuition.)

Dreadnoughts (Forerunner ships) were sent to reseed life across the galaxy.


Part Two - The Covenant (Circa ~1000 BC, up until ~2500 AD)

All species - save for the Forerunners - have been reseeded, and have been growing for many, many years. The San'Shyuum have discovered on their planet Forerunner relics. They have long considered the technology sacred and not to be touched or altered. But the Reformists felt otherwise. They took the Forerunner dreadnought off the world, and, having the massive technological advantages of the Forerunners to their disposal to research and alter, they won the civil war, but with only a thousand or so of their species left. About a thousand years later, in 981 BC, they discovered Sangheilos, the Sangheili (elite) homeworld.

The Sangheili also felt the Forerunner artifacts to be sacred. But, the San'Shyuum were still far more technologically advanced, due to the knowledge from the Forerunner dreadnought, and defeated the Sangheili. The survivors came into an agreement, a peace treaty with the San'Shyuum, called The Covenant. They still revere and worship the Forerunners, even though their alter and adapt their technology. They induct into their Covenant the Huragok (Engineers) - bio-mechanical floating ""robots"" who's sole purpose is to fix-up technology. They go around, discovering Forerunner worlds, and taking their technology for their own. They also discover new species, which they fight with, and eventually have a huge force within their covenant. There is still tension between them - the Sangheili and the San'Shyuum treat the rest of the species with little respect, and there is still conflict between the San'Shyuum and the Sangheili.

The Covenant has one goal - to go on the Great Journey - their misinterpretation of the firing of the Halo Array. They actively seek out the Halo rings.

Parts 3 and Parts 4 in comments - removed because of character limit.







**TL;DR (sup dawg):**

The Precursors made all life, and the Mantle. They deemed the Forerunners unworthy of this mantle, and were going to kill them, but the Forerunners found out and killed them first. Then the Flood, which was created by the Precursors as a final test for the humans and the Forerunners, was unleashed. The humans fought them off, but at a great price, so the humans started war with the Forerunners so they could get more land and resources. The Forerunners fought back, brought the humans to the stone age, and then the flood came back for the Forerunners. So the Forerunners started making the Halos, since the humans would not tell them how they defeated the Flood, (but it is later revealed that the Humans did not actually defeat the Flood, and it simply chose not to infect). The Didact wanted to use Shield Worlds to protect them, but a Forerunner AI named Medicant Bias went rampant and told the Flood where the shield worlds were. The Didact's wife, the Librarian, started catalouging all life to be reseeded after the firing of the rings.

A Covenant was formed between aliens, who used Forerunner technology to their advantage. They misinterpreted the Forerunners, and thought firing the Halos would bring them to become Gods on a ""Great Journey"". They were lead by the San'Shyuum - ""The Prophets"".

The Humans, meanwhile, discovered translight travel, and created many colonies, under one unified government. Some people, the Insurrectionists, didn't like this, and rebelled violently. The Spartan program began in response, and they just so happened to be ready to fight back when the Covenant made first contact.

They discovered the Halos, fought the Covenant back just in time, and the Covenant disbanded upon discovering the great journey is a lie. Master Chief is lost in space, alone, cyro-frozen in the Forward Unto Dawn. The humans start to attempt a civil war with the elites. One a forerunner world, a bunch of Forerunner tech is discovered and put onboard the largest UNSC ship, the Infinity. The Infinity trains the new Spartans, the Covenant is dead, everything is awesome.

And then Master Chief stumbles upon Reqiuem.





CHANGELIST:

* Updated some info on the nature of the Flood. From these two comments:

ThatAwesomePenguin:
Just a little thing, but the human's 'cure' didn't do anything. The flood decided that the humans were not yet ready for the test, as it were, and was 'defeated'.

Vectorsxx:
The Flood were created in revenge of the Forerunners destroying the Precursors.
Humanity was in the fray of the Flood and almost wiped it out. But at the same pace, went to colonize Forerunner worlds to compensate for the Worlds they lost. Humanity was then waging a two-sided war. Humanity almost beat the Forerunners, but were then depraved of their technology and sent back to the stone-age. Exiled on Earth.
The Forerunners would continue to fight the flood and eventually lose, causing the building and activation of the Halos.

* Fixed the incorrect reference to the maginot line being shield worlds, updated info on the discovery of Installation 04 (Halo), from these two comments:

TURBO117:
Can I actually touch up a little on just one part. You said in one part that the Covenant discovered directions to one of the rings on Reach. Now, I don't necessarily know if that is true or not, but what I do know is that how they ended up at the location of the first ring was because the Pillar of Autumn made a random jump in to space and accidentally ended up there. Other than that, dear lord thank you:] I'm going to have my girlfriend read this before Halo 4 comes out because she doesn't have time to read all the books &amp; play all the games and I refuse to let her enjoy Halo 4 when she truly would have no idea what she was enjoying.

tgarnett:
Well you're both right sort of. But Turbo was correcting you on the Covenant finding directions to Halo on Reach. Cortana used the information on the relic on Sigma Octanus IV, and the Babd Catha Forerunner complex in Halo Reach may also have had info on Halo (though I don't think that was ever confirmed). Thel 'Vadamee (the soon-to-be Arbiter) had all of the ships under his command follow the Autumn when it fled, leading them to Halo.
Another unrelated part that bugged me, I'm fairly certain that the Maginot line was completely unrelated to the shield worlds. It was a defensive line surrounding the Forerunner inner colonies. It's not really clear if it was a physical barrier or just an imaginary line though.

* Fixed a bit of chronology. From this comment:

exposito:
The Didact went into exile before Medicant Bias was turned.

* Fixed info regarding Kilo-Five. From this comment:

Let me preface this with letting you know I am not new to Halo. I've been playing religiously since Halo CE. I've been on Xbox live since Halo 2 dropped. I consider myself much better than average and have been on every Halo game.

So I popped in Halo 3 last night to join in this throwback weekend. The first thing that struck me was the graphics. I could not believe how much things have improved. The graphics, quite hontestly, sucked compared to 4. But this really means nothing, because it's all about game play. 

This is where you'll all hate me. The game was too slow. The movement was awkward and clunky. And I SUCKED. Bad. My BR battles were horrible. I admit this probably contributes to my opinion, but it was very frustrating.

I think all the extras in Halo 4 (jetpack, promethean vision, thruster pack) add so many dynamics to the gameplay. It makes you account for so much more, which I think requires more skill for countering. 

With all the talk here on how great Halo 3 was compared to 4, I just wanted to post this to see if there are others out there like me who think 4 is actually an improvement. I think people's nostalgia was clouding their judgement. Fact is, people hate change. And the internet is the place to bitch about. Being honest with yourself, what is your opinion now that you've played Halo 3 again?

1357734401.0,312,self.halo,168ui9,So I finally figured out my problem with Halo 4's story. Why is nobody more surprised?,425,113,459,http://www.reddit.com/r/halo/comments/168ui9/so_i_finally_figured_out_my_problem_with_halo_4s/,"Halo 4's story has been bugging me, don't get me wrong I like it, it's good, strong characters etc. But I have to ask if I'm the only person who wonders why everyone is so unsurprised by what's going on.

First of all you have the discovery of the first living Forerunner, and no one seems bothered that they have discovered a member of a previously extinct race. I can understand Chief but Cortana surely would say something. 

Second, ancient humans man. No one seems to care that humanity used to have space travel - surely this turns everything about recorded history on its head? Not a single note of shock.

I realise that a lot of this is covered in books and other material so a lot of us came to Halo 4 with some idea of what's going on. But for fans coming from Halo 3 to 4 it's quite a jump. Even if all of the people on Infinity knew about this stuff, Cortana and Chief have been stranded for years so this stuff would be new to them.

Which leads me to another problem I have: no one explains the Mantle once in game, the Didact bangs on about it but never says what it is. I realise it's in the books but I don't think it should be mandatory to read a book in order to understand what's going on. 

So am I alone in thinking that a little more explanation and just reaction would have made the whole experience even better? Personally I think 343 just got so wrapped up in their Halo lore that they expected people to be on the same page as them, whether that's fans or the characters in game.",,False,self,t5_2qixk,False,,,True,t3_168ui9,http://www.reddit.com/r/halo/comments/168ui9/so_i_finally_figured_out_my_problem_with_halo_4s/,

After both experiencing the driving and gunning portion a great deal, I must say that I am completely underwhelmed by the current state of the Warthog's machine gun in Halo 4.

Taking both Canon and Gameplay situations let's take a look:  The Warthog's machine gun fires a 12.7x99mm bullet and is built to penetrate armor while the DMR fires a 7.62x51mm round that isn't.  You're trying to tell me, given that information, a DMR can kill you in 5 shots but a machine gun can't kill you firing 8 rounds a second? I get that it's a video game but there have been plenty of times where I know I should have gotten a kill with the turret but somehow the dude survived even though I was shooting him for what seemed like forever.  Pair that with the incredibly vulnerable and fragile state of the Warthog and it's almost not even worth getting in.

We are going to do this to promote breast cancer awareness.  

**UPDATE:**

We are going to do this to promote prostate cancer awareness, too!

If you know of any other diseases that need awareness, just let me know.

**UPDATE:**

Wow, the response has been overwhelming.  So many people are interested in playing.  I'm seriously going to have to pick names out of a hat.  You guys are awesome.

I miss being able to scan the map to get an idea of which teammates were in battle, and where, by the yellow color of their service tag. When a buddy died it was really nice to be able to roughly pinpoint the enemies last known location by that big red X lingering around. Without those functions, it seems like the teammate indicators (or whatever they are called) have lost the majority of their purpose and utility. Now to get an idea of where a far away battle is you have to focus on service tags and when/where they are disappearing, in addition to everything else.

While sprinting without Mobility, you will run out, and attempting to sprint after that will result in a short burst of speed.

Instead, when you run out of sprint, jump into the air and toggle sprint. This will allow you to sprint another full distance, and can be used over and over again. Until this is patched, use a different armor upgrade instead of mobility.

EDIT: It has been pointed out this may simply be caused by the delay of jumping, and not by a glitch. By all means, test it for yourselves and see what you think. For me at least, its a useful strategy of timing sprints, even if it is not a glitch.",,False,self,t5_2qixk,1355368910.0,,,True,t3_14r7k7,http://www.reddit.com/r/halo/comments/14r7k7/if_you_use_mobility_stop/,

You shouldn't need a specialization code for this to work ( but not entirely sure as I have the LE)
If you have the specialization code and it still isn't working re download it then restart halo 4 or your xbox and it should work

Confirmed working in United States eastern, central, mountain, and pacific time zones. Still don't know if working for Alaska Hawaii or other countries

CONFIRMED: working in Canada (thanks pierford)
