These are some of the many, many, examples of downvoted posts I've encountered recently. It doesn't matter even if it's wrong. This isn't /r/politics. The **PURPOSE** of this subreddit is to have a debate. If people can't even speak their mind without fear of being downvoted into oblivion, how can anyone except a Communist try and have a debate? 

This subreddit isn't for the Communists. It's for the Anarcho-Capitalists, the Free Market Capitalists, the Austrian and neoliberal economists, and those that still believe that Capitalism is the best possible system. This subreddit was **created** for the purpose of discussion. If you downvote any Capitalist who tries to post, no matter even if they are wrong, you'd be hurting the movement, drive them away, and appear like a circlejerk.

I've been getting a lot of complaints from people, and as much as I'd like to say that they were easily offended, the truth is that they brought up a very legitimate point, and that in a debating subreddit, much of what is going on in here is totally unacceptable. Many of the Capitalists here are invited on my behalf, and you guys are making me look bad. Remember, the Capitalists are the guests here. Not us. If you invite a guest to your home, you are expected to treat them with courtesy. I don't see why this should be any different.

We are NOT a circlejerk.

Downvotes are for spam and personal attacks **only**.

Do **not** downvote for a difference of opinion.


Thanks.

Edit: Also, please please no personal attacks. 

You understand why I have to hold you guys to a higher standard of etiquette that the Capitalists I invite here? If someone doesn't understand something, patiently explain to them. If someone doesn't understand about the Labour Theory of Value, or the Tendency for profit to fall, or the hundreds of other Marxist theories that exist out there, calling them ignorant isn't going to help them to understand. Don't drive them away. 

Many Capitalists are very, very, intelligent people. Don't treat them like idiots. The only reason they remain one is because of circumstance, or lack thereof.

Would you also agree that there has never been a capitalist nation?,72,15,169,http://www.reddit.com/r/DebateaCommunist/comments/13epye/the_faq_says_in_order_to_post_here_i_need_to/,"In my view there are two possible ways we could construct reasonable definitions for ""capitalist"" or ""communist"" nations:

 * A nation is capitalist (or communist) if almost all material wealth is wholly privately owned (or collectively owned), and if almost all relevant laws and regulations respect the right of the individual (or collective) to make peaceful decisions about how to utilize and dispose of that material wealth, and those laws are almost always upheld.

 * A nation is capitalist (or communist) if a majority of all material wealth is essentially privately owned (or essentially collectively owned), and if a majority of relevant laws and regulations respect most rights of the individual (or collective) to make decisions regarding that wealth, subject to some limitations, and those laws are usually upheld.

Under the second definition, we can point to numerous examples of capitalist countries (the U.S. between 1815 and 1860, the Icelandic Commonwealth, medieval Ireland, and so on and so forth). Similarly, we can point to numerous examples of communist countries (North Korea, Castro's Cuba, Mao's China, etc.). Under the first definition, where we require rigid adherence to the strictest property rights understanding of the terms ""capitalism"" and ""communism,"" there are no examples of either system being fully implemented outside of perhaps a few intentional communities with populations numbering only in the thousands. Certainly there has never been any large, sustained nation in modern times which fits the literal definitions of ""communist"" or ""capitalist.""

In the past I have heard some communists dismiss this argument by claiming that the American government is actually a capitalist tool, and therefore all a part of the capitalist system. I can assure you that this is absolutely pure magical thinking. Go talk to any small business owner, or any tax-paying Republican, or really just about anyone in the world, and ask them if the government is a tool of capitalism. The government is in its founding, in its definition, in its constitution, fundamentally anti-capitalist.

The point is that all we know about communism is that it is stateless, classless and moneyless. We know how to get there (every tendency has it's own theory on that at least), but we can not know exactly how it will be, because contrary to everyone else, we are materialists, and do not pretend we can know exactly how humanity will handle itself based on some abstract notion about ""what people generally do"". 

We firmly believe that humanity will be able to produce what it wants in such a society and distribute it correctly. Humans have a record of thousands of years of finding new ways to produce the things it needs and will continue to do so without markets or price signals, and it will most likely be better at it than we are now.

Hello /r/debateacommunist!

One month ago, we were forged from the fiery depths of Mt. Doom with a purpose, grand vision in mind, to provide a medium for polite, educated, and civil discourse, and to attempt to educate people who have misconceptions of Communism and Socialism. In the pursuit of Truth, discourse is usually the best course of action, allowing each idea to be judged according to its individual merits.

One month later, we have created a Community of 835 Redditors. We're not perfect, but we're sure as hell making an effort! I want to thank all of you for helping build this Community, and for allowing civil discourse to take place. This Community could not have existed without you, so give yourself a pat on the back!

 * 

Having said that, there are two trends that are recently worrying me. 

The first trend is the large number of posts being downvoted despite remaining perfectly civil and respectful. 

**Take a look at this.** http://i.imgur.com/H43OL.png

That's only a small selection of what's been recently going on in this subreddit.

This needs to stop. Do not downvote just because you disagree with what someone says. Even, and perhaps *especially*, if someone is wrong. This subreddit operates alongside a different set of guidelines from normal Reddit, and for a good reason; to promote debate! It doesn't matter even if your opponent wrong. This isn't /r/politics. The PURPOSE of this subreddit is to have a debate. If people can't even speak their mind without fear of being downvoted into oblivion, how can anyone except a Communist try and discuss anything? 

If any Capitalist who tries to post is being downvoted, even if they are wrong, you'd be hurting the movement, drive them away, and appear like a circlejerk. The Capitalists are the guests here. Not us. If you invite a guest to your home, you are expected to treat them with courtesy. I don't see why this should be any different.

We are NOT a circlejerk.

Downvotes are for spam and personal attacks **only**. 

In case it wasn't clear enough, Spam and personal attacks as in: 

*""FREE PENIS ENLARGEMENT ONLY $3.50""* 

or 

*""U R MORONS AND FACKERS AND UR MOM IS PHAT I HOPE U DIE""* 

If any posts do not contain either of these two, **do not downvote**. Ever. Do not even downvote someone if you don't like the tone of his posts, or feel that his post is too accusatory. *Personal* attacks are very different from merely attacks against an ideology or a group.  If you're ever in doubt, upvote instead. 

To bptst1, jscoppe, euthanatos, SuperNinKenDo, Smashpineapples, and anyone else who have had the downvote brigade targeted at them, I'm sorry, and I apologize on the Community's behalf.

Secondly, a large number of people are forgetting to remain tactful, and  I'd like to once again remind all of you to make an attempt to be civil and tactful, and to be aware of how seemingly friendly posts may be misinterpreted by others to be excessively aggressive and hostile. This subreddit was created with the intent of facilitating polite discussion, and we should intend to keep it that way. If anyone posts something that can be interpreted as non-polite, please help to **tactfully** inform them so! The new [](/tact) Macro should help with that. Do not downvote.

 * 



Having said that, I'd like to once again ask for input on how this Community is being run.  Are there any suggestions on things that should be changed? Any advice on how to stop people from downvoting posts they don't agree with? Are there any policies that you feel are unjust? Anything you want to share with the general Community of /r/debateacommunist? Do you just feel like trying out the new Image Macros? Since this is a Meta post, there's no criteria for topic relevance. Post anything below!

Also, my inbox is always open. Feel free to message me anytime, for any suggestions or concerns regarding this subreddit, or even to have a little chat.

Additionally, for those who haven't already read the new FAQ, do so!
Feel free to Edit the FAQ, by the way. It's meant to be Democratic!

Also, last thing. The Mods at /r/debatereligion have assisted me in getting Debate Macros up and running. Using them is purely optional, and you may choose not to use them at all. I just thought it might add a bit of professionalism and eloquence to this subreddit. If you think these Macros are a horrible idea and might bring this subreddit in a negative direction, let me know.

1355851990.0,38,self.DebateaCommunist,1525ws,"Concerning /r/Communism's officially held view on ""pornography""",56,18,123,http://www.reddit.com/r/DebateaCommunist/comments/1525ws/concerning_rcommunisms_officially_held_view_on/,"Disclaimer: I view and post regularly on many leftist-subreddits including /r/Communism, so I am posting this using a ""sock puppet"" account for anonymity. I cannot prove that I am either female or not a reactionary troll, so take this as you will.

I have been fairly busy and have not extensively browsed Reddit lately, and yesterday I finally noticed the link on the top of /r/Communism in which declares it a Feminist subreddit, and listing a couple specifics as to why. Point #3 caught my eye: ""(3) Pornography is exploitation and oppression against women, queer people and children. Don't be a creep."". Although I disagreed with it right on the spot, I looked through some of the comments and saw one in particular getting a lot of responses for questioning the 3rd point as well (http://www.reddit.com/r/communism/comments/ruexe/yourselves_as_cultural_revolutionaries/c48vmsl). 

The most upvoted response was a link to a documentary on Andrea Dworkin and her argument against pornography. I watched the entire 40 minute video, and I was shocked at how one-sided the documentary was. Dworkin's argument was the only one presented in the documentary, with no opposing opinions presented to the viewer (even for Dworkin to refute). She backs her argument up by loading on evidence of extreme and illegal misuses of women by criminals distributing pornography far from any publicly-certified Adult Entertainment Store. The women presented as ""victims"" of the pornography industry are women who were abused mentally and physically throughout their childhoods', and were coerced using physical and mental means into making such extreme and violent forms of pornography not by mainstream producers, but by criminals presented by Dworkin as parallel to (though, through rhetoric and documentary style the viewer will be lead to believe that they truly are) every single producer, director, crew, male pornstar, etc working for Adult Film Businesses such as Playboy, Hustler, etc. or even just amateur directors acting within what is legal in their respective nations. The argument used is in essence exactly the same as what is used to justify keeping Drugs illegal, being that they have the potential to harm some either through addiction, as well as through the violent activities that we say today from the Drug cartels. 

I consider myself a ""sex-positive"" (why it is necessary as an adjective to differentiate myself from anyone besides Right-wing Authoritarians, I do not know) Feminist, in that I believe that women should be free to pursue their sexuality as freely as men without being scorned by the overwhelming majority of society. I am also opposed to the foolish and bigoted view that women don't enjoy porn or even masturbate equally as much as males do. Sure, I and many other women may not watch the exact same type of porn as most males do, but it's the same premise almost all of the time (excluding a few fetishists), being consensual, non-violent sex between two adults who are ENJOYING it. Sure it may be acting, but the fantasy is completely enjoyable sex for both partners. Many actresses who have had stable childhoods and are mentally sound have actually consistently said that they enjoy their job probably more than most others enjoy theirs. The Youtube Channel KassemG has done (what I see as) probably one of the least biased series of interviews of well-known pornstars (being completely amateur and unsupervised by the porn-industry, albeit there are a lot of sex jokes on the part of the interviewer), including extremely popular to near complete amateurs, with no bias based on gender (popular trans* star Kimber James was interviewed, even though there was one ""very cute boy"" joke, Kasem still made out of her despite him knowing that Kimber was trans*: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lFqV-ptvLmI&amp;list=SP2DF3673D1DF139A3&amp;index=6). The entire series: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL2DF3673D1DF139A3

To conclude, I do not understand how one can assert that Pornography can viewed as completely harmful against oppressed groups, as well as pro-rape unless you yourself refuse to see both sides of the argument, and are fearful of sexuality in general. Porn is still patriarchal in its current state, but only right-wing nut jobs want to outlaw it. Dworkin's views are asserted by using the strawman of the abusive nature of illegally produced and distributed pornography as representative of everything you see in sold in a certified Adult Video Store, and thus it is all evil and viewing always results in violence against women, as well as women not enjoying porn in general in a near equal amount to men. Viewing men as serial rapists at heart only feeds the fire of the MRA argument against Feminism, as well as alienating the other half of Humanity from the movement. Oh, and we may as well outlaw dildos and masturbation as well if we're outlawing porn!

TL;DR: Saw /r/Communism hates porn, uses Andrea Dworkin's propaganda full of strawman to assert this. Women coerced mentally and physically into performing in pornography are in the minority, and are liable to sue producers for massive amounts of damages (Lindsay Lovelace). Outlawing porn is like the continuing prohibition on drugs, it only strengthens the psychopathic criminal enterprise and its ability to harm the populace through armed conflict between crime-syndicates or targeting specific individuals and groups perceived as a threat (see: Mexico of today), removes any rights (there should be much more) for actresses, and have the opposite intended effect on rates of male-violence against women. 

You can read a scientific study on the correlation between rape/sexual assault with viewership rates of pornography [here](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/2032762)

Or, if you can tolerate Penn Jillette's self-alignment with the American ""Liberatarian"" party, or you can tolerate watching an episode of ""Bullshit!"" with a somewhat body and male-centric stance though presenting a fairly solid thesis on the harmfulness of Pornography backed by statistics and expert opinions, as well as presenting the other side of the argument, though the argument itself and evidence commonly presented is refuted directly after presentation.
!!Disclaimer#2!!: I am explicitly saying that Penn comes off as an insensitive asshole to many leftists with his mode of humor, so I am going to tag the Bullshit episode with a TRIGGER WARNING for those sensitive to innuendo and slight male-centrism. I am posting it because, although I have had no direct experience with physical sexual assault or body-shaming, I found it funny and informative, even if Penn is a Right-Libertarian with little regard for the oppressed in his expression of his opinions.

I ended up spending over 2 hours checking typing and checking over this argument so that it may be presented with logical refutation of all Pornography as advocating violence and directly oppressing women with a somewhat sincere view, though I am too fatigued to post more citations, so [this](http://lmgtfy.com/?q=Rape+Pornography+Correlation) should point skeptics in the direction of more informed arguments. Once again, I believe that it is necessary for Pornography to be reformed/regulated somewhat to prevent the inherit Patriarchal undertones, tighten protection for female actresses, as well as make sexual self-satisfaction equal for all genders. If you read my whole post or just my extremely long TL;DR post, thanks for giving me a chance before spouting refutations. I hope those fellow Comrade's and Feminists can recognize the importance of Pornography in our society and the possibility of dismantling it as a purely Patriarchal institution and its potential as a potentially liberating force for women (just think, no more s-(slur) being used constantly in porn!) should it be moved in a better direction. Oh, and just remember that while not necessarily ALL women watch and enjoy pornography, there are still a lot of us that do ;)

Lenin's actions did not bring about democracy but *ended* it. The Russian Constituent Assembly established by the February Revolution was imperfect, but still a democratic institution. The Bolsheviks took over in the ""October Revolution"", but this was not a mass uprising of revolutionaries. The Bolshevik party tightly organized the takeover of the government by a relatively small group of Bolsheviks and supporting military personnel in Petrograd. It was more of a coup than a revolution. 

The Bolsheviks had seized power before elections could be held for it, but went ahead with elections anyway. Before the election even began, Lenin made it clear that he had no intention of being bound by votes. In the election, Bolsheviks only received half the votes the Socialist Revolutionaries did. The Russian people had made it clear they did not support Bolshevik rule. The Constituent Assembly met once, where it agreed to end the war with Germany and carry out land reform. Bolshevik soldiers and the Red Guard shut down the assembly, and the Bolsheviks took control of the country. Lenin claimed that the Constituent Assembly was undemocratic, and the workers' soviets throughout the country were a better, more democratic way to run the country. That may have been true, but soviet rule is **not** what Lenin established after taking over.

Lenin spoke a great deal about democracy and worker control, but he consistantly worked against such things. The All-Russian Soviet of Factory Committees had been established earlier in the revolution, giving the workers democratic control over their factories. The assembly proposed a Provisional All-Russian People's Economic Council, which would grant the workers democratic control over the economy. Lenin rejected it. They went on to propose an All-Russian Council for the Regulation of Industry, which meant to keep the factory committees from being integrated into the state. The proposal also cut out union bureaucracy and capitalist employers from factory management. A Bolshevik spokesman said **""It is necessary to make an absolutely clear and categorical reservation that the workers in each enterprise should not get the impression that the enterprise belongs to them.""** Lenin's decree on worker control said that workers' decisions could be annulled by trade unions and congresses. Additionally, the committees were subordinated  to the Russian Council of Workers Control, where the workers' committees had 5/21 seats. according to the Bolshevik government's General Instructions on Workers' Control, **""the right to issue orders relating to the management, running and functioning of enterprises remains in the hands of the owners.""** Kommunist, a left-wing journal, criticized Bolshevik policy, so the Bolsheviks demanded it was shut down.

While the Bolsheviks were consolidating power in the cities, anarchist peasants and cossacks in Ukraine were rising up all on their own. The Bolsheviks, unable to gain any control in anarchist Ukraine, attempted to use it as a bargaining chip with Germany. The anarchists formed the Revolutionary Insurrectionary Army of Ukraine, or Black Army, to resist foreign control, fight Ukrainian nationalists, and resist the White Army. They were willing to ally with the Red Army, but did not accept its authority. When the Germans withdrew after allied victories, the Bolsheviks betrayed the Blacks and moved south. Trotsky had to replace the local Red soldiers with Chinese and Latvian troops because so many were defecting to the Blacks. Trotsky murdered villagers and allowed Tzarist cossacks to devastate the countryside to finally defeat the Blacks. When the anarchists made a deal with the Red Army, they were tricked into a meeting where they were greeted by a firing squad.

In 1921, there was a mass meeting of Petrograd workers over closed factories, abysmal rations, and the lack of clothes. The Bolshevik-controlled government banned such meetings. Strikes were opposed by Bolshevik soldiers, and demonstrations were blocked by Red Army cavalry, but the unrest still spread. The strikers called for freedom of speech, freedom of press, freedom of assembly, and end to the Cheka. The Bolsheviks suppressed the workers' uprising with martial law and mass arrests.

In the naval base of Kronstadt, the sailors were kind of pissed. They had been hardcore revolutionaries, participating in the Bolshevik takover in 1917 and acting as communist shocktroops during the civil war. The sailors drafted fifteen demands:

&gt; 1. Immediate new elections to the Soviets. The present Soviets no longer express the wishes of the workers and peasants. The new elections should be by secret ballot, and should be preceded by free electoral propaganda.

&gt; 2. Freedom of speech and of the press for workers and peasants, for the Anarchists, and for the Left Socialist parties.

&gt; 3. The right of assembly, and freedom for trade union and peasant organisations.

&gt; 4. The organisation, at the latest on 10th March 1921, of a Conference of non-Party workers, solders and sailors of Petrograd, Kronstadt and the Petrograd District.

&gt; 5. The liberation of all political prisoners of the Socialist parties, and of all imprisoned workers and peasants, soldiers and sailors belonging to working class and peasant organisations.

&gt; 6. The election of a commission to look into the dossiers of all those detained in prisons and concentration camps.

&gt; 7. The abolition of all political sections in the armed forces. No political party should have privileges for the propagation of its ideas, or receive State subsidies to this end. In the place of the political sections various cultural groups should be set up, deriving resources from the State.

The sailors set up a revolutionary committee, arrested the two Bolshevik officials who threatened them, and seized control of their ships and the fortress at Kronstadt. The Bolsheviks responded by ordering a press blackout and isolating the island. Bolsheviks claimed this was a conspiracy by Tsarists and French intelligence. Lenin sent Trotsky to organize loyal Bolshevik troops to crush the rebellion. Bolsheviks bombarded Kronstadt and assaulted the island three times over the ice. The Bolsheviks' human waves were gunned down by the revolutionaries, but Trotsky just sent more to weaken the besieged sailors through attrition. After ten days the Bolsheviks took Kronstadt in bloody close quarters fighting, and executed the prisoners.

**tl;dr: Lenin crushed democracy, took power from the revolutionary workers, suppressed all dissent, and slaughtered left-wing revolutionaries.**

Maybe a list of our stories will be useful to others.",38,6,170,http://www.reddit.com/r/DebateaCommunist/comments/zkd54/ex_ancaps_how_did_you_become_ancap_and_how_did/,"I started to become interested in (what I thought at the time was) anarchy, after getting bored with talking about atheism and then going on through (American style Neo-) Libertarianism.

Coming from a pretty privileged background (relative to the rest of the world - not that privileged in the US, middle class more or less), it never really occurred to me that working for money could be exploitative. I thought that people worked at lower paying jobs when they were younger, and worked their way up to higher paying jobs and management/ownership positions when they were older. Developing economies were simply a few steps behind, but they should catch up in due time if their market were allowed to run freely.

I simply assumed that the problems we had now were due to the government, because the government is the *visible* hand (not sure why it's called the opposite) that is pick-pocketing and re-distributing wealth unfairly. And that if only the *government* would be done away with, all that would be left is a free market.

I read and discussed some ""justifications"" of property rights, but really I had already been working under the *preconceived notion* that property rights were ""just."" It never occurred to me that things could be otherwise, and when somebody would say so, I guess for the most part I just ignored it or rationalized it to make it fit in line with my preconceived notions of property. ""Property rights"" simply weren't an issue worthy of discussion - the only issue worth talking about was *how to make the government go away.*

I think the first time I started feeling that something was ""off"" with my thinking was a few years after graduating, working various semi-skilled jobs but with no real ""career track"" options. That constant threat of being fired, and living paycheck to paycheck for some time with no substantial savings, started to wear down the walls I had built around the ""Righteousness of Capitalism and Voluntary Association"" (TM). After all, I had signed the work contracts *voluntarily* - but what I began to realize was that I didn't actually sign them voluntarily. I was working under duress.

And then it just hit me like a load of bricks one day about a year or so ago - anyone working a job they don't like is working under duress. How can it be *voluntary* if you don't like it? Voluntary doesn't mean ""the lesser of two evils"" if two evils are the *only choices given* - it means freedom to choose, not only from any available option, but also to *create* options that are as yet *unavailable*.

If I locked you in a room and told you to pick your own instrument of death - starvation, fire, or suffocation - one would hardly consider that a *voluntary* choice. A volitional decision - using *free will* - would probably be something like ""let me out.""

So there I was working a job I didn't like, with the options being: 1) Keep working, 2) Starve and be homeless. Well, this was simply not a *voluntary* decision.

It was around then that I started to read about what the ""real"" anarchists had been saying - starting with Proudhon on the recommendation of a friend, and then through Marx, Bakunin, Kropotkin, and so on.

I wasn't totally convinced immediately, but I remember one interesting period of a couple of weeks where I was reading about Georgism, and I kept remembering stories from when I was just a kid in school learning about how the American Indians had no concept of land ownership. Well, while I was chatting with some random stranger about Georgism and land ownership, I distinctly remember the argument being made that ""if someone had somehow come to own the Grand Canyon, would you accept him blowing it up simply because his name was on the deed?""

That struck a chord with me, because I've always been a fan of natural beauty - and all of that ""private ownership is the best protection"" stuff I had heard was turned on its head. If they had the *right* to protect it, then they also had the *right* to destroy it, and in just that moment I stopped believing any and all justifications for the absolutist idea of property rights.

Well, I'm not a Georgist as you can tell by my star, but I can say for sure that it was the first time in my life I had ever looked at a system that *(gasp)* calls for a tax (!) and I couldn't immediately disagree with it.

After that, I delved deeper into the books and the conversations around socialism and communism, and while of course I do now accept the basic tenets - and lean strongly AnCom - I realize that there is still a much broader on-going conversation that *as yet has no magic bullet solutions*, like ""Anarcho-""Capitalism does (i.e., ""get rid of the government and everything will be OK""). I continue to find interesting readings and ideas, including some good stuff right here in this subreddit.

Anyway, I just wanted to share my story because there are so many AnCaps who I just see making the exact same assumptions that I used to make, and I thought that explaining my own history may help some AnCaps to come to terms with their *own* preconceived notions that may still be hidden in plain sight.

Even if that were true, at some intermediate point you will have to have some communist societies and some capitalist ones.

Let's say I'm a highly educated, skilled worker, maybe an aerospace engineer, living in a communist society. Because my skills are highly valued in the nearby capitalist society, I would be able to acquire a large amount of wealth by moving there. This would mean that I would be able to live more comfortably there than here, or I would be able to work less while maintaining the same lifestyle. Why wouldn't I move? 

Here are some options:

1) **You are not allowed to leave.** Would you support this kind of coercion? Do you believe it is justified by the society's overall benefit from you not leaving?

2) **You don't leave, because you have everything you want here.** For some people this may be true. But leaving could allow you to retire early and spend the rest of your life doing whatever you want, whether that is engineering or travelling the world (or working and donating money/goods/ideas to your friends back home). Nobody would rather have less choice, right?

3) **You don't leave, because you want to better the lives of others.** These are the people who will work hard simply to support others. But you can better those same people's lives by gaining in the capitalist society and contributing it back to the communist one, if you really want. 

What am I missing? What are the flaws in my argument? Why would you stay?

And even if human nature become such that most people are happy to work solely for the good of society, there will always be the few who will not. Wouldn't this mean that you would always have skilled workers trickling out?

Many ancaps will oppose communal arrangements on practical grounds, but have no issue with voluntary experimentation. Others (like myself) believe that such arrangements would proliferate in an anarchic society, adjacent to and woven through capitalistic organizations.

Reading left-anarchists comments beyond the theories and argumentation I get a solid and general sense of contempt about this asymmetry: ""Oh so you'll let us have our little pockets of communism will you? How nice."" As if, the ancap arrangements are someone preventing the leftists from demonstrating how practical and fulfilling their own arrangements are.

In my opinion this whole dynamic comes from an essential, emotionally charged difference in the view of human nature. The ancaps view people as self-directed and self-responsible. If they fall into poorly executed or unfair social arrangements, that's their own fault. Nevertheless, people mostly know what's good for them and will gravitate towards more fulfilling and productive lifestyles (bereft of systemic state interventions). With technological and intellectual progress, people (as a whole) will learn from past mistakes and increasingly settle into the best arrangements based on their personal circumstances.

The ancoms view people as lacking self-direction and self-responsibility. People are easily fooled into unfulfilling and unfair arrangements (wage slavery, rent, capitalism, etc.). If people have the option of communism or capitalism, they might choose capitalism because they cannot see the consequences. We cannot let people have this choice.

The ancoms of that sentiment forget that the ones ""freeing"" people from capitalism will not be ideologues. They will be thugs. They will not make fine distinctions between possession and private property. They will not have read r/anarchy101 or Das Kapital. If people choose capitalism and proprietarianism you should let them learn from their mistakes.

The understanding I've gained from observing the asymmetry between these types of ancaps and these types of ancoms has further lead me to believe that violent revolution, class consciousness, social engineering, etc. will never succeed. In the end, people will continue to break the fine technicalities of your tidy system for their own personal reasons and circumstances. Anarchism will only come about through a long process of accidental technological and intellectual development. You cannot force society to be anti-statist, anti-capitalist, or anti-communist. No amount of sincere philosophical, net-positive blather is going to make that happen. Essentially, this is why libertarian proprietarianism has the advantage: it does not need collective ethical consensus to operate, rather it is maintained through a network of exchanges and contracts between individuals. Only those individuals are bound by those interactions, yet the entire network reacts to each individual disruption and fluctuation without collective mandate.

It's not the best explanation of the theory, but I think it is still pretty helpful for understanding this part of Marx's analysis. In it, the speaker explain how, starting with the labor theory of value, Marx explained the development of capitalism in response to regular crises. In the last third of the video, he named a few ways in which the system has delayed a falling rate of profit, such as speeding up production, lengthening the workday, pushing wages down, and merging with other companies. The most recent adaptation has been using credit instead of actual value, in addition to sending production overseas to super-low wages. Lenin explained concentration of capital in order to preserve profits in greater detail in *Imperialism, the Highest Stage of Capitalism*. Numerous other Marxists have also picked up where Lenin left off, carrying the argument into the 21st century.

The continued survival of capitalism could not have been possible without help from the state, and I would also argue that colonialism gave capitalism its first big boost with primitive accumulation. This was, of course, state-backed. 

I have not seen any defense of privatized commodity production which took into account the tendency of the rate of profit to fall. This is a pretty big omission, because Marx's theory has the force of explanatory power behind it, and if you accept his method, then his conclusions must also be correct. He goes straight into the bare-bones definition of capitalism and condemns it from within. If Marxism consisted of nothing more than a moral complaint, I wouldn't subscribe to it.
