(Lurkers, you too.)",49,1,43,http://www.reddit.com/r/futurefunkairlines/comments/1ajd69/we_need_to_have_a_talk_about_the_future_of_the/,"Hi folks this is your moderator viborg. We've been cruising comfortably at 70,000 feet for about two years now, and we'd like to thank all of you for coming aboard!

Unfortunately it looks like there might be some turbulence ahead. Some of the folks on Future Funk Airlines seem to feel like the quality here is not quite what it used to be. Personally I think it's wonderful so much good music is being shared here, but I do notice a growing tendency to vote based on the headline and not bother exploring the new music posted here. 

We started this subreddit with the explicit intention of emphasizing quality musical content, and hopefully generating a thoughtful discussion as well. That is still our goal, and if there's a consensus that our goals have been compromised, we'd love to address the issue somehow. 

One more thing: we will need some new moderators in the near future, the existing team is stretched pretty thin right now. If you're interested please contact us.

_____

tl;dr: Please answer the following questions -- 

- What brings you to FFA? What do you like about this place?
- What are the weakness of this subreddit? What would scare you away for good? I'd really like to hear from some of the older members who seem to have disappeared, about their possible frustrations with the state of FFA. Newbies too!
- What could we do more of to emphasize the strengths of this subreddit, or to prevent the problems we have here?
- Do you want to be a moderator? Please contact us.

Oh yeah, one more thing...[we must have music.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A3biYFCdTcU) Sorry about the repost, foleyfresh! 

____

EDIT  
Great response so far thanks! The consensus seems to be that going restricted/private would be a mistake at this point but something to keep in mind for the future. Also people love the music here for the most part but would like more discussion! 

One of the main suggestions for improvement is limiting submissions to text posts in order to encourage discussion, personally my concern is that there is a danger of instead discouraging submissions that way. (Ironic that these meta-type threads seem to generate so much response but it's tough getting people to talk about the music here.) In conclusion, if you want to keep FFA going strong, **keep posting great music** but just **comment more!** 

(One more thing I was hoping someone could help explain -- for some reason this subreddit saw a massive spike in traffic in December followed by a crash in January. [Looks like this.](http://i.imgur.com/qsbEqsL.png) Can anyone say why that is? Did anyone who joined in December have some insight about why that is?)

Respect the community or get out.,40,6,11,http://www.reddit.com/r/futurefunkairlines/comments/scybm/subreddit_announcement_do_not_make_anonymous/,"This has been an ongoing issue in this subreddit for a while, but it's getting out of hand. [This submission](http://www.reddit.com/r/futurefunkairlines/comments/s9eec/disclosure_boiling_feat_sinead_harnett_really/) received five downvotes, and not one comment to explain why it should be buried. Even my comment asking people not to make anonymous downvotes got hit. That was low. Downvotes are ok, as long as *someone* steps up and just makes a comment to explain why you're doing that.

From my point of view this kind of behavior can sink Future Funk Airlines. If there's anything that makes this subreddit distinctive, it's the respect I hope we have for one other, and for the community. Anonymous downvotes are basically like saying ""I don't give a fuck about any of you or your community."" 

It's enough to make me want to take drastic action if the trend continues. I don't really know much I can do other than somehow shutting down the subreddit and starting over. Obviously that is a last resort. I did temporarily make the subreddit private, but I doubt that will change much. 

Ok, enough of that bullshit. You want music don't you? [Here you go.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEK6xxYz3Kw) Now chill the fuck out with the disrespectin and the judgementalizin and the anonymous downvotin. Can't we all just get along?

Edit  
Thanks for all the support, I was afraid this post would barely get noticed! I will also mention that part of the motivation for this was a recent surge in users we had, starting around last Saturday. I'd be interested in finding out where that surge came from too, I suspect it might have been some comments I left on blogs?

Evidently there are still a handful of immature trolls here who scan't grasp the true meaning of ""respect."" I feel like it's hardly worth addressing them directly since they can't be arsed to speak their minds here, they just hide behind the downvote button. I would guess the children who act this way also contribute the least to this subreddit. For now we can only ignore them and hope they piss off to more fertile trolling grounds.

There was [a great discussion](http://www.reddit.com/r/futurefunkairlines/comments/1ajd69/we_need_to_have_a_talk_about_the_future_of_the/) a few days back about the future of FFA and we've definitely been listening. First of, we wanted to thank you all for making this subreddit as great as it is and for your ongoing support and valuable contributions. We can't fly this plane without you!

As most of you probably noticed by now we've recruited some new moderators to help manage the continuing growth of our beloved little corner of the internet. A growing Future Funk Airlines means more awesome music but unfortunately also more turbulence and a growing danger of degradation in quality. In order to stay on top of the game and continue to be one of the best subreddits for music we needed a few extra guardians of the good vibes. So Viborg, 77or88 and foleyfresh went out and underlined the ""future"" in /r/futurefunkairlines by recruiting some longtime members of the community to join them inside the cockpit.

The crew agreed that having a little introduction thread like this would make everything a bit more personal and asked me to make this post. I'll introduce myself in the comments below and the other guys should also chime in soon. Please feel free to ask us any questions you might have and don't forget we're always open to suggestions!

A few days ago the new mods setup an IRC chat channel so we could all get to know each other a bit.  Now that we've done all those greetings I wanted to invite everyone else.  I thought there might be at least a few IRC users here who could use another channel to idle/chat about music in.  So if you're already an IRC user, we're in #futurefunkairlines on freenode.  If you're not already an IRC user, you can use [this handy dandy link for freenode web chat](http://webchat.freenode.net/?channels=futurefunkairlines) and come chat a bit.  

Right now there are only a few users, and we're not sure if it will take off, but it seems like we have a good userbase here, so I figure this has the potential to be a quality channel for chatting about good music with good people.

Maybe I'm reaching here, but clearly drugs have played a role in music culture for a long time and even more so with disco, [house,](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9MFAKf6bwvg) and electronic music and [rave/club culture](http://www.reddit.com/r/futurefunkairlines/comments/1cswey/air_liquide_this_is_not_a_mindtrip_live_at_love/) in general. Exactly how much of a role do they play though? Can we say entire genres of music were inspired by specific drugs? 

Simon Reynolds made some pretty specific connections in Generation Ecstasy between drugs and musical styles, like how the shift to pills cut with more speed affected the development of [breakbeat hardcore and jungle.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Us7i6xIHi0) Regarding hip-hop, I recently had a conversation about how ecstasy infiltrated the culture, and it seems like part of it was straight out of the [Bay Area.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o38ywbvxLFA) In my experience the rave scene was HUGE by the Bay around the turn of the milliennium and it's not surprising some of that would influence the local hip hop culture. Maybe this was true in some other big American cities, I don't really know. It wasn't long before the influence had spread as far as [Alabama](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UygocrMJAto) though. 

So what do you think? Could drug culture be an essential part of electronic music? Is this a gross exaggerration? What's your story? ",,False,,t5_2rp0c,1370826685.0,,,True,t3_1g0fcy,http://www.reddit.com/r/futurefunkairlines/comments/1g0fcy/zweiten_sonntag_discussion_thread_what_role_does/,

I just wanted to say I have really enjoyed exploring this subreddit over the last few months, and I hope that I have helped contribute to diverse array of quality links that this subreddit is renowned for. I know there has been some talk about introducing some more discussion, so I thought this might be an interesting topic.    

Now to the discussion.     

Firstly, I use the term ‘funk’ loosely to mean anything that has a certain 'groove’ to it -  not just JBs style funk, but soul, disco, yacht rock, boogie, italo, jazz, fusion, latin, post punk, new wave etc.    
Secondly, despite the title, this isn’t supposed to be a discussion about race, but more a dialogue about time in musical history. Modern music of a ‘funky’ nature tends to be made by a multi-cultural and diverse group of artists. However, back in the 60s, 70s, and 80s social/economic/cultural conditions tended to be more segregated along race lines and this was often reflected in the styles of music that people made. This discussion is supposed be about the relatively small number of white artists who played across these boundaries. **EDIT**: Dudettes are also part of this discussion.     
Thirdly, when posting your top three. Please tell us about why you like that artist and post one track using a youtube link. If someone has already posted an artist you like, that’s ok, just post a different youtube link.   

Ok, here’s my top three:   


**Rod Temperton** – While there is very little released under his name as a solo artist, Rod was involved with some of the greatest acts of the late 70s and 80s - Micheal Jackson, Heatwave, Rufus and Chaka Khan, Bob James, Toto and George Benson just to name a few. The track I’m picking is [Heatwave – Star of the Story]( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwTTg-ZvLgo) which I think represents the smoothness he is often associated with.    

**Gino Soccio** – Throughout the 70s and 80s the Italians showed an incredible knack for making highly danceable and funky music. While some artists were lost in translation across the Atlantic, others managed to break into the US market with considerable success. Gino was one of those, releasing quality tracks right until the mid-80s. Here’s a proto house number from ‘84 he did under the moniker Starflight. The track is [Dance to the Beat]( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kl_ObrsKSUA).    

**Bob James** - One of the most sampled artists in the history of hip hop. Breaks for days and days. Bob makes proper Jazz funk fusion and has worked with many, many greats. My choice from him is [Storm King]( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zEcFllL7gY) of his third LP ‘Three’.

I don't think this has been done before, and if it doesn't conform to the board's rules I'm happy to take it down (or get violently downvoted, either way).

I represent a small Shanghai-based music collective [LQE](http://www.lqecollective.com), and we're currently looking for more [mixes](http://lqecollective.com/tagged/LQE%20Mix%20Series) to be released weekly. Here's our latest [LQE010](http://lqecollective.com/post/43465764525/lqe010-pablo-kaiser-cells-activate) mix by our Parisian friend Pablo Kaiser.

We're open to any and every genre, and would be happy to be your test-tube for that electro-funk-nu-IDM mix you always dreamed of. The only criteria we use is the keyword ""chilled"". The mix should have a decent sound quality, and last from 45mins to 1 hour.

1363456231.0,10,self.futurefunkairlines,1af2iz,FFA has a serious lack of Chris Malinchak! [5 songs + some thoughts inside that'll hopefully make you a fanboy.],12,2,6,http://www.reddit.com/r/futurefunkairlines/comments/1af2iz/ffa_has_a_serious_lack_of_chris_malinchak_5_songs/,"First of all, I hope I'm not breaking the rules by posting six songs at once! I really believe this guy is on to something here and I wanted to put him in the spotlight for a sec. He produces some of the most euphoric and melodically genius house tunes I've ever heard. The vibe he creates is just incredibly intense. So I thought I'd bundle my favourites for you guys. I should say that I'm not in any way affiliated with Malinchak, just suddenly floored by a realisation of how good and consistent his shit is.

It's hard to describe what exactly it is that gets me about his music but it has this very familiar quality to it, like he's tapping into some collective disco/house-euphoria subconscious. Most of the 80's/90's revival tunes that come out today feel exactly like that: revival tunes. These ones don't. Upon first hearing any of these songs I strongly felt I'd heard them before, many many years ago, although that's impossible cause they're pretty new. It's like he's painting with memories. This is revival done right. Kick back, put your speakers/headphones on blast volume, enjoy the ride and tell me if you feel the same:

* [Razor 2.0](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vGx0F8qc3mg)
* [At Night](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQ-lOjyJRlg)
* [Fuego](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0tnYRA2Zig8) *(It's insane how familiar this one sounds to me, is it a cover/remix?? I couldn't find any evidence it is... Incredible track either way though.)*

The submissions are open to everyone but in interests of keeping things orderly you can sign up here in advance if you want to make a submission for the following month. The thread will be linked in a sticky at the top of the subreddit for that month. 

As far as topic matter, good ideas might be an outstanding artist, album, or even song, an interesting subgenre (aka white boy funk) or an event, or more general ruminations on music, life, art, death, party culture, politics, and fun. 

It might also be a good idea to curate all the past discussions in this thread here too, so that they are all easily accessible. I'll do my best to stay on top of that.
