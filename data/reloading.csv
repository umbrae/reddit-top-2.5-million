Do you really want to need a permit to reload?  Buy powder with a background check?

Never mind these idiots used $400 worth of fireworks to get their explosives, it's the reloading community's fault for being able to buy smokeless powder (and black powder) off the shelves.

Did I mention that the bill says nothing about fireworks?

 I was at the range the other day shooting my AR and I had a few people ask me where I got my ammo from. I told them I reload and I've had my supplies stockpiled for a long time now. One father son combo got really excited about this, and they asked a few basic questions about cost, time involved. Every time I would answer a question id follow up with a bit of safety info, telling them they should grab a book on reloading if they want to learn. Every time id start talking about safety the father would get annoyed. A bit later when they were getting ready to leave the range I could hear him telling his kid they were going to stop by a few stores to grab stuff to reload some ammo and how hard can it be. Today I was at cabelas grabbing a few things and swung by to see if they had any bullets in stock which of course they didn't. While I was browsing a fellow customer asked if I knew anything about reloading, he wanted to know if a press was really necessary, he could prime bullets using a hand primer, measure powder with a trickler and a scale but he was unsure of the crimp to keep the bullet in. He asked me if he could use vice grips to put a slight crimp on so the bullet wouldn't fall out. Normally id think the person was joking but he was an older gentleman and he looked serious. I think he could tell by my mouth gaping open that the answer was no, I told him absolutely not and he should really read up on reloading before he puts his first cartridge together and I tracked down a staff member to help him out and got out of there.

",38,4,25,http://www.reddit.com/r/reloading/comments/w072x/can_reduced_loads_blow_up_your_gun_i_asked/,"This started during a [conversation with Volucris](http://www.reddit.com/r/reloading/comments/vxstx/hey_reloadit_i_want_to_try_lightloaing_308_win/c58jpav) about the possibillity of a detonation occurring from a reduced load. I decided the best way to get the best answer would be to ask the source (of powder). 

I sent Hodgdon this email:

&gt;Hello,

&gt;I have read in some books, and have seen in numerous places on the internet that there is a possibility that a reduced load can cause a dangerous pressure spike, and explode within the gun. The issue is often described as a load that sits below the primer flash hole where the charge from the primer will pass over the powder, and cause a detonation as opposed to a rapid burn. Is this a possibility? Have there been any lab experiments of this occurring? Is this just a myth?

&gt;Thank you for taking the time to read and answer my question.

And I got this response:

&gt;This is a great way to identify those people on the internet and at the gun club who don’t know anything about reloading and specifically they don’t know anything about gunpowder.
 
&gt;Think about this a minute.  If we put x number of grains of powder into a case and we get the pressure in the case to be 10,000 PSI and then we put x-2 grains of powder into the same case and use the same bullet with the same crimp, how are we going to get higher pressure with less powder in the case?  Would our result be x grains minus 2 grain =60,000 PSI or would it be x grains minus 2 grains = 8,000 PSI?
 

&gt;I’ll point out that the laws of chemical energy storage and Newton’s laws have not been repealed.  They still apply.  According to the laws of physics and the laws of chemistry, it is impossible to create energy, energy may only take a different form.  If we store 100 units of chemical energy in gunpowder and then look at another batch of gunpowder with 50 units of energy, the pressure cannot go higher, we would be creating energy.  If we were creating energy, we would be 2 things, 1) God because only God can create energy or 2) we would own and run the power company and take everyone’s money because we could make energy.
 

&gt;Obviously, this is a myth.  It cannot happen. 
 

&gt;What does happen is this:  When a load is too light, the primer will blow the bullet out to the lead where it sticks.  The main charge then burns.  With the bore plugged by the bullet, the pressure raises like putting your finger over the mouth of a Coke bottle and shaking it.  Pressures that would normally be 20,000 PSI jump up to 80,000 PSI just because the bullet is not moving as it should. 
 

&gt;This has NOTHING to do with “detonation”

I responded with this question based on the gentleman's response:

&gt;This is fantastic, thank you. 
 
&gt;A couple of questions about the possibility of the primer pushing out the bullet before the powder burns. How likely is that, and wouldn't the powder begin to burn as the bullet is pushed forward, continuing it's travel down the barrel?

And he sent this:

&gt;It is very likely that a primer will blow the bullet out of the case.  It is almost a certainty.
 

&gt;The problem comes when the loads are so light that the pressure remains very low in the case causing the powder to have trouble lighting and continuing to burn.  This allows the bullet to stop.

1323813053.0,38,self.reloading,nbiju,"What Happens After You Pull the Trigger, and What It Means For Reloading [FAQ]",38,0,21,http://www.reddit.com/r/reloading/comments/nbiju/what_happens_after_you_pull_the_trigger_and_what/,"
In many ways the process of reloading a cartridge begins before the previously loaded bullet is even separated from the not-yet-empty case.  After the trigger is pulled a series of mechanical and chemical processes take place in the cartridge and the firearm.  From a reloader's perspective these processes are both the final goal of a loaded cartridge *and* the initiator of changes that must be rectified before the empty case can yet again become a loaded cartridge.

**So what happens in the milliseconds following a trigger pull?**  

1. The trigger is pulled.  A spring-loaded mechanical lever called a *sear* is disturbed, releasing another spring loaded device... either a *hammer* or a *striker*.  In the case of a hammer, the hammer falls and impacts a firing pin.  A striker, on the other hand, combines the function of the hammer and firing pin into a single component.  In either case, the head of the striker/firing-pin is jammed forward through a hole in the bolt face and into the primer of the cartridge.

2. The primer (assuming Boxer type) consists of a thin metallic cup with a separate small metal anvil.  The firing pin slams into the cup, smashing it against the anvil.  Between the two is the priming compound, the only *actually* explosive material used in the cartridge.  The priming compound ignites from the impact, shooting a jet of super hot combustion gasses through the hole in the bottom of the primer pocket and into the body of the case.

3. The jet of gas ignites some of the powder in the body of the case.  The powder contains its own oxidizer, and once ignited will burn until it is all eventually consumed.  On the short time scales we're concerned with the powder burns relatively slowly.

4. The powder begins to burn, and the combustion gasses build up inside the cartridge case.  At this point the case begins to swell under the increasing pressure.  The walls expand until they press against the sides of the chamber.

5. As the diameter of the case is swelling, remember that the primer is held in the cartridge by little more than a press fit between the sides of the primer cup and the walls of the primer pocket (and sometimes a slight crimp).  The primer is being pushed out of the pocket by the building pressure inside the body of the case.  But, as it swells, the back (head) of the case is stretched/pushed backwards until it contacts the bolt face, trapping the primer in the pocket.   On a necked cartridge, the front of the case and the bullet are stretched forward towards the bore, and the brass actually flows (similar to a swaging process) forward, elongating the front of the case.

6. The swollen case has a gas-tight seal against the walls of the chamber, and the primer is trapped in its pocket, blocking the only remaining rearward escape route for the combustion gasses.  Pressure now builds very quickly.

7. The building pressure overcomes any crimping force on the bullet and begins to push it forward into the leade  (the distance between the case mouth and the beginning of the rifling).

8. The bullet has now been pushed out of the case mouth entirely and traversed the leade.  The rifling engages the sides of the bullet, cutting into the lead or the jacketing material.  The soft metal of the bullet squeezes into the shape of the bore, effectively creating a gas-tight plug in the barrel.  Powder continues to burn in the empty case, and some of the unburnt powder has begun following the bullet into the bore.

9. With the swollen case blocking the breech end of the barrel and the obturated bullet blocking the muzzle, the space between the case head and the ass-end of the bullet has become a giant combustion chamber.  The bullet begins to pick up speed and spin as it is pushed down the bore.  Powder following the bullet out of the case and into the bore continues to burn.

10. At this point two opposing conditions are affecting the pressure in the bore and the chamber.  Burning powder produces more combustion gasses, but the volume of the combustion area is increasing as the bullet travels down the bore.  Whether the pressure is still rising or falling depends on the specific load and barrel.  Either way the bullet is now rocketing down the bore.

11. The bullet reaches the crown of the muzzle.  As it exits, the built up gasses behind it burst through the gap, creating jets of combustion gas that will push the bullet off course if the crown has not been machined perfectly orthoganal to the bore.  This initial release of gas creates an enormous pressure wave that will register to bystanders as the firearm's report.  Some of the unburnt powder follows the bullet out into the air and finishes burning, creating a muzzle flash.  The rest burns up in the barrel.

12. Pressure inside the barrel now drops rapidly, as the gasses vent through the end of the bore at Mach 1 (choked flow for any gas dynamicists out there).  The pressure holding the now-empty case swollen against the walls of the chamber is now released, and the brass springs back towards its original shape.

13. Because the brass of the case was stretched beyond its elastic limit, it will retain a portion of its swelling and stretching even after it shrinks and releases from the chamber walls.  That swelling and stretching cycle has also pushed the brass' microstructure around, resulting in a slight work-hardening near the case mouth.

14. The case is now free in the chamber again, and ready to be extracted and ejected.

**What does this mean for the reloader?**

1. First of all, in order to do its job properly the case *must* expand in the chamber, which means that the empty case is no longer the correct size.  It's now too big in diameter, and a necked cartridge is also probably too long as well.  Diametrical resizing can be done with dies through a swaging process, but a necked cartridge's lengthening must be rectified by trimming.

2. The pressure during the firing process is critical.  It must be high enough to stretch the brass and create that gas-tight seal around the chamber walls and the contact with the bolt face, but not so high as to exceed the safe limits for the barrel.  An enormous amount of energy is required to squeeze an oversized piece of metal through a long, undersized tube.  Without enough pressure the bullet won't make it out of a long barrel, or hot combustion gasses will vent through the primer pocket and ruin the bolt face.  Too much pressure and the gun blows up.  The correct powder/primer/bullet combination is crucial.

3. Necked cartridges undergo different forces than straight-walled cartridges.  They are pushed on from both sides, and so undergo greater stretching, which results in greater work-hardening of the mouth.  This makes them slightly more difficult to work with later.

4. A case, once fired, has now taken the shape of that firearm's chamber (minus the stretching that occured prior to hitting the elastic limit).  Some rifle handloaders believe that this has the potential to make that case more accurate in that particular firearm because it will locate more repeatably the second time (provided only the neck is resized).

6. In certain instances a case can be reshaped into another case through fire-forming... using similar mechanics to the above to reshape one type of case into another.  An example is forming 7.62x39 into 6.5 Grendel.  A forming die can get the trimmed parent case close, and fire-forming to the Grendel chamber can get the case the rest of the way.",,False,,t5_2rloq,False,,,True,t3_nbiju,http://www.reddit.com/r/reloading/comments/nbiju/what_happens_after_you_pull_the_trigger_and_what/,

My original images are [here.](http://imgur.com/a/M45sO)

[This is my new setup](http://imgur.com/a/AMi3g)

Included in those images are shots of my new lighting for the Dillon 550b as well. The shot of the light up shell plate doesn't quite do it justice as my phone turned down the brightness of the shot, it's a huge contrast.

Details on the lighting:
The lighting system comes from Inline Fabrication, and is the [Skylight LED](http://inlinefabrication.com/collections/lighting/products/skylighttm-led-lighting-kit-for-the-dillon-550) system for the Dillon 550b. They make other models as well for a 650, Square Deal etc. 

It's $34 and in my opinion well worth it. It adds an element of safety in reloading, where now I can see directly into each shell I'm loading as a sort of sanity check on the powder. 

Installation took about 15 minutes, it just drops into the center hole of the tool head and mounts pretty flush. In my case, I did have the sand down the outside plastic casing of the LED tube in order to get it to fit. Not a big deal and the instructions mention to do this if the fit is too tight. That portion took 10 minutes of the total install time, and the plastic case is much thicker than necessary and can support a good sanding.

I think the only other thing I'd add to my system is a decently angled mirror to peer right down into the shell casing without having to angle my head. The more passive I can make it, the more likely I am to pay attention to it on each piece of brass.

Thanks for looking!",,False,,t5_2rloq,False,,,True,t3_1j427m,http://www.reddit.com/r/reloading/comments/1j427m/finished_my_reloading_area_upgraded_lighting_on/,

Lessons learned.",34,6,19,http://www.reddit.com/r/reloading/comments/1f75cj/first_ever_squib_lessons_learned/,"I'll back up a few weeks/months.  A while back I got a new Hornady Lock 'n' Load AP.  Love the press.  I was in a rush to start using it, so for the first 100 rounds I did I wasn't using a ""powder cop"" die.  

I also just got a new Glock 34 recently, and I just put in a new competition trigger.  This was my first time out with the gun and new trigger job.  

My wife and I visited a friend and were shooting at steel plates on his farm.  Near the end of the day I started practicing ""double taps"" with the 34.  I loaded up a mag with 17 rounds.  Everything was fine.  Gun running great.  Did 5 double taps successfully.  Grinning ear to ear that every pair of shots was clanging the plate.  

Finally, I pull the trigger and felt the trigger break but the slide only came back about a 1/4.""

I knew something was up.  And I'm very very glad I didn't do a standard ""tap rack &amp; bang""

I dropped the magazine, and when I ejected the misfired round, it wasn't a round.  It was just the case. At that point I triple checked the chamber was clear and field stripped the glock. 

Sure enough, my first ever squib.  The bullet was stuck in the barrel maybe 1/2"" down.  The bullet barely got out of the case at all.  

Needless to say I was done shooting that gun for the day.  When I got home, I was able to tap out the bullet.  

I checked the load label and sure enough, this box was the very first that I put through my new press.  I am assuming that in my eagerness to crank out rounds on the new progressive press I somehow missed getting a powder load into this round completely.  

One of the big lessons learned for me that I'd like to share is to ""know your gun.""  I've shot thousands and thousands of rounds out of Glocks and never had the slide just kind of ""pop back"" a bit.  The scary thing was that there was enough room to chamber a 2nd round. I didn't chamber a round, but had I done so, and had I pulled the trigger on that round I certainly would have had a huge ""kaboom"" on my hands.

Sorry for my rambling.  Just remember when you reload you are accepting some risks. Know how your gun performs, know what to look out for (and listen for) and make sure you mitigate those risks.

After reloading and firing about 400 rounds of 40 S&amp;W I had a bit of an accident. The way it looks in the first couple pics is exactly how it was in my hands after the kaboom. Took some force to pry it from that form so I could lay out all the parts. The brass was laying off to the right and the top of the chamber was off to the left. All my digits remain and no one was hurt, tho I got a cut on my forehead but not really sure what caused it. I'm not terribly pissed or distraught over it happening, honestly I always thought it would, but just always hoped it wouldn't. But now that it did, the hyper-rational part in me is wondering if I should give up reloading and stick to factory loads, and sell off my press/etc. The cost savings of reloading seem to just go to buying a new gun after you get a bad case or a double charge.

I went to the batch that I took the round from and separated it by case manufacture and I'm double checking their bullet weights, but nothing has stood out to me as wrong. The most variations from the mean weight has been 2 grains heavy, but now I'm starting to question those and wondering if that 2 grain difference in weight could mean these rounds will pop like the other.

I had run out of cleaned 9mm and needed to go to my 60 lbs bucket of unsorted, dirty brass and prepare some for reloading. Cleaning them means throwing them in the [tumbler](http://www.amazon.com/Frankford-Arsenal-Quick-n-Ez-Case-Tumbler/dp/B001MYGLJC/ref=sr_1_5?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1332046738&amp;sr=8-5) filled with [media](http://www.midwayusa.com/product/541305/lyman-turbo-brass-cleaning-media-treated-corn-cob-6-lb-easy-pour-container), and letting that run for a couple of hours.

The next step was sorting and inspecting the brass. I used a [Shell Sorter](http://www.midwayusa.com/product/847836/shell-sorter-brass-sorter-9mm-luger-40-smith-and-wesson-45-acp-3-bowl-set?cm_mmc=Froogle-_-Reloading+-+Metallic+Reloading+Equipment+\(Not+Presses\)-_-PriceCompListing-_-847836) to group them together, and spent hours separating 9mm and 380, and 45 with small pistol primers, and 45 with large pistol primers by hand. I also had to remove brass with [crimped primers](http://castboolits.gunloads.com/showthread.php?t=127638), and inspect the brass for [damage](http://www.hobbygunsmith.com/Cracked.JPG). 

I did this to 4 tumblers of brass (about 1500 rounds), and it took hours of being attentive and lots of dexterity in my hands. I didn't do any reloading, just the brass prep. **I enjoyed it**. It didn't feel like work. It felt rewarding to do something well. This is going to be apart of some very consistent and accurate ammunition.

Many people start reloading to save money. That's the biggest reason I did it, but my total shooting costs went up.

Well, after pulling 150 bullets, I reloaded them to the correct specs and tested them out today. 100 rounds at 14.5 grains h110 went off without any problems, aside from about three misfeeds near the very end of my shooting session. There wasn't much if any lube remaining on the cases since they'd been handled so much after sizing. But next time I will wipe them down with a cleaning solution before firing them.
The cases looked alright after firing too. Typical m1 soot pattern, no strange bulges anywhere, and the primers looked alright. Nothing obviously flattened looking. All in all, a good start after daylight savings!


Also a fun occurrence today:
For a split second I thought my carbine had bought the farm.
A BIG fireball, accompanied by a large crashing boom suddenly happened from the lane next to mine, as I had finished firing a round. Then I realized it was a group with a very big .44 magnum. My teeth feel looser in my skull this afternoon now. -





&gt;Egads.
I was loading .30 carbine this week, now that I received my dies and auto disk measure. I had just finished loading some 115 grain 9mm, and switched all the dies on my Lyman press. I had in mind making a batch of 150 rounds for some target practice this weekend. I was following the correct (or so I thought) load data for H110 and a 110 grain FMJ for the .30 carbine. Little did I know, I was accidentally eyeballing the 115 grain .30 carbine load data a few rows down the chart. I set my auto disk measure to throw 11.8 grains for what I thought was my correct bullet weight (it was supposed to be 14.0!). I noticed on the chart that the listed OAL for the 110 grain and 115 grain loads were different from each other, which made me double check again. Then I realized the extent of my error. So instead removing the bullets downrange into a paper target this weekend, I guess I'll be spending the afternoon pulling them in my press. Better safe than sorry!

&gt;Moral of the story: Always double and triple check (obvious, right?).  I now have a big cardboard sign with the correct data in front of me to go to, instead of tiny print that I could misread.

I went through a single 5 gallon container looking for .45 acp large pistol primer and got about 2.5 gallons of brass to tumble (which I did as I was sorting). 

**I guess my question is..** How much brass do most people have stored and do you have brass for calibers you don't shoot or even own a weapon for? 

Currently we reload just .45 acp for IDPA (ssp) but we have brass for all different calibers.  Some we ""hope"" to do (like S&amp;W 500) because they are expensive to shoot and others we just have..  No idea why (like .40 or 10mm).",,False,,t5_2rloq,False,,,True,t3_15czwd,http://www.reddit.com/r/reloading/comments/15czwd/with_all_this_panic_buying_its_a_good_thing_we/,

The range that I've been going to has 11 lanes and isn't too crowded during he week which is when I try to go. I grab a bucket, pick up my brass and toss it in as I shoot, which is typically 150 to 200 rounds. 

Today, there were a group of three older guys in their 60's three lanes away and one old fucker in particular was sweeping up brass across half the lanes in the range including directly behind mine. I made it a point to time myself so I would stop firing and turn around to pick up my brass as the the old guy was sweeping behind me. I didn't want to be a dick so I smiled at the old dude and said ""I reload my .45 shells which ones do you reload?"" The old fuck said ""All of 'em."" and continued to sweep up the brass. 

I resisted the urge to punch the old fucker in the larynx and switched to shooting my .22 until the old farts left the range. Now I've been shooting for over twenty years and until I got into reloading didn't care less about the brass I left on the range other than to sweep it forward of the booth. Now I view each one of my shells as a shiny nickel and felt like this guy was stealing from me. Is this normal?

He's borrowing money to get it started, and putting up his weapons as collateral with his investor.

He has incorporated, applied for an FFL, State Resale, and city business license.

He seems to think he will be able to crank out a few thousand rounds of 5.56/.223 a day, for 40 cents each, and sell them at 60-80 cents.

My concerns - 
Availability of Brass, projectiles, powder, primers....He says he'll have no problem getting everything he needs, it's all available.  (not sure where he's looking...)

Does he know what he's doing/experience....He says the machine does it all, load it up, and crank it out.  

Safety/liability - if he's selling faulty rounds that blow up on people....WTF?

Bottom line, he thinks it's gonna be a get rich quick taking advantage of the shortage of ammo/price increases as of late, and is counting on price and availability of reloading supplies being same as before.

Not trying to be a downer on the guy, but don't wanna see him get too deep in debt over this if it's not something with a reasonable chance of success.

Thoughts??

**EDIT:  Thanks for the replies, pretty much confirmed what I suspected.  Was hoping I was wrong  Oh well**


**Last Edit:  told him ""I implore you to do your research on availability/price of components before you spend more money"".  Was told ""Chumps like you, with out an FFL 06, can't get shit"".

My suggestion: if you post a picture of a cartridge, give us a recipe, and the equipment you used. If you post a press setup, give us some details, goals, and if you feel like providing them, some estimates on costs (as someone who wasn't reloading a year ago, those details are what helped me choose me equipment). If you post a picture of a target, tell us the gun, details about the cartridge, the environmental factors on the range, and other useful anecdotes.

http://imgur.com/a/VwpGI

http://www.reddit.com/r/reloading/comments/1f4obo/component_shortages_got_me_down_so_i_learned_the/

I finally got around to testing them out.
[Here's what I ended up for expansion with the .30 carbine](http://i.imgur.com/4xPYujL)

We did two shots on a slow day at the range, at a rig the RSO's had made of a row of water bottles in a wooden trough.
The slug ended up going through about 4 water bottles (The small type) before exiting out the side of the box. One RSO said that he could actually see the second slug hit the grass, and later recovered it.

Unfortunately, I did not snap any pictures of groups yet, but I will the next time I head out to the range. Because of the amount of lead exposed, and the meplat size, these don't cycle in this carbine (yet), so I had to chamber each cartridge manually. This is something that hopefully, I can work out by adding in another step to the making process, like a meplat trimming stage, or think of a way to make a very narrow hollow point type bullet completely encapsulated by jacket material. The 125 grain bullets chamber flawlessly in the test dummy rounds I made, but I can't find any load data for 125 grain jacketed bullets in .30 carbine, only cast lead.

So far, the results were better than I expected. For the next rounds, I'm going to try see how I can get more consistent mushrooming, and see how well I can group them at different distances. The feeding issue will hopefully be worked out in later revisions as well.

1369850577.0,18,self.reloading,1fa5ms,Results from a productive day of reloading. Reached 2/3rds of the Goal.,19,1,12,http://www.reddit.com/r/reloading/comments/1fa5ms/results_from_a_productive_day_of_reloading/,"We spent saturday reloading .45 acp.  The goal was to create 3000 rounds which would last us 6 months.  We got 2000 finsihed, 1000 of full power and 1000 of reduced power for IDPA. 

All the rounds were made with 230 grain Berry's Plated Round nose bullets.  The first 1000 were made with 5.1 grains of Win 231 to get a fps of 850.  The 2nd 1000 were made with 4.5 grains of Win 231 to get a fps of 650-700.

The bucket of cleaned LPP .45 brass aparently wasn't all LPP.  Each time we hit a SPP it really slowed things down until we got a handle on what was going on.   At first look even those SPP brass looked like LPP.  Turns out all of the ones that got through were Federal.  For some reason the Federal SPP brass is harder to pick out than the other brands (like speer).

Shot showing the primer pocket difference..  LPP is .202"" and the SPP is .17x""

[LPP vrs SPP in federal cases](http://i.imgur.com/4Ka5CwE.jpg)

If a SPP got through it would cause multiple issues.  Before we ""got the feel"" of a SPP in the mix we would end up with a piece of brass with powder and a bullet crimped into it.  Since there is powder in the brass it was dumping some powder onto the plate through the empty primer hole which meant over time we would have to stop, take apart the plate and clean out all the powder.

We also were having some issues with the Brass feeder.  The LNL uses a pluger that goes up through a bushing and pushes a door type thing to let a piece of brass drop.  The bushing kept lifting up which would make the brass feeder not drop a piece of brass.  It wasn't consistant.  We finally fixed it by using some super glue on the outside of the bushing and its staying put now. 

The last issue we ran into was a bad primer.  Basically the primer came apart as it was put into the case.  My guess was it hit a SPP piece of brass.  It didn't pop but it came apart which got primer crap all over the place and we had to take the shell plate up again and clean up the mess. 

For those that have asked before, here is a shot of our loader.  It is now sporting an inline fabrication Hornady Lock-N-Load AP ""Ergo"" Roller lever which does really help.  

[Hornady LNL](http://i.imgur.com/73UzLzd.jpg)

Here are some finished shots.
First up is 1000 loaded rounds.  This is actually the 2nd 1000 as the first batch got boxed up in small boxes and then will be mailed across the country.   We were hoping to get 2000 finished in the 2nd batch to keep here but we only made 1000 in the 2nd batch.  We will make another 1000 in a month or so to keep.   

[2nd batch](http://i.imgur.com/d1RDm4x.jpg)

We load the 230 grain LRN and Plated RN bullets to an OAL of 1.260 which we have tried in in Ruger p90's, M&amp;P .45 full size, Glocks and a bunch of 1911's that get used with these rounds.  

[OAL pic](http://i.imgur.com/d6MgvW2.jpg)

Overall it was a productive day.  When things were ""flowing"" we were on track for 600-700 rounds per hour.  When things were just not working it was closer to 250 rounds per hour.   That doesn't take into account the pre-setup and clean up time.

I used reddot, w231, and titegroup loads, all shot well.

I started playing with 147gr bullets last year, and I tried some plated, some FMJ, Hollow Points, Cast, and most recently Moly coated.

If you want a light load, something that makes power factor in IDPA (125,000), try out 147grs.  Specifically, a moly coated 147gr like Precision Bullet or Bayou Bullets. 

I'm currently loading them up with 3.5grs of 231, and out of a 5"" XD I'm getting 940FPS!  This is a great economical load that has very little recoil, accurate, and helps keep you on target on those quick strings.  I constantly have people asking what I'm shooting, because they sound like a pea shooter, poof...poof...poof...

1.  the lee ""precision"" autodisc powder measure is not.  i've gotten up to a grain and a half difference reloading .308 with h4895 powder from one round to the next.  luckily, the grain and a half still doesn't put me over the never exceed load, so if i want to turn out a ton in a short period it's ok, but i'm just making factory level ammo at that point, nothing close to match grade.  if i want to get precise, i still have to pull and measure every load.  it does seem to get more accurate with the finer grain pistol powder, though.  

2.  make sure you put your powder in your shell every time.  i was turning out some .40 for plinking, and missed one.  strangely enough, i was also crimping way too much, because when the primer only round went off, it just barely unseated the round, not enough to get it all the way out of the brass.  it completely locked up the gun.  but at the time, all i knew was that there was a struck primer on a live round in a barrel i now had to take to a gunsmith to get opened.  more than a little nervous.  

3.  glocks are not the only weapon with unsupported chambers, just the most famous.  the hipoint will leave your brass bulged too.  (i know, i know, it's a hipoint.  it was cheap and it's fun to shoot.)  lee precision makes a bulge buster that will take care of that for you though.  you just need the lee factory crimp die to install it on.  

4.  just because the box of rifle projectiles says it has a .308 diameter does not mean it goes into any .308.  the 30-30 takes a .308 projectile, but it gets seated waaaaaaaaaay deeper into the case mouth than a .308win, and as a result, the cannelure is much higher on the projectile.  it bottoms out on the lands long after you reach the minimum OAL.  30-30 projectiles do not work in a .308win chamber.  (anybody wanna buy about 225 30-30 bullets?)

edit 5.  although it is sometimes better to ask forgiveness than permission, in regards to your wifes ultrasonic jewelry cleaner, she doesn't have to give it to you.... but the brass does sparkle!

I stopped by the auto parts store to buy a new head light bulb for my truck and while I was there I remembered people on teh forums talking about putting Nu Finish car polish in their tumblers.

So I picked up a bottle. I figured even if it didn't work on my brass I could at least put it on my motorcycles.

I emptied the media out of my tumbler (it was nasty) and washed the bowl (also pretty nasty.) Then I filled it with new corn cob media and added about a cap full of Nu Finish.

I ran it for a few minutes to distribute the polish and then dumped in a bunch of .45 Colt and .45 ACP brass.

After about three hours I dumped the brass out. Holy crap did it look nice. It looks just like the new Starline brass that I bought.

I'm convinced. And a bottle of Nu Finish ought to last my lifetime (assuming I don't wash my motorcycles very often.)

I've been seeing a lot of posts recently asking questions that would be answered by just glancing in any one of the many reloading manuals that are out there.

**This scares me.**

It indicates that people are reloading without understanding what they are doing.

**THIS IS DANGEROUS**

Too much powder, too little powder, too much crimp, not enough crimp, these are all dangerous conditions and they can cause your gun to go kaboom.

**The last thing you want is for your gun to blow up in your face.**

My advice to all new reloaders is to **STOP**. Step back from the press, pick up the manual and read it.

*What's that you say? You don't have a manual?*

**GO GET ONE!**

Any manual: Hornady, Lymans, Lee, The ABCs of Reloading. Pick one. Then read it.

Just watching YouToob videos is not enough. Sure, they are great for showing you how a press works, but they do not have the detailed information you need to know.

Absorb the knowledge. Get the 311. Whatever the kids are saying these days.

Seriously, if you don't know what you are doing, you are going to get hurt. Or, maybe even worse, you are going to let your friend/girlfriend/spouse shoot some of your reloads and the gun will go kaboom and they will get hurt.

**Then how will you feel?**

* 1) I have never trimmed a case. I have periodically checked them(with Lee Case gauge/trimmer). No piece of brass has been fired more than 3x. I remember months ago I read about case trimming and thought it was super important. **Is it bad just to measure a couple in a batch and ""eye-ball"" the rest?**
* 2) Bullet weights.  **I bought a box of Hornady 168g HPBT.  None of them registered 168 on my Hornady digital scale.  Is this normal?**
* 3) Bullet weights part deux.  I've been playing around with different HPBT (168, 175, 220).  **My Sierra manual shows identical powders for 168 and 175, but somehow 38.4g of Benchmark has higher velocity on 175 than 38g on 168. How does this relationship work?**
* 4) Bullet seating depth.  I've been using the ""Match the length up to  Hornady Match ammo I have"" method.  **What is the best way to determine the ideal bullet seating?** Do I need to buy calipers? How do I determine how far from the lans?
* 5) I'm currently half-assed ""logging"". **What are some best practices for keeping accurate logs?** What should I write down?


Thanks!

EDIT: Bonus story - I ran my first very first batch of 40 a month or two ago. It took me forever because I was figuring everything out/super paranoid.  I definitely winced the first time I pulled the trigger on my first reload, afraid that my idiot self had done something wrong and was about to die.  Everything went well until I had about 5 left and I pulled the trigger and ""click.""  I've read horror stories of delayed firings and lodged bullets so of course I was freaking out.  Pulled the round out, primer punched, bullet still in case. Removed the bolt, checked the barrel. After letting it sit for an hour or so (for some reason I was convinced it was going to go off at any second) I took it home and pulled the bullet. Out comes the bullet..... with no powder.  I guess I checked the load to make sure the powder measure was still on and forgot to re-charge before seating.",,False,,t5_2rloq,1362590093.0,,,True,t3_19rz9y,http://www.reddit.com/r/reloading/comments/19rz9y/successfully_ran_through_my_first_several_batches/,

I took these targets, cut them out of the paper and scanned these at 1:1 scale into JPEGs and imported them into AutoCAD. With everything to scale, it was really easy to designate each shot on the software. After getting the data digitized into autocad, it was really simple (read: fun) to get all the data out of it. [This image is the ladder tests separated into each cycle, and also stacked vertically] (http://i.imgur.com/SyFjt.png?2).

Conclusions??

-Best Vertical groupings at 44, 44.5, 45 gr on ladder 2. 

-Best ""repeatable"" vertical grouping at 43.5, 44, 44.5 gr. 

-Lowest MOA interladder at 44 gr.

-Lowest Vertical grouping interladder at 45gr (2nd place 44 gr).

-I think I should load at 44gr of varget

________

Questions:

- On a relatively low wind day, why are we concerned with vertical groupings only? Shouldnt we just shoot 3 shot groups and see where we end up?

- On a handful of occasions, the order of the powder charge does not go from highest to lowest. Is this a result of the barrel harmonics/whipping as the bullet leaves the barrel? For example, a 44gr charge exits the barrel while its whipping down, while a 43 gr charge exists the barrel as its whipping up.

Most people under-rate the effectiveness of the little zippity bullet, and the rifle that fires it based on the stuff their uncle told them about ""back in 'Nam"". In reality, this nimble little cartridge, has displaced the .308 Winchester in competition for the last 20 years. The recoil is significantly lighter, and the little VLD bullets are better than anything that is commonly available in .30 cal. However, most people relegate their .223 and AR's to being used in the rock pit with 55 grain or 62 grain 'plinking' ammo, and are afraid to let the rifle stretch its legs.

**The .223/5.56 Myth**
I am going to go against conventional wisdom here, and just start out with my conclusion. .223 Remington and 5.56 NATO are the same round. There is not one iota of difference, and here is why.

&gt;While there is a myth that 5.56 NATO cases are thicker and hence have less capacity than commercial .223 cases, this has been shown to be false. Each brand of case and each manufacturing lot has a slightly different case capacity; 5.56 NATO and .223 commercial cases tend to have nearly identical case capacity when measured using the water test.[6] The NATO specification allows a higher chamber pressure. NATO EPVAT test barrels made for 5.56mm NATO measure chamber pressure at the case mouth, as opposed to the location used by the United States civil standards organization SAAMI. The piezoelectric sensors or transducers NATO and SAAMI use to conduct the actual pressure measurements also differ. This difference in measurement method accounts for upwards of 137.9 megapascals (20,000 psi) difference in pressure measurements. This means the NATO EPVAT maximum service pressure of 430 megapascals (62,000 psi) for 5.56mm NATO, is reduced by SAAMI to 379.21 megapascals (55,000 psi) for .223 Remington.[7] *In contrast to SAAMI, the other main civil standards organization C.I.P. defines the maximum service and proof test pressures of the .223 Remington cartridge equal to the 5.56mm NATO.*

The place and method that SAMMI uses to measure pressure is in a different place then where NATO measures pressure.

**Differences in .223 Remington Chambers**
There are a wide variety of chamber variations that vary mainly in the throat area. The ""NATO"" throat is the longest, the 'Wylde' is in-between, and a true .223 Remington is the shortest.

The type of chamber that you choose should be based on your bullet choice.

**Bullet Selection**
 If you are shooting an AR15 with cartridges loaded to 2.260 (mag length), then you should choose a short throat so that your preferred bullet has the minimum amount of jump. This will give you long barrel life, and very good accuracy.

If you are shooting a bolt action that allows you to feed longer rounds from the magazine, or want to single load Very Low Drag bullets in an AR-15, you can go with either the Wylde throating arrangement that will give you an OAL of 2.450 with an 80 SMK, or the the NATO arrangement that is .100 longer. The extra length allows you to get more velocity out of the bullets, because if they are loaded to mag length, they will take away from powder space.

The twist rate of your barrel is also important to what bullets you can use. The common 1:9 twist is good for lightweight bullets up to the 69 grain class bullets. For a good all around rifle, go with a 1:8 twist, or 1:7. If you are shooting 90gr (not 80's) out of a 20 inch barrel, then a 1:6.5 is advised.

**Powder Selection**
There are only 3 real options when it comes to getting stellar performance out of .223 Remington at distance, and they are the same powders you should use for .308. Those choices are Reloader 15, Varget, and H4895. Yes, you can get equal performance out of other powders, but these are commonly available, and are what sets the standard. I prefer Reloader 15 because it meters very well, and gives me the most velocity in a fairly temperature stable powder.


22-24 grains is where you will want to be with these powders for mag length bullets, and carefully work-up the VLD loads if you go beyond 24 grains. My rifle can handle 25 grains because it has a NATO length throat and maximum head-space.
**My Loads**

24gr Reloader 15 or Varget, Sierra 77 Match King, OAL-2.260 (Standard Rapid-Fire load for Highpower Shooters. Safe for most rifles.)

The COAL was 2.25"", with a .001"" crimp.

I went to the range with a friend and we both chronoed our loads out of our new 16"" AR-15s. He was shooting a Daniel Defense DDM4, and I was shooting my build with a 16"" PSA upper. Both barrels are 1:7 twist, both chrome lined, both similar (if not identical) specs.

I chronoed my first shot at 2749 fps. I figured it must've been a mistake, so I took a second shot, and it measured 2751 fps. Next shot was 2753 fps. Primers looked fine, no cratering or flattening. A couple more shots were around 2800 fps. My friend then (jaw agape) brought his rifle over in front of the chronograph and loaded a round from my batch to see what he would get. Sure enough, that shot chronographed 2806 fps.

I still wasn't convinced the chronograph was reading correctly, until he shot his loads. He loaded some 69 grain SMKs over 24.8 grains of Varget with a Remington 7 1/2 primer in Remington brass, and averaged 2650 fps. This is much closer to the expected velocity for this kind of load. He had a second load with 25.7 grains of Varget that chronoed at 2770 fps, far more powder than my load, and it still didn't match its velocity.

Anyone have any idea what's going on here? I know the CCI #41 is a magnum primer, and increases pressure compared to standard small rifle primers, but I wouldn't expect a 100 fps velocity increase from them. Varget doesn't even need a magnum primer. I surely wouldn't expect 2800 fps with a 68 grain bullet out of a 16"" AR with that charge.

EDIT: I forgot to mention, we went to the rifle silhouette range and shot at some rams as well. My load was over a good foot high on the first shot after he had dialed in his rifle for his load.

(Current setup is a lee single stage press) Now I have heard how the Glock .40s have a tendency to weaken the brass due to a lack of case support and cause subsequent reloads to result in a ruptured case upon firing. I've done some searching and it seems like people have different answers for the question of reloading .40 from a glock. 

Some say that they install an aftermarket barrel like Lone Wolf that supports the cartridge completely and reload only the brass from their new-barreled Glock. Some say they just use a special Redding die (GRx) or the Lee Bulge Buster (However Lee specifically states that it isn't meant for glocked brass, some state it's just a CYA thing) and reload even range pickups. Some even say that the unsupported case issue was only a problem with Gen 1/2 and reload for their Gen 3/4 like any other cartridge.

I need a definite answer to this question. If I get a Gen 3/4, would I really need to invest in a barrel/die or is this whole thing with bulged brass blown out of proportion?

Also, extra semi-related question. Will Lee 10mm dies work for .40 S&amp;W?

Tumbler and media shipped together - it took about 1 day to get in the mail, and about 3 days to get to me in Santa Clara, CA from Orem, UT. Reasonably quick shipping for such a heavy item.

**Packaging:**

StainlessTumblingMedia.com just took advantage of the packaging for the thumlers tumbler, and put a box of their media inside. Worked out fine. Putting it together was a lot simpler than I thought it might be. Took about 15 minutes, and required only a pair of pliers.

**Price:**

I paid $245 for the tumbler, media, lemi-shine, and shipping to CA. I did some research, and that price seems to be about as good as it gets. If I ordered the media from them separately, and tried to get the tumbler elsewhere, shipping ended up killing any deal I could find. If you are the maker type, you can buy the tumbler drum separate from the tumbling stand, but I am not sure there is any benefit to this (as the time/cost of making the motorized tumbling stand would need to be less than about $50). 

The lemi-shine is a necessary ingredient for the system, and to my surprise, can be had in my local Safeway. I got a few extra bottles for $4 each. If you end up getting this system, I wouldn't be afraid of stocking up on lemi-shine. Stuff smells amazing.

**Functionality:**

I have tried a vibratory tumbler with corn cob and various polishes, I have tried Birchwood Casey case cleaner (and a few others), and an ultrasonic cleaner. Basically, I tried every other recommended system before dropping the $250 for a stainless tumbler. NOTHING worked as well as the stainless does, and the stainless takes far, far less time. 

I use a postage scale ($20 @ Walmart) to weigh out 2 lbs of .45 ACP casings (about 160 casings, preferably deprimed). Place those in the tumbler drum with a casing-full of lemi-shine and two good squirts of dawn (I have been told this may even be too much - I am going to try one squirt next time). Fill the drum to the line, replace the gasket, and screw on the top. This part of the process takes about 5 minutes.

Place the drum on the stand, and turn the motor on. If the brass is really, really, really bad (like, left in a bucket on a range, mixed with steel casings, for 3 months, in the rain, under a tree that likes to drop flowers and seeds), I let it run for 4.5 hours. If the brass is freshly retrieved (indoor range, or ""you just shot it"" brass), I leave it in there for 2.5 hours. 

Once you are done running the tumbler, you can just turn the motor off and remove the drum. Then, open the drum and flush it several times with water to rinse the soap out. I finish the process by placing the slurry of steel and casings in a rotary media separator that has been filled with water, and agitate it for a minute or two. The stainless pins are heavy enough that decanting off water, and separating them from the brass, takes little time.

At this point, you get a real look at how clean your casings are. Let me tell you - they come out amazing. I have put the worst looking brass I can find in there, and it consistently comes out brilliant gold, inside and out. The product advertises that it cleans the primer pocket as well, and I have found that it does a good job of cleaning it out with large pistol primer sized pockets. They are never 100% perfect, but they are far, far better than any other method I have ever seen. StainlessTumblingMedia.com has plenty of before-and-after pictures of casings. I can confidently say those pictures are accurate. Your brass will actually look that good.

The stainless pins can be stored wet, so just decant off the water from your media separator, and save the pins and some water in the tumbler drum for the next time. 

There is some debate about how to dry the casings - whether using a hair dryer is best, or leaving them on a towel, or some other method. On a whim, I used a mesh bag from my camping gear. I placed all the soaking wet casings in the bag, and whirled it around outside for a minute, then hung it inside to dry. No fan, no hair dryer, no more electricity needed. The casings were perfectly dry in about an hour. I got my mesh bag at a local surplus place for a couple of dollars - I believe the brand was StanSport.

**Overall:**

Worth every cent. I tried every other cleaning method I could think of, and the stainless tumbling media was, by far, the best. The casings come out cleaner than any other method, and it takes less time. It's about as noisy as your average clothes washer, so run it in your wash room or outside. The lack of toxic chemicals (like BC case cleaner), or acids (like vinegar - a whole other story), mean that you can be lazy, and leave your casings in the drum for a day without ruining a batch. The only consumables required are dish soap (I use Dawn), and lemi-shine - both of which are cheap and easily found. The initial investment is high ($245, approx), but you will get ridiculously clean and shiny casings every time.

Go buy one!

**TL;DR:** Pictures at stainlesstumblingmedia.com are real, brass actually looks that good. Primer pockets don't come out quite perfect, but better than any other method, and always accept a new primer without a problem. Inside/outside of casings look like polished gold. Often, primer pockets are perfect. Spend the money to get the tumbler/media kit ($229 + tax, shipping) - its everything you need except dawn dish soap. Process takes about 3 - 5 hours from nasty brass, to perfect and dry brass. Stainless tumbling worked better than chemicals, ultrasonic, or vibratory tumbling.

I'm going to assume for the moment that cost is a factor. I'm also going to assume that you'll read a copy of the [ABC's of Reloading](http://www.amazon.com/ABCs-Reloading-9th-Rodney-James/dp/B0061Q6JEI/ref=sr_1_14?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1323822235&amp;sr=8-14) and have [one](http://www.amazon.com/Hornady-Handbook-8th/dp/B004K5B5XC/ref=sr_1_6?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1323822294&amp;sr=1-6)  (preferably [two](http://www.amazon.com/Nosler-Reloading-Book-NO/dp/B0011TA7LG/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1323822382&amp;sr=1-1)) good load books on your shelf. IMO the best way to start is with the Lee Breech Lock Kits.  They contain nearly everything in a box.  You have two options:

[With auto-prime](http://www.midwayusa.com/product/121744/lee-challenger-breech-lock-single-stage-press-kit)

[without](http://www.midwayusa.com/product/423081/lee-challenger-breech-lock-single-stage-press-anniversary-kit)

Auto-prime is a hand-held priming tool;  I had one previously and didn't like it.  I prefer on-press because it reduces fatigue.  Others prefer the auto-prime because of increased feel.

Now, you've got your press and most of your equipment.  You're not done yet.  You're going to need a [caliber specific pilot](http://www.midwayusa.com/Find?dimensionids=4294846304&amp;statuses=Available&amp;statuses=In+Stock&amp;statuses=Backorder+OK&amp;statuses=Special+Order&amp;statuses=Not+Available&amp;statuses=No+Backorder&amp;statuses=Coming+Soon&amp;statuses=Other&amp;minPrice=&amp;maxPrice=&amp;sortBy=1&amp;itemsPerPage=20&amp;PreviousCategoryDimensionId=11887&amp;promotionId=&amp;userSearchQuery=) to work with the trimmer included in the Lee kit.

You're also going to need dies.  If you get a set of lee dies, they come with a shell holder.  Otherwise you'll need to buy one of those, too.  Generally, one brand of dies are compatible with another brand of press;  they screw in and the threads are pretty standard unless you're doing something *really* exotic.

Lastly, some other misc tools that really come in handy (read: extra important) are a [reloading tray](http://www.midwayusa.com/product/110254/mtm-universal-reloading-tray-50-round-plastic-red), some [calipers](http://www.midwayusa.com/product/604242/frankford-arsenal-electronic-caliper-6-stainless-steel) and a [bullet puller](http://www.midwayusa.com/product/215517/frankford-arsenal-impact-bullet-puller?cm_vc=S014ID604242)

With all that, you should be set for just about anything and everything. You may ""outgrow"" some of this equipment, but it will get you a very good start. You will consumables such as powder, primers and bullets of course (and eventually brass), just go with what your load book tells you. 

Also, I have used, and mostly still use, every item I linked to.

**Misc Questions**

Q: What is meant by ""fast"" and ""slow"" powder?

A: Without going beyond the scope of this post, powders burn at different rates.  In general, ""fast"" powders are for pistols and shotguns and ""slower"" powders are for rifles.


Q: I want to load for an M1 Garand.  Is there anything special I need to know?

A: **YES!**  The design of the M1 is such that it needs a very specific type of powder or you will damage the operating rod and maybe the receiver.  Stick with H4895 or IMR4895 until you get your feet wet.


Q: Can I re-use brass from that big crate o' Mosin ammo I got?

A: No.  The cases are made of steel which will tear up your press and dies.  Also, the primers are incompatible with your press.


Q: Incompatible primers?  Can you elaborate? 

A: For pistol and rifle, there are two types of primers:  Berdan and Boxer.  Boxer primers are A-OK, they can be removed with standard presses and dies due to their construction.  Berdan primers can not;  You'll break your depriming pin if you try.


Q:  Can I just fill my case to the rim with powder instead of measuring?

A:  Only if you have good insurance and don't mind having your firearm explode in your face.


Q: What is a ""Squib""

A: A Squib is when a bullet doesn't have enough force behind it form the burning powder to make it all the way out of the barrel, and the bullet becomes stuck inside the bore.  This isn't fun to clear, and can cause a kaboom if you shoot the next round without clearing the obstruction first.  At a noisy range, they can be tough to notice, so pay extra attention and **follow your load book to the letter**


Q:  Is it safe to deprime live primers?

A:  Generally.  Be extra careful and don't apply too much force!

Q:  My cases are difficult to resize!

A:  Make sure you're using lube!


Q:  My bottle-neck rifle cases are coming out with dents in the shoulder!

A:  Make sure that you aren't using too much lube, and also keep the lube off the shoulder.


Q:  What's so special about carbide dies?

A:  Carbide dies are generally only available for pistol rounds and have a carbide ring inside of them to (supposedly) enable you to resize them without using lube.  Use lube anyway.

I sealed them with duct tape to try and protect from moisture getting in.  Then like a moron I left the powder in there for what I planned to only be a few days and ended up being a few months.  Fast forward to now and when I pour the powder from the hopper into a clean bowl to check the consistency I notice that it is clumping together a lot kind of like how cat litter clumps when wet.  

I had 2 hoppers that had powder in them that was like this.  Since both hoppers had the same powder from the same container I just emptied them into a clean mason jar to separate it from the 1 bottle of good stuff I have.

My question is, is there a way for me to salvage this powder or is it not safe to use?  If it is not salvageable then what is the best way to dispose of it?  The gun range I am a member of has a retail area that advertises taking and disposing of old ammo so I am thinking of asking them if they can dispose of it properly.

Wanted to know if maybe keeping it in a closed space with some dessicants or something would make it usable again first.

http://leeprecision.com/delux-rifle-3-di-223-rem.html

2 of the die's look like they have depriming pins. I'm assuming 1 is the neck resizer and 1 is the full length resizer. Why do I need 2 resizers, or do I pick which one works for me (reloading my own fired brass vs range picked up brass)?

Do I need a seperate die for powder loading? My current one is marked for 9mm. The link above doesn't mention a crimp die.

This set: http://leeprecision.com/pacesetter-dies-223-rem.html
This set has a crimp die, a bullet seating die (which the first link doesn't mention having), and a full length sizing die. This kit seems to have more of what I want (but still no mention of powder charging?)

In addition I think I need a new plate for the press to fit .223 vs the 9mm that I bought it with. Also new feed fingers and die for the bullet feeder. Maybe even more then I don't realize.

I clearly need some help to go in the right direction here. I think some of the terminology/names are confusing me.

I recently picked up a ccw and have come to the realization that I really enjoy shooting. I am putting 50-100 rounds at the range with my ccw (Ruger LC9) every two weeks for practice, as I feel I owe it to myself as well as those around me. I also realize I will soon get a range gun just to shoot for fun occassionally as well, as I don't want to end up with thousands rounds quickly achieved on my ccw.

At the same time, I have started to consider whether it is worth to reload for me. I think I would only be reloading 9mm for the time being, and have some rough math figuring I would save ~$90-$100 dollars per 1000 9mm bullets. I'm not quite sure if this is worth the initial investment and my time.

So, reloading, how did you come to the conclusion that reloading was right for you? Do you regret any parts of your reloading history or wish you did anything different? Any advice?

Ended up getting 11 boxes, each 9""x9""6"", which I calculate to be about 23 gallons total.  Plus there was a little extra.  Using 135# as the general weight of a 5gal bucket full of wheel weights, I figure I got about 650#, give or take, for $120.  

Looking for a sanity check from any casters here.  I've heard people online say they pay $50 for a 5gal, some say they will never pay for them.

I reload .45 ACP, .45 Colt, .30-06 and .270 Winchester and have been reloading on a single stage press for about a year now.

For context - the comment that I was replying to stated that he could buy cheap .45 ACP for $18/50 rounds. I replied that I can reload better ammo for $7/50 rounds and can produce 100 rounds an hour.

He then said:

&gt;You are faster then all of the people I've talked to about single stage presses. You can do match quality ammo at $7 for 50? Cheaper then I thought. I assume that's reusing brass. I tried saving brass for my brother to reload. Lasted 1 box of ammo, and I chucked them all. Felt like a puppy chasing tennis balls.
&gt;
&gt;Me? I value my time more then I value money. I'd much rather spend the $11 and spend an hour playing basement hockey with my 8yo son. I mean really, it's $11.

I bought 1000 pieces of .45 ACP brass for $60 when I started. I reclaim about 95% of my brass when I shoot. Some days I grab other people's brass (after asking if they reload) and come out ahead. .45 ACP is a low pressure round, so you can reload the brass 50+ times. I'm set for brass for a long time.

Sure it's only $11. 

But if you shoot 100 rounds once a month that's a savings of $264 a year. That would pay for a single stage  reloading setup right there.

If you shoot 150 rounds twice a month (about what I shoot) that's a savings of $792 a year. That's a new pistol right there.

Of course you are trading time for money. You do that every day. Do you grow your own food or buy it at the store? Do you change your own oil or go to Jiffy Lube?

Reloading is just another time vs. money trade-off.

I enjoy reloading. I get to play with the variables and find a load that works in my gun. And works better than the $18 stuff.

Reloading is not for everyone, but don't try and talk people out of it just because you think your time is more valuable.

Good for you if you think it's a better use of your time to play with your kids - I agree with you.

I tried searching this sub-reddit but I couldn't find anything so either my search skills suck or maybe someone hasn't asked this question (doubtful).

I've never re-loaded and from what I've read, it saves money in the long run and is reliable as long as it's done safely and accurately. I recently purchased 500 .45 ACP rounds that are obvious reloads from a gun show and haven't had any problems with them so far, which is why I'm strongly considering reloading my own.

We (gramps &amp; I) used to collect the brass from the range and take it to a local gun shop for reloading (they would buy it from us) and that would basically pay for the rounds we used each time we went shooting. Since that shops doesn't do this anymore, I looked around and found that there aren't any shops in my area that accept brass for re-loading.

I hate leaving the brass behind when it can be used again; however, I don't know how many times they can be used or what to look for as far as tale-tale signs that they are no longer safe. I know about creases in the casing etc. but how many times can that metal be stretched before it is no longer safe?

Many thanks in advance and I apologize again if this has already been discussed.

I only shoot my own cast lead and since it puts me at a slight disadvantage in terms of accuracy and ballistics, I treat it as a long-term project of refining every step of the loading process to get optimal performance with my handmade projectiles.

I've been at it for about 6 months now and I've found that the Lee 200gr round nose gas-checked bullet shoots fairly well for me using a pure wheel weight alloy with yellow dragon lube. I shoot them at fairly low velocities (1600-1700fps) so that I knock down the steel targets but don't get too flinchy shooting well over 100 shots off-hand in a day.

This month, I finally got to testing the use of dacron fillers and I'm sharing my first-hand results for anyone who is interested in the subject.  I know there's a lot of debate about it, but I've known at least a couple of long time shooters who have used filler in the way that I am using it and have had only success and no problems with chambers, etc.

I used SR4759 powder at charges of 18.0gr and 19.0gr for this test. At 18.0gr, the case is about half full. 19.0gr is a reliable shooting load that I have used in competition for several months and I wanted to see where the filler would sit between these two in average velocity. I tore polyester quilt batt (dacron) into small pieces fluffed up just large enough to fill the empty space in the case without being packed down. I shake the case to make sure I don't hear powder shaking around and use no more than necessary for this.

I normally only shoot at 200 yards or more, but for these load tests I shot at 100 yards so that I could remove some wind effect from the paper results.

I shot 70 10-shot strings through onto separate paper bullseyes and through a chronograph to measure the averages and velocity variances across three different loads.
  
  
  
*A. SR 4759 18.0gr - No filler (30 shots)*  
Average velocity: 1640fps  
Average standard deviation: 12fps  
Average extreme spread: 34fps  
  
  
  

*B. SR 4759 18.0gr - Dacron Filler (20 shots)*  
Average velocity: 1660fps  
Average standard deviation: 8fps  
Average extreme spread: 26fps  
  
  
  
*C. SR 4759 19.0gr - No filler  (20 shots)*  
Average velocity: 1682fps  
Average standard deviation: 13fps  
Average extreme spread: 40fps  
  
  
  

The chronograph results look fairly telling. I will do more similar tests soon, but the velocities with the dacron filler are measurably more consistent. When you are are trying to get everything you can out of ammo, a 33-40% improvement in velocity consistency is a pretty good return for something that basically costs nothing except for another 5-10 seconds per loaded round.

As for the paper results, all of the loads shot 10-shot groups inside 2-3"" or better, but the dacron filler loads measured 1.5"" and 1.7"" each. The best runner up was a non-filled 19.0gr group of about 1.8"". Again, this isn't terribly compelling evidence, but the consistency of the velocities is enough for me on its own.",,False,,t5_2rloq,False,,,True,t3_1gkea5,http://www.reddit.com/r/reloading/comments/1gkea5/finally_did_a_proving_test_for_dacron_fillers/,

Need some help!,13,2,36,http://www.reddit.com/r/reloading/comments/1e98a1/ive_actually_managed_to_mess_up_polishing_with/,"After reading post after post on ~~/r/youshouldswitchtosteel~~ /r/reloading praising steel media, I finally decided to take the plunge. I couldn't afford the big beefy high speed tumbler but I did get the steel and the lemi-shine. I wound up getting the large rock tumbler from Harbor Freight. 

I put in the brass (.45) along with some of the media, a squirt of dawn and the lemi-shine then let it tumble for 4 hours. Then it came out...less than what I was expecting. The interiors and primer pocket were clean but it was a satin finish at best. 

I thought I had the ratios off so I spent a lot of time looking at various websites trying to find people with the same setup that I had. They were all using similar amounts of stuff but with *MUCH* better results. I did find one person that said you needed to put it in for much longer (8-10 hours) if you're using the harbor freight tumbler. At the same time, they said they got better results when they added One Shot to the mix as well. 

So I tried that. After a 12 hour tumble, the results are indistinguishable from the first time I tried. The following photo is the results. The left piece of brass was polished with corn in a vibrating tumbler for 4 hours. The one on the right was a 12 hour tumble with steel. http://i.imgur.com/AHx0kxC.jpg

Can someone please tell me what I did wrong (that doesn't involve some variation of ""you should have bought the big expensive tumbler"")? Other people with this same setup are doing much better than me so I have to be missing something here.

**UPDATE:** Ok, I took the advice from some of the posts and the brass came out much shinier than my previous attempts. I'd call it slightly better than the corn media at this point. I'll keep fiddling with the portions a bit and maybe reduce the lemi-shine even more.

I have limited supply of .308 150gr bullets which are no problem on OAL. I have a lot more 110gr soft nose that I would like to try at an OAL of 52.50mm but that only seats the bullet ~2.5mm.

Post-1982 pennies weigh 2.5 grams, and are made of 97.5% Zinc and 2.5% Copper. That means for every penny, you get 2.4375 grams, or 37.616 grains worth of Zinc. This means it would take a little under two pennies to cast a 63 grain 5.56x45mm bullet.

Zinc's melting point of 419.53 °C is not too far away from that of Lead's, at 327.46 °C. The Mohs hardness of Zinc is also relatively small - 2.5 - compared to metals like Copper (3.0) and Lead (1.5), so wear and tear wouldn't be too bad.

At $0.02 a bullet, I'm thinking this could potentially save quite a bit of money.

Then I put together a shopping list, some of which I had already figured out, and some of which was added or changed after reading the reloading manual.

* [Lee 4 Hole Turret Press with Auto Index Deluxe Kit](http://www.midwayusa.com/product/785993/lee-4-hole-turret-press-with-auto-index-deluxe-kit?cm_vc=wishList) - This is about $100 more than the single stage press, but it looks like I can take out the auto indexer to make it work like a single stage for maximum accuracy when doing rifle ammo, and put the indexer back in for fast reloading of pistol rounds.

Total cost at current prices is about $346, and add in an ultrasonic cleaner for $75 for a grand total of $421.

That is pretty expensive for me, and that's not even including my first batch of brass, powder, primers, and bullets, and there's bound to be little things here and there like extra ammo boxes and other miscellaneous stuff that will also have to be acquired.  However, it looks like I should be able to reload for around half the price per round of commercial ammo, and once I figure out WTF I'm doing, my handloads should be hopefully much more accurate as well.  So it'll take me around 800 or more rounds to break even, which is quite a bit of shooting (and maybe something like half my barrel life if what I read about .243 is to be believed).  If I reload 9mm as well, it'll be another probably $50 for the dies and another turret, and I won't save as much per round, but I'll probably shoot a lot more 9mm, so that'll help me break even too.

Does anyone have feedback about any of these components, or good/bad experiences?  I've tried to read reviews and pick ones that look decent but not too expensive, but personal experience can be really helpful in choosing.


----
----


Now, as to the questions I came up with as I've been reading...  It's quite a list, in no particular order, and some of these may be just me over-thinking things, so any information you can give would be appreciated:

**1. Are all primer brands of a given size interchangeable in terms of size and function?  (Of course accuracy may still be affected.)**

The book says no; some primers may be quite a bit different, and generate different pressures that are not predictable.  On the other hand, reading online I haven't really come across anything like that.  With primers being in short supply right now, do I absolutely have to get the Remington 9 1/2 primers they recommend for .243 if I want to use their load data?

**2. How many times can .243 be reloaded?  How many times for 9mm?**

The book says pressure has a major effect on how many times a case can be reloaded, and that there's a big difference between, say, 40k and 60k psi in terms of brass life; that at 40k you might get a dozen or more reloads, whereas at 60k you might get as few as 3 or 4.  I'm hoping to get as many reloads as possible since brass is the most expensive component of the cartridge.  How many reloads can I generally expect from good quality brass, and at what pressures?

As for 9mm, the book says you can typically reload them around 8 times; online, I've read that people just reload them until they develop visible defects.  I'll be loading 9mm to relatively low pressures with cheap bullets for stuff like Speed Steel and IDPA matches. (Minimum power factor for my IDPA class is 147 gr at 850 fps, or 115 gr at 1087 fps; I'm leaning toward the 147s.)

**3. What is the heaviest bullet that a 1:9.125 twist rate will stabilize reliably?**

From reading online, it looks like that twist is not fast enough to stabilize the 115 gr bullets that I hear are the best target rounds, but there are some pretty good looking bullets in 107, 105, 100, 95, 90, 87, 85, etc.  I have no problem getting some bullets to experiment with, but I just don't want to get a giant box of something only to find out that it's not stabilizing.

**4. When do you get rid of your brass, and what signs do you watch for?**

Visible splitting or cracking of course, and the book talks about the bright line that generally appears just before head separation happens.  The book also says to never length-trim the brass more than 4 times.  What other signs do you watch for, or do you sometimes throw them out just based on number of times reloaded or something else?

**5. Do people normally just keep several pounds of powder and primers around of different types and brands?**

For instance, for different bullet weights, the book recommends different powders for best accuracy.  Do people usually have two or three types of suitable powder for experimenting, or do you mainly stick with one and use it for everything?

**6. How much can the cartridge OAL vary?**

The book says +/-0.005"", depending.  Obviously closer is better.

**7. Do you throw out damaged cases individually, or get rid of the entire lot/batch?**

The book says to throw out the entire lot when 5% (1 out of 20) cases shows any sign of needing to be retired.  Is this the same for rifle and pistol brass?

**8. The Lee 3-die .243 set has a full length sizing die, a collet neck sizing die, and a bullet seating die.  There is a separate factory crimp die that has good reviews, but do I need that?**

The book suggests that crimping is probably not necessary for a bolt action target rifle, but would be needed for a semi auto, tube magazine, or generally for ammo that may be exposed to recoil or rough handling.

**9. How do you assign lot numbers or divide up/organize your cases?**

I'm thinking if I get a bag of 100 cases, I'd split them up into groups of 20 in separate boxes or sections, and just number each one more or less arbitrarily to keep track of them.

**10. What powders should I get to start off with?  I'll be reloading .243 and eventually 9mm as well.**

For .243, the book suggests IMR-4350 or H4831, and Varget looks like another good candidate; is one of those more versatile than another, or does it matter?  Also, are some of these easier to measure than others?

For 9mm, the book suggests N340, and also lists Unique, Bullseye, and Titegroup.

**11. What is another good reloading manual to get?  Lee?  Hornady?  Speer?  Sierra?  Or at this point is it sufficient to just hit the websites of the bullet makers for reload data?**

Thanks in advance for your help, I'm really looking forward to getting into reloading!

I've recently taken an interest in reloading, and after much reading both in physical form (Modern Reloading 2nd Ed.) and various online sources (this forum and others) I took the dive and bought some equipment several days ago. The following is where I'm at so far: 

What I hope to accomplish by reloading:

*Learn a new valuable skill

*Save money

*Have a hobby that will remain relevant for much of my life

*Be able to produce high quality ammo for competition shooting (although I don't shoot competition yet due to time constraints, I hope to do so in the future

While on one hand I like to be well read on something before trying it, I also understand the value in hands on experience (i.e. making lots of mistakes, and never forgetting them)

Here is my current setup: http://i.imgur.com/smgmh.jpg

I purchased the Lee Breech Lock Challenger for two reasons. The first, if I decide that I absolutely hate reloading I'm not out much money. Secondly, I own several larger caliber rifles, particularly .375 H&amp;H, and most of what I've read suggests that most people use single stage presses for higher end rifle rounds or specialty calibers. This allows the press to remain relevant for me, even if I decide to upgrade to a turret or progressive later on. 

Currently I shoot .45 ACP the most. So this is what I plan on learning to reload with. It will allow me to test my loads and receive more feedback (I hope?). So I also bought the Lee carbide dies for .45 ACP. 

I picked up the Lee Auto Prime as well. More for the Zen approach of hand loading primers than anything else. I purchased it from a local supplier and he also suggested the added benefit of being able to prime away from the bench. This appealed to me, so I went with it. 

I picked up the Hornady digital scale for powder weighing. Most people seem to dislike the balance scales and both options seemed pretty equivalent in cost for what seems like miles of difference to me, the choice seemed obvious from my beginner eyes. Any thoughts on this?

Universal Loading Block, they all seemed the same to me, so I went with the cheapest choice. 

I also picked up a set of digital calipers which aren't pictured. No one had any micrometers, and the general consensus online was that digital calipers work well enough for most casual reloaders.

I don't have a lot of space, so I threw together an impromptu bench based off several I had seen from apartment dwellers. 

For my first 100 rounds I purchased all new components, as I figured this would be easiest for me to work with. 

I purchased new Winchester Brass 100 cases, 100 large pistol primers, 1lb of Hodgdons Titegroup, and 100 Hornady .45 cal .451 230gr FMJ-RN bullets.

Question: How can I find out exactly which tolerance of bullet that my handgun can hold? I notice that Hornady sells the .45 cal in .451, .452, and .454. While I've read some about it, I'm not quite sure how much difference it would make pressure wise or any of the real ramifications other than too much pressure = boom. I currently shoot an XDm .45 with the 4.5"" barrel. 

Eventually once I gain experience with reloading, I plan to transition to non-jacketed bullets to save money for target shooting.  

Question: How big of an issue is lead poisoning? Handling the bare lead bullets repeatedly for long amounts of time, dealing with spent brass, and tumbling all increase exposure, and since I have children I worry about harmful effects. Is washing your hands thoroughly enough? Do any of you wear latex gloves or something similar while reloading? 

Realizing that I had nothing to experiment with at this point, and not wanting to spend a lot of money on new brass that could possibly be destroyed, I went down to the local range and sure enough they sold me some used brass for what I assumed was pretty cheap. I picked this lot up for $15, it seemed fair to me, and was certainly a lot cheaper than buying it new. *EDIT* For more clarification they charge $3 a pound for mixed brass *

http://i.imgur.com/WiS9x.jpg

The largest piles are Federal and Winchester, the smaller consisted of Speer, CBC, R . P, and PMR.

Questions: Are there cheaper places to get used brass? Is this a fair shake for what I got? Also, are there any used brass brands that you absolutely won't reload? Everyone seemed to have their own brands they liked and the only one that 95% of people seemed to agree was awful was small primer .45 ACP. How can you go about telling the difference visually between large and small primer cases?

At this point I started piddling around measuring my new brass, comparing it to measurements from the old brass, different brands, measurements of new factory rounds and so forth. 

I confirmed that most of the fired cases had shrunk in length (which I had expected based on what I read). The average was around .889 for fired Winchester and Federal, and .894 for new Winchester. What surprised me the most was that the variance for the new Winchester cases I had purchased was anywhere from .892-.897. I would have figured that the new cases would have tighter tolerances. I had no new Federal cases to try. 

At this point I ran several Winchester cases through the depriming and resizing. The Lee press has a tube for collecting spent primers, however every time I deprimed, it ejected off to the right of the press, and never once went into the tube. I consulted the instructions and found nothing, am I missing something?

Anyway, most of the cases came out to .892-.894 after resizing. Which was to be expected I guess? It made me feel more comfortable that I was doing things right at this point when they were close to factory length. 

However the next step is where I ran into some problems. Expanding and bullet seating. I watch some online videos and most suggested working with empty cases to get your bullet seating right and then move forward. Sounded safe and reasonable, so I attempted it and here is what I ended up with:

http://i.imgur.com/LX34Z.jpg

So I guess I didn't flare the first case enough and when attempting to seat the bullet I crushed the case. Oops. Also note the bullet took some wear from being used as a shaping tool, is it still safe to seat in another case or could this possibly cause pressure variance? *EDIT* Well I'm sure it could cause pressure variance, rather poorly worded, I'm looking for DANGEROUS pressure variance *

No worries, I thought. I'll just expand the flare some more to seat the bullet as per the instructions. Then I ended up with the second round. Which was clearly seated to far. Oops again. Did I mention I was a total beginner? I thought I had been following the instructions the whole time.

After some tinkering here and there I ended up with a success! I hope?

http://i.imgur.com/IYm1J.jpg

As you can tell the round came out with an OAL of 1.248, which seemed well within reason of the 1.275 max listed in Modern Reloading. The neck seemed to be flush with the bullet with no visible damage.

Question: How do you know if you've seated the bullet properly? Other than looks, I'm not sure if I've done a good job, or if it merely looks like I've done a good job. Also, how do you figure out what OAL is right, other than through experimentation. Modern Reloading only suggests a minimum and maximum OAL. Do other manuals suggest an average, or starting point, like they do with starting loads?

I decided to compare it to a factory round. I didn't have a Winchester factory at the moment, I had shot them all, but I did have a Remington 230gr FMJ-RN around, which I figured was comparable. 

http://i.imgur.com/yt7Ye.jpg

1.241 OAL, which is only .007 off from the round I pressed, and also above min and within max. Seemed reasonable enough to me.

Before I started powdering loads, I thought I would come to the more experienced to judge my position. Also, to receive and heed any advice you might have. 

I know this was all a bit long-winded, but I wanted to provide as much background and detailed information as I could, instead of just asking one liners.  

Again, total beginner, help me from potentialy blowing up myself or my pistol. 

Also, thank you in advance for any advice you may have.

This first one will be on stages and operation of a progressive press featuring the Hornady Lock and Load. I will go into die operation, and the stages of the reloading process, so this can also benefit people looking at single-stage, and turret presses.

I'm currently developing a course, and figuring out the time. This session/class/discussion will be quite basic and for beginners, but I hope to have more advanced classes as well. As things get advanced, I hope others will volunteer because I'm not an expert yet. 

Any particular questions or topics you like covered?

Any particular time you'd be interested in? I'm getting married soon so time's a little scarce. Hopefully it can happen shortly. I'm thinking a Saturday in the late morning.

I've fired just a primer before, and given how loud it was, I figured it might have the “oomph” to push a bullet through the barrel....here are my results:

Weapon: Ruger P89
Barrel Length: 4.5 inches
Chamber: 9mm
Bullet: 124 gr. Jacketed FP
Primer: Winchester Small Pistol (WSP)

Loaded the round, and directed the weapon in a safe direction at several stacks of 2x4 wood. 

I fired the trigger, and heard a very muted “pop” not even as loud as a cap-gun. The action did not cycle, and no bullet exited the barrel.

I manually racked the slide to eject the brass. The shell ejected with no bullet; so the bullet departed the brass, but stopped somewhere in the barrel.

I ended up finding the bullet About 7/10 of an inch down the barrel. It was firmly lodged, and I believe if I had just racked and fired another round, I would have been in big trouble!

Removing the bullet from the barrel was not trivial by any means....it did not fall out, slide out, or gently push out.

Conclusion: A Squib round is easily detectable if paying attention...however, if I were in the middle of a match, I might not notice the muted “pop” and I could see myself racking the action and firing...this would result in a bad day.

Be sure to check your powder charge! I have a powder check on my Dillon progressive, and it would easily alert on a squib or double charge....and I'm glad I have it!

This weekend I became a reloader! 

Ok, it was just 25x rounds of .45 ACP, but I'm very happy with the results. I hope to do 100-250x rounds next weekend.

Here are some **Pictures** * of this weekend's reloading adventure:
http://imgur.com/a/ANThy

Here's a recap of what I was using:

**Workbench**: 2x4 Basics Workbench and Shelving Storage System ($67 + Wood) [You'll want a sturdy workbench for the press] Wow - this bench is very study and very heavy (I used 3/4"" plywood). I love it!

**Press**: Breech Lock Challenger Press and Bushings 50th Anniversary Kit 
 ($118 + 3 bolts) [Includes: Press, 3x bushings, Powder Measure, Scale, Powder Funnel, Cutter and lock stud, chamfer tool, sizing lube, primer pocket cleaner, and both size priming tools for this press]

**Dies/Shell Holder**: Lee 4 Carbide Pistol Die Set .45 ACP ($59) [Get dies for the caliber you intend to reload. Lee dies come with a shell holder. If non-Lee dies, you may need to get a shell holder as well for your caliber.]

**Scale**: Hornady Electronic Scale 1500 grains ($29) [You can use the scale in the Lee 50th kit, but I think this is much easier to use, and likely more accurate.]

**Powder Trickler**: Redding #5 Powder Trickler ($20) [Helpful to get exactly how much powder you want]

**Caliper**: *Updated:* Carrera Precision CP9806-TF Digital Caliper ($25) [Measure cases and overall length]

**Puller**: RCBS Power Pull Bullet Puller ($19) [Correct some mistakes with this]

**Cleaning**: Frankford Arsenal Master Tumbler Kit ($67) [Brass cleaning]

**Manuals**: Lyman #49, Sierra 5th Edition, Lee 2nd Edition ($25-30 per manual) [Be sure to use load data from a trusted manual]

**Brass**: New or used Brass. I used new Starline .45 Brass this time. [Best if you have saved your own used brass.]

**Bullets**: Cast you own lead bullets [I can't help there] or buy them online. I'm trying both Hornady and Rainier bullets. Used the Hornady this time. (~$150/1000 for Rainier, and I think just over $200/1000 for the Hornady FMJs) [Lead is cheaper than FMJs]

**Powder**: Check the Reloading Manual you get for a powder listed for your caliber. I got TiteGroup to try out on my .45 reloads. (~$20 for ~1400 rounds worth) [Start with a minimal powder load, and work your way up, but not to over the max load]

**Primers**: Get the right sized primers for your brass. I went with Federal and CCI large pistol primers. (~$40 for 1000). Federal is what I used during this reload.


Please let me know your suggestions!

I considered .223, 30-30, 9mm, and .45 ACP as the initial caliber. I started by pricing consumables from MidwayUSA, and compared a reloaded round to a comparable retail round (same bullet type &amp; bullet weight) purchased from BassPro.

Some important things to consider when looking at my chart are:

1) I assumed $500 investment on reloading equipment

2) All brass will be purchased new and fired 5 times

3) Using reloads straight from the Lyman manual, different loadouts will have different costs

4) Sales tax and shipping costs not included

5) Retail cost comparison was based on bullet type (FMJ, JHP, RN, etc) and weight only; ballistic performance was not used to keep things simple

[The results](http://imgur.com/0DFoy)


tl;dr: You can justify buying reloading equipment by reloading as few as 450 .45 ACP rounds...


**EDIT:** [Here](http://i.imgur.com/8lPsq.jpg) is another cost comparison. Note that the .223 brass was only used 3 times because the assumption I made was that it was being fired through an AR. The .243 and .308 brass were used 6 times (bolt gun), and the 45-70 brass was reloaded 8 times (straight case).

[On the left](http://i.imgur.com/3C5TV.jpg) is a Lee Classic Turret on the first bench I built, which mostly follows the [NRMA plans](http://www.shotgunsportsmagazine.com/downloads/bench_plans.pdf).  The primary modification was I faced the cabinet with poplar strips, into which I cut slots for the doors to slide in.  It's a really nice design, very sturdy, lots of storage space, and easily made with little more than a circular saw and drill.  If I were to make it again, I'd probably leave the doors off, since while they look nice, they mostly just get in the way.

[On the right](http://i.imgur.com/kxbON.jpg) is the second bench, which I built when I got the Dillon 650 and found the first bench to be too tall, even without the strong mount.  I also made it quite long, so the right side works well for cleaning and ""gunsmithing.""  I've been meaning to add cabinets or shelves on the back.

In the middle is a cheap cabinet to store reloading supplies and ammo.

A couple things I've found really useful:

I found a bunch of cheap halogen lamps, which are attached to both presses to illuminate the shell plate (as well as to light the left bench).  Good lighting is important!

Akro bins are great for storing brass, bullets, and loaded ammo.  I have a small mount attached to the front of the bench next to the Lee press, and it works great for holding the brass and bullets in a convenient location.

So I went to the range today with my friend a shot my second  batch of reloads, they all worked out great! There was however, something strange. It's was the first time that I got to shoot my reloads throught a chrono. The velocity that I measured for the first 20 rounds averaged 1260fps. This seems to me to be impossible, the manual states 904fps for 7.3 grains of unique, which is what I used. I shot some hornady tap hp 230gr factory rounds (+p) and also saw around 1200 fps. So I got some 230 gr fmj round nose factory, and that came out about 700ish (which seems about right according to the manual). I tried to increase my distance from the chrono and also tried different lighting conditions but no matter what the velocity for my rounds was consistently hitting 1260fps on average. For 50 rounds of my reloads, the minimum was 1257 and the max was 1261fps with the average of 1260. I checked my brass and there is no sign of high pressure, also I'm using my xds so the barrel is 3.3in. The maual's 904fps was created using a 4.4in barrel.

When I full resize, the brass goes into the resizing, the primer pops out, I check the shell length, then I'm good to go. it's not so simple when the shell is only going halfway in.

I guess the question is, what exactly does neck sizing do (narrow the neck opening?) and how does one determine that it has been done correctly? I'd like to tinker around with this, but I want to know what measurements I'm looking for.

Now I'm wondering if there are certain calibers that just aren't worth it to reload or calibers that are easier and less expensive to reload than others I should check out. I eventually want to get a battle rifle and a precision high powered rifle and for the precision rifle I have no idea what a good round to shoot is. I want to shoot a rifle that the sound, shock, and impact will put a smile on my face every time and that I can afford to shoot whenever. 

I want to get a nice versatile progressive reloading setup and was looking at the Dillon RL 550B. Unfortunately .50 BMG looks out of my budget so I want something I can reload without a dedicated machine that I can use on my one press. It looks like you need special accessories for some of the larger stuff too.

The lee load-master appears to need specific plates for each caliber, I know I can produce 9mm fastest with it but what if I want to switch to .38spl or .270 (those are my three calibers but I see that growing over time too)? I assume I'll have to use the perfect pour for most of my rifle rounds since the auto-disk can't drop as much powder.

I have some questions...,12,0,22,http://www.reddit.com/r/reloading/comments/1hs1rr/just_finished_my_first_ever_batch_308_i_have_some/,"So I set up to reload some .308 for the first time for a precision long range setup.  I'm using a Lee Turret press with Lee pacesetter dies, assorted brass, winchester primers, Hodgdon Varget, and SMK 168gr HPBT bullets.  Overall it went pretty well.  I cleaned, sized and deprimed, trimmed, chamfered, deburred, measured loads, and seated the bullets.  For this run, I made 50, of various loads, but all at the same seating depth.  I should note that for seating, the OAL seemed to be accurate to within one or two thousandths of an inch.  My powder measurements were accurate to within 0.02 grains (overkill I know).  

There are a few issues I ran into I was hoping yall could help me with.

1) With almost 10% of my cases, I could not for the life of me get the primers out.  I would pull the lever all the way down, and it would press the primer down partially, but they just wouldn't come out.  Because they were now protruding from the bottom of the case, this made it impossible to remove the shell from the shellholder, so I would need to take it out, flip it over, and bash the primer back into the casing in order to get it off the shell holder.  I should note that in these cases, I also tried pushing the primer the rest of the way out manually, using a pin going through the case and a hammer, but to no avail.  They simply would not come out, and I had to discard these cases.  Whats going on here? How can I fix it?

2) While priming, around 5% of the primers would not seat properly, or fully, and even upon fully compressing the lever, the primers would protrude a tiny bit from the case (i should note that i probably didn't do they best job cleaning the primer pockets).  [Here is a picture](http://i.imgur.com/L7N7NBO.jpg).  Are these safe to shoot? How can I prevent this from happening?

3) When I got to some of the biggest powder charges, the powder wold fill a very significant proportion of the case.  So much so that I think this would effect bullet seating (I had to screw in the seating dial more in order to get it to sit at the same place as lighter loads).  Is this normal? Is it bad to have your bullet pressing down directly on the powder?  

4) Load development.  So For this bunch, I started at the recommended starting charge (42gr) and went up in 0.5gr increments. to the max (46gr).  I made 5 of each.  All were the same seating depth 2.8in OAL.  My plan is to take these to the range, see which set of 5 groups the best, and then on my second batch, I'll stick with the best charge, and vary the seating depth.  Does this sound like a good plan?  What range and what increment should I use when playing with the seating depth?

I managed to snag an 8 pound jug of Unique back in February (the only quantity that was available) and recently completed my 1,000th .45 reload using the powder. Maybe I'm doing something wrong, but the stuff is dirty. I mean real dirty. My hands are covered in powder residue after a hundred rounds at the range and my guns are filthy. So I'm asking, if it's me or the powder?

I lean towards the mid range for recommended loads and, except for the the dirty aspect I'm satisfied with the results. Is it the lower powder volume that is the cause? I'm going to kick my next batch up a notch to just below maximum to see if has any effect.

I'm using CCI primers and Berry's plated or Berry's hard cast boolits but the dirt and smoke have been consistent.

I got home and started digging and discovered I am now the proud owner of a lee loader hand loading kit. 

I figured out how to use it on old brass and mocked up a load by re-seating the  used primer and a pulled bullet I had kicking around. I still know nothing about reloading though, just how my equipment works. 

So here is my question: what kind of powder and how much for loading 150gr SP? Also a good not too expensive brand for bullets and primers? I'm trying to beat my usual price of $28 a box for federals. I have a bunch of brass around so all I need is the bullets primers and powder.

As suggested by ToxDoc I performed the ""plunk test"" with two barrels, one a match grade I was using in my Glock, another from my M&amp;P. I had some loads that seated fine in M&amp;P but not the match barrel and some that did not work in either. I have to say that this was an easier method than using calipers after the fact and writing down the variances which is what I had started doing. 

I think that my first mistake was with the Lee Loadmaster manual which stated that the press had been preset at the factory for .45 ACP and that no out of the box adjustments were necessary. Since my first run of 30 bullets fired fine I was lulled into a false sense of security on the die settings. Hindsight being 20-20 I should have made sure that the dies were screwed down tightly. So I'm chalking it down to the dies not being firmly seated and creeping. Please correct me or point me to another possibility if you disagree, I want to cover the possibilities so I don't make the same mistake.

I reset all of the dies and as suggested I made a few unprimed no powder rounds until I had and OAL (1.232) and a crimp that plunked nicely into the both barrels. I also ordered a sizing gauge as suggested.

This is also the stage where I also discovered ""Glock Bulge"" as mentioned by  redditor dammitmitchell. Some brass casings had the bottom bulge issue as described and no amount of resizing could address that lower case bulge issue. I've set those off to the side and ordered a Lee Bulge Buster since I own two Glocks.

As for load data, holy shit are there varying minimums and maximums depending on your sources! I originally used Lyman's recommended for a 200gr lead bullet since I couldn't find plated TMJ data. The Lee reloading manual and the Alliant powder recommendations also vary. Now I get why many of you suggested ""starting at the low end"" and working my way up since one sources minimum is damn close to another sources maximum.

Final thought:  What's your ""go to"" source for load data? I have Lyman's and Lee and the Alliant web source but it would be nice to have several!

I am getting into reloading, and have a .45 XD in 4"". Every talks about 3.5"" barrels or 5"" barrels.

Everyone says the 1911 5"" was built for 230 grains, and the 3.5"" work best with 185.

So by the logic, would my 4"" be ""most compatible"" with the 200 grain, or am I thinking about this all wrong?

Basically, I want to be reloading the most adaptable round I can to minimize all-around cost (because it is a .45, it is going to hurt no matter the grain or bullet design...right?) With my primary role being target shooting, but this is my carry gun (and only, for now).

Also while I am here -- lead or jacketed? My dad says my XD is ""tight"" -- I don't get what he means, it feels pretty slack to me, but he has shot like 50000 more guns than I have. He is worried if  Use lead that they may not feed correctly, or may deform while feeding causing barrel/accuracy issues down the road.

In fact, one of my 38spl cartridges squibbed (just barely didn't make it out of the barrel), which I was carefully testing for on each load just in case. None of the 9mm cartridges had enough power to properly cycle the action and eject the casing.

I noticed that for 38spl the online Hodgdon suggested load for a 140grn XTP bullet is substantially hotter in both seating depth and pressure than the Lyman load. They suggest 4.2grn's of 231 and a 1.455"" COAL. (Compared to 1.470"") The velocity of the Hodgdon starting load is _almost twice as fast_ in velocity than the Lyman bullet, in fact. Their Max Load is 200fps faster.

Is the Lyman manual data incredibly conservative as a general rule? It's not like there's a disparity in the pressures. The pressure in CUP of the Lyman data is listed as being lower than the Hodgdon data. I'm substantially more afraid of squibbing rounds than I am of overcharging, since I'm cautious by nature and don't plan on pushing a lot of limits.

1354424692.0,8,self.reloading,144zys,Always use your barrel as a maximum OAL gauge. Here's why.,11,3,16,http://www.reddit.com/r/reloading/comments/144zys/always_use_your_barrel_as_a_maximum_oal_gauge/,"This is probably something everyone knows that I have only just figured out since I'm new to reloading, but it was a moment of clarity so I figured I would share. 

There is a lot more to OAL than OAL. I reload for 9mm, and have been good about closely following published load data. I also have measued OAL on a bunch of tula 115gr (1.15-1.16 OAL on average) and a bunch of bulk federal 9mm 115gr (1.1475 OAL). Just because a manufacturer can get away with rounds on the longer side of things **does not mean that you can**.

When I first started reloading my only 9mm gun was an CZ SP-01 Tactical, most of my loads were ~1.14 OAL with 115gr Zero RN FMJ bullets, and I never had a single issue. Then I picked up a Rami BD, 3 of 10 reloads or so would ever so slightly prevent the slide from closing all the way and would require a little force to manually eject. This stumped me for a solid week or two since the OAL was within what I had deemed ""spec"".

Finally I took the barrel out of the Rami inserted a reload, and noticed it was binding and could not easily rotate in the chamber. From there I started seating the bullet slightly deeper until the round could freely rotate in the chamber. What I discovered is that the effective maximum OAL with Zero 115gr and the CZ Rami is 1.14. Anything a hair over that will bind. On the other hand, the SP-01 Tactical is good to go at ~1.14 and did fine with some 1.15 loads I was playing with as well.

**tl;dr;** Just because your OAL is within spec doesn't mean it's going to work. Different bullets have a different amount of taper. Less taper can effectively reduce the maximum OAL depending on your gun's chamber. Always check your reloads to make sure they drop in and out of the chamber freely.",,False,,t5_2rloq,1354424958.0,,,True,t3_144zys,http://www.reddit.com/r/reloading/comments/144zys/always_use_your_barrel_as_a_maximum_oal_gauge/,

I live in an apartment where I cannot do much for modifying the walls per the lease. It does however have a very nice (to me!) 1.25 or 1.5 stall garage.
I reload ammunition for shooting and I also needed a bench to tinker with things.
I built the bench with heavy duty hinges on the back and 4X4 legs that swing in and out as the table is lifted up and down. The table is held in the up position by a short length of 550 cord.
I built it this way for a variety of reasons. The 2X6 that is screwed to the wall can be taken down quickly and the entire package folds up for moving rather easily. The second reason I built it this way was because I could have it in the up position and fit my car and other stuff into the garage more easily, at least when the bench is not in use.
Frame was built out of 2X4's and the top of the bench was supposed to be all 2X6's. Well, I figured the amount of lumber incorrectly and had to use one strip of 2X4's and make do with what I had. Considering it won't have an engine block (well, perhaps a motorcycle engine..) on it, I'm not to concerned.

What did it in was my ""shake test"" afterwards.  I heard no powder movement.  I verified with some factory Hornady rounds also with XTPs and heard no power movement in there either so I'm fairly certain that I'm being overly paranoid.

I will start things  off
So far I have only tested one powder extensively for the .308.
Here is my best group at 150 yards http://imgur.com/KQlBr

*I was using a Savage Model 10 24""bbl with 1:10
*Load was 43 grs of AA2520
*(45 was max listing but I was getting signs of OP at 44)
*Brass Trimmed to 2.005
*OAL was 2.701
I just got a chrono and will have some results tonight.

As for Pistol I have used powders Win 231 and Bullseye with 9mm.
I can't tell a large difference comparing side by side with the same load out of 4.6grs.  But for me the Bullseye meters much better than the 231.  Also cheaper.  

I have about another 50 loads of the 2520 that I hope to test tonight between 500+ yards.  After that I have a pound of 4064 to experiment with.

I'm considering reloading as a hobby, and I'm starting by looking for a comprehensive reloading manual. You guys seem to like Lyman 49th ed., and I'm wondering if the manual is simple enough for a noob like myself. I almost picked up a copy of Hornady 8th ed., but I'm curious if it will limit the information to Hornady bullets, presses, etc. I know the internet has unlimited resources, but I've never been a fan of using a computer at a work bench and I want to have a good manual at my fingertips.


When it comes time for me to purchase reloading tools, I think I'll start with .45 acp since it's a straight case and the brass will last longer. That being said, how difficult would it be to learn on a necked case like the .223? I am also considered learning on 30-30, but I'd like to know if reloading rimmed cartridges is more challenging. Any advice you offer will be greatly appreciated.


EDIT 1: Picked up a copy of Lyman 49th, going to start reading through it tonight. As far as presses are concerned, I'm considering a Dillon RL 550. I know most of you guys recommend starting off with a single stage press, but I should be able to load one cartridge at a time until I get the swing of things.

I was wondering if anyone knew what kind of performance the Hornady 168 grain AMAX bullets had in large game (deer is what I have in mind).

I'm hoping to go hunting for the first time this year, and am hoping that I can use the same cartridge for target and hunting. Right now I'm getting sub MOA out of the AMAX in my Ruger American, so it would be very convenient if these bullets are ethical to use on larger game.

Thanks in advance.

EDIT: sounds like the general consensus is that it can work but you wouldn't recommend it, which is kind of what I figured. I guess I'll be on the hunt for a hunting bullet that I can get on a similar trajectory to the AMAX.

All were seated at .002 off the lands, 2.28"" Coal. rifle is a Howa 1500 bolt gun. Charges ranged from 24.8 to 27.0. Target was shot at 200 (ish) yards. I think the last 2 targets( 26.8 and 27.0)are the best but I am unsure. Also, at 27.0 (the best looking load of the day) I got a small amount of primer flattening. My rifle craters primers (a small amount) at any load, so I don't see that as an issue, but do you think the flattening is too bad? I couldn't find any data for the 52 gr pills but the data for 53 and 50 was near identical with 27.5 being max, so that's how I chose loads.

So, all in all:

1. Which target of the 5 looks the best in your opinion? ( the first 5 targets were bad, scattered, so I only posted the second 5)

2. Is a small amount of primer flattening (see pic 2) cause for worry? I do not have a chrono yet, in picking one up in the next month or so however.

I've got an AK74 and I'm concerned about availability of ammo with California's incoming ban on online orders, and I don't like shooting steel core because of the fire hazard. So I'm looking into reloading this cartridge instead of stocking up on crappy surplus. There is no 5.45 brass available, but I've heard that some people convert .222 to 5.45. I haven't found any comprehensive guides about doing this. Does anyone here do it? Is it as simple as trimming the case from 43mm to 39mm and running it through some 5.45 dies? What do you guys do?


**Long version:**

I've asked 6 different ranges/LGSs if they had 5.45x39 and, without fail, I was asked if I meant 5.56.

""No, the AK one.""

*""Oh, you mean 7.62?""*

""No, 5.45x39. The AK74 round. It comes in a big spam can of 1080 rounds."" [I meant what I said. I'm not stupid, come on.]

*""Ohhh I don't think we have that. Hey Joe, do we have any 5.45?""*

*""Oh yeah, I think we got a box.""*

Turns out it's Hornady Vmax and it's ~60c/rd. When I ask them if they ever get the spam cans with 1080 rounds, they tell me they wouldn't sell that much all at once anyway and would have to break it up so that there's enough for everyone. (This particular place was selling for $16/20 rds. I'm sure that nobody is buying your ammo for 80c/rd when they can [buy it all day for 18c/rd](http://www.usacsales.com/ammunition/545x39-ammo-can).) 

It's become abundantly clear to me that none of the shops around here stock this ammo with any semblance of reliability. With the incoming ban on online sales, I'm worried about it's availability. Sure, I can pay $50/yr for a permit to buy ammunition and special order some from a LGS, probably for an additional fee. Also shooting in socal where steel core is a major fire hazard, it'd be nice to shoot some lead bullets. 

Edit: thanks to sncstealth, I've learned that there IS brass cased 5.45-- Tula Brassmaxx. Of course, there's nothing available right now anyway. ",,False,,t5_2rloq,1372201815.0,,,True,t3_1gxdjl,http://www.reddit.com/r/reloading/comments/1gxdjl/anyone_convert_222_brass_to_545x39/,

They had to honor the $299.99 price tag they put on it.

I bought most of everything I need, except a bench to start reloading on, going out now, so tomorrow is going to be my first day reloading!

Here is a picture of my stuff: http://i.imgur.com/ieATdQt.jpg

I have been preparing to reload for several months now, purchasing equipment, reading, watching videos, more reading, etc... 

I have read through the FAQ and also purchased and am still reading The ABCs Of Reloading: The Definitive Guide for Novice to Expert. 

Despite my reading, I have not been able to find a reliable answer to this question. **Do you need to trim straight walled pistol cases?** 

I know the manuals have max length for cases but out of all of the videos that I have watched and friends that I have asked, none of them trim or even measure their pistol brass. To me, I would rather err on the side of caution. From my understanding, and improper length on the cartridge brass could potentially lead to head space problems because the cartridge would 1) either be too long and cause a jam or 2) be too short and potentially lead to a dangerous crack near the head of the case. (Please correct me if my understanding is wrong)

In any case, I noticed that the FAQ does not mention a suggestion for a case trimmer. So part 2 of my post is what is your experience with case trimmers? Do you have a favorite? If you were to list two, 1) your ideal, money isn't an problem, all the bells and whistles, and 2) the one that you would realistically buy, which would they be?

For me right now I have an RCBS Rock Chucker Master Supreme Single Stage Press Kit as suggested by the FAQ. I intend to learn with this press and then upgrade to the Horady LNL ammo plant in the future. What case trimmer would you suggest for me as a beginner?

For those who are not familiar it is a 5+1 capacity bolt action rifle chambered in 357 Magnum.  Also it can cycle, chamber and shoot 38 special.

My main two uses for this rifle are going to be recreational target practice out to maybe 100-150 yards with and without a scope.  second use as a brush gun in the thick woods of south western PA for white tale dear and coyote hunting where you are lucky if you can even see much past 50 yards.

I am lucky enough to have some bullets available that I have for my 38 special snub nose or that are already on their way from midwayusa. I have (150) 110 JHP gold dots (200) 140 grain lever revolution (300) 158 JHP and (500) 180 grain JHP.  I have around 700 cci small magnum pistol primers. I have over a 1,000 cci small pistol. I even have some cci small rifle primers but I have heard mixed things about using them in 357 magnum cases.  I have titegroup, Accurate number 2, Bullseye, Universal, Power Pistol, and Lil-gun powders at my disposal.  

My goal is to make a few different loads.  A target/plinking load in 38 special and 357 magnum that are safe for use in revolvers.  A couple 357 hunting loads and a load in 38 special for a close range "" put it out of its misery without destroying any meat "" round.

I have read that with the heavier bullets lil-gun is a good choice but I have also been warned that lil-gun can destroy barrels. In most cases they were referring to revolvers.  They said it caused flame cutting on the receiver and barrel erosion.  Would I have to worry about barrel erosion out of a rifle???  I really want to get some H110 or win 296 but with very limited availability and price gouging on gunbroker I am very hesitant to commit to $80 for 1 lb of H110 when I have a pound of lil gun sitting on the reloading bench.

I have some experience I have been reloading for almost a decade now with great success in 38 special 9mm, 9mm makarov, 45 acp and 308 win.

It was raining at the time, and the brass got wet. It was wet for a day or two while it slowly dried in front of the vent in my dining room. Consequently, quite a few of the shells got pretty green (oddly enough, my Winchester brass much more so than my Remington brass - some of those Winchester shells were almost completely covered). This is all once-fired brass (I just bought the brass new a couple weeks ago, immediately loaded it, shot it over the weekend, and it subsequently corroded). I sized/deprimed them all, scraping off some of the oxide, but the shells are pretty tarnished. I'll ultrasonically clean them tomorrow, but the tarnish won't be going anywhere. Should I be concerned about any real damage to the shells? I don't really care about aesthetics (I'm just plinking with this ammo, anyway) - brownish, non-shiny brass is fine with me. I'm thinking this is just a light layer of surface corrosion and only removed a minute amount of metal, plus this is a low-pressure round, so it's not a huge deal. Am I wrong?

In the same vein, because I ran the dirty brass through my sizing die already (and managed to remove quite a lot of the oxide by doing so), I can't fathom how gross the die is now.

The belts are in fairly good shape but about 3/4 of the rounds have visible rust under the rim and about half of those have visible pitting in the rust.

Needless to say, I will not be firing them. The bullets though, are all in very good condition, considering, and in the near future I will be pulling the bullets and disposing of the powder and cases. 

As I have yet to weigh any of the bullets I can only go on assumptions that they are 147gr, Boat Tailed, Full Metal Jacket, Lead Cored rounds. I have measured several just above the casing and they are all .308 +- .0005.

**Here is the question: Is this a suitable weight round to load into other .308 loaded cases? Specifically, 30/06 and .308 Winchester.**

My current assumptions is that yes, this is fine, and that any load data for a 150gr bullet would be adequate. I have noticed that the lighter bullets in these calibers require a larger charge so using the charge for the 150gr bullet behind a 147gr bullet would be a reduction from starting loads.

Any input or advice would be helpful and I thank you in advance.

I have 5 magazines. And I ran each magazine through twice with 10 rounds each to test my loads.  I haven't numbered my magazines but I definitely will to see if it's a magazine issue.

I'm thinking about jumping into reloading, and in the spirit of ""buy once, cry once"" I was thinking I should just jump in with a progressive press.  

From what I've read, reloading pistol ammo is pretty straight forward - but bottleneck ammo requires extra steps.  Since I'll be reloading 30-06, 308 and 223 I'm wondering how case trimming works in a progressive press.

If I understand what I'm reading, it's possible to setup a five stage progressive press so that you can run brass through to be de-primed, sized, and trimmed in one run.  Then you can reconfigure the press to do the priming, powder, seating and crimping in the next run through.  If I understand this, it means the only step that can't be done inside the press is the cleaning &amp; polishing and inspecting for errors.

So, is my understanding correct?  Is so, what die sets should I look at in order to make sure I can trim/size/charge/seat/crimp?

All 100 rounds went downrange without a single ammunition or weapon failure. No misfeeds, failure to fire, or explosions (which I was quite worried about, being new and all).

The batch was split in half, 50 of Hornady 200gr SWC and 50 Hornady 230gr FMJ-RN.

The SWC were loaded in batches of 10 progressing from 4.5 gr - 4.9 gr of Hodgdon's Titegroup.

The FMJ-RN were loaded in batches of 10 progressing from 4.2-4.4 and then 20 rds of 4.5.

On the FMJ I decided to stay a little lower on the charge as one person had pointed out that the Hornady digital scales have some variance problems when weighing. I erred on the side of caution for my first testing group.

Observations:

Holy shit are the unjacketed rounds dirty. There were giant clouds of powder flying from the barrel, noticeably more at the lighter end of the spectrum. It was quite smokier than I had anticipated. 

Primers also seemed flatter on the SWC. I attribute this to having to seat the round lower in order for the round to headspace properly and creating more pressure. I would pick up brass and check the primers after every batch, they never seemed dangerously flat, but flatter for sure, especially when compared to a piece of brass I had taken to the range for comparison. 

I also noticed that my primers have a nock in the dent from the firing pin, looks like a little nipple at top of the dent in the following picture:

http://i.imgur.com/hNXNH.jpg

What causes this? Is this abnormal?

Recoil was much easier to manage on all loads. I look forward to this if all my rounds keep this attribute, even as I move the charges closer to maximum.

The residue left inside the pistol made it incredibly dirty. I have some Winchester 231 which I plan on trying in my next batch to see if this will help. I've read that it burns much cleaner.

I also picked up some brass at the range and upon examination it has kind of a shearing effect on the edge of the head. This was not fired from my weapon, I was just curious what causes it. Is this a mark of a specific firearm, or an error on the part of a user?

http://i.imgur.com/wR8kd.jpg

And finally some of my not so fine handywork on the targets. I'm completely new to handguns and have only fired about 300 rounds so far, I've been happy with my progress, I get a little closer to the center and more consistent each time.

I'm using Hodgdons Titegroup powder, Winchester Brass, and .452 Hornady SWC Bullets. Everything was going fine until I went to do a plunk test, which admittedly I should have done with a test bullet before adding powder and so forth.


It was kind of a tight fit and the bullet didn't appear to seat completely. I went back to Remington 230 RN and it went in easily and is just slightly below flush. Pictured here:  http://i.imgur.com/TErEr.jpg


So I tried slowly compressing the bullet in hoping that it would seat properly. The minimum OAL given in Lee's Modern Reloading was 1.225. I stopped at 1.228 and the results are here:  http://i.imgur.com/m7TQv.jpg

As you can see it still is slightly above flush. This was achieved without any pushing, just letting the bullet fall in without pressure.


I had originally gone with seating the bullet groups at 1.250, close to the middle of min and max, and was suggested by a few loads I'd seen while browsing. Here is a picture of the round seated at 1.250: http://i.imgur.com/M95Dq.jpg

It sits much higher than the other two. My assumptions at this point are with the fact that the bullets are .452 and it's stopping at the throat before reaching the bore. I'm not sure if this is normal, or if when chambered the bullet will be forced to fit and create unsafe pressure.

My natural reaction is that it's abnormal but not entirely unsafe. I'm probably fretting about nothing, and while not optimal, it's not going to destroy my pistol. However, I'd like to improve my reloading ability and/or figure out what I'm doing wrong or how to correct this.

I figured even if I hate it, it was only $15.

I just ran some Unique through it as a test.

I have a Lyman 55 measure and it doesn't like Unique very much. It throws it with an accuracy of +/- .3 grains and sometimes worse.

I just ran about 30 test throws through the Lee measure and it was at most +/- .1 grain and usually spot on. I did not let the powder get low in the measure, so I don't know if it will change when there is less powder, but I might just make a baffle for it anyway.

The other thing I found interesting was that the Lee measure is graduated in cubic centimeters (and the instructions are funny about it, they apologize for using the metric system and such) and comes with a conversion chart for a bunch of powders. The chart said that 1 grain of Unique was equal to .1092 cc. So I multiplied my 5.5 grain charge by .1092 and got .6006 cc. I set the measure to .600 cc and was within .1 grain!

I think I like this measure. Like a lot of Lee products, it looks a little cheap, and it's not expensive, but it just works.

Edited to add: FYI, The Lyman 55 is spot on with some other powders I use, Trailboss and Win 231 for example, and I think it's a good measure.

The long:

My initial solution is obviously a stronger recoil spring. However, no one makes one for the compact. I could modify a full length one, but I run into additional problems there.

Need a little insight - went out to shoot my first 223 reloads this afternoon. Everything went great and the ammo is definitely more accurate than the Wolf I'm accustomed to. However, upon my return home, I noticed something a bit unsettling about my fired brass...

Hopefully [these photos](http://imgur.com/a/wJBw8) demonstrate what is a clear bulge just above the case head, that goes for up for a half inch or so. The pics with 4 cases go from left to right - my reload, 2 of my fired reloads w/bulge, a random fired case from the desert - also a few shots of the individual bulged rounds.

I'm confused as I started towards the bottom of the Hornady manual - 21.6 gr H335 w/ 55gr vmax - so I don't think its an over-pressure issue. My first thought was maybe this was a characteristic of my use of LC rounds but it also happened on 223 stamped (PMC, Rem) brass. My next thought is perhaps I am over-crimping?

That leaves the gun (which presents a whole set of new questions I'm dealing with), AR15. Is the bulge any indication my barrel is not the RRA 223/5.56 I was sold? I'm working to validate what the barrel is as upon removing the handguard there are NO manufacturer stamps as I would expect to see. Or, is this just the nature of the AR with its ""loose"" tolerances?

I set out to load a 9mm round with a lot of flash using Blue Dot and Berry's 115gr RNDS plated bullets. I started with Alliant's max load data, backed it off  20% (8.6gr @ 1.130"" for a 115gr GDHP is their max) and made 10 sets of 5 rounds, ranging from 6.8 gr to 8.1gr

The load with the most flash was found to be 7.7 grains of Blue Dot at 1.135"". The video description explains the last 5 rounds are this load. Running it all the way out to 8.1gr obviously increased the recoil, but seemed to diminish the flash. I assume the pressure was beginning to increase, and causing a more efficient burn.

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FDBduQSqn84 - 7.7gr was found to be the best load, and the one I will move forward with. It is the last 5 shots in the string.

I don't believe I am seeing pressure signs. These are the cases I recovered:

Sets 1-5. The sets are ordered in rows, with 6.8 being at the very top, 7.0 being below it. For ref, (6.8, 7.0, 7.2, 7.4, 7.6)gr

A couple weeks ago, [I got my start](http://www.reddit.com/r/reloading/comments/ktttd/loaded_my_first_100_rounds_today/) and am really enjoying reloading.

I've only had a few problems, most of which are minor.  I've been able to figure them all out, [with the help of you wonderful folks](http://www.reddit.com/r/reloading/comments/l0lra/chambering_problem_with_a_batch_of_reloads/).

I've kept very detailed records of each batch, including basic info like bullet, case, primer, powder, overall length, weight, time to perform task, etc.  I've also kept a log of all mistakes: split cases, dimpled primers, etc.  Lastly I've kept a log of problems at the range, and made sure I could equate it to the specific batch.  This has been invaluable in rectifying problems.

My most common problem was crap getting in my primer seating system, and slightly dimpling the primer.  It freaked me out, and I ended up tossing 25 or so primed cases, just to be sure.  Later I fired a few and they worked fine.  I'm still very leery of them though.

The only persistent problem I've had has been that sometimes my bullets don't seat consistently.  I'd say 1 in 15 bullets doesn't seat far enough (.05 shallow), and I have to put it aside and later re-seat it slightly deeper.  Someone suggested that it may be an inconsistency with the Barry's bullets I'm using, and it may be.  I haven't actually pulled a cartridge apart to find out.

The scariest problem I had came from a single round, that I'm assuming didn't get a powder charge.  The primer detonated but the action didn't cycle completely.  I was speed shooting and mistook the problem for a FTE, so I cleared it and tried to shoot again.  However, the action wasn't closed.  Again, I mistook it for an improperly sized round and tried to slam the receiver shut.  It wouldn't.   I emptied the gun, opened the action and looked down the barrel.  No light...

As you've probably figured out, [I had a bullet stuck in the barrel](http://i.imgur.com/9XTJX.jpg).  Luckily it caused the next cartridge to not chamber, otherwise I would have had a [really bad day](http://www.reddit.com/r/reloading/comments/ldlfq/my_kaboom/).  I've heard it referred to as a squib, Wikipedia has a [completely different definition though](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Squib_%28explosive%29).

I think it happened due to the way I loaded those rounds.  I tried to load all the cases in the batch by leaving them in the tray and loading them in rows.  When I checked the rounds to make sure they got a charge, I suspect I looked right over a case and missed it.  I now hand charge each case, check to see if its powdered, then put a bullet on it.

I'm nearly out of powder, so I'm going to use the last of it up and try something else, because the Unique powder I'm using has really high pressure, but isn't reaching the velocity I need.

They perform acceptably, but I'm obsessive enough that I won't be happy unless I'm using the optimum setup. I had been wondering how to make the loads less smoky and dirty.

One thing I heard multiple times was ""are you using a Lee Factory Crimp Die?"" As we all know (or should know), cast lead bullets are typically sized a thousandth of an inch larger than jacketed bullets to create a better seal in the bore. I was told that running the round through the FCD will compress the bullet until it's undersized for the bore, which leads to more leading, more smoke, etc.

I tried loading up 50 rounds without the FCD, crimping with the seating die. I didn't test them side by side but I *think* I noticed less smoke while shooting, and the leading after shooting was definitely less work to clean out than usual.

Opinions on this differ, but based on preliminary testing I'm no longer using a FCD with cast bullets. Even if I'm totally imagining the benefits, it's at least one fewer step that I have to go through when I'm reloading.

The only other thing to try now is a slower-burning powder, which will come after I work through this 4lb jug of Bullseye that I have.

Rifle of course is a different story. Anyways I came across these on one of my last range trips. About 155 in total, every single one looks like it was pressed against a belt sander, primers flattened against the back of the shell. There are also some heavy extractor marks on the rim. Other than that though you can hardly tell once the brass has been re-sized and deprimed.

I have decided that I am going to start reloading. By that I mean I am about to start. I have been lurking around here for a little while and have been watching YouTube videos and reading as many reloading articles as I can. I understand everyone says to start with a single stage press so you can become well aware and understand every step and how it relates to the reloading process as a whole.

**Equipment:**  
  
* Single Stage Press  
  
* Powder Measure  
  
* Scale  
  
* Dies  
  
* Caliper  
  
* Priming System  
  
* Embedded Bullet Puller  
  
* Reloading Data  
  
* Tumbler  
  
* Separator  
  
* Case Trimmer  
  
* Case blocks  

**Components:**  
  
* Brass
    
* Projectile/Bullet  
  
* Dies  
  
* Powder:  
  
* Primers:  
  
* Tumble Media 
   
* Case Lube  
  

 
**Purchased so far:** 
   
*  Scale: Hornady Digital Scale (Model: GS-1500)  
  
*  Reloading Data: Hornady Handbook of Cartridge Reloading 9th Edition  
  
*  Dies: Hornady 300 Whisper/AAC  
  
*  Powder: IMR 4227 - 300 Blackout  
  
*  Brass: Few Remington .45 ACP brass from my last range visit, Was going to give to a friend but never did, Maybe 20-25 cases  
  
*  Projectiles/Bullets: Remington 45 ACP JHP (190 Grain IIRC)  
  
* CCI #400 Small Rifle Primers (1000 Count)  
  
**Purchased 08-09-2013**  
   
* Dillon Precision Super Swage 600  
   
**Purchased 08/17/2013**  
  
* Frankford Arsenal Impact Bullet Hammer

* Lyman Powder Trickler  
  
* 2x Frankford Arsenal 223 Flip-top Ammo Case  
  
* Lee:Modern Reloading 2nd Edition  
  
**My questions are as follows:**  
  
* Is there one Single Stage Press that is hands sown better than all other? By asking this I wish for the answer to be honest and backed with fact.  
  
* Is there one go to set for you guys? Is this personal preference? How many do you guys reference? Are the projectiles referenced in the Hornady reloading data all Hornady products and Sierra data all Sierra projectiles?  
  

* Primer, Are all Small Pistol, Large Pistol, Magnum Pistol, Small Rifle and Large Rifle primers pretty comparable? CCI,Winchester &amp; Remington  
  
  
**Additional Information**    
  
  
* I am thinking about purchasing a Lee 50th Anniversary press kit, which comes with the Press, Powder Measure, Scale and Priming System.  
  
* As I said I already own the Hornady Reloading Data and am thinking about getting the Lee Modern Reloading Vol 2 as well. Then my Local Cableas has quite a few projectile manufactures reloading data books readily available.  
  
* As of right now I have no plans on experimenting with different components and am going to follow the published data pretty much to the T.  
  
* I will eventually move to a Hornady LNL Auto Indexing Progressive Press. But I want to start with the Single Stage.

I have some powder that'll work, and standard (not magnum) primers.  My reloading manuals have data for up to 165 gn bullets for my powder, which are on the light side for 300 H&amp;H, but they're also easier to find in stock right now.

One question is about the dies, whether to get neck size or full-length size.  I've read conflicting things online, and I know the 300 H&amp;H is one of the only belted magnums to actually headspace off the belt, not the shoulders.  I'm sorta leaning toward neck sizing since it'll work the brass less and these will only ever be fired out of this one rifle, but maybe full length is the way to go?  I do want to make this brass last if possible.  You can still buy new empty brass but it's super expensive.

The ones he gave me probably date to the 1960s, so around 50 years old.  The loose cases have been wrapped in a plastic bag, in a cardboard box, in an outbuilding for probably at least 30 years.  They actually look quite solid, but they're pretty dark, dirty, and have some discoloration or possible spots of corrosion.

I found a ""good"" deal ($0.12/rd) on .223 brass the other day, so I bought 500 rounds.  I resized and deprimed, trimmed and started to prime (by hand) when everything came to a halt.  About 70% of this brass is Lake City or other military 5.56mm with crimp over the primer.  For ~300 of the brass, I reamed and chamfered the primer pocket by hand and managed to prime them all.  Now, I am faced with 200 left and would like to hear your best way to remove military crimp.  Most of the products on-line get poor reviews and are similar to the reamer/swager primer pocket tools that I have.  Also, what do you reloaders with progressive presses do with once fired, crimped, military brass?  Do you have to prep brass first like I am doing, then feed to the press, or are there better ways?

General disclaimer that comes along with reloading: Reloading is obviously hazardous as we are dealing with flammable components, as well as toxic components such as lead, I am not responsible for any harm that may come to yourself as this is purely informational for those starting out!


Retail slugs and buckshot run anywhere from 0.60 to 2.00 per round these prices fluctuated based on many factors such as payload/brand/home defense vs target vs hunting, the list goes on. A home reloader can cast and reload their own slugs and buckshot for significantly cheaper (won't quote a price since component pricing is different depending on where you live!). I can personally keep my costs beneath 0.30 per round and it possible to go much lower.


So what do you need to start feeding your hungry deprived shotgun? I suggest casting your own slugs and buckshot if you have the time as that is where you really see the savings. Hornady 00 Buckshot runs about 25 dollars for 5lbs online or locally for me (when in stock). I source my lead that has been cleaned and molded into ingots from the Cast Boolits forum. There are other options for lead but I prefer this route as this lead is clean and ready to go into the pot and then made into whatever is on the menu for the day. Average price of lead from forums that I have seen range from 1.00 to 1.80 per pound shipped.


**Casting** – If you plan to cast more than slugs and buckshot pick up a casting manual!

For casting you need the following: casting pot, mold, protection, mallet and of course some lead!

* Casting pots -  These come in many different styles and sizes. Some pots can hold four pounds whereas others can hold up to twenty! For slugs and buckshot I suggest going with a large volume pot as it requires quite a bit of metal for each casting.

* Molds – Once again, many different kinds for many different purposes, ask yourself what you want the slugs and/or buckshot for? Target practice? Hunting? Select your molds based on this questions answer. Due to the current market molds are a bit hard to locate, many of the most popular Lee molds are going for a pretty penny on ebay and other sites.

* Protection – You're dealing with molten lead that is known to be toxic and cause health complications if handled improperly. Be smart and use protection! Gloves, long sleeves, pants, closed toe shoes, safety shield mask, even can wear an apron if you wanna go crazy.


**Reloading**

For reloading you will need a press and components! 

* Single stage presses are affordable and offer a good platform to learn the steps of reloading and the importance of quality control before you upgrade to a progressive. Check out various online retailers for different types of presses available at the various price ranges.

* Components – You will need other components besides your cast slugs or buckshot! Hulls, wads, powder and primers. I won't go into much detail as these should be found based on a published load from a RELOADING MANUAL. Get one, use it, love it. Using published data is better than missing some fingers. Also due to current crazy market, many components may be difficult to obtain or still remain at retard prices.

With the above you should be able to assemble your own shells for that hungry shotgun that you have neglected due to current ammo prices!

I figured I would ask this question here because I think you all would know the answer to this better than /r/guns . 

I have some Federal Premium 40 S&amp;W 135 grain hydra-shok JHP personal defense rounds that I was loading into my Springfield XDM. The magazine holds 16 rounds and it comes with a loading tool to help push the rounds down into the magazine. I usually get some considerable resistance when I get close to the 16th round. I decided to empty the magazine and check the rounds and found these:

As you can see there is a sizable dent in the casing. I have noticed this on all of the cartridges that I have used the loading tool. I believe that it is caused by the actual tool pressing on the casing of the cartridge. I believe these cases are brass, however, they are silver in color as opposed to the typical goldish color.

I have other rounds that I have loaded in the the magazine and they are not as deformed as these.

My question: Are these still OK to fire?

It was very satisfying and everything was safe but I seem to be having some sort of issue with primers. About one round in six wouldn't go off on the first hammer strike through my S&amp;W 29-2 44mag. If I cycled through the cylinder a second time the round that was a dud the first time usually would go off. As the gun has never done this with factory ammo ever before I'm thinking one of the following happened:

1) I got bad primers
2) The hammer strike is just not strong enough for some unusually tough primers
3) I did something wrong

As it was my first time reloading I think the highest probability is number 3 and have heard that primers that aren't full seated can do this. I used the Lee Auto Prime XR for priming and all my primers look and feel seated either flush or just barely beyond flush - basically just like my factory 44mag rounds. Is there a way I can tell if this is the issue? If so, is there a way to fix the problem with the other 50 rounds I have primed but not charged or with a seated bullet? Is this a recurring issue for all handloaders? I really want to figure out what's going on as I am not nearly confident enough now to reload anything for hunting or self defense applications. They must go bang when I pull the trigger in those types of situations.

1358740239.0,7,self.reloading,16yvzi,For those with a Lee Safety Scale thinking about upgrading....here is a comparison to the RCBS 5-0-5.,11,4,8,http://www.reddit.com/r/reloading/comments/16yvzi/for_those_with_a_lee_safety_scale_thinking_about/,"I've been loading 9mm for a few months now, and have been using my Lee Safety Scale to confirm charge weights thrown by my Autodisk Pro (which is great for pistol loading). I've known the scale is supposed to be pretty hard/annoying to use, but I didn't have anything else to compare it to until now, and just had not given it much thought.

In preparation for loading precision .223, I decided I should probably grab a better beam scale since I will be throwing and measuring every charge by hand (I don't trust the reasonably priced digital scales, they have too much variance). I stumbled across a lightly used RCBS 5-0-5 ($85-$110) on armslist for $75 tonight and picked it up a few hours ago.


**Comparison**

* **Course Adjustment**: The ball bearing the Lee uses for course adjustments is pretty comparable to the RCBS. They differ a little, but both work well and won't give you problems (but the RCBS can measure 5x more weight than the Lee).

* **Fine Adjustment**: The Lee uses a piece of plastic with windows cut in it that line up with hash marks on the beam in certain positions for its fine measurements. It is extremely annoying to adjust and it takes a lot of playing with to get it to go where you want. On top of that, unless you are looking straight at it, your measurements can easily vary +/-0.1gr. If you have fat fingers or your hands are not steady, forget about using it. On the other hand, the RCBS uses two metal pieces that simply fit in to notches on the beam. There is no guesswork about what the exact measurement is, and setting the scale for a certain weight is straightforward and easy. Also, if you look at the Lee fine adjustment piece the wrong way it will move, potentially throwing off your measurements. The RCBS does not have this problem, as the adjustment pieces fit in to physical notches in the beam.

* **Powder Pan**: The lee has a single powder pan that hooks directly on to the beam. Taking the pan on and off can throw off zero (usual doesn't), and I can't see it being easy to use with a powder trickler. The RCBS uses a powder pan and a powder pan holder. The holder hooks on to the beam and the pan fits in to the holder. Taking the pan on and off does not seem to throw off zero, and there is a lot more offset between the beam and the pan, which will make it a lot easier to use with a trickler.

* **Zeroing**: Zeroing the Lee scale involves putting all the weight adjustments in the zero position (which is annoying in the case of the fine adjustment piece) and turning a threaded weight in the middle of the beam in the necessary direction until things are zeroed. One side of the bolt this weight is mounted on has a spring on it, so the weight may not stay in the exact position you leave it in. Zeroing the RCBS is easy; just put all the adjustments in the 0 position notches, and then screw the left foot of the scale base in or out until it's zeroed. I was always concerned that my zero varied a little with the lee (probably by only 0.05gr); this is no longer an issue with the RCBS scale.

* **Beam Balancing**: The beam on the Lee scale takes **forever** to balance out after you nudge an adjustment, breathe on it, etc... It is infuriating how long it takes. The RCBS literally takes about 1 second to balance out from the max or min position. When I realized how much easier it was to use than the Lee, I decided the Lee was getting given away along with lots of warnings, simply because I can't bring myself to charge anyone for it.

___

**tl;dr**: FUCK YOU LEE. I cant believe they are selling this piece of shit to people at **any** price. They should be paying customers to get rid of their inventory and then stop making them. If you have a Lee safety scale go ahead and melt, shoot, smash, or otherwise destroy that piece of shit immediately. The RCBS is fantastic, but the real moral of this story is that while some Lee products are awesome, **stay the hell away from their scale**.",,False,,t5_2rloq,1358740857.0,,,True,t3_16yvzi,http://www.reddit.com/r/reloading/comments/16yvzi/for_those_with_a_lee_safety_scale_thinking_about/,

Am I missing something or is this just to be expected with fine powders?  I still love the machine, because it tosses Varget and TB spot on every time, but I worry it might be an issue as I move my charge weight up.  Any insight is appreciated.

Has anybody here used TulAmmo primers in their Lee Pro 1000 press?  My local gun store is having trouble keeping stocked up on primers, and the last time I went all they had was TulAmmo.  In the past I've used some CCI but mostly Federal, without issue.  This last reloading session, I ran out of Federal primers midway through and so replaced them with the new TulAmmo primers.  The second I actually started loading cartridges with the new primers, I began experiencing issues.

These primers just plain don't want to go into the case right.  Some were smashed while many were put in sideways.  Even on the ones that went in correctly, I noticed that it required more force on the lever to get them to seat fully.  It's almost as if these primers are just slightly larger than regular small pistol primers and so have to be forced a little bit in order to fit into the primer pockets.

Does anybody have any experience with this?  I don't know what to do about it, but I have about 900 primers left.  I don't want to throw them out, but I don't really want to continue experiencing all of these problems, either.  And before anyone asks, they are definitely small pistol primers, not large pistol primers.

As a side note, I am not looking to spend much more for a reloading kit unless the Lee is really terrible.

I will mainly be reloading .45acp at the moment, and plan to buy a target style rifle in the future for some ""Precision Shooting"". So those would be the 2 calibers that I would load.

I already have a few hundred brass from factory ammo that I'd love to try the reloading thing with.

Question is: Do I just go for the progressive right away? Or do I buy the single stage and use that for a while?

I love to shoot the .45 and it's my only pistol at the moment.

Additional info:
I'm into trap shooting, but not going to bother reloading 12ga. (I don't feel it's worth the time, imo).
Guns I own: 
Remington 870, Norinco SKS, Sig Sauer P220 Elite, Remington 597, Savage 93R17TR.

Mainly shoot Skeet/Trap and .45acp.
