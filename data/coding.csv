1289200125.0,365,self.coding,e2tj0,Hey Progreddit!  Do you have the want to give back to open source projects but are too lazy/busy/don’t have the skills?  Read on!,470,105,112,http://www.reddit.com/r/coding/comments/e2tj0/hey_progreddit_do_you_have_the_want_to_give_back/,"While conjuring up ideas for #sitenite, mAritz had a fantastic idea.  

One night a month, a group of us progredditors would get together and raid an OSS project and fix bugs/provide documentation/add requested features.  The raids would be setup beforehand and even people without the technical skills required could participate by providing documentation and other things of the sort.

So, what do you think progreddit?  Would anyone be interested?

Edit: some answers to common questions

- It may turn into a few day event rather than a one night event, at minimum, it would be a 24 hour window
- We'll most likely try and hit low hanging fruit first
- Patches would be compiled and submitted together as a tar to the maintainer so they don't have to deal with a million e-mails from all of us (up to the maintainer, just want to make it easy on them)
- We would organize on IRC beforehand and during the raid

1336158788.0,232,self.coding,t79zw,"Am I a dinosaur, or is my new company writing bad code? (C++)",286,54,117,http://www.reddit.com/r/coding/comments/t79zw/am_i_a_dinosaur_or_is_my_new_company_writing_bad/,"I'm a veteran programmer, and I like to stay up to date. I just started a new job, and their newly written code base makes me want to tear my hair out. Could you C++ guys give me your opinions on these issues, and mention your professional experience for context?

Am I being a dinosaur complaining about these things? I really need to know! The explanation for every item is ""unit tests"" or ""shortens build time"".

* Project is about 6 man-years of code, but has hundreds of individual project files. Maybe 40% of them are unit test targets, and most of the rest are DLL targets. These DLLs are all required to even start the application. Files in these projects are carefully sorted into directories so that there are rarely more than 6 files in any given directory. One project would typically have 3-4 subdirectories. Whenever I need to move files to another project (as happens when making changes), I have to very carefully move it in projects and source control, in the project files, update DLL exports, update #include paths for other projects, and update linker dependencies. Is this the new normal??
* Every member function is virtual. Many classes derive from an ABC, and are referred to via ABC pointers, exclusively for unit testing. There are only two classes who derive from these ABCs, the mock and the real class. These ABC pointers are passed in constructors, rather than trivially created because ""unit tests"". I can't inspect these ABC pointers in the debugger, sometimes not even with casting magic. My coworkers rely entirely on unit tests rather than debugging. Is this normal?
* Most classes have pImpl implementations. Even the ABC derived classes have pImpl. It only doubles the amount of code for trivial classes. Is everyone doing this now?
* We strictly adhere to 1 class per file. Even small, closely bound classes are separated into different files, and often different directories or even DLLs. I've been told to break up 200 line CPP files. Should I expect this everywhere?
* Classes are only referred to via boost::shared_ptr. We never use weak pointers or raw pointers, only shared pointers. That's fine, except that there's no clear ownership of objects. Classes which might rationally own these objects don't even store pointers to them, and they end up de-facto owned by some unexpected classes, often with circular shared_ptr ownership. So long as we don't care about closing every handle and deleting every object, this kind of works because we use:
* Signals. We use a lot of boost::signals. With boost signals I can't see who has signed up for a signal in my debugger. I don't see it by inspecting the object, and the emit site is about 20 stack levels away from the slot (really!). The only way to find listeners is to search my code for registrations. Is this common in the industry?

My main complaint is that none of my tools can grok this code. Doxygen generates worthless output because it can't follow the connections. My debugger can't show me program state. This code was written for unit tests and that's the only tool that works. My coworkers believe in this (they wrote it!) and I can't convince them otherwise (I tried!). So give me some advice.

Am I a dinosaur who needs to adapt, or are my coworkers drinking the unit test koolaid?

Programming, programming tools, paradigms, languages, operating system development, hardware programming, style, coding process;

The following subjects would be off-limits:

So I got my BS in CS. Loved it. I loved doing the programming assignments. The classes were interesting. I did a co-op somewhere in there, and eventually hated it, but I figured it would be better somewhere else. Everything was peachy. I thought I was dead-on for career fulfillment and satisfaction. I graduated in 2008. Summa cum laude.

For a variety of reasons, I decided to stay for two more years. Got my MS in 2010. 3.9 GPA.

I struggled to find a job, but after 5 months I was hired for an entry level position with a Fortune 500 banking software company. They had me using VB.NET, javascript, and SQL. Not what I had imagined I would be doing, but I thought ""Hey, I'll take it!""

I stayed for 8.5 months, after which I quit due to anxiety attacks and an overwhelming feeling of incompetence.

I've been delivering pizza and newspapers for the last 8 months, and I can't help but to feel that I've...
 - made a huge mistake
 - screwed up my life
 - wasted 7 years of my life and my one opportunity to get ahead

--

Despite how much I've thought about it, I can't think of anything else I want to do... nothing at all appeals to me besides this. But on the flipside, just _thinking_ about opening an IDE and programming starts to give me anxiety, depression, and a feeling of fight-or-flight (mostly flight). Even on personal projects...

I used to get excited about programming assignments (in school), and enjoyed working on them, and I made excellent grades. But now the thought of programming is terrifying...

What can I do?

---

tl;dr - Used to love programming, now get major anxiety just thinking about it, afraid to get another programming job. What can I do?

---

Edit:  
Wow, thanks for the tremendous response folks. There is a lot to think about in these replies. A common suggestion was therapy, and I did see a counselor once, before I quit the banking job. Mostly that session gave me the confidence to move on from that position, as I think it was poisonous for me.

I guess I can explain a bit about the banking position. It was software that banks would use internally, for nearly anything you could think a bank might need. Checking/Savings/Loans/Deposits all that stuff. The thing I think that triggered the anxiety was a bit the environment, but mostly a lack of... of... guidance? They had hundreds (maybe thousands?) of programs named along the lines of ABC1500 all in a sourcesafe database located a thousand miles away (takes forever to check in/out anything), and then I would get assignments which asked me to make changes to these programs. These programs (and the in-house libraries used to build them) generally had very little or no documentation (external or in code comments). But what got me was that I felt I was expected to just know where to go and how to fix these unknown programs from sometimes very brief descriptions (20-50 words). I often found myself pulling my hair out at my cubicle because, for the umpteenth time, I had no idea how to find and fix what I was asked to do. Maybe that's just the way real world programming is... a trawl through uncharted code swamps. It was also frustrating because it sometimes seemed that the most obtuse ways of getting things done were used.

I originally got into programming because, since I was fairly young, I knew, unequivocally, that I wanted to make video games. And then everything seemed doubly reaffirmed when my CS courses were such a blast...

I think another aspect is just fear... fear that... I don't know... I'll hit some roadblock, that I won't finish what I start... that I'll create an indomitable bug...

And now that I've been out for 8 months doing pizza and papers... who is gonna hire me? And they all ask for 3-5 years of experience in ABC, XYZ, QZP, etc, etc, ad nauseum... which I sure I could learn, but have no knowledge of currently.

Also... I live in Alabama... there's not much here job-wise, and what there is, is just like this, from what I can tell. Between the mortgage, my wife, her (good) job, and our nearby family, moving doesn't seem to be much of an option.

Even thinking about personal projects like games give me the knee-jerk fear/anxiety reaction...

Anyway... &lt;/whine&gt; 

Thanks again for the awesome feedback... I'll keep mulling them over, and maybe the additional details above will help to hone further feedback.",,False,,t5_2rb2y,True,,,True,t3_o7xrz,http://www.reddit.com/r/coding/comments/o7xrz/learning_to_love_programming_again/,

We've now been a community for over 6 months (according to Reddit). Can you believe it? Looking back over what we've done over this time period amazes me quite a bit. 

While we haven't had an immense number of articles, the quality has been absolutely phenomenal. Almost every single one has something interesting to say. Have you seen anymore, ""lol facebook privacy"" posts like you do on /r/programming? How about programmer jokes? Nope! We've kept true to what we wanted to do, and I feel our moderators have done a great job in helping that.

We do get a far larger number of posts coming in than we allow through our filter. While I know some people may disagree with what we allow through, I feel we've done our best to make sure that: 1) content is relevent, 2) self posts are avoided, and 3) reposts directly from /r/programming at the same time they are frontpaged are discouraged. The new ""Message Moderators"" feature has come in handy and several of you have made excellent use of it when something gets caught in the filter, so please continue to do so. And those of you reporting links? Please continue to do so as well! It's incredibly valuable to us.

While all this has been great, I would like to ask for help. We've had a few time periods where we've gone without any new content for up to a week at a time (depressing, right?), so I would just ask that all the readers here keep scavenging their favorite programming blogs and sites and dredging up new, quality content and posting it here! We'll reward you with **plenty** of karma if the content is good (well, the community will reward you!)

So please, keep up the great work, but let's step it up a bit!

As you can see, we've had a pretty low submission volume lately, but that's really always been the case. And that's quite alright! Because you should all take a few minutes to browse through the pages of our content sometime; you'll see just how amazing the content we've acquired is. Literally, I don't think I've ever seen a better-looking subreddit in terms of submission quality. With that, to business!

Our goals are the same as they've always been: avoid crappy content about the general field of programming, and get great content about real coding!

So what we need from you:
- More posts! Keep at it, finding that great content, even it's available on other subreddits (but don't overdo it there)
- Suggestions! What would you like to see change? Should we start allowing self-posts for discussion? Have our moderators been asleep? Do you think you'd moderate better than us and want to join in?
- More good commentary! Typically those redditors interested in this subreddit have some of the best intellectual discussions around. Don't forget to comment early and comment often.
- More upboats! While it's nice to see our stuff hit your individual frontpages, be sure to cruise through our new/upcoming tab to see more good material. Report things you think don't belong, and upvote the stuff you like. We like participation, and with 16,000 users now, I think we can do better.

I don't necessarily think these should have been formal topics, but they should have been built into the curriculum. For example, the beginning programming course could use a repository as the mechanism for turning in your coding homework. The last revision before the due date would be the version graded. A later course with larger projects could require a test suite as part of a grade.

I don't know python or image processing very well, so suggestions or criticisms are welcome.

[Here](http://img101.imageshack.us/img101/9351/animatedfull.gif) is an animation I made of the script walking through the maze. UPDATED: 155kB GIF link provided by [PING](http://www.reddit.com/r/programming/comments/a0x8g/hey_reddit_check_out_this_python_maze_solver_i/c0fc6m1), much much smaller than my original 10MB GIF. Thanks PING!

[Here](http://pastebin.com/f5deda543) is a pastebin of the code.

There are some options at the top. Verbose turns on debugging output of what the script is doing, and slows things waaay down. frameperiod and cleanupFramePeriod define how many frames to skip between outputting an image (total run with maze4 from above is almost 50,000 frames, don't try running it with a frame period of 1), where cleanupFramePeriod takes effect after the script has found the end point and is now just collapsing the call stack. outlimit stops the execution after a certain number of frames.

A frame is one call to move\_wavefront, which fills in a rectangle given a white-blocked edged until it reaches a black block. Then it finds more edges, and calls move\_wavefront again, until it can find 0 edges, or it finds the red end point.

Script requires ""maze4.png"" from the first link above to be in the same directory as it is when run. With a long frame period like 1000 and verbose=False, it should finish in under a minute. The console and image output is the bulk of the execution time, so if it takes too long, just turn up the frame period.

It is obviously not very general, and could use some cleaning up. Any suggestions for additional maze sources to run it against?

EDIT: escaped underscores for great justice

EDIT 2: Dependencies are the [Python Imaging Library](http://www.pythonware.com/products/pil/)

EDIT 3: Removed my address from linked pastebin

EDIT 4: Wikipedia has [this](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maze_solving_algorithm) to say about maze solving algorithms. I can't easily classify what I'm using into those algorithms, though. I made it up as a problem solving exercise. Any algorithms experts out here who can relate what I'm doing to a ""real"" CS algorithm?

EDIT 5: Significant code improvements. The script now takes arguments and options on the command line, so editing the script to run it is no longer necessary. It has worked on an additional maze from [hypnomania](http://www.reddit.com/r/programming/comments/a0x8g/hey_reddit_check_out_this_python_maze_solver_i/c0fezmb) but the file size of that maze is huge, and I don't have a GIF optimizer yet, so I'm not posting the animation.

Feel free to rip me a new one if I ignorantly break any of these unspoken codes of etiquette. I didn't see anything like this as I was searching through this subreddit, so I thought I would ask:

I'm a CompSci major taking a class about massively parallel programming on CUDA cards, and over the course of this class we've seen a lot of really smart people talk about the current state of parallel software. Apparently, the capability of our hardware currently far surpasses the abilities of our software because of how difficult it is to handle multicore programming, specifically at the systems/OS level.

One of the common opinions I've heard is that this is the result of not having a language built from the ground up with parallelism in mind. Don't get me wrong, I love C, but it feels like whenever the new thing comes out in the world of computing, there is an extension to C or C++ that almost gets these languages to where they need to be.

What I am basically getting at, is that you should use the right tool for the right job. Just like you CAN use a wrench as a hammer, you can use C to build a parallel piece of software; this doesn't mean you should, and it doesn't mean you can expect good results if you do.

I've seen languages like [D](http://dlang.org/) and [GO](http://golang.org/) that aim to be more ""modern,"" but I don't really think that they make it all the way to what we really need.

What do you think? Do we need a ""better"" language, write better compilers, or just be more explicit about parallelism when it is possible/desired?",,False,,t5_2rb2y,False,,,True,t3_uuhk5,http://www.reddit.com/r/coding/comments/uuhk5/are_there_any_good_systemslevel_languages/,

        var proxy = jQuery.event.proxy( fn );
        proxy.guid += selector + type;
    
        jQuery(document).bind( liveConvert(type, selector), selector, proxy );
      };
    }());

Then, in your code, instead of doing

    $(selector).live(event, callback);

You do

    $.live(selector, event, callback);

It works almost exactly the same, but the first one searches all over the DOM for $(selector) and then ignores the result, which can be very slow -- I've saved about 200ms on many of our pages' loading times (www.playfire.com, but this is not yet released) by switching to this method.
One caveat -- you cannot chain the latter, since it doesn't return anything.  Also, this may not work with jQuery versions other than 1.3.1.

Hope this helps some people out there!",,False,,t5_2rb2y,False,,,True,t3_a1m4b,http://www.reddit.com/r/coding/comments/a1m4b/jquerys_selectorlive_is_actually_pretty_slow/,

As many probably know, it's common to create ad-hoc macros for things like FOREACH(linked_list, variable_name) [seen in BSD's header-based linked list implementation] and other things, so that you can include a code block after it.  Now suppose you want to make a macro that surrounds your code with some snippets, for instance, to create an atomic block (I originally saw this in AVR-LIBC's implementation of ATOMIC_BLOCK).  Then you can do:

    #define BRACKET(before, after) for (int _x = 1, before(); _x; _x = 0, after())

Cool, huh?  Now you can write something like this (pre() and post() are functions):

1322344231.0,38,self.coding,mq7df,Query a server for the existence of a record without the server knowing exactly what record was being queried for (more inside).,50,12,24,http://www.reddit.com/r/coding/comments/mq7df/query_a_server_for_the_existence_of_a_record/,"I've been thinking about services such as [pwnedlist.com](http://pwnedlist.com) and [shouldichangemypassword.com](http://shouldichangemypassword.com) and the fundamental problem with them - trust.

That is to say the user must trust that these services aren't going to harvest the submitted queries.

Pwnedlist.com offers the option to submit a SHA-512 hash of the users query which is a step forward but still leaks information if the query does exist in the database. That is, a malicious service would know that the given email address was valid (see also: why you should never click unsubscribe links in spam email).

The solution I came up with is as follows:

1) Instead of the user calculating and submitting the hash herself, the hash (I'll use the much simpler md5 in my example) is calculated via client side javascript:

    md5(""user@example.com"") = ""b58996c504c5638798eb6b511e6f49af""

2) Now, instead of transmitting the entire hash as a query to the server, only the first N bits are transmitted:

    GET http://remotesite.com?query=b58996

3) The server responds with all hashes that exist in it's database that begin with the same N bits:

    {
    ""b58996afe904bc7a211598ff2a9200fe"",
    ""b58996c504c5638798eb6b511e6f49af"",
    ""b58996443fab32c087632f8992af1ecc"", 
    ...etc... }

4) The client side javascript compares the list of hashes returned by the server and informs the user whether or not her email address exists in the DB.
	*Since ""b58996c504c5638798eb6b511e6f49af"" is present in the server response, the email exists in the database - inform the user!*


Now, the obvious problem with this solution is that the user must trust the client side javascript to only transmit what it says it is going to transmit. Sufficiently knowledgable individuals however, would be able to verify that the query isn't being leaked (by observing the queries sent to the server). It's not a perfect solution but it would add to the level of trust if a user could (theoretically) verify that site functions as it says it does.

What does Reddit think of this solution? Importantly, does anyone know of any existing examples or discussion of this technique?

NOTE: Both [pwnedlist.com](http://pwnedlist.com) and [shouldichangemypassword.com](http://shouldichangemypassword.com) are apparently run by reputable people/organizations, and I have no reason to believe otherwise.

Why is it that the bits aren't simply shifted out? All `rand()` implementations have to return at least 16 bits, so you should be able to shift right 8 bits to obtain at least an 8 bit range, and realistically more like a 24 bit range on modern OSes.

Recently I have decided to try out MIT's [OpenCourseWare](http://ocw.mit.edu/). More specifically, [Introduction to Computer Science and Programming](http://ocw.mit.edu/OcwWeb/Electrical-Engineering-and-Computer-Science/6-00Fall-2008/CourseHome/index.htm). 


I will spare you the personal details of why I have decided to learn to program since I'm assuming that if you are reading this, you already understand the reasons one might have the desire to write code. As for choosing OCW, I have always wanted to go to college but have always been too poor and I refuse to take out a student loan.


Anyways, after going through a couple of the video lectures and completing the respective homework assignments, something occurred to me. Yea, I can figure out the assignment and write up something that will accomplish what was requested, but it probably isn't the neatest or most efficient solution. I can't ask the teacher (one of the perks of actually going to college), and I don't even have any classmates that I can talk to. So how do I go about getting input on the things I create, even if from just one or two people slightly more knowledgeable than myself? Well, that's what I am going for here. With each assignment, I will make a new post with respective links so that others may post solutions and give feedback. I have already done the first three, but I'll just leave this one up for a bit so I can see how this goes over. Once again, let me know where this should go if here is not the correct place.

**TL;DR:** For those of us too poor to afford the luxury of a teacher/classmates, maybe the internet can help?

If you do have a WebGL enabled browser you can check out the [live demo](http://www.cs.rit.edu/~bpd9116/WebGLU/examples/texture/reddit.html) If you want to mess around with it yourself just drop the below code into an HTML file.

The Khronos wiki has [instructions](http://www.khronos.org/webgl/wiki/Getting_a_WebGL_Implementation) for getting a WebGL enabled browser.

For those unable to get a WebGL enabled browser, [this](http://imgur.com/gDhj3) is a still of the rendering (it is the reddit logo on a rectangular prism that rotates along its long axis).

This demo uses my own [WebGLU](http://github.com/onegeek/webglu) library for working with [WebGL](http://www.khronos.org/webgl/wiki/Main_Page). (My poster submission to SIGGRAPH of this library was accepted a few days ago w00t!) I've got some (mediocre) [documentaton](http://www.cs.rit.edu/~bpd9116/WebGLU/doc/) up as well as some [examples](http://www.cs.rit.edu/~bpd9116/WebGLU/examples/ ""Just view source on each demo page"")  

 The [fragment](http://www.cs.rit.edu/~bpd9116/WebGLU/shaders/texphong.frag) and [vertex](http://www.cs.rit.edu/~bpd9116/WebGLU/shaders/texphong.vert) shaders used in the demo are also available if you want to poke at them.

`$W` is used to access WebGLU within the script.

I'm proud to say things have been very successful thusfar in my opinion. Posts have been nicely on subject, there haven't been any real moderation disputes, and the flow of content picked up after a bit of a dip. I've also been happy with the nature of the content being posted - no subject is overwhelming, and I've personally enjoyed a lot of the articles posted. 

Now, to the import matters. I'd like to ask everyone to take charge and report any articles they feel are off-topic (specifically in the New tab - most things that make it to Hot tend to be moderated already) as you see them. This way, the moderators can get a bit more information about the consensus of the type of content desired. This will obviously be more relevant as the flow of posting increases just a bit.

On that note, I'd like to discuss if anyone has strong opinions regarding the content that's a little less directly related to Coding - specifically tools. Actually, in general, does anyone have any suggested changes to the rules/policies/preferences of the subreddit?

Finally! Does anyone have any more suggestions for additional moderators? A certain Javascript guru joined us recently - so welcome Mr. jeresig. :)

After clicking around the programming subreddits I've decided to post to this one - if my question would be better suited to a different subreddit please let me know.

Also: if you know about this kind of problem already, please do let me know what I may be able to search about to research solutions/algorithms for solving it. I'd love to research more about it, but I don't know what it's called.

------------

I have an array of elements (""cells"") that each have differing widths, [pictured here](http://i.imgur.com/A7aV5.png) (The maxwidth, or width of the container, is 140 in that picture). The order of the cells isn't important, and I'd like to rearrange the cells such that as many rows as possible are close to or equal to the width of the container.


Each time a cell is placed next to another cell, ideally there would be some space between them - let's say 1px. So if a row contained 3 cells of widths 15, 15 and 10, the row itself would be 42 pixels wide.


**My goal is to maximize the number of rows generated that are equal to or close to (let's say, within 5 pixels) of the max width.**


What would be the best way to rearrange the cells to maximize the number of ""complete"" rows? Having cells left over that don't fit perfectly into a row is fine, I just want to maximise the number of rows that do fall within that window. 


---------

The first idea that came to mind was

1. Find the largest cell, subtract its width from the maximum width
2. Identify the largest cell that is under that maximum width, add it and subtract it from the remaining width
3. Repeat until no more cells can be added to the row. Create a row from these cells, and repeat

However, this doesn't meet my goal - say we had a row width of 62 and the following cells: { 25 25 20 15}. The above algorithm would have { 25 25 } in one row and { 20 15 } in the next, even though {25 20 15} makes a perfect row.

1257964636.0,28,self.coding,a3ckw,Programming problem: find a permutation given its inversion table,38,10,32,http://www.reddit.com/r/coding/comments/a3ckw/programming_problem_find_a_permutation_given_its/,"See [here](http://opc.iarcs.org.in/problems/iarcs-jun05-ad-2) for the source. I've pasted the text from the website here.

A permutation of the numbers 1, ..., N is a rearrangment of these numbers. For example

    2  4  5  1  7  6  3  8 

is a permutation of 1,2, ..., 8. Of course,

    1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8 

is also a permutation of 1, 2, ..., 8.

Associated with each permutation of N is a special sequence of positive integers of length N called its inversion sequence. The ith element of this sequence is the number of numbers j that are strictly less than i and appear to the right of i in this permutation. For the permutation

    2  4  5  1  7  6  3  8 

the inversion sequence is

    0  1  0  2  2  1  2  0 

The 2nd element is 1 because 1 is strictly less than 2 and it appears to the right of 2 in this permutation. Similarly, the 5th element is 2 since 1 and 3 are strictly less than 5 but appear to the right of 5 in this permutation and so on.

As another example, the inversion sequence of the permutation

    8  7  6  5  4  3  2  1 

is

    0  1  2  3  4  5  6  7 

In this problem, you will be given the inversion sequence of some permutation. Your task is to reconstruct the permutation from this sequence.

An algorithm that runs in quadratic time of the number of elements in the inversion sequence can be easily found. But I think it is possible to do better, probably O(n*lg n) and I've a hunch some sort of merging is involved. Any redditors care to have a crack?

[Source code](http://code.google.com/p/fapr/source/browse/trunk/fapr.py) (note: you'll need Python and Pygame installed in order to run)

I made this since I couldn't find any similar free lightweight image viewers for Windows where I could easily specify a few thousand images and then iterate over them at a rate of multiple images per second. FAPR is able to display images as fast as your computer can load them and has interactive controls that allow you to adjust the speed and switch easily between random iteration and sequential iteration, so if you see an interesting photo pass by, you can go back and view more photos from that set.

While I wrote FAPR with a specific purpose in mind, it can be used to view any collection of images that pygame can load (jpg, png, bmp, gif, etc) and is great for locating a specific image in a folder or a specific folder in a group of image folders.

Simple design, but was a days challenge getting it to be right.  maybe a good tutorial for jquery newbies.

homepage:
http://www.thehiltbar.com

js:
http://www.thehiltbar.com/js/thehilt.js


EDIT:  Some of the challenges:

1. The logo and rollovers are big on the splash page.  When you click a link, all of them must shrink at the same rate (they are separate images).  The solution...when you click on the link the whole shebang gets temporarily replaced by a single static image, which shrinks, then that gets replaced by smaller versions of the original.  A little bit of a pain to add a new link, but i think its pretty click.

2. I use the URL hash/setInterval trick to use the hash for something other than anchors.

3.  The Map needed to be loaded only when the map tab was first visible, not before, because there was a bug where the map would just be at the wrong location if created on a nonvisible div.  So the map only loads when that tab is first enabled, but only once.

4.  I use the onImagesLoad jQuery plugin to make sure all the images are loaded before the initial fade in.


Pretty simple stuff, but I think it cam out pretty clean.

Either way I decided to keep it because the people who originally wrote it were crazy. Like we gave them more work (against my request) and they decided to flip the location of properties and functions in a class crazy (TortoiseSVN loved that one for the merge).

Anyway I ran into an issue where every time I saved one file it would auto format and then give me an error at compile time. The error was:

&gt;Error 27 Unexpected NONE in parse rule ElementBody ::= ATTRIBUTE* ( PropertyElement | Content )* . ENDTAG..

Some of you might be aware of this issue in Silverlight. The error gives you a file and project name but no line number or anything to narrow down the cause. A quick google search found me some help, and apparently its caused by a self terminating tag (&lt;Border /&gt; with no content).

I went through the resource dictionary and fixed all the instances I could find. Hit save... and smacked my forehead. The reason why the formatter was causing the problem was because it was taking tags that looked like this &lt;Border&gt;&lt;/Border&gt; and converting it straight to &lt;Border /&gt;. 

Hopefully I'll find a way to turn off this only because it would be nice to have consistent XAML designs, otherwise it'll have to go.",,False,,t5_2rb2y,False,,,True,t3_tbswp,http://www.reddit.com/r/coding/comments/tbswp/til_autoformatting_xaml_in_silverlight_can_cause/,

I've been up all night doing my homework for algorithms class, and I've gotten everything done except this last problem which has been stumping me for half the day.  I was wondering if anybody out there could help shed some light on it, not necessarily the solution algorithm but where to begin?  I'm having trouble even coming up with reasonable subproblems.



&gt;Suppose we have two transmitters, each of which sends out repetitions of some short string. For example, transmitter 1 may repeat string x=101 over and over, so what we will hear from it will be a pre fix of x^k - that is, x concatenated to itself k times, possibly with a few bits chopped of the end (as in 10110110). Transmitter 2 repeats another string, y. Our job is to determine if a sequence s that we have heard is an interleaving of these two transmissions.

&gt;For example, suppose transmitter 1 repeats x=101 and transmitter 2 repeats y=01. The sequence 010111010101 can be unraveled into x and y: positions 1, 5, 9, and 12 contain 0101, a repetition of y, while the remainder of the string contains 10110110, a repetition of x.

&gt;Describe an efficient algorithm which takes a sequence s of length n, and two strings x and y, and determines if s is an interleaving of repetitions of x and y.

[EDIT] Solved.  Algorithm is below.  Thanks for the help guys, and especially to marshallbanana for pointing out an obvious way to improve it:)
    function validSequence(string s)
    {
        if (s.empty()) return true;

        if (s[0] equals x[0])
        {
            x = x.substr(1, x.length) + x[0];                  /* Shift x 1 char */
            if (validSequence(s.substr(1, s.length)))         /* Remove first char */
                return true;
        }
        if (s[0] equals y[0])
        {
            y = y.substr(1, y.length) + y[0];                  /* Shift y 1 char */
            if (validSequence(s.substr(1, s.length)))         /* Remove first char */

1337386785.0,16,self.coding,tu25r,"Need some help on a fractal-related algorithm (which may or may not be interesting, useful, or possible).",27,11,11,http://www.reddit.com/r/coding/comments/tu25r/need_some_help_on_a_fractalrelated_algorithm/,"I’m not sure if this is the best subreddit for this question—let me know if I should post it somewhere else instead.

This is a problem I’ve run into while working on a fractal-generating program, but it seems like it might have other applications as well. I’m trying to figure out an algorithm that returns values for integer x and y coordinates according to the following pattern:

    2 1 2 1 2 1 2 1  
    1 4 1 3 1 4 1 3  
    2 1 2 1 2 1 2 1  
    1 3 1 6 1 3 1 5  
    2 1 2 1 2 1 2 1  
    1 4 1 3 1 4 1 3  
    2 1 2 1 2 1 2 1  
    1 3 1 5 1 3 1 8  

To make the pattern clearer, here’s the values 1 to 4 shown separately:
    
      1   1   1   1       2   2   2   2
    1   1   1   1                                 3       3         4       4
      1   1   1   1       2   2   2   2
    1   1   1   1                             3       3
      1   1   1   1       2   2   2   2
    1   1   1   1                                 3       3         4       4
      1   1   1   1       2   2   2   2
    1   1   1   1                             3       3

Basically, the pattern fills the coordinate plane with numbers corresponding to an arbitrary number of nested grids, each of which is rotated by 45° and scaled by √2 in relation to the previous one. (It’s also related to the diamond-square algorithm, if that clarifies things.)

**Edit:** I should add that I don’t actually want to create an array filled with these values—I just want a function that returns a single value for an arbitrary set of coordinates. Also, I expect that the function will probably be undefined at (0,0).


So far I’ve come up with this function:  

    2+2*log2(x-(x&amp;(x-1)))

which returns the *maximum* value in a given row or column (2, 4, 2, 6, 2, 4, 2, 8, etc...). It appears that the final values can be determined solely from these row and column maxima, e.g.:

         2 4 6 8 10
       +-----------
     2 | 2 1 1 1 1
     4 | 1 4 3 3 3
     6 | 1 3 6 5 5
     8 | 1 3 5 8 7
    10 | 1 3 5 7 10

So the problem can be reduced to finding a function to predict *that* result.

**Edit:** It looks like this (pseudocode) works:

    mx = 2+2*log2(x-(x&amp;(x-1)))
    my = 2+2*log2(y-(y&amp;(y-1)))
    if mx == my:
        return mx
    else:
        return min(mx-1, my-1)

Is that the best approach, or is there a more efficient solution?",,False,,t5_2rb2y,1337484518.0,,,True,t3_tu25r,http://www.reddit.com/r/coding/comments/tu25r/need_some_help_on_a_fractalrelated_algorithm/,

1324641220.0,13,self.coding,nnuod,One of the best opinion on effective programmers I've read,21,8,5,http://www.reddit.com/r/coding/comments/nnuod/one_of_the_best_opinion_on_effective_programmers/,"Bellow is a comment on an article about programmer traits.  IMO the commenter has some good points, others not so much. Well, this is all about personal opinion so I would love to hear opinions from you redditors too.

&gt; I wish people would stop using the term ""Rockstar"" in reference to programmers. For a start, there are no rockstar programmers. If you're in programming for the fame then...well...wrong profession, we've only got one John Carmack and he builds rockets now.
&gt; 
&gt; Secondly, for what piddling similarity there is left between ""Rockstar"" and programming, everyone interprets it differently. For some it's the temper tantrums and diva nature, for others it's the skewed productivity rate.
&gt; 
&gt; Use a real term, and then you'll discover that what you though was a debate disappears. You want a productive coder? a cutting edge coder? you want someone who can solve your problems in half the time or someone who delivers code that's understandable by a monkey?
&gt; 
&gt; Each of these are different skills, programming is not sprinting, there is no single 100m time to serve as a metric for whether someone is great or not. Some coders are great because they have an enormous base of experience with a myriad of technologies - that comes at a price, others are good because they obsess about producing code that is crystal clear - that also comes at a price.
&gt; 
&gt; Yes being aware of your limitations and not going for the cool toys just because they're cool is a fine thing, but Dianne is no use to you long term, because the same reasoning that led her to use MySQL this time will lead her to use MySQL next time, and the time after that, she will never be comfortable with PostgreSQL until someone makes her use it against her better ""judgement"".
&gt; 
&gt; Stop trying to find some kind of magic personality attribute that indicates a great coder. You have all the information you need, because there is only one half-reliable indicator of the ability to deliver, and that is having delivered before. Stop monkeying about with your judgement of their judgement or what their approach is to technology choices - unless you're a great coder yourself you really aren't in any position to judge that shit anyway.
&gt; 
&gt; Just go find what they've done before, go over it with a fine toothed comb, ask them about it. If the studies are true, if great programmers really are tens, hundreds or even thousands of times more effective than merely average, they will so visibly stand out that you cannot possibly mistake them for anything but.
&gt; 
&gt; If you're not absolutely convinced the person you're hiring is an utter wizard, then that's because they're not - you'll never mistake one for a regular coder once you've seen their work. 
&gt; 
&gt; That's not always a bad thing. Regular coders can code too, and they're much cheaper (and often easier to manage). If they have good judgement, that's a nice plus.

Here is the mentioned article:

1291677852.0,14,self.coding,ehaw2,HTML over bittorrent. What are your thoughts on the idea?,48,34,54,http://www.reddit.com/r/coding/comments/ehaw2/html_over_bittorrent_what_are_your_thoughts_on/,"Each torrent file has a unique 20-byte hash, based on the info dictionary contained within the torrent file. There are 2 types of dictionary - single file and multi file.

A minimal single file info dictionary has the following keys:

* length: length of the file in bytes (integer)
* name: the filename. This is purely advisory. (string)
* piece length: number of bytes in each piece (integer)
* pieces: string consisting of the concatenation of all 20-byte SHA1 hash values, one per piece (byte string, i.e. not urlencoded)


A minimal multi file info dictionary has the following keys:

* files: a list of dictionaries, one for each file.
* name: the filename of the directory in which to store all the files. This is purely advisory. (string)
* piece length: number of bytes in each piece (integer)
* pieces: string consisting of the concatenation of all 20-byte SHA1 hash values, one per piece (byte string, i.e. not urlencoded)

Each dictionary in the files list contains the following keys:

* length: length of the file in bytes (integer)
* path: a list containing one or more string elements that together represent the path and filename. Each element in the list corresponds to either a directory name or (in the case of the final element) the filename. For example, a the file ""dir1/dir2/file.ext"" would consist of three string elements: ""dir1"", ""dir2"", and ""file.ext"". This is encoded as a bencoded list of strings such as l4:dir14:dir28:file.exte 


A file or set of files can be downloaded by querying a tracker or the DHT about its info hash.


By combining a web browser with a bitorrent client we could request an info hash which would download a specific static web page. In the case of multi file torrents, a 'default' key could be added which tells the web browser what file to open.

For example, you could type:

htob:&lt;info hash&gt;

into the address bar, which would download the page and open the default file.

It's trivial to distribute and display html over bittorrent for static websites, but a problem arises from trying to update such web sites. We need a method of imforming the user that a certain info hash is out of date and has been replaced by another info hash.

We can do this by using a history list (which is a list of lists) to keep a record of the info hash for the original versions and any updated versions of the page. Each list within the history list would therefore represent the history of that page, with the original version at the beginning of the list and the current version at the end of the list.

For example, you could type something like:

htob:&lt;info hash&gt;?current

which would obtain the current version of the page by querying the history list to find that page's history, then downloading the latest info hash entry.

I'm trying to implement a reusable module for communicating with video projectors over IP named PJLink. So far, so good; everything works when the projector is configured to skip authentication.

So here's the fun part. To do authentication, the projector passes us a string of 8 arbitrary bytes. We take that salt and append a predefined password, and hash that with MD5. We send that MD5 back, and we're authenticated.

The password can be up to a maximum of 32 bytes, and the salt is always 8 bytes. Since we never need to hash more than 40 bytes in total, I can write a crippled implementation of MD5 in this language that does ""just enough"" to get it done.

So here's why I'm coming to you, coddit. I have an implementation, but I know it's wrong. I can't seem to find just a breakdown of how the hash works, step by step, so I can compare my algorithm to the reference. Most of my issues (I think) come from trying to grok endianness, and [the RFC](http://www.faqs.org/rfcs/rfc1321.html) isn't helping me there.

So, any thoughts? I can pastebin my code if that helps.

**Edit**: [Here is my completed, tested module](http://crestron.pastebin.com/m3c1d3b4d). It's in a language called SIMPL+, which is event-based. Again, the implementation is crippled, but it could easily be extended for multi-chunk hashing.",,False,,t5_2rb2y,True,,,True,t3_9ymn9,http://www.reddit.com/r/coding/comments/9ymn9/reimplementing_md5_in_a_shitty_basicesque/,

* make an OCR copy
* make a PDF copy
* attach both files and email customer

now am not entirely sure if this is possible purely using PHP/MySql, with a little script either Java, Perl or VB on the side which is my first inkling

 ... frankly its a little beyond my skill set but as am the most tech savy person my client knows they've asked my opinion, any help grateful received if someone comes with a solution we could even look at paying or talent swapping or at the very least a bit of pizza for pointing me in the right direction

I'm working on a project and need some advice/references.,10,9,15,http://www.reddit.com/r/coding/comments/a93as/any_dsp_people_im_working_on_a_project_and_need/,"I'm currently writing a digital drum looper/synthesizer on an FPGA.  The specific subgoal is to be able to combine and play different prerecorded sounds initiated by button presses.  I've gotten that part to work, but to get sound output of a sufficient quality, I need to do it a lot better. I am running into a documentation/theory void for advanced DSP stuff, and deriving all of it experimentally is unreasonable in the time I have to do this. 

General question:

* Do you guys know of any online reference of DSP terminology and approaches? E.g. envelopes, smoothing, filtering, how to add sounds while retaining quality, noise elimination. I am aware that there are analog approaches to most of these, but since I have to apply them to individual samples before combining them, I need to do it digitally.  I'm currently working in a vacuum, unfortunately, and have been unable to find good references on the googles. 

* More specifically, any DSP reference for Verilog and Xilinx FPGAs? There is some wizardry to get it to synthesize to use the onboard block RAMs and multipliers correctly, and the 200-page datasheet doesn't help much. 

Specific questions:

* How would you create a combined sound out of several (less than 6) sound sources?  The way I'm approaching it now is by simply adding the concurrent 12-bit samples into a 15-bit result and then putting the top 12 bits of the result out. This ""works"", but it has the problem of reduced volume, more noise and distortion when less than all the sounds are playing. 

* How would you synthesize authentic-sounding drum noises? Originally, we planned to store 1-second duration WAVs of the sounds we needed on the FPGA, but that turned out to take up much more room than I had realized we had. The current idea is to clip out a representative portion of a drum sound, loop it, and apply an envelope to alter the volume to represent a hit.  Experimenting with this in MATLAB has not gotten me good results, instead sounding robotic and not at all like a drum. Any ideas?

Thanks!

I've been experimenting with the css of these 2 feeds, and I want to give each it's own style. Feed2js explains how to do this on it's site, but the example page 404's.

The explanation is quoted from the site:
&gt;A new feature added to our build form allows you to specify a name that becomes part of the class that defines the feed content. By default, this class is rss-box but if you name a new class such as ""cool"" or pass a parameter css=cool, you can now style via a class named rss-box-cool. You may have to redefine more specific sub-classes to make dramatically different styles.

So far I've given the 2 feeds different class names but it's flexibility is limited to changing the background colour, as the custom css class option on the build form only seems to edit the feed-encompassing "".rss-box"" class but not it's sub-classes.

So how do I define or separate the feed's sub-classes from each other? I've tried adding the same suffix i used to define the .rss-box classes, to their sub-classes but that didn't work.

When it says, ""pass a paramater css=cool"" in the above quote, where/how do i insert that? I am imagining that is to link to my own custom .css file(s), as it seems to be the only way I can think to give 2 separate styles to the 2 separate feeds. This would be a lot easier to do if I could see the example page but there's been nothing there for a while now, and I can't find a contact page for the creator.

1333519195.0,0,self.coding,rsi16,Advice on creating a Virtual Printer (and other stuff),3,3,2,http://www.reddit.com/r/coding/comments/rsi16/advice_on_creating_a_virtual_printer_and_other/,"OK, so I've recently been tasked with finding *something* that will capture a document from any Windows-based software.. Please keep in mind that my knowledge of driver code (the entire WDK in general) is zero.. My background is .NET with a focus on websites, so forgive any idiocies that make it into this explanation.

A brief summary of what we're hoping to achieve:

* A user 'prints' a document from *[Insert application here]* to our virtual printer. 

* This virtual printer will be able to convert the data being received back into real text (as far as I'm aware, print data is image based a la EMF), but preserve the text coordinates, font details etc. Reason being...

* Once the document is back into a text file of some kind, we are going to throw up a GUI that's *kind of* similar to the Windows Snipping Tool. The idea here, is to allow the user to select certain areas of the document, and say ""this selected region here is _____"". An example would be printing an invoice, and selecting the company's name on the invoice.

There's a little more that we'd do after this, but the principle is that once a user has printed an invoice (as an example) from their software, we would store the coordinates of each selected region and what it was, so that any future invoice printed could programmatically attain the text of each region, without requiring human interaction.

NOW... As our knowledge of writing print drivers is rather lacking, I figure it would be easier to purchase a virtual print driver with at least some of these capabilities, and then write our own code for the region-select part of it etc. 

So far I've found [this software](http://www.blackice.com) which supposedly has [a form reconstruction tool](http://www.blackice.com/PDRTKFormRebuild.htm). It looks promising, and it also comes with source code - but is a tad on the pricey side (they're asking anywhere between $3k - $12k) and so far my emails with them have not really given me great confidence. But as an example of what I'm after, it should be good enough for you to get the idea.

I'm a little lost right now as to what approach we should be taking. So far all other virtual printer drivers will produce an EMF file, but that's an image file and I don't particularly want to go down the path of OCR. The major benefit I saw with the software linked above, was that form reconstruction tool which preserved physical position of text, font info and stuff that we could use to help with selecting regions. Unfortunately their demo software was missing this particular tool, and when I inquired about it I was pretty much given the cold shoulder.

Any help/suggestions from you guys would be appreciated.",,False,,t5_2rb2y,False,,,True,t3_rsi16,http://www.reddit.com/r/coding/comments/rsi16/advice_on_creating_a_virtual_printer_and_other/,

It's an online voting application for the teacher's union.

Some immediate problems:

* The code is ASP.Net, and about half of the members of my team are on OS X.
* The code is absolute shite. Button1_Clicked(object sender, EventArgs e). A complete lack of indentation in many files. Lines of C# so long that they wrap three and four times across the screen. Blobs of HTML broken up by line in the .cs codebehind files. Zero comments. 2MB of undocumented JS files.
* Of the six of us, **none of us write ASP.Net.** In fact, .Net isn't even taught at our school.
* We have no IIS server to test on.

The bulk of the programming experience that is to be had is front-end experience (JS/CSS), raw back-end stuff (C++), and lots of PHP, some Python, and a bit of Java. We've already agreed not to even think about Java, but we're facing a big challenge. I'd gladly port the whole thing to Django or CodeIgniter, but I don't know if that's a great plan.

I know full rewrites are something to be avoided at all costs, but is it worth it to learn a new language (within the time constraints of the project) and paying for a Windows EC2 server to deal with poorly written code?

1316095043.0,0,self.coding,kgi7u,Ask coding: Are functions which have been scheduled using window.setTimeout guaranteed to finish executing before the 'main' JavaScript thread resumes?,2,2,2,http://www.reddit.com/r/coding/comments/kgi7u/ask_coding_are_functions_which_have_been/,"I've encountered some behavior that doesn't mesh well with what I thought I knew about how (most) JavaScript interpreters work.  My understanding was that there is only one thread of execution, and if the interpreter is busy running a function called via setTimeout, then no other JavaScript can be run until that function returns.

In most cases it seems like that's the case, but I've encountered an issue with MobleSafari that I haven't yet been able to track down to a root cause.  Here's a short description of what I'm doing:

I've bound a function to the 'touchmove' event on the document body.  This function does the following:

1. Records the coordinates of the event
2. Creates and appends an element to the document
3. Adds the element and coords onto a list
4. Schedules the timeout (if it hasn't been scheduled already)

The timeout function itself performs a series of DOM manipulations which were causing the main thread to lag, so I was trying to defer them so that I could record as much of the touchmove events as I could.

The background task seems to be doing something that is causing it to 'yield' to the main thread, allowing the main thread to run for a little while before it continues.  It happens consistently, but only when certain methods are called (I've yet to narrow it down to a specific call).  When it happens, I get a log that looks something like this:

&gt; Main: Start  
&gt; Main: Touchmove  
&gt; Main: Scheduling timeout  
&gt; Main: Pushing  
&gt; Main: Touchmove  
&gt; Main: Pushing  
&gt; Main: Touchmove  
&gt; Main: Pushing  
&gt; Background: Start  
&gt; Background: 3 items to process  
&gt; Background: Processing  
&gt; Main: Touchmove  
&gt; Main: Scheduling timeout  
&gt; Main: Pushing  
&gt; Main: Touchmove  
&gt; Main: Pushing  
&gt; Background: Processing  
&gt; Main: Touchmove  
&gt; Main: Pushing  
&gt; Background: Processing  
&gt; Background: Finished  
&gt; Main: Touchmove  
&gt; Main: Pushing

If I remove the call (into a 3rd-party library), the log looks like I'd expect:

&gt; Main: Start  
&gt; Main: Touchmove  
&gt; Main: Scheduling timeout  
&gt; Main: Pushing  
&gt; Main: Touchmove  
&gt; Main: Pushing  
&gt; Main: Touchmove  
&gt; Main: Pushing  
&gt; Background: Start  
&gt; Background: 3 items to process  
&gt; Background: Processing  
&gt; Background: Processing  
&gt; Background: Processing  
&gt; Background: Finished  
&gt; Main: Touchmove  
&gt; Main: Scheduling timeout  
&gt; Main: Pushing

I had nearly finished the program in C before I realized that it's run through the command prompt with command line arguments and I can't ask my coworkers to use it like that. I started looking at using the Windows API, but it was a little overwhelming at first and more importantly, I hated it.

Is there any way someone could write me a UI I can wrap my program in? It just needs a few fields to enter some strings that my program will use once a button is hit to start it and if possible include a field to browse for a file and a field to browse for a folder.

If you represent a rectangle by the position of its left, top, right, and bottom edges, there are two ways to interpret that when considering what pixels are inside it (for all operations, filling, clipping, even outlining, and so on).

One way is to fill all pixels from left to right and top to bottom inclusive.

The other way fills pixels &gt;= left and &lt; right and &gt;= top and &lt; bottom.

I've observed that even though excluding the right and bottom edges is the less obvious and more intuitively weird way, it makes sense after a while and logic is simpler (like with 0-based arrays). For example, `width == right - left` rather than `width == right - left + 1`. If you want your API to generalize to units other than tiny pixels, it seems to be the only sensible way to do it, because consider a larger unit, like inches on a ruler:

    0        1        2        3        4        5
    |--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|

A rectangle with left=1 and right=4 fills 3 inches of width this way. If you included the right edge it would extend up to the 5-inch mark.

I'm just rambling really, but this interests me and I never had anyone to discuss it with and I've never seen any discussion on it. I've seen both styles used successfully in different graphics APIs.

Does anyone have any opinions on the merits of the different styles?",,False,,t5_2rb2y,False,,,True,t3_kbl0s,http://www.reddit.com/r/coding/comments/kbl0s/rectangles_in_graphics_apis/,

Sure, it would be like reinventing the wheel, but why not?

Completely open source, built from scratch by the reddit community, designed for modern web and applications. The best of PHP, Java, Python, Ruby, C++... whatever.

We could call it Vermilion, which is a more official word for orangered. Our goal could be to write a clone of reddit in it.

Well, it's just an idea I had. I don't know the first thing about designing a programming language, so I could definitely not organize this to any greater extent, but if some one else feels inspired it could be awesome, right?

* The script creates the smallest set of rules for turning all the correct 1s on.

* If the script was run it would allocate a block of memory on your disk equal to the number of bits the original scanned file had, and then run the rules to turn on the correct bits.

* You could then share this compact set of rules with people over the internet to transfer large files in a really compressed way.

I was wondering if it is possible to have two or more words highlight when you hover over only one word in CSS.

For example, my html could be:

&lt;span class=""word""&gt;Hello&lt;/span&gt; reddit, I am trying to get two words to highlight at the same time. Is there any possible &lt;span class=""word""&gt;way?&lt;/span&gt;

And in CSS I would have something like:

.word:hover { background-color: blue; }

In this example, I would like to hover my mouse over the word ""Hello"" and have both ""Hello"" and ""way?"" highlighted blue. I have tried to use both an id or a class. Essentially, all I want to do is to be able to highlight the color blue two words by simply hovering over only one.

Is it possible to do this without using Javascript? If it has to be done using Javascript, how do I do this?

Since we basically build web sites using Asp.NET this also means visual studio.  
The issue here is that my co-worker insists on putting class files in the root of the project or occasionally in subdirectories in the root.  
I lean towards putting them in a single subfolder and then possibly additional subfolders depending on situation.  
For me it is hard to find all these classes spread around everywhere, including among other webpage based class files and among other static content directories (not inside these directories just directories filled with what might be classes or what might be static content).  
I wouldn’t be too against using a class library but that further points to keeping the files separate and not in the root of the project.
