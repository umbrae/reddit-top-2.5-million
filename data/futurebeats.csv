I welcome the 2,500 youngins, so let me introduce you to r/futurebeats!",245,23,69,http://www.reddit.com/r/futurebeats/comments/miyzv/yesterday_was_amazing_i_welcome_the_2500_youngins/,"Yep. 2,500. If you count the new subscriptions since saturday, we've gained 2,624 new subscribers in 24 hours. That is quite some change for a subreddit that originally had 3,900 subscribers and gained about 15 a day. You guys basically doubled our size! 

To the ones that were on here before that event and are worried this subreddit will decline in quality, I can only say: wait and see. The amount of posts hasn't really increased all that much since we gained our first 1,000 subscribers, so I'd say that we'll definitely see more votes but not a new massive influx of tunes, and I think it's better that way.

Now, this post is for your questions, but I'll answer some beforehand:


* *What on earth are Futurebeats?*

[**This post**](http://www.reddit.com/r/futurebeats/comments/kt68f/why_do_most_futurebeats_seem_to_be_downtempo/) provides some valuable insight on the matter, what and what isn't considered futurebeats and some major influences and developments in Electronic bass music :)


* *I don't see any posting rules. Are there any?*

This subreddit is all about the music. If it isn't music related in any way it will either be removed (NO MEMES. This will not become r/dubstep if I can have a word about it) or the userbase usually downvotes it to hell. Music-wise you can post almost anything. See the sidebar.

REPOSTS: We've handled reposts by not thinking about them until we hit 3,500 subscribers and they became a frequent occurence. [**Here's**](http://www.reddit.com/r/futurebeats/comments/m05eq/its_time_to_talk_about_reposts/) a post explaining what we do about reposts and exceptions to the rule.


* Other stuff: I'd really **really** recommend reading through the sidebar. The community has put together some awesome posts on how to find new futurebeats and also there is the *Monthly Mix* in which I make a set out of the top-voted tunes of last month and put it up here for [**all to see**](http://www.reddit.com/r/futurebeats/comments/j8pyo/futurebeats_mixes/)!
r/futurebeats is a really active and appreciative community, so if you're a producer and want to get your new tunes out there or get some critique, feel free to post. 

I think that's it for now, now feel free to ask away :)",,False,self,t5_2ro3c,False,,headphones,True,t3_miyzv,http://www.reddit.com/r/futurebeats/comments/miyzv/yesterday_was_amazing_i_welcome_the_2500_youngins/,moderator

This track was actually produced by Black Milk, and it samples [John Abercrombie - Timeless](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bhz77Pvfi5M). The sample appears about 9:15 in, and is my favorite jazz track of all time. I wouldn't have known about it if it weren't for Dilla!

Original Sample: Alright I know I've been cheating sharing all of these samples, but my favorite original sample Dilla used is probably [Gap Mangione - Diana in the Autumn Wind](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tj04d1h0NUE), which was sampled both for [Jaylib - The Official](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yDxIyG12ikA), and the absolute classic: [Slum Village - Fall in Love (produced by Dilla)](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s732BigTxZk).

Tribute: [Flying Lotus - Fall In Love (J Dilla Tribute)](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwAa6I0dmA0).

Anyway, I hope some of you share my affinity for J Dilla, and those who don't know about Dilla yet can learn a lot about him in this thread.

Also if you're not sure what he sampled, check out [Whosampled.com](http://www.whosampled.com/), not only is it an amazing resource, but it's a great way to kill time and find new tracks.",,False,self,t5_2ro3c,False,,,True,t3_181sda,http://www.reddit.com/r/futurebeats/comments/181sda/j_dilla_arguably_the_most_influential_futurebeats/,

This isn't a bad thing! But what hasn't skyrocketed is the number of votes and comments on submissions. 

It used to be that I would check here daily and listen to all the posts in a short while. Now I am positive I am missing a very large percentage simply because there are so many submissions and I don't have that much time. And almost all of them have fewer than 5 votes. 

My point and suggestion is that it doesn't seem fair to ask people to listen to your submissions if you aren't listening to theirs. I'd ask everyone to please, before you submit something, go through the first page and actually listen to them and then VOTE and comment.

Futurebeats has been such an amazing place for me to discover new music that I now love. I just fear that it may eventually slide into a dumping ground for every new or obscure artist instead of a community sifting out what is truly great. It is experimental music, and by the nature of experiments, MOST EXPERIMENTS FAIL. We need to be a community that values the successful ones and gives feedback on what works.

So, 10,000. We are a big subreddit now for a very specific set of underground electronic music (Futurebeats kinda have become a thing), with a very high output of tunes posted. The community could be a bit more active in terms of commenting though ;)

We also feature lots of [**producers**](http://www.reddit.com/r/futurebeats/comments/pjol9/with_the_recent_influx_of_excellent_producers/) and have spawned off two subreddits (go subscribe to those if you need more future in your life).

What does the future hold for r/futurebeats? Well, we are planning to do a redesign of the subreddit, if anybody has ideas, send them our way! The MArch Mix is in the works, don't worry, I haven't forgotten, I'm just hella busy with learning for school now. If you need some bass music, I've recently branched out into [**Neurofunk**](http://www.mixcloud.com/Frontcannon/necromantic-neurophunk/), so check that mix out if you're into Drum &amp; Bass or want to become a fan ;)

Again, thank you folks for participating in this subreddit, it's been a great experience so far. Let's keep it that way &lt;3

r/futurebeats was created 3 years ago and as a timely birthday present we reached amazing 25,000 listeners! There could be no better time for the mods to return. Well, for me to return tbh, I've been not very active on this subreddit for a while now.. anyways, we have some long-awaited announcements to make!

The Essentials List is finished! You can admire it [**here**](http://www.reddit.com/r/futurebeats/wiki/essential_list). It's part of our wiki which we will add stuff like worthy self-posts and other resources to as well :)  
Everybody with 100 subreddit karma can edit it I believe. Add in what you consider relevant, but please message us first before removing something.

We also added a new mod to the team! Welcome /u/biscuit484 to the team of elusive personas you could call /r/futurebeats moderators.. 

Now on to the rule rejuvenation thing: you demanded in a recent thread more hands-on moderation and clearer rules as well. We incorporated them into this handy submit page [**right here**](http://www.reddit.com/r/futurebeatstest/submit).. Hope you like them! Because you should. HARHAR

If you noticed I linked to something special, you're right. We've been working on a /r/futurebeats redesign for quite some time, and it's time for us to present something to the general population! We could have just change this as well, but the outcry would've been deafening supposably, so it was just easier for us to create a sample subreddit where we could try things. Once you're (mostly, can't please anyone) content with the design, we'll start implementing it here.

Phew.. what a post. But we're still not done.. I know I haven't released any new mixes lately, but I'm already working on my next one! The theme (yes, I do themes now) is videogamebeats, as I know how much you love these (me included). It's really fucking hard to find enough quality tunes for a solid mix (45+ mins), so that takes a while. Suggestions.. well, you know what to do ;)

I'm going to make myself dinner now and check up on this post in half an hour, in that time the other mods will be pleased to answer any and all of your questions (right guys?)!

Much love,

As you've maybe read in my last post, we (the mods) were considering an **Essential Album ban list** to cope with the reposting, as this subreddit is about the new and undiscovered tunes that originally made it big! :)

Feedback has been great, so we are finally going through with it now! Procedure is as follows:

* Please post what you consider an **essential** album in the comments. 1 album per comment, EPs and compilations are also allowed. Singles aren't, we don't want this list to get too long. We don't mean essential for the 'genre' here, more in the sense of **essential for this subreddit**.

* We will then do a survey on an external site determining which of these will make it into the list. We are leaving the decision all up to you guys, as every tune from these albums will be BANNED TO POST aka removed on sight. 

* The final list will go in to the [**Futurebeats FAQ**](http://code.reddit.com/wiki/help/faqs/futurebeats) so everybody can access it and consist of links to the albums so newbies can get acquainted with them more quickly. You'll also get a nice image consisting of the album covers which will be linked in plain sight at the header.

Another thing: I know you are all waiting for more mixes of mine.. (or any mixes at all lol) sorry I'm so slow with releasing them. I have two weekly sets on [**EMP Radio**](http://emp.cx/) where I stream my personal favourite beats and tidbits from other genres (dubstep, drum&amp;bass for example) *LIVE*. Do you want me to announce the set times in the subreddit, or even release these mixes on here? They are all **live and improvised**.

Thanks for listening, and now get posting! :)

1367005126.0,126,self.futurebeats,1d693g,Flying Lotus did NOT say he was going to have a radio station in GTA 5. I was at that show too. He didn't say that.,158,32,23,http://www.reddit.com/r/futurebeats/comments/1d693g/flying_lotus_did_not_say_he_was_going_to_have_a/,"Hey guys, I saw [this post](http://www.reddit.com/r/futurebeats/comments/1czr24/flying_lotus_is_getting_his_own_radio_station_in/) and wanted to let you all know it's not completely true.

That post claims that FlyLo: ""[announced] that he's getting his own station on GTA V!""

**I was actually at that same show, front row, and I heard what he actually said. He never once said what game it is, but he did say that he's ""not allowed to say what game it is,"" but that it's ""a game where you shoot people and take their cars. And shoot police. [Audience laughs, cheers] [Flying lotus laughs] Don't do that though, I didn't say that.""**

*Edit: And as some people have mentioned in comments, he DID confirm that he was getting his own radio station in whatever game he's talking about. I didn't mention this earlier because I thought it was clear that I was only correcting the part about the game being confirmed. Sorry about that.*

This could be referring to either GTA5 OR Saints Row 4, and I personally think SR4 is more likely considering they had Tim &amp; Eric in SR3 and FlyLo also works closely with Tim &amp; Eric and Adult Swim.

Anyways, I really wanted to clear this up because it seems like a lot of gaming news sites have picked up on that false announcement and that just ain't right.
___________

*EDIT: Thanks to Destroyer474 for pointing out that the other thread's OP DID clarify, in [this comment](http://www.reddit.com/r/futurebeats/comments/1czr24/flying_lotus_is_getting_his_own_radio_station_in/c9lidd5), that it may not be GTA5. He didn't edit this info into the main post, however, and for people who don't read comments, it is a very misleading post.*

Yes, this subreddit still has mods.. a little update on where the Essentials went, why there hasn't been a mix in months and other stuff! ",125,19,39,http://www.reddit.com/r/futurebeats/comments/10kdl3/hello_rfuturebeats_yes_this_subreddit_still_has/,"So.. you haven't heard from us in quite a long time, and I apologize on behalf of the modteam. We've been slacking :(

The Essentials list has been condensed into [**this image**](http://imgur.com/fMNn5), which we want to put into a sticky at the top of the page for everyone to see. It will be put into a selfpost with an expanded version of the list, links to the albums on the list, an updated ruleset etc.

Secondly, I want to redesign r/futurebeats. We're nearing 20,000 listeners and are one of the biggest electronic music subreddits right now (I only know of r/dubstep and r/electronicmusic being bigger), and I thinks this warrants a redesign. A lot of people don't get what the up- and downvote buttons are supposed to be (a fwd and a stop button), and some dislike the allcaps style of our font. You shall be accommodated!  
I'd also really like to have a proper submit page, with the rules again plainly visible when submitting. 

Regarding the mixes.. to be honest, I haven't listed to much Futurebeat music lately. I can't keep up with the subreddit anymore, you post so many tunes that I can only digest a small fraction of :D  
I'm more on a dnb and darkstep trip right now, if you're interested in knowing more, check [**this post**](http://www.reddit.com/r/DnB/comments/10kcnf/dear_rdnb_mod_of_rfuturebeats_here_im_looking_for/). I also lost the playlist to the Futurebeats Summer Mix when I moved on to a new OS, sadly :(  
If there are any DJs out there, feel free to post your mixes in here :)

We have found a guy for the necessary CSS for the redesign and the sticky, I just didn't get around to make a new design for the subreddit yet (I have lots of drafts, but I'm not content with any of them). And because everything else basically depends on that, there hasn't happened much here in the recent month. I'd love suggestions and critique, that would help a lot!

Keep on listening,

&gt;'Future', here, is a state of mind.

So how can people go around posting and acting like someone can identify what is and is not a futurebeat? Is futurebeat an actual genre that incorporates general circlejerk fodder such as chillwave/wonky/ambient/Flying Lotus, and I just happened to miss the memo on it? Or is it, as the sidebar claims, a state of mind? An ideology that each individual can posses that involves pushing or breaking the standard conventions of music in any particular genre?

To give an example, [I posted Frank Ocean's ""Pilot Jones"" a few hours ago,](http://www.reddit.com/r/futurebeats/comments/1cbz8q/frank_ocean_pilot_jones/) and was met with downvotes and a 'this isnt a futurebeat' comment. Now, I am fully aware of the fact that people on reddit like to beat off to Frank, but that's not why I posted it. To me, ""Pilot Jones"" is a very interesting combination between standard R&amp;B sensibilities and the more experimental hip hop edge that tends to come from Odd Future members. Large, overwhelming kicks, trippy reverse synths, and a singular finger snap are the only things that accompany Frank and his many overdubs on the track, and the atmosphere is unlike that of what most people hear from the R&amp;B genre. It is for that reason that I consider the song a more forward-thinking and, therefore, ""futuristic"" song, unlike most other songs on that particular album.

But who gives a fuck when you can listen to the same fucking chillwave songs that constantly crowd the frontpage.",,False,self,t5_2ro3c,1365981843.0,,,True,t3_1ccop8,http://www.reddit.com/r/futurebeats/comments/1ccop8/what_is_a_futurebeat/,

**edit: [non-recent tracks for the playlists-playlist](http://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLF0Yet6izSEgW2ZxvEhSKJxhFv_Xm9GzB)**

I made a playlist for non-recent tracks that I upload for adding them to the other playlists. These are sometimes not well-known but definently deserve recognition.  Here's the latest example: [Kirvy - FeelingYouFeelingMe](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0DT_Atqikek).

**!! edit: also, if any of you have criticism or suggestions, please do tell me. (I'm very open to it, you can private message me, if you prefer)**

Hi, I've been collecting 'futurebeats'-music for the past few years and felt like making categorized Youtube-playlists for everyone.
There are tons of tracks that aren't on Youtube yet, so I'll be uploading daily whenever I get permission from the artists to do so ... (that means 'Subscribe' if you like what you hear)

And for all of you who prefer listening to only recent tracks there's a summary below as well.

Good on you. I use HTTPS Everywhere, myself. But for some odd reason, RES doesn't allow the in-page loading of songs (there's gotta be a more technical term for that) on soundcloud, unless you take out the s in https in the URL before you click submit and allow it to be unsecured. 

It's not a big deal, but it makes the page more self-contained and eliminates a lot of unnecessary tabs and extra shit that don't need to be loaded. Knaamean?

Together we can be super convenient internet surfers!

We've grown into quite a community here, 27,000 subscribers and 40,000 monthly active users. We decided it was time to move forward as community and get things like an essential list of artists stickied to the top left of the page, rules posted clearly on the [submit](http://www.reddit.com/r/futurebeats/submit) page, and most obviously a graphic redesign.




We also want to find ways to encourage more community closeness here, we will be making [OFFICIAL DISCUSSION THREADS] of new releases/albums so that we can have a place for all our opinions on it to come together, rather than having a million scattered posts from the release. Feel free to create such posts for relevant cases. 




So we want to hear what you guys have to say about the interface, about bringing the community closer, dislikes/likes about the way things go or the official rules. Feel free to also take a stab at a certain graphics like the logo if you see fit.




In a final note, if you are passionate about this scene and think you can make the experience of /r/futurebeats /r/futurebeatproducers or /r/futurepopmusic better as a mod, let us know! Ultimately, we want to make this the best place it can be and grow as we soar ever through the future.

My residents were stoked at all the plays/downloads/comments on their mixes and I can only hope to do it again for them. 

For those who don't know, we're all about playing beats/tunes that don't get the play time they deserve and my residents are very adept at weaving multiple ""genre's"" to make stellar mixes. If you can't make it, either due to time constraints or simply not being in the country, don't worry - from this event onward, we're recording every set both sonically and visually. Think Boiler Room.

We've started from the very bottom and I'm immensely proud of the hype we're building. Stay tuned for write-ups in a few blogs, for us to upload our videos to our YouTube and keep informed via our facebook/twitter, as I personally keep them updated with the latest news and beats from the beat music world.

Much love /r/futurebeats, it's a privilege to be able to share this kind of thing with you.
