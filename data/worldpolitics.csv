This act is original purpose was to identify individuals who are/will be responsible for publishing any defamatory or anarchistic material or anything of its likes.


However, there are some flaws in this act.


This act does not take into account of factors of identity thefts and computer hacking. The offense will also be weighed on the owner of the page/site even if the comments/posts is published by other people.


This greatly affects us, the people of Malaysia and maybe even other countries (I'm not very familiar with the international laws regarding this, maybe someone can help add more details to this).

How can you help with the Stop 114a movement even if you're not from Malaysia?


The very least I can ask from you would be to post on Twitter with the hashtag #stop114a or post on any social network regarding the flawed Act 114a and it's withdrawal.


TL;DR New act in Malaysia which states that you are responsible for any defamatory posts on your site/page even if not your own.


Have a good day :).

Timeline:

1. RH Bill is introduced due to overpopulation and high crime rate
2. Religious sectors against it. Calling it abortion. Condoms and contraception is abortion.
3. Senator Sotto writes/copies melodramatic biased speech against the bill. He a powerful voice of the Religious sector.
4. People call him out for plagiarism and melodrama.
5. He denies
6. In his embarrassment, he adds a libel clause to the Cybercrime law to ""Level the playing field against social media critics"" - his words
7. The Law passes
8. Alleged PNP Facebook account uses new law to threaten people for criticizing them

Here's the link to the threat:

http://www.rappler.com/nation/13410-pnp-warns-against-using-foul-word-vs-officers-online

The police are denying that it's their account.

All of this started because we're trying to get the RH Bill passed. A law that will allow people to have access to contraception and birth control. A law that our Roman Catholic, overpopulated, and high crime rate country refuses to pass as it considers it abortion.

A Senator against the bill plagiarized a blogger when he wrote a speech against the bill. The whole country confronted him for lying online and he cried ""Cyber bullying"" and inserted libel into the Cyber crime law so no one could criticize him anymore. Now the police are abusing the libel clause in the bill.

We are not like you America. We are afraid. We cannot protest the same way you do because you can go to jail here without any formal charges. The police and the government are in control. We are a people who just goes about our lives not really concerned with all the death, crime, and religious propaganda. As long as it doesn't affect us, we don't care. Well God damnit I DO! I'm sure a lot of people do too!

What can we do? Can you help us spread the word like you did for SOPA, PIPA, CISPA and ACTA?

1361812116.0,1092,self.worldpolitics,1977np,"I am Italian, 25 and packing up. Dictatorship is like cancer and this country's brain is rotten.",1362,270,532,http://www.reddit.com/r/worldpolitics/comments/1977np/i_am_italian_25_and_packing_up_dictatorship_is/,"Yes this is a rant but I hope this will help people realize how important it is to always communicate, share and listen to different opinions, and how much power the media have over ignorant masses.

Please, never listen to the TV, never listen to one side of things, always question authority and think before voting... I don't know what else to say, I don't think I want to live in this country anymore because after 20 years they are still voting a Mafioso, believing all the stupid promises he makes. You'll pay no taxes! Oh that's great, let's just vote him.

The truth is that Berlusconi is a mirror of this country. Italy is a country of thieves and dogs, they don't care about eating their kin's dead bodies if they can profit from it. Why go for a path of justice when you're a thief and criminal at heart? Why promote collectivity when you only want personal profits?

Everyone knows that Berlusconi won't keep his promises, but everyone also knows he won't punish the injustices that are plaguing the country. Would lepers enjoy being quarantined? That's what we are, a country of lepers. What I don't understand is, whose fault is it? Is it our fault, 'cause we didn't react, or is it the government's fault for spreading the plague further?

I cannot describe what has been happening in this country any other way: it's a sickness, I am not carefully choosing words while I type this in a rush, it's just the most natural picture that comes to my mind. Italy has terminal brain cancer and it's got to a point where it cannot be cured.

Berlusconi entered politics helped by the Mafia while holding a massive media empire and that was just the start of it all... Despite all the shady things he's been doing in all these years, nothing stopped him from taking over TV in Italy and subject everyone, especially the youth in the country, to a public show of whoredom and stupidity. That's Italy, have some ass! Wanna talk about economy? How about some nice piece of ass? Culture? Have some ass! Ass is better than shit like reading or thinking. Have some ass, idiot, and vote for us.

I haven't watched this country's shitty TV in years and now I feel like George Nada in *They Live*, 'cept I can't kick ass. Everybody is a fucking alien in here. There are people close to my family who vote for Mr. B. and when I try to talk with them and I ask why, they can't answer. They just *do it*, if you question them further they just tilt, you can see the steam come out of their stupid ears while their brain is melting.

Is it really possible to brainwash a country this hard with just TV? I didn't want to believe so, but I hope by the time this place has gone to ashes people will have learned the lesson so that this stops happening. Stop TV. Don't watch TV. Burn 'em, do something.

This corrupt government has done everything they could to prevent Internet and international culture from spreading, while other countries in Europe were already far ahead. They have been campaigning against everything that allowed people to get in touch with the world or anything that wasn't f***ing soccer and whores.

We are such an ignorant country and ignorance brings corruption, that's why Italians support the Mafia and that's why it's become so potent. The rest of Europe is in danger too, I hope they realize. I really hope that one day the EU will threaten these corrupt bastards out of their thrones, but that won't happen of course.

So how can you fight this? How can a country think it through when it has brain cancer? How can you prevent this sickness from spreading when it's taking over? How can you trust other people when half your country is supporting the Mafia?

At this point I just don't care anymore. I don't have any motivation to stay here, I don't even feel like talking to people anymore because I know I'll see their alien, stupid faces through the sunglasses. There is really no future in here.",,False,self,t5_2qh9a,False,,,True,t3_1977np,http://www.reddit.com/r/worldpolitics/comments/1977np/i_am_italian_25_and_packing_up_dictatorship_is/,

The title is an accurate description of the general atmosphere here in Goiania, centrally located in the State of Goias, in Central Brazil.

**Operation Monte Carlo**

Allegedly, for the past 17 years or more, organized crime has been running an illegal gaming racket, including fruit machines, nationwide in Brazil.  According to the [Clean Slate](http://tupiwire.wordpress.com/2012/03/24/clean-slate-law-the-decline-and-fall-of-senator-torres/) blog, operation Monte Carlo uncovered ties between reputed Mafia Boss Carlos August “Charlie Waterfall” Ramos and Senator Demóstenes Torres of the State of Goias.

**Corruption of the Policia Federal and Policia Militar**

[The New World Lusophone Sousaphone](http://tupiwire.wordpress.com/2012/02/29/waterfall-is-bingo-busted/) quotes [The Estadao](http://www.estadao.com.br/noticias/cidades,ao-menos-20-sao-presos-por-exploracao-de-caca-niqueis,842022,0.htm), saying, ""During 15 months of investigation, Monte Carlo has uncovered the bribery of two federal police officers and six precinct captains in Goias, together with four military police corporals, three lieutenant colonels, a captain a major, two sergeants and 18 privates, all from Goias. Also investigated were a federal police secretary, a highway patrol officer, and others.""

**Governor Marconi**

Marconi Parillo is governor of the State of Goias, located in Central Brazil.  He's been governor since 2002.

**The Carta Capital Incident**

Understandably, some journalists decided they could make careers on the backs of this nationwide scandal, and pictures of a high-ranked senator, Governor Marconi, and alleged mafia boss Carlinhos Cachoeira appeared on the cover of Carta Capital magazine.

And oh, the shit hit the fan.

The students, in [their manifesto](http://wwwtribunacampineira.blogspot.com.br/2012/04/movimento-fora-marconi-ganha-forca-e.html), tell of this magazine cover being ""suppressed"" in Goiania, with unmarked cars buying out entire stocks of the magazine.  Students hate censorship, so they've decided to take their anti-corruption message directly to the people.

Governor Marconi is accused of: ""Unfulfilled campaign promises, endemic corruption, threats, acts of censorship, neglect of education, neglect of culture, low rate of innovation, unsustainable environmental practices, bribing the media, weak opposition that never changes anything, and psychological terrorism,"" that these are ""...'práticas coronelistas' that go back to the past century and they should not be accepted by us, young Goianos, who are into fghting for the resignation of a governor who represents the old ways in this country, the 'apedeuta' Marconi Perilo.""

**The Demonstrations**

On Saturday, April 14th, students and families occupied Praca Civica in the center of downtown Goiania to call for the resignation of Governor Marconi.  The movement calls itself [Fora Marconi](https://www.facebook.com/groups/379546372085577/) (Marconi, Get Out), and their Facebook group has increased in membership over 500% since yesterday.  [Video of the march](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pA8NNh62Tbg).  [imgur album of the march](http://imgur.com/a/DvpkQ#0).

Marconi's counter-demonstration, a show at Praca Civica, was not a factor.

**Global News**

[Global News](http://g1.globo.com/videos/goias/t/todos-os-videos/v/manifestantes-protestam-contra-denuncias-de-corrupcao-envolvendo-governo-de-goias/1903687/) reported the demonstration as a small group of rival party members against Marconi.

**The Future**

The movement has scheduled [another demonstration](https://www.facebook.com/events/208801109232984/209290595850702/?notif_t=plan_mall_activity) at Praca Civica next week starting at 10am, concluding at 2pm.  This demonstration could take many forms.  I'm still waiting to see what the plan is, but I'll definitely be there.",,False,self,t5_2qh9a,True,,,True,t3_satc8,http://www.reddit.com/r/worldpolitics/comments/satc8/grab_your_popcorn_this_is_breaking_news_the/,

International and local press remains silent.,813,170,138,http://www.reddit.com/r/worldpolitics/comments/12vkhe/greatest_corruption_scandal_in_the_dominican/,"After a mandate characterized by rampant estate spending, politicians getting lavish houses and cars, pensions of about USD$12,500 a month for top party officials **for four years of work** while still having a thousand of dollars government job in another position (Minimum wage is a little over $200), crazy salary hikes, blatant clientelism and tax evasion, millions and millions in government money to fund the official party's presidential campaign, and many other things, the party ends and the people have to pay the bill.

The congress has approved a fiscal reform that basically screws the people, raising taxes in general and taxing basic food items, as well as small internet purchases that were one of the few ways to circumvent the abusive local retailers (You'd have to pay double the online price + shipping for basically anything). 

This problem isn't solved by taxing, it's solved by making those responsible pay. Not a single politician has been put in jail or even tried, even those for whom there is incontrovertible evidence of ghastly instances of fraud and corruption. Today the reform was approved by a government controlled Congress in just 19 minutes with no room for debates. Dissenting congressmen were silenced and not given the opportunity to speak. [A student was killed](http://www.dominicantoday.com/dr/local/2012/11/8/45699/Student-dies-in-Dominican-Republic-anti-tax-protests) during riots in the state university and it's believed to be the first of several deaths in the near future. 

All because a central figure named Leonel Fernandez, until 84 days ago the President of 12 years, personally controls all of the State Powers: Government, Congress and Supreme Court. He also controls most of the media, so even the fourth state is under his power. It's ironic since countries like Canada gave him an award as Statesman of the Year and named him ""the Oracle of Santo Domingo"" all because he let a canadian-based gold mining corporation named Barrick started raping the land and destroying the environment of the island.

This isn't even the first thing, our democracies have been shown to be a farce, with legislation that the people are actively protesting being negotiated in secret and ratified against our wishes. Not so long ago file sharers were being sued for millions of dollars, or simply threatened with action in the hopes of thousands of dollars in settlements. The music and movie industries pushed for the ability to be judge and jury for third party accusations leading to three strikes, and you would be denied the greatest tool mankind has ever created, the internet.


And that is what is at risk here, the greatest tool for exchanging ideas and information that has existed in the history of mankind and may pave the way in future to new democratic models, education and open discussion of subjects that would otherwise be suppressed. We've seen unprecedented insider coverage of the uprisings in Egypt and Libya, exposure of human rights abuses by governments trying to brutally repress their people in Syria, and the list can go on. The unifying response by corrupt governments who want to hide their actions is to censor the people, and block social networking websites.


In the west, our free and open internet and the right to access it are also under threat, not from a bloody murderous regime, or a dictator but the entertainment industry. Are you kidding me? The peddlers of petty distraction, over-hyped rubbish music and film, these are the people taking a small percentage of their profits and using it to bypass democracy, with expensive lobbying throughout the first world? The people who brought you commercialised rap, Justin Bieber, Transformers 3, Star Wars 3D re-releases, this is the industry damaging the greatest tool mankind ever created? In the name of their profits for the garbage that they peddle? I can't believe it only it is happening right now, and has been in the works for years! Old media is protecting its outdated pre-internet business model for physical disks of data and tickets to noisy theatres when many of us have thousand dollar home entertainment systems and high-speed broadband.


It is a sick joke, and we have tried to use our democracies to block the legislation dreamed up by these people, and the greatest insult of all is that our elected leaders are listening to the contrived arguments and padded figures of this industry, one which is frankly irrelevant, and this leads me to my response.


We are the target demographic, it is our money which makes these industries huge, it is our casual and habitual consumption of cinema tickets and DVD's, Blu rays, cds and so on that funds these companies, and a percentage of that money is put towards damaging our rights to a free and open internet, instead of investment in modern digital distribution models, it is put towards subverting democracy. We stop giving them money.


The Kony 2012 video demonstrated the power of the internet today, while I cannot make a fancy video nor am I a master of social media, I don't have to be, this is an idea whose time has come and you and everyone who reads this has the power to fight back. We must be vocal, we must spread this idea, and boycott old media. Their motivations are monetary and we can send a loud message by saying that we will not stand for this and we will hurt them where it matters, in their wallets.


I personally feel sick at the thought of the young man from the UK set to be sent to the US, an unprecedented action where someone who never set foot in a country, is set to stand trial there and likely be imprisoned there. I get this feeling any time I watch one of my DVDs, or when I look forward to seeing The Hobbit, or the new Batman film.
I will not pay to see either of those films, I will not pay for a DVD, Blu Ray or CD, I will not prop up this industry who does not respect the value of the internet or democracy itself. This from an industry whose contribution to humanity is petty distraction for a couple of hours.


This can be hard, but it doesn't need to be. New media offers plenty of entertainment, wikias, discussion forums, youtube, podcasts or new independent artists are all embracing delivering media in a modern open way. Comedian Louis CK saw unprecedented sales of his DRM free, direct downloaded show which I bought a copy of myself. Bypassing the old dinosaur of physical distribution more money went to Louis and the people who made that video and facilitated its distribution digitally, and we the consumer got a better product.


This is an idea whose time has come, that we can vocally fight back against this industry, that our ideas can spread like wildfire online if enough people agree, and that we can be heard now. We can hit back at their profits, the only thing they care about. We can make this idea spread if you can help.


#boycottoldmedia can trend on twitter, we can share the link to this thread if it gains ground, up-vote this thread if you want to see this idea discussed. Someone could set up a basic website, we can share and suggest new entertainment mediums, some of the channels on youtube are very professionally done, share new artists with each other, support new media business models and so on.


This has been heavy on my mind for a long time, I hope you agree and are willing to help.

**Boycott them, and make sure they know why.**

----

Edit: A good point was made in the comments, that this must be decentralised with many 'campaigns' to succeed. As an example of the power of social media I pointed to 'Kony 2012' and the success of the decentralised aspect of that campaign, the part where people shared the video and spread it exponentially. The failing point of that campaign was the centralised source, the entity driving the campaign and questions about it's legitimacy. With the recent controversy, the campaign lost momentum.

This idea is different, it is a response to something that has been on our collective minds for many years now, many examples as I listed above of corporate bullying of ordinary people, of subversion of democracy. This idea is organic on on our collective mind, the large scale protests and responses to ACTA and SOPA show this, the subsequent failure of our politicians to oppose these acts showed the unfortunate reality that the money behind the scenes was still more important.

If we can take the momentum and determination of all the people who opposed those acts, we can include a boycott into our tactics, and without needed a central driving force. Simply sharing your thoughts on this topic online, mentioning it to friends and most importantly, not giving these companies your money, you can have a direct and real effect on these companies and affect their prime motivator, profit.

All I did was post up my idea, you guys have run away with it. When this thread falls off the trending topics I will post it again! You can do the same, you can do more, you can get on twitter, start a blog, whatever, I will continue to do my part, I hope others do too.",,False,self,t5_2qh9a,True,,,True,t3_r9w2v,http://www.reddit.com/r/worldpolitics/comments/r9w2v/the_entertainment_industry_has_been_fighting_a/,

1371569242.0,430,self.worldpolitics,1gl7ig,I propose Reddit begins and spreads a Brazil World Cup boycott.,875,445,180,http://www.reddit.com/r/worldpolitics/comments/1gl7ig/i_propose_reddit_begins_and_spreads_a_brazil/,"A huge amount of World Cup investments revolve around audience. Sponsors, other companies, even the government hosting the Cup, get a huge amount of publicity. Those commercial slots costs millions. I don't think I need to explain the pricing mechanism.

So here's what I think we should do, as the potential audience. Not watch this World Cup. Not on our TVs, not over the internet, nor listen to the matches on the radio. There isn't long to go, and we shouldn't have a short memory. I've watched every single World Cup there's been since as long as I can remember, but I'm sickened by the Brazilian government's response to these protests. Like other major international sporting events, the country hosting the games should be an example to other nations on all fronts. 

As a football fan, I think the situation has become a disgrace towards the World Cup tradition. I hope FIFA is starting to wring its hands with worry, and rightfully so. And I think that the best we can do as outsiders is hit the government where it hurts: its pockets. It's exaggerated response surely stems from its desire to show internal political stability in order to attract World Cup investors and audience. So we let them know in advance that we won't be watching.

Considering the government's behaviour, and the reasons behind the protests in the first place, Brazilian citizens don't seem likely to reap the rewards of World Cup investments anyway. 

I know skipping a World Cup, in Brazil no less, sounds tantamount to heresy in the football world. But, as fans, we shouldn't let sports be tainted by undeserved privileges (which hosting the World Cup is), or by political masquerades (we've seen those before); and as human beings we should fight to protect peaceful protests, wherever they may be taking place.

I doubt Brazilians will be enjoying the World Cup very much after this week's events. I don't see why we should be any different.

**TL; DR** We should protest the Brazilian government's actions by not watching the World Cup, in the hopes that investors will be less willing to pay top dollars for commercial slots and other sorts of publicity, thereby damaging the government's economic enterprise. The cash probably wouldn't be used for the citizens' benefit anyway.

I'm sure most of this information is new to you considering the considerable lack of media reporting on the issue. FYI, I'm a Palestinian refugee from Lebanon. Here's the [proof](http://imgur.com/7DcO8).

Let me start with a couple of countries:

**Lebanon**

Around half of the 400,000 refugees live in camps, deprived of many rights. Refugees don't have any property rights, no access to the Lebanese healthcare system and there are certain restrictions on jobs we are allowed to do. We are issued handwritten [travel documents](www.passport-collector.com/2011/08/10/lebanon-refugee-passport-for-palestine/) of appalling quality (large size, cheap paper). The travel documents don't even have a full date of birth, just the birth year. You probably know about the Sabra and Chatila massacre (from the movie Waltz with Bashir, perhaps my favorite animated movie) were 3000 Palestinian civilians were killed in cold blood. These are at the top of my head, I'm sure there's more. This is what a British MP Gerald Kaufman said in 2011 when he visited the camps:

&gt;When I went to Gaza in 2010 I thought I had seen the worst that could be seen of the appalling predicament of Palestinians living in conditions which no human being should be expected to endure. But what I saw in the camps in Lebanon is far worse and far more hopeless. The conditions are unspeakable, but for over 400,000 of our fellow human beings this is their life: today, tomorrow and for a future that cannot even be foreseen. At least in Gaza, frightful though the situation is, the people are free within the confines of their blockaded prison. In the camps of Lebanon they are not free.

**Syria**

Surprisingly, refugees there are treated quite well, almost like a citizen. Although this is changing and the Palestinians are being forced to choose sides in the Syrian uprising.

**Jordan**

It's the only country that naturalized Palestinians after the annexation of the West Bank, perhaps because they needed the population back then. From what I know from my family members living there, there's some discrimination between the natives and Palestinians, but it's minimal compared to other Arab countries.

**Kuwait**

Kuwait [expelled](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestinian_expulsion_from_Kuwait) more than 450,000 Palestinians when Arafat declared his support for Saddam during the Gulf war.

**Iraq**

Palestinians enjoyed full rights under Saddam's reign, however after the 2003 war they were severely targeted with discrimination or killings and the majority fled the country.

**Egypt**

You can read [this](http://www.fmreview.org/sites/fmr/files/FMRdownloads/en/FMRpdfs/FMR20/FMR2013.pdf) report here. Not only are they discriminated against (no free education) but they receive no UN assistance whatsoever. If they go out of the country for more than 6 months, their residency permit might be revoked. Imagine being born and living in a country your whole life and needing to renew your residency permit every couple of years. Also, a little bit about the occupation of the Gaza strip by Egypt, one observer (a member of UN) noted that ""For all practical purposes it would be true to say that for the last six years in Gaza over 300,000 poverty stricken people have been physically confined to an area the size of a large city park.""

-----------

I'm sure there's more but these are off the top of my head. Also, for a Palestinian refugee it's very hard nowadays to get a work visa to Gulf countries. I was accepted for an internship in Dubai for an American bank but I waited for the visa for 1 and a half months and it never came. I had to relocate to another office. This isn't anecdotal evidence, many complain about this.

Moral of the story: Israel naturalized over 1.5 million Palestinians. They enjoy full citizen rights and many of them would remain in Israel even if a Palestinian state is established. Palestinians in the Arab world on the other hand suffer from discernible and vile discrimination. If a non-Palestinian Arab speaks of the maltreatment of Palestinians by Israelis, tell them to STFU and demand rights for Palestinians in their countries before they complain about Israel.

We only have elected representatives and our, currently, crappy ""democracy"" because, historically, it was unfeasible and logistically impossible to include everyone in decision-making as a group. As a result, a representative for each population is chosen to vote and speak on their behalf and vote on a consensus. 

So many problems have arisen from this: lobbyists, corruption, closed doors voting, etc.

Well, now we DON'T need to outsource our vote anymore. We have the internet now. It is now feasible for everyone to be informed and vote on everything in real time. The tech exists, the logistics exist and the methodology would not have to be too different from what it is now. 

Why do we still outsource decision-making to representatives when we can do this ourselves? 

A true democracy can be had with the internet. Get rid of politicians, who needs them anyway?

**Identifying the creditors and why they have precedence over the future lives of whole nations of people?**

Think clearly about this for a moment.
""austerity"" means your lives will be less free for decades.
Since all nations are ""in debt"" to extreme then their must at it's core be a group of private creditors benefiting from this situation.

governments everyday have the moral right as representatives of the people to weigh and balance private citiziens rights against those of a small minority of other citizens. This happens with other individual citizens property rights being sujugated to community interests in processes such as eminent domain everyday.
It is moral and right for the governments to identify the core group of private people hiding behind all the debt shell entities who are supposedly ""owed"" money by these countries citizens. Those citizens likely never voted for the debts anyway. Collectively the governments should all subjugate all these false debts to the rights of the people in a national worldwiode form of eminent domain. 

Austerity for millions is not an acceptable situation to recognize diffuse, ill borrowed, non voted, ""debts"" often made by politicians serving the very ""creditors"" rather than the people.


Millions of people should not be forced into a lifelong form of loss of freedom (which is what ""Austerity"" really means on an individual level for each citizen) as a result of putting false debts unto the backs of their governments.

1357415340.0,352,self.worldpolitics,160r7y,"Rape Math: All factors considered, US has 3x the rapes of India, 1/5th the convictions",780,428,288,http://www.reddit.com/r/worldpolitics/comments/160r7y/rape_math_all_factors_considered_us_has_3x_the/,"The following statistics, compiled from government reports and media articles consulting anti-rape campaigners and government officials, show that when factoring in under-reporting, limiting the definition of rape strictly to rape (including date rape) to account for varying legal definitions of sexual assault, and factoring in population, **the US has slightly under 3 times the number of rapes per year as India -- and only one fifth the number of rapists end up convicted of a crime.**

India reports [24,000 rapes/year](http://blogs.wsj.com/indiarealtime/2013/01/04/statistics-conviction-rates-for-rape-across-india/); but it is estimated by anti-rape human rights activists that [90%](http://indiatoday.intoday.in/story/The+iceberg+of+rape/1/46911.html) of India's rapes go unreported ([which is sadly, the same number as in England](http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/05/28/AR2008052803583.html)).

In the US, [85,000 rapes/year](http://www.nytimes.com/2011/12/15/health/nearly-1-in-5-women-in-us-survey-report-sexual-assault.html) are reported, and although many victims also don't come forward, the reporting rate is much better, at about [54%](http://bjs.ojp.usdoj.gov/content/pub/pdf/vnrp0610.pdf) of rapes not reported (to give the US an advantage in its reporting rate, we can round down to 50%).

The US has roughly 1 quarter of India's population (US has 300 million, India has 1.2 billion).

So to compare them, we multiply the US' numbers by 4 to account for population difference, and then double them to account for underreporting. that is 85k x 4 x 2 = 680,000 rapes/year in the United States. We take India's and multiply it by 10 to account for under-reporting, we get 240,000 rapes/year in India. Factoring in under-reporting (which is pathetically low in India, the UK, and the US -- although admittedly way better in the US than the UK or India), **the US still has slightly under 3 times the number of rapes as India per year.**

As for the law -- conviction rates for accused rapists, India is atrocious -- with the US and UK even further behind!

Conviction rate in India: [26%](http://blogs.wsj.com/indiarealtime/2013/01/04/statistics-conviction-rates-for-rape-across-india/)

Conviction rate in the US: [5%](http://www.rainn.org/get-information/statistics/reporting-rates)

Conviction rate in the UK: [5%](http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/05/28/AR2008052803583.html)

**Rapists are convicted 1/5th the time in the US/UK compared to India. India's conviction rate is itself astonishingly low, and the conviction rate in the US/UK is in the single digits.**

If anything, India's rape crisis is atrocious, and the rape crisis outside of India, namely in the US and UK, is even worse. So blaming India's culture/nation for rape is, if anything, a way to distract people from the even worse rape crisis in some parts of the West!

Also, factor in the fact that at least India is engaged in mass protest about the rape epidemic.

The main one is for a restructuring of the electoral process in a country that has had the same governing party for the past 50 years.

What wont be in the news however is the shear force trying to counter the effect of these rallies. Today a full 24 hours before the organised demonstrations there have been road blocks from all points of access to the 'allowed' point of assembly. Just so support is not as strong as propagandized main thoroughfares have been blocked such that even normal citizens have been delayed in excess of 4 hours without any form of notice or reason outside of simple rumor.

The source of this whole unrest is a far more interesting matter. Malaysia from 1981-2003 was led by Dr Mahathir Mohamad a charismatic fellow who envisioned a islamic inspired capitalistic democracy. Having been in charge for so long he was corrupted by a messiah complex that lead to a rather weak heir to his legacy who was overturned quite easily by stronger forces in the ruling party. This new force (Najib Razak) has a rather colourful history. There have been allegations of morally objectable action with a mongolian model who was found blown to pieces by a grenade along with some other more questionable accomplishments.

This has led to a rather forced march to global acceptance and respect to further profit a ruling class that is inundated with corruption and nepotism.

Thus we are at present day with an unhappy growing middle class, a passive upper class, and an easily swayed general populace. With growing unrest in relation to equality issues and other issues we have a culminating rally to restore Malaysia to some form of former glory.

N.B. I am not without bias nor prosaic incompetence. I only wish for discourse and evidence to promote more attention on our affairs.

1325891153.0,255,self.worldpolitics,o61ef,Some misconceptions that I keep seeing about the current Iranian situation.,318,63,102,http://www.reddit.com/r/worldpolitics/comments/o61ef/some_misconceptions_that_i_keep_seeing_about_the/,"I'm no expert on Iranian affairs, military, or politics, but in discussions here I keep seeing some errors that keep getting repeated as though they were gospel. If I make any mistakes in the following, I'd appreciate them being pointed out with a citation to a reputable source (Wikipedia entries are fine as long as they have source citations). 

A lot of people already know these, but I think a lot more don't.

**Mahmoud Ahmadinejad is the leader of Iran.**

The President of Iran is not the leader of Iran. Political power is largely held by the [Supreme Leader of Iran](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supreme_Leader_of_Iran), the position currently held by [Ayatollah Ali Khamenei](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ali_Khamenei). The position of President in Iran has severely limited powers that are purely domestic. The position has been defined by some as a ""glorified mayor.""

**The President of Iran is going to try to destroy Israel**

Some have pointed out that Ahmadinejad's comments regarding Israel being ""wiped off the map"" can be translated as referring to the political entity, not the people itself, but it doesn't matter. Ahmadinejad has [no say in Iranian military matters or in foreign policy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/President_of_Iran). His opinions in these matters are irrelevant.

**Ahmadinejad is too loony to have control of nukes**

Mahmoud Ahmadinejad has [no say in Iran's nuclear policy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mahmoud_Ahmadinejad#Nuclear_program), military matters, or foreign policy, and even things he does have a say in can be vetoed or overridden by the Supreme Leader, and in fact have been.

**Ahmadinejad is representative of Iran's religious leadership**

Actually, they seem to really really [hate him](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2011/10/19/ayatollah-khamenei-ahmadinejad_n_1019233.html). During the violent riots against his re-election, [several major clerical figures](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stance_of_Marjas_on_the_2009_Presidential_Election_in_Iran) in government either opposed his re-election as invalid or fraudulent, and [others seemed to come down on the side of the protesters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2009_Iranian_election_protests#Clerics).

**Iran's military is a joke**

While they wouldn't be able to withstand a full scale assault by the US military (who could?), Iran has [a pretty impressive military](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Armed_Forces_of_the_Islamic_Republic_of_Iran). Half-a-million active military personnel, plus about 11 million reservists. They have a modest [arms industry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_military_equipment_manufactured_in_Iran) of their own, and enough marine mines, missiles, and torpedoes that they could do enough damage to tanker traffic (or threaten to) to [shut down oil flow through the Straits of Hormuz for several months](http://www.thefinancialexpress-bd.com/more.php?news_id=92875&amp;date=2012-01-06) if they wanted to. The US could easily sink most of their navy, or at least the bigger stuff, but Iran has a large fleet of fast smaller vessels used to fire anti-ship missiles, launch torpedoes  (including the scary [Hoot supercavitation torpedoes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hoot_%28missile%29)), and distribute a lot of [marine mines](http://iranprimer.usip.org/resource/irans-military-doctrine), including an Iranian version of the fairly deadly (even to large aircraft carriers) [Chinese EM-52 rocket mine](http://www.strategycenter.net/research/pubID.117/pub_detail.asp).

**Iran is building a nuclear weapon**

The IAEA actually reports that Iran's nuclear program, which is currently energy-related, looks like it could quickly be converted to a program which would make Iran [nuclear-weapons-capable](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_program_of_Iran). This means that they're currently (mostly) abiding with the nuclear treaties they're party to, that they continue to allow international monitoring to prove they aren't building weapons, but that the IAEA saw signs that they think mean that at some point in the future Iran might be capable of starting a nuclear weapons program if they want to. So not only do they currently not have a bomb, they aren't developing them, and they aren't even capable of building a weapon at the moment should they want to. But they might want to in the future. Either way, any potential Iranian nuclear weapon is years in the future, and the world would have plenty of warning that they were actually building one (they'd stop allowing inspections, for one thing).

**EDIT** - an example to clarify the difference between a nuclear weapons development program and being nuclear capable: Lets say that I decide that someday I want to build a gun in my basement workshop. There are certain steps that I know I need to take before I can even start. I need to understand metalworking, how to use a lathe, know how to make gunpowder and bullets, and understand something about explosions and basic physics. I can buy a lathe, learn metalworking, take chemistry and physics courses, and even apply some of those useful skills to other stuff *without actually making a gun.* I'm just getting to the point where I can make one if I want to. When I actually decide to go ahead and start making one, you'll see all kinds of bright flashes from my basement, hear loud noises, see metal and chemicals being delivered, that kind of thing.

What the IAEC report shows is a lot of signs that Iran is at stage one, developing the skills, technology, and infrastructure that they would need to develop a nuclear weapon. Stage two will be when they have the knowledge and equipment, and that's what's called nuclear capable. Even then, they still won't have an active weapons program. Stage three is when they actually decide to go ahead and build it, and that's actual nuclear weapons development. At that point they won't be following their treaty agreements, so IAEC inspectors are told to leave, and they start producing weapons grade nuclear material. Even then, they'll likely be several years away from producing a working military weapon that fits on a missile.

But that's assuming they will want to go ahead with it when they have the ability. By then, the political and military situation may have changed and they don't have any pressing need for nukes. But their reasoning is likely that it's better to have the choice to go nuclear and not need it than it is to want to go nuclear and not be able to because you haven't done the years of preparation first.

Disclaimer - I don't think anyone should have nukes, especially in the Middle East. It's a dangerous neighbourhood. But perhaps that's why they may want the option: there are four nuclear powers in the general neighbourhood already (five if you count all those nukes floating around in US Navy vessels in the Gulf).",,False,self,t5_2qh9a,True,,,True,t3_o61ef,http://www.reddit.com/r/worldpolitics/comments/o61ef/some_misconceptions_that_i_keep_seeing_about_the/,

Maximum estimate - 1'033'000



[2007 Article on Iraqi death estimates in war on terror](http://www.globalresearch.ca/index.php?context=va&amp;aid=6848).

At the time of this article the 'official' count was 75'000. The article cites [a study that found about 75% of civilian deaths in conflict zones go unreported](http://harvardmagazine.com/2007/11/counting-the-war-dead.html). Referencing other data the article estimates it could be as high as 1'200'000. Five years ago.

Considering the implications of that study, the likelihood that even the higher estimates are most likely very conservative, and that these numbers are from only one of the countries this 'war on terror' encompasses, it seems very probable that the US's war on a word has killed more than 1'200'000 civilians in the past decade. 

And if we compare american and non-american civilian fatalities; for every single american civilian killed by 'terrorism' on and since 9/11 in this war between 40 to 400 non-american civilians lay dead. 

The US total losses in the 'war on terror' is ~9'000 (military and civilian). If the war on terror has caused an even million deaths, including americans, then US fatalities are 0.9% of that total. Even if this 'war' has only killed half of that then american fatalities are still less than 2%.

These results are interesting due to the sheer number of new political entities that running for Parliament. Píratar, the Icelandic Pirate Party, one of the newer entrants has enjoyed growing support since it's formation. The most recent poll confirms that the Icelandic Pirate Party are now the second largest among the new political parties with [3.9%](http://mmr.is/fylgi-flokka-og-rikisstjornar). If this pattern continues it stands to reason the Pirates will get 3-4 seats out of a possible 63 in the national parliment, instantly making them the worlds fastest growing Pirate Party.

The major policies of the Icelandic Pirate Party are reform of the copyright system, creating a more transparent government  and fostering honest dialogue about the role of the internet in national security, freedom of the press and the economy. Their role is to stand guard for the free flow of information, especially those for whistle-blowers and journalism. They have already proposed a parliamentary resolution to integrate decriminalization of drug usage similar to the Portuguese solution. The Pirates have also created an online voting system for the party that any Icelandic citizen can take part in, facilitating true steps towards practical direct democracy.

**EDIT**: [The Pirates in Croatia are running for the EU Parliament and are showing a whopping 6.4% in a poll so I guess they must get credit for being the fastest growing Pirate Party](http://piratetimes.net/ppeu-the-zagreb-summit/).
