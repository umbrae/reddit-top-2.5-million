I should probably start off by saying that I am not as much of a ""fanboy"" as some of the people out there, but I have been using Macintosh computers for some time now, and until very recently, have thought only positive things. 

So yeah, the point behind this post was to tell you what happened to me over the last 24 hours. I own the 27"" quad core iMac. I am not going into why I purchased it, or any form of justification for the huge price tag, but I will go into why I now hate it.

Last night, whilst doing nothing graphically demanding, the display went black.

So I forced a shut down, and then rebooted, heard the (in)famous start-up chime, but no visual. Tried again. Same result. Spent hours on forums. No solutions. Only advice was ""You better hope that you are still under 'Apple Care' "".

Probably worth pointing out that I am not under Apple Care ($3k machine, 1 year warranty, things are now looking stupid in hindsight ). Please don't tell me I should have bought the extra warranty.

So I went ahead, did the whole ""Make an appointment with a 'Genius' "" bullshit, lugged my 50kg-awkward-as-fuck computer around the local shopping centre, to find the Apple Store. Another thing I would like to point out is there are like 2:1 employee:customer ratio, and no one fucking helped me carry this beast in.

Basically the guy behind the counter did a lot of what I did, and then told me that ""there seems to be a problem with the display"", and then outlined what will happen if I leave it there.

 (NB the order in which they would try to fix the problem)

First: They would replace the current display with a new one, if that fixes the problem, it will cost somewhere around $800 AUD

what. the fuck.

THEN they would move on to seeing if it is the video card that needs replacing. And due to that piece of shit begin integrated with everything else in the fucking machine (to save space), it would probably cost something ridiculous too.


So I basically just walked out, and have now been spending about 45minutes looking at /r/buildapc 

If anyone reads this, and is considering buying a Mac desktop, please think about it seriously, and if you want, I would be happy to answer some questions, but in this state of mind, will probably just link you to

So I went ahead and built one, its live at [www.smugg.com](http://www.smugg.com). I've been aggregating new tech products for the past month, but I haven't told many people about it. 

To make accessing the content as simple as possible, I have setup a twitter account that relays published products. E.g. a tweet would be ""Macbook Air. 12 Critic Reviews. 86%"". If this is useful, then please go ahead and follow: [http://twitter.com/smuggdotcom ](http://twitter.com/smuggdotcom  ) 

If there are other ways you think i should make available e.g. google+ feed, then let me know and i'll setup it on the site.

We want to refrain from Cloud Computing, Fiber to the Home, or anything else that has pretty much been beaten to the ground (at the undergrad level) already.  The best topic we have come up with as of yet was AT&amp;T's U-Verse, but unfortunately there just doesn't seem to be much raw technical information on it (all I get are pretty much advertisements, and I can't write a 60 page paper on advertisements!).

It would be great if these switches were actual hardware and not dependent on the OS to function. That way it would avoid the problems finding the right keys in windows/linux, installing proper 3rd party or OEM software, and eliminate the lag.  Just a few buttons and maybe rolling dials, a dimmer on the side of the screen for brightness (and an on/off switch!), a volume wheel on the front, a wifi on/off switch (I've seen a few of these but not often on netbooks, my vostro has a wifi finder switch).

While I'm dreaming, how about: a hardware mp3 player with it's own headphone jack and controls (like old desktop CD drives that could function as players), external monitor port works immedietely from boot, a cpu speed adjustment dial (like the old ""TURBO"" mode buttons on 386's), keyboard LED switch/dimmer.

Some use a media player per screen, which is expensive.

I have heard people utter the line ""you can't **actually** delete a file in windows"" and I'd like to explore this further, maybe get a discussion going.

My understanding is this: when a file is deleted in windows, the file remains stored in memory and the *reference* to the file is deleted. That space is freed up and may be used in future, but for the time being the actual switches in the HDD are still in the same on/off positions and they will remain like this until they, by chance, get written over by something else.

1. If this is the case, how is it possible to retrieve a file after a few months of use? Surely if I deleted a file, several months down the line the chances of that portion of memory that it occupied being [mostly] untouched by new data is highly unlikely. Is is possibly to retrieve a file a few years after [conventional] deletion, and if not, why not?

2. Programs like ""Fileshredder"" work by 'deleting' the file, then writing over the memory location with 0's or 1's *many times*. Why does this need to be done *many* times? Surely once they are all turned to 0's or 1's, it is simply gone? Even so, I have heard of people deleting something with Fileshredder and then, just to test, successfully retrieving the file using data recovery software.

X-Post from /r/tech,22,5,8,http://www.reddit.com/r/computing/comments/ffeix/something_i_did_for_my_colleagues_to_resolve_a/,"I work as a Construction Estimator / All-round IT computer guy. I work for a fairly prominent REIT/General Contractor, so professionalism is a must in every piece of work done.

This company has just recently become large/wealthy. They never really had to deal with large files. It was always 2 Mb files sent over e-mail. Being the IT guy here, I was asked to look into FTP and such. Basically, they wanted to send files to clients and make sure that our domain name showed up as the link for the file. Our webhosting wasn't exactly flexible or easy to talk to when it came to space/ftp accounts etc... So I had to get around this problem. Fast. While playing chess on my laptop, I came up with a solution, a brilliant one.



I'll do my best to keep it simple.

Made a pro-100 Dropbox account.

Installed dropbox.

I forced dropbox to accept a shared folder as a working directory. Via pyDropboxPath. (At the company we use a dual-Xeon box with multiple accounts and use VNC to log-in to our respective accounts.)

I made a shortcut on every account's desktop for Dropbox's public folder and showed them how to drag-and-drop and get a share link. My colleagues couldn't believe how easy it was.

But then, it got better.



I dowloaded AutoHotkey and wrote a 4 line script which triggers when the Clipboard buffer in Windows is accessed at any time. It then looks for ""http://dl.dropbox.com/u/#######"" (dropbox uses a static number for your account) and replaces it with ""http://mywebsite.com/fileserve"". I compiled this script into a replacer.exe file of 200kB and modified the Box's registery policies for all users Windows/Run to include the execution of replacer.exe.


I logged in to our site's FTP and added this to .HTACCESS


""redirect 301 /fileserve http://dl.dropbox.com/u/#######"" effectively, this modifies www.mywebsite.com/fileserve/filename.ext to http://dl.dropbox.com/u/#######/filename.ext when a user requests it from the site. Dropbox then forces a download. 


 ####### signifies your unique and static dropbox user number.


Almost 0 bandwidth is used up by your own website. Note that our company does have an unlimited 25D/25U line. So the sync process is seamless.

I even created a webpage that captured this dream with inside pictures of the bar and interactive vector links to explore and find out more information.
I was looking at street view because I wanted to see if there was a trail view for national parks, there isn't. But when I returned to the city mode there was and it brought me back to an old idea. How cool would it be to click on an establishment and be able to view the interior, read a menu, find information about the owner, health regulation scores for a kitchen, and the like. I was too ambitious too early 15 years ago, but I can actually see it now.

Even the education that you can get online is coming to fruition. Khan Academy, Code.org, Duolingo, can make everybody equal in terms of education and the beautiful thing is that you don't need to attend a university you can build the skills you need to succeed in today's environment for free. I do wish they would provide some sort of certificate at the end of their courses so that future generations can print out their accomplishments to show employers.

1) So I've been told that processors became more powerful over time as engineers found ways of making transistors smaller and smaller while at the same time increasing the clock speeds that they could reliably deal with. However I've also been told that one processor can only do one operation at a time. So while I understand why speed can increase the productivity (can do things faster) of a processor I don't understand what more transistors will do (can still only do 1 operation at a time). 

2) What constitutes 1 processor operation? Is it reading 1 bit? 1 byte? 1 memory address? Preforming an operation on a series of bits/bytes? Maybe even more?

The problem is, too many videos and audio files are shared out with ridiculously low volume levels. So I have my speakers turned up so they are audible, but then other videos or games are recorded with good audio levels that end up blaring with the speakers turned up.

Using the volume sliders per application, many of the applications are set at less than 5% volume, but even that doesn't work well enough when one youtube video is at one level and the next is ten times as loud or soft. and then every new app starts of at the speaker level, which is usually far louder than I want it.

Is there any good way to get some level of normalization of audio on the fly? I know for most cases, the software has to get the whole range of volume to set the max level of the file.

The only thing that I am wondering is if anyone actually uses the colemak layout and if it is actually faster/better to type on than qwerty, is it easy to switch back to qwerty (I have to do labs on school computers)?

Describe what you want, and if it's a doable little project, I'll make it for you!

As an example, about a year ago I built [jGrep](http://www.digitalgemstones.com/code/tools/jGrep.php), a cross platform file searching tool.  Nothing groundbreaking, but I find myself using it all the time, and I enjoyed making it.

Some things people have suggested include a personal recipe manager, a weight-loss/fitness/exercise tracker, and a customizable movie showtime application.  These all seem like things that already exist and/or would be better as mobile applications, but if there's interest, or you're not satisfied with the options that already exist, I'd be happy to make something for you.  I'd love a challenge, so all the better if it's something I don't know how to do off the bat!

Technical details: I intend to make this in Java with Swing, because I'm bored and, believe it or not, actually like playing with Swing.  It'll be cross-platform and available as a JNLP (so you can run it straight from the browser) as well as a Windows executable, if you want to install it locally.

I love as many pixels as I can get. I have a ThinkPad W500 with 15.4"" 1920x1200 display, a ThinkPad X61T with 12.1"" 1400x1050 display, Android phone with 480x800 display etc. On the two laptops, I just love how much information I can fit on a small, high-res screen, and on the Android I always keep my text scaled as small as possible.

When searching for ways to scale down the text on Android, I see nothing but people trying to make text bigger because they can't see shit. On Windows and Mac, I only see people asking how to make their text bigger because they can't see shit. I have (somewhat) bad eyesight, but I still love small, crisp text. I don't understand why there's only a push to make text **bigger**. When reading an email or SMS thread on my phone, I would like to read more than 15 fucking words at a time.

Just looking around for different laptops, it seems that more and more manufacturers are completely foregoing any concrete information about screen resolution. They just call everything HD. I've been thinking about replacements for my X61T, but there are literally no tablets with a high-res screen. My X61T from 2007 has a 1400x1050 12.1"" display, while the newest X230T can't offer anything better than an ""HD"" 1366x768 12.5"" display. WTF? Why are we going backwards?

Apple seems like the only company with a clue, but they're just using the Retina displays to make the same size stuff look sharper. The one and only exception I can find is the MBP w/ Retina display; OS X lets the user scale bigger **OR** smaller. I'm actually extremely happy that Apple is pushing their Retina displays. Hopefully the rest of the industry will get a clue... 

Clearly we have the technology to make extremely dense displays. Take projectors for example - they can pack 1920x1080 in a tiny LCD to project through. Why are we still stuck with 15"" laptops with 1280x800 as the norm? Does anyone else like pixel density as much as me, or am I broken?

I've got a laptop. Three months ago it was brand new and I ran a few benchmark programs on it and got pretty decent results. The X3:TC benchmark came out at an average 58fps, which is fine for me. Three months later I benchmark it and get an average of 30fps. 

It's a very noticable difference, I started playing League of Legends on a stable 50-60fps on the highest settings which was really nice, of late I play with the lowest settings and a very unstable 20-35fps. That's a huge drop in quality.

Today I've defragged my computer, uninstalled everything I don't use, cleaned up my hard-drive and ran anti-malware and spyware programs. The boot-up speed has significantly increased but the benchmark result is entirely unchanged.

Any suggestions for what's caused this / how to fight or repair it?

My computing question is, what's the benefit of something like a PowerxCell 8i over a GPU? The Radeon series (6870s are cheap on ebay) are rated at over a TFLOP. Why on earth would anyone spend all the money on an Intel Blade system when a bunch of video cards can (or can they) do it way faster and cheaper? Where and how does NVidia's Tesla and Keppler series play into all of this? FURTHERMORE, AMD just announced their Sky Series due out later this year for GPGPU cloud services. Will this be better? (AMD has already earned some loyalty in me for their graphics cards in gaming and minor tinkering in OpenCL.)

What am I missing here? Why do gov'ts and supercomputers choose to compute with systems like these over GPUs which are rated cheaper and faster? And in turn, for my small computing project (pure number theory-type stuff, not much needed other than sheer power), what should I use? I'm fine sinking the money into a Blade if I need to... but do I?

Thanks.

Edit: weeks of googling have culminated in finding great stats on [wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radeon_HD_6000_Series#Radeon_HD_6800). The 6870s don't have support for double precision floating point operations, but their latest flagship, the 7970, clocks in at over a [teraflop](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radeon_HD_7000_Series) of double precision for [$400](http://www.newegg.com/Product/ProductList.aspx?Submit=ENE&amp;DEPA=0&amp;Order=BESTMATCH&amp;N=-1&amp;isNodeId=1&amp;Description=radeon+7970&amp;x=-1166&amp;y=-112).

Basically I want it so they can go right to the network (rather than using the internet) and log on to this server. Then they can FTP or put lolcatz all over the wakaba board to their hearts content. 

I don't want it to connect to the internet and I am hoping to put just enough security on it that it requires a password for users to log on to the server. Or maybe it should connect to the internet? So they can access if from anywhere? 

I am not that technically literate, but I am highly computer literate. I've been on the computer since the age of two and have grown up messing around with computers. However, I have only really ever done so on a CONSUMER level. This means that the only programming experience I have had were quickbasic and just enough html to change round my old myspace page. 

I can learn quickly if need be. I am just wondering if it is worth trying to undertake this project, of if I will just be frustrated the whole time because I have no clue what I am doing.

After being powered off for a few minutes, it will boot into Windows, but within a few minutes starts artifacting and eventually goes blank again.

The second replacement worked fine for months, but just died a couple weeks ago, showing some extreme artifacting when temperatures rose above 60C. After removing load and allowing the temperature to drop, it returned to normal. 

After the first 5870 fried, I bought a Sapphire 5870 with plans to Crossfire with the XFX upon receiving the replacement. The Sapphire has not had a single issue, and temps were consistently 10C cooler than the XFX when running Crossfire. 

After the last 5870 fried, I bought an MSI 7950, which also has not had a single issue. I don't get it.

Hey guys.

I'm looking to get BF3 running beautifully (and other games) I feel that my processor / Mobo is bottlenecking my graphics card, how accurate is this? What could I upgrade that will make a good impact on performance at an affordable cost? It runs games fine already, but I just feel that something is holding it back as it can become quite jittery with certain games..

Sorry if this doesn't make a lot of sense, I will edit if necessary. Any advice is very welcome!

As I understand the TOR system, the entry node knows who you are, but not where you're going or what you're doing, whereas the exit node knows the exact opposite. Is that the case?

Therefore in particular, am I right in saying if you're on a local network and using TOR to connect your computer to the internet, traffic snoopers cannot determine what you're doing (because your traffic is encrypted and your destination disguised), only that you are using TOR to do something?

I need a raid format hard drive and required network hardware.  I'm not opposed to any prebuilt machine.  My intentions are to have the pc server that my employees can connect to it from mac computers setup with remote access.

EDIT
Thanks guys for all the help sorry to be behind in my replies as this is my first post and, well, I just found them...

The current situation is that I require a redundant place to store all my company data, while still creating virtualized windows computers.  The unfortunate thing about using mac computers in construction is that most of my software (accounting, cost management, CAD, and Estimating) are run off a windows platform.  Most of all is that I require remote access to all of these tools if I'm out of the office or my book keeper wants to work from home.  I'm not opposed to isolating ALL data to its own storage device either raid 1 or I believe 3 (multiple drives)  The only reason why I like having multiple drives is that I have gone through 2 drive failures and hate the little things that get lost.  

The reason why I need virtualization is so I can keep people from storing data on their own computers.  Anything company, I need in one secure spot because people take their computers to site, lose them, damage them, and it ultimately leads to more costs.

The programs will be simple word processing, excel, accounting (probably Business edition simplex accounting) and the estimating is also a database program combined with light CAD features.  CAD is not a priority as I currently use a Mac edition

Currently I have received some help but it was advised I go with a Dell T410.  I really didn't think my requirements were that intense,

Firstly, my plan is to purchase an Atom mITX board and use that. I already have a 1TB hard drive that I will use till I need another. I figure it wont need more than a gig of ram...FIRST QUESTION is that assumption correct?

I only plan on using this for file storage. It's more convenient then carrying around an external hard drive. But I want it to be accessible from outside my home network. I've ran an Apache server from my desktop computer before, so even though my ISP might not like it I know it's not something they will instantly shut down. 

What I want to happen is this: I would like this server to appear as a drive letter on my laptop, so I can actually have a media player like Zune reference it correctly. So an FTP server is outta the question. I think they way I had it set up before would work, but I never tried to assign it to a drive letter; I always just accessed it through the internet browser.

Should I use Linux? I wouldn't do Win7 or anything, but I have a copy of WinXP I could install on it. Can Linux support attaching itself to a drive letter like that? Is there *any way* to attach an external http file server to a drive letter? 

Thanks for any advice/experience you can give me on this.

EDIT: Ok I went ahead and purchased a mitx cpu/motherboard combo, found one on-sale for $65. It actually supports some ram that I already have extra, so that's one less cost. I already have the hard drive, and I have a case that *might* work. It's pretty old, so IDK if it supports mITX. I figure I will start FreNAS and go from there. I assume it supports everything I need.

I don’t mind using two different companies if need be. 

Computer 1 (Grad student work computer)
I need at least 500GB of storage to back up 3 years of data.  Currently I have two internal drives both 750GB.  One is used strictly to back up the main drive.  I would like more of an automatic back up set up.   Access to individual files from multiple computers is a plus.  That way if I forgot a file at work I have access to it from home.  I normally keep my most current stuff sync with a 300GB 2.5” portable drive for traveling but you know how that one file gets left behind. 


Computer 2 (home laptop and external USB hard drive)
I would like a more of an online storage type account with automatic backup.   I would want access to my files via the web.   The laptop only has a 30GB hard drive and the external drive is 750GB.   Currently I have about 200-300GB of data on the USB drive.
I don’t always have the USB drive plugged in, it more of a long term storage drive.  It is where I keep all my pictures and other files I want but don’t need access to on a daily bases.  

I’ve looked at Dropbox, Mozy, Idrive, Backblaze, and Carbonite.   It seems the external drive is making it difficult.  I’ve also read that if my Laptop drive is only 30GB but I have 200GB of data this might cause issues.  

So I know turn to the hivemind experts.   Anyone else I should be looking at?  Good or bad experience with these companies?

in a couple of last years it has became obvious, that a category of portable computers with a keyboard (originaly called laptops or notebooks) is artificially divided into four subcategories - notebooks, netbooks, ultrabooks and, with a success of tablets, convertible laptops. All subcategories consist of devices of x86 architecture (though ARM getting stronger), so they could be treated as equal from computational point of view (ergonomy doesnt count now). Some category was presented like a clue for customer (""Do you wanna small facebook machine? Choose netbook!), something is a trendy stuff (convertibles), some is a marketing/advertising brand (ultrabook) and some has become vague and undefinable (notebook? it is hyperonym or what?).
Problem is, when somebody tries to choose a new ""notebook"", eshops and sellers offer devices strictly according to these labels. It is not good for usual non-tech user, who often become fooled (A: what a fucking price tag! B: but, sir, ultrabook! A: Omg, youre right! Ill take it.), nor is it not good for tech-customer (like me), who doesnt like these artificial labels a wants choose a device according to technical parameters. That has become more difficult, because you dont have bunch of machines to compare, but three to four strictly divided categories. When you are looking for the most, for example, lightweight device, you must be true researcher (overstatement). At least, that is the situation here in Europe/EU (i dont know market in the US or rest of the world, but i think it is propably the same).

What do you think, do these categories have their reason, or not?

Additional question: does exist some service or e-shop which allows to compare products without these labels?

My background is finance and economics. I am trying to figure out which companies it would make the most sense to acquire NVIDIA or AMD.
I think the obvious would be Intel to acquire one or the other. But I am not an expert in semiconductors, and in order to drastically cut my research time could someone give some input? Other companies I was thinking that may play into this are:

* Arm
* United Microelectronics
* Qualcomm
* Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing
* Suggest others?

Main reason for asking is because I don't know the nuances of these companies, I know NVIDIA has a hand in the mobile area which could help QCOM or Intel for example, but I don't know much about how easily will it integrate or if it makes sense in terms of the different architectures and what not (this goes for any combo of companies).

Also as an aside - I am currently beginning to explore learning Python and hopefully get into PyOpenCL, NumPy, and perhaps PyCUDA. NVIDIA vs AMD, in terms of using GPU's for parallel computing/GPGPU for computational finance and data crunching, which would be superior? CUDA or AMD's Stream/FireStream (not sure what it's called).

At my university students use Live@Edu which is a Microsoft product and faculty/staff use Microsoft Exchange. Would a provider like Gmail be better? Specifically:

1) Can the Microsoft be used in the same capacity as other email systems as far as organizationally (such as google docs and google groups)?

2) Is there an even better alternative than Gmail?

3) If the switch was made to Gmail, would it make is more stream-line and easier for all parties involved to send campus wide emails to specific groups, such as a specific offices' emails to students campus wide vs. departmental emails to a smaller group of students?

4) Since google docs eliminates the problem of having incompatible versions of Microsoft Office when opening an attached email, is it a good thing for a campus which does in fact have a lot of Macs in use on it?

5) Since there are many free programs that can do all of these things, as well as having students forward their email to another account, do we leave troubleshooting the IT system here up to individual students to customize at their leisure or should we, as a progressive liberal arts university seek an alternative that provides a better interface for all students on campus?

I don't know if Im asking the right questions, so please inform me if there is something I completely haven't noticed.

Basically my internet is working wirelessly, but not wired. It'll work temporarily wired and then just go down for no reason. I'll change ethernet port on the hub and it might or might not come back up depending on which port and then eventually go down....and repeat.

2) If this is the right subreddit:

My mom is 62 and has saved up some money for a new computer. Her old desktop is 8 years old, making a lot of noise, absurdly slow and almost literally falling apart save for the bolts holding it together.

She relies on the computer for 3 things:
1 - E-mail;
2 - Revising the church bulletin on Word;
and 3 - Downloading and organizing images from her digital camera.

My initial advice to her was to switch to a MacBook, since it would last her longer with the same performance. Her worries about this are (a) it's more expensive and (b) she might not adapt to the new interface.

I know from experience that PCs don't last as long as Macs in terms of performance, and they get obsolete more quickly. Am I wrong in thinking this? Have I drawn the wrong conclusions?

Furthermore, if she were to buy a PC, is there anything I should prioritize in terms of technical specifications?

TL;DR: Mom wants a new computer. Will she adapt to Mac? Does it last longer? If buying a PC, how to choose?

I have all those components for my pc and wish to keep them. I have an Albatron PX865PE pro (http://www.albatron.com.tw/English/product/mb/pro_detail.asp?rlink=Specification&amp;no=52) which this computer was working but is not letting me pass the last known configuration screen.. also the CPU for this motherboard is reading at 61 degrees Celsius

This other motherboard I have is a Asus which i know is a better company but it was handed down to me via a friend because it got ruined some how.  I am not sure whats wrong with it because the power supply wont boot up.  This motherboard is a Asus K8V Se Deluxe...

But anyways what I want to do is keep my AGP graphics card, and my 2 Gigs of G skill pc3200 ram and my hard drives.

I just want the best motherboard cpu comobo which has AGP capabilities and will take my ram... and if possible if the mobo has pci express slot for future upgrade if i want to swap the card out or something.  I am not sure if this is all possible but it would be great if someone can find me a solution. 

I also want to find a better sound card that creative labs 5.1 is a pos.

I'm an intern at a film production company and I've been given quite a dubious task. I need to find out wether or not it's possible to scramble a skype-conversation live and with certain timing. Do you guys think it's possible? And if so: how?


More info concerning the project:

In the film the protagonist is in Congo, skyping is girlfriend in Holland. The director wants to dramatize how hard it is for the girl to be in a situation where your man is far away and in constant danger, so in the script the skype-conversation keeps dropping out. But of course, we won't be filming in Congo: both the actors will be in Holland; basically they'll be in the same room... We want to be able to control the level in which the skype-conversation is being scrambled; like from very clean to very scrambled. I've been thinking in ways to do this, like holding a piece of metal (or maybe a magnet?) against a stripped UTB cable or covering a router with insect screen (like they do [here](http://www.extensiontech.net/articles/howto/gs/wifiblock))... Do you guys have any other suggestions? ",,False,,t5_2qx6z,False,,,True,t3_qn51g,http://www.reddit.com/r/computing/comments/qn51g/can_i_scramble_a_skypeconversation_on_purpose/,

I work for a well-known international education resource that you will have heard of, but I cannot identify (this is a speculative inquiry for the present). This body has an amazing archive of (free) educational material that would be incredibly useful for anyone trying to get into a particular field, but mostly it sits online unread by many of those that would benefit. At a recent meeting I mooted the idea of an app that could push interested parties towards the right material, alert them when new material was published online and offer personalized tips and training opportunities to those signing up. The idea was met with some enthusiasm by our directors, but it was quickly squashed by our IT department for money/resource reasons. My questions are: in theory, how difficult would it be to develop the appropriate app? What are we talking about money-wise? And would it make a difference cost-wise if the app set out to further education for the public good rather than make a profit? Happy to answer any qs, and aware this is all very fuzzy at it stands, but this is a serious query, and it would help me make a case for an app from a position of some knowledge, if you guys/gals come through, thanks.",,False,,t5_2qx6z,False,,,True,t3_1e8vbh,http://www.reddit.com/r/computing/comments/1e8vbh/advice_on_programming_an_education_app/,

Win7 sees two NTFS partitions:  OS and Recovery, and can see files in the Recovery partition, but will not even give me properties on the OS partition.

Linux (systemrescueCD) sees, reads and can copy files from the ""dead"" drive, including the OS partition that Win7 chokes on, but Gparted reports inconsistencies in the OS partition and will do nothing with it and admonishes me to run DOS Chkdsk /f twice on it before trying again.  DOS chkdsk run as admin from WIN7 command prompt reports that it cannot be used on a RAW partition, so here I hit a wall.

Obviously, I want to clone the dead OS partition to the new drive, mostly to work around issues I will have with a huge iTunes collection.  I am such a noob with Linux that I cannot figure out a way to do it without being able to do a complete repair of the bad drive, which apparently cannot be done.  

I need a comprehensible set of instructions if it's easy enough for someone.  I also need to learn Linux.  I know.

Typically, I get between 20-30 in a batch, and right now the process seems slightly inefficient. Use two flash drives, one with Mini XP, one with the imaging software and actual image, 8 minutes per laptop. It works, and can be sped up with multiple flash drives going, but I'm trying to see if there's a better way. I have a few ideas, I was hoping you guys could tell me if any of these ideas sound feasible, or point me in the direction of a better one. 

I have enough outlets for all laptops, and enough switches to ensure every laptop has a connection. My immediate thought was trying to find a USB hub that did live switching from one device to multiple PC's, but I quickly realized that isn't a thing. My current top candidate is this:

Put image and software on C: of my laptop. Write script to map network drive to that folder for the laptops to be imaged, run script, have each one run at the same time, then unmap the drive. My concerns with this revolve around throughput; am I going to be wasting more time waiting for the images to load because I'm going through Ethernet rather than USB? I don't have the exact figures for average transfer speed I was running today, but it was around 1,000 MB/minute. If I'm imaging 25 laptops at the same time over 2 home switches am I going to match that?

I guess that was actually my only idea, I just realized my other one was stupid.

Again, I'm not asking for the answers handed to me, I'm just curious to know if I'm on the right track. I really want to impress the higher-ups, and if this is a stupid idea or won't save much time I would rather use the effort on another project that has a higher chance of working.

The problem is that many of these games (**designed to run on Windows 95/98**) are 16 bit applications. I am running **Windows 7 Home Premium, 64 bit**. Win7-64 can run 64 bit and 32 bit applications, but not anything smaller. I have used DOSBox to run much older games and SCUMM VM to run certain games. But I'm currently unable to run games which are newer than DOS, older than XP, and non-SCUMM VM supported.

I know that users of Windows 7 Professional and higher have free access to Microsoft's Windows Virtual PC and ""Windows XP Mode,"" which is a virtual machine running a licensed copy of Windows XP. However, I don't really want to shell out another $75 just to play old games that worked under XP. :\

So far all I can think of to run these games is using either an emulator (DOSBox or SCUMM VM) or a virtual machine. However, I don't know any Win95 emulator other than Wine (which doesn't run on Windows, I actually checked to see if there was a version that does). And I don't own a retail copy of Windows XP or Windows 95/98. I have licensed copies, but they are OEM copies.

I had a crazy idea about running Linux under a VM in Win7, then running Wine under the Linux VM, and then running my 16 bit games under Wine. But that is serious **I N C E P T I O N**  territory, and it's probably not a good idea.

I am currently a High School student and while I don't need it right now for school we have had projects that could use it and after school activities (like a Model UN Conference where a laptop would've been helpful). I figure I've been saving up my money pretty nicely and so it's time to purchase a laptop. I have a pretty good desktop computer that I use as my central command so to speak. So gaming wouldn't be necessary on the laptop Here is what I need from it:

HDD: Nothing fancy, min of 320 GB or so

Processor: Just good enough to run things. I may run programs that take excess cycles and use it for research or something but even then meh. I'm not gaming so I don't need something amazing

Memory: Probably something pretty decent. I hate slow computers and while I know how to maintain ones sometimes even the best maintaining can't save you... Overkill is not needed, I will probably use the laptop for documents, internet, music, etc. (very netbook type activities I guess?)

Optical Drives: CDs are going out of style so not needed

Hubs: USB hubs would of course be important but I don't really need much else.

Battery: I love a longer battery but I make do with the weakening battery of my 2 1/2 year old iPod Touch so maybe just something above average here.

Video Card: Not gaming with this machine. If it can run movies fine then I'm cool.

Screen: I have been spoiled in the past year or so. I have a 1600x900 22"" at home though before that I had a tinier CRT so I don't need something excessive. 11"" is fine.

Operating System: No Apple. Period. Of course if it's Windows 7 then I would want good RAM/memory.

Price: Ah the king here... While I could spend about $1,500 that would clean me out very nicely. I prefer something cheaper and may consider sacrificing my demands for something cheaper. Ideal cost is around $700-900.

Durability: I'm a very careful person but nothing too fragile please?

I decided to open the shell, disconnect the SATA to USB, and plugged it directly into my computer (SATA) thinking it should work just as before. Now, it is recognised by BIOS and Device Manager only, and I can't do anything to get the thing fully recognised. 

Live CDs and GParted views it as unallocated space. I decided to run GetDataBack to see if it could bring it back, and after hours of searching, it can't find the disc. 

My next step is to buy a new SATA to USB dock and hope it works through there as it previously did before, however I don't mind it being internal.

In special cases, a class needs specific software, so to do this, we have to install on each individual computer. We also use a program called DeepFreeze to wipe prevent students from making changes on the computers, and they're all networked via Novell. I believe we have two desktops in the back room currently acting as servers.

Based on the little that I do know, is there a program which would allow us to push out updates to our different lab rooms easily, so I don't have to spend 2 hours going computer-to-computer with an installation CD?

Was wondering if anyone can help me pick out a decent laptop. Budget is £600 ish.
This is going to be secondary machine for me. I already have a decent gaming desktop setup in another room. 
I'll mainly be using this laptop for a bit of light photoshop use and a bit of web development. 
Id also like to use my laptop for a bit of audio editing and dj'ing. I use programs like Abelton, &amp; Soundforge. 
A big screen would be a bonus as it will allow a better workflow in the programs i use.
Id also like to be able to run windows XP on it as i have quite a lot of old VST plugins that id still like to use with Ableton and soundforge.
I dont really need portability or a lightweight machine as this thing will be living on a table in my frontroom so a desktop replacement would be good.
What i do want though is something rock solid which will last and be stable &amp; reliable.

I have 3 monitors, all of which are connected to my main computer via DVI.

From left to right:  17"" 4:3 | 24"" 16:10 | 17"" 4:3

Consider them numbered 1-3 from left to right, as well.

In addition to its DVI connection to the main rig, monitor #3 is also connected to my server via VGA.

I have already found how to make [scripts](http://forums.nvidia.com/index.php?showtopic=142414) to turn SLI off and on, which is necessary to be able to activate more than two monitors - I currently have a pair of 9600GT cards.

So two questions:

1: Can anyone point me to a different script that toggles SLI on and off rather than needing two separate scripts?

2: Can anyone recommend display control software that will allow me to individually turn monitors 1 and 3 on and off quickly and easily?  My regular setup has 1 and 2 assigned to my main rig and 3 assigned to my server.  I want to be able to turn 1 off before launching single-screen games and I want to be able to turn 3 on and off easily, though that still requires that I press a button on the monitor to switch inputs.

If an improved script for toggling SLI on and off is possible, I'd love it if there were a way to integrate the different commands so that if I am adding monitor 3 to my main rig's extended desktop it will toggle SLI off as part of that command, and toggle it back on when I remove 3 from the extended desktop.

The final caveat is that I'd like for whatever solution is used to be able to remember monitor placement.  Every time I use the Screen Resolution panel in Windows to turn off monitor 1, it forgets where it was placed and I have to manually arrange the monitors again when turning it back on.",,False,,t5_2qx6z,False,,,True,t3_hu4o9,http://www.reddit.com/r/computing/comments/hu4o9/need_help_with_multimonitor_control/,

* Windows 7 Home Premium x64
* i5
* 4gb ram
* 500gb hd


Questions for you:

* I've decided to go with a security suite. I am currently using BitDefender, but hear good things about Norton Internet Security 2011 anyone have experience with both?
* Anyone have any experience with over/underclocking and/or undervoling these machines?
* All the programs below good / anything I'm forgetting?
* Any additional tweeks?
* Should I torrent win 7 ultimate? It'd be nice having a legit version of windows for a change. Anything really vital I'd be missing?
* Anyone have experince making a bootable recovery partition? If yes, can I password protect it somehow?
* Can I use Hamachi to encrypt all my web traffic?

* BIOS Password
* Deselect other boot devices
* Go through all other BIOS settings.
* Xmouse
* Turn off UAC
* Degrade Graphics to classic
* Remove Windows Components (control panel, go to programs and check ""Turn on or off Windows features"")
* Update Windows (Conflicted over this. Should I f'n bother? Yae or nae?)
* Sandbox Explorer (Folder Options &gt; View &gt; Launch Folder Windows in a Separate Process)
* Configure Guest Account (How can I lock this down tight? I'm only setting it up so that if stolen, someone will be able to use it, connect to the internet, and thus let me track it down.)
* Install Apps. (See below)
* Go through msconfig (services/startups)
* Go through Task Scheduler just in case
* Look into undervolting http://forum.notebookreview.com/hardware-components-aftermarket-upgrades/235824-undervolting-guide.html
* Look into over/underclocking
* Ghost when perfect (http://support.wdc.com/product/downloaddetail.asp?swid=119) (Not too much exp. here. This is where the recover partition would come in, if possible.)
* Porn Binge

This question is posted on both r/computing and r/askreddit.
So here’s the deal.   I’m planning my wife’s 30th  surprise birthday party.  She has family all over the U.S. that she does not get to see them often.
She never sees them.  She’s usually pretty upset about missing family time during the holidays.  
Fast forward to today…Her brother and I are planning a surprise party for her “with a very small twist”.  So here’s the challenge:
**Goal:**  
I would like to have her family across the U.S. see and listen to the “surprise” moment.
**Equipment:**
Laptop with built in web cam
Option of either hard wired or wireless internet connection from the surprise house.
Conference Brige*
**One Small Advantage*:**
Thanks to work, I have a permanent conference bridge assigned to me.  Her family can dial into the bridge for AUDIO.
Dilemma:  
How can I have everyone access a site where the VIDEO of the party is being broadcast?  Preferably from the laptop displaying the video.

EDIT - Everyone thanks for your feedback.  This should def be a nice surprise for her.",,False,,t5_2qx6z,True,,,True,t3_e39dk,http://www.reddit.com/r/computing/comments/e39dk/group_video_chat/,

It had been laying on a carpeted floor under my bed, not plugged in, untouched for a month or two. There was nothing else near it or touching it. Could static from the carpet have corrupted it?

I had my battery replaced back in August I believe and I think there's a problem with it that I can't seem to figure out. The light that shows when my computer is charging blinks when I have my computer on, whether it's plugged into the charger or not. When it's not plugged in, what happens is that it works for a good little while then just suddenly dies. It gets to about ~35% if I had to estimate and suddenly dies. No warning, and it wasn't showing that the battery was close to being low enough to give a notification. When I turn the computer back on, the battery icon is at 7%, which doesn't make sense. Anywho, noticing this is how I figured something was wrong with the battery, and then I saw that the light blinks. Now every time the laptop dies I have to take the battery out and put it back in (or else it won't even charge or turn on). Then I plug it in, turn it on, and wait for the battery to charge back up. Since about a week ago, the amount it tops off charging the battery to decreases just about every time I turn it on, and it says the battery is no longer charging once it reaches that point, no matter how long it's plugged in for.


* I've already tried changing all the advanced power settings back to default. Does not seem to make a difference.


*I could take it to Best Buy, given I have their protection plan. This is a replacement battery though, and if I remember correctly they only replace it once under the plan. Plus, Best Buy usually charge an unreasonable amount of money for the simplest of tasks, such as storing all the information from an old hard drive onto a portable one ($100!)......


*Is there any reason as to why this just started happening to this computer? If there is a way to find the problem on Windows, where do I find it? Nothing in the battery icon on the toolbar is useful in figuring this out.

I know this sort of thread must come up all the time and it is part born of laziness, part of ignorance on my part.

The time has come to begin considering a new laptop, possibly for purchase in some form of January sale. The lazy part of my query lies in the fact that I can't be bothered to scroll through the thousands of machines out there on the market. The ignorant part stems from my laptops age. I bought my current laptop 5 years ago. With love, care and affection we have nurtured each other beautifully 'til now, but the old girl is starting to get tired these days so it's time for a new investment. 

I did a lot of research for a long time to get my thumb on the pulse of the industry at the time of buying my current laptop, but since then, haven't been following it at all. I don't know what brands are the best, what standard of processor I should expect to handle which tasks, what is the benchmark of RAM these days? Do I want a netbook, notebook, or ultrabook?

I JUST DON'T KNOW.

Here's where you, hopefully, come in.

What my new machine must be able to handle:
Word processing, fast internet browsing, handling large quantities of data for processing e.g. Excel workbook with many thousands of entries, comfortable for typing/mousing (ESSENTIAL), and other general user stuff like films, a small amount of gaming, syncing wirelessly with my smartphone via bluetooth/other, BATTERY LIFE, reputable brand.

Not essential:
Large hardrive, ability to play blu-ray, ability to play HD video in general, DOES NOT NEED TO HANDLE PC GAMING.

Budget: £500 - £650 / $781 - $1015.

The reason I thought of this is because I'm a DJ who just got a new laptop. Suppose I have a folder of hundreds of gigabytes of music that I want to sync across a desktop and at least one laptop. I want to be able to drop/edit files in there; however, my laptops have much more limited space than my desktop does.



I want to be able to see all the files that exist in my main music library, in case I decide I want to browse through my music library- in case I, for example, want to play an older song or mix an unusual mashup. I don't want to fill up my laptop's hard drive with tons of songs that I'll probably never use; however, there's still the chance that there's that [ONE Lamb of God song](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqdZpxkzNvc) that I just know I could get to work with something [more geared towards a dance floor](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6blgjF6UkU), so I need something that can sync individual files selectively. A well-executed ability to upload back would also be helpful, but not necessary in this particular scenario. I also can't stream the file- I need to be able to use it in iTunes, Ableton, and/or whatever DJ software I'm using.



Any ideas if anything like this exists?

After a couple hours of setup troubleshooting, I found the list of ""supported"" hard drives, which is surprisingly short for a 500$ item. None of my drives were on it, so i printed out the support list and took them back. None of the local tech places carry ANY of these hard drives because they are OEM. [Frys Electronics etc.] 

I went to 4 different places to purchase the hard drives on there support list  [http://www.readynas.com/?page_id=82].

(There is no list of supported drives on the box)

I was appalled at the blatant service cop out of only supporting 20 OEM drives.

""WARNING: Be sure to use only drives recommended in the compatibility list, otherwise, NETGEAR Technical Support can and will deny support.""

A call to tech support proved this to be true. 

Its quite sad, I took these back and purchased another model that supports most of the new drives. I'll steer away from Netgear Products in the future, that is for damn sure.

What is the process of setting it up like? I've read about the Intel ME in the BIOS, but theres not much information about it.

When looking at sites that [estimate the needed power](http://extreme.outervision.com/psucalculatorlite.jsp) for my setup I get an estimate of 319 Watts which is quite low. I currently have a 600 Watt ps and my best friend with nearly identical setup has a 680 Watt supply. Now we both use [Lavalys Everest (renamed AIDA64)]( http://www.lavalys.com/products/everest-pc-diagnostics/) to monitor system statistics. 

Lately my friends system has been cutting off during gaming and I suspected it was due to temperature as he has his rig in a work style desk that has limited circulation but upon inspecting and comparing our system logs found that we have very similar operating temperatures. What I did find however is that his voltages were recorded as varying a bit (talking ~.05V or less) where as mine stay steady at their values. I also noticed that a few of my values were not exactly where they should be (3.3 = 3.81V , 5.0 = 3.76V), is this normal or do we both possibly have ps needing replacement?

So I was pretty much wondering if anyone with an “overkill high quality” could possibly send me/post their performance logs so I could compare with the hopes of being able to confirm or rule out the power supply being the issue? Would also be interested in any constructive comments.

**TL;DR: Someone with overkill quality power supply please post/send me performance logs that include voltage ratings while under load…**

I have a Macbook Pro from 2006 that I’ve used throughout college. A few months back, I started having issues with my keyboard/trackpad, specifically with the ribbon cable connection inside. Long story short, I no longer have a working keyboard and trackpad. I’m out of the warranty and the simplest solution for me has been to use an USB external keyboard and mouse with the computer. This has been fine and I’ve had no other issues with the computer.



Fast forward to last week. I decided to use Bootcamp and install Windows 7 on my computer. Everything went fine and I was able to use the Macbook as a fully functioning Windows 7 with my external USB keyboard and mouse, albeit without a functioning internal keyboard and trackpad.



But here is my issue today that I need help with. For some reason I guess I left the laptop powered on overnight, and rather than it going into sleep mode or simply powering down, the laptop stayed on until it ran out of power. The next morning, When I attempt to turn it on and use it, I’m presented with this “Windows 7 Error Recovery” screen http://www.techjaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/win7-error-recovery.png



The issue is that I can’t use the arrow keys on my usb keyboard to navigate to either of these options and select. The computer will not recognize a usb device while it is in this mode. I’ve tried everything I can think of to fix this; restarting the laptop and trying again, restarting and trying to boot into my Mac OS partition, etc. From other forums online where people have posted with a similar issue, the answers seems to be to use a PS/2 keyboard, which the W7 Error Recovery will recognize. But I don’t have that, what can I do?



I’m fine with completely deleting the partition and solely booting from Mac OS, or even wiping the HD clean and reinstalling OSX from my time machine backup. But what options do I have?

I have an HP laptop running Win7 Home Premium.

I put the disc in the drive and rebooted, and followed the install instructions and put Ubuntu on the partition on the ext. HDD.

This wouldn't be a problem, but now I am unable to boot Win7 (even though it is on the internal HDD) if the ext. HDD is not connected. The extent of my understanding is that I cannot boot because GRUB is looking for a partition that isn't there. 

Ideally, I would like a situation that allows me to keep my Ubuntu install on the mounted HDD while still maintaining the ability to boot Win7 when it is not connected. 

Less ideally, I would like to completely remove Ubuntu and GRUB from my system and return to the normal Win7 install from before.

The other day I got hit by a virus of sorts, which mimicked antivirus software (claiming that I had viruses and could fix them all if I just ""click here!"") and eventually caused my computer to do a hard restart. To make a long story short, I was not able to make it past the startup screen after that, despite trying safe mode, last known good configuration, etc. 

As a bit of a background, I am a student on a limited budget, had just had my current antivirus expire, and had (foolishly, I know) not installed AVG or anything else to replace it. It was a dumb move, and I'm quite repentant of it now. I am running two hard-drives in my computer, a 300GB IDE drive and a 500GB SATA. The 300GB has been my main drive for a while, and I've been running Windows XP off of it. There has been no OS on the 500GB drive. 

To correct for the mishap I have installed Windows 7 onto the 500GB drive, and have left the 300GB disconnected as I went about the installation. After downloading AVG and Malwarebytes to the 500GB, I reattached the 300GB, scanned it, caught a few items on it, and rebooted with XP from the 300GB. I ran into the same issue as before; I cannot get past the load screen.
My dilemma is this: I am a student and a club president. I have, on my 300GB drive, emails, documents, and a plethora of other items that I need desperately to keep up with the semester. Email is especially an issue for me, and I am at loss as to where to go next. Is there anyone on this subreddit that could lend me some advice?

I know that PS3's need FAT32 but when i looked at reformatting the drive there is no FAT32 only exFAT and NTFS is there anyway that i can get the drive to be FAT32 or any other way to get it to work with my PS3??

Using Task scheduler on windows, you can then set tasks for your computer to carry out, and then switch back off. I was wondering if you could do this, and then use some sort of script to enter a search query on a site, and then have it automatically start downloading something. For example, say i'm at school and i wanted to have a new movie downloaded before i got home, would it be possible to set my computer to turn on at say, 1:00PM, open chrome, and then run some sort of script to enter a search query and start downloading said file? I ask this because i get throttled around peak times, making it almost impossible for me to download things when i get home, unless i stay up to the early hours of the morning.

入力 - シングルスコアを生成します。
出力 - スコア入力に最も近い一致を検索し、応答

ストレージの出力スコア：
スコアの範囲は、ハッシュぼやけごとにグループ分けされてい
たとえば、次の

出力1、2、3グループに割り当てられています
出力4、5、6はグループBに割り当てられています
出力7、8、9はグループCに割り当てられています

出力のグループのカスケード更新が常に発生します。
出力の各グループは、たとえば、そのバージョンの一意のハッシュがあります。

グループのバージョン1ハッシュを持っている

そして、入力が一意にスコアに必要な場合に生成され、その後に基づいています
この時点で、グループ出力（：グループなど）が正しく選択されている
システムは、ローカルグループの最新のコピーによって更新されているかどうかを確認
グループのハッシュバージョンを比較する。

たとえば、次のように

スコアエントリは、グループ内にある
あるグループの現在のハッシュ
ハッシュを持つグループに照会され、正しい出力が決定されます

ただし、グループの最後のハッシュは、（グループの日付の）Bと思われる場合
グループはその後更新され、改造されています。新しいハッシュは、更新のグループ、ハッシュ更新に一致した場合
グループのチェーンにコピーされ、発信応答を疑問視されています。ただし、ハッシュの新しいグループ
更新システムはチェーン内の前のグループにフォールバックするように、失敗して一致していません
以前のバージョンはどれですか。

アップデートが失敗した場合は、このシステムはリアルタイムで更新することができますが、フェールオーバーグループ。

チェーンのアップデートの量は、使用可能なスペースによって制限されます。

したがって、グループ1のグループ（基本的なインストール）を含むすべてのチェーンの最初の実行。
次に、取得するために適用された新しいグループが解放され、以前のグループには、チェーンを上に移動します。

たとえば、基本グループ1は、インデックス0でインストールすると、インデックスの更新が到着し、1です。
インデックス1のハッシュは、インデックス0の位置を入れ替えるように有効が確認された更新
だから今は、インデックス0は日付とインデックス1までである以前のバージョンです。

今すぐアップデートが来る、2番目のインデックス2であり、検証されますので、インデックス0、0、上記のインデックスが1になり、インデックス1は2になりますが、次のようになります。
0 - 2番目のUpdate（プライマリ）
1 - 最初の更新
2 - 元のインストールベース（古い）

この場合も、例えば、スペースが許す限りであり続けている
0から1000000までの更新
1 - アップグレード999999
2 - アップグレード999998
...
999999 - 元のベースのインストール

クエリは、常に最小のインデックスに移動し、それが有効なバージョンを見つけるまで、チェーンを移動します

検証のハッシュを提供するだけでなく、少しのステータスを提供するアップデートに加えて：
0 - グループがアクティブである
1 - グループが無効になっています

問題が発見された場合は通常のリリースでは、常に0に等しい指標であると更新は、彼のマーカーをオフにする必要があり
ので、今のホールの問合せチェーンは、私は障害者のグループをスキップしますとき1にセットされます。ブロックする必要がありますこのように悪いが更新されます。

障害者のグループは、例えば、保守操作中に削除されます

メンテナンスの前に：
0 - グッド更新C
1 - 更新Bを無効
2 - グッド更新

メンテナンス後：
0 - グッド更新C
1 - グッド更新 ""


スペースがなくなるような出血が発生します。 e.g：

0から1000000までの更新
1 - アップグレード999999
2 - アップグレード999998
...
999999 - 元のベースのインストール

空き容量：0

その後、更新がこの更新プログラムをインストールするには出番、最高インデックス（および古い）は、例えば、999999は、ムッとされます。

0から1000001までの更新
1 - 更新100万
2 - アップグレード999999
...
999999 - アップデート1（元のベースをインストールした後の最初のアップデート）

これは、システムができるだけ多くのアップデートを保存することができます

クエリはカスケード接続可能であり、スコアの更新は（通常）増分であるため、アップデートを格納するためのシステムのための理由があります。例えば
我々は、システムのアップデートの3セットが装備されていることを言う：

0 - アップデート2
1 - アップデート1
2 - 元のベースのインストール

元のベースは、10項目が含まれ、更新が1と1の変更を追加し、1 2変形例1を更新し、追加します。
ときにそのようながない対応を持っていない場合は、1つ、最終的に2かどうかを確認し、最初の場所で更新2かどうかを確認するために実行される入力クエリ。
これは、更新の基本的なインストールを確認することにより、彼はそれをチェーンの最後に最新のアップデートを見つけることができ

試合はその後アップデートのどのグループにも見つからない場合はマッチを移動した（スコアの検索を例えば+ /求められている - 1または何が最初に来る
グループはアップデート+と-1の両方に一致した場合、返された結果）がランダムである

そのスペースが最後にデータベースの一部が失われることを意味し使い果たされた後に更新がチェックアウトされているので。
このプロセスはとても時間がかかるので、瞬間から失われたコアのインストールでは、十分な増分更新されています。
実際のデータの損失はほとんど最小限になりますが、これはまだ問題があることを確認します。

ソリューションは、ストレージを増やすことです。アイデアは、それがメモリ空間が不足するので、時間がかかるので、徐々に限界まで増加させるべきであるということです
到達することはありません。それは、それが何らかの理由で達成されている場合、あなたには、いくつかの答えを失うことになりました。これは別の半マッチはより頻繁に発生する可能性が発生したとき。

失われたデータは、種子の2バッチの融合から派生させることができます。

一度スペースが不足している更新に追加された逆の順序で、チェーンの最後に再追加することができます。
新しいスペースを追加するには、障害が徐々に老衰と可能なディストリビューションセンターになりますが、これは数千年かかることがあります。

更新構造は次のとおりです。

（インデックス） - （ハッシュアップデート） - （ハッシュグループの範囲）/（スコアファイル）

例えば、

1326853975.0,1,self.computing,olstd,How to best use the Drobo S for home media storage? Help me devise a better system!!!,2,1,3,http://www.reddit.com/r/computing/comments/olstd/how_to_best_use_the_drobo_s_for_home_media/,"I have had my Drobo S for awhile, and am looking to upgrade this convoluted way I'm storing and serving up my LARGE video collection.

Look here for a diagram to help you understand my set-up:  [diagram](http://i.imgur.com/LaBgH.jpg)

I originally planned to just plug the Drobo S directly in to one of my PS3's USB ports, but the PS3 would only recognize it formatted as FAT32 and below 2tb.  When the Drobo broke up into what a windows machine sees as multiple 2TB drives automagically...  the PS3 could not see ANY of the files on the Drobo.

So, I reformatted the Drobo to run as a Linux HD, and then had to install Ubuntu on my old laptop and have it run PS3 Media server to route it to the PS3 and on to the Television.  This works, but the old laptop is getting old, and runs HOT and LOUD!

I have a ReadyNAS Duo that I hoped would recognize the Drobo, but it wouldn't cooperate... so now it handles all my BitTorrent downloading and temporarily stores downloads until I transfer the files to the Drobo for long term RAID storage.  The ReadyNAS also operates as my Time Machine back-up device for my MacBook Pro.

With the loud IBM laptop kind of in need of replacement, I'm looking to try and make the system simpler...  and maybe more intuitive for people other than me...  instead of having to access files through the PS3.  Especially with my brand new Samsung ""SmartTV"" that can sense the ReadyNAS and plugged in FAT32 HardDrives, but not my Linux Media Server.

Does Reddit have any suggestions?  Maybe an easy ""off the shelf"" quiet linux machine to just replace the laptop if nothing else?  (Do off the shelf Linux machines even exist?  The extent of my Linux experience was messing around with this system to just get it to work a year or two ago)

&gt;**TL;DR:  I have a confusing Media Storage and Playback system.  Can you think of a better and easier to manage, to store, and to access my 8 TB of .avi/.mp4/.divx files?**",,False,,t5_2qx6z,True,,,True,t3_olstd,http://www.reddit.com/r/computing/comments/olstd/how_to_best_use_the_drobo_s_for_home_media/,
