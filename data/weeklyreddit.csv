###/r/Hookah 

A very old tradition that has come back to life and is quite fashionable as of late. A great way to get people together and have a fun time as a group. This smoking device is quite simple and if made right, is far more enjoyable than even cigarettes. From the huge variety of flavors to mix and match from the possibilities are endless.

###/r/Scotch 

Sit down and pour yourself a drink. A man's drink. Savior the delicate blend of all the dried fruits, citrus and spices. Scotch was wasn't made in one day, so enjoy every tiny sip. If you've become bored of your fruity drinks give a hit of Scotch a try, you'll grow some hair on your palms.

###/r/Cigars 

They say the finest cigars are from Cuba. I say, a good cigar can be from anywhere, as long its made with heart. Personally cigars may not be my style, but if you've ever get the chance, go to a cigar house and enjoy one. Its a great experience. You may be surprised at how much you enjoy not only the company but the cigar smoking experience.

###/r/bourbon 

I know nothing about Bourbon, but I'm sure someone else can fill in for me.

###/r/BarBattlestations

My newest hobby! After I built my awesome gaming PC I was so eager to post in /r/battlestations, this is the exact same thing but for your own liquor bar. I'm just starting to collect some finer liquors so my post isn't ready yet but as soon as it is, be sure to have a look out for it. This is serious alcoholic eye candy.

###/r/PipeTobacco

Very similar to hookah smoking, this pastime has recently arose since the hipster epidemic came to be. Although, pipe tobacco has no real connect to hipsters, can one really exist without the other? Joking aside, /r/Pipetobacco is a fantastic subreddit with great redditors and mods a like. Just like cigars and hookah smokers, you need to give it a try before you judge it.

###/r/HomeBrewing

This is one of those things that is seriously on my bucketlist. The second I can afford a home of my own, the first thing I'm doing with the basement is make a batch of my own moonshine. For those of you who already own a home or just really want to make your own sweet nector, /r/homebrewing is for you. And all your drunk friends.

A section for videogame discussion, you can talk about any and all games here. Whether you want to discuss the dlc of a new game or talk about possible new characters for a game yet to be released; if you like videogames and focused, topic-oriented discussion, this is definitely a section to check out.

A board for everyone who likes gadgets--from professional reviews to what's already out there to discussion on what may be, to long debates about the merits and features of the tech you may have, if you like shiny smooth things with an apple on it, this board is definitely for you.
