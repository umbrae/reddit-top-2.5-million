Can we please stop it now? Say what you mean. Some days I click on an ""It's over"" post because I think it's going to be positive and I really would like to read the encouraging story/happy ending to another LDR, only to get a terribly depressing story that makes me feel worse than when I logged on.

You will be able to type and voice chat in the program, so you two can hear each other laugh over the same joke. Webcam will be added as well.  
  
It's called SyncReel (www.syncreel.com)  (www.facebook.com/syncreel) (www.twitter.com/syncreel)
  
What I'm looking for right now is feedback to see what you all want more and want me to focus on to make this the best tool available for you all.

**UPDATE:** THANK YOU ALL SO MUCH! I didn't think this would pick up like this! I thought it was just going to get buried haha. Seeing all of this really makes all (three) of us of SyncReel so much more excited to get the beta out! I took a risk and quit my comfy/boring Finance job to work on this. This alone makes it all worth it!

Facebook has made it easier for the people whom you hold dear (generally 15 people) to move away, while this is can be awesome for them, it also has its drawbacks. The reason we started this was to allow people to strengthen these specific bonds. It makes me super excited to know you all understand that!

Seriously you all are great! If anyone is in the Houston area, I would love to meet (or Skype with) you and hear about your story! I also need to start a blog! If you want to help give ideas or just chat, feel free to send me an e-mail at willie@syncreel.com too!

",282,22,54,http://www.reddit.com/r/LongDistance/comments/191ni8/last_night_i_knocked_on_his_bedroom_door_to/,"Update to this: http://www.reddit.com/r/LongDistance/comments/18tfw4/i_see_him_in_two_days/

I (24/f) had a whole elaborate plan that I began thinking of weeks ago. I was initially supposed to see him next Tuesday but his birthday was yesterday so I made some changes to my schedule and flights and decided I would be there on his birthday. 

He was going to have friends at his house but in order to surprise him in the best way possible, I needed to get him alone. Earlier in the week I said I had to work a late event but we should Skype when I got home and he agreed that would work. Yesterday I said my phone was going to die (since I had to leave it off for my six hour flight, and then again during the second flight which was an hour), so I had to turn it off. I ""got back to my office and had a few minutes so I turned my phone back on"" during my one hour layover in Vegas. Then ""I had to get back to working that event,"" he wished me luck and then I was on my way. 

His friend, who I contacted via Facebook, picked me up. He informed me that my boyfriend was convinced that the ""present being delivered between 8-10 pm"" was a stripper, which we laughed about, and then I told him my plan. On my way to my boyfriend's house, I texted him saying I was on my way home and we should Skype in fifteen mins. When we turned onto his street, I told him to get online because I was signing on. He went to his room, his friend went inside the house to make sure he was in there, then let his other friends know I was there to surprise him. They couldn't believe it. 

I knocked on his bedroom door, he thought I was his friends and told me to go away so he could Skype, and I knocked again. He was frustrated but opened the door to see me standing there. He was in absolute shock. 

The rest of the night was spent with his friends, among other things, and on his 25th birthday we fell asleep next to one another. I love that boy.

Missing the intimacy, attending social events alone, sporadic chats with your significant other.

If you love someone, that doesn't matter, but there is one feeling that you don't get in a normal relationship.

That feeling you get as you walk through an airport, or train station or get out of your car. The anticipation, excitement, knowing you'll see your significant other for the first time in a long time.

You get to exit and you scan around. For a second, a very brief moment, you wonder where they are. Are they late? 

But then you see them, your eyes meet and the elation bursts through. Nothing can replace that feeling. Other couples will never feel joy like that.

I don't think I'll believe it fully until we're moving me out to his city!!

Boyfriend and I have been together for 2.5 years, 1.5 years of that has been long distance. Our original plan was that I'd graduate college, keep working at my job here, and he'd try to find work here next July/August.

However, this past week, I got offered an incredible job in Boyfriend's city. The job is exactly what I want to be doing, the company is great, the pay is better than I ever expected, and our long distance relationship is suddenly long distance no more!

So in just about 35 days, Boyfriend is going to fly to my city, help me pack up my stuff, and we are going to make the cross-country drive. We're going to be moving in together after more than a year of being 1200 miles apart, and I cannot wait to see what the future holds after that.

Just wanted to share my excitement. Thank you guys for always being such a supportive and positive community.

This type of attitude is unacceptable.

While speaking your mind is not breaking any rule, this *is* a **support** reddit. Comments that center around negating the long distance status of a relationship based on lower mileage have NO place here.

If someone is an hour's drive away from their SO, you have no right to call it an ""inconvenience"". You DO NOT know that persons living situation. You are not able to know if the person can even afford to make the hour drive. You do not know if the person is sacrificing a lot to be able to see their SO as often as possible.

It is not your place to pass judgment on others.

It's true that some of us barely get to see our SOs (if ever, mind you, because a good lot of us are also nevermet couples), while others get to see them every week, it really is not up to you to decide what is and isn't a long distance relationship.



It's funny though, because some couples are a 100 miles or so apart and end up not seeing eachother that often, while I've seen those who are 1000+ miles apart and see each other on a regular (monthly/bi-weekly) basis.

If you are not in the relationship, **you have no right.**


If there is distance, if there is lack of physical interaction, and if the person believes that they are in an LDR, so be it.

Relationships are very personal, and all of them are very different. LDRs are just like any relationships, so these are ALSO very personal and very different.


While I am guilty myself of thinking ""damn... that person is 100 miles away from their SO, I'd kill to be that close"", I would never put that person down, or say their relationship is any easier than mine. I really don't know what their personal lives are like, or the struggles they are facing. If they are here for support, I give it. If they are here for advice, I give it. If they are here for constructive criticism, I'll give it...


But I will **NEVER** judge that persons distance from his/her SO, or on how often they get to see them.

I am 507 miles away from my SO, I'm sure those of you who are almost exactly halfway across the world from eachother would also kill to be 507 miles away from your SO, hell, you'd probably make the drive to see them often if you were that close.


In my case, I can't do that. Because we have some financial and personal issues that inhibit our visiting.

And we are also a nevermet couple. How 'bout that.


Big.friggin.whoop.


My relationship is **MINE**.

Your relationship is **YOURS**.


Do NOT turn this subreddit into a pissing contest.

This is NOT what we are here for.


I still cannot say those posts are delete-worthy, but if it becomes an issue here I will start to do so. Speaking your mind is fine, but posts like those are SERIOUSLY looked down upon here.


HOWEVER, 

The only time this may happen is if someone comes here saying they live like 10 miles away or something...

I'll kindly say that this is might not be the type of subreddit they're looking for, but they're more than welcome to look around and read and post. Relationship Advice may be more suitable and able to help, or so on.. depending on the post.

WITH ALL OF THAT SAID...

Really... who are we to judge?

If someone who sees their SO every day or so is coming here for help... we must be doing *something* right. Our focus is communication, and keeping that spark alive through distance. A lot of the support, love and advice this community shares with one another could be easily be aplied to regular relationships...

And if it helps them out, then we're doing what we're here for.


Do NOT hate on those who come here for advice.

There were a few reddits who  mocked or poked fun at the OP of posts about a LDR when they asked for help or advice relating to the LDR... because they were different. Lets not turn into those types of reddits.

If someone's here for help... well, They're here for help. We can KINDLY redirect them or give them our own personal bit of advice. But no hate, kthx.


_________________________________
**EDIT**
There's been some discussion about my ""never judge"" and ""10 miles isn't an LDR"" mention...

My apologies on not being clear and being contradictory. 

When I said ""never judge"", I meant that I don't want the harshness and elitism some people seem to display when someone has a shorter distance between them and their SO. I don't like to delete posts. We only take care of trolls  and people who ask for their post to be deleted... other than that, we don't touch peoples stuff. If someone with a short distance comes posting here, I wont delete it. I'll just let it slowly pass to the other pages.

What I had in mind (but didn't make clear) when I wrote the 10 mile tid-bit, was just thinking about the regular joe, taking his car and driving 10 miles to go visit his lady in the apartment. Say, that person being in a stable financial situation, means of transportation and so on...

A LOT of relationships are like that. And they are not really LDRs from what I personally understand... it's just a drive to see your SO.

If a person with an SO 10 miles away came here because they had no way of seeing eachother immedietly, limited communication, busy work schedule and so on... maybe see that person once every 2 weeks or so... I feel like we should at least extend a hand. 


I cannot give you a defined line when it comes to what is and isn't an LDR. For sure there needs to be lack of physical interaction and distance, and a good ammount of time before things go back to normal (say your SO leaves to study for 6 months in another city/state/country or something). There are a lot of things that come into play. Age, financial status, transportation, culture, work...

It's just going to have to be done on a post by post basis. I'm sorry if that's not the answer some of you are wanting, but using a blanketed term just doesn't work.

If someone comes here because they hardly get to see their SO cause of conflicting work schedules... yet they live in the same house, that post obviously will not belong here.

The best I can tell you is to use your common sense, think a bit before you post. 

Don't put yourself in that persons shoes, because all you will do is think ""Well damn if I was them I'd be happy as a pig in mud to be 200 miles away"". Just think that it's just as painful for them to be apart from their SO as it is for you.

And in the end, if you just feel like you can't relate... let it be. There's plenty of people from all  different ""types"" of LDRs here. The thing is, someone half way across the world from their SO cannot really relate to someone who is 100 miles away from theirs.

And that's okay.

One thing we all know for sure is that being unable to spend physical time with your SO on a regular basis really  sucks.

Just give support/love if you want. If you feel that sinking, ill will then just let it go and move on. 


Geez, this really is a touchy subject, aint it...

Aside from the discussion we're having here, I'll speak with the mods about maybe coming up with some sidebar content on this. Hell, I may even contact Frank and Michelle from over in LFAD and see what their take is on it.

Again, sorry if this was not the answer you wanted (and about derailing a  bit)

There just really is no way to make a defined line.

___________
**EDIT2:** I really need to clean up/update that sidebar... qq

She cheated on me, that's how it came to an end, BUT I'm not here to rant. I'm here to say, I learnt the hard way, long distance relationships aren't going to work if there is one strong person and one weak. You both need to strongly believe that everything will work, that those life plans will come true. 

I did believe those plans, unfortunately she did not. What I did notice whilst being within this community, the amount of strong people who are willing to, not only love someone x-amount of miles apart from each other, but also support others on here in similar situations! I didn't even realize what I was truly doing until I looked back. 

You people here are truly amazing. You keep believing in your relationship. Keep believing in your dreams and promises to each other, because I promise you, if you're both strong, and you're both committed, you will be in each other's arms when you sleep. Not just for week, but for as long as you two are together. 

When you two have arguments, don't ignore each other, sit down as adults and resolve the situation, it's hard because you can't hug and kiss, but by god, you can show her or him that you love her or him by making something special, or doing something special. You're not completely powerless. 


And please, wonderful people in long distance relationships, please don't forget, he or she loves YOU. that distance has not stopped your love. Think about that. Let it sink in for a moment. They care more than you realise. 

You wonderful people are all very strong, and me not being in a long distance makes me realize even more how amazing you all are. Keep being strong. Keep believing.

1347377680.0,187,self.LongDistance,zpnj6,It's all over.,200,13,31,http://www.reddit.com/r/LongDistance/comments/zpnj6/its_all_over/,"2 years ago, my fiancee and I met on OKC. I was working Mississippi and he was finishing school in Michigan. When I came home (to Michigan) for a week and we met for the first time, it was all over. The night that I had to leave, we held each other and he kept telling me how much he ""really, really, really liked"" me. Both of us were hesitant to use the L-word. Much to my protest, we started dating long distance. 

As the year passed, we grew closer and closer, both physically and emotionally. One of the great things about my job at the time was that I was traveling all over the country, and had plenty of time for talking via phone, text or even IM. I also believe that this is one of the shining benefits to long distance dating; your idea of spending time together is simply talking. The more I learned about him, the more I fell for him. I remember calling my mom  and saying ""I think it's over for me."" By this point I was working/living in Iowa- which seemed infinitely closer to him than Mississippi. 

Before I started dating my SO, I was in several long term and abusive relationships. My self-esteem was shot and I had no idea what a healthy relationship was supposed to feel like. Not only did he help to correct the past, but he also constantly loved me even when I didn't love myself- from 600 miles away. Whenever I wanted so badly to quit, he would not lot me. And for this, along with so many other examples, I am forever grateful. 

When I moved back home to Michigan, we were still living on opposites sides of the state 200-some miles away. He was in his last year of school while I was working, trying to save up money while I still lived with my parents. We were getting closer. After he finished and moved back to our side of the state, he started working 3rd shift and lived an hour away. It seemed like we couldn't win. 

Eventually, he got a different (and better!) job and we were on a somewhat similar schedule, and he's only a half an hour away. I could go see him almost whenever I wanted. Things were, what I imagined, as good as it could get. 

July 31st, I came over after work late one night and walked into the house. He has two roommates, but when I came in, it seemed like no one was home. I made my way to his room and saw his computer with Minecraft open, but him no where to be found. The screen instructed me to sit down, walk the path, and to view the sights along the way. As I walked through the virtual world, there were signs placed everywhere describing our journey, the bumps in the past and the ones we'll surely cross on the road ahead. But there was no one he'd rather take that journey worth. And the very last sign, the one that said ""turn around,"" made my heart stop. 
I turned around in my chair and there he was, down on one knee. 

I recently landed a new, big-kid job that runs on the same exact schedule as him. And it's only ten to fifteen minutes away from him house, compared to a 45 minute drive from my house. My last day at my current job, at my parent's house, and most importantly, as a long distance couple, is Friday. We're getting married in October next year. 

It's all over. The nights of demeaning loneliness, of irrational jealousy toward other couples, the days of ""is it worth it?"" Yes. It is absolutely and totally, 100% worth it. 

I just want to thank this community for being so stupidly amazing and supportive. This will forever be one of my favorite subreddits. I realize that my long distance was nothing compared to others who are half way around the globe from their significant others. And for each and every one of you, I hope it's worth it. I hope the love outweighs the pain. I hope the time you spend together is full of laughs and smiles and nauseating love-dovey Skype silences. I hope you get a super cute Minecraft proposal. I hope things one day seamlessly fall into place. ",,False,,t5_2s6ky,False,,,True,t3_zpnj6,http://www.reddit.com/r/LongDistance/comments/zpnj6/its_all_over/,

I wanted to make a list of things I should be more focused on that will maybe make the distance a little easier to bear at times. (Sorry for the formatting, typing this up on my phone)

• The first kiss after months of being apart. It's like having that very first kiss all over again.

• I've learned to value time. I value the time we have together, but also the time we have apart. I don't want to waste the time between visits moping and feeling sorry for myself, so I try to make the most of the time in between to learn and grow as an individual while at the same time still learning and growing as a couple.

• I have something to look forward to. Something to plan for and be happy about when I'm feeling down. Sometimes the distance gets to me, but knowing that one day I'll be back in his arms is enough to keep me satisfied.

• And of course, the I-haven't-seen-you-in-months-I've-missed-you-so-much sex. I think we all saw this one coming!

• I remember all the little things. Things that other couples might normally take for granted or otherwise not notice. Like a small remark he made during a concert we went to in September, or the way his face lit up when I first looked up at him for the first time in three months last December. Or how he was holding my hands and how nervous I felt when he told me he loved me for the first time. 

• Just simply knowing that someone somewhere out there cares about me so much, that they would rather only see me for a few days every couple of months and still be mine than not be with me at all. It makes me feel valued and loved and it's definitely a good and somewhat rare feeling. 

• When issues arise, we have to be open with one another and state our problems directly. I think this builds a lot more trust between us and establishes a good and healthy way of dealing with things. 

So these are just some of the pros I could think of at the moment. There are probably more, so feel free to comment any others. The main thing is that I want to stay positive, because there's no use in being sad and depressed over something that nothing but fate has control over.

We knew right away that something was different, like we knew there was more to this than just friendship. We used msn and E-mails for a full year, then I said I want to come visit. Both of us where happier than we could imagine. The moment I seen her was the moment I knew there was nothing more I needed in this world. 

Her family lives in a rural farming community and her father is 6 foot 7 and 350lbs, to say I was nervous to meet them was an understatement (them allowing her to meet me was under the condition I come and meet the ENTIRE family within the first few days). I literally met everyone in her family, from cousin to uncle. 

To cut this story short her Mother and Father treat me like a son and I learned more about life from them than any other time. 

After 6 more years of expensive flights and a lot of hard work, both mentally and physically, we're getting married this summer. When we talk today we still love each other the same as we did in 06/07. 

Thanks for taking time to read my story.

We will not tolerate this in any way regardless if you're new here or a regular.  What we will do is remove those comments and ban if we feel it is warranted.

""Why are you telling us this SLC?!  I've not done anything!""

The reason I am posting this is we are only 4 people.  Some of us can't moderate as much as we'd like so really there is typically about 2 1/2 of us for 4,779 of you.  Some may, like myself, have other subreddits to moderate so we get pretty busy.  What we ask is that you report any comments you find offensive.  If it's using abusive language, disparaging remarks about your, a loved one or LD relationships in general, racist, sexist, whatever, report it.  Also, **make sure that you send a message to moderators that you have reported a link**.  This is imperative as sometimes Reddit's back end system for Spam and reported links is crappy and we can't get to the issue.  They are on separate systems that aren't as robust as the website itself.  What we can get to is PM's and ModMail's.  

I am going through now to make sure the new trolls are thrown out and banned when needed (1 already has and another is probably on their way) so please, report.  Think of us as the Police. We are here to protect and to serve but we can't see all.  So, if you see something, you have to call us sometimes to make sure we get to it and take care of it.

Thanks for your attention and please upvote this so that others will see it and read it (hopefully).  

Also, to the trolls, we will find you, we will ban you, your shitty opinions on our choices in life are unwarranted, unwelcome, and unwanted.",,False,,t5_2s6ky,False,,,True,t3_vthan,http://www.reddit.com/r/LongDistance/comments/vthan/community_reminder_please_read_this_and_upvote_no/,moderator

**NOTE: I have been tweaking answers and questions to better suit respondent's needs, so if you were dissatisfied with the options available to you please check the survey again and change your answer if you'd like! I can't add new questions.**

This one will take around 5 minutes of your time. It is a bit longer than the last one, and there is some overlap with it. Let me know here or in the comment question of the survey if you see any mistakes in wording or spelling. I was tired!

I have changed the settings for this survey so that you can go back and change your answers and take the survey in more than one sitting. Just click the link. However, make sure you finish taking the survey by [insert date and time here]. I'll decide later when the survey will close, but you all will have at least a week.

Enjoy! I can't wait to see the results. *And please upvote this post for visibility!*

Edits:

* You may now specify your equivalent or non-US education level and select ""Some college/university (unspecified time)."" I apologize for the US-centric options. I wasn't thinking.

* You can now enter *days* left until your LDR is over.

*I'd also like to add that we will do everything we can to protect user privacy. If you have concerns, PM me to discuss what we can do to protect your information or leave a comment at the end of the survey.

Having done the long distance thing myself for exactly 2 years, I could tell by the long hugs and the tears in your eyes that you are, like I used to be, in a long distance relationship. 

I feel your pain, in fact, had I had more guts to do so, I would have given you both a big hug and told you it would be OK. I had to choke back tears myself watching the two of you this morning. Saying goodbye at the airport is the worst feeling in the world. I know, I've done it myself more times than I want to remember. 

Just know that sometimes in the end, it does work out. I was dating my fiancee for two years long distance. It was a long and awful drawn out separation, but I finally moved down to be with her for 6 months a month ago. We're making plans for our future to make our time together more permanent. 

The both of you were so beautiful together, and I wish you all the best. I know it'd be a far stretch to think you'll actually see this, but if you happen to, I hope it all works out for the both of you in the end. &lt;3

I want everyone in here (under 18, over, parents, everyone) please. ",133,18,25,http://www.reddit.com/r/LongDistance/comments/k2z9s/rlongdistance_we_should_discuss_something_serious/,"Something peculiar popped into my head after reading a thread not too long ago. Young lovers happen. We've all experienced it, be it one sided or returned. A good majority of us experienced love at a young age, weather or not we admit it, and a lot of our younger teen members are experiencing it right now, there is no denying that.

 A lot of the times it is difficult to discuss the subject with parents (as it was for me) so we turn to friends or other trusted adults to help us out. /r/LongDistance is a safe place for them to come for help and advice from people who are in their shoes.

Now, with the coming of the internet LDRs have become, if not more common (since they already existed for thousands of years), then more exposed. Multiplayer Games, Social Networking... even websites like Reddit, can all be grounds to meet your significant other. Only difference is that you start off as an LDR. You don't meet them face to face immediately. However, that should never deter you.

The longest friendships I've had have been online. I met a them when I was 13 and to this day (I'm 20) we talk and I've even met a few of them over the years. They are wonderful people. My SO I met online, and I've never been more in love.



HOWEVER, when someone underage, I'd say between 13 to 17 comes in here asking for advice on how to meet up with their SO, I want all of you to please take into consideration the fact that they are underage. 

I was a tad bit alarmed when I saw people happily urging someone within that age rage to take buses to visit their SO, or pay people for a ride, even as far as to go backpacking. And not so much as a mention about talking to her parents...

This young lady (I assume) is in school, as is (or should be) her SO (again, this information I don't know). They should not be out backpacking at that age. 

This may come off as harsh, but I don't care who you are, or how well any crazy adventure you might have had trying to meet your SO may have been...

We, under no circumstance, will urge anyone who is underage to run off without parental permission in attempts to meet with their SO. We will tell them how they can keep contact, how to make the distance easier, and even encourage them to meet...
**So long as the parents of both parties are aware**.

This also applies to anyone who is 18 or older and has an SO who is underage. 

But none of this romantic running away crap. That almost never works, no matter how many times you've seen it work in movies. Chances are you will end up arrested, on a ""run away"" list, or with a restriction order on you or your SO placed on them by the parents.

I realize this was not something that was discussed, and not everyone will disclose their age, but in the event that you are away, I urge to please try to convince, if not suggest,  them to let their parents know of the visit and HAVE the parents consent when meeting.

To those of you reading that fall under that age range, I'm not trying to shut you down. I know what you're feeling. We all here know that feeling of hopelessness that you may experience from time to time, and the absolute need to want to be with your SO. When I was 13 I fell madly for a friend of mine in Texas, and there were times that I felt like running away, or sneaking off would have been the best way to go about it. Looking back on it now I'm glad I never did...


Here you will find people in your same boat wanting to help and encourage eachother. One other thing I want to make clear that this community will never do is shut down someone because of age, either.

""You're too young to know what love is"" is a load of bull, in my opinion. And if I ever see a post like that on here I will remove it without warning. 

My main concern here is the happiness and safety of our members.  I will happily continue discussing this in the comments. Please keep it civilized. No cursing out and no insulting. None of that.

This is a serious matter that I wish to discuss with the community, because it involved the safety and well being of some of our members and their families.

**EDIT**: Upvote this or downvote, it will help NOTHING if people don't come in here and discuss their feelings about this situation.
So please, when you have the time, do so.",,False,,t5_2s6ky,True,,default,True,t3_k2z9s,http://www.reddit.com/r/LongDistance/comments/k2z9s/rlongdistance_we_should_discuss_something_serious/,moderator

I did this for a month, and eventually settled in Sevilla for 2 weeks.

I stayed in a hostel, but got evicted for some questionable behaviour when drunk. The only hostel available for my last day there was a real hell hole, but I stayed there anyway.

While there, I got talking to an American girl who seemed lovely. We talked all night, we get on like a house on fire. I tell her we would be awesome in a relationship, and she agrees. No point though right, she lives in America.

She was studying there for 6 months, and travelled all around Europe. She visited London, where I live and we had a completely platonic meal and I showed her the sights. We parted ways and figured we'd never see each other again. I didn't know where she lived or anything about her, we just got on well. I asked her to add me on Facebook, but she never did. I couldn't find her either, there are thousands of people with her name. I sent her a few texts to her Spanish phone, but she never replied. I guess she left the phone in Spain.

Fast forward to April this year. I have a new job, and I'm sent to North Carolina for work. I go to a bar and meet two awesome guys who are watching Soccer, and they ask me all about Soccer and it's nuances. We get drunk, and they invite me to a party they're having at a frat house. Do I want to go?

Well as a British guy, you think it's going to be just like the movies. It wasn't. It was cool nonetheless, but not exactly crazy frat party cool.

Anyway, I'm talking to this cute chick when her friend comes wandering over. I go to introduce myself and my jaw drops.

It's her.

Yesterday, [he had the feelings I did a few days before](http://www.reddit.com/r/LongDistance/comments/14f4um/obligatory_ireallyneedhelpwithmyfeels_post/) and my poor dear felt really alone. I hopped on skype to help cheer him up and assure him that everything's gonna be okay. And that's when I remembered what happened to me on Saturday, so I shared the story I'm about to share with you.

On Saturday, I went to a Chiptune festival that was fantastic. I walked towards the bus station at my college really late at night. My phone was dead and had no watch/iPod, so I had no track of time at all. I noticed there was an older man, he looked about in his 40s-50s and I asked him what the time was. He was hard-of-hearing so I did small hand signals to ask him what the time was. He told me it was around 10:30 or so. I was sitting outside in 40* in a t-shirt and jeans, mostly because I was still really sweaty from the concert. He asked me if I was cold, and then it turned into a conversation about the concert I went to. I learned he was working in the Computer Science department and originally lives in Long Island. 

He asked me what I was doing for break, and I told him I was going to see my family and travel out to see my boyfriend. He asked where my boyfriend lived, and I told him. He went ""Whewwwww. That's quite a ways!"" I nodded. ""I know that exact feel."" He responded.

Turns out, his **wife** lived in South Carolina and he met her at some technical convention a long time ago. They had become really close penpals and as technology advanced, they used the internet and chatrooms. They've been married for **20 years** and she moved up to Long Island! He said the trips were expensive, but it was worth every penny. He told me that LDRs do work if you put your mind and heart to it. They are technically in a LDR right now since he's in Rochester and she's in Long Island for the semester, but he said he's coming home for Christmas to see his SO too, just like me.

I did everything humanly possible not to cry, because it was such a beautiful story.

It took a few years--my dad constantly taunted my mother, and my mother, in turn, threw his shoes onto the school's roof--but they fell in love, somewhere in Virginia where my mom was raised.

Unfortunately, army kids have it rough, and a few years later my dad was forced to move across the country to California at sixteen and a half. For most kids, this would have been the end of it--but not for my parents. They wrote letters. They thought about each other a lot. They talked to each other when they could, because in 1970 long-distance phone service was expensive, and there was no internet or skype with which they could see each other.

This went on for a year and a half. My dad graduated. My grandfather transferred to Boston. My dad went back to Virginia and he brought my mother back.

They've been together ever since. It's been over 30 years, and in that time they've done long distance again. My dad just got home from a month and a half long work trip to Australia. When he got back, it was just as if he'd never left.

I missed this subreddit greatly. Been gone for a while.

Now, it's really early in the morning, and I'm still awake, tired as hell, but still awake. So while having a conversation with a fellow redditor, and exchanging subreddit reader count information... we noticed that our name, what we are... LDRers (on our sidebar), didn't quite make sense.


Long Distance Relationshipers


Shipers

Ships

Boats


So I am tired, and we are all boats, and it makes sense. Cause boats traverse distances to get from point A to point B, it may be a calm journey, or full of mighty waves, but thats what they do.

Now it doesn't matter what kind of boat you are, be you a waterboat, landboat or airboat... we have journeys to embark on, distances to close.

I love you all. I'll probably delete this and very much change the sidebar back to normal when I wake up.

Until then good night, my dears.

I wrote out a bunch of things I love about him on little colorful pieces of paper and filled a glass jar with the pieces of paper. He'll be allowed to read one per day (I fit 60 in the jar, so he'll have enough for 2 months) as a daily reminder of why I love him.

[Here's a picture of the finished product.](http://imgur.com/W9Oc2)

You can also get creative and decorate the jar (or use some other type of container). I thought about putting the pieces of paper in a fish bowl and decorating it so he could go ""fishing for compliments"" each day, but I'm not too crafty and it would probably come out looking terrible.

You can also change the rules of the gift to make it so your SO is allowed to read one note each time they're really missing you, or two a day (one in the morning and one at night). It's completely up to you to decide when your SO gets to read the notes.

Also, I typed up a list of all the notes I was planning on including so I could keep track of what I already wrote and avoid duplicates. I didn't want him to end up with 4 little notes that say something like ""I love your smile"" and I found that keeping track of what I had already written made it easier to make the notes more diverse (some silly, some cute, some serious, some sexual, etc.).

It's a pretty easy and inexpensive gift to make and your SO can enjoy it for many weeks or months (depending on how many little notes you come up with).

You unconditional lovers, you  know that it never gets any easier to say goodbye and still you cross distances to say hello and hold the one you love if only for a moment.

You strong individuals, you stand alone with the expectation that one day you'll survive to rest at last when you can stand with your far off desire. Keep your strength and hold one another up when they cannot see the light impending.

Sometimes I say, ""In an airport!"" 

And sometimes I say, ""Uh, the internet, actually.""

And very rarely I say, ""Would you believe me if I told you I met him on 4Chan?""

So here's our story. A couple days before Christmas a couple years ago, I was on /r9k/ in a thread describing what it's like when you meet an awesome person and then they send you a picture that makes your face go :/

It derailed into a thread about how your command of the English language takes on its own ""accent"" on the internet. We called it ""personal syntax"".

Someone tells me they like my personal syntax. We get to chatting, and three days later we're doing the ""I'm pretty sure I'm literally in love with you."" dance.

Our first kiss was virtual, but packed with all the physical responses and emotion of a real first kiss. That tightening in the stomach, that release of oxytocin and dopamine. 

""Is there a less obvious way of saying that I really, really like you?"" 
""No, but there is a more obvious one."" *kiss*

Our communication was constant. If I was at a computer, there was a window open and I was shooting him messages and responding to his. If I was away from the computer, I was responding to his text messages. If I was alone, we were on skype. We didn't even have to speak, just knowing that I could say something out loud and knowing that he would hear it was enough. I never, ever truly felt alone. Some days we would fall asleep at our computers after skyping for hours and the connection would hold through until the morning. I would wake up and make sleepy noises and he would say, ""Good morning, sleepy-head."" There wasn't a day I didn't speak with him for hours upon hours.

I met him for the first time after two months. I stood in the airport thinking about the thread we first met in, wondering if he would take one look at me, go :/ and turn around and leave. When I didn't see him in the waiting area or by the baggage carousel, the panic began to mount. Then I spotted someone running towards me. The recognition was instant, and then in the next instant I was being squeezed so hard I couldn't breathe but I swear if he'd have let go of me I'd have just died right there.

It was magic. When our time together was spent, we didn't know how to say goodbye. When we realized my laptop's clock was an hour ahead and still had sixty more minutes, we cried.

We spent that next summer together. I did something that only seemed a little crazy at the time: moving to his city to do my schooling fully knowing that he would be leaving at the end of the summer to do his schooling on the other side of the country. When the summer ended, I played car-tetris with him until the early hours of the morning and he drove me to my apartment and fell asleep with me in my bed. There was no goodbye, only me pulling his arms around me and immediately falling asleep. When I woke up two hours later it was because he pulled away and was openly weeping trying to tell me his goodbyes. I'd never seen anyone, let alone a man cry as hard. I had already run out of tears. All I could do was hold him in exhausted silence as he tried to find the words.

We spent the next year apart, playing plane tag. It turns out plane tickets are expensive when you live on literally opposite ends of the country. It was a cycle of extreme but brief highs and deep, prolonged lows. 

It wasn't always easy. Actually, it was never really easy. To this day, sometimes we get in a fight and retreat to our own corners of the house and get on the computer, coming full circle to talk things out with a screen between us.

When that year passed, he came to live with me for another summer. At the end of it, I graduated and we packed our things down into six suitcases like a condensed can of soup and boarded a plane together for the first time.

Now we live together, and I'm pleased to say that we've been together for nearly three years. We talk about marriage pretty often but aren't in any hurry.

Where's the happy? Where's the ""in between"".

We ALL know long distance is incredibly difficult. Being new to one or not, it's painful. We, however, must find ways to get over it. Be you separated for 2 months, or two years. We know communication, trust, and honesty are MUST HAVES...

Good.

It sucks, and we'll go through downs and we'll need support. We're apart now, and our ultimate goal is to close the distance. We are all on the same annoying boat. Our SOs are on another one... lulul... oh that made me sad. QQ

But what else is there? What do you do? What are things you've done in order to pass the time and just be happy with your SO? Here's my list of things I've done and things I'm going to do/want to do.


* **Talk on Webcam** (Gmail is awesome and free and easy. You can also use Tinychat JUST MAKE SURE YOUR ROOM DOES NOT DISPLAY IN THE LISTINGS AND IS PASSWORD PROTECTED!)
* **Talk on the phone** (Gmail has a nice phone feature if you don't have one, and it's free to anywhere in the US)
* **Write letters**. (You can write a letter in a bottle in the US. I'm pretty sure they'll mail bottles) 
* **Make them a letter box/holder**. ( A box or a pouch, hand crafted/painted/knitted by yourself! Send it off to them in order to give them somewhere special to keep letters and little thing you send)
* **Play games together**. (Steam as a new selection of multiplayer F2P games, Spiral Knights is my favorite and I play it with my SO all the time. If you're wanting to be more casual than casual you can try Minecraft. However, it's not free.)
* **Make music videos**. (Even if you suck at singing, make a music video, a love song, and put it in a private Youtube URL, send it to them, they'll love it)
* **Read together**. (Find a nice book, use the library if you don't want to buy it. Read at the same pace, discuss chapters and such)
* **Learn a new language together**. (Some libraries offer free language learning services, there is also the internet)
* **Go on a date!** (**use your webcam**, dress up, set up a table, even if it's not super fancy. Have fun, be it eating taco bell or lobster, use plates, silverware! The whole shabang. You can also send  a date box over to them. Put in some wine, a wine glass, a recipe for dinner, candles, movie snacks [for when you watch a movie together] a cute little list explaining dress code [or lack there of] and just anything else you find would be nice to have on a date. Make sure you get double of everything, because you're going to be going on that date with them. So he gets a box and you have your own. Have them send you a box next time!)
* **Watch movies together!** (livestream.com is a bit complicated, but fun. If you want something simpler, use synchtube.com! It synchs up youtube videos so that you both can see it at the same time. Make sure to sign up to be able to make a private room, unless you don't care for people coming in and out. For you couples with Xbox360's there is also the Netflix Party View! ""people can use through xbox 360s. Xbox Live lets people get in a 'group' and seamlessly syncs up whatever's being watched"" [More in comments!](http://www.reddit.com/r/LongDistance/comments/jrxfv/you_all_are_upsetting_the_crap_out_of_me_get_the/c2enmn6) )
* **Exchange rings/blankets/pillows!** (Having something to hold when your SO isn't around is nice. Send him/her a blanket you slept in, or a ring for them to keep on their finger while they're away, or a pillow you used, or a teddy bear... anything! Just make sure it's been in your hands. A teddy bear you've cuddled with means a lot more than one you just buy and send to him/her that's never been out of it's box)
* **Surprise them with pizza!** (Get their address, then call the local pizza place there [use the internet to find it] order pizza for them, sometimes you can explain your situation and have them make a pepperoni heart or draw on the box something. Get creative!)
* **Go out to a coffee/mom&amp;pop shop and share coffee/hotchocolate/meal** (You need a webcam and no shame for this! Set up a ""get together"". Use the wifi at the shop, or a tether. Then just put the laptop/tablet infront of you and enjoy your mutual outing. Having a conversation outside of your home while enjoying something together could do wonders)



Seriously, share the stuff you do, post it here, I'll add more stuff as it comes to me or grab it from the comments.

Stop being so sad my friends, cheer up. You're in a long distance relationship, but you're still in a relationship. You have love, a best friend. It's not all so bad.

_____________________________________________________________
**The Art of The Long Distance Date**

You want dinner and a movie? Make it happen. What kind of date is this? Stay at home pajama date? Pizza and a movie? Or do you want this to be super fancy?

REMEMBER TO DRESS ACCORDINGLY. 

For the fancy date, I don't care if you think you look silly. Because you know you'll love seeing your SO dressed up. You know she'll look beautiful, or he'll look absolutely handsome. She/He will think the same of you. Ladies, do your hair and nails, get your good pair of shoes out. Show yourself off for him, twirl. Remind him/her what a beautiful woman he's/she's got.

Gentlemen, put on your good shirt. Don't be lazy, put the pants on too. You wouldn't go out on a date in your boxers (or maybe you would if you could, ahaha) Shave, style that hair. Be a gentleman. 

 I listed synchtube and livestream. However, you still have the option of doing it the old fashion way. Get yourself a DVD (lul who uses those anymore?) or Netflix on your TV, get on the phone or webcam and count that shit down. Hit play at the same time and enjoy.

Enjoy eachother's company, even if you don't say much during the movie. Don't feel the need to.  This doesn't happen in real movie dates (unless you're a chatty commentor! Which is not bad, haha.) You're there, he/she's there. Just watch the movie. If you talk, you talk, if you don't it's fine. 

If you've sent eachother blankets or teddy bears or pillows now would be the perfect time to snuggle up with one of those.

once the movie is done, time to move on to the dinner. If you're not planning a fancy dinner, just chill on the couch or on the bed, eat your pizza. Or you can still eat at the table... no restrictions, you're in your pajamas, be silly, get creative.

For fancy dinners, get the nice silverware out. Light some candles. Sit down, eat, talk about everything and anything. Talk about how silly you feel right now, dressed up, but remind your SO that you're happy regardless, since they are there with you. It's special, long distance or not, sharing time and making memories like these, as silly as they may be, is very, very special and something you will look back on fondly.

I know I focused on the ""fancy"" date, but this applies to any kind of date you're setting up. Also, I know I mainly focused on the webcams, but if you don't have one, use the phone, or a type of voice chat. Describe what you're wearing, use speaker phone for the dinner. If you both cooked the same thing, comment on it. Maybe he messed up the rice? Laugh it off. Tell him just to leave it the heck alone next time, and if he can't do that, then tell him you'll make him the rice, since he's so bad at it.

Just. Have. Fun.

Love eachother.

**TL;DR** No. Read it.

**EDIT**: I also want to remind you all that I am in no way tying to downplay advice seeking and just general support of LDRs... that's why this subreddit was made. However, we need more happy. I came here looking for something like this, and ended up getting upset about my LDR. D8 Sucked bro.
___________________________

**I spoke with the admin and now I am a mod** 
I'm going to make sure to include all this information and more on the sidebar! :D Please PLEASE keep putting in information you'd like to share.

I'll have a nicer looking (and sounding) list of things to do while in an LDR.

I'll also put up f2p games, and cheap games.. and uh, things to do together online!

Oh dear, haha. Give me a few days and I'll have it figured out. :)

I submitted our paperwork for me to sponsor him to move here in March 2012. We hit a bump a couple of months back because I had to prove that we had funds and that I could support him, as I'm unemployed and a fulltime student.

Stay strong everyone! We'll make it!

I was studying abroad in Singapore, and found out that my exam schedule was extremely condensed and ended 2 weeks earlier than expected. So, when I found out my SO had been going through a hellish semester, I decided to fly in earlier to surprise him.

1. I asked him casually, around February, when would be the best time to visit. He said ""end of April, early May."" This was an implicit go-ahead. I said ""too bad, I can't make it"" and that was the end of it.
Or was it?
2. I lied about my exam schedule. Said I had one more exam on April 30 and then was traveling to Bangkok. Little did he know that it wasn't the kind of bangkok he expected ;)
3. Totally made it a point to talk during each of my layovers, since my disappearing off skype for the 2 days it takes to get there would be weird. 
4. Totally said I was going to Sentosa (a theme park) for the day since I was fed up with studying, while I was on my connecting flight from Vancouver to NYC. I kept the lie straight when I'd arrived in NYC what would have been that evening, saying I had a nice dinner at one of the restaurants there (our favourite, Din Tai Fung). This is because I usually stay on skype while studying, so I didn't want any unusual behaviour to be construed as red flags. 
4. Finally, on the train from NYC to Providence (the final stretch) as I was approaching, I realized that I needed him to stay in his room and not go to lunch or somewhere else (it was around 12:30pm). So I pretended I had an exam the next day (he still thought I was in Singapore, so it would be 12 hours ahead) and was really stressed and needed moral support.

Sure enough, he was in his room at that time, I just sort of barged in, and he was just sort of like wtf wtf wtf wtf wtf!?!?! for the first five minutes. I wasn't sure whether he was mad or just overexcited. It turns out he thought I was him hallucinating (he'd been working superhard on a project very late nights) and having his usual fantasies of me coming (aww!) but alas, it was for real this time. Then he embraced me passionately, and the rest was history ;)

The shock obviously came from the fact that in his mind, I was half a world away, in a dorm room, studying for an exam. This, of course, couldn't be further from the truth... so when that image, that notion of where I was shattered, it was quite a shock! But he loved it and it's going great so far :)

So, advice for surprising your SO without a hitch:

1. Try to stay accessible throughout the journey if possible. If you're away for a prolonged period of time you need to explain it.
2. Do not tell any of your SO's friends unless absolutely necessary. My SO's friends are notorious for being terrible at keeping secrets and excellent at dropping hints. 
3. When you explain absences and whatnot, *make sure you keep your lies straight*. And always have a plausible alibi.

**UPDATE: On my way home now. Visit went spectacularly. All my worst fears disintegrated. He was so excited about me being there, showing me off to all his friends, PDA, you name it. Best of all, I really think I brightened up what would have been a really crappy week for him. He was super-sweet, even packing me a going-away breakfast when I wasn't looking and stuffing it in my bag. I'm sure all of you know what those never-ending tender goodbye hugs feel like...sigh. On the bright side, I get to see him again in two and a half weeks!**

He never told me he was unhappy, I thought we were great. It came out of left field. I had been distant and unfortunately taking out my frustrations of being alone and unhappy with my first year of college on him for the past month. I had no idea I was even doing that until he broke it off and I asked why. I just wish I had the chance to try to make the distance better and be a better GF. Now he doesn't even want to be my friend and told me he doesn't love me anymore. 

I feel so betrayed that he would give up on us so quickly after all that went into this relationship.

We had gotten into a rut and I took it for granted that he would wait for me. He said the last time we were together (winter break) it was great and he was happy. 

Now I don't know how to handle any of this. He was my best friend and the one that got me through this terrible year. Now I'm alone and don't have anyone to turn to.

Back story: my fiancé and I have been engaged since last March. I graduated college last July and the only job I've been able to find is a shitty seasonal retail one that doesn't give me any hours, and he's been struggling to make ends meet as a freelance programmer. There's been a lot of uncertainty because he's been staying with his parents and we haven't been sure if we'd be able to pull off getting married this coming April like we planned.

ALL THAT HAS NOW CHANGED.

About two weeks ago he started putting in applications for traditional work, and today we found out that he got a job--the first one he applied for, too! Now we know for sure that we can afford to get married and move in together! And his job pays enough that if we manage our finances well, I'll be able to get a paralegal certification and start applying for work in that field (my degree is in history). I was sad and crying last night because I miss him so much and we weren't sure if we'd be able to make April work, but now all that's gone!

I'M SO FUCKING HAPPY!!!!!!!!! :D :D :D

-----------

The story of how Dad married Mom sounds somewhat unusual, but how they met and fell in love was not uncommon. Both of them attended Yenching University in Beijing, and met in a Christian Light and Salt Fellowship on campus. However, two years after they started dating; Japan attacked America’s Pearl Harbor on December, 1941, which led America to declare war on Japan. As a result, the Japanese army in China went to occupy Yenching University that had been founded by American missionaries, and forced the university to shut down. Since the Japanese army already seized Beijing, Dad, like many other young people who were filled with patriotism, felt it was an unbearable shame to live and work under the rule of Japanese invaders in Beijing. Therefore, he decided to run away with other young people from Beijing to the province of Sichuan in the southwest, which was where the Chinese wartime government located. Mom was not able to go along with him for her family’s sake. Thus, the war completely separated Dad and Mom for almost five years.  It was not until Japan’s surrender at the end of the World War II was Dad able to return to Beijing to reunite with Mom, and married her a year later.  Today, we are so used to the speed of electronic communication, and it is unthinkable that these two young hearts were linked by the slower-than-snail mails during those five years of war. Dad would write to Mom once every other week. They never knew how long it would take the mail to reach the destination. Even though the two of them missed each other so much, they would not reveal their feelings in the mails. As long as they could hear each other being safe, it would be the greatest comfort to them. Dad wrote a memoir when he was in his 80s and mentioned those years of long separation between him and Mom as “miserable beyond expression… but that kind of feeling was also deep and purified, and thus was also joyful beyond expression.”",,False,,t5_2s6ky,False,,,True,t3_14cv80,http://www.reddit.com/r/LongDistance/comments/14cv80/my_grandfathers_amazing_ldr/,

I was under the impression that after leaving his campus on September 30th I wouldn't be seeing him again until December 14th! he called me tonight and our conversation went like this:
SO: hey, did you see the present i had your mom leave on your bed for you?

Me:um no? I haven't been up to my room yet and i didnt hear anything about a present... way to ruin the surprise!

SO: oh it's not ruined just go upstairs and check

Me:...it's not YOU is it? (i was peeking up the stairs into my room at this point to see if he was sitting on the bed)

SO: no baby, I'm not up there

and as I'm up looking around my bed and saying i dont see anything, i hear clicks at the window. my world FROZE for a second... then i heard it again, something hitting my window and air conditioner. I dropped the phone, look outside and see MY BOYFRIEND STANDING IN THE DRIVEWAY THROWING ROCKS AT MY WINDOW AND WAVING WITH A BOUQUET OF FLOWERS. I was so shocked!! I ran full tilt down the hall and practically jumped down the entire flight of stairs... 

I ran right into his arms, i honestly had no idea he was coming home. apparently my whole family AND his mom kept it a secret from me all week. he's never done anything like this before in all of our 3 years together. he skipped a day of classes for me and drove 8 hours, I was amazed and I'm so happy!!

""*She felt terrible that you were miserable. She needs to know that you are okay on your own.  Every person in a healthy relationship needs to feel that about their partner or it won’t work.  It is what builds trust and enduring love.   Remember:   Love is patent, love is kind.  It does not envy , it does not boast, it is not proud.  It does not dishonor others, it is not self-seeking, it is not easily angered, it keeps no record of wrongs.  Love does not delight in evil but rejoices with the truth.  It is always protects, always trusts, always hopes, always perseveres.  Love never fails.

Before this relationship, I realized a defense mechanism of mine when it came to love. I would try to distract myself from all the hurting in any way I could. I would shift my attention to someone else, anything else that would take my mind off the pain. After meeting my significant other, he completely changed this philosophy of mine. In one of his e-mails he wrote ""I am so happy to miss you"". Instead of avoiding the pain, he completely embraced it. The pain and sadness we have felt meant that we share something so vibrantly beautiful. 

I just wanted to share this with all of you who are saying your goodbyes to the ones that you love. This pain that you feel means your love is so incredibly alive.

The paranoia, the insecurity, the frustration, the trust issues, the Facebook stalking, probably the walls of text when we're upset. Our LDRS are so fragile that they often seem unreal. Well, I know mine does anyway. It's easy to forget he's an actual person who has other things to do besides talk to me every second of the day. 

I'm having a hard time feeling secure in my relationship. He's never given me any reason not to trust him but I find myself examining every little thing he tells me for discrepancies. I stay on edge waiting for the bottom to fall out of it all, and I feel like I need constant reassurance. If he's up 10 minutes later than usual I get upset because it's cutting into what little time we do have. I know that's silly, but I just get so worked up over stupid issues.  

It's upsetting. I feel like this LDR has turned me into a shell of who I used to be. I don't like feeling like I have to double check everything my boyfriend says for my own peace of mind. He deserves more than that. And I shouldn't feel like I'm mirroring Glenn Close a la Fatal Attraction half the time. 

The dynamic in a LDR are very different, and I realize that a lot of those feelings aren't totally unnatural. Still, I want to minimize them. I don't really need advice, just wanted to vent more than anything. I have got to quit going so girl crazy.

- Cook the same dish together.  We'll pick a recipe, buy the ingredients separately and cook them while online together.

- Write online reviews togther.  We do a lot of travelling and online purchasing, so it's fun to write and read each others reviews on [Trip Advisor](http://tripadvisor.com), [Amazon](http://amazon.com), etc. 

- Make up funny captions together on [CaptionX](http://www.Captionx.com)

- Shop for houses together.

That's the thread.

I though it was all fun and hilarious until I got to the LDR part.

I think that's a pretty dick move to pull. You don't say that shit. :/

Anyways, read the top comment and you'll see it's about LDRs, people saying they don't ever work, people saying they do.

Lets show our support over there. :3

No bashing, no getting angry. Maybe sharing some stories, and re-assuring anyone you spot who is in a LDR that they can work, and they're not a waste of time if both are able and willing to make it work.


I'd also like to remind everyone that LDRs are not for everyone. 

So what may work for us now, would never work for someone else.


Also, a misconception that people seem to think is that we LIKE being in LDRs. No one does.

""Oh well if you dont like LDRs then why are you in one?""

Because I love my SO and he loves me and we're going to make it work.


 We choose to be in LDRs because we love our SOs, and we think they're worth it. We're not in LDRs because we want to be, it's just something that happens...

In the end we had 514 people take the survey. That's around 14% of the number of subscribers at the time the survey closed (3652), which is really good! Thank you all for your participation.

Now, let's get to the numbers. (Some numbers may add to a decimal above 100%. Don't freak out. It's just rounding.) You can follow along with the summaries I present below, or you can just view the graphs and stuff [here.](http://imgur.com/a/WqZiF)

-----------------------

**Age**

-----------------------

As anyone could have guessed, the people here are mostly college-aged kids and recent grads ([pie](http://i.imgur.com/hnh3K.jpg)/[bar](http://i.imgur.com/5UHmC.jpg)). 57% of respondents were 18-22 and 27% were 23-26. We have healthy group of 14-17 year-olds, who were 6.4% of respondents, and our oldest respondent was in the 40-44 age group.

-----------------------

**Gender**

-----------------------

Ladies, you rule ([pie](http://i.imgur.com/VIO8J.jpg)/[bar](http://i.imgur.com/7ojOm.jpg)). A whopping 64.8% of respondents identified as female, only 33.7% male, and 1.6% both, neither, or unsure. On a website predominantly frequented by men, this is obviously a subreddit women are particularly drawn to. I'd hypothesize this is because men are less likely to seek out relationship advice from strangers or less willing to share their personal lives online.

-----------------------

**Sexual Orientation**

-----------------------

With regards to sexual orientation, respondents identifying as heterosexual were most prevalent, at 85% ([pie](http://i.imgur.com/qSsRy.jpg)/[bar](http://i.imgur.com/ii6f5.jpg)). Respondents identifying as bisexual were quite numerous, at 9.1%. 1.4% of respondents identified as lesbians, and 1% of respondents identified as pansexual ([pie](http://i.imgur.com/ezNbr.jpg)). In total, 15% of respondents identified as being non-heterosexual or unsure, which is far higher than the national US average and global average.

I hypothesize this is a result of the very young, more open-minded, and sexually aware audience reddit tends to attract. An interesting trend in the data actually revealed a statistically insignificant relationship between age and sexual orientation ([graph](http://i.imgur.com/cGs2D.jpg)). The frequency of respondents identifying as non-heterosexual is higher in lower age groups. I hypothesize this could be indicative of decreased social pressures to identify as heterosexual in younger generations or of a higher frequency of uncertainty or experimentation with sexual preferences at a young age. The obvious outlier for the 27-29 age group is worth looking into as well!

Along these lines, it is interesting to note that above the age of 27, no respondents identifying as non-heterosexual identified as male. Every non-heterosexual above the age of 27 identified as female or both sexes. This could be due to the greater representation of females in r/longdistance, it could be statistically insignificant (My statistical know-how is limited, but we also had very small samples sizes for the over-30 age groups), or it could be some other form of sampling bias. I'm not sure!

-----------------------

**Relationship Status**

-----------------------

87% of respondents were dating or in a committed relationship ([pie](http://i.imgur.com/BbLXE.jpg)/[bar](http://i.imgur.com/JwZUz.jpg)). Once again, my apologies for not distinguishing between the two in the answer options! 9.3% of respondents were engaged or married and 3.7% were single. Respondents also indicated a number of other relationship arrangements ([pie](http://i.imgur.com/YN11R.jpg)).

-----------------------

**Location**

-----------------------

Our respondents come from 51 countries ([table](http://i.imgur.com/3H7JU.jpg)/[pie](http://i.imgur.com/VWau6.jpg)/[bar](http://i.imgur.com/epbub.jpg)) and reported living in 45 countries ([table](http://i.imgur.com/OCTOw.jpg)/[pie](http://i.imgur.com/uNBh3.jpg)/[bar](http://i.imgur.com/96LP6.jpg))!

64.6% of respondents reported living in the US, followed by 7.3% in Canada, 8.5% in the UK, 2.9% in Australia, and 1.9% in Germany. Other top countries included the Netherlands, Ireland, Sweden, Singapore, and New Zealand. Respondents to the survey represented every continent on Earth, [including Antarctica.](http://i.imgur.com/6foTt.jpg)

Respondents' SO's live in 52 different countries ([table](http://i.imgur.com/ZEr1s.jpg)/[pie](http://i.imgur.com/Viz69.jpg)/[bar](http://i.imgur.com/Auinb.jpg)). A higher proportion of respondents' SO's live in Japan compared to respondents who reported living in Japan. Interestingly, every respondent with a Japanese SO did not come from or currently live in Japan, and 8/9 were male *and* heterosexual. So what's up with Japanese girlfriends, everyone? :-P

-----------------------

**How did you meet your so?** *and a call to action to help our nevermet friends.*

-----------------------

Most respondents - 58.9% - first met their SOs in person, perhaps in their native countries or while traveling, working, living, or studying abroad. The other 41.1% met online! ([pie](http://i.imgur.com/s8qlq.jpg)) *27.5% (nearly a third) of those people have never met, and many of them have been together for a long time ([table](http://i.imgur.com/qa1b7.jpg)). Maybe we as a community could help change their nevermet status if they are struggling with that.* Especially for those people who live in the same country yet have been separated for so long, that's a bummer on my conscience.

-----------------------

**How long have you been [in a relationship] with your SO?**

-----------------------

Respondents are across the board with how long they have been with their SOs ([pie](http://i.imgur.com/ApUZd.jpg)/[bar]( http://i.imgur.com/GKLTF.jpg)). 20.5% are new to the game and have only been together for less than 6 months. 26.9% have been together for 6 months to a year, 26.9% for 1-2 years. 4.1% are our relationship veterans of 5+ years!

-----------------------

**How long have you been in a LDR with your SO?**

-----------------------

The respondents indicated a similar proportion of lengths of their long distance relationship within their current relationship ([pie]( http://i.imgur.com/1OU65.jpg)/[bar]( http://i.imgur.com/vbrln.jpg)). 31.4% began their LDRs recently, within that last 6 months, and the most respondents, 34.5%, have been in a LDR for 6 months - 1 year. Only 0.6% have been in a LDR for 5+ years. That's perseverance, people!

Here's a cool table that shows the frequency of LDR duration for a given relationship duration ([table](http://i.imgur.com/5FUbE.jpg)). For respondents who have been in a relationship for less than 4 years, most of them have been in a LDR for the entire relationship. Only for respondents with a relationship duration of over 4 years do we see that a larger proportion of respondents have not been in a LDR for the entire relationship. It would be interesting to explore the cause of this secondary trend displayed in the table. It could be due to respondents who began their relationship in high school or college, and were then forced into LDR by college or graduation. I'll take a look at the data and see if it supports this hypothesis.

-----------------------

**How much longer do you expect to be in a LDR?**

-----------------------

The length of time responders have left in their LDRs varies considerably, but a mode of 25.3% had 1-2 years remaining ([pie]( http://i.imgur.com/s3Svz.jpg)/[bar]( http://i.imgur.com/Gczdu.jpg)). 20.7% have 0-6 months remaining (likely due to the end of the spring semester and the many responders who are no longer in LDRs and were forced to answer the question anyway). 17.5% of responders were unsure how much longer they would be living away from their SO.

-----------------------

**Raw Data**

-----------------------
Well, I think that’s all the data I have for you today! I had so much fun with this. (It’s 4:00AM for me right now haha) If you'd like to play with the data yourself, I have uploaded it [here.](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/pub?key=0Au4Gi6z1Ks4ydERIeXpORS1Dc1BxS1B6WE5yRE1tTVE&amp;single=true&amp;gid=0&amp;output=csv) It's a .csv document, which you should be able to open with Microsoft Excel. If you find a interesting trend in the data that was not discussed here, let us know in the comments!

Also, [here](http://imgur.com/a/WqZiF) is the imgur album to view all of the graphs and tables I linked to above.

I have omitted the raw location data for now due to privacy concerns. I may consult with the other mods and make an edited version that preserves everyone's privacy a little more. Best to be careful.

I pulled my first successful surprise visit!",89,10,14,http://www.reddit.com/r/LongDistance/comments/145hfh/as_someone_who_has_learned_not_to_be_impulsive_in/,"I wish I had a photo, but the plan was so short-notice I didn't even take a camera! I work very irregular hours at my job and I get my new schedule at the end of each week, so I rarely get to make long-term plans. When I found out that I had Friday and Saturday off, a rare two days in a row I hadn't requested...I was thrilled. I didn't think I could afford a trip to see him though, so I resolved to take care of some things around here. I knew he'd been stressed about his job lately, and he'd just been here for Thanksgiving. I just wanted to be in communication with him.

However, the stars aligned for us somehow. My dad borrowed my car and returned it to me with a full tank, my aunt and uncle gave me my belated birthday and graduation cards at the same time, both with cash in them, and I was able to make next month's student loan payment early with enough left over to drive to him and back.

I texted his roommate to find out what their plans for the weekend were and it turned out that he had no plans and both roommates would be away for work. Perfect. I got off work Thursday night at 6 and I had decided, packed, and firmly hit the road by 8pm, only informing one of his roommates that I would need the door left unlocked or someone to sneakily let me in.

As I drove, I worried that he would figure it out, as I was not online for the first time in months, and hadn't texted him for the entire four hour drive. I also worried that he would find my impulsive plan intrusive or sneaky. Or that he had some secret plan for the weekend and I would be cramping his style. But I realized that all the times I'd been put in that situation, where I was viewed as an inconvenience or intruder had been with others, not him. It was still so hard for me to refrain from calling him and screaming ""I'M ON MY WAY TO SEE YOU OMG DON'T GO TO BED EARLY PLEASE.""

Still, when I arrived around midnight my hands were shaking, and I was nervous and excited and wired from driving all evening. When I walked into his room and saw his face, and his genuine surprise and excitement at seeing me, all my worries gave way to joy. I apologized for being sneaky, and told him I hoped that it was okay that I just showed up. He was in disbelief, he couldn't understand why I was even worried about that. I've never felt so loved in my life.

I know this is just a big story about surprising my boyfriend, but this is possibly the biggest risk I have ever taken. Before I met him, I was not a romantic. I learned that taking risks and sacrificing for others most often led to being seriously hurt. This is the first time in my adult life that I have felt safe and secure enough in a relationship to do something so spontaneous and bet on it being well-received...and being right.

I am incredibly happy, in love, and sad to be back in PA this morning and heading to work soon. I can't wait to see him again. Most of all, though. I am relieved to know that I am loved and that he was touched and excited about my surprise instead of freaked out. I am glad to know that there will not be an Overly-attached-girlfriend meme made about me.

TL;DR: Took a risk and drove four and a half hours to surprise my boyfriend. Was worried about how it would be received. Was met with a long and happy embrace, and a magical weekend. &lt;3",,False,,t5_2s6ky,False,,,True,t3_145hfh,http://www.reddit.com/r/LongDistance/comments/145hfh/as_someone_who_has_learned_not_to_be_impulsive_in/,

The only reason I ask is because it gives the rest of us a good idea about your relationship and it also gives us some hope that we are not alone, regardless of age or situation.

Personally, and this where I feel that I may be downvoted to oblivion, but I really cannot see how a relationship can truly exist unless there has been at least one meeting. So when I read a post about someone who has been together for 2 years, it gives me a little hope. But when I find out that they are both 16 and they have never actually met each other, I can't help but feel a little disappointed.

Me: 23

Her: 22

Today marks one month until my wedding day to my one and only girlfriend,  I figure it's a good time to share our story with all of you.

We first became friends in 6th grade.  That was the year students at our school would start going to dances, and the first one of the year was the Halloween themed dance.  She had a long-time childhood crush on her best friend, and planned to ask him to the dance, but when another girl beat her to the punch, she had me as her back-up.  After a little hesitation, I agreed to go.  I cringe at seeing the awkward looks on my face in the pictures from that dance.

But the idea of being a couple (if you can call it that in 6th grade) sort of grew on me after that.  I'd send her valentine grams, I'd always split my Reese's 2-Packs with her, knowing it was her favorite candy.  As the 6th grade year wound down however, I learned her family was moving from our hometown in CA to AZ.  It was odd, part of me felt crushed, but part of me still wasn't sure if I should be using the word ""girlfriend"" yet.

It would be 6 years before she came back to California again.  In between that time were weekly phone calls, sending hand written letters for birthdays, holidays, or just to say hello.  Then there were those wonderful days where we managed to visit each other for a few days out of the year.  I never even thought of leaving her.  I couldn't feel the same looking at another girl the way I did with her.  It got rough watching my friends get into their relationships, seeing them and their SO's holding hands or sneaking off to go make out somewhere… it was something I rarely got to have.

But by the time college started for the two of us, I was the happiest I had ever been.  She moved back to California, about a 20 minute drive away.  Because I was unemployed, it was hard to pay for my own gas, but I still managed to spend most weekends with her.

Then she got the crazy idea in her head of marriage.  She started mapping out ideas of where we could live, where we could go to school…  It scared the hell out of me.  I turned down the idea multiple times, saying that there was simply no way it could work.  But there was a quiet little voice in my head saying ""But what if it could…""  After a lot of time and thought, I agreed to give it a chance.

The day came where she could no longer afford to attend college here in CA. 2 years ago she moved to the place we had agreed to move to when we would marry.  It was painful to go back to a long distance after having such beautiful time spent together.

But now in just 1 month, 9.5 years after we went to the dance together, we will never have to leave each other again.

I'm rooting for all if you in a LDR.  It's a rough thing but if you can pull through, and if he/she is the right one for you, it'll be more than worth it.

My partner and I met in a MMO 3 years ago and after a long road filled with ups and downs we have finally been married. I'll be moving to Canada (Vancouver) from New Jersey in October for good! 

Anyway, I wanted to post to provide an example that LDRs can work. Love can conquer distance though I know the pain each mile can bring. I wanted to offer some advice, the things that helped me hold together and get me through it all:

1) Communicate often. Communicate everything. From the most important to the most mundane. When you boil an LDR down, it's all you really have.

2) Have set dates, both for a possible end to the long distance but also for visits and events, even online hanging out. Having a tangible time frame is crucial to staying sane but it also builds a foundation of accomplishments for the relationship. Every time you set a part of your day aside for a movie or a phone call, or a visit occurs, or anything for you as a couple, you've just added another brick into the wall that forms the stronghold of your relationship. 

3) To go the distance, give it your all. LDRs are extremely emotionally trying, often expensive, and complicated things. They are not good for just testing the waters as you usually do not have the safety of a normal relationship (being close to home, having the extra time etc.) Going back to number one: spill your guts, pour your heart out on the table. Hold nothing back. An LDR requires everything you can give and then some. 

I think of you all as I enter my new life and I wish every single one of you the best of luck. ",,False,,t5_2s6ky,False,,,True,t3_1kdv7u,http://www.reddit.com/r/LongDistance/comments/1kdv7u/3_years_over_3000_miles_we_were_married_yesterday/,

I just want to get this out there.

There's been quite a few posts about people who complain when others tell them their SO is gone for a couple days. [Basically posts like this.](http://www.reddit.com/r/LongDistance/comments/1evdop/mrw_my_friends_talk_about_how_hard_it_is_not/)

Just because people are trying to relate to you, or have a hard time when they can't see their SO for a week, it's no reason to feel like you have it waaaay worse and their feelings don't matter. 

If you are used to being together daily and then have to be apart for a week or something, it can still be very difficult for that person. Yes we struggle in our LDR but it's no reason to assume we are suffering way more then others are. In most cases, we chose for being in a LDR.

In the end we want all the same thing: To be together. 

Anyway, I needed to get this out. I've seen a lot of posts complaining about this, but it's rude to anyone who might try and relate with you. Sure they don't fully understand perhaps, but it is no reason to put them down for having a tough time also.

1361913764.0,74,self.LongDistance,19a6k0,Long distance relationship... over 30 years apart,88,14,12,http://www.reddit.com/r/LongDistance/comments/19a6k0/long_distance_relationship_over_30_years_apart/,"Four weeks ago I was contacted out of the blue by a girl I met when I was young and crazy, over 30 years ago. She had been introduced to LinkedIn by a colleague, and my profile was one of the first she went looking for, just because she had wondered about meeting people from when she was young free and single. After a quick mail exchange we spoke on the phone for over an hour, and as I will be flying out for meetings from an airport near her home in the near future, we made arrangements to get together when I am travelling.

Two weeks ago, after further mail exchanges, we started to chat on Skype and soon realised that we both would like to get together sooner rather than later. We are both in our 50's and divorced, and seemed to still share many similar values and interests. In fact she told me of the many things I introduced her to all those years ago, that she still enjoys and considers her favourites... 

So on the Friday night, I agreed to travel 3hrs down to her house the following day for a get together and a meal. I offered to book into a hotel but she argued that there were plenty of spare bedrooms I could use at her house, her 2 daughters were away that weekend, and the guest bedroom would be a much better option, and allow us to both enjoy a glass or two of wine.

I arrived at lunchtime, and as soon as I saw her it was as if we had never been apart. In reality we never actually stopped caring for each other, work had taken me away from her at the time, and she was very busy with accountancy exams, we had just lost touch with each other, and never really split up... We had lunch together then walked arm in arm around her home town chatting and catching up on 30 years of news. I had promised to cook her a meal, the same dish I had cooked for her on our first date, and we had fun collecting all the ingredients.

While I was cooking dinner, she sat with a glass of wine and we chatted again about our lives, I had been divorced only last year while she had brought her daughters up single handedly since her divorce in 1999. The memories flooded back when we were eating the meal, and we talked non stop as though we had never been apart.

That night, she showed me my bedroom, and we had one last embrace before going our separate ways... except that we didn't, both of us missed having someone to cuddle in bed, so we agreed to share her bed... It was incredible.

You would imagine that after being separated for over 30 years we would have forgotten everything about each other's bodies, and what things we both liked. But no, we made love countless times (condoms all over the bedroom floor...) and had hardly any sleep at all.

After I went home, we chatted constantly via Skype and text, often for several hours. For the past two weeks we have hardly had a waking hour out of contact with each other. We could not get together last weekend as we both had other commitments, but the coming weekend we are planning to spend every possible minute together. Her youngest daughter is back at Uni, while the eldest has agreed to go and visit her boyfriend, and give us some space.

Her daughters and their boyfriends were ganging up on her last weekend, jovially giving her a hard time about having a sleepover with a boyfriend from her very distant past, and warning her about  taking safe sex advice seriously. They have never seen their mum with a guy since the divorce, which was when they were very young...

This coming weekend we are playing golf, going to parties, meeting her friends and cooking great food together. We have also been discussing how and what we want to do to each other in bed, and again, it is as though those 30 years never happened. I cannot believe it is possible for a couple who parted, albeit without actually stopping caring for each other, over 30 years ago, to pick up again as though nothing had happened. But that is exactly what has happened...

If anyone is interested, I will post an update after the weekend.

**tl:dr** Couple who never actually split up 30 years ago get back together as though nothing had happened, and continue the relationship, but possibly even stronger than before.

**Edit 1:** Thanks for so many lovely comments, I thought you guys would appreciate our story. Will post an update after the weekend.

We only live ~1 hour apart, but money and poor scheduling prevents us from getting to spend much time together.

I was at a family thing today and I was talking to my aunt and her sister in law about trying to find a better job so I can eventually break into my field. The sister in law was coming up with all of these different options...which might be decent if I wasn't in a relationship. We've been long distance for the entirety of our relationship and I could see it on her face when I said I can't just up and leave without him that she thought I was being juvenile and not thinking ahead. Like my career is more important that some silly relationship. 

It's not as if I'm a kid trying to go to the same college as my SO just because I don't want to leave him. I'm an adult with a legitimate relationship that needs to be taken to the next level and soon. We love each other like crazy but there is no way we will last if I move any farther away and it's not right to expect me to put money first. Especially when half of her ideas were nothing even related to my field or what I want to do.

I'm just frustrated because I feel like a lot of people don't take us seriously. And damn it, we're the most awesome couple ever.

It’s basically an exclusive instant messaging app between you and your other half. Now I know these days communication isn’t a major problem for most people now, due to Skype, Facebook, email and the millions of other methods of communication, but this app is slightly different. On the face of it, it’s similar to using whatsapp. To me, the special thing is that it’s between two people only. When you sign up, you are paired with your other half and off you go!

With Couple you can share photos, videos, voices and drawings with your partner and they all get saved into a memories folder within the app. But two cool things grab me about this app – 1. Thumbkiss, where you touch your screen with your thumb, whilst your partner does the same and when you match up both thumb prints, you “kiss”. 2. Secret photos, you can send photos that your partner can see for 10 secs when they open it and then the photo gets deleted after its viewed and cannot be seen again (this is obviously for those intimate photos). 

Whilst everyone may not be as excited as about this app as I am or have already heard it of it, I thought I’d share it anyway :)

Also it’s free!

(Pictures of proposal included!)",78,3,29,http://www.reddit.com/r/LongDistance/comments/ov5kx/45_year_relationship_3_years_of_it_ldr_while_shes/,"Hey guys. I'm fairly new to reddit, but imagine my joy and surprise when I discovered an LDR sub-reddit!

I'm going to tell you a story. Hope you don't mind the length…

Nine Inch Nails put out a new album in 2007. Year Zero. You may have heard about it. What you may not have known was that there was a very intensive ARG (alternate reality game) that went along with the story of the album up until it was released.

The culmination of all the hard work was a private show for 25 Nine Inch Nails fans and their +1s.

I was fortunate enough to be one of those 25. Adrienne was the other. On the NIN web forums I announced myself, letting people know if any of the other 25 folks wanted to meet up before hand to let me know. Adrienne, being new to the area, decided to meet up with me and my friend, along with her +1, her roommate.

We hit it off instantly, and at the end of the day she ""accidentally"" left her cell phone in my car. I got in touch with her and asked if she wanted to go see a movie with me after she got her phone. She said yes, and that was awesome.

I ended up driving to LA every day that week to hang out with her and her friends (I lived in Ventura, CA, which was about 45 minutes away from LA). At the end of the week, we were out on the town with our friends, a little drunk, and after some great NIN karaoke, I walked her back to her place, and we kissed.

Things went smoothly for a long time. After she finished up some classes in LA, she found a job near where I lived, and she ended up moving about a 5 minute drive from me. Things got even better. She was over practically every day, we'd cook and play games and watch movies all the time. We said our first ""I love you""'s and wow it was just amazing.

And all too fast. I graduated from college and had to make some major decisions. Adrienne couldn't stay in California anymore. It was right when the recession hit and the jobs just weren't there. She was thinking of going to Law School but couldn't afford to continue living out in California AND save up for it. She needed to move back to her home in West Virginia. I, on the other hand, was completely free to make any decision that made sense. I had just graduated and nothing was tying my down to California. I decided to move back home (in NYC) and see if I could get a job there.

So we packed up our boxes, I sold my car and she kept hers, and we drove across the country. It was likely the best trip I've ever been on. We talked lots, we were quiet just as often, listening to one of several audio books we picked out for the drive. We stopped in Arizona, Texas (San Antonio, beautiful city at night), New Orleans (our favorite city by far), South Carolina to visit my grandparents, and then to our respective homes.

We were terrified at that point that it may be the last time we'd see each other, even though we didn't discuss breaking up, it was a scary prospect. We stuck it out though. We tried visiting each other at least once a month, when possible.

Then she got a job that literally almost killed her. The hours were 13 hours a day, 6 days a week. The overnight shift. She started work at 9pm and left work at 9am. The job was an hour away from her home, so she'd often stay at her grand parents nearby.

One morning she was driving... and she flipped her car. She walked away with barely a scratch and bad concussion. The car was totalled. I'd never seen a car look so ruined. Adrienne was in tears often from that, and suffered from slight PTSD (still does a bit). And I couldn't be there. I was working a crappy job in NYC and I could not be there. It was the worst feeling in the world. To make matters worse, she still had to work. The pay was incredible, so much so that it paid for her first year of law school, but it was the most stressful time our relationship has ever suffered.

We barely spoke because of the difference in hours. She'd be sleeping when I was awake, and bored and awake all night while I was sleeping. We'd never been so far apart emotionally. So much so that we were both secretly fearing that our SO was going to dump us for something more convenient.

That didn't happen though, and the job finally ended. Then came the question... Law School. Where?

She had two main choices...

One. Go to New York Law School. They weren't offering a scholarship, and they didn't have all the courses she was interested in. She would be significantly closer to me, but would put herself in the same poor house the California nearly put her in.

Two. Go to Loyola Law School in New Orleans. It would be significantly further away, but they were offering a hefty scholarship, many many classes she wanted, and she could afford it.

I insisted she go to New Orleans, even though I knew it could mean the end of our relationship. Her future meant the world to me, and I didn't want her to go broke trying to achieve it. We're nothing if not practical.

After a few more visits, the day came when she had to move to New Orleans. As it just so happened, my family trip to New Orleans actually ended 2-3 days BEFORE she moved there... so I couldn't even be there to help her move in. Another crappy set back, but by this point we've learned to roll with it.

School started, and as anyone who's been to Law School, or dated someone in law school, you would know that this isn't like a normal college curriculum.

""What ya up to?""

""Studying.""

Always. And forever studying.

But that was okay. I began a really good job in Manhattan that paid very well. Around this time Adrienne and I were discussing me moving down to New Orleans with her, but for several reasons it never came to pass. Be it money, time, or maybe I was just not ready…

Needless to say she wasn't happy. But we moved past it. We continued along this path for a long time. We texted each other good morning every morning and we were usually the last people to speak to each other at night. Always the same routine… ""Goodnight! I love you! &lt;3 :-*"" Routine is good in situations like this.

Our typical routine consisted of:
- Good morning text
Text each other mid day… see how the other is doing… (usually we're both busy at the start of the day)
Get home and talk on iChat most of the evening… even if it's not constantly chatting, just keeping the chat window open while doing other things… cooking, gaming…
Send each other a photo of ourselves once a day. Just to have that connection.
Talk till bed time when we can
Video chat every weekend
I'd send her flowers from 1800Flowers once in a while just because

We'd visit each other every few months. I'd come for Mardi Gras, for some special events, she'd come to WV and NY for the holidays often, and during the summer. Every time seemed greater than the last.

There were fight along the way. Several. Some big and some insignificant. Sometimes I felt like I was being forgotten, other times she needed to vent. We were there for each other in the end though. Never go to bed angry. Talk things out.

Seriously. If I could impart one word of advice to any LDRs… NEVER GO TO BED ANGRY. Oh, and jealousy is poison. Jealousy is the acid that burns a hole through even the stronger relationships.

Marriage started coming into the picture. We were talking about what to do after law school… what our lives would be like afterwards… and we both realized that all our images of the future had each other in them.

I began looking for an engagement ring in August, and by the end of September I had the perfect one.

I was planning on going to New Orleans for halloween, but little did she know I'd be coming down a little early. I colluded with her brother, who she was living with in New Orleans, and he helped pick me up from the airport while she was in class.

He brought me to the French Quarter, where I waited… and waited, till he brought her there under false pretenses. She didn't even see me until I said ""hey hun!""

She was in total shock… ""What are you doing here? How did you get here?""

""i didn't want to wait another day."" I took her hand, got on one knee (my bad knee, doh!)… ""Every since we started dating I knew you could be the one…. the first time we passed through this city, I knew you WOULD be the one. Will you marry me?""

Well… Our wedding is this August in New Orleans at a local art gallery! While we're still long distance for the time being… She graduates in May and begins studying for the bar. Thankfully she's doing the studying in WV so we can see each other when possible. We're moving to DC after the wedding.

Friends… fellow LDRers… I am here to tell you that not only can long distance relationships work, they can help your relationship grow stronger and flourish into something beautiful. We've had so many ups and downs, in the end we came out on the other side with a great understanding of each other and ourselves.

I won't say I always saw where this was going, but the picture became clearer and clearer all the time.

Keep it up everyone, the outcome may be unexpected but it will lead you to great places if you really want it to.

Nearly 5 years later… I am 25 and she is 28. We are ready to begin our lives together.

For the rest of us, we're sending them off on the 23rd! :)

I'd like to add that we still don't have anything to identify our envelopes with.

While I was thinking symbols... why not a small quote? A long distance love quote. One that's short and sweet, for example:

""Distance is to love as wind is to fire""

Just write it on the back of the envelope, right in the middle on the bottom.

So we have a few days to decide, write your ideas in the comments.

Finally, a little survey to see who's participating and who isn't. **Just [click here](http://www.surveymonkey.com/s/DTHV6RH)**. It's real short and sweet, just a couple of questions.

In less than 3 days I am hopping on a plane to my SO, a fellow redditor, for good. We will be wed in January next year.

With almost 11,000 miles (or about 18,000 kilometers for the rest of us) between us, I can honestly say that I have found my soulmate.

After meeting in Milan a few years ago and being swept off my feet by this handsome American stranger we undertook the long and sometimes difficult journey that many of you lovely strangers have chosen to take.  We have been able to live together for short periods of time and have spent almost a year and a half apart, but shortly before I had to return home this during this most recent visit he popped the question.  With visas sorted out and a Long Distance Wedding almost organised I'm excited to just be back in his arms.

1368407966.0,73,self.LongDistance,1e7teu,My Catfish Relationship for over two years.,82,9,58,http://www.reddit.com/r/LongDistance/comments/1e7teu/my_catfish_relationship_for_over_two_years/,"I was in a long distance relationship for over two years. This is a note of caution I guess, as I'm sure there's someone out there who is in a similar situation. I know the person I was speaking with was a female, so that part wasn't a lie, the part that was a lie was the fact that she ever wanted to meet up with me. We spoke on the phone for hours a day, she never wanted to skype or video chat which I always found weird.

I had maybe ten pictures of her, I knew she had two kids (they were always in the background) and I knew what her job was. I knew where she lived as we would sometimes send letters, and I knew a lot about her life. It was always odd though, whenever we planned on meeting up something would come up, her ex-husband wouldn't take the kids, or a work emergency, and it just continued from there. 

We told each other everything, I believe there was a part of her that cared for me, but honestly I think I was just a welcome respite from her daily life, a distraction, etc. I poured my heart into the relationship, and it just never paid off. I bought things for her kids, talked to the kids quite a bit, and I just imagined myself as a part of their family. I never thought too much about the not-seeing-each-other thing, as I figured at some point it would work out. 

It never did. I wasted two and a half years of my life on that relationship. It was depressing, it's fucked with my head, it's made it hard to form new relationships, and to give myself to someone new. I have a best friend who I completely love, she loves me, she wants to date, but I just can't trust anyone after that. 

So, my advice...and I'm tipsy so I felt like coming on Reddit to give random advice is...if you've been in a long distance relationship for over six months, and you haven't seen the person, find a way to set-in-stone a visit...or walk away. It'll hurt, it'll suck, but at the end of the day you've walked away free and clear. If not, you might end up like me, and it'll hurt way worse, and it'll fuck with your head.

Any questions let me know. I'm not bashing LDR's, I've been in one other (previously) and it was really great, I just want to warn anyone who is like me, holding onto a hope that will never present itself.

Just a bit more background information. I moved to Oklahoma (from Indiana) to be near her. I uprooted my life, didn't move to the same city (didn't want to shock or impose myself into her and the children's life). I stayed there for 5 months, never saw her...stuff kept coming up. I moved back to Indy with my tail between my legs, but she suckered me back in and told me she still wanted to be with me. Anyways, it's been a year now, free and clear, and I'm gradually getting better.",,False,,t5_2s6ky,False,,,True,t3_1e7teu,http://www.reddit.com/r/LongDistance/comments/1e7teu/my_catfish_relationship_for_over_two_years/,

I had just entered a LDR and was looking for inspiration. At the time, the posts were positive, helpful, and without judgement. Distance was distance. I saw flare from less than two hundred miles to several thousand.

Now? Negativity, judgement, and a constant struggle to one-up a personal trouble. 

Distance is distance is *still* distance. 

Each kind of relationship (Friends, family, short distance, long distance, temporary separation, coworkers, etc…) needs trust. For my specific LDR, I've found that my SO and I need to trust that despite our distance it is still us against the world. We need to trust that we can fight the struggles that come his way, my way, our way together. That we are Batman and Robin, Superman and Supergirl. Once upon a time, I felt that the support offered here provided a similar mentality. We all struggle, why not lift one another up and out?

I admit to being on the lucky side of a LDR. Until February 1, I will be within driving distance of my SO. It's an all day trip, but who cares? If someone were to have a three hour or even less drive, I'd still pity their ass sitting in that uncomfortable chair. Come February 1, we will go back to a necessary plane ride. The drive would be a little too long (Though I do plan on trying once). For the time being, we are in the same time zone, and then longest I've gone without seeing him is a whopping six whole weeks (and I feel no shame in admitting that I hated every moment of it). Hell, in November I got to see him twice! 

This subreddit has morphed from a retreat to a place I check into occasionally. There is still wonderful things posted to this place. There are still people offering support, but there are too many belittling other's problems. What once felt like a hug, now feels like a bite. 

I've had an issue that I've been struggling with for the past few weeks, but I've been hesitant to post here for mainly two reasons. **One** I see my SO on a steady schedule. There is no if, only a when, which many posts have led me to believe that I'm neither worthy or welcome here. **Two** I've been afraid that by seeking support and/or advice, the end result will be an all around more despondent feeling. 

Problems are problems are problems. I have a firm belief that judging other's pain on your own subjective scale is ineffective. A child who fell and scraped their knee for the first time is probably experiencing one of the worst physical pains they will have experienced as of yet. Does that hurt worse than a broken limb? To someone who has done both, no. But that child has never broken a bone. There is no worse pain imaginable. Sometimes, the second heartbreak or fifth is more painful than the first. No one's pain is superior to another's. No one's struggles are worthy of ridicule. Sure, another's struggle or pain may appear trivial to someone else, but I believe they still deserve support or aid. 

As such, I will be unsubscribing.  

I genuinely wish a happy ending for all y'all. ",,False,,t5_2s6ky,False,,,True,t3_14i5nh,http://www.reddit.com/r/LongDistance/comments/14i5nh/why_i_am_unsubscribing/,

Now-a-days, LDRs have become a little easier thanks to the wonderful thing that is [The Internet](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Internet). Communication is a click away, and you are able to share activities, games, and make memories while your SO is miles away. Sometimes though, we can become overwhelmed, since it's so fantastic and vast. So here's a list to help everyone out a little bit.

_______


**See eachother!**

Messangers like [Windows Live Messanger](http://explore.live.com/windows-live-messenger), [Yahoo!](http://messenger.yahoo.com/) and [Skype]( http://www.skype.com/intl/en-us/homepage) are great for voice and video chatting! (They also have a bunch of games you can play with your SO!)

Gmail offers [Google Video](http://www.google.com/chat/video) (not to be confused with [Google Talk](http://www.google.com/talk/)), which allows you to see your SO through VERY high quality web based video chat. Of course, you'll need a Gmail account to use this.

[Tinychat](http://tinychat.com/) is a great and easy way to see eachother! Quality isn't the best, but it's fast and requires no sign up. HOWEVER, For added privacy one of you can sign up so that you can password protect the room.
______

**Play games together (for free!)**

*I'd like to mention that anything listed on here will be free. LDRs are already expensive (visits, sending gifts and mail and such) you want to save up your money so you can see you SO, right? Here everything you do will be free. You already pay for the internet connection. No more expenses! Pfft~ :D*

* [Steam](http://store.steampowered.com/ ) - Steam offers free to play multiplayer games! TF2 and Spiral Knights are great. 

* [IJJI](http://www.nexon.net/ ) - IJJI offers a bunch of free games as well! 

* [Nexon](http://www.nexon.net/ ) - These are the creators of MapleStory, they also have a bunch others you can play. Last I heard, you can get married in MapleStory as well!

* [Pogo](http://www.pogo.com/ ) - Great place for board games! You get your own avatar and can dress it up, too! http://www.pogo.com/ 

* [HTML5 Games (multiplayer)](http://html5games.com/category/multiplayer/) - Good to just jump in and have fun. Some need specific browsers to work so please read through the description of the game. 


* [Club Penguin](://www.clubpenguin.com/) - I HAVE NO SHAME! 

* [RuneScape](http://www.runescape.com/) - I'm... I'm a little embarased for posting this, but... yeah. It is what it is, haha.... ha...yeah. *[hides away in shame]*

* [Dofus](http://www.dofus.com/en) - Played this years ago, I think it has an F2P area. Fun if you like turn-based battling.  

* [Realm of The Mad God](http://www.realmofthemadgod.com/) - Pretty fast, jump-right-in kind of game! See for yourself. Try not to die! You'll lose EVERYTHING!
_____________________

**Draw together!**

* [Flockdraw](http://flockdraw.com/) - Great with no signup commitment. Just draw together. Combined with a webcam this can be very fun. 

* [RateMyDrawings](http://www.ratemydrawings.com/) - This is a drawing community, you need to sign up and there's a small waiting period before you can use a group board (just to make sure you're not a troll) the tools are more advanced. Very fun if you're both serious about drawing. 

* [iScrrible](http://www.iscribble.net/) - Like rate my drawings, though I do believe (if I remember correctly) the group drawing is available immedietly. Great tools, very fun! :) 

* [Dabbleboard](http://www.dabbleboard.com/) - This is more of a collaboration board for planning and stuff... it's nice to show off pictures, or if you want to help with a project. No signup required. :) 
______________________________________________
**Listen to music or watch movies together!**

* [Synchtube](http://www.synchtube.com/) - A great way to watch Youtube, Vimeo and other movies, shorts, and music together for free. Sign up, make your own room and password protect it for privacy. http://www.synchtube.com/

* [Livestream](http://www.livestream.com/) - Sort of like Synchtube, just more advanced. You can stream yourself playing games or movies or just make an ""autopilot"" of all the things you like and leave it running all day. It's free, though there is an upgrade avaialable.  http://www.livestream.com/


* [Mumu Player](http://www.mumuplayer.com/) - An awesome way to share music! You pick a song from your hardrive and upload it. When you play it, they hear it with you at the same time! http://www.mumuplayer.com/

_________________

**Keep a Blog/Diary together!**

* [Blogger](http://www.blogger.com/home?pli=1) - Blogger allows for one person to create the blog and add other administrators/moderators/posters. So just one of you make it and add the other. Keep a secret blog together... it would be a nice suprise to see what the other posted while you weren't looking. :D

* [Wordpress](http://wordpress.org/) 

* [Live Journal](http://www.livejournal.com/)


* [Tumblr](http://www.tumblr.com) - Great for blogging. :D You are able to use a password  so that only you and your SO are able to edit it. This allows you to leave notes and photos for each other!

Oh lawdy, that's all for now. I'll keep adding stuff and ""categories"" as they come.

If you have any suggestions please leave them in the comments so that they may be added onto the list. :3

If sending dirty pictures/video or having sexy Skype dates works for you, go for it! Tons of fun. However no matter how much you trust your SO, there are obviously some risks associated with this kind of activity. If that's not for you for any reason, I wanted to share one of the no-risk sexual things that my SO &amp; I like to do together. 

While we're apart (we're seasonal LDRs) we have a shared google doc with all of the things we want to do to each other when we're reunited.  It's either fantasies either of us have, positions, or sex 'challenges'. We get ideas from our own desires, cosmo, badgirlbible, reddit, &amp; anywhere else we can find. GoogleDocs is the best because  either of us can edit it &amp; the changes will show up without having to actually email the document back &amp; forth. Also, if you &amp; your SO want to edit it at the same time, there is a sidebar where you can chat. Sometimes we'll spend an hour weeding through ideas on the internet and contributing to the list simultaneously. It's been a fun way to spend our time &amp; get out some sexual energy, but most of all it's great for communication. We get to be really open about sex, find out what our partner really wants &amp; give it to them. Best of all worlds. 

I love the ideas you all have shared with me. This community is awesome so I figured I'd share mine too. Let me know if any of you decide to do this and how it goes!",,False,,t5_2s6ky,False,,,True,t3_xvpt4,http://www.reddit.com/r/LongDistance/comments/xvpt4/norisk_sexy_time_idea_for_ldrs/,

A guy in his 30's and I were were talking about laptops, then Skype came up, he mentioned getting really intense and animated in Skype calls and, I don't even recall the exact moment but mentioned, but somehow it came out it was with his SO. I laughed and told him I know that feel. He inquired so I mentioned my LDR love. 

He then proceeded to tell me about how he kept up an LDR with a girl in Eastern Europe, he was in Canada. That's a 12 hour flight and 10 hour time difference. Then for a while he did law school in the UK, so that was a little easier. They saw each other 2-3 times a year on average part of the time because of distance, then because school was involved. 

They held on for 7 years!! 
Then they got married but it didn't end there, they proceeded to do one more year of an LDR while he sponsored her to move to Canada with him. Now they are happily married and together &lt;3 

He encouraged me and said there will always be easier and harder days, especially getting more difficult as the years build up and you start wanting to settle down, when you no longer have school as a distraction.

Some of us may have it worse than others but we don't have the right to not acknowledge the shorter distances. I only get to see my SO once an year either for two weeks or less ,never more. I think this is hard but I am sure some of you who are reading this would wish they were in my situation. We all are valid. We all are going through something we don't deserve.

To me, this subreddit, is where I come to disappear from the harshness of LDR. To talk with people who understand LDR. 

If someone posts something that they don't like, it is showered with downvotes. Opinions are downvoted. When someone said that vacations are not long distance. OP got so much abuse. There is so much against us, why do we have to be the ones against each other?

I liked seeing couples photos because to me. thats where I get my comfort, to know that somewhere out there two people in love just like me with their SOs who are far away. Photos are comforting and so are the txt-based ones. 

Being in Uni, I am always in the run, when im feeling shitty, I look at the photos and gives me a sense of hope and happiness.

This subreddit, to me is where nothing was limited. I felt like all 8,889 of the LDRers were my friends and I found comfort in that.

We are already forced to do long distance, why do we deserve to be forced again, into limiting what we can post about LDR

This was my escape. and I want it to be my escape once again.

I hope you guys feel the same.

She promised that if I did tell her she would do the same. After we both spilled everything out, I half jokingly asked if we were now married. She replied by saying I haven't proposed yet (she later admitted to be trying to get me to propose by saying that) I said I could change that right then. I wanted to ask right then, but I felt as if she would say no, due to it being over the internet, rather than in person.

I very uncharmingly then asked if I was crossing a line, because I wanted to ask, she said I was nowhere near messing up, but stated that I've been saying that I want it to be a surprise. I told her I could always propose again in person, and make it a surprise then. I asked her to marry me, and she said yes.

I never thought I would be posting a LDR success story here, I always thought she'd end up realizing she's to good for me, and end it. I'm really glad I was wrong.

However, the past two weeks, I've been blown away by my SO. He's been able to make it some of the ""big"" moments in my life that I never thought I'd get to share with him because of the distance. He was waiting for me at the finish line of my half-marathon. He took off work to be there for me when my grandfather passed away and even stayed at the funeral until the very end, even though I couldn't. He held me at night when I was overcome with sadness from missing my grandpa and he reassured me that everything would be okay.

LDR's are hard, but sometimes they make things mean so much more when you can actually share huge parts of your life. Those moments are even more invaluable than what I had originally thought.

I was looking at the most recent card you sent me, turning over the envelope in my hands, and thinking: this has travelled thousands of miles. Somewhere, as I stare out of my window, there's a lady out there who loves me. I put my phone and laptop away and that concept just hit me again, like a sledgehammer. Yet: it was your hand; your own hand; which formed those words. There's an element of incredible intimacy in the juxtaposition of the physical distance and how close we feel to each other sometimes. That's something special. Something modern and unique in human history. We're writing history as amongst the first couples to have somehow built what we have at the distance we have. And how each message bounces along an impossible network of wires, past countless settlements, diving through and under an ocean which once took 20 days to cross. And this message will appear on your phone as if you were right behind me. It makes all of this even more meaningful to me. That is all.""

The last time I posted here was under a different account, seven months ago. (My SO and I actually created new accounts together on the same day in April so we would have the same cake day :p). A lot has happened in those seven months! I'll admit that we have had good times and bad times in that period. But overall, they have been seven wonderful months.

I have been with my girlfriend since June last year (a bit over 13 months now). Last Summer she was in Canada and I was here in the UK and we spent a lot of time looking at and talking about posts on this subreddit and picking up a lot of good tips on how to have a successful long distance relationship! Since then, we have spent most of the past year in different cities in the same country (we study at different universities), still long-distance, but thankfully not quite so long (so we got to see each other a lot on weekends).

In September I will go to Canada and finally get to see her home and where she grew up and meet her family and friends from home... and I am so excited!

Long distance can he hard sometimes (god, I wish I could give her a hug right now), but on the bright side - we get to experience the food and the highlights and build amazing memories in twice as many places as we would otherwise!

But I've missed being able to cuddle up with him and watch whatever was on Adult Swim, since we both live really busy lives and only got time to lay around together after normal people had gone to sleep already. I never really realized how much comfort and solidity that gave my life until I went without it for four months, especially knowing that it'll be June before I see him again.

Last night, though, after he spent an hour fighting with and cussing at the drivers on his computer in order to make screen-sharing work over Skype, we finally got to lay around and watch *Futurama* on Netflix together for a couple of hours. It was a little laggy and out-of-sync on my end, and the back of my mind kept remembering that I didn't have his arms around me; but it was still so comforting that I almost cried at the opening credits.
