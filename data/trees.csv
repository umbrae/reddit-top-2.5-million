Observe:

- First 5 minutes covered that cannabis was once a legitimate medicine, prescribed by doctors and dispensed by pharmacists.
- Explained how cannabis was outlawed and the propaganda that pushed it through (reefer madness, crazy foreigners raping your women, etc)
- US Army veteran has a child with terrible seizures, they try everything else, and finally cannabis saves the child's life.
- Shots of legitimate university research, with quotes from scientists saying ""we'd like to study the benefits but can't due to government regulations""
- A chart that shows Heroin, Cocaine, Cannabis and Alcohol (!) on the same chart described as drugs, with alcohol having a higher rate of addiction than cannabis. 
- Israeli Minister of Health talking up Israeli research into cannabis.
- Israeli holocaust survivor says ""cannabis saves me from the darkness""
- Dr Sanjay Gupta actually says ""cannabis could cure cancer""
- More scientists saying ""we want to cure cancer but regulation is stopping us""
- Final scene is US Army father of child cured by cannabis says ""Thank God we have something that works""
- All served up by CNN's Surgeon General and all-around good guy, Dr Sanjay Gupta.

As I'm standing in line getting ready to order a sandwich, an older lady walks in. I'd say, early 50's late 40's. Right upon entering, her eyes swoop over to me, and don't leave. The entire process of me and her ordering her sandwich, her eyes were on me. I started to get a little creeped out, so if figured i'd just go sit down and eat my food and ignore her. 

Wouldn't you know it, she sat down 1 table past me, and facing me. We were the only two people there besides the workers, and sure enough, her eyes didn't leave me the whole time. Eventually, it got to be a little too much for me to handle, so I got up to leave. As I was standing up, she starting crying, hard.

I walked over to her at that point, being a naturally caring person. I asked her what was wrong. (struggling to speak) She replied with, ""My son died two years ago of heart problems. You look just like him. This might seem odd to you, but can I please give you a hug?"" 

I said yes, of course. She wasted no time. She grabbed me and squeezed hard and for a long time. And boy she just LOST it. I've never heard sobbing like it before. I heard the pain, the sadness, the memories, just, EVERYTHING in this old woman's cries.

The Subway workers saw, and even they started crying as well. I was just numb. I hugged her back and stayed strong for her. But this whole time, I was really high. And this lady gave me the biggest, strongest, most potent reality check I've ever received. 

She told me she'd empty her bank account to have that same experience there again.

It really made me think about what's important in life. I guess I came here to say... Ent's, weed is great. It truly is. But don't forget what's important. Maybe instead of buying that next gram, go buy your mom some flowers or something. I spent the next hour after that calling my family and telling them how much I love them, and I hope this story inspires you to do the same.

Thanks for reading.

Now it has moved onto the house of delegates where they need to pass it, and then onto Governor O'Malley. Legalizing Medical Marijuana is also up for legislation, so ask your delegate for support on that issue as well to help out those who need it. So...


What we need to do:


* Email your local delegate and say you are in favor of them supporting this bill, it doesn't have to be a super long email. Just kindly ask for their support with a bit of reason behind it

* Email Governor O'Malley and also ask for his support on the bill


Here are links of information about the bills that are in progress of being passed:


[http://www.mpp.org/states/maryland/](http://www.mpp.org/states/maryland/)


[http://norml.org/news/2013/03/29/marijuana-decriminalization-measure-introduced-in-maryland-legislature](http://norml.org/news/2013/03/29/marijuana-decriminalization-measure-introduced-in-maryland-legislature)


http://blog.norml.org/2013/03/28/maryland-norml-testimony-in-favor-marijuana-decriminalization



There is also a **full legalization bill** that is also in the same boat (HBHB 1453), but in my opinion most likely will not be passed on the first go around. But, it wouldn't hurt to ask your delegate and the governor for their support on this either (again, with a bit of reasoning behind your argument)



Edit: formatting


**Edit 2:** Thanks for the awesome support guys, I didn't think this would get so much visibility. Unfortunately, I have been informed that both of these bills have been killed already so we were too little too late. I didn't realize the session had ended. Maybe we can try again next year when they reconvene in January 2014",,False,self,t5_2r9vp,1365550591.0,,mflb,True,t3_1bzvrm,http://www.reddit.com/r/trees/comments/1bzvrm/decriminalization_just_around_the_corner_for/,

1) Go to a favorite / beautiful smoke spot and get yourself set up

2) Prepare some weed for consumption. The key here is to have your weed prepared in a way that you can smoke it with your eyes closed (you'll see why)

3) Close your eyes

4) Smoke as much as you can while keeping your eyes closed. After you're done smoking, keep your eyes closed for another minute or two, and let the weed really sink in.

5) Open your eyes

All of a sudden, when you open your eyes you're high in a place that you last saw when you were sober, and it's an awesome feeling.

**TO ANYONE THAT IS GOING TO CALL OR HAS ALREADY CALLED**
&gt; [Please take a second to read this comment.](https://www.popvox.com/bills/us/113/hr499)


This guy knows what he's talking about. When you call, you need to ask whoever you're talking to something along the lines of:
&gt; ""Hi. I'm calling concerning House Resolution 499. I would like (Congressman) to cosponsor this bill. Will he do so?""

Please people. Please take the time to make these calls if you're from these districts.

WE NEED TO TAKE ACTION NOW!
A SUBCOMMITTEE OF OUR NATION'S REPRESENTATIVES ARE CURRENTLY REVIEWING [HOUSE RESOLUTION 499: THE ENDING MARIJUANA PROHIBITION ACT OF 2013](http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/bdquery/z?d113:h.r.499:).

This same report is available in many languages and listed below.

* **We SHOULD use POPVOX**
&gt; POPVOX bridges the gap between the input the public wants to provide and the information Members of Congress want and need to receive. Designed by [people who understand Congress](https://www.popvox.com/about/team), POPVOX is different from other political sites. It is not a discussion forum. It is a place for action. For more about the site, see [About POPVOX](https://www.popvox.com/about) or [Why It Works](https://www.popvox.com/about/whyitworks).

[Popvox - H.R. 499: The Ending Federal Marijuana Prohibition Act of 2013](https://www.popvox.com/bills/us/113/hr499)



* **WE SHOULD WORK WITH NORML**
&gt; NORML's mission is to move public opinion sufficiently to achieve the repeal of marijuana prohibition so that the responsible use of cannabis by aduls is no longer subject to penalty.

[NORML ACTION ALERT](http://salsa3.salsalabs.com/o/51046/p/dia/action3/common/public/?action_KEY=9976)

NORML is an AMAZING organization and we MUST do our VERY BEST to get as much help from them as possible.  They have the ability to reach out to many, MANY people that can help our cause and increase our numbers!



* **WE SHOULD CONTACT OUR REPRESENTATIVES!!!**
**THIS IS THE MOST IMPORTANT**

When contacting your representatives you must keep in mind that the representatives of YOUR district are TOP PRIORITY. Contact them in every way possible and make sure everyone you know that cares about legalizing trees is contacting them too!

Other than that, it is important to raise awareness so others can contact these representatives!

**PLEASE READ THE EDITS AT THE END OF THIS POST AS THEY OFFER VALUABLE INFORMATION REGARDING OUR CAUSE**

HERE ARE ALL THE SUBCOMMITTEE MEMBERS AND MANY, MANY WAYS TO CONTACT EACH!!!

[PLEASE SIGN THIS PETITION](https://petitions.whitehouse.gov/petition/endorse-hr-499-and-end-federal-prohibition-marijuana/VfjCHHTN)

&gt; This is long over due, help agriculture, people and the economy and put an end to the antiquated and unfounded prohibition of marijuana. As one of the world leaders we owe it to ourselves and the rest of the world to set yet another good example on this issue.

Edit 2:

Here is some AMAZING information to give to anyone that DOESN'T support the end of prohibition.

Please call the Maine House today in support of LD 1229, ""An Act to Tax &amp; Regulate Marijuana"". The vote is imminent and we are very close to passing the minority report on the bill. In fact, two members of the Criminal Justice Committee have switched their votes and will be voting with us.

Maine House: (207) 287-1400

The minority report JUST sends the question to Maine voters this fall. If voters decide they want marijuana legal, the Legislature will develop the regulatory structure next session in an open, transparent and public process. 

Thanks for all you do - we are very, VERY close right now!

Regards,

~State Rep. Diane Russell
Portland, Maine

I didn't have febreze or fucking shit, so I did the next best thing: started frying bacon.

They came inside a few minutes later after getting some statements from other tenants and immediately comment on the bacon and how great it smells. 10 minutes later, they were out the door.

We then enjoyed bacon, 8 o'clock at night.

Just because being high is so good, and brings you so much happiness and joy, doesnt mean that you should let yourself get sad or depressed when you are sober.

that being said...

&gt; Marijuana is a massage for the mind, it is like a trip to a spa, admittadly for some, myself included, it can be an all day afair. Or all week afair. But when the weeks turn into months it can be useful to take a break. Think of it as a rest period. 

Tell your body and mind that all though this vacation is comfortable, marijuana isnt magic. If you dont do this every once in a while, too much of a good thing, can start to wear away at you, and eventually you are going to get really tired. You are going to feel your tolerance skyrocket and those sober moments are going to feel more like a ball and chain. 

Force yourself to take a T break once in a while. Once you finish your stash, wait to pickup even though you have plenty of cash. 

As the country begins to tear away the mental blindfold that is prohibition, and cannabis becomes easier to obtain, and is even sold in stores we finally have the opportunity to openly enjoy one of lifes greatest feelings. Do that, enjoy it, but remember what i stated earlier. 

Getting high is much better when you can enjoy being sober as well.

Today the Harper Gouvernment is tabling a bill to enforce a minimum prison sentence for cannabis. One plant equals 6 months in prison*. Judges won't be ALLOWED to give less. Another year is slapped on the sentence if it's near a school, and yet another year if it's in a residential neighbourhood. Want to make some edibles so that you don't damage your lungs by smoking? It's a shame judges will NEED to give you one year sentence MINIMUM if they catch you**. Same applies to hash.

But wait! It get's better! With the omnibus crime bill coming in, police will be able to spy on whatever you do and say online, without a warrant! 

It fucking makes me sick just typing this. Harper gets a majority and he wastes his effort locking up peaceful cannabis consumers.

We need to raise awareness, we can't let this happen.

*The bill itself says 5 plants = 6 months, Marc Emery's Facebook said 1 plant is six plants.

**If you attend a rehabilitation program, they don't need to give you the minimum sentence. But by attending rehab, you in turn would become part of the statistic. ""100 000 Canadians were in rehab for abusing marijuana this year, clearly this dreadful drug needs to be stopped""

**Something can be done**

Start by calling your Member of Parliament and let them know how you feel about this bill. You can find your representative using this. 

http://parl.gc.ca/parlinfo/Compilations/HouseOfCommons/MemberByPostalCode.aspx

Marc Emery's Facebook suggests this passage if you reach their voicemail.

""Harper's crime bill is going to increase crime and cost billions of tax dollars, as proven by the United States' example. These same laws in the United States made that country more dangerous from increased crime, put them seriously in debt from billions in prison costs, and have violated people's privacy and freedom. Please do everything you can to stop this dangerous bill from being passed. Thank you for being my representative and representing my views, which are shared by millions of others.""

Some of you have noticed that r/trees has been lacking in style lately. Because of the new rules on here restricting anything not directly relating to marijuana, trees has become rather lackluster.

The only posts we really see anymore are these:

-Kief in grinder
-Interesting joints
-Piece broke
-New piece
-Saw ""420"" somewhere
-Nug pictures (Gets a bit tiresome after awhile) 

I miss what trees used to be, when posts had a much larger range then above, and when we wouldn't have to post half our content to r/see. I hate r/see! It belongs on trees!

Please upvote for visibility. We need to show the mods our thoughts.

1359643711.0,2110,self.trees,17mph9,Don't bother trying to buy weed from a cop,5957,3847,388,http://www.reddit.com/r/trees/comments/17mph9/dont_bother_trying_to_buy_weed_from_a_cop/,"It was about 11:30pm last night when a buddy called asking if I wanted to go over to his house, burn one, and ride out to the local late night food trucks to grab some grub. I was already at a [7] but I'm not one to say no to food and especially not one to say no to some BUDdy time so I agreed. 

By 12:30pm I had come down to about a [5] and was also just now leaving my house. Despite ultimately planning on eating at the food trucks, I decided to stop at a gas station to grab a few doughnuts to take advantage of the late night ""We're about to throw these away take as many as you want"" deal. I walked inside and there were no doughnuts. Probably noticing how apparently distraught I was, the clerk waved me over and held up a bag of donuts saying that she had just emptied the case out for the night. I told her I'd just like two of any kind of doughnut that's not a jelly doughnut. I like jelly but I'm still at a [5]. I'm clumsy at a [0] so I was just thinking ahead. The clerk then explained to me that if I only wanted two, she'd have to charge me for them. Perplexed as to whether or not laws regarding store purchases had been reversed, I replied simply ""I know."" Then she continued. 

""I can give you these two and charge you for them or I can give you this entire bag for free.""

Thirty seconds later I was walking out of the gas station with a small trash bag containing no less than thirty assorted flavors of doughnuts. I finally left the gas station and about a mile down the road I realized that I needed gas. This was particularly frustrating for the obvious reason that I had just left the gas station however that frustration was short-lived as I reached into my back seat and grabbed a doughnut. Regardless of my gas situation, tonight was going to be a good night and another gas station stop only meant more time to eat doughnuts. 

A few miles later I pulled into another gas station. This is one of those gas stations that seems to be a hangout for cops. I don't know why but they do all of their chatting inside by the bathrooms. As I pulled up to the pump, I parked behind a K-9 police officer who was digging through his trunk. I had no drugs or paraphernalia in the car, just a bag of doughnuts and glossy eyes, so I wasn't worried about an encounter with the officer. As I was about to get out of my car, the cop was shifting some stuff around and lifted, for a split second, a massive bag of marijuana. I'm talking close to a pound. Then the cop turned around and looked at me to see if I had seen that. Not knowing how else to act in that situation, I laughed. As I got out of the car, the officer (probably noticing the giant bag of donuts hanging out of my car) smiled and said ""Want some?"" to which I quickly replied ""Depends how much you're selling it for."" We both shared a hearty chuckle and then the cop closed his trunk and drove off.

I wanted to share my story.

August 1st, 2010, my 2 best friends and I were arrested for marijuana possession at a sobriety checkpoint. I was personally charged with possession with an intent to sell because I had .9g, a pipe, grinder, scale and 2 baggies on me. At the end of the month, I was given a no-contact order between the two friends, one of whom I've been best friends with since 6th grade. I was given a plea bargain to drop the felony to a Misdemeanor, which included 100 hours of community service, fines, LADC counseling, 2 years good behavior, the no-contact  order extended for the 2 year probation, and a choice: I could either be a narc and make 3 buys for the police, or take 10 days in jail. I took the jail time. I spent part of my winter vacation from college in jail. While in jail, I told people my story. After hearing how long I was on probation, I had a few people tell me I would be back, that no one could stay clean and no one could stay out of trouble for that long. I had nightmares about this for at least half a year afterwards, that I would accidentally fuck up by getting a speeding ticket, or something dumb like that. During my LADC counseling, my counselor told me that willpower is worthless, and the only way to turn my life around is to cut off all ties with people who make bad decisions; including my good friends who helped keep me from smoking the entire time. Throughout all of this, my girlfriend has been by my side at all of my court dates, she walked me into jail, and listened to me freak out when I thought my life was over. 
As of midnight today, I am finally off probation. I just called my best friends, and now I'm drunk celebrating the fact that I did not fuck up, I'm still in college getting my chemistry degree, and my life is still on track. I don't know where to really post this, but I figure you guys may appreciate it.

TL;DR-Got arrested, charged with felony, went to jail, just got off probation 2 hours ago. Drunk.

Casually, I walked to the front door to see what's up, and saw my neighbor and his teenage daughter in an argument. I stood there for a moment, then they saw me and the daughter blurts out, 'see, even the neighbors smoke pot... and they aren't crackheads!'

Her parents are teachers and I assumed they aren't cool with trees, so I was very confused. I looked at them, confused, for maybe 20 seconds when I realized that I had been holding my bong in my hand the whole time.

I ran inside and packed a bowl. Yikes!

I was just wondering if there would be enough interest in a comprehensive joint rolling tutorial.

This would be either a long video covering different styles and types, or a video series - each video covering a certain aspect of rolling.

I could make videos about rolling roaches, rolling bigsticks, small joints - you name it.

Now I'd be very much willing to do this, as long as there's enough people interested and willing to take their rolling skills to another level!


EDIT: Seems it's a go! Will start making a video series ASAP.

**Recreational (fully legalized)**

Washington: Initiative 502.

Oregon: Measure 80.

Colorado: Amendment 64.


**Medical**

Massechusetts: Question 3.

Arkansas: Issue 5.

Montana: IR 124.

If you live in these states, *please* for the sake of ents everywhere (including those whose local drug policy is lead by the U.S.A.), vote YES on these initiatives. Encourage your friends and family to vote! It's the beginning of the end of cannabis prohibition, so let's get the ball rolling! 

Figure out what time tomorrow you will get to the polls and how. If you need a ride, call a friend today. Don't wait until tomorrow to arrange a ride because you might not make it in time. If you have work, make sure you know when you will be taking off to vote.

Edit: Thanks for the upvotes to get this to the front page, /r/trees! This is a momentous occasion for the legalization movement and you're doing your part! (but don't forget to actually VOTE tomorrow!)

Yet alcohol is perfectly legal, and honestly causes many more problems from an emergency medicine standpoint. Many, Many times have I had patients in drunk driving accidents that have maimed themselves, friends/family in the car, pedestrians, or people in another car. Many, Many times I have had drunk patients physically hurt loved ones, friends, or some random person at a bar. Not to mention all the alcoholics that have seizures because they are withdrawing from alcohol. If you didn't already know, one can actually DIE from withdrawing from alcohol. With all of this being said the my point is- where are all the patients that are high on marijuana? How come they aren't stabbing their boyfriends? Why aren't they a trauma patient that was an unrestrained driver that rolled their car multiple times and caused their girlfriend in the passenger seat to have her arm amputated? (true story btw) Where are all the marijuana ""addicts"" that are having a seizure from withdrawals? There are none! From the context of what I see Alcohol is the root of many, many more problems than marijuana.  The only time marijuana is a problem for us in the ER is when folks lace it with PCP, that is just....just a shit show for us and EMS on scene. Rant over, thanks for reading, toke on, and I'll always be supporting you /r/trees folks.

Anyway, today was for the highlight reel. Let me start you at the beginning so you can get the full picture of how this day went:

7 am: I wake up. I am a 3D artist, studying to work in the post production industry in Hollywood (think about Game of Thrones; environments are mostly fabricated in CG, the dragons are obviously animated). I'm awake for probably five and a half minutes before my roommate hands me a beautiful new bong filled with excellent orange weed. Today is starting off in the best way.

830 am: I am fully baked out of my mind. I continue working on my senior thesis project, which is a re-creation of Detroit's Michigan Central Station, which was abandoned in 1988. Fast forward to several hours later, after not having eaten or showered yet this day.

2 pm: One of the faculty members at my school informs me that I've been chosen to receive the Artistic Achievement Award at my college. This award is only given to one person in each department at the college. This award comes with a number of perks, so naturally, I am ecstatic. I emailed my mom and dad immediately (me and my parents have an awesome relationship).

230 pm: My dad emails me back and lets me know that he just happens to be in town for his job, and all his expenses are paid so he can give sales presentations to local businesses. He says there may be enough time to grab a drink later if all goes well.

5 pm: I am at my apartment getting ready to go drink with my dad. I'm 22, and I've had limited drinking experiences with my parents, so I still get excited about that shit. Anyway, I get a little skating in, practice my kickflips and hardflips a little, and my dad meets me at the pub, literally 100 paces from my apartment. I love this pub. We have a great conversation, his engineering buddies are very impressed and congratulatory towards the award that I received, and my dad pays for all the drinks. Fucking great time.


9:39 pm (right now): I've ended the day chillin' with a childhood friend that I don't get to see often, and a couple of my roommates. I'm hanging out in my room, getting blazed, and drinking a 40 of Labatt while playing Skyrim.

9:40 pm (actually right now): if you've actually read this wall of fucking text, I applaud you, and you've contributed to my immaculate day. I love everyone, and I am well, WELL-stoned. [10]

**Edit: This totally blew up overnight, front page?? Topping off the amazing day. Just from other posts like mine, I knew r/trees would be the best place to post this. You all are excellent, thanks so much for the comments. I'll be reading every last one.**

I can drive to Washington State and get myself baked to high holy heaven, with little to no harassment.  Should I do the same in my homestate of Virginia (or carry any of the trees back home with me), I face up to five years in prison, with the state officers claiming, ""We don't care, but we're just following the federal law.""

A few years back, it happened to be Willy Nelson. When I found out it was a private concert, I was heartbroken, because being baked at a Willy Nelson concert was on my bucket list. As I headed back to my house off campus, I saw a tent at a local business with a sign saying they were doing a drawing for tickets to the concert. My heart jumped while at a low [3]. I immediately turned my car into the parking lot and started talking to the people there. I signed myself up and my girlfriend just in time, 3 minutes before the drawing. My girlfriends name was drawn and we had tickets!!!!! First thing I did was make a 3 paper joint with as much good bud as I could fit in it. Fast forward to the concert. It was awesome! The music had me feeling awesome and I had the 3 paper joint carefully tucked away in my pocket in the rare opportunity I would meet Willy. After the concert, I'm headed back and notice his tour bus with a bunch of people around it. I went and stood over by it for a few minutes and Willy came out and shook hands and took photos. When he got to me, I got my picture taken, thanked him for an awesome show and handed him 3 things: my ticket, a sharpie, and the 3 paper joint. A smile crept into his face and he motioned for a guy to let me inside the barrier. I got really excited and couldn't believe what was happening. I sat over by the side of the building by his tour bus with who I guess we're mostly his roadies. About fifteen minutes pass and I'm wondering if he had forgotten about me. But then, out of nowhere, I hear, whew, that sure is a big joint you rolled there son, you use your whole allowance on that one? It was Willy!! At this point, he pulls it out and sparks it up. After taking a few puffs, he passed it to me, and I passed it on after a few more puffs. We kept passing it around the circle and just talked about random stuff. He asked a little about me and was just really nice the whole time. After we smoked, he said he was tired and had to get somewhere and I went on my merry way. It was like chilling with the ultimate grandpa that smokes trees and plays awesome music.

2. Friday is Saturday here in Australia, and as reddit is based off central time that is just plain butts
3. My proposition is to move self-post day to monday. Why? Because that's the start of the week- it just makes sense to share news and stories about weekend adventures

tl;dr- it's just bad timing. listen to me, or not, no-one cares.

Although I have happily consumed it in the past, I do not currently consume cannabis in any way.  I plan on changing this in the future, for the reasons I will give below.  So, I've decided to write this rather lengthy article to help educate those with little experience on the history, scientific and legal realities of the use of this plant. I guarantee you will find this read to be fascinating no matter your experience, and I promise it won’t get too detailed.  I researched and wrote it completely myself.  There is so much more I could include but I want this to be accessible to anyone.  If you have any more questions, please comment or PM me.
With Love,

Names:
**Q. What are the names of cannabis, and why am I calling this plant cannabis throughout this letter?**
A. First, I am scientist with a degree in molecular biology.  The plant otherwise known by many names, most commonly marijuana is scientifically known as Cannabis. The term “marijuana” is derived from Mexican Spanish and its etymology is debatable and generally unknown (1). During the crackdown on cannabis in the early 1900’s, the term marijuana or marihuana was used by the government and media to tie the plant to the anti-Hispanic sentiment that was going around the country at the same time (2). There are hundreds of other names for the plant and its derivatives: weed, Mary Jane, pot, hemp (the low THC plant used for making paper and fabric, among other things), grass, ganja, skunk (because it can smell like skunk spray), herb, hashish (the crystals from the plant containing almost exclusively THC and cannabinoids, which have been smoked in Asia since early recorded history) and many more. Not to mention that each “strain” of cannabis is given its own name, some of which are quite interesting.

**Q. What’s a strain?**
A. Just like with flowering plants, such as roses, there are three different kinds or varieties of cannabis and many different hybrid strains.  There is Cannabis sativa, Cannabis indica and Cannabis ruderalis. Cannabis sativa and Cannabis indica usually contain higher levels of THC and Cannabinoids and are therefore the kind most commonly smoked. Cannabis ruderalis contains lower levels of these compounds and is more often used for industrial production, such as hemp.  However, all three of these varieties can be bred with each other to produce hybrid plants with different physical and compound producing properties. The various hybrids and breeds lead to different “strains” of cannabis and I will get in to the effects of these in the scientific use section. You may hear strain names such as Afghan Kush (an indica strain from the Hindu Kush mountain range) or White Widow (a hybrid strain, white for the whiteness of the crystals covering the bud, and widow as in “black widow” because its effects are very strong) or Outer Space (a sativa strain that has strong cerebral and creative effects).  Some of the names are rather crude, but remember, this is a plant that has been lovingly raised by the counterculture for the past hundred years. 
 
**Q. You just used the term “bud”.  Why?**
A. If someone is smoking, vaporizing, eating or otherwise consuming cannabis, they are probably consuming the bud of the plant. Cannabis is a plant or bush just like any other plant or bush in the beautiful flora of this world.  It grows from the earth, it buds, flowers, uses leaves to collect solar energy, and uses wind to pollinate and spread. The buds of the plant are where the highest concentrations of THC and cannabinoids are found. Properly cultivated, these buds will produce crystals which grow on trichomes, that contain almost exclusively THC and cannabinoids. While the rest of the plant, the leaves, stems and roots contain very little psychoactive compounds and are therefore better suited for the commercial production of hemp, hemp oils, and many other derivatives.  You can smoke or consume other parts of the plants, but they may have unpleasant side effects. If you are buying cannabis to consume, you should look for the buds, which look like green nuggets with no discernible leaves. They should be covered in very tiny clear crystals and sometimes they will have red to orange pistils sticking out of them. The buds may also be purple in color, which typically indicates an indica strain, but is not necessarily indicative of high cannabinoid content as some believe.

As a father my heart is just shattered for those families. Put my daughter down tonight, kissed her bebe and closed the door and I a grown man sat down and cried.

It's time that we as a community got to work and do what we do best. 

The families need HELP! Immediately. As in now. 

They need grief counselors, psychiatrists, volunteers, mental health professionals.
Many will need to leave work for the next few weeks/months.
Many also don't have the luxury of a salary or insurance or the option of just...... grieving. 
It's not just today and tomorrow. It's a week from now, a month from now, 6 months from now. 
They have to clean out a room. Pick up toys...for one last time. Put blankets and clothes away. Just..... I can't even begin to rationalize that thought.

So let's get to work. Let's get some volunteers in mental health on airplanes. Let's pay some hotel and air bills. Let's pay for dinner for the next week. Month. 
Let's put some money in an account for them so they can keep their lights on. 

Let's pay for some funerals. 

Let's do SOMETHING!!!

I have servers, domains, websites, SSL's, merchant accounts. I'll pay all of the bills. It's meaningless to me.

turns out burning the stuff creates hydrogen chloride gas which on its own is bad enough, but when bubbled through water then creates hydrochloric acid.

1. **Respect your environment:** clean up your trash, be polite, and leave the spot as clean or better than you found it. 

2. **Respect others around you:** treat the host of a party well, be friendly and ask others how they are, be genuine.

3. **Don't be a mooch:** if you don't have weed at a sesh with others, inform them. Tell them that if they'd like to share you'd be more than happy to blaze, but don't simply think you're entitled. 

4. **Be knowledgeable:** don't act like a fucking idiot. If you call yourself an ent you're an ambassador to those who don't smoke. Represent.

5. **Don't be a stereotype:** don't reinforce the negative aspects of stoner culture.

6. **Don't let the weed control you:** weed isn't physically addicting, but it can be mentally. Enjoy the herb, thank the herb, but do not let your life revolve around it.

7. **Be a chiller:** You got that high going on, so enjoy it. If you like to be social, do it. Be confident and kind. If you like to observe, do so. Don't tell anyone how to act when they are high. We are all different.
 
8. **Watch Grandma's Boy:** Like really. Go watch it.

9. **Enjoy what others enjoy:** Do you feel awkward at a party? Find a group sitting together and ask them questions. Refrain from your own opinion. People tend to generally want to know who the kind chiller is in the back of the party making everyone laugh and talk.

10. **Be happy:**Life is hard. It will always be hard. Take a hit, exhale and think. You will wake up tomorrow. Talk to a friend. Life is a journey, and there are always bumps along the way.

If you have not completed and mailed in your ballot please show up at your polling places and represENT! If you are familiar with the situation arising East of LA then you are aware that Prop F must be passed for the good of all patients, communities and business owners. Without Prop F passing, every shop opened after 2007 WILL BE FORCED TO CLOSE. This will put hundreds out of work, stagnate local economy, raise prices, and increase patient difficulties obtaining their medication. If you have further questions please comment below and I will do my very best to answer them. Also I hope all Los Angeles ENTs check out [/r/palmtrees](http://www.reddit.com/r/palmtrees/) to keep our local family connected. 


On May 21st Los Angelenos will vote to choose between propositions regarding the medical marijuana community. Ents must be aware that they must vote YES ON F to protect patients, neighborhoods, children and taxpayers! Below are the reasons D DOESN'T WORK and you must vote YES ON F:

* Ordinance F is the only way that our City will properly and reasonably regulate medical marijuana but at the same time provide access to patients and caregivers that need medical marijuana.
* Provide increased revenue to our City to fund police, fire, and education costs by raising taxes from medical marijuana by 20% (from $5 to $6, not 20% overall)
* Increase safety within dispensaries by requiring background checks of all managers, employees and volunteers who distribute medical marijuana;
* Ensure safety and purity of the medicine for the sick and elderly by requiring dispensaries to test and analyze medical marijuana for pesticides and toxins;
* Demand financial transparency by requiring dispensaries to file with the City Controller an annual audit of its operations that is reviewed by a CPA;
* Reduce congestion in our neighborhoods by requiring dispensaries to provide parking for patients;
* Keep our children safe by denying access to children under any circumstances.
* Mandatory parking for dispensaries, alleviating neighborhood congestion.

Proposition D does not require testing for medicine, does not require financial audits, allows minors into dispensaries, and does not require background checks for collective volunteers. Prop D also limits the amount of collectives in the Los Angeles area to 100, closing any shop that is not pre-ico/established before 2007. This would create a monopoly and eliminate free market opportunities to open collective, driving up the prices and wait times sky high.

YES ON PROP F is the only answer to evolving the relationship between medical marijuana patients and the neighborhoods and governments we live with. It benefits patients greatly while also offering economic incentives to communities offering much needed resources at a difficult time.

I've been high, at least a 2 at all times, for the better part of a decade. Last week I decided to give up weed for February (Sobruary). 

About three days in, I was having terrible pains in my abdomen and spent most of my day on the toilet. Basically my life consisted exclusively of cramping and crapping. So, I decided the go see the doctor.

He asked me all sorts of questions about behavior, I've always been open with him that I smoke often (with much merriment) - which lead to the question about my current pot smoking habits. When the doctor found out I had stopped smoking herb, his face went a little flat as if he had figured it out.

A few large machines and tests later, it turns out that I have irritable bowel syndrome. The doctor thinks I may have had it for several years and that my smoking habit had masked the symptoms well. My doctor's conclusion was: ""Go smoke up""

TL;DR : I used weed as a medical treatment for a disease I didn't know I had for years.

Edit: Front page of trees? Woo! It's really cool to see that our community cares about the healing properties of our precious green - and not just getting wonderfully, fantastically stoned. 

Edit 2: I've noticed several comments linking marijuana withdrawal to digestive/GI issues - however some cursory research seems to indicate that its the STRESS associated with breaking a habit that causes these problems. That's why I should note that I have panic disorder and am medicated adequately for anxiety (xanax, 6mg/day) - so stress was ruled out as the cause very quickly by my doctor.",,False,self,t5_2r9vp,1360213731.0,,,True,t3_180las,http://www.reddit.com/r/trees/comments/180las/stopped_smoking_for_the_first_time_in_years_for/,

* A [repetitive slogan](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Repetition_%28rhetorical_device%29)

* Use of [""Virtue Words""](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtue_word) like peace, happiness, security, wise leadership, freedom

I decided to smoke up before my chemistry lab (I felt like it was a proper class to go to high). I was at a good [6] and I entered the lab. I felt good, not one of those ""OMG IM IN PUBLIC OMG THEY KNOW"" kind of highs; I was relaxed. I meet my lab partner for the first time, he seemed like a nice fellow. We were making peanut brittle for the lab. One ingredient was butter. He unwraps the butter and hands it to me. Right as I grab it, it slips out of my hands and lands flat on the ground. He and I both look at it, then at each other. After a few seconds of silence he slowly says ""dude..............butterfingers"". We both start to explode with laughter and I say ""Man I am really high"" and he confirms in response with a ""Dude...me too!"". That is how I made my first ENT Friend in college.

The End.

He sits down next to me and says this. ""Now son, I have no problems with the Groovy Ganj, Just don't let it affect your studies at college, and don't be an idiot.""

I helped her out sometimes by taking her trash out for her, things like that. So the other day she calls me over there and asks if I would pull some weeds for her.. I agree, and as I'm pulling, we get to talking about her past. She has lived there in that same house for 41 years, she told me all kinds of stories about what the town was like way back in 1972. She was a Flower Child, and a damn cool one. We got to discussing weed, and I mentioned that I smoke occasionally. I mentioned that I had some back at my house, and she said she would smoke it with me. I go get it and come back to her sitting on her chair, pulling out her piece, a gorgeous glass one she named after the guy who gave it to her. We smoked and talked for hours, and I learned a lot about this incredible woman and the life she's lived. She told me about the mistakes she's made, she gave me the best advice I've gotten to date.

Back last September I had a road traffic accident on my motorbike involving a car and a 44 tonne truck.
I was in hospital for a total of 10 months originally with a 5% chance to survive. Heres a link to my AMA post for all who are interested about the full story - http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1cuxm0/iama_18_year_old_who_survived_going_under_a/

Every single day, every hour, I suffer from chronic nerve pain in my legs and feet. It feels like there is a thick copper wire running through my legs and every so often it connects to a car battery, feel me?
I take a wack load of nerve pain killers such as pregabolin and amatriptaline also oxycodone and oxynorm for example to try and manage the pain, so much that I am always drowsy and lethargic.

One single bowl of this wonderful all healing plant and it sets me free of this nerve pain making me able to live a normal as can be life, happier and makes coping with my disability even easier.
Now I'm slowly decreasing my pain killers with my pain team! 

This ones for all of you ENTs + Saplings and this amazing subreddit! 

TL;DR - Had an accident last September, left me paraplegic from the waist down with chronic nerve pain and smoking trees frees me of the pain and makes my quality of life better.
