So, story time.

This particular event happened while I was just trying out the mage class in the early levels. I was somewhere around level 15 and leveling in Crushbone, which was an orc castle zone extremely popular for leveling (not only were there tons of mob spawns and a dozen viable mob camps but frequent drops that you could turn into an NPC for even more XP, money, and faction).

On this particular day I was having trouble finding a group, and thus was just wandering around killing time while waiting for a slot to open up. I went up onto trainer hill, which was a very tall hill outside the castle and I noticed that you could actually see into the window in the tower of the castle where the two most powerful enemies (mobs) spawned (Emperor Crush and Ambassador Dvinn).

Then I had an idea - I remembered that mages had a special spell type called bolt spells. Bolt spells were direct damage spells that had an extremely long range, but you needed direct line of sight to your target and the bolt had a travel time to it. I wondered if it would be possible to shoot a spell from trainer hill into the window where the boss mobs spawned...

After some trying I found that there was one very small ledge on the hill that allowed you direct line of sight to the boss mobs just close enough to lob a bolt spell at them. Bored and curious I threw the spell just to see what would happen - my expectation was that they'd rush out of the castle straight toward me and I'd just run to the zone, no big deal.

But Crushbone was infamous for one other thing - absolutely horrible mob pathing. As I waited on the hill watching the castle gate more and more time passed without anything seeming to happen. After some time I assumed that the bosses had been grabbed by some party inside the castle and killed, but soon I began to see shouts in the zone: ""Does anyone know why emperor crush is running circles around inside the castle?""

Now there was another odd thing about mob aggro AI that I wasn't fully aware of at the time. The aggro table of one mob could be overwritten if another more powerful mob of the same faction came by and was attacking a different target, meaning that usually all the smaller minions of a boss would follow the boss's target. In this case because I had the two most powerful mobs in the zone trying to attack me it meant that every other mob they passed would drop whatever they were doing and follow along the pathing of the damned toward me.

I began to see more and more confused people shouting in the zone asking why a gigantic train of mobs was running erratically around the castle, and before long I saw Emperor Crush and about a dozen orcs burst out of the castle door and proceed to start running laps around the outside of the castle.

After a lap or two I began to get somewhat worried as basically the entire zone erupted in confusion and shouts of ""massive train going... somewhere, everyone be careful!"". Knowing that I was number one on their list of PCs to rape I made my way to the zone entrance, which was in a zig-zag shape so you could only see about 30 feet of tunnel from right next to the zone line.

I sat there inches from the zone ready to book it in a hurry, but constantly watching the tunnel and the ever increasing confusion going on in zone chat. After probably about 5 minutes I finally saw Emperor Crush turn the corner followed by dozens of orcs (pretty much the entire zone) hot on his heals. Needless to say I zoned out in a hurry - but everyone else in the zone wasn't as prepared as I'd been.

Another odd thing about the aggro AI for mobs in Everquest was that once their primary target was gone (died, left the zone, etc.) they would actually wait in place for a few seconds before starting to run back to their spawn location. During this time if they came across another target they wanted to attack they would before leashing back.

This meant that as soon as I zoned out all of the mobs instantly became aggro to absolutely everyone nearby, and I had dragged every last mob in the zone to the only exit (which also happened to be the gathering place for the entire zone).

There were around 20 people who were sitting at the zone entrance shouting for a group and there had been about 50-60 people in the zone total. Once I finished loading into the adjacent zone I found that about 5 people had managed to zone out with me and I saw nobody else.

I decided to go see the damage, so I threw up invisibility on myself and zoned back over to a veritable sea of corpses at the zone entrance. There were only about a dozen people left alive in the zone, and most of them were shouting warnings about how the gigantic mob was now running back to their original spawns as a group killing everyone in their path.

Now had I been less of a dick in my younger years this is where the story would end, but my peers at the time were not so lucky.

As everyone was sorting out the confusion of what the hell happened I played the good Samaritan role, offering to run around the zone invisible dragging corpses back to the entrance for people so they could recover their gear. Since nobody had any way of knowing I was responsible for all the mayhem several people agreed and I collected all their corpses near the entrance - but about 30 feet away from it. Just close enough that they would all be thankful, but far enough so as to cause a delay if they needed to zone back out in a hurry.

Once the corpses were collected people were amassing just outside the zone waiting for it to be safe. I then climbed back up to trainer hill, threw another bolt at my good friend Emperor crush, ran to the zone, and told everyone that the zone entrance was clear.

I just sat at the zone entrance looking very innocent for about 5 minutes while dozens of people came in to start looting their own corpses, when suddenly the orc brute squad turned the corner. I quietly zoned out.

Following all that enough people created general reports that a GM appeared in the zone to try and sort out what was going on. Nobody suspected me as far as I could tell since there was such a long delay between me showing up at the entrance and the orc mob busting in, so I felt just evil enough to pull the stunt one more time. While the GM was busy rezzing everyone that had died I made another trek up to trainer hill.

Everyone felt rather safe now that the GM was there, but I don't think the GM was fully prepared for what was actually happening. He saw the group appear and started to engage them, but once the full force of dozens of orcs appeared he was unable to engage them fast enough to pull aggro off all the players before they all died.

When I zoned back into Crushbone after the horde dissipated I saw that 3 GMs had been brought in to assist, including the head GM for the server (this was before he and I were on a first name basis and I was on an alt anyway). The head GM proceeded to deathtouch the entire zone wiping it clean and announced to the zone that if they caught whoever was doing it again they would receive a permanent ban on their account.

I decided to quit while I was ahead. I have no idea if they ever figured out how it was being done.

Two friends and I were playing DayZ.  We were a short distance from one of the major cities, heading toward a few buildings looking for loot when we heard someone singing.  We dropped to the ground, and we were all trying to figure out where it was coming from.

Then we saw him.  A guy running along the road with 5 or 6 zombies chasing him.  He was just singing some happy song, the kind you might hear a bunch of drunk guys singing in a bar.

My friend Tim said ""let's shoot him!""  He was just itching for some action.  Me, being the more careful one, said we should just let him go by.  If we shoot him, we'll make noise and attract all those zombies.  Not to mention, killing him would be a mean thing to do.

Well, Tim decided to shoot him anyway.  One shot, and the guy went down, but he didn't die.  The zombies started swarming him, and he started yelling ""Who shot me?!  Why did you shoot me!?"".  I told Tim to hit the deck because the singing guy was still alive and shooting at the zombies, and I didn't want him or the zombies to see us.

We wait a minute or two and it gets quiet, so we carefully crawl up to where the guy went down.  There's no body.  Just some dead zombies.  Just then a stray zombie sees me and attacks.  I got unlucky, and one hit broke my legs.  My friends killed the zombie, but we didn't have any meds to fix broken legs.

""Damnit, Tim.  I told you we should have just let him go by.""  After laughing at me for a minute, my two friends decide to head back to the military camp at the major city to find some meds, while I just tried to crawl under a tree and remain hidden.

We're chatting as they make their way to the camp.  Tim says, ""alright, I'm at the camp.""  Then a moment later ""Oh fuck there's a guy in here.""  ""Friendly!"" I heard him call out.  ""Oh fuck he shot me!""  ""Friendly!""

At this point I'm freaking out, because my friend is going to die, and I'm going to be stuck here with broken legs.

""Friendly!  Don't shoot!""
""Don't you fucking die, Tim!""

Then, I hear Tim start talking to the guy, I can only hear one side of the conversation, of course.  ""My friend has broken legs, we're just trying to get some meds for him."" ... ""Oh, really?"" ... ""That's fucked up.""

Then Tim starts cracking up.  ""Holy shit guys, it's him!  It's the singing guy.  He just told me about how some asshole shot him, then how he killed 5 or 6 zombies with his pistol, and crawled the entire way here to get some meds.""",Video,False,self,t5_2wqgc,False,video,,True,t3_1b1hhe,http://www.reddit.com/r/gametales/comments/1b1hhe/the_singing_guy_dayz/,

1366644897.0,126,self.gametales,1cv97v,Just because it's a boss doesn't mean it has to be difficult [D&amp;D],135,9,6,http://www.reddit.com/r/gametales/comments/1cv97v/just_because_its_a_boss_doesnt_mean_it_has_to_be/,"I'm currently playing a 4th edition campaign with a group of friends. We have just succeeded in capturing an orc fortress; our allies lured the main horde out into the field while we snuck in via boat and killed the skeleton garrison. To complete the campaign, we needed to go out and attack the remaining orcs from the rear. 

It is clear that this is going to be the Big Final Battle, and there is a good chance not all of us are going to make it back alive (the DM made this clear, that this would probably be the toughest fight we had faced so far). 

Thanks to our foresight, we had a speaking stone prepared and learned from the allied commander that the enemy had a war troll with them; war trolls are a *colossal* pain in the ass, because they are more or less unkillable unless you use fire or acid. Our party was mostly divine, marshal, and primal, meaning we hardly had any fire or acid abilities.

We did have one advantage; in the previous battle in the fortress, the DM had put two barrels full of gunpowder in the room, the idea being that we shoot them and blow up the orcs. We forgot about them at first, however, and never detonated them. 

As we are preparing to go and face our doom, the Warden in the party turns to the DM: ""Hey, how heavy are the barrels? Could I carry one?""

The DM allows it, conditional on her making an athletics and endurance check, both of which the warden succeeded. We begin to hatch our plan.

Fast forward ten minutes, and we arrive at the battle (which has temporarily subsided as both sides retrieve their wounded and lick their wounds). We are wearing full orc disguises, and no one is talking, since only the Warden speaks the orcish tongue (and her bluff skill was in the toilet). The warden marches right up to the war troll (which was a full 5 levels above us, by the way), drops the barrel, and says in giant ""Throw!""

The warden (miraculously) rolls a 16 on the bluff. Sadly, this isn't enough to fool the orc commander, or the orc shaman, or even the regular orcs.

It was enough to fool the troll. It picked up the barrel and got ready to throw.

Understand, the plan WAS to have the warden hand the troll the barrel then run back, at which point our rogue would shoot it with a flaming arrow. The warden, however, realizing that the bluff had failed against the orc commander, immediately triggers stone's endurance (which gives her a massive damage resist bonus), ignites her warhammer, and *hits the explosive barrel that is currently in the troll's hand, right next to her.*

The resulting explosion killed most of the orcs in the area, dropped the troll to almost dead, and lit it and the ground on fire. The best part was that, thanks to her high defenses and damage resist, the Warden took almost no damage (though she was blown back and stunned). 

The fight from there was easy as can be; the troll quickly succumbed to the fire (which prevents it from regenerating). With the soldier's help, we mopped up the remaining orcs and claimed the tower as our own.

I spoke to the DM after the session was done, and he admitted that he really didn't think we would be able to win the fight; he was hoping we would be forced to retreat, find reinforcements, that sort of thing. However, he acknowledged that we managed to out-think his plan, which deserved rewarding.",Tabletop,False,self,t5_2wqgc,False,table,author,True,t3_1cv97v,http://www.reddit.com/r/gametales/comments/1cv97v/just_because_its_a_boss_doesnt_mean_it_has_to_be/,
1367989402.0,123,self.gametales,1dwy4d,[D&amp;D 3.5] New gamer's out of the box thinking,138,15,14,http://www.reddit.com/r/gametales/comments/1dwy4d/dd_35_new_gamers_out_of_the_box_thinking/,"Alright, I'm the DM for a campaign. Actually for 2 groups acting in the same world, same campaign, and slightly different motivations. One group is ""good"" and the other is ""evil"". This is a story about the good group.

The good group has 3 players for the session in question. A rogue who recently came back from the dead, a Knight with some psionic abilities, and a druid, who is brand new to gaming. This was her second session.

The previous session was an RP session that set up the ""good"" group's goals, and ended with a disturbance outside in the town square. Now all old characters in my games become the property of the DM if they are abandoned or die. I do this because characters don't simply disappear when they're dead or abandoned. And occasionally I will use them.

At the start of the session, the players run out, and they see Sergo, the half-ogre barbarian who used to be played by an old player in the group approximately a year ago in game time. Now Sergo was dumb, like really dumb. He had a tendency to get a pet and name it ""kitty"" whether it was a goblin, or a goat. He had an affinity for goats. The other thing about Sergo is, he's really strong, like I should have gone over the character with a finetooth comb at character creation. But if the players can play with him, so can I.

So there's Sergo, tearing up the town square. The rogue and the Knight used to adventure with Sergo, and they want to talk him down, calm him, and get him to stop taking the place apart. So the first thing they do is try to talk to him. That just makes him angrier. They roll spot checks, and initiative. Sergo screams about ""kitty"" dying or being taken from him, it's all rather incoherent. The Knight and the Rogue pass their spot checks enough to see the town guards down, but not dead. The Druid sees that there is a goat that is in a bloody pile near Sergo's feet.

Combat begins. The Rogue tries to sneak attack, gets a little bit of damage done, but not much. The Knight first tries to bull rush Sergo, and gets an attack of opportunity against him as Sergo swings his huge ball and chain (medium creature + Powerful Build + Monkey Grip). He gets thwapped, but continues his charge. Opposing strength rolls. 
The Knight rolls poorly and Sergo can't lose. So the Knight winds up on his ass.

I have a special house rule for my games. Because we all want to have a good time and it is a fantasy game, and the rules don't always work the way that would be cinematic-ally appropriate, I added a once a day ability for all characters (and mobs/monsters/NPCs) called ""This Is A Fantasy Game"" TIAFG.

The Druid was last in the order, and she uses her TIAFG to combine Swarm and Summon Nature's Ally. Her intent, summon a swarm of Goats. I allowed it. I ruled it that it summoned goats from the surrounding countryside, rather than magic goats that will go away quickly.

The Knight and the Rogue continue to try to subdue Sergo by choking him out, or beating on him. It's not going well.

The next round, the Druid asks me if there are two goat Kids in the swarm of goats around her. There are. She picks two of them up, and presents them to the half-ogre. Sergo sees the goats, succeeds/fails his will save (however you want to look at it) and falls out of his rage, and rushes the druid to give her a great big hug. And then falls down to his back among the goats that are starting to migrate around the town square, crying and laughing, and generally not destroying things.

Combat over, good guys don't die, all because the druid didn't think inside the box and just try to knock out the half ogre. I gave them full experience for the encounter.",Tabletop,False,self,t5_2wqgc,False,table,,True,t3_1dwy4d,http://www.reddit.com/r/gametales/comments/1dwy4d/dd_35_new_gamers_out_of_the_box_thinking/,

1374683865.0,118,self.gametales,1iyqqc,[Pathfinder] What are you doing with that grappling hook? - Don't worry about it.,137,19,12,http://www.reddit.com/r/gametales/comments/1iyqqc/pathfinder_what_are_you_doing_with_that_grappling/,"I was playing with a bunch of friends in college. We had a bad habit of coming up with really stupid plans and not telling our DM about it, usually with the phrase ""Don't worry about it"" being said repeatedly when he asked. 

The best instance of this was a gladiator fight scenario, where the party was stripped of all armor, but were allowed to choose from a small variety of weapons and other objects. We had two guys playing human rangers who were brothers, one of which decides to get a trident, the other who picks up a grappling hook and rope. 

Ranger 1: ""I pick up the trident.""

DM: ""But you aren't proficient with the trident...""

Ranger 1: ""Don't worry about it. I'm basically Poisidon.""

DM:"".... Ranger 2, what are you grabbing?""

Ranger 2: ""Bob, I'm going to go with Grappling Hook!""

DM: ""...Really? Thats not even a weapon...wait, what are you planning?""

Ranger 2: ""Don't worry about it.""

The DM just looks at him for a minute,  shakes his head, and tells the rest of us to pick up something. I couldn't really use any of the weapons (can't remember what class I was playing) so I was just going to hand to hand like a boss for some sweet non-lethal damage.

We get out into the arena which has several raised platforms and several spiked pits around the rocky floor. We see that our enemies are a small group of orcs. Fighting quickly ensues. 

Both of our rangers had the orcs as favored enemies, and both had +4 mods on their STR. All of the orcs were better armed than us, but they had much better weapons. 

Highlights from that fight:

- Ranger 1 started the fight by throwing the trident, crit hit, and insta killed one orc.

DM: ""The orcs spread out before you in the semblence of a military formation. One in front begins banging his shield and sword together, taunting you, and bares his wicked teeth. He sta-""

Ranger 1: ""I throw my trident at that one.""

Rolls a nat 20, confirms. Damage outright kills the orc.

DM: ""....You throw YOUR ONLY WEAPON, and it skewers the orc, killing it instantly. Roll for initiative.""

Ranger 1: ""Awesome."" High-fives Ranger 2.

- Ranger 2 kicked one orc into the spike pit, got grappled by another, won the grapple check and RODE him down into the spike pit on top of the other one.

Ranger 2: ""I kick that guy next to the spike pit. I want him to go into the spike pit. What do I have to roll for that?""

DM: ""Well, lets say roll to hit, then we'll do a combat manuever check, and we'll see how well you do.""

Dice roll, Ranger 2 connects, rolls a decent manuever check, Orc rolls a 2.

DM: ""....You kick him into the pit. He falls for 15 feet and then is impaled on the spikes below. The orc beside him attempts to grapple you.""

Grapple is successful.

Next Round.

Ranger 2: ""I jump into the spike pit!""

DM: ""...You can't, you're grappled.""

Ranger 2: ""I pull him with me.""

DM: ""He....he releases the grapple as you try to jump away?""

Ranger 2: ""OH hell no, I want to maintain the grapple.""

DM: ""...ok, roll for it then.""

Ranger 2 beats the grapple check, then rolls a manuever to yank the orc into the pit with him. Wins. 

DM: ""Wow, really? Ok, you successfully haul him into the pit with you. Enjoy the spikes.""

Ranger 2: ""How tall are the spikes?""

DM: ""Why? Does it matter? They're probably 2.5-3 feet high? People aren't really that thick.""

Ranger 2: ""I roll the orc under me as we're falling. He lands in the same square as the other guy. Do the spikes hit me through both of them?""

DM: ""...I hate you right now.""

- Said Ranger 2 then used the grapple hook from the spike pit with an insanely lucky dice roll to hook another orc and yank him backwards into the pit.

Ranger 2: ""Can I hear people next to the ledge of the pit?""

DM: ""You catch glimpse of orcs' heads, but they are beyond your sight. You assume they are within 10-15 feet of the pit.""

Ranger 2: ""I want to throw my hook and go Orc fishing.""

DM: ""Well you can't see anyone, so you're going to have to roll a random square to hit, percentage to hit the orc if there is one in there, attack to beat his ac, and percentage to see if the hook sets.""

Ranger 2: ""I got this.""

Proceeds to make the most incredible series of rolls we've ever seen. Rolls the correct square for an orc, 95% to hit the orc, 18 on a d20 to actually hit the orc, 99% to set the hook.

DM: ""I can't believe you actually did that. I..I guess make a STR check to see if you can yank him into the pit?""

Ranger 2 rolls a 18, DM rolls a 7.

DM: ""He...the orc screams as he's yanked off his feet and careens into the spike pit. He sails over the growing pile of dead orcs, and is impaled behind you....what are you doing next?""

Ranger 2: ""Don't worry about it.""

- My char is running around crazy, using his loin cloth as a nasty improvised sling, and the rocks on the ground as ammo.

Me: ""What kind of penalty would I get for improvising a simple weapon?""

DM: ""Probably not too bad depending. What are you thinking?""

Me: ""I untie my loin cloth and pick up a rock off the ground. I try to use it as a sling.""

DM: ""....That's gross. And clever. Roll your attack.""

By the end of the fight, we had taken almost no damage, killed all of the orcs in glorious random combat, and adopted the name of House Orcbane for our group. The motto being ""Don't worry about it."" The emblem was a trident and a grappling hook.

This was my favourite session, but only slightly ahead of fighting goblin ""knights"" mounted on camels.  ",Tabletop,False,self,t5_2wqgc,1374764757.0,table,,True,t3_1iyqqc,http://www.reddit.com/r/gametales/comments/1iyqqc/pathfinder_what_are_you_doing_with_that_grappling/,

My character is being introduced in medias res to their campaign. We are playing Blood of Heroes (a superhero game) modified to work with a Star Wars setting. 

I’m waiting for a good time to introduce my character to the others while a scene plays out. Two characters, a Dark Jedi (Tom) and a smuggler (Shawn), are secretly meeting with the head of Black Sun, a galaxy wide criminal organization. 

In Blood of Heroes, you can get extra points during character creation for taking disadvantages. One of these disadvantages is called Rage.
 
Shawn’s character tries to make an influence roll to get a better price on some previously negotiated deal with this If-you-cross-me-I’ll-have-you-killed mob boss. on 2d10 Shawn rolls a 2. Now the way that Rage is described is that if you ever roll a 2, 3, or 4, you go berserk and attack your closest target, friend or foe, with intent to kill. The Smuggler flies into a rage and starts shooting at the mobster. Luckily his attack rolls are just as poor as his influence and he misses every time. 

Tom gets a turn and uses his Jedi’s telekinesis to pick up Shawn’s character and turn him against the wall facing away from the mobster, hopefully starting to salvage the situation. The GM says that since Shawn can’t see any more targets that his Rage has ended. 

Shawn disagrees and announces his character will fire blindly backwards over his shoulder and keep trying. The GM relents, assigns extra difficulty to the roll, and points out that he would need a roll of 20 or more to hit. In Blood of Heroes, if you roll doubles you get to roll again and add the result. Shawn proceeds to roll doubles 3 times in a row to get a 54. The mobster is killed instantly. 

This puts the entire party in jeopardy because we will be marked for death by every criminal and bounty hunter in the galaxy. The rest of the group starts talking about how best to kill Shawn and turn in his corpse, for what will probably be a huge bounty, while not getting killed ourselves. 

The GM not wanting to derail his own campaign tells Shawn that if he gives up all of his remaining luck points he will change the outcome so that the mobster was only severely wounded and not dead. Shawn gives them up, but we still have to deal with a mob boss severely wounded by one of our group. 

We ask around the table to see who has any healing abilities. Only one player does. Shawn.

Shawn attempts to give first aid to the mobster. He rolls a 3. Shawn chokes the wounded man to death with a tourniquet. The entire party facepalms.

**TLDR: Be careful taking rage/berserk disadvantages because it caused a player to kill the same guy twice, both times dooming the party.**",Tabletop,False,self,t5_2wqgc,False,table,,True,t3_1d0z55,http://www.reddit.com/r/gametales/comments/1d0z55/unnecessary_rageness/,

I was neutral-good and super awesome. The kind of guy who has no qualms with getting into the grit of it. There were five of us in total. A halfling rogue, a human fighter, a dragonborn ranger, an elf wizard and myself. I served as the group's healer. I wore a full suit of armor and carried a tower shield and a double sided ax.

We set out from town on a mission to discover what has been causing the local livestock to vanish. The quest takes us to a swamp where we find that snakes have exploded in population. We learn the snakes will disappear if we kill the giant snake that attacks the town every now and again. (There is more to the story, but this is the part that matters.)

The town was located along a lake. With the land forming a small, shallow, swampy bay with buildings dotted along the shore. Just as we got there the snake came rolling into the bay. It was about 5 feet wide and tall, but 75 feet long. At the same time, lots of smaller snakes appeared and attacked us as well. We separated and started picking off the smaller ones. We were all able to handle ourselves against them.

The more time we wasted on the small stuff, the closer that big snake got. The snakes were tricky for me because they were all water snakes so they were able to swim. This was bad because the only weapon I had was my ax and even though the water only around 5 feet deep, I was 4'2"" and my swim stat was -34. Water and I did not get along. We were lucky enough to get rid of the small stuff just in time for the big guy to start becoming a threat. Unfortunately, we were all scattered. Also unfortunately, I was the first one on it's path. It took us a while to work out some plan. The plan we settled on was named Everyone-Deal-As-Much-Damage-To-This-Goddamned-Snake-As-You-Can-Before-We-All-Die.

Being my first campaign, I'm wasn't sure how to gauge the situation. I hid behind my tower shield as the monstrous head approached me. It tried to bite me with it's enormous fangs without slowing down. My shield and armor were strong enough I didn't get hurt. As it passed by me I swung my ax as hard as I can over my head.

I barely scratched it. Don't get me wrong, it was a swing strong enough to kill any man, but this snake was so large I barely scuffed it. And so it went, for turns around the table, us fighting to deal as much damage to this thing as we can and it spinning around in circles trying to kill us. We were at this for about three hours. This creature had an unbelievable amount of health.

We were all beginning to run out of stamina, both in game and around the table. At this point I was on the other side of the bay with the snake out of reach in the water and we were running out of options. Our DM said that the snake is now making a run for it out the bay and if he escapes we fail our quest. In a last ditch effort, Jeff, our human warrior makes a leap of faith off a dock and tried to land on the snake. He failed his roll and was eaten immediately. It was lucky though that the snake was large enough that he was swallowed whole.

Jeff was losing health fast enough that we was likely going to die in the snake. He really liked his character so he was pretty bummed. In a last effort I used my daily feat of strength to tear a 4""x4"" out of a building beside me and hurl it at the snake like a javelin. I succeed my rolls and the wood found it's mark. It just stuck out of the thing's side as it slithered along. My teammates efforts to kill this thing were equally useless.

It slid along past us and we were powerless to stop it. The snake passed by me on it's way out of the bay and it dealt more damage to the freshly swallowed Jeff. One more turn and he would be dead. This was a terrible way to end. Fight this thing for hours only to have the quest be a failure and have one of us die?

I started reading over my character sheet and spell sheet, frustrated that there was nothing I could do. I turn to my friend Hunter and ask him to take a look and see if I had any options to me. I couldn't see any. He took my sheets and said to me ""You could cast enlarge person on yourself so that you're taller and won't drown in the water. That way you can attack the snake again.""

I paused for a second, my mind whizzing.
""Can- Can I cast enlarge person on Jeff?"" I asked. I gestured to the small figure Jeff picked for himself on the table, located in the snake right behind it's head.

My DM and Hunter looked at each other, then back to me.

""Yeah,"" said my DM.

After passing both rolls I needed for the spell to be a success, Jeff grew in size until he was ten feet tall. He burst out of the snake at it's neck causing it's head to fall off, killing it instantly.

We sat in silence for a moment to let what just happen sink in.

I gathered my character sheet, stood up from the table and said ""I'm going to bed.""

It's a bit long, but worth the read.**

Back in the early 1980s, I learned a valuable lesson about not having recently-split couples engage in any form social activity. I have to use fake names because I think one of the involved parties reads TR. Sean and Tracy broke up two days before our weekly D&amp;D game (second edition). They both agreed to participate and behave themselves for the sake of the game and the other players. 

One of them was lying. 

The game picked up where we had last played. An elf with a unicorn (Tracy) was being escorted by a human paladin (Scott), a halfling (Sean), and a half-troll (Larry). The current situation was that the elf woman was being hunted for the magic pearls she carried (yes, Tracy was the star as the only female playing). The group decided to stop in a town to gather supplies and information. The half-troll had to be watched carefully since he liked to eat children and had a long, nasty history of that. Tracy tried to explain what she expected of the troll. 

It was at this point the first crack in the game. Sean, in character, asked if it was necessary that Tracy's character coddle everyone and place unrealistic behavioral expectations on people. Apparently, this was too close to a personal issue between them. Tracy responded that even the most dense creature could understand common civility and that it wasn't an unrealistic expectation. Sean took the jab, but he was mad. The group got their supplies and information, and got out of town. 

While advancing through the forest, staying off the roads after having learned they were indeed being followed, the argument about coddling erupted again when Tracy asked Larry (the half-troll) to stop knocking over trees. Sean asked Tracy to mind her own business and leave the troll alone. This began the all-out verbal fight. Sean could not leave well enough alone. In character, he took a swing at Tracy's character, got initiative, hit a natural 20, applied the modifier, and knocked out Tracy's character. 

This part is not safe for children..... Sean then proceeded to rape Tracy's unicorn. Any time she, Tracy, showed any sign of coming around, he would knock her out again and returned to abusing the unicorn. He did this repeatedly until he asked, and I will never forget this ""[I]s the damn thing dead? Did I fuck it to death?"" I, as the GM, had to make the various rolls to determine the state of the unicorn. It was not death, although severely wounded both bodily and in spirit. Sean then right back to raping the unicorn and asked to a health/spirit check about every five minutes. 

Tracy sat there seething and unable to respond in kind. After about a half an hour of this, the unicorn finally died in spirit, and then physically died. At this point, Sean had his character stand over the foully abused animal corpse and shouted ""Fuck you!"", and then cut off it's head. Tracy stood up, said ""Fuck you!"" and departed the house. The game ended... as well as that campaign. Sean glared at the table and simply said ""I hate fucking unicorns."" I don't think he understood the double entendre of his statement given that he was angry with his ex-girlfriend. The rest of us started to laugh. He got mad at our laughter and then left the house as well. Worst ending of any campaign I ever played or GMed.

The only thing that remains in memory from back then is when I (and only I) got to draw from a magical card deck. After I had drawn the card I was told by the GM to throw a d4 and I got a 3. That is how I was granted three wishes. 

Now, I was very new to D&amp;D at the time (this was probably my 4th session) so I wasn't all for building up my character, rather I saw it as an opportunity to lighten the load for the group as a whole, both in regards to weight and financially. 

My first wish is for a packmule. 

A cloud of dust appears in front of me and from it steps strong, healthy mule. 

My second wish is for another packmule. 

A cloud starts to form, but before the mule appears I shout out that I wish the second mule to shit gold. 

The GM then told me that the second mule died of intestinal problams and after I had dissected it to try and retrieve what gold it might have inside of it he explained that it had a ""magical golden rectum"", so the gold would only appear when the mule would defecate. So there my charecter was, on his knees, with his hands covered in mule shit. 

The first mule died about 30 minutes later, killed by a demon or something. 

I never liked the DM after that. ",Tabletop,False,self,t5_2wqgc,False,table,,True,t3_1dr8mm,http://www.reddit.com/r/gametales/comments/1dr8mm/dd_the_three_wasted_wishes/,

The adventure started in a pretty straightforward way: evil overlord is forming an empire and gradually conquering neighboring kingdoms, until his eyes fall upon a tiny farming community that happens to have a group of heroes in their employ. This was meant to be the capstone of a campaign in which the heroes have been helping these poor farmers for a number of years, and now are being called upon one last time to help them escape from the machinations of the evil overlord. 

Our heroes fare well for a time, killing the commanders that the overlord sends against them, and scattering the forces he musters; but it soon became clear that they tide was turning against them, and they would soon be overwhelmed. One of the players had acquired an ancient map to a forgotten island several adventures ago and only now pulled it out (to the GM's chagrin), deciding that the best way to save these farmers is to build a fleet and sail to the island. The other players agreed and they set the villagers to work building some small ships while they spent huge sums of gold buying all the supplies they could possibly need on the island and a couple defensive ships to go with it.

After a few weeks in which the enemy forces have been slowly making ground toward the village, despite the best efforts of the heroes and the local militia, the fleet sets sail to the forgotten island. The journey takes place mostly without incident, with a couple storms hitting them, and unfortunately the loss of one of the refugee boats. 

Arriving at the island, the begin to set up camp and cut down the bands of feral lizardmen they run into. In the course of the lizardmen genocide, what should they come across except none other than the Fountain of Youth centered in a city of gold. The party is alone in this discovery, but being reasonable people, they decide to inform the refugees and take the city as the new capital of their island kingdom. Thus begins a new era of prosperity.

Until the evil overlord's fleet arrives. 

As it turns out, the overlord was enraged at the loss of the potential pool of slave labor and sent his huge fleet of dreadnoughts in pursuit of the rag-tag flotilla, and to make the situation even more dire he sent an airship fortress to be his flagship. He also had the courtesy to offer 48 hours to surrender before he bombarded them into dust. 

Faced with this dilemma, the group realizes that among the supplies they brought with them are the perfect materials to build several gyrocopters. They tell the refugees that they will build these gyrocopters and take down the airship fortress, cutting the head off the snake as it were. 

Secretly, each player has another plan. One by one they decide to just fly away and leave the islanders to their fate. They begin sneaking off in the night, the entire party thinking that they were the only player to think of this, and bottling the water from the fountain and stealing gold bricks from the less inhabited parts of the city. In the day they build their gyrocopters.

Before they know it, the 48 hours have passed and their gyrocopters stand assembled, laden with chests and barrels which the party tells the refugees are filled with explosives and other things necessary to take down the airship.

They take off, and quickly realize that none of them are flying toward the airship fortress. It dawns on them that they are all greedy bastards, and now are only concerned with who among them will be the wealthiest and longest-lived. They proceed to fight one another mid-air until they all end up as heaps of scrap and twisted flesh, which are quickly wiped away in the fleet's barrage. 

And so the fountain of youth was lost forever, and the only hope the world had to save them from the most evil ruler yet known died while fighting over gold bricks.

The merchant went apeshit and started attacking me, so I fled. I ran and swam for at least ten minutes over all manner of terrain. At some point I decided to stop and plot my next destination on a small landmass sticking out of the water. 

Not long after I stopped moving, I noticed something in the water. Moments later the merchant arose from the depths like T1000 and continued beating the shit out of me. He ran and swam like an olympian for several miles to kick the shit out of me for stealing a spoon worth nothing.

My team and I were partway through a pretty successful night of queuing -- some losses, but mostly wins -- and were starting to face teams at a skill bracket we'd at that point not been able to reach before.  My team, a Warrior, Warlock, Mage, Restoration Shaman, and Holy Paladin were teleported in to the arena once the queue popped.  I, the Warlock, went though my typically tedious pre-game preperation while the rest of my team presumably cooked dinner or split the atom, I never really had enough pre-game free time to find out what exactly regular people chose to do during it.  Gates open and we're off.  Mirror composition, great. 
 
They focus the resto Shaman with  hard switches on to me.   They strike first blood, bringing down the Shaman, but our Paladin is boss enough to heal us through all the damage by himself, allowing us to score a counter kill on their mage.  With less damage now the Paladin is able to keep us up without having a heart attack now, and we land a cheeky kill on an out-of-position Warrior.  With only 1 DPS now, their chances are looking slim.  We relax, we underestimate them, and they miraculously off our out-of-mana Paladin.  Crap.
 
Both their healers were too focused on controlling us to kill our healer to keep track of their health bars, and we bring down the both of them.  So now we have a Warrior with a third of his health bar, a Mage with even less, and a Warlock with full health against another Warlock with full health.  Easy.
 
Nope.
 
Let me explain to you the prowess of Burning Crusade SL/SL Warlocks.  During the Burning Crusade expansions ""Soul Link"" Warlocks had the ability to be a tank, DPS, and healer all in one.  They could spread ""dots"" (damage over time spells) across the entire enemy team and while simultaneously healing themselves, and reducing incoming damage to near-negligible amounts.  You could not beat an SL/SL lock 1v1.  He certainly wouldn't be able to kill you quickly, but you wouldn't be able to kill him at all.  Apparantly we could not beat an Sl/Sl lock 3v1.
 
Our Warrior and Mage fall.  It's me and him.  Unstoppable Force vs. Unmovable Object.  We act like we're trying to win for what seems like an eternity, but at the bottom of our hearts both of us know this game is going to go on forever.  We both know there can't be a winner. 
 
The Warrior makes an alternate character on the oposing Warlock's realm and asks him and his team to come on to our ventrillo server.  They oblige.  At this point everyone just wants the game to end, but no one wants to lose.  It's taking too much time out of our second lives, it's got to end now.  ""Hey, you familiar with checkers?"" the other Warlock asks.  ""Yea, why?"" I respond.  ""I have an idea"".
 
We both load up a browser based checkers game.  The winner of our 5v5 game is to be decided by the victor of a game of online checkers.  What followed was a harrowing, nail-biting 15 minute checkers match.  Checkers were kinged, killed, and crossed over.  In the end he left victorious.  I /bowed, and exited the game.

1370781532.0,84,self.gametales,1fz8q0,[Minecraft] The creeper to end all creepers,96,12,2,http://www.reddit.com/r/gametales/comments/1fz8q0/minecraft_the_creeper_to_end_all_creepers/,"My first time posting on here, I love this subreddit and am happy to finally contribute. I hope this story is up to standards.

Okay, so this is a story about the first time myself and a friend played together on creative mode.

A little background - There were four of us on the server and one or two that popped in from time to time. This was our first server that we ran ourselves, we had started a few months prior on survival mode and done the usual, built our own houses, a nice little farm set up and a fairly big castle, all on a little horseshoe bay.

Now, friend A went off to build in creative mode - he worked on Kami's lookout from DBZ which turned out great.

After a while I decided I wanted a big project too, having little else to do. Friend A (who owned the server) gave me creative mode on the one condition that I do not somehow break the server. So I decide to build a creeper. Not just any creeper, but one from sea level to top of the world. And then fill it with tnt. I can't remember the exact number but it was in the range of 136000 blocks of TNT in this thing. And I built it on a platform in the middle of the bay we had set up in. 

About halfway through, friends A and B discover what I'm doing and with a lot of laughing decide to join me.

We get close to finishing filling it, about 3/4 of the way, before friend A has to head off.

Me and friend B then start to hatch a plan. Since the server would be backed up before detonation, we would pack TNT throughout the town we had built, including a hollowed out area under the huge, complex greenhouse friend A had painstakingly built in survival. Now, about an hour in to this, something happens. TNT is placed next to an on lever. Things are bad. There is shouting, lag is crippling the frame rate.

Against all odds we manage to cover the main impact areas of the creeper in water before they can start a server killing chain of events. 

After some time, the server regains it's composure, and we survey the devastation. The castle survived mostly unscathed, but everything else was a crater. We are lost for words, nothing but breathing is coming through our headsets. The mutual feeling of 'we-done-fucked-up' is palpable. 

So, without a word, we get rebuilding, everything exactly how it was from memory, and damnit if after 3 hours of fiddly work it looked perfect. The worst part was the greenhouse, that had to be perfect or friend A would notice, it was a bit of a trophy project for him, plus placing glass panes on glass pains is a bitch. 

So with the lever destroyed, we figure it's safe to resume our plans. We get back to planting the TNT throughout the rebuilt town. Even more this time, to make it worth the effort, we're doing a last sweep of filling in gaps and checking it was all hidden when the unthinkable happened. Out of the corner of my eye I see a TNT flashing. I shout 'no!', and start flying for the line of TNT that connected this section to the rest, but it was too late. Friend B tried too, when he heard my shout, but he too was unsuccessful, the lag got us both. We logged out and waited, it was 3am at this point, we had no time to rebuild again. We could only hope the creeper survived.

After some time we managed to log back in. As the world slowly rendered around us there was only devastation. No trace of the town that once that once stood here was left. No hint of what the bay had looked like either, the explosion had torn the area apart. The castle in particular was in a bad state, several floating blocks and a crater the size of a large lake was all that remained. Despite all this, the creeper thankfully survived.

Knowing we could do nothing, I got a single sign, placed it on a floating block and put the word 'Shiiiiiiiit' for friend A to see.
The next day, I logged in in the afternoon and saw him online. I flew over to him, by the sign, looking down at the crater where Vagina Town once stood. His head turned towards mine, stared for a while and then the incoming skype call popped up. 

All I got was 'fuck sake' before creative mode was removed and I fell to my death.

I apologised profusely. Friend B was absent for a couple days after that, whilst we made a lake in the crater. It turned out pretty nice, you couldn't tell it wasn't there all along.

But that's not the end of it. The creeper still stood. Waiting.

We finished work on it that week, and prepared a small temple with 4 switches to be hit to begin detonation.

As we prepared to record the explosion, Friend A was flying around the creeper making final checks. He saw a creeper that had spawned atop the foot of the creeper, I see from the temple as he punches it. I watch as the creeper detonates, triggering the behemoth we had created. I watched as the others went offline one by one, kicked by the lag. I watched the creeper melt frame by frame into glowing blocks of death. I watched the server die.

We never got that server running again. Whatever happened to it meant that world became unplayable. We took it as a badge of honour, and I was banned from creative mode on any server I didn't run myself.

We had found another group of friends and quickly formed an alliance, we built a small base out of anything we could find, stone, wood, dirt, all had to be gathered quickly as a much larger group held a majority share of the servers resources, hilariously outnumbered, we decided it was best to stay low, travel in groups and only in the night, as the larger group did anything it could for survival, including avoiding monster confrontation. 

To make the game more interesting, an moderator had built a large base on a mountain which was soon dubbed ""Albatross"", however, the downside to this was that when he couldn't look out for the base, it was anyone's game.

Soon, the moderator had fallen to the enemy during an attempt to assault the larger group's base, it would of been us too, had we not escaped, but we did not run back to our base, as the only way back to the base was through the enemies line of sight, weighing our options, we decided that the base must remain hidden, and Albatross was our best option.

The base on Albatross was beautifully designed, the inside was lined with paintings, it also held a throne for the late moderator, and several tall glass windows, it resembled a Cathedral. 

We took refuge in it's basement, the larger group knew where we were, and sent a scout, whom took a wrong turned and ended up in the basement with us, in which we preceded to kill him, the only thing they had sent him with was food, which was very valuable.

Since their scout did not come back, soon the whole group began their trip to the mountain, we had to prepare ourselves, we knew it was only a matter of time, in the darkness of the basement, there was a chest, in the chest was stacks and stacks of TNT, one thing lead to another and we soon found ourselves taunting the enemies, little did they know we had lined the path with TNT.

We saw them in the distance, one got too cocky and preceded to be blown up, this stopped the group in its tracks, and caused them to charge, bang, bang, bang, the TNT had taken out a majority of their group leaving them with only a shadow of what they originally had (I believe it was 20 to our 10) armed with nothing but our hopes, we charged at the enemy, the ones who didn't die were damaged, and were easily thrown off the mountain top, however, we didn't have the weaponry they did, and we lost several members, in the end, 4 of us remained.

We celebrated in Albatross that night, and made several graves for our fallen allies, we left Albatross however, as it was too much for us to control, we returned to our little base, only this time, armed with the weapons of our fallen enemies.

For those of you unfamiliar, a Dread Necromancer is class from Heroes of Horror based around, you guessed it, summoning boat loads of undead, channeling negative energy, and generally being an unpleasant sort of fellow. Their spell list is limited to the Necromancy school, along with getting extra spells from HoH, and things like inflict wounds. 

   One of my friends is a power gamer. No bones about it. He wants that 18 base strength with a +5 Vorpal Greataxe, and he wants it now. He's in it for the combat, and for the numbers. There's nothing too bad about this as long as the GM doesn't cater solely to his mentality, but that's not important right now. What IS important is that he HATED this character. He didn't roll the stats he wanted, he didn't like the class (Fighter, me thinks? I'm not sure now) he chose, and he couldn't ""get in character"", which for him was trying to figure of how GR1MD4RK his character was and what past atrocities he was atoning for. Also, he tends to play the characters with the messed up past, who've done terrible things and are FIGHTING THE MONSTERS WITHIN THEMSELVES along with the creatures in the campaign. *sigh*. I digress. 

   What I didn't know was that he arranged with the DM to die in the next adventure so he could reroll while we were finishing up and then meet us during DEUS EX MACHINA or something or other. So as a 4 man, level 3 party, we delve into Generic Dungeon A to find MacGuffin 1.0. We fight the typical skeletons, zombies, and get caught in your typical pitfalls, poison dart traps, and the occasional oddity, like spider webs without spiders. Eventually, (and this was explained to us in loving detail) we come to a room that is like a circular amphitheater. Tiered seating goes down several levels, where there is a gaping maw of a hole in the center of the room, probably used to appease some dark god or perform some sort of sacrilege. Being experienced players, we stay the hell away. Like, against the wall away. Except for PowerGamer, who decides he wants to take a look. As he's moving down, I roll spot to check around the room. There is a large door at the other end of the room. A thick door, wrought iron and black oak. Which summarily bursts open as an Ogrething (I don't remember what the creature was.) charges out, headed straight for PowerGamer. 

   I was later informed that PowerGamer was supposed to fight said Ogrething, saving one of the NPC's in our party by tackling into the aforementioned gaping maw. Loophole open and closed, roll new character, pass go and collect 175 GP. Except that because I was paying attention, I got a surprise round, grudgingly. The ogrething bearing down on PowerGamer rounds the hole, when my readied action takes effect. 

""I cast cause fear."" 

DM: ""Roll concentration""

I pass easily. The DM rolls Ogrethings will save (Yes, it had few enough HD to be effected by cause fear.). 1. The DM, face in palms, explains that the terror I induced was so powerful that it gave out a heart wrenching shriek of abject terror and loss, turns and makes for the door, fails a reflex save, and falls into the pit. 

""Dude."" 

   PowerGamer still wants to die, but not giving the game up yet, we trudge through GENERIC DUNGEON A, perilously close to MACGUFFIN 1.0. Eventually we get to said Macguffin, and PowerGamer reveals his intent. He tries to backstab the Cleric, fails, and it's combat time.

1371085609.0,82,self.gametales,1g8jkb,[XCOM] A Single Hero,92,10,4,http://www.reddit.com/r/gametales/comments/1g8jkb/xcom_a_single_hero/,"The aliens had invaded and the heroes resisted. If you had never played XCOM, well you should, but it is a game which focuses on squad tactics. I played this game on the Impossible difficulty with an Ironman perk. Basically, you are allowed a single save, which is overwritten each turn to prevent cheating. It is frustrating, annoying, and almost certainly will result in the death of your squad. 

Well after a long and brutal campaign, I finally was able to get to the final mission. My final squad involved 2 snipers, 2 assault, 1 heavy and a support. Because I was an idiot, I mis-equiped them, so only my support class warrior had medkits. This meant that my people could not really be healed reasonably, and only a single guy would actually revive people if someone died. I noticed this only when the mission launched and the previous save was over written. 

So, the game progresses, with the enemies throwing harder and harder aliens at your squad. They are slowly damaged, to the point where each has about 10 ticks of health left. That is until I meet the two giant robots which one shot my support character and one of the assaults. So if you remember, since my support is the only one who had medkits, he could not you know.. heal himself from bleeding out. 

At this point, my snipers come in. One is the volunteer – a person with his psionic score who is mission important. One has been my heavy hitter from the first mission. His name is Thomas Wood, and went by a nickname ‘Ice’. Now, if you never played Impossible, you might not know that it is notorious for ‘cheating’ with AI getting ridiculous hits, while your people could not hit … well the ground. Ice was not like a regular grunt on Impossible difficulty. He was my heavy hitter. He connected each shot. Every, single, one. Ice shot, and aliens died. 

So while doing humanities work for them, Ice single handedly takes out the first sectopod, and next turn the second one. Lastly we reached the ‘boss’ and his two helpers and a bodyguard. The two helpers immediately use mind control to take over my heavy and the last assaulter. 

Now at this point, everyone is extremely hurt. The snipers are down to 3 tabs a piece, and if they get shot even once, they will die. Since the hit percentages worked out that way, my snipers targeted down one of Ethereals who was controlling my men, and finally put him down. Heavy, with only a few bars of the health left does the only thing he can do, and shoots the rocket into the cluster of enemies. The rocket strays and hits  only two of them. I will confess, at this point I was depressed. My men were out of action points, the assault shotgunner is still mind controlled, and everyone is about to die. Not surprisingly, the shotgunner blows away his best friend, and my turn begins again. I kill the next ethereal, which frees my shotgunner to run up and put two shots into the Uber’s bodyguard. The assaulter promptly dies next turn to the Uber. 

So now it’s Ice, the volunteer, and a full health uber about to rain down terror on my heavily wounded heroes. The volunteer fires first, brings down the Uber’s health down a few bars, and then Ice prepares to fire. At that moment, for the first time in the game, Ice misses. He misses both of his shots. The Uber approaches my soldiers, and proceeds to put himself into overwatch. (Fires on anyone if they enter his line of sight)

The volunteer fires two shots into the Uber, hoping to kill him and end the mission, but it was not meant to be. The uber remained with 2 point of health left and in such position that I could not shoot him with Ice and his sniper rifle. (Out of ammo)

Now, Wood switched to his pistol, and I finally started cycling through Ice’s available skills to fire on the Uber. Instead, somehow the frag grenade skill activated, and Thomas Wood – ‘Ice’ – the man who survived every mission so far threw a frag grenade under his feet. 3 damage. That is all it took to end his own life, and the life of the Uber-Ethereal. 3 damage to end the war for humanities very survival. 
3 damage. I don’t know how I clicked frag grenade. It was what came into my inventory when medkits got replaced in the beginning of the mission. A single frag grenade that Thomas Wood brought with him to the final mission that had ended the war.

I sat there in silence. I beat the impossible difficulty on ironman, sure, but it did not feel right. All I could think about was a single hero who had saved the world.

After making it out there and walking in, we noticed it was empty on the first floor. Kind of odd for working hours, but whatever. We made our way to the 2nd floor where we encountered some workers who were very quick to tell us ""You can't be in here, go downstairs!""

So, we headed down, followed by a couple guys to talk to them and investigate the rumors. While talking, one of the two that followed us said ""Hang on, I'll go get our manager downstairs."" Being a rather naive and trusting group of adventurers, we didn't think much of it. Come to find out, we allowed the cultists to spread the alarm and ambush us, leading to 1 giant fight that was meant to be 3 fights + 1 ""boss"" fight.
After some valiant efforts, we fell, one by one, to the sheer number of cultists. It came down to the horde VS our cornered and injured half-orc Ranger. They brought him down to ~20 HP.

At this point, we knew it was a TPK. But we were resolved to play it through to the end. Not willing to give his enemies the satisfaction of the kill, he stared them down...

""Fuck you.""

He proceeded to Coup de Grace himself for max damage, with a crossbow bolt to the head, bringing him down to negative something HP. Seconds passed that felt like minutes.

""...""

Then he said:

""... and I guess, because of [Orc Ferocity](http://www.d20pfsrd.com/races/core-races/half-orc), I'm still standing... so... I'm gonna roll to intimidate.""

Naturally, our DM gave him a massive bonus to intimidate, considering he had just Tyler Durden'd himself in the face with a crossbow. He ended up with something like a 30 to intimidate, which of course worked. As he stared down the cultists, he freely walked out of the lumber mill, closing the door behind him.

If you've never played a Scribblenauts game, maybe my story will show you what you're missing out on.

I was taking a break from my homework, playing a few levels of Scribblenauts. Everything was going along pretty smoothly: a few laughs were had, some crazy stuff was going down, but nothing was too out of the ordinary. That changed when I was tasked with helping a boy break open his birthday pinata.

It was a simple enough task; give the boy a bat or some other suitable club-like object. In fact, it was so simple that I decided to spice things up a bit. I wasn't just going to give the birthday boy a bat. I decided to give him a *giant*, *flaming* bat. So, I typed the words into the notebook when disaster (and hilarity) struck.

Before I tell you what transpired, I need to explain one of Scribblenauts' game mechanics. See, it isn't all knowing. If you enter a homonym as something you'd like to spawn, it'll ask you to clarify. So, when I entered ""giant flaming bat"", I had to choose between 'Bat (Sports)' and 'Bat (Animal)'. I was dead set on giving this boy a giant, flaming baseball bat, but fate stood in the way. I mistakenly chose 'Bat (Animal)'. All hell broke lose.

Out of no where, a shrieking, winged bat appeared in the young boy's hand. The bat was huge! It was at least four times the size of any of the party guests. In addition, flames shot out of it in every direction. The birthday boy was not phased, though... He looked at the pinata with a steely determination that would make a war veteran turn and run. With great vigor, he launched a ferocious attack against the pinata, swinging the flaming, winged mammal with all his might. After a few blows, the pinata burst into flames, and soon after it exploded, raining candy all over the party. The bat disappeared in a puff of smoke, not having been able to withstand the savage beating it had just taken. The boy stood triumphantly in the center of the room as candy fell across the room and the other children cheered him on.

It seems that, the night before, my friend on the server decided it would be funny to play a prank on me. He had spent an hour redirecting my chute, causing me to fall into water which funneled me straight into a goddamn Nether gate.

Before I could react, I was hurled into the gate and quickly transported into the nether. I went back, but he had literally lined the entire zone around the gate with obsidian, and I couldn't swim back up.
Going back into the Nether (because I had nowhere else to go), I saw a sign reading ""Somewhere out there is the exit. Have fun!""

It is very fun I recommend playing it. Really quickly it is basically the IRL game 'Mafia' in gmod with traitors, innocents and detectives. 

I forget the exact name of the map but we were in a giant airbus and amongst the rest of the gamemode the map maker hid a secret in it. There were props that were spawned throughout the map each round that if they were gathered together formed a certain device. Now this device had to then be carried into another part of the plane and then that device would cut its way into another room and unlock it. Supposedly after unlocking that secret room, which happens to be the cockpit of the airbus plane, the players (innocents) seemingly have the option to win the game.

However, this server made it clear that they had never been able to do this before. We were on the last round of map and we had spent 30 long minutes trying to complete this objective. 

In the above instructions they had just finally put together the device - they had never gotten that far before. Unbeknownst to everyone I was a traitor and I had set a C4 in the room below the room they had to put the device in. 

The entire server was anxiously and excitedly waiting to see what would happen when they finally got this device into its place. What would happen when they went into the tightly locked cockpit and pressed the buttons? 

[Then the C4 exploded and killed eight people](http://i.imgur.com/Ow1Gy7Q.jpg). It was glorious. 

Seconds later, the last innocent person came from the back of the map to see what happened and I finished my objective by murdering the innocent terrorist.

Upon winning the round I was greeted by the groans, yelling and hatred of my former comrades. The admin that was on promptly slayed me before the round ended. Shortly after everyone tossed their insults at me the map changed and they never got their opportunity to do it again.

1368891550.0,75,self.gametales,1ekw6e,"[D&amp;D]Two characters down as of last night, and we laughed ourselves sick doing it.",87,12,8,http://www.reddit.com/r/gametales/comments/1ekw6e/ddtwo_characters_down_as_of_last_night_and_we/,"An update of the game mentioned [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/gametales/comments/1c7slz/dd_ash_vs_the_water_trap/). Recap: running a 4e D&amp;D Eberron campaign with five players. We have:
Kairon, the Demon of Karrnath, a tiefling warlock hexblade, LE and good at it;
Charatesh, a revenant warlock-sorcerer with some gaps in his memory;
Ash, a shifter shaman, our healer;
Cliff, our tank (recently switched characters and cannot for the life of me recall what he's playing now);
and Elinore, a ranger who was once a warforged and has since turned human, and is now (hilariously) having to deal for the first time with things like eating and breathing and sleeping.

When the game first began, the group had a tiny airship named the *Vomitous Spider*. One of the first things they did when the campaign started was to decided that they needed a bigger one, to really go all-out on the whole air-pirate theme they were cultivating. *Pirates of the Caribbean* quotes have been common - remember this, it becomes relevant in a minute.

So they go out and find a ship that they think will do, a big galleon all in red and black, flying a black flag and sporting the name *Redheaded Jack*. A couple of crippling flaming ballista shots later, they pull up alongside, drop gangplank, and board. This fight goes about as well as I intended, even though I underestimated how many push powers my players had at their disposal by a fair margin. Several members of the *Jack's* crew went flying over the side. I had prepared for this and equipped them with the Eberron equivalent of life vests - parachutes - but this just made it all the more hilarious when one of them fails his morale check and decides to just bail, and Elinore pins his 'chute to his back with an arrow as he's jumping over the side.

So they mow through the crew. The captain at the helm uses a magic item to phase through the deck as they reach her, to pull off her Dramatic Exit (TM). Charatesh actually comes within a micrometer of thwarting this by teleporting down into the cargo hold and tackling her as she's opening the loading doors and preparing to dive out with a glider. They roll around on the deck for a minute until the captain *only just* manages to peg him with a tanglefoot bag (I ruled it as an attack vs Reflex and beat his by 1). So Charatesh is glued to the deck, and before the rest of the party can reach the stairs leading down, she gets away. Kairon's player was actually excited about this, because he loves recurring villains. The ship is theirs!

So fast forward a few games. There's been a few side quests involving Elinore becoming human, and Ash seeking information/revenge on his village that was destroyed as a cub. The last few games have been about Ash tracking down the people responsible, and the group helping him to capture him for interrogation. This is where we picked up last night. And oh man. What a game it was.

The guy they captured was a platoon commander acting on behalf of the Church of the Silver Flame, who went by Serethis the Elegant - very haughty, very convinced they're going to kill him when they're done, so he quickly runs out of cares to give and the interrogation doesn't really go anywhere. So right off the bat, Ash just doesn't know what to do with the guy. The standard battery of questions are just going in circles, because this guy is a religious zealot, so all he does is cite orders from higher up in the church.

I will say this. I've got a really good group of players, but Kairon's player, /u/calabim, is one of the best RPers I've ever had the pleasure of gaming with. Always in character, always supports other players, always knows the rules and the setting. But he was in rare freaking form last night. When it's clear they're not getting anything more out of this guy, and Ash is getting frustrated, Kairon just launches into this speech. It was magical. It was like he prepared it beforehand. ""That was during the war,"" he said. ""And during the war, we were all a little mad."" He explained that if Ash kept going up the chain of command, it would never end, and there would never be any conclusion to his quest. And that pretty well effectively put an end to the matter.

Kairon leaves the matter in Ash's hands: do they kill Serethis or not? Ash decides that they're not going to kill him outright - they're going to get in the ship, fly up, and drop him over the middle of the Mournland, which, if you're not familiar with Eberron, is a place that you [Do Not Go To](http://eberron.wikia.com/wiki/The_Mournland). Dropping him there *is* killing him, just slowly.

As they're packing up and transporting their prisoner, I have them make a round of Perception checks. Succeeding, they notice that the *Jack* is leaving without them. So they haul it, making checks to grab onto the ropes before the ship gets too high. Everyone succeeds - except Charatesh, who trips and falls (critical fail).

The players of Elinore and Charatesh have had a sort of running joke for the past few games. The process that turned Elinore human was pieced together from her creator's notes by the group, but it was Charatesh that actually threw the switch to start the machine, so they've jokingly referred to each other as father and daughter. Elinore sees Charatesh falls, cries out, ""Dad!"" and makes a roll. It's not a crit, but it's damn close. She wraps the rope around one wrist, kicks off the hull, and swings around to grab Charatesh's hand in true swashbuckler fashion. Everyone starts climbing up the ropes.

At the helm they see a familiar human woman with flaming red hair - the captain of the *Jack* whom they stole the ship from in the first place! She boarded with a new crew while they were distracted with Serethis the Elegant and was taking off with it. The party slaps their feet to the deck, the crew draws blade, spells are readied, initiative is rolled...

""Parley.""

The whole table stops, and looks at /u/calabim. He's playing Kairon, *The Demon of Karrnath,* known for his ruthlessness in battle! But he's *also* known for being the most diplomatic person in the party, and everyone at the table - myself included - forgets that sometimes. He's always the first to try to talk when a situation goes bad. But if the talks fail, then, yes, he will *absolutely* slaughter you without a second thought.

The captain, intrigued by this sudden turn of expectations, lowers her weapon. ""All right,"" she says carefully. ""I'm listening."" She and Kairon begin to negotiate.

And that's when things went terribly, hilariously wrong.

Charatesh's player is a damn fine RPer as well, and he's definitely been one of the more entertaining people at the table this campaign. While Kairon and the captain are talking, I notice him pick up a die and roll it; many times my players have done this to make an RP decision for their character, and this was one of those times. The player hangs his head, just a little, and cries out, ""'Hey, I remember you!' Chaos Bolt."" His character, suddenly remembering that the captain was a Bad Person, flung a magic spell at her face. In the middle of negotiations.

Kairon - as you might imagine - takes offense to this. He strides over to Charatesh and smacks him with a push attack, throwing him off the side of the ship. Charatesh makes his Athletics check and grabs a rope on the way down. Kairon leans over the side. ""Now. Let's talk.""

I should point out that the table is in absolute hysterics by now. What's happening in-game is dramatic and all that, but me and my players all find this incredibly entertaining.

The rest of the party, and the NPC crew, have no idea what to do, and they're all frozen in a sort of horrified stupor. I think everyone's afraid to do anything. Kairon and Charatesh have a quick exchange concerning manners, but Charatesh insists that the captain is a Bad Person and they need to fight her. His player, on the other hand, knows exactly how bad of an idea this is but he sticks to his character and I love him for it. Unfortunately, so does /u/calabim: Kairon raises his demonic blade and shoves it into Charatesh's face.

That's when Elinore steps in. She leans over the side of the railing and lets an arrow fly, rolling really well. This is a push attack as well, which catches Charatesh with enough force to actually shove him back into a rope *as he's falling,* which wraps around his leg. So here he is again, dangling from the ship. Well, Kairon has just had enough of this guy, and finally just cuts the rope.

Elinore takes a few steps back and does the same attack - to Kairon. She hits and pushes him two squares, way off the side of the ship. Kairon can't do anything to help himself, and falls to his death. In between giggles, Elinore's player, my wife, asks if she can be referred to as The Demonslayer. I was so proud of her.

The captain, shocked, turns to the remaining three party members. Ash raises his hands. ""Parley?"" The captain, recognizing the potential of having these three as allies (they did defeat her once, after all) says, ""Welcome aboard,"" and that's where I called game. It took us a while to finally stop laughing. The two players who lost their characters have already started talking about what they're going to roll up next.

BONUS: a revenant's racial power allows him to chose to not go unconscious when below 0 hit points. Between this and the magic armor he was wearing that allows him to stand up and spend a healing surge, Charatesh hit the ground and got right back up again. HE LIVES!

Check out /r/Artemis if you're interested.  For the sake of the story, we had a helmsman who was navigating, someone managing all our weapons, and our engineer dealing with our power supply to different parts of the ship, and our Science head who scanned enemy ships for strengths and weaknesses.

It's about 11 PM, and we head off on our adventure.  I'm captain, and I've flown with these guys a couple times before, so I know our capabilities.  The mission we load up is not just hard: it's near impossible with only one ship.  We start off in the center of the map, and immediately our Science tells us that all 4 of our bases are about to be under attack.  Knowing that we can't possibly save all four and we need at least one to win the mission, I survey the map and notice that each one is surrounded by a special terrain: the top one is surrounded by asteroids, the left by a scanner-disrupting nebula, the right by a mine field, and the bottom by two black holes.  I immediately order our Helmsman to head down to the base surrounded by two black holes.  Everyone starts yelling at me.  The upper base is closest to being attacked, they say.  We need to defend it first.  I'm adamant about moving down.  After a few seconds of yelling, they finally listen and we're heading down.

Our Science now informs me that the ships we're facing aren't ships you'd expect to be coming in a fleet: they're huge Dreadnoughts with shields too strong for us to seriously fight more than one head-to-head.  Knowing what my Helmsman can do, I order him to do a fly-by on a few of them, while our Weapons hits them with some lasers and missiles.  They're chasing us.  I tell our Helmsman to head toward the blackhole.  Knowing that I must have some idea what I'm doing, he listens.  We speed up, but they're still chasing.  I tell him to fly just around the back hole, knowing that the enemy ships aren't too smart: they'll fall right in.  Suddenly everyone understands the plan: we can't seriously fight this many ships, so we just need to lure them into the holes without geting shot down in the process.

We keep this up for half an hour or so, and we've destroyed two out of four major fleets that have been spawned.  Suddenly, two Dreadnaughts jump within range of us.  Knowing what we have to do, our Helmsman turns up our warp drives and heads right for a black hole.  The problem is, he's gotten a little too used to this.  Instead of circling around and keeping a safe distance, he's trying to do a drive-by on the black hole, flying in a straight line right next to the center.  I keep telling him to turn, to move further away, to circle around the hole.  He won't listen.  It's only after I see that we're seriously turning into the hole, getting pulled in by it, and I threaten to take the controls and fly the ship myself, that he finally starts to turn.  The Dreadnaughts fly right into the hole and we're safe.

At this moment, he turns to me and says ""I only had to go max Warp for a little"", proud that he could so accurately read the capabilities of our ship.  That's when our brilliant but ever-so-quiet engineer turns to me and says ""I had the engines going at 300% that entire time.  They almost over-heated.""

We met a Drow girl that had been left alone in the basement of a town hall. We ended up bringing her along with us to a temple as the town we were in did not like strangers and was plague ridden. So far this is simple. 

We encounter some zealots in a clearing and a fight starts. Even though I am only an off tank (warforged fighter), I was the only tank present so I had to take all of the damage if I could. The battle begins, I roll a great initiative, so I get to start. Critical Miss. I get punched in the face by an Earth Elemental. 

Fast forward to my next turn, I had taken another hit and our DM had literally missed every other roll but the ones on me. I attack, critical miss. Another punch in the face. I am very worried at this time as all attacks against me have hit, all my attacks have crit miss, and not a single person in the party has been hit. 

The Drow girl picks up a rock. In her infinite wisdom she chucks a rock at the earth elemental. Critical Hit. She kills it. With a rock. 

The battle continues. I try to tie up the big bad in this fight. I attack and miss again. Not a crit this time though, so that is something. Once again, all attacks from the enemy miss everyone. But me. So far it's an effort for our healers to even keep me going. 

Our ranger and rogue are attacking the big bad with their range weapons and doing pretty well. The Drow girl picks up another rock. Whiffs it. A HIT!....she kills it. She killed the 2 most dangerous things in the battle. With rocks.

For those who are not familiar, Rome is a hybrid game with turn-based grand strategy and RTS tactical combat elements that is set during (you guessed it) the time of the Roman Empire. Due to Rome being insufficiently nerdy, I downloaded a mod called ""Europa Barbarorum."" The purpose of this mod is to improve the historical accuracy of the factions. This was several years ago, but you can still find it [here](http://www.europabarbarorum.com/index.html) if you are interested. As it was several years ago, my recollection is not perfect, but this still marks one of my favorite events in gaming.

Onward, to the story!

I began the game as the ruler of the Baktrians, a relative backwater faction, but with a great deal of potential. As the underling of a more powerful faction in the game, I was expected to support their agenda in my tiny corner of the world and otherwise keep quiet. I figured I was well placed to take advantage of this by getting in some relatively protected early growth before rising up to achieve freedom for my people.

I poured investment into developing my available technologies and building up a powerful economic base. Every few years or so, I would be contacted about supporting the invasion of some or other random backwater kingdom and I would dutifully call up a unit of my weakest troops and send them off to almost certain death. These were happy times, but my people still yearned for freedom from the yoke of oppression.

After many years of slowly building strength, I had developed a small, but powerful standing army complete with veteran hypaspists (think slightly less awesome Spartans); elite doryphoroi (unique bow and spear troops); a unit of elephant cavalry; and the crown jewel, my cataphracts (essentially medieval knight cavalry before there was such a thing). By the standards of my nearby neighbors, I was practically wielding alien technology from the future. Now all I needed was the perfect time to strike...

My ruler (oppressor!), the Seleukid Empire, was a vast powerhouse descended from the empire of Alexander the Great. As the regional superpower, they were constantly at war defending their territories from the surrounding powers, as well as from raids by lesser groups scattered throughout Asia Minor. Although they were powerful, they were stretched thin, and I knew that it was only a matter of time before they would be too heavily engaged to deal with me.

A few years further into the game, I began getting repeated requests for help dealing with the incursion of some barbarian tribe to the east. Given the frequency of the requests, I assumed that my erstwhile benefactor must be in dire straits. Seizing the moment, I sent out my elite army to raid and conquer the surrounding cities.

The local garrisons were crushed by my elephants and cataphracts before being ridden down by my light cavalry. In just a few short turns I had lain waste to the countryside and conquered most of the regions adjacent to my ever expanding little empire. Through all of the joy of conquest, I remained braced for the inevitable retribution that would surely come riding over the hills from my former rulers.

Through turn after turn however, nothing came. My armies ranged further and further afield, raiding and conquering deep into the heart of enemy territory. Still, no vengeance came. Finally, many turns later, seemingly by accident, one of my scout armies came across a barbarian army at the far eastern border of my territory. It had apparently just emerged from a group of mountains and I assumed that their territory must lie beyond.

Rather than take a chance on them raiding into my territory, I sent the scout army after them. This turned out to be a mistake. I immediately saw why the Selukids had been so desperate for help in the turns before I rebelled. This barbarian army was no rag-tag bunch of horse thieves, it was a vastly powerful and well equipped group of horse archers that quickly decimated my scouts and scattered the survivors.

These were not backwater bandits, this was Genghis Khan's grandfather. I quickly assembled the bulk of my most powerful units into one grand army and marched to the eastern border at greatest speed. My second line units marched immediately behind to provide support in what was sure to be a bloody conflict. It took a turn or two to find the barbarians, but eventually they were located in a pass between two towering mountain ranges. I immediately sounded the attack.

It was just as bad as I had feared. The extreme maneuverability of the horse archers combined with their ranged attacks to quickly wear down even my hardened veteran troops. Wave after wave of screening infantry gave their lives to defend the heavily armored but slow cataphracts. Elephants panicked at the constant damage and fled, wreaking havoc with my careful battle lines. Constant reinforcement from the second line troops allowed us to hold, but barely. Finally, with careful maneuver and a final brave charge by the remaining cataphracts, the enemy was pinned and destroyed. The enraged remnants of my army surrounded and slaughtered the barbarians almost to the last man.

Back on the campaign map, I began planning the long slow march back to my capital, calculating how much of my resources would be required to rebuild my shattered forces. I nonchalantly clicked ""next turn"" and absentmindedly watched as the computer turns flashed past. I took sudden notice when the barbarian's turn arrived and three new armies emerged on the other side of the pass behind the battlefield graveyard of their fellows.

The sacrifice of a scout unit revealed my worst fear: each army was essentially a complete copy of the group that had just decimated my forces. Suddenly it dawned on me that an empire as vast and powerful as the Selukids should not have been so desperate for help against mere barbarians. While I was planning their downfall, they were fighting for the survival of the west.

The remaining turns were short, as the barbarian hordes crushed my remaining forces and razed my cities to the ground. I never ran into the scenario again in future games (a bug perhaps?). In any case, that moment when the three armies rounded the corner on my broken forces was one of the precious few times when a game was able to provoke such a profound sense of fear and awe that I felt I had to share.

This is a tale that spans two different games over the course of several weeks. This is a tale of redemption. This is the tale of the Girl Who Couldn’t Quip... and it is about my wife.

My wife likes to roleplay. After a while I actually discovered that she’s pretty good at it, too. The predicament is that she gets uncomfortable doing it in front of other people. She’s great when we’ve run small games online, but put her at a table and she gets stage fright. Not a big deal - she still plays, and we work around it.

Well, during a D&amp;D game, another female player decides that she’s going to try to help my wife come out of her shell a little bit. My wife is playing a genasi swordmage at the time. After landing a pretty good hit that dealt cold damage, the other player encourages her to “make an action hero move quip. You know, like (best Arnold impression) ‘*Ice to see you!*’” Everyone at the table things this is a great idea, and we all start encouraging her to try. Well, unfortunately, my wife panics, and the best she do is blurt out, “Ice ya later!” She was a little embarrassed, but not too much, and everyone sort of took it in stride and we went on with the game. Later, after everyone left, my wife told me that she panicked because the other girl had suggested the *one line* that she would have used, and couldn’t come up with anything else. It wasn’t a big deal, no real harm was done, and life went on.

But then...

That particular D&amp;D game folded, as these things do. I was trying to teach the game to four out of my five players, and results were mixed. We decided to revive a game we had started some time ago but dissolved due to people moving, schedule conflicts, and so on. It’s called Swashbucklers of the Seven Skies. Definitely one of my favorite tabletops, but that’s another discussion. What you need to know about it for this story is this: in most respects it’s a pirate-themed fantasy world, only on floating continents and everyone gets around via airship. There are several nations, and one of them has a spy/bodyguard/assassin network known as the Imperial Spiders.

The party is your usual assortment of cutthroats and buccaneers - the drunk helmsman, the stoic mercenary, the thief that tries to steal everything that’s not nailed down, the explorer from the savage lands, and the fast-talking, always-has-a-connection swindler. My wife joins this game when we pick it back up, and we decided that her way in would be to make her a noble - a princess, to be exact (sidenote: no favoritism here. This is something you can do in this game, if you basically dump *all* your character choices into it, which is what she did) - and she would hire the crew to to do the whole escort-the-royalty-without-knowing-who-they-really-are thing, just instead of escorting an NPC who will fling herself into danger at the first sign of it and scream helplessly, they’d be escorting another PC who would reveal herself when the time came. It would turn out that she was running away from home, trying to escape a political marriage she didn’t want. All of this was my wife’s idea, and all of us loved it.

So they set sail, and a group of Imperial Spiders jumps them, having stowed away in the cargo hold. What they don’t know is that I put them there to pick up an old plot thread they had forgotten about (they originally stole their ship from a noble of that nation; in the interim he had gained the empress’s favor and she sent the Spiders on his behalf). *But* when the assassins of another nation show up on their ship on the very day a princess is running away from home, they assume that it has some larger, political ramifications that may or may not lead to war. (I don’t correct them at the time. &gt;:D )

The fight ensues. Some of the Spiders are cut down on the deck by sword, pistol, and arrow; others are pitched off the side (they have wingcloaks, which will let them glide back to land, but they’re out of the fight). They keep one alive and start questioning him. Of course, confusion reigns, since they think he’s there for one reason and the Spider is actually there for another, but either way, he isn’t talking. “I would never betray the honor of the Empire. Do your worst!”

“What if we just kill you?” asks someone.

The Spider just smiles. “The reach of the Empire is long and has many arms. Cut one off, and two more will come.” (Obviously stole a line from H.Y.D.R.A. here.)

My wife/the princess, having enough of this whole ordeal, grabs the Spider, hauls him to his feet, and says, “*I like pulling the legs off of spiders.*” She slits his throat, sticks a note on him that says “Don’t send any more,” drags him to the side of the ship, and pitches him off like a paper freaking airplane.

I assume you're at least passingly familiar with it if you're reading these stories.

My friend had a character named Art. He didn't do much besides explore the world, looking for cool things. In the early days of UO one of the biggest fears of all players was random throngs of PK's (Player Killers) who would show up in Red Shirts and Skull Masks and pretty much murder and rob any newbie who wasn't fast enough to get off screen before they could cast a spell.

So, Art's tooling around in the woods near Yew when, as luck would have it, he stumbles onto a screen where six or seven guys are wearing skull masks and red shirts. He freaks. He stands, stock still, like a bug hoping that no one has noticed him.

One of the guys walks over and says, ""You don't have your mask on.""

Art replies, ""I forgot it.""

The guy hands him a mask.

Then the guy says, ""Your shirt is the wrong color.""

Art replies, ""I don't have a dye tub.""

The guy hands Art a dye tub. Art dutifully dyes his shirt the proper color red and puts on his skull mask. He's terrified, waiting for them to realize he's not one of them.

A few minutes later the group is joined by two or three more guys who are clearly the leaders of this little band, because as soon as they show up one of them says, ""All right, let's go!""

The group moves off like a school of fish, following their leader.

After about a minute of cruising through the woods with these guys, Art is curious as to how he's going to get out of this situation.

And then the leader stops moving and says, ""Wait.""

The group dutifully stops, including Art.

Then the leader says, ""Who the *$&amp;% is Art?""

And that was when Art turned and ran in the other direction, moving quickly and erratically enough to evade them for about five minutes before making it to town, where they don't want to follow because the town guards will waste them.

If he logged in today Art would probably still have that mask and red dye tub in his bank.",Video,False,self,t5_2wqgc,False,video,,True,t3_1dd3yl,http://www.reddit.com/r/gametales/comments/1dd3yl/ultima_online_mistaken_identity/,

I was playing a rogue, and the new player, we'll call him Jack, decided to play a ranger.   
  
During his character building, he became obsessed with the handle animal skill and began to tame rats as he encountered them. He had purchased a bracer that acted as a bag of holding and he began putting rats in there. He had this grand idea of amassing a rat army. He kept a tally of home many he had. Later on, during an encounter with the BBEG, with an expression of triumph on his face, he told the DM he released his rats. He was completely disheartened (and probably this is why he didn't return to the game) when the dm said they all were pretty much instantly dead, having only 1hp each.   
  
My rogue was very much the thief, and every time we went somewhere I attempted to rob the place blind. Jack was very much the meta-gamer and would try to do the same, or follow me so I had to resort to passing notes to the DM about what I was currently doing.   
  
The story, as it transpired in note form while the rest of the party is leveling characters/ shopping/etc and we're staying in an inn in the city:   
  
Me: While everyone is gone, I begin checking doors on the second floor.  
DM: All of the doors open to vacant rooms, except for one door that is locked. As you approach it you hear the innkeeper's voice telling you to stay away from the door.  
Me: I walk away, and wait until later to check the door.  
DM: When you return, you hear the same exact voice say the same thing.  
Me: (having noticed the innkeeper was still downstairs yet this voice was coming from the room) I attempt to pick the lock  
DM: The lock resists your efforts to pick it. The voice yells at you.   Me: I head outside, and try to see if that room has an exterior window.  
DM: You head around into a back alley and see an open window on the second floor which you think might be the same room.  
Me: I look around the alley, what do I see?  
DM: Some garbage, a cat, some puddles.  
Me: (Suspecting there's a magic trap involved) I pick up the cat, and throw it up through the open window.   
  
(At this point the DM starts laughing, and writes back to me)  
DM: The cat is shot back out the window, and it smells terrible.
Me: Is it alive?  
DM: Yes, but it's throwing up possibly from the smell.  
Me: I pick it up, and throw it back through the window. (In order to see if the trap triggers again, or if a second more deadly trap fires)  
DM: (once again laughing) The cat flies back out the window, and it smells terrible. Roll a fortitude check against throwing up. The cat is now unconscious. Your hands, where you touched the cat smell just a bad, and you can't wipe it off.  
Me: Where's Jack's character?  
DM: You think he'd be in his inn room.  
Me: I throw the cat in his window.   
  
DM: (This time at the point of crying laughing, he says aloud) Jack, you are awakened in the night as something lands on your chest while you are sleeping. You awaken to the most terrible smell you have ever smelled. Laying on you is a cat covered in vomit, which smells so terrible you begin throwing up. The cat appears to be asleep.  
Jack: Is it magic? I use animal handling on it.   
  
After this, Jack was convinced it was a magical beast that he could use as a weapon. He stored the smelly cat in his bracer bag of holding.

The mod adds some new stuff, most notably of these is heavy fog at night and some new special infected. It makes things look pretty damn spooky, to say the least.

Right after I logged back in, I happened across a humvee. Naturally, I was pretty stoked. I had fun running around, gathering supplies, and raiding a few camps. I was on the top of the DayZ world. As is the way of DayZ, these things are never meant to last. 

Before logging out for the night, I decided to run to my usual refueling spot and fill up the tank before parking my prize in the forest somewhere. I have never, in my entire playing time, seen another soul up near this spot, and I consider it pretty secure. So I pretty much rolled up without a care in the world.

When, of course, I saw a car parked there with two people scrambling to aim at me. 

I hooked my car into a hard left turn and floored it into the forest without thinking. Had I turned right, I probably would have made it away in one piece... But as fate would have it, I only got a little ways into the woods when I smashed right into a tree. The damn fog was so thick, and I had been driving as fast as possible to get away. The humvee was tough, but it had lost a few wheels. I grabbed my spares and tested my skills as a pit crewman. In under a minute, I was zooming off into the great wild yonder.

Or so I thought.

I parked the jeep amongst some trees and assumed all was safe. I cooked some meat, ate up, and was just about ready to log out. Suddenly, from the mists, I see a form moving. Another player! I called out if he was friendly or not. He didn't respond. I hid in a tree, and he responded over text ""yes, friendly!"". I tried to get him to talk more, and that ended up being my mistake. I heard the click of a car door, and the roar of an engine. He took my damn car!

I tried to take some shots at him as he left, but it was no use. He was long gone into the misty night before I knew it. But I knew there was a hill and a large clearing the way he sped off, so I gave chase, hoping to get a better line of sight. 

But he had a friend.

I heard shots ring out from behind me. I managed to put down some suppressing fire to get him to hide behind a tree, but I was nearly out of blood and my legs were broken. I rolled behind another tree and took care of my wounds. One bullet and I was done for.

It was very quiet. The mist was thick, and it was almost impossible to make out any shapes beyond trees and grass. I kept moving from cover point to cover point in the direction I heard the shots from. I saw him. He saw me. It was a glorious hail of gunfire, but my body couldn't take any more abuse. I was dead.

In the span of just 15 minutes, I went from having everything I could ever want, to being dead.

(Repost from a DnD post I made 6 months ago)

It's been a decade, so excuse any spell name mistakes. 

We were playing in a campaign where the DM liked to lord over us with the PCs he and his friends used to play when they were young. They'd show up at bad times, and always be ""level 99"" npcs in our level 7ish DnD 3.0 game. They'd show up at times just to slap us down if we were doing well. 

Well, in this particular game it was just a dark paladin/blackguard played by my friend, and my sorceror. We were playing an evil campaign at the request of my friend. I forget what conditions occured that set the task in motion, but we were sent by an evil demigod (level 99 npc formerly played by the DM) to meet one of his allies, a level 99 (surprise!) evil cleric. For some reason, possibly because we were ignoring the quest, the evil cleric kidnapped someone we knew, and we had to go rescue her from the cleric. 

The cleric lived on the top floor of a massive tower, in the heart of a large city controlled by evil guys. Pretty much as soon as we arrived at the tower we were intercepted and lead up to meet the cleric. In the dm's usual style, the npc began mocking us and threatening us. I asked for a description of the rooms we were in, and the DM told me they were the personal rooms of the cleric, filled with trophies of fallen rivals, seemingly holy artifacts of rival priests that he had destroyed lining bookshelves. 

I looked at my friend and saw he too was annoyed by the cleric, after the cleric had already used hold person on us. I decided on a plan and went with it. 
  
Me: I challenge the cleric to a duel.  
DM: The cleric laughs  
Me: I repeat my challenge.  
DM: The cleric smiles and releases hold person on you.  
Me: I pull out a coin and begin flipping it. I tell the cleric i'm going to kill him and wipe the stupid grin off his face.  
DM: The cleric laughs in disbelief  
Me: How hard is he laughing?  
DM: He's practically in tears.  
Me: I cast trueshot (called shot? forget the spell name, gives +20 to your next attack roll to hit)  
DM: The cleric laughs harder at you.  
Me: I flip the coin into his open mouth, aiming at the back of his throat.  
DM: ... Roll it.  
Me: rolls some moderately high number which combined with the +20 allows my shot to hit  
DM: The cleric begins grasping at his throat, choking on the coin. Me: I cast detect magic.  
DM: Most of the objects in the room glow, some brilliantly.  
Me: What glows the most?  
DM: A wand on the shelves in amongst the holy items glows like the sun.  
Me: I summon a celestial dog.  
DM: umm.. you now have a celestial dog. The cleric is begining to recover, it sounds like he's close to coughing the coin up.  
Me: I order the dog to start chewing on the wand and Dan and I teleport out of the tower.  
DM: (Is not happy )  
  
Earlier in the game the DM had made a damaged magic item explode on us. Since he set the precedent, logic dictated the powerful item on the shelf would also explode.   
  
DM: From the distance you see the top of the tower explode, and a split second later, a blinding flash radiates from the tower enveloping the entire city. After your vision clears, you see the remnants of the city smoldering, nothing but foundations remain.   
  
DM: You guys suck.   
  
In the DM's typical fashion, the super bright glowy wand was a lawful good god's artifact that would have seriously messed us up if we had just tried to grab it and run away. With the dog destroying it, it released a ridiculous explosion, which had a chain reaction on all of the other powerful items. The fact that they were all good items in the heart of the evil city amplified the explosion. The DM wasn't happy. He ended our play session for the day.   
  
Me: Did we kill him?  
DM: Yes.  
Me: How many people were in the city?  
DM: Tens of thousands.  
Dan: How much experience is that?  
Me: Yeah?!  
DM: I'll tell you next time we play. (still not happy)   
  
Next week..  
DM: You both go up a level. Congrats, you are level 8.  
Us: WTF?! There were a bazillion people PLUS a level 99!  
DM: Oh, and the level 99 demigod of war you were working for is now an enemy.  
Us: Can we get some sort of reward from a good god for destroying a full city of evil people?   
DM: No. You are evil. Good wants nothing to do with you.  
Us: :(

We switched hands after a while, so now I’m running it and he’s playing, alongside a few more guys and my wife, who I mentioned in [this story](http://www.reddit.com/r/gametales/comments/1c3guo/astrianna_the_storm_sorceress/). He and I got to talking about /r/gametales and our game, and decided that we should probably share a couple stories from it. This is the tale of our shifter shaman, Ash, and the water trap.

The campaign’s coming along nicely, for the most part, and my players love their fights, so I draw up a quick little mini-dungeon side quest for them. Let them loose, you know? There’s a thing they need to get in the back of a goblin cave; the whole thing is three encounters long. A quick, fun diversion.

So in they go: Kairon, a teifling warlock hexblade; our healer, Ash; Zaneak, a shifter paladin of the Silver Flame; Charatesh, a revenant sorcerer; and my wife is playing a warforged ranger named Elinore. 

The first chamber of the cave has a stream running through it. Kairon, being the bloodthirsty demonling that he is, charges ahead. The first step he makes into the ankle-deep water, I roll to spring the trap - fail. But he still feels it trying to grab him, something slithering against his boot. He calls back to the rest of the party, “I think there’s something in the water!”

Ash comes up beside him and rolls Perception - fail. “I don’t see anything. Must be your imagination.”

Kairon just stares at him for a second - and then shoves him into the water. We all start laughing and I make the trap roll again, and *this* time it succeeds.

Icy tentacles made of water grab Ash and start pulling him downstream, to the deeper pond in the corner of the room (they later find out that this is an extension of a water elemental that the goblin shaman has bound to his service). Just before he gets pulled under the surface, Kairon yells back at him, “*Don’t worry. It’s just my imagination.*”

More to come. Stay tuned.",Table,False,self,t5_2wqgc,False,table,,True,t3_1c7slz,http://www.reddit.com/r/gametales/comments/1c7slz/dd_ash_vs_the_water_trap/,

One of the players (my best friend) had been acting like a complete dipshit the entire game, believing he could do anything and get away with it.

It came to a head when I had the group do a little fetch quest for Mehrunes Dagon so they could gather some important information from him regarding the BBEG. So they get his relic, or book, or whatever it was that I sent them to get, and go to his shrine so he can speak to them telepathically. My friend for whatever stupid reason, decided he wanted to start talking smack to Dagon..... Let me be sure I got that point across. 

He wanted to smack talk Mehrunes fucking Dagon, The Daedric Prince of Destruction. 

I forced myself through the conversation, but had Dagon end it rather abruptly and told the party to get out of the shrine before he lost his patience.... My buddy didn't get the hint. 

He kept on trash talking Dagon, while the rest of the party stood outside the shrine shaking their heads. Being the rather overly benevolent DM I was at the time, I told him that he could feel an ominous presence fill the room. There wasn't anything there, but he just felt as if something was... off.

He kept going....

So I said the ground around him began to tremble ever so slightly.

He still didn't stop....

The trembling began to turn into violent shaking.

He Kept. On. Going.....

So then a portal opened up in front of him and hundreds of tentacles emerged from it and pulled him into the portal, where he would spend the rest of eternity being tortured by Dagon's Dremora in his hellish realm of Oblivion.

Of course my friend was pissed that his character, whom he'd grown to love was now going to be spending the rest of eternity switching between 12 inch, spiked penis rape sessions, and being dunked in and out of molten hot lava, but he did learn his lesson.

Don't fuck with a God.

I highly recommend it. In it, the ""Dragonbloods"" have a vengeance against the Solars (different kinds of demigods) and want to wipe them all out. Solars are stronger, but there are only a few hundred of them at most, while there are thousands of Dragonblooded.

Anyways, one game, the players were Solars in the middle of Dragonblooded territory. This is like a group of rabbis in the middle of Nazi Germany. With giant glowing stars of David on their foreheads. They're trying to get to the coast to escape, and spend a night in a cave in the middle of a forest.

So, as per the norm, I made the one designated to keep an eye out roll an alertness check, even though nothing was going to attack them that night. He botched (critically failed). So, I told him he saw what looked like a group of Dragonblooded hiding, ready to attack. He called them all, everyone grabbed their weapons, mass panic, and after a few minutes of searching and finding literally nothing, the figure he saw something that wasn't there, and a different PC yelled at him and took over the watch.

So, everyone goes back to sleep. New watchman rolls alertness.

Botch.

Once again, mass panic, everyone searching, etc. They once again find nothing. One player concludes the local spirits must be angry with them. So begins a quest to find a baby doe to use as a sacrifice in a ritual to bless the spirits so they will stop haunting them. The spirits that don't exist.

After a bit of hunting, they have a baby doe. At this point, one of the players decides to stop this because she doesn't want to kill a baby. Several minutes of argument later, she lets the deer go. The player who came up with the spirit theory decides he's just going to have to find something else to appease the spirits. After a few minutes, he comes up with a reasonable solution.

He cuts off his own hand and burns it.

Nothing happens of course, because there were no spirits in the first place. But he concludes that he saved them all from the evil ghosts.

At this point it's morning, so they go trudging along. They come across a town, and the guy who cut off his own hand decides that he should try to act like a noble to commandeer a carriage.

So to sum up, they made camp, weren't attacked by imaginary ghosts, almost killed eachother, one of them lost a hand, and they ended up in a prison after a handless guy in battle-armour and his armoured companions, covered in mud and blood, pretended to be nobles.

Firstly, I'd like to get stricter over posting the game name. I think it's best if they are specified in parentheses at the start:


**(EVE) One of the biggest scams ever causes economic turmoil**    

**(Dwarf Fortress) Never trust a dwarf with an agenda**

I agree completely with Notmiefault, the more diverse the games we get here the better, but don't let that stop anyone posting more of the same. Also I don't want anyone to question whether or not something fits here - just post it, and we can debate it once it's up. There's no real rules about content here yet, and I hope all comments will be polite and friendly.

And please, everyone else, show the Self Posts some appreciation - writing up a story, whether short or epic, requires effort. So show some encouragement in upvotes and comments, even if some of the stories aren't up to those cherry picked from the whole of the rest of the internet.

I've been updating the sidebar with links to similar places in which readers here may be interested. It's not set, so if you know of any other large resources of gaming stories of any kind, let me know and I'll add them in.

Also, a few of the D&amp;D/RPG stories have had people expressing interest in the genre so I've added a few links to help people wishing to try it out. If anyone has additional links or info, let me know, but be aware we're quite short of space up the side.

Finally, I've added 'reverse page numbers' to the self posts on the left hand side. Hopefully now you'll get an instant idea of the length of each story, by checking the number nearest the top of the post - especially useful for when the text box disappears off the bottom of your browser!

I had been playing a dhamphir (half vampire) traitor that was waiting for the right time to betray the group and had been passing information about them on all game to their vampire lord enemies. Another player had been a human barbarian who had basically become a worshiper of Anubis. In the process, he received the power to transform into an aspect of Anubis while wielding his mighty battle axe shaped like a bladed ankh. There was a massive amount of animosity between the two characters (outside of that we enjoyed gaming together thoroughly), and it had been building all campaign. It finally came to a head when my betrayal finally occurred and I was sent to kill him.

The two met in a large open room, and for the first time he saw my vampiric form (something that took me all campaign to master). He knew what was coming and with a bloodthirsty smile gripped his axe as his body twisted into his Anubis form (which we considered a form of lycanthropy). I drew my double swords and we both performed a full charge. My blades sank into his shoulders, but he won the check. As a result, he took some damage, but my character took an ankh blade that absolutely shattered several ribs and cracked a few more. A human would have lost his guts on the swing due to the inhuman strength, but my dhamphir's powerful resilience managed to hold my chest wound closed and the fight continued.

Over the course of the fight, we were both disarmed. Unfortunately for me, his character was a hell of a lot sturdier than mine. He had my guy in a headlock and was attempting to finally break through my ridiculous undead constitution and break my neck. I was tough, but I knew I couldn't hold out forever. For the first time in the fight, one of us made a bite attack (we had been using claws up until now). Seeing as I was grappled, there wasn't too much room for me to miss. I sank my teeth into his arm and began to feed. An unexpected side effect of the vampiric venom, however, was to force the unlucky warrior out of his were-form, leaving a human attempting to grapple an undead.
He made a strength check at a huge difficulty and ripped his arm free with such force that he lost a chunk of it... but not before taking a fang with it. I was now thoroughly pissed. I didn't even bother turning. I reached behind me, yanked his head forward and sank my teeth and remaining fang into his neck. Now, Bill (the player) is known for playing some odds, but this next part was absolutely ridiculous.

As I began to feed, he only had enough life left for one more round before I drained him to death. He couldn't pull his throat free without ripping it out, and he didn't have any weapons to cut himself free with. What does he do? He reaches into the chest wound he gave me at the beginning of the fight and upon making a ridiculous strength check, with his bare hands, RIPS OPEN MY CHEST CAVITY, shattering what few intact ribs I had left. The shock from the massive damage was so great that I stopped feeding and released my target, at which point he seized the opportunity to reach into my gaping chest and show me my own heart. My character's last words: ""Holy f***...""

I activate my winged boots and fly across, because a wizard should never exert himself when other options are available.

Everyone gets over fine except for Fron, who rolls a bit too low. He falls down the pit. My sister (both IRL and in game) reaches out to help him, as he's been useful for a male. So she rolls, grabs him, he's safe.

But she's not. From behind, Ashila, spying an oppurtunithy for advancement, gives a bit of a shove and my sister is now falling down the cliff.

Now, EVERYONE saw this happen, except for maybe Fron. Lapu, a drow monk and not a member of our House, shrugs and watches us kill each other. I, on the other hand, realizing quickly that I don't really have any good rescuing spells, decide revenge would be a bit sweeter. While Ashila was snickering at the edge, I drew my orb and whispered the words of a familliar spell, one that would have me flayed alive if knowledge I used it on a preistess was known. In mid chortle, her eyes glazed over, her spined striaghted, and, of her own apparent volition, she took three quick steps over the edge.

It was Lapu and I remaining. I descended to talk, my boots still flapping.

Myr:

Lapu:
  ""Ah, yes, you're right. I suppose I can't have you contradicting my story.

The two of us looked down at our character sheets, then glanced at each others, and started figuring out the best way to survive the fight of our lives.

The GM was someone we all mutually knew, as we had all played a game with him at one point or another, but none of us had ever had him as a GM before. He was by no means a bad storyteller, nor was he a bad GM. The only problem with him was that he had a terrible habit of railroading the campaign down our throats. 

As for the party, my character was a Gangrel Independent, and my fellow party members consisted of a bat-shit crazy Malkavian, a womanizing Toreador, and a female Nosferatu (the player did this so she wouldn't be hit on by other players). Needless to say, we were quite the motley crew.

We were introduced to the Prince once we arrived at the city, and it didn't take long for me to grow a strong distaste for him. He was quite flamboyant, though that wasn't what bothered me about him. What bothered me was his cowardice. His hands were soft and his teeth were dull. He probably couldn't even remember the last time he drank human blood that wasn't being served to him in a crystal glass. Then again, he *was* a politician. Politicians never get their hands dirty.... they just hire people like me to get their hands dirty for them. 

The meeting went as expected. He was willing to grant us ""protection"" in his grand city, so long as we were willing to do whatever he asked of us. To prove our usefulness to him, he sent us on a mission to clear out an abandon warehouse filled with some fledgeling Sabbat.

We cleared it out without issue, and reported back to him. He was pleased, I guess. Though he couldn't help but continue to pick at me for some reason. Sure, I had griped about how I didn't like His Majesty's prissy nature, but that was said out of earshot of both him and his goons. Perhaps he had spies following us.... Or perhaps the GM wanted to be an all-knowing dick.

Regardless, the Prince began to make it clear that he valued my life slightly more than I valued his. The only reason I think he even bothered to keep me alive was because so long as his cronies had their blades at my throat, I had no choice but to cooperate with him. So he sent us (me particular) on suicide mission after suicide mission, not expecting for me to come back. Every time I came back, the Prince prospered because of my survival. I was a trump card that he could have given two shits about. If I didn't come back by sunrise, then he wouldn't have given half a damn. If I did come back though, then that meant I fulfilled the tasks I was given, and because of that, he was the only one to prosper from it (because he sure as hell wasn't awarding me with anything).

This continued on for quite a while, allowing me and the party to become pretty high leveled. This game went on so long in fact, that the GM just quit overseeing our leveling up, and entrusted us with filling out our new disciplines accordingly.

During our downtime, I tried to get friendly with the Anarchs in the hopes that I could get away from the Prince. The Malkavian and the Toreador could've cared less about the Anarchs, but me and the Nosferatu girl got to know them pretty well. They were an alright group, better than the Prince, that's for sure. 

Well, it turned out that The Prince had found out (The GM bullshitted) that we were hanging out with this group of rather ""questionable"" individuals. He didn't like that at all. He told us that we were not to associate with them, should we wish to continue to have his protection.

At this point I had to bring up that even the Anarchs were technically under the protection of the Camarilla as well, to which the Prince said they were not protected under *his* Camarilla (I guess it's worth noting now that the GM was absolutely in love with the Camarilla, and hated the idea of us joining the Anarchs).

We begrudgingly were forced to accept, and continue following his orders like glorified attack hounds. The Toreador seemed okay with this, as he was very much in the Prince's favor, the Malkavian was rather indifferent, but me and the Nosferatu weren't exactly fond of running errands for the Prince. Me and her began secretly plotting (out of earshot of the GM) that we were going to get in really good with the Anarchs and use them as protection against the Prince.

Unfortunately for us, our plans went south *really* fast

The GM somehow found out about our plans for defection, so naturally, the Prince magically knew about our plans as well. He sent me and the Nosferatu on a mission he knew we wouldn't come back from, while he sent the Malkavian and the Toreador on their own much less dangerous mission. The mission they were sent on was diplomatic mission to gain trust with the Giovanni. As for us, he sent us walking literally into the front doors of a Sabbat stronghold. 

We were almost certain we were going to die in that derelict building. Fortunately for us, the dice was on our side, and with a combination of luck, skill, and strategy, we managed to wipe out enough of them to clear an escape path, even killing their Archbishop. 

Once we made our escape, we attempted to flee to the Anarch's hideout in hopes that we could stay with them. Once we arrived there, we discovered much to our horror that that wasn't going to happen. The entire hideout was demolished. 

Given completely zero options, we went to confront the Prince. When we got there, the Prince was quite clearly surprised to see us alive and well. He asked what happened with the Sabbat, and we told him that we killed their Archbishop and got the hell out of there.

He didn't seem to hold his grudge against us though, instead opting to tell us that the Anarchs had instigated a riot and the Camarilla was ""forced"" to deal with them violently. Not only that, but the Sabbat hadn't exactly taken kindly to their Archbishop being killed, and had started going feral in the middle of the streets. 

At this point, me and the Nosferatu told him we were fucking off and siding with the Anarchs, because we'd had enough of his shit. 

His response? He had his cronies stake both of us before we could even leave the room.

This is where shit starts getting bad. The Toreador and the Malkavian (Whom were waiting for us along with the Prince) were starting to get freaked out, and asked the Prince what the fuck he was doing. Then the prissy mother fucker pulled out a sword and walked up to the Nosferatu girl and cut her fucking head off.

He said ""The only reason I'm even considering sparing a piece of Gangrel trash like you, is because you are still useful to me. So all you have to do is swear your allegiance to me."" Given absolutely no choice, I begrudgingly agreed.

His cronies pulled the steak out of me and let me go. He gave us our orders to kill the Anarchs, Sabbat, Independents, and any other vampire that wasn't a part of the Camarilla. Then he let us go.

The streets were a war-zone. People screaming and shouting, gunshots going off everywhere, while news reporters were covering it all. This battle went on for literally days. The city was put under martial law, and it was complete and utter chaos. We'd spend the nights fighting, and the days regrouping and planning inside the safety of abandon warehouses. On the fourth night though, the battle had reached its peak. All of the Prince's soldiers were on the streets, and the Prince was sitting pretty in the safety of his tower, all alone. I knew now was my best time to strike.

You see, remember earlier when I said that the GM had quit overseeing us fill out our disciplines? Well, I had reached Protean Level 7 without any of the other players or the GM knowing. For those of you who don't know, Protean Level 7 is a Gangrel exclusive discipline that allows the user to transform into a mythical beast of their choosing.

I showed the GM my character sheet, letting him see that everything was in order, and then transformed into a mother fucking dragon. As soon as I transformed, all of the news cameras were put onto me, and I began flying to the top of the Prince's tower, perching atop the peak.

I slammed one of my claws through his balcony window, and ripped the Prince out of the shelter of his home. 

At this point the GM started freaking out. 

The Prince began screaming for me to put him down, telling me that this was an offense punishable by death, and that what I was doing was an extreme violation of the Masquerade. To which I replied with ""Look around, we're on live television! Everyone around the world is watching a dragon perched atop the tallest building in the city! Your Masquerade is dead!""

The Prince still tried to talk me out of killing him by telling me that if I killed him no one would take my side, and that I'd become the most wanted vampire in the entire world. 

Then I said one of the best quotes I've ever said in an RPG.

""Anarchs, Independents, and even the Sabbat will see you die by my hands. They've been wanting a revolution for centuries, and they will finally get it. When they see their weak and feeble ""leader"" devoured by ""Gangrel Trash"", they will revolt, and they will call for the Camarilla's blood. The rule of old men who are stuck in the past is over, and now is the time for change, a change that will start with you.""

Before the Prince could even give a retort, I ate him.

After that, the GM flipped his shit and literally walked out of the game. We never played another game of Vampire The Masquerade together after that, but then again, it couldn't have possibly ended in a higher note.

TL;DR: The Prince is a bastard, karma's a bitch, dragons are badass, I killed the Masquerade, and you guys should go play Vampire The Masquerade.

Our DM connects all the 4e settings so that we can explore them as most of us haven't played that extensively before this campaign. We currently have a quest to get pure Athasian water from the Dark Sun setting.

Flash back to last game, we got to fight a dragon. In fact, it was our first dragon. I was pumped. The battle was epic and we all had fun. Well, Geeni, the guy who we have been working with, sent us back to the site of this battle as a portal to Athas had just opened there. The battlefield was a font of elemental chaos, you see, and had collapsed after the death of the elemental dragon.

Ok, cool. So we go back, thinking we would just hop into the portal and be on our way. We were wrong. The lava that once surrounded the field was now ice, and where the dragon once stood was now an undead, ice elemental dragon. The basterd would not give up.

He hasn't seen us yet, though, so our neathermancer send a shadow serpent to destract the dragon so we could sneak by him into the portal. He takes the bait and moves away from our goal. Next was our cleric. She sneaks up the the portal, but as soon as she get to it, the dragon appears infront of her, as if by some unnatural means. 

Now, up until this point, our cleric had stood in the back healing and buffing. We considered her a squishy, even referred to her a such. So seeing her alone facing a dragon we thought we killed was unnerving. We all told her to get out, but she had one action left. Move and she'd provoke and opportunity attack, shift and she'd still be in range. After a moment of ""oh shit"", she realized he was undead and she was a mother fucking cleric. She cast turn undead. Hit. The dragon fled in terror. We all jumped into the portal and avoided a powerful enemy. The cleric felt a power unknown to her. She, our healer, had single handedly, effectively defeated a dragon, as in the other half of the games namesake.

1366934823.0,62,self.gametales,1d4bvl,[Homebrew RPG] The Best-Laid Plans,70,8,19,http://www.reddit.com/r/gametales/comments/1d4bvl/homebrew_rpg_the_bestlaid_plans/,"Recently, I tried my hand at creating a homebrew tabletop RPG. Seemed like a decent challenge and a good way to occupy my time. Ended up being something a little like a mix between D&amp;D, New World of Darkness, and FATE. This isn't an advertisement, though, so I'll cut to the chase: when you're making an RPG system, playtesting is vital.

And who better to playtest than my normal play group?

I got them to go along with my asisine plan, I explained the system to them, and I set about GMing a campaign designed to flesh out the setting and fine-tune as many mechanics as I could muster in a natural way. Now, it went well for a while; I got the players wrapped up in a story about political maneuvering where they weren't exactly sure who was manipulating who, but the campaign came to a head when the team was stuck inside a city-- all citizens were barred from entering or leaving.

You see, on their first day there, the kingdom's prince, who had been staying in that particular city, had been assassinated by an unknown assailant.

I did my level best to give the players a good murder mystery; while they had a necromancer who could speak to the deceased prince's spirit, the prince wasn't aware of who had killed him, and being generally unliked by the working class *and* the nobility, it turned into sort of a Who Shot Mr. Burns? scenario, fraught with red herrings and false leads. After sleuthing and searching for quite a while, they did manage to turn up one ally in the court who seemed of help, and seemed to know what was going on with the assassination. So one of our players, a Knight/Bard agreed to meet with this nobleman in a secret place to discuss this (with the rest of the team hiding out of sight nearby).

Naturally, the players were somewhat surprised when the nobleman shows up with a bodyguard, who quickly dismisses the situation by saying that he thought the situation seemed dangerous and someone may attack them next for knowing about this. They were doubly surprised when the nobleman announced, in a hushed tone, to our Bard:

&gt;""I believe I know who the assassin was-- in fact, I think you've met him since you've been in this city.""

&gt;""Really? Who was it?""

&gt;""Me.""

When the nobleman started casting a spell on our hapless bard, the rest of the team jumped out of hiding; however, the fighting didn't even last for a single round, because one of the players, a samurai, stepped forward and sheathed his sword.

&gt;""I walk up to him, sword sheathed, and tell him, 'I mean you no harm-- I simply wish to know why you have done this.'""

&gt;""Uh... [ahem] 'Why? Because the prince was an impetuous lout-- he would've brought this country to ruin with his harebrained schemes had I not intervened.'""

&gt;""'You have a bodyguard... are there any more of you?'""

&gt;""'Yes,' he gloats, 'our organization is small, but powerful. We're dedicated to building up the world anew-- by tearing out the corruption plaguing it completely.'""

&gt;""Okay, I'm going to offer to join him.""

&gt;""...wait, hold on.""

The samurai reasoned that not only does he have no quarrel with this nobleman and no affiliation or allegiance to this country's ruling class, but he also agrees with this anarchist group's goals, and wants to help them if possible. *Okay,* I figured, *it wouldn't be the first time one of us goes turncoat-- I've certainly done it enough-- this can probably slide.* The anarchists were designed to be the villains of the campaign, but having one of the players join them might make it more poignant for the rest, after all.

What got me was when the entire team decided this was sound reasoning and offered to join up with the anarchists and destroy the government.

When that happened, all I could do was look down at my campaign notes slowly, look back up at the table full of players, and solemnly decree:

""I will allow this... but I would like to let you guys know that I officially hate all of you.""",Tabletop,False,self,t5_2wqgc,False,table,raconteur,True,t3_1d4bvl,http://www.reddit.com/r/gametales/comments/1d4bvl/homebrew_rpg_the_bestlaid_plans/,

I must have been 14 or 15 and it was my first LAN party.  Call of Duty 2 had just come out and it was all the rage at the time so naturally that's what everyone wanted to play.  There were about 20-ish kids of various ages in the place which meant we had enough for a team match.  I got put on the American side, which made me happy because who wants to be a nazi?

I chose the Thompson for no particular reason other than it was the weapon I was most familiar with.  Now, I didn't consider myself to be very good at FPS games back then, I still don't, and I'm not a very competitive person so I figured I was going to do pretty badly.

The map was some french town, I forget what.  Lots of narrow streets and burnt out houses.  There was one house that was a pretty good sniping spot and about 4 or 5 American snipers had gone up to the attic and were taking pot shots at Germans.  I figured I'd help them out by guarding the stairs with my Thompson.  I took up a position at the top of the stairs and we had a good thing going.  They would shoot Germans trying to get to the building and I would take out the ones they missed when they entered the house.  Naturally, this made the German team pissed and they threw wave after wave of guys at us.

After a while, I took a look back at my snipers and to my shock they were gone!  I still don't know if they were killed by a series of lucky shots or if they just chose to move on but whatever.  I then looked back down the stairs and saw about 6 or 7 Germans amassing to run up and kill what they thought was pretty large group of Americans.  I knew I was going to die.  Even though it was just a game, the knowledge of my doom gave me a sort of sinking feeling but that feeling quickly turned to purpose.  These nazi fucks weren't gonna take me easy!

I took inventory.  An MP40 (I'd long since traded for my empty Thompson) with about 3/4 of a clip left, two german grenades and my trusty Colt pistol.  I briefly chuckled, thinking me and the Colt were the only Americans in the building.  Alright, it was go time.

I tossed one grenade down the stairs.  From across the room I heard a kid shout, ""Oh shit, you guys!"" and then BOOM!  Three dead Germans.  One of them ran upstairs to escape the blast, didn't see me.  Three shots to the back of the head and he went down.  I descended down the stairs to now scattered Germans like I was goddamn Death incarnate and shot another guy.  At this point my SMG was out so I switched to my pistol.  The remaining Germans had reorganized and kind of realized that I was just one guy.  I sent a few bullets their way but it was no good.  The three of them shot me down.

From across the room I heard a kid say, ""Is their whole team up there?""  No, kid, just me.  That was the proudest gaming moment of my life.",Video,False,self,t5_2wqgc,1367711169.0,video,author,True,t3_1doz1m,http://www.reddit.com/r/gametales/comments/1doz1m/call_of_duty_2_one_stood_alone/,
1367530983.0,58,self.gametales,1dku2l,[WoW] The slaying of Aran,68,10,9,http://www.reddit.com/r/gametales/comments/1dku2l/wow_the_slaying_of_aran/,"Back in the Burning Crusade days of Warcraft. My college roommate and I belonged to a small casual guild with aspirations of raiding. Karazhan was the perfect fit, as it wasn't very hard for us to get 10 geared people together at least 2 nights a week. We had made great progress for a casual guild, but the week before had hit a wall when fighting [Shade of Aran](http://www.wowwiki.com/Shade_of_Aran). The week before we had cleared up to him on our first raid night, made a couple of attempts, then called it a night due to it being late. The next raid night we spent a couple hours dying repeatedly, but making progress. 

A little background on the fight. Aran stands in the middle of his library. As soon as you engage him the doors lock and nobody can get in or out. He has a bunch of minor attacks that use up his mana and can be interrupted. When his mana is low he turns everyone into sheep who cannot attack or move and drinks to recover it. When his health gets to a certain point, he summons 4 water elementals to beat on the raid. He has 3 major attacks. Two encourage you to move in order to get out of the way of massive damage. The third however will surround 3 players with fire and  damage everyone else in the raid if those players move at all.  Because of this, some wipes were from just one player making a mistake. There was lots of frustration and anger towards each other the end of the raid.

Sensing morale would be an issue, the next week we cleared up to Aran, tried once, and then the guild leader declared “Get some rest, he’s going down tomorrow.”  The next night, knowing morale had been strained the week before, we made an effort to keep things light-hearted between attempts. A few of us had brought Savory Deviate Delights, an item that transforms whoever uses it into either a pirate or a ninja. After the first wipe we passed out delights and attempted to do an all ninja attack. It almost worked, we had him at less than 10% health, when someone accidentally moved when they weren't supposed to. We resurrect, gather in the doorway to the library (someone had gotten locked out the week before)  and rebuff. It was decided we should be pirates this time. 
My roommate, a very competitive shadow priest, was third behind the guild leader (warlock) and me (also warlock) in damage done the last few tries. He claimed latency issues (it was fine for me) and decided to bring his laptop to a common room at the front of our dormitory, which had the wireless router in it.

So our group is buffed up in the doorway, waiting for my roommate to give us the all clear over voice chat. All of a sudden, with no warning, I see his character run straight at Aran. Our guild leader yells over the microphone for the tank to move in. We frantically get into position and begin the fight.  My roommate had run through Aran into the back wall, but I see him turn around and start casting.  

Adrenaline is rushing as we burn the mage down.  We manage to avoid his attacks, and for once nobody moves when they shouldn't. He summons up his elementals, and within seconds the other warlock and I have two banished. A couple seconds later I send the third running in fear. We kill them one at a time, and the last one dies just in time for Aran to turn us all into sheep. He taunts us, drinks his mana up to full then begins combat again.  The most difficult parts of the fight over, we can concentrate on keeping our damage rotations going and getting out of the way of his blizzards and explosions. We have him at 5%. This is the farthest we’ve ever been. It looks like we are going to make it. I get the spell where I can’t move, so I freeze in place. 2% health and I can move again. He won’t be able to cast that spell again for at least a minute.  Aran shouts out “The nightmare is over” and my speakers erupt with cheers.

Once that dies down, the guild leader gets on the microphone, congratulates everyone and immediately ask my roommate ""What the hell was with that battle charge?""
I then hear my roommate laughing into his microphone. “Sorry guys, I put my mouse in my pocket when I ran up the stairs.”

Two were experienced players already, one with DM experience, while the rest of us had never done tabletop before. We made our characters on the online creator, and met tonight for our first session. This is the tale of our first session recounted as best as i can remember. This is going to be a massively long read, and i apologize, but i will try to cut out as much as possible without hurting the overall effect.

Setting: 

All involved characters grew up learning about legend of the great war. The war waged for eons against the four elemental primordials (earth, water, air, fire) until the Gods sent down four angels, who then sacrificed themselves to contain the primordials. The rebuilding period that followed lead to competition between city states and massive, sprawling cities developing in previously sparse areas.

Arrival:

Each of our characters arrive at different times in a quaint district. We each do our introductory turns


Isaramin, our female hengeyokai cleric gets a blessing from her church, and is enlisted by a cloaked figure who runs the mage shop to peel several thousand carrots in return for a blessed mace, succeeds in peeling 97%, then growls as she's leaving which makes the figure angry, and her new mace dissipates into thin air.

Davneiros, our dragonborn warlord drops his shield off with the dwarven smith for a 50gold upgrade, and ends his turn.

Throzgar, the half giant weaponmaster, makes his way to the brothel. He nat 20's a charisma check, and becomes instant friends with the 9' giant bouncer. He gains audience with the Matron, and inquires about what he can get for 20 gold. The Matron looks carefully at him, and replies with ""More than you can handle"". Throzgar confidently assures her that ""I can handle it"". DM: 'Roll for endurance'. 


He rolled a 19, which earned him the respect of every brothel girl in the region, and a 30 percent take of the brothel every day.


Dusk, our shade assassin, is not so lucky. He enters the brothel, and begins demanding information rather brashly. The giant bouncer informs him that he should leave, but being a hot headed shade, he rolls for initiative instead. 4. Giant knocks him out, throws him in the street in front of the inn, and his turn is over before it even really began.

Tabu, the Shade Psion, helps a stable owner corral her escaped horses,securing 4/5, but then later fails a charisma check and calls the brothel matron a bitch, which leads to him being banned from every establishment in the town. He kicks the unconscious body in the street on his way out.

My character is a half elf wizard named spetrovi. He meets the inn's barkeep for information about a strong ale he had heard of, who points him in the direction of the alchemist. The alchemist is a goblin named ziggs who is on the whole very shady. After going in verbal circles, spetrovi works out that the technique can't be learned in less than a month, and that he should seek a better teacher elsewhere. He leaves to seek out some strong alcohol.

Nagad olimpius, our dragonborn paladin, arrives and pays some locals to move the unsightly body to the fountain. They try to scam him, and he fails every check to avoid losing half of his 100 gold wallet.

Bengal Hairybasements is the flaming (in two ways) human swordmage. He too visits the alchemist, but offers sexual favors instead of money, which ziggs is keen to accept in repayment for some potions. Unfortunately, he was betting on his athletics check to get out of the situation, but critical failed and essentially knocked himself out and was raped by the goblin, thus contracting a goblin strain of herpes in his first turn.

So in summary, by the end of the first day, tabu is banned from most establishments int he district, isaramin peeled 7000 carrots in return for what was now a pile of dust (and the carrots were eaten by a runaway horse), davneiros had a +2 to ac thanks to his new shield, throzgar now owned a brothel and was a sex icon, dusk had been knocked unconscious and made a fool of himself, spetrovi had gotten intoxicated, Nagad had lost half his money, and Bengal had managed to contract goblin herpes. What a productive first day.

it goes down: 

At the end of the day, we are all in the inn, with tabu having found a corner to sit in where nobody will recognize him. A guard enters, shouting about an attack on a nearby town. The entire group agrees to accompany him, minus spetrovi, who prefers not to make alliances so quickly, and instead follows behind at a distance.

We just had what I think was the single most amazing D&amp;D game I've ever had.

I laughed so hard I could barely breathe.

In another moment, I felt fear so great that my hands were wet with sweat, my pulse racing, my breath ragged.

We witnessed a scene that tore me with uncertainty between screaming in rage, crying in despair, or vomiting in disgust.

We were overwhelmed, facing impossible odds, and I felt fearfully certain that what little victory we might find would be a pyrrhic one.

And at the end of the session, I was nearly jumping from my seat in glee, profoundly victorious, we three the heroes in a way few D&amp;D heroes can truly be.

We rescued hundreds of tortured, starved slaves from bondage, from a small, private army that was specifically prepared for attack. The exodus drew the attention of the city's full army of two thousand, which marched against us.

We got the slaves away, under sheltering illusions, such that no one has the faintest idea where to look. We distracted the guards, and routed the army.

All without a single casualty. We neither killed, nor lost any of our own. We risked our hides in pursuit of the moral high ground...

And we won.
    
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
    
My DM is... sort of a dick. He can be mind numbingly brutal, but he's extremely fair. When we saw those people... mutilated, tortured, but still *our people*... we knew we didn't ""arrive at the speed of plot."" We knew they were dying. We knew their numbers would decrease every day, and with the city about to go to war...

We knew what we ""should"" do. We ""should"" play the politics, sneak around, get information and simply writhe with loathing for the man behind it all. We knew that we were hunted... hell, my character, the leader of the rebellion to free all magic users from slavery, was at the moment, confined in a prison, in solitary confinement, about to be tried and possibly executed. Fortunately, I had a little enchantment that kept me in touch with my people - so I was still the leader.

We ""should have"" written them off as casualties, because the army would mobilize against us if we tried anything, and there was just no way...

And that's what the DM was expecting.

Instead... 

Instead we stood up and said, ""No."" Instead we risked everything for these people.

The red dragon disciple monk/sorcerer (houserules + monk = awesome) ran in, with her speed getting her to all the people in a rush, her magic shattering the locks, her fists disabling the guards without so much as a drop of blood. She guided her people, and led them, guarded them.

The druid flew high above the complex, casting magic to draw the magic-finding sensors of the guards (they were prepped against magic users specifically), and charming the animals of the mansion to his side. He even guided the group of fleeing magic users from above, taking advantage of his sight, by use of a charmed horse stolen from the stables.

And me... I had our allies, our NPCs, and coordinated with both of the PCs. While the DM watched the clock, and we knew our actions were taking place nearly in real time, I sweated as I gave orders, got information, struggled to make plans.

One ally forged walls of stone to stall the army. Another wove mind magics over what few guards spotted the fleeing people. And illusions were cast over the lot of them. None of the guards ""saw"" the people fleeing. All they knew is that they were ""under attack"" by magic users, and called in the army for aid.

And really, who wouldn't call in the army against a rogue Tier 1 spellcaster? (Another way of saying, a top ranked type of magic user. We're deadly dangerous.)

The druid then did the most dangerous thing of all... he charged the army itself. He was already a flying pincushion, with hundreds of arrows sticking out of the magical, wooden sheath he'd covered his skin in. He was already a stone's throw from death and out of healing spells from the guards. And yet, he charged the army.

Because the monk needed more time. The freed slaves were too weak to even run.

The leader of this division... the one in charge of the front lines, who had been, up until minutes earlier, personally guarding my cell with a special weapon that can destroy magic users in a single strike (they really don't trust supremely powerful leaders of a magical rebellion. I wonder why :P), she raised her weapon against him.

She, who I'd been talking to, whispering words of my purpose, of my dreams. She, who I'd been convinced was a good person. She, who I'd decided to trust, and give a play by play of what we'd been doing just now, giving her information enough to ensure my execution, and kill both the other PCs, and the rest of they who followed me, should she choose.

As she charged up to the druid on her winged horse, we held our breath, waiting to see whether I'd been right about her. Whether I'd been right to trust her.

She glanced down at her army: distracted, confused, and order broken by the illusions and walls of stone that harmlessly encased it. She turned a smile to the druid and said, ""A shame I couldn't catch you, but it seems I have to take care of my men, don't I?""

He thanked her, and used the last of his magic to make himself invisible, and darted towards the city. They could track magic like that, but only she had the authority... and so he lost himself in the alleyways.

And the army, so distracted, failed to find the monk as she led over a hundred broken souls to the one part of the city that was permitted to have magic - the airship, under construction by the military, for use in the coming war. 

Magic is an evil and terrible thing... unless you're going to war. Politics, bah. The thing was rife with enchantments.

And also secret. How would the population react to knowing they were using *magic* in the war?

1368459785.0,53,self.gametales,1e8zeb,[Shadowrun] In which shit hits the fan...,66,13,4,http://www.reddit.com/r/gametales/comments/1e8zeb/shadowrun_in_which_shit_hits_the_fan/,"Last week I posted a [story about our Shadowrun game so far](http://www.reddit.com/r/rpg/comments/1djmu6/our_heist_is_on_the_verge_of_becoming_a_stickup/), so I figured I'd follow up and let y'all know just how much of a clusterfuck it's become. Read Part 1 behind that link if you didn't already. I'll wait.

You ready? We good? OK.

So Hammer and I close the door behind our dead guard - now we've got a situation. I briefly consider finding a way to carry the corpse back up the 14-story ladder to the roof, but with no way to clean up the gore I've sprayed around the room, hiding the body seems a little pointless.

The only other exit from the maintenance closet is a staircase leading down to the boiler room and sub-basement, and I have no idea who or what is down there.

I pull my cyber-eye out of its socket and let it roll to the bottom of the steps so I can get a view of the next room.

The boiler room is empty except for two guards posted by the door on the far side. Beyond that door is the sub-basement that we know the safe is in. From where my eye is lying I can see the elevator, and two very well-armored guards with assault rifles to either side of it.

I grimace - we might have to get through them eventually, but now's not the time. All we can do is wait for a report from our moles inside the party, and be ready for the second backdoor guard to come back from his wild goose chase.

Of course it's right about then that he does. The doorknob turns, and I'm on him before he's got the door all the way open. My survival knife is hilt-deep in his belly before he can react, and his scream becomes a red gurgle before it can leave his mouth.

""Shhh. Sleep now,"" I whisper, just before Hammer swings her [namesake](http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-K7gAh026oPs/TdXFRSeZ77I/AAAAAAAAB3k/NXrgGXvLL_4/s1600/Thor%2BMovie%2BMjolnir%2BPapercraft.JPG) into his temple and paints the room with his brains. The guards in the next room don't move from their post, as my other eye confirms, and I breathe a sigh of relief.

Meanwhile, Fury and Genie (our helpful NPC) are taking in the sights at the gala - and losing a fair amount of nuyen at the table games. They meet Mr. Caravaggio, the elderly crime boss hosting the event, as well as his greasy son. They watch people spend lots of money, and waitresses take large baskets loaded with credsticks and head for the elevator.

Only one problem there - with my eye in place, I haven't seen anyone come or go in the subbasement. The safe is a decoy, and the money is being held elsewhere in the building.

Sweet talking a particularly stupid waitress, Fury finds out the money's being held on the *first* basement level. We're obviously in no position to use the elevator, so I retrieve my eye, and Hammer and I head back up to the roof, to regroup with Coltrane and find another way.

Clearly the front door isn't an option, and the basement has no windows, so we figure we have to go in through the roof and make our way down through the building. There's an HVAC system that's big enough to let me in, but not our hackers, and there's a roof access door, but it's locked. Just our luck, then, that after a few minutes the door opens and a single, dwarf guard walks out.

We hide, but it's hardly necessary: by the way he's wobbling, he's clearly drunk. He weaves over to the edge of the roof and lights a cigarette as he looks out over the city.

I'm halfway across the roof before my friends have a chance to stop me. I steal up behind him like a shadow, plant my hand on the small of his back and give him a shove.

He's framed in midair for a moment, against the city lights. I pluck the cigarette from his mouth as he falls, and take a long drag until I hear the impact.

""Smoking kills,"" I mutter sardonically, and send a gob of spit flying after him.

We head through the now-open roof access door and immediately start looking for a place to hide - we can already hear police sirens, on their way to investigate the grisly scene on the street. Hammer boosts me up into the HVAC system so I can head down to the basement for a look-see, then she and Coltrane duck into a hotel room to lay low.

Around this time, Fury calls our Mr. Johnson to report our problems so far and ask for some advice. Things get heated, and Johnson ultimately reveals his true identity - he's Caravaggio's other son, and this score is supposed to be his way out of the family business. And now *he's* on his way down, to ""clean up this mess."" Then the line is dead, and when Fury calls back, there's no answer.

This is a bit of a game change, of course - but there's still the money up for grabs, and there's no reason not to go for it. Besides, now if things really go south, we've got an ace in the hole. With no loyalty to Caravaggio the elder or younger, we're free to sell either out to the other if we have to. With all this new shit in mind, I climb down the vent system to the basement.

The room the money's being held in is pretty small. A wooden table just below my vent is overflowing with credsticks - it's hard to count how much is there - and on he other side of the room is the elevator door. Between them, eight mooks with submachine guns. There's no way I can take 'em by myself, but four would be no problem. If a distraction drew half the group away, we'd be home-free... and we just happen to have arranged for one.

After a run-in with some young street thugs earlier in the week, we ended up coercing them into being part of our plan. We would arm them (and let them keep breathing) if they'd come in at the end of the party and make some noise. They're due at 2:30 AM. The time comes...

And goes, without incident. We get the leader of this ragtag band on the phone and he basically tells us he's terrified of the mob, even more scared of us, and he's getting the hell out of town. He doesn't know we're tracking his commlink, but we'll deal with that later. Right now, we need a new diversion.

Fury has the right idea: Under the table he's sitting at, he slips a flashbang out of his pocket, sets the timer for 20 seconds, drops the thing and walks away casually.

I can hear the bang from my position on the floor below, and Hammer and Coltrane, who have moved to the second floor, can feel the building shake beneath them. But the mooks aren't moving for the elevator. They look apprehensive, but only knot up tighter around the money on the table. 

So I don't have my distraction, and backup may or may not be on the way. But I've always been a do-it-yourself kind of guy anyway. I kick open the vent and drop a frag grenade into the room. The way I figure, the guys guarding the money must be the most dedicated. One of them will see the grenade, throw himself on it to protect his boss's investment, and while he's dying and the rest are distracted, I'll swing down and shoot a few in the back before they know what's going on.

But of course all of them fail their perception checks, and the grenade rolls right up to one thug's boot without anyone even noticing it. A few scant seconds later, a deafening explosion rocks the room, leaving the wooden table in splinters and killing four of the thugs instantly. I drop out of the vent with my shotgun ready, pumping two barrels of razor-sharp flechettes into the two mobsters nearest me. The other two are still drawing their guns when the elevator door opens and Coltrane, ever punctual, calmly places a bullet from his revolver in each of their heads.

Our victory is short-lived, though, as we survey the room. Most of the credsticks were obliterated or at least made unusable in the explosion; we'd be lucky if we could scrape together 1000 nuyen out of what's left on the floor. We've also just thrown out any slim chance we had of a quiet exit. A look of near-panic passes between Coltrane and I for a moment. I pull out my ever-present pint of whiskey, take a long pull, and offer it to my accomplice. Lighting a cigarette, I let out a long plume of smoke.

""Fuck it,"" I say, ""Let's kill everybody.""

1367502053.0,51,self.gametales,1djsuk,[Shadowrun] A Heist Becomes a Stickup (X-post /r/rpg),58,7,6,http://www.reddit.com/r/gametales/comments/1djsuk/shadowrun_a_heist_becomes_a_stickup_xpost_rrpg/,"OK, so one of the guys in our group is running Shadowrun for us, first experience any of us have ever had with the system.

The team is assembled by a mysterious woman who calls herself Orange. She introduces us to ""Mr. Johnson,"" who tells us about an upcoming, Mafia-sponsored ""charity"" gala. There will be gambling, and lots of high rollers in attendance, which means a safe full of loot by the end of the night.

The team consists of Mule, a Dwarf biker and former cage fighter (played by me); Fury, a fast-talking Elven conman and Bliss junkie; Coltrane, a high-tech Elven drug dealer (and Fury's Bliss supplier); Hammer, a human hacker who worships the Norse pantheon; Grimm, a Cajun Orc shaman; and Dom, a dim-witted Troll day-laborer-turned-Adept.

We check into our hotel across the street from the big event a few days in advance, to case the joint and ensure a smooth in-and-out on the big night.

Obviously, this is where things start to go awry. Hammer is captured at one point, necessitating a rescue, and three different excursions to the mob-controlled building result in seven or eight dead mooks. I do a hasty, vague frame-up job on the Yakuza (cutting off the dead men's pinkies and carving Kanji characters on their foreheads), but obviously there's going to be increased security for the gala.

The team manages to KO the mob security chief (he's staying in our hotel) and find detailed blueprints and tactical plans in his hotel room. Of course, he saw some of our faces before he went down, so we also hack a suicide note into his comm and purposely OD him on half a bottle of bliss from Coltrane's stash.

So things aren't ideal, but we make it to party night and we know exactly what to expect. Dom waylays a couple on their way to the party and ""liberates"" the RFID chips from inside their palms, allowing Fury to enter through the front door, along with a facechanging mage NPC who's proven very useful so far. Meanwhile, Grimm levitates Coltrane, Hammer and I onto the roof of the building.

Thanks to our previous excursions, we know the ladder on the roof descends down a single shaft straight to a first-floor maintenance closet. From the closet, there's a backdoor to the outside world, and a staircase down to the boiler room. In the boiler room is the safe, a few guards, and two automated turret guns (previously hacked by our team). The idea is, our buddies inside the party let us know when enough credsticks have moved to the safe, I get the two techies down to the boiler room by any means necessary, they hack the (old &amp; outdated) safe, we take the loot and run. Sounds easy, right? Hell, we might even be able to do this without leaving any bodies behind.

Right.

So I creep down the ladder to see if the coast is clear, and naturally the backdoor is open, with two mooks standing just inside it, facing out. Hammer creeps down behind me and hacks one guy's comm, forging a message telling him to get his ass around front pronto. Meanwhile, I crouch in the corner behind them, silenced SMG pointed at their backs just in case. Mook #1 gets the message and tears ass around the side of the building. It's working. Just have to get rid of Mook 2, close and lock the door, and we've got a little time to scope out the area before we have to act later...

And that's when Mook 2 just happens to turn his head. And see a dwarf in a leather duster with an Ingram Smartgun leveled at his chest.
There's no choice to be made here. I perforate the fool before he has a chance to cry out. But now, here we are. I close and lock the door, but someone will want to get in here eventually. The maintenance closet is covered in gore, there's a dead Mafioso at our feet, we have no idea whatsoever what's around the corner and down the stairs, and the only other way out of the room is a fourteen-story ladder.

Still... our ""party crashers"" are armed, and so am I. Dom and Grimm are standing by in case things go south and we need more firepower. And I am just about on the verge of saying ""fuck it,"" going on a kill-crazy rampage, and holding the entire party up for everything they've got. It's not the way our employer saw it going down, but hey - if we get the loot, we get our cut.

Next week, I'll tell you all about how we (presumably) got unceremoniously slaughtered.

1365278353.0,50,self.gametales,1bt96w,AAAKUUUU! [D&amp;D],58,8,8,http://www.reddit.com/r/gametales/comments/1bt96w/aaakuuuu_dd/,"So a couple years ago, a friend of mine was running a really, ridiculously huge game of D&amp;D 3.5. I mean, gigantic. He and another person were co-DMing out of necessity, because the man had roughly a dozen people crammed into his basement, and any time a fight broke out in-game, it became a nightmare with trying to keep everything straight.

But, it was sort of a one-time-only thing, done as a special event. He invited me to come join, and as much as I like roleplaying, I get a little iffy about it when more than four or five people are playing. So I said to him, ""Okay, I'll join, but on one condition:

You let me play as Samurai Jack.""

For some baffling reason, he agreed. I rolled up the character sheet that night and prepared.

Now, for any of you who may not know, Samurai Jack is the protagonist of a cartoon of the same name that aired in the early 2000s on Cartoon Network; it's [about a samurai](http://0.tqn.com/d/animatedtv/1/0/g/1/SamJackVert.jpg) who gets sent to the future by an [evil shapeshifting demon wizard named Aku](http://fc00.deviantart.net/fs70/i/2010/169/6/1/Aku_by_Mystic_Forces.jpg), who takes over the world and turns it into a dystopia, and Jack spends most of the series trying to get back to his own time and stop Aku, while being a complete badass.

The DM asked me to justify Jack being in this particular setting, which I wrote off fairly easily as that Jack has finally found a way to go back in time, but he doesn't go back to the *right* time, and is still looking for a way to return home. Simple enough.

For the most part, the game went fairly well. I did my level best to stay in character as a stoic samurai who always helps people in need. The real turning point was when we became trapped in some sort of a death-maze engineered by a mad artificer.

We ended up coming to the chamber where the artificer was lying in wait for us, after we had escaped his various traps and golems, and Jack went through the door first. The GM described to us: ""You see a squat, gnomish figure standing in the middle of the chamber before you; his skin is jet black, with hair of almost fiery red. He calls out to you, shouting, 'So! Someone has finally bested the machinations of Ahkoo--'""

At which point, Jack flies into a rage, bellows ""AKU!"", and draws his sword. Combat begins.

Now, obviously this gnome is not Jack's archenemy, he just has a similar name and appearance. Jack refuses to accept this, at all, and is doing his very best to kill the perceived Aku. The rest of the party has joined in on the fight, and it becomes an epic showdown, with Ahkoo using his technology to fight, relying on his rocket boots in particular to stay out of the range of the melee characters for most of the battle.

In a last-ditch effort to deal some real damage to Ahkoo, Jack has everyone who can help out do so. The druid uses Stone Shape to create a crude stone ramp in the chamber, which Jack makes a running leap off of, onto the shoulders of the party barbarian, who our sorcerer had cast Fly on. A second leap off of the barbarian, and Jack attempts to deliver an attack in midair, again shouting, ""AAAAKUUUUUUU!""

""Okay, roll to hit.""

Nat 20.

""Uh... confirm the crit...""

Everyone gathers around to watch the Roll of Destiny.

Nat. Fucking. 20.

The DM reaches into a bag of dice, pulls one out, and hands it to me, saying, ""Okay... roll this instead of damage, just for fun."" The die, as it turns out, has listed body parts instead of numbers, and I rolled ""left leg.""

The DM ruled that Jack had cut straight through Ahkoo's leg as he tried to dodge the strike, and the loss of that leg destabilized the artificer's rocket boots, sending him spiraling out of control to become a stain on the floor.

After the battle, when everyone was dividing up the spoils of war, they looked around to find that Jack had mysteriously left to continue his journey.

My personal favourite so far who will probably remain so until the end of time.

This story speak of Etur Templerampart the Flickering Amazement of Temptation the Ex-Swordsdwarf.

Now, I say Ex-Swordsdwarf because, due to fights, this unfortunate individual lost both of his arms. And both of his legs. And an eye.

He wasn't quite well trained enough when he lost his first arm, he was the first to reach a minotaur with others far behind. As for the second, I believe he lost it in an ambush along with his right eye.

I've no recollection as to where he lost his legs. Perhaps they walked off. Huehue. (Sorry.)

So, as you can imagine, I considered dropping Etur, but I felt that it would be more proper to try and get him killed. Etur, of course, didn't warm up to this idea and slowly became a legendary biter. Goblins and kobolds and elves fell to his teeth, shearing fingers, eyes and legs with equal abandon.

If a dwarf could have their teeth put on the artifact list, I'm sure they would've. Of course, the life of a quadruple amputee isn't a long one, but it is apparently fulfilling.

Etur died not ten minutes ago, and I felt that I had to write it down, somewhere, so that someone might remember him.

He died with his jaws around a Forgotten Beast, he successfully rolled into a fight, grabbed the throat of this ceratopsid within his mighty jaws and shook his head off before breathing his last due to poison vapours. It is with this beast that Etur marked his 100th notable kill.

Goodbye Etur. If ever there was someone who deserved my steel sarcophagus artifact, it was you. The world is worse off without you, but the afterlife is about to get a lot more bite marks.

This is the tale of my resilient companion in masterwork dwarf fortress adventure mode. For simplicity lets call him Jake. 


I was playing my first ever successful adventure mode as a human vampire. I made the mistake of hiring a human axe guard, Jake.  I quickly realized I hated Jake. Everywhere I went he stole the important kills. I needed those if I ever wanted to have my weapon named. I was a good guy so I wasn't about to kill him, but there was no option to ditch him either. So I decided to help Jake meet his doom. 

This proved tougher than I expected. I lead him to bandit camps he slaughters them. Drakes? Slays them. Perilous rivers? He fords them. He even slayed a minotaur while one of his legs was broken!

Still frustrated from my failures, I accepted a quest to kill a bandit leader located in the catacombs of a human city. Finding them proved no problem. I was determined to get this kill! So I tried to rush the bandit leader before Jake could. The bandit leader, not wanting to meet his demise, attempted to shoot me with a javelin launcher. I dodged somehow. Then I see the text I had been waiting for. Jake had been standing behind me and the javelin had pierced his helmet and lodged in his outer brain. I knew he was a goner. No one could survive that! But the rng had other plans. I finish off the leader only to be greated with the shock of my life. Jake simply removed the steel javelin and droppes it at my feet. I am still convinced that he has no hope for survival so I make my way back up to the surface. Jake follows, in pain passing out repeatedly but doggedly holding on to life. I actually feel sorry for him. 

Now on the surface, Jake passed out on the stairs I choose to sleep to heal my wounds. When I wake I plan on attempting to kill a dragon to give this npc a kings burial on a mound of treasure.

I awoke a few hours later to find Jake. Still alive! Battered and bruised but somehow not dead. It was at that moment I realized that this npc was unkillable. How I don't know, but this was no average npc. 

To this day I have yet to die and neither has Jake. So my goal is to rid this world of evil with my companion. If I can only figure out how to reach the circus...

Each of the three characters had a different reason for coming to a small USA Canada border town; one was hunting down Bigfoot rumors, one was a new hire at a google-like company, and one was hired to kill the head of the google-like company.

Thinking the killer player was going to study his subject before he took action I allowed him to follow the subject until he parked his car at a steak house.  The player then says, ""Okay, I'm going to get a bomb I made out of the trunk and put it under his car.""

Seeing my plans about to go up in flames I suddenly thought, ""Where the hell did you get a bomb?!""

The player tried to convince me he would have built it before he left for the job a few hundred miles away.  After declaring that that was far too impractical for him to do that he said, ""Fine, I built it in my hotel room."" So we retcon back.

One of my models went above and beyond the call of duty, defeating impossible odds. I lost, but this one model won me the moral victory, and earned a personal name and an identifying new paint job for his efforts. This is his story.

The gametype was relic, a capture the flag type map where two armies race to recover and hold a central objective. 

I played Necrons. I was short on models that day, and fielded only a single squad of 10 warriors, who would run out to capture the relic, and an elite squad made up of an Overlord (my general); 5 Crypteks (techno-mage, kinda); and a single lord (baby overlord). These were my heavy hitters, my A-Team.

My opponent was the Imperial Guard. He brought overwhelming numbers, 2 squads of 5 Kasrkins (Marines), 2 of 20 Guardsmen (basic infantry), and most importantly 3 tanks. I could tell at a single glance I would lose this, I was outnumbered 3 to 1. This didn't matter I thought, screw the relic and screw winning. If I can just destroy those tanks before I get wiped out, I'll count this a victory.

We fought hard, and both sides scored telling blows. With a single blast from his staff one of my Crypteks totaled a powerful tank, and the next turn the command squad came under heavy fire from the enemy forces. When the smoke cleared the entire squad was sprawled on the ground, but the Cryptek who killed the tank and the Lord both managed to pull themselves to their feet, the powerful Necrons healing instantly, their living metal skin flowing back into shape.

They charged the second main battle tank, the Cryptek glancing it with another burst from his staff and the lord heroically diving in and beating the odds to score two telling blows against the machine with his warscythe. That's two tanks completely wrecked in as many turns. The jubilation was short lived however, as behind the battered warriors the last enemy vehicle, an APC, disgorged it's contents. An entire squad of guardsmen, 20 angry scared and well armed men.

The Lord and the Cryptek looked around them. 20 men on the roof of the nearby building, 20 in a firing line at 12 o'clock, a heavy transport tank festooned with large guns looming behind said firing line. All in all 50 guns capable at this range of 96 shots in a turn were leveled at my brave men. They resolved to sell their lives dearly, and charged at the APC.

The Cryptek got off one last shot, immobilizing the APC before being shot directly between the eyes with an armor piercing round from the roof. This time, he didn't get back up. The Lord charged through the firing line, taking shot after shot. In total 70 laser blasts, 19 armor piercing bullets, and 5 plasma blasts were fired at him. 56 hit. None brought this mighty champion down. His armored body held against blast after blast, cratered and pockmarked, as he staggered towards the APC. He was determined to take this last tank down with him, and fulfill his dead overlord's true objective. The enemy grew desperate, throwing grenades, launching a missile, and even firing a powerful antitank weapon, a meltagun, at my Lord. Nothing worked. When his armor proved too light to withstand the meltagun's blast the Lord's phase shifter flickered into life, allowing the beam of pure heat energy to pass harmlessly through him. He was unstoppable.

The lord reached the tank and raised his warscythe, raining blows down on the helpless machine. It's thick armor was helpless to withstand his desperate, stubborn strength and it caved, the warscythe crunching through into the inner workings of the vehicle and striking the fuel tank in two. The tank exploded with a deafening blast, peppering the Lord and the nearby guardsmen with shrapnel. One piece from the explosion struck the lord in a weak spot of his brutalized armor and impaled him. He fell on that battlefield a hero, withstanding a literal army to complete the job he was sent to do. I never attempted his resurrection roll, it didn't seem right.

After the Lord fell my defeat was certain, and I went home the loser, but in high spirits. The Lord has a name now, Leonidas, and a [bright red crest](http://i.imgur.com/KndsHFl.jpg) as recognition for his prowess. He'll always be my first pick for a frontline lord in future.

We loved to ruin the economy and mess with people while staying within the rules. So, naturally we went to play as Mafia members. With guns that had ammo.

I should explain this abit more, we went Mafia because they can mug people for up to 500RMK. (Reich marks.) Now, as we are armed to the teeth and starting on our journey towards the places SS don't go, we encounter a SS. He stared at us and we stared at him. ""Seig heil!"" comes from Zejan and we move on.

Once in deep slums as it is coined, we spot our first victim. A naiive level 5. We apporach, he stops, we pull out pistols and tell him to give us 500RMK or die, he does, we move on and recruit another Mafia member with us. This process repeats until we have the other 3 Mafia with us and the boss.

At this point we realized we were strong, as in stronger than the entire Reich. Plus, two of the other Mafia guys knew the current Fuhrer, so we could go in and out of the Reich as we pleased. That was when we made our move. We helped the resistance.

We got them into the Reich and they killed the Fuhrer while we waited. Then, our Mafia leader rose into the power as the Fuhrer. We ran the Reich for a while, then our guy was killed, so we disbanded. It is still one of my favorite memorys.

The stories I love most are the ones that aren't screenshots from 4chan, but actual first-hand accounts by /r/gametales subscribers. It would be great to get a strong community of people actually telling their own stories.

You don't need to be a good writer, or have a perfect command of the english language. As long as an effort is made toward decent english (punctuation, spelling, etc), I'll upvote it.

While we're on the subject, I would also love to see more tales that aren't necessarily DnD/Tabletops. Don't get me wrong, I love those stories, but there are great stories to be had in videogames like Dwarf Fortress, Minecraft, EVE, and even more mainstream games like XCOM.

1373994980.0,45,self.gametales,1ifb1o,[GURPS] Bringing down the house,49,4,1,http://www.reddit.com/r/gametales/comments/1ifb1o/gurps_bringing_down_the_house/,"Before I ever played my first game of GURPS a friend told me this story.  It's what got me interested in the system to begin with.  Some of the details evade me, as it's been 10 years since I heard the story, but I'll do the best I can.  This was an ultra-tech campaign taking place around 3000 AD.

**Backstory** *- skip if you don't care*

For 70 years the world was locked in perpetual war.  A generation long World War that touched every nation on Earth and left many in ashes and ruin.  Those that were lucky enough to possess the technology were able to shoot down the nuclear warheads that were launched.  For those nations that could not, they ceased to exist.  Finally tired of the death, the leaders of all the remaining nations gathered to find peace.  There must still be conflict, it is the way of the world, but something must be done to spare the populace.

The Robot Wars were born.

Conflicts between nations are now decided by a contest blending the best technology and men each nation can provide.  Individual battles take place at the behest of two nations vying for the same resources, or to respond to a slight, or for any of the myriad reasons nations used to use to declare war.

In addition to this there is also The Tournament, held once every ten years.  All the nations compete in single elimination combat until only one remains, who wins the ability to appoint the head of the World Peace Union for the next cycle.  This position grants great power to alter the rules of the Robot Wars, and is therefore heavily contested by all nations.

**Now to the actual story**

There were 5 players to the game, each playing some role within a nation's robot fighting team.  These weren't 'Real Steel' type robots, but more like Mechs or Gundams.  They each had a pilot, a support crew and a promoter.  Most players chose to play the pilots, but not all.

One pilot in particular fought for the Japanese, and he was an absolute dick.  Not the player himself, who was an amazing roleplayer, but just the character.  He was cocky, sarcastic, and talked down to anyone he thought was inferior to him; which was basically everyone.

Another character that was played was the mechanic/tech support for the Canadian team.  This character was a literal genius programmer and also the foremost hacker in the world.

The setting is the quarterfinal party, where everyone even remotely involved in The Tournament that year has been invited and is all dressed up.  The four mechs still participating in The Tournament are standing outside the mansion in combat poses to give everyone a preview of the upcoming fights.  One of those mechs belongs to the Japanese team.

The Japanese pilot is being his usual dick self at the party, talking down to people and generally pissing everyone off.  The person most pissed off, however, is the Canadian mechanic.  His team was knocked out in the second round by the Japanese so he's already mad at them.  Added to that is the fact that the mechanic has just learned that the Japanese pilot is utilizing a Neural Interface that's been permanently implanted in his brain.  This allows him to control his mech by thought, and is also a technology expressly forbidden by the rules of The Tournament.

The Canadian player knows he can easily get the Japanese disqualified with this information, but that's not enough for him.  He wants to embarrass the Japanese pilot so thoroughly that he'll never be allowed to pilot again.  So in the middle of the party the Canadian player hacks into the Japanese fight system and activates their pilot's neural interface.  What the player didn't know, however, is that the Japanese's neural interface only controlled the weapons system on their mech.

The rest of the session went like this:

Random party guest: 'This is a nice party, isn't it?'

Japanese pilot: 'Yeah right, they should just level this place and get it over with.'


At which point two ballistic missiles are fired off the shoulder pack of the Japanese mech outside the mansion, aimed for its' structural weak points.

Everyone dies, because not only are the explosions causing the building to collapse, but these happen to be **Hellfire** Ballistic Missiles.  So while the entire building collapses, sending rubble tumbling down from the sky, there is also a lake of molten fire running to every point inside the mansion.

The team, over the course of the session, pursue him all across Corsuscant before finally running him down and corner him and his droid. It is here that he reveals he claims he was a smuggler, and his indefinite cryo-sentence was either a conspiracy or a simple mistake. The team, after some debate, decide to simply turn him over to the authorities and let them sort it out.

The second session finds the group on a moon near Coruscant refueling their ship. When they go to leave, they discover that their identification module which allows them to enter and leave port has gone missing. Incensed at the audacity of someone to steal from such fearsome warriors, they begin a ruthless (by Jedi standards, at least) campaign to recover the identification module before the thief flees the planet with it.

1368694706.0,50,self.gametales,1efw5v,[EVE Online] Thievery and Torpedo's - A story about a stolen freighter and a destroyed carrier,67,17,12,http://www.reddit.com/r/gametales/comments/1efw5v/eve_online_thievery_and_torpedos_a_story_about_a/,"This story happened at the end of January 2012.

We were a medium sized corporation living in 'wormhole space'.

Wormhole space is something special in EVE.
Where normal solar systems are connected by stargates; wormhole space is not.
It is (obviously) connected by wormholes.

Wormholes spawn at a random location, lead to a random destination and have a maximum lifetime of 16 or 24 (most common) hours.
Next to that, they are limited by the size of the ship that can travel trough them and limited by the total amount of mass that can travel trough them.
At the end of their timer or when the maximum mass is reached, a wormhole will collapse.

Now wormhole space solar systems have next to the random spawning wormholes also one or more 'static wormholes'.
Static wormholes allways lead to the same class destination, not the same system. And just like other wormholes, they will spawn in random locations.

Wormhole space classes in general scale from C1 to C6 in size, where a C6 has the most dangerous and deadly PvE content in the game and a C1 can be lived in by fairly new players.

We lived in a C5 wormhole, with a C5 static. This means that our static wormhole would allways lead to another C5 if we wanted a way in or out.
Getting ships, fuel, ammo and other resources in and materials, harvested minerals and gasses and other stuff out was a time consuming and tendentious task.
We would need someone to probe down our static wormhole (and possible other random holes that connected from our space into others, or incoming wormholes), open it, check if the other side was safe for traveling trough and continue probing there if it was, until we had a route to 'normal space' and we could fly in and out our stuff.

Recently I checked my old mails on one of my EVE Online accounts from that time, and found nummerous shopping lists for stuff that certain players needed. We would often mail everyone about stuff we needed or store it in a central place (forum, etc) so others could take note of that and bring it in when we were sleeping and they found a viable route.

So, one day; we had a wormhole to nullsec space.
Now in 'normal space' in EVE, there are 'security levels' in each solar system (in wormholes it's allways -1.0, the lowest you can have).

The security level of a system tells you how much NPC police (CONCORD and regional navy) involvement there is.
There is 'highsec' space (0.5 - 1.0), 'lowsec' space (0.1-0.4) and 'nullsec' space (-1.0 - 0.0).

After wormhole space, nullsec space is one of the most dangerous areas of the game, and it's where the big alliances roam around, fight over system control and protect their precious resources.
To get an idea, [all colored space on this map is nullsec](http://go-dl.eve-files.com/media/corp/Verite/influence.png) and owned by various alliances.
The rest is either nullsec owned by NPC's, lowsec or highsec space.

Now this nullsec space we connected to was owned by SOLAR WING. A quite big Russian alliance, part of a bigger Russian coalition holding - at that time - a massive part of nullsec space (they recently lost all or almost all of their space). Thanks to them being almost completely Russian, time was on our side (in Russia it would have been something around 5:02 in the night, depending on location - I believe Russia has multiple timezones) and there was only one other player in the system.

We scouted the system and found an online control tower (a player build structure that acts as a base - [example image of another tower here](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/11684856/EVE/c5/pos0001.PNG)).
Inside this tower were 3 things that catched our interest. A Russian player that, according to his profile, had the appropiate roles to configure the control tower, but seemed fairly new. A Nidhoggur, wich is a carrier class ship of the Minmatar race and a Charon, wich is a freighter of the Caldari race.

We decided to play around with him a bit. The control tower seemed to have no defences at all so we decloaked a stealth bomber and flew at high speed into the forcefield, trying to reach one of the big ships in a hope to bump them a bit out.

Offcourse this did not work for a number of reasons. The stealth bomber was much to small, the ships were far inside the forcefield and we bumped off at high speed and returned.

The player inside the forcefield on the other hand got scared. He must have had the idea that we had the rights to enter his forcefield, because he changed the control tower settings to not allow any members inside at all.

This had a couple of results. He was bumped out, and once he realized his mistake he instantly logged off. But also the Charon and the Nidhoggur were bumped out. They flew off at a very high speed, without a player controlling them in it.

After some discussion we decided to probe down the Charon and steal it. I was the only capable Charon pilot back then, and one of my other corp members was our specialist in probing. He found the ship while it was still moving at over 3000 m/s; unable to catch up fast enough to get into it.

He kept flying behind it until it came to an almost stop. I warped to him, entered the Charon, warped to our wormhole entrance, jumped in and stored it in our starbase. First 900m ISK (the price of freighers back then, now they are around 1.4b) in the pocket.

Next we had the Nidhoggur. What to do with it?
We had no pilot able to fly the thing (one of our members was one week off) and leaving it here someone could find and board it or the Russians could come and recover it. We decided to destroy it and take the loot that it would drop.

With a bunch of random ships we [destroyed the Nidhoggur](http://zkillboard.com/detail/-310185/) and stole the loot wich had a total value of around 250m ISK, giving us a total of over 1.1b.

On our trip back to our wormhole, it became unstable because of all the mass that traveled trough. We decided to jump our biggest battleship back in as the latest ship, and the wormhole collapsed behind him. No trails left behind.

Now this was nice, but more imporant, it was our first carrier kill; and when looking at the killmail, you could not tell if there was someone in it or not. It gave us bragging rights for months towards the rest of the alliance / corporation.

A year later we happened to join a rivaling Russian alliance, and this carrier kill with a bunch of random not-really-suitable ships was impressive enough to help us inside, especially because it was their bigest enemy.

We never heard about this incident again, but I can only imagine that the fairly new member living in that tower was scared for losing his position. By logging off and warning noone, he might have saved himself and noone might have found out what happened - until someone reads this and remembers missing his carrier.

As allways in EVE, little actions can have quite big consequences - and this time in our favor.

Fly safe o7

This week is Pathfinder. The limitations for characters were:

Fifth level

No class limitations

Reasonable inventory

I decided to have a little fun, so I decided to create a Barbarian grizzly bear, using the Awakened Template. My stats were nuts, so I ended up being Grizzly Bear (LA 4)/Barbarian 1 who focused on grappling. The rules themselves were bent a little (probably a lot), but it was a one-shot and with a guy who never ran something very seriously...thus, Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson, the BarBearian was born.

The party:

Dwayne

Traegazz, a gnome barbarian

Big-Mouthed Bart, the mute dwarven barbarian

Ungar, the human Smashing barbarian

Krug and Liberace, the Ogrekyn barbarian couple

Rhokar, the human monk (he didn't get the memo about rolling barbarian)

So we're breaking our way out of a pirate ship and rolling some pretty tight face when we reach the deck and start the climactic battle. Dwayne, seeing a cannon, and seeing that the boss was on the upper wheel deck, loads himself into the cannon and has the fuse lit.

Turns out the cannon was loaded, and Dwayne forgot to adjust the cannon's angle.

I end up being shot into the foredeck, closely followed by a cannonball, dealing 10d10 damage. With my previous wounds, it splattered Dwayne and obliterated the foredeck.

Of battle, betrayal, conquest and perseverance in the face of incredible odds.

The setting: Dark Ages. A brutal time of pestilence, struggle and war.
The land: Black Forest. A twisted hellish maze of trees and roots, dark rivers, and darker wings.
The players: Me(Celts), Green(Mongols), Orange(Britons).
The enemies: Purple(Koreans), Blue(Huns), Yellow(Franks).

The game started as any other, my peasants moved to block strategic passes in the dark forest with palisade walls, while my scout secured sheep and berry resources for harvesting. My people were hardy and strong, used to battle. But it had taken its toll on us. We were weary and sought peace from out neighbors to the North and West. And for time, peace was had. Crops flourished, lumber was felled, and a small town grew. 

The Feudal age came, and my city flourished. I began trading with my allies to the South, the Mongols, and further South, the Britons. The British were a fidgety bunch, unwilling to share their land with the Mongols and I. The audacity of their King, he walled off his lands and locked his gates. If war ever came, I knew we could not count on their help. He was a peacock, content to build his walls and pray for the best. This is a harsh land, and only the strong survive.

The Castle age came quickly. The alliance with my Mongol neighbors flourished, while there was no sign of allegiance from the British. Luckily, there were yet no hostilities from the other tribes in the area. My scouts did however notice the construction of several fortifications along our Northern Border. I felt this was an bad omen and ill portent and began massing Knights, the pride of my nobility. My siege was quite powerful and I constructed several workshops as a safeguard against encroachment from my Northern Korean neighbors. I noticed that the Mongol Horde was also on the move, scouting the forests and running into several impressive fortifications. The British however kept building walls, thinking that would protect them from the onslaught of Hunnish Cavalry and Frankish Siege rams.

I knew conflict was coming. My scouts disappeared. I stockpiled food, gold, wood and stone. 

The Imperial age finally arrived, and in grand fashion. WAR. The south was ablaze. The British gates and walls toppled in mere minutes, and a flood of Paladins, Tartans and Horse Archers poured into the city. The sacking was violent, brutal and final. Before the Mongols could even mobilize, the British refugees streamed into Mongolia and sought safety. The Southern city was lost, and the Southern flank was compromised. The Mongols mobilized, and somehow stabilized the frontier.

It was time to take this war North, and put pressure on the Koreans. My siege engines began assailing their impressive walls with boulders. But the Koreans were prepared. Bombard cannons and towers rained cannonballs upon my machines, shattering them into dust and splinters. I knew the lost of life would be too great if I sent my troops against that wall of fiery death. I needed a new plan. Luckily my scouts found a thin line of trees far to the North, that if destroyed provided a back door into the Korean City. I moved my troops to the Northern frontier, blasted a hole in the woods with Siege Onagers, and streamed 100 brave Paladins into the Korean City. The fight was brutal. 

In the South, the Mongolians had managed to quell the advance of the Hunnish Calvary with their own horde of Camel warriors. The Franks were mercilessly killed in the narrow confines of the wooded corridors, and the British, well they farmed and walled in a small refugee camp between my land and the Mongolian city.

My troops poured through the breach. Paladins, Heavy Scorpions, Siege Rams and Onagers, Halberdiers by the hundreds. The pressure was now on the Koreans, and his defensive wall could not stop me if I did not attack it from the front. I moved my peasants in to the rear of his base to construct more stables and barracks. The Franks came to his aid with heavy horse and infantry, but my troops cut them to shreds. An uneasy stalemate was reached. Gold supplies were dwindling on both sides, and cheap garbage troops were being fed into the meat grinder. Every trebuchet and Paladin was protected from harm. An hour or a decade passed with no movement on either side. Every inch of land was won and lost with battalions of skirmishers and halberdiers.

I feared this war would drag on forever, until something terrible happened which shook my faith forever. A troop of Frankish horse broke through the Mongolian defenses and ravaged our trade lines. The gold supply instantly dried up, and I felt defeat was near. The British refugee camp was burnt to the ground and their king committed suicide by launching himself from a trebuchet into the Frankish Calvary charge. 3 tribes versus 2. Our trade lines dried up. My farms burnt by raiders, my people losing respect for their kings. I feared the worst. 

I dispatched halberdiers and paladins south to defeat the Frankish army. With the help of the Mongols, we drove them out. We rebuilt. Trade flowed again. The coffers filled up, the farms were replants and the fortification shored up. I felt a surge of confidence. I sent a message to the Mongols. ""Hold the South. I will destroy the Koreans. Than we will pincer them."" I had faith that the Mongol camels and archers would hold the frontier. 

With renewed vigor, my troops poured into the Korean city. The Franks couldn't help now, their army decimated from the raid. My hussars systematically destroyed their trade carts and markets, my Woad raiders killed their villagers, my halberdiers protected my siege while I laid waste to their castles and town centers. Finally my rams destroyed their defensive walls and cannon towers. The Korean city was burnt to ashes. I claimed their land and relics, fortified the ruins of the city, and rebuilt my army yet again. The Korean leader, Kim Jong Ill, well him, I had executed by Scorpion strike. 

Just as I felt a positive upsurge in our war, the South erupted in flames yet again. Hundreds of horse and siege attacked my allies. I sped south with peasants to build stables in his land. We marshaled another army of paladins and halberdiers and once again defeated the combined invasive might of the Franks and Huns. Once again, our trade was decimated. But we built it up, and again the gold flowed. 

I sent another message to the Mongols. ""Attack through the middle, and I will attack from the North. We will crush the Franks.""
And so we did...

Line upon line of camel and siege ram rolled through the wooded corridors, destroying one gate and castle after another. I marched my armies West from the smoking ruins of old Korea until, in one fell swoop with simultaneously attacked the Frankish city. Our armies fought like Immortals, fierce warriors without fear. Walls were crumbled, charges of heavy horse broke upon our spears, and infantry fells by blasted from siege and arrow. After an hour or year of fierce hot fighting, the Frankish capital laid in ruins.He retreated South, to his last safe bastion, the former lands of the British. 

The war was well in hand. But what of the Huns? We'd soon find out. In mere moments after our victory over the Franks, a horde of Huns poured into our Southern flank. Hundreds of heavy horse, hussars, horse archers, and siege battered our gates and castles. Luckily our military base had been set up and fortified in the earlier battle, and out of the barracks poured pikeman and halberdiers, and from siege workshops beefed up siege onagers, with more stamina and speed than anything on the battlefield. 300 horse died that day, and another 500 infantry, but amidst the bloody fog and mounds of dead and dying men, our ragtag band of men stood victorious. 

The battle raged for yet more years. My armies pushed hard and fast from the South. Highly mobile raiders and siege pummeled the Hunnish capital, while Mongol Hordes attacked in waves from the East. I topped a Hunnish Wonder, and by then, I think their people had all but accepted defeated. I ordered my men to burn all the farms and homes so none of their people could grow food there again and to scout the woods for resistance and rebels. We did find a small unprotected base in the woods. It fell quickly and all were put to the sword.

All that remained was a small Frankish and Hunnish army in the lands of the British. Devoid of shelter, food or gold, they marshaled a small army of hussars and skirmishers. At this point our trade lines had filled both of our treasuries with mounds of gold. I summoned an army of paladins. 120 hardened troops. The pride of Celtish nobility. Battle tested. Armed and equipped in the best steel arms and armor. I commanded them, ""Go South, you will find the last of the Franks and Huns. They who would kill our allies, the Mongols. They who would burn your farms and slaughter your serfs. They who would take your women. They showed you no mercy. They killed your sons and brothers and fathers. Entire generations of Celts fell upon their swords. I SAY UNTO YOU, RIDE THEM DOWN LIKE THE BRUTES THEY ARE. KILL THEM ALL."" ...And into the breach my men rode, and they destroyed everything the came upon. The war was over. My people were safe. The Mongolians, our allies were safe as well. That is, until the next war. Our neighbors to the South seemed to be fortifying our borders a little to heavily...

1371964807.0,46,self.gametales,1gw8ry,[Gmod] The War on Admins,52,6,4,http://www.reddit.com/r/gametales/comments/1gw8ry/gmod_the_war_on_admins/,"Years back, during the Gmod 10 era I frequented a RP server, I knew most of the regulars and admins and remember many events in great detail, here is one of my favourites.

It was a lazy Saturday and no one was really doing anything on the server among their normal buisness (police officers patrolling the city, and for reference the map the server always used Evocity) one of the admins online proposed we have a server event like we had done many times before, another user online replied saying that the non admins and non moderators should be made TRG (Tactical Response Group, a position that only admins and super moderators were able to bestow upon players and themselves, they started out with Flashbangs, a P90 and a Pump Action Shotgun, courtesy of Counter Strike Source) and thus, it was done.

TRG always spawned in the garage in one of the skyscrapers, from there you could leave and you'd be in the city, we left and hid behind the bank as the admins began their patrol, we were ants compared to their power, bullets would only get us so far against people who could spawn in helicopters and vehicles without having to pay, part of the fun of RP was getting a job and earning money, if you earned enough you could buy a car, but helicopters were only for admins and even they couldn't spawn them naturally.

They could also find where we were, and they did, one of the admins was ontop of the bank with an RPG, he had modified his HP and we managed to get away, but the group was split up, some ran to the power plant and some ran to the house, me included.

When we arrived at the house we found a Scout Sniper Rifle, we gave it to one of our members, as he played Counter Strike often and therefore had the most experience, from this point on, he led the pack, from the house, we began searching for the members that weren't able to make it to the house, unknown to us however, we were followed.

We searched alone, our leader called us back and we had 2 members missing, perfect, in the process of searching for other members we lost 2 of them..and then another, right infront of us, one of our members was killed, no shit!, the admin was invisible! (to clarify, there was 6 in my group and 4 that went to the power plant) one of our members shot the admin with his Shotgun, and, although the admin was invisible, the wound wasn't, and we could see him trying to escape, the same member flashbanged him and our leader finished him off with a shot from his sniper, his cloak was taken off and his dead body revealed, we began heading to the power plant, as it was our first guess.

Many questions arose from the group, will the admin stay dead?, was he followed? are the others dead? we didn't even make it to the power plant before we were attacked again, we weren't killed but we were wounded by some sort of explosion. the others, hearing the explosion, rushed to our aid and shot in every direction, we didn't know what we were shooting at but it did by us enough time to get into a KFC store, we boarded up the entrances and hid behind the counter.

A floating bomb no clipped its way inside the KFC (in reality it was being held by an admin) and was set and dropped before we could kill the admin, it exploded, killing me and my group, and 2 others from the group that got split up, leaving only 2 surviving members, one turned on the other as he was seen as an obstacle because he was wounded and the last surviver tried to make an escape, but was shot down. You want a happy ending? there simply isn't, we were fools thinking we could fight those who controlled our fate.

In reality, it was all in good fun, but taken out of context, it was pretty morbid.

1371333766.0,46,self.gametales,1gf6gf,[D&amp;D 4th Edition] How I managed to get my entire party killed in a series of unfortunate events.,59,13,15,http://www.reddit.com/r/gametales/comments/1gf6gf/dd_4th_edition_how_i_managed_to_get_my_entire/,"I was DMing a party consisting of a deva cleric, a halfling rogue, a shifter warden, a tiefling warlock, and a genasi swordmage. They worked pretty well together, and seemed to be good friends (other than the halfling, who, after burning a house full of the king's spies, dropped to evil, though he tried to redeem himself, and the warlock, who pretty much the entire party disliked). What was going on was they were in the Shadowfell, retrieving a phylactery from the Cult of Torog. They had ended up in one of the Cult's temples and fought several monsters. When they got to the second floor, I had them fight a gargantuan sized Zombie Hulk (if anybody here has ever played Timesplitters 2, think of the huge demon in Notre Dame). They actually beat it fairly easily, but the rogue was killed after he was crushed by the zombie (which destroyed about 25% of the temple by falling). The party then set out to get Resurrection rituals.

They arrive in a city that's run by Githerzai monks. They do find some scrolls, but the gnomes who are selling them are asking for more than the price in the Player's Handbook. So, the party does some parleying to try and find common ground. At last, the gnomes offer 2,500 for both a Raise Dead ritual and an Open Portal ritual. The party is about to seal the deal, but then the Genasi Swordmage offers 10,000. The gnomes accept the offer, but the party says NO. The gnomes refuse to accept any offer other than the Swordmage's, and the party decides to use the Swordmage's money instead of splitting it like usual. This causes the Swordmage to become angry, and an argument to break out IRL and in-game. The Swordmage then does the following: he takes the scrolls that are their ticket home and the only way to revive their friend (who was oh, so close to redemption) and throws them into the sewer. His character storms off, going to a tavern to drink. The Warden and Warlock decide to go get the scrolls, while the cleric goes to talk to the Swordmage. Here is where death #2 of 5 occurs. The cleric finds the Swordmage in a more or less, secluded area of the city, and is attacked by his friend in an instant. It was a no-contest, as the swordmage even beat our party's infamous power-gamer in a duel in the past, pretty badly too. Anyway, he kills the cleric in ten minutes IRL. The party in the sewers in unaware of this (the battle was run separately) and are ignorant when the Swordmage shows up alone and asks if they have the scrolls. They give them both scrolls, which they worked hard to get back, and exit the sewers. When they return, they go to find the cleric. The Swordmage then takes the scrolls and what does he do? He cuts them in half with his magical bastard sword. This causes the surviving party members to question him. At this point, he reveals he killed the cleric, and attacks the Warlock and Warden. The warlock, per request of the Warden, stays out of the fight. The Warden wins round 2 and knocks out the Swordmage, who is taken away by the monks and hung. This is the third death in the party.

The survivors begin asking around town where they could find more scrolls, and are told that a purple dragon is known for hoarding rituals. They head to the dragon's lair to retrieve them without asking for help. Now, anybody who has ever fought a purple dragon knows that they are probably one of, if not the, most powerful types of Dragons in 4th Edition. They can dominate and daze you at-will and as a minor action. They arrive to the lair and attempt to diplomacise with the dragon. It is all going well until the warlock, who is played by a guy we all know is OMEGA AS FUCK and a notorious pervert, decides to open his mouth and offer to perform fellatio and a prostate massage on the dragon. Here's the deal: I have a special rule that visual shit like that is banned from the table. It makes the players very uncomfortable, is highly unfunny, and ruins the mood of the campaign. Innuendo, sexual jokes, and even brothel visits are allowed, but this asshat decides to go into complete detail about what he will do. This causes the dragon to become annoyed, and he kills the warlock with ease. The session was pretty late in, so we called it a night and I told the Warden's player that we'd do a quick solo adventure at the New Year's Party (Alpha as Fuck).

The solo adventure starts off with my old tiefling warlock (I pretty much lead a Coup on this campaign, as the old DM, who was the Genasi, wasn't very good) showed up with an army of devils to assist the Warden. After he was ascended to the heavens by a succubi and several devil legionnaires, he was able to finish the dragon. The Warden think's he's in the clear, but not so. My Warlock is on a quest to rebuild the ancient tiefling empire, and came to the lair to collect not only funds, but magic items, including rituals. He makes a deal with the Warden: if the Warden kills the corrupt king of a country that is close to the tiefling's newly conquered land, he will revive all of the party members, excluding the cleric, who was cremated by the Swordmage, and also excluding the swordmage, for obvious reasons. The tiefling opens a portal to the Mortal World and the Warden goes through. It seems easy enough, as the king was hated by even his bodyguards and was often seen outside in his courtyard, which had plenty of places to hide and escape from. The only problem was the Warden never made it. The kingdom was about three days away by foot, and he was close to reaching level 10, so I decided to throw him an encounter to level him up. So what did I do? I made him fight a few gnolls. He was able to kill them easily, until one of them crit him six times in a row. I rolled on the table, he saw them. He was dropped to 0 hit points and fell unconscious, but the last gnoll was driven away by his Rust Monster (don't ask). At this point, he made his death saving throws. We had a house rule where if you passed 3 out of combat, you are stabilized and are no longer in danger of dying.

His rolls went as such:

17

11

8

4

9

He died on the road, with no friends to comfort or bury him. Just a rust monster that later fed on his equipment. We never finished the campaign. The entire party had, due to a foolish rogue, a poorly built cleric, an enraged swordmage, a perverted warlock, and an unlucky warden, been killed outright.",Tabletop,False,self,t5_2wqgc,False,table,,True,t3_1gf6gf,http://www.reddit.com/r/gametales/comments/1gf6gf/dd_4th_edition_how_i_managed_to_get_my_entire/,

The man was an illegitimate grandson of the rich owner of the mining town and was not invited to the grandfathers funeral, but when the rest of the family did not return to the city, Three Rivers, after a week he asked for help to find the family.

After reaching the mining town, Gorgons Ridge, the party discovered the mining operations were headed by a necromancer who used zombies &amp; skeletons to do all the work.  The family had stumbled across this and were turned into the newest employees.

The party eventually split-up, always unwise, and returned to the town hall separately.
The Elf alchemist, inventor of the pen cap, was asked to go to the main office where he was escorted to a holding cell.
The drunk mercenary was having hallucinations since he had not had a drink in a couple days and ran into the woods.
The knight and NPC, the grandson, ran after the drunk but quickly lost him.  Concerned about the Elf inventor, creator of the paper holder together metal thing, the knight and NPC attempted to sneak back into town, were caught, and placed in the holding cells.

Meanwhile the drunk, having been injured my zombies, had a moment of clarity, vowed to never drink again, and successively made his way back to town unseen.  He set the local bar on fire and made his way to the holding cells.  After killing one guard, who did not have the keys to the cells, he attempted to kill the necromancer through a door. The door was then swiftly open, weapon still embedded, and struck with a scorching ray that killed him.

The NPC was killed in his cell for being too troublesome and the Elf and Knight were brainwashed to return Three Rivers, with the necromancer, and report everything as normal.

http://www.reddit.com/r/gametales/comments/1ddke1/dd_35_the_dms_legacy_villains/

After our run in with the Cleric, the next play session began with the DM telling us that the Evil Demi-god of War (A ""level 99"" Cavalier from his younger years) was now angry with us.  Prior to the incident, the demi-god had been an overbearing patron of sorts, commanding us to do his bidding and treating us as minions.  Since we were evil, he'd send us to do evil things, like the time he sent us to some dwarven hero's tomb to desecrate it.  He taunted us with treasure there, and in an unpleasant twist, he had the dwarf's Law Good Intelligent Dancing Vorpal Greataxe +5 (I shit you not) attack us.  The only reason we survived is because I managed to trap it in a bag of holding.  Those were fun times.   
  
Anyways, after we returned from the Cleric's place, the demi-god appeared and tried to impose his will on us.  In typical fashion, Dan and I chafed at the tonguelashing, and as two level 9's told the 99 that he could shove it up his arse.  Needless to say, the demi-god was not happy, but instead of him killing us outright, he informed us that his army was en route and they were coming to destroy our castle (we loved that place &lt;//3).  
  
Dan and I began planning, away from the hearing of the DM.  Dan, the level 9 evil Blackguard (i think) and my level 9 Sorceror, didn't have much of a chance against a level 99 demi-god, or his army, it seemed.  Yet despite this, Dan and I would prefer to go out in a blaze of glory than just be bitch boys to some ass hat.  
  
&gt;DM:  On the morning of the third day, (forgot his name) arrives outside your castle gates with a small army.    
&gt;Me:  How many?  
&gt;DM: Thousands.  
&gt;Me: We wait, and watch what they do.
&gt;DM: The army begins to set up camp.  After an hour, (demi-god) appears before your walls.  ""I will give you one last chance, as you've been useful before.  Submit, be punished, and you will survive.""  
&gt;Dan: ""What punishment?""  
&gt;DM(Demi-god):  ""Thrashings, loss of lands, and whatever else I decide.  You will be my dogs, kneeling at my boots"".  
&gt;Dan: ""Yeah, that's not gonna happen.""  
&gt;DM (Demi-god): ""So be it.  You die on the morrow.""  (Demigod) turns and heads toward the camp.  
&gt;Me:  Where did he go?  
&gt;DM:  Umm, into the camp.  
&gt;Me:  Yeah, but where?  Do we see which tent he's headed to?  
&gt;DM:  *pauses a moment* Yes, a large tent that appears to be the command tent.  
  
(At this point I look at Dan and he shrugs.  We both leave the room for a minute to discuss our strategy, without the DM hearing so that he can't plan against it.  With this DM, this approach works best and he tends to let us get away with stuff if he can't take a while to talk himself out of it.  After a minute or two, we return to the table.)  

  
&gt;Me:  I wait a few minutes until I can be sure (demi-god) has entered the command tent.  
&gt;DM:  ""He's in the tent.""  
&gt;Dan:  ""I pull out our bag of holding.""  
&gt;Me:  ""I grab Dan by the shoulder and teleport us into the command tent.""
&gt;DM:  (The DM looks a bit baffled for a moment, and then laughs)  ""Congratulations!  You are in the command tent, a startled demi-god is standing on the other side of a command table, along with 9 of his commanders.  All of them freeze a second as they realize two fools have wandered into their tent.""  
&gt;Dan:  ""I open the bag of holding""
(DM still hasn't caught on to what we're up to)  
&gt;Me:  ""I use mage hand to reach into the bag, and fling the Dwarf's axe toward the Demi-god, then I teleport us back to the castle"".  
(The DM guffaws in disbelief, then laughs and breaks out the dice)  
(Dan and I with stupid grins await nervously the results, feeling very much like someone who has thrown a rock at a hornet's nest)  
(DM is grinning when he begins rolling the dice.  He rolled about 10 dice rolls, and with each roll he appeared to get more serious.  After the 10th roll, he angrily yells ""Fuck!"", then gets up and leaves the room.  Dan and I stare at eachother with disbelieving stares then start laughing evilly.)  
  
(After about 10 minutes, the DM finally returns to the room.  By this point, Dan and I are expecting him to have come up with a reason for our plan failing.)  
  
&gt;Dan:  ""So, what happened, buddy?"" Dan said in a goading voice
&gt;DM:  ""You bastards.""
&gt;Dan and I: ""GUAHAHAHAHAHAH""  
&gt;DM:  ""Let me explain what happened, and why it's pissing me off.  First, I rolled to determine which person in the room the axe targeted.  9 others in there, and it still targeted the demi-god.  Ok, fine.  Then I rolled the attack roll.  Natural 20.  Seriously.  Then, I confirmed the crit and rolled damage.  Then I rolled all of the other attack rolls.""  
&gt;DM:  ""In the span of a few seconds, the room went from being a normal command meeting, to having a decapitated demi-god lying on the floor, and a flying axe slaughtering the officers.""  
&gt;DM:  ""We're done for tonight.  End of game session.  We'll discuss this tomorrow"".  
&gt;Dan:  ""Are you mad?""
&gt;DM:  ""No.""
(Dan and I celebrated)  
  
*The next day*
&gt;Dan:  ""So how much experience did we get for killing a level 99 and his command staff?""
&gt;DM:  ""You leveled up.  You are now level 10.""  
(of course we tried arguing it)
  
*About 5 minutes of arguing later..*  
&gt;DM:  ""You hear rumors of a rich tomb in the hills south of the city, tales of great treasures.  You decide to go investigate""  
&gt;Me:  ""We decide to go investigate..""  
(DM has a brief travel for us to an elaborate tomb that appears to be for a paladin, and shows us a potential way in)
&gt;Me:  ""Spot and search checks, do we see any traps?""  
&gt;DM:  *Doesn't roll dice* ""no""  
&gt;Dan:  ""We enter the tomb""  
&gt;DM:  ""As you enter the tomb, the tomb seals behind you.  The tomb is designed to protect the Paladin's remains, and are protected by his god.  You will forever wander these halls, never aging or dying, but never escaping as well.  The end.""  
&gt;Me:  ""I thought you weren't mad..""  
  
And that's how he ""killed"" off our two characters that he thought were overpowered.  Before you guys do the ""DM is a dick"" posts, let me just say that I loved playing in his world.  It was a challenge, and he wasn't always against us, it's just that when I roleplay evil, I dislike authority.  Other games which were not evil were nowhere near this competitive, but this game unraveled because our evil guys were so selfish we wouldn't follow any of his plot hooks.

I was fighting the last battle of FTL, the final phase of the Mothership, where it has a super-powered shield. This was the furthest I had ever been in the game. 

A pitched battle is being fought, my cloaking and shields barely keeping me alive against the onslaught of missiles and laser blasts from the Rebel Mothership. My boarding party was killed in a freak missile strike during the previous engagement, leaving but a lone Mantis, by the name of Artyom, to invade the colossal enemy ship and wreak what havoc he could.

My ship held its own, but the enemy ship seemed able to replenish its shields nearly as quickly as I could bring them down. We chipped away at each other, all the while Artyom tore apart the Mothership's internal components. 

At long last, the enemy ship was down to a single point of health; all it would take was one laser to get through, one missile, one *anything* to vanquish the behemoth and claim victory for the Federation. Just as my pegasus missile was about to fire, disaster struck. The enemy super-strike took out my weapon systems, killing the crew member responsible for repairing them. 

Things quickly got worse; the enemy's supershield soon came back online. I had no weapons, no steering, and my shields were severely damaged. Surely there was no hope...

Artyom disagreed. The enemy mothership's automated systems suddenly repaired its missile bay; it was all the opening Artyom needed. He began visciously attacking the missile controls, tearing them to pieces.

""ARTYOM, NO! DON'T BE A HERO!"" I shouted at my screen. (Literally, I really did, I'm not making that up. Artyom and I had been through a lot together).

Artyom didn't listen. He was trapped inside the supershield with no hope of escape, and he knew it. With his last, glorious, defiant act, he tore apart the missile targeting system, finally executing the limping mothership. The ship exploded in a brilliant burst, a tragic but fitting end to the greatest crew member I have ever known.


So that's the story of the first time I ever bear FTL (on easy).

We got ambushed by an Illithid and his minions. The Avenger (on point) steps out into a cavern and gets mind-controlled; my gnomish Paladin is a few feet behind him, but the rest of the party is backed up in the tunnel. Tactical assessment: This is bad.

There are few options open to us. Ideally, we would charge into the cavern, stun the guy who's handing out mind-control effects, and go to town on his minions...but our party is not as unified as it should be in this situation. They're huddling back in the tunnels, afraid to come out in fear for their lives. And inspiring speeches are the department of the guy who just got mind controlled.

1372486689.0,43,self.gametales,1harr7,[Fiasco] That time we kidnapped the President and started WWIII,49,6,2,http://www.reddit.com/r/gametales/comments/1harr7/fiasco_that_time_we_kidnapped_the_president_and/,"So, my friends and I decided to take a break from more traditional roleplaying games and give Fiasco a try. Fiasco is a free-form story game, purchasable [here] (http://www.bullypulpitgames.com/games/fiasco/) about, well, basically anything, but typical games usually go the way of *Fargo*, with disastrous crimes and plans going completely awry. To start, you roll a pool of d6 dice and take note of how many ones, twos, etc. These are how you choose relationships, items, locations, and needs for use in the game. Now, you choose relationships between the players, and then attach items, locations, and needs to them. There were three people in this particular game. My friends and I were playing DC '73, which is set in Washington, DC in 1973. Cold War spy shenanigans abound. With the person on my right, I had a political relationship of visiting dignitary/host, and the location of the Armed Forces War Room. With the person to my left, I had the relationship of politician/adviser, and the nuclear football. Their relationship with each other was military officers, and the need was ""To get respect after a major fuckup by making things right."" After some debating, it was determined that I was a Ogilvy, a Soviet diplomat with KGB ties, and the person to my left was my military advisor, Andrei Kulikov. My host was Col. John Arnoldson. We soon worked out a backstory for this merry band, in which Kulikov had orchestrated the theft of the nuclear football from under the nose of Arnoldson, who had hushed up the theft in order to stem panic. The President had ordered Arnoldson to recover the football. Arnoldson knows that Kulikov is the one who stole the foorball. 

Now, Oglivy and Kulikov were visiting in DC to get the remaining nuclear launch codes, and they brought the football with them. Arnoldson greets them at the airport, and, after some passive-agressive wordplay, screws up and reveals that he knows they are coming and might be planning an ambush later. Forewarned, when they get to their room that night, after sweeping for bugs, Kulikov and Ogilvy decide to contact KGB elements in the city for possible support. The next day, Ogilvy goes out on legitimate diplomatic business, but is stopped short by a crowd of ""Better Dead than Red"" protesters with violence on their minds. He discharges a hidden pistol to scare them off, and quickly conceals it, but the shot was heard by the police and he is taken in for questioning. Meanwhile, Arnoldson and Kulikov are engaging in a ""friendly"" shooting competition at a range just outside DC. They both pull off some impressive marksmanship, but Arnoldson cements his victory with an insane trick shot, leaving all observers stunned. Later in the day, Kulikov contacts a guard. He has Soviet sympathies, and can be bribed to get them into the White House War Room. 

Ogilvy and Kulikov meet the next night, and prepare to enter the White House. The guard lets them in, with a knowing smile. Kulikov and Ogilvy get to the War Room, but when the door opens they are met with the President, as well as Arnoldson holding a very large gun and the nuclear football. He had swapped a regular briefcase for it earlier. Much shooting ensues. In the chaos, Ogilvy grabs the President and makes a run for it, with Kulikov covering him. Arnoldson is in pursuit, and the ~~redshirts~~ Secret Service are coming, firing all the way. Ogilvy takes a bullet in the shoulder, but it is only a glancing wound. They both get into a room and begin to interrogate the President. He reveals that the remainder of the codes are...back in the war room. Suddenly, two black choppers appear. The Secret Service, believing them to be reinforcements ignore them, but KGB agents begin fast-roping out and taking out hostile targets. Arnoldson shoots the pilot of one through the cockpit, causing the helo to crash and kill its passengers. Kulikov and Ogilvy, still with the President, are heading back to the War Room. The guard from earlier is fighting alongside him, their money having bought loyalty as well as entry. Suddenly, his head bursts into offal, and Arnoldson appears. Everyone races inside the War Room and locks the door. Ogilvy binds the President while Kulikov hunts for the launch codes. The door to the war room bursts open, and Arnoldson begins hosing the room down with an M60. Several KGB agents die, while the rest, along with Kuikov and Ogilvy, take cover, dragging the President down with them. Arnoldson takes a round in the arm, and his gun is knocked away, effectively putting him out of the game. Ogilvy, Kulikov, and the remaining agents take the President to the remaining helo and get inside. They fly away, with Secret Service IFF tags ensuring safe passage.

Now, Fiasco games end with an epilogue, determined by each character taking turns in order, based on how well their character did, on a scale of ""Fate worse than death"" to ""Fan-fucking-tastic"" (that's a quote). Our epilogue went like this:

The Soviets escaped to the USSR.

The U.S. mounted a covert op to recover the football and the President. Only the pilot survives, but the President and the football get out.

Arnoldson is arrested for treason, because the government needs a scapegoat and can't admit the truth, and put in a federal penitentary.

Kulikov, through further bribery, gets a package sent to Arnoldson. Inside is Kulikov's cobalt blue handgun, with a single round inside.

Kulikov is promoted to General. 
Ogilvy, for his indelicate handling of the situation, is assigned to an armor brigade as a political officer (think commisar). Said brigade is invading Alaska, because why not.

Arnoldson uses that as an opportunity, and escapes jail using the handgun, and runs as fast as he can in the general direction of Alaska.",Tabletop,False,self,t5_2wqgc,False,table,,True,t3_1harr7,http://www.reddit.com/r/gametales/comments/1harr7/fiasco_that_time_we_kidnapped_the_president_and/,

1374262025.0,42,self.gametales,1inft7,[Pathfinder] Lady in the water,46,4,1,http://www.reddit.com/r/gametales/comments/1inft7/pathfinder_lady_in_the_water/,"&lt;!--Begin unnecessary exposition--&gt;

Here I stand, looking at a hole in the wall of my room. It wasn't there a minute ago, of course, I had to push aside the bookshelf and inspect the inlaid brick, noticing instantly the not-so-subtle lines that divided the wall from the hidden door. We would later discover what I had found was nothing more than a dumbwaiter of sorts, but the miniscule, pitch-black tunnel that revealed itself&amp;mdash;after finding the brick that could be pressed, after jamming the bookshelf so the door wouldn't pull the clich&amp;eacute; shutting-behind-you-by-itself thing&amp;mdash;that tunnel's mere existence seemed more than enough reason to stare.

But standing around gawking wasn't enough. I obviously had to go in. Because even if it was a dumbwaiter, dumbwaiters weren't that boring; why, they went practically everywhere, including to places my father had expressly forbidden me to go. But let's not pretend that thought gave me some rebellious joy; I'm in a castle that just so happens to have my dad in it, I'm grabbing the summoner the next room over, and we are exploring the shit out of this crawlspace *because it's there*.

Why do I need a summoner to help me explore what I could certainly handle myself? Let's just say my enthusiasm might have been tempered when I rushed excitedly into the wall-hole immediately upon finding it, realizing seconds later that I was completely enveloped in darkness. And let's just say the summoner might have an eidolon with Nightvision and Fly. These things come in handy.

But exploring could take longer and prove to be more fruitless than expected, as we reached junction after junction in our path, finding first the storeroom, then the kitchen, then the ballroom, and so on in that fashion. ""Let's try going down,"" the summoner suggested, blindly gesturing at a small hole in the floor. ""I could grease us up.""

""That... won't be necessary."" We could all easily fit down the hole, and its opposite walls served as a boon to Climb checks, requiring only DC 10 every 10 feet. We started shimmying down in the same procession we'd been using up to that point: first the eidolon, then the summoner, then me. This only became relevant when the summoner crit-failed a Climb check and landed on his creature. She audibly grunted, her face squished by his uncoordinated ass, but succeeded a Strength check to bear his weight.

Upon reaching the bottom of the shaft, we began to hear screaming coming from below us. Ever curious, we looked for a way down, but only found a small, unopenable grate. My attempts to bust it open proved fruitless, crit-failing two swings in a row and damaging my morningstar. The summoner then commanded his eidolon to use her bloodblade, a short sword carved from vampiric stone that we had looted off a big bad some weeks prior. The sword had shown to be incredibly useful in our endeavors up to this point, so imagine our dismay when it tied a hardness roll with the grate and both shattered at the same time. Rest in pieces, magical pink sword.

After squeezing through our second hole without the help of grease, we found ourselves in what can only be described as a good, old-fashioned torture dungeon. Peering through small windows in the doors along the sides, we saw everything from a giant cockroach eating piles of iron&amp;mdash;a sight which thoroughly disturbed the summoner&amp;mdash;to, well... me. I saw myself inside a cell. I almost became convinced that I was actually in there, realizing it was something else entirely when the summoner edged in and the view quickly became both of us inside the cell.

&lt;!--End unnecessary exposition--&gt;

No longer enthralled by the amusement park of torture, we came to a door with no window, which opened up to reveal a long, narrow corridor populated by magically-animated paintings. The next thing we notice is that one of the paintings had an adamantine bar placed across it, bracing a length of rope. Long story short, while the summoner and I had been gallivanting about the dumbwaiter dungeons, the rest of our party had found this hallway (from the other end) and the sorcerer decided he wanted to join the pretty island girl in the tropical beach painting. The only problem was that he couldn't swim worth a damn and the island girl was actually some sort of fish monster. He'd been underwater this entire time and had maybe 30 seconds left before he would need to start making Fortitude saves to not *drown*.

Naturally, the other two members of our party were inclined to save his ass, but the fighter&amp;mdash;the only one who could swim&amp;mdash;had full plate armor to the effect of a -6 penalty. This didn't stop both her and the inquisitor from going in after him, though the fighter did take care to rig the bar-across-the-frame makeshift anchor for her own safety. Meanwhile, the sorcerer was fast losing breath as he was grappled by and fought with the island-girl/fish-monster. Though he eventually managed to burn her face off with a weakened flame spell, the outcome wasn't looking good; the fighter and the inquisitor were helpless against the thick currents of the sea they'd thrown themselves into, and the sorcerer, now 85 feet below the surface, realized he didn't have enough oxygen to make it back alive. As we used the rope to pull the would-be rescuers out of the roaring water, the sorcerer accepted his fate.

""Where's the sorcerer?"" the summoner demanded as the fighter and inquisitor were ripped from the confines of the painting.

""He's dead,"" the inquisitor gasped. ""He's at the bottom of the ocean.""

And indeed he would be, in a matter of seconds. But there was no way I was going to let that happen. In full armor, my groundspeed was 45. With Longstrider, it became 55, and with the summoner's Haste it became 85. I had no listed swim speed, and the DM informed me I could move at half my run speed if I swam as a full-round action. That meant I could reach the sorcerer in one round if I passed my Swim check. Knowing my untrained roll would be garbage, and with not a second to spare, I cast Bit of Luck on myself, allowing me to mulligan a single d20 roll before the next round ended and take the better result. This simple preparation proved most handy when my first roll was a 9 and the next was a 19.

I dove into the sea at breakneck speed, successfully reaching the drowning sorcerer just as I saw him become enveloped in a supernatural black sphere. The DM's only explanation was that my speed would *double* to swim back up with the sorcerer in tow. I didn't need anything more than that.

My next movement action was rocketing high into the air, my swim speed having been boosted to the unimaginable level of 170 feet. The sorcerer lived, left with what we affectionately called a ""hickey,"" in reality a permanent scar, from his patron goddess seared into his neck.

And that is how we almost lost our gnome sorcerer to a fucking pond.",Tabletop,False,self,t5_2wqgc,False,table,author,True,t3_1inft7,http://www.reddit.com/r/gametales/comments/1inft7/pathfinder_lady_in_the_water/,
1373472380.0,43,self.gametales,1i0jc4,[Pathfinder] The beginnings of my party's troubles: starting out as POWs &amp; slaves behind enemy lines.,46,3,7,http://www.reddit.com/r/gametales/comments/1i0jc4/pathfinder_the_beginnings_of_my_partys_troubles/,"This is the first in what I hope will be a series of posts on my party's ongoing adventures/misadventures in a Pathfinder game I'm running.  I'll try not to give anything away (because one of the players, my brother, reads my reddit posts regularly), but it should be entertaining anyway.

First, the setting:  It's Pathfinder rules, and the standard Pathfinder campaign setting, with a HUGE twist:  back in history a ways, the dwarves disappeared.  They never made it to the surface in large numbers, never brought their smithing and combat skills with them, and never fought the goblinoid races.  Something like 99% of the dwarves vanished from the world, along with their underground citadels and fortresses.  As a result of this, when the hobgoblins made it to the surface, there were no dwarven adventurers hot on their heels, slaughtering and scattering them.  Shortly thereafter, from amongst the hobgoblins on the surface arose a leader who rallied his people as well as the orcs, goblins and bugbears in the area, and from them forged an army that began attacking the northern continent.  Due to a series of political blunders, a lack of high-quality arms, and savvy military tactics by their leader, the hobgoblins conquered first a kingdom, then several, and eventually over the course of several hundred years they have come to conquer the whole of the northern continent.  It's been 20 years since the last boats of refugees came to the southern continent, and information on the hobgoblin horde's plans is scarce.  The southern coalition has been fortifying and preparing to some extent, but they have their own problems, political and other, that is holding them back from being a unified force in the same way as their enemies to the north are.

The situation for slaves in the north is not very good.  They're bred like cattle and worked like dogs, used for harsh manual labor and fed only enough to keep them alive and able to continue.

The party begins the adventure as either POWs or slaves.  It consists of a halfling monk (parents were monks, got the basics down before being enslaved when the island they lived on was raided by hobgoblins), a gnomish barbarian (pit fighter for entertainment), an elven wizard (POW from the south-lands), and a half-orc priest of Torag (a blacksmith who was given Torag's holy book ""Hammer and Tongs"" to read, thinking it was an instruction manual for smithing).  They're in a small town in the River Kingdoms, many hundreds of miles from the coast, surrounded by enemies, no decent starting equipment, and only their skills and wits can save them.

Their tale begins in mid-spring.  A small mouse, starved and desperate for anything nourishing, gnaws through the leather strap holding a guard's keys.  The halfling, Mike, uses this key to escape in the middle of the night, and frees a few other prisoners who had some fire still in them (many had been slaves for generations now, and couldn't imagine life otherwise).  While sneaking around the town, they stumble in to the blacksmith's quarters and encounter the half-orc, who readily joins them as it presents an opportunity to escape what he has come to view as an evil enterprise.  The party thus complete, they continue trying to escape town without notice, eventually making their way in to torture tent where the encounter a dwarf with one leg left on a rack, caked blood on his back from being lashed.  The dwarf recognizes the holy symbol of Torag around the orc's neck and calls out to him - he is another blacksmith, and the one who secretly planted Hammer and Tongs in with the half-orc's books in hopes of keeping his own faith alive.  Though they've never met, the half-orc and the dwarf are connected.  After fighting a patrol, the party, along with the peg-legged dwarf escape town in the middle of a raging thunderstorm.

So, any interest?  I'll be happy to continue their tale here if folks want to see where this goes...

Edit:  Fixed Torag's name to be spelled correctly.

1366380018.0,41,self.gametales,1codau,[EVE Online] A lesson learned the hard way,46,5,21,http://www.reddit.com/r/gametales/comments/1codau/eve_online_a_lesson_learned_the_hard_way/,"The story I'm about to tell took place in September 2011.

I had been playing EVE since 2004, and played it actively since 2009.

First I like to explain some background about the game, also see [this post](http://www.reddit.com/r/gametales/comments/1cltqq/for_those_that_like_the_eve_online_stories_but/) for a more general writeup.

Basically the EVE universe holds lots of solar systems, and some of those are controlled by NPC factions. 
Sec, short for 'security' ranges from -1.0 to (+)1.0 where 1.0 is the safest, -1.0 is the worst.
Everything 0.5 and above is labeled as 'highsec' and those are the safest areas to live in. They are controlled by NPC factions, not conquerable, there is Concord ('space police') that comes kill the offender if you are being attacked and while wars are possible in an organized manner (Concord will ignore fights between corporations that have an ongoing war) and you can be ganked (killed by high damage in a short time before Concord arrives) it is generally safe.
Then there is 'lowsec', wich ranges from 0.1 to 0.4 security level. In those systems is no Concord, but stargates and space stations are lightly protected by sentry guns that will shoot an agressor. 
Last but not least, there is 'nullsec' wich ranges from -1.0 to 0.0. Some of those systems are owned by pirate NPCs and a lot of them are owned by [player alliances](http://go-dl.eve-files.com/media/corp/Verite/influence.png).

In 2011, my corporation (consisting of me as leader, and some friends) lived in highsec, in the areas of the Caldari State NPC faction.
The most we did was running missions issued by an NPC corporation named 'Spacelane Patrol' in the system 'Josameto' (a 0.6 security system), and thus due to lack of fantasy, the corporation was simply called 'Spacelane Mission Runners' (SLMR).

Now mission runners make okayish money. 
If you are running level 4 missions (and we often did that with a fleet of 4-8 people, and 1-2 dedicated 'salvagers' (people that salvaged the wrecks of the NPC pirates for useable modules and alloys)) you can easily make around 15-30 million ISK per hour. 
Mission runners are mostly investing in better and better ships, modules (weapons, shield/armor, speed, etc...), ammo and drones (little remote controlled ships). 
While income is slow, its steady as long as you keep running missions, and we've done so for over a year. 
Stuff sometimes got boring but we had eachother, chat/teamspeak and lots of fun. 
Every now and then we flew into lowsec or nullsec with cheap ships, only to lose them due to our lack of PVP expirence.

Now mission runners usually have pimped out battleships, so they can run missions as fast as possible, since this is the easiest way to maximize their income without leaving highsec. 
Those ships are offcourse attactive to pirates who like to get rich of your stuff and it was no suprise that half 2011 we were being wardecced by a corporation called 'Confedeferate Union of Tax Legalists' (including the typo yes), a corporation controlled by a bunch of ISK (the ingame currency) hungry pirates that were not very experienced, but sure knew more about PVP then we did. 
All our members received an ingame mail from Concord, stating that within 24 hours, fights legally could happen anywere in EVE, including highsec.

We gathered up in our home system/station before the war started and stacked up on ammo, some ships and other things we tought would be usefull.

Not very up to date with the war/agression mechanics, our first ships were quickly lost during the first days of war.
The Confedeferate Union of Tax Legalists were people who actively looked for easy targets, wardecced multiple at once and kept camping the stations where they lived to wait for them to undock.

Now undocking alone wasn't a big problem. As long as you stayed close enough to the station and could sustain the incoming damage for long enough, you could easily dock up again and be safe; it still ruined your gameplay but at least you did not lose a ship. 
After the first few losses we learned this the hard way and figured we should all undock together to be stronger then them. 

Easily said and done, at the next evening of the war our station was as usual camped by two of their members, sitting in shiny battleships. 
The other members were most likely checking on the stations of the other corporations that were in war with them, and we were with 5 or 6 people in total.

We checked our ships EHP (Effective Hitpoints) and did send outside the member with most EHP first, to get them to attack, since people that recently agressed would not be allowed docking by the station (often refered to as 'station games').
The bait worked wonderfull, he was instantly attacked by their two members [and managed to kill one](http://eve.battleclinic.com/killboard/killmail.php?id=14175514) even before we were outside to come help him, then deagressed and docked up again.
A few hours later we retried the same tactic. This time the same persion (who was the corporations CEO) was trying to bait us out in a worthless rookie ship. 
One of our members undocked and quickly flew towards him, [shot him](http://eve.battleclinic.com/killboard/killmail.php?id=14211054) and warped of in a random direction.

Now he was mad, and ordered his members to come kill us, as we were all sitting outside the station, speaking brave words in 'local system chat'. 
They agressed us, and [failed](http://eve.battleclinic.com/killboard/killmail.php?id=14210586). The other members of them docked up and instead of them campung us, we were now camping them. 

Some days moved on, and we were getting tired of the station games. I closed the corporation and opened a new one named 'Jovian Legacy'. 

We decided that it was time to move on and do other things. No longer run silly missions in highsec, but time to get some real experience in the game. We decided to enter a wormhole.

Now wormholes are special things in EVE. They work a bit like the stargates that jump your ship between solar systems, except that they can also lead to 'unknown space', often refered to as W-space.
Those W-space systems have a security status of -1.0 and are the darkest areas of EVE. There is no police, there are no stations to hide in, no easy ways out in the form of stargates and there is not even a way to see what other players are in the same system.
It's dangerous and deadly, you have to maintain your own base [('POS' aka 'Player Owned Structure')](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/11684856/EVE/pos0003.PNG) and keep it fueled, put ammo in the guns and make sure your members have a semi-safe location to store their stuff and log off in.

Wormholes exist in 6 classes, ranging from C1 till C6 where obviously C6 is the hardest to live in. We decided to go for a C3 with a 'highsec static', a guaranteed wormhole that leads to high security space, but every 24 hours respawned to another random location in the system and connected to another highsec system.
It kept us safe from the agressors, made us hard to find, we had a pretty good income and we gained a lot of experience on PVP combat (the hard way, by loosing lots of ships) and staying safe.

The CEO of the Confedeferate Union of Tax Legalists in the meantime found out that we deserted the original corporation and went to look for us.
First he wardec'd (war declaration) the new corporation again, making highsec once again unsafe for us. 
Some of the members decided to leave the corporation and some decided to continue to life in the wormhole and go to highsec as less as possible.

We got into contact with another corporation named 'The Condemned and Convicted'. Those people hired themselves as mercenaries to the highest bidder and were paid by [one of the other corporations](http://eve.battleclinic.com/killboard/killmail.php?id=14722806) that were in war with them. 
We decided to set a trap.

Without notice we returned to our former home system and sat there with a few 'bait' ships. Ships that were fitted in such a way that they could sustain a lot of incoming damage, to be able to hold them up for a while as they were trying to kill it.
We mailed him, asking if he still remembered us and if he was still failing to find us. He bited without hesitation and soon after entered that system.

The other corporation was a few jumps out with their forces, waiting for the action. They had a huge fleet of battleships and some scouts; they had logistics (ships that specify in remote repairing other ships) and electronic warfare ships (those can 'jam' the targetting systems and other parts of enemy ships, rendering them useless).

Soon after our bait pilot undocked he was engaged by the alliance leader and made sure that he could not get away by scrambling his ships warp drive. The mercenaries jumped into system and warped to our pilot who was quickly repaired and saved from loosing his ship while the agressor was [quickly shot down](http://eve.battleclinic.com/killboard/killmail.php?id=14662100).
His fleet ran away and stopped attacking us. We moved back into our wormhole and stayed there since that moment.

Thanks to his actions, we learned to play EVE the hard way. We learned to fight back and we learned to survive in harsh conditions. 
We learned to look for fun again and not care as much about our ships as we used to, because there is allways a new ship waiting to burn. 

Still, we all think he was a total dick for attacking a clueless highsec space mission running corporation, but we learned and became stronger then ever before.

Nowadays most of our members live troughout lowsec, nullsec and wormhole corporations all over EVE, but still we all talk to eachother about those adventures.

Fly safe o7

I found myself in service of the kingdom of Vaegirs, running messages for Vaegir boyars and fighting alongside them in their wars against the other neighboring kingdoms. After accompanying the King's army on a long campaign deep into the steppes against the horseback-riding Khergit hordes, King Yaroglek had given me a battlefield promotion, raising me to the status of Boyar and granting me a small village along the northern coast as my holding.

Nearly a year had passed since then, and I had spent that time serving loyally as a vassal of King Yaroglek, and had made both friends and rivals in the Vaegir court. I tended diligently to my small holding, spending a great deal of time among the commoners and tending to their needs. Many of my rivals in court scorned me for the time I spent among smallfolk, but I took great pride watching the village gradually grow from ragged and impoverished to prosperous and vibrant.

My village was far from the frontlines, but war was a constant in the Kingdom of Vaegirs. The Khergits from the steppes to the east, the proud Swadians from the plains to the south, and the ruthless seafaring Nords to the west were constantly pressing into Vaegir territory and the Vaegir army often found itself worn down and outnumbered. Many of the nobles held King Yaroglek responsible, blaming him for poor leadership, greed, and disorganized management of the war effort. He would send the Vaegir host marching back and forth across the kingdom, always arriving a little too late to break a siege or repel an invading army, and when his officers captured holdings, he would take them for himself. Many refused to answer his calls to war. 

But I was loyal to the king who had raised me to my station, and I answered the call whenever I could, leading an army of what knights and bowmen I could gather. I became an adviser to the King in matters of the court and war efforts, and tried to build a more united front to repel the invaders. He eventually appointed me marshal of the Vaegir army, and I was sent to make war on the Kingdom of Swadia. I vowed to strike a blow that the Swadians would remember - the tide of war may shift back and forth, but this campaign was to leave a lasting mark. I called the banners and gathered together the nobles who had come to be my friends. We would not be raiding villages or assaulting lesser keeps on this campaign, I told them. We would be attacking the heart of Swadian power and influence, their trade center, the city of Dhirim.

Dhirim stood in the very center of Calradia and sent caravans to all corners of the continent. It was also one of the most heavily defended cities in the world. My army was large, but it would not be an easy victory. We marched south, and upon arrival I arrayed my army outside the walls, preparing for a long siege.

The first assault on the walls was thrown back with heavy casualties on both sides. I rebuilt my siege engines and made another assault. Again we were thrown back. Again and again, we attacked by day, by night, in clear weather and rain, leaving mountains of bodies each time. Days and then weeks rolled by. Morale began to drop. Other nobles abandoned my army and marched home with their retinues. The King sent word - he implored me to call off the campaign and march north again. But I would not turn back without my prize.

At last, in a final, gruesome push, we managed to break through the defenders and sack Dhirim. But the carnage wasn't over. A Swadian warhost, led by King Harlaus of Swardia, arrived just as my men took up position on the walls. We found ourselves hastily repairing the defenses we had just overrun. King Harlaus tried to retake the city by siege. Three more bouts of fighting followed, and the Swadian warhost was left ragged. We sallied out of the city and met them in the field. Half a dozen smaller battles broke out on the country side as my nobles split up and squared off against the remnants of the Swadian army. I led my men against what remained of King Harlaus' personal guard, and once they were broken and fled, the war was done. I was tired, and there was a lot of blood on my hands, but I had done it. I had broken the Swadian power base and given the Vaegirs a lasting edge in their bid for Calradia. Leaving a garrison in Dhirim, I rode north again to return to the capitol.

There was no time for rest, however. With our forces away, the Khergits had been raiding deep into our territory. Before I could gain an audience with the King, I was sent to lead the army to drive them out. Weary but dutiful, I complied.

It was while I was on this campaign that I received a letter from the King. He recognized my service to the kingdom, he wrote, but he had decided that lordship of Dhirim should pass to himself. For my service to the crown, he offerd me 800 gold.

The sum was a slap in the face. Not only was it barely enough to feed my army for a week, but I was not granted so much as a holding for all I'd done. After all the long days of bloody fighting and hundreds of lives lost, this was the last straw. Then and there I staked my claim on Dhirim. The city would be mine, and it would be the first holding in a new kingdom that served no other monarch. 

Unfortunately, this was not unexpected. My defection had been planned for. I was branded a traitor, and my beloved village in the north became hostage. Suddenly the other nobles who had been following my banner became my enemies. I was hopelessly outnumbered and completely surrounded, stranded out in the Vaegir tundra.

The first to approach me was my closest friend among the Vaeigr court. Before the Vaegir army descended on me and my followers, we met to parlay. He was outraged. He cursed me for my betrayal and demanded my surrender. 

I asked him to let me go. He cursed and admitted that he did owe me that much. He agreed to give me a head start, but then he would come after me.

Taking my small retinue of followers and soldiers, I fled south, slipping through the Vaegir lines to my new seat in Dhirim. It was the only hold to my name, but it was one of the most powerful in the world, and damn near impregnable. I appointed those loyal to me to lordships, and soon other discontented nobles from the other kingdoms began to flock to my banner. From there I would plot my revenge on King Yaroglek, the liberation of my village on the northern coast, and my bid for control of Calradia.",Video Game,False,self,t5_2wqgc,1374708957.0,video,,True,t3_1izp3w,http://www.reddit.com/r/gametales/comments/1izp3w/mount_and_blade_a_kingdom_is_born/,

I've got a couple.,44,8,2,http://www.reddit.com/r/gametales/comments/1g0no2/gmodso_were_doing_ttt_stories_now_ive_got_a_couple/,"For dramatic effect, and because I can't quite remember exactly what everyone said, nor their usernames, both stories will be told in a narrative fashion, rather than a play-by-play. The scenarios themselves actually occurred, regardless of whether the precise details are accurate.

These two stories represent my greatest triumph, and my most entertaining defeat. We'll start with my defeat.

I no longer remember the name of the castle where I died. It's been too long. I no longer remember the name of the man I killed, nor the name of those who died after. What I do remember, though, is how I died. It wasn't a death in glorious battle, no. It was a death inflicted by cruel fate. I and my co-conspirators had finally received the order to take down the others occupying the castle with us. I was with the detective at the time. I grabbed the nearest weapon I could find, a pump-action shotgun, and blew his brains out without hesitation. He died instantly, I stole his scanner, and fled the scene. Now, here is where events start to go downhill. We were in an area only accessible by ladder. I jumped down, intending to latch onto the ladder to break my fall, but I missed. The fall killed me.
For a short moment, everything was black. Then, freedom. Glorious freedom. I could move in any direction, go wherever I wanted. The walls of men could not hold me back. In my explorations, I happened across a small gathering of the innocent, one holding a shotgun similar to mine. Another said that he had heard a shotgun blast not long ago. The first vehemently denied discharging his weapon, for he had not. But the second would have none of it. He executed the poor soul in cold blood. And from there, it was like dominoes, innocent after innocent cut down in a frenzied panic, until only a few remained. I know not what happened after, whether my brothers in arms survived. I only know that my final act caused one of the most incredible, most hilarious things I've ever seen.

Long before that, though, I tasted victory sweeter than any I have ever known.

We were in an abandoned office complex in the dead of winter. Our mission had been underway for some time now, and only one innocents, the detective, myself, and one companion remained. I met the detective in a hall near an entrance to one of the office areas, with my companion close behind. On our scrambled frequency, I told him to act, to take down the detective. Too late, I noticed one of the innocents at the other end of the hall, armed with a Scout. We would be shot instantly.
""No, stop!"" I cried out, but he had already fired. He missed, and the detective assumed I was on his side, trying to warn him. So I played along. ""I'm sorry, friend,"" I said as I killed my only remaining companion.
He fell, crumpled into a heap of blood and twisted limbs. The detective said I was proven innocent, and surmised that the only remaining man must be the final traitor. Again, I played along. We hunted down the poor man, and I let the detective take the final shot.
""Wait a minute,"" he said as he identified the body. ""This man was innocent.""
""I know,"" I said. A round through the brain made sure that he would not tell anyone living of what he had learned.",Video Game,False,self,t5_2wqgc,False,video,,True,t3_1g0no2,http://www.reddit.com/r/gametales/comments/1g0no2/gmodso_were_doing_ttt_stories_now_ive_got_a_couple/,

First move in the town, they split up.  

Bad start.


I play my character who hated guards and authority and tried to murder my way out before they did something stupid. 


I keep getting thrown back in jail while the human ranger buttfucks male prostitutes because he doesn't understand how dickish DMs are about that.  While he's contracting AIDS the orc asks about my character's location to a merchant then fucking kills him,  FOR NO GODDAM REASON.


So the AIDS ranger gets pissed and goes to SLEEP(?!) while I'm getting in a pissing contest with the warden about who was tougher (whose fault is that shit right?) and the orc is beating the holy shit out of local guards based completely off good rolls.


Well the ranger eventually comes into the jail and the orc does as well.  The orc says, ""kill the warden!""

1367767341.0,40,self.gametales,1dqfot,[Call of Cthulu] The only RPG I've played. (Quite long),50,10,8,http://www.reddit.com/r/gametales/comments/1dqfot/call_of_cthulu_the_only_rpg_ive_played_quite_long/,"The game is Call of Cthulu set in the 1920’s.

It is the only table top RPG I have ever played to date and I will never forget it. The details are a little fuzzy but it’s enough to make out into a story.

I decided to play as a 6 foot 7 black Scottish man who distills whiskey as a living and despite numerous death threats by the locals, I have my own bar set up in a Texas town, somewhere in Texas it doesn’t really matter.

Anyway there are about 5 of us so far sitting in the bar drinking. Me, J who is a daredevil pilot driver person, P who is a photographer and L who is just L. We all had our strength and weaknesses but it’s not incredibly important.

I may have neglected to mention that I have a close friendship with Al Capone as this was during the Prohibition era so guns are pretty accessible to us.

Onwards with the story, J gets a letter from some bloke asking him to investigate a murder of a family up north, and so our adventure begins.

At this point me and P are on a train heading up and J and L are in a plane flying there taking overhead pictures of the estate that we will be investigating.

Once we the train arrived at its destination J and L had already set up camp at a hotel but we were several miles away as the train station was out of town. So we caught a carriage to the nearest town sparking conversation with a fellow named Joe. At the time he didn’t really strike me as odd but our DM liked to include little jokes in campaigns I just didn’t know when it was going to come up.

So we arrive at the town and me and P are unloading my 4 crates of whiskey I brought along just in case, I also had a shotgun stored just in case we needed to kill some unsuspecting corpses.
What I neglected to bring what ammunition for said shotgun.

Skipping ahead a few hours and we made our way to the library which I was not allowed access to due to my skin colour but later bribed the librarian with a crate of whiskey to be let inside, offering samples and whatnot. 

We found out the manor we were investigating had a family that died many years ago and the husband went missing, and that they were buried in the nearby graveyard.

Me and P, being new to RPG’s decided that was a clue just buried for us so we set out to the general store and started buying out spades and wheelbarrows, all the necessary grave robbing stuff.

Eventually Joe popped up and offered us a lift to the gravesite, not necessarily odd but friendly nothing more. Me and P, our eyes set on digging up the bodies of one mother and three children questioned our sanity for a moment but shrugged it off. The DM decided to lower our sanity by a few notches because what sane people think the first thing they are going to do to find a murderer is dig up the corpses of murdered family members from 30 years ago.


Night sets in and me and P get to work, ignoring fatigue. We get start to dig out the graves but we neglect to think about the local patrolling police man who is just doing his shift around the site.

Now at this point the DM has to roll three d20 and the lower the score the better as it means he spots us in the act and we get sent off to a mental asylum.

Natural. Fucking. Twenty.

Then an 18 and finally a 19.

It was as if the police man had come up to us and said “Evening gentlemen, I see your doing some excavation work, would you like a hand with it?”

So the police man goes off on his way and we finish digging up the bodies and surprise surprise we find fuck all.

So me and P set off to get some sleep and at this point its 6 am in the morning, we are fucking shattered. P managed to roll high enough to make it back into his bed but I pass out in the middle of the street. An hour later I am rudely woken up by said Police officer who neglected to find us digging the graves of the beloved family we are investigating. He assumes I am drunk and wakes me up by splashing my own whiskey which was given to him as a gift by the librarian on my face.

Skipping ahead we’re all at the manor and all sorts of supernatural shit it going down, water dripping down the walls and floors. I fell into a hole and lost more sanity points for starting into the eyes of Cthulu’s right hand man who decided to make the basement his house but managed to get out in time.

We investigate some more and look at the aerial photos that had just been developed and notice hundreds and I mean hundreds of black spots all in the fields behind the manor. We investigate the field and find the rotting corpses of cows all dissected in the same way, drained of fluid.

Later we think it’s a good idea to sleep in the house and get some rest, sleep in the manor we are investigating for murder, in which all sorts of creepy shit has already gone down.

What could go wrong?

Well a lot of things apparently, we all saw some black demon scurry under the bed and spend 20 minutes fighting off what we thought was the spawn of Satan, but it ended up being  a racoon.

We woke up in the morning and heard a subtle hissing noise coming from the kitchen, none of us wanted to investigate but I nominated myself to charge in kicking the door down and roaring.

Now picture this, we all thought some ghosts or other shit had started fucking the kitchen up but it was much, much worse.

Me, Alfred Tumbleweed the 6 foot 7 black man from Scotland. Built like a shitabrick house charged in head first only to find, fucking Joe cooking us breakfast completely fucking nude apart from a apron he had on. I don’t know what the DM was playing but I think he wanted us to live out his own gay fantasy that day.

So we were all like “What the fuck Joe” And Joes all like “Howdy boys! Hope you all like bacon!” while rocking a raging hard on.

Eventually we defused the situation and Joe thought we wouldn’t be awake for another hour or so and he feels more comfortable cooking naked for some strange fucking reason. Anyway I digress, we investigate some more and find out that the owner of the house had walled off the master bedroom with salt, at first we were confused, then we found out that the beast living in the basement was only repelled by salt, so we took some shotgun shells we found in a shed and filled them with the salt and loaded the shotgun, only issue was now we were completely unprotected from the spawn of hell downstairs and he knew it.

In an instant we heard this bloodcurdling scream as if someone was being burned alive. I rushed out of the bedroom and looked down the stairs only to find Joe literally melting before me into a puddle of tentacles. Shit was going down. I rocked out the shotgun and immediately without hesitation shot Joe in the fucking face. I was not going to let Joe fulfil his sexual hentai fantasies on me.

So now Joe is crying and I noticed the salt which only blinded Joe had burned away some of the goo that was pulling him under into the bowels of the beast. We all put two and two together and figured that Joe was actually just an innocent gay man living in the 1920’s and fought he could have a chance with me by cooking breakfast naked. Not the right hand man of Cthulu.

The beast, which had now engulfed Joe was coming for all of us up the stairs, we figured we had two turns before it reached us, I held him back for 1 extra turn by shooting in with my salt shotgun while my friends escaped. Then I used all 18 of my strength to propel myself into the window crashing outside onto the floor.

We ran as fast as we could away from the building and went straight to the general store to buy all the towns supply of salt. In the end we had about 5 bags of it  and decided the best thing to do would be to carpet bomb the house with salt. Yes, carpet bomb.

We all set ourselves up in the plane that J and L used to get here and made continues swoops down at the building, the first time the bad went straight into the window and we heard a demonic screeching sound, the next 2 bags missed and then finally we got the last two on target, both going through the roof. As we flew off we heard the sound of hell itself opening, a screech so unbearable that not even with our hands pressed against our ears we couldn’t muffle it. And then the explosion happened, the beast must have been buried deep underground because the amount of goo that was sent everywhere from the blast was huge. Half the town was covered in grey goo and we flew off because we didn’t want to explain to the town why there friendly carriage driver was dead and why they were covered in Cthulu juice.

1376571400.0,35,self.gametales,1keyts,ad lib campaign makes players question existence,54,19,12,http://www.reddit.com/r/gametales/comments/1keyts/ad_lib_campaign_makes_players_question_existence/,"Just had the most amazing D&amp;D session I have ever experienced or heard of. I should start this off by mentioning that this campaign is entirely being made up as it goes. When my players say they do something I tell them how the world reacts, I’m not telling them where to go. I may occasionally suggest some course of action but I leave it up to them to decide what they do. It’s been a lot of fun so far. 

Today’s adventure started off with the players going on a dangerous mission with a ship full of dwarves (I know, dwarves on boats) through a magical wall of fog in a massive underground lake, like big enough to take a galleon over. On the way they fought a kraken and ended its miserable life like it was nothing. One of my characters, Dokuga, ended up leaping off of the boat and into its mouth to tear at its squishy insides with his bare hands. The crew ate well that night; and for the rest of the trip. 
The adventurers managed to find their way to the wall of fog that the dwarves referred to as the wall of doom, a massive vertical wall of shifting black fog that no one had ever gone through and come back out of. With the use of a simple control winds spell from James, the party druid, they managed to make it through the fog to a beach with black sand. 

The fog was still thick near the shore so visibility was poor. They set up camp and prepared a party to head out into the fog. The captain of the ship led the group through the fog. No one, including me, was sure what was going to happen, I had some vague ideas at this point. As they progressed through the fog they came upon a road of black glass and decided to use omen of peril to determine which way was safest. Omen of peril told them that right was to danger and left was to safety. Naturally they went right. Now when I told them that right was to danger I was basing that assumption on how I expected the characters to react to various things that they might find along the way. I have no way of telling them the danger of things because I don’t know what is going to happen until shortly before it does. The reason I thought it would be dangerous is because James, the druid, is a burn happy pyromancer who’s only life goal is to burn one of everything. Most situations that James is exposed to lead to bloodshed and corpses so naturally I assume that few things in the campaign will be safe. Anyway, they walk along this road for some time and come upon a horse drawn carriage being driven by a shadowy man almost completely wrapped in a cloak with his face mostly obscured by a large hat. His eyes are dim sockets of white in his head. He stops in the road in front of them, the dwarven party that is behind the players assume danger and all draw their crossbows. This is the part that I assume James is going to start some shit. But instead, much to my surprise, reacts to this very unnerving man who communicates only through screeches and sounds that one would expect the grudge to make and moves like a stiff marionette with only curiosity and he and Dokuga manage to convince the dwarves to stand down. As the carriage leaves Dokuga gets the first look at the creatures they can expect to find, black shadowy humanoids with papery skin and holes in their faces for eyes and their mouth with dim white light pouring out; they dress in fine gothic clothes. 

The party continued along the road for a while and comes across small domes made out of the sand which I tell them has a consistency more akin to fresh snow than to sand. The domes are discovered to be small makeshift houses for strange little shadowy humanoids similar to the one that was driving the carriage. They mostly pay no mind to the party. Here again I expect James to burn everything and instead he attempts to talk to them, again only getting shrieks and demon noises in response. Dokuga begins pantomiming to them only to have them mirror him and regard him with what appeared to be confusion. As the party continued down the road they tried to convey a message to the shadow people to take them to their leader, two of the shadow people began leading them further down the road. They came upon a large city made entirely out of black glass with its front gates wide open and a large empty field of sand between it and the smaller hovels of the shadowy people. The parties shadow guides shrieked and stepped aside to let the adventurers pass to the city. 

The city was constructed entirely from black glass and the people within it were much like the shadowy creatures they had found but seemed more detailed. I described it to them like the small creatures they had seen were like the drawings of a child and these creatures in the city were like the drawings of a someone more skilled. The creatures near the front gate spoke a garbled mess of gibberish much like the sims; a small improvement over the shrieks of the smaller ones but no more helpful. As they progressed further into the city the creatures became more and more detailed. 

The party had pretty much given up on talking to the creatures but decided to give it one last shot, speaking in reverse in case they were some sort of mirror entities, the response they received was “are you trying to talk backwards? Are we playing a game?” we had a brief confusion over whether or not the creature was speaking backwards as well but eventually they understood he was speaking common. The creature introduced himself “this one’s name is Greb.” They asked him question after question about what this place was and what he was and what he knew about the world beyond the fog “do you always ask this many questions?” was what they heard in response. Eventually they arrived on the question of where he came from, something that Greb was capable of answering “I came from glass cylinder.” Sure enough a large black glass cylinder sat at the middle of the town. They asked Greb what he did “I am a glass spinner. Would you like to see my work?” 

The 3 of them walked back to Greb’s house and Greb showed him how he could pour sand into a furnace and then cause it to float out into the air and shape it without it ever touching his hands. He made James a bowl as a gift to the first person to ever be interested in his work. In their conversations with Greb he often referred to being “told” what to do. Greb would say things like “this one was not told to ask” or “this one was not told to leave” when asked who had told him he would say “this one was told by glass cylinder.” his life up to this point had been simple and he had seemingly been given a strict set of guidelines to follow. Naturally my players sought to break his simple world. They began asking him questions about why he had been told these things? Why had he never thought to do other things? If glass cylinder told him what to do then who told glass cylinder what to do? These questions obviously made Greb extremely uncomfortable as all he could respond with was “this one was not told to think”. 

Greb took them to “the thinkers” these were creatures that were “told” to think and if anyone could answer their questions than it was the thinkers. Greb led them through a portal into a place similar to the city they were in but with different buildings and denizens and this time it was all white. The thinkers stayed in a small building nearby and thought. Greb offered them his “passion for his work” as form of payment and the thinkers readied themselves to be asked a question. The party asked their questions, things that had never before been considered by the thinkers or anyone of this race before. They had never questioned their existence or their surroundings because they had never been “told to”. The conversation ended with the thinkers essentially shutting down to process the completely incomprehensible thought of the players asking the glass cylinder the questions they were asking the thinkers “one does not ask glass cylinder.”

 Greb seemed to become more and more conflicted as time went on, obviously struggling with the idea of doing something he was not “told” to do. Eventually Greb came to a descision, he asked that if the players were going to “ask of glass cylinder” that they would also ask a question for Greb. Greb’s feelings on the subject were still very mixed and he didn’t feel comfortable asking glass cylinder himself. Greb asked the party to ask glass cylinder “where is this one’s mate?” to which they agreed. They party left but were stopped by Greb who asked one more question “why is this one’s mate gone” and he stressed the why. Greb wanted to know what sort of force took his mate but more than anything wanted to know why it had happened. 

The party went up to the cylinder and asked entrance which they were granted. Inside there was a spherical pink room that seemed to go on forever and a bridge that extended over a bottomless pink pit to a door about 20 feet away. They called out to see if anyone was there “I’m busy” a little girl replied. They asked if they could come in “I said I’m busy” was the only reply. They said they just wanted to talk “Daaaaeeeeemmmm” the little girl whined. A creature much like Greb but pink walked in from the room at the end of the bridge “were you told to be here?” still wanting to mess with the strange creatures the players said “we told ourselves to be here.” Daem, the pink humanoid, seemed extremely confused by this and turned to ask the little girl in the other room what to do. Finally the little girl appeared in the doorway and shrieked with excitement at seeing another human. The little girl was not a shadowy creature like the ones they had seen but was a human like them, well, James at least, Dokuga was a tiefling. 

The little girl explained to them that she had been there “for a loooooooooooooooooooooooong time” and that she had been drawing friends to help pass the time. She showed them her pictures, saying each time what they were “This one is a painter. This one is a chef. This one is a cleaner”. Each picture was drawn in immaculate detail and each of them depicted one of the creatures they had seen in the city. The players asked the little girl about Greb, she replied “Greb’s my favorite. Greb loves Izla” they asked what happened to Greb’s mate “I took her away” they asked why “they had a fight” why again “because I told them too.” The little girl had been playing a game and according to her “mommies and daddies fight and leave each other” and that was why Greb’s mate was gone. None of this was planned, it all happened completely organically, we made it up as we went. 

The party asked the little girl if she could bring back Greb’s mate “nope, she’s gone” they asked if she could make another one “it wouldn’t be her” was all she said. The party asked if they could leave and take Greb with them, having grown to like him. The little girl agreed but only on the condition that they take her with them. James, once again acting completely against his character’s normal personality asked if she could let all the creatures think for themselves. The girl made one last drawing by taking sand and forming it into paper and ink and drew a blue creature and said “this one’s a teacher.” They left the cylinder to find Greb waiting. Greb asked the little girl, finally deciding to do something other than what he was told,  “what happened to my mate?” to which the little girl replied “I took her way, I’m sorry” “I forgive you” Greb replied “I love you Greb” the little girl said “I love you too” Greb replied. The “teacher” walked out from the cylinder, towering above the rest of the creatures and sat down on the cylinder, light and glorious music poured out of his mouth and into the rest of the creatures for a moment and then he smiled and relaxed in his seat atop the cylinder. 

The party left the city after taking Greb to go and pack his few belongings and found the dwarves waiting outside. The citizens of the city all came to see them off and wished that they would return someday. The little girl formed sand into gold to give the dwarves what they had come for and the players, the dwarves, the little girl and greb walked back down the road to the beach where the ship was docked. They loaded up their belongings and set out to return to their home. Greb sat at the back of the boat watching the beach fall out of view in the fog. He said that he wished to see his home one last time, the players told him he could just come back, he said he didn't want to. 

Basically the way I understood this was that Greb was the only creature “told” to love. And he had his love taken away from him. So he was the only one of the creatures that had ever had reason to question anything because he was the only one that had ever experienced loss and the only one that was unable to do what he was meant to. The rest were content to do what they were “told”. So far this campaign has seen gods released, players reincarnated like glorious phoenixes, a dwarven kingdom was purged into chaos, and the players procuring an army of 250000 dwarven clone soldiers. It’s been a wild ride and I would encourage everyone to try and play a D&amp;D campaign like this someday.

1371407499.0,38,self.gametales,1ggssy,"[Empire: Total War] The Persian Empire, Macro-Economics, and the Pan-Islamic Alliance",49,11,2,http://www.reddit.com/r/gametales/comments/1ggssy/empire_total_war_the_persian_empire/,"So before I begin, let me say that after hours upon hours of playing this game, I felt as though I had mastered it. I would get to a certain point in every game where pure numbers dictated I would steamroll the rest of the continent, which became not so fun anymore. I was looking for a different kind of game play when I downloaded Darthmod, turned the difficulty all the way up, and began playing as minor nations. This is the story of Persia, and the very last campaign I played.

A word of note, I used Darthmod to increase the number of cannons in a unit as well as the overall size of all units. It also changed the AI considerably and made them much harder to fight, and added some changes like making garrison units tougher.

So after all the world conquest games before, in this one I decided to pursue diplomacy and trade in what would be dubbed the ""macro-economic strategy"". For every penny I earned, the highest priority was reinvesture into the economy. To this end, I shelled out money and promises like a madman to get trade agreements and alliances from my neighbors. No price was too high to meet and no boot too dirty to lick.

Except for one, the Ottoman Empire. Sensing weakness in me because of my lack of an army (damn upkeep), the turkish bastards swarmed over my borders in a bold attempt to seize my capital. Immediately I began to train massive units of militia as reinforcements and drove the invaders back as my allies entered the fray as well. With skillful application of cavalry and camelry, the mighty Persian counterattack was able to carve into the heartland of the Ottoman Empire and secure a peace at the expense of 2 territories. 

Hate and envy clouded the judgement of the turk, for instead focusing on my much weaker allies or their enemies to the north, they once again declared war on me less than a year later. Once more the militias were levied and sent off to fight the invader with their pitchforks and be conveniently killed off before they could collect their meager pay. 

This would be how the decades long Egyptian Wars would play out: while the common man in his masses fought and died to delay the superior turkish armies, a small host of veteran Persians would pounce on an unprotected province or 3 and seize them with brutal efficiency. 1 or 2 of these provinces would be ceded back to the Ottomans in order to secure a temporary peace before tempers flared and the drums of war beat again. Bit by bit the Ottomans were whittled away until my armies beseiged Istanbul itself.

However, while the turk had exhausted himself with meaningless wars against his brother muslim, the Persian Empire had grown stronger than ever. More ports allowed them to broaden their trading contacts and begin competing in the trade theaters while her infant infrastructure had matured into a well developed trade-based economy. Combined with low army upkeep, the money was rolling in. With this properity and trade came technological advancement: the Persians had attained cannister shot, and the world of warfare would be forever changed.

The Ottoman commander no doubt chuckled as looked over the small force of Persians beseiging Instanbul from the nearby hills. Such a small army would never be enough to break the walls of his city, and the impudence of the Persians knew no bounds. He would sweep them from the field of battle with his stack of Jannisaries and musketmen and teach them a lesson in overconfidence.

As the Ottomans sallied forth from their gates, the combined force of missile and melee cavalry and camelry swept down and annihilated the enemy cavalry in a bloody sortie and fell back to the cannons before the enemy infantry could respond in kind. As the cavalry reformed on the hill side, the big guns started to boom as the unsupported Jannisaries began their long walk up the hill.

The Persian forces were arrayed at the top of the hill, 2 units of cannon flanked by a unit each of militia and dervishes. Time and again the Ottomans would charge up the hill, only to be broken by the roar of cannister shot and the countercharge of screaming dervishes and scared militiamen. The courage of these Jannisaries was something to behold, but as the missile cavalry moved to flank them their doom was ensured and the army was routed. The gates to Istanbul lay open and the Ottoman Empire was relegated to a weakened buffer state in south eastern europe. They would of course attempt to reconquer their territories from time to time, but a half stack of cannons and cavalry would be all the Persians needed to protect their one non-allied border.

This battlegroup would become the mainstay of the Persian armies. Cannons and cheap melee units backed up by a strong force of missile and melee cavalry and camelry. Standard procedure was to use the cavalry to destroy the enemy cannon and cavalry at the outset of the battle. Once their infantry was left unsupported, the survivors would fall back to the cannon emplacement and pound them into oblivion. The first order of battle was to make the enemy walk to you.

The Persian Empire had been quite careful to maintain a good reputation during the Egyptian Wars and was rewarded with a plethora of allies, mostly Islamic nations. However, while the Persians were grinding down the Ottomans, the Maratha Confederacy were threatening to eliminate Mysore and the Mughals, both valuable trading partners and allies. The Persians began infusing her allies with constant gifts of cash while training an expeditionary force to relieve them in the war against the infidel Marathas. Suffice to say, dumping money into your allies can actually work, and with the help of the expeditionary force the Indian subcontinent was reconquered. The southern tip was redistributed to Mysore and the northern regions to the loyal Mughals with the Persians only keeping 2 coastal provinces for their own governance.

With allies on all sides except one and numerous trading ports, the next step towards world domination was invasion of the trading theaters. With ample coffers to afford ships, this was easily achieved by forcing the Ottoman navy off of their spots and by eliminating the pirate threat. With Persia's sterling reputation and booming economy, a golden age of influence began wherein her trading partners numbered 16-21 depending on the current state of world war and new nation emergence. Great Britain began invading Mysore and the Mughals, but constant infusions of coin and the sharing of technology with my allies prevented them from gaining any footholds there. Such was the wealth of my empire that christian nations began begging to join my alliance. This led to a surprisingly stable world order governed by an extensive network of trade and alliances in which Persia subtly guided the course of world events by funding proxy wars, sometimes against contries allied with them or with one of their allies. As new nations emerged, Persia would always be the first to recognize them and offer them all the cash and technology they demanded in return for trade. It was sometime in the 1750's when I stopped playing. Besides the proxy wars and arbitrary nation building, I had run out of things to spend money on.

Just finished cleaning out the Nchuand-Zel Excavation site under Markarth and am feeling pretty good.  Decide to finish up some basic amenities on my house but short on Iron...  I know, I'll head to ""Halted Stream Camp"" which has lots of Iron &amp; the 'transmute mineral ore' spell which I've been lacking.

So, I stealthily approach the camp and get right up to the wall without alerting any of the bandits (4) of my presence.  Doing great I think, about to determine whether I can kill them quickly with a dagger or whether I should pick them off at range with a bow from an elevated position.  No complaints, should be a milk run.

Suddenly a dragon flies overhead.  No biggie I tell myself, this should distract the guards long enough for me to quickly dispatch them but only after they've done a significant amount of damage to the dragon which I will kill too.  Couldn't have planned it better myself until...

All hell breaks loose and the camp goes nuts.  Red points show up all over my compass. There's yelling from the camp, arrows go flying then...  lightning bolts...  Bandits... Spells... wha..??

Shit!!!  Vampires, at least 3 of them.  They are attacking the bandits.  On the horizon, that dragon is circling around but...  make that TWO... two dragons INCOMING NOW.  Spellbreaker up, magical ward taking fire damage, battle being lost by bandits to vampires.  Dead bandits back up, reanimated.  INCOMING Bandits. 

Taking lightning hits.  Falling back.  Sprint damnit, just run!  Shout to push them back... being swarmed.  No time for crossbow, too slow and cannot slow down.

Frost dragon making a strafing run, shield back up.  Mudcrabs killing a wounded sabertooth, now joining the fight against the vampires.

Dragon on top of me, shield back up, pushing on Dragon.  Head rearing up, shield at the ready, BASH and BASH AGAIN.  Hit with conjured sword.  Vampires closing, I'm outa here!!!

Falling back, Giant took a hit from Frost Dragon, he's joining the fight.  His two mammoths joining the fight.  Will he side against the Vampires?  I can only hope.

Have fallen back to my home North of Whiterun, Lydia is on it, not armed her up yet but she's got spirit, I finally have an ally.

Remaining Bandits on Lydia, she's killed one but... Vampires on Lydia, heal Heal HEAL!!!

Lydia's down... no... she's back up, reanimated against me, Giant incoming, scratch that, he's hitting the Frost Dragon.  Flame Dragon is on the ground running after me...  Vampires all over, guards from Whitewatch Tower (3) didn't stand a chance.  They have been eaten by the Frost Dragon then reanimated by the Vampires.  1~2 arrows kills them but now I've backed up into a Spriggan and she's bringing bears.  Not those wimpy brown bears but the white ones that have buckets of health.

Battle is barely manageable then...

As I play an engie most often I'm running around up there deploying turrets and ammo and covering points with my under barrel grenade launcher. 

Suddenly everything goes quiet, we had destroyed the TR's last spawn point down at the base of the mountain so I decided to take a little jog down the mountainside to the nearest terran base and take the fight to them. What I didn't know is that a large terran armor column was winding its way up that side of the mountain.

So, as I skidded down the dirt slopes I encounter a cliff over a road jump off it only to land...on an enemy tank. 

He can’t see that I've landed on him so I pull out my AV mines and proceed to lay/ throw them frantically on top of him while jumping off the side of his tank. 

As the explosion goes off behind me an infiltrator uncloaks in front of me and I'm staring down the barrel of a fifty cal. rifle.

Having taken out my under barreled after the mines but being within the arming distance of the grenade I figured I was dead, but I fired anyway.

Lo and behold the dud grenade pegs him right in the head for a one shot kill. 

After skidding down the mountain trails taking out a few assorted infantry that are trekking up to follow their armor I am running low on ammo.

Just as I decide to hole up somewhere and access an ammo pack I see a rather rare sight. A loaded galaxy dropship, which is essentially a large troop carrying plane that is rather slow and fat, heading for the Crown.

As I look up the thing is met by a literal wall of flak rounds, we must have had a dozen guys in flak suits up on top of the crown. And as I start running from under the shadow of the galaxy the whole thing explodes raining bodies some living some dead around me.

And as I turn to engage the wounded would be paratroopers... A piece of the god damn falling plane wreckage knocks me on the head instantly killing me.

I'm happy to clarify or answer any questions in the comments. However, some immediate standouts are Cyno (Locks a ship in place, and is a beacon for larger Capital ships to jump through, usually ""lit"" by helpless little ships), ratter (someone who does PVE almost exclusively),  Burn-out (you can ""overheat"" ship modules to get more from them for a short time, but they can then stop functioning), and Pods (These are the Capsules that contain the players piloting a ship, when a ship dies, the capsule is then ejected but is often very quick at warping away). EVE ""life"" or ""HP"" is measured in 3 values, Shield, Armor, and Structure, and they get depleted in that order.

All fights and videos are against other players only, and this is a pure PVP adventure. Frigates are incredibly fast, and if you manage to engage one, fights are often more like dogfights that need to end quickly before the bigger, nastier Battlecruisers and Destroyers can show up to ruin your day. ]

I was sitting in my home wormhole of Polaris, bored and not on Teamspeak. While reading some of the last few days of /r/Eve I come across a post titled [Favorite Eve Quotes?](http://www.reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/1h6rdp/favorite_eve_quotes/) I stumbled upon what happened to be my personal favorite, the explanation of a Blaster (Very short range, super high damage weapon type) Taranis, of which I fly many: 

Quote (slightly cleaned up for spelling/grammar):

***""There's a reason the blaster Taranis is flown by mental cases.
Fear is a handicap when you're travelling at 4km/s in a metal death tube with thin walls and three small nuclear devices strapped to the outside.
Should you survive for more than two seconds inside web range, the poor sap you fire those blasters at is seriously going to regret not having a web/tank/neut/whatever as you rip his face off at a close enough range to go through his pockets as you do it.
The other outcome is that you wake up covered in slime wondering where the bus that hit you went.
The Taranis is a ship for angry people who prefer to deal in absolutes. None of that sissy-boy, ""We danced around a bit, shot some ammo then ran away LOL"", or, ""I couldn't break his tank so I left"", crap. It goes like this:
You fly Taranis. A fight starts. Someone dies.
There is no other possibility."" - Stuart Price.***

[Original Post Link](http://www.reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/1h6rdp/favorite_eve_quotes/carh2sd)

Feeling a bit of pride as the exact type of pilot that the quote describes, I hop in my Taranis and take a look at my chain map, and see we have a nullsec exit to go play in. I take my frigate and jump out our 3billion mass static, unawares of it's status as ""On the verge of collapse"". Sure enough, my little ship collapses the wormhole.

Well, perfect, I like a long roam and don't care about losing a Taranis and pod. Let's do this.

*Slight sidebar: I fit my Taranis class Interceptor in a slightly strange way than most. Neutrons in the high slots, MWD, Sensor Booster, and Warp Scrambler in the mid slots, 2 Magnetic Field Stabalizers (dps increasers) and a Damage Control II in the low slots. I effectively have no tank on this ship.*

*The reason I fit a sensor booster (the abnormal choice) is twofold:* 

* I roam around nullsec often looking for cynos to insta-blap. Sensor boosters increase the speed at which you can lock ships. I've killed a lot of them and the pods used to get away often. They don't anymore.
* When not lock-time scripted, the abysmal 25km lock range gets to a manageable 32-33km. Allowing me to assign my 2 drones a bit earlier (as you'll see).

I decide to start my cyno hunting trip and immediately stumble across a gang of 6-9 Talwar class Destroyers, Sabre class Destroyer, Ares class Interceptor, Raptor class Interceptor. I escape (barely) but claim that had I not burned out my Micro Warp Drive (MWD) Propulsion Module. I'd have certainly peeled the Ares away and killed him. The Ares pilot proceeds to call me a cunt, then a pussy in local. Real classy, Insidious Empire.

http://www.twitch.tv/neonend/c/2510240

So I make my move to a Station system in (luckily) nearby Stain to repair my poor MWD that burned out unceremoniously. Find a Rifter who doesn't want to engage without Hurricane backup, so I moved along.

I see a cyno in system and warp to it. It is a Heron, but as I land the cyno drops and he docks up. After some shouting in local to demand they undock and relight the cyno, they decide to undock a Dominix, Rattlesnake, and Gila. I pull range and poke around for awhile so as to entice them to bring a frigate out. At one point a Gila gets lucky with some Acolytes (I killed 2 of them and claimed Op Success in local) then they bring out a tackle probe to hold me in time for the Gila. Perfect plan, right?

http://www.twitch.tv/neonend/c/2504736

After I escape yet again, the fact that I'm armor less makes me a prime target for IMMEDIATE BLAPPAGE. So they undock a Taranis of their own! I watch as the Gila assigns his drones to the Taranis, and chuckle as I decide now is a perfectly fine time to die:

http://www.twitch.tv/neonend/c/2504740

Turns out he's rocking a 940+m ISK pod in his Taranis (The Taranis, on it's own, costs a whopping 30m). That *would* be considered an op success. I'm pretty glad I fit a Sensor Booster.

I move along further to find an Ares playing around on station with a Hurricane as backup. I manage to engage the Ares on station before the Hurricane can undock again. It didn't go well for him: 

http://www.twitch.tv/neonend/c/2504744

After playing on station trying to salvage the Ares wreck, a Sabre shows up, a hookbill undocks, and another Taranis hits the field. I'm feeling pretty suicidal, but not completely so. I warp off to repair some mods that I've overheated and re-online my Magstab (I offlined it to turn on my heatsink salvager). Came back to find them all fighting each other. Sabre vs Hookbill/Taranis. Sabre dies, I try for the almost-dead hookbill but he escapes, along with the Taranis.

Turns out the Sabre pilot was the same from the Talwar fleet before as my friend the Ares pilot lands with 7 or so Talwars, and a Vigil. This is the same Ares pilot who called me a ""pussy"" for not engaging his whole fleet before. I *suppose* I should man up, right?

http://www.twitch.tv/neonend/c/2504751

Doesn't seem to matter to him, as I take him on under his whole fleet, kill him, and get out (relatively) clean, he chocks up his loss in local to me being a pussy again. Well played.

After they toy around a bit on station, then leave, I continue on.

...and stumble across a handful of carriers and assorted battleships shooting an IHUB. As I hit the grid, the carriers all jump out, and assorted battleships take a few pot-shots at me from 70-100, to no avail. I hang around and do some near-passes to entice them, and sure enough, a Stilleto shows up to provide some kind of magical warpin where he doesn't die, and the battleships all lock me in time. It doesn't quite go as expected:

http://www.twitch.tv/neonend/c/2509872

Then, on the gate, another Stiletto shows up, this one with more tank and more damage!

http://www.twitch.tv/neonend/c/2509907

The Taranis comes out in 9% structure.

I've made my way to roughly the new wormhole my alliance mates had since scanned down, but turns out it's a renter homesystem for ratting, and I coerce some locals to bring a condor and Caracal to the wormhole. They lose the condor to me and my friend (in a Cynabal) but we lose the Caracal and he gets away.

I put my Taranis away in 7% structure.

Last winter break my friend decided to try a fourth edition campaign, which would be my first time trying the new edition. (don't worry this is not an edition rant.) 

My friend bought a premade campaign from a gaming store and worked with the party to make our characters. In the end there were three of us. The DM's brother played a controlling wizard (mostly status changing spells). My sister roled a pixie rogue, and I decided to play a Minotaur Paladin. 

I thought it would be fun to play a bruiser. So I cave him super high strength, constitution, and charisma. Dexterity and wisdom were average (both in the 10-12 range.) And intelligence was his dump stat (a respectable 8). To make things more interesting I made him LG.

Then it was time to buy equipment. The GM let us have a a couple of free magic items of our choice, and a fair amount of starting gold (we started at level 9) to buy things with.

I decided to get some summoned plate armor +3, A crown of seven deaths (when an opponent was killed its soul would get absorbed into the crown.) For his weapons I chose two axes. His side arm was a psychokentic battle ax, which could be used as a thrown weapon once a day and then would be returned to the wielders hand. His main weapon was a crashing great ax, which could be used as a thrown weapon and had a neat ability where once a day, upon a successful ranged attack, it would knock the target and all adjacent enemies prone.  Because his fighting style mainly involved throwing either of his ax's he named himself Gethrow Gibbs, and his famous words were 'let me Gibb you an ax'. 

And just to annoy the rest of the party, I gave him a fun quirk where he would use big words to sound smart, but always use them improperly. His favorite was transcend/transcendental/transcending, which was used in at least one out of every four sentences. With our characters ready to go we began the campaign.

Our adventurers started out with a standard enough quest, kill a nearby bandit king and bring back his head as proof of death. After a short conversation to get everyone on first name basis, they set out to find the bandit king.

We find a group of bandits in a forest clearing ad combat ensues. It becomes quickly apparent that the wizard and the rogue are a good match up, he would daze enemies which would give the rogue her sneak attack. Determined not to be out done, Gethrow pointed at a nearby bandit and issues a divine challenge. Bandit swings at Gethrow, the bandit's attack bouncing harmlessly off of Gethrow armor. Gethrow chuckles. ""How Prophetic, (not a misspelling, actual word used.) now you shall transcend. 

Activates ability that sends and enemy flying back on a successful melee attack. Gethrow swings at dwarf, roles a 20 and confirms the crit. The dwarf dies because of the hit, but his body is still flung backwards and slams into another bandit. The DM rolled some dice and revealed that the dead dwarfs mace hit the second bandit in the head, knocking him out. Gethrow stands in a badass pose while waiting for the rest of the battle to end.

After the battle a pyramid appears in the middle of the clearing and a strange magic pulls us inside the pyramid. 

We land in a pit of bodies. Combat immediately ensues as two carrion crawlers appear to fight the party, along with a giant two headed troll standing at the edge of the pit ready to hit us back into the pit if we get out. Gethrow and the Wizard climb out with ease, but the pixie is stuck in the pit (pixies had limited height to their flying ability and the edge of pit was too high for her to simply fly out.) She was quickly surrounded by enemies and was certain to die.

It comes around back to my turn in combat. Getrow yells 'Duck.' He then 'transcendentally threw his crashing great ax' which hit one of the enemies. Because of the weapons special ability all of the enemies were knocked prone (they were all adjacent to the target) Pixie managed to get out of the pit, but the Wizard gets surrounded. Gethrow tells the wizard not to worry, for he is the transcendental guardian. Gethrow activates benign transposition and switched places with the wizard. The monsters pummeled Gethrow but were quickly dispatched by the rogue and the wizard. 

After the battle the party heard a voice from a bag on a hook. Inside the bag was a sphere with a female eladrin's head trapped inside. The woman says she was trapped in the sphere by the master of the pyramid and new how to get out. Through a successful sense motive check Gethrow finds out that she was not telling the whole truth. When confronted, the woman continued to avoid the truth, claiming to not trust the party. Gethrow decided that this meant that she was evil and should die. The party decided to take the sphere from Gethrow and give it to the pixie.

Through out the campaign it is revealed that the sphere gave the user magical abilities, including one that made the user invisible until the MISSED an attack 
(you can imagine how powerful this was in the hands of a rogue)

Anyway our party continued to wander the pyramid, faced some challenging puzzles and monsters, nothing terribly noteworthy. 

Party gets ready to open a door, but a successful listen check reveals enemies on the other side. Party realizes that this must be bandits trapped in the pyramid as well. A plan is quickly laid out, and the door is kicked down. We were then greeted with perhaps the best description I have ever heard.

'You see a group of bandits who are as surprised as you would be had you not known that they were there.'

The bandits had created  barricade between us and them, and were using it to attack us with ranged attacks. The Wizard and Pixie were doing fine, but Gethrow only had his axes, and no way to retrieve them after thrown.

I look at my power cards and was hit by an epiphany. On my turn I spend my action point and Gethrow leapt into action. He flung his crashing great ax, knocking the enemies is prone. He then sent a prayer to Moridin for strength (to represent the use of an ability called virtue that gave him 21 temp hp) and let out a mighty roar.

""WINTER IS COMING""

Gethrow activates winter's arrival which teleported him into the middle of the enemies, and made the terrain around him rough (could not be moved out of without provoking an attack of opportunity.) Gethrow picked up his ax and waited for one of them to try to move. The bandits were quickly dispatched. A search of the bodies yielded a map revealing that the bandit king was nearby. 

Our group came up with a plan and entered the room where the bandit leader was. The pixie turned invisible and Gethrow jumped into the fray. By this time the party had learned how to fight together. Gethrow would point at a distant target and shout 'Fear my pebbly doom' which was his signal to tell the invisible pixie who to attack with her sling. Pixie attacks, crits with a confirm, ends up tearing a hole in the stomach of the bandit. The bandit's think Gethrow is some sort of all powerful magic user and all rush him. Gethrow tanked like the paladin he was, letting the pixie and the wizard do all of the killing. 

During the battle the DM would inform us every couple of turns that something was slamming into a nearby door. After we kill the bandit king the door finally breaks open and a wolfman jumps out.

I get excited about the prospect of having a werewolf minotaur. By this time our party had reached level 11 and accessed their paragon paths. Gethrow's involved him getting possessed by his ancestor. 

Gethrow's eyes turn blood red. 

He looks to the other two. ""This battle is mine."" Aspect of dominance is activated, every successful attack sends the enemy flying back 20 feet. Gethrow hits the werewolf back in the room that it leaped out of and charged after it. While Gethrow fought the werewolf, the rest of the party searched the surrounding area and looted the chest. 

Party returns in time for the wizard to land the killing blow on the werewolf. 

During the battle, Gethrow got bit. He did not, unfortunately, contract lycanthropy. What he did contract was Moon disease, which is a fancy word for Rabies. 

Gethrow was the party healer, and neither of the other two had enough skill with healing to try and cure Gethrow's disease. The party took an extended rest and Gethrow's disease progressed to the next stage. Where, if bloodied, he would attack anything in time. 

I decided to have a little fun with role playing. Every once in a while I would twitch and start to moo loudly. This, of course concerns the other two. They went into a side room to talk about what they should do, leaving Gethrow on his own in the hallway.

Gethrow looks at a nearby pillar, and realizes that the pillar is looking at him funny. Enraged, he swung at the pillar. Each attack was a hit, and Gethrow continued to attack it (I might have spent the whole time asking the GM if the pillar was bloodied yet.) Finally Gethrow crits and takes out the middle of the pillar. Not being a load bearing pillar, the top and bottom just stood there. 

Party rejoins Gethrow, realizes there was little hope for him, but were determined to try and see if he would get better. Pixie uses bluff to convince Gethrow to remove his armor. Then successfully uses bluff to get him to give up his weapons, and to allow the party to tie him up, all under the guise of being a 'trust exercise' (my sister rolled well compared to my shitty rolling.)

The now hog tied Gethrow is left in a separate room. The party then takes an extended rest. During the rest Gethrow disease progressed to its last stage, where he would attack anything on sight. The day starts with silence. While discussing what to do with me I interrupt them to say that they heard the following from the next room. 

""moo?Moo!MOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO! *CRASH*' In the grips of mad cow, Gethrow had started randomly charging walls in an attempt to get free. (I had by that time used strength to break out of my binds. The party realizes that they have to put Gethrow down. The pair head out to the hallway and get ready to open the door. 

Gethrow crashes through the door. Pixie knocks Gethrow prone, Wizard dazes him. Gethrow gets to his feet but it unable to make the save. Pixie knocks him down again and the process continues until Gethrow drops below zero health. 

Gethrow roles a death save
           
              Makes the save

                     A feat is activated that returns him to zero health, 
                                returns him to consciousness
                                         and makes it his turn.

Almost all of Gethrow's feats were put into making his lay on hands better. Gethrow uses all of his moves to heal himself back to full health. Ax in hand he smiled at his two teammates, foam dripping from his mouth. 

The wizard Dazes Gethrow. Gethrow never manages to throw off the Daze, and is only able to slowly make  his way towards his team mates who run and attack. 

Every single attack was a crit

Seven Crits in a row.

After the second crit Gethrow is forced to stop and spend his turns healing himself and giving himself temporary hp through his prayers to Moradin (virtue again). Finally the party manages to slay him.

Gethrow smiled and whispered to his companions. ""I have transcended.""

With a final sigh, Gethrow dies.

Attack:

The sun is down, and everyone has collected themselves and headed tot he inn for the night, some better off than others. Throzgar sits in the corner in a heavy cloak, hoping to stay anonymous. Suddenly, a City Guard bursts in the door. ""The outlying city of Tierra is under attack! i need all willing volunteers to follow me now!"" All group members choose to run with the guard, with the exception of spetrovi, whose interest is piqued, but he isn't hasty to make alliances.


The party arrives at a small village in the southwest corner in flames, and see a large fountain being destroyed by goblins in the south east, a broken tower in the center, and all around a decent sized army of goblins. One party member perception checks high enough to notice some goblins in the far corner standing still facing the wrong direction. The dragonborn warlord unsurprisingly wins leadership roll, and the party members plan out their strategy: ""We'll go this way, kill all these mothafuckas, then kill all these muthafuckas."" Everyone agrees this sounds solid, so they begin their turns except myself, since spetrovi moved at a slower pace. Tabu heads to the fountain and accidentally miscalculates his squares, placing him in an encounter with two goblins instead of one. He manages to take one out, and bloody the other before he is out of actions.

Bengal, Throzgar, and Nagad all head to the middle, where there is a field with trees and a large cluster of enemies, as well as the broken tower.

Isamarin and Dusk head straight north, taking on a few scattered goblins.

I finally arrive, and luckily roll an 18 on my perception check. Due to Spetrovi's arcana knowledge, he notices that the goblins in the back have glowing blue hands and are chanting something. Goblin mages, interesting. This discovery leads to the dm pulling out a counter die, and placing it between the four mages. Uh oh.

Figuring the path of least resistance is best, spetrovi tries to clear out the fountain area. Unfortunately, his hypnotism check fails horribly, and the goblin is suddenly alerted to his presence. In a move of desperation and quick thinking, he uses his mage hand to assist him in throwing a brick at the goblin. 18. The brick hits the goblin square between the eyes, and he falls into the fountain and drowns.

Meanwhile in the center, Davneiros is tired of the goblins on the towers, and attempts to leap onto the tower. However his roll of 4 causes him to trip on the way up, landing him on the tower, but prone, and surrounded by three goblins. Throzgar sees his predicament, and makes a mighty leap. Both throzgar and Davneiros pass a acrobatics check, and throzgar rights him as he flies through the air, landing planted on top of the tower. Bangle decides that jumping is too much work, and uses a splash fire ability to set four goblins on fire. 

The counter die moves to one. The party knows this needs to be taken care of quickly. Bengal moves as far north as possible, next to a tree, and readies a standard action. Spetrovi runs up to him, communicates what he knows, and readies himself to be launched. 

We both roll. He lands a 7, myself a 4. Knowing that i can't afford to waste an action once i land, i use knack for success to ensure my landing. Bengal picks me up, swings me round, and launches me...


straight through a bunch of tree branches and into the enemy pheonix that was standing guard over the goblins. Close enough. Nagad realizes what is going on, and kills the pheonix before it can do anything, then attempts to take out a mage using holy smite. He is surprised when his sword rebounds off a magical barrier, and his holy smite cracks it. Being nearby, I roll a 16 arcana check and discover that the barrier is weak to fire. The weaponsmaster creates a torch in the dragonborn's hand, and destroys the barrier. Throzgar takes out one of the goblins quickly, but not quick enough.

The counter die is removed and replaced with a massive earth creature, now weakened due to not being properly summoned. The other party members nearby take their hits against it, but do rather little damage. It responds by stomping on everyone, dealing 10 damage to the entire party.

Throzgar is tired of this shit, so he uses his daily to kick a goblins so hard that as it flies away, its arm decapitates the one behind it, finally leaving only the mages, one goblin fighting isamarin and dusk, and one back int he burning village. Daveneiros and tabu manage to bloody the rock monster, and Bengal finishes it off with a massive fire attack. 

The rock monster teeters, then falls right on top of nagad and daveneiros, dealing damage to them, and knocking two of the remaining three goblin mages off the map. 

Spetrovi notices the fleeing goblin on the far corner of the map, and in his first actual offensive move, I roll a 18 to send a magic missile soaring across the battlefield, carving a perfect round hole int he back of the retreating goblin's head. After hints from the DM, spetrovi uses his magic hand again to pick up he 15 lb goblin, and interrogates him.

(in probably the worst russian accent ever): ""Tell me everything you know about what's going on here.""  'Why should i tell you?'

""look, you've made my day very difficult. Something big is happening here, and i want to know what it is. I'll even let you go back to your family and such."" (my 0 intimidate but 7 diplomacy causes this to fail, but i rethink my argument.)

""Let's make a deal. I don't have a problem with you or your dead friends here, but these acquaintances over here take this sort of thing much more seriously. Take us to your camp and i'll make sure they don't set everything on fire, even bengal over there."" 'Fine. follow.'

As i drop the goblin, i find a magical trinket and a tablet with a strange figure inscribed. Interesting. A messenger arrives to give throzgar his 30 gold cut for the day, and dusk, being a constant source of fail for the group, attempts to pickpocket isamarin. He rolls a 2, her dog form senses him, and takes a chunk out of his hand.

1367247508.0,38,self.gametales,1dc9m0,[Meridian 59] The War for the Helm,39,1,3,http://www.reddit.com/r/gametales/comments/1dc9m0/meridian_59_the_war_for_the_helm/,"This isn't my story, it was posted on the old Vanguard:SOH message boards which no longer exist. But it was so good I saved it...

-----

This is going quite aways back, but it happened back in Meridian 59 beta.

A bit of background but Meridian 59 was, i suppose, the predecessor to Everquest, but one big difference was that it was basically full pvp and if you came across someone's corpse before they made it back to their corpse you could loot everything from them (made for some very interesting grieving). Another part of dying is that you effectively lost a level so the big threat was typically that if someone did something too bad, your guild was going to hunt them down and kill them to 20 (lvl 20 being the lowest level you were elgible to pvp at).

Anways, The GM's held this event in an arena that was a basically a round robin 10v10 tournament between guilds last man standing type of thing. The winning team each recieved these helmets that could only be defined as truly epic, as they made the wearer completely immune to all types of magic.

Problem with one of these helmets was that noone ever wore them b/c if anyone saw you with one on, you were pretty likely to get ganked and have it taken from your dead body unless you had a guildie or friend who was a really fast clicker and could get it from your body before the other guys.


Well one day i come across this fella and we have some choice words about who was there first to camp this particular mob, so being the man, i am, i play it off, and later in the evening come across him fighting abig spider. Now...being the sob that i am, i jump is butt and drop him like a bad habit. By this time taking everyone's items was pretty much frowned upon (especially since by crossing the wrong people you could easily find yourself killed 20-30 times and losing 20-30 levels in one night) but, like most people, you at least look at the corpse and see what kind of gear they're carrying around.

Well, low and behold...........one of the infamous helms is on this guy(why the heck isn't in the bank?!?!?). Uh oh......Do I take it? Do I do the right thing and leave it? This is gonna wind up bad.....

I take it.

That was the beginning of a series of events that could only be defined as epic. All of a sudden you have people broadcasting across the entire world that i've taken one of the helmets and that it's currently in my possession and his guild puts a bounty of like 1,000,000 gold on my sorry head. (seeing as i only had maybe 1,000 gold that was a whole lot).

Needless to say I pass the helmet off to friend as quickly as I can so that my impending butt kicking won't be for naught.

Calling in the aid of my guild and a few of our allied guilds we all gather and get ready for the storm that's i've started. This guy gathers his guild and their allies and we end up outside of a town in the southern part of the world (it's name escapes me at the moment). Well, we all know that the stuff's about to hit the fan and there's an electricity in the air.

Rather than have the first major server war break out, our initial response that they can send their best player to fight me on the lake (this particular lake you could walk on the surface of, so it made a pretty decent place to duel). So we have at this time about 100-150 people in the zone including a few of the GM's that played all there ready and looking for a fight.

So here i am, standing on this lake across from one of the better players on the server, standing around my computer are like 4 of my good friends that also played M59 (we used to lan alot on a dialup connection...ouch) Things get rolling and i end up killing that that guy (after killing him i looted like 95 Dark Angel Feathers from his corpse...if you played you know how hard those were to obtain)

Well as you may imagine, they had no real intention of playing fair and as soon as I killed their champion, the battle started.

Fireballs were flying, Lightning was raining from the sky, poor noobs that just happend to be in the wrong place at the wrong time dropped like flies. We gave as well as we got and it was a hell of a good time. Luckly my friend had tucked the helmet away in our guild hall so that they coudln't get it back.

That was my first true taste of what a MMORPG could be like, and it if it didn't have me hooked before, it did from that instant.

Sorry this is so long winded but reminessing is fun.

Remind me to tell you guys about the time I infiltrated the best guild on the server so i could gane access to their guild hall, and lead an assault on their hall at 5am for my old guild. Good times.

1365971213.0,33,self.gametales,1cceg8,[Dwarf Fortress]...and thus ended the Deep Razors.,44,11,9,http://www.reddit.com/r/gametales/comments/1cceg8/dwarf_fortressand_thus_ended_the_deep_razors/,"So I just finished my very first try at Dwarf Fortress. As expected, it ended in disaster.

The Deep Razors started as a group of seven, and for six years they dug into the mountain. Their halls were small, but food and wine was plentiful. The depths were explored by bravely tunneling dwarves - progress only hampered by said dwarves' inability to find their way back up and dying of thirst. By the end over 250 dwarves lived and worked in the fortress, nearly half of which were children - a testament to the great fecundity.

Kobold thieves were a menace at first, until the militia was established under commander Sigun. Goblin ambushes and invasions were less frequent, but harder to deal with until finally the great compound wall was erected to protect the fortress entrance, the pastures and the quiet tomb spire.

But the Deep Razors were unprepared for the great goblin horde of 256. When word reached them of the new threat they laughed it off. They had weathered invasions before and felt safe behind their walls and in their deep halls.

Until the cave crawlers arrived. Until they blasted through the traps by sheer force of numbers. Until they smashed down the gates. Until they stood before the entrance to the fortress itself.

When the new scope of the threat became apparent, Sigun took charge of the militia. She massed the dwarves behind the carved gates into the mountain and made ready to face the cave crawlers. The first goblin wave broke through the gates and into the corridors before the militia was in place, but with minimal casualties they were turned back.

Sigun herself led a small group of soldiers against the invaders just beyond the first wall, and the dwarven might crushes the enemies. Sigun suffered grave injuries in the engagement, but rather than retreating into the fortress she bravely led her pursuers away from the gate. Only when she reached the next contingent of olm-mounted goblin archers did she turn back, slay the crawlers at her back and escape into the fortress.

Even the dwarven ambassador who had somehow reached the fortress through the enemy lines, even after the destruction of his caravan agreed on her prowess and offered her a position as a noble.

The fighting continued at the gates, drawn out and bloody, until finally the dwarves were victorious and the remains of the goblin invaders retreated. 

But the cost was grievous. Over 30 dwarves were confirmed lost in the battle alone, and more bodies were found over the next weeks. Even worse was the hit to morale. The horrors of war took their toll on the psyche of the Deep Razors, and dwarves everywhere were prone to tantrums, unprovoked violence and insanity. Craftsdwarves refused to perform their work and defences were left in disrepair; the lack of coffins left dwarves to rot in the halls, the miners refused to excavate room for new wells, new storage or new defences; traps were left sprung and useless.

By the turn of the season barely 150 dwarves remained, more than 80 of which where children. The situation seemed truly hopeless. 

Then the goblins came again. More than 80 invaders crossed the borders, *and this time they brought trolls.* 

Looking over the ruinous state of the walls and the gates, Sigun despaired. She ordered the civilians into the halls and arranged the threadbare remains of the militia in the compound courtyard. She knew they could not win, but she would not let the Deep Razors be forgotten.

The first half dozen trolls proved a powerful foe, but even bloody and miserable the dwarves proved their match. The last traps took their toll. Then came a score more. Sigun was last to fall of the dwarven warriors, swinging her axe left-handedly after losing the right. But then the defences were lost, the path to the mountain open.

What followed was a massacre. The corridors were cleared with brutal efficiency, leaving the enemy beasts covered in the blood of dwarven babies.

And thus anded the Deep Razors.

Their halls stand empty now, but for what the goblins left behind. The mountain remains a quiet tomb of cold rock.

Entry 1: I have been mayor of this quiet fort for just a couple years now. The land has been good to us, despite the foul sludge falling from the sky causing mass vomiting. We have colonized the first canyon, walling it off and protecting it. Cage and weapon traps protect us now, an army has started being trained and our industry and trade are booming.


Entry 2: We have dug deep, intimidated by the horrors spotted we decided to bypass the 2nd cave but have now arrived down at the 3rd and found magma. Magma forges have been setup and our steel and silver industries has taken off. However after a few ventures into the cavern my miners reported hearing a terrifying cry. As a safety percussion I recalled them back inside, added a wall, a door, several cage traps and a drawbridge to protect us from anything coming from it.


Entry 3: Dead Amok, I have seen the creature now wandering in the 3rd cavern. We have had our share of great beasts during our time here but this one was more dangerous than any other seen. A great quadruped, huge and made entirely out of diamond. Great Amok only knows how we could even begin to defend ourselves from the creature. For now we hide behind the traps, doors, and drawbridge and pray.


Entry 4: Several months have gone by and no sightings have been made of the diamond behemoth. I have deemed it safe and reopened the cave, sending out our miners and loggers to harvest its wealth that for so long have sat just out of reach.


Entry 4a: Oh god almighty... it was hiding. I have no idea how we missed it, or how it was able to hide but as soon as I had sent out my fellow dwarves I heard the screams. They came running back in as fast as possible. Reports stated the beast kicking with all 4 legs, with enough power to send a dwarf flying across a room, and shooting out sticky webs. Several dwarves have already died, never to return from the cave. I have reset the barricades hoping this will again stop it.


Entry 4b: No such luck this time, the beast has apparently decided to come into the fortress now. He has destroyed the door and runs right over the traps. He narrowly dodged an atom crushing blow with the drawbridge... but then utterly destroyed it. It is now loose in our home.


Entry 4c: We may have a chance after all. I have ordered our army down to engage the beast and buy us time. Meanwhile the beast is still below our magma forge levels.. meaning there is a flood of magma being held above him. After reports that the army was decimated, and under the council of my wiki mages who insured me that diamond was not a magma safe material, I ordered the floodgates to be opened.


Last Entry: This will be my final report, should anyone find this log. Run, run as fast and as far as possible from this place. We are not sure what happened but the magma flowed down the stairs we heard a terrifying pain filled roar. My fellow dwarves let out a victorious cheer, we had hurt the beast!


Then it came up from the stairwell. The gigantic diamond beast, stained with the blood and guts of dwarves, slightly burned, but now ON FIRE and covered in liquid hot magma slug!


The wiki mages were quickly executed for their incompetence, and I go now to join my fellow dwarves in our last defense of our home.

If I was an elf, what career would I be?"" and rolled, at which I tossed him a blank piece of notebook paper, and we started rolling characters.  For those that don't know, WHFRP is d10 based and has quickplay rules in which you randomize EVERYTHING.

Fast forward to the next day, and I've got him and two other friends at the table with me, each with characters - an elf scribe, elf thief, and dwarf militiaman - and I swear, the thief was doomed from the start.  We were simply playing through the pre-generated campaign intro, and by the end of the first fight, he was reduced to 2 HP while barely damaging his opponent due to a series of bad rolls.

This streak of poor rolls continued through the night up to the climax, where the party was facing a rogue mage in the middle of a summoning ritual, who happened to be guarded by four wolves.  The party had no luck talking the mage down, and the wolves would not allow the party to approach, and so violence ensued.  Two wolves went after the dwarf, and one each for the elves.  The scribe was smart enough to engage with his bow, but the thief was in melee range already.  Several rounds went by with chipping damage on either side, but very frequently everyone running back to back failures (and by failures I mean 90+ on percentile).

The thief was taking a beating and on the 6th round of combat, the wolf facing him crit on its attack.  A parry check was rolled, with a failure of 99.  We rolled on the crit table, and the thief's arm was demolished, forcing him to drop his weapon, and he fell to the ground, bleeding out.

He managed to pass the check to bleed completely out as the rest of the party (mostly the dwarf, due to some epic rolls) mopped up the remaining two wolves that were alive at this point, and they rushed up to the thief to attempt to heal him.  Only one more bleed out check was needed first, and so the dice were rolled... 00... 1.  Critical fail.  The player opted not to use his only fate point to try and avoid total death, and simply handed me the character sheet, saying no, it was meant to die from the start.

So, in a final gush of blood, the thief died as a demon rose up from the ritual flames and flew off.  The rogue mage collapsed and died, the ritual taxing her endurance beyond its limits.  The remaining two party members sadly lifted their companion's corpse into the bonfire, and then returned to the townsfolk they had been escorting to Middenheim.

So we have a new human character that the party will meet in Middenheim the next time we pick up again.  His career though?  Once again, randomized:  Thief.",Tabletop,False,self,t5_2wqgc,False,table,,True,t3_1csbzo,http://www.reddit.com/r/gametales/comments/1csbzo/wh_frp_the_doomed_thief/,

I was but a mere human warrior, at the time, if I recall correctly, dawdling about in Goldshire, tending to my business, no more higher level than probably 16. 

I overhear about someone starting a raid. A mage in his high-twenties, named ""[Virokai](http://www.warcraftrealms.com/charhistory/46293275)."" A name that I will never forget, and the blood that was shed in his name. 

He was the guild leader of ""The Empire,"" and knew how to rouse a crowd by simply the way he spoke. He said we should raid on the Horde. A level 27 mage. In Goldshire. Telling everyone. To go raid the Horde. And me, being incredibly fresh to WoW at the time, jumped at the chance. A real raid! There were more than twenty of us. Probably upwards towards a full raid of forty. 

His charisma stirred our spirits, and we would've followed him to the Burning Steppes and back had he asked us to.

Being in Goldshire, and being completely full of complete underleveled noobs who really thought we stood a chance at raiding the Horde, specifically Crossroads in the Barrens, we took the most logical route. Southwest out of Elwynn, down through Westfall, and south through the path... in Strangelthorn Vale... 

We were in a massive group. What could go wrong? Dozens of us. Besides I'd never even been there before, except maybe once or twice. But then I was alone, now I was in a group.

And it was absolute chaos. All around me, bodies were falling. People were shouting out in raid chat, ""Tigers!"" Tigers. Gorillas. Raptors. Oh God the raptors... They preyed upon us like field mice with our tails tied together.

With the raid leader himself only being level 27, you could imagine we aggro'd everything from Booty Bay to Duskwood. 

But we were determined. We wouldn't be stopped. So some of us shouted, ""Into the water!"" for safety. Beasts never went into water to fight. I remember this. So we all jumped in. We thought we had outsmarted them. But we were wrong. 

Piranha. Crocodiles. From the depths of the jungle sea, they killed us in the water, too. Dead bodies muddled the waters. And just as soon as we jumped in, there were more of us shouting, ""Out of the water!"" 

After the chaos died down, all that was left were the whispers of our ghosts, without a purpose now, but still being driven on. So we all ran down to Booty Bay as ghosts, and revived there. A genius plan. But now, we all had ressurection sickness. And we weren't patient. 

So we took the boat. To Crossroads. The lot of us. Underleveled. With ressurection sickness. Needless to say, only like 5 of us even made it to Ratchet. And by then, we were all pretty much ""fuck it,"" and went home. 

I am forever scarred by those memories. So many helpless players. Being misled by a charismatic wizard who promised us what every noob wants--to be a hero. 

I can't imagine the suffering those other 12-year-olds felt when we were all helplessly being slaughtered by the wild animals of the jungle. 

But I do know this--that Virokai ended up being a dick and quit at like level 61 so fuck that guy anyway. ",Video,False,self,t5_2wqgc,False,video,,True,t3_1bzaae,http://www.reddit.com/r/gametales/comments/1bzaae/my_first_wow_raid/,

A story of Tieflings and Tracheotomies",36,3,10,http://www.reddit.com/r/gametales/comments/1bkjrb/that_provokes_right_a_story_of_tieflings_and/,"So I was playing Pathfinder with my best friend as DM, and two guys we met off Reddit.  Our party was made up of a Halfling Rouge (played by me), a Human Fighter who wore an armored trench coat, and a Human Cleric who wanted to sex everything.

We were early in our campaign, still level one, and were tasked with finding the King's kidnapped daughter, which we accidentally succeeded in doing.  We found her bound and gagged inside a cave surrounded by four Tiefling Rouges, and battle was soon joined.  Thanks to some quick thinking, and a few lucky rolls, we quickly dispatched three of the four Tieflings, and we had the last one surrounded.  Now here is where the magic started:

DM: ""The Tiefling realizes he is screwed, and Coup de grâces himself with his knife. As you three start to walk towards the princess...""

Cleric: ""Wait, why did he kill himself?""

DM: ""He saw what you did to his friends, and decided to take the easy way out.  Anyways...""

Fighter: ""Ah man, I wanted a prisoner...""

Me:  ""...Does a Coup de grâce provoke?  That provokes, right?""

Laughter around the table.

""No, seriously, I think it does!  I attack him!""

DM: ""Wat.  Why?""

Me: ""Non-lethal, I want to knock him out!""

DM: ""Ok, sure, but you are at a -4 to hit, so I really doubt...""

*clack clack clack*

Natural 20.

DM: ""God, I hate you.  Ok, confirm.""


I roll again, not so well this time, 15 total, with the Tiefling having 14 AC, as we had learned earlier.

DM: Darn, you only do normal damage.  That suc-""

Fighter: ""No no, he crit!  We are flanking, so he only took a -2!""

DM: ""That still gives him 13, 1 short.  Like I said, that-""

Fighter: ""Bless.""  The DM had apparently forgotten the Bless spell cast at the beginning of the fight, which was still very much active.

DM: ""Fine, whatever!  You crit, but the Tiefling wasn't hurt, so I doubt-""

Me: ""8.  Max damage, doubled, so 16.""  16 was the exact HP of the Tiefling.

DM: ""...I hate all of you.""

So we bound up the Tiefling with the ropes from the princess, and began to head back to the castle, when the DM decided he had not given up.  Yet.

DM: ""Alright, since you guys don't have a guide, you will have to roll Survival to see if you can make it back.  But be careful, there are Tiefling-eating bears in these woods...""

*clack clack clack*

Natural 20 from the Fighter.(We had a home-rule that a natural 20 meant automatic success on skill checks, to keep things hilarious and interesting.)

The DM was silent for a second, and then sighed.  ""You find your way back perfectly, and avoid all the bears.  However..."" The DM started to perk up.

Me:  ""I check the Tieflings mouth.""

DM: ""What?  Why?""

Me: ""The tiefling just bit his own tongue off so we can't take him alive, didn't he?""

The DM was silent.  That was in fact exactly what had just happened.

After a quick healing from our Cleric (We decided that we shoved the tongue back in the mouth and healed the wound) the party realized we had a few options here: We could either make a contraption of a gag so that the Tiefling couldn't bite his tongue but could still breathe; we could have the cleric walk behind him constantly casting Cure Minor Wounds (in Pathfinder level 0 spells can be cast as often as you like) so he couldn't bite through his tongue again, or...

Cleric:  ""We are next to a river, right?""

DM: ""Yeah, and?""

Cleric: ""Are there reeds growing there?""

DM: Yeah, sure.  Why?""

Cleric:  We could preform a tracheotomy!  That way, he can't suffocate himself!""

The DM was aghast, and utterly refused to let us try it.  We ended up going with a combination of plan A and B, and got our prisoner back to the King for interrogation.

So a massive thank you all the posters, each of whom has overwhelmingly helped this launch become a huge success.

(I'd also like you to bear with the weird formatting you may see popping up now and then as I try to get my head around custom styling on Reddit - it's a lot of work, but a lot of fun)

From here onwards, however, we are at risk of losing our initial momentum quite quickly as the initial rush of posts fades, which is unfortunately common on new subreddits.

How can you help?

* **Become a regular poster** - If you find entertaining things happening to you a lot, keep posting. Even if the stories are from the same game each time, I guarantee people will never get tired of reading your tales.
* **Get the word out** - Almost every major game has it's own subreddit. It's too much work for me to post an announcement in each one, plus rather than me go in heavy-handedly, I'd far rather someone familiar with each community mention r/gametales themselves. If you are aware of a specific game subreddit, by all means post a polite message calling for submissions - It's worth noting that a lot of the posts here seem to be encouraging people to try out the games mentioned, so by posting here it's a great advert for a game. And if you see a good story when you are there, by all means cross-post it (with a credit to the storyteller)
* **Tabletop RPGs** - We're short of pen and paper RPG stories. The free-form nature of them makes them perfect candidates for posting. Any of these are more than welcome.
* **The wider internet** - By all means tell anyone anywhere else online or in your social networks who may be interested in joining in, or may have content not seen before on Reddit.

So thanks again everyone, and let's hope we can keep up the quality and quantity which we've achieved so far.

This weekend we tried to give her back to her people. They didn't really care a lot, so we continued on with her in tow on our quest to stop the plague demons. 

We entered into a room with giant braziers on each side of the room and a portcullis at the end of the room. On top of that is a ledge with some Dwarven cultists holding crossbows. In the middle of the room is a Dwarf summoner. The fight quickly begins as our group is the worst at trying to talk. The main tank and I charge the summoner right off the bat.

This wasn't a bad idea, but it wasn't the best. he was the only thing to tank and really do damage to. I wanted to down him as fast as I could. I hit him with my daily and did a high amount of damage. Already this fight is going better then the last one.

The fight really isn't anything special. Dwarfs shoot crossbows, some more enemies join the fight, etc. 

All of a sudden this summoner teleports into the brazier. he catches on fire and cackles. Confused, but determined, I charge in again to attack him and keep him busy. At this time the Dwarf, being the dick he is, teleports again. However this time he goes behind me and it causes fire damage to me, then knocks me into the fire and that causes more fire damage to me. Our Aritficer decides to be a hero and rolls a crit, dealing large damage. The summoner dies and we cheer. Then he comes back as an Elemental and we find out he was a bonded summoner. 

As he changes, he deals MORE fire damage at this point. I am weak, not doing so well. It becomes my turn and I quickly shift out of the fire. I am down to 4 hit points. This stupid boss deals ongoing 5 fire damage around him every turn at the start of his turn. If I don't kill him with this attack, I am knocked out. 

Roll my dice and I have a 17 on AC...it's a miss. I sigh, I feel the flames coming for me, and then I suddenly remember Warforged Tactics. I look at our DM and whisper ""Will a 18 hit him?"". 

YES IT WILL!!! I roll the damage and hit for 11, I kill the bastard. I was pumped. I cheered a bit and I punched the air a lot in victory. It was amazing. Then I am interrupted by our DM in the middle of my fist pumping to be informed ""As he dies he does 10 fire damage to everyone around him when he blows up"". 

I get knocked out and I quickly lost all the energy I just had. I know I am not dead, I know it is not a big deal, but man, does it make me sad.

1373938355.0,30,self.gametales,1idrd9,D&amp;D Horrible (or dumb) Death/Experience Memories,35,5,7,http://www.reddit.com/r/gametales/comments/1idrd9/dd_horrible_or_dumb_deathexperience_memories/,"Someone mentioned in /r/DnD in a thread to come here to talk about game deaths, so here I am.

So here are some short-ish stories of deaths I remember over my 10-ish years playing (all 3.x), and in no particular chronological order:

1) My first ever character was a Half-Orc Barbarian. It took me hours to put this character together while everyone else was going on with their game (I was new to the group). My first action was to cross a rope bridge. I rolled a 1 to cross and then a 2 to catch myself. The DM went ahead and gave me a third roll just to be nice and I rolled a 1 and plummeted to my death. For most it might have turned them away from the game, but the fact something that stupid could happen so fast made me fall in love with the game.

2) The last game I played with my old friends, I was playing an Avariel Monk. One character had a griffon as a flying mount. For whatever reason the character was losing control and the griffon was trying to fight them off its back. I went in trying to get control of the situation, another character looked as if I was trying to attack the person on the griffon and everyone on the ground started attacking me.
Luckily I made good saves and had good AC (and deflect arrows), but there was only one way this was gonna end. I think they were trying to kick me from the group for some reason, but never found out what was going on.
So basically after a bunch of flyby attacks and use of rope and whatnot I was able to take down the entire group without killing them, left them tied naked to a tree, took all their stuff, and since I had a Vow of Poverty, I went around the countryside donating all their crap to the less fortunate and never played with them, or talked to them ever again.

3) Recently I made a pretty hardcore defensive Aasimar Paladin with great AC and all that jazz. Come across a Drow riding a giant lizard, and with a crit (and a different crit table ruleset we use), the spear broke my shield and almost killed me. I shouted for the party to retreat while I took off running. One came with me, the other stayed, so being the Paladin, I had to go back and try to save them...got grappled and sat on by a lizard while another giant lizard dragged the one away I was trying to save, then I was killed.

4) Just prior to the Aasimar Paladin, I had a Tiefling Rogue. Found a pit in a dungeon that was a dirt floor and on the far side from us was a pile of coins and a weapon sticking out of the top. I go down and around the center (in case something was in the middle of the area), and one of the other characters is right on my ass the entire time. I lift the weapon, coins shift, and suddenly a big ass cockroach comes out of the ground (can't remember the monster, but I think they showed up in Baldur's Gate a few times as well). I get another bad crit and am bit in half in one shot and am dead. Other character gets pretty messed up, but no 20's dropped on him and they survive.

5) The latest death was me playing a Wild Elf Sorceror (that was really build more for assisting another player that stopped playing). Had another Elf in the group as well as I think a Human. We are surrounded by spiders, I had Shield, Armor, etc up so I was pretty decent on defenses, so I figure ""I know elves are immune to sleep spells"" so I drop a sleep centered on us, risking the other player falling asleep so we can kill all the spiders.
Didn't realize (as a player or a character) that spiders are also immune to sleep (I am someone who doesn't read monster entries as a player, because I hate meta-gamers) and none of the spiders are effected, the other character gets put to sleep, I am tackled from behind by a spider and again one-shot with a crit, the sleeping character gets killed, and the other elf takes off from the dungeon.

Welp, those are my major things I can remember involving my own characters. I know there are more though since I have a stack of dead character sheets that I write across diagonally in dark pencil stuff like (SWORDED) or (COCKROACHED) or (LIZARDED).",Tabletop,False,self,t5_2wqgc,False,table,,True,t3_1idrd9,http://www.reddit.com/r/gametales/comments/1idrd9/dd_horrible_or_dumb_deathexperience_memories/,

Allow me to tell you a tale that my best friend passed on to me from his brothers days playing in a Dungeons and Dragons 3rd Edition Campaign.

The sun sat on the orcish encampment,  the ranger strung his bow and let loose an arrow.  The sentry fell to the ground. 

They moved in, slowly, stealthy,  quiet and quick.

One by one they fell, until at last they reached the leaders tent. The rogue slipped around back and slit the tent and went inside to find the orc passed out drunk.

The rest of the group came in and was just about ready to slit his throat when the wizard spoke up.

Let's take him alive.

They all turned and peered at him, the most intelligent in the party just suggested taking one of the most sickeningly violent orcs they have ever come across as a captive.  An orc whose strength and capacity in battle was only matched by his sheer stupidty as well.

He stated he wished to conduct experiments on him.

And they tied him up, brought him back to the wizards tower. He was kept in the dungeons for months, never seen by the party again until one day.

He comes walking out the front door.

The party readies until they see the wizard walking behind him.

They are all confused as you might expect, so they ask what he had done to control the monster.

""A little magic and a few hours of being hit in the head with this (holds up wooden club) every day until now""

The wizard had beaten him in the head so much and so often, he dropped from 4 int to 2 int.

Landon Bremring’s Journal

With rings on fingers (the two of us, Callum of course abstaining from the gifts produced by the girls), we headed out to the Hermes Courier company – we were damn sure that the message for our village would be delivered, and that the reinforcements we needed would arrive.
We arrived at the Hermes Courier company and after a short delay in which Zazas managed to make both a gnome joke and an accountant joke to the surly gnome accountant in charge and received a shocking grasp for his troubles, we were on our way. There were to be ten guards in our caravan – the three of us, the three drivers, and seven others from a mercenary gang known as The Sirens.

To say that I had my thumb and forefinger around Zazas’ left ear for the entire time would be an understatement. Although to be fair, his attempts to impress the women mercenaries did have its own benefits – the giant venison he caught on the first night being prime example of this.

The trip continued with a minimum of fuss – we integrated, as well as we could.
On the final night, the first watch was mine, and it continued without incident. The second watch, handled by the always-aware Zazas, was interrupted by a crossbow bolt puncturing his chest.
I awoke with a start – the ring on my finger was quite literally burning me, and a force that I can only assume was the ring was basically pulling me towards Zazas’ prone body.

Crossbow bolts whistled past as another sentry yelled “ALARM!” and roused everyone from their sleep. One of the Sirens was performing first aid as I skidded in and cast a cure spell and yanked the crossbow out of his lung, pulling him back to the fight at hand.
Being as terrible at combat as I am, I pointed out targets to the rest of the guards and with no great delay, and finished them off summarily. And up until this point, I’d forgotten that there was a five silver piece bounty on every bandit killed – and the proof was in the toes.

Didn’t need breakfast after that.
On our final day, we pulled up to the gates of the capital. And I knew that customs was bad at silverwater, but this was another world of delay – four hours of waiting.
As we got closer to the gate, we worked out why – ten paladins of Iomedae, searching every part of every trailer.
When we got to the gate, the drivers got us to stand aside as they dealt with customs. The paladins went through, and searched the carts. In the second cart, they look through the crates containing our gear and they pull one out, placing it on the ground.
This was the first sign that things were going to be more complicated than they appeared.

Our cart was pulled over to the side of the gate, and we guards were asked to identify the belongings contained in the crate.

Mine.

I was summarily bundled into a jail cart, with my crate placed on top, watching the rest of the Hermes cart receding into the distance – not a fantastic situation to be in.

The day rolled away in relative boredom. Well, not relative boredom, total boredom – I was left in a jail cart with two other suspected criminals, and anyone who opened their mouth (mainly one smuggler by the name of Steven Danzig, who came in with a few bruises and left with many more). I had a suspicion at this point that the only reason that they held me up was that damn cloak.

Sunset fell, and the cart was dragged into the city, past a massive barricade of wood and steel circling the paladin’s tower. We were forced to hand over all of our gear and jewellery, including my signet ring.
Roughly an hour was spent in relative silence before I was dragged to a windowless stone room, and a female cleric of Iomedae sitting at a steel table  with several of my possessions on them – but not the cloak, interestingly enough.

“Sit,” she said, and I did so.

“What’s your name?” She asked after I was seated.

“Landon Bremring, ma’am.”

“And where are you from, Landon?”

“Shortwheat.”

“And where is that located?”

“Two days walk from Silverwater, which is about six to seven days south of here.”

“And what are the common exports of Shortwheat?”

“Wheat, occasionally  tobacco when we can grow it, but mostly wheat.”

“What are your parent’s names?”

“Martha Bremring is my mother, and Ian Bremring is my father.”

""And what are their occupations?""

""They're both farmers.""

“And what is your occupation?”

“Novitiate cleric.”

“And do you have any understanding of why you are here?”

“Either religious persecution, or that cloak. Probably the cloak, as history shows that religious persecution is often preceded by more corpses on bonfires. Or longswords,” I said, staring at the blade at her side.

“What’s your relationship with the Hindmarsh family?”

“She is a sponsor. Of sorts,” I answered,  suddenly nervously aware of the possibilities that my entanglement with the three noble girls (and my more intimate entanglement with Rebecca Hindmarsh, of the same family) might have provided.

“Care to explain further?”

“Can I say it’s complicated and Calistrian in nature, would that be enough?”

She frowned at that, no doubt understanding the implications and some of the complexities of our dealings.
“Well, Landon, I’ve sent off a missive to the Hindmarsh family, and they will be in contact with your sponsor in Silverwater. In the meantime, you are advised to stay here. We will also verify the nature of this,” she says, taking the cloak from the table.

Hours passed, and eventually, the cleric returned.
“The house of Hindmarsh has verified your identity. Because of your connections, particularly to House Hindmarsh, who supplies the entirety of the weaponry for our paladin orders for the war raging to the west. As you can imagine, this leaves us unable to prosecute you for the violation of the law. Not that we had much to go on - that cloak was just magically treated, and was not magical or dangeous in the slightest.”

“For carrying a questionable cloak that I didn’t know was illegal?”

“Ignorance of the law is not a defense.”

“You just wanted to hang someone, don’t you!?” I yelled at her.

“We need a win. We need someone to pin this on, from that cart group. We can’t pin it on the mercs, because if we do, we lose their trust. We can’t pin it on you. We can’t pin it on your ranger friend, Zamith-“

“Zazas. Half-elf.”

“Zazas, because of his ties to another noble family, is also off the table, which leaves your other friend, Callum.”

“And why him?”

“Firstly, lack of choices. Secondly, he’s been causing quite a stir, trying to get through our barricade to see his knight friends. He’s threatened violence to a number of people, caused a great deal of damage, and has lied to gain egress to our facilities. Given enough time, it’s assumed that he would cause a great deal of strife and problems in our city. Thirdly, at this time, the citizens need to be reminded that we are being vigilant and that what’s being enacted is for their safety.”

“So you want me to throw Callum under the horse in exchange for… what?”

“What do you need?”

And this began the negotiations. For what it’s worth, for posterity now and when I’m an old man handing this to my children, I hate myself for this, and I hope that one day I will have the strength to find people like this – those who would make the laws destroy those who are innocent.

If sort of a dick.

In total, I managed to get thirty city guards sent to Shortwheat to deal with the hydra problem, and they’ll be leaving in two days. I headed back to the Golden Stag, but before I went in and my escort left, they handed me a letter.
Opening it up, I took a look inside, and inside was a letter of recommendation and a note.

*“Train up, and when you’re ready, head west. We could use someone like you.”*
Signed by one High Inquisitor Mellon.

My jaw dropped at this point, and I hastily stuffed the letter back into the envelope and into my bag, and headed inside.

Inside, it wasn’t hard to identify my companions – Zazas lounging back in a booth, cup going from lips to table to lips again, massive grin on his face, and Callum, sitting there brooding, single cup of water sitting in front of him. I headed over and sat down.

“So where did you get off to?” asked Zazas.

“Finding our reinforcements. We’re heading back to Shortwheat with a complement of thirty city guards, and we’re going to handle the problem.”

“You’re joking, right?”

“No. I figure we can leave tomorrow morning, head back, spend some time with our partners back in Silverwater, get supplied-“

“I’m not going back there.” Callum’s voice cut in.

“And why would I put my neck in danger? We can’t handle a hydra.” Zazas chimed up.

“Put it this way. Remember how excited we all were when we got that money from the salvage from the goblins? We show up here with a hydra hide, and the amount of money that it’s worth would make the girls’ families do the exact same thing. Remember what the girls said about us being destined for great things? This would be proof.”
“Alright, I’m in. Let’s kill ourselves a hydra.”

There is a small group of rebels, but they are unarmed and need more supporters before they can attack and kill the king.

It is a two-man campaign, and they're the only people in the city that have weapons other than the guards, their first mission is to break into an armoury without the king knowing so he can't squash them like a bug before the revolution even begins.

As they approach they see that it isn't only an armoury, but also an airbase harbouring two airships. The PCs decide that they want an airship, and won't take no for an answer.

There are three guards and a kobold. One guard (G1) is overseeing the others, another (G2) is repairing the hull of an airship and the third (G3) is testing the steering of the other airship. The kobold (K) is scampering about on the balloons trying to find cuts and repairing them.

Our resident rogue brings out his bow and shoots at G3, missing him. G1 yells at G3 to leave in the airship and tell the king that civilians are trying to arm themselves. G2 pushes the button that opens up the roof so airships can leave and G3 cuts one of the four ropes tying down the ship. K jumps from atop the balloon onto the deck of G3's ship and starts cutting ropes himself.

Our heroes run at the second airship and jump onboard, as does G2, they all start cutting ropes and Before long both ships are in the air. G1 jumps at the PC's airship and grabs onto the edge.

Our rogue is trying his best to steer the ship so the swordmage is left to do the fighting. He goomba stomps G1's hands and he falls out of reach of the ship, leaving one enemy on their ship. The swordmage swings at G2 and hits flesh, K notices and leaps from G3's ship onto the PC's. He fails miserably and falls to his death, hitting his face on the hull as he goes down.

G2 attacks the swordmage and manages to knock his sword out of his hand, sticking out of the deck several feet away. The swordmage dives for it and sticks it in his scabbard, pulling out his bow.

The rogue fails a pilot check for the first time. It's a critical miss.

Their ship veers out of control and smashes into the other airship, gashing the balloon. the PC's ship starts losing altitude, G2 calls to G3 to lower the ship, G3 matches the PC's altitude and throws a bomb onto their deck. SMall spikes emerge from it, sticking it to the deck and they can hear ticking. G2 leaps to his ship, barely missing. He swings his halberd up and it hooks on the edge of the ship. The rogue abandons his ship and easily jumps to G3's. (Let me just say, at this point I legitimately thought the swordmage wasn't going to survive) The swordmage drops his bow and realizes that it's too late to jump to the other ship so he goes below deck to search for a parachute.

The rogue stomps G2's feet and he falls, but G3 bullrushes him and knocks him off the edge, he manages to catch the halberd that's still sticking out of the ship and pulls himself up.

The swordmage frantically rips open boxes looking for something, fonding only gunpowder,and weaponry, when he comes across boxes that are supposed to be airdropped in to warzones. They have parachutes attached to the top. He runs back onto the deck and finds the lever that opens the hatch. The ticking gets louder and he sprints to the back of the ship and throws himself over the edge as it explodes.

The rogue tries to throw the final guard off the edge but the guard turns the tables and throws the rogue off. Violently. The rogue sees the ship exploding and boxes falling out and makes his way over to them.

The swordmage is falling through the sky, he manages to reach a box and just barely holds on. He rips the cord, opening the parachute and is almost thrown off. Another falling box smashes into him and smashes open his box, countless parachutes fall out, he grabs hold of one and sees the rogue falling, he passes it to him and waits for impact.

They both hit the ground and the rogue lands in the middle of a market. He steals a bow and sees a ""Brand new! BUY BUY BUY"" item, explosive arrows. Grabbing several he goes off at a sprint, chasing the ship.

He gets close enough for his liking and loads an arrow into the bow. He takes aim at the disappearing airship.

Natural. Fucking. Twenty.

The arrow soars through the sky and strikes the hull of the airship, igniting the gunpower. It explodes in a ball of fire, sending debris in every direction.

Part 2 is [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/gametales/comments/1i2zkg/pathfinder_part_2_wherein_the_party_flees_pursuit/)

The party approached a modestly sized town along the river, having moved on from where we last left off.  They've rested, healed, and have learned about each other to some extent (in game - IRL we've all known each other for the better part of a decade).  They realized they can't all go in to town - there's no reason a half-orc would have such a menagerie of slaves, and none of them bound.  To allay any suspicions, they circled around to the landward-side of town, several miles out in to the hills, and sent in Ashok the half-orc to take care of business.

Ashok took the armor and a few other items they'd looted from their slain enemies to sell, hoping to also buy a few supplies.  His first stop was the tavern, however, where he heard rumors of various building activities to the south...  but nothing about his own escape yet.  He paied for his beer from the meager coins they had, and made his way to a blacksmith in town to sell the spare weapons and armor, spinning a tale about being a journeyman blacksmith traveling after the death of his master.  On his way out of the smith's shop, though, Ashok saw a familiar guard from his home town, and realized that the ship they saw a few days ago was still here!  He stopped briefly at a shop on his way out of town to get a few essentials (including a map), then started heading back to the rest of the party, breaking out in to a run as soon as he was out of sight of town.

Mike the halfling had climbed a scrub-tree to give the party some forewarning about the cleric's return, and seeing him legging it set the rest of the party on edge.  Ashok's arrival was followed shortly by signs of pursuit from the town - no numbers, but a rising dust cloud headed in their direction, so they took off in to the hills.  After an hour or so of running (they couldn't move particularly quickly thanks to Ashok's armor, Reirret the gnome found a small cave opening in the back side of hill, and they entered, hoping to shake their hunters.  The cave was cool and dark, a welcome respite after their exertions, but luck was not with them.  A [bugbear](http://paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderChronicles/PZO1107-Bugbear.jpg) made this cave his home, and so they party fought.  It was a short, brutal fight, the bugbear swinging its deadly spiked mace with skill, but he was brought down by a well placed punch from Reirret's spiked gauntlet.

The companions explored the cave briefly, almost missing a trap that would have caused grievous injury, and found the chamber they were in was the only substantial portion.  There was another tunnel leading back towards town, and a slight downhill slope leading to a swiftly flowing, icy underground river.  The party rested, ate cold rations, and slept for the night listening closely for any sounds of intruders.

The next morning they awoke to a dull boom echoing off the cavern walls.  Dust fell from the ceiling, and more dust billowed from the tunnel that led towards town.  A cave-in?  No, too coincidental.  This was shortly followed by crackling sounds coming from the other entrance, and the smell of smoke which soon grew heavy in the cave.  Mike crept around the corner towards the entrance to see a very smokey fire and a wall of spears pointing in towards the cave - they'd been found!  The party held a quick discussion in the quickly warming room and decided that the numbers against them were too great to defeat, and so they decided to take their chances with the underground river, as it was at least an unknown fate against the certain death of staying or fighting.  Quickly preparing themselves by the glow of Ceal's ""Light"" spell, they waterproofed what they could of their provisions and tied themselves off on a length of rope so they couldn't be separated.  One by one they gave themselves up to fate and slipped in to the cold, rushing blackness.

1367339913.0,33,self.gametales,1df47a,[Starwars Empire At War: Forces of Corruption MULTIPLAYER] The almost win. And shitty hosts.,38,5,19,http://www.reddit.com/r/gametales/comments/1df47a/starwars_empire_at_war_forces_of_corruption/,"So here's how it went down. I'm on Starwars EAW:FoC multiplayer. Sadly, there are only 17 or so people online. (Still pretty good considering how old the game is) so me and my buddy Skype and set up a lobby. It's gonna be a space battle, empire vs rebellion, above the planet hoth.

We already have our ""assignments"", my buddy is going to buy the base upgrades and me and everyone else wil spam ships and what not. 

We all start with two squadrons of X-wings. The empire starts with TIE fighters, same number of squadrons for each person. Each side also gets a space station, and it's shared between all the teammates. Buying ships is player specific, meaning only that player who bought the ship gets it. But all upgrades to the station are universal, so all the players can buy it and get affected by it.

My team (the rebellion(also it's a 4v4 match, which is sweet but a little laggy)) begin flying towards the resource asteroids. Now, in space battles, as in every game of this type, the asteroids are the resource pads, gatherers, whatever you wanna call them. They also have defense platforms near them to provide basic defense. These platforms can build a dual laser turret, a dual concussion missile launcher (basically just standard missiles, (with the perk that they ignore shields and do direct hull damage), or a missile jamming platform (just causes missiles and torpedoes to fly in loops and hit nothing in a small circular area).

I build my asteroid resource pad and build a laser turret. The laser turrets are great against fighters, and decent against small capital ships. My friend has done the same by this point, same setup. Another teammate has done so as well. The last teammate (for some odd yet good reason) sent out his x-wings to scout out space to look for the enemy space station.

My friend had bought the station upgrade and it was done upgrading. We now had access to Corellian Corvettes (the anti-fighter class of ships). I proceeded to buy 4 of them because I knew the fighter spam was going to happen soon. But I saved them in my reinforcements panel for later. Now wasn't the time to show my cards. 

At this time, our teammate who had gone searching for trouble found it. The enemy space station was level 2 and it immediately began firing on his x-wings. The enemy fighters in the area went after them as well.

The jig, for the empire, was up.

As soon as our teammates fighters were destroyed, TIE fighters and bombers began to assault my resource asteroid. Well crap. I need that guys. Thankfully, my teammates hyper spaced in some corvettes and nebulon-b frigates (our station had been upgraded to level 3 by this time). But what we didn't see were the acclamator cruisers sitting, waiting, in the fog of the map. 

So the fight began.

There were only 2 to begin with. They were colored red, for the enemy teammate. (Each player had his/her distinct color). As soon as they began firing on my teams ships, 5 more of these cruisers warped in to the fight zone. Now, in case you don't know, one perk/spiteful thing about these accalmators is that they have fighter bays. These bays hold 2 squadrons of TIE fighters and 1 of bombers. As soon as the cruisers warped in they began disgorging these fighters and bombers. 

But while they had the initiative, I had the proverbial Sword to their dagger. The fighting was taking place very near to the edge of the map, leaving the enemy 0 room to maneuver. But there was shuts enough space for me to turn the tide. Just enough space for me to warp on 4 nebulon-b cruisers and 4 Corellian corvettes. We had their units sandwiched in between 9 nebulon-b frigates and 12 Corellian corvettes. Their fighters wings were decimated, and the shields of their cruiser began to collapse, one by one. While we were hitting them hard, the wild beast becomes ferocious when backed into a corner. They unleashed salvos of turbo laser fire and torpedoes. Their corvettes similarly attacked our fighters. I began to hear my nebulon-b frigate captains screaming that their shields were down. There wasn't much I could do. It was a brawl. And when you brawl in this game, you BRAWL. Its all in, all or nothing.

I decided it was a good time to buy some new units we had access to. The fight was in our favor, and while we would take hideous losses, they would lose their entire attack force. Or so, we thought...

I bought 3 of our shiny new assault cruisers. These puppies had a pair of overcharged turbo laser batteries with two laser cannon batteries as well. They were designed for battle. Born for it. I had all 3 built and ready to go. But I saved them, like before, for the right moment.

That moment came immediately. 

The original battle was to the far right. But we neglected the left flank...and they used that to warp in an entirely new strike force. And it was heading right for our space station.

Everyone else units had been committed elsewhere. I was the only one with available units. And as I had shiny new cruisers, they did as well. Victory class star destroyers. These guys also had hanger bays like their little brothers and (you guessed it) they began popping out fighters and bombers like Octo-mom did with kids.

Now. Warp in now.NOW. all 3 assault cruisers warped in, right in the middle of their formation. Target rich environment. All 4 batteries for each cruiser started firing, at any target. I warped in corvettes for anti fighter protection. 

The battle on the far right was over and won, and all our damaged units realized we had another fight on our hands. They began to trudge over to where I was holding the line. And by holding, I mean barely barely BARELY. and by line, I meant ball of yarn. Lasers flying left, right, up and down, slant ways and what not. Fighters shooting fighters, TIE's, x-wings, all spinning out and exploding. Cruisers frantically firing everything they had at the enemy. Corvettes exploding under immense turbo laser barrages. But i was holding the line. 

Soon rebellion frigates and corvettes and fighters began pouring into the raging firestorm. Those 6 shiny new Victory cruisers began to lose their luster. Turbo laser batteries destroyed, shield knocked offline, hanger bays imploding. Soon those white wedges of terror began to snap, break, and fall towards the planets below, one by one. The cost of this attack? Empire lost 6 victory cruisers, and 7 tartan patrol cruisers(empire equivalent of a Corellian corvette) and numerous squadrons of fighters. Rebellion losses: 2 already severely damaged frigates, 4 corvettes, 4 x-wing squadrons and 3 y-wing squadrons(y-wings are bombers). We knew where their base was. And so, the massive rebellion force began splitting up, forming a 3 pronged attack going left, right, and up the middle, with my shiny, new assault cruisers leading the way. 

And the base assault began. This was a war of attrition, and the empire didnt have much set up. 

Then the star destroyers came. They had a level 5 star base...

The behemoths of durasteel and death began ripping apart our formations of frigates and corvettes. 3 of them. 3 was all they needed to stall our advance...

But not for long. Remember, I focused on ship building, and my friend focused on upgrading the station. Station level 5. Guess what that means? Mon calamari cruisers. The rebellions star destroyer equivalent. I had 3. And since my teammates had picked up the same idea I had, they each had 1 or 2. I decided to do what I had done earlier. Make a a sandwich with imperial turkey covered on turbo laser mayo, in between to slices of mon calamari bread. I warped in all the mon cal cruisers behind the imperials. 

It was a slaughter. 

Their fighter cover was substantial, and their bombers effective. They destroyed 3 of my assault cruisers and severely damaged the rest. My corvettes had been mowed down by this time. Thankfully, my teammates had some to spare. My mon cal cruisers fared the best, with them losing maybe one turbo laser battery, or only slight damage to any hard points. 

But the empire wasn't done yet. They had more star destroyers, and as we began to assault their station, they warped them in. 4 more. One for each teammate? I had no clue, I couldn't see the colors nor did I care WHO'S they were. Just that they were there. 

I sent a mon cal cruiser to each one I could, but left one to attack their station. I sent my remaining corvettes ahead to do a bomber sweep and remove as much of the fighter cover as I could. And again, I held the line. That was all I needed to do. Destroying their base would be an automatic win for the rebellion. We have them clutched. Their star destroyers can't get in close enough to adequately defend the base. Only 5 hard points to go. Only 5. 4....3....





Then the match crashed.



I sat there staring at my screen. ""You have lost connection to the match""
It was all I could do not to scream and cry. Everyone got booted from the match. 

You know what hey say about all good things. They must end. And while it didn't end the way I wanted it to (I'm still really really freaking pissed) I was happy and satisfied knowing that, we would have won. And that maybe, just maybe...I had saved the day for the rebellion.

Hope you enjoyed the story. :)

I go through character creation, make an Elven Rogue and start. The first adventure was basically us hunting dire wolves. We find a den, we hear something and i turn to the group and say, I can sneak in there and report back how many. They agree, I go ahead. I sneak in, see 4 wolves and 1 dire wolf and think ""They don't notice me, I could get a crit and maybe damage one"" So I go ahead and aim for the dire, shoot, hit...and proceed to piss it off. It then comes after me and crits me on it's first hit. Remember now, my party has no clue what is even going on. They're waiting on me to report back. Also, I have -1 con mod and have a total of 10 health. The crit took me down to -6. The fight goes on, my party finds me, I somehow lived. Since then on, even if I try to hide, the first hit against me has been a crit and i have like no health. I guess it must be beginner's luck.

Me and a buddy decided to try out a DarkRP server on gmod. We got a little money, we couldn't really grasp the concept of RP, so we just hid in the abandoned subway. We looked around, the subway system was humongous, so it took a little bit before we found something interesting. We eventually found what seemed to be an abandoned gang hideout, money printers and drug labs all around. We took what we could from the printers, which surmounted to two or three thousand dollars. After about ten more minutes of searching, I found the exit. Me and my buddy climbed out of the abyss that was the city subway, and into the city plaza. That was when we were more accustomed to the DarkRP features, so we went around looking for interesting jobs, but found none. Then we found the option to make our own job.
       That was when a brilliant job popped into my friend's head. We would become Jehovah's Witnesses. So with our new job and twenty-five-hundred dollars, we set up a church dedicated to our affairs. Decked out with a relatively large praying area near the main square, we told another buddy about our exploits. At that point he joined the game, came to our church, was baptized, and became a drug dealer. So, we were a church of two priests and a fixer. Nonetheless, we carried on, spreading the word of Jesus at day and growing marijuana at night. After a while we started to rack up quite the fortune. We had been experiencing robbers at the time, and there were no guards available at the time. So I went to my local gun dealer and bought a couple shipments of firearms. What might look like an innocent god-loving society of preachers turns out to be the biggest gang on the block.

when all of those men who live today's fathers were not even sperm in the sacs of their fathers, there was an orphaned elf by the name of Aza Alarin.
The orphaned elf was an apprentice for an apothecary in Greendale, and spent most of his days cleaning up, begging for change, and taking care of an easily-angered old drunkard by the name of Thaadius Winsor. In exchange for a place to stay and food in his belly, he would play the part of housekeeper and glorified slave in the unbridled hopes of one day learning a trade he really had no interest in (but beggars can't be choosers, now can they?).

One fateful morning, Thaadius Winsor sent delivery to the Elvish City Fort Lheao in the providence of the Seanchanni in the Southern Wood. The delivery, he marked, was ""of extreme importance"" with promises of lashing the payment out of him if he were to lose it... But promises of recognition if he were to deliver it.
It was a potion meant for a Lord there. A rare, experimental potion that was to cure any wound or ailment no matter how severe.

As it so happened, while travelling through those thickened woods, the youngling elf's ears picked up on sounds from the distance and an uneasy feeling vibrated down his body (the kind which he used to get when his father would cast spells). Curious, Aza diverted from the well-worn path to investigate. There, in the Southern Wood, is when Aza laid eyes upon a most beautiful High Elf, bloodied and surrounded by a pack of dead Dire Wolves.

Then, from nowhere, Aza was drawn on by others whom had heard the noises. Realizing he was just a youngling and the other High Elf was near death, demanded his money, his package, or his life. Deciding that none of those were rather pleasant options, Aza decided to make a third option - using a spell his father taught him to use in dire emergencies, he blanketed the area in a thick fog and dragged the High Elf to safety in the chaos.

Despite warnings, and no repercussions to be had for his inaction, Aza Alarin cracked open the salve and applied it to the wounds on the female. But she did not awaken. For a day and a half he gathered berries and hunted using the little spells he knew, and fed her as best he could. Upon the third day, she would regain consciousness and inquire about the events past. That High Elf would introduce herself as Shival Hakor, married to the Elven King Matrim Hakor.

Aza Alarin introduced himself as the son of Tucker Alarin and explained the events of the last few days.

Shival, being taken aback by the use of magic of a Youngling and the outright generosity he showed for someone he knew nothing of, went with the Young Elf's help to Fort Lheao and sent word for Aza's internship to be released from Mr. Winsor. She, out of her influence as Queen, provided him comfort and a home to live in. After indulging him in the depths of Elvish society once more, she began observing the youngling from a distance to see his actions via magic.

Every night, Aza would sneak out of his room, cast Featherfall to land quietly, and climb up the side of one of the taller buildings to count the stars and weave spells... Seemingly out of the blue with no words nor materials.
He would then return to the bottom of the window, cast a spell to throw himself up again, and pull himself into the window and sleep the next day.

One night, Shival Hakor invited the young Aza to her observatory to view the stars and to cast magic. When she inquired about his skill, he remarked that his dad and his family had always been able to use magic. And, when remarked about the stars, he said:

*""My mother always told me that the Stars were those we loved watching out for us from the afterlife. Every man and woman is a star. And, as they gaze upon us, we should gaze upon them.""*

Finally understanding the plight that the boy faced, and inspired by the child-like innocence when it came to magic, she sent to her husband that she would return with the Youngling for a period of time to the Ignis Faatus, the Magical Guild that sat upon the tower at the top of the Laboo Wilderness. After a weeks' ride, they became known at the magical guild and she settled him in with the finest instructors known in the realms, then resumed her position as a sitting adviser to the then-head of the Ignis, River Delphinius.

And from there, time and time again, wars would be fought and won - or lost - and evil would rise and fall. As Aza grew up and as Shival Hakor eventually resumed her name as Shival Felwind, he slowly became attached to the woman whom had changed his life.

Nothing came to fruition until the second time Aza Alarin would save Shival Felwind's life: The day the Abyss was nearly opened and those beings that haunt the chaos of Xel nearly slipped out and infected the world with Chaos.

During the fight with the Unholy Order of Xel (a cult dedicated to opening a gate to Xel and releasing Chaos unto the world) Shival Felwind became surrounded by the chaotic energies, herself defenseless since she was maintaining a spell to keep the gate sealed. Aza, the once-youngling now younger elf, waded through the corrupting energies and cast a ward about them both. The energies would eat at the muscles on his legs, making him eventually fall from his feet but maintaining the spell all the while.

After the battle was over, and the Chaos dispelled, Aza collapsed. This time, he was the one awakening later and asking about what time had been lost.

Shival Felwind was not there, for it would be inappropriate of a High Wlf of her position to show bend toward any common elf, but one of the Healers at the Ignis said that she had spent every night at his bedside - but not to tell her that because he was content with keeping his eyes open and working late (for whatever reason, Aza didn't ask nor did he care). But, as Aza tried to rise, he noticed that his legs failed him and that he could not walk on his left one.

He was told that the corruption permanently disfigured him, and that there was nothing that could be done. He would never use that leg again.

After hours, when a hushed silence would fall upon the infirmary and darkness would veil the eyes of sleeping mages, he would close his eyes and listen with his Elvish ears. Each night, a familiar shuffling of feet would resound and sit beside his bedside. And, each morning, they would leave. He had no doubt in his mind it was Shival, but he would never confront her about it.

One day, Aza Alarin would awaken to an unusual site. Someone had left him a specific object at the base of his bed: an animated rag-doll in his likeness. Aza smiled, knowing of only one enchantress who could weave life like that magic into fabric in imitation of life.

When he confronted her later on, Shival called him a fool and asked him:

*""Do you want to be a star so badly that you'd kill yourself for it?""*

To which Aza replied:

*""I find life much more bearable being the star looking down upon you than you the star looking down on me.""*

And that was the moment when Aza looked out into the stars for a moment, contemplating life and its meaning, when he first received a loving embrace and a gentle kiss from Shival Felwind.

From then on, no matter what the situation arose, she and he would hold that moment in time as pivotal moments in their lives. Aza would fall in love abroad and bare children, Shival would marry multiple times - both would fight wars and destroy evil that threatened the world... But, they would always share that moment and several others like it. Hidden from the world and in secret:

1368860838.0,32,self.gametales,1ekf58,[Blood Bowl: LE] Last Meal vs. Arnheim Seahawks (game explained for the unfamiliar),35,3,10,http://www.reddit.com/r/gametales/comments/1ekf58/blood_bowl_le_last_meal_vs_arnheim_seahawks_game/,"First a bit of introduction to the game of Blood bowl. Skip to the repeated dashes if you know how the game works. I should warn you this is not a tale of triumph over another person but over inexperience, a dastardly computer, and a Random Number God full of wroth.

Blood Bowl is a turn based fantasy football game. As the name implies, however, that's not totally accurate. For one thing, killing opposing players is a viable strategy, and most of the races are taken straight from the Warhammer universe (not 40K).

So, a bit of background about how this game works. Each turn you can move each player once, or have a player ""block"" once, which is to engage in tackling and fisticuffs with an adjacent player. However, there are certain special actions to take into account. Each turn, you may have one player **Blitz**, which is to move and block; similarly, you may have a player in possession of the ball hand off to an adjacent player at ridiculously reduced risk once. 

Dice rolling is the real core of the game. It is by no means a gambling game, it is a risk management game. You want to get as much done as optimally as possible, then take the least risky and most valuable options, then finish with stuff that's nice but not critical. The reason for this is, any time you fail a die roll, save a small selection of unusual die rolls, your turn is immediately ended by a **Turnover**.

There are two broad strategies that you can classify a team into in Blood Bowl, which I call Meat Grinder and One Two Touchdown. Some teams, such as Goblins and Halflings, don't fit these, but they're not relevant to the story.

**One Two Touchdown**: I'm explaining these guys first as they're pretty much a normal football team. OTT teams perform a three step combo: 1) get the ball 2) hurl the ball to a catcher near the end zone 3) touchdown. Interceptions and blocks on the ball carrier are the bane of an OTT team's existence.

**Meat Grinder**: These teams suck at handling the ball, generally, but are juggernauts on the line. Their general strategy is to put every player on the opposing team into a dirt nap, so they can't be opposed taking the ball down the field. Failing in that, they engage ""the cage"", which involves moving your team in a specific formation with the ball carrier in the center to prevent the enemy from taking the ball unless they come and claim it.

A bit more about dice rolling: **Rerolls** are an extremely valuable resource in Blood Bowl, so valuable you're only allowed to use any rerolls you have once per turn. Having the ability to set right a roll that went wrong can be the difference between victory and defeat in many cases, and is quite tense.

Some rolls:

**Block Rolls**: When you choose to ""block"" someone, you have a selection of dice, either 1 2 3 red or 1 2 3 white, depending on the strength differential between your character and all support they have and their character and all support they have. Each support is worth one point of strength. This is what makes strong characters great, as they can easily score a two or three dice white. White means that you choose what the result is based on what dice are available. Possible rolls are, in order of ""how good is this for me"" in a broad sense: Defender Down; Defender Stumbles; Defender Pushed, Both Down; Attacker Down. I believe Defender Pushed appears twice on a d6.

**Tackle Zones**: Each character projects, except under special circumstances, a tackle zone into each square around them, through which any opposing player has to successfully score agility checks to avoid taking one of the stronger block rolls to the face.

**Team Races In Use**

**High Elves**: These guys excel at the one-two touchdown. Unlike other elves though, they're not totally dependent on it. A high elven lineman can actually avoid being snapped like a twig.

**Ogres**: The Ogre teams consist of two races actually. Ogres, who are monstrously powerful, and have a hideous drawback, but are ironically less problematic than most of the dumb brute races. The big drawback of Ogres is Bone Head, which they must roll against before taking any action on their turn, on a 1 they don't do anything with that turn, as they've sort of spaced out and forgotten what they were doing, or got distracted by something, which also causes them to temporarily cease to project tackle zones and provide no support to adjacent allies.. This is represented in game by the gears in their head grinding to a halt. This is one of the handful of failed rolls that don't result in an immediate turnover. Ironically, this is also one of the least crippling drawbacks a unit can have.

The other race with an Ogre team, as Ogres are monstrously expensive, are **Snotlings**. Snotlings are dirt cheap, 20K versus an Ogre's 140K. Snotlings are even smaller, stupider, greedier goblins. They're so small that an ogre can actually bodily hurl them a good distance on the pitch, albeit without precision. They're also so small that they're nigh impossible to tackle, moving easily through tackle zones. This of course means they melt when attacked, even elves throwing 3 dice blocks against them with ease, and they can neither throw a ball nor tackle worth a damn.

-------------------------
""Monkey Steals The Peach""

Team Arnheim Seahawks: The opposing team, weighing in at a rank of 1300 (representing about 1.3M gold worth of players and stats, etc.) with two rerolls, a High Elven team. Dressed in ornate turquoise armor.

Team Last Meal: Our player's team. Four ogres and seven snotlings, weighing in at 980 (.98M gold) with four rerolls to their name. Ironically, also in turquoise, but in ragged loincloths and bits of padding, with their team insignia being little more than a reproduced muddy handprint.

To say Last Meal was outclassed is no understatement. The Seahawks are an established team with experienced players and cash to bear, whereas Last Meal is a bunch of ogres and snotlings fresh out of the swamp or whatever disgusting hole they came from.

As a handicap, Blood Bowl provides the team with less invested with ""petty cash"" equal to the cash value investment of the team to spend on temporary bonuses like star players and bribes to deal with the referee on fouls (smashing a downed player). So I got 320K. I blew 300K on a Halfling Master Chef. Why? Ogres are dependent on rerolls, they need rerolls sometimes just to act, a HMC, at the start of each half, adds 0-3 rerolls to his team, and subtracts 0-3 from the opposing team. Due to the smell of the cooking. I shit you not.

Anyway, enter the first half. Things start off bad for me. I have to kick off to the high elves. First the HMC goes off, giving me one reroll and subtracting one from the Seahawks. Then the kickoff event happens, which due to some particularly enthusiastic fans gives the Seahawks two rerolls back. So it's 5 to 3 on rerolls. There are eight turns in a half, and you can spend one per turn.

Anyway, they get the ball and fairly quickly run it in. Catch, pass, touchdown. My ogres barely have time to do anything, and my snotlings are essentially worthless until things get going.

On the next kickoff, I get the ball, and the entire rest of the half is spent in a meat grinder, until finally I get an opening, passing the ball from an ogre to a snotling, who runs it to another snotling and throws it to him, who then runs down the field and eventually scores.

Second half, this is when things get really beautiful. I had to kick off to the elves again, and this is a bad situation to be in. They'll just score again. During that last drive though, I had injured three elves, who were unable to join the Wall formation that the Seahawks were using. Point is, there was a gap. This becomes relevant in a moment.

Kickoff. Halfling Master Chef. 6 rerolls for Last Meal, 1 for the Seahawks. Kickoff event happens. My team starts a moment ahead of the other team, and so any unit who is not in a tackle zone gets to take one free full move, even a blitz, before the elves get to do anything. I contemplate what to do with this, moving one Ogre not entirely on the front line in for a preemptive blitz, obviously, but what to do with the snotlings? Then I see. There's the indicator. The ball *will* land here. Snotlings are many things, but bad catchers they are not. Moreover, even though I could probably move through the tackle zones easily, there's a gap from a downed elf. And the ball will land in reach. Abusing physics mightily, my Snotling hurries up the pitch, and is in place to catch the ball kicked off by my own team. Obviously he gets turned into paste when the elf turn starts, but they're forced to waste their time. Here I should mention, I'm down a few snotlings due to injury, but Snotlings have an ability called sidestep, which lets them control to where their body is flung by any sort of block. So naturally, move in the least convenient way for the opponent possible. This is when the unthinkable happens. Our elf sent to retrieve the ball doesn't merely fail, he rerolls and fails again. Turnover.

My Ogres stomp the linemen and start moving up the pitch as I'm sending my remaining snotlings up, four all told I think. I have to act on this, it's my only chance. One snotling manages to reach the ball and wrest control of it, because tackle zones are night meaningless to a snotling. He runs a bit further up the pitch, which it may have been wiser to seek shelter with the ogres but I was desperate. Next turn, he's caught and stomped again, and this time the elves claim it, but my ogres arrive on the scene.

It's lights out for that elven courier. I don't have any snotlings in place this time, but they're still stuck having to get the ball, and there's hardly anyone to move it to because most of them are out for the count right now. Ultimately, they get the ball and end up not even sending it out of the cage formed by the other elves. I'm okay with this. Three perfectly executed punches from my ogres later, and the ball is loose, it rolls one square toward the end goal. There's two squares between the ball and the goal.

This is my chance. The miracle play, the underdog story, the hail mary. I am down to one reroll, and it's got no better time than now. I set my Snotling's path, he's going to go around the majority of the tacklezones around to the back, where the cage is weakest, and grab the ball. Then, now burning his Go For It rolls (two additional squares of movement for die rolls and possible turnovers). Up he goes, dodges tackle zone one and dives for the ball. Reroll pops up. The little bastard has fumbled the ball. I reroll, and miraculously he manages to get his grubby fingers around it. Now he merely needs to dodge out of the tackle zones of five elves and make two additional rolls to cross the touchdown line.

The little bastard does it. Slamming the ball down so hard he collapses himself, he gets that ball into the touchdown zone. And in that moment, Last Meal, ragtag bunch of nimrods that they are, have triumphed over the might and majesty of the Arnheim Seahawks. There's one more turn, with them kicking off to us. I think you know their odds on that one.",Video Game,False,self,t5_2wqgc,False,video,,True,t3_1ekf58,http://www.reddit.com/r/gametales/comments/1ekf58/blood_bowl_le_last_meal_vs_arnheim_seahawks_game/,

It's honestly true and I think it's an interesting tale, so I thought I'd resubmit it here. I have actually completed Red Dead Redemption since then. It's a little long. COPYPASTE START

 I'm not that far into the game yet, so this was my first trip to Thieves Landing and it's here where things became a bit strange. I'd just done a stranger mission (not a particularly important one but I'll avoid spoiler details anyway) and I was pretty tired in real life so I decided it was time to save and call it a night.

I got on my horse, and started to ride to the rent-able room when I knocked some randomner off his feet. Unfortunately this is a frequent occurrence for me so I knew he was gonna start shooting at me once he got back up. I don't like to kill civilians because it kills the immersion for me, so I decided to ride out of town a little way so he'd hopefully calm down and I wouldn't have to kill him just to save my game. I rode just far enough for the buildings to exit my view, then turned right around and headed back for the room. It must have been about 11pm or 12am game-time at this point so it was obviously pretty dark. 

As I re-entered the area I found it surprisingly easy to weave my way through the people and reach the target building, but I didn't think too much of it at the time.
Following my dismount of the horse, I saw one of the whores standing completely motionless in the middle of the bridge at the edge of the area. I thought I must have missed her saying something important, and that she was just waiting for me to come on over so a random mission could start. 

Believing my theory, I walked right up to her and she didn't move, and nothing happened. She says some generic whore dialogue that they all say but it' was completely non specific and it's definitely not an errand she wanted to be ran. ""What's up with this?"" I thought, so I did what every real gamer would do and ran directly into her, thus pushing her across the bridge. The idea was that she'd get knocked out of this weird lock and her AI would take control, call me clumsy, and then she'd go back to whoring around.

The momentum of the push meant I was now directly behind her so I turned  to face back towards her. She hadn't even turned around, she was just stood motionless in the new spot I'd knocked her into, staring blankly into the distance. Now facing directly back into the residential area, it was then that I first realised that the entire town was stood completely motionless. They were all saying generic NPC stuff, but not a single one was walking around. They didn't even seem to be doing the normal wall lean animations or anything, all of them just motionlessly staring in random directions. 

Two particularly odd guys were sitting on horses to the side of the bridge, just out of the water and in an area of plants. I don't know why they were there. I've never seen an NPC riding a horse off of the normal track, so I seriously doubt they'd gained entry via the river with the bridge literally right beside them.


I stood there looking at them for about 30 seconds, listening to the town run through it's dialogue, waiting for someone somewhere to move just an inch. They didn't. I knew it was just a game glitch or whatever, but it was a really eerie feeling just walking around a living dead town. I really was pretty tired in real life though, so I shook it off and started walking back towards the purchasable property to save. Just as I rounded the side of that house, one person started walking behind me. Naturally I turned around thinking ""oh good, everyone's back to normal"", but nope, just that one guy. I started heading back towards him and as I did so he turned around and started walking away, almost as if he was following me but didn't want me to think he was.


I wish this story had a better punchline, like the game crashed and his head started flashing on my screen shouting ""All hail Satan!!"" but unfortunately what really happened is I bought the property and went to sleep both in-game and in real life. It was, however, a very surreal scene that I thought you might enjoy hearing about, and I haven't actually played since then so who knows? Maybe next time I'll start the game and he'll be looking over my bed as I load it up, with the town members lifelessly staring over his shoulder. Probably not though.

END COPYPASTE. Unfortunately (although actually fortunate for my mental state) the game fixed itself when I reloaded that save.

He was the AMC’s best rigger/smuggler that you’d never heard of, and that’s how he liked it. “Quick” spent more time jacked-in than he did in meatspace, and his pride and joy was a custom, pimped-out T-Bird that could outrun anything the megacorps could send out, and that was only if they could spot it first.

It was a high-security, high-priority payload; top-secret, magical, and possibly breathing. The last thing he remembers was a skull-shattering electronic shriek, and an EMP so strong that he saw it liquefy the air as it cascaded over his body. That’s when he burnt out. He literally burnt out: his rig, his deck, his SIS, his ride, even his goddamn eyes were instantly fried, and so was his career. Aside from the fact that it was impossible and that he was dead for at least three minutes, Quick doesn’t know a thing about what went down, or why; he doesn't even know who was involved, and the only figure he’s certain was involved was more impossible still.

Quick and The Thunderbird Spirit were standing alone, supported by nothing, in a sea of nothing. Its wings stretched out across the blackness like shimmering solar sails, and it let out a cry that was as beautiful and terrifying as the face of god. Its beak was open wide, and stretching wider still, impossibly wide until it was a hood, falling back across the tangled, wavy hair of the Master, Jimmy Page. The massive wings became a cloak, and from it he produced a double-necked Gibson EDS-1275, and with a single word, he handed it to the mortal man: “Shred.”

Hugo Quicksilver drew breath for the first time, broken, blind, and flat busted. He had been chain-smoking in a corrugated tin hovel at the bottom of the Boxcutter Row, half-mad from sleep-deprivation, and the other half still in shock from the loss, and from fighting the dreams that would bring the thunderbirds, tearing out his eyes, again and again. In the treacherous depths of his delirium, Lady M found him reeling in the streets, and brought him home to get him right. She flipped a single Tarot card: “The Fool”, and White Feathers walked into the room. He dropped his pipe at the sight of him.

“Set him down.”

Soon, the shack was filled with sweet tobacco smoke.

White Feather and Hugo were standing alone in the familiar void.

“Do you know where you are?”

“No.”

“You will soon. Have the dreams come?”

“They won’t leave me.”

“Your essence is divided. You are at war. You fight the spirit that would save you.”

“The Thunderbird.”

“What did he say?”

“Shred.” And with the word, the sacred guitar appeared in Hugo’s astral hand.

“Then fucking shred, shaman.”

Hugo Quicksilver spent the last of his nuyen on the first guitar he could find. He is just starting to understand his calling, and even more, its great cost: his past, his vast hacking knowledge, his intimacy with technology are all lost to him. He is the wildcard.

**The Character**

I always build my character first and fill in the backstory later. I knew I wanted to make a grappler. Our DM was very liberal about which splat books and dragon magazines we were allowed to use. Here are the important details:

Name: Nok Flameborn Kagalano  
Race: Half-Giant  
Class: A gestalt mixture of Rage Monk, Barbarian, and Fighter  
Notable feats: Vow of Poverty, Leap Attack, Power Attack, Firey Fists, various grappling feats. A permanent Enlarge Person was cast on him

Combat style: Nok's primary methods of attacking were leaping into the air and coming down on his enemies with a huge unarmed attack. He'd then grapple the target and pound them into the ground. I don't recall the exact number, but his grapple bonus was an atrociously high ~+43 at level 12 after all possible bonuses. His jump check was also incredible for his level.

Misc: One of the flaws I was allowed to take was that I would auto-rage in the presence of a dragon. Half-dragons, drakes, and kobolds would allow me a saving throw, but there was no save against true dragons .

**Backstory**

Nok's tribe of half-giants had always been under the rule of a sadistic red dragon. They were his slaves, and his tolerance for insolence was non-existent. Shortly before Nok was born, the half-giants of his clan attempted to overthrow the dragon. The battle was short and brutal, as the dragon simply sat atop his mountain, burning all who came close with its deadly breath and killing any who got close enough for a swipe of its claws. Every half giant of the tribe took part in that battle, even Nok's very pregnant mother. 

When it looked like all hope was lost, a rumbling from the heavens drew the attention of the combatants, even the mighty dragon. An orange flash of light lit the top of the snowy mountain as a meteor plummeted through the sky faster than he could react. The giant rock slammed into the dragon, reducing his body to a scaly pulp. It was at that moment, Nok's mother collapsed, giving birth to the last member of the tribe.

This event led the remaining half giants to worship the rock, which still burns brightly atop the now bare mountain. Nok grew up worshiping the rock and hating dragons. Everything about his fighting style emulated the rock's plummet from the heavens and destruction of everything it touched.

Although the half giants were free, they were doomed. The battle had decimated their population to the point of no return. Nok grew up watching his small family grow smaller and smaller by the year. In his last elder's dying breath Nok was told of another tribe who they had lost contact with after the dragon showed up. Whether it was the half-mad ramblings of a dying old man, or the last wishes of his only family, Nok found purpose in traveling in search of his long lost tribe.

**The Battle Above the City, and the Death of Nok**

This was about 10 sessions into the campaign. Nok had grown close with his new companions, and considered them a part of his tribe. They were on a dangerous mission, but ensuring their safety was more important to him than chasing a tribe that may or may not even exist. It was at this point our DM chose to introduce us to the BBEG of the campaign, a Dragon necromancer.

The boat the party was on pulled into the harbor of a burning city. Atop the central tower was the dragon, raising an army of dead humans, and re-raising any destroyed undead. The city was doomed, and it was our task to get a few VIPs out of there and leave. Of course, Nok didn't have that option. He took to the rooftops and ran towards the dragon. He was followed by our dread necromancer-turned-troll while the others set about their task.

We got to the base of the tower, and the troll made it to the top first. The dragon took to the air and let loose a blast of its breath, which the troll avoided fairly easily. Of course, the DM assumed that with the dragon's fly speed, he would be out of range by the time we got to it. Not quite. With Nok's jumping ability and an assist from the troll, he could make it...on an 18.

The first of the dice god's blessings came as the dice landed on a 19. Nok soared through the air, and managed to grab hold of the unsuspecting dragon's legs. A grapple battle that could only be described as a most epic struggle ensued. Nok, despite being two sizes smaller, had a grapple bonus one measely point higher than the dragon. 10 rounds of back and forth, with the dragon trying to shake off the pest and Nok clinging for dear life nearly ended when the DM rolled a natural 20. This is the second blessing. Nok countered with his own natural 20 and could make a maneuver.

I briefly skimmed the rules for grappling in my head. I needed to end this quick. We were rising higher and higher into the air, and help might as well have been on another plane of existence.

...

""I'll pin his wings.""

Nok curled his great arms around the dragon's scaly wings, drawing them into his body, and ending his ability to fly. The dragon roared and struggled in futile throes of panic and rage, but Nok was able to hold him in place. Though his death was imminent, Nok felt strangely at peace. He has become the slayer of that which he most hated. Nok was the rock and flame who was bane of dragons. Nok was the meteor.

They hit the ground with such thunderous force, the people of the city thought their great tower had collapsed. Nothing was left of the smoldering crater that once was the great dragon and the champion who slayed him.",Tabletop,False,self,t5_2wqgc,False,table,,True,t3_1izd2i,http://www.reddit.com/r/gametales/comments/1izd2i/dd_35the_tale_of_nok_the_dragon_and_the_meteor/,
1371114683.0,30,self.gametales,1g9ax8,[Medieval 2: Total War Kingdoms] The Grand Campaign for Mexico,34,4,1,http://www.reddit.com/r/gametales/comments/1g9ax8/medieval_2_total_war_kingdoms_the_grand_campaign/,"The campaign is Americas; the faction is Spain. 

It was the conquest of the New World. Spanish expeditionary forces had landed in southern Mexico, armed to the teeth, and set about carving out a colony loyal to the Spanish throne. They were the first of the European powers to arrive in the Americas, and found the continent thick with hostile natives.

I'd never played this particular campaign before, and my playstyle was arrogant. I had guns and steel and horses against men in grass skirts - I saw myself as attacking from a position of total impunity. I didn't bother making alliances with the indigenous tribes.

Our first adversary upon making landfall was the Mayans, and by concentrating my forces I had entirely eradicated them in short order. And more than simply subduing the locals, I intended to dominate them entirely - take and hold their lands, and bring European culture and industry to the godless inhabitants. I stationed sturdy garrisons in every city I took, and poured my resources into massive construction projects.

Furthermore, I'd taken a monopolistic approach. Spain did not want to share the spoils with any other European powers. French and English fleets had arrived to try and stake their own claims, but as soon as they landed on the beaches the Spanish army would appear and drive them out. An army was even sent North, to seize the would-be United States and defend it against French incursions. The New World - all of it - belonged to Spain, and Spain alone.

But with the Mayans crushed, Spain turned its attention west, toward the Aztec Empire. That was where the trouble started.

While Spain had been securing its hold on the Mayan jungles and North America, the Aztecs had been gathering their forces. Massive armies of warriors began appearing, marching through the jungle along Mexico's eastern coast to assault my new cities. Each host was over a thousand strong; with my Spanish armies of a few hundred men, I could manage to scatter them with cavalry charges and gunfire in the open field, but if they slipped past me they could easily swarm over the walls of even the most well-defended Spanish settlements and overwhelm the defenders with sheer numbers.

It was all my forces could do to keep these assaults from reaching my borders, leaving my forces too weakened to launch counterattacks, but after each army was repulsed another would appear in its place.

So the Spanish invasion came to a standstill. The King of Spain was growing impatient, and unless we made steady progress, his funding for the war would soon begin to dwindle.

Then a new governor arrived from Spain. 

Governor Goncalo, a young, idealistic new commander, arrived at the head of an army of fresh conquistadors. As his first act, the new young Governor declared that the greatest army ever fielded in the Americas would be assembled, and he would lead it personally into the heart of the Aztec Empire. They would meet the Aztecs head-on and crush them under the Spanish war machine. This would be the turning point - the force that marched into Aztec territory and broke the stalemate. They would force out the Aztecs and establish a firm foothold for subsequent incursions.

The most advanced military hardware in the known world was shipped in from the offshore foundries in Havana - heavy cavalry and handgunners and cannon loaded with explosive shot. Two full stacks were formed of the most expensive, elite soldiers Spain had at her disposal. For a faction that typically relied on using only handfuls of such units at a time, I figured they would be unstoppable in such a high concentration.

Goncalo decided that because the Aztec forces were concentrated in the jungles on Mexico's eastern shore, where Spanish expansion had come to a halt, his force would instead cross the mountains and move along the western shore, where the open plains and hills would give even greater advantage to his traditional European tactics. They would sweep in behind the Aztec lines and begin carving up their lands from the inside out.

So Goncalo's army, immaculate and indefatigable, departed on its mission. They left the safety of my southernmost city and embarked into the barren hill country of western Mexico. I pictured a grand military parade to see them off, with the young Governor at its head. So began the Grand Campaign.

Almost at once, it became apparent that the Aztecs' forces were perhaps not entirely devoted to the stalemate on the eastern coast. Goncalo's host was soon confronted by two huge armies of Aztecs guarding the hill country. 

It was no matter - the Spanish army swatted them aside with massed artillery fire and a fierce cavalry charge. The natives were put to rout and the grand army pressed on. If that was the best the Aztecs had to offer, there was nothing to fear from them. Goncalo had his first taste of battle, and had been found an admirable commander.

But the march had barely resumed when another pair of full-sized Aztec hordes appeared. Again, Goncalo pelted them with artillery fire, but this time it wasn't enough to scatter them. By the end of the battle, it came down to bloody infantry fighting. The Aztecs were defeated once again, but this time the casualties were substantial.

Twice more were Goncalo's armies attacked on their long march through the hills. Every man his infantry regiments lost became a serious loss, and though the cannons would fire until they were out of shot, they never seemed to put a big enough dent in the Aztec lines.

But at last, after months of long marching and bloody fighting, Goncalo's forces reached the first Aztec city - Xelaju. Gathering his remaining forces together, as well as what few native mercenaries he could muster, Goncalo had the strength to seize the city, but it was perhaps the bloodiest battle yet.

Battered, weary, and cut off from reinforcements, Goncalo's army paused to catch its breath in the conquered city. By this point it was clear there would be no swift blitzkrieg of the Aztec heartlands - this was not the soft underbelly of the Aztec Empire, as I'd thought. Whether or not Xelaju could even have been held was uncertain. Goncalo sent a scout ahead of the army, deeper into Aztec territory, to see how long they had before another Aztec warhost arrived.

And what the scout saw was terrifying.

Descending on Xelaju was not one, not two, but *eight* full-sized Aztec stacks. All told, it was over ten thousand warriors, and they were all marching towards Goncalo's beleaguered army of four hundred.

The steady stream of Aztec armies that had been fighting Spanish forces to a halt back on the eastern coast had been nothing more than a vanguard. As later became clear, while the Spanish had been taking their time conquering and rebuilding Mayan cities and establishing themselves, the Aztecs had been busy. They had made war on all their other tribal neighbors, the Tlaxcallans, the Tarascans,  and the Chichimeca. All of them had been either destroyed or subjugated, and now the Aztec Empire stretched as far as North America.

Goncalo had only one choice: retreat. Xelaju was a lost cause. They had to make it back to Spanish lines. Then there would need to be a full reassessment of the war effort - the Aztecs were more dangerous than could have been imagined. Goncalo gathered his men, abandoned the city, and marched back the way he'd come.

But it was too late. The horde descended around Xelaju, and two Aztec armies outflanked Goncalo's forces as he fled. The battle was at dusk, and with three hundred ragged Spanish regiments against two thousand Aztecs. They caught Goncalo's army along a steep foothill, making what cannons he had left nearly useless. Goncalo arrayed his bands of footmen - only 3-9 in a regiment - in a tight formation at the highest point on the hillside, and dared the Aztecs to come up after him.

The standoff was long and bitter. The fight was a butchery. The Spanish Cavalry charge was bogged down and slaughtered, and once it was dealt with the Aztec army marched brazenly up the slope and cut down every last gunner and footman.

All that remained of the army of the Grand Campaign was Goncalo and his five bodyguards against thousands of Aztecs. They'd pulled back to higher ground, with the Aztec army pacing hungrily further down the slope. Whenever they moved to advance up the hillside, Goncalo and his knights would charge them, smashing their foremost regiment and sending them reeling back down.

I didn't count how many charges Goncalo and his knights made against the horde, but each time they grew more and more exhausted, and every now and then one of them would fall. On one charge, they cut down the Aztec general, but the horde kept coming. I ended up running down the timer - the battle ended, and as the defender, I won by default. The Aztecs relented and withdrew.

When dawn broke, only Goncalo and two of his knights remained. They had killed almost 600 Aztecs that night.

With the path to New Spain clear, the survivors limped back to Spanish territory, with Xelaju burning behind them. Governor Goncalo had a long list of new traits from the Grand Campaign: hideous battle scars, night terrors, and a burning hatred of Aztecs among them.

I kept playing the campaign for a while longer, but there was nothing glorious in it. The King lost interest in the flagging colonial effort, and my expenses eventually became untenable. As my armies shrank, new Aztec offensives began pushing back my borders, and Goncalo was counted among the dead when the colossal wave of Aztec warriors he had seen during the campaign inevitably swarmed over my southern cities.",Video Game,False,self,t5_2wqgc,False,video,,True,t3_1g9ax8,http://www.reddit.com/r/gametales/comments/1g9ax8/medieval_2_total_war_kingdoms_the_grand_campaign/,

When I played I wouldn't allow reloads for deaths and I wouldn't change anything about my recruited soldiers except for giving the males beards.

Start the game, after the tutorial where everyone dies but one I get my first squad. Private Marco Moretti is one of the few. After the first few missions he levels up and becomes my Sniper. I use him wisely, keeping him out of the front while maximizing his damage across the field. This man almost never misses. I had one other sniper in my time of playing and his hit rate, although a high percentage, wasn't fantastic. Not Moretti, if I wanted something dead he did it. Eventually he earned the nickname ""Nightmare"", very appropriate, and then ranked all the way to Colonel.

He was with me on every single mission. He was never even hit in combat. It was to the point at times that I purposefully had to make him skip his turn to let someone else get the kill for XP. He was decked out in the best gear available by the end.

Before the last mission, 32 missions, 102 kills, no damage taken.

Get to the last mission and infiltrate their mother ship. Everyone makes it to the last fight except for one fallen soldier. The fight begins and the squad is doing well. Then one of my assault soldiers gets taken over and shoots the other assault right in the chest with a shotgun. She's down. He gets killed soon after. 3 people left now; Moretti, the female medic, and the psionic user.

Everyone is about one hit away from dieing, except for Moretti who still hasn't been touched. Every shot is a danger to this streak, seeing as the main enemies have a chance to reflect the shot back. The fight had to be over this turn or else the psionic was going to be killed. Moretti's turn comes up, he fires. Critical. Fucking. Hit. Finishes off the Uber Ethereal. 

Cut scene goes to the psionic sacrificing himself to move the ship away from Earth.

---------------------------
Back in the day I used to be addicted to warcraft 3. Not the vanilla game it's self, but the custom maps and game modes. One of my favorite game modes was this game where you would build a kingdom and go to war and stuff. I don't remember the names of the guys I played with because this has to be at least 10 to 8 years ago, so I will call these guys Green, Red, and Blue. Well everyone for the first hour of this game didn't feel like going against each other. We decided to help each other at first. But unknowingly to me and Blue, the others where planning a purging.

As me and blue are setting some thing up Green and Red decided to swarm us with there men. It was brutal Both of our cities where destroyed no one survived. At least, that's what Green and Red thought. 

Unknowingly to Green and Red, me and Blue both managed to have some of our build units survive. Me and Blue found a corner that was walled off and unknown to Green and Red. 

Me and Blue spent the next 30 minutes rebuilding and trying to understand what the fuck just happened. We both sat there as we saw Green and Red brag about there genocide on our kingdoms. 

Me and Blue both had the same thing on our minds after they destroyed our bases: revenge. We both laughed at Green and Red thinking that we left. As we continued to build up a massive army, Green and Red's relationship seemed to deteriorate. 

Green and Red soon grow paranoid at one another. It started as bickering, "" Why are you moving your army to so and so.""
Eventually it grew to full arguments over resources and how Red's men shouldn't be near Green. It eventually boiled over and Green and Red went into a war. That's when Me and Blue attacked. 

Me and Blue noticed something was gonna happen soon. We were patient over there bickering. We laughed at there paranoia, and how oblivious to us they were. Me and Blue decided to wait until there battles were at the peak. As they continued to fight we continued to grow. We struck them when they were wearing down and both had little men left.

I would pay money to see the faces of these idiots as me and Blue's massive army came from the corner the map. ""No fucking way,"" said green. ""I thought you searched everywhere for these guys."" 
Red responds with,""I thought they left.""
In a matter of minutes they were destroyed. ""This is fucking bullshit,""said Green. Then he left along with red. Me and Blue didn't stick in the game for to long. We got exactly what we wanted revenge. 

TL;DR: Kingdom got destroyed. Secretly built back a society then took down the people who destroyed our society.

a) kill a party member
and
b) get killed *by* a party member
Best, Session, Ever!

Allow me to elaborate:
I arrived 45 minutes late (as I was subjected to the Tender mercies of London's rail replacement bus services), into the middle of a firefight between the rest of the party (comprised of an adept, a face/investigator, a Longarms/Infiltration specialist and an edgemaster) and a Troll ex-Shadowrunner turned military intelligence turned freelance, with two operatives guards. We had previously tried to have a 'talk' with said Troll (by the name of Wells) as he had been the middle-man for a experimental missile that was used as an attempt to kill us. We had failed.

The story was (which I picked up later) that we had encountered each other in the Foyer of an MCT owned building. We decided to take it outside.

I walked into a situation where one of the operatives was near death, the other was slapping a Stim patch on him, and Wells had the Face in a grapple. Face's attempt to extract himself from said grapple allowed Wells to use him as a human shield, and a rest for the Panther XXL Assault Cannon he pulled out of a bag.

My attempt to Long Burst Wells using the Rigger (which my character was) Van White Knight (LMG) failed miserably. Oh, it did a lot of damage, for sure, but Wells... dodged (Edge). The Face did not, and was out of edge (I think, or he just gave up.) Said White Knight was loaded with the more penetrating variety of explosive rounds.

There was not much *left* of the face afterwards. We ran. In my defense, the Face had been screaming at us to do just what I did. It went so well! The adept needed urgent medical attention as well, in a hospital, after the Healing Mage we had on the books fluffed the roll.

More about the Edgemaster: the Edgemaster is a sixteen year old girl, the daughter of former Shadowrunners, who were killed during the great purge of London, in which most of the current and former London  based Shadowrunners were killed (said missile was fired at us then.) Her entire *Raison d'Aventure* is revenge for her parents.

So, the party was called to have a meeting with my character's father in a sandwich shop quote 'located at the wrong side of Windsor Castle.' My father was a brilliant technician and Shadowrunner, thought to be now working for MI6 as a researcher. He had left, and was working for (sorry, forgot the name, Frank Drake or something, Prime Runner in Second or Third edition). He had helped orchestrate the purge. The purge that killed the Edgemaster's parents.

Glacial pause...

the Edgemaster shot him. Avoiding the attempted grapple of the Gunslinger (Edge), she shot him in the Head, at point blank range, which a heavy pistol, using edge to gain an unholy number of hits (8, if I remember correctly.) He died. She pointed the gun at me, and held her action until I acted.

I had a Ruger Super Warhawk with Ex-Ex rounds (more lethal explosive rounds mentioned above) mounted on a hidden arm slide. I used it, and my last point of edge. She used edge and dodged it. It was a single shot weapon, and I didn't have another. She shot me as well. I died. The Hachimans with Sniper Rifles my Father had set up on the hill (Wrong side of Windsor Castle, no one watching) opened up.

Edgemaster burnt a point of Edge, survived the Salvos, I spent the rest of the session creating a new character, and a Shadeem opened up a Mana Rift over London, from Highgate cemetery.

(first timer),34,7,4,http://www.reddit.com/r/gametales/comments/1fbk9i/kerbal_space_program_a_new_frontier_first_timer/,"The following story may have some peculiar terminology, so if there are terms you dont know just comment and let me know! I will also write the terms I used. I am no writer. But this is kind of a dramatic RP story for my favorite Indie game, Kerbal Space Program, or KSP. 





---------

**The Kosmonaut**

""This is it, are you strapped in? Reach forward, no, try reaching right there... Ok good. See you on the other side, Kerman."" Flight engineer Raskert Kerman backs out of the Mk I command module pod and begins to close the hatch. 

""Alright, he's good. Let's light this puppy!"" he yells to the other crew in the launch tower. Everyone begins to pat on the side of the module for good luck.

Lt. Colonel Jebediah Kerman has been training for this for three years. Countless medical checks, drills, mathematics lessons, flight skill checks, and seemingly endless miniature competition against his peers. 

His group of pilots were known as the Hakken Hachi (Discovery 8), eight pilots and scientists from various backgrounds. All gifted, all special, and all very competitive over who was to go in this rocket first.

Today was the day that all of this work was about to pay off. Today was Launch Day. 

___

""If you are just joining us on this radio program, my name is Aldmy Kerman and welcome to the live commentary of the launch of the Hakken-3 rocket. The very first manned rocket in our history, and hopefully the first successful orbit of a fellow Kerbal into the stars. Joining me today is Bob Kerman, who is the next Kerbal to go up providing this launch is successful. Good to have you Bob. ""

""Yes Aldmy and it's good to be here today, thank you for having me."" 

""Now then Bob, as we go through the launch could you explain some things to us?""

""Sure. Right now we are waiting for the hatch to close on the command module. Once that happens and we confirm a pressurized environment inside the pod then we will count down from two minutes and thirty seconds.""

""Fantastic Bob, now let's listen on what is happening at flight control."" 

---

It was dark, unusually silent, and very cold inside of the pod. Jeb could feel his ears pop as the pressurization began inside the cabin. 
A sudden screech came from the speaker in the instrument board. And a scratchy voice came through. ""Alright Jeb we are uh... Looking at pressures all around and they are go. So we are ready to start countdown if you are. Go or no go?""

This would be Jeb's last chance to back out. Running through his mind was every possibility of failure, just three months before, they had launched a test rocket and it had exploded forty-five seconds into launch. The next words he said would confirm whether or not he had confidence in his team and his rocket. 

""This is Jeb, I'm go.""

""Roger that, T minus two minutes and thirty seconds... mark"" 

----

*T minus two minutes* 

""Hakken is now running on internal power, umbilicals are separating from secondary and tertiary stages. Commence final check and go or no go on all flight controllers. Booster?""

""GO""

""RETRO""

""GO""

""FIDO"" 

""GO"" 

""Guidance""

""We are go""

""Surgeon"" 

""GO""

""EECOM"" 

""Go Flight""

""GNC"" 

""GO"" 

""TELMU"" 

""GO"" 

""Control"" 

""GO""

""Procedures"" 

""GO""

""INCO, FAO, NETWORK""

""GO""

""Recovery"" 

""GO""

""CAPCOM""

""We are go""

""Launch Control, this is KSC. We are go for launch. T Minus sixty seconds""

Flight director William Kerman sat up straight in his seat and started biting his pen. This is it. It's time to break the hold that this planet has over them. Time to show our world that we are to make the next step in our evolution. 

--- 

*T minus 10 seconds. 9, 8, 7, 6, engine sequence start, 2, 1 ... *

*Aaand, liftoff of the United Alliance Hakken-3 rocket, lifting Jebediah Kerman up to meet with the heavens and paving the way for our future in space!* 

Jeb's head was knocked back against his seat and he could feel the entire world holding onto his body as the rocket leaped upward and pushed toward the sky. The shaking was so intense inside the capsule that he could barely see that the G force meter was reading that he was feeling over nine times the gravity on his body. As if several people were sitting on his chest. He pushed his hand toward the abort switch and kept his finger ready to flip that switch.

 But he'd rather die than make a false abort, so he let his hand fall back to his side. 

The shaking had gotten even more intense. Jeb could feel his teeth rattling out of his head, he reaches over to turn on his microphone in contact with the control center. 

""CAPCOM, CAPCOM, this is Hakken actual. Engine temperature nominal, all pressures nominal. Starting roll program. ""

""Hakken, CAPCOM. Confirm, nominal status. Roll program, aye. ""
___

*T Plus one minute thirty seconds* 

""Wow Bob, that was a fantastic launch!"" 

""You're right about that Aldmy. This is a proud moment for all of us.""

*Thirty seconds until Stage-1 separation* 

""Alright Bob, now run us through the separation please?"" 

""Sure, Stage-1 is the initial launch stage. A solid fuel booster that has an incredible amount of thrust to give us a lot of that speed required to put us into orbit. At around thirty-five-thousand meters up, the engine will cut-off and the vessel will pitch forward to the horizon. The second (liquid) stage will then fire and should put us at the right speed for an LKO, or low Kerbin Orbit.""

""In the past there have been difficulties with this stage yes?""

""Yes, this is a tense moment in our launch.""

*Stage-1 Sep... Stage-2 ignition confirmed.*

A loud applause breaks out in the observation room where Bob and Aldmy are sitting and watching, along with a crowd of fellow scientists, crew, and family members.

""Bob, this is fantastic news, yes? What is next for the hakken?""

""Well first we will need to finish our Orbital Insertion Burn. Once we have that and can confirm our trajectories. We will have a successful orbit. And then separate stage-2 and start stage-3, which is the Retrofire and command/service module stage. Shortly after the separation, we are going to enter LoS, or loss of signal. We wont be able to hear from Jeb for about an hour""

""That must be a tense hour for Jebediah!"" 

""Indeed it is, my knuckles are white just thinking about it.""

___

CAPCOM's voice crackles through the intercom. 

""Alright Jeb, five second till engine cut-off and sep. How you feeling?""

Jebediah paused for a moment, the Gs were not as intense as before but still strong enough to limit his breathing. When the first stage separated, he felt one or two seconds of relief as all the pressure let up, but like a horse kicking him in  the chest, the second stage pushed him to the back of his seat.
Jeb grunted and put him mouth to his microphone, ""All go here CAPCOM. Reading nominal conditions across the board. Engine cut-off in 2, 1.. engine cut-off. Standby Stage Sep. 5, 4, 3, 2, 1, stage --""



A loud bang echoed through and he felt the explosive bolts push him away from the second stage. 
Suddenly, he felt his stomach lift within himself. Everything had gone weightless. He felt himself lift up from his chair, held down only by the straps in place. He reached for the quick release and started floating in the cramped cabin. For the first time in what felt like years, he smiled. 

""Stage separation confirmed, flight. Orbital insertion complete. Hakken 3 has made it into LKO."" 

Jebediah could hear everyone in flight control roaring with applause through the comm channel. Even his icy cold CAPCOM let out a loud whooping sound. 

""Roger that Jebediah! What do you see up there?""

Jeb looked over to this tiny fifteen by fifteen centimeter glass panel behind him on the hatch and peered through. 

The sun was shining in the horizon on the west. It was setting behind the planet, Jeb's home looked like an ominous black sphere as his eyes were blinded by the radiant beauty of Kerbol. As the sun disappeared behind the planet, his eyes adjusted and he could see countless tiny stars on the surface. Thunderstorms in the great distant tropical wetlands to the south, snow caps on the mountain range to the north, and endless plains in the centre of the continent. He could see everything, but he felt like nothing. 

""It's beautiful up here flight. You would just have to see it. I see my house from here... at least where it should be."" 

""Roger that."" said Barger, his CAPCOM officer, with a tinge of jealousy in his voice. 

""Stand by for retrofire position Hakken. We are approaching LoS... Stand... thruster...... south.""

CAPCOM's voice gave way to the white noise as the signal got worse and the connection between Jeb and the world was fading away. Before a blink, the comm channel shut off. 

Jeb was alone in the icy fringes of his world. Never had he felt more alone, yet never had he felt more connected to his planet. He had broken free from Kerbin's grip on him. Now he was only dancing in the heavens with his home. He had a newfound respect for her and all of her majestic beauty. Tears filled Jeb's eye as the climax of his entire career as a pilot came to a boil.

The objective was boosting a whole bunch of donations and gambling money from a mob-run ""casino night""-style gala. In [Part 1](http://www.reddit.com/r/gametales/comments/1djsuk/shadowrun_a_heist_becomes_a_stickup_xpost_rrpg/) I caught you up on our less-than-graceful reconnoitering and our almost-smooth entry. [Part 2](http://www.reddit.com/r/gametales/comments/1e8zeb/shadowrun_in_which_shit_hits_the_fan/) was dedicated to a few unforseen developments and changes in plan. And now I can tell you where the whole sorry mess ended up.

Coltrane and I stuff what few credsticks we were able to grab into our pockets, press the button for the first floor and ready our weapons. 

As the elevator door opens, we can see the ballroom's mostly cleared out (somehow the flashbang under the table, along with the explosion and gunfire from downstairs, gave the guests the impression that the party was over). Two mooks stand by a table near us, facing the elevator. Behind them, another two are standing by the bar, and off to the right one more is just coming down the stairs.

We don't step out of the elevator - we just open fire. Coltrane puts a huge slug from his revolver in the chest of each of the guys in front of us; I finish the job with two rounds of flechettes from my shotgun, leaving both on the ground &amp; not long for this world. 

The two guys from the bar see their friends drop, look at each other, and shrug. ""Fuck this,"" the bigger one says. He pulls a frag grenade from somewhere inside his jacket, yanks the pin and lobs it in our general direction. Then both split for the door.

The guy on the stairs makes a face. ""Pussies. Gon' get me some BLOOD!""

He pulls an Ingram Smartgun from a shoulder holster and sends a burst my way.

The kevlar sewn into the lining of my longcoat bounces the bullets. It hurts more like being punched five or six times than actually being shot. But it still hurts. A little winded, I glance at the grenade a few feet from the elevator door, press the 2nd floor button to get Coltrane out of there, and sprint for the asshole who probably just left me some pretty good bruises.

I drop my shotgun on the floor as I run, and my spring-loaded holster pops my own revolver into my hand, fire exploding from the barrel at the same instant. The huge round catches the thug in the belly, and he staggers back. I've drawn level with him at this point, and I leap high enough to bring my gun level with his head, then pull the trigger. Sweet dreams.

Behind me, the elevator door closes just in time to shield Coltrane from the blast as the grenade goes off. One of the goons headed for the door is caught in the blast, his legs shredded as he's carried off his feet. The other one makes good his escape, and I'm left alone in the lobby again.

But not for long.

It's about a minute later when Grimm and Dom, who are circling the block in a stolen getaway car, see our Mr. Johnson come drifting around the corner in an expensive black sedan and park outside the hotel. He practically leaps from his car, swearing, not even closing his door in his hurry to clean up this mess. He heads into the hotel, and Grimm and Dom follow, along with Fury, who's been hanging outside since his ""distraction.""

So as Coltrane brings the elevator back down to the first floor and steps out, Mr. Johnson - AKA Mr. Caravaggio - finds himself surrounded by the team he lied to, hired, and then lied to some more. And he decides to come clean.

He's panicked, angry, practically frothing at the mouth. He whines about how his little brother was assigned head of security for the event instead of him, how after we turned the party into a disaster he was supposed to clean the whole thing up, ""recover"" the money and become the golden boy again. ""BUT YOU JUST COULDN'T DO IT, COULD YOU?"" he shrieks, reaching a crescendo. ""YOU JUST COULDN'T SHUT UP AND TAKE THE MON-""

The crack of my Super Warhawk sounds like an A-bomb in the empty lobby. Caravaggio's knee explodes, his lower leg literally severed as he collapses whimpering to the ground. ""You talk too, much, asshole,"" I grumble as I pull my whiskey from a pocket. I swig down the last of it and discard the bottle as I walk over to our prone former employer. He's still moaning in pain.

""Shut. Up."" I say quietly, putting my barrel against his temple. ""You're coming with us. We're gonna find daddy, and he's going to pay us for a job well-""

""Please,"" says a feeble voice from behind me, ""Unhand my son.""

We whirl to see a bent-back old man, his skin graying and his hair a shock of white. He might weigh eighty pounds soaking wet, and he appears to be unarmed. ""I'm Camillo Caravaggio, and my son may be a fuckup, but he's mine to deal with. Let him go and leave these premises.""

I chuckle and thumb the Warhawk's hammer, levelling the hand-cannon at the old man. 

""Or what?""

His hand suddenly splits and opens up to reveal a huge pistol with what appears to be a tiny rocket-launcher attached. Caravaggio brings the rocket level with our heads... then points it up, directly at the ceiling above us.

""Or I bring this whole place down on your heads!""

At that, Coltrane shrugs and heads for the door, whistling all the way. I fire the Ruger again, aiming for the suped-up cyberarm, but the shot goes wide. Dom, for his part, charges the elderly cyborg, bellowing, ""COME ON THEN, HIT ME!""

Caravaggio flinches, and the rocket fires off in Dom's direction. His intention is to catch and return the projectile with his superior adept reflexes, but he's a little too slow. The rocket catches the troll directly in the chest, leaving a wide crater of charred flesh. Dom collapses to the floor, unconscious and bleeding out.

At this point, Caravaggio pulls a fetish doll from his pocket. It looks like a matchstick with arms and legs, and he waves it in the air as he starts muttering under his breath.

Fury, searching frantically for a weapon, finds the shotgun I had discarded earlier and turns it on the mob boss. He fires two blasts, but the old man dodges both, moving too quickly to even see.

The room starts to get hot, and Grimm shouts that he can feel a fire spirit in the building. Intent on getting the fetish away from Caravaggio, I charge him, tossing my pistol away in favor of my favorite melee weapon. She's a pre-Awakening baseball bat, with a railroad spike driven through the head. I call her Bertha.

I swing wildly at his head and grab for the doll, but he dodges both attacks easily and then sprints to his son's side in an instant, putting some distance between us.

It's Grimm who turns the tide, conjuring two five-meter balls of lighting in a row, centered on two generations of Caravaggio. The son is incinerated immediately; after the second blast, the father is still standing, but he looks to be in bad shape, and he sprints for the elevator.

The fire spirit's work is very much in evidence now, as flames begin to engulf the ceiling of the ballroom. Grimm summons a water spirit and sets it to work putting out the fire, while I radio Hammer (still somewhere in the upper floors of the building) and have her hack the lobby sprinklers.

Fury lets off two shots from my shotgun as Caravaggio flashes by, but the old man is moving too fast. He reaches the elevator and wrenches the doors open with his bare hands, desperate for escape.

I drill two short bursts from the Ingram into his back. They don't look like they hurt much, but the impact is enough to push him over into the elevator shaft. His scream is cut short rather abruptly as he hits the bottom.

I go jumping after him, hoping to keep him alive so we can squeeze him for a little profit. Fortunately, I avoid taking any damage from the two-story fall. Unfortunately, I avoid damage because I landed on Caravaggio, who is now decidedly beyond saving. I toss the corpse for valuables, coming up with the matchstick fetish, a customized revolver and not much else, then climb back up to the lobby.

We can hear the Knights Errant on their way, so it's very much time to go. Grimm stabilizes Dom with a quick Heal spell, but he's still not moving and we certainly can't carry him, so we leave him for the cops. They'll get him to a hospital, at least.

Outside, we find that Caravaggio Jr. left the keys in his car. Coltrane, who's still hanging around outside, hops in and I follow on my motorcycle to an unscrupulous contact of his so we can fence the car. After some particularly inspired negotiating on Coltrane's part, we clear 6000 Nuyen for the car. 

Along with the remains of the credsticks we scooped off the floor of the basement, that leaves us with 10000 total - two apiece. It's not the 5k we were promised - but at this point the cash is a bonus. 

We're just happy to have survived with our skins.

I mostly played PVE, but I had beaten every campaign. So, I turned my eye to PVP. I started in random arenas, making a couple of PVP-only characters. My favorite was the warrior. I liked creating my own unorthodox builds (skill loadouts). My favorite skill that I loved was ""Backbreaker,"" where I knocked down an opposing player for 5 seconds. At some point, I unlocked Heroes Ascent, where players create teams of 8 and attempt to make it to the Hall of Heroes and win prizes. However, most good players required already experienced players to be in the party (team). So, I had trouble finding a team, or if I found one, they were horrible. 

Finally, I saw two monks (healers), both r9, advertising a team. I quickly joined up a team of the two healers and a bunch of unorthodox misfits. We had two mesmers, two elementalists, 1 dervish, and myself. Not a stereotypical team for Heroes Ascent. The monks started up the round, and I wasn't expecting much. The first stage was against henchmen, and it took us 37 seconds to beat it, giving us only a 6% morale boost. Great teams always get the 10%. We move on to the first PVP round, the Underworld, and are up against a guild ranked 9th. A team of misfits against a guild team, whose GVG team was ranked 9th in the game. The odds were not in our favor. 

The battle starts, and 1 of our mesmers go down quick. The opponents are running a balanced attack and are really hard to wear down. It doesn't look good. I tell my team, ""Our only shot is for me to use backbreaker, take out the other healer, interrupt their resurrections, and then take out the knocked down healer. It works. We kill one healer, take down their elementalist and their mesmer, then their other monk, and finally finish off their frontline, the warriors, a ranger, and a dervish. A team of misfits, with only two experienced players on the team, has somehow defeated a team of some of the best PvP players in the game. I attribute the victory to the unorthodox way we attacked, as they had not prepared for this kind of warfare.

We won the next round too, against another balanced team, but without the same guild experience. Then, we skipped to the Hall of Heroes and lost a heartbreaker to a team that had won 4 times in a row.

We head up to the Graven estate to look around scooby doo style for clues as to what they're up to. We ride up on the cart we stole from their gravediggers, and via some clever german doctor wizard magic got past the front gate only to be attacked by a vampire rose bush that snatches our german doctor and inquisitor from the back of the cart. The doctor hanging by his neck and the inquisitor by her waist, both struggling to get free, to no avail. Roll iniative.

Pirate stands and fires on the bush with his pistol and moves to engage.

I'm up. ""I take out my wire saw""

""You have a wire saw?""

""It's on my character sheet, I took it at charcter gen!""

*Party laughs at me*

I move over to the bush dodging tendril attacks and proceed to Garrote the vine currently lynching the poor doctor and sawing through the limb.

Doctor drops a bottle of alcohol which the pirate picks up and begins turning into a molotov cocktail.

Inquisitor fails to escape and begins hacking at the limb holding her.

My turn rolls around, I see that the pirate is prepping a molotov, so I saw the doctor free, pull out my pint of oil, more laughs from the party, and douse the bush as much as I can and move away succesfully dodging another volly of grasping tendrils.

Pirate hucks the molotov sets the bush aflame, inquisitor frees herself and we book it.

Several failed attempts at entering the house proper later, we find ourselves in a building seperate from the house that acts as the family's own private library. The more magicly inclined start milling about performing their arcana checks, finding several magic books, useless to a man of ""macguyver science"" like myself. So, feeling a little left out myself and the pirate head upstairs, followed by the doctor after he detects another magic item. several failed identify checks, we don't know what it does.

I step up to the magic item (a set of dice), ""We could always try the old fashioned way.""

""That could be really dangerous...""

""Stand aside Pansies!"" instinctively pick up 2d6 not even knowing that's what I was actually supposed roll, and huck them across the table.

DM: ""Wait, you're actually rolling them?""

me: ""Yeah.""

DM: ""What'd ya' get?""

me: ""11...""

DM: ""Oh...""

me: ""Oh crap...""

DM: ""It seems luck is with you tonight sir, before you know what you got I'd like you to read to the rest of us, what could have happened...""

They were Rogue's Dice and if you know what those are they're pretty awful if roll anything below 7, and pretty helpful if 7 or above, the things were like: lose 10k exp, which would have set me back to lvl 1, lose 1d4+1 points of DEX, i'm a DEX/WIS build, gain 1d4 negative levels... but I got ""limited wish"" (DM didn't like the text of it so he changed it to Wish but with limited conditions.)
So DM says wish. now. go.

not wanting to break the game monkey's paw style I decided to have a bit of fun at my own expense, so I immediately burst out,

""Mithral Waffle Iron! ... of ... Healing!""

Party begins to laugh at me again, telling me what a dumb idea it is. DM decides that since I didn't specify what type of healing it was that he'd roll a d6 1-2 cure serious 3-4 cure moderate 5-6 cure light. 2. A waffle iron of cure serious wounds... it cooks a d6 worth of healing waffles per day...

Fast forward through us getting mauled by zombie dogs, my party again decides to mock me by deciding it was time for a ""Waffle Break"" to test out the healing capabilities. roll a d6 for number of waffles, 6. Fully healed the party and ended up removing exhausted and fatigued from 2 party members... My joke waffle iron was now the equivalent of a lvl 3 cleric in a party with no healer.

*Drip, drip, drip*  

The blood is dripping from the bags hanging from the ceilings. Probably what is left from the last unlucky few to wander in here.  

I was told to stay away from here. I was told that this place was dangerous, but my instincts couldn't keep me away from it.

I wandered the dimly lit halls, the walls almost rusted away from the destructive hand of time. The atmosphere in here felt sad and hopeless. It reminded me of my past, during my depression. But still, I kept wandering the halls. Blood stained the floors and seemed to trail on forever. I walked past a door, barricaded by lockers, beds and any other items that you could cram in. I peeked into a nearby window, only to find an empty room left with the remains of the people who had ultimately met their fate; their flesh long gone, leaving behind only skeletons.  

I kept wandering hoping to find anything of interest, but I found only empty rooms that would have once harbored life, but now they lay abandoned, rusted, lifeless. I dwelled for what seemed to be hours, until I finally stumbled upon a room, what appeared to be a doctor's office, lit only by the dim light of a working computer terminal. I started going through the files. First, I found a list; 93 names of people deceased, most of their deaths listed as 'undefined', others dead because of cancer, or accidents involving shock and faulty weaponry. I kept scrolling through, learning that 'undefined' meant death because of the experiments. I learned that this place, supposed to be a place of shelter and safety from a harsh wasteland was ironically used as a place for the twisted minds of the government to experiment on innocent people. The overseer knew all about their plans, but was never revealed the true nature of these 'experiments'.  

Sick to my stomach, I logged off and had soon found myself in front of a door labeled 'Test Labs'. I stumbled inside and had not lingered far down the hall, when I found them, the rooms where these experiments took place. A terminal on the wall read 'Test Chamber 01'. Inside, a heavily mutated corpse was on a small table, its upper body almost doubled in size. Its skin was blistered, bones and muscle visible in some parts and a look of fear and agony was spread across its lifeless face. It wore a jumpsuit, ripped by its rapid growth. My Geiger Counter was buzzing, a symbol that the radiation still lingered from the experiments.

A single tear came streamed down my face, and I stumbled out of the room, feeling nauseous. I propped myself against a wall, and started taking deep breaths. It was obvious that these people went through hell, and I had no business being here. I needed to leave, and quick, but before I started to get up, I heard a sound coming from down the hall.  

*Thump, thump, thump*

The sound of footsteps throughout the decaying halls, getting louder each time. A shadow grew bigger on the wall; a bulky figure that stood many feet tall. I knew that I couldn't fight it. The only weapon on me was a near-ruined pistol, and I had used the last of the ammo picking off some raiders nearby. 

So here I am, awaiting my final moments. I know that I won't be killed, instead, I will be taken, I will become one of them now, forced through the same pain and agony as all of the others in this metal tomb. So let this be a message:


Never enter Vault 87; because you won't ever get out. Instead, you'll have your name inscribed on an old terminal, and beside your name will be a single word: ""Undefined""


*Note to anyone who doesn't play Fallout 3: This story is pure fiction, but but is based upon a true part of the game, Vault 87.

A little back-story on the characters. Broon is a half-orc fighter. He grew up in the wilderness, but he is now trying to become civilized. Easy Torinn is a dragonborn warlord. He is a mischievous character. He grew up on a farm until his uncle, who raised him, was murdered. Both ended up in the town of Mayce, where they begin their journey.

Log 1 of Broon
 
We began in jail, my reason?  A diplomat looked upon me,
and thought I was ‘suspicious.’  So I was thrown into the jail.  Days passed,
and I met a scale by the name of Torinn.  ‘Easy’ Torinn, apparently.

We heard fighting and shouting from the surface above.  A goblin by the name of Marx came in and released us.  He was the Captain of the Guard, and he gave our items back. Above ground, we decided to join up with Marx to fight off a band of mercenaries who were attacking the town of Mayce.  The leader of the mercenaries was scarred, wielding a massive blade.  His underlings were fierce, vicious.  They would use a pack strategy on us, picking us off one by one.  They would take to the rooftops, jumping down upon us.  Many times I was knocked unconscious by their blows.  However, after a few of them were killed by the guards.  I myself attacked their leader many times.  

There was a standoff as lives were lost on both sides.  Finally, the mercenaries left, taking the bodies of their comrades with them.  Marx had his guards gather up the remains of those who were left.  However, it was all an elaborate hoax, designed so that the mercenaries could kidnap a man.  We found a token that the mercenaries had dropped, a scythe with a sword underneath it.  A local tavern held a similar symbol, which we investigated.  We went to the tavern, and talked to the owner, who was a Tiefling.  He had a symbol of a scythe and field on the wall, and when asked about it, became defensive.  We intimidated him by insulting his masculinity, and he led us downstairs, to a book he wanted to show us.  However, he ambushed us, getting killed in the process.  

We showed the book to Marx, who said something about… a cult?  Still not exactly sure what such a thing is.  Anyways, we went to the kidnapped man’s house to investigate.  A bit of looking around and we found a plaque that had in Elven ‘Honor in Family’ and a painting of a man with his apparent father.  The young man was wearing a ring, which we also found in the house.  We took these to Marx, and then went to the only person whom this young man confided in, and even he didn't know much.

This friend of the young man pointed out that the young man’s father lived in the capital of Salthirn.  He had run away from his father after an apparent falling-out.  Marx is going to supply us with allies in our journey there.  

Hopefully we’ll be able to wrap this up soon.  I am not sure what to make of my new companion, Easy Torinn…

Our goal is to interrogate her to find out who hired them.  Upon entering we see one woman dressed like the other criminals but with much nicer clothing, so we assume she is the gang leader. We are all chaotic neutral and we placed an explosive smoke grenade at the entrance for a timed explosion to blind the tavern for a distraction.

The Bard (me) enters with the Warforged who feigns ignorance and acts like it is merely a showpiece that I command.  A harlot approaches us but we reject her.  I begin playing music on my Harmonica and he performs feats of strength to draw a crowd and distract the patrons.

Meanwhile the Warlock enters and also denies the same prostitute. He sneaks and is attempting to break into a hidden room behind the bar while we provide a distraction.  However, he sets off a acane flash-bang trap that blinds the entire lower floor of the tavern (12 NPC's and myself) my two teammates are luckily unaffected. 

At this point we had a trap set up to do a similar blinding attack and it goes off.  However, our DM allows ""over rolling"" so the trap was too strong and blew a 8x8 hole in the roof and catches the building on fire.

The warforged leaves me with the other blinded NPC's and begins helping the Warlock loot the secret room like maniacs while in my disoriented state I cast a powerful burst attack for fear of being attacked by the NPC's.

Now, I am surrounded by 12 onlookers and only 3 are evil. 

I. Crit.


So everyone but the girl was fried to a crisp. And she was bloodied.  In our last seconds before the building collapses we find out that the prostitute from earlier was the gang leader in disguise and she escaped and this lady is an actress. We toss her out of the window and find an escape before the guards come to kill us.

We end up in a secret tunnel after the building collapses above us.  22 civilian deaths (upstairs and down).  3 enemy deaths.  Thank god we're chaotic neutral and no one saw us.  

Trtl:  We blew up a whorehouse, killed 22 innocent people, missed our only target, and now are wading waste deep in sewage.  Always double-check the hookers.

It was nothing like the current GW2 necromancer, with dimwitted, smallish minions. No. Back then, you actually needed corpses to raise your army. And believe me, I'm not exaggerating by saying that it was an army, because the amount of minions you could have at a time, depended only on your ability to maintain their health, which depleted over time. You could walk around with 20+ Bone Fiends and melt whole regions with ease. Furthermore minions provided an excellent meat shield, so minion masters were welcomed in vanquishing and farming parties.  
Now, there are two facts about minions from GW1. They were borderline agressive, and once their master died, they attacked everything that moves. Including other players. And my friends discovered this the hard way.  
Once, we were farming one particular location for runes. We had a comlpete balanced party, and I was rolling my Minion Master necro. We proceeded as usually, until someone called a mid run bio break. We just stopped, and since the mobs in GW did not respawn until you re-zoned, everybody just went to do their business, while I tried to keep my minion army healthy. It got boring after few minutes, so I decided to minimize the game. Suddenly a wild missclick appeared, and instead of clicking on the minimize button, I closed the game. Minions, unleashed from their invisible bonds, happily killed all my AFKing friends within seconds. While this wasn't that much of an inconvenience, because the party could just respawn, and the death penalty debuff was being decreased with each mob killed, it was absolutely hilarious for me. I couldn't stop laughing while my friends were trying to figure out what actually happened, and asked me, how the hell did I make my minions attack them.  
Later on similar stories happened when my connection dropped a few times. Or when I told them that it dropped, while I disconnected on purpose. Fun. Then, I was banned to use this build, and had to switch to Spiteful Spirit. Good times.  

tl;dr - My minions killed my friends in Guild Wars, while I accidentaly disconnected.

1365900156.0,28,self.gametales,1caszs,(WoW) A duelist's biography,35,7,5,http://www.reddit.com/r/gametales/comments/1caszs/wow_a_duelists_biography/,"*[Hello. This is a lengthy story of my ""career"" in World of Warcraft's PvP scene. It's not ""epic"" by any means, but I just wanted to share this story with other people.]*
  
It was around January 2008. I had started playing WoW when the new expansion pack The Burning Crusade came out, and I my blood elf rogue had just reached the final level after a year of adventuring. Did I just beat the game? I figured I should probably keep improving my character, getting better items and tons of money.  
  
The money part of my plan never turned out too well, but I managed to get a lot of dungeons done and I even ventured into the Heroic modes (which actually were kind of a big deal back then). I had no friends or guild, but I didn't need them.  
  
After a few weeks of mastering the Heroic dungeons, I realized my progression was blocked. I actually needed some kind of a guild to start raiding. I tried it for a while, but I was 14 back then and I couldn't be on computer past 20:00 so I had to figure something else out. That was when I decided to focus purely on PvP.  
  
I grew to love PvP. It was about outsmarting your opponent (I really pressed that stun-key well), not about memorizing boss encounters and waiting for that last slowpoke to show up. I did battlegrounds alone for about a month before I realized that doing arenas gave even better rewards. And let me tell you, I love increasing my attributes. So off to the arenas I went. There was just one small problem, I required a teammate.  
  
After an hour of searching I found a warrior who was willing to play with me. I payed the terrible price of 80 gold coins to get a team (I never, ever had over 1500 gold coins at the same time) and we were off to glory. A week of slicing throats and punching kidneys passes by and the warrior decides to abandon me for some damn druid hippie. It was fine, I didn't need him anyways. There were a lot of fish in the sea.  
  
I spend the next month finding new teammates to replace the old ones who either left me or were kicked out of the team by me. But then I find a priest who suggests a new, scary thing: voice chat via Ventrilo. We play for a few hours and win around 80% of the games. I'm really excited by this point and we get along pretty well.  
  
Together we keep playing and improving. We play together hundreds of matches and really start to ""get"" the game. Our team's rating steadily increases and we finally break the 1850 barrier, which allowed me to purchase *Vengeful Gladiator's Shanker*, a very powerful dagger for enhanced mutilating *(to WoW veterans: Yes, I was assassination specced in Season 3. Problems?)*.  
  
I stopped doing battlegrounds, there were no rewards left for me and everyone else just felt worse than me in there.  I spent my newfound free time dueling in front of Orgrimmar with other ""good players"" like me. Rogues were really good in 1v1 combat and I felt like the king of the server.  
  
I also grew really fond of the priest. He was from the Netherlands and was a few years older than me. He felt kind of like a big brother. With our overpowered Vengeful Gladiator's weapons we managed to push our rating over the magical barrier of 2000. That was probably the happiest moment of my life. We worked really hard to get there, we had played like 500 matches (each match takes from 2 minutes to around 10 minutes) and it paid off. We got to decorate our characters with the amazing shoulder-slot items and I strut around Orgrimmar like I owned the damn place.  
  
The priest also got me into this super elitist guild, where everyone was awesome in arenas. I didn't play with any of them, but atleast I got to talk with a lot of different people and get different points of view on other classes. That was also when I heard that the current arena season was about to end. (In the end of each season the best players get rewards such as titles and space-dragon-mounts). I really wanted to see push our limits and we began rising our rating again.  
  
We didn't talk much during matches anymore, we knew each other so well that we didn't have to. We got to the rating of 2080 before the season ended. We placed in the 2nd best category of top 0.5%-3% and got sweet ""Duelist"" titles. We weren't ""the best of the best"", but we still were damn good. Especially considering I was only allowed to play about 2h per day (of which I am really glad now).  
  
Conveniently a few weeks after the end of season, my family moved to another country, Germany and I couldn't play WoW for a month. When I finally logged back in, my good friend had found someone else to play with. I can still feel a sting in my chest when I think about it. So what did I do then? I didn't rage or anything, I locked up the nasty feeling somewhere in the back of my mind and turned to apathy.  
  
I tried my luck with plenty of other teammates, but it really didn't work out with any of them. With the new expansion Wrath of the Lich King coming up I decided to make a new character on a realm where my IRL friends played. They didn't know much about PvP and were more focused on raiding.  
  
There was one aweful thing in WotLK that really turned me bitter. The health pools were very low compared to damage output. It was not uncommon to get killed in 2-4 seconds against one or two opponents. I trusted Blizzard to change things back to good old days of chess-like PvP and I leveled plenty of characters while waiting. But Blizzard never went back, and after a year of WotLK, I had had enough.  
  
I found a private server that was created only for the purpose of Arenas in the last patch of Burning Crusade: 2.4.3. Dominated by my nostalgia trip, I installed the older version of WoW, logged in and made a blood elf rogue with the same name I had used on my old duelist. I started looking for a priest for 2v2 arena, but I was approached by a druid who told me he remembered me. He turned out to be an officer from my old guild.  
  
After a half hour chat (which was mostly composed of us complaining about WotLK), I decided to ask if he knew anything about the priest I had played with. And yes! He was playing on that server too. I convinced the priest to play 2v2 with me and we owned a lot of faces together.  
  
I was really happy for a few days, but in the end I just couldn't fool myself. The server was very unstable and had lots of other issues. Combine that with the bad feeling I got everytime I remembered the Grand Betrayal and you probably aren't too surprised to hear that I quit that server after a week. I wasn't happy with how things turned out, but dwelling in the past didn't help.  
  
  
*[Holy shit! I thought I'd just write a quickie in a few minutes, but now I've been writing for two hours straight and the clock is 4am soon. If you thought I took WoW a bit too seriously, you must understand it was a huge part of my life back then. If you read through all of this, I thank you.]*  
  
*[Also I am aware that I changed the Grammatical tense somewhere there, but I'm not gonna rewrite the whole damn thing]*

Part 4 is [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/gametales/comments/1j40ik/pathfinder_hobgoblin_war_part_4_icy_water_fire/).

The party woke the next ""morning"", refreshed and healed thanks to Ashok's healing powers.  The soft *skritch*ing sound they'd heard softly echoing through the halls all night never seemed to approach their impromptu camp, and as such they slept somewhat peacefully.  Ceal noticed that the smoke from their small fire was following the ceiling out of the room and going across the hall to the other chamber.  The party figured that the area was more than likely some flavor of exit, and as such figured they'd explore the rest of the area, searching for any sort of equipment that might have survived the battle and the ravages of time, and Ashok had told the rest of the party about the useful properties of cold iron, so they were all excited.  They decided to continue down the grand hallway they had begun on, advancing cautiously as they approached the source of the \*skritch\*.

The noise stopped abruptly.  The companions froze and searched about, straining their eyes and ears in the murky gloom that surrounded them.  Reirret the gnome detected some sort of being hiding behind a chunk of shattered pillar, but couldn't see him.  At his signal to the party that he saw something, it burst forth from its cover, a man-sized, red-skinned being of some sort with jagged teeth weilding a jagged glave.  A near twin of the monster came out of the shadows from the opposite side of the cavern, and out of the blackness of the ceiling swooped a much smaller version with wings sprouting from its back.

The party waded in with an eager grin, happy to outnumber their opponents for once, but their confidence soon became real fear as their weapons proved nearly ineffective against the roaring demons they faced (for demons they were).  Their foe's flesh seemed to resist any impact by weapon or fist, and the party was soon on their heels and fighting for their lives.

(Meta-note here:  While I had huge chunks of plot ready to go, I wasn't all that clear on a few of the finer points of the Pathfinder system.  What *actually* happened was that Ceal summoned a few lantern archons due to a misunderstanding of how mage's chosen school bonus spells worked, and said archons helped immensely against the demons, bypassing their damage reduction.  I'm going to dramatize the conclusion of the fight instead, though, because it makes better reading and it's what I *expected* the party to do...)

In a flash of insight, Mike remembered all the shattered weapons and armor on the ground around them.  He scooped up some likely looking candidates at his feet and began throwing them as improvised shuriken at his opponent, hands blurring through throwing patterns learned as a youth at his parents' side.  The cold iron tore through the flesh of the monster engaging Reirret, and it howled in agony as the sacred metal burned through skin and muscle with ease.  Reirret, sensing an opening, flashed forward and struck a powerful blow with his spiked gauntlet, tearing a large rent in the demon's belly.  The abomination roared its defiance, then fell to its knees and lay still.

Mike turned his attention to the demon fighting Ashok and began hurling more of the shards of cold iron.  This demon had seen the fate of its companion and wanted nothing to do with the deadly monk.  It attempted to maneuver itself in to cover, using a pillar and Ashok himself as cover, but the fleet halfling proved too quick and soon began peppering the demon with fragments of a battle axe.  Reirret, meanwhile, went to help the beleaguered Ceal Gladstone, who was suffering at the hands of the small winged demon and was beginning to slow and tire thanks to the effects of its poisonous bite.

Between them, they managed to defeat the demons, the remaining Glaive wielding monstrosity eventually fell to a mighty overhand blow from Ashok's warhammer.  The winged imp, meanwhile, failed to evade Reirret's grasp.  Reirret's gauntlet protected him from its bite, and he dashed its head against the ground, stunning it long enough to wind up his flail and smash the pest to a red paste upon the smooth stone.

As soon as the demons were dead, they began to dissolve, leaving behind their jagged glaives and a few small items and gems.  The party retreated back down the hallway some distance, healed as best they could, and talked about the encounter.  The burning question on all of their minds, however, couldn't be answered:  why were demons in a dwarven mining outpost?",Tabletop,False,self,t5_2wqgc,False,table,author,True,t3_1jdc7s,http://www.reddit.com/r/gametales/comments/1jdc7s/pathfinder_hobgoblin_war_part_5_demons_who_said/,

Sorry for the long delay between instalments:  I've been super busy at work and haven't had a chance to continue!

The party was rushing along underground, completely submerged in frigid water, bouncing against the cave walls and desperately hoping they'd find an opening before they drowned.  As their lungs felt fit to burst from their chests, they suddenly found themselves falling from the ceiling of a cave in to a large underground lake.  After a few (thankfully successful) swim checks, the party began making their way towards a shore, thankful to be alive despite their bumps and bruises.

One of the party (Ceal Gladestone the elf, if I remember correctly) made a very difficult perception check after surfacing and saw (thanks in large part to low-light vision) a glint of gold in the bottom of the lake (about 30 feet down).  He swam down to check it out, and came back to the surface a short time later with a small golden ring.

The cave turned out to have some soft illumination in the form of a glowing lichen that spread over the bottom several feet of the cavern closest to the water.  The huge rush of water wasn't filling the chamber, so they were in no danger of drowning, but it was chilly, damp, and loud.  The chamber itself was roughly circular around the lake, so they picked a direction and began searching for an exit.  They found one roughly half an hour later, a rough hole in the wall which ran slightly uphill and wide enough for two to walk abreast.  The cave system (for indeed it was not a single tunnel) lead them through many twists and turns, and even an encounter with a small group of kobolds (who were swiftly dispatched).  Chasms plunged deep in to the earth across their path, but they successfully passed the challenge with some well rolled jump checks.

Eventually Ashok noticed something about the walls - instead of being natural stone formations, he saw the mark of tools here and there.  The party followed the tool-marked walls and made a discovery that had the blacksmith practically dancing with glee:  Cold Iron.  It was a raw ore vein, and he was missing all but his hammer and tongs to do any work with it, but he couldn't suppress his surprise and happiness at finding the rare metal.  It was then that the party realized that the cave was actually a mine.  Further exploration along this path led them to an ore-cart on rails, several broken picks and other mining tools, and the hope of finding a safe place to rest.

They followed the rails to a large metal and stone double-door built in to the cave wall, with faded runes etched in to the stone that Ashok immediately recognized as dwarven.  The party slowly pushed through one side of the door and beheld a great hall, ruined by some cataclysm, with tall stone pillars smashed and laying across their path.  Signs of a long-ago battle were numerous, with smashed bones and shattered weapons and armor littering the dusty floor.  The party advanced cautiously, but nobody noticed the first magical trap until it was too late.  Fire rained from the ceiling on to Ceal, who was untouched.  Ceal revealed that the ring he had found was in fact a ring of fire resistance, and it likely saved his life.  The party suspected that there would be many more traps of this same sort in the hall, but Ceal came up with a clever solution:  he summoned firebeetles and sent them ahead of the party, triggering many traps in their path and suffering no ill effects from the flames.  The party continued on in this fashion and discovered two side-chambers off the left and right of the hall.  Choosing more or less at random, they entered one and discovered the smashed and rotted remains of a barracks.  The beds and tables had rotted away with age and neglect - those that hadn't been smashed.  Still, it was a chamber with a single entrance and easily defended, so the party camped out for the night.  Quiet \*skritching\* sounds could be heard from further down the hall, but the sound never became more than a whisper, and so the party spent the night burning the beds and tables of long-dead dwarves to warm them.",Tabletop,False,self,t5_2wqgc,False,table,author,True,t3_1j40ik,http://www.reddit.com/r/gametales/comments/1j40ik/pathfinder_hobgoblin_war_part_4_icy_water_fire/,
1372906306.0,25,self.gametales,1hlzeq,The Tale of Sasha [Red Dead Redemption] (x-post from r/gaming),31,6,4,http://www.reddit.com/r/gametales/comments/1hlzeq/the_tale_of_sasha_red_dead_redemption_xpost_from/,"So recently, I had a moment where I had dem feels for one of the NPCs in game. And seeing as r/gaming didn't seem to care cause console wars, I had hoped to share my story and possibly get others to share theirs as well. So here I go, apologies in advance for any typos as my iPod is really slow.

It all began on Red Dead Redemption. I had recently got back into it and through a series of events started naming my horses in the multiplayer. Every time one died I would call my horse a different name, my first was named Diablo as a joke, and my friend accidentally shot him in the head. After I grieved for my comrade, I moved on and named my new horse. He later died as well and I kept changing names as I played and as they died.

While I was upset that my horses died I had never gotten attached to then until one day after my horse had been killed, I decided to name my horse Sasha, after Sasha Braus (aka potato girl) from Attack on Titan. (I had just started watching it and she was by far my favorite character). The first time I tried to get on her, she kept moving away so I had to chase her down until I finally managed to catch her. I could tell that this would be an interesting partnership. 

My first real challenge with her was hunting down the legendary jaguar khan. For those unfamiliar with the wild multiplayer animals of red dead, let's just say Sasha's expected survival rate was very very low. However she managed to stay alive through that and the legendary bear. After that adventure I had grown quite fond of her as we rode through the lawless land of the old west. 

I decided to then put her to the test and cause a little mischief. I rode to Armadillo and proceeded to shoot NPCs up to get the bounty challenges done. When things got way too hot for me to handle, I whistled and Sasha rode in with perfect timing and placement for a clean getaway. That was the day me and her formed a bond of more than just a horse and her master...we were comrades, we were friends, we were outlaws to the very end.

Real life days passed. My friends had become quickly aware that Sasha was not to be touched. We continued to cause mischief while also cleaning up the west. We killed anyone that wasn't with us and she had lived through numerous player encounters, which up to that point I was dreading as the majority of red dead players needed no reason to shoot either of us. We even fought all the legendary animals again to help one of my friends. However I knew, deep deep down, that one day she was going to die...and I was dreading that day more and more as time went on.

Real life weeks later, Sasha had become a legend with the time she spent living. She was my noble steed and friend through thick and thin. More than once after a bandit hideout was cleared she would just trot up without me even whistling. We would just ride from place to place kicking ass and taking names. One day I had joined a lobby and looked at the roster. I saw one team of 8 and another posse of 4-5 trying to gain some more soldiers. Personally I wasn't interested in what happened, however I knew better to stay in one place for too long with those size posses on the loose for Sasha's sake. So I called her and I rode off.

After a bit of riding, I stopped to check where the other players were on the map. After a couple of seconds I heard wolves. I switched to the game and saw I was surrounded. Of course they were still wolves and I quickly dispatched all the ones in the area atop Sasha. I went back to checking the map when it happened...

Even though it was a couple of weeks ago, I still don't remember how I let it happen. I don't know whether it was the tv, my friends over the headset or sheer arrogance.However, while looking at the map I heard a loud barking and growling. When I went back to see what the ruckus was about....it was too late...Sasha had fallen...

I was in shock. I couldn't process what had just occurred. I couldn't speak. All I did was take out my gun and shot the wolf in the head. I walked over to it's corpse after locating it and released every single bullet I had into it's limp body...with every single gun I had. I threw every knife, fire bottle, and stick of dynamite at it, save the few I threw at NPCs...so I could gather their ammo and shoot the murderer of Sasha some more. After I had exhausted all my ammo I tried to punch the corpse, but I could not. In a fit of rage I stole a passing carriage and drove it of a nearby cliff, killing the two horses and myself in the process. I then broke the news to my friends in the party.

And that is my mournful tale. I hoped you enjoyed and feel free to comment with constructive criticism and even your own stories. I have still to name my new horse. Looking back I always thought that Sasha would go down running into gunfire to try and save me but the irony was that she died doing what we had first did...which was hunt the animals. But I will always remember my friend and comrade. Sasha was more than an animal...she was an outlaw.

1366482515.0,26,self.gametales,1cr5bw,[D20 CoC] Joe Gribble and the Werewolf,27,1,5,http://www.reddit.com/r/gametales/comments/1cr5bw/d20_coc_joe_gribble_and_the_werewolf/,"Playing in a d20 Call of Cthulhu game with 5 of my friends where we started out in Cameron, Texas about 3 months into an apparent zombie apocalypse, except things have been getting progressively weirder. At the beginning we escaped a zombie attack on a church and in the process my character, a good ol' boy, locked a door behind him without realizing the repercussions and killed about 20 men, women and children still inside the building with the undead. By doing this my group and I earned the everlasting hatred of this NPC we dubbed Scarface because we never learned his name.

Scarface was described lovingly by the DM as ""a bad-ass with an m16 and a huge scar running down his face"", but we never got around to talking to him during our first session because, well, the group had little cohesion and things got out of hand real quick.

So anyways, after escaping the church we bounce around Texas for a bit scavenging and then find another armed enclave of survivors. We try to join them, but of course Scarface is part of the welcoming party. However, we do some good-faith work for the leader; a search and rescue mission for a radio team gone missing while searching for more survivors. Being a Call of Cthulhu game, this leads us to a haunted house. Long story short, we accomplish the mission and find coordinates to a more sophisticated group of survivors in Oklahoma and return to Camp Scarface.

When we get back, I managed to roleplay myself into becoming the face of the new scouting team (the PCs) in the eyes of the community, and a respected member of the camp. I even buttered up one of the merchant types into being my group's personal tradesman by bribing him with cigarettes, arranging that we would trade stuff we find while on scouting missions to him in exchange that he monitor the marketplace and trade for items of our choosing while we're gone. We're in the best position yet in the game with only zombies and Scarface as our implacable enemies. However, theres trouble in paradise because our encampment has picked clean the surrounding area and in order to get supplies for a migration to Oklahoma we have 3 choices: search farther afield and hope for the best, trade/convince other armed groups near us to give/find supplies, or take the supplies by force from the other armed groups. This decision is left up to me to decide.

Scarface had warned us when we joined the new group of survivors that if we ever did anything to hurt innocents again he would hunt us all down. This was a very real threat as he would be proven to be significantly higher level later on. So I go to him with this dilemma, wanting to hear how to not piss him off so I dont get a bullet in my back, but all attempts at diplomacy fail and I am grappled and forced to listen to Scarface berate me for the massacre in the church. Afterwards, I go talk to the leader who says he'll talk to Scarface, great. Then I go to our tradesman to get him to listen to popular sentiment around camp regarding the PC group vs Scarface issue. Then I talk to my group itself and the best bout of roleplaying yet occurred with everyone arguing in character about past events, current problems, and future courses of action. One PC threatens another with bodily harm, the threatened PC pulls his holdout pistol and points it at the other's crotch. Im coming around the table to break them up when Scarface shows up and puts a gun to the head of PC with the pistol drawn. At this point, we hear a ""bloodcurdling howl"" from outside followed by tremendous banging on a barricaded door.

The fight dissolves as people go for their stored weapons and form up around the barrier, I step up next to Scarface and start talking to him, but he looks over at me with fear in his eyes and says, ""Do you have any silver bullets?""

BAM! the door slams open, a werewolf jumps into the room and pandemonium ensues. I shoot it with a .30-06 to no effect, then drop my gun and attempt to light it on fire with a spray-can of gun oil and a zippo. In so doing I accidentally set a woman running away from the werewolf on fire. Scarface is all like wtf, and I know in my heart there will be no bargaining with him even though it was an accident, so I turn and try to light him up too. He dodges out of the way of the flames and shoots me with his M-16. Wounded, I drop the makeshift flamethrower and return fire with my .357, wounding him. Meanwhile the werewolf comes up from behind and slashes me to 1 hp with its claws. I grapple with Scarface and fall to the ground, pulling him between me and the werewolf.

2 of the other PC's run like bitches (and survived for quite some time after stealing my truck to make their getaway). The other 2 PC's stayed and tried to save me. They fought like champs but without silver were unable to do any lasting damage on the werewolf which killed them. 

So picture it, a fortified commercial building with dozens of people holed up inside along with a werewolf. People are running in panic away from the monster as it slaughters them, a few are trying to fight it, and small fires are breaking out because of my shenanigans. Chaos, my friend, it was chaos. Throughout all, I was locked in a death struggle with Scarface. I'm sure there were better actions I could have chosen, but I told the DM every round that I was continuing to strangle Scarface while using him as a meat shield. During the course of our grapple, my level 2, str 8, 1 hp left character rolled 3 20's, 19, 18, and a 17 for grapple checks, but I failed to confirm any of my criticals. I'm still doing damage to him though, why won't this guy just die?! As my last friend is dying while trying to disable the werewolf with a lucky machete swipe, Scarface finally manages to reverse the grapple and rolls me over yelling, ""I'll kill you!"" He chokes me out and I go immediately unconscious. DM smiles with a gleam in his eye and says that's it for my turn and then gives his attention to the 2 PC's who survived by stealing my truck. The session ends shortly after and I assume I'll be making a new character next time.

The next session I wake up underneath a dead Scarface to the sound of shuffling, moaning, and chewing in the smouldering room. The 2 PCs lie dead nearby along with god only knows how many other random NPCs massacred around me. I still have 1 HP, and my truck is gone. Does a werewolf's claws spread lycanthropy? I guess I have to survive long enough to find out.

Seemed a good thing to add here. : 


It was the people. The community. Living in a virtual world. A harsh virtual world that brought people together and encouraged to you team up. Modern MMOs try everything they possibly can to make sure that you never play with anyone else.
I'm going to tell a long story. Like many who started playing MMOs back in 1997-2003, I find modern MMOs lacking in many ways. They're just too different from what we had back then. They focus on singleplayer instanced quest grinding, whereas MMOs back then focused on creating virtual worlds for people to socialize and live in.
So I will tell you a story of one of my first big group experiences in Dark Age of Camelot. This story emphasizes many of the features absent from modern MMOs. Settle in, it's a long one.

I was a level 7 Armsman wandering around Camelot Hills looking for something to do. I walked about exploring, but not straying too far, lest I get lost (no in game map, which pulled you into the world like you wouldn't believe). I talked to some players, and many of them mentioned a place called the Tomb of Mithra.

I decided to go up to the local Keep and talk to guards there. They referred me to the local crier. I wasn't sure where he was. I typed ""/where Crier Ulwyn"". The guards literally pointed me in the right direction. Quests were rare in DAoC, they were done more for the story, for solving puzzles, and for finding new places you didn't know existed. The item reward was secondary. NPCs existed to flesh out the world and make it feel like a place. There were lots of dialogue options with even the lowliest NPC villager.

I talked to the crier, clicking through his dialogue, occasionally typing in words to get more information. On a whim I typed ""Mithra"" and he gave me a story, basically explaining how it was a horrible hell hole and I should stay away from it. I decided I must go there.

I asked some veteran players that were around how to get there. I still remember the directions. ""Go north along this road until you see a guard tower, then go east through the field of bandits. Once you get to the hill, slowly work your way to the top and get ready to sprint inside when you see the tomb entrance. It's guarded by the undead.""
I was nervous the whole way to the tomb, and feared dying. Another big difference, there were death penalties in old games, which made you feel grounded in the world and invested in everything around you. The world was a dangerous place.

I made it into the tomb with only a little health to spare, the monsters outside had tried their best to eat me alive. I was greeted by the sight of player graves. Dozens of names stood near the entrance, showing where the warriors fell in their final moments. I was in a dark stone hallway, with stairs leading down, and undead guardsmen at the bottom.
I was a low level, but if I managed to get one of the guardsmen alone (using my crossbow that I had just recently found!) I could kill one alone. I did this for a while, and then got bold and ran down the stairs.

I slipped by the guardsmen into the next hall. I remember a friend's advice, ""Never EVER go right when in Mithra."" So, I stuck to lefts, turning through a few corridors. I passed other warriors fighting unspeakable horrors (dungeons were NOT instanced, and in fact were where many socialized, as you will see). I rounded a corner and..bam, I got killed by a horde of Roman Soldier skeletons.

I shouted for help as I bled out and two people eventually found my body and brought me back to life, meaning I only got a minor xp penalty. I thanked them and bowed, they bowed back, and we exchanged a few words before deciding to group up.
All right! 3 man strong we pushed deeper into the dungeon, more lefts, eventually coming into what was called ""The Promise Room"". Inside were 4 other players who were in over their heads, and about to die. Our group charged in to help, just barely staving off the enemies and saving the 4 people. Again, thanks all around, a little joking, and we decided to group. With the 7 of us, we could easily kill anything in The Promise Room, and decided to push even deeper, to areas of the dungeon most of us had never seen. We decided to go right.

We passed rooms with giant meat hooks and flayed skin stretched on walls. We passed ritual chambers full of dead Roman Generals, walking around in their rusty old armor. We had to dodge a lot of these high level wandering monsters, on edge the whole time. (death penalty!) We found a collapsed wall in the dungeon, and underneath, was the basement level, where many horrors spawned from. At the very bottom was a place called The Disciple Room. It was perfect. We made it in and set up shop, killing enemies 8 at a time. Then we'd sit to recover our health and wait for a respawn, talking in chat, laughing, joking. It was one of the most fun nights I can remember.
There was a group of notorious mobs in this dungeon called Bleeders, jaguar sized lizards. They'd send smaller faster ones ahead to rooms people might be in, and if the scouts found anyone they'd attack. If they weren't killed fast enough they'd scream and call the entire horde down, sometimes including their brood mother. Everyone lived in fear of these wandering monsters. Rumor has it they were attracted to silver items. I had picked up a silver lined map case.

Two scouts ran into our room and started biting me. I stood up quickly to avoid more double damage hits and pulled out my shield. Our cleric healed me and shouted ""Shit shit shit! Kill them quickly!""

We tried, but in moments the bleeders were screaming ""SCHUUUUUUCCCTH"". About a dozen more came pouring down the stairs into our room, with the massive brood mother stomping behind them. We didn't even entertain the thought that we'd survive, and I was already starting to make peace with the idea of losing another chunk of xp. But then our tank stepped up.

""I'll hold them here, all of you run out down the east corridor! Do it!"" We didn't know what good that would do, but we didn't want to make his sacrifice for nothing. We tore down the east corridor. We could hear bleeders dying and the highlander knight screaming from the room we left. As we ran we attracted a horde of zombies that were running after us. We followed the hall and it led... to a dead end. I was about to turn and go down fighting when... ""blip"". Suddenly, loading screen.

Huh... Apparently there had been a secret invisible exit to the dungeon. Our party was spit out into an...upside down house that slanted heavily to the right. We could see out the windows...some sort of demon gathering. We could even overhear some of the profane dialogue.

We all tried to gather our wits and wait for others to load in. We watched the health bar of our brave tank go down to nothing as the bleeders overwhelmed him. We thanked him for his selflessness. ""Hey, it's my job to make sure all of you survive.""
With a little deliberation we decided to try sprinting out the front door and escape from the demons. I kicked it open and we burst out. As we sprinted, demons starting flinging spells at us. We had no idea where we'd come out or where we were, but we ran. Eventually I began to realize... the river we ran alongside was ...the same river that led back to the guard tower I'd gone east at! ""Follow me men!""

We trained the demons straight back to the Camelot garrison and watched as the guards cut them down. We cheered and celebrated our escape and then met back up with our tank. Only then did we realize it was 3 in the morning. We decided to call it a night.
We added eachother to our friends lists and I ended up grouping with them at least once a week for the next several months.

I made many friends that night. In fact most of the friends I met in that game were from just doing PUGs in PUBLIC dungeons. These are things that no longer exist in modern MMOs. Everyone levels by solo questing, and follows a dotted lined on a GPS map. No one explores while hunting mobs, no one groups just for the hell of it. NPCs don't have schedules or routines. They don't travel. They're just quest dispensers located in ""hubs"" with glowing symbols to differentiate which ones are important and which ones are fillers. None of them have any character.

This is why us old curmudgeons tend to rag on newer MMOs that lack so many of the features from classic MMOs. GW2 is bringing several of those old ideas back, and is being praised heavily for it. Why can't more big budget MMOs bring back the ideas that birthed this entire genre, instead of retreading the broken ideas in WoW?
I played MMOs to socialize, and now that's just about gone. You have to be part of some clique guild and form pre arranged groups if you ever want to talk to anyone in game.",Video,False,self,t5_2wqgc,1364318029.0,video,,True,t3_1b1pvr,http://www.reddit.com/r/gametales/comments/1b1pvr/why_we_like_old_mmosdark_age_of_camelot_repost/,

Our group was in a old mine shaft searching for the cousin of one of our party members. We had encountered some Kobolds and had a feeling we would encounter more.

We came to a room with a giant tunnel and 3separate mine tracks going into the darkness. The group started to argue on what to do, and soon the actual people at the table were arguing on what to do. Using this as a time to define who I was as a Warforged Fighter(still a very fresh campaign) I got sick of the fighting and I jumped into a mine cart and took off. 

As soon as that happen our Elven Ranger, who is also a bit hot headed(young and stupid) jumped into another cart alone and took off. The last one is then filled with an artificer, cleric, rogue and some undead guy. 

As we are traveling mine carts start to surround me on the tracks.  I am on the right track and I have one in Front of me and 3 directly beside me on the middle track as they used their brakes to come up beside me. All of the carts are filled with Kobolds and their lizard type mounts. This is a bad news bears situation.

I won't bore you with the details that do not matter, however it comes out to me being in the middle mine cart with 4 kobolds, our party is still split the same, but just in different carts due to some pretty stupid jumping around. Let me use this diagram to help. 

* ME - the mine cart I am in with 4 Kobolds
* P - the party of the cleric and artificer.
* ER - the Eleven Ranger in a cart(she has been throwing hammers she picked up at the Kobolds)
* K - any cart with just Kobolds in it. 
* NC - no carts at all

-------ER----------

----ME---P---K---K

----NC----NC-----

I decided to try something a bit crazy due to my current high strength and athletics. I jam a rusted sword I had under the cart I am in to try and cause the cart to flip to help my group. It was a great success. I rolled a natural 20. The cart flips. I then roll a strength check to see if I can hold onto the cart.  I pull it off with an 18. 

Our DM now has to roll to see what happens to the cart. He rolls a 1. The cart sails OVER the party and lands onto the first Kobolds. As this is happening I roll an Athletics check and bam, natural 20. I jump towards my parties cart and grab onto the rim as there is no more room in the cart. I make another strength check of another 18 roll and I hold on. 

The DM now rolls to see how much damage this flying Kobold cart cause and he rolls a crit, so this cart hits the other cart and takes it out, knocking both of them off into another direction away from us. 

This was my first real act of desperation as I was really beat down by being by myself for the first half of the battle. I was pumped this turned out so well, and our DM stares at me in amazement as he says ""There was so many ways that could have gone wrong. That was incredible. An extra 250 xp for you.""

However,  I was able to take part in a few Hackmaster games (Kingdom builder, or something.  I dunno we had a bard king in our party and we were building a kingdom.  Also, everyone was expected to die).

I made a dwarf, a cleric I believe.  I ended up with multiple personality disorder as I was creating her, and she had a personality she didn't know about-a young girl.  She also had a phobia of worms.

The first fight she is involved in is some sort of flaming man/monster thing.  Nobody can get near him because he's surrounded by fire and it hurts everyone.  We can't think of what to do, and being the newbie and general reckless player that I am, I have my dwarf walk up and punch him in the knee, ignoring the fire.

It works.  Somehow, that single punch is enough to banish him.  I don't know why.  Maybe my cleric-ness?  It was great, and I didn't die!

We go on and suddenly the DM tells me that my other personality has taken over.  I'm suddenly a little girl.  The rest of the party is confused, I want candy.  We come across another monster...a giant worm.  Little Girl Dwarf isn't afraid of worms, and she does her best to help-but she is just a little girl.  Until the DM tells me that hey, I get control back.

My dwarf runs away from the horrible, terrifying monstrosity of a worm.  It takes a while for them to get her back.

The last time I was able to play with the group (I graduated and moved away after this, so they probably had her die or disappear afterwards), we were on a ghost ship.  Predictably filled with ghosts.  I have a spell (I can't remember what it was) that lets me banish them, but it isn't working.  I've cast it, but we're still being attacked.  Everyone's weapons are going through the ghosts, until I once more punch the captain...and he goes away.

Turns out the spell requires contact to work.

1373636240.0,23,self.gametales,1i5h05,[Pathfinder] The characters from the ongoing story,30,7,1,http://www.reddit.com/r/gametales/comments/1i5h05/pathfinder_the_characters_from_the_ongoing_story/,"The four characters in the [hobgoblin-war story I'm telling](http://www.reddit.com/r/gametales/comments/1i0jc4/pathfinder_the_beginnings_of_my_partys_troubles/) are as follows;

**Mike** - a halfling monk.  Mike grew up on an island between the northern continent of Avistan and the southern continent of Garund - world map [here](http://www.pathfinderwiki.com/mediawiki/images/a/a3/Golarion_world_map.jpg).  His parents were monks and protectors of the small village, and they had planned on raising Mike in their martial tradition.  Unfortunately, hobgoblins raided the village, killed Mike's parents and took most of the rest of the villagers as prisoners back to the main land.  Mike has rudimentary knowledge of the martial skills which are his heritage, but has had little opportunity to practice in anything other than mental battle.  His deft, small hands saw him apprenticed to a potter and set to work making small clay vessels for his hobgoblin masters - after all, every slave must work for food.

Mike, being a monk, wears no armor and simple clothing.  He is very dexterous, and is learning how to use his size to his advantage in combat (read:  becoming an [Underfoot Adept](http://www.d20pfsrd.com/races/core-races/halfling/underfoot-adept-monk-halfling) monk archetype).  Mike is played by my wife.

**Ashok** - a half-orc cleric of Torag.  Ashok's parents are an unknown to him, as he was raised by a collective of authority figures in the town he has lived his entire life in.  Being a half-orc, he was automatically relegated to second-class citizen status by the hobgoblin hierarchy, and as such has lived a mostly solitary life.  His strong frame made him a natural blacksmith, and the solitary nature of the work appealed to him (never mind its value to the society).  He was provided books and reading materiel from his ""master"" (not that said master was much of a smith himself, or literate), among which was a book titled ""Hammer and Tongs"" - the holy book of [Torag](http://www.pathfinderwiki.com/wiki/Torag).  Reading this, Ashok began to secretly worship Torag, the dwarven god.  Seeing as how there are so few dwarves left in the world, he is probably one of the last worshippers of Torag alive.  He wears a small symbol of Torag around his neck, an upside-down hammer.

Ashok is the closest thing the party has to a true tank, and is also responsible for keeping them alive via channelling positive energy to heal them.  He wears (at this point in the story) a breastplate (medium armor - clerics don't have heavy armor proficiency by default) and a steel shield, both of his own making, and wields a heavy warhammer which he also uses as a holy symbol and the favored weapon of his god.  Ashok is very introspective (high wisdom) and is played by my brother.

**Reirret Hsiri** - a gnome barbarian.  He was captured as a young adult while adventuring, and was immediately thrown into a goblin dog-fighting pit by his captors, but surprised the HobBoss by killing all the dogs and surviving.  Amused, the HobBoss gave him the dubious pleasure of being a gladiatorial slave.  While he spends most of his time as a normal labor slave with everyone else, he's regularly outfitted and made to fight for the amusement of the HobBoss. Occasionally, he's allowed to take a piece of hide from the losers and add it to his patchwork armor--the only piece of equipment he's allowed to keep when not fighting.  He has magenta hair and lime-green eyes.

Reirret wears nasty patch-work armor made from the uncured hides of the foes he beats in battle.  It smells a bit like goblin dog, and you don't want to ask what the big patch in the middle over his stomach came from.  He wields a human-sized leg-manacle clamped around a stone in his right hand (improvised flail) and has an old goblin spiked gauntlet on his left hand.  He wears a rusted goblin helmet with a big hole on top where the previous owner was brained, and his bright hair protrudes crazily from said hole.

**Ceal Gladestone** - an elven mage.  Ceal grew up on the southern continent with a clan of desert-dwelling elves.  He joined the army intent on helping rid the world of the hobgoblin hordes and protecting his homeland, but was captured in one of his first skirmishes.  He's the only member of the party who hasn't been a captive for very long, and ends up driving the party towards helping him return to the southern continent and his duties there.

Ceal stays back in combat and casts his favorite cantrip, acid splash, with varying degrees of success.  He otherwise summons nasty monsters to do his work for him, and flees from any sort of physical combat, preferring to let the more physically apt members of the party do the up-close killing.  He managed to recover his spell-book during the escape from the town, so he's not completely helpless.

But I am confident we would've won. Let me set the tone.

Oasis 4v4. 

I am the HUNS, my allies: Mongols, Teutons, Britons.

Enemies: Franks, Aztecs, Mayans, I don't remember the fourth guy.

I am in the bottom right corner of the map, snow on the ground, Dark Ages. I start harvesting sheep, berries and wood. I scout out the nearest enemy and resources. My scout gets brutally murdered in an ambush. I vow vengeance. The Aztecs. For centuries our people have feuded. But today, I would extinguish them from the planet.

I decide to Drush or Dark Age Rush 3 Militia to disrupt his economy. I killed several peasants, but I am distract. My economy is growing fast enough. He sneaks peasants into the rear of my base and builds a mill at a secondary berry bush. His eagle warrior harasses me. I tech. He techs. Archers start harassing me. I begin to wall. I can't get strong economic footing. His archer rush is working. I begin to feel a sense of hopelessness. 

He quickly techs to the castle age, and before a know it an Aztec castle is erected south of my base. I am a sitting duck. I move some peasants out as my Ally, the mongols begins constructing a forward base to dig the Aztecs out of my city. Little by little he razes my capitol, and once again the Huns are warriors without a home wandering the frigid cold. His allies begin pushing through my base, establishing a forward position. The Mongols ride hard and furious and begin pushing the line forward with the help of Red's Longbowman battalions. I manage to tech to Castle age in the rout. 

I build a Town center behind the Mongols and start pumping peasants, farms and lumber jacks. I build more Town Centers and more peasants. In 10 minutes my economy was cranking. I went from 14 peasants to 100. I had 4 town centers going, 50 farms, miners, lumberjacks. I started pump horse archers, upgrading my army, and deploying trade carts to all my allies. On the Norther Frontier the Teutons were holding the line with heavy walls and fortifications. I went from bottom score to third. The Mongols calvary, British archers and my Hun Archer and Hussar army succeeded in forced the Aztecs and their allies out of my old base. I went from 2 buildings and the brink of defeat to fielding a powerful 200 strong army. 

It was time to consolidate our troops and take the offensive. We began constructing forward operating bases of Castles and military structures and pushing into Aztec territory. I deployed an army of 60 Hussars behind enemy lines to disrupt their trade and economy. The Teutons maintained defensive positions in the North why the 3 of use began pushing the Eastern front. Little by little we gained ground. My score kept climbing. The Mongol Horde kept advancing, and unstoppable behemoth. The sky was darkened with British arrows. My Heavy Horse Archers and Hussars conducted raids and hit and run attacks on our enemies. It was glorious coming back from the edge of darkness, from being harassed from the Dark Ages. My people had advanced and resettled 5 great cities and field impressive armies. We were pushing. Bleeding for every mile of red snow we took. Victory was at hand....

Right to it. This happened last to my character last night and I've spent all day today dressed in a bathrobe as emotional compensation. I felt I had to share. 4th edition by the by.

As a bit of ideological context, our adventuring group is comprised of perversely and wonderfully selfish, amoral, shallow and juvenille characters who aren't well known for their ability to operate with tolerance and/or a moderate sense of morality. A good example of this is recently when the office of 'warden of Fallcrest' was up for grabs via democratic election three of the six members of this group ran against one another, sabotaged one another's campaign, and all ended up inadvertently imprisoning eachother. The position of warden went on to be won (while the original three candidates were in prison) by the fourth candidate put forward by two other members of the group: a horse named Dick Van Dyke.

The He-Mann-Woman-Haters-Club (the tolerant name of said juvenille group, please don't be too alienated) is currently making its way through the pungent bowels of the 'Pyramid of Shadows'. The group has a fairly solid, stock combat base, consisting of a Dragonborn Paladin (Donar K'Bib), a human wizard (Chevy Firebrand), a Dwarven fighter (Gynix Youthkind), an Elven rogue (William Castille of South Gillford) and two Tieflings (they're sort of the heart of this story) - a Bard name Littlehorn Lana, and a Warlock named Uncle Creepy. Lana's an independent lesbian with a russian accent, Uncle Creepy is a smooth-talking misogynist with a goatee so there's tension. I'm playing Lana. Whatever, enough backstory.

The six of us entered a large chamber with an enormous, bottomless pit in its center. Flanking all sides of this pit was a staircase leading downward. The chamber was dark, it stank of danger and poor cistern maintenance. We were on the highest plane of this staircase, and we were about 60ft up from the lowest plane and decided it would be a good idea to lower Castille down via a rope to the lowest plane and in doing so bypass the stairs completely. We had a strong inkling the stairs were trapped. In theory, lowering him seemed a fine solution but Gynix was lowering Castille at a very slow rate, and while he was doing so red-eyed fucking gargoyles were swooping down and attacking the dwarf. Littlehorn Lana started assisting Gynix in lowering Castille but eventually the Elf lost patience and with a flambuoyant flick of his hand, used a daily to teleport to the lowest plane with Chevvy. Chevvy the wizard had, of course, flown down already.

That's when they too started getting swooped by gargoyles but in true HMWHC fashion, they were left to deal with their shit on their initiative while K'Bib (Dragonborn) and Creepy (Tiefling Warlock) walked the stairs at a pace that jolly well befitted them. K'Bib had an idea about the imminent traps so took his time. Uncle Creepy, however, was less than patient. Creepy swept down the two flights of stairs, and in doing so was caught in the lower flight's trap - a brief crunching noise and the tiefling's feet were grabbed by rotating steps, which then fell to the right, forming a slight slope - toward the bottomless pit. Uncle slides toward the abyssal drop trying to grab onto something - he can't. Our DM says Creepy starts falling at a rate of 10ft per turn. Basically that meant we would have two turns before he vanishes out of sight. The turns are Chevvy's and Lana's. 


Now Chevvy can't do shit because his powers are good for burning down houses and minor agitation, so he just readies an action and watches Creepy plummet. When Lana's turn comes up she takes out her rope, fixes one end to an arrow, and ties the other end around her waist. She can't let the only other Tiefling die, no matter how many verbal blows they've traded about group's misogynist overtones. She fires said arrow into his chest, which is kinda counter intuitive at first glance. However once the arrow sticks into Creepy's chest the rope goes taut almost immediately. Now Lana's not a beefy character, she's lissome and acrobatic and all that other impractical stuff so in a heroic effort (Gynix and K'Bib being too far away fighting gargoyles to lend any real strength) she leaps toward the lowest plane where Chevvy and Castille are, hoping to use the ledge of that plane as a kind of fulcrum/leverage point. I roll terribly and Lana simply slips into the pitt. Fucking whoops. 

Now both Tieflings are falling headlong toward death, tied together. The table just fucking erupts with statements that run along the lines of 'Oh dear!' and everyone plays the next round standing and/or pacing; in the past the HMWHC have been selfish without exemption but they've never really endangered one another or had a inkling to endanger themselves for one another. That makes this a threshold here because Chevvy Firebrand uses his readied action, spends an action point and gets out HIS rope, which he then uses to lasso Littlehorn Lana mid plummet. He throws the other end to Gynix the Dwarf, who's essentially got a body built of steak, sweat and muscle so it's assumed Gynix has the strength to pull both up. Gynix, with both Lana and Creepy connected by rope to his waist, discovers a tad too late he actually doesn't have the strength to pull both up, rolls terribly and is summarily dragged into the bottomless pit. So uncle Creepy, with an arrow in his chest, is connected via arrow-rope to Lana, who is connected via lasso to Gynix, and they are all falling into this bottomless pit. No one is anywhere near a ledge anymore so this is looking like it. 

This is the first time the HMWHC go out of their way to be selfless and assist one another and it's getting half the group killed. That's when I remember that Lana has a power called 'shout of triumph' which generates a shockwave pushing friends and foes in all directions. Lana yells to Gynix to curl up into the foetal position. Not entirely necessary but humourous. Lana then decisively cuts the rope between her and the Dwarf and proceeds to let out a big, fortissimo amazonian shout which sends Gynix hurtling upward and onto a ledge where K'Bib grabs him and hauls him to safety. 

Now, in our previous session there'd been a massive 'king of the rats' we fought in another massive pit. Every time we tried to flank this rat king though we realised the pit wasn't actually big enough for it... So our DM coined the catchphrase 'ain't no combat advantage in the pit' which quickly became 'ain't no love in the pit'. 

But this session, as Gynix is blasted to safety Lana and Creepy get one last word to one another, where they put aside all previous misgivings, all misogyny and casual prejudice is overlooked and they say ""Looks like there is love in the pit after all"" right before they fall to their deaths together.


Bit of post-script: there's a direct quote from Uncle Creepy's backstory which should be noted: ""Creeps has never really “fit in” anywhere and has oftentimes been the subject of scorn and ridicule. At the Royal Warlock Academy he was voted most likely to die alone"".

1369089973.0,23,self.gametales,1eq47o,[D&amp;D 4e] The turning of the Rat Shifter (Part 1),26,3,3,http://www.reddit.com/r/gametales/comments/1eq47o/dd_4e_the_turning_of_the_rat_shifter_part_1/,"Hi all, this'll be my first post here but I figure this would be a good place to detail my groups exploits when those worth telling arise.

**Background:** Our group consists of myself Nohrai Shieldbreaker a Dwarf Warlord (&amp; Blacksmith), Yolo Von Swagabond CDXX a Drow Cleric, Lia an Elf Assassin and last night we met Tau the Changling Bard for the first time.

Last night was our second adventure as a party so far and we've really started warping our DM's original plans with some excellent creativity and ingenuity for all players. Which for mostly new players I'm very proud of.

**The Story:** As we join our group of three adventurers on the second day of their questing we find them working to recruit a plumber to help repair the temple the just liberated from a squatting halfling rogue. The group had to go down to the sewers take care of some beasties and some eerie operatic singing before the plumbers could finish their job for the city and move on to the temple.

Our party has just stepped down the ladder and entered the main cistern of the sewer. After lighting up the area we find a naked man with but a lute and a rapier lying down at the back of the area (Tau). While investigating a new individual a few rat hoards descend on us in silence. 

We work to squash them all when suddenly a slime crawls out from the pit and begins to trash at us with slimy acidic tentacles. Our new naked acquaintance is heavily slimed and begins suffering from acid burns everywhere. Yolo summons some water. With the only container in site being the bards loot. Tau pours the water out to wash the acid off as we finish off the slime beast.

After recovering and tending to everyone’s acid burns and rat bites. We have a quick look around the corner to see where the operatic singing is coming from.

From the darkness we here ""Take one more step or say another word I will slay you where you stand"". Nohrai attempts to converse with the individual, and succeeds to speak briefly with the individual.

After a few limited lines of dialogue we find out that the individual is Selmic, the rat man with a beautiful singing voice. Our bard gains his trust by playing the loot with him and we offer to take him above ground to perform for the people of Westgate. 

Selmic isn't too sure of the idea and seems particularly fearful of the current state of the moon. We figure out he's a shifter (and very much likely supposed to be our first solo boss). We offer to take him to the temple we restored which out of sheer coincidence is the temple of Selûne (the goddess of the moon). However, he's still not sure about going above ground.

We offer to build him a costume so he can hide and perform in plain sight without the fear of persecution from the general public. We needed to get some clothes for Tau anyway.

We come back up out of the sewers with a naked man and the site foreman and the city plumbers give us a weird look. We tell them we just need to get a few things and be back shortly, so they shrug it off.

We go to the tailor in the city and get Tau some clothes and some supplies for the costume and go about tailoring a coat, gloves and boots for Selmic (turns out Tau is fairly good at sewing). As Nohrai hammers some metal into the shape of a mask.

We return to Selmic and offer him the costume. He attempts to put it on a fails miserably, putting it on backwards. So our newly gained acquaintance Tau, approaches and sings a song about getting dressed while helping to adjust Selmic’s outfit.

Nohrai holds up his axe so Selmic can see; apprehensively he takes a look and is satisfied with the costume. It's late afternoon by now and we climb up the ladder to meet the plumbers. After coming up with another strange individual the plumbers are as confused as ever but we tell them that the sewer are safe and the music is gone. They agree to finish the job for the city and then head over to the temple.

We take Selmic with us over to the temple of Selûne and have the cleric sisters look him over. They agree it's a case similar to lycanthropy, but he turns into a rat king instead. For the second largest coincidence of the day we find that it's actually a New Moon and one of the only times the sisters can cure Selmic's affliction.

That night they perform the ritual and Selmic is cured of his curse and ready to pursue his career of being an operatic singer for the realm.

**TL;DR:** Climbed down a sewer, found a naked guy and battled some slime. Encountered a singing rat man and solo boss. Reasoned with him, built him a costume and cured him of his rat shifting. Our hardest boss to date will now be an operatic singer for the world of Faerun.

*Footnote 1:* When I mention coincidences, they were all pre-arranged prior to any of the events taking place not some dodgy dice rolling.

Part 1,40,16,19,http://www.reddit.com/r/gametales/comments/1dzrhw/planet_side_2_the_long_journey_home_part_1/," Weapons loaded, ammo is full, looks like we are ready. There are about 10 of us in our galaxy, all of us ready for combat. It's my first mission with these guys. They like to pride themselves in being the most friendly squad and the most fun, yet I feel a sense of seriousness with this mission. Our objective is to defend our biodome on Indar. It's the last remaining bio-dome for the Vanu collective. We land on the top floor of the bio-dome and immediatly start prepping defence for the oncoming onslaught of enemy troops. The New conglomerate and the Teran republic are both coming. Our spies indicate a Large force from both sides. 

  Several turrest have been setup and manned. Since I am a soldier I'm just sitting behind cover waiting. My friend next to me, nicknamed ""joker"" whispers in his comm ""Oh look, fancy technology means jack shit to wanna be zerglings"" ""HUSH!"" yelled the commander, ""this is serious, now is not the time for jokes""

  We all knew our fate, we were going to die. In the distance we see several fighters and liberators. About 30 of each, coming from 2 different directions. Everyones knows the rules of chess, send in your pawns. Explosions begin going on all around us. The enemys have noticed eachother as well. Liberators are bombing, and fighters are dogfighting. We stay put waiting for the enemy. We see a friendly trooper running for his life at us. He jumps behind our cover source.

  He isn't from our squad, and he makes it very clear on the comms, ""Holy fuck holy fuck!."" We repeatedly ask him to calm down untill he finally does. ""They flew in a galaxy and on it were these...suits! these battle suits and they just wiped out my whole sq..."" An explosion cuts off our comms. A new experimental NC battle suit is charging us. We open fire. The monstrosity of ill-fated tech brushes the bullets right off. Joker pulls out his RPG and shoots the bastard. It explodes in a fury of fire. 

  Nobody has seen that version of pawns before, but we knew there had to be more on their way. The liberators had left the seen and the fighters soon followed suite. ""Looks like the worst is over"", the kid said.  We knew he was wrong though, but joker couldn't help but to lie ""Sure thing kid."" As we look at the horizon we see a fleet of 50 galaxies int he air, 20 sunders, about 40 tanks approaching. 

   ""Repeat to all platoons fall back, I repeat fall back!"" Before the real fun began, bummer. We pack our things and head to our galaxy. The pilot gets in and does a quick system check, all is go. As we approached our galaxy we hear a screaching roar. A liberator soars past us and drops its payload onto our galaxy. Before I realized our commander and 2nd in command were close to the galaxy, and with that they were gone. Without a way for them to clone themselves, we were on our own. 

  9 of us, leaderless, and in  a desperate state of realization that we have to escape. With only 5 of us having jetpacks, there was no way the other 3 could escape alive. We decided to bunker down at an exit point. We could hear the galaxies land and hear the stomps of marchin troopers. What fools they were, fighting for governments that could care less about them, but who am I to fault them for misconceptions of infantry life, I too was tricked. 

   Fire going all around us, rarely do we duck out of cover to gte that 3 round burts into the enemies skulls. ""Fuck fuck fuck they are overwhelming us!"" yells rick, our infiltrator. Rick was a quit man, so hearing him was shocking enough. The enmy was slowly gainign ground untill we heard explosions at the end of the corridor. The Terran republic have arrived and decided the NC were more of a threat. We saw this as a chance to escape. We sprint to our end of the corridor to the exit. We forgot only 5 of us can escape alive. ""Well, looks like it's a one way trip on either side of me, might as well die as a man"" said joker. He didn't fear death, and he was ready. Rick and john joined him. They charged the enemy. The rest of us jumped, slowly using our jetpack to calmly fall down. We land safely, but shock finally sank in. Joker is dead, he was the first person to say hi to me when I joined this squad.

Where we left off before, I had just woken up from being choked out by my enemy Scarface while a massacre-by-werewolf raged on around us. I had 1 HP, and there were zombies munching on the recently slain in the smouldering ruins. I stealthily got up and recovered my 30.06 and .357 and hid behind a turned-over table. Gathering my wits, I made a quick decision to explore the werewolf's entrance into our stronghold as my exit. With some good rolls I blew away the zombies blocking my way with my deer rifle and fled through the broken barricade before the others could get to me, reloading as I ran. 

Outside, an unatural fog obscured the sun and made it hard to see anything at a distance. I continued onward and had the fortune of meeting 3 other survivors, all ill-equipped teenagers. They're heading to the graveyard they said. Pfft, hell no we aint. I desperately search for an alternate route out of town, but apparently this whole little section of small town Texas has suddenly been isolated from the rest of Texas by a chasm of nothingness. Apparently the narrowest point is over the wall of the graveyard. Apparently our only option is to go to the god damned graveyard. It's a Call of Cthulhu game, you should never voluntarily go to a graveyard, especially while experiencing unnatural fog AND the resurrection of the dead; it's just stupid.

Yet we go to the graveyard anyhow, because it's not like that chasm of nothingness is going to jump itself. Of course there are zombies inside the walled interior of the compound and these teenagers suck at sneaking past them, so the girl gets grabbed. We all try to beat it off of her unsuccessfully for a few rounds while a few more zombies move nearer to the commotion. We succeed in freeing the girl, but she is almost immediately grabbed again. Grabbing the arm of one of the male teenagers, I scream ""There's no time!"" and drag him towards the wall at the other end of the graveyard, leaving the girl and her boyfriend to their fates.

With my teenaged diversion drawing all the attention of the oncoming zombies it was easy for my helper to boost me up onto the wall. I turned to help him climb up as well, but he was stuck. One of those things must have grabbed him! Risking myself, I leaned out to see what he was caught on....Slender Man! I stared into that featurless face as my vision went from hazy, to red, to black. I dropped the teenager who had helped my escape and fell backwards off of the wall, unconscious by the time I hit the ground.

I owned the game, so I got in a lot more practice than them. They knew I was good, and often accused me of cheating. Apart from the gameshark codes mentioned above, I didn't cheat.

On that level there is a main corridor with explosive boxes that would engulf the area. During one game I was at one side of this corridor, and my friend popped through the closed double doors at the other end. He was armed with an RCP90. I had my karate chop hand. I ran at him at an angle because I had ascertained that it makes me run faster. He shot at me wildly, but I was bobbing and weaving. My friend then turned his sites to the boxes. All it would take is one hit from the fire and I would be dead.

I ran into the fire... then out the other side unscathed. My friend freaked out and kept firing as he ran backwards through the door. I continued to chop. There was a brief moment when my friend, while still pulling the trigger, thought that he may get me because RCP90 bullets go through doors. He did not, and I burst through the door and chopped him in the face. I put my controller down, looked him in the eyes and asked, ""How did I beat you?""

An aging ex-male prostitute wizard,
A human monk whose CMB is probably higher than yours,
and a elf druid with a savage pet wolf.

Our party was charged by their employer to investigate an apartment, and apprehend its occupant dead or alive.

The druid gets in first, and casts Obscuring Mist to cover her and the fighter's entrance into the room. They discover they are in the same room as their target, and draw weapons.

Rolls maximum damage on his die and ends up dealing 18 damage on his first hit. The fighter goes down.

It is an anime system that has a very broad set of rules that we could easily adapt to work for Star Wars.  Last week we sat down to work out characters and get a “sample” session in.

Journal of Tisk Tall’in of the world Dorin

Centaxday, 2nd week after the Festival of Life, 29 A.B.Y.

I knew pretty quickly that this run would be difficult.  We had been contracted out by the remnants of an Imperial Navy fleet to find Brinmore Ortease and his cargo.  Ortease is a human smuggler that aligned himself with the Yuuzhan Vong insurgence, and now needs to be brought to justice.   He’s clearly a worse smuggler then myself, I certainly wouldn’t get caught if I found myself wrapped up in a mess like that.  

We travelled from Bastion, and the end of the Braxant Run.  A friend of mine on Bastion had heard that the man named Ortease had fled into Wild Space, found this little planet, and settled in real nice.  Would be hard to find, the planet’s off the hyperspace routes and doesn’t show up on too many star maps.  But he underestimates the Autumn Shadow, and me.  Once we set adrift in Wild Space, it wasn’t long until we found the planet.  I radioed down for landing coordinates and received no response.  As I made my way into the atmosphere, I quickly understood why.  There were no space ports, no landing strips, nothing.  

I landed the Autumn in a field of rolling hills, obscuring the craft from the outside world.  We exited the craft and Killön stretched out his long neck and arms.  The Kaminoan is not well-suited for travel onboard the Autumn.  As he stood up straight and tall, he pointed out that we would stick out as Wookie does in a group of Ewoks on this planet.  Go’grin, as the locals call it, is a small, mostly unknown world just under a parsec into Wild Space, and outsiders are not necessarily welcome.  From what we could know, the planet is mostly populated by humans, with a few non-human refugees running around, but they are all technophobes. They seem to enjoy the simple life, with simple ground based transportation and very few modern luxuries like food synthesizers and land-speeders.  We walked up a hill to the west of my ship, silently.

As we crested the hill, Darth Chortle pointed towards a city a few kilometers away as if to suggest that is where we need to go.  It was a nice gesture as always, almost mocking Killön and me with his silence.  Better the silence then the alternative, his Tuskan ramblings can wear me down so quickly.  We continued on our way on foot.

It was not very long before we were among the populace; we quickly found what we were searching for, information on the whereabouts of Ortease.  We found out that Ortease arrived less than a year ago and is now employed in a warehouse about 7 kilometers outside of the town.  It wasn’t hard to find this information; it almost seemed that they were glad to help us find him, like they were hoping we would take him back away from this place.  The locals informed us that the best way to get transport out to the warehouse would be a taxi, a slow moving land-based transport that drives on paved roads.  The barkeep called a taxi for us, and it arrived shortly.  The driver hesitated when he saw the three of us.  For a moment he appeared to consider driving off without us, but the lure of a good fare was enough, and he nervously let us in.    Killön told him the location of the warehouse and we set off.  

A few minutes later, we arrived outside of the warehouse.  The driver of the taxi drove off quickly after we paid him (Chortle was “kind” enough to obtain local currency from one of the locals, supposedly won in a game of chance).  We walked once around the warehouse.  The warehouse itself was one of the larger buildings we had seen on this planet.  The north side, facing the road, appeared to be some sort of docking area.  There were three massive ground vehicles picking up and dropping off large crates, and three other large openings on the wall, where I presume additional vehicles could load and unload cargo.    On the east side, there was an attached office building; the west side overlooked a large plot of paved ground, littered with a few dozen vehicles resembling the taxi we had arrived in.  The west side itself had a single entrance up a short flight of stairs.  The south side appeared to have two more entrances.  When we returned to the north side, Chortle fell to the ground and began convulsing, barking and shouting in his native Tuskan language… such a terrible noise.  Killön and I waited like usual, watching over his body as it seized and writhed.  We discussed the relative merit of abandoning him here or throwing him into a Sarlacc pit.

1369097589.0,22,self.gametales,1eqe7c,[Pathfinder] Three farmboys head out into the world. [Minor NSFW],32,10,12,http://www.reddit.com/r/gametales/comments/1eqe7c/pathfinder_three_farmboys_head_out_into_the_world/,"This is the diary entry I wrote for my character for the first session of a new campaign for Pathfinder. I'll apologise in advance for the tags which explain some of the shops we went into that we didn't write the names down for.

Where to begin? It was a Thursday. I had just finished my chores for the day – lessons with Father Volurn (discussing the implications of the Starstone on mortal society and the impacts that it creates). I was done mid-afternoon and after doing some minor things for the family I settled in at the tavern for a drink or two.

I’m not sure which alarm I heard first – the fire alarm or the raid alarm. Callum, Zazas and I rushed out the door to the sights and sounds of several buildings on fire. I heard a chittering in the alleyway, and with a cry of alarm, I drew my bow and swiftly moved to the alleyway.
I was rewarded by my haste with a close encounter with goblin weaponry and my fool companion’s arrow through my back, but the three of us pushed back the goblins (admittedly I did little, merely frightening one away with a fear spell).

I woke shortly after to Zazas pulling his arrow from my back and patching me up. We headed back to the centre of town and helped put out the remaining fires, at which point I limped home to bed.
The next morning, we were roused from our beds at dawn and for the first time, I got to meet the captain of the guard. It was easy to tell that he wasn’t a local of Shortwheat, because of the banners. I only recognized a few names, but any I did told a story – he was a veteran. The town council was there, too.

They told us that we would be tracking the goblins back to wherever they came from, and wiping them out, if they were few enough that we could handle. If they were larger than we could deal with, then we were to take message of this to the capital so that reinforcements could be sent to our aid.

So off we set, Callum the novice knight, Zazas the budding huntsman, and I the amateur defender of the faith.
Tracking was firmly in Zazas’s bailiwick, and at the beginning we made good headway. He foundered several miles out from our home, but after an extended lunch break we returned to the correct path, which led us up into the wooded foothills to the northwest of our home. 
As we passed through the woods, along a minor trail, Zazas snagged a tripwire and luckily dodged a crossbow bolt that was sailing towards his head, although we were all startled. With the knowledge that we were nearing the den of the goblins, we moved far more cautiously, a move which saved us a great deal of grief. As we pushed forward, I noticed that a section of ground had been dug up – sure sign of another trap. As we carefully dug away at it, we found several vials of what would later be determined as alchemist’s fire.

At this point, we determined that the goblins had in fact come from a cave system within the nearby hills, and so we said that if we ran in to anything more than goblins, we would leave and call for reinforcements.

And that’s when the orc spotted us.

The ensuing battle was a challenge, by any definition of the word – Zazas lost the string of his bow in a panicked pull, and my fear spell was as ineffective as I expected. To say that Callum was the savior would be accurate, as almost the entirety of the opposing force was shattered on his lance.

We were hurting, but we pushed onwards, and in the cave we discovered a bounty unlike anything we’d seen. Armor, weapons, trinkets, enough to sell to provide for our home for years. It was not without risk – Zazas discovered what Callum knew to be a nest of hydra, and with this in mind we carefully withdrew from the cave and trekked to Silverwater.

We stopped at the Silverlight Inn for the night, with no real events of interest. 
The day afterward, we began to head into Silverwater. We weren’t ready for the wait for ‘customs’ – I’ve never experienced something so silly as this. Five gold, of which I paid three and Callum paid two, saw us through the gates after a near-interminable wait.
Winding our way through the city, we came to Duncan's Jewellery, recommended to us by a number of local residents.

Entering the shop, and taking a seat, we noticed one particular detail – a stunningly beautiful woman, the bookkeeper of the jeweller, by the name of Josephine. We handled our business – a stunning one hundred and ninety gold pieces, handled to us in platinum pieces – platinum! And the final crowning gift of it was, on the back of the receipt, an invitation to a dinner party with the lovely Josephine and some others.
If my father could see me, he would undoubtedly have been less than impressed at our wasteful spending. New clothes from The Golden Thread, a tailor's shop, and a clarification on a cloak we picked up – demonhide. And I’d been wearing it for the last few days.

New armor was the next thing we needed, to sell off and refurbish. One set of new scale mail, one agile breastplate for Callum, and several arrows for Zazas, and we were on our way.
A short stop at the baths rounded out our preparations for the night, and the carriage sent us on our way.

The villa in question could’ve housed dozens of people at home, but few people were seen here. We were met at the door by Josephine herself, and led into a hall with several other men and women. As we talked, I noticed an unusual symbol on Josephine’s back – three daggers, pointing outwards from a circle.

She was a servant of Calistria.

We might be in trouble.

Sadly, I didn’t have time to get this information out to them. A meal, far in excess of what anyone at our home had ever experienced, followed by a break in the drawing room, and back for dessert. After this, three of the men and four of the women departed, leaving the three of us with Josephine, Rebecca and Haley.

And before we knew it, it was the morning after and I was waking up in a bed far more luxurious than mine.

Shit.

The next few days, I’ll leave out the specifics, but the truth of it is that the events of that night meant that we were, according to Calistrian doctrine, basically in an exclusive ‘relationship’ with these women. When I pushed the matter, on the last day of our stay, they told us that in the creation of this ‘bond’ they had pledged their services to ours until the end of days. Worryingly enough, the three of them were a witches coven.

So now we’re heading to the capital, to see to the delivery of our letter for reinforcements.

1367991520.0,22,self.gametales,1dx00o,The Rise of The Sixth House and The Betrayal of Dagoth Nerevar [The Elder Scrolls III Morrowind],23,1,1,http://www.reddit.com/r/gametales/comments/1dx00o/the_rise_of_the_sixth_house_and_the_betrayal_of/,"About a year ago, I was running a mod on Morrowind called ""Great House Dagoth"", which can be found [here](http://planetelderscrolls.gamespy.com/View.php?view=mods.detail&amp;id=801).

Anyways.... To give a quick summary of this mod, it is a mod that enables you to allow for the Corpus disease to overtake you and make you an Ash Zombie. After becoming an Ash Zombie, you can go see Dagoth Ur (The game's BBEG) in the Red Mountain and side with him. Then he'll send you out on some tasks and let you work your way up to becoming an Ash Vampire.

Before I go any further, if you are remotely interested in playing this mod and not wanting it spoiled, then stop reading now.

So I side with Dagoth Ur, and work my way up to becoming an Ash Vampire, at which point Dagoth Ur offers me to merge myself with The Heart of Lorkhan. For those of you who don't know, The Heart of Lorkhan is an ancient relic that Dagoth Ur merged himself with to become a god. Essentially, by merging with the Heart of Lorkhan as well, you too become a god.

After merging with the Heart of Lorkhan, Dagoth Ur dubbed me Dagoth Nerevar, and sent me out to fulfill the prophecies of the Nerevarine. So I casted the spell to turn me into my human form and went about gathering support from the other houses. 

Once they were gathered, I went back to Dagoth Ur to receive my final mission from him.... Kill Vivec, retrieve Wraithguard, and bring The Ministry of Truth crashing down onto Vivec's Temple. I went forth and fulfilled the task, beating Vivec in one-on-one combat whilst using my godly powers. Afterwords I took Wraithguard, and casted a powerful spell that sent the Ministry of Truth crashing into his temple, leaving the entirety of Vivec in waste and ruin.

I returned to Dagoth Ur with Wraithguard, as well as Sunder and Kenning, which I received from Dagoth's confidants. Then Dagoth gave me one final order which involved using Sunder and Kenning on the Heart of Lorkhan in a certain order that would grant us ultimate power over Morrowind, where we would rule side by side...... The problem was, I wanted Morrowind all for myself.

I knew there was no way I could feasibly defeat Dagoth Ur, as destroying the Heart of Lorkhan would mean I would lose my powers as well. However, he couldn't feasibly defeat me either, because the heart made me just as powerful as him.

So I took to my Ash Vampire form, and began wailing on Dagoth Ur, battling atop a bridge of molten lava. Every time I struck him, his health would be regenerated by the power of the heart, and the same would happen to me every time he delivered a blow. Eventually I was able to drive him from the bridge and onto the heart's alter. Slowly but surely, Dagoth Ur kept falling back farther and farther, until he was standing on the edge of a cliff. Then with one final blow, I sent Dagoth Ur falling into the fiery pit below.

Now, just because the Heart of Lorkhan made him effectively immortal, it didn't mean Dagoth Ur didn't feel pain. The lava burnt away at Ur's flesh, and the heart restored his health just as quickly as the lava took it. Dagoth Ur's own godhood had become his downfall, as he was now damned to bathe in molten hot lava for all eternity, and would never be granted the luxury of Death's sweet embrace. I then committed the final ritual on the Heart of Lorkhan and took control of Morrowind. From that day forth, the Sixth House was no more. Instead, it was the Seventh House. The Great House of Dagoth Nerevar.

TL;DR Morrowind mod allows me to join the badguy, rise through the ranks, become a god, kill him, and rule over Morrowind.  ",Video,False,self,t5_2wqgc,False,video,,True,t3_1dx00o,http://www.reddit.com/r/gametales/comments/1dx00o/the_rise_of_the_sixth_house_and_the_betrayal_of/,

Most of you, if you are familiar with him at all, know him from his Half-Life 2 comic ""Concerned"", but almost everything he's made is a ton of fun, except for his most recent site, Screen Cuisine, which is often a bit of a bore in my opinion. At least he's hosting all his old stuff on there too.

What I'd like to show you today is probably my favourite piece of writing by him. In it he attempts to create and play as a non-player character in Oblivion, or at least try to emulate it as much as possible. It turns out that trying to avoid adventure in a game that tries to feed it down your throat, is a lot of fun - at least with Christopher Livingston documenting it.

I got very lucky in that I married a woman who likes to roleplay. The more complex details of some games sometimes give her trouble, but I had had pretty decent success teaching her 4th ed. D&amp;D. One day a buddy of mine approached us and asks if we’re interested in a campaign, and of course we say that we are. When we sit down the first night, we’ve got a pretty well-rounded party: a rogue/assassin, a dwarf cleric (with a hammer he named Danny Boy), a female elf barbarian (barbarianess?), me, the runepriest, and then my wife, who rolls up Astrianna the Storm Sorceress. Wife took every possible spell and advantage that she could to fine-tune her character into a death-dropping magic machine, and she loved playing her.

A couple of sessions in, we discover a shop in town is a front for a smuggler’s den, and what’s more, our rogue snuck in the upstairs window and uncovered some important documents we needed. Fight breaks out. We’re scrambling to swing swords and great hammers in the confines of the tiny shop, the rogue comes at them from behind from their own stairway, Astrianna is trying not to nuke her own party. The cleric declares this place a hotbed of sin and an affront to honest businessmen, so he (with the DM’s permission plus a really good roll) uses the “dwarven secrets of flame and stone” and sets the building on fire. And then comes back around to the front entrance to (a) help us fight, and (b) make sure none of the smugglers escape.
The DM comes up with an on-the-fly method to simulate the fire spreading, and after a few rounds the small shop is getting even smaller. We start filing out. The rogue hops over flames and gets out first, followed by the barbarianess and the cleric. I declare I’m going last, to cover everyone’s escape, and hold my shield up in a defensive stance. Astrianna had a better idea.

She calls up a Wall of Water, and puts it between us and them. At this point there are five smugglers left. Astrianna and I start backing towards the door, and the smugglers all attempt to jump through the Wall. On a successful save, they can swim through it just fine.

Every single one of them fails. They’re trapped inside the Wall. We could have just left them there. But no. *Astrianna had a better idea.*

My wife gets this manic look in her eye and shoots a lightning spell into the Wall, *electrifying the entire thing.* Five guys, dead in a single shot, left to burn with their shop.

A session or two later, those documents we got from that shop lead us to an orcish slave ring. We sally forth to storm their fortress. Normally my character was the one who would call for diplomacy first, but these guys were slavers, so I disregarded that as an option. We decide to do this kick-in-the-door style. Barbarianess and cleric get highest initiative rolls and charge, only to be immediately swarmed by orcs. 

Then it’s Astrianna’s turn. One of her favorite spells is a burst, and the orcs have all bunched up around the two of us, forming a perfect 3x3 grid.

There’s a moment of silence as the table considers what’s about to happen. Two PCs and seven enemy orcs, filling out *exactly* the space her spell hit. The guy playing the dwarf just shrugs. He ain’t even mad. “Go ahead,” he says. “You’ll never have this opportunity again.”

Astrianna drops a freaking storm on them. Hits everyone. Nearly killing our cleric in the process, but dealing a truly massive amount of damage. It was an easy feat to mop up after that. It’s probably my wife’s favorite moment in gaming.

Sadly, the campaign sort of folded after that due to scheduling conflicts, and we never got to finish our adventure. I know I’m interested in bringing that character back someday. I sort of fear what happens when my wife brings back Astrianna.

[DnD Metagame],25,3,5,http://www.reddit.com/r/gametales/comments/1bznwp/what_happens_when_an_immovable_object_is_met_by/,"Recently had a rather interesting (read: frustrating) encounter playing with my DnD group.

Our party is fighting a gnoll deathknight, the BBEG for our current mission. Now, our DM was pretty new, and had unwittingly sent us up against an enemy just a tad too strong for us. Most of us needed a 16-17 just to hit, meaning over 3/4 of our attacks weren't connecting. On top of that, it could teleport, making flanking nigh-impossible.

We had one thing going for us: I was playing a human invoker, and had just gained an ability that effectively gave a stacking 5-hp shield to everyone in my party once per turn. That is to say, if they didn't get hit, after 4 turns they would have 20 points of shield. Coupling that with the fact that the gnoll had extremely limited AoE abilities, and could typically only attack one person per turn, and we suddenly had a situation where, while we couldn't damage it, it simultaneously couldn't damage us.

After two hours we finally got the thing to half health; the DM said ""screw it"" and had the gnoll trip on its sword and die. It was a cop-out, but no one cared; it was after midnight and we all had morning classes.

Let this be a cautionary tale, DMs: if the party has an invoker, make sure you either give the BBEG lots of AoE, or get the invoker to waste the ""Symbol of Hope"" ability before you get to the BBEG.",Table,False,self,t5_2wqgc,1365518058.0,table,author,True,t3_1bznwp,http://www.reddit.com/r/gametales/comments/1bznwp/what_happens_when_an_immovable_object_is_met_by/,

We make the setting fluid to allow us to keep it fun without worrying about it being strictly canon.

We are in a city (name forgotten and will be referred to as The Town) on Tatooine which is controlled by a Mandalorian leader named Canderous Ordo, who is rumored to be Mandalore by many on Tatooine. The Sith Empire has recently forced the galactic government into surrender and has established a fledgling empire. A group called the deatheaters opposes them, but has yet to win any significant victories. One of the party members has recently been installed as the warchief of the local clan of Tusken Raiders, while another party member is a member of the local town Council of Lords and head of a smuggling organization disguised as a mercenary company.The party has discovered the location of 3 secret weapon caches owned by Canderous Ordo and has decided to raid the caches to arm the Tuskens and prepare to take the town. There are 2 weapon caches in The Town hidden in lightly guarded underground bunkers and 1 in a heavily fortified fort in the desert.

The party consists of:

Podo - an old, slightly senile human well versed in both hand to hand and lightsaber combat. He was appointed leader of the clan of Tusken Raiders by the Mandalorian military leader that oversees The Town.

Chipper - A ex-mercenary human and expert marksman. He has political ties to the council of lords, a political organization tasked with overseeing the interests of the citizenry of the town with the Mandalorian military leader.

Ki Cross - An ex-Jedi leader of a smuggling organization in The Town and master with of lightsaber. He was, until her death, married to the former warchief of the local Tusken clan. She was replaced by Podo upon her death by Canderous Ordo, the Mandalorian military leader of The Town.

Edam Ur - An ex-Jedi affiliated with Ki's smuggling business and with The Deatheaters, a group dedicated to bringing down the newly established Sith Empire. He discontinued his use of his force powers and is trained in and wields a great vibrohammer. He is a high functioning drunk and carries a jug filled with a mixture of liquors around his neck.

-------------------------------------------------------------------

The party decided to have Podo send the warriors of the Tusken clan to assault and raid the fort, while the party would split into two strike teams and simultaneously take the two bunkers in the city. Chipper would sneak into one of the bunkers with Edam obtaining an unmarked box hover-truck and waiting for Chipper to neutralize the guard. Podo and Ki would strike the second bunker with Ki's bodyguard, Kragg, driving their transport.

Chipper destroyed the camera outside and entered the bunker, stealthily dispatched a guard, and gained access to the underground warehouse. Inside, he climbed onto the top of some shelving, remaining undetected by the handful of guards nearby, and took stock of the layout of the large room before him.

Meanwhile, Edam had parked legally nearby the bunker and retreated to the sleeper car in the truck and waited in his underclothes for the call over the coms from Chipper signally the all clear. Suddenly there was a knock on the window and Edam moved up to the seat to see a security officer staring up at him. He lowered the windo and said, ""Can I help you?""
The officer replied, ""Permits please.""
Edam handed him the falsified papers given to him by Ki and awaited a response. The officer looked them over and then said, ""The curfew in effect requires that all commercial vehicles remain in the dock area from dusk until dawn.""
""I'm parked legally, I couldn't know the regulations, but I'm here now and sleeping until I depart in the morning. Is this really necessary?""
""I'm just following orders sir, you can stay here tonight, but I''ll need to see your cargo and scan your manifest,"" the officer replied with lassitude.
Edam, fearing he would be found out, leaned into the man's face and angrily said, ""Listen here son, I've not broken any laws here. I'm not causing trouble. I'm in my damn pajamas, for god's sake. I didn't fight in the Mandalorian Wars so some shitheaded prick of a traffic cop could hassle me over curfew regulations as I pass through this shithole town. Now you ask me to get out of this truck and walk you back to look at the food crates stored in the back? If I get out of this truck, it will be to kick your skinny little ass!""
The guard, wide-eyed and in awe, said ""You fought in the Mandalorian Wars!?""
Edam looked him angrily in the eye and said ""Get out of my face, kid,"" then closed the window and went back to his sleeper compartment. The officer composed himself and walked away from the parked truck.

Podo and Ki entered their bunker and took a turbo lift down to their underground warehouse and neutralized the guard manning the security station. They entered the warehouse and began checking the weapons crates stacked on the shelves when they heard a commotion on the far end of the warehouse.

Chipper saw from his perch on top of the shelves that the two bunkers were connected and that Podo and Ki had just entered on the far side of the room. He climbed down the shelving and looked for a way to deal with the nearby guards. Finding a crate of grenades, he took out eight of them, created a daisy chain with them, and prepared to arm and throw them into the group of men. He flubbed the throw and they landed too close to him to avoid and exploded, sending him backwards into the shelving and wounding him. The explosion killed all but two of the guards. Chipper drew his blaster and shot the first in the forehead, dropped to a knee and shot the second in his chest. He yelled across to Podo and Ki, who had come to investigate the commotion, and they began to carry the weapons crates up to the waiting trucks which had both pulled up to the building Chipper had entered.

They finished loading the trucks with an hour left before dawn, when the gates of the city would open for the day. They began driving down some side roads oft used by Ki in his smuggling business towards the gates of the business district. By using the side streets they would avoid the attention of any security forces that may be on the main roads at the cost of speed.

A short while on the road and they saw ahead a commotion. Security forces had set up a crime scene on the side of the road. As they drove past both drivers looked and saw the crime scene was set up around two corpses with ritualistic symbols carved into every inch of visible skin. Kragg, driving the first vehicle, was distracted by the bodies and didn't notice a security cruiser pull into his path and bumped it with his truck. A security officer stepped out of his vehicle and approached the truck.
""Permits, please,"" He said to Ki in the passenger seat.
Ki handed him the permits and said, ""rough night?""
""Nevermind my night, what are you transporting and why are you breaking curfew? This is against regulations.""
Ki shot the officer a genial smile and replied, ""Oh I know the regulations, officer, I helped write them after all. We have some supplies urgently needed by the Tuskens and we need to get it out there as soon as possible. Just trying to be the first out of the gate.""

While this conversation was happening, Edam, driving the rear truck, noticied the security officer near him was a commander by the name of Hexx, second in command to Canderous Ordo and a person with whom the party had interacted with in the past. She noticed the stopped truck ahead and began to walk slowly towards his window.

""I understand your position, but regulations are regu-wait, I know you. you're Lord Ki. I tell you what, you make it worth my while and I'll forget I saw you this evening.""
Ki sighed and dropped a thousand credits into his hand, ""This is from the council coffers so don't forget-""
""-embezzling from the council too, eh? Better make that two thousand, Lord Ki,"" the guard drawled.
Grumbling, Ki dropped an extra thousand credits into his hand and told Kragg to continue.

As commander Hexx reached the truck door, Ki's truck began moving and Edam quickly began to pull off behind. Hexx slammed her fist against the door to get Edam's attention. She was ignored. She trotted alongside the truck slamming her fist on the door until it was moving too fast to keep up with. She then broke off and approached the guard that spoke with Ki. They turned a corner as the two began to speak.

When the trucks were halfway to the gates, the lead truck passed an alley and Ki noticed a security vehicle in the alley. By the time Edam's truck passed the alley the cruiser had switched on its lights and pulled out of the alley behind Edam. As the cruiser attempted to approach the truck, the cargo door opened on Chipper, who was standing in the box compartment lashed to the wall. He smiled at the security officer as he fired the rocket launcher on the pursuing cruiser. As the cruiser exploded behind the truck, Edam let out a hearty laugh and took a swig of his jug, belching afterwards.

After the encounter with the Security cruiser, Ki and Edam pulled their trucks onto the main thoroughfare and drove side by side taking up the whole road and sped up their trucks to hasten their trip to the gates. They hadn't gone far when several cruisers pulled out behind them sirens blaring in full pursuit. The trucks were fast approaching a marketplace with merchants just beginning to open their stalls for the day. The trucks fell into single file and began sounding their horns to warn the merchants of their approach.

Chipper looked about the weapons boxes to find a way to deal with the dozen or so cruisers pursuing them. He spied some energy cells strapped to the wall and kicked at the strap securing them. They broke away and went bouncing into the midst of the cruisers. He fired his blaster at one a caused it to explode setting off a chain reaction scattering or destroying the pursuing cruisers and causing a massive amount of collateral damage to the surrounding buildings.

They approached the gates which had just opened for the day and began to speed up even further. A guard ran into the gatehouse and seconds later the gates began to slowly draw to a close.
""Strap in, Chipper. This is gonna be rough. They're closing the gates,"" Edam called over the radio.
Chipper, fearing they wouldn't clear the gates, leaped out of the cargo truck, swinging on his life line into the space between the trucks. He steadied himself against the side of truck and fired a rocket at the gate ahead. The rocket exploded and badly damaged, but didn't destroy, the gate.

Ki's truck slipped through the gate, just scraping past the left gate. Edam's truck couldn't clear it and slammed into the right gate, knocking it off it's hinges and causing it to bounce off of the top of the cargo bay before falling behind the truck. The docking plate became unlatched and slid out from the bay to drag the ground behind the truck. Chipper was thrown backwards and his life line snapped. He landed on the docking plate and just managed to grab hold of it to be dragged behind the truck as well.

Two speeders pulled out from the gatehouse in fast pursuit of the trucks. One pulled up alongside the cab of Ki's truck and began motioning to Ki to pull over to the side of the road. He then dropped behind the truck and fired a warning shot past Ki's cab. The second speeder pulled alongside the docking plate and Chipper and pointed his sawed off blaster at him. Chipper leaped from the docking plate towards the speeder, but not fast enough to avoid being clipped by a shot from the guard's blaster. He still managed to land on the speeder behind the guard and knocked him from the driver's seat with a well aimed elbow to the temple. He then pulled up behind the second speeder, the driver unaware of his presence, and shot the man from the vehicle. He then pulled to the lead of the convoy and the three vehicles sped off into the desert.

we ended the session there, not knowing the fate of the Tusken army that laid siege to the Third cache in the desert.

1367317940.0,24,self.gametales,1deiqw,"[Dungeons of Dredmor] The Life and Death of Nosferatu VI - the vampire who could polymorph into a bat, but not a bass",26,2,7,http://www.reddit.com/r/gametales/comments/1deiqw/dungeons_of_dredmor_the_life_and_death_of/,"For those not in the know, Dungeons of Dredmor is a humorous roguelike-made-accessible. Contrary to most roguelikes, it features actual graphics (rather than ASCII-graphics), has three difficulty levels, and features custom skill-based builds, rather than pre-defined classes.

According to Steam, I've clocked in 179 hours in this game, and I have yet to beat it. I have come darn near close on a good handful of occasions, with two different builds: a fire-wielding mathemagician, and a counter-based sword wielding vampire. Every time I have come close to beating the game, I have become overconfident or inattentive, and made a really silly mistake which ended up killing me, like walking into my own stacked firewalls, immediately killing me.

This story, however, is the tale of both my most recent, my closest-to-victory, and most embarrassing death. This is the tale of Nosferatu VI - the sixth generation of a long line of vampire fencers, of which he was the most successful to date, yet still considered the black sheep of the family.

The success of my vampire-build, has only been possible due to the changing of how vampirism works in the later versions of Dungeons of Dredmor. In previous versions, the life leech and added damage from vampirism was based on your Magic Power, which means that you'd have to stack magic skill trees (which consist primarily of ranged attacks and (de)buffs) and magic equipment (which usually provides poor stats to surviving melee) for it to be effective, while for vampirism to work leech life and add extra damage you need to make melee attacks - which effectively means that vampirism used to be a sure-fire way to gimp your build.

In recent versions, however, the life leech and added damage of vampirism has instead been tied to the Health Regen stat - something which was previously useless to vampires, since vampires can't regenerate health naturally - thus giving that stat a purpose for vampires as well. I was able to make a vampire build that had defensive skills that would passively boost my health regen to extreme values, as well as other nice defensive stats. Coupled with whatever health regen equipment I could come across, this made me leech life in combat faster than I could lose it. Here's an overview of the seven skill trees in my build, and for what reasons I picked them:

UTILITY SKILLS

* **[Vampirism](http://www.dredmorwiki.com/wiki/Vampirism)**: The defining skill tree of my build, giving me life leech, and the ability to eat my slain enemies for health. Ironically, only the first two skills were on any use to me, and thus the defining skill tree of my build, would be the last one to max.

* **[Burglary](http://www.dredmorwiki.com/wiki/Burglary)**: Lots of useful utility skills, including the ability to open locked doors without a lockpick (good source of free experience), lock down enemies, invisibility and teleportation.

OFFENSIVE SKILLS

* **[Swords](http://www.dredmorwiki.com/wiki/Swords_(Skill)**: Increasing my damage with swords, giving me a ranged sword-attack, giving me some nice procs, and probably most importantly substantially increasing my counter-attack chance (counter attacks will negate an enemy attack, and instead giving you a free attack, which basically makes it one of the most potent forms of defence).

* **[Dual Wielding](http://www.dredmorwiki.com/wiki/Dual_Wielding)**: Again, increasing my counter-attack chance heavily, and giving me some nice procs. Also, when using two swords, instead of just one, you'll get the stat bonuses from the Swords skill tree applied twice, which means even *more* counter-attack chance.

* **[Berserker Rage](http://www.dredmorwiki.com/wiki/Berserker_Rage)**: Somewhat of a filler, and mostly got it for the procs. As a skill tree that I didn't put point into until the very end, right before I'd max Vampirism, the first level skill (which is free) was quite nice.

DEFENSIVE SKILLS

* **[Shield Bearer](http://www.dredmorwiki.com/wiki/Shield_Bearer)**: Funnily enough, you don't need to use a shield to take advantage of this skill tree. I wasn't going to use shields, since I was dual wielding, and I'd vastly prefer a higher counter-attack chance than a higher block chance. The only reason I got it was for the two skills that can each boost my Health Regen by four - one of them a proc-buff, and the other an activated cooldown-buff.

* **[Master of Arms](http://www.dredmorwiki.com/wiki/Master_of_Arms)**: Same as Shield Bearer - a cooldown-buff adding +4 to health regen, and a proc-buff adding +10 to health regen. With all the health regen coming from Shield Bearer and Master of Arms, in addition to any Health Regen from my equipment, I'd be a vampiric powerhouse.

It didn't take long for my character to become nigh-unstoppable, ploughing through monsters with ease. I could even afford to let myself be engaged by several monsters at once, rather than kiting them to only face one at a time, due to my very high counter attack chance, and my ability to easily recoup any health lost, without the expense of any resources. There were only four real dangers for me, three to my life, and one to my equipment, but even those weren't that bad: ranged/caster monsters, since I'd have to close in on them, taking their shots as I'd advance; construct/undead monsters, since you can't leech life from them, though I could still eat their corpses; traps, since I couldn't leech life from them either - but luckily my trap skill was high, and most traps' damage is based off of your Magic Power, and mine was 0 for most of the game, and any other traps I could just avoid; and finally, corruption enemies, which can corrupt/curse your equipment - though I could deal with them by locking them in place with the Lockup skill from Burglary, and then using my ranged Swords skill to take them down, since they can only corrupt your equipment in melee. About half-way through the game, I was even able to craft just under a hundred Potions of Healing, since I had stocked up on the ingredients needed since the beginning of the game (rust and aqua vitae), and had been lucky enough to find a Potion of Alchemical Inspiration, which increases your alchemy skill for a short while. With those potions, I was able to face any enemies I couldn't leech life from, without any fear.

I was finally near the end of the game, and victory was in sight. I had just cleared floor 14, out of the 15 floors in the game. I needed one or two more levels before I could max out every skill tree in my build, so I decided to treck upwards again, to use any Lutefisk Statues I had left unused, and enter any Mysterious Portals I had found (Mysterious Portals transport you to a short level, where all the monsters are randomly pulled from various floors of the game, which make them ill advised to do early in the game, but mostly trivial by the end), as well as go to my Pocket Dimension to enter in a few Graffiti codes I had found, to enter some Wizardlands and get that last bit of experience to max out my build.

Everything went smoothly. I had achieved my max level, and thus had every skill in my build unlocked. There was nothing left for me in the game that could challenge me, except for probably the final boss, Lord Dredmor himself. I went back down to level 14. I was just about to go down into the final floor of the game, the only floor I had not yet seen in the game, when curiosity struck me: the last skill I had acquired was the last skill in the Vampirism skill tree - a skill tree I had never completed before, and thus I had never tried that last skill, Transylvation. I figured, why not just try it out - I had cleared the floor anyway, so there should be no real danger in it.

Now, what Transylvation does is that it polymorphs you into a Batty Form, looking identical to the various Bat enemies in the game, altering your stats (less attack and defense, but much higher sneak and evade), disallowing the use of your skills, and finally the ability to fly, and thus the ability to cross water or lava. It only lasts 20 turns, after which you polymorph back to your regular form.

I was flying around, squeeing with Batty joy, enjoying the freedom of my new form. I could fly over water - areas which had been blocked off by pools, inaccessible until I got teleportation somewhere mid-game, and which were loaded with artifacts and treasure, were now more accessible than ever! I was a happy as a bat can be!

Then I started to wonder. I wonder what would happen if I ceased being a bat, and returned to my human form, while hovering over a pool of water. I almost felt like I knew the answer to that, since I had previously tried teleporting onto tiles of water, with a random teleport skill from another skill not in this build, and there had been no consequence, besides being stuck until you teleported again. I felt confident that no harm would come to me, but I needed to sate my curiosity. After all, what could happen?

The timer of my polymorph ran up. I could see the transformation happening. Scaly wings withered away, to make way for [my bushy brows](http://i.imgur.com/6w0wdxy.jpg). But suddenly my heart sank. Not just my heart - my whole being sank, as a mournful music played.

[**Congratulations! You have died.**](http://i.imgur.com/KdaYhJw.jpg)

TL;DR: And thus, Nosferatu VI, the only adventurer to have come so far and so deep in Dredmor's dungeons, [had his death eternally recorded on his tombstone as dying ""by suddenly regaining his human form and drowning""](http://i.imgur.com/gda9Sfr.png). He will be remembered by all, revered by many, but be the joke of even more.

I can only hope that Nosferatu VII will bring a life vest!

Part 3 [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/gametales/comments/1jplf5/the_downward_spiral_gets_bigger_pt_3/). This one is gonna be mostly group 2.

So, Spetrovi (now referred to by his acquaintances as Comrade), throzgar, and Tabu enter Galley, having followed Franz's massive footprints to the edge of town. Galley is a marketplace, basically a large ring of buildings surrounding a central brick area containing three large pillars, which are used to display city messages.

The three look around, but franz is nowhere to be seen. ""ok, whell, let's try thees... EXCUSE ME, BUT HEZ ANYVODY SEEN A BEEG GUY RUNNING THROUGH HERE? LOOKED LIKE HE WAS ABOUT TO BREK SOMETHINK?!"". 

The exclamation catches the attention of a few random citizens. One saunters up to them. ""Why, a giant. Yes, yes, i think.... let me check my note book..."" He proceeds to pull out a notebook, and thumbs through the pages, relating to use that he did witness a giant, but he has no idea where he went. Spetrovi is annoyed, and walks away midsentence, with the others in tow. as he is walking away, he snaps his fingers and sets the man's book on fire, sending the man into a freaked panic about demons or something of that nature.

The group splits to inspect the three pillars, but all that can be found is a magic aura emanating from the center of the marketplace somewhere underground. The three head to the middle, and proceed to become stumped as to what to do. After a few minutes of bickering (""how do you lose a goblin, you drunk?"" ""whhatever, you manached to loose a pucking giant""), Tabu's mini-me notices something strange: nobody's moving. The adventures look around them to see that time has literally stopped in its tracks. Throzgar disdainfully acknowledges that this ""must be some more of that magic bullshit"", and Spetrovi decides to do an experiment.

 He uses mage hand to pull a piece of banner off of one of the towers. To his surprise, there is magic inscription underneath. Doing what he does best, spetrovi sets all the banners on fire, and reads the inscription aloud: ""speak friend, and enter"".

Immediately, the three of us start spamming shouts in every language we know, but of course i fail my history check, and spetrovi forgets the elvish word for friend. oops. After more failed attempts to make something happen, i leave my chair and sprint downstairs to ask Airde's player what the word is. I return upstairs and shout ""MELONS!"" at the DM. after some debating, i determine that he wants the word used in the movie, which was bellock or some such word. 

""Ballsack!, Bellsuck!, Bollocks!, Bellock!"" The letters on the towers glow, and we begin to sink into the ground.

We find ourselves in a cave system, each with a cave leading to one of the pillars. There are several sets of footprints heading down one of the caverns. After laughing at Throzgar, who is sinking into the soft dirt, making him the same height as the two halflings, we head off down the  cave to enter a concrete room.

At the far side sits a statue of a firebat, with glowing red eyes. Spetrovi first tries to enter, and barely reacts in time to dissipate a fireball sent forth from the statue. After some time wasting zig zagging towards the statue, tabu realizes that he has a floating disk, and flies up to it. 

""alright, mini-me, touch it...."" ""do i have to?"" ""Yes."" Fortunately for mini-me, nothing happens. Spetrovi is getting damned tired of dead ends, and shoots a magic missile at the statue from across the room. Sure enough, the missile takes a chunk out of the statue, and it quickly spews a massive ring of fire, engulfing the mini-me. Throzgar throws a mighty blow with his axe to crack it, and Spetrovi finishes it off with another magic missile. 

Unfortunately for Throzgar, the eyes are magic crystals, and they shatter on the floor, creating a massive firestorm all around him, setting him on fire and taking damage.

Spetrovi pulls out his potion of cure light wounds, and tries to toss it to throzgar. Unfortunately, throzgar is on fire and doesn't notice the sailing vial, which impacts his forehead and knocks him to the ground, setting the rest of him on fire. He scrambles to pick up the vial, and drinks it.

""YOU EEDIOT. YOU WERE SUPPOSET TO PUT YOURSELF OUT WITH EET."" Tabu realizes that he can do more than one thing with his disk, and places it over throzgar's head and begins spinning it rapidly, which pushes the fire into a tornado around throzgar, who is now being slowly cooked instead of burned.

spetrovi thinks for a second, and starts to say ""eef you just gif me a second, i can..."" But Throzgar and tabu have different plans. 

Tabu lowers the disk to just above the bloodied giant's head. They count down, and throzar makes an athletics check to jump and grab on to the edge of the disk, tabu slows it and makes a strength check to keep it going, and throzgar gets a 19 on an acrobatics roll, which actually results in an 18 since he's -1. Still, it's enough to allow him to slingshot out of the ring of fire, and land on his feet in safety.

""Oh, whatever"" says spetrovi, who proceeds to nat 20 a modified pretidigitation move, which sends a massive wind across the chamber and instantly extinguishes the flames. ""WHY YOU NO DO THIS EARLIER?!"" ""whel, you got impatient.""

They proceed through the now revealed entrance. There is a long hallway with two guards in front of a large door. Throzgar begins charging towards the guards, but it is a long ways. Before he can make our presence known, Tabu goes invisible and flies up to them. Spetrovi possess one, and makes him remove his helmet, and headbut the wooden door as hard as possible. 19 roll. The guard cracks the massive door and falls unconscious. his concerned partner turns to help, only to be mindthrusted into oblivion.

Not wanting to slow his roll, Throzgar smashes through the cracked door, revealing the entrance to the next room. The matron is on the far side, pleading in front of a massive, heavily armored figure. To the figure's right, four mercenaries are barely holding franz down, one with a blade to his throat. four more guards sit on either side of the entrance with bows.

It's at this point that Airde and Dusk make an entrance, claiming that they were in town and felt the magical pull, and followed the footprints and burn marks. Welcoming the assistance, they begin the encounter.

Airde immediately throws down a fog, concealing us for the time being. Tabu moves to the edge of the fog, and starts attacking the corner guards. They are taken by surprise and hurt heavily, but not dead. It's at this point that Throzgar emerges from the fog, makes eye contact with BBEG, and witnesses him bitch slapping the matron across the room. ""TIME TO DIE, MUHHFUCKAH"", and he charges towards him. Franz sees Throzgar, and starts yelling at him to leave. The guards try to hold him down, when suddenly a ball of magic comes sailing out of the fog and knocks the knife out of the guards hand, leaving a small cut on Franz's neck. 

Suddenly, spetrovi casts a spectral image of Franz onto the massive fog, and nails an intimidate check, terrifying the guards, who release him promptly. Dusk, Spetrovi and Tabu begin attacking guards, while Throzgar begins attacking BBEG full force. Throzgar is outpowered, and is taking damage pretty quickly. Spetrovi erects a fountain of flame, setting the right half of the room on fire. The opportunity allows Franz to break free of his chains, and he goes into beserk mode, whipping chains around and smashing guards one by one. The flames burn the rest of the guards on that side to a crisp, and alight franz's chains. He then directs his attentions towards helping Throzgar...

Who is totally getting his ass kicked. Several turns in, and he hasn't even bloodied BBEG, and is running less than 20 hp. He has however caught on fire thanks to the BBEG dragonborn's breath, and has disarmed the BBEG. Tabu and Dusk finish off all but two of the guards, and spetrovi uses his mage hand to drop a wall torch into the armor of one of the remaining two. Tabu uses his disk to fan the flames, and they engulf and kill the remaining guards.

Franz is repeatedly attacking BBEG, but due to his rage, is not doing any damage since he is punching armor. Throzgar gets knocked prone due to a failed roll. BBEG turns to him, ready to attack.

""oh good God. Crit 1."" BBEG winds up an uppercut, but franz's chain catches his arm, causing him to punch himself in the chin, sending his helmet flying. Throzgar take the opportunity to toss his old scythe to franz. rolls a 2. BBEG catches scythe, and it cycles to his turn. The DM lets out a ""GOD DAMNIT. 2."". BBEG swings at franz, but franz uses his chains to break the scythe in 2, using his new weapon against BBEG.

After spending every ability the party has, we manage to get him down to 2 hp, and franz promptly removes BBEG's head from his spine and in his rage turns to the party. Spetrovi grabes the matron, and books it for the door. As Franz turns to follow, Throzgar embraces him, and yells ""BRROOOOOO"". Franz hands him the head, and a magical table with the same inscription as the one found in the previous encounter with the goblins, as well as the same map pulled out of the captured goblin's pocket.

Franz falls out of rage, and begins crying. 

We all return to the city, and learn that Franz is a eunuch who was saved from slavery by the Matron. Everyone goes to recover. Spetrovi visits the dwarf, impresses him with well spoken dwarvish (although with a slight accent), and gets some badass commie-colored robes for 50 gold. 

Tabu gets a letter from Throzgar to go check on a client, who turns out to be the mage shop owner. The mage shop owner is enraged, having been stood up on his appointment with Throzgar while he was gone. Tabu leaves before he gets killed, and is now terrified that the several hundred year old mage is going to destroy everyone. In his panic, he notices bengal, sitting on a bench. He attempts to detain him, but ziggsal simply escapes and leaves. Tabu goes to meet spetrovi and tell him what's up.


so currently: Throzgar is tending to his matron, there is a missing magical goblin, bengal/ziggs is running around doing god knows what, and primordials are amassing forces for some reason, using stone tablets to communicate. To top it all off, a level 40 mage is now pissed off at the world, and Throzgar doesn't even know yet.",Tabletop,False,self,t5_2wqgc,False,table,raconteur,True,t3_1jpqlg,http://www.reddit.com/r/gametales/comments/1jpqlg/the_downward_spiral_goes_underground_pt_4/,

(using GURPS),26,7,3,http://www.reddit.com/r/gametales/comments/1i36yy/random_moments_from_our_old_rifts_adventures/,"For those unfamiliar with the Rifts world it is essentially a post-apocalyptic future world with random bits of scavenged advanced technology from the golden age. It is called Rifts because whatever it was that caused the apocalypse opened up Rifts to other dimensions and worlds. Some of these worlds brought magic, some aliens, some monsters. Essentially you have every genre mixed together. This made for some interesting characters...

For those unfamiliar with the GURPS system, you can essentially make any character you want. It is quite universal.

Our first attempt as this homebrew campaign lasted only 4 sessions heh. My buddy Jeff wanted to play a paladin/glitterboy mech warrior... So he basically took the wealth advantage and decided to buy a battle suit. Knowing Jeff to never play an OP character as actually being OP we all were perfectly fine with it despite the rest of us being quite weak in comparison. He essentially had a gauss rifle and a light sabre... Meanwhile my character was essentially a dog sized dragon who could turn into a human with the intelligence of a caveman. My other friend Ryan was a fire controller and Stephanie was a robot.

To give you insight into how powerful he was compared to the rest of us: most of us had DR10. He had DR70!

Well it was all good fun until we ran into the now infamous ""mind-control torso"" as we call him. Okay, so he technically had a head and one arm, but no other limbs lol. Anyway our GM expected this boss to be pretty easy... until he mind controlled our paladin/mech warrior. Oops. Not only did he fail all his saves and end up killing the entire party... but he failed his save to resist killing himself. At least he used his dying action to kill mind-control torso though. A hilarious campaign ended earlier lol.

Not having learned my lesson that in GURPS, fantasy creatures and abilities generally suck compared to futuristic laser rifles that abounded in this campaign I made my next character be a necromancer named Dralnu.

That ended up being quite fun for a while when I raised space marines from the dead to shoot laser rifles as my minions. Things were not destined to work out very well for Dralnu or most of the rest of the new Rifts party though.

One day the party was going through an old abandoned university campus when a Rift opened up throughout the region. Dinosaurs started streaming through. Dralnu unfortunately had his leg bitten off as we crossed a flooding road by a shark. Quite hilarious!

It only got worse though. A T-rex ran up to us and ate both our space marine and our elf ranger (who had cybernetic implants :P). The rest of us managed to kill the dino before the space marine died, and we cut her out. Alas the elf died from the stomach acid! Quite an epic end being eaten by a T-rex though hahah.

Dralnu's end eventually came as we encountered two people in rocket-launching mech-suits... Having only one leg Dralnu just had no ability to dodge those things and ended up being blown apart along with Jeff's second character, who happened to be a farmer from the middle ages. (He didn't want to be OP again and boy was he NOT hahah). 

The farmer was fortunately saved by our other teammate who was a vampire... by making him into a vampire as well.

Anyway I think I have gone on long enough. I'll continue the story of the vampire and the vampire farmer some other time. =P",Tabletop,False,self,t5_2wqgc,False,table,,True,t3_1i36yy,http://www.reddit.com/r/gametales/comments/1i36yy/random_moments_from_our_old_rifts_adventures/,

The dwarf, in particular, who has been enslaved for the last several hundred years, is ecstatic.  As they begin planning out where they're going to go and what they're going to do, however, they hear the baying of goblin dogs:  the pursuit is on.

After a short distance running, the dwarf (who is peg-legged, if you'll remember from the last section) says he can't keep up, and urges the party onwards, saying he'd rather die facing his captors than fleeing them.  It's a bittersweet moment for the half-orc cleric, who is losing the mentor he's had for a long time, but has only just met.  The party flees, and soon hears the sound of combat behind them as the dwarf roars his defiance.  He can't possibly win, but he can buy the party enough time to escape the whole of their pursuit.

Thus begins the chase scene, careening through the woods, following game trails, and avoiding ambushes by groups of goblins and hob-goblins who had fanned out ahead of the dogs.  The party is eventually run down by the dogs, but fights them and their goblin handlers, slaying them all while taking only light wounds.  

This has slowed them down enough that they eventually run in to the hobgoblin leading the hunt:  a taller-than-usual figure in masterwork half-plate very familiar to our half-orc cleric.  After watching his underlings go before him, the armored juggernaut swept in to battle wielding a greataxe.  Despite their wounds the party made short work of him - his overconfident taunts turned to pleas for mercy as they beat him mercilessly with fist, hammer, mace and spell.  Removing the helm from their defeated foe, he was unfortunately the individual the cleric feared he would be:  the son of the regional governor.  The pursuit was over, however, so the party stripped off his armor in hopes of having the half-orc (the only member of the party who could go in to a town without being captured on sight) sell it for provisions at some point in the near future.  After a short discussion, they decided to head further south, following the rivers to the coast with the eventual goal of making it to the southern continent and freedom.

They set off south, hunting for game with a short-bow salvaged from one of the slain hobgoblins.  A few days pass in this manner as they make their way through the wilderness and get to know one another.  Three days after their escape, however, they see a ship heading downstream.  The gnome and halfling recognize the hobgoblin at the prow of the ship as the governor of the town they escaped from, despite his visage being contorted with rage and grief.  They've made a mortal enemy who has abandoned his duties (hobgoblins are very militaristic) to seek them out and avenge the death of his son...

To be continued!

A fun gaming story

My group and I got off track during a session recently and got to reminiscing about some of our favorite adventures. One story came up a few times and I thought I’d share. The world is your standard high fantasy with elves and dwarves and magic and whatnot, but the system is a complete homebrew system we’ve been using for quite a while now. So if some of what I say doesn’t match what you’re used to, don’t worry it’s all good.

Late one night a massive storm washes out the main bridge over the River Rye cutting the group’s home village off from much needed trade traffic. The flooding was enough to change the flow of the river and prevent a bridge from being rebuilt on the site. So the team - a dwarf engineer, a human thief and a hunchbacked little wizard’s apprentice - are hired by the city fathers to journey up the river and find a place where a new bridge can be built and then get it ready for the builders who will be along in a few days. Because you know cutting folks’ purses, hacking them to bits and then using magic to set them on fire is fun and all but in this sleepy little village it’s not enough to pay the bills.

They finally find a spot that is located just downstream from the outflow of a dark and murky swamp. (Note: never try to draw a swamp on your battlemap when one of players assesses wetland quality for a living. You think rules lawyers are bad? You don’t even know.) After a couple of days of work they finish the job but by now its too late to journey back to the village so they decide to camp for one more night and head back in the morning. They’d been hearing strange noises from the swamp for the last few nights and had been posting watches like good little gamers. But this night they hear roaring, growling and what sounds like the cackling of an old crone getting nearer and nearer the edge of the swamp. They take up their arms and lo and behold a big, angry troll comes bursting out of the swamp. It’s half burned and before it decides to charge them it hides something in the bushes. This confuses the players a bit as they are used to my trolls charging first no matter what the situation...but everybody decides that all is right with the world when on its next action it charges the dwarf first. Needless to say they fought and defeated the troll and then braced for whatever the hell was cackling in the swamp to come rushing out next. When nothing happened they decided to go see what the troll had hidden - actually there was a discussion about whether or not anybody really wanted to know what a troll would hide, but I digress. And there in the bushes was the cutest little troll baby they had ever seen.

The thief and the hunchback were all in favor of killing the thing where it laid and getting the hell out of there middle of the night or no. But the dwarf - who’s player can’t be bothered with meta-human stereotypes, has never conformed to an alignment a day in her life and can generally be counted on to do the opposite of what the rest of the party wants - decided it was cute and couldn’t be left for whatever was laughing away in the dark. So the other team members - having seen our lovely dwarf delight at cutting off other people’s limbs - both agreed that “Wow, that is the cutest troll I’ve ever seen...now lets get the hell out of here.” As they’re running away they hear off in the distance that annoying cackle turn into a scream of rage with the words “Where is it? Where is the child?”

Jump forward several weeks to the sleepy little town of Millbury on the Rye where the party lives and things are not going so well for our dwarf and it’s new pet. The thing is growing like a weed and eating through more food than our character can afford. Pretty soon peoples’ pets start disappearing and something has raided a neighbor’s chicken coop. Chaining the troll up works for about a day until it realizes it’s strong enough to just pull the chain out of the wall and head out the window. People around town are starting to talk about seeing a monstrous creature prowling around at night and there’s talk about forcing the town leaders to hire someone to hunt the thing down. It has, however - and against all reason - decided the dwarf is it’s Mama despite being a full head taller.

Our other characters are actively avoiding the dwarf and its charge at this point and quietly wondering how high a village imposed reward for the capture of the “monster” will go before they decide to turn the dwarf in to the authorities. Around this time a pretty young woman shows up in town and starts making friends with the thief and the wizard. She tells them she is thinking about leaving to look for work in the next town over because of the “monster” rumors. “And wouldn’t that be the most dreadful thing after she’s just getting to know all of these nice people.” (Can you see where this is going? Because my players couldn’t.) The thief - intrigued - decides to tail our young woman around town for a while and notices her flirting with several of the other tough guys in town and decides she’s just a working girl and leaves her alone. The hunchback though is entranced by this new beauty who is actually nice enough to talk to His Hideousness. He hangs around her long enough to realize she’s actively trying to agitate the good townsfolk into violence against whatever it is thats been eating their dogs and scaring their kids. As he’s trying to decide what to do about this someone bursts into the scene and says he just saw the monster run into the place where “that dwarf” lives. Our heroic hunchback trots on over to the dwarf’s residence just minutes before the crowd gets there waving pitchforks and torches and demanding blood. And just in case you were wondering, our thief is at the back of the crowd helping light torches in the hopes that he’s going to get some free entertainment.

Inside the dwarf’s home they’re getting ready to try and have a reasonable discussion with a mob. This means throwing the troll out of a second story window (“Look at him he’s so cute how can I just throw him out the window?” “He’s a troll, he’ll regenerate.” “Right, help me pick him up.”), and then putting on every piece of armor and every weapon you can fit on something 4.5 feet tall and 3 feet wide. They head to the front door and the hunchback opens the door so the dwarf can lumber out impressively...and then immediately shuts and locks it and watches from a window. By this point the young lady has got the crowd worked up to a fervor and they’re not about to listen to reason. The dwarf is denying that anything is living there, the woman is shouting that they should knock the dwarf down and search the house, the hunchback is looking for the back door and the thief is sniggering from the back of the crowd. The only thing keeping the mob from surging into the house is the fact several people are going to lose kneecaps before they can get past the dwarf.

Just as things are about to get really nasty someone screams from the edge of the crowd “There it is!” From the characters point of view it looks like a straight line of people being knocked down by something moving fast and folks on either side running away from whatever is trampling mob members. It’s clear that whatever it is heading straight for the pretty lady and the crowd surges away leaving her standing by herself. Into the sudden circle bursts the troll child who knuckles up to the lady at speed and bites her in the kneecap. She bats the troll aside with the back of her hand but it’s too late. The bite causes her to drop her magical disguise and she is revealed for the Bog Hag that she really is. A big, strapping lad from the crowd rushes in and tries to take her down with a well placed blow, which she catches with one hand and then brings the poor guy to the ground with a punch almost too fast to see. She then cackles the cackle that the group heard coming from the swamp and says, “Give me the troll child for my evil potion or this whole town will suffer.”

At this point the thief decides this isn’t so funny and tries to sneak up for the back stab. But the Hag senses him and he gets our incapacitated local lad thrown at him for his troubles. The dwarf and it’s (yes, “it’s” I’ve never figured out what gender it really is) armor have finally gotten up to speed for a swipe at the hags midsection with it’s battleaxe. This isn’t the the most agile of dwarves and when she sidesteps it she’s able to put a knee into it’s chin and snatch it’s axe away. “Oh great,” says someone in the crowd, “now they’ve gone and armed the damn thing.” The hunchback isn’t doing much good because a lot of people from the crowd are pressed up against the door of the house he’s in trying to stay away from a hag with a battleaxe. At this point things aren’t looking good for our team - especially the dwarf who’s about to have his/her head split open with his/her own battleaxe. Suddenly a cry that sounds a bit like Sloth from the Goonies yelling Mama (or Dada - that gender is none of my business) echoes from the darkness and an enraged troll child rushes out, makes a leap that would shame Pete Townshend and lands fangs first on the hag’s head. The hag’s attention goes to the troll just long enough for our Dwarf to pull a knife and stab her in the foot, the thief to pull a throwing blade and land it between her shoulder blades and the hunchback to finally get out the front door and cast a spell that sets her rags on fire.

While these blows weren’t enough to bring her down on their own, it was enough to turn the tide in the battle and allow our characters to emerge victorious. After the Hag is dispatched there is still the problem of the mob hanging around who had just been after the Troll child. The party was sure they were going to have to fight their way out of town when someone in the crowd yells, “Hey, that troll just saved us from that hag!” And everyone starts cheering. The troll is found and given plenty of celebratory pats on the back and all the garbage he can eat and the crowd finally disperses with a whole new interesting tale to tell their children. Over the next few days it is generally agreed that having a tame troll around may not be bad for keeping the riff-raff out of town and could actually be something of a tourist draw. The expense of feeding and caring for it - of course - is left up to the dwarf.

And that’s the story of how an orphaned troll became the unwitting hero of the Village of Millbury on the Rye.

TL;DR - Heroes save troll baby from certain doom, troll turns into the village hero itself.

I clocked in nearly 200 hours playing this save, and it's probably the proudest I've ever been playing a Total War game (I do have a fun story from Rome Total War which I might share in the future). Allow me to begin.

The Union Jack unfurled atop the Governors mansion, the city of Nassau lying just below it. Out in the harbor a cluster of ships sat in wait, having just arrived with a fresh force from Port Royal. A small group of cavalry and cannon pieces. They wouldn't be coming ashore, however. Word had arrived from London; we were to put together a force and seize the city of Savannah from the mongrel Cherokee. They were a nuisance to our cousins in America, and it would allow for a secure foothold on the continent. Ruperts Land was all well and good, but it was too far North to be put to actual use.

Of course all of this was grand for the King back home, but this wasn't a simple task for the citizens of Jamaica and the Bahamas. Both were poor plantation settlements, only pumping out enough sugar and coffee to support the local economies. The roving pirate fleets didn't help matters either. The governors had decided to contribute a small force; a unit of dragoons, light artillery, and a couple of infantry units. The final pieces of the puzzle were being assembled in Nassau, the preparations nearly complete.

No one in the Empire doubted the eventual success of the campaign. We would land, establish a foothold, and take all of the savages land. North America would be ours, and we could move on to removing the French blight from the region. All noble goals, to be sure. It was the first move a grand campaign that would see us rise to knew heights. All were excited for the future.

With an officer now in command of the force they were ready to leave. The vessels set sail to the celebrations of the citizenry they left behind, all confident in the success of this mission. The journey was short, only a couple of days sail between the coast of Nassau and the coast of Georgia.

The fleet stopped just off shore, the men gearing up to storm the beaches and march to Savannah. The final pieces of the puzzle were falling into place. London had decided not to officially declare war on the savages as that would only legitimize their claims to sovereignty. Instead the invasion force would land in a surprise attack to civilize the region. All the men knew it would be a tale to tell their grandchildren. How they had conquered the brutes and paved the way for a British America. Glory was about to be theirs.

The time had arrived. The boats hit the shore, the landing party rushing to establish a perimeter. No one was waiting for them. The natives hadn't expected an attack. In fact, scouts had reported that Savannah was only lightly defended. Oh happy days! The campaign was getting off to a grand start. The force would take no chances though, setting out for the town at once. It was a short trip, and they immediately set siege to the beasts.

The commander, being an honorable chap, offered the natives amnesty. Surrender the city and you will be free to live. Of course they refused, blood lust clearly directing their actions. Peace would not be the word of the day, it seemed. The commander gave the order, ""We attack at first dawn.""

The cannons sounded the new day. Roaring with an explosive passion, they sent their shot into the heart of the enemy home. They cared little for any damaged infrastructure. The settlement would be razed anyway, in it's a place a civilized colony with a proper governors estate. Everything could burn. Everything would burn. The dragoons went to the left, circling around the enemies line and moving to charge their rear. The infantry marched forward, muskets at the ready. The signal was given, and the dragoons charged at the rear of the enemy. The infantry fired almost simultaneously, both frenzying the already haphazard lines of the local defenders. It was a short battle.

The Jack was raised over the new colony, and the force sat to heal it's wounded. Shortly the force was ready, and they set out to chase any would be Cherokee conquistadors from the territory. As they left the native facilities were set to the torch, with construction of a new governors mansion beginning in their stead. This would surely be the new capital of the British America.

The force encountered little initial resistance, presumably due to the clear fear the Cherokee had of the mighty Briton and his war machine. It was a fear they would surely come to know well. However, it wasn't long till this theory fell apart. The force had stumbled into a mighty Cherokee host. It was twice the size of the British group, and moving directly towards them.

The commander met their gaze, and charged headlong towards them. Numbers mattered naught, the British musket would make short work of them. Both groups smashed together, and the fighting was fierce. It was going well initially, the natives had been split down the middle by a patch of woods, allowing for the dragoons to handle half of them. Things began to fall a part. A group of Cherokee launched from the woods, unseen in the chaos of battle. They smashed into the left flank of the advancing infantry, halting their forward momentum. Distracted, they couldn't defend themselves from the frontal assault by the Cherokee lines either. The commander and infantry were surrounded, fighting for their lives. The Artillery men and dragoons could only sit and watch as their comrades fell to the horde.

The commander finally fell from his horse, a nameless Cherokee responsible for his untimely death. It was clear where this was headed. The dragoons and artillery men fled the field, racing head long back to Savannah. The fleet sat just off shore, they could go for help. Savannah would not fall!

But a group of cavalry and infantry came anyway. It was small, only a fraction the size of the host. A scouting party, perhaps. They decided to press the advantage, and attacked the exhausted remnants of the expeditionary force. 

Without numbers or infantry, there was only one option. The artillery men set their pieces up in the heart of the town. They would fire on the advancing host and hopefully buy time for the fleeing colonists. The dragoons would make a sweeping pass or two, but would eventually dismount and bunker down. It was the only strategy they had.

It went off without a hitch. As the enemy force entered the city, both units dismounted and ran for the nearest buildings. They fired out at the cavalry, and fought off the vicious charges of the infantry. Many times they tried to gain entry, but somehow the dragoons held tight. Time elapsed, and the last infantrymen fell to a dragoon musket ball. All that was left was the cavalry, and they couldn't get close enough to burn the buildings down without being shot. It was a stalemate. The clock ran down. The battle was ours. The battle would be taught for years to come in officer schools throughout the Empire, the Savannah Defense as it was known, would be the general strategy for dealing with overwhelming native odds. It was the only good thing from the campaign. 

With the success the small band of survivors fled the city. The fleet sat in wait, and carried them to safety. Savannah was attacked again, only a small group of colonists left to defend. They had refused to go, they would defend their homes. No news ever got back as to their fates. All that's known is they failed, and the Cherokees returned to Savannah.

The survivors called for revenge. They demanded retribution. The Empire was bored with America, however. It was Spain and Frances ballpark. Old news. Boring. No, the Empire had set it's sights on a new prize, and would learn from the mistakes made in the Cherokee campaign. They would go a totally different route in their next conquest. India would be ours.

This game was a precursor to Counter-Strike, and the gameplay was similar. Basically, two teams start out and shoot each other to the death. If you die, you have to wait for the round to end.

This was the good old days of GameSpy, 56k modems, and 200+ms ping times. I ran Quake 2 at some resolution like 320x240 on a 13 inch monitor on a 133mhz Compaq. I wasn't the most lethal player, but I had learned how to compensate for the latency and figure out where to aim to hit players.

We were playing a multiplayer map called ""cliff."" It was a small map, only 300k to download. Both teams started on their own cliff, and there was a small mountain in the middle, as well as a tram on one side. Strategy involved finding good cover and not allowing the enemy to flank you.

It was something like three on three, and not long after the round started, I found myself to be the last man standing on my team, with the enemies taking sniping positions on the opposite cliff. It was possible to avoid sight by going down into the valley around the mountain in the middle, so I snuck down, then climbed up on the opposite side of the mountain.

In AQ2, you not only had guns, but you could acquire throwing knives and even ""kick"" players by jumping next to them, which would do minimal damage and push them about 5 feet.  Having emerged from the valley, I spied an enemy on the top of the mountain. Apparently, they still thought that I was on the other side of the cliff, as he was looking through a sniper rifle with his back facing me. Sensing the opportunity for a stylistic kill, I quickly took him out with a throwing knife, but I had been spotted.

The second enemy jumped onto the mountain and we engaged in a messy circle-strafing fire-fight. I won, but just barely. It had been a matter of luck, and there was one more enemy to go. I could sense all the other dead players watching me. The pressure was on.

I jumped onto the enemy's cliff and looked around. The last enemy was crouched on the tram platform, looking through his sniper scope. In a moment of brilliance, I ran up behind him and kicked him off the edge.

The cheering in chat once the next round started was immense.

&gt;It was a cool day in the Riverlands. It was going to rain today. Arimethea could feel it in his joints as he slowly walked up the hill toward his lord's hall.

The Maester had received word from a young servant boy that Lord Nodt requested his presence immediately. He thought back on his many years of service under Seamus Nodt. Ever since he met the man, Arim could tell he was the ambitious sort, always reaching towards some new goal, never content on the status quo. 

So far, most, if not all, of the Lord’s plans had turned out in his favor. Even the lesser known ones, where the Lord had the Maester hire certain unsavory characters to carry out a variety of tasks. Luckily, Lord Nodt was a devout man. Arim was happy that he never had to dirty his hands aiding his master in assassinations. He had heard rumors back in the Citadel, of maesters getting caught up in every kind of troubles. In all his years, Arim never went looking for any unnecessary trouble, and it saw fit to never find him.

After a few more minutes of his slow ascent up the winding path that led up the hill, Maester Arimathea finally reached the main doors. As he was struggling to pull open the heavy, oaken doors, Arim was startled by a loud grunt from behind him and a large hand on his shoulder, ushering him to the side. He turned around to face a giant of a man, with bronze skin and ill-fitting clothes. 
“Ah, Kamir, you scared me. You know, for such a large beast, you surely are quiet,” the Maester said to the man. All he received in a reply was another grunt as Kamir opened the door for Arim. “Many thanks, Kamir. I see my lessons are teaching you a few manners, at least.”

The Maester walked into the spacious hall with Kamir tailing him. The oaf of a man was somewhat of a friend of the Maester. He randomly rode into town one day, on a horse with no saddle, half starved to death and suffering from dehydration. The townsfolk feared him due to his size, but the Maester offered him some food and drink and the horse rider has stuck around since. Arim was not sure whether he was dense or was simply a foreigner who did not speak the language. Nevertheless, it has been three years since the rider’s arrival, and the Maester had been giving him daily lessons in the ways of Westeros. He had little success, sadly. Kamir would frequently doze off during lessons, or simply walk away and wander off to the larder for a meal. Arim had taught the man a few words in the King’s Tongue, though, so, it was not all for naught.

Finally arriving at the Lord’s raised chair at the other end of the hall (though quite devout, the Lord surely did think of himself highly), Maester Arimathea bowed and spoke as loudly as his old lungs would permit him to, “My lord, you requested my presence and I have come.”


“Ah, yes. Good. A raven arrived this morning, a message from my liege lord, Hoster Tully. I would like you to read it,” the Lord said as he waved a servant over to give the letter to the frail Maester. 

Arim took the note from the servant and unrolled the parchment. Holding the letter close to his face and squinting his eyes, Maester Arim began reading aloud to himself.

“*Lord Nodt,*” Arim began, “*I have heard word of the tensions between your house and your neighbor House Tir, a banner lord of the Lannisters. As you can understand, the last thing anyone needs right now is a border war between two minor houses. As your liege lord, I command you to peacefully end any dispute between your two houses; otherwise, I will have to take action. I expect you to undertake this task post-haste,*” the Maester took a quick breath before adding, “signed by *‘Lord Paramount of the Riverlands, Hoster Tully’*.” Arim thought for a moment before rolling the parchment up, looking up towards his Lord, and saying, “Well, it seems your little border dispute has gotten some attention. Do you have a plan on how you’re going to handle this, my lord? Perhaps we should send a small delegation and inform Lord Tir that we have no claims on any of his land?”

“I assumed you would go for the safest option, Maester, but I was thinking of something a little different. As delegates of House Nodt, I wish to send you and my son.”


&gt;The wind was picking up on the coast, just enough to cool down after breaking a sweat sparring. Cillian Nodt breathed heavily; his teacher was not going easy on him today. 

“Come on, boy, in all my years, I’ve never seen such a poor excuse for a swordsman,” his sparring coach and his father’s sworn sword, Bedric Storm, shouted at him.

“In all of your years? Aren’t you only ten years my elder?” Cillian quipped back, “Besides, you know I am much more proficient with a spear. I like to engage my foes at a comfortable range. I even had that beautiful pike crafted out of that broken sword from the armory.”

“Ah, I was wondering where that went. You know that is Valaryian steel? You won’t find a better material for a weapon,” Bedric informed him.

“I knew I made the right choice, besides, it’s not like my father will miss it, right?”

“Aye, he’s never mentioned it since I’ve been in his service. But enough idle chatter, raise your sword!”

The two sparred for hours. Cillian was content with what he had learned today. He even considered picking up a proper sword sometime. As he walked back through town with Bedric, he nearly ran into a sprinting boy. Cillian immediately recognized him as one of his house’s servants.

“Oof! Sorry, m’lord! My apologies! I was sent to find you by your father. He wants to see you up in the hall,” the servant said.

“Did he say what about?” Cillian asked.

“Nope!” the boy exclaimed and then sped off, sprinting back the way he came. 

“Well, it looks like you have business with the lord up on the hill. I’m going to be in the tavern if you need me. All this swordplay has worked me up quite a thirst,” Bedric said with a chuckle as he parted ways.

Cillian took his time heading home, stopping by the market and browsing the small selection of weapons one of the merchants had. Nothing caught his eye in that stall, so instead he went to another and bought a peach. An hour later, after he had finished perusing the various wares that the merchants were selling, Cillian finally decided to climb the hill and head to his father’s hall. 
After entering the hall, he noticed his father wasn’t in his usual spot in his raised chair. Perhaps he was at his desk. He decided to try his chambers instead. With a curt knock, and no pause for a reply, Cillian opened the door to his father’s chambers to find that he guessed right. His father was sitting behind his desk, opposite of Maester Arim and his savage, Kamir. All three towards the door, noting his arrival.

“I see you finally saw fit to grace us with your presence, son,” Lord Nodt said snidely, “the Maester and I were just discussing the border dispute between us and House Tir.”
The Maester opened his mouth to speak, but the Lord spoke over him, “Lord Tully has asked us to put an end to any tensions between our two houses. So I have decided to send Maester Arim here and you.”
Cillian was taken aback for a moment before regaining his composure. “You realize I have absolutely no experience dealing with this kind of thing, right?”

“What better time to learn then now, m’boy?” Lord Nodt said with a laugh, “And don’t worry, the Maester will be there with you to help out if there’s any trouble.”

“I suppose, but surely there is someone better suited to the task. I mean, it is such a delicate matter after all.”

“You may be right, but I need you to be trained in the ways of diplomacy. I won’t be around forever and I can’t have you ruining the houses name because of a blunder on your part. Now go, gather your things, you set off immediately.”

“Immediately? But father-“

“Go, before I lose my patience with you, Seven help me.”

Cillian knew better than to argue with his stubborn father. He walked down the hall to his chambers and began gather what he would need for his travels, a few changes of clothes and some grooming supplies. He then walked over to the armory to retrieve his armor and his two favored weapons, a pike with a Valaryian steel tip, and a steel trident. “Better safe than sorry,” Cillian said to himself as he donned his armor.

An hour later, Cillian, Maester Arim, and Kamir, who decided to tag along, were all on horseback, riding southwest out of the city. Maester Arim had decided that they would travel directly to House Tir through the wetlands instead of taking the poor-excuse for a road that lead west out of town and far out of the way from their destination. After their first hour of travelling, Kamir spoke up with one of his favorite words, “Hungry.”

It was at that point the group realized that while they had packed their personal belongings, they had neglected to pack any food.

About 3 minutes passed before Chortle stood up, I could sense his emotions.  It seemed as if we were going to be in for a rough time.  After about five minutes of bickering between ourselves about how we would handle this situation, we decided that stealth and force were a good mixture here.  I would go in quietly and try to find Ortease; if I did not return in 5 minutes, Chortle and Killön would come in guns blazing.  I started off to the side door while Chortle and Killön got into position at the northwest corner; I swear they were laughing at me.

Once I got to the door, up the small flight of stairs, I found that it was secured by a simple keypad security system.  It was a very old and simple technology, easily cracked.  I peeled the cover of the keypad back, slowly as to not make a sound.  I pulled one of the wires inside and with a soft click I was in; no problem.  Slowly, I cracked the door open, pulling it out towards me.  I would have no luck this day; a large security guard, Dathomirian by the look of his horns, blocked my path forward. He had not noticed me, so thinking quickly I took a deep breath, pulled my antiox mask off, and tried to knock the guard out with the concentrated helium and Dorin gas.  Just before I could get the mask around the brute sneezed, jerking his head away.  

My mask grazed his cheek and he was well aware of me now.  Almost instantly he turned, swinging his massive fist at me.  With my quick reflexes I dodged his strike and put my mask back on.  I backed my way down the stairs and activated my energy shield.  It was about this time that I heard the first of several explosions from inside the warehouse; surely it hadn’t been five minutes…  All I could think to myself was to hope that there a safeguard on Ortease’s cargo.

I was nowhere near out of danger by this point.  The security guard had pulled a crude pistol on me as he advanced out onto the small platform outside the warehouse.  I raised my energy shield into position, but as I did it crackled and shorted out.  I heard a thunderous boom and jarring thump in my chest.  The guard had shot me and my body armor painfully compressed against my chest, possibly breaking my second and third ribs.  Then I heard a second and third explosion from inside the warehouse.  I started to panic, hoping that Chortle and Killön were faring better than me.

[Chortle later bragged to me, that the first two explosions were a hand cart and a toolbox, which he ignited using his “mighty” force powers.  When he heard the first gunshot he assumed the plan had fallen apart and I’d gotten myself killed.  So he took it upon himself to seek vengeance for me.  It’s sometimes unsettling how much he revels in destruction.  His reward for the destruction was a pair of human guards, armed with some form of shock probe, which they delighted in poking and prodding Chortle with.  He must have been in some mad Tuskan rage, because rather than absorbing the energy from the probes, he simply stood there and took the shocks, then returned fire with his own flavor of electricity.  His force lightning lifted one guard off his feet and slammed him against an inactive forklift.  The other guard was not as incapacitated…

Killön had to explain the remaining events to me, as it seems that Chortle overexerted himself with his lightning blast and proceeded to collapse to the ground.  Killön had entered the building from an overhead utility access as Chortle’s second explosion went off.  Not to be outdone, he let fly on of his mini-rockets into the depths of the warehouse and watched as several massive shelves collapsed.  When he heard Chortle’s crackling lightning attack, he turned and saw one of the guards still standing as Chortle fell.  He dropped the launcher and aimed his blaster, hitting the guard square between the shoulders.]   

Knowing only of the explosions, I was forced to react quickly.  I drew my blaster pistol and without thinking I shot the security guard in his left shoulder, just as he fired off another shot.  I could hear his projectile bounce off my now functional shield, and go whistling over my head.    Another shot from the guard rang out, hitting my shield square, breaking the energy bond at the cross section of the shield.  The projectile went through and made a quiet thud against my armor.  My trigger finger squeezed gently again in reaction; this time I hit the guard square in the chest.  As I watched him crumble to the floor, I took a few seconds to catch my breath and reclaim my thoughts.

I hurried into the warehouse to investigate the commotion.  Killön had now hopped onto one of the massive storage racks that filled the warehouse.  Several craters smoked in the warehouse floor, with bodies and tools strewn in every direction.  I couldn't see Chortle, so I began inspecting the smoldering corpses.  The first was a security guard, this one human, convulsing against a forklift.  This must have been the one on the bad end of Chortle's Lightning blast.  Several workbenches had been demolished, probably Chortle's work too, I can practically hear his maniacal laughter in my head.  None of the bodies are his, but they aren't Ortease either.

Suddenly, I heard Killön shouting, something about the fourth rack down, second shelf? It may have been less specific, maybe not even real words, but I made my way into the long rows of massive shelves.  Crates, upon crates, mostly 2 meters across, filled the racks.  Was Ortease really hiding among these crates?

As I approached the rear wall I thought I heard Chortle singing to himself, a distant, faint dirge about a boy and his slave mother.  Killön joined me in the aisle and jumped up to the second shelf, just over my head.  With a single, strong but graceful move he broke through a crate and pulled out Ortease, holding him by his neck.  He growled at Ortease, interrogating him about the whereabouts of the package.  With some hesitance I walked back through the carnage to find rope and plastic to bind Ortease together.  I found both, and followed the singing sound to find Chortle collapsed and exhausted, smoking a cigarette from underneath a dead guard with a blaster sear in his bag.   When I returned with the bindings and Chortle, I found Ortease lying in a heap, crying to himself.  Yes, I am definitely the superior smuggler.  Killön threw down a second crate from the shelf above where Ortease had been hiding.  I opened the crate and Chortle mused to himself, it was a computer, or rather some sort of secondary hard drive.  Is this really what the Imperials were so interested in reclaiming?  Chortle grumbled something about the ports, but I had stopped listening by now.

I wrapped up Ortease in rope and plastic and had Killön drag him to the front.  I grabbed the hard drive and Chortle sulked along behind.  As we made it to the front of the warehouse we heard distant sirens.  Killön threw Ortease into the cargo bay of the massive transport vehicle and I rushed to the driver’s compartment.  Feeling perhaps overconfident from my success with the keypad, I attempted to hotwire the vehicle.  As the engine roared to life, it proceeded to hack, sputter, and then vomit flames and black oil.  Something had gone wrong.  I shouted to the others and jumped from the vehicle as it slowly started to roll forward.  Killön jumped out with Ortease on his back and as we ran to the west side of the building where we had previously seen smaller vehicles.  Only a few remained and we chose what we assume was the fastest of the lot.  

Killön smashed two of the windows so we could climb in; Chortle smashed the others because that’s just what he does.  I climbed into the vehicle and attempted to hotwire it.  I failed, but at least this time the engine was not engulfed in flames.  Killön threw Ortease into the back of the vehicle and offered to help me get the car started, and when I agreed he thrust his massive dagger into the dash of the vehicle and shouted at me “START THE DAMN CAR”.  Some sort of air-bag device erupted from the severed dash and knocked Killön out of the car.  Chortle crawled into the backseat with the restrained Ortease and simply passed out.  He looked dead, shame that he wasn’t…

Finally the vehicle purred into life.  I slammed my foot on one of the pedals and the vehicle surged forward as Killön jumped in.  As we headed for the main road, four more vehicles, these with flashing lights, came barreling in.  The local police had finally arrived.  One came in too fast, and losing control crashed into the flaming transport vehicle.  The others swarmed around me as I attempted to escape.  Killön reached his long torso and arms out of the broken window and again drew his mini-launcher.  He fired at the police squad and blasted a crater in the ground flipping one of the vehicles on its side.  The others swerved out of the way and I had a lane out.  

I was extremely unimpressed by the speed of the vehicle we were in.  I shouldn’t have expected much since the taxi we arrived in was slower than a Hutt on sedatives.  The police were soon in pursuit again as we made it to a long highway.  After swerving several times, Killön had finally reloaded his launcher.  He fired out another shot and hit one of the police vehicles square, it exploded into the air and crashed down on the others.  Fearing reinforcements, I continued to drive at full speed to get to the Autumn and get off this planet.  As we sped across the highway I imagined myself handing the hard-drive over to the Imperial Navy and receiving a handsome sum of credits.

I slammed the vehicle to a stop.  I looked back at Ortease and the lifeless Chortle.  Ortease smiled at me through his bindings… I left the hard-drive in the burning transport vehicle…",Tabletop,False,self,t5_2wqgc,False,table,,True,t3_1fqq82,http://www.reddit.com/r/gametales/comments/1fqq82/besm_a_star_wars_tale_chapter_1_part_2/,

I'd heard there was an airfield to the northwest. Best case scenario: I find people, a settlement. Worst case scenario I'd probably at least find some supplies.
 
I'd been lucky enough to come across a barn with a hatchet, a shotgun and a couple handfulls of shells inside. My thanks to the paranoid farmer who was probably now one of the countless corpses wandering the countryside.
 
Up ahead on the hill opposite my side of the road, I spot what looks like a large warehouse. I decide to check it out, since in the past warehouses tended to be surefire spots to find ammo or supplies. Unfortunately, there are a handful of walkers between where I stood and the large rusted building.
 
No problem. I crouch low and move quickly, weaving between the seemingly unaware killers. As I'm about twenty feet from the entrance to the warehouse, I hear manic breathing and grunting behind me. I turn to see one of them running towards me full tilt.
 
I'm not sure how he spotted me, but my only choice is to let loose one of the barrels of my shotgun. The blast erupts as the zombie staggers in his gait, causing the buckshot to whiz over his shoulder. I curse and fire the other barrel. The spray of lead catches him square in the chest and he collapses.
 
But now I have another problem. Every zombie in a mile radius heard those shots, and will be crawling around here soon. I run into the warehouse to quickly grab any loot and get out as quickly as humanly possible. The inside of the warehouse is barren. No supplies, no crates, not even piles of trash.
 
I exit through the large double doors on the opposite side, but as soon as I step outside I see three walkers headed in my exact direction. I duck back inside and, looking around, spot a ladder up to a catwalk system running through the rafters. I climb up and lay low. From the catwalk I can see through holes in the rusted siding of the old building.
 
Outside there are dozens of walkers. All headed to the source of the gunshots. A few shuffle curiously into the warehouse, the rest mill around outside. crawling around the catwalks I find a fire escape out one of the side windows and I know I need to make a break for it.
 
I quickly survey my route; a few walkers here and there, but I can make it through. I slowly crawl down the stairs, but as soon as my boots hit the dirt I take off at a sprint. The coast still looks clear, but as I approach a group of houses, one of them makes a jump at me from behind some tall shrubs. I loose another shot, and he goes down. I look back, and a veritable horde of zombies is running towards me.
 
I spot an open door in one of the nearby houses: A large, two-story brick building which offers my best chance at shelter. I run inside, spot a staircase and run up. My heart sinks as I look up the stairs and see a sturdy locked door.
 
I turn around in time to see the first of my pursuers reach the bottom of the stairs. I let loose a shot and he collapses at the foot of the stairs. Another appears, and another. I fire shot after shot, panic and frustration erupting from me in a torrent of obscenities each time I need to reload.
 
Soon I spend my last shell and I toss my shotgun down the stairs. It lands on the mounting pile of corpses at the botom of the stairs. As yet more zombies clamor over their downed brethren, I pull my hatchet from my toolbelt. Swing after gruesome swing connects with a sickening splitting sound.
 
At this point the zombies are practically on top of me. I barely have room to swing my hatchet as their claws and swipes tear at my flesh. I feel a crack as one of their blows hits my leg hard. I shout in pain, but I do not stop swinging. As I chop one more zombie skull, He falls to reveal that the path is clear, save for the piles of bodies carpeting the narrow stairs.
 
I quickly bandage my gushing wounds and I stand to escape. I immediately collapse under the immense pain of a broken leg. I roll down the stairs, each breath a painful gasp. Hands shaking, I check my satchel for a bottle of painkillers and swallow the last of them. Crawling around the house, I find a handgun and a few magazines of ammunition; I'm not sure what good it will do in my condition.
 
Not knowing where I'm headed, I crawl out the front door and into the street. I make it only a few feet before a walker spots me. I fire a flurry of rounds from my pisol, only a few connect; an entire magazine spent to bring down a single walker. I reload, wishing I could use the gun on myself, but I know I can't do it. As the magazine slides in with a click, two more walkers run into the street from around a fence.
 
I rapidly squeeze the trigger as they run toards me, only one or two of the shots meet their intended targets before my vision fades and I pass out.

All in the 11-12th level at this time. 

We came upon this very misty valley, in the valley was this bright-green glowing object that we wanted to know what the hell it was. So we went to investigate it and found that the valley was full of these these rat-lizard like creatures that traveled in swarms. We quickly found out that one swarm of these things wasn't too bad, but they didn't just travel in one swarm, it was SWARMS OF SWARMS. Too many for us to handle.  

So our Arcane Hierophant and Sorcerer, don't have a lot of spells, and none that are any true AoE spells to effectively deal with these things. Our Sorcerer specialized in Magic missile (which I can't blame him for, by the time we got to high levels 17-18ish, his Magic missile was very nearly unstoppable) 

So, we had to go back to a town and come up with something. 

After much deliberation we came up with a plan which needed the following supplies: 

* 1,000 Gallons of oil
* 50 new, soft wooden 20 gallon barrels
* a Wand of shrink item, 50 charges
* Priests from the nearby temple

Our plan consisted of filling each barrel full of oil, and having the Sorcerer put a glyph of warding, that our fellow temple priests help make, on the inside of the lid.  This Glyph essentially would cause the barrel to blow up if one of the rat-lizards got near it. In conjunction with the glyph the Sorcerer used the wand of shrinking on the barrels, and had a command word for each barrel that would release the shrink spell and cause the barrels to grow to full size. And another command word to activate the Glyph of Warding.  

We after we get the barrels made and the plan was for the Ranger and Dervish to setup a defensive mine field of barrels because we couldn't fly and had to stay grounded. But the Hierophant and Sorcerer could, and would fly around dropping these shrunken barrels of oil, and watching as they expand and then explode. That as the plan at least.....

Time came for us to go use these, So while several members of the party took to the skies the the Ranger and the Dervish stayed on the ground to lure enemies into the Mine field.  What we didn't realize was that the command word to activate the barrels was tied to the Sorcerer..... and before we realized it, the battle had begun. 

Grenades dropping out of the sky opening up and just engulfing everything in fire. It was as if someone was conducting an orchestra using fire and charred lizards. 
On the ground though, the Ranger and the Dervish are running through the valley, placing more barrels, and then running back through the mine field leading these swarms through them, hoping that we can get out of the way by the time the sorcerer would say the command word to activate the barrels. (The Sorcerer often felt that party members were tools to be used and discarded as suited by his needs.... Just ask the paladin..... Oh wait, you can't, because he got him killed, but that's a different story.) 

Luckily we got out of the way, most of the time. There was an instance where the ranger got separated, from the party, swarms came to overpower and overtake him. He dropped a handful of barrels high tailed it out, and let the sorcerer activate the barrels. Walked away, but not without his fair share of bumps and bruises.

We all walked away from that, some of us just barely, others eager to find out what the glowing green thing was, on to discover it was an Elder Brain with an Iron Golem at his command.

We didn't have any other kids around who wanted to play D&amp;D, so it was usually solo adventures with some NPC's, though sometimes my brother would join in on the fun. Here are a few of the stranger tales of the quests that Dan put us through:

1. The Dead Dragon's Skull

My brother and I were both in on this one; our characters had just defeated a dragon, and the dragon's skull lay in the middle of the room. But neither my brother nor I could find an exit from the room, so we thought maybe the dragon's skull was some sort of key. We tried all sorts of things with the dragon's skull - knock on it, pray to it, cast spells at it - but nothing worked. Finally I suggested that we *mock* the dead dragon's skull. So, we mocked the dead dragon's skull. And then the spirit of the dead dragon came up and said, ""You dare mock my skull? Then you must die!"" And the dungeon came crumbling down and everyone died. Dan then told us that the exit to the room was under some stairs we'd overlooked earlier...

2. The Milky Way Bar Quest

So we were leaving this town, but blocking the exit was another dragon! This one, though, didn't want to fight - all it wanted was a Milky Way bar, and then it would let us pass! So, fine, simple enough, just go back into the town and buy one, right? Well, sure enough, nobody has a Milky Way bar in their shop - go figure! I describe what it's made of to a chef in the town, and he tries to make one... but KABOOM! Apparently making a Milky Way bar causes things to explode in this world? So we never get past that dragon, either...

3. The Chicken-in-the-box Quest

This time we're on a quest from a farmer to rescue his chickens from an evil wizard. We go through the wizard's castle fighting basilisks, and finding every so often a miniature chicken in a cardboard box. There's an NPC paladin named Valieuv (or maybe Valium) in the party, though, who has some sort of thing for these chicken-in-the-boxes, because every time we get one, Valiuev picks it up and twists its neck around with his fingers. Eventually we find all the chicken-in-the-boxes and return to the farmer. But the farmer says, ""Nope, sorry, those aren't my chickens!"" So what do his chickens look like? Apparently they're kind of lizardy looking... yeah, that's right, his ""chickens"" were actually the basilisks we'd been slaying all along! Fortunately all is not lost, as Valieuv offers to buy the chicken-in-the-boxes from the rest of the party for 1 silver apiece so he can continue in his twisted (pardon the pun) fetish...

4. The Whiny NPC

In yet another quest, this one involving dimensional portals and a bunch more stuff I can't remember, there was this one wimpy NPC who would frequently stop and whine, ""I'm tired! I'm hungry! I'm bleeeeeding!"" Even if he was not in fact bleeding...",Table,False,self,t5_2wqgc,False,table,ranconteur,True,t3_1b29op,http://www.reddit.com/r/gametales/comments/1b29op/dd_dan_the_insane_dm/,

As we're walking back to the town, we stumble upon a seemingly rich dwarf, who offers us to guard him for a night, because someone has been stealing things from his archaeology site. Sounds easy enough, let's do this.

We walk there, set up our stuff, and my half elf ranger with +12 to perception rolls is first on guard duty. Cool. I get a nice roll and hear something moving through some nearby brush. I roll to sneak behind some cover and it succeeds, so I'm now hidden and staring at these two.

Turns out they are two catfolk people, and they seem nice enough. I manage to do a good bluff roll and tell them I am also a thief and would like to work with them. Meanwhile, I've woken up our rogue and she's sneaking around them to surprise them.
We talk for a while, and one of these catfolk is ridiculously charismatic. Our female paladin and female wizard wake up and see them, we talk, they both fall in love with this handsome cat. He tells us this dwarf has stolen a family heirloom and they were trying to steal it back from him. Paladin of course immediately agrees and goes to the dwarfs tent, while the wizard tries to seduce the cat.

I'm just standing there like ""Hey wake him up, let's talk this over.""

Nope, not today.

The paladin sneaks into the tent and tries to steal this golden sword from the dwarf. Due to being clumsy as fuck, she fails the roll horribly and wakes him up.
Hey, no problem, we can still talk, right? NOPE. Paladin punches the guy in the face. Great roll, breaks the dwarfs nose.
The dwarf tries to run but get this, she chases after him and punches him again. He stops resisting, she ties him up and sits him down. The dwarf is naturally very very angry, and he insults the catfolk. Wizard gets angry because of that, slaps him, critical hit, he's unconscious.

[entry 1](http://www.reddit.com/r/gametales/comments/1fmybn/dungeons_and_dragons_4e_the_journal_of_broon_a/)

After a night at the local inn, resting up for our journey, we began our journey to the capital city of Salthirn, Dodaca to find Narith’s father.  We even got a new companion, a Dwarf by the name of Branimir.  A Paladin of the Raven Queen, of all creatures.  Of course, we had immediate trouble on the way.  

There was a girl on the way to Dodaca who said that bandits were on the road.  We said we’d watch out.  Well, my reflexes have been dimmed by civilization, because a dagger thrust hit my side.  Hurt quite a bit, more than I expected.  It was obvious this girl knew what she was doing.  In a blind rage, and rammed my spear through her, ripping her in two.

Alright, perhaps that was violent.  But she did bring it upon herself.  Still… 

I digress.  Before we knew it, the bandits the girl had mentioned attacked us, coming out of the trees.    I ended up wailing upon a particular bandit, and we managed to take out a good few.  There was something off about them, though.  They looked… soulless.  More like a shell of their former selves.  They had the armor of the border patrol on, which was odd, seeing as how we’re deep in the heart of Salthirn.  They were powerful warriors, eventually knocking our group clean out.
	
We awoke in the middle of the night, tied to a pole while the bandits were at a campfire, perhaps burning their comrades who had fallen.  Easy Torinn managed to spot our gear in one of the tents, but we had no way of getting to them.

Then a Deva appeared.  Rare creature, a Deva is.  He apparently was sent by Marx to accompany us, perhaps as an afterthought.  Of course, the bandits were charismatic, welcoming the Deva, surrounding him.  At that moment, however, Easy Torinn used his fire breath, destroying the ropes that bound us to the pole.  I swiftly grabbed both of our gear (I don’t trust Branimir – not yet) and prepared for battle.

The Deva invoked the name of a god named Sehanine, using various tricks and illusions to distract the bandits.  However, he misspoke (misinvoked?) his divine spell and the leader of the bandits disappeared from our sight.  
	
A rematch ensued, the Deva (who introduced himself as Zaharia) invoking the name of Sehanine, causing us to look like monsters to the bandits.  We beat upon all but the invisible one, when Zaharia realized he could stop his invoking prayer.  Just then, Branimir felt a magic tug, and Easy Torinn discovered the magical orb that was controlling the leader of the bandits, the only one who was left.  The Dragonborn destroyed it, and the bandit collapsed.

As always, this is a long story. Dwarf Fortress cannot be summed up in a few short sentences. A list of words used in this story that people who haven't played Dwarf Fortress before might not understand can be found at the bottom of the story.

This is a story about Urist Goldmine. Mighty defender of Horrortrial, Militia Commander, and sole survivor of a Forgotten Beast attack.

Malachite, 253. Urist Goldmine the Everlasting Squid was seized by inspiration. He dropped his barrel of Strawberry Wine, and sprinted deep downstairs to the Forge Floor. Horrortrial powered it's forges with magma, deep below the earth. He promptly pushed a toymaker out of his forge, and started gathering materials. 

Adamantine, cut sapphires, pine, roc bones, gold, leather, glass, silk. He worked feverishly on his design, forsaking food, drink, and sleep. But then the alarms sounded, and the booming voice of a guardsman shouted. ""Urr Goridash has come! A towering humanoid composed of Iron! Beware his deadly spit... AGH!"" a giant man of iron rose up from the first cavern, and started a march towards the fortress. The militia mobilized.

A simple challenge for these second generation Supersoldiers. They trained in danger rooms for years to prepare for situations like this. They met 5 floors below the main body of the fortress. The battle raged on... and on... and on... The dwarves held their own, not a single wound on the mighty defenders of Horrortrial. But one dropped dead. And another.

The Militia, for their fury and fervor of defending the fortress, had fought to starvation. None of their primitive weapons could harm the mighty Iron colossus. And so the fortress would have ended, if not for a sudden announcement from the forge floor.

""IT IS DONE! I DUB THIS BLADE SHOSEL DELER! THE FRAGRANCE OF STEEL!"" Urist had made Shosel Deler, an Adamantine Short Sword. It menaced with spikes of Roc Bones and was decorated with rings of Cut Sapphires. On it was inscribed an image of the founding of Horrortrial, many years ago.

Gathering up his new weapon, he ran upwards into the main body of the fortress. Seeing the last few of his comrades wither and die in front of him, he let loose a furious cry and charged straight into the beast, decapitating it in a single blow.

By his orders, the Dwarves began gathering up the armor of his fallen comrades, and he himself went straight to the kitchens. He was hungry.

And even now, upon his death, Shosel Deler is kept in his tomb. And always the militia commander carries the relic Crowdmeadow, a green glass vial, filled with Whip Wine, to ensure that such a tragedy never happens again.

Urist was the sole survivor of that attack, and in the following months, was named the first Champion of Horrortrial. His militia was soon replenished the first batch of Third Generation Super Soldiers. Horrifically tortured since a young age, the Third Generation Soldiers surpassed Urist in many ways, but still, he led them, for they needed a Dwarf with experience on the reins.

This story is, once again, true. Urist made his own Adamantine blade, which is now with him in a trap in his platinum encrusted tomb. He was the only survivor, and the militia was replaced with soldiers from the !!SCIENCE!! described in the linked post.

Terms used in this post that outsiders might not understand:

**Urist Goldmine**: 

A short sturdy creature fond of drink and industry. He has a broad body bearing impressive muscles and a great load of fat. His brass eyes are bulging. His very long beard is braided. His very long hair his arranged in double braids. He has a clear voice. His ears are short. His skin is dark brown.

He is unbelievably strong, basically unbreakable, indefatigable, and very agile, but he is slow to heal and quite susceptible to disease.

**Forgotten Beast**:

A creature randomly generated at the start of the game. This particular one spat frozen extract and was made of iron, hence why he was so hard to destroy.

**Malachite**:

An ore of Copper, and also a Dwarven Calendar Month.

**Horrortrial**:

A Fortress built with the sole purpose of creating the Ultimate Dwarven Supersoldier. The Third Generation Super Soldiers accomplished this, with great difficulty. Full story in the linked post.

**Adamantine**:

The ultimate metal. Lightweight, but when forged, extremely sharp. It doesn't weigh the wielder down as much as Iron or Steel, but is still much sharper, stronger, and better for penetrating armour. An Adamantine Battleaxe is widely regarded as the best weapon in the game.

**That bit where Urist went crazy and kicked a guy out of his forge**

That's called a Strange Mood. The dwarf gives up food, drink, and sleep. Refuses to leave a workshop (unless it's to gather materials) then makes a perfect quality item. In this particular one, Urist was having a Fey Mood. Not only did he create a perfect quality item, in the process, he also became a Legendary Weaponsmith, meaning he can continue to produce high quality weaponry for the fortress.",Video,False,self,t5_2wqgc,1366780091.0,video,author,True,t3_1czifr,http://www.reddit.com/r/gametales/comments/1czifr/dwarf_fortress_the_guardian_of_horrortrial/,
1365844561.0,19,self.gametales,1c9fr7,[Minecraft] Denizens Part one,25,6,2,http://www.reddit.com/r/gametales/comments/1c9fr7/minecraft_denizens_part_one/,"Two years ago, I finally bought Minecraft. My friend had introduced me, and I loved the concept. My first world was near perfect (at least to me) and I immediately set about building my small house. I dug into a small hill that overlooked a large bay with an island in the center. Later, when I was more experienced, I placed a bucket of lava atop the crest of this island to give the appearance of a small volcano. As time wore on, I dug a decent mine, greatly expanding my output of iron and other precious metals.


Growing bored with my small house, I went east. I found a large hill which I took to building another house not on, but into. The first of many strange events took place here. I had built a compass, one which I believed pointed toward my spawn. However, the compass pointed to a patch of grass which I DID NOT spawn on. it pointed to a place between my mountain home and another hill. This was strange, but I quickly dismissed the event.


Time passed, and I continued eastward, and built a final home, made entirely of dirt, three stories tall and 64 square blocks per floor. This outpost as I came to call it, was the richest source of goods from the earth that I had yet experienced. With the influx of iron and gold and redstone, I built a railway entirely from scratch. Reaching near 700 meters, it was and still is one of my proudest achievements in minecraft. The railway followed through two mountains and cleared a forest. It connected all three of my homes, and I was able to carve the whole thing from cobblestone tools, which were plenty.


I eventually grew bored with minecraft, and started meddling with mods. Now, there wasn't anything too extreme, but I played around with single player commands and a fireworks mod. Ironically, the use of mods only furthered my growing apathy, and I soon stopped playing. About a year ago, after about six months of not playing, I got back into it because I was aware of the coming release of the xbox edition. My friends were willing to join me on my first night playing the xbox edition.

I booted up my laptop, and copied the seed onto the xbox. My friends and I hopped on, and we had a blast. Around two in the morning, we were readily prepared to go exploring, and left our dirt mound (where I had originally built my house.) the same, familiar landscape unfolded before us, and I was hit with a wave of memory. Every little supply run, every thing that was mined, every little bit of it came flooding back in a warm, nostalgic pulse. 

We ventured further north than I had been previously, and came upon a sunken crater of an entrance to a cave. Snow coated the outside of the cave, and gave off an eerie look. Carefully, my friends and I lowered ourselves into this cave, and we used a water source block to ensure our route out. My friends and I slowly descend into the winding depths of one of the strangest cave formations I have encountered, and the cave splits into two levels, one that leads further down, snaking into the darkness, and a large spherical antechamber. My friends and I explore the antechamber, and I begin to pick away at the sides of the room. Within a couple of minutes, I break into another cave from my excavation. I immediately spot the torch that is not lit, but placed against the cavern wall, and try to ask my friends which one was responsible. None were. They were all behind me when I broke through, so the torch preceded our visit. I make the decision to back out of the cave, and we make for our waterfall. As we draw near, we notice that our waterfall, our way out, was missing. I again try to determine who might be responsible. None of my friends have a clue what could have done it. I saw the waterfall before we went further into the cave. Something blocked it off.

I had gotten good enough with it to take down enemies in 1 shot from 1.5 miles.  The max range on it was supposed to be .5 miles, and that's where the scale ended in the sights.

One day, I'm up on a hill and I see 4 enemies running in a line across a bridge.  Knowing the AI is dumb, I start picking them off.  First one goes down easy.  Second one, another one-shot-one-kill.  Third one is just as easy.  I'm on a roll!

I've got that last one in my sights and it suddenly lies down flat on the bridge.  I think, ""That's weird behavior for them"" just as I'm lining up my crosshairs for a headshot.  I'm just about to pull the trigger and I see:

""It's me!""

I pause...  Turns out, the 4th ""enemy"" was my teammate, sneaking up behind those 3 with a dagger.  His side of the story was great, too, watching the enemies drop in front of him, and belatedly realizing it was me shooting them from long range.",Video,False,self,t5_2wqgc,False,video,,True,t3_1b3qwl,http://www.reddit.com/r/gametales/comments/1b3qwl/delta_force/,

It should be noted that the guy whole plays Damon has a policy of always doubling down when there is a problem.

The group had arrived at the town of Bentonshire to wait for a siege upon the sole crossing of one of the huge rivers that dominate the continent. To start with, Damon gave a rousing sermon and drew a good sum of gold. Jamie tried to rob anyone he could while everyone was distracted, but failed. The good priest then gave the people staying in the tavern a round of drinks on the donations. A bit of merriment broke out, since fear that the siege will end in them all dying was kind of heavy on their minds and the sermon and booze help with such worries.

With everyone in a better mood, the party talks to a few of the merchants in town. The first merchant, a lumber trader named Alexises said he would pay the group if they found what stole a shipment of lumber he had coming up from the south (this is never going to be followed up on). The second, a wealth arms dealer named Aurum, probably a name he gave himself, with golden thread in his clothes, intimates a that he would pay to have some underhanded work done. Damon went out and secured horses so the group could go south and do the quest Alexises had given them. These horses are never used again.

That night, Aurum offers half the worth of goods in a rival arms merchants cart if the players destroy it, and they negotiate for Aurum to give them some nice merchandise off of his cart if they can take the armor seller out of the business in a lasting way. So the party manages to pull a rather well timed heist involving chatting up one of the guards and knocking the other out with magic. But rather than stealing the goods they load some other goods onto the leather merchants cart. Unfortunately, the leather merchant is convicted of stealing. This is unfortunate because the punishment for stealing is not to have all of your stuff taken as a fine or a prison sentence, but the the loss of the thief's right hand.

Damon tries to have the sentence commuted to service to the guards of the crossing and forfeiture of merchants goods. The knight offers this as an alternative to the merchant but the poor man is dumbfounded by being given the choice of being maimed or risking near certain death at the crossing. So off goes that hand.

At this point everyone is a bit peeved about the levels of dun goofed going around, since a man just lost his hand and the part has gained nothing out of it, so Damon tries to inspire the proletarian to rise up and seize the arms and armor they need to fight the Orcs from the merchants' carts. The knight counters that they are some of the best off people in the southlands due to the trade and that fighting the orcs would be a bad idea since none of the peasants really know how to handle weapons. This angers Damon who then challenges the good sir.

Sir Vibert agrees to meet the challenge in an hour, so the group sets to work trying to figure out how not have their bold friend die. Jaron worked out that his floating disc spell could be used as a floating shield if he coordinated it with Damon, while Jamie tried to get everyone in town to flee so the duel would be off by breaking the siege in favor of the Orcs. 

Jamie thinks over how to do this for a bit and then decides to go for the gate house and raise the portcullis, thus letting the Orcs attack the tiny for from both sides and win the day. He sneaks up on and slits the throat of the man guarding the crank, and then begins raising the crank. He only manages to raise the gate an eighth of the way before the guards begin to impede his progress and eventually falls to one of their number, but not before killing four of them and splitting their attention as they make ready for a traitors' attack from the rear.

In the center of Brentonshire, the duel gets underway. Damon comes prepared with a set of magic pebbles, able to hit better than his normal attacks and packing a wallop, but misses with the lot of them, while Sir Sulspice Vibert fights with in a suit of field plate with a shield and magical long sword. Damon makes the first hit, catching the knight in the gut with two of his pebbles, but it is not enough to down the man, and when the cold steel of Vibert's long sword catches him in the chest, the duel is decided. Enraged at the death of his friend, Jaron takes up his companion's long sword and attacks. This attack is extremely futile and is ended swiftly. With the would-be adventurers slain, the town meets its brutal end, as the defenders of the bridge are overrun and Bretonshire is razed.

The party awakens to an eternity of torment in the abyss, the chaotic evil plane of Planescape.

The only real flaw I find in it is that you have effectively 1-2 hours of tedious buildup punctuated by 5-10 minutes of raging hell.

Was hanging out at my FLGS and someone who had previously attended one of the LAN parties that I hold about once a month wanted to get a game in.
Game started out pretty normal, 10km x 10km map with a mix of ocean and land masses, just building up, gathering resources, etc.

The first combat ended up with him sending a swarm of T1 bombers to wipe out a secondary base and a bunch of my resource extractors.  He'd wiped them out and was encroaching on my main base before I got a T3 fighter in the air to wipe them out.  Took all of 10 seconds to gun them all down, then had the fighter land at my base and continued building.  

Altogether not much of a setback, so meh.  No sense in wasting resources trying to counter attack.

A couple of minutes later, a new swarm of bombers, torpedo bombers this time, taking out my sonar arrays in the middle of the ocean.  Send a few fighters after them, gun them all down, have several of my T3 bombers follow up to try to set him back a bit.

Turns out he has T3 Surface to Air Missile turrets, and all my aircraft go down in a blaze of glory, taking a few structures with them.  Clearly an aerial attack will not work.

Next half hour is calm and tedious, building up a few anti-air defenses, shield generators, reclaiming the destroyed resource extractors...  And most importantly, working on building up a naval fleet.

Three naval bases, nine engineering units, and constant micromanaging of resources as I constantly run out of material, energy, or both.

Finally the fleet is complete, and I start sailing them south.  Three battleships, the hammer of the fleet, arrive on station first, begin firing on his base.

One of his island resource extractors is the first to go, he's not paying too much attention to the impending doom.

Suddenly he starts freaking out as the main guns turn on the bulk of his base...  ""What was that!!!   What was that!!?""

I send a flight of spy planes over his base and I have a small group of T3 bombers seconds away, just waiting to get a visual on his commander so I can bomb it.

Finally realizes the trouble he's in as a trio of spy planes fly over his commander while the rest of his base crumbles around him.  Detonates the nuclear core on his commander, killing him and obliterating the remains of his base, my spy planes, and the inbound bombers in a bright blaze of fire as a mushroom cloud rises over his base.

1366358448.0,18,self.gametales,1co2nx,(Starwars Empire At War) My butt was sore from the beating,20,2,3,http://www.reddit.com/r/gametales/comments/1co2nx/starwars_empire_at_war_my_butt_was_sore_from_the/,"For those who don't know, Starwars EAW is an RTS style game that spans the entire Starwars galaxy. (While not EVERY single planet is represented, many classic and well known ones are)
I decide I'm just going to go right into a game because I was feeling spunky this one fine day. So I select from the list the option to have the WHOLE GALAXY (which is only 55 planets :P) to play in.
This is the galactic domination mode. As you've probably surmised, goal=take over galaxy. Easy. Right? 

That's what I said too. So I set the difficulty on the AI to hard. Little did I know the ride I was in for....

I get into the game after its done loading (I'm playing rebel alliance because I can feel the goodness flowing in me) and I begin to perform my normal strategy of shoring up defenses. I simply take all the space and planetary defenses, on my inner planets and move them to the outside of the zone I control. (You might be asking why leave a planet entirely defenseless? Well for starters, there are base structures you can build to construct units on the ground and defend during invasions, because they have garrisons. You also have space stations to build space units.) I take on planet and I build all my important structures on it, (i.e. command outpost type structure, vehicle and infantry structures, etc, all the military stuff) and I construct mining plants on all the other planets. The planets on my outer edge I construct, minor defensive ground structures. I'm not expecting anything this soon. Now, I'm all set. Moneys coming in, building new units, researching, life is good.

5 minutes in. My eyes are suddenly assaulted by the games warning mechanic:flashing red lights and a huge message saying ""HEY IDIOT SOMEHTINGS HAPPENING"",. I quickly find out where the attack is happening. Bothawui. Planet of the furry bothan people. Im like, okay, silly AI thinking he's cool. So into in. I forgot to check on how big the fleet was.

12 accalmators. They're light cruisers, basic starting units. But they have torpedo and missile launchers that ignore shields and do straight hull damage. That makes them a bitch against units that can't outright destroy them. Me? I have 2 nebulon cruisers. Same level as the enemies. Considerably less firepower. They're shit pretty much. Useful only for hit and run, and distractions. And on top of that? A level one space station. And zero fighter cover, save for the two squadrons I get as garrison. Now, the larger ships, such as my cruisers and space stations, have hard points. Meaning that you can target a specific part on these ships. Engines, shield generators, weapon systems.

Here's another nice little tidbit about these accalmators. These are imperial ships. And what is the imperial navy known for? TIE fighters. And guess what? These assholes can drop a squad of these bad boys when it warps in from its hanger bay (one of its hardpoints). AND a squad of TIE bombers. The bombers in this game fire torpedoes, meaning they rip apart capitol ships like my cruisers and my space station.

So recap. What's going on? I've got two squadrons of fighters, on x-wings and on y-wings (fighters and bombers respectively), and two light cruisers. The empire has brought in twelve cruisers. With one squad of fighters AND bombers. For each one. 

I decide to hell with it ill take these bastards on. I see a cloud of the TIE fighters swarm towards me. Not too tough to fight. I lose both squadrons, no big deal they'll re spawn. Cruisers take no damage. The imperial cruisers then start to join the fight. That's when things start to go bad. Remember those torpedoes? They rip my cruisers 17 new ones. They're gone, in less than 30 seconds. 

But wait. Where are the bombers? 
They swooped in from the left. My station could only bend over and accept its fate. It's gone. Dead. Destroyed.
End of battle screen pops up. Shows me what I lost. All units lost, obviously. Time?
2:13's. 
guess what. They didn't lose a damned thing. So now I've got an enemy fleet breathing heavily down my neck because they can strike my core worlds which are COMPLETELY unprotected. I can't build units in time, no. I just shot up everything around that blasted imperial fleet. Then, the ground campaign begins.

Another mechanic of this game is that some planets have native populations. They will fight for or against you, with or against you enemy as well. The bothans were on my side. But they're shitty ground units. Good for recon and swarming. Well, the empire apparently can sniff a bothan out because what happens first? They are all killed and they're spawn structures destroyed. All I have left is what you ask? 3 squads of reg infantry. They have AT-ST's (basically mechs) and TIE crawlers (think TIE fighter with tank treads) and loads of reg infantry. Tie crawlers demolish infantry. Utterly demolish. They can crush them with their treads and mow them down with 3 laser cannons. And they did just that. Battle lost. 1:46's. shit.

It was at this point I started regretting picking hard difficulty...
To make this story short. And save my fingers the typing:
I got down to my last planet. It hasn't even been 15 minutes. The AI was spanking me like i was in fifty shades of grey. By this time they'd researched better ships. And they had more money. And they had time. So much time. The fleet they built just for my incy wincy little planet: 17 acclamators, and 6 of their new cruisers, which were harder hitting and sturdier. The new cruisers launched 2 squads of reg TIE's instead of one. Now, they could only bring it a total of 20 points worth of units, and these cruisers are worth 3 each. So, all the heavy cruisers get sent in, plus a light cruiser or two. 
I've still got my shitty light cruisers. At that point I just said to myself ""do I really wanna humiliate myself anymore?"" So...I gave up. I had the computer decide my fate. Auto battle. 

I lost everything. They lost, one light cruiser. One.
The ground battle wasn't even a question. The game was over at that point. I turned of empire at war and sat reflecting. The only thing I could think of was ""what the fuck was I thinking.""

The match lasted for no more than 20. Never played hard mode again to this day.

So I was playing in a Gamma World campaign that was very similar to Fallout 3 in world and setting. I played as a half cat/half human hybrid mutant race and I was the party's face/charisma monkey. I could pretty much convince anyone of anything and was about as lucky as Jar-Jar Binks in episode I.

So we get to, for all intents and purposes, Rivet City. Except this was on the west coast and it was surrounded in sand. We managed an audience with the City's Leader, Lisa, and she had us go out to some memorial to stop some drug trading that was going on. We talk to Lisa's daughter, Lydia, for other reasons I don't quite remember but Lydia wanted to overthrow her bitch mother and take over the city so we decided to side with her. On the way out of the city we noticed this guy jump down this hole on the deck of the ship, I'm pretty sure at this point we suspect this guy of being the drug lord's informant. We went over to investigate and I was the only one small enough or agile enough to get in. I contemplated going down after him but I decided to do so later because my character was kind of a coward.

So we went out to this drug dealer's HQ and got in. When we walked in we noticed he had this huge robot power his place. They had hooked him up to the main lines using it's reactor for their power. We moved on and I started negotiating with him. I tried getting him to let me sell his drugs for him so he wouldn't have to sell to rivet city because after all I was an adventurer and could make him way more money than he could just selling to people in Rivet City. I tried selling him this ridiculous deal where I would give him 100% profit and all his cronies were looking at him like, ""Are you serious? Why are you even thinking about this. It's so obviously a scam!"" but he sat there and thought about it for a good while. During his thinking and me ushering him to make a deal with me we hear this loud explosion come from the hall. We heard the guards screaming in terror. Before long this robot had smashed down the door to this guy's office and was flooding the room with its headlights. Out of character it was our friend joining in the game. So we ended up killing everyone there except for the chemists to make a long story short, also I executed a few of those people.

We got back to rivet city and Lydia had started her takeover of the city and there was all kinds of fire being exchanged from both sides on the main deck where the market area had used to be. I went down the hole we saw that guy, who we think was one of the Drug Lord's contacts, go down into. I got down there and snooped around looking for a way to do some guerilla warfare on the main deck. It turned out that's where all the drugs were be sold and distributed from. I found some really nice blue biker meth down there. 3 huge chunks of it. I think I also found that guy down there and killed him, I don't quite remember though. I killed a lot of people in that game.

Fast forward the story a couple months, we ended up finding a city of Rakshasa. We had dinner with the queen and a bunch of other people. At the end of dinner we were left in the room with 10 other rakshasa and were informed that we would be participating in a competition for the queen's favor. It was like a marathon race thing but much more cut-throat and deadly. I had been building my character as a tough hero who can eat anything and is uber survivable and being as scurrilous as I was I decided to take it a step further. Since these rakshasa were all warriors and had large egos I convinced them that if they smoked this blue meth, which I had been holding onto for months in game time and real time waiting for a good use for it, that it would test their true strength and that if the succeeded in smoking it it would make the overall a better warrior. So they all smoked it, including me because of course it would look suspicious if I was the only one not smoking. I had an ace up my sleeve though. I was able to feign smoking it and not receive any of the negative effects of actually doing so. After they all smoked it and it was morning again we found that at least one of them had a seizure in the night and died and all the others were sick except for one dude. So during breakfast I snuck some blue meth powder under his food so he would eat it, and he did.

That's pretty much where the campaign came to a close and we picked up something else unfortunately but it ended with me knowing I had really fucked up a lot of people and I was happy about that.",Tabletop,False,self,t5_2wqgc,False,table,,True,t3_1ckh63,http://www.reddit.com/r/gametales/comments/1ckh63/the_short_version_of_how_i_poisoned_a_bunch_of/,

(My old character died and I was looking to get into the party) So the DM decides that to get me into the group he would have a baby dragon and a rider attack a nearby village. The party shows up to fight the dragon as I am coming up from behind it as I was already in the town passing through. I was playing as a Chaotic Neutral nomad character. So I am constantly passing up on my turn as I want to see how this battle turns out. I dont know these people and I dont want to risk my life for them unless it looks like they will win. So eventually the group knocks the rider off the dragon and gets them separated. While they are all focused on the dragon, I figure its my time to step in and fight. I launch a quick acid orb on the bad guy and melt him into oblivion with a crit. I quickly transform into him and then move into the line of sight of the dragon in an attempt to calm him. Thats when shit breaks loose... I cannot talk. My character is mute. The dragon calms down for a moment, that is until I fucked up my bluff roll to control the dragon and take him as my own. The dragon quickly realizes that I am not its master. Aaaaaand on top of that seeing as none of the other characters noticed that I killed and took the spot of the rider, they also started attacking me. Eventually we kill the dragon with a cannon to the chest, and I am laying on the ground being bitten by the ranger's dog. Not my best plan, but hey it was worth it to try and tame a dragon as my own.

A few days later, the group gets to a very small village. (i.e. Just a tavern and a few houses) So we go to the tavern to spend the night. Me being the cheap changeling sorcerer that I am, decides to get the cheapest drink in the bar. So the bartender pulls out this bottle with a clear liquid called ""Sky Diamond"" He offers to give a shot to me for free. Me being so cheap cannot argue with that. I take a shot of it. DM has me roll a d4 to determine the effect of the drink. The higher the roll the stronger the effect. So I roll a 4.... In case you havnet gotten the joke yet, Sky Diamond is my DM's world equivalent to, LSD. So here I am, A shot of LSD in me and I will be feeling the full effects of it VERY soon.
So this is the part where I go outside to pitch my tent, being the cheap nomad that I am. By the time I get outside and find a decent place to pitch my tent, I am feeling the full effects of the LSD. So I find what I think to be a decent spot to pitch my tent. I place my things down and my tent rolls off a ways by accident. So I go to pick it up. I start to hammer in the first peg in order to pitch the tent when I hear a loud yelp. I stand up and look behind me. Nothing there. I hear a whimpering coming from behind me so I turn back. And there sitting in the spot where I was trying to hammer in the steak is a coyote with a broken leg where the hammer smashed in its leg. So there I am face to face with a very pissed off coyote. I take out my dagger and go to attack it. I stumble along the way and drop my dagger. So I say fuck it and just cast acid orb right at the coyote. It is quickly enveloped in the orb and is melted and I pass out right after. The next thing I know I am waking up face down in a pool of blood guts and acid. I get up pack up my things, Not caring about the scars left by the acid pool as I transform them away as if they where never there and meet up with my party back at the tavern. Though I forgot to pick up my dagger so that happened, but I got a nice staff/scythe combo in the next town. Oh, and my party made a rule that I am not allowed to have sky diamond anymore.

**[Part 2](http://www.reddit.com/r/gametales/comments/1fopar/dd_4e_the_turning_of_the_rat_shifter_the_assault/)**

**The Day of Rest... Sort Of:**

After the last couple of adventurous days. The party is feeling pretty exhausted and pretty broke. The group take to the Blaise Inn and Tau negotiates a show that night with Selmic and our group. The inn keeper is pretty dismissive, assuming we're crap but offers us a cut of the profits, if any.

We take to the markets to garner some interest from the people of Westgate. Tau, Selmic and Lia find a rooftop in the markets that looks like it could be a fairly decent stage. They talk to the merchant and tell him it'll be some free publicity. He accepts and the group gets ready.

Nohrai, runs through the markets slamming his axes together to gain the attention of the crowd and points out the group on the rooftop. Everyone is beginning to look up. The group opens with Selmic jumping up on Tau's shoulders and flaring out his cape. Selmic and Tau begin singing Bohemian Rhapsody accompanied by Tau's lute while Lia dances on the roof top. 

The crowd enjoyed the performance and were told to come to the show at the Blaise inn that night.

**General Questing:**

After taking care of that the group tends to go their own ways. Taking care of some personal agendas. Lia's looking to join an Assassins guild, Tau requires a doctor for his sick wife and Nohrai is looking to develop his forge skills.

We gather some leads during the rest of our day for our needs and prepare for the show and head over to the Inn.

**Time to Rock:**

The inn is surrounded by a fairly decent crowd. Our group heads in and gets lubricated with some free drinks from the bar and begins to set up for the performance.

Nohrai gives the group some ""Inspiring Words"" and tell Tau that we're going to rock out tonight. Tau is confused by this. Nohrai tells Tau that when he's playing music just think of rocks.

There's no real stage in the room so Nohrai has an idea. He shouts out to the crowd to stand back with little success. Nohrai slams his axes together and tell everyone to ""Back the fuck up!"". This time people listen.

Nohrai turns around and slams his axe blade into the ground using ""Stone Panopoly"" and a jagged stone stage bursts forth from the ground. The audience goes wild.

Tau and Selmic enter as they did on the rooftop and begin singing Bohemian Rhapsody again. The crowds loving it. They play a few other songs. Nohrai says to Tau ""I think it's time"".

Tau takes a moment to think. The crowd goes silent. The imagery of the rock comes to him and he begins stomping and clapping. Boom-Boom-Chick, Boom-Boom-Chick. Nohrai uses his ""Earthforger’s Might"" to break off two stone pillars from the stage and joins in slamming the stone pillars into the stage, Boom-Boom-Chick.

The earth begins to shake in a two block radius and the whole crowd joins in.

Tau begins:

*""Buddy you're a boy make a big noise; Playin' in the street gonna be a big man some day; You got mud on yo' face; You big disgrace; Kickin' your can all over the place""*

The crowd is going nuts. Drinks are going every, tables are getting flipped. People are pushing in just to see. (Meanwhile, Lia is slipping through the shadows and robbing the crowd blind).

Then the chorus begins:

**'*'We will, we will, Rock You!'*'**

The sound of the show is ring out across the entire city.

Tau picks up Selmic and throws him to Nohrai. Nohrai holds him up and Selmic opens his cape. A mosh pit forms in front of the stage and Nohrai launches Selmic into the crowd. People are flooding Selmic’s mask with booze.

The show ends and everyone is fairly trashed. The bar has basically run dry and there's unconscious bodies everywhere.

Nohrai has the last cask of ale and is drinking from the tap. The inn-keep began closing up and having people escorted out. Nohrai took the opportunity to heave one of his fans out of the door and then passed out.

Lia and Tau helped to escort some people out. In his last glimpse of consciousness the two tried helping Nohrai upstairs but his body collapsed in the middle of the staircase. They left him there until the next morning.

**The Hangover:**

The inn keeper was astounded by how many people had shown up and how wild the concert was. The show raked in 600gp profit even with all the repairs needed. Tau talked out a fairly respectable cut in exchange for a couple of repeat performances. 

Nohrai was passed out and didn't wake up till late in the day while Tau and Lia were stuck cleaning up but got a free hot breakfast.

Nohrai stumbled downstairs later and finished off the cold breakfast.

This wasn't my first time in New Reno, but it still got to me how big this place is. Big and foul, like a rotting Brahmin corpse out in the wasteland sun.    
   At this point, I was not to be trifled with. A tower of metal and pain I was in my Advanced Power Armor, Mark II. Gauss pistol and rifle ready for anything, I began to stroll down main street to sell off some of the junk I had collected in my travels across the wastes. Then two events happened that made me realize how rough this place really is.    
   ""Things could get really ugly if..."" was all I needed to hear. I'd had enough of people thinking they could push me around. My whole village was wiped off of the map! Everyone I knew and loved is dead now, and you want to mess with me?    
   Something you should know about Gauss weaponry: It goes through armor like a Deatclaws teeth, and he wasn't wearing armor. Now, mainstreet New Reno is a crowded place, and after my would be... god, I can't even remember anymore what he was. A mugger? A drug dealer? He didn't have a chance... Where was I? Right. After... he... was dead, everyone (rightly) dispersed, save one person.    
   I heard a sound I had heard all around me in Redding. Out of the corner of my eye, I see a lady crouched behind an old dirty trashcan, clutching an inhaler with a red phial attached, her eyes red and teary. She wasn't even concerned about the firefight that had just happened not 20 feet from her. All she cared about was her Jet.    
   ""God,"" I thought ""the Chineese should have hit this place directly."" It's warfare, weather it comes wrapped in a false flag of dead America, a new one with a Two headed Bear, or a Thompson Machine Gun and a Pin-striped suit. Full on combat, or just a war against hunger and addiction.

(Its on Kongregate as far as I know.) And the multiplayer is surprisingly great, with great maps and the shooting is smooth, unfortunately maps have some hollow objects that players can glitch into.

This player was taking full advantage of it, by camping INSIDE a pillar and shooting as he pleased, it basically functioned as a 360 degree shield for him. Well I had enough of this and was just about to leave when I had a brainstorm, grenades! They have an explosion radius that can go through walls, I quickly chatted the secret to his downfall while I stocked up on grenades.

Sure enough, my plan was working, but it was a suicide mission and I got shot before I could even throw a grenade at him most of the time, but I kept coming and he was also targeted by a fellow team mate if mine who somehow had a knack for spotting the weakness in the pillar and shooting through it, at him. With both our strategies we quickly took him down, only for him to come a second time and start camping again. This time we meant business and we quickly took him down in seconds, then me and my teammate used his own spot against him so we waited until he came back to his spot, not knowing we were there and we shot him to kingdom come every time till he left the server in what I can only assume was a fit of 12 year old rage.

After that, my work was done. I left the server and thanked my teammate for his help before leaving him to do battle with the enemy. I've never been more content with a game's outcome since then, and I hope I see my mysterious teammate again, as part of the enemy, or on my side? Who knows?

The evening wind carried the stench of decay and smoke through the evening air as Nico and I watched over the ruined husk of Chernogorsk. Before the outbreak, Nico and I were mechanics, traveling all over Chernarus with our toolkits, and now we sat on the outskirts of this once great city while the dead shambled through the streets. Nico and I are not well armed; if anything, our method of defense is laughable. Nico has a pistol so old it may or may not have killed Nazis, and I have a rusty rifle. Nico nods to me, and as the sun sets, we quietly slink into the remains of Chernogorsk.

A small man crouches in the middle of the street, studying the stones scattered all over the road. As Nico and I get closer, he raises his head and sniffs the air. What little light remains scatters across his decaying, blackened face. Nico gets low, and signals for me to do the same. The man slowly goes back to studying the small rocks in the road, and hops away. Nico and I slowly make our way across the street to a dimly lit church. As Nico walks in, he raises his pistol at a body that is at the lectern in the front of the church. The initial scene is eerie, as the man is bent over the lectern, clutching a dim glowstick, and blood from several bullet wounds in the man's chest have dried in vertical streaks on the lectern.

As we draw in closer, I step on and trigger a primed bear trap. I hear an instantaneous snap of the device and searing pain shoots up my right leg. I cry out. Nico runs over to me and pulls out his flashlight. my leg is burning, and blood is slowly pulsing from the wound. I feel Nico pry the contraption from my leg, and I hesitate but look down. The hard leather leg holster I was wearing has completely folded and broken, but it may have saved me from a broken leg. Nico rummages through his rucksack. Our meager medical supplies clearly cannot treat the deep wound produced by the trap. Nico pulls out his map of Chernogorsk, and quickly plots a route to the nearest hospital. I can barely stand, so I will have to remain behind. 

All remaining light in the sky has left by the time that Nico begins to leave the church. I had picked up an old lever action shotgun that the dead man at the lectern had by his feet. Nico has given me some pain medication to stop the shaking of my hands from the pain, and I have hidden myself in the corner of the church. Nico makes clear that he will shout out a call word when he comes back into the church so that I don't accidentally fire upon him. After saying a brief goodbye, Nico leaves.

...

I look at my watch. The glowing marks indicate it has been an hour since Nico left. I began to grow worried. The hospital was not too far away. My worries quickly faded as I heard fast footfalls. These footfalls were too fast and measured to be one of the dead's. My fears quickly regain their place as the footfalls pass me to investigate the body that is leaned over the lectern. Nico would have called out. I see the dim outline of the stranger, looking over the body in the front of the church. I see the man is armed. I slowly raise my shotgun, and take aim at the dim outline. I don't want to hurt this man, but I can't say I place his life over mine. The man turns toward me, and I see him raise his rifle. Before he can even take aim, I pull my trigger. The boom is deafening within the confines of the church. The man slumps over into the side of one of the pews. I drag myself closer, and the man is clutching a bubbling wound in his chest. He drops his rifle and shakily exhales. His eyes glint in the pale glow of the glowstick. They meet mine. He looks at me for one last moment before he draws his last breath.

...

Another fifteen minutes pass when I hear the call word quietly said. i respond in kind. Nico comes in and checks my leg. He opens up his rucksack, and pulls out some quick clot and disinfectant. He treats my wound and wraps my leg with new bandages. I tell him about the man who came in, and Nico checks his bag. The man had a pistol hidden on his hip, and several magazines of ammo in his backpack. We barricade the church door with a pew, and wait the night out. By morning, I am able to walk again, and we leave Chernogorsk.",Video,False,self,t5_2wqgc,False,video,author,True,t3_1cddgw,http://www.reddit.com/r/gametales/comments/1cddgw/dayz_the_moral_compass/,
1365831400.0,17,self.gametales,1c98gt,"[Spirit of the Century] Apollo Fox, Flinger of Gorillas",19,2,6,http://www.reddit.com/r/gametales/comments/1c98gt/spirit_of_the_century_apollo_fox_flinger_of/,"Spirit of the Century is a hell of a game. I played it for the first time only recently, after some reluctance, but I enjoyed it quite a bit, and got some interesting stories out of it just the same. This was one of my favorite moments from a relatively short compaign.

For those not in the know, Spirit of the Century is a tabletop role-playing game that has the players enacting tales in the fashion of old pulp fiction stories-- Two-Fisted Tales, Doc Savage, the Phantom, et cetera, et cetera. It doesn't take itself too seriously, but it's also not entirely jokey, either; it has good rules and a nice atmosphere, even in the rulebook. (To wit, under the section on ""Science!"", exclamation point included, it mentions as an example of ""good"" pulp science to use in-game: ""What about the since-disproven theory of the phlogiston, a subatomic particle governing flammability? Not only is that a valid scientific principle in Spirit of the Century, just wait 'til you see my phlotomic bomb!"")

In this campaign, our daring team consisted of: Boy Thunder, a billionaire inventor and protegé to Nikola Tesla; Minerva, a mad scientist à la Girl Genius' Agatha Heterodyne; Ladd, a war veteran and complete psychopath; Victor, a professional race car driver and all-round vehicle enthusiast; and last, my own character, Apollo Fox, a professional thief who makes his ""honest"" living as a stage magician.

In our Spirit of the Century game, we had come face to face with Gorilla Khan, a superintelligent... gorilla, bent on world domination, the result of an experiment by the brilliant Doctor Methuselah. (I feel I should reiterate my first line: Spirit of the Century is a hell of a game.) As one might expect, rather than face us directly, he sent his gorilla cohorts after us, possibly in the aims of creating a battle of attrition which we would come out of weakened to a state that we couldn't fight him.

I will hand it to my team, they did fight well, and they fought efficiently. Boy Thunder and Minerva did a super-science duo, with the former fighting using a weaponized Tesla coil, and the latter with an Archimedes death ray. I am told the scent of burning gorilla hair is indelibly etched into the team's collective memory as a result. Ladd, our former soldier, occupied his time by firing from the back of a speeding car driven by Victor, which was an altogether effective strategy as the average gorilla can't keep up with a motor vehicle on the move.

But Apollo was in a bit of a pickle; being a thief and a stage magician, he was rarely armed, if ever, so he had no convenient gadgetry to dispatch his opponents. Growing up on the mean streets had taught him a thing or two about hand-to-hand combat, but it was an iffy proposition against formidable opponents like these.

One of my favorite maxims as a tabletop gamer is that fortune favors the bold. If you're in a do-or-die situation, and the odds seem iffy, go all out; you'll either succeed in so spectacular a fashion that people will remember it, or you'll fail so amazingly that it will have been worth it.

Fortune favors the bold, and Apollo was nothing if not bold. The conversation with the GM went as follows:

&gt;""The gorilla is bearing down on me, right?""

&gt;""Right.""

&gt;""Alright. I know what I'm doing. I'm going to judo flip the gorilla.""

When a player announces that they wish to use martial arts on a gorilla, you know you have an amazing game on your hands. Apollo's aim in this scenario was to use his knowledge of judo to take the charging gorilla and flip it over his shoulder, using the gorilla's momentum to send it flying.

As is so often the case in these scenarios, this was the perfect time for a perfect roll, and the GM ruled that the resulting roll of ""Legendary Success"" was good enough to warrant using that momentum to hurl the gorilla into its ally standing behind Apollo with enough force to send both tumbling over the edge of the ziggurat, into the deep jungle below.

Boy Thunder's player stated it well, I feel:

&gt;""I just shot a bunch of apes with a lightning cannon, and what you just did was *still* the craziest shit I've heard all night.""

Horrortrial. A grand Duchy of the Dwarven Empire. A mighty fortress with great walls of iron. Where the furnaces never slept, and where no one starved. A truly Utopian fortress. Unless you live there. This is the story of one visitor, a human diplomat, who got a grand tour of the facilities.

It was Summer of the year 257. I had been invited to meet with Duke Litash of Horrortrials, and to be given a tour of the facilities. The first thing I noticed when entering the lands was the blood. It was everywhere, almost always accompanied by body parts, or discarded bone bolts. I shivered, but continued walking, accompanying the scheduled trading caravan. 

Dwarves in steel armour, armed with crossbows stood upon the walls to greet us. After showing them our caravan, the gate slammed to the ground, spooking our horses. The interior of the fortress was no great marvel. A pile of dead goblins to the right of me, giving of a horrifying stench. Vomit all over the interior walls, from these cave dwelling dwarves. Farms, growing berries, with dwarves in ragged cloth clothing running frantically between them stuffing them into barrels, before disappearing back underground. But the worst thing was the dogs. At least 50 hulking dogs, heavily scarred, guarded the cave entrance. They were thin, malnourished, and a quick glance told they were ready to kill upon command. 

Leaving the merchants setting up for their annual market, I proceeded to the Duke's office. I consulted the letter from my King, it was on the 9th floor below the surface. Typical of Dwarves. As I entered, a malnourished kobold found his way to the Cave Entrance. I backed away in fright, but the 50 dogs pounced on him, ripping him to shreds in an instant. I glanced over, one of the dogs had a gaping wound in it's side, but none of the dwarves seemed to care. They just collected the bag and dagger from the corpse, and left it to lie.

The first floor was just a pile of gold and silver goods, piled as high and wide as the eye can see. Dwarves, wearing the trademark ragged clothing of Horrortrial scurry back and forth between the stockpile and the trading depot, preparing to trade with my brethren.

I took a moment to examine the artwork engraved into the walls. Elves on fire, elves being struck down by dwarves, elves in the fetal position, a dwarf eating cheese, an homage to the picture of a dwarf eating cheese. These are a depraved people. I continue my walk down the hallway, but was almost knocked over by a dwarf walking absentmindedly outside muttering ""Need the bones. Likostorogoth... need bones... NEED BONES."" 

I continued downwards, a busy workshop floor, nothing to see there. A crowded dining floor. As usual in these fortresses.

A... graveyard. Piles and piles of coffins, made of brightly coloured rocks. There was a tomb off to the left of me, so I curiously looked inside. It was immaculate. Solid gold walls and floor, and a platinum sarcophagus, memorial slab, and two platinum statues. I examined the slab. ""To Urist GoldMines, The Everlasting Squid. Militia Commander of The Ales of Apes. Killed in 255 by Dastot Shadowhunted the Goblin."" The first statue was a picture of Urist, striking down a goblin, and posing fiercely. This Dwarf was clearly an object of worship for these people. The second was a blacksmith forging an adamantine blade. A plaque on the statue called it ""Urist Goldmine"". Apparently this man crafted his own weapon.

I left the tomb touched by their traditions. Maybe they weren't so horrible afterall. But then, I heard the screams. As I went deeper into the fortress, they got louder. I reached the 9th floor, the Duke's Quarters. A palace by all means, with his own private militia force guarding him, his own food stockpile. This man was a tyrant. Any sympathy I had for his race, instantly vanished. ""Ah. Human."" he groaned. He lifted himself off of his platinum throne. ""I'm going downstairs to oversee the festivities. Care to join me?"" It was evident in his tone, I had no choice. I followed his furious pace, bumping into several dwarves along the way. Several were sobbing, and one was screaming, throwing his clothes at the nearby statues.

I finally caught up to the Duke. He was sitting, laughing to himself, looking down into a pit. There I saw it. A poorly equipped and trained goblin was fighting a pack of trained war bears. ""What are you doing? I thought dwarves were against prisoner torture!?"" I exclaimed, watching as the goblin failed to defend himself against the furry onslaught.

""Ha. This isn't torture, it's execution. And we're kind, we give them a chance to have honour! Look!"" he gestured over to another pit, where a goblin armed with a pike had overcome his challenge of 20 war dogs. A nearby dwarf pulled a lever, and released the Dwarven Champion. An impressive figure, clad in full Steel plate armour, with a red cape. In his right hand, a steel shield, in his left, an adamantine battleaxe. It was no contest. The dwarf strolled over to the goblin and instantly decapitated him. A roar came up from the crowd. ""Why are you doing this? Surely your warriors don't need to hone themselves on these prisoners!""

The Duke turned to me with a glint in his eye. ""Oh right you are. I will show you the pride of Horrortrial."" As I followed him, he explained that the goal of Horrortrial was to produce a super soldier. ""We tried many things. We tried having our militia execute our prisoners, but it just wasn't fast enough. So we built a danger room. They were masterful warriors, sure, but they had one serious problem. They were still just Dwarves. What we needed was a soldier that was above mortal concerns. Above fear, above pain. To that end, we created this.""

What I saw was appalling. Dwarven Children, no older than 7, crammed into small compartments with dogs, biting at them. ""The dogs bite the child, and the child strikes back."" explained the Duke, with that glint returning to his eye. ""After a short while, the strongest emerge. If the child dies, he was not worthy. He is... disposed of. If he survives, he quickly becomes a scarred, talented warrior. After 12 years subjected to such horrors, the child is above mortal concerns. He just... ceases to care."" cackled Litash. ""But then... we have pain. Watch my human friend."" He pulled a nearby lever, and a small amount of lava crashed into a pit next to the chamber, causing a fine red mist to boil out over the children. ""See? The magma mist burns away the skin. Skin is where we feel pain. Without it, they are immune to pain. We have done it. We have created the perfect super soldier!"" he laughed.

He wiped a tear away from his eye. ""Dwarven engineering at it's finest human."" He guided me, now pale and nauseous back to his office. ""Now. What was it you wanted to speak to me about?"" I stuttered several times, and tried to get on track about trade taxes, and assistance in our war against the goblins, but all I could manage was ""Nice place you've carved yourself here"", then sprinted out the fortress.

I must have offended someone. When I reached the gate, it was barred. The caravan was gone, but I noticed the Depot was covered with a fresh coat of blood. The champion I saw in the arena barred my path. ""FOR THE MOUNTAINHOMES!"" he screamed, charging at me. I tried to back away, but walked straight into Litash, now fully armed and armed as well. ""Welcome to Horrortrial.""

The last thing I remember is my blood draining from me, as my arms were removed by their axestrikes. Already, dwarves were cleaning up the remains of my companions, and taking the dead horses downstairs. I closed my eyes and rested, seeing the Goddess Lisha, wrapping me in her arms.

This story is... kind of true. All the places and people described were true. And I did have my baron kill the diplomat. And yes, that includes the super soldier development program.

For those of you who haven't, the situation basically comes down to the player needing to move about a mile or two downriver under cover of darkness while avoiding enemy patrols.*

So, let's set the scene.  This part of the mission starts in an enemy base.  It's nighttime now, so liberal use of the suit's night-vision abilities are all but required, and enemy patrols start using laser sights and flashlights.  This means you can see them from a long way away and try to avoid them.  Immediately after exiting the base, a helicopter bears down on me.  He's easy enough to take down, but I'm now out of ammo on my RPGs and every squad in the area now knows where I am.  I sprint into the woods and start using cloak mode to try and get past.  

I make it to the river without incident and grab a boat, but here's where things get interesting. Assuming you take the same route I did, a helicopter will appear right as the player is launching the boat off a waterfall.  I had the unfortunate luck to have the boat flip over when I hit the water, and the helicopter destroyed it with a missile.  As I said, I didn't have any RPG ammo so all I could really do was run.  I stayed on the fringes where there was shrubbery and dove underwater when I could.  The helicopter AI in this game is almost omniscient, however, so trying to find cover is actually a demanding task.  

Anyways, this continues until I hit an outpost about half a mile down the river.  So now, not only do I have a helicopter dogging me, but I have a dozen soldiers looking for me.  I chose to take the stealthy route here, ducking past the soldiers and continuing downriver.  The soldiers didn't follow, but the helicopter did.  In retrospect, it would have been smarter to take out the outpost as I could have snagged an RPG and been on my way, but I didn't know that at the time.  

It took me literally an hour to make my way to the objective, in no small part to having to hide in the marshlands for a while every time the helicopter lined up a missile shot.  There was one last outpost near the end and this one I decided to assault (several vehicles with fuel tanks = easy kills).  I finally found an RPG here and blew the bastard out of the sky.  By far, one of the most satisfying moments I've had in the game, and it was all unscripted.

1365069185.0,19,self.gametales,1bnh6x,"One Snake, and one Boss (Metal Gear Online)",19,0,3,http://www.reddit.com/r/gametales/comments/1bnh6x/one_snake_and_one_boss_metal_gear_online/,"Metal Gear Online. The multiplayer counterpart of Metal Gear Solid 4: Guns Of The Patriots. Not very many people know of it, as it had a fairly ridiculous sign-up process. It had a cult following that was pretty small in all regions, as it was region locked so we couldn't play together.

The best thing about Metal Gear Online was how adaptive it was. It was the perfect blend of stealth and action that ensured you could play it any way that you wished. Want to run and gun and go for headshots? Go ahead. Want to sneak around the battlefield, waiting for your moment to knock out an enemy, scan his body to reveal the location of his teammates, and then take his weapon? Sure.

It also had this game mode called Team Sneaking. One team were the defenders, who were handed lethal weapons and told to protect certain targets (GA-KO and Kerotan) from the other group, a team of stealth-camo wearing, non-lethal weapon wielding attackers, to wanted to capture the targets and return them to the sneaking team's base.

The goal is simple: Attackers sneak around the battlefield, almost completely invisible, to capture the GA-KO or Kerotan and bring it to an area, where the round will be won. The defenders, on the other hand, are required to defend them from the attackers. They have the benefit of actually being able to kill, while the other team can only use tranqs to put them to sleep, or CQC to knock them out. (Or they could stab them with their knife)

One night I was playing, quite a few years ago. Long before there was even a whisper of pulling the plug on the servers. It was a pretty good night, I had a lot of wins and loses. A lot of close games, and a lot utter defeats.

But this was going to be different. The people that joined were all decent ranks, and the way the rank system worked in the game, you could get a very accurate idea of how good they were. Not like other games where you see someone is Level 38 and you think nothing of it. Ranks were important in this game.

It started off, and we were the sneaking team. Tasked with capturing GA-KO or Kerotan and bringing them home. I chose my weapons, a Mark 22. tranq pistol, an Enemy Locator grenade, and I can't remember what else. We start out agressively. Going for high ground quick and clean. It's easier that way, because if they have to look up, towards the bright sky, they might not see us trying to put them to sleep with tranq darts.

Quite some time passes, as it was a 30 minute game timer, so there was absolutely no need to rush. We managed to kill one or two of their team and that was even more true for us. By the time it was almost over, it was down to me and one other guy.

The map, Groznyj Grad, was fairly big. Even more so for two people to play hide and seek. So I was fairly confident I could do this. I decide to kite around the objective At this point I can't remember if it was the GA-KO or Kerotan. I wait a few seconds, and then I notice the clock, roughly two or so minutes to go. I look around for the enemy, and see he's nowhere to be found. I am pretty sure he's waiting back at the goal point, so I bolt towards the objective. I take it, and turn around to go the back way. My heart is racing. We're the last of our teams. The clock is counting down. My hands are shaking. I'm not sneaking anymore, and my aim is not true.

He pops out around the corner. ""Of course he's right there!"" I scream in my paranoid, everyone's-out-to-get-me frame of mind. He takes some shots and hits me, taking a little off of my life. He's using an M4, very accurate but not very strong. I jump away from his fire, and let go of the objective. We can win the game by killing all enemies or by capturing the objective. There's no way I can take it back in, or else he'll get me when I run, so I decide to leave it, because it's clear we have to fight right now.

We are mere feet apart. That close. He misses every round of his M4 but can't risk reloading, as I'd be sure to get him then. At the same time, I am aiming my MK22, hitting and missing at random intervals, slowly taking down his stamina, getting closer and closer to knocking him out. He then pulls out his pistol, which was a lot more lethal than mine. But then I run out of ammo. I can't reload or else I'd be a sitting duck. So I run in for the CQC. I'm punching and kicking, grabbing and slamming, he's running and jumping, dodging and shooting me with his pistol. He gets me down to a sliver of health. He could spit at me and I'd die. And I get him to a sliver of stamina. It's the closest fight I've ever seen. One punch and it's over, I think. I've got this, but he was so quick, dodging this way and dodging that way. I keep missing. Right then, I go for a grab, but I miss, and my animation takes too long to finish. He dodges, with grace the likes I've never seen before. He knew I was going for a grab, why else would I be that close without punching or kicking. He reloads his pistol right as the animation finishes, and I try to roll into him, which also takes down stamina. I roll right into his bullet, as a single round passes through my body. I drop. Angry. Frustrated. I had him. I HAD him! But he was the better fighter, which was exactly what that was, a fight. It was no shootout or gunbattle, it was a fight. One that I lost.

I still think about it. But he was the better fighter. And no matter how close that game was, it was still one of the best rounds I've ever played.

That game meant a lot to me over the years. One of the games I'll remember for a while. I just wish I could have added that guy and played with him on MY team.

I'm not a good storyteller, but I had to share this.

I have another MGO tale that lasted multiple games over about six hours of continuous play that started with me channeling my inner Solid Snake. I may post that later.

[World of Tanks],21,4,3,http://www.reddit.com/r/gametales/comments/1bitea/dartagnan_gone_in_a_blaze_of_fury_world_of_tanks/,"A quick pre notes. In WoT you have several types of tanks. Artillery in this case is what I was driving. 

So I start a match with my little D'Artagnan, as I nicknamed him. A French artillery, small thing but a huge gun to compensate as all artillery do. Quite a quirky machine really. 

The match ensued and it was a slaughterfest. We were losing tanks left and right. Me and another Arty were alone, left to make a last stand against about 8 of them. I knew it was a loss. But I was damned if I wasn't going to try and kill some of them!

This enemy tank, a heavy, suddenly pops up in sight and drives our way, he had seen us. Now or never I say, I pellet him with a HE round. It hits him for a third of his life. Now i'm shivering. I can be oneshotted easely. ""Stay away!!!!"" I use rubble to hide my thin flat paper metal vehicle. He hits my friendly arty, he got shot with one round. I'm still reloading and he keeps approaching.Setting his sights on me he shoots again, it bounces! The angle was too small to get through my armour. I live for another 5 seconds. Finaly reloaded!

I pellet him again, another third of his life gone. But now he's awefully close. Luckely the second blast ruined his tracks. he's repairing them, but his gunner is still taking aim at me. I quickly hide behind the rubble again. He shoots but jut can't hit me from the angle he has now. His tracks repaired he approaches me again. He manages to get up close and starts to scrape his side against mine to try and prevent me from shooting him as I don't have a gun that can traveser full 360 degrees. I'm dancing the dance of death... Only a few seconds before I'm done reloading. He has shot, but he can't lower his gun deep enough to hit me. 

I tell to myself. ""Did he really just hug my right side??? YES HE DID!"" I turn my gun towards him. And yes the reticle pops onto his tank. Aaah you little rascal and your funny quirks. But then it sinks in. This will end it.

I hush to the tank ""Au revoir D'artagnan!"" I shoot. And in a blaze of glory I kill the enemy tank. But the cost is grave, my tank blows up with my own shell. my flimsy tank couldn't withstand the blast either. I knew this would happen. But I got one of them fuckers with me!

--------------------------
So yeah that happened to me. HE (High Explosive) shells work as you might have figured out with a blast, so if you are too close even if it doesn't hit you you can still take damage. And I took the full brunt as it hit right next to me.",Video,False,self,t5_2wqgc,False,video,,True,t3_1bitea,http://www.reddit.com/r/gametales/comments/1bitea/dartagnan_gone_in_a_blaze_of_fury_world_of_tanks/,

Grimgy's Blunder

We had just came back from an encounter with a boss and had a ton of loot (which we teleported with us). Our rogue had got some throwing knives and knew that they were magical, but had no idea what they did. He asked the DM if he saw any animals around. The DM told him there was a bunny, so our rouge threw one at the bunny and it lit up in flames—instantly cooking it. Our druid wasn't very happy about this and decided out of irony to cast baleful polymorph on the rogue. Our DM turns to him and asks, ""What's the duration on that?"" The player didn't know, so he went to look it up and the look on his face was priceless: ""Permanent..."" Our rogue was now permanently a bunny. On top of all that because our rouge was mouthing off with the DM previously, the DM had some fuchsia goop fall on his head and change his hair color to fuchsia. The rogue was now a fuchsia bunny. [Since we were all new to D&amp;D, we didn’t know that a permanent spell could be broken with break enchantment, etc.] Our DM decided to have some mercy and said that the mages at the castle we were at were able to partially get rid of the spell leaving him with a form of lycanthropy. He would have to roll will saves to not turn into a bunny. Later on after having it for awhile our DM let him go into the form at will, and let him keep his class abilities as well.

Dr. Atalon Von Brock lvl 5 Necromancy Wizard and his ferret familiar/medical assistant Siegfried. Your stereotypical german doctor whose constantly trying to ""improve"" humanity through his experimentations.

So were on an island and we learn of a powerful rich family that is suspected of grave robbing. through sleuthing and the super clever folks in our group we make a few connections and half our party lies in ambush at the graveyard, myself and the good doctor tailing the suspects. A heavy fog has rolled in and our fellows can't really see the guys but they can hear them. The doc and I split up.

I sneak behind their carriage that's pulled up next to the small supply shed, move silently and hide checks made. The doctor walks calmly, calling out to them in his goofy german accent as a distraction. The rest of the party (in character) rush out to help the doctor when they draw weapons, not knowing it was part of our plan. Roll Initiative.

I'm up first. Search the back off the carriage for a shovel or something. none. ""What about the supply shed, where's the door?""

""Other side of the cart, but you'd have to go passed the guys and get in there.""

""What else do I have that's heavy?"" looking at inventory... ""Okay...""

I make a move silently check to move out into line of sight behind the guys.

""Minor action to take out my waffle iron.""

""Are you serious?""

""With utmost certainty. Then, I'm charging that guy.""

Laughs ensue from the rest of the party as I've been known to do silly things before.

""Roll it.""

""16 + 5 and because of Catch off Guard I have no penalty, so 21 vs. AC""

""You wail 'im. A waffle iron is pretty heavy... tell ya what I'll give you an 8% chance that you just knock this guy out right there.""

Rolls 2d10

""Ot 6 (6%). With a loud 'duUuUng' he falls flat for (rolls) 3 rounds.""

""Free action to say 'holy s*** that actually worked' and end my turn.""

the fight raged on as I picked up the unconscious man's shovel and began a shovel battle with his best friend. as the last round of the guy's uncosciousness rolled around I shift over to him.

""I want to coup de grace this guy with the shovel.""

""Okay it's an auto crit if you beat his flat footed AC.""

""14?""

""Hit.""

""12 damage, x2 for crit, 24!""

**Background:**

Our adventurers are in the city of Westgate, Faerun. They're fairly broke but have been making a living through questing and rock performances at the inns.

The city is currently under the control of the Fire Knives (FK), a faction hiding in the shadows of the cities hierarchy. They've gradually been breaking the city down piece by piece and working on subversion of the Shou population of the city.

The Nine Golden Swords (NGS) are a faction for the people, mostly consisting of the Shou. They're working to rebuild the city and take down the FK. The party is looking to help them restore order to the city. They have heard of a meeting of the FK at one of the cities inns and are looking at using it as an opportunity to break into the faction and bring them down from the inside.

The party has previously had some negative experiences with the FKs but after decimating a group of them there has been an offer of truce.

The party has just arrived back in town after recently travelling south to help Tau's sick wife. We healed her but she ended up from severe depression (-3 Charisma Stat).

**The Party:**

Nalla - An orphaned Goliath, raised as a Druid by a group of Elves. (She can turn into a bear).

Nohrai - A Shield Dwarf who excels at both combat as a warlord and as a Warsmith.

Tau - A Changling Bard, whose wife we rescued from a demonspawn fever. (Tau and Nalla have a history of friendship).

Yolo - A Drow cleric of Kord, who was just passing through one day and got drawn into the fray.

Bastard - A Half-Orc Barbarian, he loves the fight and he loves his sword. (He's also the newest entrant to the party.

**Welcome Home:**

We join our adventurers just as they're re-entering the city from their travels. While away they met Nalla, a potions expert. This valuable addition provided Nohrai with some inspiration for how the group could infiltrate the FKs.

The plan is to show the FKs that they were willing to kill the NGSs and fall into rank. However, the goal is to do this without actually killing anyone using a potion of *Seemingly Eternal Sleep*, a potion that slows the heart and breathing so that the target appears lifeless.

Nohrai summons the members of the NGSs to The Old Beard, and gay bar [Backstory to be added soon] in the southern part of the city. Tau would prefer to avoid this place so he and Nalla return to another bar in the north, while Yolo and Nohrai continue on to The Old Beard.

**The Old Beard:**

On the way to the bar, Yolo and Nohrai are called over by a whisper in a dark alleyway. The two venture over and are approached by a member of the Fire Knives.

They are told that the FKs would be willing to form a truce and potentially take us into their ranks if we were willing to prove our devotion to the faction.

Nohrai mentions the meeting, and the potential that the NGS may be there and that our party would be willing to take care of them for a fee and entry into the faction. The stranger agrees and arrangements are made for the party to be allowed into the inn for the meeting.

They continue onward to The Old Beard, but they sense they are being watched and notice glimpses of a Halfling. As they approach the bar the meet Bastard the Half-Orc, who is working security at the bar.

Nohrai mentions the Halfling and offers some gold if Bastard could stop the Halfling from entering. Immediately Bastard spots the Halfling and apparently recognizes him. Bastard lurches forwards sprinting after the halfling screaming ""Where's my sword!""

Bastard runs the Halfling down and proceeds to grab him and beat the life, and the location of his sword out of him. He turns into a quivering mess but reveals the swords location. Bastard heads off to retrieve his beloved sword.

Meanwhile, Nohrai and Yolo head into the bar for the meeting. Nohrai mentions his plan to the NGS. Mentioning that he would have to inflicts some light wounds for the potion to take effect.

The representative of the NGS casts down the plant and instead just wants the party to listen into the meeting and report back. Nohrai begrudgingly agrees and they part ways.

On the way back to the rest of the party Nohrai and Yolo run into Bastard carrying a purple and swollen Halfling head as well as a gleaming bastard sword. Nohrai notices and insignia for the FKs on the head and mentions it to Bastard. The group discuss that they share the goal of bringing the FKs down and the Bastard is willing to join them, for a price.

**The Meeting:**

Prior to the meeting Nohrai has Nalla prepare the potion of *Seemingly Eternal Sleep*, just in case. On the way to the meeting Nohrai has his comrades dip their weapons in the potion and tell them to be ready for anything. Nohrai, Nalla and Yolo head into the inn, while Tau and Bastard join the NGS backup (just in case).

Nohrai's group are met inside by a number of FKs mercenaries who order Nohrai to call over the NGSs backup members to be slaughtered. Nohrai uses a wind whisper ritual to first tell Tau to poison the half-Orc, as his violent nature may be a liability in this situation.

Across the road, Tau stealthily nicks Bastard with a poisoned dagger. However, it doesn't immediately take effect and Bastard realises something’s wrong but can't put a finger on it. He bursts into a blind rage and lashes out at nearby members of the NGSs, taking 3 down with his poisoned (sleep potion) sword.

The remaining NGS members retaliate and strike at Bastard bringing him to his knees. Tau runs up from behind and stabs him again with the poisoned dagger and Bastard falls into a deep slumber appearing dead.

The room is very tense and the NGS members order Tau to drop his weapon. He does and begins negotiating his way out of what appears to be a trap for the NGS. They tie him up, but Tau continues to mention his innocence and even offers to heal one of the NGS members.

The remaining 3 NGS mercenaries grab their comrades and run off into the night leaving and unconscious Half-Orc and a tied up changeling.

After hearing the ruckus from across the road, Nohrai realises that something must have gone wrong and goes across the road to investigate. He finds Tau and Bastard but none of the others. Nohrai quickly orders Tau to turn into a Shou and nicks him with his axe blade. Tau falls into a deep sleep along with Bastard.

Nohrai calls over the mercenaries from the FKs and says that they've been caught out by the NGS. They've taken one of our party hostage and appear to have poisoned another, but we do have a poisoned Shou.

The mercenaries take them blindfolded to a FK stronghold and have Bastard and the Shou man checked out. Both awaken after a period and are interrogated by the FK.

Bastard says that the group was double crossed by the NGS, not knowing any better (he's pretty dumb). The interrogation turns to the transformed Tau who realises quickly what's happening and weaves a story of betrayal on behalf of the NGS.

The FKs said that the party was free to leave but they would keep the Shou prisoner and be in contact soon. Nohrai bluffs that they want to keep the Shou for themselves to torture and beat him for the double crossing.

Lacking credibility the FKs begin to doubt the story. Nohrai turns to the Shou to beat him and Bastard jumps on him and stabs what he believes to be a traitor with the still poisoned dagger. Tau falls back into a deep sleep. However, it was enough to cement the story and the party is free to leave with Tau as a prisoner.

After arriving back to base, Tau awakens and transforms back feeling worse for wear but okay.

Nohrai contacts the NGS using wind word. They are displeased to say the least with his actions from the night before. He mentions that they well integrated into the FKs now and will being providing the NGS with a stream of information.

The NGS don't want to be in physical contact with the party anytime soon and would like to see valuable information arriving ASAP. Or else they will turn on the party as well.",Tabletop,False,self,t5_2wqgc,False,table,,True,t3_1hb6ez,http://www.reddit.com/r/gametales/comments/1hb6ez/dd4e_infiltrating_the_factions/,

\\http://i.imgur.com/hFqFJIp.png

So we are playing 3.5 and I am playing a fighter who just gained Cleave. We have a Cleric of Palor and a Ranger specializing in archery. 

We get into this dungeon where a mad wizard was conducting experiments on prisoners and effectively turning them into controllable zombies. What we deduced it was some kind of heavy hallucinogenic similar I guess to Bath Salts.

But what happened in that room probably is my best Dungeons and Dragons story ever.

We go in, slowly fighting through these enraged husks of former humans, orcs, dwarves, etc. Until we reach his chamber, as it turns out, he is just a feeble old guy whose mind is totally and utterly gone. 

We decide to not harm him, we will let the thing in the cage, known in the diagram as #1 do that. 

He gave the stuff to a freakin troll and it is locked in that cage with bars a good four inches thick.

Well, my character, the fighter thought himself a god among men because that switch he did pulll and that gate that did raise and have that mother nearly the image of the Tank from Left 4 Dead 2 barrel out and grab the old guy. 

My fighter pulls his greatsword, the cleric readies and the archer notches. 

He pulls the old guy into two, a victim of his own creation.

Then, well our attention turns to the troll it lets out a bellowing roar and the fight begi---Oh wait, into the rear drawn to the noise comes dozens of those creations no longer with any direction of their aggression they attack in a pack like manner. Troll at our backs and two dozen or more ""zombies"" in front.

Guess we shouldn't have pulled that lever.

So the troll roars again and the Ranger pulls the lever down. Trapping our cleric in the cage and impaling the troll with one of the spikes through the leg. The ranger smiles and lets loose an arrow, solidly through a head.

I then pull the lever, causing the bars to raise and the injured troll to be let loose, the ranger rushes in and the gate comes down on the leg again. The troll is kneeling forward. I swing.

20.

To hit? 20. DECAPIFUCKINGTATION!!!!

But I am not done yet. While the cleric heals me from inside the cage and the ranger lets loose as well. I cleave my way through three dozen of them.

1366667403.0,16,self.gametales,1cw3xg,[D20 CoC] Joe Gribble and Professor Werewolf,18,2,5,http://www.reddit.com/r/gametales/comments/1cw3xg/d20_coc_joe_gribble_and_professor_werewolf/,"Here is the third and final story in the saga of Joe Gribble.

Before I pick up where we left off in part 2, I feel I need to mention an event that happened to our group before we ran into Camp Scarface and the werewolf attack, this will be important later:

While we were living on the road and scavenging what we could, the group encountered 2 eldritch abominations the likes of which would drive any man insane: Beavis and Butthead. In a nutshell, I tried to snipe them ineffectually and they unleashed their zombie thralls on us full force as we hauled ass away from them in some hotwired vehicles. They had clearly won this first engagement, but we PCs vowed revenge.

And now back to where we left off :)

After the death of so many people around him, Joe Gribble's outlook on life and morality got considerably grimmer. If his best efforts were barely enough to survive, what hope was there for a future in this bleak landscape filled with zombies, werewolves and rogue cartoon characters? It wasnt that I intended to play this character as a psychopath, but every NPC around me was getting slaughtered one way or another and there was definitely blood on Joe Gribble's hands whether he wanted to acknowledge it or not. 

However, one thing was easy to acknowledge; Joe Gribble wasn't ready to die yet.

I awoke on the other side of the graveyard wall, next to the narrowed chasm of nothingness. Remembering my encounter with Slenderman, I made all haste to jump the chasm, barely making it across. ""Not yet, Gribble, not yet"" I grunted as my shaking arms levered me over the edge, the still unhealed werewolf claw wounds in my back beginning to bleed again.

I soon met up with the 2 new PC's (replacing those that died in the werewolf battle), one of whom is a professor. My friends, never trust a professor in a Call of Cthulhu game. This one was all overly interested in my werewolf injuries. That's called foreshadowing folks.

So I tell them about the coordinates in Oklahoma and we agree to go there forthwith. We (me, 2 PC's, NPC Kurt) arrive at an isolated and reinforced gas station stocked with a little food and water and instructions to wait there for an unspecified amount of time for some sort of militia to come pick us up. Great. What's even better is we dont have enough food to wait much longer than a week.

I was away from the group, talking with the professor when the other 2 PC's who had also escaped over the chasm of nothingness arrived at the gas station. Upon recognition, they are too stunned to do anything as I pin one of them to the wall of the compound and commence to beating him while screaming ""You left me!"" over and over. The rest of the party separates us. 

Dialogue ensues. They try to apologize. I tell them if they ever cross Joe Gribble again I will kill them like I killed Scarface. Over the next few days of rest one of them makes a sincere attempt to atone for what he did, but the other PC isn't taking me so seriously. Lets call him Cody.

All of us were pretty torn up from our respective trips, so we rested up for awhile eating our available food. I managed to rig up some silver bullets for us using a silverware set stolen from the haunted house. Tired of holding onto his horrible secret, the Professor told the party that he was actually a werewolf. In fact, he was the brother of the werewolf that gave me these bitchin scars.

The rest of the group accepts him for the sake of metagame, but I insist that Professor Werewolf and I take a walk. ""We have things to discuss"" I say as I load my rifle with the new silver bullets. He's nervous, but I assure him it's for my own protection. What he didnt know is that I already had a plan in mind for this party's werewolf. I would use my animal handling skill to learn a way to trigger his transformation and use him as a sort of monster-bomb on anyone that pissed me off enough. A game-over scenario for any occasion.

So we go on our walk, I sweet talk him with a plan to help him control his impulses (my background was as a dog trainer) and make an agreement to help him find and kill his brother. It's a complete sell.

After we resolve our immediate disputes and regain our HP, the group agrees we need to go find food in the nearest town. Nevermind the note left by the militia said to not go there at all costs, that's where we're going. The plan is to hit the first grocery store and everyone grabs enough food for themselves. This is a miserable failure as only me and one other PC remembers to grab said food while we're being ambushed by Ridley Scott's aliens. By the end of it I'm screaming from the numerous acid related injuries my body recieved while riding out of town in the back of a speeding truck. I choose to blame Cody for the failure of the mission (at least partially true) and I refuse to share my food with him.

So once again we're back at the armored gas-station, still without adequate food and now enjoying horrible acid injuries and renewed strife in the party. Cue the arrival of Beavis and Butthead with their horde of zombie thralls.

We heard the moaning first and hid ourselves as best we could, considering we would have to go outside to gain roof access. At first the zombies just passed by the gas station, but then we heard much more sinister voices. ""Hey look Butthead, heh, it's a gas station, heh. I bet there's nachos inside."" ""Uhuhuh, hey you guys, uhuhuh, tear that door down.""

As the zombies begin to rip at the barricades, a plan is brought to bear with furious haste. The food supplies are ripped apart in a desperate search, but alas, there are no chips and no cheese among them. Professor Werewolf steps up and begins to attempt to negotiate with these inhuman things to no avail. As the diplomacy yields nothing (cmon, it's Beavis and Butthead) Cody hatches his own plan. 

In retrospect, it really wasn't that much different than my own masterplan of getting close to important NPC's and triggering a werewolf bomb, it just lacked a certain elegance. While the rest of us are embroiled in a fight with the zombies while trying to go out the back door, Cody starts kicking Professor Werewolf in the dick. For 2 or 3 rounds before starting to run away. 

Meanwhile outside we hear the sound of vehicles and automatic gunfire, the militia! I'm blasting zombies at the backdoor. We get it open and I make my most critical mistake. I waited to help people out instead of running out first myself. Cody runs past me and I'm running right behind him when Professor Werewolf comes up from behind and grapples me in front of about a dozen zombies.

I am rent anew by werewolf claws as zombies dogpile on top of us both. I know I will only have one chance to save myself, use an animal handling check to make the werewolf eat the zombies while I escape the grapple. It works, but too well as he shreds through the other grappled zombies in 1 round and gets ready to end me as more zombies crowd around. 

Meanwhile the other PC's have gotten into the militia vehicles and are about to take off. I tell the DM that I'm going to break the grapple by kicking Professor Werewolf off of me and into the zombies. Natural fucking 20. I get up and run for the nearest vehicle while he tears through the other zombies, but the vehicles are too far away. The next round he leaps onto my back and begins ripping out and eating chunks of my flesh while the other PC's and militia NPC's flee in horror.

And that was how Joe Gribble died, his last roll a natural 20. It's probably for the best, as killing important NPC's via manipulation of another PC was a dubious goal and it's doubtful the DM would have allowed it, but in the end he proved to be the savior of the group in that he was a great distraction to the Professor Werewolf that Cody unleashed upon us all.

And the worst part? We didnt even get to try to hurt Beavis and Butthead. Unchecked, they would continue to gather their forces until they became the bane of our future characters existences as well.",Tabletop,False,self,t5_2wqgc,1366702113.0,table,,True,t3_1cw3xg,http://www.reddit.com/r/gametales/comments/1cw3xg/d20_coc_joe_gribble_and_professor_werewolf/,

---------------------------------

My friends were nervous. We had been locked into this cave by some unknown entity, and tensions were running high. My little brother says he is going to get some dirt to get us out of here. My friends and I quietly discuss what has happened. my little brother, who is intently staring at the screen, is totally zoned out. My friend leans over, and quietly mentions *Herobrine*. I quietly chuckle at him. ""You're funny"" I say under my breath. Almost immediately, my little brother, who heard nothing, says ""Who's that?"" We all focus on his screen. We see nothing but cave. ""Someone was there. I swear."" He says, with a sense of urgency. I scan all of the screens on the TV. Not a single one of us is near him. I can feel a knot begin to form in my stomach. ""Hey, you know what, let's do something else"" I say,bringing the Xbox back to the dashboard. My friends give me a look, but go and turn on Netflix. My little brother says ""I swear I saw someone."" I nod to him, and he leaves the room.

I go into the other room and grab my laptop. I knew strange things had happened previously, but I had shrugged them off as strange occurrences. Now, with the cave incident hanging in my head, I had to check my world. I found some irregularities quickly. There was an open nether portal in the middle of the woods I had not placed. When I entered this portal, it lead to the same portal my gateway lead to. There were *three* portals, something I do not think is possible. When exiting the portal in the nether, it lead me back to my home. I could feel my paranoia tightening the knot in my stomach. I visited the cave we had been. I did not go in, but I could see where we had gone, and I peered over the edge. Darkness greeted me at the bottom of the pit.

Simply being here was giving me the willies, so I went home. I tried to rationalize what was happening. I could not. When the sun rose the next day, I went down my rail line to the outpost. About as far out as I was willing to travel, the outpost marked a place that I did not want to venture any further eastward. I explored along my rail line, and came upon something that startled me even more. along the beach, halfway in between the outpost and the adjoining mountain was a small strip of sand in the water. On the sand, were tracks. *Tracks I had not placed.* I could feel the hairs on my neck begin to rise. I had never let anyone else play on this world. I remember using a calculator to find out how much iron I would need for a rail line, and wasting tracks would not be something I would do.

I explored further, with nervousness causing my heart to pound in my cheeks. Upon a small island, I found a cramped cave. Being inquisitive, I checked the cave. *There was yet another unlit torch.* My fright was rising, and I marked the island with a giant tower of cascading water. I knew something was wrong here. *I felt it.*

I pick the Franks, which come equipped with all farming techs from the getgo, while Bro #1 takes the Huns and Bro #2 turtling as the Byzantines.

The game begins with Bro #2 and I pissed about our map placements. Neither one of us can find our berries, and Bro #1 found about ten sheep in the first two minutes. Needless to say, the Huns charged into the lead, getting Feudal Age first and launching a rush on the Byzantines before the latter can get their shit together. I finally find my berries after getting a successful farming industry and boom my population to twice it's size, delaying my Castle Age and widening the gap. By this point the Byzantines have been halfway slaughtered and without a military are now using watchtowers offensively.

In a secret meeting among kings, the decision is made: The Huns must fall. The Franks dump everything they have into woodcutting and farming, advancing to Castle Age for appearances alone, while persuing a more ambitious goal: to create a horde the likes of which have never been seen.

It was a peaceful morning on the eastern fringe of the Hun empire. A small mining town has recently erected a temporary wooden defense, mostly for peace of mind. The ground rumbled with the approach of horsemen. Hundreds of horsemen. More horsemen than there were people in the Hun empire. They burst through the wall, inspiring terror and slaughtering the village, before piercing deeper. A lumberjacking community to the west was asssaulted next, and it was here that the experienced Hun cavalry and their well-equipped swordsmen confronted the horde. An epic battle took place over the fields of grain, but under fire from multiple stone fortifications and towers, along with the might of the best shock troops in the world, the horde was finally stopped.

The Hun king then taunted the Franks for the defeat of their army.

On the next Hun raid of the Byzantine defenses, the Franks suddenly appear and attack like a swarm of spiders. Again, hundreds of light cavalry backed by pikemen surround the Hun shock troopers, this time crushing them and preventing a retreat to friendly territory. The Frankish message was clear: You defeated -an- army. The horde moved north, suddenly bursting forth from the trees and slaughtering a woodcutting camp in the far west of the empire, its most vulnerable flank.

The Huns responded by building their own army of champions and cavaliers, and then begin producing artillery. Lots of it. Enough to level an entire wall of castles. The Hun king is determined to respond in force. But as he probes the western defenses of the Frankish empire, they find yet another hidden horde. The scouting troops are chased in a mad flight to the far east, running deep into the woods to escape the charging horde. They suddenly emerge in unfamiliar territory.

There is a wide open plain ahead. An abandoned stonemining camp sits at the foot of a construction project unlike anything else in the world. A cathedral to the western God rises above the hills and the trees, its spires extending to the stars above. As the horsemen finally catch up to the exausted scouts, a single Hun rider dehorses to warn his king of what he has seen.

Word gets out. The Franks have advanced to the status of true empire, using the stone and gold not spent on civilized warfare to build huge monuments and cities. History will surely record them as the greatest civilization if their wonderous cathedral stands the test of time.

The Hun king has found his target. The entire army and its artillery are unleashed, crossing the plains and arriving south of Frankish territory mostly unhindered. They move east- victory is in sight! The terrible mass awaits as the age of kings reaches its end. One final battle occurs on this open field at the steps of the house of God. Hundreds, ney thousands are killed in the continuous battle, and even the Byzantines, once allied with the Franks, have now turned their wrath against them. The fight rages on, until the entire row of artillery prepares its payload.

The line breaks; the Franks close in. A few stones are thrown but the majority are cut down, the artillerymen scattered. The Huns fall into full retreat, knowing their battle supremacy has irrevokably ended.

Final score:

Bro #1 (Huns) 9,981
Me (Franks) 6,463 [W]
Bro #2 (Byzantines) 5,890

It's going to only be updated fortnightly since that's when we play.

**[Part 1](http://www.reddit.com/r/gametales/comments/1eq47o/dd_4e_the_turning_of_the_rat_shifter_part_1/)**: For those of you who want some background.

**Prepare for Battle:**

*(This doesn't relate to Selimic, its part of the main plotline.)* A couple of days after repairing the Temple of Selûne, we awoke to find a dead body of the Inn Keeper of our favoured tavern outside. Pinned to his body was a note with the words ""You're Next!"" *(correct spelling and all, we were fairly terrified because it meant they were educate)*. On his cheek he was branded with a dagger in a circle, the brand of the Fire Knives. Turns out we were stirring up some trouble in town and they didn't like it.

That day we prepared reinforced the temple ready for battle. Spike pits in front of the windows, barricades in front of the doors and a massive spike set above a secret trap door into the temple.

That night we kept watch waiting for the inevitable assault on our temporary home.

**The Assault:**
Night rolled around and just as the second watch rolled around, Nohrai heard the stone slab above the trapdoor being lifted. He turned around just in time to see a huge spike slam down the hole and could hear the crushing should of bone and gurgling of tearing flesh and blood. He awoke the rest of the group and told them to prepare for battle.

Suddenly, the head of the flail cam slamming through the back door opening a hole for a dog enter through. Tau, cleaved its head off with his rapier.

At the front door Nohrai could see another behemoth of man with flail wailing on the front door as some Halflings raised some ladders to the windows with the spike pits underneath.

One of the Halflings reached the top of the window and knocked it in and pulled at his sling and took a shot at Nohrai. The second halfling came running up the ladder with two slings in each hand. This stupidity lead to him falling into the pit below.

At the same time the large man at the back door with the flail knocked out the remaining boards and entered the building. While Yolo and Tau dealt with the large man. Lia took out here bow and launched an arrow through the remaining Halflings head, who joined his friend in the pit below.

Visibly shaken by the death of his allies the behemoth at the front door was driven into a blood rage slamming heavily against the door. After failing again and again he fell to his knees weeping. He was done. 

The remaining hulking man was finished off by Tau and Yolo, leaving his remains packed with arrows and crossbow bolts.

**The Next Morning:**
The temple was saved and the party helped to clean and repair the temple. It appeared the Fire Knives would have to take this party seriously.

Nohrai stepped out and posted a sign in the courtyard stating the party was sick of this shit and willing to talk seriously. He returned to the sign finding a note stating the Fire Knives would be in contact soon.

The game is GTA San Andreas Multiplayer. SAMP for short.  I was on a role playing server and the Admins had set up a Death Match event where all the factions get set up in a sectioned off in the unused city of San Fiero. The event was this, Each faction would start out in the center.  Then each team would get to one of the bunkers around the map.  Now there were a ton of bunkers all over the city. Some good, some not so good.  The aim was to set up and defend yourself from the other gangs.  Last gang standing wins, there is a small grace period in which no killing is allowed. Plus everyone had a day or two before the event to search the city for a good place to bunker up. However, there was one that was better than any other.  That was the battleship.   Now the battleship only has one entrance and that is from the sea, and boats aren't allowed so you have to swim to it. But in SAMP you cannot shoot while you swim.  So effectively if you got in that base, no one else would be able to get in as long as someone was watching the entrance. Needless to say this was going to be a highly contested bunker.

So we all start off at the center of the map. At the construction site that is by the gas station. We have a good starting position. The timer to begin starts ticking down. Im driving so I am reving my engine. I got about 4 people car surfing as well as 3 people in the car with me. When the clock reaches zero about half the players all make a b line for the tunnel that takes you to the battleship.  We arent off to a good start... Already falling behind by the time we make it to the ship people are already pulling up and getting out of their cars to get to the bunker.  (Whoever gets there first claims the spot as their gangs) So all my teammates are saying we should go to one of the other spots and I put on my not today face and floor it. I mean I get the van going as fast as it could possibly go. I say 7 words and everyone is saying what the hell. Those words are ""I hope you know how to swim"" Everyone is freaking out as I launch our van 30 some feet off the pier and into the water. We all get out (or off for those car surfing) and swim to the battleship and were able to claim it for ourselves. 

As the grace period ends, we get attacked by a few gangs.  However, we mow them all down before they can even make it out of the water. I die as a few people providing cover fire for their men in the water, but we hold the battleship fairly well. Eventually we loose the event because gangs stopped coming to our bunker. So we have to go out and find the gangs that are left.  Eventually the last of us die and the game ends for us.  I am not too sure which faction won, but all I know is that I am solely responsible for getting us the best bunker in the game.",Video,False,self,t5_2wqgc,1367202968.0,video,ranconteur,True,t3_1db25h,http://www.reddit.com/r/gametales/comments/1db25h/samp_gang_wars_can_be_fun_just_remember_to_bring/,

I’m so amazingly goddamn rich. A string of gold-studded and jewel-encrusted Mine levels led straight into the Jungle, where two levels in a row left a Bone Idol trivially close to the exit. I barely had to nudge them to get out $40,000 richer, long before the ghost they trigger showed up. And now I’ve found the Black Market.

It’s a network of shops where, if you haven’t angered any shopkeeps thus far, you can buy almost every item in the game, and one that’s available nowhere else: the Ankh. The Ankh gives you a second life, and costs $50,000. It’s hard to earn $50,000. I have $120,000.

Before I get it, I want all the other equipment I’ll need. Most of it’s on the middle floor, but there are enemies: two boomerang tribesmen watch over the entrance to the shops, and a snail blows acid bubbles up the ladder that could help me bypass them.

I buy a shotgun from the top floor, then drop down to blow all the tribesmen away in one shot. I miss. A boomerang knocks me out of the air, nailbitingly close to a fatal pitcher plant below, and onto the snail. The snail is crushed, but the tribesmen are wild: by the time I pick myself up, one has thrown himself to his death and the other has jumped into the shops. Now he prowls them slowly, looking for me.

This is tense. I’m dying to shoot him, but it’s madness to fire in the direction of a shopkeeper. I just have to tail him at a safe distance and buy the items I need as I pass them. I’m reasonably confident he won’t turn round – and even if he does, he dropped his boomerang outside.

There’s a boomerang on sale in this shop actually. The tribesman walks up to it. He picks it up.

For a split second, I am amused. He’s going to buy a new boomerang! Silly tribesman, you don’t own material wealth!

Then my internal simulation of Spelunky’s interacting systems kicks in, and I see the next few seconds flash before my eyes with pure horror.

I run.

I jump onto the ladder, scramble up, dive away from the top floor shops, duck behind a mound of earth and hug the ground. Jesus Jesus Jesus Jesus Christ.

For a second, nothing happens.

Then the Black Market explodes.

All nine shopkeepers hurl themselves into the air and start firing their shotguns in random directions. They kill the tribesman. They kill two other tribesmen. They kill frogs, pitchers, snails. One kills the slave he was selling, another kills his own dog. Two of them throw themselves to their deaths in the excitement. Four of them throw themselves into a pit, where their bursts of buckshot cut each other to ribbons.

When the blasts quiet down, I crawl slowly out of my hiding place and walk carefully through the empty shops, collecting everything for free. What happened here was: the Tribesman walked out of the shop. He walked out of the shop with the shopkeeper’s boomerang in his hand, and he walked out of the shop without paying for it.

Shopkeepers don’t know, much less understand, who stole from them or damaged their store. Any crime, of any kind, is cause for an indiscriminate rampage that kills everything in line of sight, and a lot more besides. When that happens in the Black Market, there’s a term for it. It’s the shopstorm.

I find one surviving shopkeeper hopping madly around the Ankh, bouncing on the bodies of the colleagues he’s killed. I throw one of the 35 sticky bombs I’ve shoplifted at him, and he detonates a second later. I take the Ankh and the heaps of gold the shopkeepers dropped.

In four levels’ time, I’ll use the climbing gloves I stole to cling to a wall in the ice caves, directly below a collapsing platform that will fall onto me and hit the jetpack I stole, causing it to explode and kill me, wasting the Ankh I stole. But all I’m thinking right now is wow, I’m still incredibly rich.",Video,False,self,t5_2wqgc,False,video,,True,t3_1be33u,http://www.reddit.com/r/gametales/comments/1be33u/shopstorm_by_tom_francis_spelunky/,

##Synopsis:

A group of six blocky men have traveled to a new continent on an expedition to explore and document the dangerous unknown. Two soldiers, pressed into duty for the mission; an experienced and wizened captain; a scientist, eager to study the new world; a mine foreman and capable leader; a young adventurer, eager to map out the unknown and face the unspeakable horrors that abound on its land. With their ship destroyed by the whims of the ocean and their supplies washed away into the blue abyss, they must start from scratch if they intend to survive and make their way back home.

A week into the expedition has led the adventuring party to a mountain, and a cave that bends down into the dark unknowns beneath the earth. The group ventures inside, needing to mine for the materials necessary for the rest of their journey. But once inside, a traitor in the group reveals himself. One of the soldiers, intent on creating his own empire in this new world, has trapped one of the party members deep inside an abandoned mineshaft, and has put his evil plan into action!

Now the rest of the party must find a way to free their trapped friend and escape this labyrinth of death. Will they ever see their party member again? What surprises has the traitor set up for the unwitting group?

###Part 2: The Cave Story
##Chapter 4: Trapped!

Saturday rolled around with a fresh set of rules in place. Aaron, the cunning bastard who had set this trap and turned the game on its head, would be allowed free reign in the server during the week to set up the traps in any way he needed. In order to ease the burden on him, the rest of us agreed to not break any blocks except where we were allowed to (so he wouldn't have to escape-proof the walls with Obsidian, like he had done with my current trap). He was also not allowed to put us in any ""no win"" situations.

With the rules set, we all joined into the server. I was still trapped in my Obsidian-walled cell, though now with an iron door set in it. I could hear my party members had rendezvoused back at camp, wondering where Aaron and I had gone off to. They decided to eat, forge themselves better tools for further explanation (and, of course, more torches), and then would come searching for us if we hadn't returned by the time they had finished. I knew I would be stuck here for a while, and I paced in my cell aimlessly for what seemed like hours.

On one lap of my dungeon prison, I heard a zombie's moan. I froze in fear, whipped around and ran to the door to check to see if there were monsters outside. Nothing. The monster spawner in my prison was a skeleton spawner, and the room and outside mineshaft was thoroughly lit, so no unholy creatures could have spawned from there. So why was I hearing zombies? I moved slowly toward the back corner of the room again, and sure enough heard more zombies. They must be just on the other side of the wall. I quickly ran back to the placating silence of the doorway.

I could hear my party over Skype chat worrying about how long we were taking. Greg suggested a search party, he and Andrew leaving to scout for us. Mark was immediately against splitting up any more than we already were, and gave an ultimatum - either they all go, or no one goes. Of course, upon voting whether to search or stay, only Mark had voted to stay. Begrudgingly, he packed up his supplies and set out with the others.

Aaron had seemingly vanished. Perhaps he was delving deeper into the mountain, preparing still more deadly and dastardly traps for our group. Perhaps he had been killed by a spider or a zombie. If so, good riddance!

As I stared at the prison I was stuck inside, I noticed something new - a button installed next to the treasure chest that I hadn't seen during my pacing earlier. Maybe Aaron had left it there when he built my prison, as a way to escape through the door. I calculated how long it would take me to run from the button to the door, optimistically thinking I might be able to make it. I ran over and pressed the button, and noticed a light in the opposite corner of the room go out. A zombie moaned, louder than before.

I turned slowly to where the light had gone out, and saw that the button hadn't, in fact, activated the  door, but instead opened up a hole in the wall where the light used to be, one block wide and two blocks tall. A zombie shuffled into the room. A skeleton spawned in the darkened corner. Letting out an audible curse, I ran toward the new danger and thrust a torch into the wall close enough to light up the darkness and stop any more skeletons from spawning. I was struck by an arrow for my effort, and quickly retreated to the opposite corner of the room. I unsheathed my stone sword and waited, staring grimly as another zombie made its way in, dodging an arrow and engaging the closest zombie in combat.

*Hurry up, guys, I don't want to die in here.*

##Chapter 5: The Clock is Ticking...

Greg and Kyle were in the lead of the expedition, carefully following the tunnel Aaron and I had traveled through hours earlier. There were signs where iron and coal had been mined, and the trail of torches led the way, but still they went cautiously, making sure to check any small side rooms for evidence or monsters. Eventually, they saw the hole we had climbed down to reach the mineshaft, and as they were surveying it I could hear Greg organizing them. He would go down first, followed by Mark, then Kyle, and finally Andrew to bring up the rear and protect their backs if anything should go wrong.

Cautiously, they started their way down the narrow staircase that had been built around the edges of the drop and kept an eye out for any traps or monsters. It didn't help. As Greg reached the second corner, he heard the sound of pistons being activated and barely had enough time to register it as the stone ""staircase"" suddenly retracted into the wall, sending all four members of the search party falling to the next level of stairs some fifteen blocks down. They were all heavily injured by the fall, and exchanged many expletives as they ate their fill of bread and apples. At least there were only two more turns left before they would reach the bottom of the hole, so any more falls would be an inconvenience, but not necessarily life-threatening.

Meanwhile, my character was fighting valiantly to hack through the hordes of zombies as they streamed into my dungeon prison. I had tried fighting my way through to the other side of the fairly short hallway, but my way was blocked by zombies each time, and I was forced to retreat to my cell. At least I was building up a nice collection of rotten flesh. I finished killing the nearest zombie to me and quickly ate a piece of bread to replenish my fairly low health. One loaf left, and an endless stream of zombies still to go. 

Suddenly, it hit me. I could stop them from getting in. Just one block would be enough to cover their entrance. I don't know why it didn't occur to me before - maybe it seemed to easy? But with my new goal in mind, I sprinted toward the hole letting these vile creatures in and managed to get a block of cobblestone in it, stopping the advance of evil into my cell. After quickly dispatching the last two zombies, I filled in the remaining hole and went back to the doorway, just waiting for a sign that someone was coming.

Greg, Kyle, Mark and Andrew stood at the bottom of the hole and took stock of their situation. They were definitely expecting more traps, so they split their remaining food rations evenly before advancing anywhere, just in case. Andrew refused to lead the way, volunteering Mark in his place. The two hadn't gotten along since our arrival on the island, and Andrew would probably be ecstatic if Mark died. Mark quickly refused the invitation to be the rat for this maze, and with no shortage of annoyance in his voice Greg announced he would be going first, again, and Andrew could bring up the rear.

With that settled, the group started their journey into the mineshaft, cautiously looking down every corridor before moving on. They chose to ignore the paths overgrown with spider webs, scared off by the hiss of spiders and under the impression that Aaron and I would have cleared away at least some of the webs in our exploration. Kyle attempted to keep a mental map of the turns they were taking, but quickly found himself unsure of his own memory and relegated himself to silence, along with Mark, who seemed too scared to say anything as they ventured deeper into the cave.

And suddenly, Greg appeared in my sight through the iron door's window, two intersections away. I called out to him and he turned, starting toward me quickly with Kyle, Mark and Andrew following close behind. And just as suddenly, pillars of gravel appeared from the ceiling, falling down to block their path to me. I could hear Kyle curse and then a moment later, curse louder as another side of the path was blocked off by gravel. I could just barely hear them through the trap wall as Kyle explained the situation - walls of gravel cut off every path but one. They had to take it.

*Hold tight, Kevin, we're coming!*

##Chapter 6: The Psychopath's Game

Andrew called a quick meeting before they continued. Something wasn't right. How could they have triggered the trap? There was no pressure plate, no button, no motion sensor. How could this happen? The group was silent, thinking about what could have done it when the sound of cave spiders hissing startled them into action. As they turned down the only remaining path, Kyle pointed out a sign sitting in the intersection ahead of them.

With some trepidation, the group walked toward the intersection and the sign - which was facing away from them - as Andrew cautioned them to be on the lookout for traps. They inched forward, eventually reaching the room and moving around to read the sign. As they did, the path they took to enter the intersection was suddenly closed off by gravel falling from the ceiling. Of course. They stared at the sign for a minute. It read:

`:D`

`Welcome`

Andrew broke the sign in anger as Greg, Mark and Kyle looked around. On the wall heading into each of the three remaining corridors was another sign, each with the first line ""CAUTION"". The second line of the far right path, which led further away from me, had ""LLAFTIP"" on the second line; the far left path read ""NOTELEKS""; the middle path read ""AVAL"". Obviously, Pitfall, Skeleton, and Lava backward.

Greg put in an immediate vote for the Skeleton path, which Andrew quickly seconded. Skeletons weren't as instant-death terrifying as Lava or a long fall, and there were four of them. It was the easy choice. Kyle agreed and Mark, still silent, nodded. Again Greg took the lead, leading the group down a winding but otherwise empty hallway, always on the lookout for traps or danger. It was eerily quiet and lifeless, for a maze of death.

After another three turns, Andrew was beginning to grow restless, nervous that any moment a skeleton would pop out. As they turned the next corner, they froze. Staring grimly ahead of them, the group took in the path that lay ahead. Particles of lava dripped down from the ceiling and maybe 15 paces forward, a solid stone pillar rose to bisect the three block wide path. On either side of the pillar was a pressure plate, and two signs adorned the pillar. On either side of the path, gravel walls five blocks across hinted the possibility of a new trap.

The group, still led by Greg, inched forward, as the sounds of zombies and skeletons began to fill the air. They got close enough to read the signs.

`One of these buttons`

`Drops lava`

and

`The other`

`Drops walls`

Looking beyond the pillar and pressure plates, Kyle grimly reported that there was nothing beyond, just a dead end. They had to either choose one of the plates, or walk back to pick a new path. Mark, who had been silent the entire time, hopped over one pressure plate and walked to the dead end three paces away, staring at the corner. Andrew made a snarky comment that just because he wasn't looking, didn't mean the danger wasn't real. Then came the sound of pistons, and suddenly a doorway opened up in front of Mark, who quickly ran inside. The stone wall slammed shut almost as quickly as it had opened.

In his surprise and eagerness to see what had happened, Kyle had run forward, right across one of the pressure plates. More pistons. Greg felt his heart drop. They might die right here.

The left wall fell instead, disappearing into the ground and revealing a dungeon full of zombies and skeletons, but only a zombie spawner. The three remaining party members immediately leapt into action, iron swords drawn. Kyle and Andrew lit up most of the room easily enough, leaving only a small hallway in the back of the dungeon unlit.

I could hear them fighting on the other side of the wall, and quickly ran to break down the barrier I had hastily thrown up. A zombie and skeleton were standing in the hallway, which I quickly lit with a torch before retreating to the openness of my cell. A final blow to the zombie shattered my well-worn stone sword, forcing me to switch to my old, wooden sword as I dodged an arrow from the skeleton and lunged forward to strike. In the other dungeon I could hear Andrew yelling and cursing, and Greg telling him to replenish his health back in the hallway. He ran out, and as I walked through the hallway into the other dungeon to reunite with my party, I heard a slam as Andrew pounded his keyboard.

In the bottom left hand corner of the screen, was the message we were dreading. Andrew was dead.

Kyle glanced into the hallway as Greg and I dispatched the last couple monsters, and he ran back into the dungeon cursing and shouting that there must be a skeleton dungeon because there were skeletons falling through a hole in the ceiling down at the last corner of the hallway. *Shit*, that was our only escape! Unless... Greg glanced at the dead end and, sure enough, the doorway Mark had disappeared into had opened up again. Not even bothering to check the dungeon's treasure chest, the three of us ran through the door and up a stone staircase, which exited into a large cavern, filled with waterfalls and lava flows and the occasional creeper and skeleton dotted in the distance.

We did it.

We were free!

Our group expanded a bit, and as a result, we ended up having to split the parties a bit. Unfortunately, i missed the last meeting, which was entirely roleplay, so i will give a breakdown here as far as i've heard:

* Spetrovi decided to take his goblin back to town and get drunk. Unfortunately, his goblin takes advantadge of the situation and slips away while he nurses a hangover.

*  Dusk, Davneiros, and Bayne (a human hunter) go to the mage shop. Dusk, being dusk, is being an absolute jerkwad to the shop owner. His patience runs short, and sets a spell to swap the three between their bodies (they keep their abilities, but have to switch stat pages, making them useless).
* Throzgar returns to his matron, cares for his brothel, and has a massive orgy.
* The three body swapped individuals meet up with Airde, and they decide to visit a temple dedicated to the goddess of chance. One of the priests has the hots for Airde, which is then used to negotiate a deal with the Goddess: In return for swapping them back to their correct bodies, they will give the pastor Davneiros' soul to use as an employee. (it should be noted that the reason they did this is because he was being lame and didn't show up to the session). They all agree, and get their bodies back
* Bengal and Airde pay a visit to Ziggs, only to discover a large door leading to a basement. They follow the stairs and realize they have entered into a sex dungeon, and walk in on ziggs, who promptly freaks out. Bengal tries to throw Airde under the bus by holding him down, but fails his strength check, gets overpowered, and loses his grip. Airde then spartan kicks him down the stairs into the waiting arms of Ziggs, then runs out the door and puts a magical seal on it.
* the others just generally do their thing, collect themselves.

Enter session 3. There are now two parties with two separate dm's, Nagad Olimpius is written off so he can become group 2's dm. 

I am not part of group 1, who is in a nearby district, but here is a basic rundown of what happens for them: 

* Airde enters a pet shop and meets the owner, an attractive woman. He quickly seduces her, and in a similar streak of luck to Throzgar's, ends up marrying her and inheriting the Pet shop
* Tabu gets to know the stable owner, Ferroth, and they spark a cute high-school-crush-esque romance.
* Dusk runs into some traveling salesman who try to sell him a crow. dusk fails his checks, and becomes convinced that this crow is a super intelligent one of a kind animal, and pays 200 gold pieces for it. Sporting his new shoulder candy, he enters a shop and decides he wants it. It's at this point his luck turns around, and he then falls in love with the shop keeper's daughter.  Using his crow as aide, he begins burglarizing every single shop in the district. He spectacularly passes his checks, and manages to steal several thousand gp worth of items from everyone. Then, through some absolutely ridiculous story, bluffs hard enough to convince the entire town that the perpetrator is the owner of the shop. The silver tongued shade then convinces the daughter that he needs some super nerotoxic poison ""for, uh, you know, the rats"", and passes his bluff check to convince the daughter to poison her own father. He consoles her, then she marries him (in a surprisingly innocent and meaningful relationship) and gives him control of the shop. The whole town loves him now and he's super rich.He meets some people from the black brotherhood, who take out a contract with him to kill Bayne.
* other members do general rp stuff like buying armor upgrades, an axe, etc.


I probably left out a crapload of awesome stuff, but i can only be in one place at a time, sorry :( 

Group two consists of myself, the original DM, Throzgar, and Tabu.
We start off in the original district. 

**Tabu:**

Tabu awakens first. He greets the stable girl and heads to the mage shop. The mage has slightly less distates for him, since he isn't a half breed. Tabu notices some mage robes, and summons his half conscience to help him decide what to get. He goes with red, and inquires about the price. The owner demands 500gp, which Tabu timidly replies to with an offer of some kind of compromise. A few minutes later, he and his mini-me are in a cellar peeling 7000 carrots for two hours. Upon completion, he purchases the robe for 50 gp and leaves.

**throzgar:**
Throzgar wakes up to find his matron missing. He heads down stairs and notices Franz, the bodyguard, is extremely sullen. Utilizing plenty of ""BRO""s, he works out that Franz is upset because the Matron left with a shady figure and ordered Franz not to follow, and he is now worried. Apparently, they were headed to the Galley.

**Comrade:**

Comrade awakes from his drunken stupor and realizes he's lost his goblin. ""well shit, guess i best go find him"". But first he heads to the bar. A quick conversation with the barkeep leads to the purchasing of two flasks. One is a simple flask filled with vodka, the other is an empty one, marked with a magic blue X detectable only to Spetrovi. This flask is lined with a chemical that causes whoever drinks from it to become unconscious rather quickly. He thanks the barkeep and heads to the alchemist's to try and get some info.

Upon entering the Alchemists, he notices that the layout of the shop has changed. No longer is it dirty and dank, but neat, and organized. Most noteable, The walls are now lined with bright pink potions in shiny bottles, and on the main wall hangs a massive portrait of a certain familiar Human Swordsman wearing nothing but a loin cloth. Glorious. He snags a black potion, which his magic senses tell him is deadly, and tries to open the door to the back. To his surprise, he is met with a magical barrier.  A quick arc lightning and magic missile drop the barrier, and spetrovi proceeds reluctantly down the long staircase.

Upon reaching the bottom, he notices the room is covered in black soot, and is lit solely by some bioluminescent jars. At the foot of the landing, Bengal is on all fours, panting. ""Oh noh, eet's you again. Where ees thee small one who works here?"" Bengal replies in a strange voice, and a noticible twitch reveals to spetrovi that Ziggs has possessed bengal's body. he tries to get information out of it, but zingal isn't budging. Spetrovi offers him some of the drink out of the magic flask, and he quickly collapses. ""Weel shit, whut now..."" He decides to deal with the problem later, and ties him up with every bondage device he can find, then reseals the door and leaves.

**cut back to throzgar**

Franz begins crying at this stage, and feels helpless. But Throzgar is having none of it, and riles him up. Finally, he looks the giant in the eye and tells him ""I need your help, let's do it."" 

As soon as the words leave Throzgar's mouth, Franz sprints off at full tilt, obliterating the Brothel door on his way out, and tears across the city square in the direction of Galley. Tabu sees this, and follows after the two giants. Spetrovi emerges from the alchemist's, notices the runners, and dejectedly announces that ""i guess will be getting my exercise for thee day."" and pursues them.

We had been at it for an hour or so without issue after we (I, really) took out the bandit camp near Riga.
 

Weird stuff happens down here and I Do. Not. Like. It. Early on, I was inspecting a dark corner looking to scrounge for supplies, when I suddenly heard a child screaming. These tunnels were dead, and there were no children, but nevertheless the wailing consumed me. I froze and my skin felt electrified. When it stopped, I turned to look at my friend to see if he was ok, hoping that he would be as unnerved as I was, but he was moving away down the tunnel as if nothing had happened. I kept my mouth shut. Why spook him?
 

The mutants are a problem. They make their presence known, which is a mercy, but once they do they are on top of you in an instant, and often in packs. My double barreled shotgun can't keep up with the pace of their attacks. Bourbon (that's my friend's name...) seems to be fine literally wrestling with the damn things, though.

 
The one time I thought we were in a safe place, I was scrounging a bunch of dead bodies for ammo while Bourbon addressed a gate that would lead us out. The fact that there were six or seven dead bodies in one spot, all with plenty of ammo, didn't stand out to me for some reason. The next thing I knew, I was emerging from lightheadedness in a cramped tunnel, with Bourbon fifteen feet ahead of me, trying to open the same gate, but now the whole area was bathed in light from beyond the door. It was as if the gates were the gates to heaven, and beautiful blue and white light shone from beyond it. But this was no pearly gate, and Bourbon started to yell and fall to his knees, still grasping the big wheel that would open the gate.
 

And then I was back in the room with the dead bodies. Bourbon was at the gate, quiet. I moved toward it, and suddenly we were in the shining tunnel again. Now the door was open, and the intensity of the light was matched only by what felt like wind coming from beyond it. I couldn't tell if it was wind or just a force, but it was pushing me back towards the room we were in, towards the bodies. We needed to get through the gate, but Bourbon was on his knees, yelling at someone or something, ""Come to me and I will sing your song forever!"" I grabbed at him, and tried to pull him in to the light, but I wasn't strong enough to stay on my feet. Like him, I dropped to a knee, and I looked forward frantically, hoping that looking towards the light would be enough to get us there.
 

And then something reached towards me from outside my field of vision. It was a silhouette, and huge. I saw a three fingered hand. It grabbed me and pulled. I fell forward on my face, pulling Bourbon with me, and suddenly it was quiet again. We were in the next room, just a few feet from the gate. The light was gone, replaced by the damn dark hell as before. Bourbon recovered slowly, wondering aloud about what he had been saying and why. As is often the case, we didn't talk about it. We gathered ourselves and moved on.
 

After making our way through a number of giant tunnels and catwalks, we came across a small outpost that was secured behind what looked like a bank vault door. Our ammo was nearly gone and my gas mask was cracked from mutants going for my eyes. After a brief security check, we were allowed in to the outpost. It was a ragtag shantytown much like all the others. All the signs of human desperation you would expect were on display: tiny shacks, rats being cooked on hastily assembled spits, gangs and thugs watching you, and the ubiquitous bar flies retelling their stories of survival on the surface.
 

After stocking up on air filters per my buddy's request, we got ready to leave the outpost from the only way out other than the way we came in. When the officer in charge of the door announced that it would be opening, the soldiers stationed there tensed and complained loudly. It seemed that just opening the door to let the two of us out was enough to make them fear for their lives. The heavy, metal door slid open just enough for us to squeeze through, and we walked past the large caliber HMG that was bolted to the ground just inside the door. As the door closed, we heard some people calling my buddy's name in anger, screaming about unpaid debts. Looking back, they were running for the door, but it was already closing.

 
Bourbon looked at me, and with fear in his voice he instructed me to get moving. We walked up the escalator in to what was clearly a blown out, surface level metro station. We found a few dead explorers and stripped them of whatever useful items they had. There's nothing like metro-made shotgun shells to make you feel warm and fuzzy in the cold sunlight.
 

We made our way out of the building, gas masks on at this point, and had to immediately hide from a Demon flying through the air. That's what Bourbon called it, at least. It looked like a gargoyle you might see perched on any old building, but huge, and decidedly louder. After a few moments of hiding behind the closest pillar I could scramble to, it flew off.
 

We moved out, but when I tried to jump from one ledge to another, the car I was jumping from slipped, and I crashed to the ground far below where Bourbon had jumped to. He yelled at me to get moving and meet him a ways away. ""Stay away from the water."" he added.
 

I spent the next hour wandering the abandoned Moscow neighborhood alone. It was all a blur; how many gray, blown out buildings can you remember, really? The mutants stalked me, but the five-round Shotgun I bought in the last town proved to be quite capable.

 
I often felt like I was being watched, and I found that being quiet and careful was the safest way to go. Problem is, these damn air filters don't last long. I check my watch often. Sometimes only ten seconds pass before I check it again. I took this as a sign that I was becoming too stressed, so I forced myself to calm down.
 

At one point, I came across a playground. It reminded me of the playground in the American classic movie Terminator 2 a little too much. The children I was watching play in front of me were so happy, and all the jungle gyms and playground pieces were so brightly colored. I hadn't seen colors like that my whole life. It was perfect. 

 
I remember that my vision blurred for a moment, so I tried to blink my eyes back to clarity. When I looked again, the children were gone. The playground was just as gray and dead as everything else. One of the three-fingered creatures was staring at me from on top of an overturned bus just beyond the playground. As I moved forward, it ran off. I heard voices in my head, but I couldn't make them out. I don't know why I didn't shoot it. I should have, instinctively. It just didn't seem malevolent. Maybe it was curious. Whatever the case, I got the sense it was there for a reason.
 

I moved on. Hopefully I find Bourbon soon. I hear his gunfire from time to time. At least, I hope it's his.",Video Game,False,self,t5_2wqgc,1368811673.0,video,,True,t3_1ej0zd,http://www.reddit.com/r/gametales/comments/1ej0zd/metro_2033_dear_diary_5172033_we_left_home/,

**TO APPLY LINK FLAIR**

**Once you have posted, look out for the tiny row of grey words - Flair should be the last on on the right. If it isn't showing up - let me know!**

I set this up party because I'm so pleased we've managed to get an almost 50/50 split between traditional D&amp;D-type RPGs and video game stories - I'm really happy we've managed to keep up a mix of genres and not get dominated by one scene.

But also, by adding the option of a TALK flag, I hope it will encourage people to contribute to discussion on this subreddit. Now we can hopefully talk about related issues as a community, and people here purely for the stories can easily ignore any socialising if they want to.

However, I'm interested in opinions on the Tabletop / Video categorisation of posts. For example you could easily argue that Dwarf Fortress is closer to D&amp;D than it is to DayZ. But then I'd say that no system is perfect, and at least the video/tabletop split gives you a general idea of the style of tale you'll be reading - A rigid set rules with a twist in Video, and a free-flowing story and creative problem solving in Tabletop.

I've also categorised the very few LARP stories as tabletop - I can easily create a new flair if opinion on that is strong.

1364735926.0,14,self.gametales,1bcu80,Tales from Dark Heresy.,15,1,2,http://www.reddit.com/r/gametales/comments/1bcu80/tales_from_dark_heresy/,"These stories are from my games of Dark Heresy, along with /u/demanrisu, and our GM, /u/Mad_Dogg_Pezza. I play a Moritat Assassin. For those of you who don't know what that means, it means I am a member of a special order of assassins that only use bladed weapons. No guns.

Story 1. I got exploded.

We had tracked down a cult to their headquarters in a warehouse. After cutting our way through the guards we found the ""boss fight"" in the basement, frantically chanting (if I were to partake in Metagame, I'd say he was summoning a Daemon). 

I charged him and succeeded in doing some decent damage. The Heretic's turn. He draws a flame pistol and fires it at me. It does a little damage. Tech Priest's turn. He aims and fires his Laspistol at the heretic, hits him in the arm holding the pistol, and sends him into critical damage. After consulting the Critical Damage table, the GM announces that the arm has caught fire. Including the gun. It explodes. I had to burn a fate point* to stay alive. I still got knocked across the room by the explosion and hit the wall, knocking me unconscious. This is why I hate las weapons.

Story 2. Meatpaste.

In our next campaign we are tracking down hereteks (Heretics of the Machine Cult). We are walking down a long, narrow corridor, and our shotgun toting cleric is taking point. A single, poorly armed and armoured heretek jumps out from behind a pillar, so the cleric blasts him. He rolls so well on the damage, that the GM declares him ""Meatpaste"". Demanrisu, in his infinite wisdom, saw fit to fill his pockets with said paste.

Later, we were fighting a pair of highly skilled assassins. One armed with a sword, another with a gun. The sword one was running at us extremely quickly. About as fast as I can move now, 3 levels later. Deman's turn. In desperation, he throws the meatpaste at the assassin's face (Called Shot). GM rolls it. Success. He succeeds so well that the Assassin is knocked the ground and blinded. I decapitated him.

Next turn rotation, Deman throws his other pocket of meatpaste at the other assassin. Hits him in the face again. Not as good as last time, so he is only temporarily blinded. It is enough. Since then, we are sure to carry meatpaste on us at all times.

Story 3. Planetkiller.

At the climax of the Heretek Campaign we were in space, because it's the best place to end any story. After defeating the boss, we were left on a Space Station, pretty much alone. Our Tech-Priest hacks into the main administrator terminal, deciding how to deal with the problem.

The suggested solutions were:

* Increase power to the orbital thrusters to send it hurtling into space.
* Turn off life support so the Imperium can reclaim it.
* Turn off the orbital thrusters to send it hurtling into the planet below.

The Tech-Priest, being the only one able to use the computer, opted for the latter. He killed billions of people. Of his own people. It was a forge world occupied by the Ordo Mechanicus. For that, he was exiled from his own cult.

Story 4. Heist Prep failure.

The next campaign was (supposed to be) an Ocean's 11 style heist. We arrived on a tribal (think Mesoamerica, Aztecs) world, with instructions to find Augustus Blood, our contact. We go to a nearby village to ask for directions. To prove our worthiness, we must prove our honour. I decide to do this by fighting in THE PIT.

Their champion faces me in honourable combat, however, being the dishonourable cheat I am, I had the company Psyker help me from the sidelines, by forging the opponent to spasm and suffer pain. In the end, I won, becoming the new Tribal Champion. I received a suit of full metal armour, and a powerful two handed sword, and my duties include leading the tribe to battle. Cool.

So we travel to Blood's base, an old, trap filled temple. After navigating (somewhat unsuccessfully) the trapped hallways, we found a room containing a giant lizard. After NOPE'ing right out of there, we find a room with a giant vat of poison bolted to the floor in the middle. I unscrewed it from the ground, and the Tech-Priest and Hulk-esque guardsman, picked it up, carried to the lizard room, and poured it in. After waiting a little while, we hear a loud thud, satisfied, we search the room. Nothing of value. Oh well.

We find Blood, and he reveals his grand plan for breaking into the vault where the target is being held. He has manipulated the tribals into following their Champion into combat (dammit), using poison tipped weapons (DAMMIT), riding atop trained lizards, of which he just finished training the prototype (welp, game over.)

Story 5: http://www.reddit.com/r/gametales/comments/1bax73/is_there_gay_marriage_in_this_kingdom/c95oqe7

*Fate Points

Burning a fate point is a very serious thing. It allows you to succeed on any roll, or saves you from certain death. However, they are a very hard to get resource. You start off with 2 or 3, and can only get more by accomplishing ""impossible"" acts, like single handedly holding a fortress, or slaying a great daemon.

1364549854.0,14,self.gametales,1b8fuc,"Tales of Halo 2, Part 1.",19,5,2,http://www.reddit.com/r/gametales/comments/1b8fuc/tales_of_halo_2_part_1/,"I have a few of these I can share from the old memory vault. If the reception is good I'll continue of course.


Firstly the map we were playing on for this particular story was Waterworks. The players in best to worst skill level were myself, Jacob, Justin, Randall, and Rick. The game variant was CTF, a special house rule of no using vehicles for flag carries. This is important, because we ignored this rule, no one minded due to the insanity that followed.


The teams are myself and Justin vs Jacob, Randall, and Rick. We end up behind 1-2, with it being our turn to capture. The game has been slowly slipping away from us as the timer ticks away. At last we're down to our last minute when our previous assault ended up in failure. With the seconds ticking down I respawn in base, running out and hopping in the warthog driver's seat. Justin sees this and hops in the turret to provide a fair amount of cover fire in case their are snipers atop their base. We drive for one last heroic effort, the sound of the engine was heard by all in the room. The snipes came in from the sniper spawn location from Jacob, no surprise. We manage to get to the base with no damage thanks to Justin's suppressing return fire. I immediately hop out of the driver's side after peeling it out right into their front entrance. I clutch my Shotgun, which I'm aware everyone starts with, along with the Battle Rifle. I toss in a frag grenade to create a smokescreen as I check the immediate corner to my right. Nothing. I continue sidestepping into the second corner, facing the flag's location. Immediately Rick comes at my with a shotgun, he fires and misses, I return fire, one shot kill. Farther away Randall fires as he charges at me from the edge of the ramp. He manages to graze, nearly taking out all my shields. Justin has yet to appear inside to assist. He was keeping Jacob occupied for those few crucial moments I needed. However it wasn't enough and soon I was dealing with Jacob falling from the roof's hole along with Randall on his last leg. Randall turns to retreat up the ramp, I throw a frag grenade and hope for the time needed to deal with Jacob. Right in my face he comes at me, with his own shotty. I strafe once more and manage to avoid the hit, but he counters and my own hit misses. I thrust forward with a melee and manage to kill him. The clock ticks down to less then ten seconds. Randall suddenly meets Jacob's fate from the blindly thrown grenade connection causing a barrel overload I assume. Here I am, all three at my feet.


I don't take a moment to savor the small victory. I clutch the flag, the thought occurs to me Justin is no where to be seen. I head over to the front entrance. justin awaits me in the driver's seat, the passengers perfectly aligned for a clean getaway. Our wheels peel off as Rick has respawned, desperately trying to catch us with one of his two frags. We escape.


""GOGOGOGOGOG!"" I scream as we head out, the enemy base shrinking too slow. Justin's driving skills are not what I would call reliable, so I premptively try to avoid a situation. ""Take the long way take the long way!"" My screams go unheard, the sound of our enemies shouting just feet away is nothing but background noise. Justin veers left, heading for the center complex. Adrenaline from excitement quickly amps up one more level with a cold terror. ""Don't GO ON THE BRIDGE."" I shout it two more times. ""DON'T GO ON THE BRIDGE, DON""T GO ON THE BRIDGE."" We continue towards a teenage stress induced heart attack.


As we rise to the small mound proceeding the bridge Justin makes a 90 degree turn to avoid the bridge. At this point, I compensate in an attempt to prevent a complete failure. ""NONONO, STAY ON THE BRIDGE! GO STAY ON THE BRIDGE!"" An inch at a time we begin our slide onto the bridge. ""DON'T FALL OFF!"" I scream as Justin cranks the wheels back to the left, another 90 degrees. Right at the ledge.


All hope is lost, our front tires kicking up the dust clinging to the corner lip on the bridge, the chasm waiting below to swallow up any chance of victory. I leap from the death machine, the travel on foot should be safe, if I can just make it out. I think for a moment I might just do it. My feet touch down, it's solid... NO! I missed it by mere pixels! As I fall in disbelief I throw the flag, for it shall not meet us in this pit of doom. I look up at it firmly planting itself on the bridge.


But wait... we have 15 seconds... 10 seconds as the black screen and respawn timer eats away at my hopes. 5 seconds I plant myself in our Ghost... Round Over.


I sit there, without even the energy to scowl at Justin. He's shaking, babbling incoherently at his complete failure. Jacob and Randall's howling laughter coming into focus.


That day I made a promise to avoid teaming up with Justin, a promise that lasted over 3 months. it wouldn't have caused such a disdain for my best friend's 'skills' if not for the soon to be created profile character name. A Left Turn.


I may not have won many games vs A Left Turn, but that was never due to lack of skill. It was due to blinding vengeance where seeking him out every moment of any game variation led to defeat.

**(ending of Part 2, Chapter 3, which was cut off by the character limit)**

It was a good enough stopping point as any, especially since Kyle had to go out that evening and said he would need an hour or so to get ready. As we quit out, Greg and Andrew commended Aaron on the traps and the design, and asked how he managed to do it. Aaron explained that he was at Mark's house - that's why Mark hadn't said a word, both of their mics were muted so we wouldn't hear anything to give them away - and he was following in a room he had constructed above them, where he had created everything from the drop-walls to the lava trap that we unfortunately never got to see. I felt a bit left out, I was trapped in my prison cell the whole time!

Mark offered to unban Andrew now that the game was finished, so we could continue the mission we had originally set. But Aaron interjected before Andrew could say anything.

""What do you mean, finished? They haven't seen the final boss battle yet!""

The stage was set for one final showdown now, one final weekend. Aaron, Mark and Andrew would have full reign over the server for the next week to set up the final encounter, and Greg, Kyle and I were excited to see what they would come up with.

###Part 3: The Final Showdown

The week crawled along as Kyle, Greg and I questioned just what Aaron had planned for the climactic final showdown. What would our arena look like? What traps would Aaron set for us? Did we even have a chance to survive, with barely any food left and a hodgepodge of worn down and weak weapons? Neither Andrew nor Mark, who were helping Aaron set up the final battle, offered much information in our email correspondences, just leaving us with lines like ""You'll see"" and ""Trust me, it's worth it.""

Saturday finally came and I chose not to go to the Mets game with my family that day - Minecraft was more important. At noon exactly, Mark sent out the Skype call to the entire party, and it was clear when he picked up that Aaron and Andrew were both over at his house. They would be coordinating this battle together.

We logged in to the server and immediately noted that our way was blocked on all sides by a gravel wall that was at least 10 blocks high. Aaron typed in chat ""Are you ready to face your death?"" We equipped our weapons, steeled our nerves, and gave our answer. We were ready (and just the slightest bit giddy and excited and stuff...).

We heard the sound of pistons, and the gravel wall in front of us fell away into the depths beneath us, stopping with the top level of blocks perfectly at ground level. For a moment after we stood motionless, trying to take in our surroundings. We were still in the giant cavern we had escaped into last week, but there was something different about it now. 

The waterfalls that had interspersed the lava flows along the walls were gone, and now lava flowed down uniformly around the edges of the cavern, creating great pillars of death that disappeared into some unfathomable abyss below. The entire cavern had been closed off with the exception of a small door against the opposite wall, far away from us, adorned on either side by torches. the floor was bare and level, except for a two-block wide ring depressed in the floor that surrounded a square in the center of the cavern that was maybe 10 blocks around.

Tentatively, I took a step forward, Greg and Kyle following me on either side. *Come on out, Aaron you bastard.* Almost on cue, the iron door on the other side of the room swung open, and Aaron stepped through, clad from head to toe in golden armor and wielding a diamond sword. He walked confidently toward us and as he moved away from the back wall, lava began to flow freely down it, covering everything but the door in red death and giving the traitor an evil red glow as he continued forward without so much as a flinch.

In a show of confidence or foolishness, I walked forward to match his pace, slowly making my way to the center arena. I could hear Greg and Kyle starting after me slowly, more cautiously. We reached the arena first, noting that the depressed ring of blocks was gravel. We knew what was going to happen.

Aaron stood outside of the ring, staring at us. ""You'll never escape"" he said, the cockiness in his voice almost irritating. He stepped into the depression, on a two-block wide path of cobblestone, as the gravel ring fell away into the nothingness below. Only a small bridge on the other side remained. Our only escape. And Aaron stood guarding it.

I charged forward hoping to catch Aaron by surprised, and managed to get in a quick hit, simultaneously knocking him back onto his bridge, but receiving two hefty slashes from his Diamond Sword in return. I was forced to quickly retreat and eat my first of three loaves of bread as Greg and Kyle ran up to fight as well. Each of them had an iron sword, and would be able to do much more damage than I could. Together they held the edge of the arena, trying to keep Aaron pinned down while dodging back from his attacks.

Kyle managed a lucky strike on Aaron as he lunged toward Greg, but Greg found himself injured by the incredibly powerful diamond blade and forced to back away while I took his place. As I saw the traitor pull out a loaf of bread to replenish his health I saw my chance and lunged forward again - straight into his trap. Aaron switched back to his sword and slashed me twice before I could escape, and I ran back to the other side of the room, eating my remaining loaves of bread and recovering from the grievous wounds I had received. Kyle again managed a hit on Aaron, but took a slash from him in return, forcing him back to heal up.

Aaron hopped back onto the arena, laughing and swinging his sword wildly around in front of him. He had taken three strikes from our weapons and seemed like he had barely been scratched. Of course, the gold armor wasn't nearly as effective as Iron or Diamond would have been, but he didn't care. He turned his sights on me and ran headlong toward me, and I couldn't run away fast enough. His blade smashed into me hard enough to send me flying backward and down into the deep pit surrounding the arena. I knew I was dead. I could only hope Aaron didn't prevail!

Greg and Kyle grouped up again as they watched me disappear over the edge, standing in grim silence as Aaron cackled and turned toward them, casually eating some bread to replenish his health back to full. ""Who's next?"" he asked, the cockiness in his voice growing as the miner and captain stood quietly, swords raised together against him.

In a move of confidence, Aaron took off his golden helmet and threw it into the abyss where my lifeless body lay, before turning back to the remaining party members and waving his sword. He walked forward slowly, still waving his sword and laughing at his adversaries, as more lava began to stream down the walls around the cavern. This time, though, it didn't disappear beyond the walls - it filled the cavern floor, slowly creeping toward the arena from the side we had escaped the maze of death, threatening to flood the entire place.

Greg and Kyle realized they needed to kill Aaron, and quickly, before their only escape was covered in the red death of the lava. Unless...

""Run for it!"" Greg yelled, realizing he and Kyle stood closer to the bridge than Aaron did. Together they sprinted to the other side, Aaron hot on their tails as they tried to escape to the only exit - the iron door that Aaron had come through. But as they ran, scanning the wall and floor around the door for some way to open it, they realized there was nothing there. No way to escape.

Now backed up to the door with lava streaming down from the ceiling in multiple places and covering the floor in death, they watched as Aaron slowly walked toward them. They were trapped in one final hole by the madman who had caused all of this death and destruction.

Greg stood grimly, watching their death slowly approach, as Kyle grew angry beside him. He would not die like this! No! In one final burst of anger and strength, Kyle sprinted forward and smashed his sword against the scarred gold armor. Aaron laughed as he watched the pitiful and futile display, but as he was knocked back by the force of the strike he realized his fatal mistake. He landed in a puddle of molten lava, too stunned to react. And with one final, agonizing scream of pain, he was swallowed up by the glowing death he had created.

Kyle and Greg watched with morbid satisfaction as Aaron's body burned in the lava, and stood together on the raised platform in front of the door, watching the lava bubble and swirl around the cavern, leaving only them and the arena in the center uncovered. Andrew and I had fallen victim to the demonic machinations of the traitor, and Mark was nowhere to be found. Their expedition had turned into a twisted game of survival, and there would be no reward for winning.

Suddenly, behind them, the iron door swung open. Greg turned and stared into the hallway beyond it, and then to Kyle. Together. They would go forward together.

As they walked inside, the iron door closed tight behind them, sealing the cavern of death away forever. The hallway was long, extending straight farther than the eye could see. Together, Kyle and Greg walked, their footsteps echoing through the emptiness of the stone walls, neither one in the mood to speak.

What seemed like an eternity later, Greg finally began to make out something in the distance. Some kind of light. As they continued walking, they could see a wooden door, with blue sky streaming through the window. The two survivors sprinted forward, toward the first sky they had seen in days. Kyle threw open the door, and together they stepped out into the world.

###Epilogue

After the epic end to the story, we realized we couldn't just pick up where we left off. We all left the server and, in a unanimous decision, deleted the world forever.

The six of us played together for a few more months before slowly starting to drift away from Minecraft and on to other games (most notably League of Legends and eventually Diablo 3 as well). We had other great worlds and stories, but none like this. He did, at least, teach us the basics of redstone after it was all over (no, none of us really knew how to use that stuff before this). Writing this made me remember why I used to love Minecraft so much though, and I just might go back and play it again now.

So he spawns in around Cherno and we meet up with him to head up to Stary Sobor for some gear. On the way we see a crashed chopper and Ash gets a Bizon 9mm (For those that don't know it has a very fast fire rate), me and Tim have an M14 and a M16 respectively. 

We get to Stary at night and loot most of the tents there by torch light with no problem, we pick up a few bits but nothing huge. We are in the last two tents when BANG; a bullet flies out of no where and pegs me in the chest. So Tim runs over and bandages me, we are all shouting at Ash to cover Tim and he is just yelling **""WHAT IS GOING ON?""** over and over with a little bit of **""MY GUN ISN'T FIRING!""** thrown in there, he was holding the torch. By this point I'm on about half health.

(Quick diagram of the situation http://gyazo.com/b7fb76573e5be5020356dc714dc8ffb8
we are inside that big tent watching up the slope for a light to appear)

So Tim suggests that we make a break for one of the houses in Stary for better cover, and seeing as I have an M14 which isn't really suited to indoor combat I should take position outside and watch for any people coming in. We agree on this, but there is one problem; as I'm sure the DayZ players here know, night-time = literally 0 light, so the only way we could get to a house is if we throw a flare or use our torches, but then possibly get picked off by the shooter on the slope. 

We decide to risk it and I throw a flare out towards the town; almost immediately shots start to ping past our heads and we charge towards the nearest house. Me and Tim burst through the door, yelling to each other where we think this guy is and whether any zombies are on us. We realise Ash is not with us and as I'm about to ask him where he is I realise that the entire time he has been yelling **""WHY IS MY GUY SO SLO-OH MY GOD I'M WALKING HOW DO I RUN HOW DO I RUN HOW DO I RUN...""**. At this point me and Tim are too busy laughing and Ash fucking strolls through gun fire and zombies to the house we are in.

But that isn't the end of this encounter yet, so I head out the back door, flare in the general direction of the shots and set up on the other side of the road to wait. After the guy fires a few shots near the house we see him pop up on side chat (global chat) **""Guys in the house in Stary, we are coming for you.""**, so we know there are a few of them at least and Tim, being the asshole that he is, begins to taunt them over global chat.

After a few minutes of back and forth on global chat, we start to wonder if they are even coming or whether they have moved on and left us with our guns pointed at a hill. I carry on looking at the lit area and glancing over at the chat box every so often, when suddenly something catches my eye. One of our attackers just wrote the message **""Hi""** in chat but it wasn't global, it was proximity/direct. Just as I feel the sudden panic manifest itself I hear a loud bang and I go unconscious. I tell Tim and Ash I'm going to bleed out soon and Tim realises we are pretty outclassed, what with a completely new player on our team. So he says **""Right, fuck this I'm going out with a bang."".** Me and Ash ask him what the hell he is talking about when he does it...

**""WHAT IS LOVE...BABY DON'T HURT ME. DON'T HURT ME. NO MORE.""**

He had one of those virtual microphones on his computer and was using it to play Haddaway down his mic on GLOBAL chat. Now this was a fairly populated server, around 30 people, and it was being spammed with 90's eurodance. Tim continues taunting via text while we laugh uncontrollably. 

Suddenly 2 guys burst through the back door (This is what Tim had told me because at this point I was pretty much dead), and start to shoot at Ash and Tim. Tim takes out 1 with his M16 and runs away from the other to reload, and Ashley. Oh my god. In between bursts of laughter from the song he is screaming as he (while still walking, of course) pelts the walls, ceiling, floor, TIM and pretty much anything that isn't hostile with his ridiculous gun. Luckily he and Tim tag the last guy enough to finish him. Ash eventually yells **""I'M OUT OH GOD *shaky breath and half cough half laugh* I CAN'T BREAT- *continues laughing*.""** Tim begins to bleed out from all the gunfire and eventually dies while yelling at Ash to heal him, but he still chuckling to himself. Ash ~~runs~~ walks off into the night as the only survivor, but not before typing in global **""Baby, I hurt you.""**.

I carefully approach a barn where I had found some good loot previously.  I'm careful to check the area from the tree line before going out in the open.  I carefully make my way to the barn without alerting any zombies.

I'm inside looting stuff, always being careful not to make too much noise.  Then I hear gun shots.  ""Oh shit.  I wonder how close that was.""  While I'm contemplating whether to stay inside the barn, or take the risk of making a run for it and alerting the zombies outside, a guy runs into the barn with several zombies behind him.

""Friendly!  Don't shoot!"" he says.  I immediately regret not having my mic on.  I tried to type ""friendly"" to him, but I don't think he really noticed.  So there's this well equipped stranger in the barn with me, that could potentially shoot me at any second, and there are several zombies entering the barn.  From previous experience I know shooting the zombies is going to bring more zombies.

The uncertainty of the situation was too much, so I said ""fuck it"", and I ran.  Let that asshole deal with his zombie situation, I'm out of here.  So I sprinted out of the door, realizing I'd probably attract a few zombies, but that was preferable to this.

""Don't you run from me!""

Oh shit.

The guy starts shooting me in the back.  I zig zag, trying to be a hard target, but I'm still taking damage, and in this game, it doesn't take much to die.  So I spin around and start firing back.  At this point, my nerves are on edge, the adrenaline is pumping, and my aim is not that great.

But my return fire is enough to make him hit the deck.  I'm not sure at this point if I killed him, wounded him, or he is just taking cover.  But I use the opportunity to continue sprinting for the trees.  I figured, at the very least, I've bought some time while he has to stand up again before chasing me.

I make it to the trees, and I change direction to try and throw him off.  I don't hear him, and I don't hear gun shots, but I'm still bleeding out pretty fast and there are still zombies behind me.  When I think I've lost the stranger, I decide to make my stand against the zombies.  I need to bandage soon or I'll bleed out, and there's no way I can outrun the zombies in that time.

1 dead zombie

2 dead zombies

Start to bandage...
in the process of bandaging...
a third zombie comes running in..
no time to finish bandaging...

3 dead zombies.

and then I go unconscious.

bleeding...  bleeding...

Then, alone in the woods, staring up at the trees, so close to making it out alive... I die...

The amount of adrenaline pumping through me during that exchange was crazy.",Video,False,self,t5_2wqgc,False,video,,True,t3_1b1lbz,http://www.reddit.com/r/gametales/comments/1b1lbz/bleeding_to_death_in_the_woods_dayz/,

So a couple years ago I was part of a group playing the Serenity rpg. I had created my character as a kick-ass captain with unworldly pistol skills. The other characters included a supernaturally gifted insane martial artist, a medic, a pilot and a cook. 

Soon afterward this a ship full of criminals tried to attack us. As we had next to no ship-ship weapons, the medic, the martial artist and myself decided to board the enemy ship. The martial artist's player decided, being committed to proving his character was insane, to do a space jump to the other ship, similar to the latest Star Trek. Somehow he managed it and got aboard. In the meantime, our pilot pulled off some good maneuvers to get us to a less suicidal means of boarding the enemy ship by docking with it. The medic and I quickly boarded the enemy ship, leaving the pilot in control of my ship, and with the martial artist's help, quickly neutralized the entire enemy crew with little to no damage taken. 

Unfortunately, it turns out that I should NOT have left the pilot on board our own ship. Much to my dismay, the pilot and the cook had decided that they didn't like having me in charge and that they were in a perfect position to change that. While there were still a few remaining bad guys on the enemy ship, the pilot and cook took command of my ship and took off, telling the rest of us through our communicators. Everyone else was dumbfounded by this and I swore to hunt them down as soon as we could get the enemy ship running. 

If you were hoping to hear how I got my revenge, prepare to be disappointed. Due to the split in the party it became too difficult for the GM to run a session and we decided to play something else. So in the end I never got my ship back and never got my revenge on my mutinous crew, though I did get to keep my new ship.

1367720069.0,11,self.gametales,1dpml2,[Battlefield 3] The Corner,18,7,3,http://www.reddit.com/r/gametales/comments/1dpml2/battlefield_3_the_corner/,"It was a bright day on the Sine. Last week, this place was bustling with business and children were playing on the street. Now the children are gone, replaced instead by bold young men digging into shops and the businesses now iridescent shattered skeletons of a once-happy neighborhood. It's funny, really, what difference a few men and about a thousand rounds of ammunition make.

As for me? Me and my crew were shipped in from another front to support the forward action. After that whole ""Operation Firestorm"" fiasco against the Americans, they should consider themselves lucky that any man serving under the banner of the Russian Motherland didn't lynch the commanders where they stood. I lost a few friends there - some to enemy fire but too many to friendly fire.

Me and my boy Berserker had been called in to support the French front. The American presence in there was heavy, but we found ourselves walking into a warzone (or, as Berserker liked to call it, ""Home Sweet Home""). I had met Berserker in basic - he was one of the best shots in the entire military (not that it's saying a lot. These days it felt like they were enlisting 14 year old kids to fly the choppers straight out of rudimentary school).

Berserker and I made a quick to-do of studying the map and looking over the current battle scenario. It was damned near another Firestorm fiasco again... Americans were flanking the hell out of all the positions and it looked damned near impossible for the forces to get anywhere. They had a tank set up on the main street, bombarding all advances up the Eastern Flank and they were hard-pressed down the middle.

I cocked my LMG, checking the rounds as Berserker cleaned his pistol.

""Looks like it's time to earn our bread and butter, eh?"" He joked. He was always the joker.

""If you think you can keep up, you Czech fuck."" I laughed, and we went into the fray.

As anyone who's seen a few battles will tell you, using the street is a horrible way to go. It's clear enough to be shot at, and covered enough to face complete annihilation at the hands of explosives or heavy fire (it tends to splash about. We stuck to the alleyways, making our way to Monument Square to support the faction there. It was a quick counter-attack - a short victory, to be sure, over an enemy who was currently more focused on attacking our little base than holding the nearby areas. They would roll through soon though, so Berserker and I left the damned kids tho their foolhearted fate and continued to press into enemy territory.

We soon found ourselves moving through an alleyway, trading gunfire with a band of Americans - but it was nothing supressive fire and a grenade couldn't handle - before we found ourselves sliding intop a building on the corner of one of the main streets. Berserker took his time planting a motion sensor at the bottom of the staircase as I moved up, pistol drawn, clicking my flashlight on and off every few seconds to hopefully blind an unwary enemy.

But, oddly enough, we found the building empty. We looked around the third floor, scouting out the windows for possible enemies when we both made an observation. Berserker, of course, vocalized his:

""Hey... We can cover the entire road from here."" He said, rather obviously. The building we were in we could see enemy formations moving about beneath us to their locations, and we had an excellent vantage point over this prime intersection coming straight from the enemy base.

""You know,"" I said, being the observant type as well, ""the second we start firing out of here, they'll be over us like gnats on a steak right?""

""You're sounding like a pussy right now,"" he joked, breaking out a window and placing his rifle on the ledge, checking the sights. ""Besides, when have you ever let the idea of death get in the way of living?""

""Cut the poetic bullshit,"" I said, unloading an ammo crate nearby where we both were. He popped up a radio beacon in the far corner of the empty room, signalling to the rest of the units where we were, and we settled in. He looked over the field, and I was beside him. The first shot was always the best - as Berserker put it - because the name of the game was to not get discovered for as long as possible. The less people shooting at you, the better, right?

""Back one. Enemy base."" I said. ""The sniper. We're better off without having someone who can drop us in one sh-"" I heard the quiet thump of a silenced rifle.

""Done."" He said, clicking his rifle back. ""One-Zero."" *Thunk* ""Sorry, Two-Zero.""

Through the barrel on my scope I could see them hustling about. IT took all about 5 seconds for them to begin firing at us. I breathed out, looking down my sight with my ACOG, and pulled the trigger. The familiar vibration of the rifle bracing my shoulder in steady beat. Ra-ta-ta-ta-ta-ta-ta-tat. ""Six."" I said.

""Eight. Get on my level."" He said. ""My apologies. Nine.""

""Bullshit,"" I said, lifting up my rifle and moving to the other ledge. I broke the window out, repositioning myself to overlook the other part of the intersection - a nice little Cul-de-sac with a staircase with plenty of enemy traffic running through it - and popped up my rifle, reloading. ""You haven't even pulled the trigger nine times."" I snapped the new set of rounds into the rifle, and pulled back the action.

*Thump!* ""I have now. Ten."" He laughed like an idiot.

""You're telling me that you killed two people with on-"" that's when I saw it whistling by my head, leaving it's gassy rocket trail. I didn't even have time to shout 'RPG!' It blasted between us, knocking me from my nice cozy position. Flipping out my trusty revolver, I put a few slugs downrange into the source of the attacker, ending his life in a few, quite loud THUDS.

""Berserker?!"" I said, reloading my revolver and rounding the corner. The rocket had blown off the upper section of the building. Gunfire rang out on our position, hitting the wall behind us. Berserker was crawling from a corner looking like a shit sandwich.

""Yeah, yeah,"" he said, slowly standing up, shaking off the dust from his uniform. ""Nice call, jackass. Do you hate losing THAT bad?""

""Fuck you, too,"" I said, laughing and looking over the side. ""Well, I think we have their attention. Got any more bright ideas?""

""Yeah. We kill them all. Problem solved, yeah?"" Berserker readied a grenade, tossing it out the window. There was shouting as we heard gunfire break for a few seconds as hey scrambled for cover - all we needed. I popped back up as fast as possible, laying down covery fire on their positions as Berserker popped back up and positioned himself on the ledge. One shot, two shot, three shot. Rat-ta-ta-ta-ta-ta-tat. The area around us was cleared faster than you could say ""Knife.""

I moved to reposition to my old spot, leaving my friend to his nice wide field of view. Me? I was happy to cover the tight walkway. I quickly checked my map, and from the way it looked je had managed to turn the tide of the fight somewhat. The seconds dragged on like hours in that Corner. Breakfast was served, and the dish was bullets.

""One hundred!"" I shouted, laughing... To no response.

""Berserker?"" I asked, glancing over. He was laying there, in front of a dead enemy, with his knife out. A set of dogtags in his hand. Looks like he'd won in the end after all... After a few solemn seconds, the shots began ringing out again as I checked over the side. They were swarming on my position, and they had pulled the tank around to provide heavier fire, which was ripping the building to shreds.

Out of ammo, worn from combat, I laid down my rifle and tossed out C4 off the side of the building. I sat beside my old friend, Knife out, waiting. One down, two down, three down. Pistol out, shots fired, Five down.

NEar death myself, I saw the tank pull up and lift it's guns to my position. I stood up, looked him dead in the eye.

""Goodbye.""

Click. Boom. No more tank.

And thus ended the battle... A sudden surge of relief went over me, seeing the enemies retreat into the distance.

1365851174.0,12,self.gametales,1c9ifb,[HL: Opposing Force] The Mundane Soldier in a Fantastic World,17,5,0,http://www.reddit.com/r/gametales/comments/1c9ifb/hl_opposing_force_the_mundane_soldier_in_a/,"This is something I wrote a couple of years ago, on how I was replaying the Opposing Force expansion for Half-Life. Even if it doesn't feature a strong narrative, like most of the stories on here, I still thought it would fit in, since it's a tale of a very unique game experience. Feel free to downvote it, if you disagree, of course. Unfortunately, I hadn't finished this run when I wrote this, and it's been too long since then for me to remember any details to finish the story. In any case, here goes:

I'm doing a run on hard, no saves (only using auto saves on death), no HUD, no crosshair, no armour, no night vision, and only a (human (no alien or experimental weapons)) primary weapon, a side arm, a melee weapon and explosives like grenades and satchels, in order to up the difficulty and increase my immersion. 

But since you can't actually drop weapons in this game, what I've been doing so far, is that whenever I want to exchange my primary weapon, for example, for a new one, I just bind 3 to a different primary weapon, but restricting myself from doing so, unless I actually come upon the weapon I am binding 3 to, in the game world. I will then allow myself to at a later time go back to the place where I changed binds, and then rebind the weapon I was carrying before, to 3.
It's not perfect, but it works.

Here's some details about my game.
I've bound the following keys.

1: Knife

2: Desert Eagle

3: Primary weapon (Mostly Shotgun, at least for the first large part of the game. Occasionally MP5/M4, either because of running out of ammo with my other weapon, or because of a situation where it fitted better as well as access to the grenade launcher. After mostly using the Shotgun for most of the game, I switched to the Sniper Rifle for a while, as it is seriously hard hitting - incidentally I adopted much more stealthy tactics then. After running dry on Sniper ammo, I had stocked up enough SAW ammo to make it worthwhile, so up until now the SAW has been my primary weapon, rather than just an occasional weapon - luckily there's alot more ammo for that weapon in this last part of the game.)

4: Grenade

5: Satchel

6: Tripmine

Other: I've used the barnacle, I think, two times in all. Both times it was required, with no other ways to continue. I did, however, manage to get past the gargantuan on the bridge, however, without using it. I waited for it to charge up it's stomp-attack, and ran past it then. I did get some burns, but I lived.

I used the noclip cheat in the beginning of the game in order to avoid picking up your PCV suit, which is normally required to advance. Without the suit I have no access to armour and thus I'm much more vulnerable to damage, and I have no access to night vision.

So far, I've gotten to chapter 11 ""The Package"", specifically I'm in map of6a2, which is the Black Ops mortar launcher area.

With no, armour, no HUD, no crosshair (which is independent from the rest of the HUD, but I have disabled it through the console), no nightvision (as it's tied to the PCV suit) on hard difficulty, and with a very limited arsenal, it's been tough so far. Another restriction is that I only use human, military weapons. So no alien or sci-fi guns for me. I've only loaded my autosaves upon death too, which has sometime forced me to accept grave losses of allies, ammo and health - I've been down to one health on several occasions.

With the limited weaponry, I have nearly run out of all ammunition more than once, being forced to use ineffective or waste overkill weaponry on enemies, such as shotgun at long range, or explosives/sniper bullets on enemies that were too dangerous in melee but still fairly weak.
I've also ended up stuck with a ""useless"" weapon several times, in that it had no ammo left, but I could not come across any replacements, due to fighting aliens in that area.

There have been some really tough fights, so far. Those invisible Female Assassins are particularly deadly. One of the hardest fights was some mere Black Ops and Female Assassins in the area guarding the tram.

The absolutely most impossible part I've been until now, was the Voltigore sewers. First off, Voltigores are extremely tough and hard hitting opponents, topped only by the gargantuan and maybe the chopper. Usually, they wouldn't be much trouble, but I was lacking the fire power to actually take them on. In each of the two parts of the sewer there were, I believe four Voltigores, as well as a bunch of Baby Voltigores. Even so, that was not the worst. The worst part of that area was that the whole mazy area was completely and utterly pitch black darkness, and I had no access to night vision.

In the first part of the sewers, I managed to lure the first Voltigore out, crawling back up on the latter where it couldn't hit me. Luckily I had the Sniper Rifle as my primary weapon at the time, and 4 or 5 shots obliterated it. The other three Voltigores in that sewer were avoidable.
Then came the middle part of the sewers, with the never-ending spawning of Pit Drones, so I had no time to rest. I had to rush into the second part of the sewers - and I tell you, I still can't believe I actually managed to get through that maze, filled with Voltigores, in pitch black darkness, with no night vision. I did that so many times, over and over again.

I finally learned to navigate by having my Desert Eagle out, and using the size of the laser dot to judge the distance to the wall, as well as learning the location of each Voltigore in the maze, and being able to navigate by them, when they would charge up their purple energy attack. Their attacks were clearly visible, but they did not illuminate. I felt a lot like learning by oneself to navigate by the stars, on the sea, in that I had to come up with a new method for navigation.

SAW ammo has become a lot more plentiful in this part of the game, and I have it on me most of the time as my primary weapon. It really helps a lot.
I have to make every shot count though. I can't spray. I need to head shot. I need to really take advantage of my environment. And I need to put my allies to the best use, using them as bait while I flank for example.

I have ascended once in Slashem before this (Cha-Fem-Dro-Wiz), but
what I really want to talk about is the time I ALMOST ascended...

This story has several titles, two of which appear in the subject line
of this post:
YAFAP, and a Story I Can Finally Tell
There IS Something Worse Than YASD

but the real title is:

Why I Can't Drink Scotch

This all happened about two years ago, and now that enough time has
passed and I actually did ascend, I think I can talk about it without
crying.

Misery was a Fem-Hum-Val, named after the Stephen King book I had just
finished reading.

My friends tried to warn me that this name was inauspicious, but I
held to the practice, common among poorer Muslims, of naming an
offspring after some terrible calamity (e.g. Marid = ""sickness""), in
the hopes of diverting that calamity.

So Misery was born.  Her childhood was uneventful, but when she was
13, she first encountered a priest of Odin.  This encounter would
change her life forever, in more ways than she knew.  She swore
allegiance to Odin, and one mornind, when she had learned something of
the ways of war, she received a visitation from her God, telling her
that she had been chosen to enter the Dungeons of Doom and win eternal
glory by liberating the ""oY.

Odin... not Tyr.

So she entered the Dungeon.  Her journey was long, and it all happened
several years ago, so I don't remember much in the way of details.  I
recall that she received Mjollnir early in her adventure, and
gauntlets of power shortly thereafter, so she was throwing that
mothafudga at every damn thing she saw.  Once she lost it in a moat,
stupidly trying to take out a giant eel, but after crying a bit I
realized that she could get it back...

Also, that was the game where I learned about never, NEVER putting a
/oC into a BoH... (since then, it seems every strong character I have
ever played has had to learn this lesson the hard way.  I can be
really stupid with the @ key sometimes.)

Anyway, Medusa, Surtur, and the rest went down like the little
beeyotches that they are.  Only big D put up a fight, but oh man! what
a fight!  Misery tried every damn cutesy-pie trick she could think of,
including but not limited to scrolls of earth, buttloads of acid
blobs, c eggs (missed about 6 times in a row!), charming legions of
monsters to fight him, etc.  Finally she blasted her last wish on a c
corpse.

And that's how Misery's uncursed +0 pickaxe became the uncursed +0
pickaxe named Demogorgonslayer.  (I know, it was really the c corpse
that defeated him, but what's the point of naming something that's
just gonna rot away?)  (Of course, I named it anyway... an uncursed
cockatrice corpse named Steve.)

So once my heart rate returned to normal, Misery plunged on, confident
now that NOTHING could prevent her from fulfilling her obligation and
winning eternal glory.

...

A little background:  I was underemployed, drinking a lot, and sharing
a one-bedroom apartment with four other guys.  We had no less than
four NH stations in the house (counting the 386 laptop my roommate
scored at a garage sale for $20), and five or six guys vying to be the
first to ascend.  I was not heavily favored.  My friends Eric
(estimated IQ: 200) and Jme (best time winning Axis &amp; Allies, playing
as Germany: about 30 minutes) had both gotten characters into Gehennon
while I was still quaffing from the Oracle's fountains.

This friendly rivalry could sometimes get meanspirited.  For a while,
instead of engraving Elbereth as a wand-tester, I took to engraving
""Eric will never find the Amulet!"" :)

So when Misery started to show real promise, the tension in the house
increased.  Eric and Jme started playing almost constantly (neither
had jobs), trying to catch up with me.  But Misery kept plumbing
deeper and kept filling out that Kit.  Even when I took a couple weeks
off (the further I got, the less I played, terrified of YASD), I
remained the front-runner.

Then, a fateful Friday.  It was my day off, and payday, and I
determined that I would ascend before nightfall.  This was gonna be
the big session, and afterward I fully intended to strut like I was
cock-of-the-walk.  I was gonna invite all my friends over to watch,
thinking it would be convenient to have everyone in the same room so I
could gloat most efficiently.  And, walking home from work with Jme, I
made the mistake which caused the other mistake which caused me to cry
like a teething infant for (literally) hours.

I stopped in to the liquor store and bought a handle of Clan
MacGregor's Scotch Whiskey.

...

So, anyway, when I typed in Misery that morning, I Restoring Saved
Gamed to the bottom level of Rodney's tower.

Oh, did I mention that Misery had long since passed 30th Xlevel, and
had... I don't know, probably 300 HP?  Also, AC was way below -30, I'm
sure, and Mjollnir was at least +6.  Could cast most spells with 0%
fail, wearing full armor.  I'm sure many of you have had 30th level
Valkyries before, and you don't need me to tell you that nothing in
Rodney's tower posed the slightest threat.

I whooped that Wizard so hard he cried, and I only had to kill him two
or three more times.  Although I know this sounds unlikely, I believe
that somehow Rodney had attained sentience (think Wintermute, only
crying and whining like a little beeyotch from the ferocity of the
beating Misery administered), and was simply too scared to keep
harassing me.

Moloch's Sanctum?  Pah!  More like Moloch's Spanked'em!

La de da, down the Tower, up through Gehennon, into the Valley, out of
the Castle, floating across Medusa's level (which, incidentally, was
swarming with about 50 gremlins... hehe), no time for you, Oracle!,
I've gotta get this Amulet to the Astral Plane!

By this time I had put away quite a bit of scotch, several of my
spectators had drifted away, and I was riding a curious wave of
intoxication, adrenaline, and mounting dread that I was gonna do
something really stupid and fudge it all up.

So I reached DL1...

Beware, there will be no return.  Still climb?

Uh oh... better check my inv...

Wait, where the hell is the ""oY?

Hehehe... congratulating myself on my careful playing, but shaking
with the knowledge of how close I had come to throwing it all away, I
descended to where I had last slain Rodney.  There's the damn thing!
I up and walked away without it!

As Misery grabbed the Amulet, I grabbed my own little !oBooze, and
celebrated with a healthy belt.

Things were getting a little fuzzy by now... I tell a lie: things were
VERY fuzzy.  But dammit, I had a job to do, and the sun would be going
down soon.  I had been trying for a year to get this far, and I was
not gonna wait one more damn day.  I wanted Demigoddesshood.  I
DESERVED Demigoddesshood!

Back to DL1... back to the stairs.  Have I got the ""?  Check.  4 ?oGD?
 Check.  4 or 5 B!oFH?  Check.  Everything B that should be?  Check.
/oD, /oT, /oDigging, and spares of everything?  Check.  Now half-empty
bottle of scotch?  Glugluglug, and Check!

Elemental Planes?  Pah!  After staring down the barrel of a unicorn
horn at big D, a few fudging E are supposed to scare me?

Oh, and thanks for the book of dig, Rodney, you fudging sissy.

And so Misery entered the Astral Plane.  A tame A with a Sunsword
seemed almost comical.  My confidence level was so high I thought
about slaughtering him just to add one more to my list of creatures
vanquished.

The potion of Clan MacGregor had started out tasting like liquid fire,
but by this time it was more like a potion of oil:  smooth.

Huh?  What?  Where am I?

The altar to the north was guarded by Pestilence, but after big D, not
even a Horseman of the Apocalypse seemed very dangerous.  Misery waded
through a sea of beasties, hewing priest-flesh from priest-bone,
returning Angels to Heaven, flinging Mjollnir with a gleeful abandon
that would have put Thor himself to shame, and, of course, stomping on
lots of bugs.  Pestilence didn't even get a chance to sick me; quick
zap of the old /oD put an end to his Ride.

And I stood on the altar.  I stood there for a good five minutes.  I
quaffed once more from my !oBooze, called all my friends back into the
room, took a bong rip, lit a cigarette, tried putting the ""oY in a bag
to make sure it was the right one, quaffed the rest of my !oFH for
those last few maxHP, quaffed once more from my !oBooze, took several
deep breaths, laughed out loud, taunted Eric and Jme... you get the
picture.

One thing I didn't do, though... I didn't push :

I didn't push :

Let me say it one more time.  

I

Did

Not

Push

:


...

I didn't push :.  Instead I pressed Alt-O.

What would you like to sacrifice?

a

You sacrifice the Amulet of Yender on the Altar of Tyr.

...


.....

........


WHAT?

And so, we finally come to the title of this story.  Yes, Virginia,
there is something worse than YASD.

You know, if Misery had sacrificed it to Loki, he probably would have
just killed her outright.  I think that would have been a little
better.

But no, it was Tyr.  And Tyr is a just God.  He rewards those who
serve Him well, even if they didn't intend to.

So He spared me.

Misery, (Neu-Fem-Hum-Val), escaped the dungeon in celestial disgrace.


Let me just repeat that, for those of you who might be hard of
hearing.

Misery, (Neu-Fem-Hum-Val), escaped the dungeon in celestial disgrace.

Celestial Disgrace.

CELESTIAL DISGRACE.

Now, earlier I said that my mistake of buying the !oBooze caused the
mistake of sacrificing the ""oY on the wrong altar which caused me to
cry like a teething infant.

That was a slight falsehood.

Teething infants don't know nearly as much profanity as I do.

Wordleslly I pushed the power button on the computer without even
Pressing ENTER to end.  I grabbed the !oBooze and headed out the door.
 Eric and Jme had not even spoken.  Even though we were rivals, we
were friends, and they knew better than to speak to me just then.
They ESPECIALLY knew enough not to laugh.

If they had laughed, I think I would have done something very rash.

I went for a bit of a walk.  In fact, I walked downtown and back,
about a two mile round trip.  As I walked, I guzzled scotch whiskey
like it was going the fudge out of style.  I seem to remember stopping
to puke by the side of the road.  (You vomit!  You can move again.)  I
lit cigarettes while I still had a half-butt burning.  I'm pretty sure
at some points I had three going.

Two words were bouncing around my soft brain... I bet you can guess
what they were... Here's a clue: the second one rhymes with misplace.

I considered throwing myself in front of the next city bus I saw, but
when I tried it, I realized I was at the bus station and the bus in
question wouldn't be moving for another ten minutes.

So I laid in front of it in the rain for a few minutes until the
rent-a-cop told me I had to get up, and that I wasn't allowed to walk
around with a half-gallon of scotch in my hand.  I pointed out that it
was actually only about 1/32 of a gallon of scotch, but he didn't seem
to understand what I was saying.

Suddenly there were two rent-a-cops, and it occurred to me that
perhaps I was hallucinating and he was really a gremlin.

I suddenly vomited.  I could move again.  Everything looked SO boring
now.  As I heard the shrill sound of a guard's whistle, I dropped my
!oBooze, realizing that it must have been cursed the whole time.

Then I either blacked out for a while or I stepped on a teleport trap,
because suddenly I was back on my front porch.  I heard the sounds of
courtly conversation and maniacal laughter in the distance.  I tried
to open the door, but it resisted.  I kicked the door.  Wham!  I tried
to kick it again, but my right leg was in no shape for kicking. I saw
a door open.  Jme was standing there with a look of pure compassion on
his face.  I stepped into his arms and started to cry.  Time stood
still as Jme and I lay in each other's arms.  I felt down in the
dumps.

Then suddenly I heard maniacal laughter close by.  Eric had been
trying to hold it in, but suddenly the dam broke.

The air crackled around me.  I pointed at Eric and cursed.

Jme chastized Eric, and Eric apologized, but I could see he was still
trying not to smile.

I explained that I had dropped the cursed potion of booze while
running from some K, and I gave Eric my PYEC and sent him to the
nearest delicatessen to buy a new one.  When he returned, he tried to
give me a !oFJ instead, claiming it would make me feel less nauseated.
 When I demured, he tried to give me a !oWater.

Motherfudger.

I began quaffing from the new !oB, and pretty soon after that I
thought about Maud.

...

Epilogue:

  A few weeks later, I created Nona the (Cha-Fem-Dro-Wiz) and started
to seriously whoop slashem's ass.  This time, I ascended with a
minimum of fuss.  You can be sure that I was mighty careful on the
Astral Plane that time, but even when the heavenly choir began to
sing, there was a sour taste in my mouth, as though I had drank
biologically contaminated slime mold juice.  And I've tasted that
sourness for two years now.  It was only today, just before I started
this post, that I finally felt like a new man.

I remember a few other things about that fateful friday.  my
girlfriend came over and laughed at me, which was when i realized we
would never get married.  jme gave an impromptu eulogy, even though
Misery was not, technically, dead.  We laughed as we recalled how she
nearly lost Mjollnir, and how scared we all were during her fight with
the big D.  late that night we used a magic marker to engrave
""6-14-02, Misery escaped the dungeon in celestial disgrace"" on the
computer monitor, where it stayed until, several months later, we
threw that monitor off a roof.

Several things have stayed with me from the experience.  First and
foremost, I learned that it never hurts to push :.  Second, I realized
that I would never ascend a Valkyrie in nethack.  For one thing, it's
too easy, but more importantly, the knowledge that Misery is still
alive somewhere, walking the earth like a fudging highlander, cursed
to live out the rest of eternity in celestial disgrace... it just
wouldn't be right to start another Valkyrie.  What if she ascended and
took Misery's rightful place beside Odin in the heavens (or worse,
beside Tyr!)?  The enormity of my error is already a fudging cursed
loadstone of guilt, ascending another valkyrie would be like reading a
damn scroll of punishment to go with it.

But the main thing is that I can't drink scotch anymore.

I used to play Minecraft a lot - certainly more than I do now. This story took place on one of the earlier post-official-release patches, I think with Enchanting and dungeons and such. I remember a lot of what happened, but not everything. Some of the facts I only learned about by listening to my friends over our Skype call, and hearing their tales after the fact.

All names have been changed for privacy reasons. ""Chapters"" (for the most part) denote the end of a play session.

###Part 1: Voyage to the New World
##Chapter 1: Preparing for Adventure

I played Minecraft only exclusively with a small group of four friends, on Hardcore private servers that we set up with specific themes in mind (for roleplay gaming). We usually stuck to simple, overarching themes like ""Post-apocalyptic world"" and created goals based on our character selection - anything from ""Build a rocket ship out of gold and diamond with enough Redstone fuel to escape the planet"" to ""Create a sustainable port city that is impervious to attack"".

After going through multiple worlds, one of the group - Mark - told us that he had been sharing the tales of our server with his friend Aaron, and that Aaron loved to play Minecraft and wanted to join us on our next adventure. Since Mark hosted the server, and after he assured us that Aaron would fit right in and get as into the roleplay as we usually did, we agreed that he could join us.

Andrew came up with the idea for the new world - an unexplored continent, where we are a group of people hired or volunteered for the expedition. There were three goals to the voyage, based on our characters: We were to explore and map out as much of the new continent as we could, document the various forms of wildlife and bring back samples of each, and collect enough treasure to bring back to the homeland and warrant a second, larger voyage.

Over a Skype call, we came up with the archetypes of our characters. Mark would be a scientist who volunteered for the expedition, and in charge of the cataloging goal; Aaron was one of two soldiers chosen to accompany the voyage to protect the important but otherwise weak characters (like Mark) - the other soldier was played by Andrew. Kyle chose the role of the experienced miner/foreman hired to lead the precious metals/stones expedition, and Greg decided on the role of ship's captain moonlighting as architect. I was the explorer/adventurer, tasked with mapping out the region.

After we had chosen our roles, Aaron brought up an interesting idea - each of us would create a ""secret motive"" or something similar for our character - something we would keep to ourselves but would reveal by the end of the mission. I chose to be ""eager to fight the unholy monsters that lived in the uncharted territories, which were the stuff of legend in the homeland, in hopes of returning as a majestic hero, vanquisher of evil."" I wanted to keep it simple, you know?

We said our goodnights shortly after, agreeing to start our adventure the coming weekend. It would be one of the most epic games we ever played.

##Chapter 2: The Voyage Begins

On Saturday at noon, we started our Skype call and Mark set up the new game world. We each had picked or created skins for our characters - a Professor Layton skin altered with rips in the clothing and a more leather-y look for me, a pirate skin for Greg, a scientist skin for Mark, a dirty farmer skin recolored to look more like a miner's outfit for Kyle, and the same knight skin for both Aaron and Andrew, only their hairstyle and names separating them. As we all hopped in, we realized we were in the middle of the desert, and needed to start at the edge of an ocean (or at least a lake big enough where we couldn't see the other side) for our journey. We set out west, and after maybe 5 minutes of walking found exactly what we needed. Perfect.

Greg immediately jumped into character, cursing the rough seas as the reason our ship had been lost and looking at our surroundings to figure out a course of action. We needed to find wood to build shelter and fire, and we would need to forage for food. I went with Aaron to the top of a nearby dune to see if we could find where the desert ended, and began chatting him up about the prospects of discovering and fighting deadly monsters while we were here. Aaron put on a surly attitude, reminding me that all of our supplies had been washed away with our ship, and we were lucky to still be alive. If there really were enemies here, we'd need more than just our fists to beat them. Atop the dune, we noted that we could just barely see trees in the distance to the north, and went back to the group to let them know.

Mark seemed almost too excited when we got to the greener side of life, remarking about the variety of trees and the great diversity in the ecosystem here in this untouched world. As we chopped down trees he lamented not being able to get a decent leaf sample or vine clipping, and was eventually chastised by Greg and Kyle for trying to hoard too much wood for his documentation and saving. As luck would have it, there was a wheat field within sight as well, which Mark and Andrew went to harvest while we chopped wood. Once we felt we had enough materials for a first night, we set up camp partway between the woods and the shore. Greg created two crafting tables, and began constructing a small house with Kyle and me, while Andrew and Aaron crafted torches, axes and swords. They, now with Mark's help, set up torches as the sun was beginning to set, and as night fell we congratulated each other on surviving the first day.

We ate bread and discussed the plans for the next few days, and as the sun came up we set to work. Aaron and I set out in search of high ground again, this time scaling trees and mentally mapping out the area since we didn't have the material for a map. We eventually began to see mountains on the northern horizon, and trekked back to base to inform the others. We returned to find that the rest of the group had been chopping down trees and foraging for more food during the day, and that there was already tension brewing between Andrew and Mark - Andrew was growing increasingly irritated by Mark's insistence to take a piece of each tree as a sample.

The next day we broke camp, taking our crafting tables and torches but leaving the house behind as we headed north for the mountains. We'd yet to encounter any monsters other than spiders, much to my dismay, but that all changed once night fell. We had our first encounter with a creeper, and it was only thanks to Andew's persistence that I didn't fight it (and probably get myself blown up). He drew the creeper a ways away and let it blow itself up before heading back to camp, where Aaron and I were busily fighting a spider and skeleton that had shown up. Greg noted my eagerness after the fight had ended, and warned me not to get ahead of myself. We weren't here to kill monsters.

We reached the mountain the next day and began exploring around its base, eventually finding an opening that led down into the mountain's depths. I couldn't go out exploring and mapping without, well, a map, and Mark was interested in what the subterranean ecosystem might hold. So all together, we set up camp on solid ground, prepared for our journey into the depths, and logged off. We would continue again next Saturday for more.

I must have been away from my computer when everyone left the Skype call, because I came back to find that everyone had left. The only thing I found strange was that, after Greg, Andrew and Kyle left the call, Aaron and Mark stayed on for an extra 20 minutes. In the end I figured they were probably just chatting about non-Minecraft-related stuff, and shrugged it off. But eventually I would find out, that call marked the beginning of Mark and Aaron's machinations.

##Chapter 3: Swallowed by Darkness

Throughout the week, our Minecraft party had been exchanging more ""roleplayed"" conversations over email and using image macros. Andrew's soldier had developed into a surly, I-hate-being-here-and-I-hope-you-all-die character, while I had slowly turned into the unbearably eager and excited (bordering on naive) young adventurer character. Greg was the seasoned old veteran who has seen more than his fair share of everything, and has enough wisdom to lead the group and enough to know when to let others lead. Kyle was a bit apathetic to the goings-on of the group, keeping himself focused on the task at hand. Mark was eager to get all scientific on the new continent, so much so that he was distancing himself from the group, even going so far as to act high-and-mighty to the group, because they didn't understand his work. Aaron, in contrast to everyone, was keeping a fairly open view and a low profile. His character was probably the most ""real"" of all of ours, if only because he wasn't turning into a giant archetype.

As Saturday rolled around and we got back into the game, we had already organized a list of basic necessities that we needed to get. The six of us descended into the depths after crafting plenty more torches and stone picks, shovels and swords for everyone (and bread, can't forget bread). We ventured down through the cave, stopping to mine coal and iron when we found it, and stocking up on cobblestone as well, just in case. At the first major split, Greg and Mark stayed behind to set up a mini-camp while Kyle and Andrew took one path, and I went with Aaron down the other.

Our path turned steeply downward after a short while, culminating in a nearly straight drop with just the faintest yellow light visible at the bottom of the drop. Aaron suggested we turn back, but I was eager to explore and search for the evils I had heard so much about. We carefully created a staircase around the edge of the drop, inching our way downward. We managed to find some gold ore in the walls, and Aaron noted that we would have to come back for it. We had almost reached the bottom, finally, when I noticed something below: a cobweb, and a lack of lava. Which could only mean one thing. A mineshaft! I relayed this back to the rest of the group eagerly, and even though they technically couldn't react (since in the roleplay, there was no way to communicate with them), we were all excited to explore it. Aaron and I decided we would head in a little deeper just to see what was directly around us, and then we'd head back.

I can't remember how much time had passed, honestly. Five minutes at least, fifteen at most. But as we'd been wandering around, I noticed that there weren't quite as many cobwebs as I was used to seeing in a mineshaft. All I remember is finding a room where the mineshaft broke into a skeleton dungeon, beating our way through and torching the walls until they stopped spawning, and heading over to the chest to open it. And then Aaron laughed, and I turned around to face him. And there he was, almost finished building a wall of Obsidian across the dungeon's entrance. Suspicious, I quickly started mining the wall on the opposite side and, sure enough, behind the outer layer of stone was more Obsidian. He had this trap set up in advance, and I was not happy.

Now, if you're not a Minecraft player or haven't done it in a while, mining Obsidian blocks with anything other than a Diamond pickaxe takes *four minutes*, and doesn't drop an Obsidian block. That can only mean that Aaron, somehow, had enough time to mine his way up to a Diamond pickaxe, find and mine enough Obsidian blocks for this trap, and then lead me down here. It was something that would've taken at least a couple hours of solid gameplay to pull off, and definitely *not* something he could've done during our one-and-a-half game sessions so far.

We were all pretty confused until Mark chimed in. Aaron had been talking with Mark after everyone left the Skype call last week, and threw out the idea of setting up a death maze inside the mountain we had found. Mark agreed, and opened up the server for him every day so he could prepare everything.

Andrew and I seemed the most upset about this breaking of the rules. Usually, everything we do on the server is talked out in advance and agreed upon. We had even considered a death maze-style world in the past, but eventually decided against it because of how long it would take to set up. Maybe we were overreacting, but whatever the case was, we certainly weren't in the mood to play anymore that day. We stopped early and I left the call almost immediately.

Aaron struck up a new email conversation with our party the next day, explaining his thought process and intentions behind what he did, even tying it back into his character's secret motive - his character didn't want to return to the homeland. He wanted to build an enormous empire on the new continent, which he would rule over until the day he died. It took until Wednesday for us to finally agree to keep going. I still had my reservations, since boxing me in with obsidian was a pretty common griefing move, but this time, at least, I would be ready. I thought there wouldn't be any more surprises.

I needed to stop making assumptions.

(Well that's a lot of writing so far, if people are interested I'll start writing up Part 2)

Part 1",16,4,4,http://www.reddit.com/r/gametales/comments/1cqfro/wwe_13_ziggler_vs_cactus_jack_the_feud_part_1/,"I don't know if people would be interested in a WWE 13 story but i think it's worth a try to test the waters.

It was a couple months back, after work i decided to fire up WWE 13. Creatively frustrated, i've been trying to activate or initiate storylines and feuds into my Universe Mode. So i decided to take tips from an online forum and what do you know. Blood feuds began popping up left and right. But there was a particular feud between Dolph Ziggler and Cactus Jack, that really caught my interest. 

They fought in a couple of brutal matches after Wrestlemania. An awesome submission match on a random episode of Raw where Ziggler won after putting Jack to sleep with a Sleeper Hold. After the match i was very surprised that Ziggler wanted to shake Cactus' hand after they nearly killed each other in a 20 minute epic. Cactus smacked Ziggler's hand and walked away frustrated. 

After the match i was surprised to see in the News column that Cactus Jack turned his back on the fans by not showing respect to Ziggler. Even though Ziggler was a full blown heel (A Heel is a Villain while a Face is a good guy, for those who don't know.) I decided to change Ziggler into a Face just to keep the dynamic going. A week later they were put into a Tag-Match against each other. It was Ziggler and Jericho vs Cactus Jack and John Cena, since Cena and Jericho were also feuding for #1 Contenders spot for Ryback's coveted WWE Championship. 

Before the match Ziggler and Jericho got into an argument over who would start the match. Jericho won the argument and Ziggler went onto the apron (Behind the ropes where a Tag partner usually goes). During the match about 10 minutes in after Jericho tagged in Ziggler, Jericho decided to walk off and leave Ziggler to fend for his own against Cena and Jack by himself. I wasn't surprised since 90% of the time when a tag-team gets into an argument before the match, one of them leaves. But what i was surprised at was that after a few more minutes, Cena walked into the ring and knocked Cactus out and also left the ring.

The match was pretty heated but after a few minutes of them trading punches and suplexes. Cactus landed his special move, the double arm DDT. Cactus picked up the win and both Ziggler and Cactus were tied 2-2 as far as Wins/Losses go. So the plan was to have a rubber match (The tie-breaker match in any feud)

Ziggler fought Cactus at Extreme Rules in an Extreme Rules match. A brutal match where blood was spilled and both men gave it their all. After 24 minutes (Which is pretty long for a wrestling match), Ziggler set up a table in the ring and was fixing to slam Cactus through. All of a sudden Cactus got Ziggler into a mandible claw (A maneuver where Cactus sticks his Middle and Ring finger down Zigglers throat to try and incapacitate him) Cactus went for the pinfall but Ziggler kicked out at a 2.9 count. Cactus then tossed Ziggler into a corner and tended to the table Ziggler put out. He then took a match from his boot and set the damn table on fire. He then tried a running attack to Ziggler at the corner of the ring and Ziggler dodged. Ziggler went in for a grapple manuever and Cactus reversed with two boots to Zigglers face pushing him back first near the table. Cactus then tried a running grapple to Dolph Ziggler and outta nowhere Ziggler reversed his grapple with a [Powerslam](http://youtu.be/JGLMjFz5aFw) right through the flaming table. Ziggler pinned him 1, 2, 3 and won the match. It was quite possibly the greatest culmination of a feud i've ever seen in a wrestling video game. I stood up and literally started clapping at how fluid and awesome that ending was. His music hit and instantly the crowd went nuts. Ziggler was all bloodied up that night but the adrenaline kept the pain away and he was able to overcome one of the greatest hardcore legends in the history of Wrestling.

I have no weapons, just a plastic flashlight and some bandages. Not knowing what else to do, I divert from my path to the hill past a small group of houses. There were three or four walkers gathered around the sides of the buildings, and they quickly spot me running with reckless abandon and give chase.
 
I loop around and wind sprint up the hill and past the man, crouched over a now pair of corpses. He turns to me and stares motionless in confusion. He sees the zombies behind me as I dive to the ground on the far side of the hill crest. The frantic zombies now see only one man standing there. he lets loose a few shots from his handgun and starts running down the hill, zombies now close behind their new quarry.
 
I crawl over to where my friend last stood, he's dead. I hear more gunshots from the bottom of the hill, he'll be back soon. I rifle through my friend's pockets as well as the first anonymous victim. I manage to grab some painkillers, a bandage and a hatchet; I'm not leaving anything for this marauding bandit.
 
Looking down the hill, I see the lone figure standing near the beach. He fires round after around at his pursuers, the sounds attracting more from the nearby road. In a bizarre twist of fate, I find myself silently rooting for a horde of undead monsters. A few gunshots later the man turns and heads back up the hill, the undead dispatched in a heap near the shore.
 
I grasp my friend's hatchet firmly and crouch behind a large bush near the pair of corpses. He approaches his handiwork cautiously, looking from side to side for any sign of me. As he crouches down to look for loot on the bodies, I slowly begin to crawl towards him, hatchet in hand.
 
He catches a glimpse of me and immediately stands up, pistol extended. I break out into a full sprint, zig-zagging towards him. ""You better shoot me!"" I yell as I close the distance between us. After three misses from his handgun, it clicks. Empty. He turns to run, but just as he does, I close the last few steps between us and bury the hatchet into the small of his back. 
 
He falls quickly.

 
* * *
 

""Hey, where did you go?"" I whisper loudly.
 
""I'm right here! No, over here!"" Daniel replies, amused that I can't find him despite the fact that he's fewer than six feet from me.
 
""This is hilarious"" Nathan chimes in from a few feet behind.
 
It is pitch dark. I can see a few splotches of starlight reflecting off the side of a concrete building as well as the silhouttes of some fences and what I think is a shed, but I can't see where I'm about to step. The dim flickering red light we had benefitted from thanks to a flare Nathan tossed a few minutes ago was now useless, blocked by the tall grass through which we were now crawling.
 
""Look, we're almost there, I can see the light from that fire flickering off the hospital right on the other side of these fences, let's just go!"" I say, impatiently.
 
Nathan and Daniel carry on an indistinct conversation between them as I crawl away towards the flickering light in the distance. I slowly approach a gap in the fence when I see an indistinct shape in front of it. I pause and grip my hatchet. In the deep blackness I see only a faintly illuminated shape in the grass. It looks organic, but it's not blowing in the breeze like the grass it's nestled in.
 
I lean in closer trying to figure what on earth I've found. I'm blinded by muzzle flashes as a deafening spray of automatic gunfire shatters the silence of the night. I fall back, my chest perforated and my blood pooling on the ground beneath me.
 
""What the hell??"" ""What was that?"" Nathan and Daniel are shouting in panicked confusion.
 
""Hey. Look over here.""
 
Nathan turns to the silhouette of a nearby shed as another hail of gunfire cuts him and Daniel down; so much for safety in numbers.

One of the bandits closes in to survey the spoils of their ambush. Nathan, laying on his back in a pool of his own blood, looses a flurry of gunshots from his pistol. He succumbs from his blood loss as the bandit falls beside him.",Video,False,self,t5_2wqgc,1364700226.0,video,ranconteur,True,t3_1bb9v6,http://www.reddit.com/r/gametales/comments/1bb9v6/tales_from_dayz_runins_with_bandits/,

A lot has happened in such a short time.  I don’t know just exactly where to begin…
	
I’ll start with what happened immediately after the soldier crumpled after we destroyed the orb that possessed him.   He was unconscious, so we took the time to loot the area, and to rest for the night.  We took watch, and while on Branimir and Easy Torinn’s watch, the soldier awoke.  We had taken his weapons, so he was flailing around, rampaging through until I managed to get him into a headlock.  He calmed down, saying his name was Berix.  

Berix was on the borders of Salthirn with his fellow soldiers, looking into a cult involving the goddess of destroying civilizations, Zythra.  He was fighting, when everything went black.  Apparently, the ‘bandits’ were just simple farmers, who were similarly possessed.  He was anguished when he did not find the rest of his comrades, believing he had hunted and slain them.  Branimir, however, suggested that perhaps Berix’s friends were on separate hunts.
Berix was obviously anguished, but he agreed. 

We took shifts again, now sleeping in the tents.  I was alone except for Zeharia, the Deva Invoker.  I was staring off into the wilderness, when I noticed something in the trees.  Something… white.  

I called out to it, and it was my mother.  

How can this be possible?  She died.  I saw her head on a spear, being carried around by Orcs…  

I told her my excuses, for the murders I committed for that noble.  How I had to kill to survive in the forest and wilderness.  She seemed disappointed in me, but was glad that I was… becoming civilized.  It was then I noticed that Zeharia wasn’t moving.  It was if I was frozen in time, like it seems to be when I was hunting, when everything slowed down as I stalked a deer.
	
My mother left me, then.  I’m still not sure what to think of all of this, but ultimately I had to pull myself out of this little hole I had dug myself into.  
	
Morning dawned, and we finally got to Dodaca, the capital of Salthirn.  Berix left us, but my instincts tell me we’ll see more of Berix in our future.  That’s aside the point, however.  We roamed a tiny bit through, scoping out, when a young man around the age of 12 ran by, taking our coin purses.  

Torinn and I ran after the boy, easily outstripping him after a small chase, cornering him in an alley.  We questioned him a bit, and I threatened him.  After what happened to the boy, the words I whispered to him still stick in my head…

“First, I take my knife.  Then, I slowly bleed them out.  I let them keep the money, since they’ve already paid me.  In blood.  And they regret stealing from me for the rest of their days.  Which really isn’t long, most only last a few hours.” 

The boy confessed at this threat.  He needed the money to pay off his debt to the Thieve’s Guild.  We let him go, to have him look for Narith’s father.  We gave him a payment for his trouble, and went into the inn, having a meal and resting down.  I felt suspicious that night, so we posted a guard.

This did not help.
	
We woke up to find, in black writing, “Don’t make dealings with the wrong people” and the innkeeper said that a mysterious man with silver hair had said that he needed to see them, and to meet him at the Silk Whispers Inn.  Branimir and I decided to stay at the inn, in case the man came back.  Zeharia and Easy Torinn, meanwhile, went on their way to find the child who we had hired to find Narith’s father.  

The boy was dead.  Poisoned.  And abandoned on the streets by the guards, fute it.  

Torinn questioned the guards, and the Dragonborn mentioned something about lying about being the child’s adopted father.  But Torinn also got actual information: the location of Narith’s father’s house.  

We decided to go to the Silk Whispers Inn, however.  As we walked up, I noticed something that had not occurred to me before: the ring I had gotten from Narith’s house was gone.  Stolen.  Then we noticed a silver-haired man.  We walked up to him, using everything to get him to recognize us: the ring, Honor in Family, the mentioning of the words on the wall, but he didn’t recognize us.

Zeharia tried to stop him, but suddenly froze, his eyes looking far away, then he crumpled to his knees, shaking.  And the man was gone.

Here's one of mine. But before I tell you the story, I probably need to explain exactly what Sub Rosa is, since it is not very well-known.

Sub Rosa is a game of deceit and communication. The game is split into three teams, but each team can only communicate with one other team at a time; there is no global chat. The various game modes include one team spawning with a floppy disk, and one or both of the other teams spawning with money. It is then up to the team with the disk to decide who to trust and trade with. Killing everyone is an option, but is generally frowned upon. There are also three way deals where each team has a disk and must trade with two other teams to get the disk they need, a simple race around the map, and a mode called Acquisition. This story takes place in an Acquisition round, where you are tasked with killing NPCs driving around the map and taking the disks they're carrying.

As my team and I spawned in (I believe there was also a few other people spread across other teams, but they don't really play into the story at all), we saw that this round was an Acquisition round. Speed and precision are of the essence in Acquisition, so I purchased a faster car with money I'd saved up. I was in this car alone, while my teammates followed me in the standard towncar. As soon as the round started, I raced out of our garage, heading to one of the main roads where the NPCs were most likely found.

I turned a corner, barreling down the main road, and saw one of the NPC cars turn out onto the road further down. My teammates soon rounded the corner after me, and we quickly immobilized the car, leaving the man carrying the disk for later. I continued down the main road at high speed, and saw the other NPC car coming down a side street towards the road I was on. I had already passed the side street, so I threw on the handbrake and sent my car into a perfect 180 degree drift. I was now driving in reverse, watching the NPC car turn onto the main road as my teammates stopped to execute the NPC we'd immobilized and take his disk. 

As the other NPC began driving down the main road, I began to fire at him, aiming mostly for the car. Still driving backwards, I began going up a hill, and the NPC followed. Just as we reached the peak of the hill, I'd done enough damage to the car for it to wreck (the cars kind of explode, but no damage is done to the occupants). As the car exploded, it launched itself over the crest of the hill, tumbling through the air as the NPC inhabitants looked at me helplessly. One of my teammates got a lucky headshot on one of the NPCs, and his body flew from the tumbling car and landed far away. The NPCs, not smart enough to leave their car, began firing at us while they were upside down, and a brief firefight ensued while we quickly dispatched them. Then, we grabbed the disks we needed, headed home, and got ready for another round.",Video,False,self,t5_2wqgc,False,video,author,True,t3_1coxix,http://www.reddit.com/r/gametales/comments/1coxix/sub_rosa_an_epic_shootout/,

I've retold it a few times, so I'll just copy the text here. This may mean some names aren't perfectly explained, but I hope the context may present some clarity.

For way of explanation, L5R is a game where you play samurai in a setting inspired by ancient Japan and China.

&gt;*Disclaimer: I've told this story a few times, and every time it ends up being way too long.*

&gt;I've played a single campaign in L5R. I think what stood out most to me was my rival. I played a Lion bushi with a hardline approach to honour, my rival NPC was a former Lion turned ronin.

&gt;He wasn't even my idea, the GM randomly introduced him in a flashback of my gempukku ceremony as the intended inheritor of the ancestral sword who bumbled his chance and the sword ended up with me instead. The GM kept putting him in our way; rarely as a main obstacle, just as a background character. He also kept doing flashbacks and expanding our backstory.

&gt;By the end we had started out as friends; I the loyal subject from a branch family and he the scion of the main house. He was a somewhat troubled sort, though, and after he disgraced himself at the ceremony he was banished from the Lion. We met once again before the actual game started, in a small sake house. He was he leader of a band of ronin, while I was just passing through. One thing led to another, he made some drunken remarks and we had a duel. It was a close call, but I cut him down on the first exchange and left him bleeding but alive on the floor. I monologued at him for a bit and left.

&gt;We met again a couple of times after that. Now he was the bodyguard of a Phoenix shugenja, suspected (and later confirmed) to be the corrupted by Fu Leng. We pretty much just stayed out of each others' way. It was only much later when we had a proper encounter again. He and his master were terrorizing some remote fishing village. We had to make an exchange with them due to circumstances, but were unwilling to give them free reign of the place.

&gt;Some words and actions later and our differences were to be settled with a duel. I faced him on the cold and wind-swept beach at dawn. I had the ancestral sword but he wore enchanted armour. He was the superior duelist, but I was the better tactician. Again it came down to the wire, but again I won the initiative and again I left him bleeding on the ground but alive. I monologued at him for a bit and left.

&gt;We only settled matters at our third duel. By then I had been promoted to Shireikan and was one of the handful remaining senior officers of the Akodo. I was in charge of the defence of Swift Sword Castle, he commanded the invading army; he sent assassins and I sent saboteurs; I made plans and he hindered our allies. As the battle began, he ordered men against our walls and we repelled them. He ordered demons against the walls and we pulled them in and destroyed them. At night he taunted us with the torture of hostages and I had them killed. The second day he sent beasts against the walls and we decimated them. He had many times our numbers, but we held them off with minimal losses. Which is when he got reinforcements. And so did we; the Kitsune shugenja had laboured for days to open a gate to the spirit realms and called on the ancestors directly. We sortied and charged their camp.

&gt;In the midst of the pitched battle I came across him. I cut down his bodyguards with a single stroke (it was a pretty high-powered game at this point) and again it came down to a duel. My battle horse was a gift from the Ox Clan, but his steed was some unnatural beast. I had the ancestral sword and my armour was a treasure from the now lost Dragon Clan, but his armaments were made of Shadow-tainted steel and he had sworn himself to the Lying Darkness so that every time I hit him he was like smoke.

&gt;Again and again we rode at each other. By our sixth exchange I had cut down his horse and his shadow power was exhausted. But he was unhurt and my left arm hung useless. Again it came down to the wire, but again I won the initiative. Again he was the one on the ground, but this time I had not left him alive. I monologued at his funeral pyre.

&gt;**Footnote:** The campaign ended soon thereafter and we were allowed to craft our own epilogues. My character retired to a temple after a long life of accomplishments. He handed over the ancestral sword to the most promising of his students; who happened to be the grandniece of his rival.

Sorry about that. I encourage feedback and criticism, just please keep it constructive. For whatever it's worth, this story is based on a very close encounter I had this morning while playing XCOM. The dialogue I added for flavor, of course, but the core story is all accurate.**

.

.

The squad is deployed along a narrow alley in Shanghai, trying to rescue civilians while fighting off the alien invaders. 

Snipers Ice and Eagle are positioned at the rear of the alley, watching for movement. Supports Smoke and Cross are taking cover behind a trash can and an AC unit, respectively, along the sides of the alley. The team's heavy, Ogre, is positioned behind a police car, ready to fire his rocket launcher if called on. 

Flash, the squad leader and assault specialist, readies herself to breach a door at the end of the alley, shotgun in hand. Just as she gets into position, the door opens. A Berserker bursts out, not even seeing Flash as it charged out into the open. 

Luckily, the squad was ready. A veritable rain of gunfire tears into the behemoth; shotgun, assault rifle, and sniper shots pepper the beast. Incredibly, it remains standing after the assault. As it turns, setting it sights on Flash, two Mutons from inside the room take cover behind the door, firing out into the alley. Cross takes a hit, but shakes it off and returns fire. 

""Cross, status?"" the Commander's voice crackles across the radio.

""Yellow, I'm hurt but I can keep going!"" she responds with only the slightest hint of of a grimace.

The squad is shaken but standing strong; the Beserker is nearly dead and the Mutons pose at most a minor threat on their own. With but a moment's hesitation, the Commander orders Flash to leave the Berserker to her squadmates and deal with the Mutons inside the door. She instantly turns and, with a single well-placed shot, blows the head off one of the Mutons. As it goes down, a single sniper shot from Ice finishes off the Berserker. Cross, seeing her opportunity, moves forward and reloads, getting into position to bring down the final Muton...

It was the wrong move. Suddenly, from the roof, a second Berserker drops down and begins pummeling Cross. Over and over it lifts and smashes her into the ground. A repeated crunching of bone can be heard. 

""CROSS!"" bellows Support Smoke. He stand from his crouch, getting ready to run over and treat his downed squadmate.

""Hold position Smoke! We need to get that thing away from her first"" the Commander quickly orders. ""Flash, get some fire on that thing, draw it towards you!""

Without bothering to reply, Flash opens fire on the Berserker, baiting it to her undefended position. She fires two quick shotgun blasts; the first connects, but the second ricochets off the monster's armor. The Berserker complies with gusto, immediately turning and running to her. 

Things quickly get worse. From a side alley, a Cyberdisk and two Drones float in, flanking Flash. The Cyberdisk transforms, opening fire with its gattling laser. From only 10 feet away, with no cover between it and Flash, there is no way it can miss...

Somehow, it does. Flash, in her lightweight skeleton armor, manages to duck beneath the shot. She's survived for the moment, but she is in a very ugly position. 

""Ogre, get rid of those fucking drones!"" the commander shouts into the radio. 

""Thought you'd never ask"" replies Ogre as he hefts and fires into rocket launcher into the tightly packed machine group, outright destroyed the support Drones and damaging the Cyberdisk. 

Smoke cuts into the radio channel, ""Sir, Cross's vitals are weakening by the second, if I don't get over there...""

""You're clear, cross behind the car and stabilize her!"" the Commander quickly replies. 

As Smoke runs to try and save Cross, dodging fire from the remaining Muton, the Berserker runs to try and destroy Flash. It rears up and begins pummeling Flash, but she manages to avoid the worst of it. She runs, reloading as she goes, desperately trying to put distance between her and the enemies as she bleeds from a dozen wounds.

Her attempts are in vain. The Cyberdisk, limping but still functional, floats after her as it begins spinning up its grenade launcher. Flash turns, knowing she is facing death and determined to take the bastard with her. It begins its launch...

By this point, the more astute readers among you may be asking yourselves, ""Where the hell are the snipers? Weren't there six commandos in this squad?"" Yes indeed there were and are. While all of this was going on, the snipers in the back of the alley were busy getting into position on top of the buildings on either side of the alley, using their grappling hooks to ascend. Just as the Cyberdisk was preparing to finish off Flash, a shot rings out from Ice; it thuds into the floating beast, interrupting its attack. A second shot, coming from Eagle on the adjacent roof, goes wide. 

""Heh, damn rookie"" Ice taunts into the radio as he fires a second shot, finding a vital component and destroying the Cyberdisk. 

Flash doesn't waste any time celebrating. She ducks behind cover and opens fire onto the Berserker, drawing its attention again. It charges, straight into a second shotgun blast which removes the top half of its head. The beast crashes to the ground with a loud *thud*. 

The final Muton, seeing its opportunity, sprints out to finish off Flash. As it steps out, Ogre and Smoke open fire, lighting it up but failing to bring it down. It pulls out its plasma rifle and aims it at Flash...

""Redemption, fucker.""

A single shot is heard from Eagle's roof. The bullet flies across the open space, and embeds itself in the wall behind the Muton. The alien, now missing its left arm, falls to the ground dead.

""Shit yeah!"" Eagle shouts from his rooftop, standing up and flipping off the dead alien.

""Eagle, get your head down! This is still a combat zone!"" Flash angrily shouts at him, the first time she has spoken since the engagement began.

Before Eagle can reply, the Commander cuts in. ""Thank you. Smoke, once you're finished with Cross, get over to Flash and treat her. Eagle, cover Ice and Ogre while they reload. Once you've been treated, Flash I want you to move into and clear the building the Berserker came from....""

My tan camouflage gear makes me look like a goddamn shrub. The Americans were attempting to take Arica harbor from us, and we were designated to protect several vital points along the route to the harbor. I find a decent place to set up, and a friend sets up about ten meters to my right.


 We wait for the first wave of American soldiers supported by heavy armor to attempt to breach our line. Below, engineers and heavy gunners prepare their positions and begin laying mines and c-4. At first, they were small dots in the distance, then, I as they came closer, we could make them out. A medium sized attack force lead by three tanks and two buggies in a triangle formation hurtled toward our line. The line below simply rippled, for lack of a better word. There were rockets, hundreds of bullets, and tracer darts flying toward the advancing Americans. One of the tanks explodes as a well placed TOW missile smashed through the treads and sets the tank ablaze. At this point, I pull out my designator and laze a position for a mortar strike, leading the American strike force by at least 200 meters.


  The Americans are firing everything they have, and the land is quaking with explosions and the vibration of a nearby T-90. The T-90 takes a vantage point on a small knoll, and takes aim at the Americans. It fires one, earth shattering cannon blast, and the secondary machine gun opens up. I raise my GOL and take aim at the advancing infantry, slightly behind the tanks. I fire a shot, and the bullet falls comically short and makes a puff in the dirt just before a soldiers feet. My partner is calling out targets left and right. The engineers below are yelling frantically as they attempt to repair one of the T-90's with drills.
 

 The American tank column has all but froze in their positions, firing nearly everything they have. The T-90 on the knoll takes a cannon shot to the side, and begins to smoke. Before the driver of could get out, the tank explodes brilliantly, killing the driver and the gunner. I look around, confused. There was no tank that shot that, what happened? I look up, and a contrail from an American hellfire missile leads directly to the destroyed T-90. I spot a small drone, using a laser to designate targets, and take aim. I shoot once, and the bullet falls just below the small remote controlled helicopter. I adjust my aim, and fire once more. The bullet flies into the side of the drone, and the rotor stops and the drone crashes into the ground just in front of the halted American line.



 Our line is holding strong, and the T-90 being repaired has come back to lay down suppressing fire for a medic stranded behind a rock in no-man's land. A shot rings out, and my friend ceases telling out targets. I look to my side, and lying in a small pool of blood, he lay dead. An uncontrollable anger possesses me, and I raise my gun, attempting to find this murderer. I see him, crouched inside a bus, taking potshots at the line. I use my rangefinder to gauge the distance. 1209 meters. I raise my rifle, and adjust the sight. I wait until the sniper has popped out again, and fire a shot. The bullet seems to hang in he air as it hurtles toward the American sniper. At second and a half passes between my shot and it reaching the sniper. The bullet hits the side of the bus he is hiding in, and I can see him jump and crouch down. Too late, motherfucker. I quickly line another shot up, and squeeze the trigger, yelling as I do it. The bullet hangs in the air as it did before, but finds its mark in the American sniper's skull.



 I sit down. There are explosions, and the rumbling of tanks. The engineers below are screaming, and the medics are running around like crazed ants. I take a deep breath, and sit back up. I see a small buggy In the distance hurtling toward out line. I scope in. The buggy has at least four bricks of C-4 on the hood. I take aim, and shoot. Miss. I call it out over the radio, and the line adjusts it's fire on the buggy. A cannon shot from a T-90 hits near the tire of the buggy, and it goes up like a goddamn firework. The line stops for a moment, to watch the burning husk of the car flip through the air. It lands, and creates a crater the size of a refrigerator. The American line begins retreating. The soldiers bellow and scream at the tanks and fire off the last of their mags. For now, it is over.",Video,False,self,t5_2wqgc,1364326167.0,video,author,True,t3_1b1von,http://www.reddit.com/r/gametales/comments/1b1von/bad_company_2_sniper_duel/,
1376735099.0,10,self.gametales,1kjlfe,[LOTR Online] The second fellowship's quest to slay the Balrog,12,2,1,http://www.reddit.com/r/gametales/comments/1kjlfe/lotr_online_the_second_fellowships_quest_to_slay/,"So, this is the story of my group of friends epic quest to fight the Balrog in the Lord of the Rings MMORPG. 

It was a weekend and myself and 4 friends had assembled for a LAN party. We had agreed to check out LOTR online, all of us being fans of the books and movies. Now a couple of people had accounts but were only around level 15 to 20. The rest of us were completely new to the game so had to start from scratch, making it a good thing we started at 10am and intended to go on till late night.

All of us wound up being Dwarves or Hobbits, myself some sort of healer class Dwarf, two other. Dwarves, both some form of melee dps/tank, and two hobbits doing I-don't-know-what.

Now, the first thing the noobies among us do is the standard starter quests, running errands for a few gold and xp. Along these travels I came across 'the pimp hat' as a drop from an enemy. It was a wide brimmed, feather adorned purple pimp hat, and goddamn was it glorious. I swore to wear it from thereon in, stating something along the lines of 'I could kill a fucking Balrog with this thing on!'. And so the seed was planted. We began to wonder if there was even a Balrog in the game, checking on the map we found Moria, after much laughing and discussion our quest was determined. To slay the Balrog, 5 new players under level 20 setting out to kill a monster that was not only undoubtedly highly powered, but also possibly did not even exist in the game. 

The first challenge was to get everyone in the same place so our party could begin our epic quest. We decided to meet at the prancing pony, which one friend decided sounded like the name of a gay bar, this becomes relevant later.

Now, here was the problem, for various reasons we were all miles away from the chosen meeting place, all alone and all completely clueless about what lay ahead. After approximately 30 minutes of running we began to come closer together, three had arrived but myself and another were still a ways away. And then, within about 5 seconds of each other, the fellow traveller and I both got aggro from enemies well above our level range. I was quickly despatched with my friend not far behind. 

Much groaning was done, the LAN party had been going a fair length of time now and we hadn't even assembled the party yet, the three who had assembled becoming impatient and beginning to get up to a variety of hijinks.

It was at this point we discovered the fast travel horses. You can pay a small fee and they will take you to key places fast, including the town in which the prancing pony was. After much ridicule, face-palming and one person throwing their mouse at me, the two of us were on our way.

During this time the other three had been terrorising the patrons of the prancing pony, offering 'sexy dances' to players unfortunate enough to enter the pub. They found Gandalf in a room upstairs and, due to their height compared to his, decided to have their characters mimic various sexual acts. This was probably a bad move, molesting the man who slew the Balrog, and was pointed to as one of the many, many (many) reasons this quest ended as it did.

Upon my arrival all the others were there, stripped of all armour, on the tables dancing and attempting to make the prancing pony into the gay bar they had hoped it would be.

After several more minutes of dancing (I joined in of course, but kept the hat on), we decided to set off. We found Moria on the map, designated a party leader to follow, and then began running straight for it.

After approximately 45 seconds we had lost two people to a wall between them and the person they were following, and the rest of us had aggro'd a number of enemies. 

After despatching the enemies, some healing for everyone, and finding the two lost members, we set off again. Things went well for a while, we came across several groups of enemies that we took care of fairly easily, some of us even leveled. We came across a town and we all decided to set it as our home so we would spawn there on death. 

After five minutes or so of leaving the town we were strung out slightly and going through an area with enemies a few levels out of our highest players range, we were sticking to the path and keeping well away from them.

I was in the lead at the time, and one friend said 'Dude, fall back, you're healer', sound advice as the tanks should be in the lead incase of an unexpected enemy lurking around.

As he said that I spotted a lone enemy not far off the track, relatively low level for the area and what I thought would be manageable for the party. So I replied 'what's that? Aggro?' And ran towards the enemy. It was then I spotted the other three enemies hidden behind a bush and a small hill. It was too late, I'd gotten their attention and so I did a 180 and started running back towards and through the group as people started shouting, running, requesting healing and all round chaos was unleashed. I attempted to heal my teammates but they were cut down so quickly I could do nothing but flee. After a short bloody fight, I was the only survivor, having fled most of the way back to the village the others were spawning at.

After a lot of laughing, and another mouse being thrown at me, we continued on our way, with my character being set to follow the backmost player and then having my keyboard and mouse taken away. 

After some time we came to a river with huge cliffs either side. After looking at the map we found it was pretty much impassible save for a few select points, all a good walking distance away. However, we then saw that the river itself would take us a long way toward our destination, and our battle with the Balrog. We decided to swim along it, despite it being longer than on foot, since it was a clear path and was likely free of any enemies we would surely encounter on land.

So we set off, swimming slowly, determined to slay the Balrog and prove that the mighty pimp hat and the 'second fellowship' would overcome all. 

After some time, one friend decides to go grab some drinks and heads out of the room. In less than 10 seconds we were crowded around his pc deciding what to do. We settled on a subtle, but very annoying plan. We turned his character around, still on auto-swim and faced him back the way we came, then we all went back to our seats and played it cool.

He returned and found nothing amiss, after 5 minutes or so he began to wonder how he was consistently out of sight of us, a few more minutes passed, he checked his map, and then the cursing started and the laughing too.

When he eventually caught back up, through us waiting out of kindness and him threatening us with violence if we didn't, we continued on our way. 

After some time we came to our exit, we got up the slope leading out of the river, and then we saw where our path lead us next. Straight through a party of enemies over twice the level of our highest character. 

We had come too far to stop now. We crept forward, slowly but surely making ground while staying well away from anything that moved. After 5 minutes or so of this there was an unspoken agreement between the party. We looked up, nodded slightly at each other, then the cry went out ' FOR ROHAN!' We made a run for it. 

Our heroic charge went well for the first 30 metres or so. Then one friend got one-shotted, looking back to see if I had time to revive him I saw 5 or so enemies, each of which could decimate our party solo. So I ran.

Another friend went down, mobbed by enemies coming from the side. Now all that remained were the two highest level players, and by some miracle myself. We kept running, hoping we could get far enough to drop the enemies hot on our heels. Then as we rounded a corner we found ourselves heading straight for a pack of enemies. The strongest member of the party, who was at the front of the charge, said 'I'll grab aggro, friend A, keep him secret, keep him safe, get the hat to Moria!' With that he got the attention of the enemies and took a turn to the side drawing them away. 

Myself and Friend A were determined to make sure his sacrifice was not in vain. We headed on, then came face to face with another group of enemies, with several still on our tail. There was only one chance, we ran to the left, we had spotted a river and hoped that the enemies couldn't follow us in, being large ogre type creatures. 

We made it to the water, but to our horror they came right in with us, circling back to the right to get back on land we barely made it ashore before Friend A dropped, the last of his health being swiped away by one of the ogres who had been stalking us. I ran, I knew I wouldn't make it but I couldn't just give up. Using every healing buff I could and running straight forward I made it another hundred metres before I fell. The hat had made it as far as it would, that day. 

We had failed to reach Moria, let alone fight any balrog, but we had done far better than we expected, and had many a laugh along the way.

1370878356.0,12,self.gametales,1g1sak,[Planetside 2] The Long Journey Home. Part 2,22,10,0,http://www.reddit.com/r/gametales/comments/1g1sak/planetside_2_the_long_journey_home_part_2/," Cold, tired, and ever so regretting leaving my friends to die. After we jumped from the Bio-dome everything has gone wrong, it's as if I'm in hell, but the step-child version. We were immediatly engaged in combat. Just an enemy squad on the ground, nothing we couldn't handle. 3 of us layed down suppressing fire while me and another soldier took up the left flank. A simple military tactic, and effective. After that small skrimish we darted towards the exit. A tank caught us in it's FOV and opened fire. We dodged it's shell and quickly got away. it didn't chase us, guess the bastard was lazy. 

 It was getting dark so we headed for a cave. Not much caves on this crap continet. I believe it's called  ""Indar"" or some shit I didn't pay attention to when I signed up. I set up a small campfire with my EST otherwise known as ""Emergency Survival Kit."" These fellas I'm with don't know who I am, and I wished to keep it that way. See, when you've been a combat soldier long enough you try not to make new friends, because friends always die. 

All 5 of us were sitting around the campfire, eating our rations, when one PFC Hicks attempted to start smalltalk. ""So, what do you all think of these 'glorious' rations? taste worst than an NC snatch! haha."" ""Oh so you fuck the enemy now hicks?"" responded a young, but brave soldier named Vlad. He was a private. ""Only when it's easy,"" What about you, what's your name anyways?"" Hicks said, looking directly at me. ""My name is Jensen, and I really don't care. You're lucky we even have these rations."" ""You don't need to be so serious bro."" ""Leave him alone hicks, he doesn't want to talk and that's fine."" I got up and left anyways. I would rather be by myself anyways. 

I loathe hierarchies, chain of command is why. Because I'm a corporal, I'm in charge of these grunts. Ever since I was a kid I was always the one receiving orders, never giving them. I guess this is apart of growing up. Speaking of growing up, I remember when I enlisted. See in our sovereignty, we don't enlist weaklings. Our proud collective only wants the best. They do their best to convince you not to join up, it's a tactic they use to weed out the ones who just want to look good in a uniform. They run so many test too, but lets not talk about those. I remember walking into the recruitment stations. My enlistment papers in one hand, and all the things I own in...well I was wearing them actually. My parents were always neutral when it came to politics, so when I enlisted, they gave me the boot. I walked up to the Fleet sergeant and handed him my papers. ""Are you sure boy, no turning back?"" I smiled and he smiled backed. He logged me into the system on his holopad and gave me my orders. 

I regret that day, because military life is not glorious. Sure we have technology, but not the stuff they show you on holovids. They give us grunts the crappiest equipment. They glorify us, yet treat us like dirt. For a race, that prides itself on technology and prosperity, we can't even win a war. I remember hearing stories of how the colonist started the vanu sovereignty, but I can't remember.

Hicks slowly approached me. ""Hey is something wrong sir?"" ""No, I just like to be alone most of the time."" ""Oh well, I'll leave you be th...."" An explosion rocked the cave. ""Shit they found us!""

I personally don't have a problem with video submissions, per se. However, I think that they should be restricted to self-produced videos, lest this subreddit become flooded with random youtube links.

As for the submission I mentioned above, I find it inappropriate for two reasons, and I downvoted it for three reasons. The first reason I find it inappropriate is what I mentioned above - that I believe we should restrict video posts to self-made videos. The second reason is that it does not relate an actual gaming story, which has actually taken place, but is rather a gaming-related cartoon/sketch. Lastly, while this is not something that makes it inappropriate for posting it here, I personally find it very un-humorous, which is the third reason why I downvoted it - I thought it was poor content.

Let me end this by posing another question, to help spur discussion: half a year ago, I made a Let's Play of the game FTL: Faster Than Light, for two of my friends, partly serving as an introduction to the game, and partly documenting the adventure of the spaceship The Metropolis on its journey through a galaxy in civil war.

1364989923.0,10,self.gametales,1bkyn4,Derailing and Delight [L.A. Noire],12,2,0,http://www.reddit.com/r/gametales/comments/1bkyn4/derailing_and_delight_la_noire/,"I have just discovered this subreddit, so I felt that one of my favorite gaming stories should be told. This is the story of a tram, a hill, and how the two send me into laughter so strong my sides began to sting. 

L.A. Noire was my playground for many weeks after it launched. The game was a positive step in the right direction for the video game medium. Good story. Superb graphical performance. Most of all, however, the game was fun. I would even debate that L.A. Noire was more fun than other open world game with cars due in part to your security in the world. You are a member of the L.A.P.D. If there was ever a need for high speeds, there was a justified reason for your actions. 

Those justified reasons soon became things of the past as I found faster and more sporty cars and vehicles. 

Many hours into the game, I have finally reached Hollywood. This region of the would became my playground with fast cars. Unlike the cluttered streets of other regions of the game world, Hollywood gave you enough breathing room to really unleash some speed. Other cars were a problem occasionally, but nothing 'borrowing' a new car could not fix. Then, one day, I met my fear head-on. 

The trams were always odd to me. I had hit them many times throughout my play-through. I must have never gathered enough velocity to shake the steel beasts for they usually brought me from sixty to zero with little more than a budge. So over time, I grew to ignore them. More so, however, I grew to ignore the tracks that the trams followed. This was my undoing. 

I must have been more reckless than I otherwise had been when it happened. I was speeding through Hollywood, waving through red lights and barely missing cars and trucks as they whizzed by own vehicle. I came to a hill, ready to the joyful leap that would follow. What I saw at the base of the hill stirred a fear in me however. Rolling through the four-way was a tram, big and yellow and traveling at a speed that would soon allow the two of us to intersect. I panicked. Really. In reality, away from the polygons and the digital enjoyment, I gasped. I might have quietly shouted. There was no turning back now for all four tires were meeting no friction as they turned in the air.       

My car met the tram at full speed. The tram, which was eastbound, was traveling at a modest speed as well. It did not matter, however, as the tram lifted off the tracks, skidding and screeching towards cars awaiting the red lights. It met them with a good speed, causing surprising amounts of damage. By this point, my controller was on the floor. I was laughing. Not one of those slight giggles. My sides were burning. I could not breath. The car in the game was totaled on the opposite side of the street in pieces. I spend a good minute or two laughing, finally catching myself to retrieve my controller from the floor. I would resume my journey across Hollywood, but to this day I break at hills. Just in case.

1364516806.0,11,self.gametales,1b7n4a,Resistance (GMod HL2RP),11,0,0,http://www.reddit.com/r/gametales/comments/1b7n4a/resistance_gmod_hl2rp/,"I started on CasualBananas Roleplay, the IP being 74.63.210.181:27015

Like most people in HL2RP; I wound up as Tyler Jones, a citizen who was dragged into anti-civil activities very quickly. There's a area named District 6 - Which is the Resistance Area but the Combine prevent people going in, and usually send in taskforces to kill people inside, thankfully, the resistance was strong and managed to fend these off for a long time.

He began his life off the train in City 45, a city run by the City Administrator Dr. Nathan Smalley, Dr. Blake Sweetwater and Dr. Anney Jackson, a small group of puppets controlled by the combine. Tyler eventually was sick of the beatings, murders, amputations and cruelty of the life in the City, and so Tyler Jones ended up one day taking a trip through the disgusting sewers, emerging in District 6.

Now then, this is the part most people don't survive, every few days, a sweep would happen, sometimes twice a day, depending on how they felt or how much trouble the rebels were causing, most citizens got captured and executed (Permakilled and then had to make a new character) because they had a unloaded 9mm or something. Anyhow, he joined up as a refugee for the City 45 Lambda Movement, helping them out and sitting as a door guard for about 2 weeks with his 9mm, eventually during a D6 sweep, he managed to swipe a shotgun off a Combine Officer's corpse with some ammo bought from a local gun dealer. He made about 5000 tokens working for Lambda with multiple missions.

Before he joined up with Lambda as a official resistance member, he had a group named Traceless Shadow, with the team of Benny Jenkins, Skylar McFarly, Lilly Maylin, Phoenix Black, John Ontaro and David Jackson, they fought the combine during sweeps. But during another D6 sweep, Tyler was captured by the elite Overwatch Transhuman Arm and 2 Combine Units, being dragged to the nexus by force after fighting a JUDGE unit (The people who run the detainment block, the prison cells and the amputation room which is execution.)
Being a supposed rebel armed with a shotgun and wearing Heavy Kevlar, they interrogated him, writing down fake information, the JUDGE went away for a second. Tyler slipped his ties off, and took his shotgun and pulse rifle from the crate, the JUDGE unit came back, his brains then splattered the floor. Tyler had a few undercovers working as 'Combine', and broke him out of the nexus, being one of the few on the server to do so, it was a tedious task, having to break through the Combine's Headquarters.

After that, Tyler returned to D6, running through the Plaza area, using the secret sewer entrance to defect. He had a quick reunion with the Traceless Shadow team, and fought off more waves of combine forces, then taking a combine hostage and forcing him to work for them. The combine was hunted down, tracked to our secret Boiler Room, and 3 unmarked GHOST units pinned us down, killing everyone who was helping but our small group, which there was 10 others backing us up. The GHOST are an elite operative group, designed to take on SEVERAL resistance members alone, armed with everything but .357s and pulse rifles (This includes Crossbows, RPGs.)

Now, Tyler eventually crossed the wrong man, The Shade, the shade was a tough man, the only resistance to be armed with a Crossbow and had a killcount of over 200 combine, being impressive for a SINGLE character. The Shade was also an assassin. Tyler Jones left Traceless Shadow, the group shattered, and Tyler was stabbed by his former associate, Skylar in the back, literally. Tyler Jones had managed to get a interview with Xavier Flanders, the Lambda Leader, the prestigious resistance commander (To some, a manwhore to others because he was a ladies man)

As a Lambda, he helped Xavier and Chris Thompson retrieve a Black Box from a Helicopter, handing it to Maria North, the head tech of the Lambda Movement, the wife of Jedediah North. He also had captured a target of Xavier Flanders, Luke McCarthy, but out of forgiveness, Xavier spared him and handed Tyler 3000 tokens. But Tyler's story ended as he took several weapons from The Rising Sun Remnant Cache, a contract was put on his head for a mere 300 tokens, and Shade accepted, hunting him down and then ending his eventful life with a single M24 bullet.

Alot of great events happened on this server, and I will be posting more, this was over a small 3 week time period.

After Great Grandfather Donchad 'The Young' passed away, things started to get very shaky. My grasp on the crown of Jerusalem had never been very firm. The religious and cultural differences, as well as the massive distance penalty, meant that my Middle Eastern holdings were in a near-constant state of rebellion. On top of this, I had invested a number of Irish Lords with Duchies in Jerusalem, and unwisely had given them the surrounding Counties as well. This meant that, despite my near-draconian level of Crown Authority, they were capable of raising serious armies at a moment's notice, and splashing them time and again against the walls of Jericho. (The cities and castles of the region are very heavily fortified (at least compared to young Ireland), so they couldn't actually *take* any of my territory, but they could keep me constantly distracted, ferrying thousands of men back and forth from Erin to the Holy Land.)


They couldn't, that is, until one of them (a great-uncle or something named Murchad) got the brilliant idea to ask the Sultan of Syria for help. Suddenly, instead of Irish armies of one or two thousand, I had 25,000 infidels marching on Baalbek.


Then, just as things were really starting to cook, Donchad of Ireland, Wales, and Jerusalem finally passed away at age 72. 'The Young' indeed!


Donchad already had a grandson, and my laws of primogeniture succession meant that all my titles would pass to him. So at age 27, Gabran 'The Kind' took the Triple Crown.


The fact that Gabran was known as 'The Kind' shows that, despite the Darkness of the Age, technological advancement in the field of irony was proceeding apace. Gabran was not Kind. Arbitrary, Craven, Slothful, Wrothful, Cruel, and Paranoid, yes... but not Kind.


To paraphrase Frank Herbert, beginnings are the fragilest time. And the passing on of crowns is like a relay race using a house of cards as the baton. So, yeah.


The implosion of the Kingdom of Jerusalem picked up speed. The few Middle Eastern Lords with whom I didn't have Truces rebelled at once. And just to add some more meat to the stew, they kept inciting my IRISH vassals to join in as well!


In a way, it's a good thing when disloyal nobles throw caution to the winds and rebel. It gives me an excuse to jail them, revoke their titles, and install loyaler subjects in their place. But when half of Erin rebels simultaneously, where do you raise the armies to fight against them?


(In a word: Wales. I'm not sure why, but my Welsh holdings are able to raise very large levies, and you don't want to mess with the Perfwedlndeydlnwfaweadnlednaeffeafanedwddfeewddalendwnedfndfanedfndffaewwedfndeadefnaean Infantry. They'll slaughter you before you finish reading their name.)


My basic mistake, I was now realizing, was that I'd invested too much power in my Dukes. OF COURSE the Irish Lords of Ascalon and Outrejordain were revolting: they could practically taste that Jerusalem crown!


The Sultan of Syria had Baalbek under siege. I was too busy stamping out insurrections in my own back yard to do anything about it. The Templars and Hospitallers refused to help out, since as a new King I had almost no Piety in the bank. I couldn't afford enough merc armies to defeat the Sultan, and anyway I was starting to realize the basic impossibility of reigning over Jerusalem while based in Ireland.


The situation was deteriorating. Panic was rising. Then... disaster!


Gabran the Kind took an arrow to the knee in a back-yard scuffle with some uppity Earl! He was rendered Incapable, utterly demolishing my State Stats (Intrigue, Diplomacy, etc.) Without a tenable Stewardship score, I was unable to manage my extensive Demesne holdings, leading to greater dissatisfaction among my vassals, and even more chance of rebellions! It was starting to feel like a good old Dwarf Fortress Despair Spiral.


Then... the death blow.


My great-great-uncle (or whatever) Murchad of Baalbek got me Excommunicated.

RELOAD AUTOSAVE


Okay... rewind the clock a few months... how do I prevent the COMPLETE AND UTTER OBLITERATION OF HOUSE AU CHEINNSELAIG.


Think, Gabran, think!


Oh... wait a minute...


Ha! In THIS timeline, Gabran the Kind dies of his wounds! I guess his knee got infected!!


Okay, okay, now I have ANOTHER new King... but he hasn't even come of age yet! Which means he hasn't picked a profession... which means I don't know what his highest Stat is going to be...


Come on, Stewardship! Come on, Indrechtach I, become a professional bean-counter!

birthday approaching...


wars everywhere...


threat of a full-blown succession crisis...


YES! Indrechtach has come of age and gained the Trait, ""Midas Touched"", giving him +9 (!!!) Stewardship and wiping out most of the Demesne Size penalty!


Okay, let's quickly marry him off... okay, in the entire world, where's the woman who's best at math??


Italy? Okay!


Of course she'll accept! Who wouldn't want to be Queen of Ireland, Wales, and Jerusalem? (Even though I admit the throne of Jerusalem, in defiance of known laws of balance, needs bits of paper stuck under ALL FOUR of its legs to stop it from wobbling.)


NICE! Okay, between my wife and myself, we can just about manage my huge personal demesne without enraging all the vassals... but I still have too many Duchies... and the Pope doesn't like me much, so I'm still vulnerable to excommunication... and all of Jerusalem is going to explode just as soon as these Truces expire in a few years...


Umm...


Wait a minute...


What the hell was the point of these Crusades anyway? I mean officially? Surely not to give unmanageable power to some random jumped-up King far away from Rome, right? I mean, I know that historically, plenty of knights used the Crusades as an excuse to set themselves up with some sweet Middle Eastern real estate.. but what they were SUPPOSED to do was... OF COURSE!!!


Hey Your Holiness, I've got a present for you!


""Grant Landed Title"" ""Duchy of Jerusalem""


""Grant Landed Title"" ""Duchy of Ascalon""


""Grant Landed Title"" ""Duchy of Outrejordain""


HA! Insurrection in Hebron? A monstrous Syrian army at the gate? The Shia Caliph AND the Sunni Caliph sniffing around for weakness? ALL THE POPE'S PROBLEM NOW.


And maybe now I can FINALLY get around to uniting the British Isles, which was my only real ambition when I started out!


Okay, let's get ready to march on-


""Pope Whatsisname has died. All hail Pope Whosits!""


WHAT?!?!?!?!?


ARGH!


Okay, so there goes all that Papal Love. But... what's this? The new Pope is Ambitious... what does that bode?


A new crusade?? Already??? And for....... LEON?!?!? THAT'S RIGHT ACROSS THE STREET!


Okay, this time it's something worth holding on to! HAHAHA SOON HALF OF IBERIA WILL BE MINE!!

The PS2 HDD were clearanced down to insane levels.. $20 and you got the PS2 HDD and FFXI.  

So I grabbed it, Installed it, waited 36 hours for it to patch and hopped in the game!  

Made myself a Elvaan Warrior, and started running around Sandoria. Went outside to start killing rabbits. worked my way up to some tougher rabbits, when I happened across this moogle in the middle of a field.  

I went up to it and it offered me a quest to go and kill ""something"" So I accepted. I ran off to look for this enemy. I happened upon a giant tree. and attempted to kill it. I was quickly wiped out.  

I laughed about it in region chat. and everyone asked me where I was killed.   

It turns out a lot of people were looking fot this tree. I gave them the grid locationa I was at when I died. And 100's of people ran that way.   

I figured this would be a good chance for me to join them and kill the tree also.  

Not so much. It released an AOE and killed me in 1 shot. I ran over there again thinking it was just a lucky shot.. and the moment I got there I was killed again.  

Ok no biggy. I am not ready for this. I will go and kill more rabbits.  

Zone chat is exploding at this point with everyone fighting the tree. Suddenly Everyone in zone chat starts saying the same thing.  

""Where did he go?""  
""Where is the tree?""  
""Does anyone see the tree?""  

Suddenly I hear a  *Teleportation sound* next to me. I turn to look and there stands the giant tree. way across the zone near the level 2 rabbits.  

He promptly kills me.  

I respawn and notice in chat they have found him again, ad have started fighting him. I laugh it off as a crazy coincidence and head to another part of the zone to grind.  

However, once again the battle chat fades, and is spammed with everyone looking for the tree again.  

You guessed it.  

*Teleportation sound*  

And guess who is standing next to me again?  

Giant head bashing Tree.  

I die for a 5th time that day. I log off and call it a day.

1367983036.0,9,self.gametales,1dwray,[Spirit of the Century] Major Sam Gears and the Aven Shiskabobs,11,2,2,http://www.reddit.com/r/gametales/comments/1dwray/spirit_of_the_century_major_sam_gears_and_the/," To start, Major Samantha ""Sam"" Gears is the Spirit Centurion of Flight. Who stands as my favorite tabletop character to this day. Sam was prone to a lot of funny and amazing feats action. This one is one of my personal favorites.

We were in the Congo going for a last attempt at finding Sam's lost mentor Brigadier General Robert Gray and his two right hand men. Along for the ride was Robert Gray's grandson Brandon (Sam's love interest). He had uncovered new clues and insisted on coming along for this trip. 

Earlier in the session we had, quite literally, fallen over Robert Gray's skeleton and met one of the two missing squadron mates Edgar Lee. After calming down Edgar we learned several facts about their disappearance and that a race of sentient birdmen called Avens had taken the third man, Albert Malthus, to Gorilla Khan's secret jungle hide out.

Right around this time several spear wielding Avens ambushed us. My three friends were busy with a pair of Avens, while I took on one (Aven1) and Edgar took on another (Aven 2). A fifth Aven (Aven 3) showed up and grabbed Brandon. Brandon, being a simple business man, couldn't break the Aven's grip as it started to fly up into the jungle canopy.

While I raged at the kidnapping of Sam's Not-Boyfriend my fellow players pointed out this was the last fight of the night and I hadn't used my fate points yet.

I then threw every following fate point I could justify into my next roll. Which was admittedly a pretty decent roll. The DM amused at my detailed plan of climbing the trees and tackling the bird trying to make off with Brandon let me get away with a couple shaky reasons for why I can do X. And probably because he wanted this session to end on an epic high note. 

He declared I had *Super Succeeded* my Athletics roll to accomplish my plan and this is what happened.

Sam bolted up the vine covered trees like a monkey all while being chased by Aven 1. She roared ""LET HIM GO!!"" with a flying leap from the treetop and managed to tackle Aven 3 flying off with Brandon mid-air. Her tackle knocked Brandon loose while she and Aven 3 crashed into Aven 1. Aven 1's spear fatally stabbed Aven 3, barely missing the enraged foul-mouthed pilot. All three of them plummeted through the canopy and came to a crashing halt atop Aven 2. Aven 2 accidentally shiskabobed Aven 1 in return for being crushed to death by the other two. Sam was sent tumbling to the side uninjured.

Standing up Sam snarled pointing at the trio of dead birdman ""And don't you *ever* fucking touch Brandon again!""

As for poor Brandon? He was stuck tangled up in some vines but fine. He solemnly swore to never accompany Sam on her adventures again. We got him and Edgar bustled off to our pseudo base camp at an archaeological dig before digging deeper into the jungle to find Khan and Albert Malthus.",Tabletop,False,self,t5_2wqgc,False,table,,True,t3_1dwray,http://www.reddit.com/r/gametales/comments/1dwray/spirit_of_the_century_major_sam_gears_and_the/,

This all started because someone misclicked a button in his game client, causing his Titan-class (biggest class, very expensive) ship to jump (move) to the Asakai system instead of bridge (allow other ships without a jumpdrive to use the titan's jumpdrive).

The battle mainly took place between two alliances known as TEST and Goonswarm but lots of others joined in, with a total of over 3000 players active in that solar system.

I have decided to go back to the wilderness.  I need rest.  Rest that will not involve murder of a friend, where no one will be dead.  I’m outside the gates now.  That gnome was no help at all.  Amnesia, apparently.  He was pretty tall for a gnome.  His name was Varis.  

But, I digress.  It’s been two days since the incident.  I might as well start from the top.

We had the mercenary caught, and Easy Torinn ended up knocking out the nervous man who had been helping him.  We decided to split up: I would go with Torinn back to Indriss’s home, and Branimir and Zaharia would stay at the Silk Whispers and look for more clues.  

We arrived at the house, concealing daggers just in case, with the mercenary and nervous man with us.  We came right up to Indriss.  The noble paled at the sight of the nervous man.  “Do you know who this is?!  You could get us all killed!” he said.  I turned.  I had never met the man before.  

Indriss went on to explain that this ‘nervous man’ was the advisor to the king of Salthirn.  And we had blown his cover, as he was trying to sneak into the mercenary group.  It didn’t matter now, he said.  I showed Indriss some of the things the mercenary had: a strange sword that was dubbed a ‘straight sword’ that looked like a regular blade, only with a second blade on the back, with metal linking the two.  The mercenary also had three glass orbs: Two black, and one blue.  These looked like the orbs the mercenary had used to set the inn on fire.  

The mercenary, as it turns out, was a race known as the Yvan’Shul, an ancient people who had cracked, white skin that bled poison and were constantly in pain.  Torinn threatened the Yvan’Shul, and drew his knife.  He was promptly arrested.  The Yvan’Shul refused to say anything about himself when I interrogated him with the steward.  We got into arguments, and I was getting very angry.

Then something cracked in my head.  Something… I don’t know, snapped, because as I was staring at him, I thought he was the nicest man I've ever seen.  I decided to leave, content that he was perfectly innocent.  I heard him then, seizing the chance, kick the table we were using to interrogate him into the steward.  

I also inspected the straight sword to see if it had any magical effects.  Somebody must’ve slipped something into my drink that morning, because I thought the sword would heal whomever it stabbed.  Just then, I saw Branimir run up, yelling something about the goddess Zythra.  I showed him the sword, and cut a deep gash across his chest that did not heal.

We were arrested due to drawing weapons.  We were in the jail for the rest of the day, but somebody higher up paid a lot to get us out.  Probably the same person who stole our ring.  Anyhow, we were released and went back to the Sleeping Lion, where we, well slept.
	
Except for Zaharia.  He wasn’t arrested because he was apparently chasing the advisor, who ran off at the mention of Zythra.  Branimir had looked through the advisor’s journal, and found the last few logs were about dreaming of the goddess.  He was obviously distressed, but for some reason Torinn wasn’t.  

Zaharia managed to find his way back early in the morning.  For some reason Torinn had found a flower, eaten part of it, spit it out, and made the innkeeper eat it.  I decided to leave the inn to wander for a while, browsing through the wares… got in a street fight with some bandit… and I came back at the same time as Easy Torinn.  

There were guards all over the place, and they said a Dwarf had been murdered, and the culprit was none other than Zaharia, but Zaharia couldn't be the culprit… and the Dwarf Zaharia murdered…

…Was Branimir. 

Something wasn’t right with Easy Torinn.  He didn’t seem as broken as I was about Branimir’s death, like he expected it… but he was sincere… I didn’t know what to think at the time.  I went to the temple of the Raven Queen to properly mourn Branimir’s death, and met a very tall gnome with red eyes and a mask there.  His name was Varis, and he decided to tag along.  

We couldn’t get the journal until the body was complete for last rites.  I managed to get it at the guard barracks, but left Branimir’s armor and warhammer.  

As I was looking through Branimir’s things (it would be a waste to leave the trail rations behind) I noticed a note.  What it said will haunt me for the rest of my life:

“Where’s your Queen now?” –E.T.

I knew it.  I always did.  Torinn somehow managed to kill Branimir, and frame Zaharia.  Zaharia was actually on death row, but our friend got him transferred over to a ‘salt mine’ or something.

One thing is clear, though: I’m going back to the wilderness.  These last few days in Dodaca have been horrid.  I don’t think I can ever return.  I’m keeping the sword.  It will be a constant reminder of Torinn…

And how I’m going to end him.

**Note:** I don't remember much of the actual dialog

It is a bright sunny day at the bandit camp. The morning patrol has just left and things are looking good. Life has been good to you, you found a group of fairly competent men and a good place to set up camp, plenty of forest to run away into if your men notice any guards coming.Soon you hear a commotion outside. Your door bursts open and the three guards of the morning patrol and one of the outer guards come running into your office they are babbling incoherently. You ask them to calm down and tell you what is wrong. You hear a voice just behind you say "" They are trying to tell you about the ghosts."" As soon as you hear this the four men faint."" Now as I told those men to tell you, we are a roaming group of ghosts and we have a deal to make with you. Put quite simply we want you and your group to go and turn yourselves in or I will turn you over to my comrade. Death has made him quite frustrated and I am sure he would *love* to relieve some of his tension."" You don't buy it, in fact this ruse is just making you angry. You call to the voice to show himself and in response the window behind your desk explodes. Then the voice chimes in again "" Well to late seems one of your men is dead and he died rather horribly."" You fling the door open and go running outside to check on your men. Sure enough one of the guardsmen near your office is missing. A commotion arises at the door to your office which has shut and locked of its own accord. You join your men in trying to bust down your own door. As you are doing this some of your other men find the missing guardsmen dead with a perfect empty circle where his ears used to be. You gear up to rush your door. It unlocks and opens like nothing is wrong. You enter the room cautiously and find the four men who came to you earlier all dead with a gaping hole where there right eyes used to be. The voice comes again "" I warned you, now if you value your lives go and turn yourselves in."" All but your three most loyal men flee and you can tell that these three are scared. But you do not fear these ""ghosts"" and you set about berating them and telling them to show themselves. The rest of the windows explode and the door closes and locks yet again. A man clothed in white and pale as fresh snow steps off your windowsill and into the room. As he steps down he watch as he transforms into a creature of shadows and nightmare. He gestures towards the door and your last men run leaving you to stand alone against the shade. You swing your blade at him and feel it connect. You feel a warmth growing around your stomach and look down. There sticking out of you is the blade of a broadsword. You turn your head to see a pair of glowing red eyes and a wicked white grin. You here a perky voice to your right say ""Hi there"". Then it happens. You feel the blow to your knees first as you pitch forward the young elf girl on your left, you feel like you should recognize her but can't tell from where, stabs her blade into your neck. Then the blade in your stomach retracts only to swiftly return and finally the shade in front you steps in and stabs you through the chin. As the last of you life drains away you hear the voice of the gnome who hit you in the knees say ""Don't worry you're his now"" and you feel a little bite on your ear.

I join a few minutes after the round has started and I decide to be a lawyer. Usually, it's a fairly boring job where you don't get to do much, but this time, it became really fun.

So basically, I sit in my office and wait for a job opportunity to show up. Suddenly, I notice someone named Adof Artwald (Or something similar) yelling over the radio about how security is going to arrest him for possessing an illegal weapon. He then spends the next few minutes taunting security over the radio until they finally arrest him. When he's taken into the brig, he's flashed multiple times, strip searched and handcuffed to his bed, all while yelling and making a huge fuss.

He then says that he demands a lawyer, and I show up. He tells me that he wants to sue security for the way they treated him.  I agree to help him. Then, the Head of Security shows up and tells him that they will released him, demote him to Assistant and that if he does something illegal, they will lock him up for the rest of the round. He agrees to this, but he still wants to sue them.

I go back to my office and I begin writing up a lawsuit. While I do this, I notice that he's smashing up his prison cell, and I think ""Oh god..."" to myself. With the lawsuit finished, I stop a security officer and tell him to hand it to his boss, the Head of Security.

A few minutes pass, and then the Head of Security yells over the radio that she wants to speak to me. She tells me that Adof Artwald had assaulted numerous people and possessed illegal weapons, and that they were just doing their job, even if it included some violence.

I tell her that it's terrible that he did all those things, but that he still wants to sue for unfair treatment. I also get informed that he's been locked up in the permabrig (a higher-security prison) because he couldn't behave when released.

A few more minutes pass, and then he breaks out of the permabrig, and the guards go nuts. I don't see too much, but there's running and yelling and weapons being fired. After a while, I'm told to go meet the Head of Security. She tells me that Adof Artwald has been killed with permission from the captain.

After that, a Brainrot virus broke out and infected most of the station, and I guess the entire round went to shit, but I had to leave before it ended.

I was on the city square looking for something to do. Had been hanging out with fellow noobs who were coming of age in the game. After a few successful raids we were looking for trouble and a guy showed up and asked ""Hey, want to go beat up some punks in the metro?"". The metro tunnels is not a friendly place but is far from extreme so we said ""sure, why not"". 

This job was not trivial but the guy who invited us knew his stuff. We had a briefing meeting and organized the party pretty well. Everybody knew what to do and we entered the metro station as a solid unit.

We ripped through all the lesser punks in the station and we went deeper, deeper into a crack in the wall that led to the mutant punks hideout. The calm voice of the team leader kept us steady as we went further down the hideout tunnels, which grew darker and narrower. We started to feel a bit claustrophobic as we went down a seemingly endless spiral stair but it was all OK as we kept on blowing through the resistance.

Then we hit the bottom, a dark cavern. ""Now what? Where's the loot?"" We were too deep already and started feeling anxious. Some were wounded, none badly, but definitely not in the mood for surprises. Amidst the darkness of the deep hideout, one of us found an opening in the wall and in he went... a couple of minutes passed...

SCREAMS OF TERROR came out of the darkness and soon after came the guy darting at full speed ""WHAT HAPPENED?"" we asked. ""AARHAA RUNRUN AAAAAHaahh h..."" he said as he raced up the endless stairs towards the exit to the station.

Disconcerted, some ran, others stayed. I stayed and then I saw him stepping in the light. He must have been twice the size as the tallest of us: A huge punk motherfucker with a green mohawk carrying a hammer or a gatling gun or something deadly. I saw the team leader fly and hit the wall in an agonizing cry ""SAVE YOURSELVES"" was his last yell.

We screamed like schoolgirls and scrambled in a blur of terror. Ran up the stairs without looking back, stepping on each other as the punk motherfucker kept decimating us. You could hear them fall behind you. Every man for himself.

The endless stairs seemed virtually infinite. Punk bastard stepping on our heels. We ran for our lives, made dizzy by the spiral path of the stairs. Eventually, some of us made it out the crack in the wall and into the metro station where the first guy was waiting.

Panting, we counted our losses. Of about 12 guys who entered the hideout only 4 remained. We calmed down and started hearing about our friends who respawned on the city square. Onlookers puzzled by the ruckus. Now safe, we started to laugh in relief.

Then the Punk Motherfucker from Hell came out the crack in the wall and killed us all...

We then learned he went on a rampage and killed every player in the metro station who wasn't lucky to get out.

Gah, this futing journal.  Why do I write in you still?  There is some comfort in writing down your thoughts, though Lilmora at this point has gotten to read this book…

It started after we got our share of gold from the pirate ship, courtesy of Beriix, who scouted out the pirate ship.  We abandoned that one, apparently.  A shame, too.  It looked like a good seaworthy vessel. 

We went through the day, inspecting the daggers of the casters of Zythra.  We weren’t going to use them anytime soon, though it was tempting.  It was obvious to everyone on board that they were powerful.  The pirates were tied to the mast, to await their interrogation and prompt execution at the port of Dravocus.  They glared at us the whole time.  Zaharia was severely injured during the fight with the pirates, so he was downstairs having his wounds tended to.

The last few days have passed uneventfully, as we ended up looking into the life of Hamilton, who was sure to become the next master of arms of the Unflinching, had he not died.  He was loved by all, with a wife and children at home, even though his second home was the ocean.

We heard a scream, however.  A scream so loud it would have penetrated the sounds of even Dodaca.  We rushed down to see Zaharia in my quarters, clutching his arm.  My journal was right next to him, and I reached down to pick it up.

How could I have been so foolish?  The poison started eating away at my arm, slowly going up my shoulder.  I have never felt worse agony, and I screamed for Varis to cut off the pain.  The Elf obliged. 

I had a dream while I was unconscious, while Lilmora and the guards treated my wounds and interrogated everyone on board.  I was in a giant, golden room, with white braziers full of fire.  I noticed behind me Zaharia, Branimir, and Easy Torinn.  They were ethereal, like ghosts, and followed exactly a few steps behind me as I walked over…

There was a… bowl in the middle.  I went over to it, and looked in.  The liquid showed me events from the past, present, and future and the strange voice from before returned, once again telling me I was going to need strength…

And then I awoke, agony coming back as I realized my arm was gone.  Zaharia was dead too, his body getting put into the ocean much like Hamilton.  We had spotted land, Lilmora had said.  The initial shock of losing my arm, my left arm, was gone.  I’m probably never going to get it back…

A thin Dwarf walked up, showing us to our temporary home, telling us a bit about the city, called Hipporaemus.  
	
So here I am now, in the ‘living room,’ the Dwarf had said.  We are expecting an audience with the Commander of Hipporaemus, and should be in his presence in a couple of days.

This Kilnriv that I’ve been recently wielding has been incredibly useful, faster and more versatile than my spear.  I’m keeping the spear, though.  Too many memories that I want to remember.  Vengeance is a strong thing, as I’ve observed in Lilmora.

1375763360.0,7,self.gametales,1jsi8u,[DW-Original] Intro: The Magi,10,3,4,http://www.reddit.com/r/gametales/comments/1jsi8u/dworiginal_intro_the_magi/,"So, I've been asked to post some of the crazy stuff that happens in some of the games I run in Dungeon World (original 1990 version not 2010 version) 

The Most recent set of events are from the team we shall call ""The Magi"" or as I like to call them ""how does this work - BOOM""

It all started back some time ago, A Dark-Elven Slave, who showed some magical talent was taken on as primary slave by his Skaven Necromancer Master, Unbeknownst to the Master, it was exactly at this time that the Skaven Masters decided to oust their bretheren and replace him with another..

Backstory.. Another Player in a set of events previously, have formed skaven councils of Dark Magi, 12 in each council, to raise an undead army and attack the human cities, along the way, they captured and enslaved small villages of humans, dark elves and elves alike.. the dark-elves survived the horrors longest.

So, Hello to the character: Terroz, Dark elf slave.

Terroz was now placed (at the start of the campaign) as head of Clan-Poison Moon's slaves, just as the other masters had plot to kill off Poison Moon's master, which would give the player the impetus to escape, and steal some of his masters items and begin his adventure.

But No.. As soon as the dagger pierced the masters heart, killing him, Terroz, claimed rightful inheritance of the masters position. (ooh Kay, so how do I now bring in the rest of the party???)

So, The masters, in a fit of rage, demand proof that this upstart was capable of being a master.. 

Using a dagger(from the now dead master) of a demon soul, he stabbed the slave that attacked him, drawing out a random demon.. a Teifling.. (welcome character II) Proving that he was chosen by the great master, to become the new master of clan -poison moon.

trapped into the rules of their own making, the masters conceded. and so the reign of Terroz, Slave Master of clan poison moon, began.

And what a reign it was.. for the next few years, (in an effort to learn quickly) slaves of poison moon were found after each encampment, bloodied, bruised, poisoned, multi-poisoned, or just lifeless for unexplainable reasons. As Terroz tried (and failed) multiple times, to create poisons, worthy of clan poison. 

Lucius, the Teifling.. on the other hand, stripped of his normal powers from the world he came from, attempted to do other strange things. 

From attempting to summon golems, other demons, being attacked by undead (of their own) and constantly failing at magic (and almost burning down tents, camps, food stores and other things) Finally, Lucius left the camps and went to find some place to be safer.. but in order to find his way back, he decided to leave some kind of path... a cobblestone path.. in hilly regions... for 35km... 

18 months later.... .. to be continued.

For over an hour and a half I killed and killed, spawn camping my own team and when I was bored I would go charge the enemy base, my allies aiding me at first in their effort to play the game normally and then turning on me in this blood feud I had instigated.

Other players truly hated me but something prevented them from leaving, a thirst for revenge I suppose, never more evident that when one of my ""allies"" changed his tag to I_Hate_Brick_Bungalow. Like that was going to stop me.

I wish this story had a bang of an ending, but after another 20-30 min of fun, an admin showed up and banned me for teamkilling, on a server that allowed teamkilling. I never appealed that ban, because I didn't know how to, and to be fair, I totally deserved it.

So I was basically a cybered out heavyweapons guy, metallic bones, smartlink whatevers, pretty much modded to the nines and of course I had an assault cannon. Now then, on to our run. Our mission was in some hamlet in Germany where we had to break into some castle and steal something that I don't remember. Anyways, before we left the states we could be an unspecified amount of nuyen to smuggle our gear in with us to our little base location in Germany. I was all like ""Screw that, we're gonna have stuff provided for this run anyway so I ain't payin nothin."" So we take one of those low orbit plane things (stop some terrorists) and arrive in Munich. From there we take the train to this town and spend the night in the place requisitioned for us. Some like magicky shit happens when we got there but I don't fucking remember. So, we head up to the castle which is of course, on a mountain. We sneak past/fight some security drones and make our way inside the castle. We probably fought some dudes, and made our way through the floors of this castle stronghold thing and eventually found the item we were looking for. So as we've kinda pissed off everything/everyone else in the castle we only have one way out...
Through the baron/mayor person's private chambers. Spoilers: he was a huge fucking troll. Entire table was nervous as fuck as we rolled to sneak past him, especially my rolls as I'm a chronic shit roller and I was in the heaviest armor. Fortunately we managed to sneak past him and make our way back to Munich with medium incident. On the way back to the states, everyone was pissed at me for how damn cheap I was to not bring my own equipment, to which my response was that I didn't know how much I was gonna be paying for that ish.

Playing old school Vampire: The Masquerade in the global Camarilla Club a few years ago, I was playing an Anarch Gun Dealer.  For those who don't know the ""Anarchs."" are under Camarilla protection and law, but don't believe in Camarilla society.  So they tend to exist outside the law, but follow just enough to not get killed.  I was part of a nomadic motorcycle club, and had arms dealing to my name.  Living in NYC at the time, this was my travelling character.

Anyway, a strapped brother down in Texas was having a lot of trouble with some local Camarilla.  I went to our own online vampire system (I know), and looked for the local Texas Sheriff (the local Prince's head of security).  I told them I was an arms dealer which had many successful dealings before (and I had).  

He didn't ask for references.  He just wanted guns.

So I gave them to 'em.  I had been sure to make gunsmithing an ability on my end, and talked to the local ST to arrange everything.  I sold them weapons alright.  I sold them phosphorous rounds (most powerful ammunition in the game) with detonators hidden in the case.  I sold them guns without accurate sites (-1 Firearms).  I sold them guns made to jam.  Of course there were some legitimate firearms just in case they checked.

They didn't.

I sent the detonators to my Brother in Texas and the ST thanked me for the juicy plotline.

And they never figured it out.

...

#2, not so interesting.  Same Game.  I decided to play my first ""special"" high approval character.  In this case, it was an Assamite Infiltrator.  I gave him a comprehensive backstory and goal.  I gave him a number of different personas.

I show up to game in army fatigues, aviator sunglasses, and a cuban military hat with a red star on it.  I come in, and let people make assumptions about my character.  Immediately they had me pegged as Brujah (the rebellious warrior scholars).  When asked about my family, I told them to be more cautious of the Masquerade, and said that I was a ""Warrior"" (Brujah Nicknames are Warrior Scholar).  They directed me to the Brujah Primogen (local leadership).

...who'd just been placed as Prince unbeknownst to me and everyone there.  So there was a debate (Brujah are more idealistic).  I won.  I was Brujah Primogen (to be fair, there wasn't a lot to choose from and it's not the kind of job you volunteer for).  From then on, if asked what family I was from, I could say ""I'm the Brujah Primogen and not found to be lying thorugh lie detection powers.  

I played the shit out of this character.  He remained Primogen for a number of months.  I had conflicts with the Tremere primogen (Tremere and Assamites don't get along), and even called him a ""Usurper"" which is the Assamite nickname for a Tremere and one they don't hear too often.  Then resigned to be the Prince's personal bodyguard (after revealing myself to him, he gave me an ultimatum). I needed the protection - I succumbed to the Assamite's weakness and attempted to diablerize (drink) another Tremere, but played it off as if I was just ""thirsty"".

And I did this all through social engineering and skill.  No combat powers used, minimal combat powers actually learned.

...
3.

I played in an unaffilliated LARP in NYC, set at the turn of the 20th Century in NYC.  The plot was the Sabbat (the Camarilla's louder, less civilized rival) coming into the city and taking it over.  We were handed pregenerated characters - mine was an Eastern European Tremere.  Now the Tremere are racist and sexist, according to their own clan book.  At the turn of the 20th century I'd imagine worse.  I was told I was the head of the local coven, and I had an assistant - a woman.

After clearing it with the other players, I played up the sexism and racism.  In one case, two visiting Gangrel were of Native American descent.  I immediately suspected them for being Sabbat as - well - their background.  Gangrel were generally nomadic, sure, but they wouldn't have taken just any blood, would they (in character at least). I also began talking to them about ""Native American mysticism"" which was pure racism on my character's part, and the Tremere tend to look for new sources of magic.  I spent nearly all my time talking with / interrogating them.

Back to my assistant.  Every time she came to me, I sent her off on another meaningless task.  This (as it should have) pissed her off quite a bit.  I reminded her of her place often, and told her if she wanted to do something else, she had to prove herself.

Turned out both the Gangrel and the assistant were Sabbat infiltrators.  She'd been tasked to get me alone and assassinate me.  She couldn't, *because I kept sending her off to do stuff*.  

The Gangrel?  Well they *were* Sabbat scouts.  I *was* right about their heritage.  I was the *only one* suspecting them.  

The STs stepped in and had a deus ex machina for the second night.  It sucked because it happened as soon as I started playing that night, but they had another character for me raring to go (sabbat infiltrator).  The death of my character was supposed to be a major event, and it just kept not happening.

I should mention that if you know my previous submissions I am the opposite of sexist and racist.  I made sure to confer with the players and explain what i was doing was in character, and if I made them uncomfortable I would stop.  I know this doesn't account for everything, but that was my style of play back then (nearly 10 years ago), and I got this story out of it.",Table,False,self,t5_2wqgc,False,table,,True,t3_1b1l95,http://www.reddit.com/r/gametales/comments/1b1l95/this_one_time_while_larping_as_a_vampire/,

We decided to recollect ourselves at an inn in Sagon.  The guards watched over Zaharia and Lilmora.  The most logical path to take was to travel back to Dodaca.  The guards and soldiers were very angry at Lilmora, as they killed off almost all of the ‘Echipa,’ which is apparently a military squad.  After a brief argument, we had settled everything: Lilmora was to be executed for her crimes, even though she told use everything about the mercenary leader, Drake, and the large man who had led the attack, Yuleth.  Zaharia, on the other hand, was considered insane, so he wouldn't be charged.  We’re still keeping an eye on him, though.

We started the trek back to Dodaca, and along the way, we met a group of armed men.  They seemed overly kind, but I could smell the danger, and all of us drew our weapons.  I tried to flank the bandits during the battle.  However, they had traps set in the grass, and I fell down a pit.  

Luckily no one noticed, as they were concentrated on the battle, and I easily leapt up to my feet and jumped out of the pit, though my bones I remember were still a bit sore. 

The bandits were ferocious, and gave no quarter, injuring all of us.  We could tell that they would kill us all if they had the chance, so we fought harder than they did.  One by one, the bandits fell.  The last one started fleeing, but we realized he would return for revenge.  So I rushed over, roaring in victory.  I had already killed one of the running bandit’s companions, and I was in a triumphant rage.  

The bandit didn't stand a chance.  The others had surrounded him, but the bandit had dodged them.  But not me.  He couldn’t stand my powerful, final assault.  

It was then I noticed that a few guards and Lilmora were in more pit traps, Lilmora barely managed to dodge the wooden spikes in one of them, though she was scraped up.  We helped her up, and she gave a dagger back to one of the guards. 

We made it to Dodaca, Lilmora going to jail, while Varis, Zaharia, and I went to the palace for a war council.  Zaharia was left outside, as he wasn't feeling good.  Something happened to him in the mines Lilmora told me about, as the Deva believes himself to be a Dragonborn, just like Torinn.

The news of Haldren Indriss’s death took a big toll.  Indriss supplied most of the money and soldiers to the Salthirn military, and it would be difficult to get those resources back.  As a result, we’ve decided to go to two separate countries that owe us favors: Mordecai and Dravocus.  The one who suggested Dravocus was an Admiral Le Suta Lanyit.  So it was decided that Varis, Zaharia, and I would accompany the spymaster to Dravocus.  I realized that Lilmora would end up being an asset, as she is a noble, and her diplomacy skills are unrivaled.  

There is something about her, as well.  She wants revenge, and she seems to have a good heart, even if she joined with Drake.  She is a good fighter as well, as I saw during the fight in Sagon.  So I asked to free her from prison, getting permission to do so.

During the way out, the spymaster stopped me, saying she recognized me.  I, however, did not recognize her.  This will require some thought…

We’re on the ship now, sailing the ocean, since it will be far faster and we’re running out of time.  Everyone else has already gone to sleep for the night.  Might as well stop the log here.

""Well there was some chatter on TR radio about a campfire a couple clicks from the Bio-dome they were attacking."" Hicks glared at me. 

The roar of the galaxy got closer. We left the cave and lit a flare. It was so close yet so far, we are finally going home! Maybe I can spend some credits to optimize my weapon. 

Before the galaxy landed we heard the roar of a fleet of galaxys and liberators and fighters. Unknown to the infiltrator the TR were ammassing an attack on the bio-dome and were passing right by us. 2 fighters zoomed by and blew up the galaxy. ""Get back in the cave!"" The galaxy was crashing down towards us. It was getting closer and closer. ""Common Sir hurry up!"" I got into the cave just in time.

Four days I’ve been alone.  Four days with these voices in my head, mocking me.  The voices are Branimir, Torinn, and Zaharia, taunting me, distracting me from my hunting.  I nearly died the other day, fighting a crocodile.  I had to recover my wounds from that fight.  I managed to kill a deer though, cooking it up as food that could last me for quite a while.  

I was at my small camp in the night when I heard the sound of axes hitting wood.  I decided to investigate, sneaking over to the sound.  

It was a variety of soldiers from the Salthirn military, border patrol guards, honor guards, and many more.  An odd bunch, even more so when I saw they had the dead look in their eyes, just like Berix when he was enthralled. 

I immediately got my camp packed up, the voices in my head still taunting me, calling me a failure and the like, and started on my way to Mayce, and then perhaps later back to Dodaca to track down Berix.  It took me a few days to get there, and the sight of Mayce was horrifying.

The small city was burning.  Soldiers were inside, I could see.  I could hear the shouts of war, screams from civilians, and houses falling to the ground.  I had to get in, which wasn’t hard.  

The only house that was relatively undamaged was larger than the rest, and I knocked on the door.  I had to step back rather quickly, and was relieved at the sight of Marx, though the Goblin looked rather disheveled.  He let me in, and explained the situation.

A variety of soldiers from the military had come, and Marx had thought they were a military convoy, since Mayce is near the border.  The soldiers, who turned out to be enthralled, cut down half of Marx’s force and started destroying the city.  Vines had erupted, signaling Zythra’s return.   The remaining civilians were starting to evacuate, so we had to hold off any enthralled soldiers until all the civilians were out.

So we went out the back way, and put up a formation, ready for the onslaught.  

An onslaught it was, and I was right in the middle of it all.  In the middle of the battle, a massive bunch of vines turned into… something.  A vine horror?  It restrained almost all of us, but a few of us, including me, managed to get free.  The vine horror stayed around for quite a while, before being put down by the guards. 

During the battle, I found myself in the remains of one of the houses, fighting a soldier on the outside.  However, more enthralled surrounded me.   I was already fairly injured during the battle, but it was now a four vs. one fight, and not in my favor.  I had no time to think, and I was on the ground, unconscious.  

While unconscious, the voices, which had been quiet due to my concentration in the battle, returned.  Mocking me about my deeds in the past.  But then my mother appeared, pointing at the desk.  I looked, and understood.  I couldn’t die now.  Melora had other plans right now.

My eyes snapped open, and I crawled over to the desk, finding the strange crystal which controlled the enthralled.  I tried smashing it with my hands, to no avail.  The enthralled heard me, and attacked me.  However, my stamina was sufficient enough, and I smashed the crystal with the butt of my spear, shattering it into millions of pieces. 

Like last time, every living enthralled soldier crumpled, unconscious.  I got up, yelling to Marx about what had happened, when we heard the sound of hundreds of soldiers running at us, so we fled, quickly joining the citizens.

I’ve told Marx what’s happened since we left for Dodaca, about Branimir’s death, about Torinn’s betrayal, and Berix.  We’re on the road now.  It will take nearly a week to get there.

Hopefully we will get there without much trouble.

We entered into the Silk Whispers Inn.  The silver haired man was gone, and by the table was Narith’s ring.  I picked it up, and we noticed two men in the inn arguing.  One was the innkeeper, a man with a brown mustache, and the other was obviously a noble who had two intimidating bodyguards with him.

We walked him, seeing if something was the matter, and insulted the man, who left.  As they were walking out, Easy Torinn insulted him behind his back, putting his ball in a fist with the thumb enclosed by the fingers, an apparent sign of disrespect.  One of the bodyguards, however, noticed, and ran over, engaging Easy Torinn in a fist fight.  Even though Torinn had tough scales and claws, he was unable to really do much damage to the bodyguard, who quickly defeated him.  The noble, the whole while, was looking at the fight with a smirk on his face.  

We asked the barkeeper who the noble was, and it was Narith’s father, Haldren Indriss.  We quickly found the location of his home, running over.  We tried to get in, but we didn’t have an appointment.  However, when we told the guard about Narith Indriss, he let us through, albeit with our weapons outside the home.  We objected, saying we would need to defend ourselves in case we were attacked.  The guard laughed, saying no one was ‘stupid’ enough to attack the house of Haldren Indriss.  We did conceal our daggers, though.  

The guard was right.  It was as though Indriss had his own personal pack, armed warriors walking down the halls.  We went into the room Haldren Indriss was in.  He sat upon what seemed to be a throne, with an advisor.  As we walked down, Easy Torinn felt vulnerable, so he asked Zaharia to use his illusions to disguise him. 

The end result was not favorable.  Torinn’s scales were colored with flowers, and he was shouting rude sentences over and over.  He had to be excused out of the room.  We came over to Indriss’s throne, and I told Branimir to leave the room.
	
Branimir did not go out silently, however.  He was shouting for me ‘not to take it out’ and it was putting every guard in the household on edge, as they drew their weapons.  Apparently, Branimir had studied the ring so much that it had addled his Dwarven brains.  He thought that if the ring was produced, it would summon a devil to the mortal realm.  He nevertheless went to join Easy Torinn (who was still yelling rude comments.)

Haldren Indriss was obviously distressed with the news of his son’s kidnapping.  He told us to go see his steward.  While we conferred, Easy Torinn and Branimir recovered from their… illnesses.

It was obvious the steward was hiding something, but we couldn’t exactly tell what.  He said Narith Indriss was last seen with a group of men in the Silk Whispers.  So we decided to leave, taking the ring with us as an assurance we could get back in Indriss’s home.

It was approaching nightfall, so we decided to see just exactly who murdered the boy on the streets.  We went to the temple of the Raven Queen, where we found his body. 

I have not been writing everything of this adventure.  Since we’ve gotten to Dodaca, Easy Torinn has been insulting the gods, including the Raven Queen.  I could tell Branimir was getting impatient with Easy Torinn, and it came to a head in the temple.  As Branimir was searching the body, he noticed the money we had given the boy was gone.

This is why Easy Torinn mentioned about being the boy’s adopted father.  He had lied to the guard to get back the money we had given him.  What Torinn said next did not help matters.

“Oh, here’s your share.” 

A silence followed the Dragonborn’s statement.  Torinn simply stared at me, the money in his hands.  Then Branimir started cursing the Dragonborn, drawing his warhammer.  The priestesses of the temple also attacked Easy Torinn.  Zaharia melted into the shadows, content to watch the fight.  I, however, grabbed Branimir.  This was not going to be an all-out brawl.  I didn’t want to see my newfound friends kill each other.

Easy Torinn threatened Zaharia, who used his illusion powers to make him invisible to one of the priestesses, who ran over to get the guards of the city.  Branimir escaped from my grab, and Easy Torinn realized he was outnumbered, going onto his knees, saying half-condescendingly “I’m sorry.” 
	
Branimir ran over, his warhammer raised above his head..

“You’re not forgiven.” 

And the Dwarf Paladin’s hammer came down on the Dragonborn’s head, dealing a solid blow and knocking Easy Torinn out cold.

We were pretty damn good, not professional good, but good enough to know builds and have pretty high APMs.

Anyways, I was playing a game, it was a 3v3 shared map.  Three of us on the top, vs three people on the bottom.  I was top right, playing protoss.  I had built up a pretty damned big army.  Lots of fully upped dragoons and zealots, and since this was one of the fastest map ever styled maps, I had TONS of extra resources.

So my team starts attacking, and the opposing teams army/defense absolutely slaughters most of our army.  We manage to get some stragglers through after the initial push, and my teammates manage to kill their bottom right player, and destroy everything on that side of the screen.  In the meantime, our top left player gets mostly demolished.  

My two allies are defending our bases, but mostly losing.  I'm trying to rebuild my army but it isn't working.  I quickly make a shuttle, and ferry a fully one down to the bottom right of their base, where we destroyed their teammate.  I immediately go to work making tons of pylons, a nexus, and tons of gateways.  During this time, the enemy has destroyed one of my allies, has the other one in retreat, and is destroying my main base.

I manage to make quite a few gateways, over a dozen and start pumping out full queues of Zealots.  After a couple dozen are made, and a dozen or more are continuing to produce I start pushing wildly westwards, and start absolutely obliterating my enemies' undefended bases, because their entire army is trying to ""find that last damn pylon"" in my old base, having no clue that I have rebuilt on their side of the map.  

My zerg ally manages to squeeze a couple drones into my new base, and has started making zerglings in the mean time, so he is helping with the slaughter.  By the time they managed to get their army back to their side of the base, my zealots numbered almost 3 dozen or more, and had destroyed almost all of the first enemy base, which was Zerg.  

My zealots and teammate's zerglings made short work of the enemy units and started moving in on the last guy, whose race I forget.

We absolutely destroyed them, and it was amazing.  It was the most intense game of Brood Wars I've ever played.  I remember the rush I got when my zealot army came out of FUCKING NOWHERE when they thought they had completely destroyed me, and proceeded to decimate their bases.

There was an attack on the Unflinching today.  Pirates, and something more.  It started when we heard a sudden crash above deck, and got out of bed.  I told everyone to prepare their weapons, and watched as Varis and Zaharia gloomily got up; putting on their armor, Varis drawing his rapier, making sure the point was sharp enough to rip through flesh.  

There was a pirate ship, and they were shooting ballistae shots at us, pirates using grappling hooks to try and get aboard.  Varis and I rushed over, hacking at them with our blades, when the pirate ship suddenly started getting closer, crashing against ours, knocking both of us to our knees. 

I was starting to get up onto my knees when through the wood a massive ballista shot hit me right in my arm, ripping through.  It was pain I have not experience in quite some time.  I got up, dodging and trying to shake myself back into a fighting mood.  Pirates were swarming the Unflinching and the sailors were engaging them.  Varis had gotten up, wrestling a pirate.  The Elf was obviously losing, and the pirate was cackling “You are weak.” 

I got up, grabbing the pirate with both arms, ignoring the pain.  I hoisted him in the air, looking at him in the eye.  Something felt… right about what I said next:

“Pick a god and pray.”

Then I broke the pirate’s back on the side of the ship, and threw him overboard.  

The fight continued, and I was just getting into the fight when I noticed there were a few mysterious people on board the pirate ship.  They were cloaked in a color such a dark brown it was nearly black.  They had… disturbing wooden masks on, carved into demonic faces.  They scare me even now.  Worst off, however, is one raised their hand, teleporting onboard our ship, unleashing vines all around the ship where there were not any before.  They grabbed us, and still another caster shot out green mist that contained poison.  It hit the spymaster and Lilmora, as well as Zaharia. 

I managed to break free of the bonds, and fought more, noticing that a few of our sailors were jumping onto the pirate ship, which I did the same.  There were a few more casters there, and it was obvious at this point that they worked for Zythra.  Two of them had been mobbed once they jumped onto the Unflinching and were fighting off sailors with wooden daggers.  Sharp things, killed a sailor in one stroke.

There were two others on board of the pirate ship, whom I fought as well.  It was me, the captain of the Unflinching, me, the master of arms, and Beriix.  Oh yes.  He actually ended up joining us on the voyage.  A few other sailors had joined us, and we were fighting, downing a Zythra caster.  

The other one on board screamed in rage.  One of the two who had teleported onto our ship had already fallen, and suddenly the remaining two unleashed vines again, grabbing me and other sailors.

Throughout the battle, Lilmora had been using her powerful emotions to give us more vitality, more of a will to fight.  However, I could tell her emotions were waning, and there were already so many injured sailors.  She looked at me, and then realized what to do. 

The air bent around me, and suddenly I was where she had been, moments before.  She quickly got free, and raised her falchion.

Something that Lilmora has told me: The more she uses her emotions, the more… ‘Out of control’ she gets.  Her eyes were wild, and she screamed something everyone could hear:

“Hey caster.  Fute you!” 

Her falchion cut a massive slash across the caster’s chest, and soon the caster was finished off.  The remainder of that battle, even with one last caster, was fairly easy.  The pirates had already been intimidated as their comrades fell.  A few even ended up throwing themselves overboard, drowning.  

We’re working on picking up the bodies now.  We lost a good number on our side.  On particular loss was a sailor named ‘Hamilton,’ whom all of his comrades went to, tears streaming down their eyes as they wrapped him into blankets, lowering his body into the ocean.  

The remaining pirates, including the captain and first mate, upon seeing the last caster go down, surrendered.  They’re tied up now, as I write.

One thing I noted: The pirates are not enthralled like the soldiers back in Mayce.  I don’t know why, but this disturbs me… 

And I’m hoping I find Easy Torinn soon.

Three days have passed since Easy Torinn and Branimir fought in the Temple of the Raven Queen here in Dodaca.  Torinn has not woken up since the blow Branimir dealt to him, having been dragged to the jailhouse once the priestess got the guards.  They were reasonable enough, and after Branimir showed remorse at his actions, decided to let Easy Torinn go after he woke up. 

Which was this morning, as after tossing and turning all night, Easy Torinn got out of bed.  Both Branimir and Easy Torinn apologized to each other, and we continued our investigation, after taking a brief rest at the Sleeping Lion Inn to get some food.  It looks like the innkeeper is finally starting to like Easy Torinn, as she said she’s into ‘tough guys.’  I don’t exactly know what that means, but it must be a compliment, as Torinn was considerably more cheerful as we ate.

Still, I feel there is still some tension between Branimir and Easy Torinn.  Even though Branimir forgave Torinn and got him out a jail, he still hasn’t forgotten all the insults Torinn threw at the gods.  I heard my Dragonborn friend whisper that he was going to kill the Dwarf in his sleep while he was in jail.  But it won’t erupt just yet; we had an investigation to continue.

Remembering the steward’s words, of Narith Indriss last being seen at the Silk Whispers Inn before running off to Mayce (and getting himself kidnapped by mercenaries) we went there.  The innkeeper remembered us, and was going to make us pay to investigate the rooms, but we convinced him to let us in free.  Haldren Indriss’s blessings helped persuade him.  

The first two rooms were locked, and we didn’t get any responses when we knocked.  The third room had a very nervous man, and was honest enough, but Branimir could tell he was hiding something.  It also did not help that Easy Torinn was holding the man’s hand as we questioned him.  It was then I noticed a cloth sticking out of the man’s large drawer.  I opened it up, and out came a man dressed in the same clothing the mercenaries in Mayce had worn.  The only difference was that his entire head was wrapping up in a cloth.  

A minor skirmish erupted in the room, and I dealt him a cutting blow to the shoulder with my spear.  He realized he was outmatched, and said he would like to fight me, but he had to leave.  With that, he took out a mysterious black ball, and threw it at my face.  It exploded into smoke, blinding me as I wiped it from my eyes.  
	
When they were cleared, the mercenary was gone.  I shouted for Easy Torinn (who had previously left the room screaming in terror courtesy of Zaharia’s mischief) to catch him, but it did not work.  Branimir and I chased after him, and the mercenary took out a red ball, smashing it on the ground.  The wooden planks burst into flame as my Dwarven friend and I fought the mercenary.  He knocked Branimir out, and I was fighting him alone.  He was wily, using many tactics to get away, including throwing me into a wall.  Still, I was doing well when he pulled out a blade, which I caught.  Then he head butted me in the face, dazing me.  I feared the worst. 

But then the man was suddenly on his knees, whispering that we ‘Still hadn’t won’ before crumpling to the ground, Easy Torinn have smacked him in the back of the head with the butt of his scythe.

We decided to start new characters. He always had a lot of gear and was constantly supplying us.

For those who don't know EQ, back in the day you could really twink out lowbie characters with insane gear (if you had the pp for it). Item restrictions weren't what they are in modern MMORPGs with everything regulated and balanced and tiered. My buddy gave me a bunch of stuff to hold and share between for our new guys, including most of his money (a thousand or so PP iirc). 

After he finished giving me all the gear, he went to switch characters, and I started looking trough the stats of the items when something caught my eye. I noticed an interesting armor I had never seen before. Among its stat-altering qualities was a negative hp stat. I thought to myself ""Hmm, this thing takes away more hp than I even have at this level. I wonder what would happen if...""

I put it on without thinking. Before transferring our gear, or asking permission from my friend, or asking guildies if they'd tried something like that before, I succumbed to my own idiotic curiosity. I died instantly. And then I appeared at my bind point (soulbinder in GFay) and died instantly again. And then it loaded and I died instantly again. It wasn't stopping. In EQ, when you die, you leave a corpse with your gear (or an empty corpse if you have no more gear to drop), and if you don't recover your corpse, it disappears along with your equipment after some time. However, my fresh character was below level 10, and as a courtesy, characters under 10 get to respawn with their gear. So now I was now in an infinite death loop.

I start freaking out. I couldn't contact my friend right away because I couldn't use the chat. I couldn't access the money, I couldn't recover the corpse, I couldn't transfer the gear, and I was spazzing out too hard to figure out an alternate way to contact my friend. All I could do sit there while my High Elf corpse factory ran on auto pilot. Luckily my friend wasn't a moron like me, and my phone rang.

""Dude... I fucked up.""

I explained the situation. Thankfully he's a cool guy and he was more fascinated with the situation than pissed off that I may have bankrupted his account. He tells me to force close and restart the program, and log in with another character. Duh. We walk over to my bind point. Yeah, lots of dead Elves lying around doing nothing.

My buddy says it's time to bring in the almighty GMs.

We get a GM over surprisingly fast. I explain to him what I did. He is silent for a while. He tells me to try logging in again. I do. Corpse factory back on. I call friend. He says to log off again. Get back on other character. Talk to GM.

""So... I have never seen anything like this before. I'm at a total loss. I have no idea how to stop this. We will be in touch.""

I logged in again three days later to find the death loop still active. At some time in the next few days, me and my friend basically quit, so we never resolved that situation. Years later, while having some nostalgia about EQ, I was stricken by my uncontrollable curiosity once more. I paid for a month subscription and logged in. I don't know when or how, but someone had separated my incredibly suicidal elf from her iron maiden. *evil grin* I attempt to reequip the armor. Doesn't work. Level requirements have been added to gear.

That was the moment I knew that EQ was really over forever, and I would never have the level of fun in an MMORPG again as I did in EQ.

We are playing as the Republic against the CIS.

We start out doing pretty well, but all of a sudden the CIS get their hero, Count Dooku. So we start getting smashed, and our reinforcement count drops like crazy. We push back, but our efforts were in vain, and it looked like at the rate things were going we would soon lose. My cousin and I, knowing the end was near, retreat to the edge of the map towards where the LAAT ship was. Somehow we are lucky enough to be the last two left when the reinforcement count is at 2, so no more AI will spawn and die to bring it down and make us lose. The enemy had about 25-30 reinforcements left at this point, and we only owned the closest command post.

So I notice the gunship nearby, and I tell my cousin, ""Hey, maybe we can use this ship, 'casue there's no way we can capture the command posts with just the two of us, and we won't be able to fight off the last 30 of them on foot."" So he gets in the ship and pilots while I get on the guns. We fly over to the center of the map and the droids started trying to snipe us, so I yelled to him, ""Go up!!"" 

He took that very seriously and went to the height cap of the map. They weren't accurate enough to hit us at this distance, but it was just as difficult for us to hit them. Going down would put us right back in the same position, so we had no choice but to try to hit them from here. As I tried to target the first droid, we circled the map several times. Impatient young me was getting frustrated, but I eventually got a leg shot and blew the droid to pieces. I got the next droid a little bit faster, and eventually I was only taking one shot to hit each one. When we got down to the last two, our last command post started flashing. There was no way we would have time to exit the ship, and I couldn't take one shot to hit each of them at the distance I was at, not even with my improved speed. My cousin and I give each other a knowing look, and he starts nosedives the ship and pulls up quickly to get a big burst of speed towards the post. They start firing on the ship, and right before we collide with a cliff I fire at them and kill both with one shot.  Oh that Victory was sweet.

This mod was awesome, it allowed admins to basically do anything you could imagine, you could teleport people, instant kill, send lamers into alternate dimensions, so much opportunity to play God and abuse people.  That wasn't me.

No, I wanted to use my powers for the greater good...  JA+ had a unique feature in which you could load single player maps into the multiplayer client!!!  There was this one map in the single player campaign where you ride a swoop bike through these desert canyons, this map was huge!  It would take 5-10 minutes just to get across.  JA+ also allowed people to load vehicles in the game, a feature not meant to be!  It was as though the developers allowed people to ride space ships and such but never perfected the process so it was never used, the models were there, the functionality, was there, but it simply just wasn't in the game.

Well I loaded a Lambda shuttle.  Amazingly I could get in, then tell people to get in the vehicle with me.  I would be in full control of the ship and would fly though the level.  I basically ran a taxi service.

Well I told everyone there was a special trip we were going on, so most of the people got aboard, I even stopped in a small arena area for bathroom break.  

After that I led them all to a large clearing at the end of the level. 

Now my idea as admin is, how can I make this game more fun and memorable, and give them something they can't normally get in a regular server?  

Well waiting for them was a row of tauntauns that they could ride (typically not available in multiplayer).  There was one problem though.

An army of dark jedi.  Dozens, maybe even over a hundred.  Multiplayer bots are limited to the server player limit, usually 32.  But these were single player NPCs!  And thanks to JA+, they functioned normally in multiplayer!  They would only react once you got close to them.    (I had previously spawned them earlier, and using admin powers I cloaked myself so they wouldn't see me)

So as everyone mounted their tauntauns I gave a long Lord Of The Rings style speech telling everyone they were my brothers and all that crap.  I then instructed everyone to draw their weapons.  Everyone drew their lightsabers.  

I then screamed (typed)  TO ARMS!!!  Then we started charging the army of dark jedi!  

Once we were a few hundred feet away all the dark jedi drew their lightsabers, growled and started charging right at us!  

It was amazing, we all clashed in an insane bloodbath!

I also binded npc spawn commands to my keyboard, so while everyone wasn't looking I would spawn rancors, then lead them to the fight!

I was a sniper overlooking the enemy airfield on Operation Flaming Dart, and was picking off people as they would come out onto the airfield. After about 10 minutes of doing that, people started to take action. Hiding, smoke bombs, etc. One person went and grabbed the helicopter from the nearby helipad without me seeing (I was zoomed in on the airfield). So I'm still looking at the airfield, when I start hearing some music (and if you've played that game, you know music means they're getting close). So I zoom out and start looking around frantically.. Then, the helicopter hovers in front of me, right over the hill I was on, blaring [Surfin' Burd](http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_detailpage&amp;v=ZThquH5t0ow#t=6s) and just hovers there for a second - Knowing that I was completely done for. Then he just blows me up. Still one of my favorite moments in that game. 


Crysis: 

Sniper, again, I was sitting out on the top of the Plateau overlooking an area, when I start to see a friendly running across the bridge on that map. I zoom in to see what was going on, when I see a pickup truck just racing towards that guy, NOS and all. Naturally, I zoom in to watch his untimely death. The guy is just playing it off like nothing's even happening, just walking straight towards this truck which is racing towards him.

The bandits who had taken him hostage were asking for ""about 15 grand or an artifact"". Being the tight-fisted money scrounger that I am, I offered instead to ""Go it alone"" and ""Take them out, myself"".

Fast forward to the entrance to the warehouse where I see an absolute CROWD of bandits brandishing an array of weapons staring at me while I make my way to the room where Mitay is. He's huddled over in a corner next to a campfire. I walk over to the guy in charge and ask Him about the situation. Same story here, no possible negotiation, It HAS to be 15k.

So, pulling out my newly modified and relatively expensive pistol, I proceed to start the nightmare of a war with them. Ducking behind crates and pulling of some tricky shots, I manage to create a nice scattering of bodies. I decide to go back to Mitay and give him the O.K. when he stands up and pushes me out of nowhere and I hear the sound of my pistol being removed. When I recover, he's ""ready to go back"". What the heck!

""Well"" I thought, ""Maybe he'll give it back when we're at Grizzly's again"", So I escort him. We get back and Grizzly gives me a thank-you but going to Mitay he turns to me and says that he's ""Too busy to talk right now"" and normally where there's the button to ""trade"" with people is not even there!

Cix thinks to himself, smiling beneath his porcelain mask and smirking with the knowledge that none can see him and if they could,how could they possibly recognize him? ""High Prince Gnomir is passing through Balforge when I and Mithic are? This is almost too good to be true."" *Or is it? How do we know this isn't a trap? They are far reaching, how do you know they don't realize we're working against them? They did terrible things to us, to the other ones too! I'L RIP THEIR THROATS OUT!* Cix's face breaks into a snarl as he reaches for his pack and the flaking, war paint covered mask within. But he catches himself, slowly drawing his hand away from the bag to rest it on the post of the bed he is sitting on. 
""I must be more careful!"" He mutters to himself, trying to drown out the tumult of voices brought on by the Savage. Cix ensures that his mental barriers are strong and ensures that he add extra precautions. For the Savage to take control during the interview would be disastrous. 

It had been a long time since Cix could remember when the voices didn't exist. The Soldier, the Assassin, the Jester... the Savage. Their torture had brought them all out, except his first voice. The one that saved his life during the invasions. When they came in their flying citadels and summoned for Cix-es that could have been, ones from other realities they had taken over. The Savage helped him defeat them all, but he was taken when his world fell, like they all will eventually. But not this one. Not if he could help it. After what seemed like an eternity of torture and isolation he was brought forth and instructed to kill his counterpart on this world, which he did, in exchange for his freedom. 

Waking from his daze, Cix began to walk out of his room, casually surveying the six guards stationed around the Prince's room from the safety of his expressionless mask. Mithic was downstairs at the bar, talking up the locals. All according to plan. A silent nod is exchanged between them and Cix spins abruptly and walks back to the room it had taken a small fortune in bribes to acquire. Soon after, the smashing of wine glasses, the crashing of tables and the smell of smoke begins emanating from downstairs and the guards rush down to see what is going on. Cix peeks into the hallway, one left. He saunters down the hallway. The guard, alert already; tells him to get lost. With a quick blow to the head the protests end. Opening the door very slowly, Cix enters the high prince's chambers. 

**Later that night.**

Balli - Mithic's horse gallops through the raging forest fire around them. Cix, unconscious and maskless, and Mithic holding his companion desperately holding on to his friend while trying to guide his horse. Behind them, a green dragon is silhouetted against the inferno, clutching an egg while sparks fly from the mutilated wreckage of the warforged sent to steal the egg and light the fire by Gnomir. 

*HE BETRAYED US! EVERY ONE OF US! HE WILL PAY, HE HAS TO PAY! NO ANSWER! NO ANSWERS! NOTHING GIVEN EVEN AFTER WE DIDN'T CLAW HIS PRETTY LITTLE THROAT OUT TO SEE WHAT COLOR HE BLEEDS* The voice overpowered all the others raging in his unconscious mind. Exerting so much control, the others mused as to why it was not dominant in the first place. But they all agreed with it in one shape or another, the prince had not given them what they wanted, and to let him get away after misleading them would be unwise. What if he told those who control him that Cix was actively working against them? And there is only one way to ensure that without bloodshed....

The first words Cix speaks when he wakes are: ""We can't let him go."" After explanations  are given, Mithic tentatively agrees. They have to kidnap the high prince of Rhyannum; the most militarized nation on the continent. 

Walking calmly back into the inn, Cix proceeds upstairs to his room, grabs his smoke bombs and alchemists fire and immediately walks out. There are still six guards, all looking a little worse for wear after last night's bar fight. In one deft motion, he throws all his alchemical tools to the floor, lighting a roaring blaze and filling the hallway with a thick, cloying smoke. Cix slips past the guards, who in a panic are making their way to the prince's room. As the door opens, Cix rushes past them and with a powerful leap, crashes through the multi-paned window, with Gnomir locked in a bear-hug. They land heavily, even though the fall was only 10 feet or so. The prince, dazed by the impact is helped on his way to unconsciousness by a blow to the head with Cix's quarterstaff and is thrown unceremoniously onto the horse waiting for them beside Mithic on Balli. The two ride off, fast as the wind, before the royal guard even has a chance to make it out of the front door of the inn.

IIRC, there were no beds, no hunger bar or sprinting. Just you, monsters, and mining. If you died, you respawned at spawn.

I had been mining for days. On me, I had around 1 and a half stacks of Iron Ore, a bunch of cobble and coal, and some stone pickaxes as well as a iron sword. Underneath my house was my mine, which was a huge underground workway of confusion. It went everywhere and it was hard to get back.

But I went on.

I had just found a new cave. I never saw it coming. A creeper was just around the corner, and it blew just as I entered the cave. I lost everything. Hours upon hours of work gone in an instant. Even if I found the cave and the entrance, I wouldn't be able to get to the items on time.

I never found that cave again.

I respawned. It was night, in the middle of it actually. I vaguely remembered where my house was, and set off in the general direction. My spawn was in a horrible place, in a small grassland without any water or trees, so I had to move to survive. I kept on walking, jumping  over mounds of grass when I heard something following me. I did a quick-look behind and confirmed my fears: a creeper had discovered me.

It quickly attracted attention from other monsters. Soon, I was being chased by around 3 creepers, 4 spiders, and 2 zombies. I soon came across a small legion of skeletons, around six of them, who were marching through the forest in a roman formation. I was amazed that they actually did that, and I've never seen it happen before. They looked at me briefly and decided to not give chase except two who broke formation and started shooting at me. I eventually came too my house, opened the door, and they left. The creepers decided that there were better things to do, and the spiders lost interest. Except two of each, they stayed. The spider hanged around, checking the general area out while the creeper stayed ontop of my house.

I was obviously scared, and fueled by adredeline, I decided to go out once I had calmed down. Waiting until day, I went outside. I heard the famous 'Sssssss' and then an explosion.

I had died, once again. My house was ruined, and I eventually came back to it. I redid the entrance, but it just wasn't the same.

And that, is my Minecraft story. So far, I have never had another experience like this. I left Minecraft for a bit, came back, and a bunch of stuff was added.

We finally marched to Dodaca after days of tireless walking.  We lost a few stragglers on the road, but we didn’t go back for them.  Fear of Zythra’s army drove us forward and we got to the capital.  

Immediately Marx got an audience with the king, and I was fortunate enough to be reunited with the Gno- Elf.  Varis is an Elf.  I’m not sure I was in my right mind when I randomly became his friend.  Nevertheless, I felt I could trust him, so he joined the war council with the king.

The advisor was there, the one who had the diary about Zythra.  I passed the diary to the king, attempting to get the advisor out.  The advisor, however, is a sly man.  He questioned if I could be trusted.  I told him I could, as I fought rather hard during the battle in Mayce.  The advisor said that they should question whether or not I had stolen the book and copied his writing to frame him as a supporter of Zythra.

Ultimately, the king trusted neither of us, and we got back to the matter at hand.  A bit a debate went on, and we decided on having a sizable amount of Dodaca’s best soldiers meet Zythra in battle.  Varis and I would go to Sagon, a city near Dodaca, to go to a ‘ball’ some nobles were hosting.  We would solicit aid from the nobles, be it money, men, or food.  

So there Varis and I were, at the party.  We were in formal armor, our weapons shining and sharpened.  I met Haldren Indriss there, and although he was slightly angry at me for abandoning the investigation, he agreed to help the Salthirn military fight Zythra’s enthralled.  

A few hours past with idle talk and laughter, the drinking of this new drink I have found, ‘wine’, and boastings of past deeds.  

The doors suddenly were slammed, and the honor guard started locking them, drawing their weapons.  Yells and the clashing of swords could be heard from beyond the doors.  Invaders of the house, and Varis and I managed to get out after some persuasion to the honor guard.

I drew my spear, helping lock down the main hallway with a few guards.  Our foes were the same mercenaries who had kidnapped Narith.  I had noticed that Haldren Indriss seemed calmer than usual during the fight, as I ran out to battle the mercenaries.

And look who was with the mercenaries but Zaharia.

The Deva hadn’t been executed, as I had feared, but he was not in the right mind.  I told him not to fight, and he didn’t.  The apparent leader of the mercenaries looked at Zaharia with loathing at this, but continued fighting.

A few mercenaries ended up going through different rooms, flanking us.  There were actually a few… what’s the word, turncoats?  Yes.  A few soldiers and guards betrayed us, having been bribed by the mercenaries.  Still, we did well in keeping the mercenaries distracted while the honor guard moved the nobles to a more easily defendable part of the mansion.  

This all changed when the leader of the mercenaries cut down the two guards next to me.  

Varis and I ended up retreating, drawing a large number of mercenaries into the now-empty ballroom.  We were preparing to make a final stand, as a large number of the guard had been slaughtered.  The leader of the mercenaries, a huge bear of a man, offered us surrender, which we took.   I did not want to die that day.

The mercenaries took our weapons, assigned three of their number to guard us, and went into the room with the honor guard.  It didn’t take long before the nobles were joining us.  

The leader walked up to Haldren Indriss, who was apart from the rest of the nobles.  Indriss had helped get the mercenaries in, in exchange for his son.  He wanted payment, which the leader gave.  The mercenary stabbed Indriss, killing him.  

The mercenaries then killed any corrupt nobles, and left.  I objected to the leader having killed Indriss, saying how he would have helped provide resources to the army.  The leader simply replied that Indriss was too greedy, and would never have helped.

The mercenaries left, saying something about fireworks.  One mercenary, a Nurthian female who I later found out was looking for revenge on her family in a nation called Mordecai, stayed behind after a bit of persuasion.  She was a friend to the deva, who was left behind forcefully.  The Nurthian’s name was Lilmora, Mora for short.  She pushed for us to leave, using her emotions and ‘psionic’ power to push us through the door.  We managed to get a short way away before the mansion exploded.

Now it’s been a day since that incident.  Lilmora has shown me how to use the straight blade, called a kilnriv, which means ‘cutthroat.’ I know the basics, and I find it much more useful at the moment than my spear.  We’re going to regroup, the four of us, in an inn in Sagon.  

Hopefully enough money has been made for the army in Dodaca.

***30 seconds remaing***

I was running to the point, and I was just about to enter the fray when I saw a friendly spy being burned out the flanking route. Being a pyro, I decided to help him survive. Sadly, instead of staying in I accidently went out.

Panicking, I looked around. The 2 sentries there before was not there. A medic was the only one there. I rushed in.

I was spamming flames, and I saw a enemy pyro. I was in the red. *No!* Then, I used up all of my good karma. Criticals. I burned the pyro, and I saw the enemy rushing towards me. I airblasted, sending most of them away. An friendly heavy helped pick them off.

VICTORY!

I laughed maniacally as the victory theme played.",Video Game,False,self,t5_2wqgc,1368892033.0,video,author,True,t3_1ekwc2,http://www.reddit.com/r/gametales/comments/1ekwc2/tf2_the_siege_of_egypt/,

1369543025.0,0,self.gametales,1f2fpc,[D&amp;D 4E] The derpiest prisoner's in Ongar,9,9,1,http://www.reddit.com/r/gametales/comments/1f2fpc/dd_4e_the_derpiest_prisoners_in_ongar/,"Me and a bunch of friends started a new campaign today, and we had some of the craziest events happen in the 2 or so hours we played. The party consisted of the following (names in parentheses for when i reference later)
-Half-orc Fighter (Brog)
-Vrylokan Berserker (Iress)(played by me)
-Human? Sentinel/Avenger Hybrid (Vincent with a bear named otto)
-Changeling Psion (Artemis)
-Human Cleric of pelor (Everett)
-Drow Ranger (Wyatt)

 The initial setup is that we are prisoners in the city of Ongar which is basically a giant prison/mining operation. We are being led into the prison for various reasons (for example, Iress took the fall for an assassination attempt on a noble cause her fellow mercs abandoned her), The way we get into the city is through a giant metal platform that gets lowered (dubbed the medieval elevator). we eventually arrive at some building with dwarven runes on it (and my character is the only one who can speak/read dwarven) and meet the guy in charge of us (named Jon). We learn of the various jobs we can do (mining, adventuring, or working for the various gangs) and some basic rules of the prison. When the rules are being explained iress says to not drop the soap getting an odd look from the warden guy. She also proceeds to call him jonny boy despite his protests. Anyway we get settled in our barrack and head off to the adventurer's guild to get some work. We find it ok and get hired for a job but 3 of us (wyatt, brog, and iress) attempt to prove themselves to the bartender/guy in charge of hiring adventurers. Wyatt tries to show off his archery but ends up botching two shots and smacking the string against his arm. He then proceeds to use arrow stairs (a ranger power) to climb up a building and get stuck when the arrows he used broke. Brog and Iress both unsuccessfully tried to lift a table and iress decided to challenge one of the bigger guys to an arm wrestling match. Somehow i end up rolling higher than him (despite him having +10 to strength vs my +8) and prove myself worthy to the bartender of being a fighter and not just some torch carrier. While this is going on Everett tries to find anyone who worships pelor and ends up finding one of the funnier priests there. He said well i do believe in what could be equated to a German trying to do a sterotypical southern gentlmen accent (dm's german).He also kept rambling on about chicken legs and when everett asked for a holy symbol he gave him a badge that looked like a chicken leg. Meanwhile Iress got drunk on strong alcohol on an empty stomach which resulted in her making an ass out of herself. When we make our way back to the barracks we find baskets of food left and there just happens to be chicken legs in there, which wyatt &amp; brog try eating/hiding (while drunk Iress tries to steal them from wyatt). We eventually go to bed and wake up the next morning (Iress having a massive hangover) to head out to some sort of tomb. 

EDIT: Some examples of the insanity of the priest of pelor
""Oh don't feel down! The sun might not shine down here! But at least there's chicken legs.""
""Uhhh.""
""Oh yes, chicken legs are rather good. Pelor loves them!""
""What?""
""Here have a chicken leg.""
""Chicken leg, chicken leg. And chicken legs.""",Tabletop,False,self,t5_2wqgc,1369543282.0,table,author,True,t3_1f2fpc,http://www.reddit.com/r/gametales/comments/1f2fpc/dd_4e_the_derpiest_prisoners_in_ongar/,

So I dreamed that there was this new Sonic game on the 3DS, and I was playing it. It was totally awesome because it had the characters from the SatAM series in it. I was watching a cutscene in which Princess Sally was in a prison run by Dr. Robotnik, and she's talking to this other female character (I think it was Bunnie Rabbot) and then she drops this bombshell: ""But what I really want now is some HOT LESBIAN ACTION!""

And I was like, wow! Sega finally listened to the fans! And went far beyond what I was expecting... o.O
