Jad worked well, but is sadly out of date.  JD-GUI seems to be the best available at the moment, but it regularly barfs on code emitted by my own compiler.  Neither is open source.

In an attempt to address this situation, I've been working on a decompiler myself.  I need some help, however:  I want to collect real-world code snippets that have proven difficult for existing decompilers to handle.  I would be grateful for any examples posted.

To be clear, I am looking for code that, when run through a ""well-intentioned"" Java compiler (i.e., not an obfuscator), results in bytecode for which decompilers such as Jad and JD-GUI have been unable to produce correct/equivalent Java code.

I am particularly interested in examples involving complex uses of:

  1. `try`/`finally` or `synchronized` blocks;
  
  2. `break` and `continue` statements with explicit target labels on outer loops or non-loop statements;
  
  3. general local/inner class weirdness related to synthetic members, implicit constructor arguments, outer class references, etc.

For code which is runtime-generated or compiled by anything other than javac, please post or PM me a link to the compiled class file.

**NOTE:** For now, I am only supporting Java 5 and later compile targets (0.49+).  Specifically, I am not yet supporting code that makes use of the now-deprecated `JSR` and `RET` opcodes.

I'd rather not get into NDAs and the like, so it would be best if code examples were of open source origin; taken directly from the JDK; or throwaway snippets created specifically for this purpose.

Work has been progressing nicely, and while it's still a *long* way from being finished, I think it's far enough along to post an early preview release and see how badly you guys can break it :D.  

You can find an introductory post [here](https://bitbucket.org/mstrobel/procyon/wiki/Java%20Decompiler), and a .jar download [here](https://bitbucket.org/mstrobel/procyon/downloads).  You can also clone my hg repository if you like.

One thing I'm particularly proud of: it supports Java 8 lambdas.  I believe this is the first decompiler to do so.  I've only tested it with fairly simple examples, but I'm eager to see how well (or poorly) it handles more complex lambda expressions.  Make sure you have a recent JDK8 Lambda build, though.

If you try the decompiler out and find anything that breaks, or anything that works better than you expected, I'd love to hear about it.  Post below :).

Beware, these projects are heavily commented and unit tests are plentiful:

I lead an open source project called AllianceP2P. It's a decentralized communications application that makes it insainly easy for users to connect, communicate, and share data securely without the need of servers or any type of node to pass data between. All data is encrypted using a psudo encryption layer by default and also has an option to turn on AES (128, 192 and 256 bits) over SSL. The project is in a mature state and we do have (from the download numbers on Google code) a decent following. It works well aside from some small bugs and a large data transfer issue (sometimes downloads die). There's a few new features/changes I'd hopefully like to get in this year but need help.  I had several programmers working on the project with me but unfortunately real life got the better of them which left me on my own. I'm hoping to gather some people who would be interested in contributing to a mature open source project at their leisure. All levels are welcome. Any help would be great!

It looks like there are enough Java users here at /r/java, but clearly not all people here vote in /r/programming for Java links. As a result many Java links that do well here or over at DZone are voted into oblivian there. It's like there's an angry Python/Ruby/JavaScript mob over there that votes down everyhing Java related on sight.

Now you could say that /r/programming is for general programming links, and Java specifics do not belong there (like Tomcat 7.x released), but there are lots of links which are very specific for say Python on /r/programming which aren't voted into oblivion.

After reading a post which suggested Joda-Time (http://joda-time.sourceforge.net/) for hassle free date/time handling, I started wondering what other API's I was missing in my toolbox.  I am more interested in some of the lesser known APIs.  

Some common ones I use are:  
  Apache commons - Wide range of tools - http://commons.apache.org/  

  Jasypt - Java encryption - http://www.jasypt.org/  

  JFugue - Java music programming - http://www.jfugue.org/

1283931484.0,42,self.java,dazz7,Here is why I use Java.  Tell me where I am going wrong.,51,9,73,http://www.reddit.com/r/java/comments/dazz7/here_is_why_i_use_java_tell_me_where_i_am_going/,"So, I use Java...and python, ruby, scala, clojure, (very little haskell), C, C++.  Not all at the same time, mostly Java.  I just wanted to say, I am not a pure Java programmer.

...I was thinking...at 3am in the morning after little sleep.

Here is why I use Java (where Java == Java Platform, Language and Community):

* Community.  Java has a large one.  It probably is the most popular language.  Competing with C and C++.   Note: C++ was created in the 80s.   C was created in 1972.  Java in 1995.  The community is pretty substantial.  There are millions of developers in Europe, the US, Asia, everywhere.
* Enterprise Community.  There are a lot of professional Java programmers.  People actually pay Java programmers to write code.  There are a lot of companies like Oracle, Google, Ebay, Walmart that setup and attend conferences, technology conferences like JavaOne.
* Tools, there are a lot of them.  Big companies like IBM, Oracle put a lot of money into writing Java tools.  You have major IDEs like Eclipse, IntelliJ.  There are Java tools for RIA like Flex, Flex Builder.
* Libraries.  There a lot of useful ones.  There is Terracotta for clustering.  Apache Lucene for indexing.  GWT Google Web Toolkit for RIA technology.  Wicket, Spring, Swing, SWT, Java on OpenGL, Java Mail, JMS, on and on.
* JVM languages.  Popular implementation of other languages exist in Java.  Jython is popular.  JRuby, Scala, Clojure, ABCL (Common Lisp) exist.
* Java may have a slow(er) bootup time, but some Java code executes fast compared with other languages (according to the language shoot outs)
* Java has a large standard set of mature libraries; GUI, File IO, Mail, Messaging, Web Application development, Javadoc, etc, etc.  Or use Apache commons if you don't like what Oracle/Sun has to offer.
* Security - mature security libraries exist.
* Internalization 
* Negative: Java the language has some issues.  I won't enumerate them here.
* Java the runtime is pretty widespread.  Most desktop computers have a version of the runtime.  Users are getting familiar with how to run a jar or webstart or applet.  A Java is more common than a Common Lisp one.
* Java is open, mostly.  Java OpenJDK is available
* Java WORA is mostly true.  Java has automatic memory management.
* Niche of a Niche:  Even the fringe stuff in the Java world works.  I used the popular AIML library the other day.  The OpenNLP library is pretty solid.  Lucene/Hadoop/Terracotta clustering are pretty cool.  I want to mess around with the Java media framework next.
* Reddit, Facebook, Twitter are using popular Java libraries.

For web application (stuff I mostly work with), Ruby and Python offered some frameworks and environment there were useful.  But, I never have enough confidence in all of the tools or libraries.  I used Rails but the security libraries and components were lacking.  Not I or anyone else could get a robust server configuration up and running.  Things like this were already pretty standard in the Java world.  Things like that always kept me switching back to Java for various projects. 

I will probably drop Ruby completely.  But, I do use Python for various libraries and scripting.

What are your thoughts?  I know people tend to attack the language exclusively.  And some people have fair arguments with language features that allow you to be more productive in other languages, for certain tasks.  But, I find it odd that people completely ignore the benefits of the community (see JavaOne) and the platform?

I notice people on reddit attack Java, but normally it is the knee jerk ""Java is slow, it sucks"".  I guess Java gets the same kind of attacks that Microsoft gets ""Microsoft Sucks"".  Does it really, does Microsoft really suck?  My 2 cents.

**Edit: Valid Issues With Java from the thread**

* ""Java's GUI stuff sucks on my laptop because it's slow. It's not so slow on my desktop""
* ""Java definitely feels slow, because big Java apps (like Eclipse) can take over a minute to launch""
* ""What I can tell you is that I went from Smalltalk to Java, and it has never been possible (for me) to achieve the same coding speed or expressiveness, or the same feeling of flow, in any Java IDE""",,False,,t5_2qhd7,True,,,True,t3_dazz7,http://www.reddit.com/r/java/comments/dazz7/here_is_why_i_use_java_tell_me_where_i_am_going/,

These seemed to bring up a few good points:

So a couple years ago I was working on a hobby project and I had to use sin() a lot (it could be several billions of calls).  So I was looking at ways to speed it up.  One of the things I did was to look at the source.  Math.sin's (which I was using) body was:  
    public static double sin(double a)  
    {  
        return StrictMath.sin(a);  
    }  
  
So I thought, why not just use StrictMath.sin() instead and save a call/return?  Turns out the execution time increased, every time.  I asked my professor and he didn't know.  So I asked the java forums, and I never got a definite answer.  So now I figure I'll ask here as the thought came up.  Does anyone know?  I assume there's some trickery going on (like the source for Math.java isn't the actual implementation or some such).",,False,,t5_2qhd7,False,,,True,t3_1hanen,http://www.reddit.com/r/java/comments/1hanen/differences_between_mathsin_and_strictmathsin/,

1376417534.0,38,self.java,1kak03,So I visited Oracle a couple of days ago and wanted to share my experience,52,14,37,http://www.reddit.com/r/java/comments/1kak03/so_i_visited_oracle_a_couple_of_days_ago_and/,"So I made a throwaway account because I'm not sure what to expect when sharing something like this. A couple of days ago I visited Oracle to learn a little bit more about the upcoming release of Java EE 7, Glashfish 4.0 and a bunch of other new java-related technologies.

So let me start by saying the Oracle building looks pretty cool both on the inside and the outside it looks like a cool place to work. But anyways onto the experience. A couple of friends and me get to the building, we register for the event, we get a bunch of cool stuff (t-shirts, java coffee mugs, candy) and the conferences start.

Let me get this out of the way fist, I don't work with Oracle, I work with Oracle technologies that's for sure but that's another point. So the conference starts, we get a glimpse of what the new Java EE 7 can do with JSF, Glassfish, they talk about ditching XML for JSON (funny enough Netbeans and java FX use XML a lot). Then it's time for Q&amp;A and this is where it gets interesting, many members from the audience are from different companies (event IBM workers made an appearance too), there's some interesting questions asked:

Q. How do I convince my direct supervisor to change from Java EE 6, Spring to Java EE 7?, even with the advantages I find it extremely difficult to change his/her mind.

(I kid you not with this answer)
A. Well we can't be sure, we're still trying to figure this one out. But it should be your responsibility after all if you want to keep supporting Java the best thing you can do is to convince your boss and then share the method with us so we can share it with more people.

I really have a mixed bag of feelings after hearing this answer

Q. You released a lot of technologies this time, some work for certain kinds of tasks some for other. BUT I don't have the time to learn them all, what technologies would you say, these are the ones to help me in the near future regardless of any possible change?

(Again very umm interesting answer)
A. Well make the time to learn them all (Gives a book related to one of the technologies) and better start soon. (End of answer).

I'm thinking at this point. Ok.......... Pretty straightforward answer at least the fella got a free book

Q. Why does this particular technology (can't remember the name of it) It's pretty slow and it's such a memory hogger

(This is where I felt sorry for one of the IBM guys attending the conference)

A. It's IBM's fault, the changes they made to the code made it that way. if you go and poke around the libraries (The guy giving the conference opens netbeans, pokes around the libraries a bit, and interestingly enough, on the imports section we find ""com.IBM.something......"") everyone was surprised BUT if you want to make it better, help us created the next java specification.....

At this point I really felt sorry for the IBM fella as he got laughed at for something he perhaps didn't even touch.

Then one of the attendee's made a remarkable observation because the guy giving the presentation mentioned helping oracle with the next java specification

Q. How can we help for the next java specification because If I'm honest I don't have knowledge of certain things such as compilers and some of the underlying technologies, hell I barely understand how to create things without a wizard helping me along the way?

A. Well it is your duty to learn about all of those things if you want to help (fair enough I think to myself). But it should be the duty of anyone learning to code, to learn about the things they're making so we can have better technologies in the future since we would be cooperating to create the next big thing in programming.

I could rant so much about this answer but I think a discussion would be much better.

So the conference ends and we get a small break with pizza and we get to do networks with lots of guys around the IT industry people from Oracle, IBM, Salesforce and whatnot. It was a fun thing to do after the conferences. But beyond that I'd like to say

What's your opinion on such things said in this particular conference?, personally I would like to know why there's so much IBM hate when Java EE is mentioned around Oracle and other companies.

Thanks for reading :D, Any more questions regarding this post I'll be sure to answer to the best of my capabilites

EDIT: Thanks a lot to all who're contributing to give light to some of these questions I'll be sure to tell some of the people I met during the event.

I needed changes to their API and they complained about workload and it came back on my team to perform the changes.

Our new code caused their unit tests to fail in our CI build system.  After some investigation I discovered that their unit tests pass only because JUnit happens to run them in the order they're currently running.

It seemed obvious it was something they needed to look into, and after some back and forth they escalated it to management that we were causing problems and ""throwing work over the fence.""

I backed out all of out changes and checked in this.



    public class ReminderManagerTest extends ACSAbstractTestCase {

        @Test
        public void provePoint(){
            String point = ""This breaks the build because its addition changes the test order. No other changes have been made."";
            String build = ""Its hard to tell because it also causes the build to hang since an OrderManagerTest never decrements a CountDownLatch."";

            assertThat(build, is(hung));
            assertThat(point, is(made));
        }
    }

edited speeling, more speeling

**update:**
Ok, in all fairness this didn't have the justice inducing effect I had hoped for.  It was really non-eventful but ended with a facepalm.  I even thought for a second about making something up but it would be too much work.  

Basically, I checked it in and the build hung. Which is what it does. Because the tests are shit.  After that team realized the build was hung they saw that I made the last commit and notified ME.  I'm not sure if they ever saw the content since no test report is ever produced.  So, I just grabbed the dept. head and he and I called a quick meeting to verbally explain to them what the problem was and that I could duplicate it on a clean branch, etc.

Unfortunately, the conclusion was something like, ""Oh yea, we've seen that before just rename your test class to ZReminderManagerTest and try it again.""  - sigh.  I'm going home.

Works as both an application and applet (I provided a simple html page to play it in too).

Now, to the questions:

1. Is there an active community around for Java games? I've struggled to find any. How about just a game community in general, to have people play and tell me what they think? I used to be tightly ingrained in some of the amateur gaming communities, but they all died... :D

2. I've been trying to find a job, so I'm using this as portfolio work so to speak (since I have no professional experience yet, finding a job seems to be impossible at the moment). If any of you would like to take a peek at the source, how is it? Structure, understandability, and so on? Tips? Suggestions?

3. Documentation. Currently I have none. Any suggestions on what I should have? I'm thinking a readme, a state diagram, and uml diagram... I want a complete project here.

4. Tests. Ah yes. Tests came after, this was not a TDD project. I mainly created them, because of expectations... I mean, every single job description you see practically lists TDD as a required skill (oops). I changed perhaps 3 lines of code because of them (little things that I was slacking on optimizing). To me, my tests are harder to understand than the code itself, more complicated than the code itself, and longer than the code itself.

I wrote a bunch. Really, I feel the only thing I should be testing is what I just expect to work but can't actually see working, and perhaps my collision method... but then I feel like it's not enough. And then, I get to points of how should I even begin to test my screen and manager classes...

So what I'm asking is... how would you go about testing something like this? Dare you look at my tests, how are they? If I scrapped the fairly useless ones, and only had about, 6, would I be frowned upon for having so few?

...

Oh, totally paste your high-scores here, that could be fun :D Competition! If you have any problems/suggestions/wants let me know... Thanks a bunch!

The task was to write a java program that would output a paragraph and have the java code smaller then the paragraph itself.
(smaller meaning in characters no size)
there were a few conditions however. 
1. no input allowed
2. no importing of files
3. no downloading from the internet or network

The paragraph that we had to output was this,
""I pledge that every program with my name on it shall be written by me
(and my co-authors, if any) and that i fully uderstad the program.
Every program I submit shall be entirely my own work unless otherwise
attributed. I understand that academic dishonesty not only includes
copying other people's work, but also abetting or facilitating
copying. Code that is similar to any other submission past or present
will get no credit whatever the explanation. I understand that the
consequence of academic dishonesty is a grade of 'F' for the class. I
pledge to devote my efforts to learning Java by writing my own 
programs. I shall strive to be attentive to detail and write programs
understandable by myself and other programmers.""

It's almost 10 years old now, and on a precursory flip through, I saw several mentions JVM tricks that are simply outdated. Is anyone familiar with this book? Is it worth picking up? Are there any good books on the subject? ",48,13,8,http://www.reddit.com/r/java/comments/1ax0e2/is_the_book_java_performance_tuning_still/,"I was walking through my local used book store when I stumbled across [this book](http://www.amazon.com/Java-Performance-Tuning-2nd-Edition/dp/0596003773/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1364139135&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=java+performance+tuning). It seemed fairly interesting. It had little tricks like reusing `char`arrays rather than Strings to speed up access time and save memory. However, as I skimmed the book, I noticed a bit of a trend. The author runs his tests under different JVMs, and with each successive version, the specific hard-coded tuning seemed to have diminishing returns due to the JVM optimizing the byte code.  

So, I'm curious, if (a) is this book still relevant, or has the JVM become more efficient than trying to hard-code optimizations by hand? I've read on numerous sites that modern JVMs, for your average day-to-day code, are producing results at, near, and sometimes even exceeding equivalent c++ code. I assume from the java compiler doing its own inlining, and other optimizations. However, that side of things is black magic to me. 

(b) What *is* the current state of the JVM? What does it do in terms of optimizations, and what would be a good source to look at to see how things function ""under the hood""?

Most recently, we're using Spring IoC and Struts 2 to build JBoss Portal portlets.

At ""home"", I work mainly with Python. Now, various things in Python land ""feel"" right. Pylons/Pyramid, for example, and WSGI, and Chameleon templating. HTML 5 feels right. CSS3 feels right. jQuery feels right. Google App Engine's webapp framework is pretty fun.

I'm pretty unhappy with our Java web development experience. For middleware, transactional stuff, scalability - it works very well. But the closer we move to the web front end, the more it feels wrong.

Some particular things I dislike:

* Lots of XML editing
* Developers need to keep lots of files open to get anything done
* Long redeploy/edit-to-test times (upwards of 30 seconds) for things like editing JavaScript or HTML
* Complex JSP-based views where people only partially understand what the soup of custom tags is doing
* Convoluted frameworks that make it hard to understand what's going on
* A 50 frame stacktrace between the request (""what went wrong in the browser"") and the Java code we wrote (""what went wrong in our application"")

I'd like to ask what other people use on the JVM that ""feels"" right. I don't necessarily want to throw out Java (my dev team would probably have a heart attack), and we get pretty good mileage out of our ""business logic"" components. But I do want something that feels more lightweight and fun to work with. Testability is important. Bonus for anything that can also support portlet development.

I am looking for some career advice; I'll try to be brief. I have worked as a Java/J2EE Web Developer for six years now. Only, I think I'm in a bit of a pickle. Where I work is way behind the times on a lot of things. Let's just say that our technology stack is all 2007 or older. For instance we are still on Java 1.4. Most notably there is no use of generics here. 

I want to look for a new job where I can use current technologies like Java 6, frameworks like maybe Spring or similar, and so on and so forth.

My question is for those managers out there who hire Java devs. What is the best thing I could do outside of work that would convince you that I have the experience and chops required to work with current Java technologies, without reverting to junior developer status and taking a big pay cut. Contribute to open-source? Build an example site? Other?

Thanks for any guidance you can provide.",,False,,t5_2qhd7,False,,,True,t3_187emn,http://www.reddit.com/r/java/comments/187emn/with_possibly_outdated_j2ee_skills_how_to_land_a/,

I have been out of college for two years and have spent those two years as a .NET and Python developer. Unlike a lot of young posters I see here, my school did NOT teach Java. We learned C/C++, C#, and Python (there were Java classes you could take as electives, but they were quite basic). I feel like .NET is a dying language, and want to stay relevant in the enterprise software world. I want to learn Java.


Now, I know Java...at least the basics. I know syntax and can build a simple app with little to no problems. After all, C# is heavily based on Java and I work with it everyday. I don't want the basics. I want to learn the skills I need to get hired and be successful as a full blown Java dev.


I was wondering if any of you fine people have any resource recommendations for learning such a thing. Every book I find deals with dead simple basic programming practices. I need to know how to build professional Java applications, not how to program.

...but I have no idea why.

I'm currently a CS student, and the language of choice for my school is Java. With the few months of experience I have with Java, my opinion of it is, well, I rather like it. It's got excellent concurrency support (which coming from a Python background makes this fact doubly cool), it can be ridiculously verbose and boilerplate laden at times, but Eclipse really eases that aspect of things. 

So, I'm just curious, what is it about java that causes people to write entire blog posts about how much Java needs to die? 

Further, *is* Java dying? I looks like it's still one of the most popular languages out there. Where do you see Java over the next 5-10 years?

For simplicity I assumed the letters were in a List&amp;lt;String&gt;, one letter per entry.

How'd i do? (it runs...)

For example, for the function useMagicPoints(int mp) in the player, I don't know if it is better to do:

    public boolean useMagicPoints(int mp) {
        if(mp &lt; 0)
            throw new IllegalArgumentException(""mp must be greater than or equal to 0."");

        if(this.magicPoints &lt; mp) {
            return false;

        this.magicPoints -= mp;

or

    public void useMagicPoints(int mp) throws InsufficientMagicException {
        if(mp &lt; 0)

When should I throw exceptions or return a code, I know that if I throw the exception, the caller is forced to handle the exception or throw it further, and this would be easier for the caller because the are forced to handle all cases and they dont have to know what the boolean means, but then would have to create an exception for each of these cases. So when should I throw an exception?

The core language most of my classes use is Java, so when my work asked me to build a new gui for an in-house tool, with me being the only programmer and get to pick the language used, I thought it would be a good chance to break away from my Python/WxWidgets background, and use my new Java skills. 

However, as I worked through the swing tutorials, there's one glaring problem: it's ugly -- really ugly. After some searching around, I see that there are `Look And Themes` that can be added, but even those don't look good. As I look around more and more, the general consensus I'm getting from various blogs, stackoverflow posts, etc.. is that Java is just not all that great for building GUIs. 

Am I just in a Google bubble, or is this the generally held opinion? 

With Python and WX I can usually have a moderately complex gui up and running in a couple of hours -- and it will look completely native (because WX actually uses the OS). Thus far, everything I've read points me the fact that, if I want to get a native looking and feeling app with Java, it's going to be a *huge* pain.

It was fun, and i got to learn the depths of both OpenGL and Java. After some time it became apparent that Java has some limits in regards to handling data. And while all Java purists tell that you shouldn't, i went and tried to optimize stuff not caring if the solution is Java'ish or not. Some other people came to the same conclusions as i did, and there was this [RFE 4820062](http://bugs.sun.com/view_bug.do?bug_id=4820062) submitted to the JCP which summarizes the core problem, and a proposed solution.

The JCP (Java Community Process) is the body that decides on what features will be implemented in future Java version.

The bug is about a ""struct""-like handling of data inside ByteBuffer-s. Its not a ""struct"" syntax for Java in itself, the reason for this would be to eliminate bound checks when generating lots of geometry data for OpenGL (or other JNI callable libraries), and to eliminate the need for data copying when generating those data. Eg, the data inside the buffers could be directly assigned to.

Some of the comments for the RFE were mistaken, some assumed C# some C or C++ like structs, and have not even read the RFE itself. But the RFE had 346 votes, which is not bad. Despite that, the JCP and the developers never took an effort to implement it.

Then when i took a look at it now, i see now that it has been marked as duplicate of another [RFE 4213096](http://bugs.sun.com/view_bug.do?bug_id=4213096). This one is not the same as the previous one. This RFE is about true C++ like (possible stack allocated) struct objects in the language. While there are similarities, this puts emphasis on extending the language by grouping data primitives into structs, and not on efficient handling of external library-dependent data.

The unfair thing is, that this RFE has very few votes (16) compared to the others 346, and is even older than the previous (meaning the devs care even less for it). The previous RFE was always in one of top 10 places of the RFE toplist (even tho it was there for years, without anyone doing anything), which has probably irritated them. So they closed the RFE with the excuse that its a duplicate, and linked it to the RFE which has much less votes. 

The moral of the story: You can do games (or any other heavily JNI dependent stuff) in Java, but there will be a point where you will not be able to get around the limits. And the JCP (now under Oracle) doesn't care, and even unfairly hinders efforts to get enabling features into Java.

This is like the JCP doesn't want you to do games in Java, according to them, you should switch to something else if you want to do that. ",,False,,t5_2qhd7,False,,,True,t3_sgboi,http://www.reddit.com/r/java/comments/sgboi/why_the_jcp_sucks_rant/,

I've been looking around for data mining APIs in Java (that are open source) that I would be able to use to perform different types of functions on massive datasets, like correlation analysis and regression analysis, etc for predictive analytics purposes.

Major points if said API has SQL interfacing and double those major points if said API has ways to build in functionality with a program called QlikView (though this portion is not my main concern).

I've come across **JDM, the Java Data Mining API**, but StackOverflow has been saying it's dead/not supported because no one ever really used it. If it is still very much alive and in use then I think I might go with this. 

Any guidance on this? I've been searching around with not much luck.

I often fill the role of the ""hired gun"" to come in and work on in-house applications.  I do feature development, performance tuning, refactoring, and testing of java software.

In my most recent job hunt, I'm noticing a frustrating trend in my interviews and phone screenings.  My inexperience with enterprise frameworks is hurting me badly. Although I have years of core java development and very low-level knowledge of the language, I feel unhirable.  I usually breeze through the skills test, only to hit a common roadblock at the end of the call when I get asked for my enterprise Java experience.  Usually EJB, Struts, JSF, Spring, and Hibernate are the most often desired in the interviewer's laundry list of skills, of which I have had no experience.

The companies I have done work for in the past usually needed new stand-alone tools developed, refactored, or performance tuned.  I've tuned tons of JDBC applications, custom ETL apps and web services.  None of these have had any Enterprise Java aside from the more basic ones such as JDBC, JavaMail, Servlets, &amp; JSP.

Am I overreacting to these interviews or am I discovering a legitimate trend?  How exactly does one gain experience in enterprise Java and still be taken seriously as a contractor?  I could sit at home and digest volumes of books on the subject but without real-world experience, hiring managers will basically pat me on the head and say ""You read all those books? You made an application at home? Isn't that cute..."".

I used to do db access via JDBC for the longest time. Build some wrappers around it so that my queries would look like lists of maps to get rid of JDBC clunkyness. New project, new luck, thought I would do it ""right"" this time. Industry Standard and all that. So I went with JPA.


It's dawning on me now that JPA is the mother of all leaky abstractions. In fact, it leaks the underlying RDMS so hard that I can barely see the ""Persistence"" in ""Persistence"" API anymore. It starts with the ridiculous notion of an attached object. What fuck guys? Who in the hell thought it would be a great idea to track changes to an object for the livetime of the entity manager? Why not a simple saveOrUpdate like hibernate had from the fucking start?

Then I discover that JPA doesn't manage bidirectional relations automatically. What!? That's like half of your fucking job but I guess ... only, why the hell do I still have to put all these useless annotations on them if JPA doesn't manage them itself?

Leading to ... deletion of objects in relations. There is no way to tell JPA to just set the object to null on the other side of the relation. Oh, you grand online tutorials with your naive ""Line Item -&gt; Order"" bullshit. No, I don't want cascade on delete and I dare say that ""delete on cascade"" is an exceedingly rare thing to do especially when you just could use embedded objects for the rare case of an owner relationship. In actual use-cases you'd usually like set the other side of the relation to null such as in:

Article -&gt; Author -&gt; on delete Author set ""author"" in Article to null. 

Who in their right mind would wants to have their data deleted automatically because some related object was deleted outside of some small, well-defined set circumstances ..

Don't get me started on the cache ... it's nice to have but it's frankly ridiculous that eclipselink needs 10 seconds to retrieve 2000 objects that only have lazy relationships with a cold ~~cash~~ cache.

First off, some background:
I'm 21 years old. When I was 12 I was introduced to Visual Basic, and managed to make some simple games before I discovered girls and lost interest. When I was 16 I regained interest in programming by playing around with my Ti 84 plus calculator. I made some pretty cool games and learned about how most of the things available worked.
So, I have some basic understanding of how programming works, and now that I started my studies in Engineering Physics at a Swedish university my interest for programming has resurfaced.

So. I did a tiny bit of research and figured Java would be a good language to learn. I figured it would be cool to be able to make simple games for example iPhone and android, and from the information I gathered Java would be a good language to start off with if this was my goal?

So. I'm using http://javalessons.com/ to learn and I'm in the middle of  the ""Java fundamentals"" introductory course. I like the setup with using examples to show how it works, but I'm not sure if the lessons are actually very good.

So, here are some of the questions that has surfaced for me:

1. Do any of you have any experience with javalessons.com? Do you have knowledge of any other sites that are better?

2. Is there a wiki or database of some sort that explains stuff? For example if I see the line ""java.awt.TextArea  ta  = new java.awt."" and I don't know what ""TextArea"" is, could I look it up somewhere?

3. In these examples they usually do things like ""import java.awt*"". What is it that I'm importing, really? ""Boxes"" with ""tools"" like buttons and such? Are these ""boxes"" included with java in every computer, and can I later on make my own ""boxes"" to include in my programs? Is there a list of what ""boxes"" I have, and what ""tools"" they include? (God, I must sound like such an idiot if I got this completely wrong ^^)

4. They use the word ""void"" a lot. For example: ""public void init ()"". Sometimes the Methods don't have ""Void""; and it just says ""public *name of method*"". What does void mean, really?

5. Does Java seem to fit my interest, you think? Should I start with C++ or something else instead if I'm interested in writing apps for cell phones and such? Another thing that I've been thinking about is creating a program that helps you learn notes and chords with the help of a midi-keyboard. I'm guessing it would be pretty simple to have the program receive info from a midi keyboard connected to a regular external sound card?

6. I use DrJava to write and compile in. Is there a better program that you would recommend? 

7. I'm guessing DrJava isn't actually called a compiler, but ""JDK"" and ""Eclipse"" are actually the ""compilers"" that this program uses. What are the differences between different compilers, and what kind of program would you say DrJava is? A ""writing tool"" of some sort?

I understand that these questions are kind of vague, and it's probably hard to give a simple answer to questions like the one about void, but I'd be very happy if you could try and clear some of these things up for me!

I migrated the build from ant to maven, cleaned up the code a lot, added comments here and there and tried to make everything as readable as possible. 

The aim of the whole project is to be able to add commands and triggers as easily as possible by just [creating a class with the right annotations](https://github.com/Athou/GeekBot/wiki/Create-a-new-Bot-Command). The rest is handled by my framework (and the awesome underlying PircBot library). Existing commands are listed [here](http://athou.github.com/GeekBot/be/hehehe/geekbot/commands/package-summary.html).

I just started using CDI (implemented by Weld) to replace some static calls and glue everything together, I'm currently looking at CDI events instead of my own eventing mechanism but I'm not quite convinced yet.

Please feel free to comment on the architecture or anything you find odd-looking or if you see room for improvement, as I'm always willing to learn !

I appreciate the suggestions concerning other languages, though. I will definitely think about these other languages!]

I know there is a thread like this from time to time here, but maybe you can tolerate one more...

To give you some background information for my questions: I have a Ph.D. in mathematics, but computer programming has become a hobby of mine in the past several years. Since I'm mostly self taught, I'm not really an expert in anything, but I've learned programming pretty well. My strengths are ActionScript, and now Javascript, and I'm learning Java too, which is really not hard coming from an ActionScript background. I understand object-oriented programming well.

I teach at a private high school, and I'll be teaching computer science in the fall. Java has become the language of choice for teaching, and I think it's a great choice. I won't be teaching an AP class, so I'm kind of free to structure the course however I like. (That's so liberating!)

Right now I'm envisioning the class starting off with Processing, which I think is a great place to learn the basics of programming (variables, loops, arrays, classes, etc), then I'll move them into Java programming, first on the command line then in an IDE (probably Eclipse).

But anyway, because of my background I don't know everything. And one thing I can't really say I know anything about is what people use Java for these days. I know it's still a very popular language. And I know it's probably the most popular language for Android development, so that's a plus, but...if you had to put together a list of things that Java is used for, in a way that high school students new to programming could understand, what might you include?

Of course, I'm not too hung up on applications. The goal here is to really get students excited about programming, and to learn the basic logical constructs. I think Java is the perfect language for that.

The interesting part is I'm not actually part of the IT department and they (a year ago) said I could use Python on the understanding I would get no support from them, they were advocating PHP. Due to my own experiences with the two and the project I would be undertaking I picked Python.

Fast forward to today and some other people from IT have performed a code review as the project has been far more successful than they anticipated and people are sitting up and taking notice. The main question they're asking has to do with Python, why am I using it? I've not had a chance to meet the questioners yet but I'm told some of them code in Python themselves and that the main suggestion coming from IT is to use Java instead.

I've had some exposure to Java but not a lot. I understand it's compiled to Byte-code, uses the JVM etc and that it's very popular in more established businesses. What I don't know (beyond what a simple Google search will tell me) is why I would pick one or the other.

I'm not after ""Java is better than Python"", I'm genuinly curious to hear from people experienced in both which aspects of each make them good for different problems. Is it that Java is a lot better past the 10k loc mark? Is it that Java is so much faster than Python?

I have two questions before i paste the code..
1: When i hold down a movekey the screen will oddly flicker, im not sure if there is a way to fix this, you would have to look at my code =D
2: You will find i have a method called Init() and i dont know a good way to call it, since main is static, im not sure if there is another way than what i did, i put a comment with lots of caps next to my primary init() call..

I tried to comment and space it to make this as painless as possible, tips, bad habits i use, or whatever else, is greatly appreciated

Maybe I'm just anal about things, but I've noticed and notified my associate developers about little things in the code that are unnecessary and downright silly. After their projects pass peer reviews (not by me), I *still* find them.

Stop me if you've seen these.

    //boolean ""condition"" defined above
    if(condition == true) //yes, coded like this.    
        return true;
    else
        return false;
I'm sure all of you can do in 1 line what it takes them to do in 4.
Here's another one.

    if(doTheFoo())
    {
       //do a bunch of stuff
       return;
    }
    else
    {
       // do a bunch of stuff had doTheFoo()
       // returned false
    }
This is elementary Java, for crying out loud. Why do you need an else clause if the **if** block will prevent it from executing?! Replace ""if"" with ""while""... it happens there too.

Finally, a lot of null pointers and memory issues are caused by improper initialization of objects.

    Object myObj = new Object();
    if(requiredCondition)
      this.use(myObj);

I can understand these constant mistakes from rookies, but these people have been using the language for years upon years. I'm not one to call the kettle black, though; should I find code like this, I'll immediately clean it up, especially if it's of my own doing.

**tl;dr**
Have any of you seen code gaffes that, while compile and runtime legal, are just plain silly, unnecessary, and/or redundant?

So the problem is, that I cannot simply copy the file, modify it, stick it in the same package and use it, because my modified class has to be loaded by the same class loader as its superclass. Making a copy of the superclass, I get to witness this beauty (quote from Unsafe.class:)

I'm currently writing an application which involves building some strings. I find myself doing this a lot:

    String lineTerminator = System.getProperty(""line.separator"");
    StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder();
    ...
    sb.append(""blah blah blah"").append(lineTerminator);

So I thought I'll just extend the Stringbuilder class and add a method:

    public void appendLine(String s);

with the obvious semantics.
But I find I can't do that because the StringBuilder class is declared as 'final' why?

I've vaguely googled a bit for this but the answer generally seems to be:
""You would make a class Final in Java if you do not want anybody to inherit the features of your class. ""
and ""You don't want anybody to inherit from your class because that code would not work"" but I can't seem to get a reasonable explanation for *why* it might not work.

I've used Eclipse at work for a few years now and I like it, but I was simply wondering if others who've also used Eclipse have tried Netbeans and like it more.  I plan on downloading it and importing my Eclipse projects to see how I like it.  In the meantime if you have some positive or negative thoughts about both, please let me know!

EDIT: Thanks for the feedback so far.  To provide some more information, I am getting ready to develop a JMX probe suite (based off PSI Probe) that would provide for multiple JVMs/hosts aggregated to a dashboard UI running on another server.  It's a personal project that should pretty much teach me every Java technology I can think of.  From the comments so far, it sounds like backend applications are easier on Eclipse (web services, jdbc connections, etc) and web apps (GUI, mostly?) is better with Netbeans.

It also seems IntelliJ has a following, I'd honestly never thought about it after seeing it just once, but I'd be willing to get it a try as well depending on where it fits in my particular workflow.

    if (foo != null)

Assignment would work with default values.

would be the same as

    Thing foo = ...
    Thing baz = null;
    if (foo != null)

You could also be allowed to change the default value:

    Thing foo = ...
    Thing baz = foo?&lt;Thing.DEFAULT&gt;.bar();

would be

    Thing foo = ...
    Thing baz = null;

    else
        baz = Thing.DEFAULT; //In this case, this assignment could be moved to the top, but if it has side effects/is potentially slow it would need to be in an else

This would be really useful with a lot of common patterns

    File baz = getConfiguration().get(""baz"")?&lt;new File(""~/.config/baz"")&gt;.getFile();

Besides the obvious benefit in reducing verbosity, it would also help with some common errors (for example, `getFoo()?.bar` might be incorrectly manually written with `getFoo()` called twice, once to check null and one to assign, which may cause hard-to-track-down bugs if `getFoo()` has side-effects, whereas the compiler would do it right every time), and might be easier for the compiler to optimize than a large-ish block of assignments and ifs.",,False,,t5_2qhd7,False,,,True,t3_xz665,http://www.reddit.com/r/java/comments/xz665/is_it_just_me_or_would_a_not_null_shorthand_be/,

The result is the code hosted over at github, which you can find [HERE](https://github.com/alihelmy/lwjglTutorial)

Now there are a couple of areas where you can help so we can get this port into anything useful

1. Most obviously of course, **Fork the code, improve it, debug it, make it faster**, etc; SEND ME YOUR PULL REQUESTS :)
2. **Continue on with the later arcs** unfortunately due to other distractions in life, I only completed the port of the basics arc in the wikibook. You could perhaps continue with the other arcs and provide code for them
3. **Documentation** While the original book itself is well written, I could only port over the code and by time even in-line documentation started to fall away. To make this resource stand-alone it needs better 'explanation' type of documentation, which I absolutely suck at. If anyone can write these up, I'll create a simple web-page through github-pages for the project and post them up

In any case, I sincerely hope this might be of any benefit to anyone. Your feedback is most welcome, and I hope anyone with some spare time would donate it to this

Swing is the default choice, but I have yet to encounter a Swing application that didn't look, at the very least, quite dated and clunky (subjective, I know, but with GUIs it's hard to avoid aesthetic judgements).

I notice that the new Bitcoin client now uses QT with Java bindings, and does have an attractive user interface, but this has the disadvantage that it is no-longer pure Java.

So much of what I find when I search for Swing-related libraries is 5 years old or older, even though the aesthetics of desktop applications have evolved significantly since then.

[Original post](http://www.reddit.com/r/java/comments/l846d/would_anyone_else_be_interested_in_an_rjava/)


The first task is based on a programming kata by Kent Beck [RomanNumerals](http://www.codingdojo.org/cgi-bin/wiki.pl?KataRomanNumerals). The object of the task is that you take any number up to 3000 and convert it to Roman numerals. 

The roman numberals are 

* I, 1
* V, 5
* X, 10
* L, 50
* C, 100
* D, 500
* M, 1000

As an example given the input 1459 your application should print MCDLIX. You do not need to convert numbers higher than 3000. 


I'm reccomending doing this using [TDD](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test-driven_development). If there are any questions or you need any help then just ask! I'll be posting a solution shortly but I'm advising you try it first then look at the other solutions. The whole point of this is that we code review each others solutions and I'll post the best one here before we start the next one! (hopefully)


Because the solutions might be quite large I proposing we use [paste bin](http://pastebin.com/)


And remember, have fun!

I just want to get involved in some way right now, or the very near future. So I have a few questions.

1) Is it a good idea to get certified or is it just a waste of money?

2) Which certification path do you think is good a good one to follow? Right now I'm thinking of getting a ""Professional"" cert

http://education.oracle.com/pls/web_prod-plq-dad/db_pages.getpage?page_id=458&amp;get_params=p_track_id:OCPJSE7

and then getting a Java EE cert.

3) A big problem is that before I can get a ""Professional"" cert I have to take the ""Associates"" cert first, according to them. And each cert is $300, so $600 just to get to the ""Professional"" level and I'm a college student with no money. I'm already familiar with all of the ""Associates"" and most of the ""Professionals"" subject matter, so is there a way to skip over the ""Associates"" and go straight to the ""Professional"" cert? 

That's about it, are there any other recommendations that you have that I should pursue instead? Oh and I'm in the Northern Virginia area too.

I went to a bookstore today, so I could buy Head First Java and finally learn this damn thing. But as I was proceeding to checkout, a random guy came out of the blue and said I should get the Deitel one instead.
As I know nothing about the topic, I decided that the best solution would be to ask this amazing subreddit.
Keep in mind I know pretty much nothing about programming, except that a couple of years ago I learned Pascal.So I'm pretty sure I need a beginner's book.
Here's the link to the two books:

So... Did you try Scala and you didn't like it? Why not?

Please, no flame war and ""X rocks/ Y sucks"" comments, I have little interest in that. If you're going to share your experience, a short paragraph describing what problems you encountered with Scala will be great.

It's just the language I'm most comfortable with, even though I've used several other languages professionally.  Anyway, I just enjoy the fact that I can do more, in less time, and I don't have to deal with details for most of what I'm trying to accomplish.

I also love gaming, but Java jobs seem few and far between in the gaming industry.  I don't even have to work on the games themselves, but I'd love to work in the gaming industry.

What are other redditor's thoughts about this?

**Update (7/29/2013):** Thanks everyone!  Great conversation and tips.  Indeed, I agree with many of the comments here.  I don't personally enjoy C++, and I do think it's one of the best tools for triple A games, so I won't work on those games.  I really enjoy server and web programming, and think it's a fascinating field.  Particularly for projects that have meaty back end infrastructure.  I dug into the links below and am particularly excited about these jobs:

http://us.blizzard.com/en-us/company/careers/directory.html#region=Americas;search=,java,

I live in Southern California, and I reached out to some Blizzard folks through friends on FB, and managed to grab a lunch.  I am surprised that they have such positions and such challenges.  Seems like most people just think about game programming jobs when it comes to game companies.

Anyway, thanks for the great discussion below.  Cheers!

So where do I go from here? I'm a freshman CS major and I wanna get an internship this summer but I feel so inadequate whenever I look at any job or internship ads because they all expect you to know so much more than just the language and core standard library.

**Build Tools?** Ant? Maven? Gradle?

**Databases?** SQL? PostgreSQL? ORM? Hibernate? JPA? MongoDB?

**Web development?** Spring? Struts? GWT? DOM? jQuery? AJAX? XML? JSON? SOAP? REST?

**Java EE?** Servlets? JavaBeans? JBoss? Tomcat? Jetty? GlassFish? JSP? JSF?

**And there's more?** Commons? Guava? CDI? Guice? Hadoop?


When will the madness end? I feel so overwhelmed, and I don't know where to start or how to tackle any particular framework or technology.

I am an experienced computer programmer (currently working with C++) and I would like to learn Java. Although I have written (fairly basic) Java programs in the past, my knowledge of this language is very modest. I would like to obtain a solid foundation and then build upon it.

Currently I am having a bit of difficulty finding the proper books to help me in my journey. Before I got where I am today, it took me quite a while to come across books such as ""The C++ Programming Language"", the Effective/Exceptional series, etc. because the market is saturated and there are many other (less qualitative) publications.

Thus I am asking experienced Java developers for a bit of guidance. I am looking for quality-driven, thorough, established books (classics, if you'd like, even though the publication date of their latest editions makes little difference) on Java. I do not need an introduction to programming in general, nor am I looking for the ""easy to read"" resources which seem so popular these days. Although I have nothing against technical texts which try to keep the reader's attention through various amusing phrases or images (Learn you a haskell, Land of lisp, Head first *).. I do have something against leaving out technical information as a consequence.

GridBagLayout is the best overall layout manager but it can still go berserk sometimes, e.g. with JScrollPanes or wrappable text.

BorderLayout works very well for what it is, but it can only do basic layout jobs.

Apart from that, layout code always seems to need *endless* nested JPanels each with their own layout managers and EmptyBorders and setPreferredSize hacks.

Basically I'm in java 1.6 (1.6.0_38 if it matters) and I need to use an XSL I've written to transform an XML document to an HTML document.  Now I had written something a while back that worked until my boss wanted some of the timestamps in the XML to be reformatted.  I don't have access to anything fancy like Altova or  Saxon, just the bundled Xalan XSLT Transformer implementation that comes with the JDK, so I'm restricted to XSLT 1.0, which is unfortunate.

Anyway, I found EXSLT, which uses XSL imports, and included the format-date function from their site and got it working locally.  I was testing by running the same maven build that our jenkins server runs.  When I tried actually executing the code in an real integration test on our dev server it failed.  When I had gotten it working originally I had used .getResource() and pulled something from that URI to use a SystemId with the TransformerFactory but when the application is deployed it's bundled into a jar along with an apparently custom written container and executed.  So SystemId is kindof useless I gather since I'm inside a jar file.  I reworked my code to instead use a quickly hacked together URIResolver that did the same getClass().getClassLoader().getResourceAsStream() that I did to get the first xsl figuring I needed it to get the relatively imported EXSLT files.  This worked locally but failed when jenkins ran the tests and when the application actually ran.  According to server logs the URIResolver I wrote was never even called apart from when I called the constructor to pass it in.  I have no idea why.  All I ever saw was

ERROR: 'null'  
FATAL ERROR: 'Could not compile stylesheet'

Eventually I gave up when google ran dry and switched my xsl to use the xmlns:java=""http://xml.apache.org/xslt/java"" namespace and called static functions to do the date formatting, and this worked locally but again all I got when I ran in Jenkins was that null error.  At one point I even commented out my entire xsl except the stylesheet tag and output description and that still gave the same error.

At this point I've given up and written a fugly pure-java with HTML templates and XPath queries just get something that functions but I really feel like I need to figure out, or at least come up with a plausible reason, why what seems like it should have worked and what did work locally didn't work on the server.

1364258916.0,14,self.java,1b0eyy,How do I isolate an open source JAR behind an API without introducing version conflicts?,21,7,15,http://www.reddit.com/r/java/comments/1b0eyy/how_do_i_isolate_an_open_source_jar_behind_an_api/,"I've recently inherited some legacy infrastructure used by a large number of applications in our environment.  Some of this infrastructure was built pre-1.2, so it's got some core pieces that are widely covered nowadays by open source tools.  One piece of infrastructure in particular is logging.  The design of this solution is pretty good and very log4j-like, though it pre-dates log4j.  There are many thousands of lines of code that reference this logging API spread over literally hundreds of apps, so I'm not ready to redo all of that.  However, I have a need to make some changes to the underlying implementation, and I'd like to plug log4j under the existing API as it has most of the features I need.  

All that is pretty straight forward, but here comes the rub - I want to use a particular implementation of log4j.  But given the large amount of apps that already exist, there are several versions of log4j already in various apps (don't ask why given the infrastructure - just go with me on this).  How do I use my version of log4j and avoid version collisions with apps that already have it?

One option that has come to mind is to instantiate my own classloader and load my version of log4j in it, behind the existing infrastructure.  Then, when I need to call log4j, I call it via my custom loaded version.  Would that work?  Is there a better way?  OSGi looks like a possible approach, but given the legacy nature of this environment, that's a bigger leap than I think I can take on right now.  Looking for other options I'm not considering.

TL;DR:  Need to load a specific version of an open source JAR that is already used by many apps, and I want to isolate my version to avoid version conflicts.  I've got an API to implement this behind, so what's the best way, especially if OSGi isn't an option?

So, this may be a silly question, but here we go.

Now I want to do serious development (for academic purposes, so not *that* large scale).

What's the best setup for Java on linux (ubuntu)? I remember from back in the days 3 or 4 flavours of Java co-existing on my system, and things not working terribly well.

Which flavour should I go for if I want to use Java professionally? How do I install it and make sure it's the main one used?

Is Eclipse still the best thing in town? (never liked it, always used gedit, but I guess I'll have to change my ways)

Would I use the same setup for writing smartphone apps? (as a hobby, not part of the job)

Thank you all in advance!

**Update:** Thanks a lot for all the detailed answers!

So it looks like the java situation got a bit better on linux, and openJDK is a solid version. Good to know.

*IDE-wise*: many votes for eclipse, but intelliJ and netbeans are good alternatives. I'll give each a go.

*Android dev*: Eclipse is preferable.

Also important point that is shared by many: get java from the repositories,but the IDEs directly from the original websites (easier to configure, up-to-date and less bloated).",,False,,t5_2qhd7,True,,,True,t3_rmcyk,http://www.reddit.com/r/java/comments/rmcyk/workflow_best_setup_for_developing_in_java_on/,
