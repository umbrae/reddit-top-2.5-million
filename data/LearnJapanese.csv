Often times radicals in kanji will be there to hint at a kanji's meaning or reading. In the case of pigeon (鳩), it's totally different. Let's break it down:

    九 = nine

    鳥 = bird

Voltron the two together into a single kanji and you get 鳩, which means pigeon.

Now, the 九 (nine) isn't there because pigeons come in packs of nine. It's there because of the reading of the 九, which is く (ku). It also happens to be the sound a pigeon makes (""kuu kuuuuu""), which, supposedly, is why that radical is used. It's like an encrypted message inside a kanji.

Other examples include:

* 蚊 = mosquito (虫 + 文). Mosquitos make a ""bunn bunnn"" noise, which is also the reading of the 文 portion of the kanji. It's like saying it's the ""bunnn bunnn insect"" (where 虫 means insect).

* 鴉 = crow/raven (牙 + 鳥). Crows make a ""gaa gaaa"" sound. The reading of 牙? Of course, it's ""ga"" as well. This is the ""ga bird.""

* 猫 = (animal radical + 苗). In China, cats make a myou myou sound (unlike Japan, which is nya nya). China gets the final say here, since they made kanji. The reading of 苗 is みょう, which makes a cat the ""myou animal"" (aka the animal that says ""myou"").

Saw this on the show 日本人の知らない日本語 (Japanese Japanese people don't know). Really interesting stuff if you're learning Japanese. Kind of useless, but interesting.

1360569174.0,141,self.LearnJapanese,18aroz,"As promised, an introduction to how to use NHK News Web Easy for different ability levels.",149,8,18,http://www.reddit.com/r/LearnJapanese/comments/18aroz/as_promised_an_introduction_to_how_to_use_nhk/,"First, for those who haven't heard of this pretty awesome source yet, [here's a link](http://www3.nhk.or.jp/news/easy/). NHK News Web Easy is a version of the NHK News Web site made for school children and Japanese language students. It has 3 news articles per day with audio, furigana and a link to the ""full version"" article (with video) on the NHK News Web site.

[Screenshot with what buttons do](http://i.imgur.com/o1a7DBg.jpg). Incidentally, if you want to use the furigana, you'll probably need to use Chrome, or look up a Ruby plugin for your favourite browser. This screenshot was in Chrome.

**IMPORTANT NOTE:** The audio is read by a real person - an NHK announcer in fact. This is a big deal because the Japanese used by NHK is the de facto ""standard Japanese"". The pronunciation and intonation is therefore ""perfect"" by definition. Don't listen to the people who complain that the voice is computer-generated, because it isn't. The audio quality can be pretty poor a lot of the time, but that's because it's encoded at a very low bitrate (32kbps MP3).

How best to use it will come down to you and your needs, but as I've been using the site through lower intermediate levels up to an ""advanced"" level of Japanese, I thought I might be able to give some suggestions. And that's all these are - suggestions!

**Beginner Level:** Look up the words you don't know (furigana helps for this) and try to read along with the speaker. Go over parts that you don't understand and see whether you can make out the meaning. At this point if you can get the general idea of the article I think you're doing pretty good. Optionally, grab some words you think could be useful and make flash cards (I like Anki for this). Also the button to the right of the audio link is pretty cool because it highlights names of people, places and companies (different colour for each) so you don't accidentally try to look up what ""Akihabara"" or ""Toyota"" means.

**Upper beginner/lower intermediate:**

* Listening practice: Listen first without looking at the script, then look up words you didn't know by checking the script. Listen again and see if you can't get a good idea of what is being said. Finally, read the script along with the audio. Extra points for reading it out loud with the audio.

* Reading practice: Read through once without looking up any words. You should be able to get at least a vague idea of the meaning. Look up the words you didn't know then read through again. The second or third time through, you can read along with the audio.

**Upper Intermediate:**

* Reading: Read through the script. You can probably guess the meaning of words you don't know, but look them up if you can't (some articles have some technical words, and these often have Japanese explanations provided - just hover over the underlined words). Once you know what it's saying, click through to the original NHK News Web article and read that. You'll already know what it's about, so it should be pretty straightforward to read. If the easy article is too easy, skip it and go straight to the regular News Web. I also recommend using a browser that doesn't support furigana (or turning off Ruby in your browser settings).

* Listening: As with reading, listen to the audio once or twice then look up words you didn't know (or couldn't make out from the audio). Go on to watch the video (the video script is on the NHK News Web page if you're struggling). If that's too easy, skip the easy audio.

* Speaking: Since the audio is pretty slow and in NHK Japanese, it makes a good resource for shadowing. Listen first to the audio alone (no looking at the script!) and repeat out loud after the speaker everything they say, taking care to imitate the intonation and pronunciation they use. Go over it again using the script provided (feel free to use furigana, seeing as you're focussing on pronouncing correctly, not reading), then once more with no script. Over time this will help you to get better at pronouncing and intonating well in standard Japanese.

**Advanced:**

* Shadowing: See above point. This is the major benefit of News Web Easy for advanced learners, and the main way that I've been using it lately. If it's easy enough (I find it depends a bit on how technical the article is), skip the ""look at the script"" step.

* Reading and Listening practice: Just go to the main News Web. Even better, start at the main [NHK website](http://nhk.or.jp/) and go from there. There are other NHK News websites with harder levels than News Web (which is just scripts of news videos). Also try out some of the other big news sites like [Yomiuri Online](http://www.yomiuri.co.jp) for more native-level news texts.

EDIT2: Also, we would like to hear what you think of the game and have created a short (10 Q) survey available on the download page. Let us know what you think!

EDIT3: Wow, looks like most people have good things to say about it. I am feeling especially motivated to push the game to the next level so you can all expect an update sooner rather than later. As far as updates are concerned, I will continue to post milestones to reddit via [r/sanjigenjiten](http://www.reddit.com/r/sanjigenjiten), and eventually at sanjigenjiten.com (currently non-existent, don't bother going)

EDIT4: Just clear up a few things that a lot of people have mentioned:

* Audio is not yet implemented (we will add it in ~v2.5 or so once we have all the words figured out)
* You can switch to Kana mode in the Language Options on the Main Menu (we will add hotkey support soon)
* You can toggle locking the camera to FPS mode with the ""E"" key
* Mouse Sensitivity option has already been programmed for the next release

In the spirit of free education I have decided to keep Japanese In Context available for FREE forever to those who are interested.  I know that not everyone has a spare $29 -- and even $1 to PERSON A is not the same amount to PERSON B possibly living in a different country.

Everyone deserves the opportunity to educate themselves.

Following the fairest model I think that exists, Japanese In Context is now a 'Pay What You Think Is Fair' system with the option to take it for FREE.

Under 'Redeem A Coupon', if you wish to take it free of cost, the promo code is:

""$0""

If you feel you would like to support the course, the promo code under 'Redeem a Coupon' will be the amount you think is FAIR and what you could afford.

Example:

""$1"" --&gt; The course will be $1.


""$17"" --&gt; The course will be $17.

""$0"" --&gt; The course will be FREE.

  
This will be probably be the last time I write about the course here because this subreddit should be used for helping each other study Japanese and not for personal promotion.  

So thank you to everyone who has shown interest and for the thoughtful feedback.

Enjoy everyone! ありがとうございます！

Hi everyone. I am a Japanese to English translator living in Japan and have just finished putting together an immense online Japanese course:

https://www.udemy.com/japanese-in-context/

If you would like to take it for free just enter the promo code ""$0"".  If you feel you can afford to pay a bit, choose any amount you can afford between $0 (free) and $29 as the promo code. For example even ""$1"" works.

All material is fully downloadable to keep forever by the way.

Actually, there are only about 9650 or so, but it's good. 

However, you will need to edit it a bit to your liking. All the facts only have one card each that has all the information on it. You need to go into the settings and create the cards you want. Decide what you want on the back and front. 

How I use it, there are 5 cards for each word. 

Card one: Show me the word

Card two: Word audio

Card three: Show me the furigana only

Card four: Show me the English translation for the word

Card five: Listen to the sentence

After each answer it plays audio for me (usually the full sentence)
I keep the entire deck paused and just un-pause words as I want to learn them.

Anyway, you can do whatever you want, but it does take some customizing. 

good luck!

To get the most out of it:

* Know your kanji via Remembering the Kanji (highly recommended)

* Have some background already in Japanese and be to the point where you want to start reading Japanese.

* Patience

1344748027.0,91,self.LearnJapanese,y2yon,I learned almost 300 Kanji in 5 weeks. After being VERY behind in my Kanji knowledge I feel incredible and want to share with everyone how I did it. ,105,14,60,http://www.reddit.com/r/LearnJapanese/comments/y2yon/i_learned_almost_300_kanji_in_5_weeks_after_being/,"I have been studying Japanese for about 5 years and I have always been behind in my kanji. I read so many opinions on how to improve my knowledge and nothing seemed to be working for me. Finally, 5 weeks ago, I sat down with my Kanji Poster and marked off all the ones I knew. It was a pathetic number. So that day I wrote down 8 kanji and tried to memorize them. 

I used a 1,2,1,2,3,1,2,3,4 method where I would look up the first one repeat it out-loud, look up the second, go back to the first etc. (I hope that makes sense.) I then wrote down all the ones I wanted to learn and decided on learning 8 a day. I would look them all up during my break at lunch time. Then go back to them 15 minutes later, then any free time I had before I went home from work, and finally once when I got home to tell my s.o. which ones I learned that day. 

Then, on the weekends, I would go back to my kanji poster (the jouyou) and see how many I knew. Any ones that I was interested in, or looked cool along the way I would look up immediately. Then I would count them up again. I can't believe how much I have improved.

There was always a few problems I ran into with kanji that stopped me from studying them properly. 

1.) I always tried to study at the end of the day, when my brain was too tired. My brain just isn't in it, and I felt learning was a struggle at the end of the day. So now I keep it a short review at night and leave all the other work for times when I am more awake. 

2.) People always told me to learn kanji in compounds, which never worked for me because when you learn a compound that you don't know the kanji for, you are learning 4 different things at the same time: Each kanji meaning, each kanji pronunciation, the meaning of them together, and the pronunciation of them together. This might work for some people, but for me it was overwhelming. 

3.) Everyone recommended Anki, which is a great program. However, I don't have access to a computer on my break at work and at the end of the day, I was too tired. Plus I feel like writing them down, and having to look at them in your own writing helps jog your memory sometimes. 

My tips for studying kanji: First of all, find a way that works for you, don't rely on what everyone says will work. (even me!) Second, find a time of day when you are fresh and your brain wants to work. Third, review as much as you can, whenever you have time. Another thing is to make up some stories! I heard RTK helps you do this but I never used it. After you have a base knowledge of the first 200 or so you can do it easily I think. Finally, find a partner, or someone you can be accountable to, I have even taken to posting how many I know on Facebook, it has really kept me going. 

TL;DR: I am proud of myself for finally finding a way to learn kanji that works for me. Here is my (probably useless) instructions on how I did it. Sorry to waste your time!!",,False,,t5_2qyls,False,,,True,t3_y2yon,http://www.reddit.com/r/LearnJapanese/comments/y2yon/i_learned_almost_300_kanji_in_5_weeks_after_being/,
1370422917.0,89,self.LearnJapanese,1fpmc6,Feynman on Japanese,109,20,123,http://www.reddit.com/r/LearnJapanese/comments/1fpmc6/feynman_on_japanese/,"&gt; After visiting a number of universities I spent some months at the
Yukawa Institute in Kyoto. I really enjoyed working there. Everything was so
nice: You'd come to work, take your shoes off, and someone would come and
serve you tea in the morning when you felt like it. It was very pleasant.


&gt;While in Kyoto I tried to learn Japanese with a vengeance. I worked
much harder at it, and got to a point where I could go around in taxis and
do things. I took lessons from a Japanese man every day for an hour.


&gt;One day he was teaching me the word for ""see.""


&gt;""All right,"" he said. ""You want to say, 'May I see your garden?' What
do you say?""


&gt; I made up a sentence with the word that I had just learned.


&gt;""No, no!"" he said. ""When you say to someone, 'Would you like to see my
garden? you use the first 'see.' But when you want to see someone else's
garden, you must use another 'see,' which is more polite.""

&gt;""Would you like to glance at my lousy garden?"" is essentially what
you're saying in the first case, but when you want to look at the other
fella's garden, you have to say something like, ""May I observe your gorgeous
garden?"" So there's two different words you have to use.

&gt;Then he gave me another one: ""You go to a temple, and you want to look
at the gardens...""

&gt;I made up a sentence, this time with the polite ""see.""


&gt;""No, no!"" he said. ""In the temple, the gardens are much more elegant.
So you have to say something that would be equivalent to 'May I hang my eyes
on your most exquisite gardens?'

&gt; Three or four different words for one idea, because when I'm doing it,
it's miserable; when you're doing it, it's elegant.


&gt;I was learning Japanese mainly for technical things, so I decided to
check if this same problem existed among the scientists.

&gt;At the institute the next day, I said to the guys in the office, ""How
would I say in Japanese, 'I solve the Dirac Equation'?""


&gt;They said such-and-so.


&gt;""OK. Now I want to say, 'Would you solve the Dirac Equation?' -- how do
I say that?""

&gt; ""Well, you have to use a different word for 'solve,' "" they say.

&gt; ""Why?"" I protested. ""When I solve it, I do the same damn thing as when
you solve it!""

&gt; ""Well, yes, but it's a different word -- it's more polite.""

&gt;I gave up. I decided that wasn't the language for me, and stopped
learning Japanese.",,False,,t5_2qyls,False,,,True,t3_1fpmc6,http://www.reddit.com/r/LearnJapanese/comments/1fpmc6/feynman_on_japanese/,

So I've been looking around for a bit for something like this, and I thought you guys would like it.

What It basically does is, when you mouse over any Kanji, It tries to detect it and show you the meaning of it. I use it when reading raw manga, because It's a huge pain and a waste of time trying to look up those complicated Kanji.

Thankfully, It's programmed in Java, so It's supported by all Operating Systems.

To remedy this, I'm going to give you nubs some links that will get you going:


[Tofugu's List of Japanese Resources](http://www.tofugu.com/japanese-resources/)


[More Resources.. (categorized by ability level)](http://gakuu.com/resources/)


Some of the resources mentioned in those links may overlap or repeat, but you will find -almost- everything you need to study. All that remains for you to do is to be dedicated and self-motivated. Japanese is not an easy language to learn and sometimes it seems just as you've broken through, you've got another wall to climb. Keep at it. Use the resources. Have fun!

1366050956.0,76,self.LearnJapanese,1cekmm,I wrote this email to a friend asking how I got fluent in Japanese,116,40,49,http://www.reddit.com/r/LearnJapanese/comments/1cekmm/i_wrote_this_email_to_a_friend_asking_how_i_got/,"**EDIT: To be clear, my friend is learning Portuguese but swap all the Brazil/Portuguese to Japan/Japanese and the advice holds true.**

I hear ya. To get to real fluency you need to make a big commitment. Here is what genuinely worked for me. A lot of it you probably can't do because I was a student and had some freedom, but there is plenty of doable stuff. It took me 2 years to get to respectable conversational level and after 3 years I had completely arrived.

---

**Stuff I did that you probably don't have time for:**

1- I took college classes. They are really, really helpful for getting the fundamentals down. I took classes at three schools. The Ivy one was by far the highest level of instruction. If there is any chance you can audit classes on the weekend or something you should IMO. Boston has some fantastic schools, dude. The Ivy was expensive but worth every penny.

2- I studied abroad in Japan for a year. That was how I got from functional understanding to true conversational fluency. Are there Brazilian bars, clubs, meetup groups, soccer leagues, etc in Boston? If so, go join them ASAP and make a bunch of friends who primarily speak Portuguese to each other. Nothing will replace you being around and interacting with native speakers as much as possible.

---

**Stuff I did on my own that was critical:**

1- Translate a fuck-ton of stuff. I learned to love it and did it as a hobby. I got really into translating Japanese song lyrics and TV shows especially. Your early translations will suck but **there is no better way to learn a bunch of vocabulary than by translating things.** You want to find a peer group of like-minded people to share your translations with so you can learn from one another. I am sure there are great communities for such things. Check [viki.com](http://viki.com). Also look for Youtube channels. When guys talk about their ""10,000 hours to mastery"" they are talking about shit like this. Learn to love it. Listen to portuguese music (who doesn't like bossanova anyway) and write out lyrics. Carry a notebook with you.

2- Start blogging in shitty portuguese ASAP. Make internet friends. I used to do this on a Japanese site called mixi but I know there are humongous Brazilian communities online. Check Orkut and other places. I used to use these social networks for making friends, interacting in the foreign language, learning about the culture and various interests, and of course meeting and fucking chicks. I probably fucked 30 Japanese girls from mixi. They probably have meetups and parties in Boston all the time, dude. Seek that shit out.

3- Consume media in your free time. Watch TV, read books, watch movies, listen to music. Learn to love it. Absorb that shit by osmosis. Learn about their pop culture. Language is heavily influenced by pop culture. Watch their shitty morning TV shows on Youtube or wherever they get posted online.

4- Make an active effort to use every new grammar pattern &amp; word you learn the same day you learn it. Work it into conversation or a blog post. Try to use it 3 or more times if possible. This is a lot easier when you're living in the country and can go to a bar and talk to strangers, but **you must do this or you will not remember the shit you learn.**

5- Make friends who speak the language. Get some Brazilian girlfriends who will watch shitty Portuguese TV shows and movies with you and can explain things you don't understand.

6- Travel to the country. There is no way to fake this. I went to Japan about 15 times between 2002 and 2011.

---

There are really 3 things you need to study to reach real fluency:

**Grammar:** The only way to learn is brute force. Get yourself some good textbooks and study the grammar patterns until you master them. Use them every single day. If you don't understand something, ask someone who speaks the language better than you. Try to translate things and ask people to critique your translations to make sure you are really understanding the grammar.

**Vocabulary:** Translation &amp; media consumption are your friends here. You cannot memorize vocabulary from a book, there are too many words and your brain will not retain shit.

**Cultural references:** Media consumption &amp; interaction with natives. They are open to sharing their culture with you, whether online or in person. You need to understand the culture to get fluent. Also showing a genuine interest in their culture sets you apart from the rest of the whiteboys who are just in it for the pussy. You will have a much easier time making friends and bedding hot girls if you show some real interest in their culture.

Expect to make a real commitment if you want to reach fluency. The beauty of it is, once you truly get fluent, you don't forget it. It's something you carry with you for the rest of your life.

Got any more?,90,17,81,http://www.reddit.com/r/LearnJapanese/comments/1jqd9e/discoveries_i_wish_i_had_made_when_i_first/,"Hey guys.. some may be incorrect or not quite evidenced enough...  but here are some things I have discovered I wish I knew when I first started. If it helps anyone... that'd be cool.

1. Each column of かな represents a different verb stem ending and each column serves its own purpose as can be seen here ---&gt;
http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/68/AMB_Japanese_Verbs.pdf/page1-800px-AMB_Japanese_Verbs.pdf.jpg

2. There is no such thing as て form, it is just a slurring of the continuative stem form (known as 連用形) with the で particle. Almost like ""isn't"" in regards to how it is a compounded ""Is not"". I don't know why they don't teach like this...
食べ ＋ て = 食べて ////
泳ぎ＋で ＝泳いで

3. Potential form is once again the stem form (連用形) joined to the verb ~える (which means to acquire). Basically you do the action and acquire… I dunno… the results.
泳ぎ+ える = 泳げる

4. Similarly, the passive form uses the negative form called 未然形 (みぜんけい)  combined with what I presume is also 得る. Thereby giving it the feeling of you not doing the action, but still receiving it.
ころす ころさ + える  殺される

5. Again, the 未然形 + させる (a verb which means “to elect someone to do something”) is used to say “I made someone do something.” In other words “I don’t do the action, someone else does”. There is some more slurring or changing involved in non-る verbs.

飲む ――＞ のま ＋ させる ――＞ 飲ませる ////
食べ ＋ させる ＝食べさせる

6. Xみたいだ is not a grammatical point that stemmed from 見たい but rather emerged form Ｘを見たようだ. It too was slurred and became みたいだ That is why is has the same meaning as のようだ but is more casual.

1359956927.0,73,self.LearnJapanese,17upto,サザエさん-popular kids anime about a traditional Japanese family household,83,10,13,http://www.reddit.com/r/LearnJapanese/comments/17upto/サザエさんpopular_kids_anime_about_a_traditional/,"My Japanese friend recommended this series to me so I'll pass it along to you. 

For beginners and early intermediates trying to learn more ""practical"" everyday Japanese, you can watch サザエさん (sazae san) which is about a traditional Japanese family and their everyday life. 

A youtube search for サザエさん will bring up plenty of clips so it is fairly easy to find. Here's a direct link to one:

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aedP8w5e8tk

As for the language used, it is primarily the casual form with occasional polite or keigo forms when appropriate. Unlike most anime however, slang and overbearing accents are kept to a minimum other than the usual gobi. For example you'll often hear サザエさん end her statements with the feminine わ. The topics are more for daily home life so you won't get into complicated explanations or advanced vocabulary as with listening to news programs.

**Cultural Tip:** In サザエさん the primary household consists of the traditional Japanese family which is 3 generations living under the same roof compared to the typical modern American household which is only 2 generations with the occasional much much older grandparent. In the traditional Japanese family, new Japanese couples often live within a parent's household even after having a child.

My Japanese friend said that this was becoming less common today, but most parents that would like their children to grow up in the traditional Japanese style will encourage Sazae-san over other children's programs.

So we will have a project beginning this Friday spanning to next Friday. For now, please leave a beginner level manga in the comments / message me with suggestions. I will most likely go with Yotsuba as a test run.

I have been learning Japanese for the past two years in my own spare time and have had a rekindling interest in manga and anime. Because of this, I have wanted to strengthen my skills. One idea that I thought could be fun would be to have a weekly translation project.

What I would like to do is begin with an easy to read beginner book with available English translations to check against. Over time and if people are interested, we could focus on intermediate books and then advanced. We could also take votes and see what receives the most popularity and translate those.

Another thing to support translations and gain interest would be to reward those who participate. Whoever does the most translations, most accurate translation, best notes, etc. could receive a prize.

For example, if we started with Yotsuba as the first book. It is very basic and has English translations available. For people that participate and meet certain goals, I would buy them a copy of the Yen Press edition to support its release. So there is no bias, I would allow the participants to decide the goals that need to be met for translations so no one feels they are being cheated.

For people that do not have access to the raw books / Japanese versions, I can always host them on my website. I could also label and number the Japanese text that needs to be translated, so people can write their matching translations in a Word document / numbering in a reddit post. Then #1 on their post would match up with #1 in the source.

The reason for this idea is that there are so many untranslated projects and I alone can not manage to translate them all. So many projects have been dropped and I have wanted a new translation team to pick them up or an official English release. But with a team of people that want to learn the language, I am sure we could translate our favorite manga, LNs, and other media that has gone untranslated.

Please let me know what you think of this idea and your input. Learning on my own is fun and rewarding, but I would like to do something with other people.",,False,,t5_2qyls,1369105787.0,,,True,t3_1epwtf,http://www.reddit.com/r/LearnJapanese/comments/1epwtf/would_anyone_be_interested_in_a_weekly/,

This is my first submission on Reddit. Usually I just comment or upvote what I like but today I learned something interesting so I thought I would contribute to this wonderful subreddit as well. 

I've wondered a lot about the small ヶ (read as カ or ガ). You see this one in words like ２ヶ国語 and ２ヶ月 as a counter. It is actually not a katakana but it's in fact a simplified version of the kanji 箇 (the bamboo part on top). Sometimes you also see it in place names like 霞ヶ関 (かすみがせき) or 桐ヶ丘 (きりがおか). In this context ヶ is no longer a counter, but a particle for conjunction much like の.

Likewise,  the 々 you come across in words like 時々 (ときどき) or 様々 (さまざま) is a simplification of the kanji 仝.

I tried it out yesterday, and after having a few conversations drop, I started chatting with a very nice person who was enthusiastic about talking with me and made some corrections to what I was saying. We chatted (slowly) for about two hours.

I really recommend this site - it's a great place to talk one-on-one with another person. And by the end of the conversation, I felt like I'd really loosened up and felt a lot more comfortable.

For people who don't get the opportunity to practice talking with Japanese speakers, it can help you work out a lot of the anxiety you might feel about making a misstep. Going into the chat, I was nervous about saying the wrong thing...and during the chat, there were several times when I did say the wrong thing, but it wasn't a big deal.

* **Put your question in the post title**.  Titles like ""A quick question"" or ""Grammar help"" are amazingly uninformative.
* Please consider the level of a question before you attempt to answer.  Comments like ""I'm a total beginner, but に means 'two', so I'm pretty sure that's a number instead of a particle"" are confusing both to the OP and to anyone else who reads the post.  Relevant information, similar questions, and even ""Oh, I was wondering about that, too"" are fine; random guesses are not.  One of the biggest criticisms of this sub is the lack of actual qualified Japanese instructors; please don't make it worse by making things up.
* Do not link to illegal/copyrighted content.  Everyone knows that torrents exist, and how to find them; there is no need to encourage people to pirate or to help them do so.
* Since the JLPT was last Sunday, please remember that posting the contents of the test is against the test rules (not the sub rules).  On the off chance that the NSA reports you to your country's testing authority, your score could be thrown out.  With that in mind, please don't post stuff like ""Questions from the test.""  Stuff like ""Vocabulary which coincidentally would have been useful last weekend by complete random chance wink wink"" is at your discretion.  (Note: the recent post containing JLPT questions/answers was deleted at the request of the OP.)

TL;DR:

* No ""how to get started"" questions
* No translation requests!
* Don't just guess answers
* No linking to illegal stuff
* Be careful about posting JLPT questions

Edit: Also, any post that uses the non-word ""romanji"" will be ridiculed by me in the privacy of my own home.

1351519653.0,59,self.LearnJapanese,129wsx,[Meta] On what is appropriate content for this subreddit,63,4,31,http://www.reddit.com/r/LearnJapanese/comments/129wsx/meta_on_what_is_appropriate_content_for_this/,"As anyone who's been a reddit user for a while knows, it's a general rule that as a subreddit grows in size, its content generally degrades. I believe this to be in part because of an influx of users who are not so well-informed on the subject that the subreddit deals with, meaning that the most popular posts will be those that are easy to understand for anyone -- generally humour posts and memes.

Seeing as /r/LearnJapanese recently passed 10 000 subscribers, I think it's high time to create a discussion around -- and ask the moderators to review the subreddit rules regarding -- posts that contribute nothing to neither the poster's nor the readers of the subreddit's endeavours in learning Japanese, especially seeing as there are currently no clear rules regarding what is appropriate content for this subreddit.

In my experience there are primarily three types of posts that show up here that I feel do not fit the subreddit:

**Firstly, humour and meme posts.** You see these in any growing subreddit. They can be anything from rage comics and advice animals, to simply ""funny posts"" that contribute nothing to the subreddit's goal (in the case of this subreddit, learning Japanese). Examples (and these are just from the current front page):

* http://www.reddit.com/r/LearnJapanese/comments/1299bf/using_wikipedia_in_japanese/
* http://www.reddit.com/r/LearnJapanese/comments/1264lp/so_while_studying_japanese_using_obenkyo_for/

**Secondly, posts exploiting the fact that this subreddit is visited by people somewhat proficient in Japanese and likely knowledgeable in Japanese-related matters, without the poster showing much, if any, intent on actually studying the language themself.** This can include posts asking for someone to translate Japanese without the poster providing their own attempt and thoughts, intent on getting free translation service. I have nothing against the concept of free translation service, but there are more appropriate subreddits. This also includes people trying to get others to do their homework for them, or people asking how to obtain Japanese media for purposes other than studying.

Examples:

* http://www.reddit.com/r/LearnJapanese/comments/10l44s/can_anyone_help_translate_this/
* http://www.reddit.com/r/LearnJapanese/comments/102v73/what_does_ハイスイノナサmean_in_english_its_an_awesome/
* http://www.reddit.com/r/LearnJapanese/comments/zcuh1/need_help_translating_letter/
* http://www.reddit.com/r/LearnJapanese/comments/zc3q9/can_anyone_translate_this_error_message_from/
* http://www.reddit.com/r/LearnJapanese/comments/yo6r0/can_someone_translate_the_text_on_this_image/
* http://www.reddit.com/r/LearnJapanese/comments/104pc5/place_to_watch_japanese_moviesdramas_mine_died/

**Thirdly, posts encouraging others to share their experiences that do not contribute to actually learning the language.** While I personally do not find this kind of post appropriate for this subreddit, I can see why others would want to allow them as they can in some instances be encouraging or contain helpful practical advice. I would, however, like to stress the fact that this is not /r/AskReddit. If you are, for example, looking for advice when going to Japan for the first time, ""I'm going to Japan for the first time, anything I need to keep in mind when it comes to approaching people?"" is a better post title than ""Please share your funny encounters with Japanese natives!"". Examples:

* http://www.reddit.com/r/LearnJapanese/comments/11bjkk/i_just_read_something_in_hirigana_it_made_me_so/
* http://www.reddit.com/r/LearnJapanese/comments/ycm0m/whats_the_most_embarrassingfunny_thing_you_have/

I'm sure there are other types of posts that I'm forgetting, so please don't limit the discussion to the types of posts mentioned above.

Please note that I am not trying to alienate newcomers to this subreddit; if someone comes with a question that truly is about learning Japanese, I would like to continue to see this subreddit being as welcoming as possible no matter the level of the question. Though I do think we should make the FAQ more visible -- for example by adding a very visible notice on the submission page.",,False,,t5_2qyls,False,,,True,t3_129wsx,http://www.reddit.com/r/LearnJapanese/comments/129wsx/meta_on_what_is_appropriate_content_for_this/,
1338369285.0,59,self.LearnJapanese,ubvm1,I created EPUB versions of Tae Kim's guides,67,8,39,http://www.reddit.com/r/LearnJapanese/comments/ubvm1/i_created_epub_versions_of_tae_kims_guides/,"Using the printer-friendly versions of the guides I tried my best to create nice EPUB versions using calibre. My main and only focus for now was on making a good table of contents which was a little difficult due to inconsistencies in the original.
I didn't change anything content-wise which means that there are still links to videos and audio which probably won't work. Note that for example in the Grammar Guide the given, original table of contents doesn't work and only links to the internet. In further versions I likely will edit it out but for now I prefered to not make any changes to the content itself.

I hope you can make good use of them on your respective ebook reader. And if you find any mistakes, please report them to me.

http://dropcanvas.com/3uqut

If you have any other Japanese resources which could be a nice to have on an ebook reader and need conversion I'd be happy to help out.

EDIT: I added mobi versions. However there wasn't any magic involved as I only used calibre's conversion preset. And I don't know if the Kindle has Japanese fonts. One could however create a custom PDF based on this EPUB.

EDIT2: If the Japanese characters are not displayed maybe you'd like to try the bigger version with Droid Sans Fallback embedded. I have to admit that as of now I don't have an dedicated ebook reader myself and thus rely on your feedback.

This versions seems to work the best. Calibre and Adobe Digital Editions have no problems with it.

EDIT3: To shortly explain what I did to embed the font: I have only put the Droid Sans Fallback in a fonts folder and referenced it in the stylesheet.css with @font-face { font-family: ""DroidFont"", serif, sans-serif; src:url(../Fonts/DroidSansFallback.ttf); } I could use some help here to get it working on more devices/readers. Adding a body { font-family: ""DroidFont"";} renders it only unusable on Adobe. Anymore ideas?

EDIT4: Today I was able to try out the font-embedded version on a PRS-T1 and it works.

I'd be open to Japanese podcasts as well, but so far the ones I've found have either been way too learner directed or way too fast.  I can handle relatively fast pasted Japanese in conversation, but podcasts don't allow the same interaction as conversation, and I'd really prefer having a visual to help me stay focused.

I'd be open to Japanese tv series as well, but I'd like something RAW that is relatively easy to obtain in the US (and I'd prefer something legally free) - I do have easy access to like Kinokuniya for purchasing materials, but I find the store to be a tad overwhelming to browse in Japanese without some clue of what I am looking for.

Here's the synopsis from Amazon:

&gt;Absolutely hilarious and educational book. Best seller in Japan. ""The Japanese the Japanese Don't Know"" is a collection of stories about a teacher of Japanese in Japan and her students, what sort of questions they ask, what sort of mistakes they make, etc. There's also a lot of interesting background on the Japanese language, like where certain words came from and such. For example, masu/desu is now standard Japanese, but it used to be geisha-speak. Men came to the capital, heard geisha speaking that way, and took it home and spread it, thinking it was the way everyone in the capital spoke. There was also a lot about keigo (formal speaking), and how even Japanese people get it wrong a lot. Highly recommended for intermediate/advanced Japanese students. All kanji with furigana reading.

If you're interested I'll be uploading the chapters here as I finish them: http://kalenxi.smugmug.com/Translations/NihonjinNoShiranaiNihongo1

Using them, I came up with a brand new most commonly used Kanji listing: http://jiten.us/final-ranks.csv

The differences between the columns them are explained at https://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Data_dumps/Dump_format. 

Basically, jawiki-latest-pages-meta-current.xml.bz2 is all articles, including talk and user pages, while jawiki-latest-pages-articles.xml.bz2 is just articles.

The first column is jawiki-latest-pages-articles.xml.bz2, while the second is jawiki-latest-pages-meta-current.xml.bz2. The third represents the rank change between the two (for example, 書 rose 81 ranks to rank 39 when talk/user pages are included compared to just articles. 方 rose 64 ranks between the two).

I am going to be using it in my new 辞典 (character dictionary) focused on English speakers learning Japanese, but I thought you might be interested in the data early. :) お楽しみにください！

Unfortunately you'll need a special supported device which means an Android, iDevice, or a newer kindle that has Japanese font support (Fire, paperwhite). PC apps aren't supported it seems.

The experience from the Android app:

* Built-in Japanese-Japanese dictionary, but no Japanese-English dictionary (there is an English-Japanese dictionary).
* The android version seems to lack dictionary search in the Japanese dictionary
* Appears to be no furigana marks
* When looking up non-conjugated words, the dictionary works well and gives you a reading.
* When looking up conjugated words (such as verbs) the dictionary doesn't work.
* Can't seem to copy selected text
* Included font is very readable/scalable (unlike kobo reader app)

Honestly the dictionary issues make this a tough one for learners. I've been waiting for an ebook reading experience in Japanese but not being able to copy text or easily lookup conjugated verbs/adjectives in the app is really disappointing. I wish there was either a way to tell it the dictionary form (I can usually guess) or to partial searches in the dictionary. The dictionary itself is just an ebook you can actually flip through but the order is by reading so you can't just look up a kanji and expect to find all words using that kanji on subsequent pages.

1346674822.0,51,self.LearnJapanese,z9zox,JLPT techniques--tricks and knacks for improving your score,64,13,31,http://www.reddit.com/r/LearnJapanese/comments/z9zox/jlpt_techniquestricks_and_knacks_for_improving/,"Since we all just got our JLPT scores (or are about to get them), and the JLPT cycle is about to restart, it might be a good idea to compile a list of tricks for taking the JLPT.

The JLPT, like all Japanese tests (as in, tests inside the country of Japan), does not actually measure your Japanese proficiency.  What it measures is your ability to study for the JLPT.  Thus, knowing the tests, and having a good study plan can make it *far* more easier than not.  Furthermore, there are two sections in particular that measure your test-taking abilities and *not* your Japanese proficiency, meaning that even native speakers might fail those two portions if they don't understand what is being asked.

Section one: The word order section.  Sample questions from this section look something like this:

&gt;昨日渋谷に＿＿＿ ＿＿＿＿ ＿＿★＿＿ ＿＿＿＿ 大変でした。

&gt;１）ので ２）にも ３）行けなかった ４）行こう

And then you have to write the number of the corresponding word that goes in the starred blank.

Upon first glance, it looks as though the question is trying to quiz you on how to form sentences in a natural word order.  *That is naively wrong!*  What the question is actually trying to quiz you on is the following: ""Do you know the grammatical pattern VようにもVれない?""  What's more, every single question in this format is quizzing you on whether or not you know some grammatical pattern--none of it is on, ""how to properly form Japanese sentences in normal word order.""

So, when you first see a question like this, you should think to yourself, ""do I see any grammatical patterns from the study guide that can be made out of these blank words, and possibly the words next to the blanks?""  If you studied the pattern VようにもVれない, then you will see the words 行こう （よう form of行く), にも, and 行けなかった (past form of 行けない).  Once you see those three, you know this question is asking for the VようにもVれない pattern.  So you hook those three words up together. 行こうにも行けなかった.  So then we only have one more blank word to put in, ので.  It can only go in the first or fouth blank, and it only makes sense in the fourth blank, so we have our answer: 行こう にも 行けなかった ので. 行けなかった matches the starred blank, so the answer is 3.  *Every question in this format is asking for a question like this!*

So to recap, the way to answer these questions is as follows:

1. Scan the blank words, and the surrounding words for a set grammatical pattern.

2. Fill in the blanks with that grammatical pattern.

3. There will only be one (maybe two) blanks which are left after the grammatical pattern has been written.

4. Fill in the remaining blanks in the only logical way.

5. Write down the number of the corresponding word for the starred blank.

Note: Be careful about some grammatical patterns where the last word may be filled in in the *inside* of the pattern.

So how do you prepare for these sections?  The answer is easy, but a huge pain in the ass:  Get a copy of 完全マスター文法 (of the appropriate level), and memorize every single grammar pattern in the textbook, including how it is linked to the surrounding words.  If you want to be thorough, then you can also use どんなときどう使う日本語表現文法辞典, however just 完全マスター should be sufficient.

(Note: My source for the information in this part is my Japanese professor this last semester who used to be a question-writer and question-evaluator for JLPT.  Kanzen master is his recommendation, and indeed, the textbook we used for the course.)

Section two: Listening comprehension (almost all of it)

Listening comprehension should really be called ""note-taking ability"", because that's what's necessary for it.  A given sample question may go something like this:

&gt;1: Did you do B yesterday?

&gt;2: No, I didn't.

&gt;1: What about A or D?

&gt;2: I did neither A nor D.

&gt;1: Well what about C?

&gt;2: You got me, I actually lied and did do that, and by that, I mean the first thing you asked me about.

or perhaps

&gt;1: Hey is this your phone number?

&gt;2: Let me see that.

&gt;2: Oh, this say 053-89-1836.  But that's a bit inaccurate. The 6 and the 7th digit are swapped around.

&gt;1: Oh, so it's like this?

&gt;2: Yeah, but now you have to swap the last two digits again.

&gt;1: Oh, like this?

&gt;2: Just like that!

While a bit of an exaggeration, virtually every question in the listening portions (aside from the short 3-answer portion) is like this.  Even if you speak perfectly fluent Japanese, it is highly likely that you will be confused by the list of options presented and the way the answer is given.  It is almost *never* easy to answer.  Actually, if you think you clearly hear them say, ""Oh yes, I did D,"" then it is almost a given that D is not the answer, and that they will later in the dialogue say ""Woops! I was joking about before!"".  So, how do you do this?  The answer is with taking notes.  When they say something, write down what they say.  It does not matter if you write it down in English, Japanese, kanji, kana, shorthand, your mother language, or what.  The only thing that matters is that the information in the dialogue goes through your brain and into your hand and onto the paper.  Just by writing it down, it will help you remember the information long enough to answer the questions.  For example, the following notes may be fine, between a brother and a sister:

&gt;B-did go to store?

&gt;S-no, I was school

&gt;B-You mean that school?

&gt;S-No, I mean school C.  (Where school C is actually a Dojo or something)

Something like that will be fine.  And even if you don't read the notes when you answer, having written them down will make it *so* much easier to remember when the answers are presented.

I know why you're here. You're worried that you're not going to make it. That you're going to fail at learning Japanese and all of your effort will be wasted. You don't know what to do and there's nobody to guide you. And it's not that you don't care enough to find what to do, you care a LOT. You care so much that these doubts keep you up at night. Perhaps you find yourself thinking, “Maybe I should start over. Do I need to research other methods? Am I doing any of this right?” And guess what.

These doubts are a good thing.

For all that they make you feel like crap, they're also a sign that you really want to learn Japanese. No, that you NEED to learn Japanese. But what should you do? What can you do when you suddenly find yourself buried in kanji, sentences, and lists of words with no end in sight. How can you possibly know that any of this is working; that you're on the right path and headed for the finish line?

Learning Japanese has no final goal line. There's no point at which you cross some mystical finish line and suddenly cheering crowds appear to present you with a plaque that says “JAPANESE MASTER.” While it sounds ridiculous, I think we find ourselves expecting this. We expect to see some loud, obvious sign that we're doing it right, but in reality we ignore the true signs of progress.

If you have an immersion environment, then you should be using Japanese media, right? Books, songs, shows, whatever. These are the signs of progress. If you're wondering if you're on the “right” path, if you're doing things “right,” then just pay attention to what you do each day. Do you read manga? Watch anime? Browse articles on the Japanese Wikipedia page? Sing along with J-Pop? Whatever it is you're doing, realize that you're doing it in Japanese. You're reading in Japanese. You're listening to a song and understanding the lyrics. Well guess what...

That IS the end goal! You've done it! Look at you! Immersed in Japanese and understanding so easily that you forget how absolutely amazing you are!! Learning Japanese can be so sneaky in the way that it happens; it's incredibly easy to forget how much progress we've made. So remind yourself. If you're feeling these doubts, then pause for a minute. Think about what you can do, what you've achieved. And then...

Take the next step.

When you're feeling this way, it means that you need to move. So take the next step. Grab that book off your shelf that you've been avoiding and give it a shot. Start watching that TV series that was ""too difficult"" for you before. Find that next thing in Japanese and do it. And when you do it, realize that this IS the end goal. This is it! If you can take something Japanese, be it a children's story, a manga for teens, or a tome on organic chemistry, and understand it - that is learning Japanese. You've done it. If you can read even one sentence, one word, one kana, then you've already learned Japanese. Now do it again with the next kana, word, sentence, or story.

So if you're feeling worried about your progress, just remember what you've already accomplished. Think of how far you've come. Then go forward. It doesn't matter what you go to next, just do something in Japanese. Don't worry. You're on the right path.

So, a big thank you for hearing me out when I had something to say about a new feature or wanted to talk more about some new learning method that people were interested in.

It sucks bringing a site out of beta and telling people, okay, if we're to grow, we will need to start charging a little bit of money. So after all that, I still wanted to give people who helped out in the beta SOMETHING for their efforts.  So I extended their time to freely use the site for another 30 days on their next login.  I hope that's worth something.  :)

Again, THANKS again for making Nihongo Master a really fun place to learn japanese. I promise we'll continue to make it better and if anyone has any thoughts or suggestions on what else to add, let me know either here or in a private message!

When you get to the point of using 「よ」 at the end of a sentence it may feel really natural just sticking it on whenever you want to be emphatic about your answer. However, sometimes it can come across extremely effeminate/homosexual. Fortunately there's a pretty strict rule to tell the difference. 

If you want to use the casual form + よ you sometimes need to add a だ beforehand. Add it whenever the preceding word is a な adjective or noun. If the preceding word is a verb or い adjective, don't add the だ before the よ.

Examples:

元気だよ(げんきだよ) - (normal)

元気よ(げんきよ) - (gay sounding)

可愛いよ(かわいいよ）- (normal)

可愛いだよ(かわいいだよ) - (weirdo, silly)

1325385508.0,48,self.LearnJapanese,ny74z,"Radicals, and what they mean.  ",57,9,14,http://www.reddit.com/r/LearnJapanese/comments/ny74z/radicals_and_what_they_mean/,"So I've heard a lot from various people in this subreddit about radicals, and it occurs to me that there are a lot of misconceptions floating around out there about what radicals actually are.  I've started this thread to open up a bit of discussion, as there surely must be a number of people more knowledgeable on this topic than I here, but in any case, consider this a presentation of radicals as a Japanese person interprets them.  

There's three main divisions of kanji,

    象形文字（しょうけいもじ）
    表意文字（ひょういもじ）
    表音文字（ひょうおんもじ）


The first, 象形文字 is pictographic.  They are direct representations of their meanings, and the building blocks of all other kanji.  For instance, 目、木、月 are all 象形文字。Most radicals are directly related to a 象形文字, and borrow ideographic content from the original kanji.  These need to be memorized, there's maybe not even 200 of these.

The second, 表意文字 is ideographic.  Characters like 上、下、末、末.  Compound ideograms also exist, such as 峠 , but for our purposes, this is as good as a 表意文字。These also need to be memorized, there's probably less than 100 of these.  

The most significant is this last group... 

表音文字 make up the vast majority of Kanji in Japanese, upwards to 75 percent of characters are said to be 表音文字。

In a 表音文字、there's two main parts to the kanji:  a part that donates a sound to the character, and a part that donates meaning to the character.  These two radicals are the part that need to be focused on, and making any divisions smaller than this is somewhat meaningless.  For instance, to divide 表 into 士 and 衣 is fairly meaningless, because 表 has a sound all it's own to it.  Functionally, you shouldn't be mentally dividing 表 into 土 and 衣 every time you see it, that's a waste of time.  

However, when you see 土俵, you need to be able to divide 俵 into 亻（にんべん） and 表（ひょう）。 

In this case, 亻（にんべん）donates meaning to the character, and 表（ひょう）donates a sound.  

There are a number of 'main' radicals that most kanji fall under, in a couple of specific shapes.  These are called [主な部首](http://kanza.qee.jp/LibraryHtm/busyu/busyumei.htm) in Japanese.  They should be in pretty much every good 国語教科書, and this is the list of radicals it's important to grasp-- they are the smallest units of Kanji comprehension that a native person deals with.  Typically, the 主な部首 provides the semantic content of the kanji, and the other half provides phonetic component.  Now, to a native English speaker, these are *both technically radicals*, but native Japanese people make mental distinctions between these two types of radicals automatically.  

By understanding what kind of radicals provide sounds and what kind of radicals provide semantic content, one can feasibly guess at the readings of even difficult kanji. For instance, 醤油, as pointed out in an earlier thread.  The phonetic component is 将, and the the semantic component is 酉, or 日読みの酉（ひよみのとり）.  To prove how versatile this system is, 奨 and 蒋 are also read しょう。

Now, the trick is, the phonetic component need not be a pure radical.  There are kanji like 徹 and 撤 (both read てつ) that have a very complex character as the phonetic component-- and to top it off, it's not a character that exists by itself in the wild.  But, if I asked you if you could read 轍, てつ is a very logical guess-- and you'd be right.  The meaning can be attached later, but once this kanji is mentally attached to 撤 and 徹, remembering the meaning of 轍 with the semantic component of 車is actually pretty easy.  

This isn't terribly different from the kind of storytelling that Heisig suggests doing.  However, this kind of 'storytelling' has the benefit of being *historically true*; often, this is exactly how the character was actually developed during Japanese's formative years.  Pretty much every kanji has a story to it, there's no real need to make up stories in search of a mnemonic device, they have them built in.

Awhile back, I was in a discussion in this reddit about people getting Skype people together to try and practice their Japanese.  I tried it out a bit and found it pretty lacking.  So I wanted to add this kind of functionality to Nihongo Master to make it easy for people to practice Japanese with other learners quickly.  So I added real-time text AND voice chat to the site.  Also, when you are in chat, you have immediate access to the  REST of the site without ever leaving.  This means you can quickly look up a Japanese word in the dictionary without ever leaving chat.  Or read more lessons or practice your drills.  

This is pretty fresh, so I wanted to reach out and see if anyone wanted to provide feedback on the experience and if it tends to actually be USEFUL for people to practice.  Actually putting the Japanese you learn into use is probably the most difficult part of studying the language (especially if you aren't in a classroom).

1351195528.0,48,self.LearnJapanese,1230t3,Japanese Immersion Class?,53,5,15,http://www.reddit.com/r/LearnJapanese/comments/1230t3/japanese_immersion_class/,"I have an idea for a University of Reddit Japanese class I'm hoping you'll like. I know that there is an Introductory Japanese Class currently open, and I think this class will supplement it and offer further learning resources to intermediate and advanced learners.

--Methodology--

I believe we can all agree that a huge chunk of fluency in a language is immersion. Being surrounded by a language helps you derive mental connections and emotions to words, rather than the easily breakable links you make from ""memorizing"" vocabulary from a textbook.

In my mind, there are two types of immersion: active and passive. Active means that you are expressing yourself or thoughts in the other language. Passive involves understanding nuances in the way the language is expressed.

When we were infants, we were gaining passive fluency as we listened to our families speak to us and each other. Once we were familiar with the language, we attempted to go active as we fumbled with words and proper pronunciation. We didn't fully become active until we had been passive enough to know what sounded right and what didn't. 

Immersion is the key. I feel that many traditional classes do not have the time to spare on immersion because 1) people wouldn't pay to be shown Youtube clips they can find on their own 2) it is nearly impossible to test knowledge on something as abstract as general understanding. 

This is where my University of Reddit class comes in.

--Class Setup--

The class will consist of daily 5 to 10-minute clips from shows, movies, songs, etc. that will include Japanese subtitles, furigana, and a community dictionary. Dual English subtitles will be optional with Japanese subtitles on bottom, and English ones on top.

The part I am most excited about is gathering suggestions from Students and TAs. This means we can all contribute to the collective immersion process and vote on what we'd like to see the next day or week. We could also choose weekly themes or cover certain subjects depending on community input.

There is an optional grading process we can do if you want to keep yourself engaged. After each clip there is the option to answer a 10-question fill in the blank quiz. We'll take random lines from the clip, and see if you can identify which word is missing. You'll also receive points for submitting clips for our consideration. We'll collect grades over 5-week periods and award you depending on your participation. At this point I am fuzzy on how to implement this so if anyone has any suggestions, please let me know.

TAs would be asked to help transcribe clips, review subtitles, or help answer Students' questions.

I will not teach in the traditional sense of explaining the grammar or vocabulary behind each sentence. Rather, I will help answer questions, be the main transcriber and subtitler, as well as improve class organization with your suggestions.

TL;DR Would you be interested in a University of Reddit Japanese class where you receive daily immersion from shows, movies, and songs? We will pick these clips from the suggestions the community upvotes the most.",,False,,t5_2qyls,False,,,True,t3_1230t3,http://www.reddit.com/r/LearnJapanese/comments/1230t3/japanese_immersion_class/,
1345762443.0,45,self.LearnJapanese,yq05o,List of good reading for intermediate level Japanese,54,9,12,http://www.reddit.com/r/LearnJapanese/comments/yq05o/list_of_good_reading_for_intermediate_level/,"When I hit the intermediate level, I was incredibly frustrated and felt like I hit a plateau.  Most textbooks were too boring and ""slow"" but real reading hit me like a brick wall.  There aren't a lot of resources on line for intermediate/low-advanced readers so I just started collecting a ton of books.  

We are packing things up at our place and I found my special stash of reading books.  I just wanted to share them here because this subreddit has been really useful for me.   

**Low intermediate** The goal here was to have short sentences with easily identifiable words (ie they refer to the pictures). I started with children's picture books, then Sailor Moon comic books, and then  worked my way through the easiest books written by famous authors.  

* Osamu Tezuka - Unico (children's illustrated book).  Got at the library's children section (international room) when they had a book sale.

* Manga

* Yoshimoto Banana - [Argentine Hag](http://www.amazon.com/Argentine-Hag-Banana-Yoshimoto/dp/4860520122/ref=sr_1_cc_1?s=aps&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1345761523&amp;sr=1-1-catcorr&amp;keywords=yoshimoto+banana+argentine).  This one is bilingual.

* [Murakami Haruki - Hitsuji Otoko no Christmas](http://www.amazon.com/Hitsuji-Otoko-Christmas-Japanese-Edition/dp/4061845764/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1345761675&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=hitsuji+otoko)

**Intermediate** I am comfortable reading paragraphs but I need to anchor myself in familiar stories.  So, I choose Japanese translations of famous Western children's books.  Harry Potter was way too hard so I aimed for books meant for younger kids.

* [Alice in Wonderland - in Japanese](http://www.amazon.com/Alices-Adventures-Wonderland-Fushigi-arisu/dp/4061860402/ref=sr_1_3?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1345761860&amp;sr=1-3&amp;keywords=fushigi+no+kuni)

* Winnie the Pooh - in Japanese (Sorry, can't find a link. I originally got it from Kinokuniya)

* [The Wizard of Oz - Japanese edition](http://www.amazon.com/Wonderful-Wizard-tsukai-Japanese-Edition/dp/4001141124/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1345761944&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=ozu+no+maho+tsukai)

**High Intermediate** At this point, I feel comfortable trying new stories.  I looked for ranobe/light novels or cell phone novels but a lot of them were too hard because they were fantasy based. So, I stuck with the easiest genre: melodramatic stories about sad teenage hookers! Yoshi was famous for his cell phone novels so I knew the sentences were going to be very short and digestible.  

* [Yoshi - Dear Friends](http://www.amazon.com/Dia-Furenzu-Dear-Friends-Japanese/dp/4062756021/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1345761615&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=yoshi+dear+friends) .  I read this and then saw the movie starring Keiko Kitagawa...and then reread it, all giddy.

* [Yoshi - Deep Love](http://www.amazon.com/Deep-Love-Story-Japanese-Language/dp/4883810089/ref=sr_1_2?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1345761779&amp;sr=1-2&amp;keywords=yoshi+deep+love) - There are 4 in this series.

**Low Advanced** So now I feel like I can handle paragraphs and new stories all together.  So, looked at famously ""easy"" books written by famous authors that MUST have English translations.  That way, I can always find the translation at the library and double check if I feel lost.  It also means I am not flipping through a dictionary trying to look stuff up word-by-word. Alternatively, I started collecting the bilingual collections of readers.

* [Banana Yoshimoto - Kitchen](http://www.amazon.com/Kitchen-Japanese-Banana-Yoshimoto/dp/4828822526/ref=sr_1_4?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1345761723&amp;sr=1-4&amp;keywords=yoshimoto+banana+kitchen+japanese)

* [Any of the ""Read Real Japanese"" books](http://www.amazon.com/Read-Real-Japanese-Fiction-Contemporary/dp/4770030584/ref=sr_1_2?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1345762348&amp;sr=1-2&amp;keywords=read+real+japanese) - also called [Reading Japanese With a Smile](http://www.amazon.com/Reading-Japanese-Smile-Magazine-Intermediate/dp/499028481X/ref=sr_1_3?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1345762348&amp;sr=1-3&amp;keywords=read+real+japanese)

This FAQ is broken down into ~~two~~ three parts (internal links to come with wiki...eventaully):

* New to Japanese
* New to /r/LearnJapanese
* EDIT: Resources/links (coming with the wiki version, proposed categories listed below)

---

**New to Japanese:**

1. **Q:** I'm totally new to Japanese; where should I start?
  
  **A:** Right here, in this very FAQ!  Just kidding; you should start by determining a study plan and choosing resources to go along with it, just like you would for learning any other language.  In fact, if there's one thing you take away from this entire FAQ, it should be that **learning Japanese is like learning any other foreign language, and requires hard work and persistence.**

2. **Q:** OK, so what's a good study plan, and what resources should I get to go with it?

  **A:** That all depends on you.  When you're creating a study plan, consider how much time you want to spend on learning Japanese every day, if there are real classes or study groups available to you, and what study methods you find effective.  Many people like [Anki](http://ankisrs.net/) for flashcards, and a lot of decks are available (or you can make your own).  [Genki](http://www.amazon.com/GENKI-Integrated-Elementary-Japanese-Edition/dp/4789014401/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1351911595&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=genki) is a highly-recommended textbook series.  (A more comprehensive list of resources will be included in the wiki version of this FAQ, whenever the wiki actually exists.)

3. **Q:** This sounds like...work.  Do I *really* need to do all of that?  Can't I just practice with anime/manga/video games?

  **A:** Yes, you do need to do all of that, and no, you cannot *just* practice with manga/anime/games.  They're completely valid reasons for wanting to learn Japanese, and they're a fun way to practice what you've learned, but they're not study materials.  If you want to learn Japanese, you will need to spend time focusing on studying.

  The US State Department lists Japanese as one of only five ""Superhard"" languages: the hardest foreign languages for native English speakers to learn ([PDF](http://fsitraining.state.gov/training/Language_Toolkit.pdf), check page 45).  Whatever your motivation for learning Japanese, attaining any kind of proficiency will take hard work and time.

4. **Q:** Holy crap there are a lot of kanji.  Do I need to learn them all before I can even start studying?

  Alternatively: When should I start learning kanji?

  **A:** This question always sparks lengthy debates, but the best general approach is to learn kanji in tandem with everything else.  There are various methods to choose from for practicing kanji, but you should try to learn kanji that go along with whatever vocabulary you're learning at the same time.  Most textbooks and study guides will follow this principle and introduce kanji that fit in with that chapter's theme, or similar.  You do **not** need to learn them all (or any of them) before starting.

  Also, you do *not* need to be able to write them perfectly.  Even if you live in Japan you'll almost never need to write by hand.

5. **Q:** But I went ahead and memorized 1200 kanji; how far along am I?

  **A:** If you learned *only* kanji, you're still at the starting line.  As tempting as it is to view kanji as a measure of your progress, they're only useful when you know the vocabulary and grammar to go along with them, and take the time to practice using them in context.

6. **Q:** How do I type in Japanese like all the cool kids?

  **A:** It depends on your operating system, but [this](http://lmgtfy.com/?q=how+to+type+in+Japanese#) should get you started.  Also, a lot of people are fans of the [Google IME](http://www.google.com/ime/).

7. **Q:** What's this JLPT I keep hearing about?  Should I take it?

  **A:** The [Japanese Language Proficiency Test](http://www.jlpt.jp/e/) is an annual (or bi-annual, in some countries) standardized Japanese test.  Whether you want to take it is up to you, but many people feel that it's not an accurate representation of proficiency, as it lacks speaking and writing components, and it's pretty easy to do well on the test just by studying the JLPT itself instead of actually learning Japanese.  Despite what you might hear, N1 (the highest level) is not strictly necessary to get a job in Japan; whether or not an employer will want it depends on your industry and the individual company.  That said, there's no harm in taking it if you feel like it.

---

**New to /r/LearnJapanese:**

1. **Q:** What sort of things can I ask here?

  **A:** You can ask anything related to learning Japanese.  Specific questions, general conversation, and anecdotes are all fine if they encourage people to learn.  Remember that even if a post is not a specific question with a single, correct answer, people come here for a chance to talk to other Japanese learners, so anything which people find helpful is generally allowed.

  Memes/image macros will be allowed if they actively help people practice or learn, but my personal standard for that is *extremely* strict, so you probably shouldn't bother.  And no, ""people were discussing Japanese in the comments, so it totally counts"" is not a valid argument, no matter how funny you think your meme is.

2. **Q:** Can I ask for help with my homework?

  **A:** Did you ask your teacher first?

  If you're having trouble understanding a concept and want to hear some different explanations, that's completely fine.  If you want reddit to make sure you get 100% on all of your assignments before you turn them in, that's less fine.  

  You should also check your school's/class's Academic Honesty policy before asking for help.  You *really* don't want to be the next kid whose professor is also on reddit and caught them cheating.

3. **Q:** How can I be sure I'm getting an accurate answer?

  **A:** You can't.  This is /r/LearnJapanese, not /r/TeachJapanese.  There are plenty of knowledgeable and helpful people here, but you should take the time to read as many answers as possible, and check out any resources people provide.

4. **Q:** Are translation requests accepted?  I'm not really interested in learning Japanese, but I have this cursed katana I inherited from my grandfather, and I can't understand the writing engraved on the blade.

  **A:** You can post a translation request, but you'll probably have better luck in /r/translator.  People here might help out if they want to, but private translation requests usually aren't helpful study material, so a lot of people will ignore them.

I made a video today describing the method I use to memorize Korean vocabulary, but it can be applied to Japanese as well (or any language). I've used this method for a long time, for several different languages, and it's worked great. With a few sheets of paper and 30-45 minutes, you can learn at least 50 new vocabulary words per day. Once you get used to the system, it's expandable safely up to 100 (but don't try that much unless you need to).

Here's the **[link to the video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n5A71i4EZ_w)**.

In the video I use a separate piece of paper for each one, but normally I'd just use both sides of the same paper to save money since I did this a lot.

1374683049.0,44,self.LearnJapanese,1iypky,[META] Tips on teaching languages (and learning them too!),51,7,6,http://www.reddit.com/r/LearnJapanese/comments/1iypky/meta_tips_on_teaching_languages_and_learning_them/,"This topic tends to come up in comment discussions a bit, so I thought I would round up a few tips, and solicit advice from everyone else, too.

Full disclosure: I am not a professional educator.  I've taught Hebrew at Hebrew schools, and Japanese as an extra-curricular activity in college, plus assorted math/physics.  I'm certainly not an expert on languages or education.  The purpose of this post is to get people to talk about how they teach and how they learn, and to see if we can figure out some guidelines to help everyone out.

---

Tips for teaching:

* **Consider the level of the OP when answering.**  If the OP is asking a basic grammar question, be kind and use the [furigana feature](http://www.reddit.com/r/LearnJapanese/comments/16sr7c/feature_furigana/).  If it's a high-level question, don't be an ass and explain that katakana is for loanwords.
* **Don't lose sight of the original question.**  Side-conversations in the comments are fine, and are usually fun and informative.  But be careful to make sure that the OP actually got a good answer before going off on tangents (or at least be clear that it's a tangent).
* **You are here to help, not to show off.**  This is honestly a bit of a problem here, and ties back into the first point.  Please try not to info-dump.  Answering a question well is not the same as answering a question in an absurd amount of detail.  A basic question does not need a complicated answer which includes every possible exception to a rule, or subtle regional differences, or anything like that.
* **The most important thing is that the OP understands the answer**.  No explanation needed.

----

Tips for learning:

* **Ask good questions**.  Provide context, or examples.  Be detailed instead of vague.  The better your question, the better your answer.
* **Don't be afraid to try on your own**.  Include your own guess, or your attempt at a translation.  It's easier to correct someone's mistakes than to explain an entire concept from scratch.
* **Sometimes it's better to leave a question for later**.  It sucks, but sometimes ""just memorize that part for now"" or ""that's kinda just how it is"" will be the best answer you're going to get.  It may make sense later, or it may be some weird quirk of Japanese, but ""don't worry about it for now"" is often good advice.

----

So if anyone has any suggestions, tips, questions, or complaints, please post them.  The more we talk about it, the more we can improve the quality of the sub ^(and the more stuff I'll have to read while my code compiles).

Every step I learned I thought I was on the brink of complete fluency. Its so laughable to me now, after 5 years that I thought I was anywhere close. I feel like every step I take, more steps appear. Its hard work, but it has definitely taught me how to love the language for what it is, and love the hard work that got me to where I am now. I am still not even close to fluency, but I sure do love studying everyday!

My advice to all the beginners: Japanese is hard. No really, its the hardest fucking thing you have ever done. Seriously, its way harder than you ever have planned. If you only want to learn Japanese for that cool manga you love--that kind of motivation wont get you past 101. You have to know that you will be putting hard work everyday into something that becomes so much harder as it goes on. You CAN learn Japanese. Not in a week or a month or even a year, but you can learn it. Find a reason to love the language and learning, because even how hard it has been, its the most rewarding pursuit I have ever had the pleasure in engaging in. GOOD LUCK!

TL;DR This is just a stupid rant. Japanese is hard. Don't give up.

I'm stocking shelves with my co-worker when from behind me I hear someone say something like ""a-su-ki wa doko e?"". Imagine saying that sentence with a huge American English accent, that's how it sounded.


His accent was really bad and I didn't really know what he was saying at first, so I defaulted to english and said ""excuse me?"" at which point the guy loudly exclaims to his friends ""Wow someone here doesn't know Japanese!"" 
I said ""uh no its just I didn't quite hear you"" trying to be polite. He then repeats ""a-zu-ki wa doko e?"" so this time I responded with ""小豆ですか こちらにあります。” quite quickly. He just looked at me and then kinda walked away. Just for reference I've been studying for about 3 1/2 years and I would say my abilities are ""basic conversationally fluent"".


So my question is, was I wrong say what I said fast enough so that he wouldn't understand? Should I have tried to use Japanese at the start even though I had no Idea what he was trying to say? I feel like he was a dick by walking up to me from behind and using poor Japanese and insulting me afterward.

I recently released a flashcard program for Japanese called Let's Learn Japanese: Deluxe. The purpose of this program is to make it easy for those wanting to learn or already studying to have a simple and effective way to study and memorize characters.

Let's Learn Japanese; Deluxe
http://gzstorm.com/lets-learn-japanese-deluxe/

If you've used programs like Anki or Mnemosyne before, you've probably been able to download user decks for Japanese, but the difference between this program and a standard flashcard program is that LLJ:D has more features relating specifically to the Japanese language.

For instance, Hiragana, Katakana, Grade 1-S Kanji, and 1700 common words are included with the program, no additional download required. Every section is broken up into categories for easier learning. Every character and word also has animated stroke order, words can be broken down by Kanji ( http://gzstorm.com/screen/LLJD_Kanji0.png ), there is a quiz mode to test retention, a review mode for all information included, and spoken pronunciation for all words and Hiragana / Katakana.

The program costs $1 to buy, but there is a free demo version which you can obtain that will give you access to Hiragana, Katakana, Grade 1-3 Kanji, and 250 words. This program is also available on your XBOX 360 as well as PC.

I realize that this is my first post and it's talking about a program I made, but a lot of people who start up learning use programs like Anki or Mnemosyne, which are good all around flashcard programs, but are not tailored for the Japanese language and require set-up on the users part. This is an all inclusive program, and I feel a lot of people could benefit from using even the demo version as it contains the most vital and basic information needed to get started.

If you have any questions or comments about the program, I'd like to hear them! This is actually the second version of this program and I would like to release additional versions with even more improvements.",,False,,t5_2qyls,False,,,True,t3_1ccjua,http://www.reddit.com/r/LearnJapanese/comments/1ccjua/lets_learn_japanese_deluxe_new_japanese_flashcard/,

She blogs mostly about the odd fumbles we experience, language and culture-wise in our daily life. It's often hilarious.

The comment started with 「お主やるなー。」which to me means, ""You did a good job!"", but my wife is a little irked at someone who doesn't know her using お主, as (she says) it's on par with お前 for talking down to someone, and that it's super archaic, Edo Period style speaking... but she was raised in a really strict home where words like お前、おめぇー、俺、etc. were frowned upon (despite the fact that her family is trash). 

The commenter continues...

「やったね(笑）そのユーモア精神大好きですだよ！それで、旦那くんが元気になるように心より祈ってます。」

Her comment on this line is that 「大好きですだよ」is really odd Japanese.

The comment was gushing and positive, and not offensive in any way except for the お主 part. So, I came up with 2 theories. 

1. It's a dialect she's not familiar with, and that in *that* part of the country, people talk like *that* and she should just mellow out.

2. It's a foreigner making awkward mistakes in Japanese, as we all do. 

Either way I told her to be forgiving to the person as they were being nice, but she couldn't make sense of the oddness of address and ""daisuki desu da yo"". 

Any ideas?

http://www.reddit.com/r/LearnJapanese/comments/1at62c/inferring_readings_of_individual_kanji/

I used the information to finish my project of quantitatively analyzing the kanji readings in my sentence deck, which is based on the Core10k collection of example sentences for vocabulary. That collection is intended to give a simple example of usage of individual vocabulary words, so the sentences tend to be short and over-use personal pronouns. Those factors will affect the statistics. There is more about this below.

Each sentence has a kana transcription and an audio recording against which the transcription may be compared in cases where the kana seem incorrect. Many errors in the transcriptions were identified and corrected during this project. But it is likely that some errors remain, and since the kana transcriptions are the basis for inferring kanji readings, these errors will affect the statistics also.

Here are the basic numbers:

    9799   total sentences
    1974   distinct kanji
    45858  total kanji readings
    3758   distinct kanji readings

It is interesting that the average number of distinct readings per kanji is less than 2. I originally started this project because I wanted to make some flash cards to isolate distinct readings of each kanji. I keep getting frustrated when I have to fail a sentence card because it contains an unfamiliar reading of a kanji I have already seen a bunch of times. Also, many kanji have only one reading, and only a few have many readings, and it's easy to get caught up in the ones which have many. It's one of those cases where you remember the hard cases more than the easy ones, so you get a skewed sense for how many distinct readings there really are.

Here is a summary of the distribution of unique readings for kanji. In other words, the first line says there are 956 kanji with just one distinct reading used in the sentences.

    Readings       Number of Kanji
    1                 956
    2                 570
    3                 270
    4                 108
    5                 43
    6                 15

    8                 3
    9                 3
    11                1
    18                1

These are the reading types recorded:

    on -- an on reading listed in Kanjidic2
    kun -- a kun reading listed in Kanjidic2
    nanori -- a nanori reading in Kanjidic2 not already listed as on or kun
    rendaku -- a vocalized version of one of the Kanjidic readings (e.g. か -&gt; が)
    elision -- a shortened version of one of the Kanjidic readings (e.g. カク -&gt; カッ when in front of キ)
    jukujikun -- a kanji compound whose reading is assigned to the word as a whole rather than the individual kanji

I added 36 variant kun readings to the Kanjidic data to cover cases that seemed like relatively obvious variants on existing readings. Many of these cases involve variants on okurigana usage.

The statistics for nanori, rendaku, and elision are a bit tricky, because some kanji have rendaku-ized and shortened readings already listed as readings, and some don't. If a kanji already has a rendaku-ized reading listed as an on reading, kun reading, or nanori reading, it isn't counted as rendaku, and similarly for elision. If a kanji uses a nanori reading, the reading is counted as nanori even if the word isn't a name. So nanori just indicates that the reading wasn't listed as an on reading or kun reading in Kanjidic, but it was listed as a nanori reading.

Also, I'm not sure ""elision"" is the right word for what I'm talking about here, which is a euphonic transformation in which repeated consonants are replaced with pauses, or a final ん is dropped before the next syllable. I hope the example above makes clear what I'm talking about. If someone knows the correct name for this, I would be interested to know.

Finally, I had to use my own judgement to tell what readings were jukujikun, and what were just variants on existing readings. I didn't have time to exhaustively research each case, and besides that it isn't totally clear what would count as an authority to settle the question definitively.

Here is a summary of the reading types. Overall on readings are the most common, but kun readings are used on the same order of magnitude. Everything else is somewhat rare in comparison.

    Type       Distinct  Total
    on         1760      25062
    kun        1503      17870
    jukujikun  134       970
    rendaku    213       964
    elision    87        550
    nanori     61        442

In addition to the summary statistics, I took a look at the frequency distribution for distinct readings of common kanji. The below 3 kanji have the highest number of distinct readings. Many people think of 生 as the kanji with the most readings, but when you also count jukujikun, actually 日 has more, at least for this set of sentences.

    Kanji  Type       Reading  Occurrences
    日     jukujikun  キョウ     162
    日     on         ニチ      93

Note that ニッ is listed as nanori, even though it probably could also be considered elision of ニチ. The rendaku reading ピ comes from the word 年月日. I think you could make the case that 日向 (ヒナタ) isn't jukujikun, because ナ and タ are listed separately in Kanjidic2 as nanori for 向, even though the combination ナタ isn't.

Note that ジョウ is listed as a nanori reading, even though the corresponding usages (誕生日, 誕生, 大往生) are all fairly clearly rendaku. The rendaku reading バ is from the verb 芽生える. Also note the huge difference in frequency between the most common reading and the second most common.

The real problem with Kanji isn't the number of characters there are (an average 太郎 can get by with about 2000), but the number of compounds (in the tens of thousands).  In order to approach a Japanese native's level of proficiency, you have to not work just on memorization but also on the *accessibility of compounds*.  That is, you have to understand how compounds are related in context, and form a concept map that includes how compounds are related to each other.  Without this, you will always be at a loss for words, even if you can read or write the characters if asked to.

The activity I am about to propose is something that Japanese schoolkids actually do in *their own classrooms* to improve compound accessibility.  It is an adaptation of shiritori, a Japanese schoolgame based on taking the last character of a word and using it to form a new word.

For instance, a normal game of shiritori might progress like this:

りんご⇒ゴリラ⇒ラッキー⇒きのこ⇒こぶた etc.

One might make the game more complicated by limiting the game to a particular class of objects, or places, or whatever.  

In the Kanji version, a game might progress like this:

青春⇒春季⇒季節⇒節電⇒電車⇒ etc.  

Using this game, one can connect the meanings of kanji with a greater degree of abstraction, and begin to get away from seeing the kanji as symbolic representations of objects, and furthermore, begin to associate compounds with each other, an extremely valuable resource when trying to explain something in simpler terms (something you will undoubtedly have to do if trying to express something outside of your comfort zone).

Please post comments on this game directly to the OP, please respond to the game on whoever happens to have a post with just the two characters.

(bonus points if you come up with an unusual or interesting compound!)

Also, as there are a lot of beginner Japanese learners here, please keep it to the [教育漢字](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ky%C5%8Diku_kanji) list.  

I'll start.  

文化

edit:

I forgot to mention, as in shiritori, you can't use the same compound twice.  (you can use the same kanji twice, however).",,False,,t5_2qyls,True,,,True,t3_mzxce,http://www.reddit.com/r/LearnJapanese/comments/mzxce/fun_with_japanese/,

So, I've been stupidly interested in Japan since I was young and now I'm at university with a little more* ""me-time""* I've decided to learn Japanese to complete the circle and really show the respect I have for the country. During this process, I've stumbled upon a question...

I'm a marijuana smoker myself. I know that the Japanese are known to absolute** DETEST** anyone that uses even the lower-grade drugs like marijuana. Being caught with a minuscule amount can get you 10 years, I believe.

Onto my question, I was wondering just out of pure curiosity what the language was like in the drug ""scene"" over there. So I know here, in the UK and also the US, we use a lot of colloquial language to communicate with each other.

But when thinking about it, I'm not sure if there would be such language developments. I believe the reason drug slang even started was to hide your intentions from people around you potentially eavesdropping. However, in Japan, seeing as it's widely and aggressively unaccepted, would they have even developed different terms?

&gt;As an example to show how the colloquial language can throw off eavesdroppers: In English speaking countries, at some point ""You got an eighth of Mary Jane?"" would have meant nothing to a room full of people, bar the person that you are trying to communicate with.",,False,,t5_2qyls,False,,,True,t3_16zn47,http://www.reddit.com/r/LearnJapanese/comments/16zn47/the_japanese_and_drugs/,

ShitsuMonday is back for another helping of small questions you want to ask regarding Japanese that don't require an entire submission.

These questions can be anything you want as long as it abides by the subreddit rules, so ask away.

Even if you don't have any questions to ask, maybe see if you can answer any of the simpler questions!

Any skill level is welcome, from ""I can't even read kana yet"" to native speakers. We have a couple people who have been studying for years and are pretty good by now, so even if the only thing you can do is ask questions, feel free to drop on by.

Despite being relatively quiet for long periods of time, there are usually at least a couple people at their computers, and if you say hi or ask a question things should pick up fairly quickly.

For those who don't know, IRC is basically a chat room protocol where you can talk to multiple people at once in text. You can access the channel through an IRC client of your choice (google for one) or use freenode's [web client](http://webchat.freenode.net/) from your browser. Put in a nickname and #reddit-japanese in the channel form (the # is required), fill out the captcha, connect, and you're there.

TL;DR: Join #reddit-japanese on freenode and talk to other redditors in or about Japanese!

But, at the bottom of each Kanji's page is a link that directs you to a collection of example sentences that use that specific kanji. While most of these sentences are straightforward usages of the kanji (usually the short ones), there are other sentences that are completely off the fucking-wall-weird (and yet always surprisingly polite) or strangely poetic (in a Japanese-y way).

For example:

In the entry for the 愛, the Kanji for ""love"" (pronounced ""ai""), there is a sentence that reads:

ジェーンは太ってるし、態度も悪いし、煙草もぷかぷか吸うし。でも、ケンは彼女のことを可愛くてチャーミングだと思ってるんだな。『あばたもえくぼ（恋は盲目）』っていうけど、まさにそれだな。 

The site translator provides this for the translation:

""Jane is fat, rude, and smokes too much. But Ken thinks she's lovely and charming. That's why they say love is blind.""

For 火, the kanji for fire (""ka""), one reads:

火災で全てのコンピューターディスクが駄目になってしまった時、会社はもうお手上げの状況だった。

Or in English:

""The company was really up shit creek when a fire destroyed all their computer discs.""

Here are the pages for 

[愛](http://sp.cis.iwate-u.ac.jp/icampus/u/sntncs.jsp?w=%E6%84%9B)

[火](http://sp.cis.iwate-u.ac.jp/icampus/u/sntncs.jsp?w=%E7%81%AB)

1267949200.0,33,self.LearnJapanese,ba8ua,Online Resources for Learning Japanese,39,6,9,http://www.reddit.com/r/LearnJapanese/comments/ba8ua/online_resources_for_learning_japanese/,"Seeing this subreddit as a *LearnJapanese*, I decided to compile a group of links on learning Japanese.

*****
### Immersion:

- [All Japanese All The Time](http://www.alljapaneseallthetime.com/blog/about), A very good read on how to learn your Japanese. He has lots of posts and very motivational ones too. A must read.

- [LiveMocha](http://www.livemocha.com/) is an online language learning tool, which is *very similar* in a way to [Rosetta Stone](http://www.rosettastone.com/) (minus the better visuals and cosmetics). I would personally *not* recommend Rosetta Stone, not because of a bad software, but for ineffectiveness and inefficiency. It has good vocabulary and presentation, but I see it as a very slow learning tool, and not forgetting the *pricey price*. There are some people who've had wonders with Rosetta Stone, so it all comes back to personal preference.

- [YouTube](http://www.youtube.com/), Who doesn't know YouTube? Well this site is also very useful to immerse yourself in Japanese, whether it's a News Broadcast, PV (Promotional Video) or a TV Show, it is a great fun way to learn and play.

- [iTunes](http://www.apple.com/itunes/download/) is a very nice source for Japanese Podcasts which you can listen to anytime and anywhere. There are both free and commercial podcasts, so you can choose which ones are suitable for you. Just don't forget to change your iTunes country to Japan to get access to all the podcasts.

- [JapanesePod101](http://www.japanesepod101.com/) is a website on Japanese podcasts, which are designed to help learn Japanese. There are paid programs and content, but there are also free lifetime material, so nothing to lose here.
*****
### Vocabulary/SRS:

- [Smart.fm](http://smart.fm/home), surely one of the best SRS sites out there. It has very nice flashcards and vocabulary, complete with audio and a good community.

- [Anki](http://ichi2.net/anki/) is similar to Smart.fm in a way (except it isn't web-based), as they're both SRS softwares, and some prefer Anki to Smart.fm. They're basically the same though, so it's all a matter of preference. *[A good read on the comparison between Anki &amp; Smart.fm](http://yonasu.com/anki-vs-smartfm/)*
*****
### Live Video Learning:

- [EduFire](http://edufire.com/) is what comes to my mind for learning online with a teacher. There are free courses, and cheap ones to get you started, and it has good listings for Japanese. Check this one out if you're looking for an online class.
*****
###Grammar:

- [TextFugu](http://www.textfugu.com/) is an Online Japanese Textbook which is a choice for those going for self teaching themselves. I personally use this, and so far I'm satisfied with all the aspects from playfulness, presentation and content. The only part I'm rather uninterested with is the *Kanji* section. I prefer *Heisig's Method* for this which will have its own Kanji section below.

- [Tae Kim's Guide to Learning Japanese](http://www.guidetojapanese.org/learn/grammar) - Informative and straightforward from beginner to anywhere advanced, and all of it is free (which everyone loves).

- [JGram](http://jgram.org/) is another Japanese Grammar site. I've never used this one before, but I've heard good things about it (and bad ones too), but either way it's still a good resource to point out.
*****
###Kana:

- [RealKana](http://www.realkana.com/), a good Hiragana/Katakana practice game which is also available on the iPhone/iTouch.
*****
###Kanji:

- [Remembering The Kanji](http://kanji.koohii.com/) is a method created by James Heisig. In the first book, he presents a method of learning how to associate the meaning of 2042 different kanji. The different thing about his method, is that *there is no attention given to the readings of the Kanji*, which he believes should be separated and learnt in Volume II. If this works for you, then use it. If it doesn't, there are other alternatives. All comes back to preference.

- [Kanji Damage](http://www.hellodamage.com/top/kanjidamage/), I gave a quick read on this one and it's quite interesting in a way. It also seems like it teaches in a casual way, but it has some useful points so a good read nevertheless.

- [Read The Kanji](http://www.readthekanji.com/), quoted from rhedwolf: `""Probably the best online stat/ability tracking kanji game, and also really good for learning vocabulary. You have to buy an account for the site now, but it is awesome. There is a free trial that includes JLPT level 4, and I think hiragana and katakana.""` I've only opened this site once, but it has a nice presentation, hopefully has great content too.
*****
###Miscellaneous:

- [Zonjineko](http://www.zonjineko.com/), I've seen Zonjineko in this subreddit a couple of times (also on other sites), so just a shoutout to the site!

- [Tofugu](http://www.tofugu.com/), a blog related to TextFugu, it revolves everything about Japanese Language and Culture. So check it out.  

- [SpaceAlc](http://www.alc.co.jp/), quoted from rhedwolf, `""Extremely useful site for looking up words or phrases in either Japanese or English. It has an incredible number of sample sentences that are in both English and Japanese so you can find the proper usage of any terms you are interested in.""` I haven't read through this one, but it seems useful for intermediate learners.

If you have any other resources, post it here and I'll update the post for others to indulge in.

But I thought it might be good to start a regular feature where I (or someone else) share an interesting kotowaza (Japanese proverb) and include an explanation of its meaning and history. Or maybe just have a day where everyone shows off their linguistic knowledge. Who knows how this will end up?

Which brings us to this week's kotowaza: 風が吹けば桶屋が儲かる。(When the wind blows, the coopers profit.) This saying refers to how any event can lead to bizarre, unexpected results.

The seven step explanation is this:

* The wind blows dirt and dust into the air.
* The dust gets into people's eyes, and causes some of them to go blind.
* The increase in blind people leads to an increase in demand for shamisen (Playing shamisen was a traditional job of the blind) 
* The increase in shamisen demand leads to more cats being killed. (Cat skin was once used in the making of shamisen.)
* The decrease in the cat population leads to an increase in rats.
* The rats chew on the wooden barrels.
* This leads to increased demand for new barrels and the coopers profit.

**冬の使者の訪れ**

木枯らし（こがらし）

秋の終わりから、冬の初めにかけて吹く強い風のことで、木を枯らしてしまう風という意味です。

また、「木嵐（こあらし）」が語源だという説もあります。

「嵐」の語源は「荒し」。「し」は風を意味する古語ですから、荒い風という意味です。でも、中国では「嵐」という漢字は、山にただよう気配のことで、荒々しい風という意味はないそうです。

「凩（こがらし）」という漢字もありますが、これは、日本で考え出された漢字、つまり国字です。

風に関する国字は、他にも颪（おろし）、凪（なぎ）、凧（たこ）などがあります。

I was really surprised that I was able to understand about 90% of the dialog.  I think this was due to the fact that 6(ish) year old main character uses basic vocabulary and everyone who talks to him obviously doesn't use big words.

I once found it by chance in a bookstore and have been very happy with it ever since. I think it's the perfect companion to some good dictionaries and the often mentioned Dictionaries of Japanese Grammar (published by Japan Times).

The book specializes in collocations ([連後](/fg ""れんご"")), unique noun-verb (or noun-adjective) combinations that make sense, but cannot be guessed easily. Think シャワーを[浴](/fg ""あ"")びる for ""to take a shower"", but also more abstract things such as [神経](/fg ""しんけい"")を[使](/fg ""つか"")う, ""to worry about"".

I myself am especially happy with the complete example sentences that accompany about a third of the collocations. These always come with interesting conjunctions, new vocabulary or speech patterns I wouldn't be able to guess. For example:


[何軒](/fg ""なんけん"")かの[店](/fg ""みせ"")を[回](/fg ""まわ"")ったが、どこもその[商品](/fg ""しょうひん"")を[扱](/fg ""あつか"")っていなかった。
I went to several stores, but none of them had that item.

This sentence is about the collocation [商品](/fg ""しょうひん"")を[扱](/fg ""あつか"")う (""to deal in products""), but at the same time I've learned the counter for stores and a new usage of [回](/fg ""まわ"")る.

[Amazon.com](http://www.amazon.com/Common-Japanese-Collocations-Learners-Frequent/dp/4770031238) has the Look Inside! feature for this book, so it can give you an idea of how the book works and how the chapters are divided.

First of all, I want to thank you all for the wonderful response from when 
I posted the video before, I received a ton of e-mails all saying nice 
things and it was fantastic.  You all motivated me to study basically non 
stop for the past 2 weeks.

I just got done [sending out](http://flic.kr/p/bnHCHA) 49 mosaics for everyone who has asked over the 
past 12 days.  ([First six pictures in this set](http://www.flickr.com/photos/tommythecorc/sets/72157629066712362/)) For those of you keeping track at home, that 
means I wrote 13,200 kanji in 12 days, by far my best 12 day stretch of 
studying ever.  Before making the video, on my best day ever from the past 
year, I only made 4 mosaics in one day, but thanks to the response I got, I 
busted out 12 straight best-study days.  And that included an 宴会 and 
subsequent 二日酔い, so I could have had this done in 11 days, but alas, you 
can't ever pass up an opportunity to go to an 宴会.

Second of all, I had thought all these requests would take me about 2 
months to complete so I posted on the video description that I wouldn't be 
taking any more requests, but since it went much much faster than 
anticipated, my offer is still open to anyone who wants me to make you one 
of these kanji mosaics.  If you watched it before and thought to yourself 
""I don't want to bother this guy.""  Don't worry!  This has nothing to do 
with taking time, it is the exact opposite, I have tons of time right now 
and all I need is motivation.

However, I think I am going to limit the number of people to 50 so you 
don't have to wait too long.  Plus after about 50 e-mails my inbox becomes 
a little cluttered and it gets slightly overwhelming.  I am guessing if I 
get 50 requests, I should be able to send them out to everyone within about 
a month or so.

Obviously if I get the same response as last time, I'll be able to make a 
mosaic for everyone who wants one.  And if more than 50 people want one, 
then I will post again probably in early April or whenever I finish the 
second batch.  

Please don't hesitate to ask, it really helps give me the motivation I 
need.  I'm shooting for the JLPT level 2 in July and I still have a long 
ways to go, but if I keep studying like I have the past two weeks, I'm 
confident that I'll pass.

**tl;dr** If you want your name written in 330 Kanji, just get my e-mail from the [video](http://vimeo.com/37198862)
description.  I can't really organize my reddit inbox very well so please send me an e-mail instead of a reddit message.

ps.  First 10 people to e-mail me with a request get a [Big Thunder chocolate bar](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Thunder_%28chocolate_bar%29#Big_Thunder) included in the envelope.  So even though when you 
get the mosaic and are disappointed in my terrible handwriting, you can at 
least enjoy some delicious Japanese chocolate.  This offer is only valid 
for people outside of Japan, those of you living in Japan, go to the 
nearest conbini.

pps. Don't be a jerk if you e-mail me.  If you just say ""WRITE ME 1 OMG 
THX"" and aren't polite then I'm writing yours left handed.

***EDIT*** I got back from work today and have 52 requests, thank you all so much for giving me motivation!  If someone is reading this and wants one, I'll kindly ask you to wait until early or mid April and I'll make another post.",,False,,t5_2qyls,True,,,True,t3_qigct,http://www.reddit.com/r/LearnJapanese/comments/qigct/100000_kanji_update/,

I'll post a situation every week, giving you the social context and leaving the actual dialog up to you. Your job is to write a reply in Japanese in the *appropriate* register.

==========================================

**What's register?**

Register is a fancy word for ""formality"" or ""politeness.""

==========================================

**Why bother?**

Foreigners usually suck at speaking/writing in the proper register for various reasons and excuses. I'm especially bad at it.

A lot of Japanese people let it slide because ""oh, he's foreign and doesn't know better.""

So this is a good chance to practice and learn.

==========================================

**Challenge #1**

You are waiting at a bus stop. An older gentleman (you guess him to be around 70-80) in a suit comes up and asks you when the next bus comes. You tell him that the next bus comes in seven minutes.

Edit: I thought I'd make the first challenge simple but see that it was too simple. So here's a bonus question!

What's yours?,33,6,21,http://www.reddit.com/r/LearnJapanese/comments/x3q0t/here_is_my_immersionstudy_schedule_whats_yours/,"First of all, let me preface with this:  For me, immersion is very hard.  I have a full time job involving regular discussion, meetings, and otherwise collaborating in English.  I absolutely can not and will not be able to fully let go of English due to my situation.  I also like to stay fit, but this is no excuse for leaving Japanese behind.

A smart phone or any kind of MP3 player is your best friend.  Podcasts, podcasts, podcasts!  JapanesePod101.com for straight learning, or random comedy/talk shows - some of my favorites are 爆笑問題, Singer Song Gamer, and タコラジ！.  Sure, I can't understand 70% of it, but I pick up new things every day and it helps reaffirm vocabulary.


Here is a pretty typical day for me:

* Morning: Study grammar points from a book for about 20-30 minutes over breakfast
* At work: Any time I am not in a meeting, I am listening to Japanese language/learning podcasts. Also, spend some time reading the daily [NHK Easy News](http://www3.nhk.or.jp/news/easy/).
* Right after work: Run errands or whatever I need to do - listen to Japanese music in the car
* Back at home: Round one of Anki - only reviews
* At the gym/park: Once again, on the iPhone listening to podcasts
* Back home: Round two of Anki - learning new stuff
* Bed time: Podcasts again while I fall asleep

I think this works pretty well.  The point is, you can have a busy schedule and still immerse yourself!  Don't be lazy!

And by lazy, I mean spending too much time reading English posts on Reddit - like me! :(  I could probably squeeze in some more immersion if not for Reddit, but I really enjoy reading over /r/LearnJapanese.

1352935971.0,27,self.LearnJapanese,137ivj,Common phrases while visiting Japan... beyond the usual lists.,35,8,33,http://www.reddit.com/r/LearnJapanese/comments/137ivj/common_phrases_while_visiting_japan_beyond_the/,"Hi there! My husband and I recently visited Japan for the first time. I have studied Japanese off and on since high school, and really caught up on it before going. I know there are tons of ""common phrases"" ""all you'll need"" lists for tourists, but I found them incredibly incomplete and I was really lacking in simple situations. Now, if I was discussing travel I was spot on- buying tickets, asking about platforms, etc. But what these lists and guides seem to really leave out is common phrases you hear in restaurants and shops, and how to respond to them. Looking up words like ""plastic bag"" helps, but not too much if I don't know the general phrase, as I'm guessing these sort of phrases, like in English, are fairly set in stone. So, is there any site or book you'd recommend for this, or would anyone mind giving some phrases I know I was missing? We're hoping to go again in the near future and I'd love to be more fluent in areas like this.


Here's what I know I needed to understand better-
• I had learned a phrase for ""Are you ready to order?"" but only heard it a select few times, though I know we were asked every time we ate out. What is most commonly used for this situation?

• When ordering, the question always arises of ""One or two"" when with another person. Is it always ひとつ and ふたつ counters used for food items, or are some things not included in it? I know the はい／ばい／ぱい counter is for drinks.

• When given your food, do you say ""いただきます"" to the waiter, or just say a normal version of thank you? At the end of the meal, do you say ”ごちそうさま"" to anyone at the restaurant helping you/checking you out? I only know of these phrases being used in more personal settings/to those you are eating with and wasn't sure if it's used beyond that.

• どうも actually seemed rare on it's own- why is ありがとう so much more prevalent? Is it actually a bit rude to say どうも only in a more formal setting as it's not as thankful? Is it normal to say どうもありがとうございました at the end of a transaction or is this overly polite as the customer?

• The first time I used the word I learned for bill or check, I was told ""チェック"". Was this a correction to what is more commonly used in Japan, or was the lady just making sure she understood me correctly?

• ""Do you want a plastic bag?"" What is said in this case, and is ""けっこです。"" an appropriate answer? Is it also okay to say you don't want your items bagged when not asked, or is this rude as the Japanese seem to put a lot of pride into their item wrapping?

• I used 大丈夫 very often and was not sure if it really is the exact equivalent to ""OK"" and ""that's alright"" in English. Let's say someone is pushing you to buy more items in their shop- is ""大丈夫"" an appropriate answer or is ""けっこです。"" the more sensible choice? If someone is being overly polite and apologizing when there is no need, does ""大丈夫"" work there?


I was wondering also if there are any good source for learning common food dishes/kanji? I'm pretty lacking in kanji but this would be an area I'd love to focus on since I'm really into Japanese food back home, too.

He wrote all the stories behind the Yakuza (竜がごとく)PS games and, IMHO, writes far more intresting stories than most of the other more ""popular"" authors. Most of the themes are cops, drugs, gangs, violence. You know, the spice of life! His writing style is fairly straight forward, with flowery descriptions but nothing rediculous, and VERY realistic dialogue which should help my fellow learners get a greater feel for how slang in Japanese works. The novels I have are: ダークマーン [darkman] and 不夜城 [sleepless town] or I have 闇のよぶ声 by 遠藤周作 and 陸中海岸殺意の族 by 西村京太郎 all pretty much dealing with mayhem and are not the typical ""I, novels."" (no disrespect, but I find the monotony of japanese life makes the most uninteresting stories imaginable.) I also have 吉本ばななs TSUGUMI and of course the everclassic 芥川龍之介s 羅生門 (a collection of short stories transcribed from very old 古文), a translated copy of Gullivers Travels, and one more I can't put my hands on. 

About me: I got my BA in Japanese Language and Literature in 08' from one of the best programs in the US. Ive been studying for about 10 years now. I've been out of Japan for almost 2 years and I feel my kanji is fading away so I need something to keep me reading and practicing and it sounds like you guys need some good text to study from outside the a-typical anime and VG bullshit [which is usually not real 日本語 btw but stylized cool-guy-go as I call it.] If you guys are into it, lemme know and Ill type up the excerpts from the back and let you guys pick. Darkman is the most epic but its HUGE two vols 500 pages each, which would be about 1,750 pages in English according to a number I just made up in my head. I've read the first vol, not the second. The other books I bought but never got into.  

[e]id love to know why people are downvoting this. im offering to basically give the fruits of my own study to you in the hopes of some communial learning and open debate. my most fun class in all my college career was the 500 level translation class; everyone reads the same passage and we compared our interpretations. it leads to fantastic discussion. I don't particularly find anime and manga to be good sources of applicable tango, but i've seriously enjoyed the yakuza novels and find it so much more applicable to modern japanese, much the same with doramas [which could be another topic as well.] so, downvoters, whyusodown?

However, after the Tang Dynasty, when most of the characters that are used in Japan were taken, it seems less clear what the dominate choice of dialect was for taking pronunciations.

This is something I am trying out, as of now there's only one video, since I only had the idea this morning.

The reason why I chose the sign language news instead of other program, because it is the most clearly typed TV program there is (for people with hearing impair, I guess that's true for non-Japanese speaker). 

I am aware that other TV shows provide closed-caption but often they are incomplete or out of sync. 

Also, I have tried to directly record the news instead of using a screen-capture program, but the output .ts file can't even be opened. i don't know if it is a hardware problem or a software one. But as of now I think this is pretty good.

I will try to record as much as I can, there are different news clips on different days, and at 845 on weekday there are 15 mins news.

P.S. On a personal note, i do this as a way to brush up my japanese since I will be transcribing some of the news (if I can), let me know if this is a good idea.

Basically, if you use the default Android font (which can't be changed unless you root you phone), some Kanji will be displayed as the Chinese variant instead of the Japanese.

This issue has been around for a couple of years at least, but it seems like there is still no solution, other than rooting the phone or changing the system language (an option that isn't available on all phones).

Some apps such as Obenkyo and AnkiDroid have added the option to change font, which allows them to display the correct characters.

reality of the JLPT as well as how it's scored.",28,4,35,http://www.reddit.com/r/LearnJapanese/comments/zf63v/this_is_the_best_post_ive_ever_seen_explaining/,"ErIog at SomethingAwful posted this in the Japanese Language thread. It's really one of the best explanations I've ever seen of how the JLPT works and how useful/practical it is.

&gt; Outside of the Vocab/Grammar section's letter grades it is impossible to know based on your score how many questions you got right/wrong. So you can't really say, ""Oh...if my score from 5 years was counted this year then I would have passed...."" The test scoring was completely different back in the kyuu system.

&gt; The new test scoring method is not a flat Questions Right/Questions Wrong calculation. They're using a test scoring strategy called Item Response Theory that curves the value of each individual question based on how many people got them right or got them wrong. Fewer people getting a question right makes that question worth more points.

&gt; This is why in the Vocab/Grammar section they also give you letter grades that do correspond to that flat score.

&gt; Instead of comparing your performance to only the test directly, they're comparing you to the other test-takers. With a very small sample size you might encounter variance in the levels between sessions, but so many people take the test each time that it still makes sense statistically. 

&gt; The reason they moved to this model was to make test scores more comparable between sessions. By taking into account data about how hard certain questions there's more of a buffer between a really easy test or a really hard test having an impact on the number of people that pass.

&gt; There's a long explanation of it with a lot of graphs here: http://www.jlpt.jp/e/about/pdf/scaledscore_e.pdf

&gt; We are still seeing some swings in the pass rate between the December(35%) and July(45%) test. I think that has more to do with fewer people outside of Japan taking that July test. People living in Japan already tend to have an easier time with the test, go figure.

&gt; Also, on a super nit-picky side note that's going to make people think I'm a dick, you having a piece of paper that says you're Level 1 instead of Level 2 doesn't make your level higher. You'd still be a guy walking around with the exactly same level, but with just a different piece of paper. Maybe your conversation skills are amazing so it might have gotten you an interview for a job you wouldn't have gotten before...maybe.

&gt; The JLPT certification doesn't actually open up that many doors. JLPT1 only represents around a high school level of literacy. It doesn't test speaking/writing at all. Even after having passed the test, myself, there's still tons and tons of embarrassing basic things I don't understand.

&gt; So even if all of you had passed １級 back then you'd still be in the same boat of trying to move forward with the language. It's not like you could have just called it a life and stopped studying. The JLPT is a stepping-stone on the way to fluency. It's not an end goal by itself unless you have a very specific work-related need for having only that level of Japanese and no further.",,False,,t5_2qyls,False,,,True,t3_zf63v,http://www.reddit.com/r/LearnJapanese/comments/zf63v/this_is_the_best_post_ive_ever_seen_explaining/,

The previous post is here:

http://www.reddit.com/r/LearnJapanese/comments/njxlq/awesome_new_free_way_to_learn_japanese_while/ 

Based on these comments, we have since added the following major features:

-You can import any ""embeddable"" video from YouTube. It will automatically import subtitles if available, otherwise you can add your own.

-Subtitles text can be adjusted for both the original and translated languages. Anyone can help add and improve subtitle translations (desktop version only).

-Subtitle timing can be adjusted. (Currently there are no on-screen instructions for this, so please see http://wiki.studystre.am/en/view/Adjust_Timing for details.)

-Entries in the dictionary can be edited/added. This way anyone can add to or help improve our dictionaries (desktop version only).

-Administrators can roll back most types of edits in case something goes wrong.

We have also fixed several bugs Reddit users pointed out to us:

-The browser back and forward buttons now function properly for HTML 5 compatible browsers (latest versions of Firefox, Google Chrome, Safari). We are still implementing a graceful degradation for IE.

-Copy/paste into password fields now detects password change.

-Fixed bugs where videos would not load properly on certain system configurations

-Fixed iOS compatibility issues. We are still working on improving the overall mobile experience.

In the next version we plan to revamp the exercises system to be easier to manage, include more exercise types, and make various other improvements.

Additionally, our New York team has entered StudyStream into the NYC Big Apps contest. You can see the entry video here:

At this point in my life, I could get TEFL-certified and build my credentials enough to eventually get into JET, spend a couple years teaching English and boosting my proficiency through immersion.   

However, I'm suddenly come to a point where I'm wondering why I'm even keeping it up.

For my level of Japanese: I finished RTK, can read Hiragana/Katakana, have a basic vocabulary of maybe 200-300 words. Some of my goals with learning Japanese include speaking with Native Japanese people, playing Japanese only games, reading/watching native material, and just being able to navigate Japan better when I go to visit. I do have a business degree though so if opportunities arise I may be able to use Japanese in a business setting (I'm assuming polite speak is used more in business?) 

Do you think formal speech will be easier after learning casual and vice versa? Or does it not really matter?

The point of this post is to gather resources that aren't that well known but are still really helpful.

I haven't ever posted here before but I have been learning Japanese quite diligently for about 2 years now. That may not seem like a long time but it is the longest I have ever pursued any of my many hobbies with such intensity. I'm talking several hours a day consistently, thought I am still only OK and have a long way to go. That is why when I find great resources these days I believe that they must be pretty rare because I have been searching this entire time and not come across them.

Let me repeat; this is not Genki,  LANG8, Anki, Heisig or Tae Kim (The one's I use and that everyone knows are awesome already). These are simply sites and resources that you think have been overlooked or are hard to find that could be of benefit to everyone else.

So reasoning aside, here is what I have found recently that has been really awesome for my studies. Please post your own. And if you have heard of these already, don't maketh the fun of me, just post your own to show me up.

I'm new here, but I recently discovered this place when my site was mentioned in someone else's post. I must say that I was shocked at all of the traffic and people that came along with it. But, I want to make the best of this opportunity.

My name is Seth, and I have been rigorously studying Japanese for over 5 years. I made my site mainly for bettering my own skills and keeping track with everything that I've studied. Now, it's starting to become a genuine curriculum. I hope that it will become even better this year.

There is a lot of work involved. There are constantly different projects going on, and then I have to have time for tutoring and school as well as my own study time. Earlier last year I had the site proofread by a lot of native speakers. Although I'm sure there are plenty of things that need to be fixed and or elaborated on, it's hard when only one person is doing all of the work. 

This week I plan to go through each lesson and see how I can make things easier, what might be best somewhere else in the site, and what needs more examples or better explanation. It's hard to believe that just this weekend alone I've already cut 5 pages of stuff just from verbosity and formatting changes to a handful of lessons. 

It's really hard to go through lessons when you're the one that wrote them. Sometimes there will be a blatant typo and it won't get spotted until a reader tells me about it. God only knows how many time that's already happened. lol

I know you can't please everyone, but I do want this place to be better than it is. If there is something that you don't like, please tell me. I want to address it promptly. I have a lot of time on my hands, and it's better when I have objectives to shoot for. 

It's a big resource. So, by no means does anyone have to go through it all...I certainly can't in a day. But, it would be nice to have some really good feedback about things to work on and improve. 

Japanese natives should visit more too. It really helps with English, and for some their Japanese. 

So, I want 2013 to be much better than 2012. My own Japanese will probably be a lot better by the end of the year than it is now.

1341547841.0,23,self.LearnJapanese,w43it,Messing around with Heisig and Python,26,3,20,http://www.reddit.com/r/LearnJapanese/comments/w43it/messing_around_with_heisig_and_python/,"Phew, a lot of Heisig-related posts here lately, aren't there? Sorry about that, but I promise this one is a little different...

As most of you know, the subject of Heisig/RTK is a somewhat contentious one in the Japanese learning community, provoking a lot of love/hate reactions. I've watched and been involved in a few discussions here, and a common complaint about it seems to be that the method forces you to learn a great number of kanji that are rarely used or otherwise fairly useless, in order to get to more common kanji later in the set. This got me thinking about the way RTK works and how it could be optimized.

I probably don't have to explain this to most of you, but RTK functions by ordering the kanji in a specific way, so that kanji which form primitives inside others are learned first, and this helps with learning the meanings of more complex ones. For example, 議 (deliberation) is a fairly common kanji, but also a rather complex one to write. So, Heisig has you first learn 言 (words), 羊 (sheep), 我 (ego), then 義 (righteousness = sheep + ego), and finally 議 (words + righteousness). As a result, despite the fact that 我 and 義 are less frequently used than 義, you end up learning them first. Essentially, for the nerd-speak enabled, RTK functions as a directed acyclic graph of kanji-dependancies. Sweet.

But, aside from the dependency information listed above, the order given in RTK is actually fairly arbitrary. Heisig's method is to choose a single primitive, and then to list all the kanji that are possible to write using that primitive plus any combination of the previous primitives.

So, here was my idea: what if, instead of using Heisig's order, we order the kanji primarily by frequency, while still constraining them via Heisig's DAG? Could this actually work, and produce an ordering that would give a fairly close approximation to the learning order we want, without losing the simplified mnemonics of RTK?

Well, once I asked, I had to know the answer. The hardest part was compiling the raw dependency information into a machine-readable format. Stripping the text out of an RTK pdf file helped, but there was still a LOT of hand-manipulation (手掌, hehe) that had to be done to fix ambiguities, typos, scrambled data, etc. But once I finally had everything sanely loaded into a .csv file, all it took was a very simple python script to run any arbitrary ordering through the DAG.

The results are really interesting! I've used two orders so far: the ""frequency"" field in the KANJIDIC db, which is based on a study of Japanese newspapers, and the ""grade"" in the Jouyou kanji list, i.e. the order Japanese children are taught in school (unfortunately, I can't find an easily parsable reference to the actual order of the kanji within a grade, but in the long run this probably doesn't matter too much). It turns out that if you only want to learn the first 500 most frequently used newspaper kanji, you only have to learn 755 kanji/primitives total! And to learn the 1000 most frequently used, you only have to learn 1269 total. Oddly enough, the ""DAG overhead"" seems to stay fairly constant at around 250 for almost any number of ""target"" kanji. Weird.

Here are the output files from my two sample runs. If you're completely lost as to what I've been talking about until now, you can look at the ordering of these (increasing the font size helps) to hopefully clarify things a bit:

[KANJIDIC Frequency](http://pleep.com/~will/neworder-freq.html)

[School Order](http://pleep.com/~will/neworder-school.html)

The fields are:

Heisig Index,Kanji,Keyword,Frequency Index

Now, I'm not claiming that these orderings are better in every way than RTK. Clearly there are going to be advantages and disadvantages to any order. For example, Heisig believes that learning kanji with the same primitive close together helps with recall (from Lesson 36: ""Fortunately, nearly all the thread-related kanji to be covered in this book will appear in this lesson, so you can learn them all at once.""). But, for every ""grouped"" primitive like this, there are plenty of kanji with primitives that heisig spreads all around willy-nilly. Are these kanji really that much harder to learn than the others? In my opinion, it depends greatly on the quality of the story you use. Top-rated stories from kanji.koohii.com go a long way in making RTK do-able.

Also, more work remains to be done. For one thing, there are surely still bugs in the input data which will result in kanji coming out in the wrong order. ~~It would be nice to have a pre-made Anki deck shared (I've been fooling around with exporting and importing from text files, but I don't quite have it working yet)~~. Most importantly, I'd like to get some feedback from people as to whether this whole idea seems useful or not. If not, that's fine, it was amusing enough to find out the answer to my question. But if people try this ordering and like it, maybe I will put up a web page to act as a central place to go for information. I am also open to suggestions for additional useful learning orders which I haven't thought of.

Finally, if someone wants the full .csv source dataset to play around with, let me know; I'm not going to post it publicly to avoid violating Heisig's copyright.

**TLDR**: I changed the ordering of RTK to make it easier to learn commonly-used kanji without having to go through the entire set. Feedback is appreciated.

I can say, i've been having a lot of fun learning Japanese usually 1 - 2 hours a day, I know half of the hiragana alphabet, can introduce myself / greet people , ask for my orders in resturants, count, say sorry and some other stuff.

I'm definetly considering to live in Japan in the future, and it will be a pretty huge milestone in my life if I succeed in doing so. I'm getting started on the language right away and I am 17 years old at the moment if anyone is curious + live in the UK, which is kind of concerning for me.

I really want to be able to speak fluently in Japanese, but without having people to practice it with, it can get frustrating. I want to try confront some Japanese tourists and strike a conversation, but with only 2 weeks of learning on my back it can be nerve racking and if they don't speak english it can get awkward so im going to leave that option to a later date.

Is there anything you guys can recommend for me to improve my learning, or am I heading in the right direction the way I am. I've attempted reading many japanese news articles and just making out hiragana characters and pronouncing them, watching japanese movies (with english subs though) and listening to their music.

Another thing is, I'm a public high school student in Georgia (State, not country) and my local school only teaches Spanish (Which I'm in, Spanish I, and really dislike it.) and our State does have a system in place where I can take online, instructor lead classes (GAVS).. The only problem is, our school's guidance staff, from what I hear talking to teachers and others, is really hard to persuade to allow you to take classes on this system unless you're already a Spanish speaker, so I'll likely have to teach myself.

Play some pokémon!,30,7,18,http://www.reddit.com/r/LearnJapanese/comments/1b52gh/learning_to_read_hiraganakatakana_play_some/,"So, I wanted to start learning japanese. I figured that a good way was to start with hiragana, move on to katakana, and then build up a vocabulary with kanji. But I had a hard time finding good ways to learn hiragana. The [wikipedia article](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hiragana) had a very nice chart, so I used that to decipher different lines of text I found in animes and [flash games](http://detarou.web.fc2.com/game/barber.html), but those lines were always cluttered up with a lot of katakana and kanji, so it didn't work out very well. 

Then I found a japanese version of pokémon gold. Here, every line was written in only hiragana, with names in katakana. I took print screens of the character charts from wikipedia, put them besides my [VBA](http://coolrom.com/emulators/gba/14/Visual_Boy_Advance.php) window, and started playing.

In 24 hours play time (mostly of which was spent on reading what trainers were saying) my reading improved from having to look up 50% of the hiragana and all of the katakana, to being able to read reasonably fast (about 2 characters a second, and only having to look up some katakana, as well as stuff like さ vs ち).

So if you are in the same situation as I was in, I really recommend this!

2. The rudest version possible.

NB: ""polite"" does not mean ""formal"" (i.e., です・ます). ""rude"" does not mean ""casual"" (i.e., タメ語, だ・る).

Edit: For added hilarity, translate your Japanese into the equivalent English as well.

The other one I know that is similar in construction is 「食わず嫌い」（くわずぎらい）, which from what I can gather means ""Even though one hasn't eaten something, one hates it."" So like ""Don't eat (but already) dislike"". But this is different in meaning in so many ways...

After five years my knowledge of Japanese is still very simplistic and shallow, though arguably it's broad-ranging in a lot of different contexts.  But It's not deep--I can't hold my own in a conversation or build sentences, sometimes even basic sentences and verbs.

This makes me really shy when it comes to speaking with Japanese people.  I can fake it, sometimes, kind of randomly, and Japanese will think I can actually speak Japanese.  But after a few minutes I run out of steam and my sentences remain pretty simple.  

Anyway, to put it simply, my Japanese level has plateaued.  I know enough to get by, but starting conversations--especially in novel situations--is really difficult for me.  Anyone in this situation ever break out and start really speaking well?  What was your strategy?  Any advice would be great.

**EDIT**:  I didn't elaborate on my Japanese level and am selling myself a bit short.  I can get by in day-to-day, survival Japanese.  I know the basics pretty thoroughly...say, a first year Japanese textbook.  I took the JLPT, back when it was 4 levels, and took the 3級 but didn't pass.  Now, I think I could probably pass the N3, but I'd probably have to study.  I've done the Heisig method with kanji, and I have solid grasp of about 1,000 kanji/words.  

To a rank beginner, if they saw me speaking Japanese they might think I was totally fluent.  To someone totally fluent, they'd know pretty quick my Japanese sucks.

My job doesn't require me to speak any Japanese, though I do a bit.

So the basics I know and can get by.  I live with my Japanese gf and we mostly speak in English, though a kind of weird hybrid English/Japanese.  Of course, I can already hear the advice ""just speak to your gf in Japanese!""  I do, and I try to increase this, but speaking solely Japanese with her is hard for her, too.

I've been studying Japanese for about six months now. I'm studying Japanese at university, but it's been very slow, and I've found so far that it's not difficult to move far ahead of the course. What I've been struggling with is making the move between studying parts of the language in isolation (grammar points, kanji, vocabulary etc.), and actually facing authentic texts written in Japanese. At the moment I have a comfortable knowledge of around 250 - 300 kanji, but without any use for them, it's becoming an effort to maintain them in my memory while moving ahead. I figure a good way to help with retaining what I've learnt is to try and work through Japanese texts (no doubt very slowly!), but I'm totally unsure of where to start since everything in Japanese is still so daunting to look at! So I was wondering if anyone has any suggestions for how (and possibly when if I'm trying to step RIGHT out of my league) to move into the realm of actual reading in Japanese.

Such as Japanese people bow their head while talking on the cell phone, knowing that the other person can't see them bow. I think that's so interesting.


The other is role playing. My lady friend is from Japan and I like to pretend that I am an office worker named Hoshi Fukami. It's a bit weird and quite funny, but it sure as hell makes learning Japanese memorable.

Since you asked so nice here you go. It surprises me how little video games are talked about on this reddit, so let me help change that. It surprises me even more that retro video games are never suggested as an option especially due to their low entry level. So here is a quick starter guide. In the way that video game technology advanced, games almost fall into 3 ""levels"" of kanji amount.  The levels are:


1. No kanji whatsoever. Early games did not have the extra space for kanji and many games where aimed for children.


2. Some kanji. These games have some very basic kanji such as 私 or 分 but there may be much more in intro text crawls/intertitles or on signs. Probably around 100 kanji tops for dialog. Example of a intertitle: http://i.imgur.com/zDlf3.jpg


3. Full use of kanji. Development technique had advanced far enough for  full/almost full use of kanji


Some recommendations by system: 

Game Boy/Color - have yet to find a game with any kanji. 

Saga 1-3(Final Fantasy Legend 1-3),
Kaeru no Tame ni Kane wa Naru,
Seiken Densetsu(Final Fantasy Adventure)



NES/Famicom- Almost all game are Level1 but have a few notable Level 2 exceptions. 


Level 1:
Final Fantasy 1-3,
Dragon Quest 1-4,
Digital Devil Story: Megami Tensei 1&amp;2,
Sweet Home,
Mother(Earthbound Zero)

Level 2: 
hitler no fukkatsu(Bionic Commando in the US)




Super Nintendo/Super Famicom


Level 1:
Final Fantasy IV,
Dragon Quest V,
Super Mario Rpg,
Shin Megami Tensei 1


Level 2:

Mother 2(Earthbound)-a few intertitles only,
Seiken Densetsu 2(Secret of Mana)- Almost no kanji in dialog but tons in intertitles. ,
Dragon Quest VI,


Level 3:
Final Fantasy V-VI,
Chrono Trigger,
Tales Of Phantasia,
Star Ocean,
Shin Megami Tensei 2/ Shin Megami Tensei if....,


Reasons this helps learning(in my opinion)

1. Helps general reading.

2. Exposes the reader to different styles of writing kana/kanji(Handwritten style fonts vs more computer styled ones.)

3. Make your friends jealous!

Hope this has been helpful. I would love to hear everyone's suggestions/comments!

1322238517.0,22,self.LearnJapanese,moz60,Living Japanese: Break Free from the School Mindset,33,11,11,http://www.reddit.com/r/LearnJapanese/comments/moz60/living_japanese_break_free_from_the_school_mindset/,"When it comes to self-teaching Japanese, many people fall back on their previous experience with teaching and learning to figure out how to go about their business. For instance, the majority of people wanting to self-teach Japanese begin by looking for a textbook to use as the basis for their study. They also set up strict lesson plans for how much they will cover each day and feel satisfied that following the example of their childhood schooling will bring them good results.

Wrong.

If you would be so kind as to look back at the days of your obligatory education, I think you'll recall that the vast majority of the time you only learned the bare minimum that was necessary and then forgot it. Furthermore, without parents, teachers, and the government all pushing you to attend, you probably would have never continued going to school. I realize that many people do enjoy learning and school, but I think we can all admit that there were many days that we didn't want to be there, yet were forced to attend anyways.

With self-teaching, that doesn't happen. If you start feeling like you don't want to “attend school,” then school doesn't happen. Unless you have a support group, nobody is going to be there to push you. You are completely in control of your learning, which means that it's all on YOU to keep yourself wanting to come back. That means no lesson plans, no textbooks, no forcing yourself to eat all of your vegetables before you can have any cake (I use this metaphor too much). With self-teaching, a different approach is needed.

My preferred method for maintaining a healthy self-teaching environment is to hide all of the learning inside of something fun. Instead of sitting down to learn vocabulary, I sit down to read manga. The vocabulary will come with the manga, but the focus is on enjoying the story. The same for watching Japanese TV, chatting with friends in Japanese, or anything else you do - focus on the fun and not on the studying. Despite what we may like to think, we are still very much children inside. What is fun is what gets done, so make learning Japanese as fun as possible.

The important thing to take from this article is that you can't act like a drill instructor. Be gentle with yourself and remember that all things Japanese will move you closer to fluency. Also, if you begin to dread your contact with Japanese, then change things up and just be lazy. Remind yourself of why you want to learn Japanese and perhaps try your hand at some new material that you've been putting off. You have complete control over how you learn, so make your method comfortable for yourself.

* Long-playing interviews (often longer than an hour) with media people. The subject can be anything from variety to political. The interviewers keep changing around, so things don't ever get stale. Also, they have ""adult"" talks at regular intervals, which I admit can get pretty steamy.

I'm an intermediate learner of Japanese. I passed the JLPT N4 last December, and I'm currently planning to take the N3 this year (although I'm studying with N2 books at the moment). I'm also reading through Yotsuba and Zoo, and I generally feel like I'm getting pretty comfortable with reading light Japanese alongside a dictionary.

However, I literally can't speak a word of Japanese. When someone asks me to demonstrate my Japanese, I try to think of something to say and no words come out. Today, I had a first meeting with a private teacher because I want to get over my speaking problem (not a lesson yet, just meeting to talk a bit before we start classes). She tried to encourage me to speak to her in Japanese, but the most I was able to do was utter one word and then switch to English.

Anyone else had this issue? Any advice for how to improve your speaking ability? I get it that the best thing is to just practice, but I'm afraid at my current state I can't really even begin to practice this skill...",,False,,t5_2qyls,False,,,True,t3_1f59pf,http://www.reddit.com/r/LearnJapanese/comments/1f59pf/any_tricks_for_going_over_the_speaking_barrier/,

* Do not use URL shorteners.  People don't like clicking links if they can't see what the destination is, and the spam filter automatically removes posts/comments that use them.  If the link is long, just use the comment markdown to make a text link; it's not difficult.
* If you are posting a link as a new topic, please comment on your link or include text in your post as well.  Explain why you think people will find it helpful/funny/whatever.  This goes double if the link is to something that costs money.  (If you want to post to a paid resource that you made, messaging the mods beforehand would be a highly-appreciated courtesy.)
* Do not post links using a brand new account.  I think anyone actually bothering to read this post is OK on this count.

It's a shame when someone writes a helpful comment which then sits in the mod queue for six hours because the spam filter removed it.  The filter is extremely picky about suspicious links; sticking to these guidelines will ensure that your posts and comments make it through.

And before someone suggests it, we can't make the filter less picky.  Sorry.

(Preemptive clarification: There's nothing wrong with the content of the links that are being posted.  They just look suspicious because of *how* they're posted.)",,False,,t5_2qyls,False,,,True,t3_17b391,http://www.reddit.com/r/LearnJapanese/comments/17b391/meta_guidelines_for_posting_links/,moderator

You get to practice what you know as you ask the question. People answering questions have to try a little harder to explain in Japanese, and people around the same level can benefit not just from the answer itself, but also from reading the thread. Think of it as language immersion, reddit-style.

I'll post a situation every week (roughly), giving you the social context and leaving the actual dialog up to you. Your job is to write a reply in Japanese in the *appropriate* register.

**What's register?**

Register is a fancy word for ""formality"" or ""politeness.""

**Why bother?**

Foreigners usually suck at speaking/writing in the proper register for various reasons and excuses. I'm especially bad at it.

A lot of Japanese people let it slide because ""oh, he's foreign and doesn't know better.""

So this is a good chance to practice and learn.

**Challenge #2**

You wake up at 5 in the morning and your stomach is rumbling like a bag of angry ducks. After spending 40 minutes on the toilet you decide that there's no way you're going to work and call your boss (male, 10 years older than you, stiffly formal) to ask for the day off.

Bonus: Call a doctor's office and ask for an appointment.

I'm sorry for asking this, but I popped in, subscribed, hit the faqs on the side and to my dismay found its resource section quite sparse as of now. I thought I'd try asking users directly, *what are you using or recommending to learn the language?*

Should I mention first-off my experience for sake of making it easier for people to recommend things? You can skip the next few paragraphs if it doesn't matter much.

 I took maybe less than a year of introductory Japanese in high school to get away from my hated adversary: high school french. At first I took the course JUST to complete the language requirement, because I was never a fan of French. It sounds fantastic, but I can't for the life of me pronounce things properly or grapple with the million silent letters. 

The course eventually piqued my interest in Japan's food and culture as well. Unfortunately, I did quite poorly in this class, skirting between a c and a c-. In fact, it was sort of a mark of shame. A couple of years later, when I graduated, they ended up putting that freaking course on my final report card (It 'counted' as a grade 11 course I believe, even though I took it in grade 9) and it brought my average down *ALMOST* a full letter grade.

ANYWAYS! Recently my cousin's been sharing his anime love with me (I'm not really a fan of the art style... but some of the stories are really good!) and I'm occasionally catching a word or phrase I recognize from that course years back. It's rekindled my interest.

My attempt at googling for a good site to learn japanese sort of left me overwhelmed -- there's so much out there, and I have no clue which of them are GOOD and which are rubbish. The faqs on this subreddit appears to be unfinished as of now, especially the resources section. I understand that such things take time and that the faqs seems to be a recent undertaking, so I'm not faulting /r/learnjapanese for it or anything like that!

This, of course, goes along with all the other Japanese learning features we have such as the lessons, drills, quizzes and dictionary.  But the question is, would it be really worth building out? Since a lot of our users come from here, we wanted to ask you all. :)

If you don't know about our site, go to http://www.nihongomaster.com/ to learn Japanese.  Use the special reddit invite code I made for this community: ganbatte

**Handwriting / Stroke order**

Reddit says: Learn you stroke order.

**Writing on a computer**
Most people use Windows IME (for Windows) or Google IME: http://www.google.com/ime/. 
Both do the job.

I would recommend assigning a shortcut to conveniently switch between languages. Example: Ctrl+Shift+Number. Now you should be able to type. 

For truly beginners: Choose the hiragana option. You type the hiragana. If you want katakana then type the word and hit space and choose the katakana. Be precise or it wont recognize the word, so remember ""-"" if they are a part of the word. Example: ""パーティ"". Press enter when you are done writing the word/letter. OR you can type the word and press F7. If you want the kanji then type it out in hiragana, hit space and choose from the list. 

Things to be aware of; all small kana can be typed ""l + kana"" or ""x + kana"". Examples:

* ィ is typed ""li"" or ""xi"".

* ティ is typed ""thi"" or ""texi"".

* づ is typed ""du"". 

* ぢ is typed ""di"".

Another thread made me realize that some people might not understand the technical aspects of rendering Japanese on their computers.

When your browser encounters text, it tries to render it with the font that the website suggests. If the browser doesn't have it, it will use the default fonts it has registered. Because Chrome doesn't have a way to specify fonts for specific languages, on websites that don't specify a Japanese font, depending on what you have installed, Chrome may render kanji as Chinese versions of the characters with slight variations on strokes for some characters. (Edit: As flamingspinach pointed out this issue is not just limited to Chrome or to Windows, it can happen in other software/OS combinations, so always keep a vigilant eye for a misconfigured system)

To test if your browser can properly differentiate between languages, look at the table here: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Han_unification#Examples_of_language_dependent_characters

For a given row, the Chinese characters and Japanese characters should look different. If they do not, then be careful. You can technically fix it by making all fonts set to MS Gothic or Mincho, but then English sites will look horrible.

An example would be the word ""do"" meaning ""to have sex"". In Japanese, you can say やる to mean the same thing, which is also directly translatable as ""do"" in other contexts. Another example would be the fact that in English, ""cry"" can refer to both shedding tears and an animal making a sound - just like なく (泣く, 鳴く) in Japanese. Another is ""take"" (edit: *only* in the below instances! I am not talking about the word ""take"" in general!):

Take a photo - 写真を撮る

Take someone's bag - 誰かのかばんを盗る

Take time - 時間を取る (some contexts)

Take nutrition - 栄養を摂る

One that was so seemingly unlikely that I looked it up was the fact that ""Saturn"" and ""Saturday"" both have the same root, just like 土星 and 土曜日 in Japanese - and it turned out that the Japanese (Chinese) words did originate from contact with Europeans. I guess these can't really be answered on anything other than a case by case basis, but I know there are people with backgrounds in linguistics here - are most of these coincidences? Or are actual cases of borrowing going on here?

A couple more - 

""Sell your body"" - 体を売る

""Swallow a story"" - 話を鵜呑みにする

**Edit: So after reading a bit about this, I've found that the actual linguistic term for what I'm talking about here is [calque](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calque). The article gives 摩天楼 as one example, which is pretty obviously not a coincidence.

I'm an intermediate 日本語 student, and I've been doing a bit of self studying outside of my courses.

I stumbled upon the 漢字 ""向,"" and was having trouble discerning the meanings of the following pairs of verbs and adjectives:

Verb pairs: 向く、向かう
Adj: 向かい、向こう

For the verbs, I know that both 向く and 向かう are intransitive, but what is the difference between the two? I tried looking online, but could only find this (I actually found a lot in 日本語, but my reading and comprehension skills are so pitiful it would take hours more 漢字 research just to learn how to read the explanation lol):

http://www.guidetojapanese.org/forum/viewtopic.php?id=4679

The replies don't give me much  - the final two seem to contradict one another.

As for the adjective thingys (向かい and 向こう), I looked them up in my classes online 電子辞書 and found that they almost have the exact same meaning (向かい is said to be a noun  and  a の-adjective - like お店のむかいがある). 

Can anyone here explain these differences? Sorry about the wall of text - I'm just stumped. ありがとう",,False,,t5_2qyls,False,,,True,t3_15hmk4,http://www.reddit.com/r/LearnJapanese/comments/15hmk4/向かい向こう_and_向く向かう/,

&gt;We will now learn several other ways 「とする」 can be used. It may help to keep in mind that 「とする」 is really just a combination of the quotation particle 「と」 and the verb 「する」 meaning ""to do"". Let's say you have a sentence: [verb]とする. This means literally that you are doing like ""[verb]"" (in quotes). As you can see, when used with the volitional, it becomes: ""Doing like making motion to do [verb]"". In other words, you are acting as if to make a motion to do [verb]. As we have already seen, this translates to ""attempt to do [verb]"". Let's see what happens when we use it on plain verbs.

I get the literal translation and how it can also be stated as attempted to do [verb], and the next two examples given make sense to me too.

**Example A**


明日に行くとする。

Assume we go tomorrow.

**Example B**

In this example they show how it can be used with the conditional to express ""assuming if"":

今から行くとしたら、９時に着くと思います。

If we suppose that we go from now, I think we will arrive at 9:00.

**The problem comes next.**

 It says that in addition to changing it into the conditional form, the する can also be changed to the てーform to be used as a sequence of actions. I understand that the てーform can be used to express this, but the examples and explanation given confused me.

**Examples**

&gt;観客として参加させてもらった。

&gt;Received favor of allowing to participate as spectator.

&gt;被害者としては、非常に幸いだった。

&gt;As a victim, was extremely fortunate.

&gt;朝ご飯を食べたとしても、もう昼だからお腹が空いたでしょう。

&gt;Even assuming that you ate breakfast, because it's already noon, you're probably hungry, right?

**Explanation**

&gt;The same idea applies here as well. In example 1, you are doing like a ""spectator"" and doing like a ""victim"" in example 2 and finally, doing like you ate breakfast in example 3. So you can see why the same grammar applies for all these types of sentences because they all mean the same thing in Japanese (minus the use of additional particles and various conjugations of 「する」).

Can someone explain where the 'assuming' part went in Example 1 and 2?

Here is a review of the book for anyone who would want to use it to study for the next JLPT:

Vocab section - helpful, but there were a lot a of words I learned that weren't on the test. This is really good for someone who wants to learn Japanese on the whole, but bad if you just have a month or 2 left and want to focus only on JLPT vocab. 

Grammar - this was by far the worst section of the book. Almost none of the grammar points the book has, were on the JLPT. I am glad I learned all this new grammar, but it didnt help me on the JLPT whatsoever. I wish there were some grammar points in here that were actually on the test. Although, on the ""star"" portion of the test where you have to organize the sentences, it did fairly well and really prepared me for not only the format, so I was confident in that section on the test as well.

Reading - wonderful. It really prepared me for all the long readings at my level and had very relevant questions so I was really prepared for the readings when I took the test. 

Listening - OK. I helped me get used to the listening section of the test and sounds very similar to the JLPT tapes. I didn't complete the listening section of the book (only did 1 CD out of 2) so I am not sure how helpful it could have been if I had finished. 

Overall I would say the book is a great if you have the money for it. It was quick to complete and I loved the reading section, as it was my worst skill on the last JLPT. But there are comparable sites online, so if you don't need much practice, not worth the price. 

Now let us know what books you used and if they accurately prepared you for the test. I need some new study material for next year and I am sure everyone else does too!

My goal is to be able to hold a conversation on any normal topic and be able to read books without the subtext next to all the kanji. I'm probably 100 kanji in out of the 2000 needed to be a normal person. It hurts real bad. 

There seems to be very little out aimed at people like me. I also see my nephew and have no hope for him to speak Japanese at all.

I've taken 2 semesters of first-level Japanese at university, but I don't have time next year to continue with it... In class we've gone through all of ""Japanese: The Spoken Language Level 1"" and the written language component, so I know hiragana, katakana, about 130 kanji, and a good amount of basic grammar. 

What would be the best way to keep progressing on my own? A lot of materials or programs I've looked up seem to either be too advanced or only cover the basic forms and hiragana/katakana. Would it be enough to just keep learning kanji and get better that way? How can I improve my grammar as well?

I now have genki, but have put it off until school ended due to a lack of time to actually be able to learn.

School is soon ending, and since we really have no work left, I got a small head start (started about a week ago, self teaching for about 1-2 hours a day, I still lack the time I really want, but at least it's something, and I'm pretty eager to start)

I can very confidently identify all of the hiragana (and alternate sounds that each hiragana make) and form extremely basic statements and questions.

However, I was just told from an online group I am in that Tae Kim has a very, very good guide, that they say is better than genki.

I am just curious what you guys think of that guide in comparison to Genki.  Should I just abandon genki and start on tae kims guide? Should I progress to a certain point in genki before making the switch?  Or maybe I should just continue on with genki because in reality it's a surperior tool?

Thank you.

I was on my phone so the question was limited.
Basically I'm looking for specifics of what is said and when to say something.
In english I would say ""yes please.  Or no thank you, or hello and goodbye.  These things may or may not be said in a shop transaction so was hoping someone could clarify the differences.

*Shop: Hello, good morning!*

*Me: Hi, how are ya?*

*Shop: Good thanks.  would you like a bag?*

*Me: Yes please*

*Shop: Thats $15 total*

*Me: Here's $20 thankyou*

*Shop: Cheers*

*Me: Thanks*

*Shop: Here5 change*

Hell I'm not even at conversational level yet (though I am closing in fast). I do, however, know how difficult it can be to work out the difference between the particles wa and ga.

Second, remember that the topic marker 'wa' (normally わ) is always written with the hiragana for 'ha'. The particle 'wa' わ is a different particle with entirely different usage.

So as I said, wa and ga can be hard to tell apart, at least in the beginning. I found it easy to think of them as follows:

**Wa**

Think of it like ""Speaking of...""; so you're using it to comment on something that has already been introduced into the sentence.

Example:
""Kitamura-san wa gakusei desu"". It means ""Mr Kitamura is a student"", but you can think of it as ""Speaking of Mr Kitamura, he is a student"".

**Note** that wa can also come after what looks like a clause, object or phrase in English.

**Ga**

Ga が is the subject marker. There are a couple of ways you can think of it:

* As special emphasis to distinguish one thing from another, like in the sentence ""Tōkyō ga ōkii desu"". It means ""Tokyo is big"" but you can think of it as pointing out Tokyo in particular, as in ""It is Tokyo that is big"".

* In neutral descriptions or observable actions. ""Tegami ga kimashita"".

Hopefully this will help you distinguish between the two. There have been entire essays written on the distinction between the two as it is very subtle. And remember, as with most Japanese particles, wa and ga also have uses other than their most common.

Yes I know there was another post about this but it was months ago. Figured I'd give my little piece of help.

If you find this to be bullshit, please tell me!

The examples were taken from a nice little book called [Barron's Japanese Grammar](http://www.amazon.co.uk/s/ref=nb_sb_ss_i_0_6?url=search-alias%3Daps&amp;field-keywords=barron's+japanese+grammar&amp;x=0&amp;y=0&amp;sprefix=nagato)

I have 2 decks where I have to ""write the missing kanji"" (one for all the jouyou kanji(downloaded), one for kanji kentei problems(self created))

I have 3 decks of words that I encounter in daily life and have to look up in my dictionary. (I make a new deck every 500 cards)(kanji to reading/meaning-self-created)

My friends and I have a ""deck exchange"" when we finish a 500 card deck, so I have personal decks from 3 other people(kanji to reading/meaning-received)

Lastly I have a new deck experimenting with the sentence method, where I put in a sentence that I get from native-oriented materials (books, news, etc) and any words that are difficult to read or understand I put on the other side of the card.

I really like the sentence method, but it takes a lot more time and work to create cards and to do reviews than my other decks.(self-created-sentence to reading/meaning)

I also have to really suggest doing personal deck exchanges with friends/classmates because those decks are always the funnest and most interesting to review.

As for how to stay motivated doing anki, when my reviews get all piled up and it is hard to stay motivated, I have an anki/game day where I put on a video game and time myself for 10 minutes, after which I must do 20-30 reviews before I can play the game for another 10 minutes. Works like a charm.

I started learning Japanese as a hobby roughly two years ago.

I am currently somewhere around lower intermediate, but ever since I returned from Japan my skills are fading fast.

My textbook Japanese is OK, I guess, but what I really lack is a framework for colloquial Japanese. Talking with Japanese people helps a bit, but picking up bit by bit while talking doesn't really cut it for me, so here is my question:

Do you guys know any good books, websites, anime etc. that cover an informal, everyday kind of Japanese? Considering all the social nuances I'd say maybe a form of Japanese that is best when used around friends or when striking up relaxed small talk with strangers in an informal setting, but not quite the slang kind of Japanese.

The program still has some minor issues as I've only been working on it for a few days. But I was hoping you guys could give me some input on what you think about it, if there's anything I should change and I would also like to know if you're interested in it.

Right now the program comes with five dictionaries all derived from Jim Breen's JDIC(the EDICT dictionary). There's one dictionary file that contains all words from JDIC except the ones that start with katakana or contain the {comp} tag which means the word is computer related(usually very high level as well). The rest of the dictionaries are all cropped variations of the above mentioned dictionary with some parts left out so you can choose to only get verbs for instance.

I'd love it if you guys could give it a try and give me some feedback, I'd be very much grateful!

For more detailed information check out the [readme](http://pastebin.com/ULBuXpTu).

Edit: A huge thanks to Jim Breen, Jim Breen's JDIC and everyone who's been involved in the project. The JDIC EDICT uses the EDICT files which are the property of the Electronic Dictionary Research and Development Group. They are used in conformance with the group's licence.

Edit2: Added five new dictionaries with vocabulary corresponding to the individual JLPT levels. Couresty of www.tanos.co.uk.

1349226150.0,15,self.LearnJapanese,10ukti,"A couple of beginner questions on pronunciation and learning kanji vs. kana vocabulary
",17,2,40,http://www.reddit.com/r/LearnJapanese/comments/10ukti/a_couple_of_beginner_questions_on_pronunciation/,"I am finally getting into the stage of my studies where I'm starting to pick up lots of new vocabulary, learning both written (kanji) and spoken (kana) words. This directly leads to my second question regarding study methods, but first I am getting curious about pronunciation, specifically about accenting mora within words. 

As one example, I have heard the name of the city ひろしま pronounced as both ""**Hi**ro**shi**ma"" and ""Hi**ro**shima"". There are other words that I have run across that seem to be accented differently in different situations as well. I'm wondering how important this is to be aware of at my stage of learning and if there is a standard or correct way to accent Japanese words. I suspect that there are probably regional differences in dialect, which leads me to wonder how to tell the difference when all I have are plain kana characters as reference. I'd hate to go to the trouble of learning all this and wind up sounding like the Japanese version of a backwoods bumpkin.

My second question has to do with gaining new vocabulary. I notice that most teaching methods separate this into learning spoken words via kana and learning reading/writing with kanji. I'm not very far into this at all and already I have separate Anki decks with large numbers of words in each one. The aggravating part of it is that there is little overlap between these two groups, so I find myself with a bunch of words I can say but not read/write in kanji, and a bunch for which I know kanji, but cannot speak. I am wondering then, whether it would be in my best interest to consolidate the decks and learn kanji, readings, and meaning for every new word, or just sit tight and let these two groups naturally merge over time. 

**tl;dr**: How do I tell where to put accents within words? Should I really be learning kanji &amp; spoken vocabulary separately?

Many thanks for any insight!

And this is where it gets tough. There's *only* 2000 kanji, there's *only* around 50 particles, there's *only* around 50 kata/hira, but there are bazillions of words and kanji combinations. Not only do you have to memorize the meaning, but also the sayings. Also, a lot of words are important, but hardly ever used (like President).

To anyone who has gotten past this phase, how do you do it without mind-numbing memorization?

As their website describes, they offer online tutoring/classes as well as private tutoring. I only took three 50 minute ""flex"" sessions with low-intermediate to intermediate grammar so I can't comment on the private or conversation lessons.

**Class Format**

The classes are held with a Java-based application (Mac and PC) that allows voice and video communication. It also comes with a few buttons, file transfers, a text chat box, and a power-point display where the instructor can show students slides and even type on the slides if necessary.

The instructor will show their webcam but students are not required to show their webcams.

Class sizes are listed at a max of 7 students, but the maximum number of students I have encountered was 4. There was also one session where I was the only student. 

Textbooks generally aren't required and no instructor required me to do homework or read from a textbook. All materials were included in the online lesson.

At the end of every session, the instructor will send you a PDF containing the basic notes (but not slides) for the lesson. Some instructors provide more information than others. You are also allowed to save the text chat notes for your personal use. Some instructors make an effort to write each student's response in the text chat so you can have a transcript for the session.

**Scheduling**

You can take the classes in any order at your own convenience. 

Generally you must reserve a ""class"" usually about a day in advance. A list of available classes can be searched and you can review the scheduled lesson summary to see if you feel comfortable with what the lesson will cover.

They will also send you a reminder email about 3 hours before your actual lesson time.

The schedule page does not show you how many students are enrolled in a particular session so you cannot see beforehand how many students will appear.

**Language**

Since I enrolled in the intermediate classes, all of the spoken explanations were in Japanese. I am not sure if the beginner classes are different.

The slides and attached notes each instructor sends out will have English explanations and definitions of key vocabulary so you can usually read the description to get the information.

Generally students would ask questions in Japanese and the instructor would try to give simpler explanations if possible. Otherwise students would have to type in the English word if they could not correctly convey their thoughts. This only happened once throughout all three of my sessions.

All of the instructors I interacted with appeared to be Japanese and were living in Japan. None of them tried to speak English.

**Kanji**

All of the Japanese was written with kana+kanji as you normally would with standard Japanese. However readings for *most* kanji were usually included (as well as English definitions). Very common kanji readings were not include such as taberu, nomu, kyou, etc.

**Lesson format**

Each lesson is basically a set of slides with a few explanation slides followed by exercise slides (typically fill in the blank, or complete the grammar structure, or question and answer). Each lesson will only cover 1 grammar point or 2 related grammar points.

For one lesson there was a reading first (demonstrating the grammar) followed by an explanation. But generally the format was grammar explanation followed by exercises.

For exercises, students are asked to read and respond to the prompts by speaking one after the other. Some instructors had each student repeat the same prompt, some went on to other prompts without repeating. There wasn't any writing (typing) involved on behalf of the students.

**Price**

The prices for flex lessons start at $59 for five 50 minute sessions and get cheaper as you purchase more lessons altogether. Private sessions are much more expensive. You can see the prices on their website.

For new students, they have an introductory trial offer of $9 for three flex lessons. You have about a 2 week time limit to use them however. This is the option I tried.

**Summary**

Good:

* Usually possible to find a convenient time for your own timezone.
* Lessons are organized
* Japanese native instructors
* Flex lessons are well priced for the convenience
* Usually few students
* Content appears to be organized relative to the JLPT exams
* No English hand-holding

Bad:

* Online slide format is the only option for grammar lessons and most instructors appear to have the same format with very minor variations. If this doesn't suit your learning style, this could be a problem.
* Website and software aren't exactly user friendly but manageable--first session had some difficultly getting my microphone to work correctly.
* The exact slides used in the lesson are never distributed
* No English hand-holding

I would say this is a good transition for learners switching from late beginner to early intermediate material. I think late intermediates probably can learn just fine with self study. It is a bit pricey (but all tutoring is pricey) so it is probably best suited for people living in remote areas or with busy work schedules. You're basically paying for someone to draw up a lesson plan and correct you in real-time. The good part about this is the Japanese is much closer to how natives actually use the language. Some textbooks will have dated materials or focus too much on vocabulary that is not as common.",,False,,t5_2qyls,False,,,True,t3_1aba0x,http://www.reddit.com/r/LearnJapanese/comments/1aba0x/joi_japonincom_online_classes_review/,

ShitsuMonday returning for another helping of mini questions you have  regarding Japanese that may not require an entire submission.

These questions can be anything you want as long as it abides by the subreddit rules, so ask away.

Even if you don't have any questions to ask, hang around and maybe you can answer someone else's question - or perhaps learn something new!
&gt; Remember, シツモンデー is not a free translation service! /r/translator is your go-to place for that.

I've been thinking for a long time already to learn japanese. I never gave it any thought how to do it so I just read the FAQ here earlier and all of the resource for learning are english to japanese.

So my question is aimed for people for whom english isn't their native language. Do you still use the learning material that's recommended in the FAQ? Materials/Methods that are for free and orient towards english users don't bother me at all. But I'm wondering if it's better to get materials, that actually cost, what's oriented towards my native language or is the difficulty not that high that I can use these materials even without english skills similar to a business level because it's not like I know english words and their meanings that are used day to day.

I think it would better to get material like books or similiar in my native language.
One problem is, that I don't know how it's gonna be to learn japanese. I just run through the FAQ and saw the few resources/links for ways of learning. Maybe I'm missing something and I should somehow start in another way. Also I did not look up material before so thats also something I gotta do before I start so I can make myself a picture of what's coming at me",,False,,t5_2qyls,False,,,True,t3_149fih,http://www.reddit.com/r/LearnJapanese/comments/149fih/about_to_start_to_learn_japanese/,

Alright, so to the question. What are your thoughts about full immersion in Japanese? 

For example, if you were to be in a classroom where the teacher would teach you about Japanese in 100% Japanese, do you think that would help improve your understanding and fluency?

Would you have suggestions as to how to improve the lesson if the teacher spoke to you in only Japanese? As in suggestions, I mean something as in constructive criticism that would help reform the lesson to help you fully understand the language?

In an effort to help out people who are new to /r/LearnJapanese, I've decided to spend my 3-day weekend redoing our FAQ.  Since I'm lazy and don't want to write the whole thing myself, I thought it would be easier to get everyone to pitch in a bit.  If you have any of the following you think should make it into the FAQ, post it in the comments (stuff not on the list is totally welcome, too):

*Frequently Asked Questions*

* Questions which are frequently asked (duh), *with links to answers within /r/LearnJapanese which you think were particularly well-written or helpful*.  Feel free to link to something you wrote if you think you did a good job.
* Advice you've received, wish you had received, or have given regarding learning Japanese.  I would prefer a link to an existing post/comment, but if it's just something you want to say, that's cool too.
* Any other specific area where you think the current FAQ could be improved.

*Frequently Requested Stuff*

* Links to websites/software/mobile apps which you like.  Preference will probably be given to ones which don't cost money.
* Books which you like, preferably with a link to Amazon or something.
* Links to JLPT resources.  Since past exams are usually crappy scans on kind of sketchy sites, preference will be given to sites that don't suck, rather than sites which send your password as plain text in the URL (speaking from personal experience).
* Resources available outside of Japan you think people should know about (import bookstores, real-life local classes, etc.)

Things I do not want:

* Questions/answers about the JET program.  I'll probably stick a link to the official page at the end or something, but this is LearnJapanese, not TeachEnglish.  Doing the JET program involves visa applications and other serious business, so I would like people to get their information from official sources, or at least ask individually so they can get more specific answers.
* Rants about how kids these days want us to do their homework, and all ask the same stupid questions, instead of learning kanji uphill in the snow like when you were younger.
* Questions/answers about studying/living/working in Japan.  There are better subreddits for that, like /r/Japan or /r/japanlife.
* Links to illegal content.  No torrents for Japanese game ROMs or anything, please.  People can google that themselves.

Once the new FAQ is put together, I'll put it in the sidebar (and make it stand out a bit more) and make a general announcement.  I may also spruce up the CSS if I have time.

That rules out all of the popular Jump/Sunday lines and common go-to manga like Yotsubato. My first choice right now would be something like 静かなるドン.

I don't know how many of you have studied classical Chinese or Japanese, but a friend and I asked a professor of ours who is an expert in classical Chinese and knows Japanese whether he'd be willing to do a tutorial for us about radicals/etymology from the perspective of both languages. I'm not sure if I'm articulating that properly, but I guess that's because we sort of intend to figure it out as we go along -- essentially, there's a common point between kanji and traditional Chinese characters, and we want to explore the origins and how they've evolved separately and what it means. I know that's a vague comment, ""what it means,"" but yeah. We're just interested in it, in short.

Sooo, my question for you, lovely redditors, is whether you know of any good readings on this that we could include in our syllabus? If it's helpful for you to know, I speak passable Chinese (and read it much better), and my friend knows nothing of Chinese other than our amused comparisons between traditional characters and kanji. However, he is nearly fluent in Japanese.

- Etymology, general
- Etymology, Asian languages (any)
- Etymology, Chinese
- Etymology, Japanese
- Linguistics, general

I just pored through all 31 volumes available right now, &amp; looking for some suggestions for another one to read.

If you don't mind (or enjoy) gratuitous ultraviolence &amp; frequent nudity, you'll be well rewareded with some amazing art, &amp; great stories &amp; characters.

Pros:

- A lot of long action scenes with exceptionally detailed and beautful (or horrific) artwork. Once you've plowed through a dialog-heavy scene and looked up a bunch of words, you get ""rewarded"" by watching a long scene where there are just a lot of visuals or action. Really helps you keep moving forward.
- A lot of suspense and twists leave you wondering ""what happens next,"" encouraging you to keep looking up words &amp; trying to understand difficult sentences even if it seems difficult. You realize early on that the author is not afraid to kill off any character at any time, which keeps the suspense high.
- For the dialogue you get a mix of far-out sci-fi conversations (and vocabulary) which is always fun, but you also get scenes (and vocabulary) that focuses around realistic (and hence practical) situations.

Cons:

- No furigana, so make sure you're using something like jisho.org or a dictionary app on a smartphone that lets you look up unfamiliar kanji really quickly. (I highly recommend using SKIP code rather than by radical.) Still, even without furigana, I found Gantz easier to get through than, say, One Piece.
- Excessive violence and  nudity may turn some people off

I'm currently finishing up a semester abroad in Tokyo.  My Japanese is pretty decent, especially verbally, but we all know how kanji is for non-natives.  And that JLPT is scary.

As such, I'm looking to bring some manga home so I can continue studies in my free time, and you know - enjoy comics.

I've browsed around Reddit and the web, but I keep coming into the same problem; thus, think this thread might be useful for not just me, but others in the future.

Thing is, I am not, at all, near an ""otaku.""  That's not to say I'm not nerdy, I am.  I mean, I'm a Westerner in Japan - so.  But my care for anime / manga culture doesn't go much further than Pokemon, Lupin (new series rocks by the way check it), Panty &amp; Stocking with Garterbelt, Cowboy Bebop, etc.

I am a huge American comics reader (and a huge reader in general); I like my superheroes (mostly DC), but I'm really into more intelligent reads.  Lately things like Saga, Y: The Last Man, Preacher, Ghost World, Hard Boiled, Manhattan Projects, Scott Pilgrim, V, Transmetropolitan, Sandman, Moore's Swamp Thing, Astro City etc. (And as far as more campy traditional superheroes - I'm a Batman guy, through and through)
.

Since I'm more into adult-orientated comics, and these in Japan typically do not have furigana, I'm not really sure where to go.  I've talked to a few Japanese friends and gotten some suggestions, but I will never read One Piece and I just am not into Naruto-esque stuff (sorry guys).

So here goes:
I want manga that a) has furigana and b) is somewhat intellectual / interesting and c) not necessarily lobbied towards your day-to-day otaku.

I figured we could put a list like this together; since I know I'm not the only one out there facing this issue - and the best way to learn language is to read, read, read.

So far, this is what I've got:

火の鳥 (Phoenix)

ベルサイユのばら (The Rose of Versailles)

新世紀エヴァンゲリオン (Neon Genesis Evangelion) 

BECK

名探偵コナン (Case Closed)

Any other suggestions?  ",,False,,t5_2qyls,False,,,True,t3_1iqm0m,http://www.reddit.com/r/LearnJapanese/comments/1iqm0m/manga_suggestions_for_an_american_comics_fan_with/,
1374261193.0,15,self.LearnJapanese,1inenv,A message to beginners or people interested in there first JLPT (lower levels).,23,8,15,http://www.reddit.com/r/LearnJapanese/comments/1inenv/a_message_to_beginners_or_people_interested_in/,"This message is not to discourage anyone from studying Japanese but there are a few harsh truths that need to be told. I've seen countless post here and Google + and facebook in the past few months about becoming fluent in a year or skipping JLPT levels, etc. I have been biting my tongue while reading these posts. If you are new or just started out, please read and THINK about what is being said. I am not fluent by any means (about lower N3), but I have lived in Japan and I have been studying for about 2 years.

First, are you only studying for the JLPT to pass it or are you in it to become fluent? These two seem like the same at first, but they are not. To pass the JLPT (until N2 and N1), you only need to memorize grammar, vocabulary and be decent at listening.  Most people can do this. But what do you get out of this? A piece of paper saying that you passed….great. But can you understand the context of a conversation or hold a conversation? Most likely not. I did this method before living in Japan and it screwed me when I got there because I couldn’t hold a conversation. I was upper N5 at that time. Maybe this is why the tests got harder?

Second, are you in it to become fluent or close to fluent? Honestly, I went in with the attitude that I will master this language in a matter of a few years….I fell on my ass, hard! The JLPT (passing N1)  is just the top of the iceberg in terms of the language, but it gives you a very solid start into the language (I believe college level). This is why most people think the test is a bit of a joke until N2 or N1. Also people who go this way takes classes, are really good at self- studying and/or have a tutor. You get a ton of assets by going this route. You can communicate, understand the language and culture and get a sense of accomplishment. Japanese will be ingrained into your mind by going this route. 

Lastly, I read post after post asking for resources. I’ve compiled as much as I can to help beginners and intermediates. I hope the community can add on to this.

6. You cannot reply to yourself.

7. If someone makes some mistakes, you can correct them (politely)...but you also have to continue the story.  No showing up *just* to correct people.

8. If possible, use kanji with furigana (see the sidebar for a link on how to use the furigana).  If you can't use kanji, then please at least use kana.  Romaji are a last resort.

Of course, there are plenty of proficiency levels we can use  (JLPT, [ILR](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ILR_scale), [Common European Reference Scale](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_European_Framework_of_Reference_for_Languages))  to determine someones level, but which of them would be the most accurate?

It primarily concerns two sections, and its not before I finally understand these points before I can move onto the special expressions section and any help would be greatly appreciated.

First of all concerns using なる Or する with verbs:

海外に行くことになった。

It's been decided that I will go abroad. (lit: It became the event of going abroad.)

毎日、肉を食べるようになった。

It became so that I eat meat everyday. (lit: It became the appearance of eating meat everyday.)

海外に行くことにした。

I decided I will go abroad. (lit: I did toward the event of going abroad.)

毎日、肉を食べるようにする。

I will try to eat meat everyday. (lit: I will do toward the manner of eating meat everyday.)

These are the examples extracted from the site. First of all concerns the usage of koto and you, which I simply can't wrap my head around. Why is you used in the examples they are used , and why is koto used in their examples? What happens if each of the examples change to the opposite, is it a bigger difference in meaning? In other words, I have no idea if I were to construct my own sentence, whether I should be using you or koto.

Secondly, I understand verb + naru, but verb + suru I honestly don't think I even understand. My grammar book gives completely different translations and explains it with ""Ill make sure / I've made sure. Countless examples, countless of trying to understanding this grammar I can only say it as simple I have no idea what it is about. Anyone maybe able to dumb it down like a 5 year old could understand it?

Second part concerns てみる and ようとする.

These constructions seems to me  as nearly identical, and I simply don't get what the difference between these two constructions are. Do they have different usages. I guess in English if someone says. ""This place has some of the best burgers!"" You would say ""Maybe ill try it"" instead of ""Maybe ill attempt it"". 

Then again in English you would say: ""I will attempt to try climb Mount Fuji"" rather than ""I will try to climb Mount Fuji"" where the second statement is a bit more vague and can carry different meanings.

Either way, these two constructions are to me very similar and I'm having a hard time separating when which is used.

I suppose that wasn't ONE favourite but you get the idea. Character and reason, more than one character is allowed. Add some furigana and/or explanation of the character so beginners can join in too.

Knowing your skill level too might be interesting.

I've found this website to be highly effective with increasing my understanding of the songs I am listening to. I'll typically listen to a song I like a couple of times before using the website so I am fairly familiar with the beat and the words spoken (but usually understand only about 10-20% at that point). I will then use this website to go through the song and figure out each expression in the song. I feel like it has been a highly effective way of improving my listening comprehension.

Here is a nice slow song that I've been using lately: [Radwimps - order made](http://www.jpopasia.com/lyrics/7709/radwimps/order-made.html)",,False,,t5_2qyls,True,,,True,t3_a6zjv,http://www.reddit.com/r/LearnJapanese/comments/a6zjv/use_rikkaichan_with_this_website_to_learn/,
