I went to the bar I work at after that. Everyone is giving me some of their shifts so I can get back on my feet faster plus a ton of couches and guest beds to crash on. Also they got me good and wasted.

Yesterday I get a call from my old bar, where I was fired from, and they asked me to come in. Some of the regulars had bought me Target giftcards, bought me dinner, and the bar manager gave me two work shirts and an open tab as well.

We take care of our own and that's why I love the service industry. We're hard, but we care for each other when the time comes to help. 

So to my brothers and sisters that have shared that proverbial shift beer with me after three doubles in a row I say thank you for making this kind of job bearable enough by simply caring for each other.

Started Friday at 6 am.  We kick out breakfast service with no problems.  Good start.  We have a plated banquet for a bar mitzfah at 8:30 pm.  I don't have to tell you how a plated banquet works.  Orders are placed weeks ahead of time so we know how much too make.  We get everything ready and start bringing it out on time, nice and hot.  That's when shit goes wrong.  Half the bastards want a different dish.  Dude you ordered the prime rib, ""Yeah but I want the salmon.""  Our banquet servers fuck up and tell them, Ok I'll bring that right out......   You can guess how that night ended.  Left at 10:30  pm.

Ok, next day.  In at 7 am.  My breakfast crew rocks it.  They usually do, they are awesome.  I stay to wait for my night guy to come in while I look forward to a bbq at my girlfriend's parent's place.  Time comes, time goes.  An hour late, no return calls.  Shit, I am stuck here tonight.  Sorry babe, can't make it.  Oh, and the dishwasher calls out.  So, Saturday night I rock a 250 cover night solo on the line while being my own dish bitch.  I leave at midnight, with the line and pit perfectly cleaned the way I want my guys to do it.  

7 am Sunday morning, my floating guy (am and pm) is scheduled for pantry.  No show.  9 am, dish pit leaves in a hurry citing an unspecified ""family emergency"".  SO, i'm back on dish, and running pantry.  We made it.  I'm going to be doing some serious staffing work this week, needless to say.

I started off working in kitchens as a dishwasher. In case you don't know, dish dog is the low man on the totem pole, but nobody really messes with them, because nobody wants to do that if they quit. I actually liked it. Turn on the music, load up the wrack, dirty dishes in, clean out, wax on, wax off... you get the picture. I would actually use the time to go over my college homework, write paper outlines in my head, and even design D&amp;D worlds, all while my hands were busy. Eventually, I got promoted to prep cook, then line cook, etc... and moved to a bigger, better paying kitchen. I still loved cooking and enjoyed being in the ""zone"" when tickets were flying in and out, food was perfect, and you got to drink a case of beer after work with your line buddies. I was good enough to get promoted to sous chef, and took the job, even though it meant an actual hourly pay cut with more responsibilities.

I was good at this, too. Cut overtime hours in a huge kitchen, streamlined food cost and made sure people took pride in the food and service. I even nutted up and fired the racist, lazy bitch who threw temper tantrums in my kitchen. 6 nights a week, 60+ hours, and I loved it. Things were great, I got a few awards, it was awesome. Then I asked for a raise. ""Sure, its in the works"" was the reply for about 8 months. Then they switched bosses, I started off at square one with the raise. ""Oh, yeah, we're working on it. I have to talk to the guy, and he's only here every 3rd Tuesday"", or some other bullshit. 6 more months of this, then I say ""Look, if you can't get me a raise, take me off salary, and I can at least get overtime."" Done.

So I kept doing the job, even though I made the same pay as the line cooks, but was responsible for the whole kitchen. At least I was making more money. They hire another sous chef, at a salary much higher than my old rate, and I ask if I can get that salary as a sous chef. ""Well, you have to apply for the job,"" which I had been doing for 5 years. ""Fine, I'm no longer a sous chef. Find somebody else to close the kitchen 6 nights a week. I'm paid the same as a line cook, so that's what I'm going to do now.""

Time passes. I am back on the line, still happy, but much wiser. Another new boss, and he starts trying to bully the staff. I, as a former manager, know what is and isn't allowed by company policy. People start coming to me when they question his instructions, I tell them what the actual policy is, and what they can do to counter him. Chef, understandably, doesn't like somebody challenging his authority, but most of the people we work with don't speak english too well, and he is abusing these people in ways that are clearly not allowed in the employee handbook. Stuff like forcing people to use vacation time when they don't want to. Offering overtime early in the week, then cutting it later on. Ignoring time off requests, etc... not stuff you get sued for, but stuff our company frowns upon. My outspoken defiance gets me transfered off the line and into the ""steward"" position. I don't care, company can't cut my pay, and I've got so many years there, I get tons of benefits, plus I no longer work nights. Awesome. Angry that I haven't quit, Chef tries one last thing to get me to quit. Dish room. I couldn't believe it. I was the highest-paid dishwasher in town, never worked a night or Saturday, and nobody ever fucked with me. Chef would come into the dishroom, expecting to see me elbow deep in some shitty, burnt pots. Nope. Everything clean, I'm miles ahead of the workload, and I have a smile on my face. I know it doesn't seem like a dish best served cold, but it felt pretty good to ruin that bully's attempted revenge.

I wanted to offer some of my thoughts and then open up the discussion to you guys on things you think should or can be done to improve the overall quality of the sub.

First I've been a mod for something close to a year now. In that time KC has grown from a 2k plus subscriber base to a nearly 7k plus sub. On our current path, we'll be well past 10k before the summer and will be looking at closer to 25k before the year is out. The ability to build large communities in Reddit never ceases to amaze me.

In March of last year we averaged something like 9k unique pageviews a month. Thanks to a KC post that frontpaged through /r/bestof, we had 235k on February 5th alone. In the 5 days surrounding that front page post we've added 500+ subscribers, or roughly 7% of our current user base. Anytime you add a large influx of subscribers practically overnight, especially ones eager to post and comment, there are bound to be sudden shifts in the culture of the subreddit.

Cheffie and I have always had a handsoff approach to modding the sub. We do our best to keep posts out of the spam filter (and sometimes fail at that, yes) and try to keep real hateful things off the board. If however you want to tell someone complaining about Gluten to fuck off, you are welcome to tell them to fuck off. Others have the right to upvote or downvote you. I've never wanted to specifically direct how the discussion in KC goes, simply because we are all so different in terms of what we do/did. 

One thing that will most likely be happening soon is the addition of another moderator. I'm also considering doing confirmed flair, you would send a picture of yourself in your kitchen next to your mis en place or similar to myself or cheffie, and we'll flair you up with the appropriate title. That way you can begin to differentiate between industry people and ""plebs"" as you all are so fond of calling them.

Naturally anything is on the table, so lets all make some suggestions. Please upvote this for visibility, I receive no karma.

*Gluten-gate* is just part of the reason for the general feeling cooks, and to some extent servers, have for you, our clientele.  Some call it disdain or hatred...but it's really not.  It's more of a dull feeling of mistrust, ingrained in our core after years of dealing with the tiny fraction of you that have, at times, **single-handedly ruined our entire service**.   Like a stray cat that's been mistreated all of its life by the neighborhood kids...I flinch.

But those customers are only a tiny fraction!  Why would I feel this way everyday when such a small percentage cause problems?  Because I serve well over 300 people a day.  Some of my colleagues serve many times that.  Meaning on average the 0.5% of you come in **EVERY DAY**.  I know it's coming, it's just a matter of when.

At the same time though, my main priority is to make you happy.  Know this: it's not just my job or just good for business.  I have it inside of me a deep desire to do so.  I wouldn't call it a talent, more of an instinct.  Or maybe an acceptance of challenge.  I take an immense amount of pride in the process of developing dishes, ordering for them, hiring and training staff, executing and delivering the product you get on the table.  

**This shit is hard.**  It's hard even when things are going *well*.  I'm not sure if you can understand, but it literally feels like a small miracle happened when we close on a smooth, busy night.  Seriously.  And I feel an almost spiritual high just as I would if any other miracle had occurred.  

So there I am, on my way to that high.  Communicating with around 8 people at the same time.  Keeping a count on 30 menu items and 80 tables worth of tickets.  Checking each plate, jumping into whichever station needs a hand...when it happens.

What happens?  It doesn't matter!  Could be anything.  We have all of these things going on and you (not really you) send in something altered or isn't on the menu.   

**Actually, your server sent it in...which is a big source of the friction between the BOH and FOH...but that's a different too-long post.*  

The point is, any disruption of the process is a potential monkey wrench.  The straw that ruined what could have been the miracle I strive for everyday with my team.  People call this the service industry, when it's not.  This is the entertainment industry.  This is our show.  The menu is the program listing what we have to offer.  What gives you the right to come to our show and change our program?  

But remember:  **I sincerely want you to be happy.**  These combined feelings result in an insane inner torment as I simultaneously curse your existence and rack my brain for how I can put a smile on your fat face.  

This is the thing that many people just don't get.  I know because people regularly ask if I or anyone I know has ever gotten pissed and spit in someone's food.

I guarantee the absolute last thing 99.9999% of our industry would do is sabotage your food.  It's our own product for fucks sake and anyone that is capable of doing so is weeded out by the job long before they get a chance.  We know that by all accounts we should want to ruin your day like you did ours, but we don't.  In fact, our own pride or ego or stupidity or whateveryouwanttocallit forces us to put in the extra effort to make sure you're satisfied.  

And that's why when people tell me or any of us that we should lighten up or treat our customers better, we say ***FUCK OFF.***

I recently had such a day; there were rainbows, children skipping down the street, laughter, and even a bunny rabbit. Creepy as fuck, I know, but on that day I decided that I wanted to take my girl out for a nice dinner.


We went to a nice place; although for 30 dollars an entree I'd hope it would be. Normally I have issues going to other restaurants because all I can think about when I sit down is whats going on in the back. My girl is the same way, but her thoughts lean more towards the FOH than the BOH. 



Anyway, we decided to put those feelings aside for one night, and treat ourselves with a nice romantic dinner. She ordered duck confit, steamed veg, and gnocchi. I ordered a braised lamb shank with roasted veg, and au gratin potatoes. We waited a decent amount, before we asked our waitress when the food was going to be served. They weren't busy, only three 2 tops, and a handful of 4 tops, so the kitchen shouldn't have been in the weeds...Either way, we understood, and continued waiting. An hour, and two bottles of wine later, our food was brought to us.


Now, every experienced chef can usually tell from first glance how the food was prepared, and by taste can usually confirm. My first glance suggested something was off. My lamb shank was not braised, but broiled, tough and overcooked, my veg was poached in butter (Nothing wrong with that), and my potatoes were deep fried, and raw. My girlfriend's duck was grilled, and over cooked, and dryer than her sister's vagina at this point...I noticed where the burnt skin was cut off, and grill marks. Her veg was deep fried, and her gnocci was actually pomme de terre sablees (Again nothing wrong with that, that shit is good)...We didn't care that much, but alas our order was very wrong.


So I ask the waitress if the kitchen was weeded out. She said has actually been slow, and ask how my food was. I told her about the mistake, and asked if the kitchen could do anything to fix it. She goes in to the kitchen, and I hear a very loud, very angry, and very annoying yell, ""That's how we serve it! If they don't like it then fuck them!"" 


I'm sort of disappointed, not angry, because I've been in that position, but truth in menu is a legal contract after all. So the waitress comes back out, almost in tears, and tells us that the kitchen would not be able to fix the problem...at which point the FOH manager comes up, and asks us what the problem was. I tell him, and then I ask, politely, if he knew the definitions of the MOP he had put in the menu. He tells me that the new chef had written the menu a week ago. He couldn't offer to comp us because we had taken more than two bites, which is understandable, but again...truth in menu.


So I ask to speak with the chef. Now my rainbows and butterflies are turning into dark clouds, and locusts...My inner chef is begging to come out, but my girlfriend is there, and well...I promised to behave. He came out ready to fight, which caught me off guard a little bit, because Not only is this place not busy, but right now my girl and I are the only ones in the dining room. So I was confused as to were the hostility was coming from.



The chef was a skinny man, very early twenties, wearing his school's chef's whites. Despite his lack of experience, I tried to calm him down, and explain that I was also a chef, and although we weren't upset with the meal, we were upset that it was not what we had ordered. 


He then picks up my plate, and throws it. I know this kid has less than a year's experience, or else he wouldn't be acting so childish, let alone unprofessional. So I look at the FOH manager, and demand that I speak with the owner. This kid decides that the best course of action is to kick me and my girl out of his restaurant claiming they had the right to serve. I'm done with this kid, so I push him out of the way, and make my way to the kitchen. Turns out the oven was on death row, the kitchen was disgusting, and the line was in the back smoking weed and cigs. The lamb shanks were prefabricated, and in vac bags, and all the duck in house was raw....they par cooked it in the fryer than finished on the grill. The veg was scattered all over the place: mostly on the floor. The dish pit was non functional, and the three sink was broken...the dishwasher was using one sink to rinse the plates, and the other with a strong amount of bleach to sanitize. I'm now getting sick...literally. 


Again this kid claiming to be a chef is now just screaming at me, saying that I wouldn't know how to run a kitchen because I apparently have never stepped foot in a kitchen. I now yell in my kitchen voice, ""Pipe the fuck down!"" he shuts up for a nano-second than exclaims I had no right to yell at him. I tell him he's too young to be this far in the weeds experience wise, and an exec or a sous position is obviously too much for him right now. I tell him to relax, and find something more his speed. He doesn't listen and kicks me out of his restaurant by force (pushing, shoving, little love punches). I went back in shortly after, because the waitress still deserved her tip...it wasn't her fault the chef was a little shit.



I honestly felt bad for the kid, because he was obviously in over his head. And by any chance that he's reading this, I hope he understands my point of view. I can be a very mean person, you just so happened to find me on a day off... And if you are reading this, I'm calling your owner as I'm typing this to tell him the state of your kitchen,and your level of skill and profession: if you still have a job after I talk to him, I'll also call the health dept...because my girl and I both got food poisoning. Find a better job suited for you...and relax...Why they hired a culinary student to be an exec is beyond me...you should be doing externships as a pantry boy, or dishwasher...



On the bright side, I made that bunny from the first paragraph my entree spec tonight. Take that happy things, welcome to the thunder dome.



**EDIT** :**TL;DR** dinner on night off, chef was culinary student, ruined dinner, the bunny was delicious, and I still got some...just if you all were wondering if this story had a happy ending...hi-oh!",,False,self,t5_2sa8b,False,,,True,t3_1ahw3n,http://www.reddit.com/r/KitchenConfidential/comments/1ahw3n/relax/,

Yes, we have our differences. We smash, troll, make-fun-of, and commiserate with one-another, but we DID all share one thing in common. We *were* all industry. Because this is KC, we had our fun shitting on the FOH, and then sitting back and laughing as they got butt hurt as usual. And the FOH, in all fairness, took it in stride, and gave it right back to us. But we still had love; we were still in the trenches *together*. And when it comes down to it, there is no FOH and BOH, but one team who works together to exude complete and utter awesomeness. 

But ever since non-industry subs caught onto us, we seem to have a bunch of armchair chefs, servers, GMs, restauranteurs, etc., commenting on the inner workings of our industry as if the actually know what-the-fuck is going on. It's funny how people always want to eat the tasty sausage, but don't really want to know how it's made.

A few days ago, I'm manning the window and notice that we're running low on soup (Green Chili Pork) with no back-up and had planned on making soup that night (Tomato Bisque). Not wanting to run out, I get the ingredients together and run between the line and the soup in the steam kettle. The rush ends and I return to my soup which seems *off*. It's just a little too bland. Good tomato flavor and texture but no real pop. I throw in a little salt and taste it again. It's too fucking salty now! I finish it and throw a potato in, say fuck it and go home while it chills since I was at 11 hours already. I come-in the next day and taste it and it's fucking perfect. *Self high-five*.

Last night, I'm the most senior person working (FOH and BOH, manager included). The two new guys on the line are quick learners and put out some great dishes but they've not been baptized by fire yet and can get into the weeds pretty quickly so I keep an eye on them to help.

It's just crispy fucking shallots.  But holy shit my mind reels at the magnitude of the puto.

So we're doing a big pre-fixe dinner, it's a Big Fucking Deal because it's friends and family and corporate is there so we want everything to be perfect.  In fact it's such a Big Fucking Deal that everyone is also allowed to order off the regular ala carte menu which is another topic entirely about management saying words that don't mean anything.  It ended up not being a problem and going super smooth but we had no idea what to expect going in and were preparing for the worst kind of surprise sex.

So the guy next to me has the fish on the prefixe and there's a crispy shallot garnish that I had made a couple nights ago and still had a couple quarts of.  Chef is like, ""K, start on some shallots.  Watitdew, tell K how to do those shallots like you did the other night.""  So I'm like, word, just keep the fryer at around 220-240 so you get a light golden color and avoid the carryover that will turn them bitter.  And I set K up with the fryer set right and a hotel pan lined with paper towels and I'm really nice about it.  So he starts the first load and checks to see if they're coming out right and I'm like, yeah but you could stand to drop a lot more in there at a time.  Five minutes later he's decided that it's taking too long and just starts putting them in the other fryer that I hadn't turned down from 375 and fairly mangles the entire batch.  I mean, they're not inedible but they're not right and there are a ton of burny bits.  So I'm like, all right, here's the two quarts I have from last night, why don't you use these first?

Later in service I notice that he's serving his shit batch and I'm like, hey where are those two quarts of nice shallots that I gave you?  ""He's like, uh, I don't know, I had them right here on the cutting board,"" and looks in the trash can and kind of shrugs.  I'm kind of baffled and go looking around and find them in the other trash can that he didn't inspect, and they are in there still in the quart containers.  I pull one out and I'm like ""Did you seriously just throw the shallots I made in the garbage?"" and he denies it.  Then like half an hour later out of nowhere he says ""Oh, yeah, I couldn't use those because they didn't have paprika on them.""    O_______________0

And now I have to go in to work next to this clown and try to block out all these horrible thoughts about skinning him alive and turning his hide into a sombrero.

I've been working garde in my kitchen for about 6 months, and I've been trying to get the Chefs to move me to a more advanced station. I haven't been to culinary school, plus this is my first kitchen job. I've been  training on Hot App 1 or 2 times a week on slow days since january. I've been getting tired of not being taken seriously because of my lack of experience. 

The day before St. Paddys is notorious for being our busiest night of the year, because there's a huge parade on the main street (which our restaurant is located on). Everyone had to be in 3 hours early to prep (not to mention I had to park 2 miles away because there was nowhere to park). Right at 2pm the normal Hot App guy came in, and was in a terrible mood. He started yelling and throwing shit and got fired at 3pm. Nobody but the chefs and I knew the station because we recently changed the menu, so it was my big chance to prove I was read to move up. We fucking killed it. 1500 covers, 38K in sales. We sold upwards 350 burgers. I loved every minute of it.

Tonight really reminded me why I love everything about being in the kitchen, and finally I proved I can actually handle a busy night.

tl;dr: Trying to get moved to new station, guy gets fired, take over for him and kill it, got the move I was hoping for. ",,False,self,t5_2sa8b,False,,,True,t3_1agbj3,http://www.reddit.com/r/KitchenConfidential/comments/1agbj3/tonight_reminded_me_why_i_love_working_in_the/,
1360683306.0,85,self.KitchenConfidential,18dpxl,"A bartender's thoughts after the gluten debate and how ""the kitchen should think about the guest.""",116,31,66,http://www.reddit.com/r/KitchenConfidential/comments/18dpxl/a_bartenders_thoughts_after_the_gluten_debate_and/,"Hey there KC!  This is your friendly FOH bartender aka the woman who pours your shift drinks.  After seeing the recent Gluten-phobic table post and the ensuing chaos, I ended up writing my own cheesy spiel on what it means (from my perspective) for the chefs to “Think about the guest” as so many comments suggested for you to do. It's addressed to the theoretical customer and is kind of long but I thought I'd share it anyway. 

&gt;What does it mean to “think about the guest”?  It means having cut/burned/scarred hands and forearms every day from cooking and prepping in a kitchen that can reach temperatures hot enough to seem like a living hell.

&gt;It means dissecting and mutilating a perfectly created dish to suit the special requests, tastes, or allergies of the people eating at the restaurant.

&gt;That server that just fucked up ringing in 2 entrees on your 12 top?  (I know she told you it was the kitchens fault – they can't do anything right back there)  Yea, she's going to grat you and possibly make what the BOH guys make in half a shift.  You think she's going to have to pay for that mistake or thank them when you get the remakes out on the fly?  Doubtful.  But they bust it out in record time because it's for the guests.

&gt;You know what's putting the guest first?  When my KM gets up from his freshly poured shifty because you just came and sat at my bar and you're famished.  No where else is open.  Guess what?  We're not either – but he'll cook you some wings or a sandwich if you like because he's here and you're hungry.

&gt;Hey, BOH, only ten minutes till close?  Awesome!  But what's this!?  Six tickets; all of which are horribly-modified-extra-everything-with-no-upcharges-must-be-employee-food.  But still everything is made with perfection, just in case one of those tickets is for an actual guest.  (It's not.)

&gt;Thinking about the guest is when everyone else gets sent home on a snowy night except the closing me and the owner. You're one of only 6 customers in the restaurant and we're definitely not making a profit at that point, but we stay for an extra hour because you and your friends are hungry and need a place to eat. 

&gt;Now, we all know that “The Customer is always right,” and sometimes that means the customer orders a steak medium rare, but what he REALLY means is medium well.  And that's ok! The grill-master will be happy to cook the perfectly prepared meaty goodness some more for you.  And as your server, I'm sorry again that it was “bloody.”  Why?  Because that's what it means to care about what the guest wants.  

&gt;After a 12 hour shift on the line churning out dish after dish of awesomely prepared and tasty food, it's time for the chef to sit down for a good meal himself.  Just kidding – he spent all of his cooking effort today on you – the guest.  After that level of exhaustion it's beer and snacks all the way.

&gt;But even after all that time and effort the guys and lady in the kitchen spent “thinking about the guest,” they never see it.  You had a great time on your anniversary and the food was wonderful?  Yes – thank ME, the bartender.  Of course I will give my compliments to the chef. (I will forget exactly 30 seconds after you leave) Make sure to leave me a nice tip!  


And that really is the sad thing about it.  As much as customers can drive me completely fucking insane sometimes (especially the dozens of regulars who ALL think they're the most special) – sometimes the people who sit at my bar or at a table I'm serving really do make me enjoy my job.  As much as we ALL hate the people sometimes, I think all of us in the industry really do like to give people an enjoyable experience.  I love making people “the best drink they've ever had” - just as much as my friends on the line love it when people really enjoy their food.  The thing is that sometimes it is really nice to actually see the smile you put on someones face after they've had a great night out.  That's why I care about what the guest wants – because I want to see them have a good time. (and tips obviously) but the people in the back don't even get to be a part of that and they STILL care what the guest wants.  At least where I work, the guys back there feel genuinely bad if something goes out that isn't up to par and they want people to enjoy it.  But you guys never get thanked or praised or make extra for going above what is necessary to “think about the guest.”  So from the FOH to BOH, let me just say thank you on behalf of all the friendly bartenders out front.  Imaginary drinks on me!

We seat 300 when it's cold and 400 when it's warm. Point being, we got a lot of employees and cameras.

So a couple nights ago this guy broke into our building. We don't have a camera on the point of entry he used but, we did get to see him staggering behind the bar using his celly to light up the taps and bottles. He chilled out for about 2 hours just pouring different drinks in the barely lit room at the end of the bar and appeared to be having conversations with himself and/or invisible people and fucking around on his phone.

So at 4:45am the 20 year old naive dish guy shows up with our 22 year veteran line cook to open the place for breakfast. The cook goes into the office to get the notes from last night, the prep/opening lists, and whatever the fuck else it is he does in there. It actually came up watching the tapes, at one point he looks at the prep list and lays back in the chair and stares at the ceiling without moving for 52 seconds (of course we timed it). So while he's fucking around in the office, the dishy walks up the line and sees the drunk guy playing the empty pots in the steam table like a set of bongos and walks by thinking ""Must be a new hire"" and even waves and says ""hey what up?"", walks right on by and continues going about his opening duties like nothing is up.

About 15 minutes later the cook comes out and sees some random shitfaced dude on the saute station with all 12 burners cranked high and a skillet on one of them while holding two handfuls of raw diced chicken. The cook asks him who he is and the guy explains that it's cool and that he knows the owner (he doesn't) while he's slowly dropping those chicken cubes as he talks. So the cook says ""Oh! Ok then, well what do you want? See, I'm the sous chef here and if you know the owner I'll make you whatever you want!"" Later he told us the guy wanted ""a shhhhteak inside of a pancake"", so he said ok, and went to the walk in to gather ingredients/call the cops. 

He then proceeds to sear a sirloin on the hot as fuck skillet and actually pour pancake batter on the motherfucker. He keeps talking the drunk guy up about how he's gonna ""get this motherfucker on the menu!"" He bullshits for another minute or so and the cops walk in the back and take the dumbass without a fight. (we're about 2 blocks from a police station in a small town so they get here fast).

Our grill guy answers some questions, goes over and trims out the edible parts of the shhhteak cake, and starts opening the place up.

1375049511.0,84,self.KitchenConfidential,1j8l88,Thank you r/kitchenconfidential (dodgy date label update),99,15,10,http://www.reddit.com/r/KitchenConfidential/comments/1j8l88/thank_you_rkitchenconfidential_dodgy_date_label/,"[Here is the original thread, in which I have serious concerns about the way my kitchen labels food](http://www.reddit.com/r/KitchenConfidential/comments/1ivpze/just_stressing_a_bit_not_sure_what_to_do/)

So, an update. First of all, thanks to everyone who told me to get my shit together and speak up, and convinced me that this was not normal practice. I managed to get through to my area manager. She listened to me, and the next day I got to work and it seemed like she'd already got involved, though bizarrely not in the areas I'd highlighted. Every one seemed very angry that she had concerns about our food safety, and was doing things like checking we had correctly colour coded chopping boards, but no one mentioned the way we label the food. I kept quiet about what I'd told her.

Anyway, since Thursday I've had a run of an evening shift and then 3 AFD shifts by myself (we're mostly a studenty pub, so summers are quiet enough to just run one chef). On Friday, I sat down to ‘dutifully’ change the date labels, and then I thought back to what some of you guys had said.

I looked at myself, and was angry. Fuck this, I thought. I'm not gonna stand for this any longer. Unfortunately, I'd already changed most of the labels by this point, but I resolved that next time they needed doing, I wouldn't.

Now, recently, the two main forces behind this bad practice left. The general manager has gone on maternity leave, and the kitchen manager has been promoted and moved to a posher pub as assistant manager (would you believe it?). The culture of bad practice however has certainly remained, and the assistant managers and team leaders still enforce the label forging. However, we now have a new stand-in general manager.

At work today, it was just the two of us — him FOH, me in the kitchen. In the short time he's been stand-in manager, I'd always assumed he was part of the dodgy system we have here. But I asked him for a word, and asked him if he knew ‘how the labelling works here’. He said he didn't, which surprised me, but I guess he hasn't taken much notice of the kitchen, despite us being currently without kitchen management. (Unless of course, as my partner has suggested, he did know what was going on but just denied it)

I told him what was going on, and he didn't seem overly shocked, but did sympathise with me. I told him I would no longer be happy to forge date labels. He basically told me to do what I think is right, just to write it down for him.

I took that to heart. However, I didn't go on a mad food-disposal rampage straight away. I decided I wanted to effect positive change, not just cost the pub money by throwing all its food out. I began to compile a sensible labelling guide, based on a mix of manufacturer's guidelines, company policy, and common sense. Part of the problem was that all food was having a 2 day label slapped on, regardless of how long it would actually keep. This meant, of course, that some food which has a shorter shelf life than 2 days was being served when it shouldn't, and that food with a longer shelf life was having its label changed, and goodness knows how many times before it was finally served. I made a list of all food and when it actually needed to be thrown away. Since I'd been on AFD for the last 3 days, I was able to put this list into practice straight away — anything that I knew for a fact that I had opened had its label updated to the correct use-by date.

The manager agreed to laminate and mount my new plan on the wall, and even to buy me a beer for my efforts.

Then, I purged the kitchen. I threw away a total of about 40 individually labelled items (ranging in size from individual portions of some items and entire boxes of others), recording every single one.

Now it is my goal to change the culture in my kitchen. There's one woman who has been working in the same kitchen for 15 years, and has terrible practice. She often serves food even if it has been dropped on the floor. She'll be the hardest to convince, I think.

I'm leaving this job soon, but I intend to leave knowing that kitchen is a safe food preparation area. Whenever a superior asks me to forge date labels, I will refuse, and introduce them to my new plan — most of them aren't actually careless; they've just had the same piss-poor training as me. And whenever a colleague goes to forge a label, I will call them out. I have 7 weeks to try to turn this around before I leave.

This has been a character-building day. It's possibly the first time in my adult working life that I've had to to show moral courage and do the right thing, despite being worried about the consequences. Thankfully, it turned out okay. Today is the proudest I have ever felt after coming home from work, and I thought I'd share it with the guys who inspired me to do it. Thanks.

Edit: **tl;dr**: Told area manager, told temporary manager, he gave me the go-ahead to do what I think is right.

They didn't seem at all shady, and like a legitimate company.

Apparently our credit card transaction company charged us too much in fees and wanted to reimburse us on some of those fees, because fucking shit ton of money. Credit cards are expensive to run, believe it or not. Discover card is about $3 a transaction.

Now we called our POS system (FirstData) customer help line, to find out what our merchant ID was, and told them the situation. We didn't know our merchant ID because we haven't had a need for it, nor had we have we had our POS system for more than a year and a half.

Apparently Merchant Services is a scam company, and not only request your merchant ID for your POS system/credit card transaction machine, but copies of some transaction forms/business financial information, to get credit card numbers.

We had a hunch that something was up when we called the customer help line for our POS system, because we wanted to keep our bases covered, just in case. We were instructed to let our bank know, so they could also alert area businesses.

I thought I would share this with you, in case some of you got calls from this ""company"". I would hate to hear that you guys got scammed one day. I understand that there are people out there trying to scam, but this seemed legit, until we actually called about it.

A server at our place (corporate chain) that was the shift leader of the servers with drawer privileges and all the other stuff was fired because I lady called and was uncomfortable that he touched her shoulder when she was ordering and leaned in because she was talking silently. Its okay, I kind of understand. But it was his first ever warning. She called saturday night and they let him work the first shift of his double on sunday before they fired him. He was a grown man who had a second full-time job there.

But that's not it. There is an older guy who comes in 3-4 times/week at lunch and requests female servers. He touches their asses and sides, 4 different servers, including MY WIFE refuse to serve him. But we still let him in 4 times a week and are expected to serve him.

They fired our team leader server and all around great guy for touching someone's shoulder and leaning too close to them. But this old guy comes in 4 times a week and harasses our servers and the manager still joke around with him and buy him drinks occasionally.

I have worked there for 3 years and I am also considered senior as far as the servers go. I take huge sections, have several 'pins' and bullshit and always get hard sections, drawer privileges , all that stuff. Someone called and said I was rude for saying I would bring a water pitcher right over but I forgot. I got a warning and if I get a second warning I get fired. The stories go on and on and everyone seems to be quitting.

But our GM is a great guy and he is just pressured by the corporate managers who make rules about taking the phone calls seriously, 'guest first always' bullshit. Does anyone else work anywhere where we have absolutely no integrity? If a customer complains about a small human error (taking a bit of time for a cocktail), long ticket times, even other tables bothering them, our restaurant is giving out hundreds and hundreds of dollars of gift cards and free entrees. But they REFUSE to pay servers overtime (from 2.13 to 4.26/hr ON WEEKENDS and leave us short staffed). They don't stick up for us and fire the best team members for one customer complaint in 5 years. And they expect the best out of us with a high turnover and this corporate bullshit.

Normally a busy affair, today the tickets just poured out of the printer. In the middle of rush, the pantry cook walks over to the hotline and calls through the window, ""What does '*A la Mode*' mean?""

The chef doesn't even look up from the flattop and just says, ""It means add ice cream."" It's a pretty straightforward answer to a question that I never imagined a cook asking. The pantry guy heads back to his station, to what we presume is his reach-in full of frozen dairy products.

Three or four minutes later, one of the FOH managers comes running up, tripping balls because they can't find the pantry cook and the tickets are all jumbled up on his printer. The chef looks at the line, then us and says, ""You guys got it."" He heads off to get his butthole plunged on the pantry line.

The other guy and I are left working two stations each, and the boat is slowly sinking. I run out of bay shrimp and run to the freezer to thaw a box. Who do you think I find in the freezer? The goddamned pantry cook, surrounded by at least 30 tubs of ice cream, scrounging for more on the top shelves.

All I can manage to say is, ""What the fuck are you doing?""

He looks up at me and says, ""I can't find the *A la Mode* flavored ice cream. Do you think we are out?""

I wasn't even mad, man. Just flabbergasted.

First, before everyone berates my boss, him and his wife are like my second parents. 

But the story goes as this. 
i have worked my way up the chain of command from salad bitch to exec chef in this small family owned restaurant. I've been through 5 other chefs and countless other employees. 
Until recently we have been doing very well and then my boss's wife was diagnosed with breast cancer last year. many trips and treatments later at Mayo clinic she was deemed cleaned this year in August. Only to have my boss need another knee replacement and could not work the hours he used to as bartender, putting me out front and my sous running the kitchen.
During the last month a rather well to do gentleman has been visiting the restaurant rather frequently and so i found out today, he purchased the building our restaurant was housed in. 
As our lease contract is just about up, he has decided to raise the rent, as well as made a list of demands for our owner to comply with.
Hence, me being told that the restaurant can no long support my salary along with the mandatory raise the state requires.

My boss then told me to go file for unemployment and he wouldnt deny the claim. Yay me. 

I have never seen the man cry before in all my time working there, not even when his father died. But today he did. His wife couldnt even come in to see me she was so upset after talking to payroll department on the new laws.

i could use a cheering up KitchenConfidential

It happened twice tonight. I was already in a bad mood because I was missing some great 4th of July parties but I said I'd work and thats fine. 

The first customer gets the ball rolling. We have 2 locations which run different specials due to demographics; each location will honor each others coupons.  So this one guy walks to the bar and comes to me just fuming. I look at him and ask how can I help you? His reply is to slam the coupon book down and tell me how it is complete bullshit for two stores under the same name to run different specials. My explanation is that there are two different owners that choose to run their own specials. He proceeds to start yelling at me telling me I'm an asshole for not honoring a coupon that says West Side Location only in the eastside location. My response ""Well, If you were to let me finish my sentence before you rudely interrupted and called me names I was going to tell you that we will gladly honor the other stores coupons in most circumstances. But due to the fact that you called me names and instead of asking politely and just resorting to talking to me and my server like lesser people I'm going to refuse to honor it."" He gets really pissed now and tells me how he is calling corporate and going to the other location. Kicker we are not a corporate store there is no corporate number to look up online, plus the other location was closed today.

Cunt bag # 2; this bitch almost cost me my freedom; I almost reached across the bar and slapped her. We have a chalkboard with beer prices on it. Unknown to me there was a misprint on it. Blue Moon was a dollar less than it said in the menu. Ok a minor misunderstanding. Its fine I'm in the process of pulling up her check to apply the discount and here she comes to the bar. I am quoting as verbatim as possible here. ""I have never been so outraged in my life how can you say something is one price and have advertised as another. My response ""I'm sorry people make mistakes I'm working on refunding your dollar."" Her ""DOLLAR? NO WE HAD TWO OF THEM YOU OWE US TWO DOLLARS!"" Me ""OK that is fine, could you please not yell I'm standing right here."" Her ""What? You can't talk to me that way I'm leaving without paying this is an outrage. "" Me You can leave but I will be forced to call the police department."" Her ""Fuck you just give me my fucking check. Me ""Here you go."" Her ""I'm not tipping you a cent and I know the owner and he will be told about your rudeness."" Me looking at the bitches boyfriend after she storms out ""Hey look man I'm sorry that the chalkboard was wrong and you now have to put up with her tonight, but here is the menu and the price is right here."" He looks at it says ""I'm really sorry for her behaviour"" and walks out the door after dropping a 20 on the bar. 

TL;dr People fucking suck.

Call the owner, tell him to find us a fridge, he calls his brother and gets us a fridge, we box everything for him to take over. Fridge guy finally shows up, 5 mins later he comes in the kitchen, who wants the bad news, the compressor is seized, you need a new one, 4 hours to install, if I'm lucky I can get it by 9am, it'll be good to go by 1pm... We have a full restaurant for dinner tomorrow, we're open for lunch, and we don't even know if we'll have a walk-in by 1pm... Fuck me, tomorrows going to be fun.

Tl;dr - walk-in is fucked and so are we, prep list for tomorrow is just a good luck message.

I work in a hotel in a small historical town on the coast.
I have been working here for about 4 years now, started as a kitchen hand and am about 3 months off becoming a qualified chef.
We do mostly fine dining a la carte and weddings/conferences but every summer we open the front balcony up as a cafe to pull in the tourists.

For years we just did average cafe food, the usual caesar salads, steak sandwiches, fish and chips all that crap. We would get so busy over summer and be so under prepared that almost every second table complained about their food. You knew you were sending out shit food but you could do nothing about it.

About 9 months ago the head chef got fired,  The Sous Chef took the top job and the only other full time chef was moving interstate in 3 weeks. The new Head was a school friend of mine, We are both 22 and for 2 months up until we found a new Sous he and I (a second year apprentice at the time) were running the show. After sorting out a Sous and hiring another apprentice we were all ready to shake things up.

The Head Chef and Food and Beverage manager convinced the owners to fork out $50,000 to re-vamp the cafe. Instead of doing crappy cafe food we would do gourmet pizzas and share food with craft beer. We already stocked 35 craft beers by the bottle we just needed a keg set up and a pizza oven.
 I put myself in charge of music, making playlists of soul/funk, jazz, low-fi beats and most importantly lots of Fela Kuti.

First day of the new bar and it is the week end of a music festival held in town, 45,000 people would be coming through the town of about 4,000 people, trail by fire. 
We took double the profit from the previous year and not one complaint about the food. 
After that it was steady all through summer, every week we would look over last years figures and they were at least half what we were making this year and getting busier every week. For the first time we had regular customers, coming back every week.

So now it's autumn, Easter is 2 weeks away, usually our busiest week end of the year along with the music festival and today we took $6,125 in the bar, the most we have made in one day since opening, whilst catering a 150 head wedding on a 37ºC/98ºF day with 2 qualified chefs and 2 apprentices. 
Just thought I would share my story with you as I am so proud of my Head Chef and myself for what we have achieved and for getting through the sweaty fist fucking 12 hour service today.",,False,self,t5_2sa8b,False,,,True,t3_1a0vic,http://www.reddit.com/r/KitchenConfidential/comments/1a0vic/most_profitable_summer_since_before_the_gfc/,

Bricks are made in a uniform size and shape so that the things we build will be sturdy and not topple over.

It was last Thursday and I was working with the other chef, I've only been there a month and he's been there almost a year. His girlfriend recently got out of hospital and he asked me if was ok to finish early. I agreed, as Thursday isn't normally a particularly busy night. Half an hour later I regretted that decision as order after order came pouring through. 

The ticket holder eventually got full up after a while and I had to pile them up on the side. Our spring/summer menu also launched last week and I hadn't had much practice cooking some of the new dishes, and was making mistakes, which added to the delay. There was an hour wait and people were still ordering. The kitchen gradually filled up with clutter, to the point where I would be spending a good couple of minutes looking for a fucking knife. The stress level rose, and every part of me wanted to sit in a corner and cry, or just get changed and go home. It was full on for the good part of 4 hours. Eventually the bar stopped taking food orders, and the assistant manager came in to help me out as best he could. Lots of angry customers and refunds, and I finished the last dish about 45 minutes after the time I normally close down by. The kitchen looked like a bomb site, and we had pretty much run out of clean plates. There was a literal mountain of washing up to do, an hours worth of cleaning, and I had yet to sort out through the date labels.

This was probably the longest, hardest and most stressful shift I have done in my entire life. By the end of it I was pretty much destroyed, I was at the end of my leash and exhausted. As I was leaving, the bar staff all commended me for my effort, and all the stress of the night washed away, and I smiled. A small fire ignited in my heart. I had gone through hell and emerged on the other side. I was battered, bruised and my morale was almost broken, but I had made it. My balls felt huge.

Too long. I am used to being treated poorly, as well as seeing others treated poorly; the verbal abuse from staff, managers, owners, customers. Stuff that would not fly anywhere else. 
   I often forget what the people in this industry put up with until one of my friends that have never worked in a restaurant overhear a work story. I am amazed at how little people know about how shitty people get treated in the restaurant business. I recently scored a new server gig, and found out after 5 days of training, I wouldn't be paid a cent for training. 

   How does the restaurant industry get away with never giving a break? I spend at least 8 hours on my feet, and I am not even allowed to take a 5 minute break....and I know 8 hours is nothing compared to some of you out there. Doubles...with no breaks. Getting yelled at for eating (usually the manager, or owner will sit down and have a nice meal after the rush calms down.)

Having to walk around on slippery bleached floors, with no mats? (One time I called OSHA, because one of the places I worked at didn't have mats. I slipped a few times myself. One of my friends heard the manager say ""too bad he didn't break his arm, then I would get a break from him bitching about the floors). 

No overtime for the kitchen guys? Or anyone.

Getting clocked out without your knowledge?

Not getting paid? 

Underage labor?

Dangerous conditions?

No holiday pay, when you are required to work every holiday?

These are some pretty basic worker's rights denied to restaurant workers. Do we put up with it because we are too drunk, hungover, tired, and complacent from years of hearing ""this is how it is? or ""you just aren't tough enough for this industry? and ""you just need a thicker skin?"" 

Are we too broke to get lawyers, or stand up for ourselves?

I understand no industry is perfect. Most restaurants seem to operate outside labor laws as the status quo, while the owner bitches and moans about how expensive everything is, labor costs, food costs, and cry all the way to their new cars, and expensive houses. While giving shit away to ""VIP,"" then bitching at the busboy for snagging a piece of bread when they haven't eaten in 7 hours and have been busting their ass. 

Had to get it off my chest.
Sorry to rant...that was supposed to be much shorter.

What are your thoughts?

I left myself a pile for the next morning. I come in and it's a pretty quite brunch.

I have been working at this bistro by day wine bar by night place for about 2 years. I came in on the ground floor dish boy and pantry during the day. We eventually evolved into a wine bar with bistro style dishes and more. All of my experience up till the addition of night service had been under the owner (executive chef?) simple things like cooking pasta, blah, blah for day service which is just an extensive brunch menu with wraps and sandwiches, very little cooking other than philly steaks, reuben sandwiches, and burgers. Well after some pleading and really putting my two jewels on the line; I negotiated a 30 day trial period where I would work doubles, day and night service and if I couldn't perform to par I would get my day shifts back if I hadn't been replaced.

My culinary training at this point was nil minus what I learned on the job, and the menu when we started I barely remember, but it was all foods I had only seen on tv, I live in central florida a lil backwoodsy area and came up in the ghetto for the most part so I had very lil exposure to gourmet/bistro food. The first Head/sous chef we had come in, had just finished a tour with the PGA tourney and taught me nothing more than to taste everything, he was very particular about his dish was his dish and no one could do it other than him. . . he ""had"" to leave within a week; ""it wasn't a right fit for him."" 

So now I'm under a 3 week deadline floundering; I need to say cooking, art, and writing are the only things I want to accomplish in life. I was against the wall here. Then we had a saute chef come in selling himself as more and he may have well been. In 2 weeks time he had me tearing through basic books to learn my shit. He even got me a copy of the joy of cooking so old the pages were stiff and yellowing. He taught me people skills like dealing with food reps, took me on every trip to local food distributors and my first trip to a whole foods. Meanwhile my day shift has been filled by a kid from Johnson and Wales. No Pressure right. Then the 4th week arrives and I'm given a simple task, make an app special. I pull panko crusted pan fried scallops out my ass, with creamy Jamaican sauce (I used a jerk blend my parents make at home). It sold out! The owner and her husband both made lil remarks as to that weekend being a test I got a decent raise and we sailed forward with the saute chef for a time approximately 9 months or so. During that time we added a fry station and one more body in the kitchen. We also trimmed and fluffed the menu and started 3 specials motif a catch, butchers, and pasta of the day, in addition to the regular menu. We even began doing monthly 5 course wine and beer dinners. But right before the saute left he made a comment as to me not loving cooking, and it crushed me.

So when our new and current chef got there I was a lil jaded 22 year old prick. But somehow he and our new pastry chef got through to me, they both got me back into the books a CIA The Professional Pastry Chef 3rd ed book and an Italian pizzeria book, Chef taught me how to make mozz and anything else we did. He really took and still is taking time to teach me everything, and stuff that the other guys missed, like basic shit. Like the importance to being early, knowing how many covers are expected, how to use what we have in inventory to make profit, mise en place!!! How can you forget to teach that? Chef did alot to make me better even went to bat for me with the owner who wanted to look for other help. But he didn't tell me that till much later. So we plowed on till recently.

The Main point:
Our kitchen is a grill, 6 burner, flattop, 2 ovens, and salads on one side of the line and a fry station and pizza prep on the other side of the kitchen a bit convoluted I know and we have no pass to boot. I set up a tray jack and some trays and yell for pick up at the end of the line. There is only the two of us on the line me and chef. I work expo salads grill and part of saute, chef works saute and grills on his flat top; and ovens and ticket calls we split. We seat sixty in front of house and seat 50 in the backroom and we are mostly responsible for all catering food that goes out. We have 3rd guy on fry and pizza station but the pizzas cook in our ovens so yea. We had 4th guy hop on the line with us for a few weeks but he only slowed me and chef down. So as of late chef has been pushing me to come up with specials and has me penned for gastro cooking i guess is what its called, bridging flavors in weird ways he's really encouraging me to do more of it like pork medallions over risotto made with apple steeped veggie broth, and served with buttery sauteed apple chunks mixed in. 

Well last night he couldn’t make it to work because a family emergency, and tuesdays been a moderate night for us so I was concerned. The owner said she would be in house but would really be working caterings. I figured I’d get a list of specials from one of them and just run that with the owners help. Not what happened. Tuesdays are my early day to come in wrap up day service and get our prep started.I walk in and I’m excited to see Chef, but he is working all the night prep and says he still has to leave but I need to have specials for him to approve before he does. So I come up with Almond crusted pork loin seasoned with cumin coriander and caraway, and Blackened Orange Citrus Mahi with a blood orange balsamic drizzle, both served with Sesame Honey Carrots. The whole thing went swimmingly! The fry station complimented me for handling the night so well the owner said I have come a long way from where I started. And chef called me late that nite after close as I am pulling into my parking spot to tell me he was proud and happy we were at the point as a brigade that a man down we still produced. I’m crying as I type this. I just wanted to share this with you guys cause I have had my doubts this whole time if I was making the cut or just about to get cut. I hope this encourages someone to stick with cooking.

TLDR; I have been slugging it out with my job to come up to the point where I can run the kitchen sans chef and last night I did and everyone acknowledged it.",,False,self,t5_2sa8b,False,,,True,t3_154716,http://www.reddit.com/r/KitchenConfidential/comments/154716/first_night_running_the_kitchen/,

It was pouring out today around 7ish, the end of a dinner rush. I work in a casual restaurant where you order, and then sit and we bring the food out. I'm in the back prepping a few things when a server comes us and tells me that a lady came in, did not buy anything, and is sitting at a table reading her math book and shaving her arms and neck. In disbelief I walk out to the dining room and sure enough, here she is running a razor down her arms and legs. Other diners were complaining, with good reason. How disgusting. We had to ask her to leave. Her excuse? While never really answering, she asked the time, and said ""oh I'm sorry! I thought it was later, like nine!"" What? How does it being two hours later make it ok to shave your arms in a restaurant! Has anyone had this happen? No one in the kitchen has ever seen something like that.

Pancetta is not cheese. Sorry you're a vegetarian.
The menu says it's spicy. With spicy sausage. It's spicy. Oh, it's spicy and you didn't know that? Christ.
Mousse (dessert). Yes, it has dairy in it, for the most part.
The clams? No they did not come from a nearby lake (WOW). They are relatively local (pac coast, same state) and ...just, what? Lake?
Chicken marsala. Marsala is a wine. You dont' like wine? So sorry.
The salmon tastes like fish. Sorry, next time we'll make it taste like chicken.

Friday nights are the worst because I have to drive through downtown to get home. I end up going to this little Chinese restaurant and chill for a while by myself as traffic dies down.

The staff all know me there and I always order the same thing. However, I started noticing how bafflingly rude people are to the staff there, and how utterly clueless these same customers are when it comes to Americanized Chinese cuisine.

Tonight, for example, a middle-aged couple sat down near me and proceeded to order Wor Won Ton Soup, Orange Chicken, Chow Mein, and Beef and Broccoli. After taking their order, the server went in the back and the couple started arguing back and forth about something. The server came around and they called him back and asked what was in the Wor Won Ton soup. Basically they couldn't eat shrimp, and there were shrimp in their soup. Mind you, it hasn't been made yet. The server said it wasn't a problem and that their soup wouldn't have shrimp in it. The guy got mad and said ""look I don't want you picking shrimp out of the pot. I literally don't want it in the soup period, ever."" The server said ""we're going to make it from scratch and there won't be any shrimp at all."" The guy seemed satisfied with this, and the server walked away. The couple started arguing again and the guy gets up and walks to the kitchen, opens the doors, and pokes his head in. The server comes up and they walk back to the table together. Now he doesn't want the soup at all, then asks the server to describe every type of soup they make and what's in it. In the end, they order egg drop soup. Okay. The guy sits down and the server is about to walk away when the guy says ""oh and cancel the orange chicken."" The server double-checks that they still want their chow mein and beef and broccoli dish, and the assorted chow mein has shrimp in it. ""Of course we don't want the assorted chow mein if it has shrimp!"" the guy shouts. At this point I almost say something but then the server says ""we can put whatever kind of meat you want in it. Pork, beef, chicken - you name it."" They settled on chicken. The server walks in the back, and the guy gets up *again* to say that this has all been way too complicated and that they're leaving. The server says if they'll just be a bit patient their food will be right out. ""No, we're going home."" And they walk out.

So here's my question - these were two totally normal-looking people who have apparently been living under a rock for the last 50 years. As far as I know, just about every human being in America has had Chinese food at least once in their lifetime. How can these people be so ignorant of the most basic dishes? And be rude on top of that??

This sub has made me so much more aware of how people treat the FOH and how infuriating it must be for BOH to deal with constantly-changing orders, and as a civ, I'd just like to say that what you all do is amazing and is appreciated immensely, albeit by the minority of us who aren't complete asshats.",,False,self,t5_2sa8b,False,,,True,t3_19ifo1,http://www.reddit.com/r/KitchenConfidential/comments/19ifo1/notes_from_a_civilian_chinese_restaurant/,

How do you guys do this?,61,7,94,http://www.reddit.com/r/KitchenConfidential/comments/11uka6/i_washed_out_of_the_industry_how_do_you_guys_do/,"I have a degree in economics and philosophy from a big state university. I waited tables, bussed, and did stage's in restaurants throughout college. The stages were a lot of fun and I met some great people. I also cook 7 days a week at home, and would be considered a ""foodie,"" though I dislike that word.

After graduating, I decided to become a cook. I had a good resume and references from my stages and my experiences, so I took a full time job at the restaurant rated highest on US and Yelp for my city. The menu was large, eclectic, and we used a lot of good ingredients.

Two months later, after working 60 hour weeks, missing every single football game that I had tickets to while my wife went, missing every sunday morning with my family because I worked the hellish a-la carte brunch, seeing my wife about 2 hours each week, and making salary of 35,000 after spending 5 years at college, I walked out. I couldn't take it anymore. 

My best friends whom i graduated with work 45 hours a week, party every weekend and have great relationships. They all started at double my salary. They have twice as many benefits. I lost all my friends for my work. I nearly lost my wife. I sat behind a hot grill and fryer cooking foie gras, wagyu, and truffles. Sounds great to the office worker who wants to be a cook, right? Until it's 1 am and you have 2 hours of breaking down your station and you have to be back at 7 am to make 10 gallons of hollandaise for lunch. 

Every idealistic vision I had of kitchens when I was in school and waiting tables was wrong. I idolized the cooks. I thought all I wanted to do was cook. And this was fine dining. We made composed plates with expensive ingredients. This was what every office worker foodie dreams of.

So I dusted off my transcript and c.v. and landed a job as a personal banker. My salary, before commission and bonuses, is the same. Between my wife and I, our benefits and 401k contributions are tenfold what the restaurant was contributing. We have enough benefits and time to actually think about kids. 

The restaurant was just a trap waiting for divorce and alcoholism for me. I was more exhausted after one week of work than I was ever in my life.

The last chef walked out last week and took his whole staff with him. I went in the next day and was hired as the sous chef. The restaurant is beautiful. They remodelled and relaunched it last November. Everything except the kitchen.

The kitchen is clearly pretty old and has not been deep cleaned in who knows how long. There is no organization or standards in place. We already had to throw away a case of chicken, half a case of salmon, and hamachi. I can only imagine what I'm going to find today when I tear apart the walk-ins. 

The menu is another story. This place is below a hotel so we do breakfast lunch and dinner. no big deal, but the menu for each is pretty substantial. There is some crossover but not enough. for dinner right now we have a tapas menu with fourteen items, about 8 appetizer, 7 salads, 10 entrees, and six desserts. the menu isn't very cohesive and customers tend to lean towards the five or six familiar items.

So that's the set up. The owners have told us we have free reign. We have to keep the menu in place until we get settled in. Hire enough staff, get things clean and organized. Then we can do as we please. So kitchenconfidential this marks the beginning of one of the most difficult things I've ever done.

This catering company is located at my local university (which I attend). The restaurant is never open on Sundays, and usually on Sundays we don't have many events (today we just had one 50 person event). So usually, as a dish washer/custodian, I use Sundays to basically deep clean everything and sort all of the flatware and dishes. Also it should be noted that our kitchen doors are about 30 paces from the staff/back entrance to our Universities main ball room were events are generally held. Alright. Now that you have a bit of a background we can get on with the story. Enjoy.

So today was a really fucking slow day. Like holy shit slow. I came in at 10:00 am and started cleaning the areas that usually get skipped over. At around 11:30 am our caterers start trickling in to set up for their event at 12:30 am. That's when Cindy, our lead caterer for the day hits me with some news. There is an event on campus being hosted by an outside catering company. We are not to give them any supplies or let them use our kitchen. This makes sense to me. I don't want someone fucking around in my domain. So I tell her I will not let them use anything or stick around our kitchen, but then shit gets bad.

While I'm mopping I see this lady walk into the kitchen and start chatting up a caterer, Shelly. The lady is asking for ice. Apparently she is the head caterer for the outside company, and they forget to get ice. First off, who the FUCK enters through a doorway that says ""staff only"" and second, who fucking forgets to buy ice for a god damn catered event? Shelly tells her, ""No. We can't give you any ice. We need it for our events, and I am not at liberty to give anything in our kitchen to non staff."" The lady keeps begging her, but Shelly won't budge. The lady then goes and asks another caterer for ice, and then another, and then another, and then me, and then another caterer. We all tell her nope can't do it. Then she proceeds to tell her customers that it is our fault for being out of ice. Fuck this bitch. Fuck her with a god damn cactus soaked in everclear.

Then it only gets worse. This outside catering company forgot to bring carts to carry their food. The lady comes back into our kitchen and starts begging for a cart. We all tell her to basically piss off. However, she notices Andrea (who is late to work) clocking in, so she asks Andrea for a cart. Andrea, being the nice girl she is, lends her one. God dammit. Now she thinks she can get anything she wants from us. The lady comes back asking for ice. We tell her no, and that she needs to get out of our kitchen. She then comes back 15 minutes later asking for fucking bus tubs and ice... again. So we locked our doors so that we could work in peace.

Fuck you for ordering food when you can CLEARLY SEE I had just cleaned up EVERYTHING on my station and JUST put away the tuna.  Now is **not** a good time to order the entree from me.  5, 10, or even 15 minutes ago was the right time.

Fuck YOU for ringing in STUPID tickets.  Actually, sometimes they're pretty funny.  Medium rare chicken entree?  You're an idiot.  Gluten free beet salad?  You're confusing the new guy on pantry.  No green vegetables in the green curry stir fry?  WHAT do you THINK is making the damn curry GREEN!

Fuck **you** for whining about how hard I make your life!  So fucking WHAT if I am using some mustard from your station.  Servers grab bleu cheese from my line all the TIME to fill olives.  I don't care, it's easy to grab more.  You're whining about MUSTARD, when there just so happens to be an ARMY of other people caring about *your* mustard, and only *one* of me to watch my bleu cheese.

FUCK YOU for showing up so GOD DAMN *CHIPPER* in the morning.

Fuck you for ringing in 3 tables at ONCE and then standing by my station, **watching me work**.  Sometimes it makes my hand start to twitch, and honestly, I'm afraid one of these times some dumbass is going to try to ring in all of his tables, and my knife might slip off my cutting board and into their eye socket or between their ribs.  I'm not making the food appear out of thin air, so STOP FUCKING EXPECTING ME TO.

FUCK YOU for working **HALF TO ONE THIRD** as long as I do and STILL make more money than me.

**Fuck you** for then counting said tips on the window in front of my station.

**FUCK YOU** in advance because you're then going to whine about how much money you made, when in fact, it was already more than 150% of my earnings for the night

 FUCK **YOU** for never being able to admit that you're wrong.  You forgot to ring in NO QUESO on the salads for your two vegans, and now telling me to hold the entree?

Why?  I ask in surprise

*Because the salad was made wrong!  He made it wrong!*, you angrily bark at me.  The salads are **right**, YOU just rang the ticket in **wrong**.

**F**U**C**K **Y**O**U** for wearing yoga pants.  It's very distracting.

My rant of the week, feel free to get something off your chest or just commiserate with me.  My owners have 3 restaurants but only 1 and 3 matter for this example.

3's been having big problems since they opened and seem to fire someone every 2 weeks.  I've had the same staff for almost 3 years.  We share a couple employees between restaurants and they needed Jaime (who works the 5 weekdays for Restaurant 1 and  Thursday-Saturday nights for Restaurant 3 ) to pick up Sunday nights as a kitchen manager.  They don't even respect him, think he's weak etc but the Chef apparently can't handle a 6 day work week.  Jaime tells them no, he can't work anymore because he can't get a babysitter and he already works 8 shifts/week minimum.  

They then decide they have no option but to fire him from both restaurants (severely fucking up my schedule).  I saved his ass by convincing my Sunday KM to move to restaurant 3 and my Sous to cover Sundays at Restaurant 1.  I had a verbal agreement that this would be temporary (3 months) until they found someone suited to run Sundays for them.  

5 months later and lots of emailing and stalling back and forth and the owners tell me that they're keeping him because they are still struggling to work the scheduling out over there and it'd be easier for me to just train someone new in.

I have a lot of loyal cooks who have stuck with me through lean years but noone else who can do the KM job correctly.  They expect me to hire someone brand new and promote him past all these people?  Rage coursing through my varicose veins right now....

Answer: a fucking lot of stuff. 

Seriously. Clean the hot top, clean the stove, fill a 6 of brunoise red onion. Pretty much any single task or a part of a task you can get done in the time it takes to load the thing, let it run, flip the door and pull the tray to air dry while everything's hot. Finding new things to do in that little window is a great way to pass the time and get your shit done. Plus the kitchen stays pretty fucking immaculate all day and I can bolt for the door as soon as the evening guy shows.

1349307732.0,55,self.KitchenConfidential,10wkl9,Stage '12: Day 77; or How I Learned To Stop Worrying And Love The Quenelle,58,3,18,http://www.reddit.com/r/KitchenConfidential/comments/10wkl9/stage_12_day_77_or_how_i_learned_to_stop_worrying/,"Just a quick note: left the U.S. on July 18 for London to stage for as long as my money ($10,000 saved up from my last job) holds up. Thanks to a free place to stay with my brother so far so good on the financial front.

So this is the 2.5 month update I guess. In my last two posts I hedged about revealing which restaurants I staged at but then I realized it's really not that big of a deal and besides, I enjoyed them all so no slagging. (I've gone native.)

So far:

* Two weeks at Pied a Terre, 1 Michelin Star French in Fitzrovia; chef Marcus Eaves
* One month at Murano, 1 Michelin Star Italian in Mayfair; chef Angela Hartnett
* Two months and going at Viajante, 1 Michelin Star tasting menu only in Bethnal Green; chef Nuno Mendes

I've also gone in once a week at a butcher's shop in Holborn. It's a traditional English place, very old school.

I'm currently at Viajante and the butcher's, working four days a week at the restaurant and once a week at the shop. Probably something like 60ish hours? All unpaid but of course the butchers send me home with meat and the restaurant hooks me up with 2-3 square meals a day plus staff beer.

I feel like I'm accomplishing exactly what I hoped for. I've worked in kitchens since I was 16 (29 now) and always wondered what it was like in a Michelin kitchen and whether or not I could hack it. I'm confident enough to say that so far, so good. The big difference is precision and quality control. Once you get your mind around that the transition is pretty easy. Spot a discolored herb cress? The stem a bit stringy? Fix it, or don't even bother putting it up on the pass for the plating. Even better, be a maniac with the mise and make sure it never even makes it in. Obviously there's more to it than that but coming from a background where numbers and cover volume was a big issue, and lack of labor a significant factor in what could be accomplished, this is a different world. But it's not a different universe.

I feel privileged to say I learn something every day. It's a surprisingly nice feeling not to have the hammer down on you when you're at work. That's not to say I don't push as much as a guy who's getting paid, but it's different when you're a chef de partie or junior sous or whatever and you gotta get things done no matter what. I have the freedom to move about and get my hands in stations and mise that are completely different from each other. It's liberating because you don't have to think about what's left on your mise that needs work, you get to think about what's left on everybody's mise that needs work. I've sometimes felt, after a length of time has passed, that I know more about someone's station than another chef de partie - who might be responsible for something completely different - would know.

A significant concern of mine was getting put on onions or the equivalent all day. I don't mind, but day after day of that kind of stuff would have sent a clear message that I was viewed as nothing more than free labor. Which I am. That has not been the case, however. Whenever I go into a kitchen for the first time there's been a feeling out period but at the end of the day you're either competent or not. I think I am, so I've gotten to do a lot of things. I was surprised and encouraged by how quickly I was allowed to plate at all three restaurants. I've even run a few stations, either out of necessity or, now, because they have enough confidence in me to do so - with supervision always hovering around the corner of course.

Techniques? Learning a lot of stuff. Simple things that never would have cropped up at the places I've worked for whatever reason, like zesting with the microplane facing up and not down. At first I was like, WTF? But then I realized it's so much more sensible. Big things like quenelles. I knew how to do them, and could do a passable one, but when a Michelin star pastry section gets weeded there's still no room for a shitty quenelle and after just a single day of instruction mine are looking pretty cold blooded. I can crank them out fairly fast, but not nearly as fast as the chef de cuisine who is a total badass that can do two at a time perfectly. I had never used an immersion circulator. Agar clarification? Holy shit, so much better. The list goes on, and it's been something cool every day. There are also days where I shake my head and laugh a bit, like the difficulty a guy had poaching more than two eggs at a time. I understand they need to be perfect, it just amused me he couldn't do it without going through about 5 for every 2. And my god, the fryolator arts are a mysterious one for some of the guys and gals I've met. It's honestly shocked me how often I'll see someone try to ""dry"" fried food on a paper towel. But then I'll see the same guy absolutely destroy whole salmon in a matter of minutes, just tear through the things with brutal efficiency and precision and then I'll laugh because this is such a funny industry.

(I imagine this is what I must look like with chicken, now. One thing about my stint at a butcher's: I can break down poultry with utter ruthlessness.)

My goal right now is to take a holiday in Portugal starting on the 8th, and finish up in London by the end of the year and, through the contacts I've made, find a restaurant in Spain, Germany or a Scandinavian country to stage at until about March or April. If all goes well my budget should support me that far with enough to spare when I come back home to the states. By enough, I mean an amount that won't leave me living like a hobo. Well, maybe a well off hobo.

After that, who knows? But so far it's been everything I could hope for. Also, the Olympics were fucking awesome and I got to see dressage hammered drunk in Greenwich.

Oh and another thing: BOH here gets paid holidays and tip money. Talk about a revelation.

I had a sake and we talked about the restaurant for a while, he insisted that I try two other sakes off the list so I'd have some to recommend (red flag?). He offered me a ride so I wouldnt have to walk alone at night while tipsy, and he ended up driving to a bar near my house instead(red flag take two). 

At the bar, he asked me on a date.  I said it was a bad idea since I work for him and dont want the workplace drama. Boss tried to convince me otherwise by forcefully kissing me and inviting me to go on a three day vacation to the beach with him 
(woah!). I was drunk in an unfamiliar bad neighborhood at 1 am, so I tried to be nice and just get my damned ride home, while still saying 'no way!'. In the cruel light of morning I'm afraid I wasn't straight up enough to solve the problem.

**edit** - thanks so much for the excellent advice everyone, this was a great resource for me. I feel loads better having done something!

I emailed the owner today and told him the story. He responded immediately thanking me for coming to him and promising to handle 'the situation'. He said the company in no way condones this sort of behavior, so I take that to be a good sign that something might actually be done. I'll finish out the weekend shifts I'm already scheduled for (though I am completely willing to walk out if he's being a fool) and then probably quit so I can stop thinking about this. I'll report back this weekend and let you guys know how it all turns out.

Manager was sitting outside meeting with the owner when I got to work today, so I went in through the back and avoided that. the story is that he was let go before dinner today after a meeting last night discussing what happened among the staff, many of whom came out with awkward or inappropriate encounters that they'd had with him. apparently other servers had decided to quit with me if he wasn't fired. he might work another couple shifts (without his manager privileges) while they work out his replacement, but never closing alone again, and no longer than a week. I spoke to the owner who wanted to make sure that I understood what was happening and that I was ok with the guy still being around.

Now I can come here everyday and find great new stories, rants and everything you guys have been posting.  There more you all contribute, the better this community becomes so thanks so much!

We realize that as r/KC grows it requires more attention from the mods. Yet, as our kick ass mod Just_Another_Thought has said in a previously, we believe in having as much of a hands off approach as possible. We will be more diligent in answering mod mail and approving posts that are caught in the spam filter, but it isn't anyone's place to dictate the discussion.  

**Non-industry folks will always be welcome here**

We’re also of the opinion that although r/KC is primarily a place for us in the industry, the civilians should be able to come, lurk and have their (sometimes irritating) say. One of the most compelling aspects of r/KC are the clashing with the clientele, and the opportunity to tell them what we're really thinking.  Haven't we always wanted a place to do that?

That being said, we've edited the side bar and removed the bit about asking us for cooking advice, etc. There are other places on reddit where that is more appropriate.

**Side bar topics, need your help!**

Speaking of the side bar, we’d like to give it an overhaul…mainly adding links to common topics. We meant to do this a while back but the trouble is, there are no “go-to” threads on any topic. At least, none worthy of being linked in the side bar.

We think it would be good to have new official discussions on these topics to be linked. **Threads to end all other threads**, if you will. We’ll make the first couple, but I'd like these to mainly come from you all.

HOWEVER to prevent a flood of these and/or repeats…I ask that you **first propose the thread to us via mod mail.**  Also, it'd be better if it were a topic you knew something about so you could open the conversation.  

When you see these threads **please contribute as much of your related knowledge, opinions, and experiences as you can while upvoting everything you see that you think is useful**.  If done correctly, our side bar could be a great reference for a lot of people out there.

**This should go without saying but...**

Some people seem to be confused about r/KC...thinking its only for the BOH.  Yes it’s called r/*Kitchen*Confidential, but that's just what I named it because I'm such a clever cunt. This has always been for everyone in the industry.  

We've all met our share of dumb shit worthless servers and managers (cooks too by the way), but there are also amazing service pros who are as talented and skilled as anyone in the machine. If you’ve ever worked with one, you know what I’m talking about. **The shitty ones aren't the type to hang out here anyway** so try and keep an open mind about the folks you encounter here.

People who would never miss their flight or a movie or their favorite TV show will start trickling in almost an hour after the reservation is made.

And seriously, why do you have to bullshit us about when you're going to show up?

But anyhow, to suggest that maybe your 30 top would be better served by treating it as 5 tables of six or 2 tables of 8 and 2 tables of seven is seen as anathema even though pretty much any a la carte kitchen in the world isn't even equipped to have 40 covers worth of food at the pass at one time.

1371080748.0,48,self.KitchenConfidential,1g8dih,"I HATE special order cakes, also maybe you have some advice",58,10,46,http://www.reddit.com/r/KitchenConfidential/comments/1g8dih/i_hate_special_order_cakes_also_maybe_you_have/,"I need to rant, sorry. I bake at this almost 40 year old restaurant. We sell like 40-140 orders of dessert a day, so I have to make a ton of cakes and pies and cookies and puddings and who knows what else every day. I also make our gluten free bread, gluten free pizza dough for a restaurant, all of our in-house syrups for drinks, lemonade, OJ, peanut butter, and I now do brunch on the weekends as well. I love it, I'm always busy, I'm not complaining. I love making desserts. I love making cakes now too, even though I used to hate it. I like making a pretty cake with hella layers and tasty perfect frosting and filling so that people can eat a piece and go 'oh yum, that's good cake. great'. I, in theory, love making a customer their own cake, just for them, to take home and maybe share with their friends, maybe for a birthday, sure why not. They're happy, it's easy enough to bang a cake out in a day or two, extra money for the restaurant.

What I do not not not not love, is taking the orders over the phone. I have to drop what I'm doing and run out of the kitchen and all the way to the front of the restaurant to take these calls, and then the reception is cruddy in the kitchen so I'm stuck standing out in the front of house while my stuff on 4 burners and 2 ovens is all burning and my timers are all going off, and the second I try to run back and check, the reception starts cutting out and I have to hear the customer going 'oh um... hello? hello? are you there?' etc. 

And then, oh, oh crap, the conversations I have to have. We have our special order menu posted online. We have paper copies at the front of the restaurant. It's all very simple, and all the information is there. But whenever anybody calls, they want to be talked through this crap like it's a one-on-one extraspecial wedding cake consultation. 

ANYWAY MY QUESTION IS THIS: how can I possibly streamline this process? I'd like it to be entirely through email, or have the servers able to take the orders. I do not not NOT want to have to talk to these people over the phone at ALL.  We already have an oversimplified menu with all options (vegan, gluten free) clearly offered, prices laid out, couldn't be easier... how can I force these guys to check out the menu and not have to drop what I'm doing to talk on the phone. That is what I need to know. Imagine somebody saying the word 'cake' as slowly and tentatively and questioningly as possible 40 times a day over the phone until you hate the word and it no longer makes sense. 

The rest is an example of the conversations I have every day, and not even exaggerated. You can tl;dr if you like, but here it is.

""Hi! Oh! Um,... hello? Is this the baker! Oh hi, hahahaha! Oh I could barely hear you! Hi! My name is... first name... last name. And I was interested in talking about ordering a cake? I'd like a cake for... Saturday? Is that too late notice? Are you sure? Can you please do it Saturday? Oh, your desserts are SO GOOD and I just KNEW I wanted a cake from you oh you will? You'll do it? Oh good!'

""what kind of cake do you want. shit! my marconas!""

""Um... what kind of cakes do you have?""

""we have... sigh... chocolate...? white? lemon, does lemon sound good? chocolate white lemon and carrot are the ones on the menu?""

""Oh! oh carrot, that sounds great. I'd love a carrot cake. It's for my friend Stacy, up in Lompoc? She's coming in to town on Saturday. Well, haha, sorry, she's coming in on Friday? But we'd like the cake for Saturday. She loves your carrot cake. Can you make it vegan?""

""Yes.""

""If it's vegan will it be dry? We have 30 people coming and one is vegan, and I want everybody to be able to have a piece but I don't want it to be dry.""

""It won't be dry, no.""

""Will it taste like a regular carrot cake?""

""I have 4 timers all going off at the same time and all the bread dough I have going back there is just rising out of control right now. It will taste good, and it will taste like a carrot cake, but it is what it is, and it's vegan.""

""Oh.""

""...""

""What about gluten free, can it be gluten free instead?""

""What? Um, yes, I can do that. Not vegan?""

""Can it be both? Will it be dry?""

""It will be different.""

""Ok, vegan... gluten free... carrot cake.""

""k. vanilla frosting?""

""Oh, no frosting.""

""no frosting?""

""we want it to be lighter, I was hoping to do just like, a layer of jam?""

""a carrot cake with jam on it?""

""yes. do you think that'll be good?""

""... do... you?""

""I mean, you're the professional""

""I think I would stick with frosting.""

""Could you frost it with ... the jam?""

""I... would recommend against doing that.""

It's relatively busy on most week nights, but crazy on weekends. Basically, last night was very busy and turned out to be one of those nights where I was being pulled in every direction all at once. Every station needed prep, so I was in back prepping pretty much everything for everyone, and getting yelled at because one person or another felt his or her task was a higher priority and should be done first.

I tend to work from dinner shift through the late shift, and the transition from the dinner menu to the late night menu is always a total clusterfuck. Things get put away that should remain out for late night service, so when late night service begins, it's a scramble to get the things I need all prepped up again. So last night it was the usual story, only much, much busier than I have seen since I started working there. Between only one other cook and myself, we cleared almost 50 covers in less than an hour in spite of our setbacks.

After all was said and done, feeling beaten and battered, one of the servers says ""nice job tonight, man, you killed it"". That small recognition essentially made up for all of the night's previous trials and tribulations. Before I started working in this business, I didn't realize what a big difference that could make.

They've been doing this for so long they have a special price that never changes. Today they came in, it was still really busy. They were next in line to order, but I see her caressing the side of his face looking worried. She asks if he's having a seizure, and he nods, his face doing all kinds of weird tics and twitches. I get a coworker to call 911 and she somehow gets him to a seat. For about 2 minutes, nothing really happened and he stayed sitting up. I though it might have just been a small seizure. Then suddenly he starts convulsing and sliding down in the booth as other customers run to help. She's standing helpless on the other side, reaching for him, and she just cries out in the most heartwrenching way, ""Oh, what am I going to do!"" She sounded so lost and in pain. So that's where I started crying. All of our customers were wonderful and helped him get to the floor without hitting his head (he's tall and stocky, so this took like 8 people). First response arrives quickly, but can't really deal with this situation and just stabalizes him and waits for the real medics. He's on his side, and there are several customers running back and forth, getting napkins, and wiping the blood from his nose and spit and whatnot. Those customers are awesome people. The restaurant has fallen into chaos, as the guy in the floor is blocking the main way and blocking off the cash registers. Luckily none of our customers were assholes about it.  
Finally real medics get there, in less than 10 minutes. The guy is coming around a little. The sweet old lady has been standing by his side, looking lost and terrified this whole time. She finally snaps back and starts answering the medics' questions. Then she stands next to my register while they do their thing. She looks at me and says, ""I'm so sorry, you guys are so busy."" What? That doesn't even matter! Oh god, poor lady. I hold her hand and tell her that I'm so sorry and then I start rambling about how we were wondering about them since they hadn't been in in awhile and how they were like family (it's a family owned restaurant with very very little staff turnover, so all the regulars are like family). She's just tearing up and telling me that he's had seizures before but hadn't had one in a long time. I get the feeling he lives with her because he needs someone to take care of him, and they only have each other. They've never come in with anyone else. So fucking sad. Eventually they get him on a stretcher and out.  
So now I'm sitting at home, letting it all out on reddit to help me feel better. My brain decided to make me think about mother's day, and how she could be spending it in a hospital or planning her son's funeral. So I've had a good cry and started on the rum. Thank you for all of you that have made it through my wall of text. I apologize, I'm a little upset and my thoughts are disorganized. What I'm really looking for are similar stories.

1349700063.0,47,self.KitchenConfidential,114v8k,Drunken rant from a line cook; a memoir.,58,11,36,http://www.reddit.com/r/KitchenConfidential/comments/114v8k/drunken_rant_from_a_line_cook_a_memoir/,"Ugh, this is a dumb idea, but I've got so much going through my fucking head, I felt like ranting at someone. Decided KC would be the best place to go, where I know I'll get an equal number of thumbs ups and fuck yous. Which is why I love you guys.

Shit, this all started when earlier tonight, I got a call from my old cooks, they were all hanging out together, drunk as shit, dicking around, partying and such... And they were begging me to come back. Apparently their new lead cook is a piece of shit, their hours are harder, their ticket times are shit, and the boss has come down on them harder than ever before. Gotta say, I considered it. I even talked with the boss, and he agreed to match what I'm making now...

That's what's so fucking crazy about this business. I could go back to a job where I'd be making a decent wage, and be a fucking stud while doing it. I respectfully declined. I'd rather be making what I am now, while being at the fucking bottom of the totem pole, and being shat on constantly, day in and day out. If it could be described as bitch work, it's my responsibility. I work pantry, and I feel like even if I kick ass, I consider myself lucky if I don't get bitched at for SOMETHING. Compliments or recognition are out of the fucking question.  

For context, I came from a high-volume restaurant. The name doesn't matter, it could essentially be called ""Sysco: The Restaurant"". I'm sure plenty of you have worked/are working in such a place. But I could serve 200-400 people in the rush *alone*, by MY FUCKING SELF. Sure, I hated the world for awhile afterward. But you can't shake the badass feeling of, ""Fuck yeah, I just pulled that off""

Fast forward to where I am now, I'm in fine dining. Everything is prepared a la minute, and I've been fucking floundering since I've been here, which is about 8 months. The other cooks hated my fucking guts when I first came here, because, I'll be honest, I had an ego. I was the lead cook at a big ass chain restaurant. I was trusted by the boss to be able to do the work of three cooks. I got more hours, and got higher pay. And that was because, unlike the other cooks, I didn't do it for the money. Somewhere in my head I thought that going through this bullshit would get me somewhere in my career. It didn't. It meant shit when I got to where I am now. But I sure as shit take my war stories from that place with pride.... 

Three words... Superbowl. Sunday. Brunch. When both my prep-cook AND my fry-cook no-showed on me? Fuck that, I wanted to show them what a pro could do. After that, it became effortless. ""Oh, it's a busy night? *LAUGH.* Give me your worst."" 

And there I stayed. That was my fucking problem, I stagnated. I stopped learning. Sure, I could rock 30 tickets at once, but that was just frying and grilling shit. Now, I'm preparing specifically prepared dishes a la minute, and plating them exactly how the chef wants. Fucking Christ that was an adjustment. I couldn't tell you how many dishes got sent back because they weren't pretty enough, and all the while I'm thinking, ""Shit, all I had to do before was cook shit, throw it  in a basket and throw it in the window.""

I've gotten better, I like to think that if I keep at this, one day I'll get back to that point where the other cooks look at me like I'm a fucking god. But I'd be fucking lying if it didn't get discouraging sometimes. 

I guess this turned into more of a drunken rant than a memoir... But eh... Fuck it, and fuck you guys. &lt;3

Edit: I guess the moral of the story is, if you're kicking ass at what you're doing, then you're not learning anything, and need to move your ass to something more challenging. The job I'm at now, I curse and bless it every day, because pretty much as soon as I become comfortable with my station, and my prep becomes routine, they change shit up on me. Apparently starting in a week or two, I'll not only be in charge of pantry as I have been, I'll be taking over fry station on top of it. I'm nervous as hell, but at the same time, I know I can do it, so I say... Bring. It. The. Fuck.

1368317331.0,47,self.KitchenConfidential,1e5nlv,I don't know what I was expecting...,82,35,135,http://www.reddit.com/r/KitchenConfidential/comments/1e5nlv/i_dont_know_what_i_was_expecting/,"Today I did something entirely stupid, and waded neck deep into the clusterfuck that is /r/cooking.

The premise of my post was pretty simple - when making scrambled eggs, the addition of milk does not have the purported benefits that are generally associated with doing so. And beyond that, the dilution of egg flavor is a drawback. Scrambled eggs should consist of eggs, salt, pepper, with butter being used on the pan. I also argued that the only reason for the addition of milk was that milk is cheaper than eggs - evidenced by the fact that as far as I can tell, pre-depression era recipes do not include milk (or water, as used in the military and some modern recipes). Careme and and Escoffier do not include milk while it was readily available to them. 

So, my question is this: what culinary purpose does milk serve in a scrambled egg recipe? Do the benefits outweigh the drawbacks? Can the supposed benefits be replicated via technique as opposed to additional ingredients without sacrificing the intensity of flavor? 

Bonus content, the greatest response to a comment I have ever received:

&gt;Adding milk to eggs makes a world of difference. The reason for this is the same reason why Mayonnaise is made with BOILING HOT WATER. It doesn't take a genius to figure out why this is. If you genuinely believe that adding milk or water to eggs merely waters them down then I would have to assert that you are missing out on a quality plate of scrambled eggs. Please stop spreading your ignorance. 

Edit - more favorite quotes:

&gt; you sound more like a scientist than a chef, theorizing rather than doing.

I had heard many things about opening a restaurant from my friends at my catering job, so I knew it would be interesting...  
  
About nine months later we're closing early on some weeknights, sending our dishwasher home early, and can't get people in the door on a Friday night with a buy one/get one free special (granted, it's spring break in our town, but it's been like this...)  
  
A couple months ago, right after launching the new Spring menu, we lost our chef in a dramatic scene that also took out the entire morning crew. The sous chef was already leaving for other reasons.  
  
The junior sous chef was in charge for a bit with one of the saute cooks. Junior sous left (hadn't gotten any raises, not paid for overtime, etc.), so then it was just two of the saute cooks in charge. One of the 'promoted' saute cooks returned to being just a line cook. So we have one former saute cook running our kitchen.  
  
There are only three cooks left from opening: myself and two grill guys.   
  
It's a completely different restaurant now. When I was hired I was told there would be order and the schedules would always be the same. It worked and it was glorious. I kind of think our chef was doing good, but now that he's gone it seems the cool thing to do to say how bad he was at everything.  
Now the schedules are constantly changing and I've gone from almost never closing (who needs the salad girl after eight or nine, anyway?) to closing four out of five nights.  
  
I'm going to stick around though, because I can't jump ship. As far as  my experience goes, nobody wants to hire somebody with six months of baby in the works. Also, It's kind of morbidly interesting to watch the restaurant die. So I'm chugging away making salads and desserts for a couple more months because my station needs me.   
  
Do you all have fun stories of dying restaurants? I'd love to hear them. :)",,False,self,t5_2sa8b,False,,,True,t3_1bszoa,http://www.reddit.com/r/KitchenConfidential/comments/1bszoa/what_its_like_working_in_a_sinking_restaurant/,

1361495199.0,46,self.KitchenConfidential,18zpbl,What's the craziest thing you've seen make staff walk out?,47,1,38,http://www.reddit.com/r/KitchenConfidential/comments/18zpbl/whats_the_craziest_thing_youve_seen_make_staff/,"I'll start.  Was working at a ""Belgian Tavern"" style place with a huge beer list and a huge menu that was completely a la carte, ie choose one of ten meats, choose one of twenty sauces, etc.  Anyway, that bane of any kitchen, Restaurant Week came by and it was time to kick some ass.   The executive chef was one of the owners/partners and was a real piece of work:  bad alcoholic (threatened to fire me one night if I didn't hang out and help kill a keg of Delerium Tremens), only worked one day on the line per week, show up out of nowhere during the rush and just start fucking the whole flow up, etc.  The Chef de Cuisine was another matter, though:  tough but extremely competent, creative, would hop on any station that was lagging.  The kind of guy who inspired you and you *wanted* to work for him.  

Chef de Cuisine (hereafter known as CdC) was given the restaurant week menu to develop and he had his name on it.  One of the items was a Paella which CdC was known for in town due to his previous position and he had a following, so people came in literally to eat that Paella (it was pretty banging).  Well we got slammed but kicked ass throughout the weekend and along comes Monday which is CdC's day off.  Now, this was usually a day of discounted mussels and Exec was for some stupid reason expecting to just get a bunch of mussels orders all night like usual.  

Little did I know CdC and Exec had been arguing for some time and things were not going well between then at that point.  So anyway, we get a bunch of product in on Monday and go about our normal prep.  Meat and fish fab was usually CdC or Exec's job, but Exec pretty much doesn't even show up until we start serving.  I got dude's station all setup in addition to my prep and whatnot and he assured me he would get to the meats (I was on meats and sauces).  So he shows up at service half-lit already and we are getting slammed on the RW menu.  He notices that he's running down on the pre-prepped Paella rice in the middle of the shit and DECIDES TO MAKE SOME FUCKING JASMINE RICE AND ADD IT TO THE OLD.  We had Bomba, but he didn't fucking feel like it.  I know this is completely fucked, but what am I gonna say to the guy who threatened to fire me for not drinking with him all night?  This is where I begin to imagine the conversation with CdC the next day and start forming explanations.

So anyway, I start running down on salmon and I'm getting my ass kicked so he decides he'll fab some salmon in the middle of our rush (which turned out to the busiest night on record for the place).  So dude goes and grabs CdC's 12"" Shun and slices into the side of salmon.  Don't you know it's still got the backbone on it and he CHIPS THE EVERLOVING FUCK OUT THE SHUN.  LIKE JUST KEEPS TRYING TO GET THROUGH THE BONE.  The knife now has like three massive chunks missing from it.  AND HE FUCKING PUTS IT BACK INTO CDC'S KNIFE ROLL WITH NARY A NOTE OR ANYTHING.  Oh, did I mention that he was disappearing now and then, probably to blow lines, and drinking heavily on the line? 

So next day comes and I get there and CdC is standing by a prep table with a fish flat of fucked up rice FUMING.  Asks me what went on the night before.  I tell him the whole story:  record night, the jasmine rice, Exec generally being a fucknut.  And then I say something like ""promise not to kill me, but I need to show you something"" and show him the knife.  At this point dude absolutely explodes, and he's like 6'5"", beefy, tattooed, into hardcore and shit.  Starts looking around the place for Exec, but exec is nowhere to be found.  Don't you know Exec LITERALLY AVOIDS THE RESTAURANT FOR DAYS BECAUSE HE KNOWS CDC IS GOING TO GIVE HIS NOTICE.  Finally I come in one day and one of the salad girls isn't there (usually two) and the one who showed up doesn't speak a lick of English and my Spanish is not so hot at the time.  Two other guys on the line didn't show and Chef de Cuisine makes his ultimatum:  if he didn't see Exec by 3:30, he was walking out.  Well, don't ya know 3:30 comes along and Chef de Cuisine walks the fuck out.

Aftermath:  Exec showed up but eventually disappeared during the rush and I ended up running the kitchen with two other people, one who knew a little English, and got slammed as hell.  WE FUCKING KILLED IT.  NOT A SINGLE COMPLAINT ALL NIGHT.  Not least because FOH was super understanding and paced their orders, big ups to those in FOH who have a heart and give a shit.  I put in my notice the next day because CdC was the only thing keeping me there.

Does this really help business when they have zero experience?,66,20,111,http://www.reddit.com/r/KitchenConfidential/comments/1i0t1w/wtf_is_up_with_only_hiring_female_bartenders_does/,"We just moved to a new area. I looked up some gigs on Craigslist, and wound up in the bar district. I need work, and it was the right time of day, so i decided to canvas the area. My wife had the day off, and came along to keep my company. It never ceases to amaze me how fucked aspects of this business are. I hand over my résumé, with 15 years experience (4.5 behind the bar), and watch while my wife is offered a bartending gig, with zero restaurant experience. This happened a few times (we went to a ton of places).

 She was shocked that managers/ owners care so little about skills, and experience. I smiled and told her that this is what it's like in this industry. 

I've been working in restaurants/ bars for 15 years. One of the most frustrating things in this industry is having the experience, and skills, and getting passed over for the bar because I have a penis. 

Personally, I don't give a shit who serves me a drink. If I wanted to see a piece of ass, or a exposed breasts, I would go to a strip club. I want a drink. I might want a bar tender to crack jokes with. 9 times out of 10 when you try to talk to a female bartender they act like you're trying to pick them up, and they never know shit about sports. The female bar tenders I've worked with, are just shitty to guys. 

Some of the posts were specifically for bar tenders, and I wish the fuckers would at least put it in their CL post, that they only hire chicks, instead of getting guys in there to waste their time. 

It's also frustrating serving at places that do this shit. Having to tip out someone that sucks at their job, and knowing you can't get promoted to the bar. What a crock of shit. 

Just had to get that off my chest...thanks.

He's a sous chef of a busy hotel kitchen. Evenings and weekends mandatory, monday and tuesday off. Weekends he goes in for about 9am, and comes home at around 10 pm. Long days for him, and exhausting.

Currently I'm 35 weeks into a complicated pregnancy with a 2 year old at home. I'm no longer able to keep up with the 2 year old for the entire weekend on my own from wake up til after bedtime. I just cant physically do it. I'm concerned for both my health and the baby's. I need help. 

How could your wife approach you with this problem? I know he cant stop working weekends, and I'm guessing asking if he could cut back hours would be impossible, especially as his jr sous just quit? What adjustments are reasonable to ask of a chef in this situation. I dont want to stress him out or ask for things that just wont work...

1371409463.0,44,self.KitchenConfidential,1ggv2f,O DEAR GOD HOW I HATE WORKING BRUNCH!!!,53,9,35,http://www.reddit.com/r/KitchenConfidential/comments/1ggv2f/o_dear_god_how_i_hate_working_brunch/,"First of all I hate getting up early.  That's one reason I'm a cook in the first place.  Doesn't help that I close Saturday nights, and after a busy Sat rush I can't just go to sleep, it takes me a few hours to unwind.  So if I'm lucky I'm home and asleep by 1am, to get up at six-ish, to be at work by seven.  More often I'm up til two or later, and struggle to get up in time to be there by 8.  (Technically I'm not scheduled until 8:30, but as KM I pretty much set my own hours)

If I'm lucky I won't have a fryer to clean, and the corned beef hash will already be made.  Those are the two most time consuming PITA chores I have to do for brunch.  Most Sundays, I have to do both.  Even so, setting up isn't so bad.  I'm the only one here until a half hour before we open, unless the owner rolls through for a bit, but he never bugs me.

But then it starts.  We open at 10, which is when the other cook/dw shows up.  And more often than not we get busy right away.  Now, I work in a tiny, cramped phone booth of a kitchen.  We have a six burner; in the back left corner is the poached egg pot, the other two burners have a range-top griddle for french toast and the like.  So I have three burners for shit like eggs and hash and so on and so forth. Which is just lovely when we keep getting big parties(in the context of where I work, that means 5 or more) who all want omelettes and hash and eggs and scrambles etc etc etc, and suddenly I need 15 burners and pans all at once.

Of course, most of that stuff can be banged out pretty quick, and I'm halfway decent at timing and pacing everything.  We're not a family joint, we serve booze, and most people are content to have a drink or two and wait a little longer than they would at the local greasy spoon.  Our food is WAY better than that, and worth the wait.

The worst part tho is the servers.  We have, bar none, the WORST FOH crew I've ever had to work with.  The communication is terrible, one server has been there longer than me and still doesn't know a damn thing about our menu.  Always forgets to ask what toast they want, always offers HF or fruit with dishes that don't get it, and keeps giving me tickets with items we don't have.  ""What do you mean we don't have feta?  Since when?""  ""Since TWO FUCKING YEARS AGO WHEN WE CHANGED THE MENU YOU STUPID FUCKING TWAT!!!""  And all it takes is one little screw up to monkeywrench the whole operation.

Plus they love to ticket-stack.  I have watched them, with my own eyes, take a table's order, then take the ticket back behind the bar, rather than to the kitchen, so they can wait for more tables to order so they can run two or three tickets in at once.  So it might be ten or more minutes between order being taken and us seeing it in the kitchen.  Or they'll just ignore tables that are ready to order.  Of course, getting multiple tickets all at once is much more of a PITA than one at a time, but they don't give a damn how their actions affect the kitchen or their customers.  And then they have the nerve to complain about how long a ticket is taking, or why one ticket came out before the other one, etc.  Oh, plus we have no POS system, all tix are handwritten, so god help you if a server has bad handwriting.

Then there's this crew of regulars, most of whom work or spend a lot of time at another local bar.  Their head bartender is buddies and golf partner with our owner, and him and his crew- usually ten or more people- like to show up in the last hour of service and order a bunch of crap with crazy mods.  And he is a loud, obnoxious, foul-mouthed bore.  He yells and curses and think's he's being the coolest guy in the room, completely oblivious to the other patrons who are trying to quietly enjoy a nice brunch.  And he loves to come up with crazy orders just to see if we can pull it off.  French dip panini with over easy eggs IN the panini?  Dick.  This stuff is really annoying from laypeople, it's infuriating coming from industry people who know better.  Lucky for me we see less of them lately due to golf season.

And then, because we've got more stuff on, it's WAY hotter in their than during regular dinner service.  So I spend four insane chaotic hours trying desperately to churn out food fast enough without over or undercooking anything.  Because people are fucking PICKY about their breakfast.  Miss the temp on your burger or steak?  They probably won't even notice if it's close.  Mess up those OE eggs or poached mediums?  HELL TO PAY!

So now I'm exhausted, overheated, hungry, and could cheerfully strangle most of our FOH crew.  With a smile on my face, whistling a jaunty tune.  The one thing that keeps me from exploding is, almost every time I come out of the kitchen, someone stops me to tell me how much they LOVED their food, how it was the best benny/omelette/whatever they've ever had.  Plus we got really good drinks when I get off at 2.

So that's my rant for the day, just needed to vent a little bit.  Any other KC folks hate brunch as much as I do, or is it just me? /rant

Yesterday was my first day back. Had a stage at a place that isn't open yet for a sous position. Went petty well. Nothing out of the ordinary.

Got hit by a car on my bike on the way in and broke a finger, still went in. I was greeted by the owner.

They love to socialize (like any good server should!) yet this doesn't equate to pushing food through the window.

My restaurant recently opened a fast-food style fishbar to compliment our bit of the waterfront. The menu is simple- fried food and tacos on the grill. Most of the line guys cook there once a week for shits-and-giggles, and some of the less than outstanding servers have been ""exiled"" there as cashiers. 

It's worth noting that my place is casual-fine to exquisite-fine dining. The kind of place that accepts button-up shirts in the bar and requires guests to wear a jacket for dining room service. Most of the cooks here have been sous chefs or leads elsewhere, and we are pretty dialed into our jobs. 

We like to call a shift at the fishbar ""Easy money"" even on high volume days- The menu is only 7 items long and none of us are new cooks.

Well the GM decided that, since we could do the job so easily, he might as well save salary costs and pay servers to do it instead. The only catch is that it's now up to me and the Sous to train servers to cook, and it physically can't be done.

Don't get me wrong, hard-working servers tend to have a fairly good memory and amazing people skills, but these don't transfer to experience working in the kitchen, even if it's just fry food.

The sous chef when I started left for a couple of years and came back about 12 months ago as a casual (mostly breakfast/conference food and prep work). A lot has changed since he left, the standard and style of food has changed dramatically (from traditional french to modern/fusion/molecular) and he struggles to keep up.
Though I am an apprentice I am basically one step bellow the current sous chef as I know the menus and the kitchen back to front.
So the old sous chef has been giving me a lot of attitude over the last 6 months. Saying ""Yes Chef"" when I ask him to do something, bitching to other employees about me bossing him around. 
During a wedding service one night I asked him to portion the balotine (he was standing around doing nothing 5 minutes before go time) he said ""I don't take orders from you"" 30 seconds later the head chef told him to portion the balotine. 
I have tried talking to him and he was apologetic and understanding (He is a really good bloke in general) but he is still giving me attitude.

So I'm an 18 year old female who is just beginning my very first job in the food industry as a dishwasher/prep cook. I am the only girl in the kitchen. I've only been there for about 4 days and I already have one of the chefs hitting on me. He's 22 and I first thought he was being really friendly and welcoming, but now he makes me a little uncomfortable.

He calls me ""pretty girl"" instead of my name, and when he walks behind me he will put both his hands on my hips (it's a really small kitchen, long and narrow). The other day I was cutting up some pickles and he did it again, put his hands on both my hips, but this time he thrusted himself into me in a very uncomfortable way, if you know what I mean. I ended up cutting my hand slightly because of the shock of what he did.

This isn't normal, is it? I don't want to seem like a whiner because I kind of expected this kind of behavior in an all-male kitchen but it makes me really uncomfortable. I'm a really awkward person and I'm not good with confrontations, I don't know how to get him to stop without being rude or make him less friendly towards me, because I really appreciate the help and conversation he offers.

The grease trap under the flat-top was chock full with a chemical cleaner/water solution. And worst of all about an hour into the shift I notice a half pan on top of the fridge. Hmmm, whats that? Oh, eight fucking beef tenderloins. Toss em right? Nope, we were serving them no more than an hour later after they sat out for 12+ hours. Can't remember what temp the guy asked for but I was cringing. 

Then later for dinner, I toss out turkey that is slimy, discolored and smells like feet. What does he say to me? ""Hey man, you gotta check with me before throwing that shit out, I was just using that turkey and it seemed fine."" Nope, it's not fine, it's fucking disgusting, and every day I work here I am more hesitant to ever want to eat here off the clock.

1373819391.0,41,self.KitchenConfidential,1ia5lv,Do's and Don'ts of posting an ad on craigslist,48,7,19,http://www.reddit.com/r/KitchenConfidential/comments/1ia5lv/dos_and_donts_of_posting_an_ad_on_craigslist/,"I posted this in my local craigslist a few days ago, and I thought I'd share here too.  Feel free to ad your own tips.  

Dear restaurant owners and operators, I have been browsing this section off and on for the last few years, and over that time I have noticed some things. I've heard many people complain that good help is hard to find, but let me tell you that a good ad is even more scarce. Here are a few pointers:

1. Include the name of your restaurant and its location. Most people want to know where they are applying to before they send out their resume, especially in a small area such as this. Name any restaurant from here to Boston and most restaurant employees can either name someone they know that works there or tell you about the last time they ate there. 

2. If you do not feel comfortable including your restaurant's name, at least give people a general idea of where it is. I can't tell you how many times I've seen an ad that simply lists the location as RI. I know it's a small state, but there is still a huge difference between Newport and Woonsocket. 

3. Be descriptive. Don't post an ad that simply says ""busy restaurant in Prov seeks cook."" Tell me about your place, and what you're looking for. 

4. ""Seeking an individual with experience working grill, saute, fry, and garde manger. Must be able to work independently. Starting pay is $10/hr."" If you want quality help, then you're going to have to pay for it. 

5. While we're on the subject of money, a line like ""compensation TBD"" means that I know you're going to try to talk me down to as low as I can possibly go, and ""Students welcome"" means that the pay is either pitifully low, or nonexistent. 

6. I can't pay my rent with valuable job experience, so you can't pay me with it. Don't get me wrong, I love what I do, but I also love having a roof over my head and gas in my car. You are on glue if you think that any cook out there is passionate enough about cooking to disagree with me on those points. 

7. DO NOT POST AN AD WITH ALL CAPS AND NO PUNCTUATION IT WILL MAKE ME WONDER ABOUT THE MENTAL STATUS OF THE PERSON I COULD POTENTIALLY BE WORKING FOR AND I READ IT AS IF YOURE SHOUTING AT ME.

8. Seriously, don't do that. 

9. Know the difference between a sous chef and a prep cook, and if you're looking for one, don't advertise for the other. 

10. Get back to people on time. Listen, I know that running a restaurant is a very time consuming and exhausting job, but this is 2013 and everyone except for my grandma has a smartphone. There is no reason why anyone should go three weeks without checking an e-mail, especially when you included that e-mail address in the contact info.",,False,self,t5_2sa8b,False,,,True,t3_1ia5lv,http://www.reddit.com/r/KitchenConfidential/comments/1ia5lv/dos_and_donts_of_posting_an_ad_on_craigslist/,

I was just so curious how difficult it can be. How bad it can really be.

I walked into the local brewery and got a job as a dishwasher. Had two interviews, killed them both. Started work two days after first showing up at the door. I got the hang of it pretty quickly. I thought, ""It's fucking dish washing, it's not gonna be that difficult"". By the end of the first day I was doing prep work as the prep cook filled in on the line. There was some talk of putting ME, the dishwasher, on the line because they were getting slammed (tourist season had just picked up that week). I eventually had to stop prepping the green beans and get back to washing dishes. 

The lunch rush ends, I go home. Show up bright and early the next day and repeat. The following day, Friday, I was to work the night shift. I show up in the prep and dishwashing trailer to see the prep cook leaving. There was no prep/appetizer person to work with me. I had to make the pizza dough, salsa, dressings, roasted garlic, etc, prepare and run the appetizers out to the customers (all 200 of them), and wash their dishes.

The rush comes and I stay ontop of everything. The place was packed because there was a folk festival in town that weekend. Most of the diners are Texans with big appetites. They order everything on the menu and make a mess of whatever they eat. I get them there appetizers and clean their plates until the kitchen closes. That's where I get pissed off. I realize that the line is exhausting, you guys had a particularly difficult night, and I'm the new lowly dishbitch, but don't walk out on me the minute printer stops.

I do not know how to close up. The prep cook asked you guys to help me out and said that they would be around cleaning out their kitchen. It was pretty clear that they had to clean out their own kitchen, but when that printer stopped I was the one cleaning piles of dishes they neglected to give to me for cleaning during service, scrubbing their counter tops, and figuring out how to clean out the fryer (I had some random server teach me how to do that). After I scrubbed everything in their kitchen and gathered the dishes into my kitchen to be cleaned I was exhausted. It was 11pm (kitchen closed at 9:15) and I had been running around like crazy since I showed up at noon. I was tired, hungry, and a little more tired. I had five piles at about shoulder height of dishes filled with everything needed to run a service. I just stared at it for a minute and decided that I did not want to do this.

For $7.00 an hour I was running three jobs with two days training on one job, assuming the cleaning responsibilities for myself and 3 line cooks, and I had to wake up in the morning and do it all over again. Looking at the pile of dishes I thought about what my note will say. I was thinking about, ""Fuck this, I quit"" or ""This is bullshit, I quit"". That would portray me as scared and weak. I was thinking about making a list of reasons why this is ridiculous, but I didn't feel like explaining myself to them. I don't want them to know why I quit. I eventually went with:

"" *I QUIT*

*this is not worth minimum wage*

*don't call me, mail me the check ""*

I really am not up to the snuff. I have a lot of respect for all of you now. I'm not tough enough to be a chef. I don't have the energy.",,False,self,t5_2sa8b,False,,,True,t3_1g18tq,http://www.reddit.com/r/KitchenConfidential/comments/1g18tq/dipping_my_toes_into_the_kiddy_pool/,

edit: to be accurate, this was not actually in third person.

There is a dude at my restaurant who does brunch. He is in his late sixties, early seventies, I think, grew up in the deep South as a black guy and spent time in prison for drug use and still carries the emotional baggage from those events. He also has to walk with a cane or supporting himself on surfaces like the stoves or counters due to chronic hip pain, and can't really bend over without a lot of pain. He is extremely short with waitstaff and has a history of abruptly ceasing communication with people for years at a time. He will decide one day that he doesn't like somebody and just stop talking to them. This includes not responding to direct questions like ""Hey, I'm placing an order with the fish company because I heard you say we were out of salmon. How much salmon should I order?"" and safety calls like 'behind you', 'corner', etc. The reasons he has for 'the silent treatment' run the gamut from 'I don't like that new manager, she looks like a girly-girl', 'I don't like that server anymore because she had the audacity to not like my constant unwanted touchings ten years ago', to 'they taught the pastry chef to work the brunch station because I requested a day off, so now I hate her'. In addition the man is not a fantastic cook. He once had a pancake special, and cooked all the pancakes off ahead of time to microwave to order. He can't control the heat in his pans and sends out order after order of scraped-off-the-pan trout filets etc and sees nothing wrong with that. He can't cook an egg without browning it and thinks that the proper way to poach an egg is in 2 ounces of water in a small nonstick pan. He can't really carry or lift anything without dropping it.

Pastry chef came on a year ago. She was hired to replace the former baker of 20 years as well as for her mixed experience with kitchen management, admin work, every line station, front of house and alternative diets. Once she got settled into the bakery, after a few months, she started suggesting changes. She noticed the chicken breasts we were selling for $5 were COSTING us almost $4.50 and we're now ordering some at less than a third of that cost. She noticed our lemonade, orange juice, chutney, flavor syrups, and soy milk would be better and infinitely cheaper if made in house and began doing them herself. She looked through sales reports and pointed out the specials that sold abysmally and we took them off the menu. She began providing bread and desserts to other restaurants in town and bringing in extra money. All said and done, she is probably saving the restaurant close to 30,000 a year. She can make 120 pieces of dessert (cakes, pies, cookies, etc to go in a display case) in 6 hours and still have time to cost out the menu. 

The brunch fellow decided one day to stop talking to her, including safety calls etc. He will also have loud English conversations with his co-workers who do not really speak English about how shitty it is to work with 'people who think they run the world', 'snotty people who don't know what they're doing', etc. This is driving her nuts, slowly, because she is the first recipient in close to 15 years of his 'silent treatments' to have to work in close proximity to him, in the kitchen. She feels her work is being actively devalued and that he is antagonizing her. We as a restaurant can tell that she is at the end of her rope with this guy, but we don't really fire people here, ever, and we are afraid he may pull the race card if he is let go. 

What options is everybody left with?

Ok, so I, leviticus11 am the pastry chef. I'm trying to put this all out there neutrally for the best responses, but oh my gooooooood this guy has been buggin' me for almost a year now. He's run into me with hot trays so many times and the only reason it didn't burn me is because he's so damn slow that by the time he got to me they'd cooled a little.

I just learned we are about to lose our best, coolest three servers as well (school, moving, etc), leaving a FNG, an idiot, and a pathological liar/know-it-all.  And a recent change-up in the line has left one of our best cooks in a seriously bad mood.

This normally wouldn't be *too* bad, but chef is one of those guys that channels all the stress in the restaurant through his soul and directs it straight back at his employees like a fucking cannon.  And with graduation month coming up, ooooh man.....

I've been job hunting recently, and it's actually going well; I am pretty sure I have a job I like; I like the crew, the food is good, all awesome. I'm still wrapping up other interviews and pre-scheduled stages elsewhere, but this spot? I'm for it. But. I don't actually know if I have the job there or not. I came in first for a sit down interview, and scheduled a stage. Came in for the stage, stayed for a shift, and then got a call asking for a second, shorter stage, just so the Chef could work alongside me for a bit (she liked what the Sous saw on the first one I guess, but wanted to get her own impression). So now I've been in three times, and the chef asks me to come in for 2 shifts, still to be considered interview, but paid now, since I've already given them a lot of hours. I schedule those in around my stages elsewhere; the second was last night.

So at this point I'm kinda WTFing, and broaching the subject with other employees as gently as possible. Apparently the owner just kinda does this, and I should be pretty confident about having the job. Except for that one guy who came in like 5 times &lt;.&lt; 

So I tell the chef that I ""Just want to check where/how to record my hours so far"" (since I'm not in the POS machine yet) and ask her ""when I should come in next"" (not if, subtle hint there &lt;.&lt;). I get back a message saying that chef would ""Like to consider me for the position"", and asking me to come in today.

Which I will do, happily, and I remain excited about this job (I really do like the folks, and the food, and socially I got along great with the Chef, and respect her skills a lot... just maybe more in food than, say, management...), this is getting majorly stressful, as I kinda sorta desperately need this job (or to go on actively pursuing others...).

I guess this is actually all venting. I am theoretically getting paid, so it's not just some chef milking free labor out of stagieres (and I have seen that happen enough times), and by all accounts a lot of the other employees went through a similar rigamarole, but... oy veh.

&lt;/Rant&gt;

It took me years to realize that when chefs shout out what sounded like ""samadj!"" before an order they're actually saying ""ca marche"" except that's not really it either because I don't know how to make the squiggly c in ascii.

Anyway, long story short: I was in London for five months staging. It was planned to be six months so I could hang with my brother for Christmas. Turns out the UK government wasn't down with that so they shortened my stay by a month. Cue Paris. I got here two days ago with little notice and really no idea where to stage except for an outside shot at Astrance.

Not so long story short: not gonna happen.

So what now? I do some Google-fu. It yields a lot of hits, but keep this in mind: the French 35 hour work week limits many restaurants to 5 and even 4 days of operation! At least that's what I've gathered. So it's actually pretty fucking hard to figure out a spot to stage at when not only are places closed Sunday-Monday and maybe more, but a lot of shops are on holiday for like two weeks! WTF? Chaining smoking left bankers, right? Just kidding. Sort of.

I end up visiting a cool little spot: tasting menu only, young crowd, vibrant - read: graffiti - neighborhood, Michelin star and rising, etc. Except they're full on stages so they direct me next door, to the newly opened sister restaurant that does only small plates. The chef there instantly asks what I'm doing tomorrow night. My initial thought is, due to his eagerness/hopefullness, they are in the shits.

So I show up at the agreed time and, yes, they are in the shits. They are down a man and I am working the line, somehow pulling fish duty. Kinda. Not really fish duty but not the meat station either. Anyway I show up and they're like, ""Oh yeah, by the way, you'll be cooking these seven dishes tonight. We don't have any mise en place sheets, but you're prepped out,"" the last four words being the worst four words in the English language but these froggies don't give a fuck. Also when the chef told me the night before that everyone speaks English, it's true, but it's the way I speak Spanish. Which is to say, not enough for my tastes.

So that's it. When I ask, pre-service, if they takes reservations or if this is walk in only they tell me they take reservations. So I casually ask how many covers tonight? The manager makes a sort of horizontal slashing motion which to me means, ""Night before our holidays man, we're empty, fuck yeah let's drink!"" but to him means ""We're full."" So yeah, there's that. Also, Saturday.

The whole time I'm trying to be a nice stage and keep asking anyone if they need help with their mise. Everyone seems to run out of stuff for me to do fairly quick, which is fucking unsettling. So because I'm actually working a station I go through every single thing in my fridges and area trying to figure out what's what. I'm gonna get shown everything on the first fire, aka when the rush hits probably. At this point I've figured out that ""behind"" in French is not actually ""derriere"" but ""chaud"" aka ""hot"" so I got that going for me.

The first 30 minutes of service is predictably chaotic as they try to show me how to cook and plate these seven dishes as they're rung in, also establishing a total ad hoc expo system by letting me highlight my dishes, which of course are not only written in French but short handed and spelled wrong sometimes. The calls are in French. I ""oui!"" dutifully but cannot even figure out how to get an all day. Before I know it the entire restaurant is full and the tickets are piled two deep and I don't even know where the sizzle plates are.

But everything got better. It was a lot of fun, actually. You could kind of see a communal sigh as I got the hang of it and just zeroed in on my dishes. They definitely put me on the easier side of the line as most of my tickets needed very little a la minute heating (scallops, razor clams, oysters, squid, mushrooms and a carrot veloute; the only one that needed time was something called courge which was a kind of squash). After a while I forgot I was in Paris and just assembled my mise and added heat to things in the order the chef wanted it. That's it.

I got to work stations in London but obviously everyone - except maybe the Spanish guys - spoke English. It was pretty intimidating the first time but I got the hang of it. This was such a profoundly different experience. It could've gone tits up at any moment. I'm not saying this place was Michelin level, it was not. The food itself is not very complicated, but it's good, and the produce and ingredients are good. (And I got to learn techniques too, like how to open an oyster through the side and not at the hinge so you don't damage the belly. The chef used a turning knife and I imagine if I could see my face it would've been a gnarled up WTF expression but holy shit it works.) More importantly it reminded me that fundamentals see you through the day. If I hadn't shoved my nose into every nook and cranny trying to figure out what exactly was in my fridges before service I would've been such a burden mid-rush to my co-workers, who were also getting slammed. I got a couple of ""Don't worry, we'll help you during service"" answers during the day so of course the first thing I did was ignore them and exhaustively catalog what I could. I may not have the proper perspective on this because we of course drank afterwards aka an hour ago but one fundamental I stand behind is learning how to unfuck yourself.

So yeah, anyway, hope you all have a Merry fucking Christmas! I know I will because those guys just gifted me a whole suckling roast pig. And they (I) said the French sucked!

First job after I graduated college, meant to compliment some more classes, etc.  First ever restaurant industry job for me.  Owner was an ex-board person of a major food chain, etc etc.  Spent 12 hours interviewing with his people, the GM, and then him.  Got sent home from that interview when he told me I looked like I couldn't even carry a tray full of plates (I'm quite lanky).  He told me to write him an essay on why he should hire me.  I did; he did.  

Fast forward to now - place has unfortunately been a joke for awhile.  Food started off shit, has gotten better but still just mostly frozen stuff we get from vendors.  I was hired as a busboy, ended up being promoted to a manager with check-writing/safe access/keys/etc authority over the last few months.  I went from working 6-8 hour weeks in the beginning to 50 hour weeks.  As time has gone on, owners have stopped showing up most days, usually only for a few hours around dinner time.  They put me on every day to open but just let me clock in as a bus boy (which I was alright with, they bumped my hourly a bit).  Mon-Sat I would open as bus boy, host, and functionally, manager.  I got manager pay only Sunday nights.  

Paychecks stopped coming on time about 3 months ago.  Suppliers stopped delivering except for COD around the same time.  Last month has been very depressing - numerous people have quit.  Bosses rarely come or call.  I finally took it upon myself to book all of our private parties as my bosses would never call them back if I passed it on to them.  I'm technically FOH, but emotionally BOH also.  I'm in pretty good with all the cooks and our executive chef.  He and I were talking last week and guessed August 1st would be the last day.  This morning, I overheard him telling a cook we wouldn't be doing Sunday brunch tomorrow, which is our main draw still.  Right after that, a call came in for a 30 person rez for brunch tomorrow, I figured this might be the end so I put her on hold and got the chef.  ""Sorry ma'am, we have a 600 person catering tomorrow so we need all the staff and will be closed.""  I knew that was it.  Chef looked at me as if to confirm - we were both okay with it.  Both frustrated with the direction the owners have led us.  Chef knows his cooking isn't up to par, also.  

Fast forward to my clock-out at 5pm today.  Owner shows up, asks if I've been paid my 2nd most recent paycheck yet.  I haven't, he gives me cash.  Calls me into the office and tells me to lock the door.  Says he's closing after dinner service tonight.  Thanks me for my help, admits I helped us carry on even when he was not present.  ""Not bad for your first time."" (He's been in the industry, for better or for worse, for about 40 years).  He said he'd send out an email at midnight tonight.  Until then, only myself, him , the chef and the GM knew.  

KC, never posted on here before, but have truly enjoyed being a member of your society in the online and physical world, even in as fucked up a place as I was in.  No regrets.  Going to enjoy my first Sunday off in nearly 2 years tomorrow.  Monday, time to find new work.

Me: WHAT?!?!  How the fuck did that happen. 

BT: I dunno, should we pour water on it?

I am, as most are, too overworked to have actual friends to whom I could rant. And then I found you guys &lt;3

May I start by stating I was hired to bartend at a $$ family restaurant. I am actually a waitress. There is no management. Just the owner and his wife. He runs the kitchen, she the dining room. I genuinely like the owners and I wanted to help their restaurant expand. There were and still are A LOT of problems that prevent this restaurant from having a single smooth dinner service. I wanted to help, because I thought I could. I forget how petty servers are. Iccckth! Anyways.. I began their bar inventory, created the display, properly trained the staff, and created sidework sheets, and that was the biggest deal of them all. After all this, I have to deal with my tips being pooled with other servers who give bad to mediocre service on a slow night. It's been rough, but like I said, I thought I was investing-not wasting- my time.

It's slowly dawned on me that one of the servers has been whispering in the owners wife's ear for quite a while. I believe she's responsible for 2other staff firings -- which did happen because of her hear-say. I also believe she's been stealing from the register we all use. 40-60 bucks a night. I don't like her. I don't hide it. I still give her tables refills. She tells the boss -get this- I've been ringing up drinks, settling checks, and pocketing the cash. And that's why the drawer is short.


I am the only positive face in that restaurant. I have worked 3 months with 6 off days. I do every job - bartend, waiting tables, hosting, bussing, dishwasher, and rarely cook. I am there every day. She was fired and rehired and now pushing the owners wife to make her GM. She couldn't make a kamikaze shot (she said she had been 'bartendering for years in a college town,' didn't know what an amaretto sour was, never completes her sidework (she hides it, actually), and the icing is the fact that she approaches every table with ''whatcha drinkin'' instead of a proper greeting and introduction. Not to mention her pettiness and need for gossip. 

I'm not a shmooser. I like to work hard. I can't afford NOT to work that double, considering I'm about to be jobless.

End rant. Thank you. I can sleep now.

Edit :: I thought I was going to get fired because I overheard what she was saying to boss lady, she told me herself that boss lady believed I was stealing, boss lady asked her if she had any friends who serve, boss lady said she needed to make schedule changes for next week because of 'waitress mistake,' and my boss lady has a certain look and acts a certain way when she's about to fire someone. Don't know if it matters, but it's an Asian style restaurant and the owners are Korean and very expressive.

Edit Edit :: My state is one of those anything goes states when it comes to termination. Unless...

Update :: I decided to turn in my two weeks and pursue a lead one of my regulars gave me jobwise. I have caused quite a stir, as I do pull in more tips and higher check averages than the others. We have it documented in Excell. The servers have all expressed their happiness at having more tips now than before without me. Saying things like, ""I'm glad you're working tonight, people tipped shit on day shift."". Yes it is time to move on.

1336543513.0,35,self.KitchenConfidential,teb6e,"KC, I just got fired for defending a fellow line cook, one that I don't even like. Make me feel better. ",42,7,44,http://www.reddit.com/r/KitchenConfidential/comments/teb6e/kc_i_just_got_fired_for_defending_a_fellow_line/,"Background: We have a waitress who consistently orders her shift meal within 20 minutes of close. This happens several times a week. 

Last Wednesday, we completed all of our tickets around 930, the place was empty by 10. We close at 11. Well, this waitress decides to wait until 1045 to order her meal, after sitting around in an empty restaurant for 45 minutes and with full knowledge that we were closing down. Not just that, also a shift meal with several substitutions. Obviously, I was pissed, but made her meal. The pantry girl decided to call her out on the bullshit.

Now, this pantry girl, is mostly useless. She tries harder than most people, I'll give her that, and this is her first kitchen job. But she is the fucking slowest at prepping her mise en place, slow during service, slow during closing. I usually close two stations and she closes her own. She can't follow directions or recipes, doesn't have common sense, poor math skills (multiplying recipes), mediocre knife skills, horrible communication (never says ""behind"" or ""hot""), the list goes on. So, for the first few weeks I tried to coach her and teach her things, but she is either too stupid or too stubborn to actually listen to advice. I honestly did my best to help the girl. But, after no change, I finally got sick of her and wanted her out of the kitchen. So I've been trying to break her. 

Anyways, back to the story, this pantry girl goes out into the dining room, after the server already has her meal, and tells her it's bullshit that she always orders so late and too cut that shit out. So the waitress runs to the owners and tells them what happened, so they come to the kitchen to see what the fuck happened. I was in charge (Chef's night off), and of course at this moment the pantry girl disappeared, so I discussed it with the owners. They said servers are free to order at any time the kitchen was open, and since we were still open, we needed to make the food. I very politely explained that we had made the food, no one told the server we wouldn't make it, and that it was simply frustrating to get late tickets from our own staff, especially when they had plenty of opportunity to order at other times. 

Fast forward to now. I get called into the office at the end of my shift. The owners explain that *obviously* things haven't been working out, that I'm just not meshing well, and it's time to part ways. They hinted towards the late order fiasco, and I reminded them that I said nothing to the server, and that I did nothing more than state my observations when asked about the situation. One of the owners said ""It's the story that wasn't being told that tells the whole story"". I don't even know what that means. I was dazed by the whole scenario so I just walked out. 

The chef followed me to my car and said that he had no control over it, and that it was just thrown in his lap this morning. He offered a good reference and to make some phone calls on my behalf, but I politely declined. 

I don't understand KC. What the fuck just happened? Did I really just get fired because of the pantry girl that I hate?

Edit: I texted with the chef and asked him to call me after the weekend and tell me the honest story of why I was let go. I told him that it's important to me for self development. He agreed and said he would call me on Monday.

This is my story, and that's what matters to me. Also, keep in mind that through all of this I rode my bike to work... a good solid 30 minuets of hard riding, because I didn't have a car.


I'm young, very young. I recently graduated high school. But I've had a love for cooking for years. I think I finally figured out where I got the bug. I went out with my father for dinner about a week and a half ago to Carabas (yeah yeah, I know, not great, but my father decided it was the best place that wasn't a 45 minuet drive away), and was sitting at the bar in front of the open kitchen there. It's the same seat I've sat in umpteen times. I'm watching the cooks doing the same thing I've come to love, and remember seeing them when I was 5-6 years old doing it. I believe it was there that I first thought ""That's so cool! I want to do that some day!"" The thought was then misplaced, and filled in by the usual boyhood dreams (army man, cop, firefighter, tractor driver), until my eventual stepmother moved in with my father. She cooked at home, and got me and my younger sister involved. From there it blossomed, as my taste buds grew up and I tried new foods. I started watching some t.v. cooking/food shows (only Good Eats and No Reservation), and reading culinary related books (guess who wrote them). Eventually, as I came upon reading The Nasty Bits, the thought was brought back to mind. As Anthony Bourdain talks about the post-work activities, and the bond, that permeate the field I realized that it was something I really wanted to do, at least conceptually. I had been cooking at home on off occasions for years, and anyone that ate anything I made loved it. So I figured I had some skill. But how to break into the industry? Low and behold, my school required a 3 day internship in the junior year. 

About 3 months before I have to actually go to it I'm already setting it up. I first walk into a local gastropub in Winter Park, get a card, shoot off an email, and still to this day I haven't gotten one back. Next place I go it one of the best establishments in town, on there corner of Park Ave. and New England. The bar is open, but they don't start the dinner service for another hour. I ask one of the girls standing behind the podium if I could speak with the manager. The manager come sour 5 minuets later and asks what's going on, and I tell him about the internship and how I'd like to spend those three days working there. He says that sounds more like a deal for the Chef de Cuisine, and that he'll send him right out. I'm standing there waiting (for only about 2 minuets) thinking it'll be some mid 30-something, clean cut, clean white coated guy who will take one look at me and say ""get lost."" As I'm musing I hear ""you must be the guy"" from my right. I turn and look and he's 6' 4"", bearded, with a pony tail, and spots all over his coat.

 I reply ""yes, sir. I am"" 
""Well, go on then, give me your story."" 
""well sir.."" 
""Chef.""
 ""well chef, my school requires me to do a 3 day internship, and I was wondering if I could somehow do it here. I know I'll probably just be doing dishes or something, but I want to see what it's like to work in real kitchen."" 
""What days?""
 ""march 13th through the 15th."" 
""Do you have a chef's jacket?"" 
""no, but I can get one."" 
""Okay, here's my card. My name is Derek. Get the Jacket, bring a chef's knife, and give me a call. My cell number is on the card."" 
""yes chef."" 

I leave, elated, and not knowing in the slightest what I'm in for. The months pass, I get my jacket, I get my mother's knife sharpened, and I get my biked fixed up so I can ride to work. I pop by the restaurant a few times for dinner and send Derek several texts to get info on what to do for the internship. 
Before I know it the day is upon me. I was told be in by noon. It's 11:15 and I walk through the back door into the kitchen, there's some guy there cleaning and I stand there waiting...and waiting.... and waiting.... eat about 11:30 Derek appears, shows me around, and sets me on my first job. Pizza sauce. From the moment on I barely stopped until 5 that afternoon for family meal. I stayed that night until 10:30 and rode my bike home. The next two days were about the same. However, on that final Friday Derek is talking bout the art festival the next day, and I j ump on the opportunity. I tell him that if he needs me I can come in. After a little back and forth I convince him. He says ""lunch starts at 11."" 
""I'll be in by 10:15."" 

9:55 that next morning I walk in and encounter two guys in the kitchen that I haven't met yet (due to their schedules), and introduce myself. That day I'm there until 1 the next morning. I ride home with my prizes, two cans of PBR and a couple of cigs, and drink and smoke my way home on my bike. 

A week or two goes by and I text Derek and let him know I can come in on my spring break. I intern all of my spring break (save the last weekend which was Easter, which I celebrate even though I'm not religious... more of a family thing than religious). I come back in two or three more times on long weekends.

 May, and my birthday, roll around. Derek and his fiancé come by my birthday dinner and I'm given the good news that they created a position just for me for the summer (prep cook... they didn't have one before). I'm elated and decide to spend some serous money on some serious steel for work (a Mac... which I love and recommend to everyone now). I work my summer, two days on the clock and at least one more off of it. It's hard, dirty, and not always the nicest environment. But I tough it out, dealing with an asshole sous chef and an executive chef that can be even worse. But through all of it I still would wake up on days that I got to go in and was happy and proud of what I had. Eventually summer came to a close and it was back to school for my senior year. I didn't have as much time to work. But I still kept in touch with all the guys, and on breaks I'd go in.

Through the whole thing I was unsure of myself and if I was worthy enough of being proud. I was slow, I had no idea what I doing, and I felt like I hindered more than helped. But not too long ago one of my friends from the place gave me a great compliment on another guys Facebook status that I too commented on. I had commented that even though I was young I still shared their passion, even through all the shit they gave me and all the hard times. My friend replied with:

&gt;Jordan...it's part of the industry. we need to weed out the weak links and unsaturate our beautiful profession from all the bullshit artists and wannabes. And bring it back to the misfits the ones that belong in a world of hurt... Those that bleed and smile about it...the ones that give up everything in the name of love...and since people can't handle that devotion we chefs live alone and love what we do....chef life...chef love...chef.


That, to me, said that they believed in me because I kept coming back. 

I'm now headed off to college to get a degree in business before I go to culinary school. People have told me that I won't be making that much. I know, but after being in that heat, that little slice of Hell, I don't want to do anything else. I love it. It's a rush like nothing else. It not going to be easy, and it won't always be fun. But those times when it is, and the satisfaction I'll get from serving people good food will make up for the crap. I just wanted to share this with r/kitchenconfidential, and see what you guys think.


P.S. Later in my college career I'll be picking up a job in a kitchen somewhere in town.

Our boss is constantly down our neck that we should prep faster. His goal times are way off though. His solution is not ""work faster"" or ""be more efficient"" but ""work sloppier"". He is chef/owner/manager and whenever he works in the kitchen he makes a mess. He is self taught and has never worked in a different kitchen. I feel he has no understanding that you have to put extra care into food to take it to the next level. Instead he is constantly looking to cut corners in order to save labour. When a recipe calls for diced peppers he tells us we should just roughly chop them, doesn't matter if they are uniform. I was shredding carrots for coleslaw the other day and he told me I shouldn't bother peeling them, waste of time and produce. 
Yesterday was the worst so far, the other prep cook was making tomato sauce (out of fresh tomatoes) and the boss man came and told him he shouldn't bother cutting out the green top bits of tomatoes, just throw the whole tomatoes in a food processor ""noone will know the difference"". We couldn't believe our ears, I feel embarrassed putting such food out. 

My problem is not only the difficulty to accept such bad practices, I'm also the lead prep cook in the kitchen. I should supervise and motivate people when the boss is not around - but how can I get people to care when it's obvious that the boss doesn't? Also, I have been training new people for well over a year now, and now the boss came to me and said that he would prefer to train everybody himself so that they wouldn't be ""too precise"". The kicker: even if we would shave off five minutes labour every day by working shitty, we consistently waste time every day because he messed up the order and he has to drive to a shop or to our supplier to buy essential ingredients. Every single day.

I was tasked with making kielbasas to smoke tomorrow. I stuffed the casings fine and my first batch of 18 sausages came out fine. The second batch I decided to relax with my measuring of the sausages because I felt like I knew how long to make them. 1/2 of the sausages in the second batch were 1/4 - 1/2"" longer than the first batch. 18 sausages means I missed the equivalent of around 3 sausages which we could sell for around 6 dollars each. And now the portioning is off because some are large and some small.

Then my batch of red pepper merguez sausages came out looser in the casing than the chef prefers. Not huge mistakes, but I wasted food, which means more with the quality of product I am working with and working for a sole proprietor.

I'm talking about the upscale and fine dining restaurants in hotels. I don't really know what I'm getting at, but it seems that someone always has something to say about their stints at say....The Four Seasons. Lots of celebrity chefs, world pastry champs, etc. have come up through hotels and they are always noted on their resumes. What makes this better/different/a different experience than say, a freestanding restaurant of the same caliber? 

My chef is always talking about his time at The Four Seasons and how it was SO nice, or SO hard or SO crazy or long hours or fill in the blank. There is a bit of a language barrier between us, so I never know what he's talking about when he rehashes his younger years. He never refers to this job as my time at ______ restaurant or my time under _____ chef, it's always my time at The Four Seasons.  

Is there a benefit to working in a well known, upscale hotel? Is the kitchen nicer? Better pay and benefits? Easier to move through the ranks? More to learn? Would I want to seek out this experience? From what I understand their kitchen staff is massive and there are multiple chefs overseeing different areas (the restaurants regular service, banquets/weddings, special events, etc.) So I can see how this might require MANY cooks and lots of organization, since this is a massive undertaking, but I don't see what the big deal is.

Pounding coffee/pot/gatorade in the car, make it into work (prep cook at hipster/gastropub) to find that the freezer is out. It had been running high for a couple days but it finally went. Kitchen manager was irate because the other managers were quite aware of the impending doom because we log temps every 3 hours, but they did nothing. 


We have good contacts so we had a new freezer within 2 hours, but god damn. 5k in damages/losses. 


The worst thing though was the clusterfuck that was the kitchen today. It's a pretty small kitchen, 7ft make station, 2 small prep tables, and a 12 ft line w/ a small grill, flat top, 4 burner range, 2 fryers and 2 ovens. We had the day cook, who was training a new employee, myself, another prep guy, the kitchen manager, and guys working on our internet setup on ladders. That mixed with boxes of food EVERYWHERE, and the fact that we had to turn the dishroom upside down (move shelf containing every non-edible supply we have thereby blocking the dish sink) to fit the new freezer in. Talk about a clusterfuck. My day consisted of attempting to prep food with a 6 inch square of table space, occasionally going out to move gigantic appliances, peeing constantly from chugging water, and wincing from headache pain.  Everything was just so much harder than it usually is. That and I've become a bit of a neat freak when I do prep. My areas are always spotless and there are never dishes on the shelf when I'm there, so the insane mess was fucking with me. Just couldn't get a rhythm going with anything ya know?


Oh, and Mondays it's half priced burger day. We get our meat fresh locally, and we have several stuffed burgers [one has bleu cheese and bacon, one has pepper jack and jalepenos, one is ground in house corned beef with saurkraut and swiss inside, one is ground in house chicken/bacon with ham and swiss inside, and then we do one that's two portabella caps together with cheese inside and deep fried] which are 1lb each (two 6oz patties, and 4 oz of filling), made in house, and go from $12 to $6 on Mondays. Our regular burgers are 8oz, from an awesome butcher, and only 3.5 on Mondays. It the best burger deal in town for sure so we get killed. The stuffed ones take forever to assemble since there are so many steps, especially the corned beef, and chicken ones since you're also grinding meat, and the par is much higher on Mondays for them so yeah. Fucking busy ass shitty day. The icing on the cake was that I left before they made milkshakes for everyone out of some ice cream we were gonna toss because we needed the space more than it. Who doesn't love free milkshakes?  


Anyway


It'll all be better tomorrow, the new freezer will be up and running, the day cook is one of my best friends, and the prep list will be easy, but I just felt the need to vent.

I started out in a standard mom-n-pop from scratch deli doing short order breakfasts and lunches. A few years later, I got a part time gig for a well known and reputable hospitality in my home town. In a short talk with the chef of the restaurant, I get hired full time in the banquet kitchen. This lasts for about a week.

He calls me into his office, tells me the lunch cook is leaving and needs a replacement. He remembers our talk, offers me the job and a slight raise. I gladly accept. I worked lunch for a year (a solo position), helped the dinner crew out with prep and learned what I could. I get moved to dinner service and it is a whole new world to me. Busier, more delicate, more creative and more professional. At this point, I was trying to keep my head above water with just prepping. All creativity and ambition flew out the window and this became just a job.

About 6 months into dinner service, I had an opportunity to travel, so I leave for 10 months. I worked in a kitchen and did a few stages on my adventure.that was short lived. I decided it is time to return home and as I am driving back East through Kansas this past summer, I get a phone call from the Chef. ""Hey asshole! When you get back, come see me if you want a job.""

I have worked garde manger for the past 9 months and was recently moved to Saute. Something clicked while I was away. 

I understand everything so much better. The application of why you cook certain things a certain way as opposed to just how makes so much more sense. I actually love my career and it is not just a job. I strive to be creative. I enjoy a solid ass kicking on a Saturday night and serving top quality food from the first dish to the last. I have rediscovered my passion.

This ever happen to you?,35,6,31,http://www.reddit.com/r/KitchenConfidential/comments/zoak0/recently_quit_a_job_for_refusing_to_serve_rotten/,"  I got a part-time job at a restaurant/venue in Little Rock over the summer. It became apparent after only a few days that A) the kitchen was in severe disrepair and was not properly equipped to handle the summer heat and B) the head chef was a complete idiot who had never even heard of food sanitation. After less than three weeks of working there the walk-in cooler broke down.I noticed it was not as cool as it should have been at the end of my shift but assumed someone from management had already noticed it. Two days later I went back to work and realized that not only had no one noticed that everything in the cooler was room temperature, but that no one had noticed that all of the proteins in the cooler were completely spoiled. This included gallons upon gallons of raw chicken marinating in buttermilk (chicken fingers are the signature item on the menu). I then witnessed a fellow employee open one of the containers of chicken, gag, dry heave, and then continue putting the chicken in containers for service. 
    Naturally, I was horrified by all of this. My second job is at an up-scale French restaurant and despite having worked many fast food jobs in high school, despite that variety of experience, I had never seen anyone blatantly ignore rotting meat. I immediately brought this to the attention of the manager, who did a temp check on the walk-in. The walk-in cooler had been at over 60 degrees for two days. She said it was fine because the chicken containers, ""felt cool."" I then insisted that she smell the chicken. Despite the look of disgust on her face, she continued to insist that the chicken was fine and that I should get back to work. I insisted that we needed to call the owners if the head chef was serving rotten meat. She called the owners who told us to SERVE THE SPOILED CHICKEN ANYWAY. The head chef came out and talked to me. He became very defensive. I told him serving meat that had been above 40 degrees for days was a very easy way to harm one of the customers. He said he did not want to throw away that much chicken. Upon realizing what stupid fucks they were, I thanked them for the chance to work in their kitchen and left. I will never put profits above food sanitation. I will never stake my reputation on a dirty-ass kitchen with low standards. 
    Needless to say, despite being a popular venue, I have not returned and warn my friends about their low standards for food sanitation. I feel terrible for quitting my job, but what else could I do? Has anyone else been in a situation like this? Were you able to solve the problem without quitting?

Bonus tidbit:
The owners of this establishment who insisted that we serve the bad chicken got food poisoning from eating at their own restaurant less than a week after I quit. Yay karma! Unfortunately, some of the staff also got sick from eating there. 

Edit: Nothing wrong with the French place. Cleanest kitchen I have ever worked in. Sorry for the confusion.


Update: Spoke to an employee who still worked at the restaurant after I left. Apparently after I walked out someone quickly realized the threat of me calling the health department and got the walk-in fixed immediately. They did, however, continue serving the old chicken for at least one more night. So the problems I witness while I was there may very well be solved. I have continued to hear from people who say the kitchen is still not up to par, but I don't want to repeat anything I haven't witnessed for myself.

I'd been told ""He's out, step up"". I did, worked whatever the hell they wanted, did whatever the hell they wanted, and basically whored myself for the past few months.

Last night, I got told ""yeah, the other guy is being named KM next week"". My day went from good to fucked.

So now I (and the rest of the kitchen) get to work under a KM who is WAY too buddy buddy with half the staff to be a boss, barely gets his own work done, and generally fucks off all day.

My give-a-fuck is broken, and I wish I could find a better job. Sadly its the best paying joint in town


Update: I feel like I've fucked up now. I ended up spending the latter half of my shift bitching about my new KM in front of my proprietor. Sure, I tow the party line like nobody's business, but I was fed the hell up and was just ranting to co-workers. Now I get to deal with my boss feeling like I'm a whiny bitch.

2nd update: Well, had a talk with the other (hopefully soon to be) AKM. We decided that while we're not happy with the choices management has made, we need to put our egos and attitudes aside and get this place running smoothly again, and help support our KM. We've both been a bit idiotic about it and realized that if we can get this place going like its supposed so, we not only make ourselves look good; but we have the possibility of being sent to other stores for KM positions.",,False,self,t5_2sa8b,1374174235.0,,,True,t3_1if3ko,http://www.reddit.com/r/KitchenConfidential/comments/1if3ko/well_last_night_was_absolutely_ruined/,

I'll start.  I was working at an italian restaurant in New Orleans.  I had just recently moved to the pizza station, which was (admitted by the chef himself) the most brutal station he'd ever seen.  Working in front of a 700 degree mouth of hell, with 700 on the books for dinner and no room for error, it was literally like walking through my own personal rings of hell.  

Anyway. 

It was a rough start.  I had never tossed dough before so my pizzas weren't up to standard for like a good week.  But day by day I got better.  I learned, I applied, I learned some more.  Chef stopped screaming at me and the Sous even stopped making smirking sarcastic remarks about my shitty pizza.  

Enter a friday a week before Christmas (Our crushing busy season).  It was a crazy dinner rush and I was trying to get some solo pizzas in the oven (I could see the ticket board, the expo station was right next to mine.)  As I was scanning the tickets, wiping the sweat out of my eyes I asked the Sous ""What's next chef?""  

And this man, this man who had degraded me and screamed at me and made me cry in a locked bathroom, said with complete calm and no sarcasm whatsoever

I am currently working at a restaurant that is unorthodox at best. I've made a few posts here, but something I saw tonight, was the most unprofessional act I have ever seen any chef, or cook perform. I watched a dish go out to the wrong table, watched a person eat from the plate, watched said plate go back into the kitchen, and instead of going in the trash, where it should have gone....the cook grabbed it, set back down on the line, and sent it back out. 

I have worked in restaurants for a long time. I have worked in a lot of restaurants. I have bussed, hosted, expoed, prepped, cooked on multiple lines (from grill to fry) washed dishes, and bartended....I have never seen a cook do this to save face. 

Here are the details if you want them:

The place I work is small. There is no expo, or food runner. We have a couple of well intentioned hostesses that don't know anything about restaurants because this is their first job. 

   Every other restaurant I have worked in, the plates are arranged by an expo, and then taken to the table. The window at this place is a clusterfuck at best. They place the tickets under the plates (which are sometimes stacked two deep), when you get a ticket. When I ask the cooks (one doesn't speak enough English to speak to you to communicate effectively) about which plates are mine (I don't want to take the wrong dishes) he just yells some shit like ""you should know what the fuck you ordered,"" or, ""they're not my fucking tables,"" you get the idea. Makes it a little difficult, and the owner wonders why there are so many mix ups. 

There were 4 plates sitting in the window, both are touching rims, on opposite sides of the window. It is a very slow night, and there is no excuse for the response I get when I ask, if the 2 grouped to the right are my table. I get a blank stare, like I asked a stupid question, ""yeah, that's your fuckin' table."" I throw the garnish on the plates and head out. I take it to the table, and go to ring up a glass of wine for the table. I hear I am ""needed"" in the kitchen.

""What the fuck man? why did you take that food? You mixed up the fucking dishes."" This is in front of a kitchen full of people, trying to blame me for the fuck up. 

""Seriously? I say, ""I asked you if it was my plate, you said yes, so I took the food. Don't try to blame me, you didn't even put the ticket up."" 

The mistake was a simple one. Dish A: a seafood francese

dish b: veal francese with prosciutto under the veal

The portions are similar size and shape, and the sides were subbed to the same. easy to mix up...that's cool...I understand...take some fucking responsibility.

I run out to get the food, apologize to the customer, and bring out the proper dish, and take the plate she tasted back to the kitchen. I'm about to toss the veal, and the cook grabs it from me, and sets it down in front of him on the line. I stand there with my mouth open. 
I walk out of the kitchen debating on whether or not tell the owner what is going on. I walk back in the kitchen, said dish is gone, and I find it on a table with a customer biting into it. 

I have never seen anyone pull that shit. If I was cooking in the kitchen , I wouldn't have let anyone do that. I feel like a coward for not stopping that person from eating a contaminated plate. 

My last day is tomorrow. I can't work at a place where the kitchen guys don't give a fuck on that level. I watch the dishwasher take plates that are ""clean"" from tables, and instead of washing them, he simply places them with the clean plates. The crushed red pepper goes out in a rameken, and instead of tossing the tiny amount dishboy puts in a tray for the line to use to season foods. They also keep saucepans full of food, and flour for dredging on the floor, and sometimes move them around with their feet. 

I used to enjoy eating at this place, now it makes me kind of ill to think about it. I can't let anyone I know eat there. The owner is a really nice guy, and he has to, he has to see some of this shit. 

Damn. Sorry for ranting....any of you that stuck around this long, thank you for listening. Have a drink for me...and wish me luck in my search for a new gig.

I know this little corner of reddit is a great place to break balls and lament about the bullshit that comes with working in and around kitchens, and I hope that it will always be such a place. That being said, I just wanted to get a few things out there. 

To the people on my facebook feed in the food community that have all poured out huge support, thank you. Every famous chef and restaurant I can think of were wishing Boston luck today and sending whatever support they could, even if it was just to remind people to give blood and donate to the Red Cross. 

To the food community in Boston, you guys rock. For a few years I cooked at a place that was a mere 30 yards from the second blast. Word via facebook is that the entire restaurant shut down to help out people in the area, handing out water and directing people to the best routes out of the area. [This chef](http://i.imgur.com/OMkm3LU.jpg) runs a place a few hundred yards from the marathon finish line, and was typical of pics showing up on facebook today. 

On to the main point of posting. I implore you folks around the US and around the world to please, first and foremost, keep doing what you do best. As much as we gripe about customers, we truly do make most of them happy, so keep on doing that. Increasing happiness in this world is so underrated and helps people more than you would ever know. For those of you that want to do something a little more tangible, the best thing you can do is take the time to get yourself certified in CPR and basic first aid training, and ask your staff to do the same. For those of you cooking in big cities, and even small ones, the more people know how to properly help in these situations, the better. You never know when it's going to save someone's life. It could be a customer, a coworker, or a passerby whose life you save. Make sure your first aid kits are always stocked. Keep the routes to your exits clear. Remind your staff of proper procedure for directing your guests to safety - this was a situation that should never happen, but things like fires often do. Be safe in the kitchen in general. Take the time to properly scrub up spilled oil, it could be the difference between someone tripping or not in an emergency. Make sure you've got flashlights on hand. Anything you can think of to make your restaurant a safer place to be and more prepared for an unexpected event, the better it is for everyone.

I started 7 years ago at the age of 14 in a greasy spoon diner. As a dishwasher. Got the job through my best friend, and originally I only wanted spending money while I was in high school and fund my growing fascination with cars and car tuning. Fast forward two months the chef (an incredibly skilled 40/yo ish Cantonese man by the name of Simon) asks me if I know how to cook eggs, and like an idiot I answered yes. I learned how to work my ass off and cook eggs in addition to a million other things. I loved every minute of that job despite the lack of AC, massive language barrier between myself and my fellow cooks (everyone else was Chinese with the exception of one Greek frycook, and not one of them spoke English well), and ""shitty hours"" (I've since learned that 5 day work weeks and closing at 9 pm was a cakewalk). During downtime the cooks would teach me about their native cuisines which created the spark that would eventually ignite my passion for all cuisines.

2 and a half years later, on the advice of my family and teachers, I left my hometown and the diner to go away to university to make an attempt at a ""normal"" life. I try to find a IT job at first but all of my verifiable experience was in that dark hellish diner kitchen so I end up falling into a few gigs at some shitty bars. At the time, I only viewed it as temporary, I figured I would graduate and find a job outside of the industry and never have to look back. 

As school went on I started to become disillusioned with my grand plan. Despite doing well in my classes and maintaining a 3.8 GPA, I realized I didn't want to be a professor, and that such a job is almost impossible to attain without another 7+ years of school, a lot of luck, and a lot of money. It was at about this time that I discovered this subreddit, and Anthony Bourdain, David Cheng, and Thomas Keller among others, and it further opened my eyes to the industry. Reading of both the good and the bad made me realise fully just how much I love being in this industry and gave me a small window into the world beyond the low end bar and diner kitchens I had been in.

About a year and a half ago I found a new job at a local bar &amp; grill that pushed me over the edge. The menu was typical bar food, but unlike all the others, it was all fresh and prepped daily from fresh local ingredients. I was finally working with some driven cooks again and on several occasions they suggested culinary school to me as an alternative to my increasingly dark looking academic future.

6 months ago everything finally clicked. I informed the university of my desire to leave (a few of my proffs tried to convince me to stay but ultimately understood my desire to leave), and on the advice of my boss applied to culinary school at the local college, which is well respected both in the local area and beyond.

Fast forward to now and I've recently found myself working for the most respected chef in the city at his newest restaurant. I'm currently on prep but I learn something new everyday and it is already a step of from the dish pit that I initially started in there. To top it off, I'm even more exited for school than I was when I applied 6 months ago because of this.

We managed to get through the first two hours of service, but as soon as it hit 7:30 my board was full and i was stacking tickets about 12 deep. I was working broiler (HUGE gorgeous broiler I work with. two levels and adjustable flames) with three dry rubbed steaks. for about 25 minutes the ticket machine made no noise and the kitchen was in borderline anarchy. Never have I ever been apart of a giant standstill like that. Didn't know what ticket number I was putting up, just temping steaks and slingin em. We ended up having 6 tables walk out. Which is pretty bad for us, but our neighbor/rival restaurant had about 8 walkouts. We ended up doing a pretty solid cover count, close to 400. But once nine o'clock hit everyone wasn't in a very pissy mood, more happier about the fact that it was over and EVERYONE had just an equal shitty night.

I hired this one guy that seemed enthusiastic and generally a quick worker. He really tried. It's normal for the new guy to get burnt with the oven door but he did it waayy too often and his arms (not hands) had multiple burn stripes. He seemed to be getting better day by day until his 4th day. Things were hectic and with his incompetence slinging slices, we just put him in dishwashing duty. Pots and pans were getting clean eerily slow so I rush him and tell him to get his shit together. This is when he comes to me and says,

""I can't wash the dishes, the Brillo pad hurts my hands, do you have anything softer to wash the dishes with?""

For the past few Mondays, I would just get in a shitty mood. Just pissed off. I chalked it up to either recently quitting smoking or lack of sleep or whatever. 

Last week the fry cook I worked with on Monday night quits. He always annoyed the shit out of me (although I could never put my finger on why), and I heard he either quit because people were mean to him or that he was upset that he didn't have 4/20 off. Actually, that makes it pretty specific why he annoyed me. Also, he just no-called no-showed and just told the manager that he quit when he finally answered.

Anyway...I think I hated him more than I thought. The whole time I was working with him, I would just try to think professionally and not put my catty bullshit out there. 

However, the very first item I started on the very first ticket that printed, I sliced the shit out of my palm while pitting an avocado. That meant just stuffing a glove with a few paper towels until I could catch a break to actually bandage it. That also meant wearing gloves on it for the next 12 hours. Despite this annoying set back, I had a very good couple of shifts. Our dish guy even said how more laid back and laughable I seemed.

The main point to this was venting, I guess, but I'm also wondering if anyone has had a similar experience with either scenario. Has a shift started the worst possible way only to be decent? Or has something made work shitty as hell, but you didn't know what it was until it was gone? Or hell, this could all just be a big coincidence, and I could go through it again with a bitter, shitty attitude.

Food costs, labor hours, materials, shit breaking....all that costs money that breaks into the meager profits.   However, some methods of scraping up pennies has me wondering if my corporation is run by Mr. Krabs from Spongebob.   Here's a couple of examples.

Right around Easter it was decided by corporate that having a towel service come in once a week wasn't cost effective.   So my boss had to cancel it.   Corporate's proposed replacements?   Disposable fabric towels.   You know, the ones that come in a big ass box that you pull em from the center?   Yeah....those things.   Combine that with a couple of cut up beach towels, and you have a total savings of $30 a month.

If that wasn't asinine enough, last week we had to cancel our knife rentals.    Since before time existed, we've had a service who came in twice a month and changed out the old, dulling knives and grill scrapers with freshly sharpened blades.   Welp, that is no more.   The replacements are some flimsy plastic handled pieces of shit that thus far havent held an edge for a week.   I wouldn't use these damn things in my kitchen at home, much less in a commercial kitchen.   And corporate sees a whopping $90 a month savings.

So for a grand total of $120 a month not spent, dry towels are now a commodity worth more than gold, and I had to bring my old, wore out chefs knives out of retirement so I can have confidence when I cut things again.

I've been working at this gig for over 2 years now, and our chef has only been around for 9 months or so. He only ever works mornings and lunch service, but he is very easily aggravated by little things that the servers will do. 

He expects menu counts all the time. If there's no expo or server counting menus every 15 minutes, or if we get a few chits without a menu count prior he'll yell at somebody to get us a ""goddamn menu count"". He also expects any tables of 6 or larger to have warnings, and split into no more than 4 orders per bill. You rang in a mod that he doesn't understand or *thinks* can't be done? Time to drop everything and get somebody to clarify what was meant. And god forbid you ring in food between 11am and 2pm.

Us guys who work nights and afternoons don't care about any of this shit. If we get 10 consecutive bills we just put our heads down and make the food. If a 6 or 8 top comes in with no warning or on one bill, we make the food. If there's a mod we need clarification on, we ask politely. Certain times of the day are likely to be busy, so why fret over the little details? 

I don't understand why it's so difficult to do work without knowing every little detail about what's going on in the restaurant. I might ask for a menu count if we're ready to cut somebody just to make sure we don't get fucked over later... might. Stressing over all these things can't be good for you.

Yesterday I called around 12pm for my schedule. Manager says ""ok let me check."", owner gets on the phone tells me I'm off the chart now, we need someone more reliable. Uhhh? Now over the past few days a veteran has been texting me to cover for him, I say no as I have plans. He calls off at least once a Week. I have never called off. Gone home once. That's it. Wtf?

I work in a restaurant whose regulars are generally amazing, well-read, well-mannered diners, but Mother's Day Weekend totally brought out the crazies! I'd love to hear about some of the crazies who came into your restaurants.

Fortunately I had today off, but my weekend included:

- Lady from a table who'd been waiting 15 minutes at peak time for their first course to arrive: ""EXCUSE me, I don't understand WHY that table got their food before we did when we got here first."" Server: ""Actually, that table was here for an hour before you ever arrived and they're on their third course."" That shut her right up, surprisingly.

- Grumpy mother who spilled coffee all over herself because she didn't know how to operate a French Press and then yelled at the server about it.

- A couple who split a medium well steak, and had one of the halves of the steak sent back to cook to well done.

- One guy who threw a fit because we charged him for the dessert that he ordered with a candle in it. He thought it would be free because it had a candle in it, even though HE was the one who ordered it.

- Douchebag table of 9 whose reservation was at 5:30, arrived one by one and didn't actually sit until 7, didn't order until 7:30 (peak time), got wasted, and were literally the last table to leave, five hours later. There's a reason we booked you at 5:30, so you WOULDN'T clog up the peak traffic! The worst part is they were overheard all night complaining about their nannies and their six-bedroom houses being too small for their families of four. The best part? Nine bottles of wine for the entire table, plus at least two rounds of cocktails each. Ka-ching!

For the last seven months I've been busting my ass in a restaurant that does degustation/tasting only and is run/own by two of the best Chefs in the city.  I'm talking Michelin caliber boys that have worked in Top 10 restaurants in the world and started a little restaurant of their own.    

In my time there I've gone from the cunt to pretty much running the kitchen.  I've worked the four sections (Pastry, Garde Manger, Sauce and Expedite/Pass), organize the ordering and inventory, organize other jr. staff and try to liaise with FOH (including taking phone call reservations), fixed equipment, helped with small improvements over the food and menu creation and more.  Unofficially, I've been introduced to people as the Sous Chef and Chef de Cuisine but on paper/pay I'm just Chef de Partie.  For seven months I was working 5.5 days a week (5 days, 1 prep day) and clocking about 80 hours/week for $600. 

The two Chef owners can be nuts, they're pretty much alcoholics and drug addicts with their own restaurant.  I've had to put up with them being hung over, drunk during service, sleeping until 5:00PM because they were out partying, leaving a mess after a night partying in their restaurant, etc.

Favourite moments of mine include:  

1. Having to break into the restaurant because I didn't have a key.  The Chef that lived above the restaurant left that morning because he was too embarrassed to face us when he was still drinking with friends at 10AM.  I climbed in through a window and told the two other cooks to climb in as well.  We couldn't get any orders into the building or FOH staff when we were opening for a busy lunch at 12.

2. I left behind an ordering list to be called through as I normally do with notes.  Showed up the next morning and nothing was ordered because the Chef went out and got shitfaced and forgot to call in the ordering.  

3. Being put on Sauce and never trained (I've only ever done Entremetier/Garnish with very minimal Sauce) and then yelled at for not being good enough.  Sauce at this place does all its own garnish/veg.  I had 2 hot mid courses, 4 meats and a fish.  Each protein had 2 garnishes and its own puree and sauce.  My favourite dish was the Poussin where I had to grab 2 fresh herbs, halve a quail egg, heat the puree, cook the baby corn in beurre monte/emulsion, get the poussin out of the circulator, pan roast the poussin, saute wild mushrooms, carve off the poussin breasts and warm the sauce. And I'm the cunt for taking too long…

4.  I don't have Michelin experience.  But every single Michelin stage we've had gets more attention and training than I do in one day.  ""Here, we'll show you how to make a sauce"" ""Here, we'll show you how we break down a lamb"".  I've always introduced myself to them as a dishwasher and just look like a retard as I run around doing EVERYTHING.

5. When the previous Saucier left I was working Garde.  In the two weeks that we didn't have anyone I prepped for two stations and had to make sure Sauce was fully set up for the Chef to walk onto the station at 6PM.  After service I'd also had to break down and clean when he walked off his station.  And I'm the cunt if I forgot to do something or don't have his backup ready.  Did I also mention we almost NEVER had a dishwasher.  So the cooks wash all their own dishes and pans.  I've had to scrub my own pots/pans to order before. 

What finally broke me down and got me to quit is after a night where I was left in charge they trashed their own restaurant with a party.  I ran service for a night expediting/plating and after we locked up for the night the Chefs came back with friends of theirs and had a booze &amp; blow fest.  I got a text message the next day at 7AM saying we were closed for lunch and to come at 1PM with a ""sorry for the mess"" at the end.  Walked into work at 12PM and the restaurant was destroyed, looked like a frat party went through.  Broken glass all over the tables, broken wine glasses, bottles everywhere, cigarette packs on the ground, food smashed/strewn all over.  We were left to clean it up and expect to be ready for dinner service while the two Chefs slept it off.  People walking by on the street were starring at us as we cleaned - it was one of the most embarrassing moments of my professional career.  

I quit that night.  We didn't an apology from them at all.  What kills me is that the service I ran for them was one of the smoothest and best services the restaurant had in a while (according to FOH management and staff).

The worse part of this is that I may have lost a sponsorship visa from them.  I'm working somewhere else in the world and they had originally agreed to sponsor me to stay on longer.  Although I'm starting to doubt they were serious.  We were talking about it for 4+ months and never saw one piece of paperwork be done.  I'm about to get deported in four months leaving behind a city I've grown to love with friends and a gf.

At the end of it all I feel so damn broken and like I was wrong to have quit.  Like I should have just sucked it up and not said anything.  Working my last two weeks was hard because I didn't even have faith or confidence in cooking anymore! The whole thing wants me to leave the kitchen where cooking has been the one thing I've ever been good at and done for the last 5 years.  I've always been the strongest cook that's held it together but at the end of this place I feel like a fucking loser.  I've never felt so kicked when I'm down...

Anyone have any advice or input? Anyone been through this before?

**TL;DR:** Was working my ass off.  Chef/Owners are douchebags and I quit but I feel like I'm in the wrong and broken and lost career wise.  ",,False,self,t5_2sa8b,False,,,True,t3_rh429,http://www.reddit.com/r/KitchenConfidential/comments/rh429/help_me_kc_im_so_lost_and_damn_confused_was_i/,

1296503258.0,25,self.KitchenConfidential,fckkw,"Just got an ""A"" on our health inspection.  Here are some thoughts on the subject...",25,0,14,http://www.reddit.com/r/KitchenConfidential/comments/fckkw/just_got_an_a_on_our_health_inspection_here_are/,"*I'm Executive Chef of a fine dining restaurant in nyc, just so you know my perspective...*

Everyone with any restaurant experience knows that health inspections are extremely stressful.  During inspection, most managers and chefs are freaking out, causing the rest of the staff to do the same.  For good reason too...not a lot of restaurants survive for long after being shut down for health code violations.  

Last summer NYC changed its system from what was essentially pass/fail to a letter grade system: 0-13 points for an A, 14-27 points for a B, and a C for 28 points and above.  28 points (now a C grade) remains constant as the ""fail""-point, requiring monthly re-inspections until the point total falls below 28 or the restaurant is shut down by the city.  The point system, inspection procedure or regulations didn't change at all...what changed was the letter grading and the added rule that the it had to be posted ""where they can easily be seen by
people passing by.""

And it's a critical change at that.  For every restaurant in the city to be required to post a [giant letter grade](http://i.imgur.com/7kKRp.jpg) from the department of health on the front door is no joke.  I've always run a very clean kitchen...for the benefit of sanitation and of staff discipline.  Even I was fucking scared as hell.  

Why soil ourselves so badly?  

Well, having everyone that's walking in or walking by see a letter grade on your front door or window is a big fucking deal.  Even bigger than most think.  It doesn't matter if people don't know what that grade really means (and they don't).  People will see an ""A"" and feel great about going in.  People will see a ""B"" or ""C"" and the reaction would be anywhere from turned off to being completely disgusted.  The nyc restaurant scene is absolutely cut throat, too many restaurants...and no matter what you're offering, someone else is doing the same.  So, for taco restaurants the competition went from all *restaurants serving tacos* to *restaurants serving tacos that have an ""A"" hanging on their door*.  The other places are irrelevant and cannot compete to make real money and/or survive until they achieve the ""A"".

New York City Department of Health and Mental Hygiene knows this and it is in fact the point of it all.  They’re working to make restaurants take their inspections  even more seriously or risk going out of business.   Which sounds great to just about everyone too.  But there are a couple of major problems here…

**1) The outcome of health inspections are often unpredictable and depend on a number of uncontrollable factors.**

This. Is. Fact. Ever been to the DMV?  Or the post office?  Or the police station?  I'm not trying say people in civil service are all terrible, I'm saying they're super inconsistent.  One day you go to the DMV and the person is an absolute delight...efficient, friendly, helpful with addressing your concerns.  The next time you get someone who couldn't care less about you and doesn't mind letting you know it.  Or sometimes you get pulled over for speeding and the officer lets you go with a warning.  Other times he/she gives you the ticket while looking for reasons for more, giving you a condescending lecture the whole time.  Not sure why but people in civil service seem to be the most inconsistent workforce anywhere.  Maybe it's the hiring procedure, or the candidates they receive, or the nature of the job and their salaries?  Or maybe they're just as inconsistent as any other group, it's just that we expect them to be otherwise.

Well, health inspectors are civil servants too, and are *wildly* inconsistent.  Some of them are strict and thorough, but use common sense and reason to guide their process making them fair.  Some of them seem to be out to find every single violation or hint of one in an effort to inflict the most damage on your business during their visit.  Some of them don't really care about any of it and breeze through the inspection.  I guess they're human, and the worst of them are technically abiding by the rules stated.  So is the cop that adds on a ticket for not using the turn signal while pulling over.  Just saying that the inspector you draw is a huge factor that you have no control over.

Also, **restaurants are fucking crazy.** Huge places filled with food, employees, customers, garbage, chemicals, fire, water and anything else you can think of.  A restaurant is like a living being and to judge it based on a snapshot taken at a random moment is a problem itself.  Again, we got an ""A"" on our inspection, but I'll tell you right now there were days when we wouldn't have.  The day fruit flies just showed up and decided to make a home in our lounge.  The day the street pipes got all messed up and flooded a corner of the basement.  Or when one of the fridges was running a few degrees warm.  Sometimes one of our 80 employees forgets to label something or the steward misses a dented can and puts it on the shelf with the others.  A million things can and will go wrong on any given day, and of course we deal with them quickly to get everything soignee again. But should you be having a bad day and the inspector arrives, all you can do is scramble a bit and pray you don't get points for it.  Which brings up the other thing...

**2) People have no fucking clue what an A, B or C grade really means.  Meanwhile they're being encouraged to make decisions based on them.**

Decisions that affect small businesses.  Small businesses that each employ anywhere from a handful to hundreds of people.  It's not hard to predict a diner's thought process in relation to health department letter grades.

**I'm only going to restaurants with an A!**

*Um, excuse me.  I'm sorry to bother you but...do you know what the grades really represent?  You know, a B grade actually isn't th...*

**I don't care!  A's are better than B's!  Everyone knows that from years and years of school!!  Why would I go somewhere that's not as good?**

And that diner is right.  There's no reason for anyone to go to any restaurant without that **A**.  On top of that, someone sees a **B** and thinks ""Oh, they didn't get an A.  I wonder why?"", and proceeds to think about rat droppings, cockroaches, fight club, etc and runs away disgusted.

But do you know what makes a **B**?  Well we said already it's 14 points.  Points come from violations.  Some examples (each violation's point value has a range, the inspector is to judge the severity and assign the actual points):

Side towel left on counter top - **5 to 7 points**

Refrigerator above 41°F (even 1°) - **7 to 10 points**

Refrigerator missing thermometer - **2 to 5 points**

Any fly (*food and/or non-food areas*) - **5 to 8 points (28 if it's really messed up like Temple of Doom style I guess)**

Aaaaand we're at around 20 points!  Don't forget that these violations' points sometimes stack too. So for instance, if there's another side towel sitting out somewhere during the tour it would add another 5 to 7 points.  That would put us in **C** territory.  On a side note, having a larger restaurant with more employees is obviously a huge disadvantage.

The point is that the letter grade **doesn't actually mean anything close to what is being perceived.**  How about a 13 point **A** vs a 14 point **B**?  Or two **B**s but one had rotten meat on the hot line and the other got 6 points because a line cook was drinking a cup of water in the kitchen? (Yes, that's a violation)

Here's [Grace Green on Huff Post](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2011/01/19/city-inspections-reveal-n_n_810872.html) with a typical clueless blog post.  She gleefully says that Le Cirque and Gramercy Tavern (large, well known restaurants here) received **C**'s, indicating they had over 28 *violations* which is plain wrong.  28 *points* make a **C**, and we don't know how many violations.  Again, you don't know because you can't tell because the letter grade doesn't have that information.  This is someone writing an article on the subject and still has no idea how the system works and what the grades mean.   The hilarious thing is that they don't mean anything until you investigate the violations.  (You can find full details on each restaurant's inspection [online](http://a816-restaurantinspection.nyc.gov/RestaurantInspection/SearchBrowse.do) but I seriously doubt anyone is going to bother to look past the letter grade)

And so these are the grades that everyone in the city are now judging us on.  And it's a shame.  I'm all for strict health and safety standards for diners and employees everywhere.  But the DHMH didn't think this through before implementation.  It's made slipping on a health code a potential death blow to an entire business and the income of its employees.  


**tl;dr Health inspection letter grades are too vague and arbitrary to have the so large an impact on a restaurant's ability to compete and survive.**

My boss is a pretty savvy business man (he'd have to be to stay afloat in the market in my town) and owns three restaurants and a bakery. I'm head chef at the nice place, the best of the three places (we all serve the bakery stuff), and usually everything is just dandy. For reference, an entree at the other two might be $12-15, at my joint it's $20-30.  

However, since it's summer in a college town, he's gone balls to the wall with these crazy deals: Half price drinks, $4 apps between five and six, and now since it's Independence Day week here in the US, we're doing buy one get one free on entrees all week. That's without mentioning the daily deals we do.  

I would be fine with all of this, because it's not my money and I'm still getting my check at the end of the week. However, since I'm head chef, I'm in charge of all the accounting relating to the kitchen: labor and food cost being the big two. And when those margins are off, I'm the one who has to take the blame. If I fuck up, I'll gladly take the blame and learn a lesson from the mistake that I made. But when we're selling almost everything at half price and I have to bring in extra people to handle the workload, margins basically flee the premises.  

Normally, when confronted with a difficult situation I can talk my way out of it, not with bullshit but with facts and reasoning and get the problem solved. This is a problem that I cannot solve. I will tell my boss ""Well, we had to do this and this, and order this, just so we could handle the volume of guests coming through the door,"" and his response will inevitably be ""I'm a business man, I know numbers. These are off."" Or something like that.

Especially the UI that the management sees.  This stupid thin application layer over a SQL database that made no sense.  I remember trying to add a new employee for the first time and spent a few minutes searching through the tabs to find the required field I hadn't filled in and it was selecting 'Restaurant' from the 'Revenue Department' pulldown menu that had only that one single selection.  It couldn't give you a prompt to indicate which field was missing?  Then there was what I called the ""Poison Table"" issue that manifested when a server messed up splitting items on a check for a large table.  Sometimes they would split an item twice and there would be a charge for 1/72th of an entree or whatever on each check.  Well the database object in their system was only built to handle 255 items on a table so when this happened and the server tried to close out the terminal crash and be inoperable for a few minutes while it rebooted and every time the icon for that table was punched it would crash AGAIN and have to be rebooted AGAIN and the problem could only be resolved by them reimaging the terminal remotely.  FUCK.

So tonight I just needed a Timecard Detail report and the GM has to look through a couple hundred employee names (most of whom are no longer with the company) not once but twice.  And there's no fucking search function.  There's a text field at the top of the window but it only displays the currently selected name and has no input function.  Fuck you micros.

Apparently a table walked in and order food, didn't present the coupons they had until AFTER they ate, and tried to give her 2 of them. They were only allowed one, and they got pissed off. So big bossman comes out (he had been cooking, and I came in to relieve him of his duties) and asks what the issue is. He tells them the guidelines of using the coupon, points it out, and says he cant accept both of them. He tried to be courteous about it. but the woman insisted we had to take both, and that he had to take them, and she got angry. 

that's a big no-no. No one tells bossman what to do. Its his restaurant. He told them ""You know what, I don't want your business, and I dont want your money. I want you to leave."" He ended up escorting the woman's husband out of the restaurant because they were so irritated that bossman wouldn't allow them to be entitled pricks because they wanted $20 of free food.

They had played at the Soundwave festival earlier that night, and asked someone backstage, where to eat and they dropped our name.
11:30 comes round, (kitchen usually closes at 10:30) and the dining room is empty and Lars, Kurt and Rob finally show, with their entourage of about 20 people, pushed out 4 grand worth of food and drink, and thats not including the $600 worth of tips they left for us.
All in all a late night but awesome, got a kitchen photo with Lars, and a photo with chef, Rob and a good mate.
Definitely a night I won't forget!

The chef says ""Cover All"" and it is done religiously.

Also, I feel like we sandbag everything- even the sliders are par-cooked and sometimes we hold cooked lobsters in the hotbox. Shameful, yet we keep getting high ratings, so I guess no one is the wiser.

The rider for the party mentions that one of the guests is *VEGAN* and so first thing I do is start figuring out what we have around that doesn't have chicken stock or dairy in it.  I make a quick mushroom stock and use it to start a vegan risotto with oyster mushrooms and asparagus.  Naturally, the party gets fired right when half of our other walkins want food so I'm on two stations and trying to babysit this risotto.  Finally sent out all the party food and I find out that the vegan decided that he wanted the seabass instead.  O________________o

Oh also he wants a half side of fries without Parmesan.  I guess he didn't notice that I had mounted the chicken stock and white wine based sauce for his seabass with butter.

So we've got two more reservations after this party so we're pretty much quarting everything up around 8:45 and preclosing.  We bang out the last couple tables who keep ordering apps for entrees to make sure the two of us are spread out over all of the four stations at the same time.

Then around 10 we are informed that we had a 10 top walking in, so we cease the preclosing activities and wait.  The order comes in, half of them want chicken, and we are about 30 seconds away from dropping meat in the pan when someone from the FOH comes up and says ""They're leaving, cancel the order!""  And they were serious.  Apparently it was somebody's 21st birthday and they asked the bartender about some esoteric cocktail with blackberries in it, the bartender told them that we didn't have any in house (which we did, our bartenders are idiots) and they decided that since they couldn't have their blackberry cocktail that the entire party of 11 wanted to cancel their order that had just printed out on our tickets and leave.  Probably about $700 worth of food that thankfully we hadn't quite started cooking yet because we were grabbing what we needed out of the walkin having been mostly broken down.

Oh, did I mention that it was an 'urban' group.  One of our black food runners watched the whole thing go down and said that he figured they got sticker shock after seeing the prices and that the whole ""not having blackberries for the cocktail"" thing was an excuse to leave.

And after cancelling their entire order they took the time to take pictures of the entire group in the dining room before they left.  Gotta have material for the twitter.

After years of busting ass in New York City and Chicago working for douchetacular GMs, Napoleonic Execs, mouth breathing front of house staff, bullshit pay, broken promises, and blame shifting, naive, completely green culinary Line liabilities, I hit the wall hard. Not all the shops I worked in were like this (met some amazing professionals through the journey), but every other place seemed to crawl with one or more of the aforementioned bunch. Back and forth between ""I absolutely fucking love this,"" shifted to ""what the fuck am I doing?"" relatively fast. 

Now, I've worked long enough to know this comes with the territory and while I've taken a bit of a break, I'm once again getting that itch to jump back into The Fire.

I know that for a fact, I've worked for, and impressed plenty of other people. The expectation of his berating the next day at work is making me lose sleep. I feel like there's nothing I can do to please him, and I feel like I'm giving up.

Update: i told him how much i work and what i really make he offered me 34. He feels i should take the offer as it would show i want in this feild. I took it as a pressure tactic.

My chef and I were catering a supper club for 30, and needed free labor so he called the culinary school and asked them to recommend a good intern. This kid was definitely eager to please and efficient enough, but what an ego for a person with a grand total of a semester and a half of ""kitchen"" ""experience"". He had pretty much ""sized me up"" after about 3 sentences of dialogue from which all he got was ""girl cook. dessert baker. dropped out of school"" and wrote me off as not worthy of his ""network"". 

He bragged about his ""long"" days that week/semester spent taking finals and sitting in classes. There was a time in my life where I would have countered this with ""Man, I have been up since 3 am baking desserts, I'm working dinner/late night here, and I'm waking up at 3 am tomorrow; that's nothing"" but I am now older and less competitive so I just nodded.

Chef was talking to me about pig foot stock and we were both kind of drooling over the idea of various foot stocks in general, and mentioned how expensive veal stock is. The intern pipes up ""yeah we make it in school all the time! It's really expensive!""

Chef was making a la minute risotto for 30, and explaining that he's against pre/par-cooking risotto. The intern goes ""Yeah, that stuff's awful!"" despite the fact that most of the risotto he's probably ever had has been par-cooked and is obviously decent (or nobody would be doing it), just not amazing. Then he goes on to say ""That was the first thing we learned in pantry class. Risotto with *veal stock*"", with *veal stock* in the same tone of voice as ""I was partying last night, no biggie, ran into *Robert Downey Jr.*"" About an hour later he felt a need to mention the risotto *with veal stock* again. 

He spent the entire night interrupting me and bragging about his darn school (which is a community college cooking program). I'm down for people getting a little experience to get a foot in the door in the industry, but I sure wish those schools would teach them not to be such brats.
